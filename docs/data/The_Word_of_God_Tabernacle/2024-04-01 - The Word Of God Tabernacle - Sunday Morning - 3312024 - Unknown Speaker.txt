bless us help us Lord as we celebrate this beautiful Resurrection morning this Easter morning that we call it Lord this Resurrection morning knowing that you are still alive God you are living in US Lord you're moving in and out the Avenues of our heart and in this place today the anointing of the Sweet Holy Spirit once again we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done accomplish now Lord that purpose that you have this service set for forth four we'll be careful to give you the thanks the Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Matthew chap 28 verse1 the end of the Sabbath as it began to draw toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the supper behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his rainment white as snow and for for fear of him the keepers did shake and become as dead men the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for I know uh that you seek Jesus who was crucified he is not here for He Is Risen amen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have told you they departed quickly from the SE ER with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying all hell and they came and held him by his feet by the feet and worshiped him then said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that they go uh that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me amen you could be seated if you'd like amen Easter I have an Easter message here of course obviously honoring the resurrection of the Lord Jesus I just want to take a simple topic something that was on my heart uh a little bit this week was about the about the quickening power and um I got in here yesterday and started looking a little deeper and uh and this thought came on my heart the angel of the Lord these women came to the SRE to try to dress Jesus body and to honor his uh his life by his burial uh and not knowing obviously that he was going to raise although uh he was rebuked by Jesus and the angel to say look he told you this was going to happen amen Jesus even told them later ye of uh actually we'll probably read that uh ye of ye are slow of heart ye fools and slow of heart to believe the word all the word says that this is going to happen I told you that when this happened that I would raise again uh so when it comes to pass sometimes when things happen that we that we ask the Lord about we trust the Lord is going to do what he said he would do a lot of sometimes when it happens it's so miraculous that we we we're we're dumbfounded how did this happen well he told you it was going to happen how did this happen well you asked for it you asked the Lord to do something and the Lord did it amen so why would that be so uh uh so unusual for us when we expect it to happen we believe the Lord is going to do what he said he would do but the angel answered now this is the point I want to get into the sixth verse the sixth verse says the angel told them they came down from heaven remember this great earthquake took place sounds kind of familiar doesn't it yes amen earthquake takes place and an angel's there with a message amen how how how familiar we as message Believers know that yes amen an earthquake takes place and the prophets there to and Angels there to tell us uh the the give us the message sixth verse now though he said he is not here for He Is Risen as he said amen he is risen now I want to turn to a different uh Proclamation here today uh it's nothing that's unusual but it's an Easter message just something to uh help us with today's Journey that we live in but the proclamation here was that he is risen amen that's what the angel of the Lord told them he is risen and that is a wonderful Proclamation and uh and you see all over the place or some places used to be all over the place not so much anymore but used to see uh decorations and things around he is risen and that and that became the the the cry that we have that that angel gave them that he is risen but I want us to understand and the proclamation that I want to make today is not just he is risen but he is here yes amen he's here not just risen which is important because he couldn't be here if he had not Rose but he is here here amen that's the main thing that we want to know to understand is that he is here to make every one of those promises that he gave us all through the scripture all the foretelling in the Old Testament New Testament things that Jesus said the things that Jesus told them there that we have recorded everyone came to pass understand that he now is here amen he's here to make every one of those promises come to pass yes it's amazing that someone usually when someone one writes a a uh a last willing Testament the that Testament doesn't come into effect until after the person's dead that's the same uh all around that The Testament doesn't come into effect until that person's dead but Jesus is the only one who brought the testimony he wrote The Testament and he died to bring It full effect but he rose again to make sure that every object every item that's on that last will and Tes gets fulfilled amen amen he is usually we have to go to a judge or an Arbiter or uh an executive of a will or something like that to find out who got what uh how much money did I get did I get the house on the beach did I get this fancy car whatever it is they want to go and a lot of times they fight over that but Jesus is the only one that rose again from the dead to make every one of the things that's in his will come to pass you know why cuz he's the only one that could do it it amen I couldn't make all the promises that Jesus put in here come to pass right amen if he had died and stayed in the grave never not not one of them would have come to pass but because he rose again he can make every single one of the items on his will come to pass yes amen what he gave you he could only do because he came back again what he promised us he can only do because he came back again these promises he can only fulfill in our lives now because he's here now yes praise the lord it's the only way it could happen St John Chapter 2 let's go over to St John Chapter 2 now I won't be too long today amen a lot of times we have big plans on Easter Sunday I got to catch ples so that's not the reason I'm shortening this as you all have found out in the past but uh my flight leaves today at 154 so uh there will be no Easter of that uh happening for me but uh maybe I'll go to Cracker Barrel when we get to [Music] California they don't have grumpies there Josh so I gotta go some place different right it works yeah it works amen St John Chapter 2 amen verse uh let's begin with verse 13 St John 2:13 and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold ox and sheep Dov and changers of money sitting and when he had made a scorge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the Changers money and overthrew the tables now does that sound like a wonderful Meek quiet humble uh person to you oh they come in and just say oh it's all okay everything's going to be just fine don't worry about it it's you know you can desecrate the most holy place that's been put on this planet it's okay no no no there was a there was a a righteousness to this that Jesus was to bring forth to not desecrate the holy place that uh that was that was set for God not for merchandising it was it was established for God not for merchandising that's why we come that's why when we come in here we don't have a great party right uh we don't carry on and and talk about the basketball scores last night or uh who had the best dinner or uh who who got the new rais on their job or something we we don't do that there's plenty other places to do that there's there's a fellowship there's outside there's restaurants there's homes we can go anywhere and do those we come in here to meet the holies of holies we don't come here to to to merchandise and for changing and for no we come here to meet with God Almighty amen and and to honor that and Jesus was honoring that when he overthrew the table 16th verse he said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house and House of merchandise praise the Lord and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house uh ha eaten me up that's Psalm 69 if you will if you wanted to go back and look at it then answer the Jews and we get to this point now that uh of jesus' proclamation see because the angel told them he is risen as he said he would I know I added a few words to that but that's the gist of it he said that he would raise again he has risen like he said he would now we get to that point then answered the Jews said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up and that is exactly what he did amen amen that is exactly what he did and without spiritual Revelation you don't understand what he's talking about look at them then said the Jews 4 and6 years was this Temple and building and wil thou rear it up rear it up in three days but he spake of the Temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered amen his disciples remembered and a lot of what we do we do in remembrance amen just like the communion we take next week we do in remembrance praise the lord it's not something that's new to us but it's brought to us in remembrance we're all human uh a lot of the you ever heard the phrase the squeaky will gets the grease well that just simply means that the thing that's the most prominent or the thing that's the noisiest gets the most attention well the things that gets the most attention a lot of times in life is just all the stuff that happens in life and all the other things usually the more important things get shoved into the back right and get some times forgotten or at least forgotten for a period of time until it's brought to our remembrance until it's brought forth again of the importance of it see and there in this place it was it was remembrance see therefore he was risen from the dead the disciples remembered praise the Lord that he had said unto them that they would believe the scripture and the word uh Jesus uh that Jesus had said what was it that he had said you destroyed this Temple amen and I will raise it up in three days and that's exactly what Jesus did it was raised up in three days it could not stay in a grave because the grave could not hold God right amen death could not hold God hell could not hold God right all of the things of the of the enemy could not hold God right so he raised again in three days that raising brought about the promises that he had promised see and he told them that but now without spiritual Revelation you can't can't understand it doesn't come as a reality to you because they're still now the disciples looked at that and it come to their remembrance of what he said but all the rest of them look and say well the temple still up they they think about some great buildings and uh these temples that were reared up in so so many years and uh and all this that had taken place that that's all that they got from it it reminds me I was reading uh I was reading in in the last part of Matthew 28 and you know and I have a scope pH Study Bible Scofield was a brilliant man a doctor of divinity um knew the Bible inside and out but if you go back to it's just something as simple as we know as baptism and he goes into Matthew 28 where he's talking about it Jesus said go forth into all the world teaching them and baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he actually had of course this is a trinitarian he actually had enough gumption to put in there a brilliant man a man that you probably couldn't touch him for his knowledge of the scripture uh so brilliant would put in there that father son Holy Ghost is the name singular of Jesus Christ amen and I thought how how could such a brilliant man first of all even think even intimate that father is a name that son is a name that Holy Spirit is a name they're not names but yet he puts forth this idea holding to that trinitarian doctrine of three gods that Father Son and Holy Ghost is the singular name of Jesus Christ I thought without Revelation you don't see it right without God revealing it to you just like them looking here and thinking that Jesus is talking about a uh uh this building when Nicodemus came to him Jesus said you must be born again he said how can I enter my mother's womb again the second time with without without spiritual Revelation the carnal cannot see uh the the things of God yes uh the things of God remember we just went through what 15 16 17 Parts God in Simplicity amen God hides it to those that the wise and prudent reveals to those that will learn those that want to know those that have it in their heart to want to be uh uh close to him want to know the things of God now Jesus is here Jesus is here living the same life here that he was living when he was here in the flesh cuz he's still God remember God does not change people look and say that well Jesus did this when he was here but what about today was going to do the exact same thing today or he's not God the difference is the way God is working today is through his through his children God is working his work through us today not here in a Corporal body that we call Jesus Christ but here in Corporal bodies that he has in a many membered body Around The World God is working his work still today doing the same thing as as times change God does not change amen and it's the power of that resurrection that brought it to us it's the power of that resurrection that brought it to us to the place that he could pour himself into us now and that he could live through us yes amen Jesus can live through us because he is alive because he has risen he's the same here today now let's go to St Luke chapter 24 St Luke chapter 24 amen because he's in us the power of the Resurrection was in Jesus yes when they took the life from his body and they could not have done it unless he laid down his life amen they say they took it but he laid it down he laid down his life the power of the Resurrection was already the quickening power was already in Jesus because he's God Almighty the resurrection power the quickening power that quickening just means to make it alive yes that quickening power was already in him now if Jesus through that quickening power raised again from death and Hell conquered death hell in the grave and Rose to ascend upon high at the authority of God people want to say the right hand I know excuse me the Bible says right hand but that simply means the authority and power God's a spirit he doesn't have a right hand like we have amen and if it is he's sitting on the right hand then God's there with his hand underneath Jesus because he's sitting on it no it's the power amen it's the authority that was given if that quickening power now was in Jesus to raise him from the dead and to bring him forth like it did so that he could come back on the day of Pentecost and live his life as he's doing now through every one of us that means that in him being that quickening power through us is now in us the quickening power now is in us the Resurrection The ability of Resurrection is in each one of us that's why we don't fret over those that have passed on we don't worry about the loved ones that have gone on before in Christ because we know that that same quickening power that was in them is going to do the same thing for them that it did for Jesus Christ that it would do for us if we went by the way of the Grave that it will still do for us when the changing of the body and a Rapture takes place amen the dead in Christ shall rise first those who alive and remain shall be caught up together with him to meet the Lord in the air that is the quickening power of God that's to make alive all that that that was dead bring to life that life is now within each and every believer yeah because Jesus is if Christ is there then that quickening power is there the power The Authority that you need to be able to raise if you came if you go by the way of the Grave or if a Rapture to when we are a part of the live and remain group when the Rapture takes place that that quickening power is already there yes amen amen that quickening power that raised Jesus is the same quickening power that will raise you ma uh excuse me Luke chapter 24 let's start with verse one I want to read almost the whole chapter I was debating on this whether or not but we' still got some time so let's read the whole thing we'll get to the part that I mentioned earlier too and still the Jews eyes were Holden look at these two here as we read now upon the first uh first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the SRE bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the Seer and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead praise the Lord did he not tell you he was going to raise again amen he's not here it's been three days that's exactly what he said he's not here why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but he is risen remember remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men crucified and the third day Rise Again praise the Lord it has happened amen sir why are you perplexed why are you so confused why are you afraid amen those are all natural normal human uh emotions but the point of it is Faith conquers those when we know what Jesus said amen that because that's what we believe amen humans were taught to believe everything we can see taste Bill Smell or here amen but when we become Christians we're taught to understand that Faith overrides all of those senses and we believe him first yes even if it's things that don't make sense to our eyes or don't make sense to our touch or smell we believe that first because we know that he is the creator of that yes amen The Giver of every good gift praise the Lord seventh verse now saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men be crucified the third day they rise again and they remembered again they remembered his words and returned from the SRE and told all those things unto the 11 and to all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James the other woman that were uh that were with them which told them these things uh told these things unto the discip uh Apostles and their words seemed to uh to them as Idle tales and they believe them not even though they're preaching the word word right they're telling them the truth they're giving them scripture if you will amen they're giving them the word of Jesus we're telling you Jesus said he would do this Jesus did this now we're telling you that it's happened and they still don't believe them my help us Lord help thou our unbelief am then arose Peter and ran into the SRE and stooping down he uh he beheld the linen claws laid by themselves and departing wondering in himself at that which was come to pass behold two of them went the same day to the Village called emus now here we go two men went uh the same day the village called EMAs which was from Jerusalem about three Square for long fur long which is a little over 1700 ft and they talked together which is about a quart of a mile and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that that while they communed together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them you think that would be great celebration when Jesus draws near amen isn't there great celebration I mean we celebrate here and then bring the the presence of the Lord is here in this great celebration when Jesus draws near when Jesus is in your presence whether you're in your bedroom or closet or where your in your car wherever you are when the presence of Jesus comes there's great celebration but look they went near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him amen now were they holding through unbelief were they holding because they of a lack of expectation a lack of faith why were their eyes Holden it doesn't tell us that it could be any number of reasons why their eyes were Holden that they didn't see that that was Jesus normally when Jesus comes around amen we always recog recogniz his presence they see that's the sad part sometimes we don't always recognize God's presence when it comes around we usually in church uh is probably more so but uh sometimes we don't always recognize it's Jesus when Jesus is there Their Eyes Were hold and they didn't know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that ye have one with another as you walk and our sad and and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known these things which are come to pass there in these days and he's talking to the one with whom they happen to amen my I I I just think it's just outstanding but you know I I don't look at I don't I try not to look at the Bible as like a book of History I try to look at it to understand what we go through today and how we live and how we feel and the same circumstances that arise and uh and and and what means to us see cuz it's fine that that happened to Copus and his buddy there but how about us amen what about happen in our lives with us today that that's more important to that's actually more important to me because it's me and you amen 19th verse and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him now you can see on one hand where when when they saw him they fell at his feet they grabbed his feet in worship the others are sitting over there thankful celebrating that they crucified him they finally got rid of him though so they thought they finally got rid of it this men to our religion we talked about religion last week don't like religion that that solidifies our religion we finally got rid of him well they didn't get rid of them all they did was remember that remember the story I told you maybe some here had hadn't heard the story I told you about when we used to when me and my family used to live in Florida they had these big brown spiders they weren't dangerous or poisonous necessarily but they were they were big I mean literally legs and all could get that big and I'm not exag am I exaggerating no no I'm they would get that big well one time there was a woman that I heard the story about that and they're hard to get rid of because they're they fall off the trees you can't exterminate them you can exterminate but they would fall off the trees and just get in your house so to exterminate them in the in the corners and all it didn't work they just come fall for tree come in and one time a a woman had one on the side of her wall in her kitchen and it's one of the big and she and she said well I'll just kill this thing so she grabs I believe she waded up some newspaper uh which is usually my weapon of choice uh with a spider or something she wed up a newspaper and she went in I believe it's in the kitchen and she whacked that spider as hard as she could and smashed it flat little did she know that underneath that spider was a egg sack oh and as soon as she killed that spider that egg sack went poof and hundreds of spiders went all all over her house that's exactly what the devil did he thought I'll take I'll roll up a newspaper and I'll smack Jesus one good time and I'll kill him and be done with him and all he did was when he put Jesus in the grave was that his life came back and now he's got to deal with all of us instead of one person now he's got millions to deal with they had to tent that woman's house and fumigated for a week or two to get rid of all those little bitty spiders all over that house amen Satan can fumigate all he wants say but he ain't going to get rid of us yes amen he thought he smashed he thought he smashed Jesus Christ all he did was create multi-millions of people that believe today right who's who his life is in Praise the Lord don't think it worked out quite like he was hoping amen but anyway it happened so that we now could testify of the things of God the things he does Amen Mighty now word uh a word before God to all the people 21st and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done which should have already triggered in their mind what he said about the third day right amen and yay uh certain women also of their of our company made us astonished which were early at the seler when they found not his body they came saying uh that they had also seen a vision of angels uh which said that he was alive and it really wasn't a vision the Angels were just there amen it doesn't say if there if it's present it doesn't need a vision vision is of something that is not present there amen these were the angel was l Lally there but considering the spiritual aspect they considered it a vision which said he was alive and ser of them which were with uh were with us went to the SRE and found it even so as the women said but him they saw not he said unto them oh fools here we go we saw about earlier oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken and we could have taken all the dozens of scriptures that all through the Old Testament was written about Jesus birth death Resurrection amen amen uh old fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things entered into his glory beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in the scripture the things concerning himself and they drew n to the Village whether they went and he made as though it were he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is like to uh look at it as much a spiritual aspect as a natural aspect in the spiritual aspect of it the natural aspect sure the hands taking them breaking it but the spiritual aspect to me says volumes because what he did was he took bread amen he took bread now Jesus was the bread of life and he took bread bread which we consider as food as the word of God this is the meat this is the bread this is the food of God he he took the bread and he broke it to them he took the truth he took the word and he broke it to them the scripture says he started at Moses and he expounded to them through Moses and all the prophets and began to expound to them all the scriptures that talking about Jesus and spiritually as he broke the bread there eyes came open amen what what what would take the scales Open the Eyes uh of of of us of of the spirit of of of uh of our unbelief is when Jesus broke the bread it's the breaking of the bread that helps us be able to see who he is amen recognized by Revelation who Jesus Christ is comes through the breaking of the bread when he breaks the bread forth to us and it comes a realization and a revelation to our hearts it comes fresh something opens to us amen Revelation something that opens to us um I've used the analogy many times about Revelation is like the Jesus sign you ever seen the Jesus sign that that uh the accentuated parts of the Jesus sign is on the parts that don't say Jesus you look at it uh you ever seen one of these signs you and and you look at it and it could be anything but it it was it was to me it became popular years ago uh that Jesus was in the sign yes and I had someone that I believe the first time I saw it had a sign up and said what do you see all I see is a bunch of wooden scribbly uh scribbles uh well look at it I look at it have any of you ever seen these yes that the hidden message if you will that's inside yes the the accentuated parts are the outside parts and all you look at and all you see is you see that the accentuated parts and you look and said well that doesn't make any sense at all there's just a a piece of wood that goes up like that and a piece of wood that goes down like this and that doesn't make any sense to me look at it harder and it took and I'll be honest with you uh I'm not the brightest bulb in the chandelier but uh I like to think I can see stuff sometimes when it comes like riddles and things and I looked and I it took me a while to be able to see it it really did but once I saw it it finally dawned on me with nobody whoever was doing it was mean uh they wouldn't show me the Jes you they nope it was up to me you were either going to see it or you weren't going to see it finally I mean drove me crazy it's like things like that just I I my wife will tell you I just I can't stuff like that just drives I got to figure it out or find it out or remember something or it just I it will stay with me day and night till I figure out that person or that place or whatever it was uh I've seen that person before I know I've seen that person before where I don't know and it drive me crazy till I find out till I remember drive me crazy looking at that thing and what does that say or or are they just playing a trick on me now this is like I said the first time I'd ever seen that are they playing a trick on me but finally finally took me a while but finally I was looking at it and I said there it is j s u s it came so clear that when I look at it I said there it is it's that simple all the all all the accentuated parts that are the outside parts of the letters went away cuz all I could see was Jesus amen when something becomes real to you by the word by the spirit revealing the word to you when it becomes real to you you don't see the outside parts anymore all you see is Jesus amen that's all you can see anymore I can look at however many of those signs all different colors all different shades and all I ever see now is Jesus I don't see the other part anymore I can look at it all I've tried I've actually tried to take one of those signs it's been a long time ago but I've actually tried to take one of those signs and look only at the inside part I cannot do it all I see is Jesus amen amen well when God reveals himself to you friend that's all you see yes amen that's all you see is Jesus you don't see all the other stuff all the other stuff Fades away all the all the other stuff goes away all the things that people may believe or may say to you or try to convince you of this that or the other no all you see is Jesus from that time forward you can look at that sign a thousand times and it'll say Jesus every time amen you can look at like baptism we talked about earlier somebody can try to come along and convince you that it's this way because Jesus said amen but when you look at it all you see is Jesus Lord Jesus Christ amen amen that's all you can see praise the Lord no matter how what great argument anybody could come up with I had somebody come and tell me one time at work I was talking to when I was in business in Charlotte said well but Jesus said see it's here Jesus is this is Jesus own words I said yeah and Jesus own words were also that here Peter I give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you bound on Earth is bound in heaven and right after after that Jesus said father son the Holy Ghost Peter comes out the day of Pentecost fresh from receiving the presence in the holy spirit of God and says baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you tell me which is which was Peter wrong or was Jesus wrong that's quiet but the pro truth of it is neither one's wrong amen praise the Lord cuz Jesus said in the name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost and Peter came forth and told what that name was the Lord Jesus Christ now when you see that it don't matter how many people come around and try to tell you that it's the father Son and the Holy Ghost you don't see anything but Jesus yes you don't see all the other stuff right amen cuz God's revealed it that these when they saw this breaking of the bread that's all they could see when their eyes came open when Jesus broke the bread forth and and their eyes came open all they saw was Jesus yes amen now he disappeared from their sight he he left as it said they he vanished out of their sight but all they saw them was Jesus praise the Lord they said one to another our hearts burned within us while he talked to us by the way while he opened to us the scripture they rose up the same hour returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together to them that were there uh uh that were there with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread praise the Lord I get the physical aspect of but to me that spiritual aspect of him breaking the word the bread of life breaking it to them amen help their eyes to come open because their eyes weren't physically blind they weren't physically blind they were spiritually blind they could see they could see just like me and you can see with their eyes they were spiritually blind so what needed restoring not their physical sight their spiritual sight when their spiritual sight was was restored they saw who he was amen they said our hearts burnt amen and it became known to us as he broke the bread to us and thus they uh uh uh and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you but they were but they were terrified and a frighten and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do your uh why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands my feet that it is not I myself handle me see for us uh uh and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bone as you see me have praise the Lord he's letting them know when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands his feet while they were yet believe uh and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye any meat they gave him a piece of Broad Fish and a honeycomb he took it he didn't eat before them he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses in the prophets in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scripture that's understand we say understand uh do we have a do we have a spiritual understanding do we have a have we been educated into it uh what is the understanding the understanding came from the spirit of God that brought the word life to them just as he had done the road those in the road to him he brought that Revelation that understanding that they would know what he W who he was and what he was talking about right this is that in other words amen praise the Lord or this day yall know why this day this scripture is fulfilled amen before you amen wonderful then open NE understand they might understand the scripture said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in the name uh among all nations beginning at Jerusalem ye are witnesses of these things praise the Lord I got one more scripture I want to read and we'll close here St John again chapter 14 now they failed to recognize the presence of God what was the reason they fail to recognize it because they did not believe what he had told them right was it that all the things of Life had taken over them at that time and obviously the first thing on their mind was the crucifixion of of him uh and and his crucifixion that obviously would have been the first thing on his mind on their on the people's mind was the crucifixion they forget about these other the the things that needed to be brought to their remembrance amen now when it's brought to remembrance that now the unbeliever just doesn't believe but the believer sees that and recognize this is exactly what he said he did what he said he would do amen thank God he's always done that for me personally he's always done that for me yes praise the Lord St John chapter 14 verse1 15 we'll close if ye love me keep my Commandments yes right and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever there's that quickening power the comforter even the spirit of Truth the word the bread whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and and shall be in you amen men which we've discussed many times you go back to the day of Pentecost when the spirit of God came on them and in them praise the Lord just like he said he would do on them and in them just same thing he does today to the believer does the exact same thing I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also amen amen the unbeliever all they see is the in between Parts all they see is the strib lines between the J the E the S the U and the S that's all they see amen but the believer doesn't see anything but Jesus amen the inside parts are irrelevant anymore they might not even they must not they they uh could not even exist you just there's no point of them even being because it's him and him only amen the world doesn't see him but you shall see him praise the Lord at that day ye shall know that I am in the in my father and ye in me and I in you now Jesus Is Here We that was our subject that was our title he is here how is he here amen we know the anointing of the spirit is here but how is he here in Corporal form if you will can only be here through through his through the Believers he can only be here through his children he can only be here because he's as he did on the day of Pentecost put his spirit in those that will believe amen his spirit is in us living through Us in the soul through the spirit which is the life of the body into the flesh which we all see see taste little smell here body influenced by what's on the inside praise the Lord that's a Believer believer is influenced by what's on the inside unbelievers influenced by what's on the outside right amen that's the world's influence is on the outside the believer's influence is influenced by what's inside yes amen and that inside is God Almighty Jesus Christ that inside is him that is our influence our influence is him in US yes amen Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord he is here amen praise the Lord how is he here look around amen praise the Lord let's stand if we

coming resurrect me but amen I always say my wife I had to I was in the world just enough to attract my wife amen for her to be attracted for me to be attracted to her amen if I had if I had been living the life that I should have been living in high school I would have probably never been interested in her amen but because God and his eternal wisdom he knows he knows exactly what to do how to do it uh do I recommend that happen for anybody else absolutely not uh were we probably the only ones that ever happened to probably not but I know what God did for me and I know that that's the truth
