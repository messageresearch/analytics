[46:46] second timothy chapter four read the
[46:49] first four four verses of scripture
[46:51] beginning with number one it says i
[46:53] charge you therefore before god and the
[46:55] lord jesus christ who shall judge the
[46:58] quick and the dead and his appearing in
[46:59] his kingdom
[47:01] preach the word be instant in season out
[47:04] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[47:06] long-suffering and doctrine for the time
[47:09] will come when they will not end or
[47:10] endure sound doctrine but after their
[47:12] own lust shall
[47:14] they hit heap to themselves teachers
[47:17] having itching yearns they shall turn
[47:19] away their ears from fables and shall be
[47:21] turned
[47:23] from the truth and should be turned unto
[47:25] fables amen you can be seated if you
[47:27] like
[47:29] amen
[47:31] i want to take a little subject today
[47:34] tonight of the beginning of the second
[47:36] verse preach the word right
[47:41] i saw something that brother branham
[47:42] said the other day
[47:44] and it just struck me so true
[47:46] that i felt like maybe this was
[47:48] something of a subject that he wanted us
[47:50] to get into tonight and for a wednesday
[47:52] night for
[47:53] uh encouragement short service just uh
[47:56] whatever the lord would have done
[47:57] tonight but uh the thought came to me
[47:59] and
[48:00] uh a priest the word based on that uh
[48:03] quote now i i got the quote i'm going to
[48:05] read it a little bit later but i want to
[48:07] lay a little bit of a foundation of
[48:08] where i'm going tonight and what the
[48:10] whole point of this is
[48:11] uh you know we're all kings and priests
[48:14] we're all ministers we may not every one
[48:16] or be called to stand up here uh to be
[48:18] behind the pulpit to minister the gospel
[48:21] as i'm doing now or as other ministers
[48:23] that have crawled around the world do
[48:25] but we are all ministers as brother pat
[48:27] said god sent him to his family and told
[48:29] him i sent you here to be a witness well
[48:31] that's ministering that's preaching your
[48:33] life is ministering uh to the people
[48:36] around you his life their lives him as
[48:38] sister pat's lives ministering to their
[48:40] family and that's exactly what we do
[48:42] every day that's what god called us for
[48:44] so our lives are ministering but the
[48:47] point that i want to get to tonight is
[48:49] that
[48:51] god called us to preach the gospel amen
[48:54] that's what our commission is that's
[48:56] what god has
[48:58] has called for us and commissioned us to
[49:00] do
[49:01] god didn't call us to tell people what
[49:04] to do he called us to preach the gospel
[49:07] amen
[49:08] he didn't call it see it seems like that
[49:10] people are always wanting to tell
[49:13] somebody else what to do
[49:15] and see the difference there and there's
[49:16] a big difference friend there's a big
[49:18] difference in me telling you what to do
[49:21] then preaching the gospel and then when
[49:24] you preach the gospel and you just lay
[49:26] the gospel out you let the word speak
[49:29] for itself right and then it's not you
[49:32] telling them what to do it's not you
[49:34] coercing them it's not you trying to
[49:36] convince them it's the holy spirit the
[49:39] word going forth and letting god convict
[49:42] that person and god come down and speak
[49:45] to that person and that's when you get a
[49:48] real convert you don't just get a better
[49:50] night you get a christian you don't get
[49:53] a branamite so to speak you get a
[49:56] christian and that's what brother
[49:58] branham endeavored to do was to preach
[50:00] the gospel not to tell everybody what to
[50:03] do and of course
[50:04] people were all the time asking brother
[50:06] branham what to do what should i do
[50:08] about here what's to do about here and
[50:09] you know i'm brother branham gave advice
[50:11] many times or maybe the lord give him
[50:14] something specifically for that person
[50:16] and and and that's a different situation
[50:18] because that's coming from god that's a
[50:20] gift of god right that's not something
[50:22] that you say okay brother branham's
[50:24] telling me no god is just using that
[50:27] instrument to speak to that person amen
[50:30] brother branham just happened to be that
[50:32] instrument i've seen god use instruments
[50:34] that work brother brown to do the exact
[50:37] same thing
[50:38] and if god uses a different instrument
[50:40] it doesn't matter what instrument god
[50:42] uses it's god doing it right but we all
[50:46] it seems like that that we had this in
[50:48] ourselves and you know i think a lot of
[50:50] times that
[50:53] so misunderstood as being legalists
[50:55] right now
[50:57] i know there there are plenty of
[50:59] legalists in the world there's plenty of
[51:01] legalists in this in this message in
[51:04] this move and
[51:05] amongst the believers in this message
[51:07] there's there's legalism there's no
[51:09] doubt about that but you know not but we
[51:13] i hope this doesn't sound too carnal but
[51:15] we get a bum rap a lot of times for
[51:18] being called legalists because so many
[51:21] times people look at this as is is is a
[51:24] list of rules and do's and don'ts and
[51:27] he told me to do this and told me not to
[51:29] do this no that's not our job right our
[51:32] job is not to have a list of dues and
[51:34] don'ts outside the door when you come
[51:36] walking in this sanctuary that's not our
[51:39] job the job is not to uh have it pinned
[51:42] up or broadcast or or put on our website
[51:45] or anything no the job is to preach the
[51:48] gospel that is the commission of the
[51:50] believer is to preach the gospel it's
[51:54] not to tell people what to do is to let
[51:57] the word speak for itself amen
[52:01] when you have somebody
[52:03] see because there's a difference there's
[52:04] a difference in in just preaching the
[52:06] word or giving them the word or letting
[52:09] your life
[52:10] right like brother pat was saying
[52:12] letting your life preach
[52:16] all you're doing is living the word
[52:18] amen
[52:19] all you're doing is letting that person
[52:22] see the gospel in action
[52:25] you might not say a word right but your
[52:27] life is preaching
[52:29] but watch it preaching it better be
[52:31] preaching the word jesus
[52:34] and we and that's the whole gospel that
[52:36] we're preaching because it's christ
[52:38] living in us
[52:40] it's not even uh it's not even trying to
[52:43] say okay you better live like me or
[52:46] you're going to hell
[52:48] see and that's the that's the attitude a
[52:50] lot of people get right i'm not asking
[52:52] people to live like me i'm asking people
[52:55] by the gospel to live like christ
[52:58] which is exactly what i'm trying to do
[53:01] is exactly what we're all trying to do
[53:03] but not to make somebody do it or force
[53:06] them or conform them into this image
[53:10] let god do that we're just called to
[53:12] preach the gospel amen look if you get
[53:15] somebody
[53:16] to do what you tell them to do
[53:19] you've created a convert to you
[53:23] right not to jesus right if i convince
[53:26] somebody to do it the
[53:28] because i told him to do it they become
[53:30] a newton convert
[53:32] not a christian
[53:34] they're just doing it because i told
[53:36] them to right but if you just preach the
[53:38] gospel and you let the word do the
[53:41] speaking for you and then let the holy
[53:44] spirit come and back that word up in
[53:46] that person's life
[53:48] then you're out of the picture it's
[53:50] between them and christ
[53:52] and that's what you want amen that's
[53:54] that's what we want we want a person not
[53:57] convinced
[53:58] because if i could convince them to do
[54:01] what i tell them to do
[54:03] then the next person that comes along
[54:05] with a better argument than me and
[54:07] surely the goodness there's plenty of
[54:08] them because i'm not very bright but
[54:10] it's probably a lot of people that have
[54:12] a lot better argument to try to convince
[54:15] somebody to do something a certain way
[54:18] but when the holy spirit comes
[54:21] when you preach the word
[54:23] and you let the gospel speak and the
[54:26] holy spirit comes and backs that up
[54:29] then you've got to convert to christ not
[54:32] to you and there's not a devil out of
[54:34] hell no matter what argument they got
[54:36] that's going to talk them out of that
[54:38] right right amen
[54:40] nobody will be able to talk to that
[54:42] because it wasn't reasoned into them
[54:45] if they didn't fall in line to some
[54:48] legalism they didn't obey some rule you
[54:51] tapped up on the wall or or taken as you
[54:54] had it
[54:55] to the deacons coming through the door
[54:57] that's not what it's about
[54:59] it's about a life
[55:01] it's about lives lived to christ not to
[55:05] a church not to a message not to an
[55:08] ideology but to jesus christ and the
[55:11] word amen then you've got a convert
[55:14] you've got somebody that will stand by
[55:16] that word regardless of what else comes
[55:19] amen you're not talking them into it
[55:22] you're not telling them what to do
[55:25] you're letting the word speak for itself
[55:27] that's this is the quote that brother
[55:28] adam said
[55:30] that kind of stirred this in me he says
[55:32] now
[55:33] this is in questions and answers 1954.
[55:36] um
[55:38] it's question 48 it says on here it's
[55:41] different than the other one anyway
[55:44] the question was brother bill
[55:47] please tell me
[55:48] how to obtain the baptism of the holy
[55:51] ghost
[55:53] now that's for brother that's a sincere
[55:55] request
[55:56] a sincere question tell me how to get
[56:00] ghost
[56:01] now listen to the rest of the question
[56:02] but hold that in your mind tell me how
[56:05] to obtain the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:08] it is my prayer
[56:12] excuse me it is it is by prayer
[56:16] surrendered life
[56:18] accepting it as
[56:20] uh as we do healing
[56:22] i know what it is to have faith for
[56:25] healing when you prayed for me here
[56:28] do you pray and lay hands on for the
[56:32] baptism of the holy ghost i was baptized
[56:35] in the name of father son the holy ghost
[56:38] please tell me if i should be
[56:40] re-baptized in the name of jesus christ
[56:44] as you spoke recently
[56:46] now as i read this question and i can't
[56:49] even remember how i came across it
[56:52] but as i read this question you know
[56:54] what i was expecting the answer to be
[56:56] from brother brown
[56:58] probably the same thing you might be
[57:00] thinking right now i was shocked when i
[57:02] read his answer
[57:04] i was expecting him to say oh absolutely
[57:07] brother you better go now and get
[57:09] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[57:11] christ because you've been baptized in
[57:13] the father son of the holy ghost you're
[57:14] not even baptized yet
[57:16] or something along that order
[57:18] but look what brother graham said
[57:20] he said now my dear christian friend i'm
[57:23] not telling you what to do
[57:27] amen
[57:28] praise the lord i i tell you what it
[57:30] busts my bubble when i read that answer
[57:33] it it shattered everything that i had
[57:35] imagined in my mind that brother graham
[57:37] was going to say in response to that he
[57:40] said i'm not telling you what to do
[57:42] i am only laying the scripture down
[57:46] amen now see that's the whole and that's
[57:49] what precipitated the whole thought here
[57:52] i'm not telling you what to do i'm only
[57:54] laying down the scripture
[57:57] telling you what the word says
[57:59] amen you have to make your own decision
[58:02] right i'm not telling you what to do you
[58:04] have to do what you feel convicted what
[58:07] you feel is what the holy spirit is
[58:09] doing in your life that's what you need
[58:12] to do not what i tell you to do
[58:14] because if you do what i tell you to do
[58:16] you become a brand of might right you
[58:18] become a brand i'm converted not a
[58:20] christian
[58:21] you do what the holy spirit's telling
[58:22] you based on the preaching of the word
[58:26] then you've got then you become a
[58:27] christian now you've got something
[58:29] that'll hold you right
[58:31] amen
[58:32] i like that see that that just got this
[58:37] i'm only laying the scripture down and
[58:39] it just thought i just made me think how
[58:41] many times we
[58:43] we even in our spirit we get to the
[58:45] place
[58:47] this person what to do we gotta tell
[58:50] them this and we gotta tell them that
[58:51] and we gotta convince them and we gotta
[58:54] uh
[58:55] that that's not the god called us to
[58:59] preach the gospel
[59:00] whether it's a word whether it's a deed
[59:03] whether it's a life whether it's behind
[59:06] a pulpit whatever wherever
[59:08] god called us to preach the gospel
[59:12] amen
[59:13] i'm not telling you what to do i'm just
[59:15] laying the scripture down
[59:17] amen
[59:18] you know
[59:19] and he said and you know what the holy
[59:21] ghost can come right now while we're
[59:24] speaking
[59:25] see he puts it off of himself onto the
[59:28] holy spirit
[59:30] the holy ghost is a gift of god that is
[59:32] the gift of god it could come while
[59:35] we're speaking
[59:37] if the people was taught right now we
[59:39] mentioned that a little bit sunday uh
[59:41] probably
[59:42] precipitated from this if the people was
[59:45] taught right
[59:46] some of you old timers here let me ask
[59:48] you something the old timer says been in
[59:50] the tabernacle watch when i baptize
[59:52] people listen this is really good
[59:55] when i baptize people and you ministers
[59:58] take this for an example
[1:00:01] i've taught these people
[1:00:03] till they had that life cleaned up
[1:00:06] before they went in the water
[1:00:09] what did he do he preached the gospel he
[1:00:12] didn't just convince somebody that they
[1:00:14] needed to be baptized in the name of the
[1:00:16] lord jesus christ
[1:00:18] he didn't just tell this christian
[1:00:20] brother right here you got to go right
[1:00:22] now and get baptized in the name of
[1:00:23] jesus christ no he said i preached the
[1:00:26] gospel and i laid the scripture out so
[1:00:29] that they got their lives cleaned up
[1:00:31] before they even hit the water
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] again
[1:00:37] that's something that
[1:00:39] right that's something that'll hold the
[1:00:41] person amen
[1:00:42] he said they had that life cleaned up
[1:00:45] before they even went to the water
[1:00:48] and i had them believing that god was
[1:00:50] obligated to keep his promise as soon as
[1:00:54] they was baptized in the name of the
[1:00:55] lord jesus christ now you see how
[1:00:58] he throws in being baptized in the name
[1:01:00] of the lord jesus christ without telling
[1:01:03] the brother you've got to do this you
[1:01:06] see
[1:01:08] i
[1:01:09] 1954.
[1:01:14] it's just outstanding this is god right
[1:01:17] it's just god and and it upsets so much
[1:01:20] of the alpha card of the of the normal
[1:01:22] way of thinking and and sometimes the
[1:01:24] way brothers preach and and try to
[1:01:28] convince people
[1:01:29] try to uh
[1:01:31] get people to to follow their rules
[1:01:34] and it's just so
[1:01:36] this is just so far removed from that
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:41] it's outstanding to me
[1:01:43] the holy spirit was right there to
[1:01:45] receive it and when they come up out of
[1:01:47] the water they receive the holy ghost
[1:01:51] because he had them by the by the word
[1:01:54] into a place where their lives were
[1:01:56] cleaned up they were ready for baptism
[1:01:59] and when they came out of the water the
[1:02:00] holy spirit came on them
[1:02:03] amen and notice again he said baptized
[1:02:07] in the name of jesus christ
[1:02:09] he puts that in there so that they
[1:02:11] understand that's the scriptural baptism
[1:02:15] amen but he didn't tell the man what to
[1:02:17] do he just gave him the word and that's
[1:02:20] exactly what we're supposed to do
[1:02:22] give them the word right
[1:02:24] even john said what just give them the
[1:02:26] word test
[1:02:27] you know if you give them the word test
[1:02:29] you can find out where the person is
[1:02:31] you know brother brother green told that
[1:02:33] story about that man one time and and he
[1:02:36] was against the course of the branamites
[1:02:39] the people that uh
[1:02:41] followed brother bradham or were brother
[1:02:43] branham converts whatever you want to
[1:02:44] say
[1:02:45] and he was mad at them and he said oh uh
[1:02:48] uh uh i i don't follow any man
[1:02:51] uh i don't follow any man i i i never
[1:02:54] follow a man you all follow a man i
[1:02:56] never follow a man
[1:02:58] brother green said he got to talking to
[1:03:00] the man you got to find out that
[1:03:02] everything was about his wife
[1:03:04] and brother green looked at him and said
[1:03:06] you know sir you're right you don't
[1:03:08] follow a man you follow a woman
[1:03:10] all right
[1:03:12] here you go
[1:03:14] amen but usually somebody's following
[1:03:17] somebody
[1:03:18] the whole point of the gospel the whole
[1:03:21] point of ministering the gospel is to
[1:03:23] get us all to follow christ
[1:03:27] amen amen
[1:03:28] praise the lord say yeah you're not
[1:03:31] following the man you're following a
[1:03:32] woman when they come up out of the water
[1:03:34] they had the holy ghost shepherds teach
[1:03:36] your sheep get them in the bible amen
[1:03:40] teach them amen don't tell them teach
[1:03:43] them the difference yeah you agree with
[1:03:45] me now there's a difference
[1:03:47] there's only a few of us yeah you agree
[1:03:50] there i can't hear you if you're
[1:03:51] streaming but um you agree now you see
[1:03:55] what i'm saying you understand there's a
[1:03:57] difference between teaching them and
[1:03:59] telling them right amen there's a
[1:04:00] difference amen there's a there's a huge
[1:04:03] spiritual difference
[1:04:04] away from that old textbook of some
[1:04:06] church and get down here in the bible
[1:04:08] where god is taught right you won't and
[1:04:10] you won't have those troubles
[1:04:13] yes laying on of hands
[1:04:15] is how we can
[1:04:17] receive the holy ghost by some anointed
[1:04:19] person laying hands doesn't mean that's
[1:04:21] the only
[1:04:23] we can receive the holy ghost it is a
[1:04:26] way amen that's provided scripturally
[1:04:29] that people could receive the holy ghost
[1:04:31] amen it is possible that that is a way
[1:04:35] but
[1:04:37] as far as a minister pastor and and
[1:04:40] brother green has said this uh i
[1:04:42] remember many many times
[1:04:44] the pastor's not your holy ghost right
[1:04:48] right uh brother green would say this
[1:04:50] like i said many times he would say i am
[1:04:52] not your holy ghost and and i would say
[1:04:55] that too i am not your holy ghost
[1:04:58] your best friend or the person that led
[1:04:59] you to christ your brother branham is
[1:05:02] not your holy ghost
[1:05:04] the one that is to lead you the one that
[1:05:07] is to guide you the one is to bring you
[1:05:09] into all truth
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:12] by the preaching of the word now the
[1:05:15] preaching of the word of course is is an
[1:05:18] integral part of it the preaching has to
[1:05:21] be done
[1:05:22] but again there's a big difference in
[1:05:25] teaching somebody and telling
[1:05:27] and telling somebody something right
[1:05:29] amen that's that's again that's the
[1:05:31] reason a lot of people mistake
[1:05:33] um
[1:05:34] you know
[1:05:35] our thoughts our
[1:05:37] fellowship is uh not uh specifically but
[1:05:40] you know
[1:05:41] christian believers i'll just say
[1:05:42] apostolic faith
[1:05:44] uh message believers that that were
[1:05:46] legalists
[1:05:48] because of that we're legalists we just
[1:05:50] have a bunch of rules and you know they
[1:05:52] they always get upset well we're free to
[1:05:54] do whatever we want to no you're just
[1:05:55] bound to the devil and you don't know it
[1:05:57] that's their biggest thing
[1:05:59] because they all conform to some kind of
[1:06:01] an image
[1:06:02] amen those images brother dan uh uh
[1:06:06] uh
[1:06:07] evans came and talked to us about those
[1:06:10] images amen those people had those
[1:06:12] images just like the image of daniel
[1:06:14] that the the three
[1:06:15] three hebrew children were supposed to
[1:06:17] bow down to
[1:06:18] amen
[1:06:19] supposed to bow down to daniel
[1:06:22] a lot of people today that they they
[1:06:24] want to pay homage and bow down to
[1:06:25] william brown oh my yeah what an image
[1:06:28] friend
[1:06:29] people make people make a person an
[1:06:32] image people make a church an image amen
[1:06:37] that image is going to be what they're
[1:06:38] going to worship until they die
[1:06:41] whatever it is
[1:06:43] and it's sad because those images is
[1:06:45] what is is where that legalism is built
[1:06:47] on amen and they're they're told what to
[1:06:50] do and they're going to do it
[1:06:53] they're going to that's it that's the
[1:06:54] same nicolaitan system that that uh
[1:06:57] that's been from the first church that
[1:07:00] the catholic church is built on that
[1:07:02] nicolaitanism
[1:07:03] amen now let's go to romans
[1:07:06] um
[1:07:06] chapter 10.
[1:07:12] amen i i i
[1:07:15] just the feeling the the thought the
[1:07:17] the point
[1:07:18] across but they've got a couple more
[1:07:20] scriptures i want to get to
[1:07:22] romans chapter 10 verse 12.
[1:07:29] amen romans 10 12
[1:07:33] for there is no difference between the
[1:07:35] jew and the greek for the same lord over
[1:07:38] all is rich unto all that call upon him
[1:07:41] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:07:44] of the lord shall be saved
[1:07:47] how then shall they call on him and whom
[1:07:49] they have not believed
[1:07:51] and how shall how shall they believe in
[1:07:54] him of who they have not heard
[1:07:57] and how shall they hear without a
[1:07:59] preacher
[1:08:00] so there's got to be preaching right
[1:08:02] there's got to be ministering
[1:08:04] to get people to care
[1:08:06] to get people to be
[1:08:08] a
[1:08:10] place to where they are no longer
[1:08:12] ignorant
[1:08:13] they're taught
[1:08:15] they're taught the gospel
[1:08:17] but the teaching the gospel is not is is
[1:08:21] just preaching it's putting the word out
[1:08:23] there amen
[1:08:25] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:08:28] sent
[1:08:29] sometimes i think there's a lot of those
[1:08:31] but anyway
[1:08:32] uh as it is written how beautiful are
[1:08:34] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:08:36] of peace and bring glad tidings of good
[1:08:38] things the gospel the gospel has to be
[1:08:41] preached
[1:08:43] amen it's got to be ministered
[1:08:45] it's scriptural that god calls
[1:08:48] uh
[1:08:49] men by the holy spirit anointing gift
[1:08:52] to to preach the gospel to minister the
[1:08:54] gospel in his capacity that god has
[1:08:57] those selected and chosen people that
[1:09:00] he's desired for whatever reason to be
[1:09:02] able to fulfill that office right
[1:09:05] and those people are to preach the
[1:09:08] gospel that's what their job is right
[1:09:10] amen that's that's all god's
[1:09:13] commissioned them to do is to preach the
[1:09:15] gospel
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:17] and invisible union
[1:09:19] program says
[1:09:21] what a sacred trust what a
[1:09:23] responsibility to a woman now see why
[1:09:25] she's a type of the church which has the
[1:09:28] same responsibility as a woman has a
[1:09:31] sacred responsibility to her motherhood
[1:09:33] to her virtues to her husband the church
[1:09:36] has a sacred responsibility to prayer
[1:09:39] and to the word and to christ just the
[1:09:41] same as the woman hands
[1:09:43] and as a woman drifts off with another
[1:09:45] man when the church goes off on an
[1:09:47] institutional program
[1:09:49] building programs schools and so forth
[1:09:53] brother bannon says i have nothing
[1:09:55] against them
[1:09:56] brothers brother branham said he didn't
[1:09:58] have anything against institutional
[1:10:00] programs nothing against their building
[1:10:02] programs or building their schools he
[1:10:05] said i have nothing against them they're
[1:10:07] all all right
[1:10:09] they serve their purpose but jesus never
[1:10:12] said to go build schools
[1:10:15] jesus said to preach the word
[1:10:18] that's what their job is
[1:10:21] that's what the commission of the church
[1:10:23] is that's what the commission of the
[1:10:25] pastor the preacher is to preach the
[1:10:28] word amen the bible didn't say to go
[1:10:31] build a school
[1:10:32] the bible didn't say to go build a
[1:10:34] hospital the bible didn't say to go
[1:10:36] build a bible school or some kind of
[1:10:38] institution it said preach the word
[1:10:42] that's the job that's the duty
[1:10:45] that's what god's given us to do now
[1:10:47] remember again brother man said there's
[1:10:49] nothing wrong with the school
[1:10:51] there's nothing wrong with the police
[1:10:53] department there's nothing
[1:11:00] left the gospel and the word in christ
[1:11:03] everything's all cattywompus and upside
[1:11:05] down amen the government's trying to
[1:11:08] take care of everything when it's not
[1:11:09] supposed to be that way and interfere in
[1:11:12] people's lives where they have no
[1:11:13] business interfere
[1:11:17] on the government and then the
[1:11:18] government dictates the way that the
[1:11:20] person is supposed to live
[1:11:24] that's that sounds like the bondage of
[1:11:26] the children of israel in egypt to me
[1:11:31] so much so that when there is israel
[1:11:33] came out of egypt they're like oh
[1:11:36] we had plenty to eat back there oh we
[1:11:39] had the flesh pots and we we had
[1:11:41] everything so good they forgot
[1:11:43] apparently that all the beating on their
[1:11:45] back had healed enough to where they
[1:11:46] forgot about it
[1:11:48] and they forgot about their gnarled up
[1:11:50] hands were so blistered and bleeding by
[1:11:52] making the pharaohs brick they forgot
[1:11:54] all about that when it all healed up
[1:11:56] they're like oh we wish we were back in
[1:11:59] egypt
[1:12:00] and that's the exact same thing happens
[1:12:02] today
[1:12:04] people the government gets in control
[1:12:07] see look friend when there's a when
[1:12:08] there was a person that needed there was
[1:12:10] a poor person it was the church's
[1:12:12] responsibility to take care of that
[1:12:15] it was the church's responsibility to
[1:12:17] help them and to feed them and to get
[1:12:20] them a job and to get them back on their
[1:12:22] feet and to get them to be a viable
[1:12:24] citizen again
[1:12:26] but the government has done nothing but
[1:12:28] created a bunch of laziness
[1:12:30] by giving everything to everybody
[1:12:33] and now people don't want to do anything
[1:12:35] anymore because they get everything for
[1:12:37] free right
[1:12:39] my wife was telling me she we had a
[1:12:41] friend that
[1:12:42] is from egypt and she's muslim and she
[1:12:45] wears a headdress and everything and
[1:12:47] she's a very sweet lady
[1:12:49] i drove her around for a while with lou
[1:12:51] my friend that would move to boston and
[1:12:54] she had cancer in her face and she's
[1:12:57] pretty deformed and all but she's just
[1:12:59] the absolute sweetest spirit to be a
[1:13:02] muslim i just she's just the sweetest
[1:13:04] lady lou went up to hug her one time
[1:13:06] because he didn't realize he went up to
[1:13:08] hug her one time and she said no no no i
[1:13:11] said no no we don't allow that you can't
[1:13:13] touch me
[1:13:14] i thought my christian could get a good
[1:13:16] lesson from my mother amen
[1:13:19] she said no no you're not supposed to
[1:13:21] touch me when i drove her around she
[1:13:23] wrote in the back
[1:13:25] and then she wrote in the back with her
[1:13:26] face covered wow right amen that that
[1:13:29] modest and that respectful and i thought
[1:13:31] my what an example
[1:13:34] we call our christians uh
[1:13:36] it's it's just a shame amen but
[1:13:40] but she told sonya this last time she
[1:13:42] was in town she comes back like every
[1:13:44] other every six months or so to get
[1:13:46] check-ups with her cancer stuff and all
[1:13:47] believe it or not we have i guess
[1:13:49] apparently some of the best cancer
[1:13:51] doctor in the world in tucson so that's
[1:13:53] why she comes here and she's doing
[1:13:56] really good by the way but
[1:13:58] she was telling my wife because she
[1:14:00] lives in egypt but she's telling her she
[1:14:03] driving around she's like wow there's
[1:14:05] homeless people there's these people all
[1:14:07] over the place what are all these people
[1:14:08] in there homeless people and my and she
[1:14:11] told my wife she says you won't see this
[1:14:13] in egypt
[1:14:14] you come over there you won't see all
[1:14:15] these homeless people and my wife said
[1:14:17] well why not she said because we don't
[1:14:19] give them anything
[1:14:20] the people who work and sacrifice and
[1:14:23] make a living don't hand out to those
[1:14:25] people so the only way they can survive
[1:14:28] is to go to work themselves right get a
[1:14:31] job become a bible citizen of their
[1:14:33] country i thought man
[1:14:35] we
[1:14:37] we're in bad shape in this country
[1:14:39] friend in more than one way amen oh
[1:14:42] and i thought that's exactly but that
[1:14:44] that's
[1:14:45] that's exactly what they want to do
[1:14:48] though
[1:14:49] that's exactly what the whole foundation
[1:14:52] of satan's eden is built on is to
[1:14:54] control you and take it all away from
[1:14:56] you so they can dictate to you what you
[1:14:58] can and cannot do
[1:15:00] it's just like i heard about china about
[1:15:02] six months ago
[1:15:04] they china went in there and said you
[1:15:05] got to do this this and this you got to
[1:15:07] put up a picture of of uh shay jay peng
[1:15:10] and you got to take down anything that
[1:15:12] has anything to do with religion or
[1:15:14] jesus or no pictures no bibles nothing
[1:15:17] of of god or religion or christianity
[1:15:19] you got to get rid of all of it or you
[1:15:21] won't get a dime from us wow
[1:15:23] and put them out and basically told them
[1:15:26] this is the way they're going to have to
[1:15:27] do and of course who's going to get a
[1:15:29] job at a communist country if you're
[1:15:31] labeled a christian
[1:15:34] amen that's when you sit at the table
[1:15:36] and you say the empty table you say
[1:15:38] thank you lord for the food that we're
[1:15:40] about to receive because you get nothing
[1:15:43] amen as bad as it is here we are still a
[1:15:45] blessed country right amen it's still a
[1:15:48] blessed country
[1:15:50] god never said go make schools god never
[1:15:52] said go make hospitals god never said go
[1:15:54] make police departments and all this
[1:15:55] other stuff that's all of satan's eating
[1:15:58] amen that's all satan's eating he said
[1:16:01] well we've got to get education yeah
[1:16:02] that's just because of the society we
[1:16:04] live in well who controls the
[1:16:07] society we live in the devil
[1:16:10] satan does
[1:16:11] that's why we have to do that but it was
[1:16:14] not so from the beginning
[1:16:16] it wasn't in god's plan
[1:16:18] god just said to the church
[1:16:21] now these others that they can go
[1:16:22] whatever they want but to the church
[1:16:25] preach the word
[1:16:27] preach the gospel amen that's where
[1:16:29] brother graham said now
[1:16:32] preach the word that's where they
[1:16:34] neglect it
[1:16:35] not make institutions hospitals so forth
[1:16:38] them is all right but that's not the
[1:16:40] church's duty their duty is to preach
[1:16:43] the gospel but we do everything else but
[1:16:46] that
[1:16:46] he said oh my
[1:16:49] help us lord amen and that's what it's
[1:16:51] got to be in a lot of places that it's
[1:16:54] not even the
[1:16:55] the gospel is not even preached anymore
[1:16:57] that's right
[1:16:58] even if there's a reference to it in a
[1:17:00] lot of ways it's nothing but
[1:17:02] watered-down idea of somebody got from
[1:17:05] some school or seminary
[1:17:07] which is a school
[1:17:11] preach the word so what does the
[1:17:12] preaching of the word do
[1:17:14] it establishes a person in the gospel
[1:17:17] not in your religion right yeah amen it
[1:17:21] establishes a person in christ and not
[1:17:24] in the word of god tabernacle
[1:17:28] i don't want you established in the word
[1:17:29] of god tabernacle
[1:17:31] i don't want to be established yet i
[1:17:33] want to be established in christ the
[1:17:35] word
[1:17:36] that's what the preaching of the gospel
[1:17:38] will do like brother branham said it'll
[1:17:41] bring that person to where their life is
[1:17:43] right
[1:17:44] just because the word's there the life
[1:17:47] is there the spirit to bring the word to
[1:17:48] life and the person then it changes that
[1:17:51] person's life
[1:17:53] amen that's what makes a difference not
[1:17:55] legalism not rules oh i've seen people
[1:17:58] not seen coming from the south front
[1:18:00] and now it's the bible belt
[1:18:03] and and all that goes with it all the
[1:18:04] tremendous right but
[1:18:06] there there there's so much
[1:18:09] legalism i'll just keep using that same
[1:18:11] word there's so much legalism
[1:18:14] there's so much uh do's and don'ts
[1:18:17] if you're
[1:18:18] if your dress is not down to here and
[1:18:21] and
[1:18:22] you know all the
[1:18:24] popping circumstances if if everything
[1:18:26] about you is not exactly right you can't
[1:18:28] even come in wow
[1:18:30] yeah that's true there's a church in
[1:18:32] town that has two pages of rules for
[1:18:34] women yes i've read them
[1:18:36] i got the copy myself with the
[1:18:39] letterhead that tells me what church it
[1:18:40] came from
[1:18:42] two pages
[1:18:44] just for the women yeah
[1:18:48] why is that preaching the gospel
[1:18:51] that's getting you a convert that's
[1:18:53] trying to convert you to that church not
[1:18:54] to jesus that's trying to convert you to
[1:18:57] that pastor that religion that they that
[1:19:00] uh
[1:19:01] pseudo religion they created in their
[1:19:03] own little environment there
[1:19:05] not to jesus
[1:19:06] christ when the gospel is preached it
[1:19:09] comes with power and manifestation and
[1:19:12] it changes lives
[1:19:14] that's when lives are changed and in
[1:19:16] that the whole point
[1:19:17] is for lives to be changed
[1:19:21] my life your life
[1:19:23] it's changed the preaching of the gospel
[1:19:26] because of the word having the
[1:19:28] preeminence
[1:19:29] in philippians chapter two i'm going to
[1:19:32] close here in just a minute philippians
[1:19:33] chapter 2 verse 12
[1:19:37] wherefore my beloved brethren as ye have
[1:19:39] always obeyed not as in my presence only
[1:19:43] but how much more in my absence look at
[1:19:46] this now
[1:19:48] let me start this over wherefore my
[1:19:50] beloved
[1:19:51] as ye have always obeyed
[1:19:54] not as in my presence only
[1:19:58] but
[1:19:59] but now much more in my
[1:20:02] absence
[1:20:04] so he didn't make them paul
[1:20:07] he made them converse to christ they
[1:20:09] became converts to christ not to paul
[1:20:12] because when paul wasn't there they were
[1:20:15] ever that much more a christian
[1:20:19] in my absence work out
[1:20:21] your own salvation with fear and
[1:20:24] trembling well now that doesn't sound
[1:20:26] like i'm supposed to tell you what to do
[1:20:28] amen just like that quote we read about
[1:20:31] brother branham is it wasn't that
[1:20:33] brother brown was supposed to tell him
[1:20:34] to do it you work out your own salvation
[1:20:38] with the holy spirit moving in your life
[1:20:40] as the word is preached
[1:20:42] that's how you get results
[1:20:45] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:20:47] and trembling
[1:20:48] for with fear and trembling now a lot of
[1:20:50] people say that working out our own
[1:20:52] salvation but sometimes they forget that
[1:20:53] fear and trembling part
[1:20:56] that's not fear and trembling of me or a
[1:20:58] pastor or a church that's fear and
[1:21:01] trembling of the of god amen amen
[1:21:04] in the presence of god for it is god
[1:21:07] which worketh in you both to do
[1:21:10] both to will and to do of his good
[1:21:13] pleasure amen amen amen
[1:21:17] praise the lord
[1:21:20] now somehow
[1:21:23] somehow i forgot to print this
[1:21:25] so i brought it up on my phone so i can
[1:21:27] read it to you here it's in broken
[1:21:29] sisters january 1965.
[1:21:34] they never had to pump it or pull it
[1:21:37] there you go
[1:21:38] amen you don't have to prime people to
[1:21:40] worship god you don't have to convince
[1:21:42] people or
[1:21:43] or get a set of pom poms or hooray
[1:21:46] hooray go go
[1:21:47] left give me an a and left give me a
[1:21:50] right give me a j and give me an e and
[1:21:52] give me an s
[1:21:53] you don't have to pump and pull people
[1:21:55] prime them and and
[1:21:58] all the emotion that goes with it amen
[1:22:01] no notice they never brother said never
[1:22:04] had your pump and pull it
[1:22:06] or they never had to ask
[1:22:09] now how do we use this water because
[1:22:11] they knowed how to use it
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:16] now he's
[1:22:18] he's typing a water spigot with the
[1:22:22] church so you understand
[1:22:25] and so as a man or woman
[1:22:27] what regardless of what creed or
[1:22:29] denomination he belongs to if he is
[1:22:32] thirsty for god he don't have to run
[1:22:35] back to the seminary like this anglian
[1:22:37] brother did or british brother last
[1:22:40] night have to go back and consult how to
[1:22:42] the
[1:22:43] how to the anglian church how he must
[1:22:46] use this great gift he has got speaking
[1:22:49] in tongues and how he must do this
[1:22:51] they would kick him out
[1:22:53] to begin with see he was thirsty
[1:22:56] so god just filled him right that's all
[1:22:59] there is to it is thirsting and then he
[1:23:02] just fills it
[1:23:04] you don't have to have any control
[1:23:08] somebody tell you what to do with it
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] you don't have to have anyone control
[1:23:15] you
[1:23:16] you don't have to have somebody tell you
[1:23:18] what to do with it
[1:23:20] god leads each individual in the way he
[1:23:24] wants you to go
[1:23:27] god does yes
[1:23:29] well if you do what i tell you you're
[1:23:31] doing what you're leaving
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:37] praise the lord we just preach the
[1:23:39] gospel
[1:23:42] he wants you to
[1:23:44] you're an individual yourself you are a
[1:23:46] part of god nobody can take your place
[1:23:48] and there's no way to have uh no way
[1:23:52] to have to go to somebody and say now
[1:23:54] i'll have to do this or i'll have to do
[1:23:57] that or i have to conform to this no sir
[1:24:00] god uses it uh
[1:24:03] the way that he wants to
[1:24:05] when you're thirsty
[1:24:07] uh you know enough to get a drink
[1:24:09] exactly
[1:24:10] amen
[1:24:12] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:24:15] that's the way god meant for it to be
[1:24:17] when you're thirsty for god
[1:24:19] when you're thirsty for god then god
[1:24:22] will fill you
[1:24:23] if you're thirsty for a church or
[1:24:25] denomination or a man or
[1:24:27] some gift then that's what you're going
[1:24:30] to get
[1:24:31] but if you thirsty for god
[1:24:33] god will fill you
[1:24:34] he promised amen
[1:24:36] he will quench that thirst he promised
[1:24:39] amen and i used the word quench a little
[1:24:42] lightly because i've been in 30 over 30
[1:24:45] years and i'm still not quenched
[1:24:47] i still want more
[1:24:49] i still want more and more and more but
[1:24:52] as that thirst gets greater the supply
[1:24:54] comes greater
[1:24:56] then it comes from him yes it comes from
[1:24:59] him it's not a word of god tabernacle
[1:25:02] convert it's a convert to christ
[1:25:04] it's not a conforming to an ideology of
[1:25:08] a certain church or or to my way or
[1:25:10] thought is to is to conform to the
[1:25:13] gospel of christ by the preaching of the
[1:25:15] word let god do the change
[1:25:19] amen one more scripture i'll close here
[1:25:22] in mark chapter 16
[1:25:24] mark 16. you know what he says
[1:25:27] most of you all of you here probably
[1:25:29] know mark 16.
[1:25:31] mark 16 14
[1:25:33] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[1:25:36] they said it means and unbraided them
[1:25:38] with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:25:40] heart because they believed not them
[1:25:42] which had seen him after he had risen
[1:25:45] and he said unto them what did he say to
[1:25:48] them
[1:25:49] go into all the world and build a school
[1:25:54] going into all the world and and feed
[1:25:56] the hungry
[1:25:59] going into all the world and and uh
[1:26:02] have a hospital
[1:26:04] medical care
[1:26:06] all those things again all those things
[1:26:08] are fine
[1:26:09] but not what the bible says right right
[1:26:12] their commission was to go into all the
[1:26:14] world and preach the gospel
[1:26:20] all the world and tell them what to do
[1:26:23] tell them how they're supposed to live
[1:26:26] no preach them the gospel
[1:26:29] tell them what the word says right amen
[1:26:32] then you don't have to worry about
[1:26:33] whether if there's there's anything
[1:26:35] there because god confirms that yes
[1:26:38] amen because it's his word right it's
[1:26:40] not my word it's not your word it's his
[1:26:43] word
[1:26:44] if it's his word he has to be the one to
[1:26:46] confirm it
[1:26:48] praise the lord he confirmed it in each
[1:26:49] of us
[1:26:51] he'll continue to do the same thing
[1:26:53] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:26:57] praise the lord every creature
[1:27:00] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:27:02] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:27:04] be damned
[1:27:05] amen that doesn't fall on us either
[1:27:09] if you preach the gospel
[1:27:11] amen he that believeth amen and these
[1:27:14] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:27:16] my name that shall cast out devils they
[1:27:19] shall speak with new tongues
[1:27:21] amen cast the devil out next door
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:25] they somebody throw a window through the
[1:27:26] walk through their window too wow
[1:27:28] anybody see that coming in i saw when i
[1:27:30] was coming in earlier today
[1:27:32] i got here about noon one o'clock
[1:27:34] something like that and somebody else
[1:27:36] thrown a rock i went and told craig big
[1:27:38] old
[1:27:39] hole right there i said i kind of got an
[1:27:41] end i told him i said i'll probably have
[1:27:43] a little inkling of who did it but
[1:27:45] that's none of my business i just wanted
[1:27:47] to let him know so we could get it fixed
[1:27:49] but anyway
[1:27:50] cast out devils amen that we've done
[1:27:53] that pretty recently here even sunday
[1:27:56] with shariah
[1:27:57] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:27:59] shall take up serpents and drink any
[1:28:01] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:28:03] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:28:06] shall recover amen praise the lord
[1:28:09] that's the gospel
[1:28:11] that's not the gospel according to
[1:28:12] william brown i love the gospel
[1:28:14] according to newton bennett that's the
[1:28:16] gospel according to christ
[1:28:19] amen amen
[1:28:22] praise the lord i'll just stop there
[1:28:26] that's our call that's our
[1:28:28] commission
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:31] and honestly
[1:28:33] i have to admit there probably have been
[1:28:36] many times in my life i've tried to tell
[1:28:38] people what to do
[1:28:40] i've tried to tell them how to do it
[1:28:42] right and then there's probably some
[1:28:44] people that have followed that
[1:28:46] i don't know
[1:28:48] but it's not my job to tell them what to
[1:28:50] do
[1:28:51] it's my job to tell them what the word
[1:28:53] says
[1:28:54] to lay the scripture to that person amen
[1:28:58] not tell them there's a difference
[1:28:59] there's a difference in the spirit
[1:29:01] there's a difference in your attitude
[1:29:04] there's a difference in the reception of
[1:29:06] it right i mean you you know when
[1:29:09] somebody's preaching and when somebody's
[1:29:10] telling you what to do or when
[1:29:12] somebody's giving you the fundamental
[1:29:14] foundation facts of the scripture and
[1:29:16] when they're telling you you've got to
[1:29:18] do this and you've got to do that and
[1:29:20] live by
[1:29:21] rules and regulations and do's and
[1:29:22] don'ts you know the difference
[1:29:25] you can tell
[1:29:26] amen we've all been to school right i
[1:29:29] was a teacher for seven years
[1:29:32] and
[1:29:32] and i can tell you now my students knew
[1:29:35] the difference when i was trying to tell
[1:29:37] them something and when i was just
[1:29:38] teaching them what the truth was what
[1:29:40] the facts of the
[1:29:42] subject was
[1:29:43] amen there's a difference
[1:29:46] preach the gospel
[1:29:48] let your life preach
[1:29:50] that the word lived through you amen
[1:29:53] if somebody has a question give them the
[1:29:55] word if you don't know the word get in
[1:29:57] the word
[1:29:59] like brother branham said get in the
[1:30:00] word know the word let the word become
[1:30:02] you so did you know what the word says
[1:30:05] not
[1:30:06] not that you you you you have to do this
[1:30:08] you know this this is what the bible
[1:30:10] says right amen i like that quote
[1:30:12] brother graham says i'm not going to
[1:30:13] tell you what to do
[1:30:15] all i'm going to do is give you the word
[1:30:18] give you the scripture
[1:30:20] and then god's obligated if you belong
[1:30:22] to him the holy spirit will come in and
[1:30:25] confirm that word to your heart and you
[1:30:28] become a christian
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:31] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:46] you know if you become
[1:30:49] if you become a convert because what i
[1:30:51] told you to do
[1:30:53] and
[1:30:55] i'm responsible for you
[1:30:58] amen
[1:30:59] i'm responsible for you if i'm the one
[1:31:02] that you're listening to if i'm the one
[1:31:04] that that convinced you and
[1:31:06] and and
[1:31:09] got you to believe my convincing
[1:31:12] argument
[1:31:13] i'm responsible for you but if you
[1:31:16] believe what the gospel says
[1:31:19] through preaching
[1:31:21] and you believe what this word says
[1:31:23] and you live the life you live because
[1:31:25] of what it taught you and what the holy
[1:31:27] spirit quickened to you then he is
[1:31:29] responsible for you
[1:31:31] not me
[1:31:33] that's why i said over five years ago
[1:31:36] now i felt that god led me to start this
[1:31:40] and that made it his church not mine
[1:31:42] amen
[1:31:44] this is not my church i
[1:31:46] uh i i know i have a lot of control over
[1:31:49] but i i do that
[1:31:51] based on what i feel led of god
[1:31:54] and i give
[1:31:56] all of us the opportunity
[1:31:59] numerous times for input and how you
[1:32:01] feel about it and what you think about a
[1:32:03] situation or how we should perceive this
[1:32:05] way and how we should proceed that way
[1:32:06] because it's not my church
[1:32:08] it's his church
[1:32:10] that we are the members of because we
[1:32:13] are the church
[1:32:15] amen
[1:32:16] i
[1:32:17] i don't mean that to sound like it
[1:32:19] shirks my responsibility or ours
[1:32:22] it doesn't shirk any of our
[1:32:24] responsibilities as part of this church
[1:32:27] but it's his church that's the bottom
[1:32:29] line
[1:32:30] amen this church is his
[1:32:32] any work he starts he's obligated to
[1:32:36] amen that
[1:32:38] that's uh uh i mean
[1:32:41] i that's the part i love
[1:32:43] amen because it's i just a part of him a
[1:32:46] part of that work
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:49] and to
[1:32:50] to live it and to be it as he would have
[1:32:52] us to do amen
[1:32:56] praise the lord jesus
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:04] you ever get a
[1:33:06] verse of a song and you don't know what

[1:37:46] to uh craig the
[1:37:49] the landlord the owner of the place and
[1:37:52] asked him if we could
[1:37:53] try to procure a little building a
[1:37:56] little space maybe about twice the size
[1:37:58] of the part that we got in the front
[1:38:00] here to have a little meal um i'm
[1:38:03] thinking i was thinking in a couple
[1:38:05] weeks but i started he asked me when i

[1:38:11] re do some research
[1:38:13] i almost said well if you clean that
[1:38:14] junk out next door that'd be perfect but
[1:38:16] i didn't tell them
[1:38:18] but um
[1:38:20] i think it may be between thanksgiving
[1:38:21] and and christmas
[1:38:23] if that would work maybe this
[1:38:27] uh the 5th of december or the 12th of
[1:38:30] december or something like that on a
[1:38:32] sunday if it didn't work on a sunday we
[1:38:34] could try a saturday or something
[1:38:35] because
[1:38:36] my wife has raised the the concern of
[1:38:39] maybe or to keep food cool or
[1:38:42] things like that if we if we make it to
[1:38:44] where we do it on a saturday or
[1:38:46] something there's no worry of that you
[1:38:47] just come and that's we cover the
[1:38:49] purpose of bringing the food and then we
[1:38:51] eat fellowship and
[1:38:52] when and then go home so

[1:39:11] that'd be fine he'd just have to find a
[1:39:13] place see what a date would be
[1:39:14] and we'll go from there so
