[32:10] anyone else have a
[32:11] uh her blessing yes really guys yes uh
[32:14] first of all
[32:15] um as i mentioned this past week my wife
[32:19] had her visit with oncologists and we
[32:22] thanked the lord
[32:23] uh it wasn't cancer thank god
[32:28] but for a couple of weeks she's had very
[32:32] bad discomfort and pain in her left
[32:35] shoulder
[32:36] and um she had called er this morning
[32:40] they couldn't take her till tomorrow
[32:41] afternoon
[32:43] so um she called uh the doctor that she
[32:46] worked for he
[32:47] prescribed something he thinks it's a
[32:49] pinched nerve
[32:50] but i i don't need to know you don't
[32:52] need to know what it is because god
[32:54] knows him and he's going to deliver
[32:56] amen yes so we'll keep brother dennis's
[32:58] wife in prayer as well this morning
[33:01] uh does anyone else have a spoken prayer
[33:03] request yesterday yes
[33:04] when um my wife just texted me a little
[33:06] while ago and she said that
[33:08] if you get a prayer for our landlord um
[33:10] you got in contact with someone cobid
[33:13] so he's really worried because he can't
[33:15] look forward to
[33:16] not miss work so if you just keep him in
[33:19] prayer
[33:19] yeah sure let's all stand this morning
[33:24] just if you want to lift up your hand if
[33:26] you have unspoken prayer requests
[33:28] and i'll just ask brother dennis if you
[33:29] would pray over these needs this morning
[33:32] lord jesus we bow our hearts and heads
[33:35] together by
[33:36] faith knowing that you're a true and
[33:39] living god
[33:40] lord jesus you are comfort our strength
[33:43] our healer
[33:44] our redeemer our our shelter in the time
[33:47] of storm
[33:48] our joy our happiness you are everything
[33:51] to us father
[33:52] i'm i'm just scratching the surface of
[33:55] what you
[33:56] mean to us father and lord i can recall
[33:59] as i read even this morning
[34:01] there was a lady that had a
[34:04] a daughter it was a vex with the devil
[34:07] and she
[34:08] persistently came to you even the
[34:10] disciples tried to
[34:12] draw her away from from you father but
[34:15] you saw the faith that she had
[34:19] and that lord she knew that you were the
[34:22] only one that could deliver
[34:23] her daughter and father there are many
[34:26] today
[34:27] that are sick even with that covenant 19
[34:31] we know as you told the prophet of our
[34:34] day
[34:34] then if you pray and believe in faith
[34:38] not even cancer will stand in the way
[34:41] and not even covet will stand in the way
[34:44] for thou art our high priests that can
[34:47] be
[34:48] touched by the feelings of our
[34:49] infirmities and by your stripes
[34:52] we are healed and father we believe
[34:56] whatever each one in each request
[34:59] has been read and needs a healing touch
[35:02] may we be like that lady
[35:04] persistent and believe that once we ask
[35:07] it is a finished work you painted it
[35:10] full
[35:10] at calvary father and lord we believe
[35:14] that when you said it is done it is
[35:16] finished
[35:17] that is a complete work for all that we
[35:20] have need of
[35:21] and lord may you touch or
[35:24] people today that's made an effort to be
[35:27] here
[35:28] maybe someone that hasn't surrendered
[35:31] their life to you
[35:32] this world is dying this world's falling
[35:36] apart
[35:37] and you're the only safe place you're
[35:40] the only
[35:40] healer you're the only redeemer you're
[35:44] the only
[35:44] savior speak through their hearts may
[35:47] it's not a
[35:48] time to just take our walk with you
[35:51] lightly father it's a time to surrender
[35:55] that your life may fully express itself
[35:58] in us father all lord bless each and
[36:02] every one the unspoken prayer request
[36:04] their hearts were lifted up to you may
[36:06] you just
[36:07] grant him exceedingly abundantly more so
[36:10] we know
[36:11] what we can ever expect to receive
[36:13] father
[36:14] o lord bless our pastor as he brings
[36:17] forth the word
[36:18] lord as he labors firmly may you use
[36:22] them to speak to our hearts
[36:23] may our hearts be open may our hearts be
[36:27] softened
[36:28] to receive your word this day
[36:31] knowing that uh with faith cometh by
[36:34] hearing
[36:35] and hearing of the word of god and lord
[36:38] you gave
[36:38] a prophet a promise that
[36:41] a rapturing faith lies in those tapes
[36:46] and lord our brother stands for your
[36:49] word
[36:50] stands for the truth may we stand with
[36:53] them father
[36:54] may we just i'll always have that
[36:57] wedding garment on
[36:58] granted lord bless each one lord we
[37:01] may our hearts burn within us as we know
[37:05] we've met with you along the way this
[37:08] time

[37:41] uh and my car he was trying to put the
[37:43] header back on

[38:00] over i try to cut it
[38:01] or try to fit again nope not fitting
[38:04] he was frustrated about to cry and he
[38:06] prayed to jesus to help him
[38:08] and the header just dropped into place
[38:10] all by itself so
[38:12] with all the necessary clearances and

[50:22] the lord jesus
[50:24] he's so good to
[50:33] you know as zach said
[50:38] you know we're entering into another
[50:40] time of
[50:41] celebration of what this country
[50:43] considers a thanksgiving
[50:45] there's other countries that have
[50:46] thanksgivings but um
[50:50] they of course have different times
[50:51] different seasons
[50:54] this is the time and season that we
[50:56] celebrate it
[50:58] there's a lot of history that's involved
[51:00] in it but you know thanksgiving is the
[51:01] only
[51:02] american holiday the only true really
[51:05] american holiday that we have
[51:07] most the other holidays or from overseas
[51:09] and paganism things like that
[51:11] but this is the one holiday that is a
[51:13] true real
[51:15] uh thanksgiving that we have and of
[51:19] course
[51:19] thanksgiving simply means to give thanks
[51:23] and uh brother zach without any
[51:26] direction for me or anybody he's just
[51:28] being led of the lord singing the songs
[51:30] of thanksgiving to the lord today
[51:32] amen amen and as i have and usually do
[51:36] because
[51:37] because of what i consider uh the
[51:40] importance of this time
[51:42] uh to uh to reflect upon the
[51:44] thanksgivings that we have to the lord
[51:46] jesus
[51:47] so in that in retrospect of that or in
[51:50] in
[51:51] and that being said
[51:54] uh i usually try to take a thanksgiving
[51:57] service
[51:57] and that's going to be today so i want
[52:01] to do a thanksgiving message today but
[52:03] as i do a thanksgiving message
[52:05] i i usually before i start i like to
[52:09] open the floor
[52:10] i know zach gave everybody the
[52:12] opportunity to give a testimony today or
[52:14] to give a praise report or whatever amen
[52:17] and
[52:18] if you'd like to do that right now i
[52:20] want to open the floor and encourage you
[52:22] if there's something on your heart or
[52:24] something that you'd like to say to
[52:25] public
[52:26] uh of what god's done for you this week
[52:29] this month this year in thanksgiving to
[52:33] him
[52:34] uh i give you the opportunity to open
[52:36] the floor if you'd like to give a
[52:37] testimony to the lord right now
[52:39] feel free to you're not obligated to
[52:41] don't feel pressured to
[52:43] but if it's something that's on your
[52:44] heart that you want to save for the lord
[52:46] now is the opportunity to do so i
[52:48] usually spend an
[52:49] hour plus up here every service and i
[52:52] usually pour out my heart to you and
[52:54] uh but now is your opportunity so you
[52:58] want to pull your heart out before us to
[53:00] the lord
[53:00] then then now's the time so brother
[53:03] angel
[53:03] start us off brother
[53:07] last week the lord
[53:11] sitting there talking to me
[53:15] i uh thought to even lie about
[53:18] giving thanks and helping my son with
[53:22] his house and
[53:24] trying to prepare a home
[53:27] i thank god for giving me the strength
[53:29] to help him
[53:31] and then for some reason i injured my
[53:34] leg i broke
[53:35] my bone in two places
[53:38] i couldn't be no help from
[53:42] and i felt bad about it so
[53:45] i took them a meal took at this house
[53:49] and i asked him apologize for my
[53:53] my incident and i sit there thinking
[53:56] about
[53:57] thanksgiving came into my heart i said
[54:00] lord
[54:05] let this thanksgiving be different
[54:10] let my shepherd speak to me about giving
[54:13] thanks
[54:15] please send on his heart lord to teach
[54:18] us
[54:18] what real thanksgiving is about what
[54:21] thanksgiving is to you lord to each and
[54:23] every
[54:24] one of us last night i went to bed and
[54:27] i couldn't sleep so i sat through my
[54:29] lounge chair
[54:31] i asked the lord this morning put it on
[54:35] your servant's heart lord to speak to us
[54:38] on this subject
[54:40] and i didn't think much about it i just
[54:42] left my heart there
[54:44] so this morning i come and
[54:48] i just i felt a strong
[54:52] anointing dude amen
[54:55] and then lord you open the service with
[54:58] thanksgiving songs and all your prop
[55:01] your servant here our shepherd he's
[55:04] brought the subject forth so i don't
[55:08] know what else to thank him for except
[55:12] i'm praying he brought tips amen not
[55:15] just for today lord that you remind us
[55:18] to be grateful for not just the good
[55:21] things he brings in our lives yes
[55:23] amen but even the tragedies you know
[55:27] even death itself because everything
[55:30] gives us we should be thankful for
[55:33] including dying
[55:34] yes brother because once we pass on it
[55:38] we could be more thankful to get home
[55:41] yes
[55:41] well this journey is long and scary
[55:45] and it's it's hatred towards us just
[55:48] cuts us all like a knife and if it
[55:50] wasn't for you lord
[55:51] placing on our hearts that thanksgiving
[55:54] oh lord i don't know where we'd end but
[55:57] we'd be hopeless
[55:59] that's thank you it's kind of
[56:00] long-winded of me but
[56:02] thank you brother i'm just that way i
[56:06] i want to thank god for all of you
[56:08] especially this morning
[56:10] i wish we could all sit together on a
[56:12] thanksgiving day and just
[56:14] sing songs of praises and amen and feast
[56:16] on the glory that god gives us
[56:19] so strong that he defeat his
[56:23] that it would last all year long amen
[56:26] praise the lord just make us drunk on
[56:28] your spirit father is what i ask
[56:31] let me stagger around i don't care about
[56:33] anything else i'm just thankful that you

[1:15:34] here unless you put a lot of money and a
[1:15:35] lot of
[1:15:36] change into this building so the lord's
[1:15:38] got something else for us
[1:15:40] and amen we'll just move forward with
[1:15:42] that me and brother rogers already been
[1:15:44] talking about that
[1:15:45] and whatever the lord's will might be
[1:15:47] but i'm very thankful i sit back there

[1:15:50] uh the columns look real nice brother
[1:15:51] roger came and put

[1:16:00] of the lord till you take us home then
[1:16:02] that's fine too but whatever the will of

[1:16:11] uh the lord's blessed it he's blessed
[1:16:13] you he's blessed us together and of
[1:16:15] course
[1:16:16] it's been a part of my testimony and you
[1:16:18] know when i
[1:16:19] get to that part you know usually when
[1:16:22] you get to the end of the year
[1:16:23] and and if you allow me for a moment i'm
[1:16:26] kind of starting into my message so
[1:16:28] um but when you reflect on that a lot of
[1:16:31] times you get to the end of the year
[1:16:33] and you get to the end of the year and
[1:16:34] you reflect on the year before and
[1:16:36] people make
[1:16:37] new year's resolutions and all those
[1:16:39] things but
[1:16:40] you know we have a time and a season
[1:16:42] again uh
[1:16:44] as zach said and others have said every
[1:16:46] day that we live should be a
[1:16:47] thanksgiving to the lord
[1:16:49] amen it is a thanksgiving to the lord
[1:16:51] and
[1:16:52] um and we're very thankful that the lord
[1:16:54] does so we thank him all the time
[1:16:56] um and and what he does for us and
[1:17:00] how he blesses us but it comes this time
[1:17:04] like you know a mother's day or a
[1:17:06] father's day you love your mother
[1:17:08] 365 days a year but you know there's
[1:17:10] that one day and the restaurants fill up
[1:17:13] and the the flower shops empty out and
[1:17:16] stuff like that
[1:17:17] because you take that time to
[1:17:19] acknowledge that
[1:17:21] uh every day is a mother's day but you
[1:17:23] take that day to really put forth an
[1:17:25] acknowledgement and we take this time
[1:17:27] to really put forth that acknowledgement
[1:17:29] knowing
[1:17:30] that this country was founded on
[1:17:32] christian godly principles
[1:17:34] among it was built it was built and
[1:17:37] founded upon the bible
[1:17:39] and godly principles and freedom of
[1:17:42] religion and freedom of worship
[1:17:44] and to allow people the ability and
[1:17:46] without threat of life or imprisonment
[1:17:49] to
[1:17:49] open this bible and to read it and to
[1:17:51] talk about jesus and
[1:17:53] to have a picture of jesus hanging in
[1:17:55] your home or in your church and
[1:17:57] have actually uh buildings that are
[1:17:59] designated as
[1:18:00] churches that are even tax free now that
[1:18:03] may go away one day but
[1:18:04] are still to this day the place that we
[1:18:07] live
[1:18:08] well that began in in the beginning and
[1:18:10] of course the the pilgrims that came
[1:18:13] over and
[1:18:14] 1621 they say was the first was the
[1:18:17] first thanksgiving
[1:18:18] because they had their harvest and that
[1:18:21] yearly harvest and all that god had done
[1:18:23] for them and bringing them from
[1:18:24] here and keeping them safe and bringing
[1:18:26] them to this other place and
[1:18:27] and no doubt as brother angel said
[1:18:30] tragedy
[1:18:30] followed a lot of their lives in a lot
[1:18:32] of their journey
[1:18:34] but god still was faithful and blessed
[1:18:36] them
[1:18:37] and gave them bountifully uh
[1:18:40] their their harvest that they had and
[1:18:42] they took that bountiful harvest that
[1:18:44] god had blessed and they
[1:18:45] and they offered that back to god you
[1:18:47] know that's kind of a part of
[1:18:49] the thing that that god we talk about
[1:18:51] with tithing and offering we we give
[1:18:53] that back to god
[1:18:54] it's a wave offering it's something that
[1:18:56] we offer back to the lord and say
[1:18:58] thank you god for blessing me so much
[1:19:01] thank you god for giving to me
[1:19:03] thank you for what you've done for us
[1:19:05] this whole time and
[1:19:07] they had the native americans and the
[1:19:09] pilgrims that were there and they
[1:19:10] celebrated
[1:19:11] integrated and they they celebrated
[1:19:13] their newfound freedoms and their
[1:19:16] bountiful harvest and and the blessings
[1:19:18] that god had given
[1:19:19] and that's the foundation now after that
[1:19:23] there was um washington celebrated it
[1:19:27] and then
[1:19:27] you got to like different presidents and
[1:19:30] they didn't really celebrate it
[1:19:32] until abraham lincoln came along and
[1:19:34] it's amazing how many
[1:19:36] people in this country like abraham
[1:19:38] lincoln and is there
[1:19:40] and is their favorite president ever uh
[1:19:43] people that maybe don't even know god or
[1:19:44] don't worship god or don't serve god but
[1:19:47] recognize and give acknowledgement to a
[1:19:50] man
[1:19:51] like abraham lincoln who was a godly man
[1:19:54] who didn't even have a book to read
[1:19:56] as a child except fox book of martyrs in
[1:19:58] the bible
[1:20:00] that was his influence and that man who
[1:20:03] became
[1:20:04] the greatest president probably in the
[1:20:05] history of this country
[1:20:07] was a godly man that people look up to
[1:20:10] and recognizing that the characteristics
[1:20:13] and and
[1:20:14] what he was molded in as a child and the
[1:20:16] man that he become and the president he
[1:20:18] become
[1:20:19] put thanksgiving as a national holiday
[1:20:23] and ever since abraham lincoln it's been
[1:20:26] celebrated
[1:20:27] the third thurs or the last thursday of
[1:20:29] every of every november
[1:20:32] thanksgiving as a permanent
[1:20:35] uh
[1:20:39] holiday as a permanent sign
[1:20:42] that this country and what it was
[1:20:45] founded on
[1:20:46] wants to take just a moment and thank
[1:20:49] god
[1:20:50] for all that he's done for us families
[1:20:52] come together
[1:20:53] we cook food we get fat and all that
[1:20:56] goes with thanksgiving
[1:20:58] but thanksgiving is really the giving of
[1:21:01] thanks
[1:21:01] and the giving of thanks is giving of
[1:21:04] thanks to our maker
[1:21:05] to our lord to our savior to our god
[1:21:08] that's what thanksgiving is all about
[1:21:10] and that's where thanksgiving come from
[1:21:12] i believe and i'm going to take this uh
[1:21:15] time next for the 30 minutes or so
[1:21:17] and because i built this message around
[1:21:21] you know the that we were going to open
[1:21:23] the floor for testimonies and
[1:21:25] uh make it available for everybody to
[1:21:28] give their testimonies and
[1:21:29] your little sermons they were a blessing
[1:21:31] to me and i appreciate your testimonies
[1:21:34] and appreciate what you
[1:21:35] said for the lord and i believe he does
[1:21:37] too but just give public
[1:21:39] acknowledgement so now i want to take
[1:21:42] uh take this title that i want to title
[1:21:45] this
[1:21:46] and title it take an account so
[1:21:49] at the end of the year we kind of take
[1:21:51] account of the year before
[1:21:53] but to me being a christian
[1:21:56] and a thanksgiving to the lord jesus
[1:22:00] this is the take account time for me
[1:22:02] because this is the time
[1:22:03] of thanksgiving to the lord so this is
[1:22:06] just simply titled take an account
[1:22:08] and what i mean is taking an account
[1:22:11] just as your testimonies were
[1:22:13] back of everything that god has done for
[1:22:16] us and everything how god has blessed us
[1:22:18] of course through our lives
[1:22:21] but through this year it's a yearly
[1:22:23] thing but through this year and thinking
[1:22:25] back
[1:22:26] of how god has blessed us we've taken
[1:22:29] two services basically the last two
[1:22:31] sundays and
[1:22:32] and delved into that to some degree uh
[1:22:35] how god has kept us how god has
[1:22:37] protected us
[1:22:39] how god has watched over and and blessed
[1:22:41] our
[1:22:42] church bless this building bless our
[1:22:44] congregation bless each one of you
[1:22:46] and those that are coming still come and
[1:22:48] and i
[1:22:49] will testify and believe to you that as
[1:22:52] i pray every morning that god is going
[1:22:54] to continue to increase it
[1:22:56] as as he would but only according to his
[1:22:58] will right yes amen
[1:23:00] i i i'm not looking for a you know
[1:23:03] thousand member church or something but
[1:23:05] whatever god wants
[1:23:06] whoever god wants and his perfect will
[1:23:09] is
[1:23:10] that's our desire amen so that's that's
[1:23:13] my heart

[1:23:32] words to say
[1:23:34] to express what's in my heart of how i
[1:23:36] feel about you

[1:23:39] seem to cut it sometimes
[1:23:41] right you know we thank him all the time
[1:23:43] and we say the words thank you but
[1:23:45] sometimes thank you just doesn't feel
[1:23:47] like enough
[1:23:48] it just doesn't express what's in your
[1:23:51] heart what you're feeling deep inside
[1:23:54] is way more than just thank you lord or
[1:23:56] thanks god
[1:23:58] i appreciate it or something like that
[1:23:59] your heart just

[1:24:17] blessed us and uh we're together again
[1:24:20] and worshiping and praising the lord so
[1:24:23] i want to turn into a scripture now
[1:24:24] in job chapter one and
[1:24:28] it's outstanding to me
[1:24:33] that brother angel jr
[1:24:36] um said what he said about the year
[1:24:40] and about the thanksgivings that we have
[1:24:42] towards god because that's exactly
[1:24:44] the scripture i'm going to read exactly
[1:24:47] the scripture job chapter one

[1:27:16] to you from it and we give you the
[1:27:18] thanks and the praise for all that is
[1:27:20] said and done in the name of the lord
[1:27:21] jesus christ we pray
[1:27:23] amen in job chapter 1
[1:27:29] verse 20.
[1:27:32] then job arose rent his mantle and
[1:27:34] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[1:27:37] ground
[1:27:37] and worshiped and said naked came i
[1:27:41] out of my mother's womb and naked shall
[1:27:43] i return to the lord gave
[1:27:46] and the lord hath taken away blessed be
[1:27:49] the name of the lord
[1:27:50] amen in all this job sin not nor charged
[1:27:53] god
[1:27:54] foolishly you could be seated if you
[1:27:56] like
[1:27:58] try not to be too long but again uh
[1:28:00] something that came on my heart to give
[1:28:02] to you today
[1:28:03] and in retrospect and of course in in
[1:28:06] respect of what brother angel had said
[1:28:08] to
[1:28:09] about taking account of of the things
[1:28:12] that we look at and we say that we
[1:28:13] continue
[1:28:14] consider maybe a catastrophe or
[1:28:16] something that was an obstacle or
[1:28:18] or maybe even a death but god
[1:28:21] as he does make sure that we look at
[1:28:24] and see the the picture that god is
[1:28:27] painting for us
[1:28:28] and not just a tunnel vision of one
[1:28:30] event
[1:28:31] because god lets all these things happen
[1:28:33] and of course they all happen together
[1:28:35] for our good
[1:28:36] and our good to do our part for him
[1:28:39] so it's the good and the bad because job
[1:28:42] is sitting here
[1:28:43] and job is in the middle and you all
[1:28:44] know the story there's four messengers
[1:28:47] that had just come to job
[1:28:49] basically informing job that he had lost
[1:28:51] everything he had except his wife and a
[1:28:53] couple servants
[1:28:54] right everything animals are gone
[1:28:56] children are gone building's gone most
[1:28:58] of the servants gone
[1:28:59] we're all gone in in the space of a half
[1:29:02] hour
[1:29:02] or less that's right we don't know but
[1:29:05] we do know that as one servant came and
[1:29:07] told him
[1:29:08] you've lost all this before that servant
[1:29:10] could finish what he was saying
[1:29:12] the next servant came and said you've
[1:29:14] lost all this and before
[1:29:16] that servant could finish talking the
[1:29:18] next servant came
[1:29:20] four of them just like that one after
[1:29:22] the other job had lost everything
[1:29:24] and yet job in the middle of all that
[1:29:26] fell down
[1:29:27] to the ground uh well he says he rose
[1:29:30] rent his man shaved his head then fell
[1:29:33] down
[1:29:33] upon the ground and he worshipped he
[1:29:37] worshipped god
[1:29:38] he gave god praise he thanked god he
[1:29:41] said god
[1:29:42] you gave that to me you gave that child
[1:29:44] to me you gave that animal to me you
[1:29:46] gave that building to me you gave
[1:29:48] all this all these blessings you gave it
[1:29:50] to me lord
[1:29:52] so what you give to me belongs to you
[1:29:54] amen i'm just a steward of what god's
[1:29:57] doing in this life not just to steward
[1:30:00] i'm just trying to take care of it
[1:30:02] for him because it all belongs to him
[1:30:04] you know
[1:30:05] you you know me i don't i don't talk
[1:30:07] about money but you know it
[1:30:09] it comes to the point that scripturally
[1:30:11] it's true
[1:30:12] we are just stewards financially
[1:30:15] monetarily
[1:30:16] spiritually we are stewards of what
[1:30:19] belongs to god amen
[1:30:20] it's not ours to begin with god asks 10
[1:30:24] to come back that there's food in his
[1:30:25] house but it all belongs to him
[1:30:29] colonel sanders gave 90 but it all
[1:30:32] belongs to him
[1:30:33] so everything we've got is his we're
[1:30:34] just stewards of it so
[1:30:36] job recognizing this says god you gave
[1:30:38] it all to me it all belongs to you
[1:30:41] blessed be the name of the lord amen he
[1:30:44] bowed down and he worshiped
[1:30:46] he thanked god he didn't just thank god
[1:30:49] as angel said he didn't just thank god
[1:30:52] for all the
[1:30:53] uh uplifting blessing things that we
[1:30:56] consider blessings
[1:30:57] of the monetary and the but he thanked
[1:31:00] god
[1:31:00] for the things that happened that god
[1:31:03] took from him
[1:31:04] amen you gave and you took away praise
[1:31:07] you lord follow me god bless you
[1:31:09] thank you lord i love you lord jesus see
[1:31:12] and so it wasn't just what god gave he
[1:31:15] thanked god for what god took away
[1:31:17] there's a reason why god does that
[1:31:20] there's a reason why god does everything
[1:31:21] that he does if we trust him and believe
[1:31:23] it
[1:31:23] there's a reason why he does everything
[1:31:25] that he does for us that's why
[1:31:27] job worshipped god he give thanks to god
[1:31:30] and all this he didn't charge god
[1:31:32] foolishly
[1:31:33] because he knew that where he stood god
[1:31:36] was taking care of that for him
[1:31:38] right now every day as we said should be
[1:31:40] a thanksgiving to the lord but there's
[1:31:42] obviously this time that
[1:31:44] we have that's been set aside that we
[1:31:46] tank account and even as you mull over
[1:31:48] the testimonies you gave and you think
[1:31:50] about them and
[1:31:51] how powerful they were and you know and
[1:31:53] i may know some of the inner workings of
[1:31:55] some of them
[1:31:56] and and i know how even more
[1:31:59] supernatural some of these testimonies
[1:32:01] are than maybe some of you might know
[1:32:03] some of you might not realize how
[1:32:05] powerfully supernatural
[1:32:07] some of the testimonies we heard here
[1:32:08] today are right if not all of them i
[1:32:10] don't say some all of them are
[1:32:12] just because of how god is working and
[1:32:15] making everything work together see so
[1:32:18] those things that i know of but even in
[1:32:20] your mind now taking account of the
[1:32:22] things that god has done for us
[1:32:24] right where he's brought us how he's
[1:32:26] protected us how he's kept us
[1:32:28] i hear over and over and over again
[1:32:31] when you listen to people talking or you
[1:32:33] see a newspaper
[1:32:35] or news or something and people are
[1:32:38] saying
[1:32:38] can't this year just be over friend i'll
[1:32:41] never wish away my life
[1:32:43] amen when i was a kid i always talked
[1:32:46] about wanting to be older my dad said
[1:32:48] don't you ever wish away your life
[1:32:50] and that stuck with me and i've made
[1:32:52] that a principle of my life my whole
[1:32:54] life
[1:32:55] you might be in the middle of the
[1:32:56] darkest time of your life but don't ever
[1:32:58] wish your life away
[1:32:59] life is precious to god and for
[1:33:02] us to want to wish away that life is
[1:33:05] contrary to what god gave it to you god
[1:33:09] gave it to us to serve him with and to
[1:33:11] worship him with and
[1:33:12] and to do everything that we have in our
[1:33:14] strength to to obey him and be led by
[1:33:17] his spirit
[1:33:18] every moment every second of every day
[1:33:21] that god give us and people are out
[1:33:23] there saying
[1:33:23] oh this has been a horrible year friend
[1:33:25] this has been a wonderful year
[1:33:28] this has been a great year god has
[1:33:31] blessed
[1:33:31] us so much amen we can see
[1:33:35] the can i say the proverbial light at
[1:33:37] the end of the tunnel i
[1:33:38] i i believe we can anyway right and we
[1:33:40] can see all the things it's shaping up
[1:33:42] and all the things that's going on
[1:33:43] around us
[1:33:44] i turned off the camera the first
[1:33:46] service that we had back together at the
[1:33:48] whole at the holiday inn i turned the
[1:33:49] cameras off
[1:33:50] and i told you exactly what god told me
[1:33:52] when i was praying the other more that
[1:33:54] morning before it's been six eight
[1:33:55] months ago
[1:33:56] maybe not six maybe six months ago the
[1:33:59] first service we had back at the holiday
[1:34:01] i might turn the camera off i told you
[1:34:02] because because the lord warned me not
[1:34:04] to put it on camera
[1:34:05] i didn't do it but if you remember that
[1:34:08] and you remember what i said
[1:34:10] it didn't come from me i was just the
[1:34:12] messenger uh
[1:34:14] every bit of it's coming to pass every
[1:34:16] bit of is exactly what he said
[1:34:18] and exactly what's taking place now and
[1:34:21] you see it happening
[1:34:22] it's all unfolding and it's it's
[1:34:25] just the point of of us in retrospect
[1:34:29] and looking back
[1:34:30] and taking account uh of how god's been
[1:34:33] good to us
[1:34:34] and how of how god has blessed us so
[1:34:37] much
[1:34:38] you know god is blessed and and kept
[1:34:41] each one of us
[1:34:42] in his own uh uh will and its own
[1:34:45] pleasure
[1:34:46] and it's that time that it's that
[1:34:49] reflection
[1:34:50] of of why thanksgiving started
[1:34:55] and thanking god for the harvest and the
[1:34:57] bountiful harvest that he had given them
[1:35:01] that they took that moment of
[1:35:03] thanksgiving
[1:35:05] and they looked back at everything that
[1:35:07] god had done
[1:35:08] again through some of the hardships
[1:35:10] through some of the deaths through some
[1:35:12] of the struggles
[1:35:13] but yet god's still blessed and kept and
[1:35:15] watched over and protected
[1:35:17] amen oh and he does to his own
[1:35:20] he always does that's that reflection
[1:35:23] that's why i actually got this title to
[1:35:25] take account
[1:35:26] to look back and reflect and thank god
[1:35:29] you've been so good to us
[1:35:31] there's a couple of points of this
[1:35:32] worship of this thanksgiving
[1:35:35] of this praising the lord that we've
[1:35:37] done this morning
[1:35:38] that that i want to look into now in
[1:35:41] deuteronomy chapter 16
[1:35:43] verse 10 i've got a few scriptures i
[1:35:45] want to read but i won't
[1:35:47] uh elaborate on them greatly but
[1:35:50] deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 10.
[1:35:54] now we're talking about the feast days
[1:35:56] and the passovers and the
[1:35:58] uh and the the feast days
[1:36:02] but just this one simple verse
[1:36:05] deuteronomy 16
[1:36:06] 10 thou shalt keep the feast
[1:36:09] of the weeks unto the lord thy god with
[1:36:12] a tribute
[1:36:14] of a free will offering at thine hand
[1:36:17] okay so it's coming from your hand
[1:36:20] amen you worked to obtain it through the
[1:36:23] blessings of god of course but that's
[1:36:25] that's the acknowledgement
[1:36:27] of course right that we have we
[1:36:28] acknowledge god
[1:36:30] even though we worked for it it came
[1:36:32] from god
[1:36:33] amen there's nothing we could do with it
[1:36:35] if it had been for god
[1:36:37] you know brother dennis is talking about
[1:36:38] uh you know his back and
[1:36:41] um somebody mentioned their arm
[1:36:44] who who was it that said something about
[1:36:46] having trouble with their arm
[1:36:49] um was it leah's shoulder
[1:36:54] was it that's right it was leah's that's
[1:36:56] right because i've been having the same
[1:36:57] issue
[1:36:58] in this shoulder here and friday
[1:37:00] afternoon i come home and my back was
[1:37:02] hurting so bad every once in a while my
[1:37:04] back will flare up like that me and
[1:37:05] brother roger work
[1:37:06] pretty hard this week job we do is it's
[1:37:09] it's pretty physical job and
[1:37:12] i was up in an attic for about four
[1:37:14] hours been over
[1:37:15] and walking around raptors it's a
[1:37:18] physical job anyway
[1:37:19] and friday afternoon when we were
[1:37:21] finishing up
[1:37:23] my back got to hurting and i really
[1:37:25] didn't do anything after that
[1:37:27] set in the chair and try to stretch it
[1:37:29] and things like that
[1:37:31] but when when that thing happened it
[1:37:34] made me think but
[1:37:35] but but god blessed to be able to to do
[1:37:38] to do what we do and to do what needed
[1:37:41] to be done
[1:37:42] and god bless it to that point and you
[1:37:44] see that that
[1:37:45] this is that tribute what what
[1:37:48] this feast that god is asking of
[1:37:52] is the acknowledgement that we have to
[1:37:54] him for what he's done for us
[1:37:56] amen because it says the feast of the
[1:37:58] weeks unto the lord thy god with a
[1:38:00] tribute amen and i'm
[1:38:03] i'm going to say that's what we're doing
[1:38:04] here today is the
[1:38:06] tribute that we gave your testimonies uh
[1:38:09] the reading of the word the message
[1:38:10] this is all tribute to the lord jesus
[1:38:14] of a free will offering of thine hand so
[1:38:17] you give it but you give it of your own
[1:38:19] free will
[1:38:20] amen that's what god wants that's what
[1:38:23] god
[1:38:23] looks to god doesn't want to make you or
[1:38:25] force you
[1:38:26] to do anything right amen god's not
[1:38:29] gonna force your hand god's got
[1:38:30] not gonna make you do anything i mean
[1:38:34] one reason and i'll get back to this but
[1:38:37] one the biggest reason that we just have
[1:38:39] a box in the church
[1:38:41] is because that's what the bible says
[1:38:43] that's the number one
[1:38:45] because that's the bible says there's a
[1:38:47] box in the church that's what it says in
[1:38:49] the in the scripture
[1:38:50] that's what brother brown said brother
[1:38:52] brown said at one point it didn't work
[1:38:54] so they passed the plate it has the
[1:38:56] plate people
[1:38:58] feel a little uh funny about passing and
[1:39:01] not putting something
[1:39:02] that that's not what it's about to me
[1:39:04] right that's not what
[1:39:05] to me what it means is this free will
[1:39:08] offering
[1:39:09] and that free will offering that's a
[1:39:12] monetary example
[1:39:13] of a spiritual event the spiritual event
[1:39:16] that takes place is
[1:39:18] that you're giving thanks to god for his
[1:39:20] blessings to you
[1:39:21] you're giving thanks and worshiping god
[1:39:23] of your own free will
[1:39:25] yes it came from the work of your hand
[1:39:27] yeah your arm might hurt your back might
[1:39:29] hurt
[1:39:30] but it come from your from your own free
[1:39:32] will that you give
[1:39:33] unto the lord that you bless the lord
[1:39:36] with what god has blessed you with
[1:39:38] and you do it from your heart not
[1:39:40] because you have to
[1:39:41] not because you're obligated to not
[1:39:44] because you're begrudging to
[1:39:46] not because a plate was passed in front
[1:39:48] of you or
[1:39:49] or because somebody forced you to stand
[1:39:51] up and say something no
[1:39:53] no it's your own free will amen
[1:39:56] we're free moral agents and god wants
[1:39:58] this offering to be something of a free
[1:40:00] will of our own desire
[1:40:03] of our hearts desire and love for the
[1:40:05] lord that's where he wants our service
[1:40:07] to come from
[1:40:08] that's where he wants our love to come
[1:40:10] from that's where he wants our life to
[1:40:12] be
[1:40:12] is in his hands freely
[1:40:15] i offer to you freely lord not take it
[1:40:19] because i don't want you to
[1:40:21] but i want you to i'm giving it to you
[1:40:23] lord it belongs to you
[1:40:25] and this is that tribute see the feast
[1:40:28] of the weeks
[1:40:29] with a tribute of a free will offering
[1:40:33] not something mandated not something you
[1:40:36] have
[1:40:36] or forced to do but you do it from your
[1:40:39] heart
[1:40:40] you do it because you love him you do it
[1:40:43] because
[1:40:43] it's an acknowledgement of how good he
[1:40:46] has been to us
[1:40:47] and as we give back to the lord god
[1:40:50] blesses
[1:40:50] us even more bountifully amen
[1:40:54] you see how great the testimonies are
[1:40:57] going to come back to you
[1:40:59] just the testimonies that you gave today
[1:41:02] see how god blesses that
[1:41:04] testimony and brings it back to you amen
[1:41:06] because
[1:41:07] god will return to you tenfold a hundred
[1:41:10] fold of what you gave
[1:41:11] amen just the fruit of your lips and
[1:41:14] acknowledging
[1:41:15] the lord jesus and the blessings he done
[1:41:18] you see if god don't increase that
[1:41:19] right god don't continue to bless that
[1:41:22] and multiply that in your life and your
[1:41:24] family's lives
[1:41:25] amen you gave it of your own free will
[1:41:28] of your own hand
[1:41:30] which thou shalt give unto the lord thy
[1:41:33] god
[1:41:33] according as the lord thy god has
[1:41:36] blessed thee
[1:41:37] according as he has blessed thee
[1:41:41] that's where testimony come from our
[1:41:43] testimony comes from our hearts of our
[1:41:44] own free will as god has blessed you as
[1:41:47] god has blessed you you give to him
[1:41:50] you say lord god thank you now that
[1:41:53] being said it's pretty challenging if
[1:41:56] not completely impossible
[1:41:59] to give back to the lord anywhere close
[1:42:01] to what he does for us
[1:42:03] right amen amen but we do the best we
[1:42:05] can with what limited resources we have
[1:42:08] and what limited verbiage which i've
[1:42:10] already told you we have
[1:42:12] we do the best we can to give back to
[1:42:13] the lord your testimonies we're a part
[1:42:15] of that
[1:42:16] your worship and your praise is a part
[1:42:18] of that the songs we sang the music that
[1:42:20] was played
[1:42:20] the worship that we offer to the lord as
[1:42:22] of our own free will
[1:42:24] amen we sing songs to work to glorify
[1:42:27] god hallelujah
[1:42:28] returns back amen he inhabits of the
[1:42:31] worship of his people
[1:42:32] why why does god inhabit the worship of
[1:42:36] his people
[1:42:37] why does he show up when you start
[1:42:39] talking about it
[1:42:40] why does the spirit fall when you start
[1:42:42] testifying and you start
[1:42:44] witnessing about him when you mention
[1:42:46] the name
[1:42:47] jesus why does he come on the scene
[1:42:50] because of your acknowledgement because
[1:42:53] of your
[1:42:54] voice and of giving out he
[1:42:57] is blessing that by bringing it back to
[1:43:00] you
[1:43:01] and multiplying it in your life amen
[1:43:03] amen
[1:43:05] praise the lord do you see what i'm
[1:43:06] talking about
[1:43:08] you know you can turn on television
[1:43:11] whatever you see
[1:43:12] the other televangelists it's all about
[1:43:14] money to them it ain't all about
[1:43:16] money friend that's the smallest little
[1:43:18] miniscule thing on the totem pole
[1:43:20] students are the ones that make it the
[1:43:22] big thing right
[1:43:23] humans make it all every i remember one
[1:43:26] time a brother now
[1:43:27] you can agree with it or not but there
[1:43:30] was a
[1:43:31] uh this is probably
[1:43:34] 40 years ago in north carolina there was
[1:43:37] a brother
[1:43:38] a a pastor baptizing people and his
[1:43:41] brother was coming in to be baptized
[1:43:43] and he said oh hold on a second pastor
[1:43:45] and he started to take his wallet out
[1:43:46] and he said no sir brother
[1:43:48] leave that in there too we're going to
[1:43:49] baptize that too
[1:43:53] i thought well okay you know and
[1:43:56] everybody thought that was wonderful
[1:44:00] just worship and praise the lord and
[1:44:03] uh maybe he's got a point there i don't
[1:44:05] know but that's the most minisculest
[1:44:07] part of this
[1:44:08] amen what else and everything that god
[1:44:11] does
[1:44:12] and returning back to you when you
[1:44:15] acknowledge god before
[1:44:16] others how god returns that back to you
[1:44:20] when you testify to unbelievers
[1:44:24] uh when you've prayed for your family
[1:44:26] when when you
[1:44:27] uh uh give unto the lord and
[1:44:30] and i'm not talking about money you come
[1:44:32] to church when you're sitting here
[1:44:34] together
[1:44:36] when you put forth the effort to be here
[1:44:39] and and to come together and you see
[1:44:42] that god don't return that
[1:44:43] right that's right amen he does and he
[1:44:46] does it
[1:44:48] of your because you gave of your own
[1:44:50] free will
[1:44:51] according as god has blessed you amen
[1:44:54] according as god has blessed you i see
[1:44:57] that of course
[1:44:58] that again until we go back to tithe and
[1:45:00] offering
[1:45:01] because that's exactly as god has
[1:45:02] blessed you then that's how you bless
[1:45:04] back to the lord
[1:45:05] amen as god as you have talked and
[1:45:08] expressed your
[1:45:09] uh feeling and your testimony to the
[1:45:11] lord that's how god has blessed you
[1:45:14] and will continue to bless you you
[1:45:16] acknowledge it and you bring it forth
[1:45:19] god comes on the scene amen he
[1:45:21] multiplies it
[1:45:23] he he he blesses it that's why
[1:45:26] i believe that we see the things that's
[1:45:28] happening in our lives
[1:45:29] that we see the things that's happening
[1:45:31] in our family's lives
[1:45:33] as we said last week with all the
[1:45:34] turmoil and everything that's going on
[1:45:36] around this country and
[1:45:38] and the political unrest and the the
[1:45:40] financial unrest and
[1:45:42] uh i i saw something the other day where
[1:45:44] they had a
[1:45:46] uh a food bank and uh and my friends
[1:45:49] the the cars were lined up a mile deep
[1:45:52] to try to get to a food bank to get food
[1:45:54] has anybody's tables been empty
[1:46:01] but i guarantee you they're not because
[1:46:04] god's blessed you
[1:46:05] amen amen have you had to worry about
[1:46:07] getting to a food bank
[1:46:09] not lately amen god has blessed you
[1:46:13] because you see what's happening in the
[1:46:15] middle of everything that's going on god
[1:46:17] is still
[1:46:17] god has been and is always faithful
[1:46:20] yes he is amen amen he might not always
[1:46:23] have the
[1:46:24] uh the the words to say it the way we
[1:46:26] want to
[1:46:27] but it's still god understands and again
[1:46:30] god knows our heart
[1:46:31] too uh leviticus 22 29.
[1:46:34] let me move on here it says and when ye
[1:46:38] will offer a sacrifice
[1:46:40] of thanksgiving unto the lord offer it
[1:46:43] at your own
[1:46:44] will amen offer it at your
[1:46:48] own will god loves
[1:46:51] the bible says god loves a cheerful
[1:46:54] giver right now of course we all make
[1:46:56] all the time make that about money
[1:46:58] that he just to me that ain't just about
[1:47:00] money friend
[1:47:02] that's giving of yourself that's giving
[1:47:04] of your time
[1:47:05] right that's giving of your
[1:47:07] acknowledgement that you that you speak
[1:47:09] and you actually lay forth what your
[1:47:12] praise and worship is
[1:47:14] and how god has been good and how you
[1:47:16] tell other people about it
[1:47:18] that that means that that's a giver
[1:47:20] that's somebody that's giving of
[1:47:22] themselves
[1:47:23] you help other people and you're there
[1:47:25] for other people that's giving of
[1:47:27] yourself
[1:47:28] god loves a cheerful giver not someone
[1:47:31] that does it begrudgingly
[1:47:33] oh could you do this well i really don't
[1:47:35] want to well you know just stay home
[1:47:36] then
[1:47:37] right true i mean you could be a nice
[1:47:41] couple of
[1:47:42] strong arms or strong mind or whatever
[1:47:46] the situation is but you know if you
[1:47:48] don't want to do it just don't do it
[1:47:49] that's right amen
[1:47:51] but that's the kind of person that
[1:47:52] doesn't get blessed right
[1:47:54] the person that gets blessed is someone
[1:47:56] who is a cheerful giver
[1:47:58] someone who comes up and says look you
[1:48:00] know brother i can't do a whole lot
[1:48:02] and i don't have a whole lot but what i
[1:48:04] can do you ask me and i'll be there for
[1:48:07] you amen
[1:48:08] now see that that's a cheerful giver
[1:48:11] these three brothers right here
[1:48:12] angel angel and ernesto
[1:48:16] were in this church putting down carpet
[1:48:19] painting walls
[1:48:20] and doing what they could do if i had
[1:48:22] other brothers like brother dennis once
[1:48:24] come to me and say
[1:48:25] you know i i can't do a whole lot have
[1:48:27] physical limitations but
[1:48:29] brother for something i can do just tell
[1:48:31] me god blesses that friend
[1:48:33] amen i understand god will bless you for
[1:48:35] that even if you don't lift a finger
[1:48:37] even if there's nothing you
[1:48:39] end up being able to do right god
[1:48:42] blesses us
[1:48:42] for that amen everything that we give to
[1:48:45] him
[1:48:46] we do it of our own free will praise the
[1:48:49] lord
[1:48:49] from our heart we do it because we love
[1:48:52] god and we love his children
[1:48:53] amen we love it because we we're
[1:48:55] thankful to have a place to worship
[1:48:57] amen i'm thankful to have this place of
[1:49:00] worship
[1:49:01] yes amen but you know we live in this
[1:49:03] world and
[1:49:04] and and it's not free and it didn't
[1:49:07] happen this way because we snapped our
[1:49:08] fingers
[1:49:09] there's a lot of work that went into it
[1:49:12] a lot of cleaning that went into it a
[1:49:14] lot of
[1:49:14] a lot of labor and a lot of money it
[1:49:17] went into making this what it was
[1:49:19] and we either appreciate it or we don't
[1:49:21] it's right and i believe we do
[1:49:22] amen because god provided it and god
[1:49:26] honored the free will offering we give
[1:49:28] to the lord hallelujah
[1:49:30] you can't out give god amen no way amen
[1:49:33] you can't outgive god
[1:49:35] no man it's don't don't matter i've
[1:49:37] heard people tell me before oh they gave
[1:49:39] too much you can't
[1:49:40] not if you're giving it to the lord amen
[1:49:42] amen
[1:49:43] now if you put something in the box just
[1:49:45] because you think you're giving it to me
[1:49:47] you're wrong right that's right right
[1:49:49] amen that's the lord's
[1:49:51] yes whatever you do here at this church
[1:49:53] you say i'll do this for the pastor no
[1:49:55] no no
[1:49:56] no you don't do it for me you do it for
[1:49:58] the lord praise god
[1:50:00] i i do it that way amen i'm of course
[1:50:03] now obviously as we serve one another
[1:50:06] we're serving god
[1:50:07] it's true of course i'm not negating
[1:50:10] that point but i don't i do this for the
[1:50:12] lord
[1:50:13] me and brother roger have those
[1:50:14] conversations many times and the things
[1:50:16] that's been
[1:50:16] gone into this we didn't do this for me
[1:50:19] or for him for you we did it for the
[1:50:21] lord
[1:50:21] amen god blesses it because of that
[1:50:25] god blesses our lives amen you're a part
[1:50:27] of that
[1:50:28] every one of you here is a part of that
[1:50:30] amen amen
[1:50:31] because you give of your own free will
[1:50:32] that's why god
[1:50:34] blesses it now the second part i want to
[1:50:38] get to
[1:50:38] this thanksgiving that you gave is in
[1:50:42] the thanksgiving that we have is
[1:50:43] of our own free will we did it because
[1:50:45] we wanted to
[1:50:46] we did it because it was in our heart
[1:50:48] too the other thing we need to do with
[1:50:50] our thanksgiving and our worship
[1:50:52] let's go to genesis chapter 4.
[1:51:02] maybe eventually i'm still a little up
[1:51:04] in the air about this one
[1:51:06] we'll start putting the scriptures up on
[1:51:08] the screen
[1:51:10] but i will say if you're streaming if
[1:51:12] you're here
[1:51:14] i i don't ever want us to get to the
[1:51:16] place that we don't bring our bibles to
[1:51:19] church
[1:51:19] amen okay i don't i don't see any way
[1:51:23] to go into battle without a weapon amen
[1:51:25] that's true and we come here
[1:51:27] and we come into battle you need a sword
[1:51:30] and i i if we ever do start putting them
[1:51:33] up there which we
[1:51:34] we might do probably will i don't want
[1:51:37] you not to bring your bibles to church
[1:51:39] amen i know amen we started doing that
[1:51:42] to tabernacle and everybody quit
[1:51:43] bringing their
[1:51:44] bibles to church everybody's walking out
[1:51:46] of church
[1:51:47] without anything in their hands yeah and
[1:51:50] and i thought i just i'm sorry that's
[1:51:53] just how i feel i'm not saying that
[1:51:55] anybody's
[1:51:56] wrong or right or wrong or going to hell
[1:51:59] or
[1:51:59] unsaved none of that just it's just it's
[1:52:02] just
[1:52:03] my quirky thing i i just an old school
[1:52:06] uh if you bring a tablet or a phone
[1:52:10] okay but i just like this right here
[1:52:13] amen i just don't think they'll ever be
[1:52:15] a substitute for this
[1:52:18] uh i've been asked and uh why i didn't
[1:52:22] and things that
[1:52:23] i i still write my sermons down on pads
[1:52:27] he's why don't you use a tablet i mean
[1:52:29] they're not that expensive blah blah it
[1:52:30] doesn't have anything to do with price
[1:52:33] i've never owned a tablet micah gave us
[1:52:35] me and sonya won
[1:52:36] i used it for a little bit but she has
[1:52:38] it now and i i just never used it
[1:52:41] it's just i i don't know old dog new
[1:52:44] trick thing i don't know
[1:52:46] i just it's just you just can't
[1:52:48] substitute that to me
[1:52:50] it's not going to substitute this bible
[1:52:51] by a phone by a tablet by a screen
[1:52:54] you're just not going to substitute it
[1:52:55] but amen anyway
[1:52:57] maybe lord willing one time we'll get
[1:52:59] we'll we'll make start putting them up
[1:53:00] there
[1:53:01] a little update for you uh lord willem
[1:53:04] we're gonna have a sound system next
[1:53:05] week
[1:53:06] uh that we don't want it to be too loud
[1:53:09] but we've had some
[1:53:10] uh some feedback that maybe the piano
[1:53:14] gets
[1:53:15] a little difficult to hear or the song
[1:53:17] the singing when we're all singing and
[1:53:19] worshiping even though it's a small
[1:53:20] building
[1:53:21] so lord willing we're gonna have try to
[1:53:23] get a sound system hopefully
[1:53:25] we'll have it by next sunday that we can
[1:53:28] have a sound service brother roger's
[1:53:29] buying some cameras to do the streaming
[1:53:31] with and
[1:53:32] a sound board for the uh for the cameras
[1:53:36] and everything so anyway
[1:53:37] we still got work that we're doing uh so
[1:53:40] appreciate your prayers about that and
[1:53:43] uh and again
[1:53:44] it's not without effort and finances to
[1:53:46] do it all
[1:53:47] yes so uh we're very thankful for that
[1:53:50] but
[1:53:50] the lord lord willem we'll we'll we'll
[1:53:52] see where it goes from there
[1:53:54] but genesis chapter four verse one this
[1:53:56] is the second point that i wanted to get
[1:53:58] across to you
[1:53:58] before we close here now and adam knew
[1:54:01] eve his wife and she conceived and bear
[1:54:03] cain and said i've gotten a man from the
[1:54:05] lord
[1:54:06] and she and that was the part that guy
[1:54:07] had got to me the other day
[1:54:10] about he brought it up i didn't bring it
[1:54:12] up
[1:54:13] you know what scientifically proven that
[1:54:15] that a woman can have twins
[1:54:17] and and have a two different babies from
[1:54:19] two different men i said
[1:54:21] yeah did you just say that i've never
[1:54:24] run into another human to actually
[1:54:26] say that who they when they instigated
[1:54:28] the conversation
[1:54:29] i said absolutely i said you don't think
[1:54:31] it was an apple do you
[1:54:34] anyway we we had to stop
[1:54:38] but lord willing we're supposed to go
[1:54:40] back to that house and do some more work
[1:54:42] and she again bear his brother abel abel
[1:54:44] was the keeper of the sheep but
[1:54:45] cain was the tiller of the ground and in
[1:54:46] process of time it came to pass that
[1:54:48] cain bought
[1:54:49] brought the fruit of the ground an
[1:54:51] offering unto the lord
[1:54:53] offering unto the lord that was the that
[1:54:56] was what the increase that he had gotten
[1:54:58] from the labor of his hand
[1:55:00] and abel also brought of the firstings
[1:55:02] of the flock and the fat thereof and the
[1:55:04] lord had respect unto abel in his
[1:55:05] offering
[1:55:06] but undercain and his offering he had
[1:55:08] not respect and cain was very wrought
[1:55:10] and his countenance fell now the
[1:55:13] difference between the two
[1:55:14] sacrifices the difference between the
[1:55:16] two offerings
[1:55:18] now brother graham tells us all the
[1:55:20] things was set up right
[1:55:21] altar and all the semantics and all the
[1:55:24] the practice of it was done the same
[1:55:27] uh their heart was there and they were
[1:55:29] giving it of their own free will and
[1:55:30] and and and they were doing it that way
[1:55:33] but
[1:55:34] the one thing that cain's
[1:55:37] sacrifice lacked was revelation
[1:55:41] uh you can go to hebrews 11 8 and it
[1:55:43] tells you that by
[1:55:45] faith abel offered unto god a more
[1:55:47] excellent sacrifice we know faith is
[1:55:49] revelation
[1:55:50] so by revelation abel offered to god a
[1:55:53] more excellent sacrifice
[1:55:54] cain's sacrifice was refused by god so
[1:55:58] what tells
[1:55:58] us god does not accept just any worship
[1:56:02] right the worship that we give to god
[1:56:06] has should be by our free will but it
[1:56:09] needs to come by revelation
[1:56:11] we need to know why we're worshiping who
[1:56:14] we're worshiping we're not worshiping a
[1:56:16] father over here and a
[1:56:18] and a son in the middle and a holy ghost
[1:56:20] over here or
[1:56:22] one big one in the middle and two or
[1:56:23] three over here where we gotta know who
[1:56:25] we're worshiping
[1:56:27] we got to know in what way that we
[1:56:29] worship the lord
[1:56:30] we don't come to worship the lord by our
[1:56:32] attitudes and our thoughts
[1:56:34] we come to worship him in the way the
[1:56:36] word tells us to worship him
[1:56:38] by revelation by truth
[1:56:41] those that worship him must worship him
[1:56:43] in
[1:56:44] spirit and in truth
[1:56:47] amen amen there's a spirit it's his holy
[1:56:50] spirit
[1:56:51] there's a truth and then it's this bible
[1:56:53] amen we worship him in the mechanics
[1:56:55] and the dynamics hallelujah that's how
[1:56:58] our worship
[1:56:58] comes that can only come by revelation
[1:57:02] right the mechanics can only come in the
[1:57:04] in the
[1:57:05] context that is supposed to come by
[1:57:07] revelation amen
[1:57:08] people have a head knowledge of it you
[1:57:11] see churches around the world
[1:57:12] they worship their hands up tears
[1:57:14] flowing mascara is running
[1:57:16] and they're worshiping god hallelujah
[1:57:19] sorry i don't mean to be cynical about
[1:57:21] that but
[1:57:22] it's true amen that's right but and
[1:57:25] they're worshiping god
[1:57:26] but where is the where's the revelation
[1:57:29] behind it
[1:57:30] where's the truth there's a dynamic
[1:57:33] there but where's the mechanic
[1:57:35] amen where's the truth of it see there's
[1:57:38] there's the the the dynamic the the free
[1:57:42] will that we give to the lord there's
[1:57:43] got to be a mechanic behind it
[1:57:46] there's got to be a truth to it there's
[1:57:48] got to be a revelation behind it or it
[1:57:50] is
[1:57:50] not accepted by god amen
[1:57:54] even in isaiah isaiah rebuked the people
[1:57:58] because they were bringing their
[1:58:00] sacrifice and doing
[1:58:02] everything that the that god had
[1:58:04] commanded them to do
[1:58:06] but it became a stink in god's nostrils
[1:58:09] their worship became a stink in god's
[1:58:12] nostrils
[1:58:12] because it became just a formality to
[1:58:15] them that's right
[1:58:16] amen it just became something that they
[1:58:18] did it wasn't from the heart anymore
[1:58:21] it wasn't something that was the desire
[1:58:23] that they wanted to do
[1:58:25] it became a drudgery for them it became
[1:58:28] something they
[1:58:29] that was that was a hardship and they
[1:58:32] didn't want to do it and it was just
[1:58:34] a formality so what would just take the
[1:58:36] lamb and go cut his throat you know
[1:58:37] we're done
[1:58:38] done and and it was it became a sting to
[1:58:40] god amen
[1:58:42] that's the same thing friend if our
[1:58:44] worship doesn't come with revelation
[1:58:46] if our worship doesn't come by truth of
[1:58:48] the word
[1:58:49] and the spirit of the word then god
[1:58:52] doesn't accept it i'm sorry people say
[1:58:53] that was it
[1:58:54] well how could god not accept them
[1:58:56] standing with their hands up in their
[1:58:58] tears and all because the bible says so
[1:59:01] amen and i don't care how many
[1:59:03] theologians you can come
[1:59:04] say oh god's got to accept that no he
[1:59:07] doesn't
[1:59:08] right god accepts who he does and
[1:59:10] rejects who he wants
[1:59:12] amen that's his sovereignty amen that's
[1:59:15] up to god to do
[1:59:16] he saw he loved jacob he loved esau he
[1:59:19] hated for either boy was born
[1:59:21] you tell me god was wrong in that god's
[1:59:24] sovereign he can do whatever he wants to
[1:59:25] do
[1:59:25] praise god i'm not going to try to
[1:59:27] lecture him on it amen
[1:59:29] i want to go spend eternity with him
[1:59:31] amen amen
[1:59:33] worship our worship must be by mechanics
[1:59:36] dynamics our worship must be our
[1:59:38] thanksgiving
[1:59:40] must be with revelation it must be with
[1:59:42] truth
[1:59:43] it must be according to the word not by
[1:59:46] my oh
[1:59:46] well i'll i'll give god what i want to
[1:59:48] give him i'll give him the time i want
[1:59:50] to give him now
[1:59:50] you give him what you a lot of times the
[1:59:53] hardest thing to do is to give is to
[1:59:55] give unto the lord
[1:59:57] right amen and people amen
[2:00:00] have a hard time understanding that
[2:00:01] accepting if you don't have god in you
[2:00:03] you won't do it
[2:00:04] right but it's got to be by revelation
[2:00:06] you've got to be of your own free will
[2:00:09] and it's got to be by revelation right
[2:00:11] worship with revelation can't be
[2:00:13] just um
[2:00:16] of what you you want to approach him as
[2:00:20] so i'll just approach god the way i want
[2:00:22] to no god won't accept that right amen
[2:00:24] i'll just do it the way i want to do it
[2:00:26] well that's fine but god's not going to
[2:00:27] accept it
[2:00:29] tears flow and the emotions are there
[2:00:31] but god doesn't accept it
[2:00:32] right amen people are going to come to
[2:00:34] jesus on that day and say oh did we not
[2:00:36] do this this in your name
[2:00:38] he said department he'll say depart from
[2:00:40] me you working near workers of iniquity
[2:00:42] i never knew you
[2:00:43] right that's right never knew oh but we
[2:00:45] did this lord
[2:00:47] oh we we talked about this we had church
[2:00:50] we worshiped you we went to the prisons
[2:00:53] we fed the hungry
[2:00:54] we did all these things in your name and
[2:00:56] he says but i never knew you
[2:00:57] right because it wasn't done according
[2:01:00] to the word
[2:01:01] amen revelation wasn't done by truth it
[2:01:04] was done just because they
[2:01:06] uh wanted to look good or wanted to have
[2:01:09] more members or
[2:01:10] something of that effect but it's got to
[2:01:12] be something that god that we give unto
[2:01:15] the lord
[2:01:16] and amen and freely by revelation
[2:01:20] a couple of scriptures psalms 100 make a
[2:01:23] joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands

[2:01:54] his mercy everlasting and his truth
[2:01:57] endureth to all generations hallelujah
[2:02:00] praise the lord amen

[2:02:10] god holy and beloved bows
[2:02:12] mercies kindness humbleness of mind
