TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello everyone god bless you again today welcome to our livestream for this Sunday you know we had some adversity going on around today and this week and past couple weeks so probably going to as we are having livestream today will probably do it again next week and then we'll see where the Lord leads after that I talked to the Holiday Inn so we're okay still to go back in after a couple of weeks so just appreciate your patience with the things that have been going on with the kovat stuff and then kind of coming close to home to us here I'm very happy to report though that but the Zach who did test positive is doing very well had really mild symptoms probably been sicker with the flu before and sister Celia and sister Sharia had wanted to quarantine because they had been in contact with each other have been in contact with sister sashe who actually tested positive as well so we just felt like would with it that close and quarantine going on that just be better off would just do the livestream for right now and I believe brother Zach's quarantine is about up so I'm sure she Leah's sure I think try the kids had a little a couple little symptoms too but they're doing much better again it's just strange how this thing seems to kill some people and other people have had bad colds were sure worse than this oh it's kind of hard to tell the way this thing goes but trusting the Lord still believing the gut protects us and takes care of us and watches over us so we're here today and our home in Sonya and welcome you into our living room so god bless you today before we get started I want to open the service in prayer and have quite a few prayer to give to you today I'll try to make them brief me and brother Roger was on the job Friday and had to go do a bid and brother Rogers truck overheated and messed his engine up so just pray for him the Lord would just guide him and that was our work vehicle so what to do next and provide for him whatever the need is that we can do there also remember brother John Duncan I didn't find out until this week but brother John went to Las Vegas to be with his family over the holiday weeks I did talk to him since he got there safe and everything's going well he was happy to be with his family so please remember him as his trip continues and comes back to be with us here in Tucson so please remember brother John in prayer as well also a very serious somber request that I mentioned to you all of you know about sister Priscilla sister passing away this week unexpectedly hit the family very hard sister Priscilla last prayer for her family she feels very broken lost right now it's kind of difficult sometimes when you go through these real extreme adversities to understand why comes sometimes become our proverbial cry is why I actually had that in the book when I was talking about me and my wife and our son passing away it's it's a difficult situation but we're trusting and believing as Priscilla put in her text that quoting Joe the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord she says I continue to worship and praise him and thank him but we are very thankful as I talked to angel and Maria day that they felt her sister had confessed and wanted to get baptized and was a Christian and believed the way that Priscilla was living in things so we're very thankful for that she was just waiting hoping to get baptized but I said well the Lord knows her heart and that's what matters the most baptism doesn't save you friend we know that that's just unto repentance so it's when you get the Holy Ghost is what the Lord identifying himself with us is what brings salvation the Holy Ghost in their lives so God knows her heart and where she is now so just trusting and believing that we continue to remember sister Priscilla her mother sister family in prayer of course if their family and brother angel said his family too so please remember them in prayer if you would for that situation again you continue to remember Zach and prayer sister Celia Sharia art and Gabriel Alice and their family home of course Tabitha Zach and Joel and Emma - as you know as I told you Micah did go get tested and he tested negative which we were all with Zach and Tabitha for Tabitha's birthday so me and Sonia have had absolutely no symptoms Tabitha and the kids have had no symptoms so we're very thankful the Lord has blessed us and kept us protected during this situation also brother Dave had text me a request he told me that sister Callie Kelley Batman had had a stroke again you know she's had several been susceptible to that we'll just trust in the Lord's hand upon sister Kelly he also sent me a couple requests one says please pray for Tyler a teenage friend of a customer / friend he needs a heart/liver transplant remember that prayer also he said please remember pray for Rob the husband of a Charlotte friend Kathy with liver cancer is having a difficult time drinking eating and keeping anything down so but the Dave sent those requests and today slit remember that in prayer as well sister Sheila also wanted us to please remember her brother Harlan seems like maybe Harlan's wife who's been intrical in this prayer requests that we've been giving that had a softer heart but we continued one a continue to remember calling in prayer sister Sheila is not sure she wants to make sure as I'm sure her brother Harlan does that his wife's apology and humbleness is sincere so let's just continue to remember her brother Harlan in prayers you all know we mentioned his the court date got postponed so there could be a very much a reason beyond covent want that happened so let's just please remember that sister Norma had a few requests want to remember in prayer she had four prayer requests she said my sister will be going into a private assisted living tomorrow breaks my heart but I can't take care for any longer only the Lord knows what tomorrow holds so please remember Tony sister Norma's sister in prayer also please pray for my daughter granddaughter and her friend this is an unspoken request she also says please pray for my husband I did not share it but his kidney function has gone down again I almost lost him in 2011 when everything was shutting down so let's remember Ronnie and prayer sister Norma's husband also her daughter Kathy is a disease that her stomach will not empty out of her food rots it does not digest and have that as a prayer request so I remember that in prayer that God's hand would be upon her upon her sister and upon these requests today remember her sister's name's Toni her husband's name is Ron Ronnie and their daughters Cathy so let's just remember these requests in prayer for sister Norma also from brother Dennis we want to continue remember his wife Leanne prayer Leah's getting very weary not only just the mental stress of dealing with this all the time in the cove but then the physical situation always wearing mask glam gallons clients complaints and things going on they're just I'm sure it's probably a pretty rough time having to deal with all of that in the medical world so please continue remember Lian prayer also asked to pray for one of Hurts granddaughters who's struggling with her identity as a young woman she told her mother she believes that she is attracted to other women so we're just gonna remember that in prayer we know how the devices that the enemy are today and of course the girl has her mother's support so that doesn't help but we do know that the Lord can intervene in this situation and that God's hand can be upon that and move upon that in a special way so please remember that in prayer too it's been a busy week a lot of things going on but God is still ever faithful and true we know he's always there just like a midweek service that I gave to you a little fault that I had very simple but it just came to me in prayer that it was very important to recognize and continue to remember that in all of what's going on God is still there he's never left us never forsook us he's still here he's still doing the same yesterday today and forever amen siliceous remember those I hope I got all the requests and many of them text in here I wanted to make sure I got them all to you today so please remember these requests and these needs and if I miss one for some reason somehow please forgive me but God knows our hearts God knows these requests and we believe that he's with us now so let's bind together if you're in your living room or wherever you're at watching this participating in this if you may watch it archived then we're just gonna believe together now as we bow our heads in prayer Lord Jesus father were very thankful that you're always with us God Lord that theme just keeps hitting my heart it keeps hitting my spirit knowing Lord that you are truly their God we believe you Father and it needs to be something that's cognizant to us it needs to be something that's a reality to us that we never forgive and we never let go of the fact that you are there and you right here now as we bow our heads Lord toward the dust from whence these bodies came believing that you hear our cries you hear our prayers we Lord as a congregation and those of us are joining in this live streaming there are praying together Lord audibly in our hearts and whatever way God and we're believing father that you hear our requests in our prayers Lord there are so many numerous requests to be made known but Lord we believe that you know them all Lord as they have been read as they have been brought before to this congregation and before you I pray that your hand of mercy would move upon them each one God that you would touch them we call them every one out by name and we're believing call that you are faithful and true as you have always been it may not always work the way we believe is going to the way we expect it to be or maybe sometimes even the way we want it to be but we know God that you're going to work it together for our good because we love you and you promise that to us Lord and for our families for our loved ones for each one situation circumstance for this Cova thing and for protection keep us all heads to the Lord with your holy angels and protection father of all that is going on today we love you and thank you and pray God that you bless this Lord just take these lips now take my mind by actions my thoughts let it be about you and may you have full control over it and speak to us what you would have us today Lord I'm nothing but Lord which yielded servant to you we are in all of us nothing but yielded servants to you as you speak to these lips Lord may you hear through their ears and may we all receive what you have for us today we committed to you and asked your blessings upon it now and the precious holy lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you today start my recording here I want to go to st. Luke chapter 14 to begin our scripture reading as all of you know we had the fourth of July weekend this weekend and that was yesterday and of course is the fifth of July and this thought came to back my heart I had had this a few weeks ago is going to be a midweek service but the Lord changed it and added a lot of things to it and just trust it be a blessing to get today so we're going to go to Saint Luke chapter 14 and going to begin reading with verse 25 st. Luke 14 verse 25 we'll begin reading give you a moment to be get that there praise the Lord as I've said before it's a little different when you've preached for over 30 years to live congregations and you get feedback and you watch people's faces and things clicked on it's a little different now when you're sitting there at home but I trust you're there and you're interactive and you're participating even if I can't see or hear you so amen st. Luke 1425 and there can't and there was great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them now look at this there's great multitudes following him now recognize that usually when there's great multitudes a a fair amount of that great multitude isn't really wanting to be with him their hearts not sincere they're not the heart is not in the right place counterfeit Christians as we call them may be today as we get into it and I want to as we've talked about that I want to get into this about counting the cost and then we want to talk about counting the cost today there was a great multitude with him and he turned and said unto them notice this great multitude is following Jesus and he turns he said if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yayyyy and his and his own life also he cannot be my disciple you see what Jesus is trying to tell them they're all following him they're all going along with him but one of their hearts where does their determination where is their dedication see he's wanting to make this clear he's wanted to find out so that they understand what the cost is for having to follow him a lot of people say they want to follow him and they get in the scripture and they look and say word says if you can with your mouth you are safe but they don't understand until they get into what it is to be a Christian to be able to count the cost and see what it's going to cost them and if they're willing to pay the price most people aren't willing to pay the price there's people then the Bible that had to pay the price there's people through the Dark Ages that many of them paid an ultimate price watching their children and their family members burn at the stake and killed and murdered there's people today that we still have to understand what it means to count the cost to be a Christian to be a Christian of true godly Christian today Holy Ghost field comes with a price friend comes with a cost that it will cost you and that's what Jesus warning is to them here he's trying to help them understand look you're following me but following me is gonna cost you you have to understand unless you're willing to forsake everything now he's talking about father mother wife children those things but what he's basically saying is I'm going to be first in your life or I'm not gonna be in your life that's the bottom line see so are we willing to pay that price are we willing to count that cost and understand that this is way worth more than anything else that we've ever ever if ever entered into sea and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple see that crosses ours to bear for which of you intending to build a tower said it not down first and counted the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it see don't begin don't start something you can't finish I remember when I was a young kid that was kind of a motto my dad used to tell me that became a big theme don't start something can't finish and then even in school when you know these young kids and junior high and all were flexing our masculinity and bristling up and wanna fight who are like what don't something don't start something you can't finish in other words if you willing to tangle with me you better understand what you get into so it kind of became a thing see don't start something can't finish but truth is that's biblical it is biblical don't start something you can't finish see and if you're starting to follow Christ you got to understand what the cost is going to be and a lot of people don't understand that today they think that because they can live any kind of life and boot do any kind of thing and just say oh well I accept Jesus well I'm good now no it doesn't work that way and then go and be the same person you were the same life that same way and listen the same music and did the other same places doesn't work that way there's a cost that comes with it and thankfully when the Holy Ghost comes in there that cost becomes very minimal because we know what the reward is for count before before the cost that we give up for it but now his his lesson here is now you didn't build a tower you don't sit down first and count the cost say we know what this is going to take we know what this is gonna taste it's like a farmer a farmer knows that he's not gonna plant something in the heat of the summer something or certain things that taking more water or less water things like that I mean if I were to take a swirl and put it in Florida probably wouldn't last very long it's not adapted for that and a farmer is not going to plant things and that that the heat of the summer the heat of the Sun is gonna burn in scorch you're not going to get a crop like that so you count the cost you sit down and say what is the best time what is the best way do we have what it takes to finish this do we have what it takes to get this from beginning to end and that's what it means to Odyssey people I've known people to run this race for years I've known people to come to church it's believed for twenty thirty years and then he gets down to the end and away they go because they didn't understand that first to get what it needed to be able to count that cost and to go forward with what it was going to take to get beyond that point see got to count the cost first 29th first less happily after he hath laid the foundation is not able to finish it all that behold it and begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish gotta finish what you started or what King going to make war against another King said it not down first and consulted whether he be able with ten thousand to meet them then cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet oh great way off he sendeth in an embassy and desired conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he'd be of you that forsaketh not all forsaken not all that he have he cannot be my disciple salt is good that if salt is lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the linen nor yet for the dunghill yet men cast it out he that hath ears let him hear see so it brings us to that understanding who is willing to pay the price who is willing to understand what it cost and see it brings me to the dynamic of what's going on in this country today and a lot of the things is it there's a lot of knee-jerk as we call they used to call it I guess they call it again a lot of knee jerk reactions going on a lot of knee-jerk reactions in people's lives and companies and businesses and in things that moms are tearing down statues and and and taking parts of cities and wanting to get rid of the police these people even consider understand what it means to not have a policeman come to your home when you're in need of someone when you're sick or when some violence going on or when you're being threatened they not understand see that there comes there's a price with everything everything has a price and people don't understand the ramifications that come from this you think about this and I'm gonna be very specific but you think about this zone that was created in Seattle that was police free two people died in that zone in the past few weeks two people they'll probably never find the killer the people that were killed never got any medical help because the people in there wouldn't let them in they didn't understand what it was gonna cost to do what they did a lot of knee-jerk reactions no accountability no responsibility today it's like do whatever you want be whatever you want and and on these things that there's no repercussions well friend there is repercussions now even though it may be the repercussions in this country and then the things going on around here may be lessening the repercussions are still there friend because we all have to answer to one on one day at one time every one of us have to answer for our actions one day before the Lord everybody no matter who they are so it's accounting the cost to these people count the cost and understand yeah the the lack of responsibility that's there the lack of accountability there can be very very serious consequences for not thinking certain things through or as a Christian would be or pray about them first there can be very serious consequences on the back end of something less we've gone to the Lord and ask God prayed about it thought it through decided somehow is this going to be what what I can finish what I the result is going to end up on on a good end you know I mean if we dismantle and get rid of all the police what's going to be the result what's going to end up at the end of that the end of that if they actually get what they're talking to I don't believe they will but if they actually get what they wanted what do they think is gonna happen if all those horrible things happen in this little zone in Seattle for that short period of time and all the things that took place there besides the burgers what do you think is gonna happen if that happens around this nation around this country when all the major metropolis is you down on one one and nobody shows up there is nobody to even answer 9/11 because they've been defunded see no accountability no responsibility and grave consequences for people's actions see you gotta understand when you when you delve into this that you you there's a price to pay don't start what you can't finish see and that's what a lot of people do today these grave consequences can really make a big difference in people's lives and they've made a difference in in our lives because it leads to something and and and when it leads to that that are we willing to take that are we willing to accept that as the responsibility of what we did over here now see that's just it people will do things something bad will happen and when the bad happen because of their actions they'll blame somebody else for the result well this is not somebody else's fault to that result the result is your fault because of your actions but a lot of times people will act and react without knowledge or forethought or intelligence and they don't realize what it takes there's a lot of Christians in the world today they say well I want Jesus but they don't really know what they want they think they want him they think they know what they want but do they really because they go off and live any kind of life and do any kind of way and one day of their Christian or say they are one day they're next and they act this way or do these things and there's a cost that comes with that and they know people just don't understand what it takes and what the cost is when that when those men and those women came over into this new land they knew what it was going to take those people were willing to give their life so that you and I could enjoy the freedoms suppose it nouns kind of Gandhi you know recently but that we've enjoyed for all these years thankfully we still enjoyed the freedom of religion we still have the opportunity to worship the Lord Jesus to stream this live to talk about him to sing about him well the longer you're not in California they don't let you sing in your church services anymore but very liberal governor but anyway we could talk about him we can sing about it we can write about it we can publish about see we still had that freedom and those people were willing to for that and many of them did died they knew what the cost was going to be they were willing to pay the price because they knew what the end result was going to be and the end result is what the greatest country that probably existed come forth in the United States of America and we're thankful to be able to live here today and the freedom set into fours it's going in a different direction because we know many years ago turned its back on God but this is where we're at what was the cost of those actions the costs of turning down God has led us to a godless society and you can look around today and you can see what a godless society is all about it seems like the government is more interested in collecting every human on this planet's DNA than they are anything else tracking you tracing you what's it going to cost what is that going to to mean you know when you when you lay down and of this another old saying but when you lay down in the bed with a dog it's got fleas you gotta understand what that's gonna cost you you know the old saying is lay in the bed with the dog it's got sleeves you're gonna get fleas that's what the cost is that's what it's going to cost you you decide to do that it seems odd with all the dog stuff going on today but that's just an old stigma used to have many many years ago you lay in the bed with the dogs got fleas you get fleas that's the result it costs something there's something that comes as a cost that comes with doing that and that's what that cost is now I want to keep going further because I want the I want to evolve this into something that's a little greater than just just those superficial things we're talking about because the cost is even greater than that see because there's the cost that comes with a finish let's just say I'm gonna go to Roman's here Romans chapter 4 if you want to go ahead and turn there Romans chapter 4 but when when you go shopping you go to the grocery store to go shopping you got to make sure that and I've been in line behind people before and when me and Sonia we're struggling at times we had to do the same thing you go through there you take a calculator and you say this is this much and this is this much and this is this much and we really need or would like to have that but we can't get it because we've reached our budget and you got to look in the cart and say okay are we better with this are we better with this we'd have this you got to count the cost on how many times I've set behind people in a supermarket line and they're having to say ok we'll take that off and okay we'll take that off and and the cash you're sitting there trying to take all these items off of their bill because they don't have sufficient to pay for it if you don't have sufficient to pay for it see at the end of that there's a finishing time there's a finishing time after you've brought your actions forth you've shopped right that's a simple analogy you've shopped at the end of your shopping there comes a reconciliation there comes a time of reckoning where you've got to pay for what you bought or what you just took you got to pay for it that's the finish line you can walk out the door after you've paid for it but you got to pay for it first and it comes with a cost the groceries aren't fee free they come with a cost you got to pay for them well the pain the cost comes at the end to see was this worth the price and when that it comes then you can see that's when it reconciles and was it worth it or not now in Romans chapter 4 I want to read beginning with verse 20 talk about Abraham for just a moment I just got a couple more thoughts to add to this and and then the completion of this and and we'll go for today but in Romans chapter 4 most of you probably know this but talking about Abraham here it let's begin with verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being now look at this and being fully persuaded that he had promised he was able also to perform so what Abraham is saying or what Paul sang about Abraham is that Abraham believed in whom he knew as God Almighty the self-existing elohim he's talking about Abraham as he knew God he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief strong in faith strong in faith giving glory to God being fully persuaded that what he had promised who he God Abraham was fully persuaded and his faith identified him to God as righteous because of his faith because he was fully persuaded that the god that he had faith in that started this is faithful and able to perform or finish it abraham was faded and that faith that ability that that that he had that abraham had fully persuaded that faith is what accounted him to god as righteousness and remember righteousness is a person norse someone in the state of there ought to be condition they're in the condition they're in the place that they ought to be with God oh that's the perfect place I mean that's utopia that's what the world looks for utopia that's it see but that's probably what they're doing with these cop free zones with with the cop you there weren't supposed to be police to begin with there were no police the Garden of Eden and will be police in the new world and the new city the New Jerusalem there will be new police and that's of the world that's of the city that's of the devil we won't need that we won't need hospitals we won't need doctors medicine we don't have any Colvin or you can serene those things in that world it's just none of that and so we don't have to worry about that those people they're thinking at the Utopia well the utopia is here not there but Abraham knew what it was and he knew and was and I faith enough to believe that he who had started it he who had promised was able to perform it amen and I believe we should have that same faith the same God that did that is the same God that's gonna finish it God doesn't start something he can't finish understand even he starts it he's able to finish it when he finishes it then you know what it is done therefore it was imputed to him it was accounted to him as righteousness or as a righteous act from a righteous person as God seeing Abraham in his ought to be condition God help me that's exactly the place that I believe each one of us want to be exact place each one of us should be it was accounted to him as righteous because he believed that the God that said he would do it was able to perform it so when we get into something and we understand if God has started it then God's going to be the one to finish it and if he is not able to finish it he wasn't started and I believe that excuse me I believe that for us I believe that if God started that working you God would not call you or commissioned you to do something if God didn't already know that you could do it why would God call you knowing that you had that you don't have the ability to do it you don't have the ability to finish it if God calls you to something he'll finish you'll finish it through you but you'll finish it because it's his responsibility see then it becomes his responsibility and not ours were just here as servants of the Lord we're just here to give our lives to him and servitude and whatever he calls for us to do that's what we want to do that's but that becomes our life that's what we want to do now st. John I want to continue with this frame of thought now st. John chapter 5 verse 31 seeing John chapter 5 verse 31 look at this for a moment if I bear witness to myself my witness is not true there is another the beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true ye sent unto John and he bear witness unto the truth but I receive not testimony for man but of these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and shining light burning shining light that you were willing for a season to rejoice in this life but I had greater witness that I had of John the works of the father here we go but I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the father hath given me to finish look at this now the works that the father has given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me so see that work that God had to get finished God didn't entrust this to just anybody God didn't entrusts us to Abraham God didn't trust this to brother Branham God didn't entrust this to Adam or to any great man he came himself he sent His only begotten Son he came himself to finish this work and Jesus in that corporal body is declaring the greater witness of John that the works was the father had given him to finish the same works I do because he was able to finish it he was able to do it he was able to complete what God had given him to do because he God has Jesus God in flesh came himself to do this work didn't trust anybody else in it but he came to do it himself as he was the only one that could do it he was the lamb the sacrificial lamb that was to be sacrificed the only one sinless burn of a born of a virgin that could that could actually complete this work that had been that had begun nor did he begin it began in the Garden of Eden it began back in Genesis and Jesus was able to complete that part of that work what that ultimate sacrifice it was identified all through the Bible Paschal Lamb and so forth we know but it was completed when Jesus came himself and completed it and the work that was given him to finish he was able to finish it because he was the only one that could do it just like the works that God give each one of us that that we are able to do he did not entrust it with somebody else he did it himself it was the only way that it could be finished now we have a job to do we have a job to finish we have a part to play amen we have a part to play look at this a couple of scriptures here with this before I close in Philippians let me read this I got this one quote I want to read to you failed to print it out but I've got it here on my phone so bear with me just a moment it's what house will you build me a lot of you probably will recognize this but in finishing that work see look at this and finishing that work because we all have that work to finish and what house will you build me brother man was talking to the people what house you would build mean really if you've listened to it it's it's really more of a dedication talking a interaction brother branham to the congregation there it's brother green has opened the church they're here and tapped in Tucson for the people and for those to come and attend and brother Branham was there and dedicating the place he said now there was many people who followed me and that's not unusual usually a person we the people love one another and it love will drive you to do things you don't think you would do and many of that love will drive you see to do things you did not think that you would do if you love the Lord Jesus like we should it'll cause us to do things we never thought we would act in ways or give up things or be the way that we're supposed to be based on his word because we love him not cuz were scared of him it's like we talked about last week it's not a ruling of fear friend it's a ruling of love and of reverence and of respect and obedience see that's where God rules his children God we follow him because we love him not because we're scared he gonna send us to hell but because we love Him see but Vantage love will cause you to do things the right kind of love cause you to do things you didn't think you would do many of you left your homes you left all just Tuco come out here into this desert many has called me many has asked me shall we come to Arizona would it be a good place for us well as it was said I don't take this from us to summons and those who love living here but this is what he said many has asked me shall we come to Arizona give me a good place for us well as it was said all about Moses in them it was no place of fruit no place of pomegranate although I think brother Tamas Inc has got some nice pomegranates on a tree they got in their yard there but anyway no place to prove no place of pomegranate still not Moses of course here there is not much work to do and living is high and the cost of living is high it's really a rough place to live is Tucson Arizona wages are poor and food is high and rent it's a horrible place to live in that manner but it's healthy it's dry and we sometimes we mustn't get our minds fashioned on the things of this earth we must look to the leading of the Holy Spirit but one thing that troubled me and coming here and telling people what you should not calm or you should come that I leave up to each individual and the way that the Lord leads each individual to do I think every one of us should do that be led by the spirit on what to do many of you here are from around Jeffersonville the congregation there and you've come out here now the thing that bothered me was a place of worship and I realized as I read in the scripture here Stephen is addressed just before his death for they stone him immediately afterwards for his message he was speaking he said our fathers talking of Hebrews in the early days how that they tried to find favor for God to build a place of worship he said that Solomon built him a house or a building we are acquainted with the story which actually came the title of this message while house will you build me but I like his next words howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in houses that's made with hands in another place over an eye they said a body has thou prepared me see sacrifice offerings buildings so forth but a body has thought prepared me well we realized that we were that he was speaking then of the body where God tabernacle in Christ but look at this now so what I want to get to but I believe today that the question has come - brother green to move here him and sister green giving up their place back in the east also back in Texas to come here to start with nothing just simply by an inspiration feeling that they should do it I appreciate men that will follow the leading of Christ regardless of the cost it costs them amen god help us all to follow that leading of the Lord at whatever cost it may cost him God knows me and my wife at most a few times and do it based on what I feel or what we feel as a leading of the Lord and there's been a time then you know left a home and left my friends and left my family and except for sung and the kids and you know my immediate family mom sister Nana left a good job ahead for 10 years and all they go to a place I had no church had no building and no job had no money but God took care because he always takes care and sometimes I look and can see some of the results that God had just from obedience just obedience to his word I appreciate a man that will follow the leading of Christ regardless of the cost it cost them you know brother brother Greece just as he's sitting there listening to brother branham say this and he's thinking to himself is that what I did sometimes you don't even really know it for sure but you feel that you do something that you feel on your heart to do and that's just the Lord leading it that's the Lord leading and see God doesn't always come down with a baseball bat or come whisper in your ear give an audible voice it'll just be a slight unction something in your heart that God puts there and you know it's got doing it you don't realize the ramifications or what all's being involved in it but God is in control and all we have to do is what the Lord leads us and we feel that to do regardless of the cost that cost them though the whole world may be your very best friends think that you're wrong but it isn't wrong to you as long as you feel there is something behind it it's God moving you it's never wrong and it's onion and he'll always pan out right and it might not always be exactly what you thought or what other people may think or maybe not even pan out exactly immediately but when it reaches it's finished when it reaches its place of completion whatever that is you recognize and God will show and God recognized he was in it he was doing the leading it'll pan out right see God always bring it to the place that it needs to be as it comes forward to us now I want to go to this scriptures I had you turn to of Philippians and I had to say that to brother BAM said appreciate someone who will fill the leading of the Lord do what God leads them to do regardless of what the cost is God will lead us to it God will show us amen Philippians now now we got to understand we are the bride now I'm not just talking about me my wife our church family I'm talking about the bride internationally there's a bride worldwide there's those that God is called commission filled with the Holy Ghost internationally around the world we are that bride this bride has a responsibility it's like I said the other day when a man marries a wife he doesn't marry a wife and take her across the threshold of the house and sit down to couch well that's the end of it that's that was a great wedding well we'll have a nice marriage whoo we just said here no there's something to do there's always something to do there's there's there's things to be done the husband there's things to be done the wife the bride today God does his part it's our part - there's a part here on this earth that we have to do that we have to finish because this bright at this time is at the end we don't know how much time we've got left I think God gives us the time and I appreciate the time to be able to continue to do the work of the Lord whatever he calls us to do whatever he asked for us to do we want to do it we want to reach out to as many people as we can reach out to we want to try to help as many people as we can help we want to bring to Christ as many people as we possibly can if the Lord will just shine his grace upon us and help us to do it that's the time we have but we don't know how much time we have we don't know that but I do know that we're at the end and we do know we're at a rapture time whether will any of us be alive to see it or not we don't know whether I will we don't know but we know we're at the end we're at the end according to the scripture there's that endtime bride that has its part to play there's that alive and remain group that's going to have its part to play that's to complete this time because see once that Gentile bride goes in the rapture that's going to be the end of that dispensation of time of the gods working and dealing with the Gentile you'll go to the Jews then that'll be the finish of it then that Gentile bride and we're all at the wedding married marriage supper of the Lamb together with that table stretched thousands of miles long seed together having fellowship that'll be the finish the end of that well this bride has that part to play it's our part to play it's ours to do Philippians chapter 1 verse 3 look at this I thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the day from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he who is that he again just like Abraham had who is that me that's God amen he that begun which begun had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ or finish it complete it do it because he knows that you were able to do it you were able to finish you were able to complete what God had put on us to do when he began the work but look whose work it is is not my work it's not your work it's his work he has begun a good work he began the work in me he began it in me he began in you because knew that you were able to finish that work and he said that as I just said that you were able to do it but he says he began the good work he will perform that work well how does he perform it how does he do it how does he completed through us through this endtime bride that God has placed on this earth we had that part to play he started it so that makes it his work I've said that many times even about this church even about us our congregation and us together as a church as a congregation as a group of people I've said that many times is his work not mine not yours it's his work so if it's his work he's responsible for it if he's responsible that he's responsible for that that is a part of that work and we are all a part of that work if he's responsible that that is his responsibility to keep this work to the place where it is where he wants it to be and he's going to perform it or finish it or bring it to its completion whatever that is every work in us every work in this bride internationally that we're doing from the first church age when God began to deal with the Gentiles and poured out his spirit upon all flesh till today when God has reached to the place through the opening of the word and bringing its message and he himself coming in the Holy Spirit and putting himself in you and completing that work through you that he already determined his work his work that he'll finished he'll perform but he's doing it in me he's doing it in and he's found you faithful and worthy to be able to finish it to be able to do it it's God working through us it's our responsibility it's our duty it's our time God has given it to us count the cost are you able to finish it I've got a little midweek coming up this week I want you to listen to but talking about counterfeit a lot of counterfeit today a lot of counterfeit in the world today but again where there's counterfeit there's a regal there's a real you're the genuine and God has called you for that purpose God has called you for that reason I don't care how old you are God young you are I don't care how long you've been in faith how long you had the Holy Ghost whether you preach or whether you a male or female doesn't matter God has called you if God has called you the God is in you to complete that work to finish that work it's our responsibility to do there's people depending on us you know there's people depending on us in the scripture there's people depending on us look at this Hebrews I'm going to finish with this scripture but look in Hebrews chapter 11 we go to the faith chapter the last two verses it goes through all the history all the things the prophets and the great men and women in the Bible and and they're brought out in this great time of faith this great chapter of faith but at the end it shows the finishing part it began here and it began in faith see faith is the substance what brought him down on the day of Pentecost faith if they didn't have faith they would have scattered long before the Spirit came down if they didn't have faith to believe they would have never been there in the upper room they wouldn't have been there mulling over this thinking oh I I think it's coming I think we got it I think it's over I think what are we doing here why did we come here what is the purpose of all this then it said there they would have they would have disbanded but they have faith faith is a substance that was the beginning as it began it came through of course I talked about our time now it began with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden that it came through you see all these men of faith and Enoch and Abraham and know it you see all those men of faith and Rahab women of faith that come through the scripture it took faith and it comes down to the end and at the very end the last two chapters now it comes to a finish it's it's a closed in my opinion faith began in God said God said in the beginning let there be and there was that was the beginning remember it took faith for God to believe it when he said it he had faith to believe that what he spoke it was going to come forth faith is a substance well that began now at the end there's a finish what is that finish that finishes up to us that finishes in our hands look what it says Hebrews 11 39 look what it says and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise they didn't receive what is that promise that promises the completion the promise is the finishing of it the promise is the complete change not just the spirit change soul change I'm talking about I even a body change the completion of that promise see they did not receive that promise God have provided some better way some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect them without us the dependence is on us it's in our hands to finish this work it's in our hands to complete this have we counted the cost have you counted what it would take have we counted that it might cost our families have we counted that it might cost our best friends have we counted that it might that we might lose our moms dads families what have we counted that it might cost our job that we counted that it might cost our are our parties in whatever have we counted these things to realize to be able to finish this it's got to take someone that God has called and set aside and thus willing to be his servant and to be lived by his spirit to reach this place that us coming into this completion finishes that to the place of perfection those people are depending on us those people are waiting on us we're waiting we're depending we're trusting God to help them be with us and let this live through us so that we finished this work he's faithful at beginning he's faithful that finishes it through to us he's going to finish that work it's up to us it's our responsibility it's our time don't start something you can't finish amen it's that time that we that we finish this now this this has come to the end I hope and pray I'm here to see it happen I hope all of us are listening to be here today I hope we all are here to see this happen to be a part of this and to see that body changed in the moment and tweaking of an EIN go to beating the Lord so shall we ever be with him if we're not we'll still be there won't bear the other because those that have gone before will raise first but God has given us that time to finish this you know men men and women and godly people through their time they've done their part brother Branham did his part brother man did his part God took him home that's just part done and that's it a lot of people want to dig all that up and bring it back and and make him their pastor and marry them and things like that I don't agree with that because God has men of God today fill with the Holy Spirit to do that part if God stopped calling men to the gospel of Christ and to minister this and to bring this in the past story away and to marry into Barry and then this is over let's just forget it we'll just go home it's up to us to finish it brother branham did his part it's up to us to finish this bride this last day have we counted the cost have we understood what it was going to take to finish it a lot of people falling away today there probably be even a greater falling away maybe think of brother Billy power to pass away what might happen before the rapture save Billy Paul passes away mine and all the things has been said all these years about California sinking it will sink shark swimming through the door of the bait company and all those they said and it will happen I believe it just don't know when that's up to God I know I'm not the interpreter of that dream or that vision that's up to God God's wonders father bring that forth I'm just responsible for bringing forth the gospel believing in finishing this work but what if it were to happen how many people would leave at that point there's great been been many people leave but there's gonna be a bride there's going to be a genuine there's gonna be a true a real that's gonna stand counter the cost and realize what it takes and understands what the cost is and is willing to pay that price at whatever it might be you know things happen in our lives some of its traumatic some of it's hard some of it'll send you to your knees that's where we should be anyway but God has a way of bringing into that place for all of us to grow stronger closer to him and more like him amen when you're broken there's nobody I know better to take the pieces and put them all back together exactly the way they're supposed to be when you're lost there's no one I know of better that can find you than Jesus Christ he's the only one and he brings it and when he does it he makes it all work perfect amen you know when we do a jigsaw puzzle we take all the pieces and we put them all where they look like they go and they make this great picture and it looks just like the picture on the box and it's beautiful picture but if you look at it you still see all the scenes and everything if where all these pieces were put together and all but you know what God puts it all together he makes the picture complete there's no more scenes to say over here was a piece over here was a piece not just it just makes it all nice and smooth it just looks like a beautiful picture it all completes itself exactly right when you look in it and it reflects Jesus Christ amen that's the point he wants it to be I believe that's where we all want it to be amen but make sure that we count the cost first don't just say oh I'm a Christian oh I believe the message well that's all fine and good but there's a whole lot more to it than just that are we willing to to do what it takes to bring it to the end I'm thankful there were men and women back to over 200 years ago that were willing to pay the price they're willing to count the cost I'm thankful there was a man named William Marion Branham who was willing to pay the price and to date the cost of whatever N and medon Brenham who probably had to deal with as much or more than he did through it all who was willing to pay the price the cost that it would take to go through all that to bring this message to bring this word to a bride to be so willing and so yielded that God could use that man to a place that people were given their lives back and this word but the word came and thank God that he was willing to bring that word so that we can have it today and the moving of the Holy Spirit to instruct him to put that word and tape and put that word in the book and put that in his food in the storehouse so that we can go to that storehouse today and we can consume it ourselves I wasn't there never heard it live but I can still consume it today I'm thankful there was somebody willing to do that and I pray that we today are in the position that we understand the cost and willing pay the price now there's things down the road that may happen that we don't know about I mean when when we were just coming I was just coming back to the Lord my wife giving her heart to the Lord we had no idea wanting to start a family that Lord was going to take our first son we don't know those things sometimes they're down the road but we do know that I'm willing that we're willing to do whatever it takes for whatever it costs were willing to do it help us to do it amen it's a call today that your heart's desire and I believe that's where God will take it and use it at someone that God could use brother Bannon always said several times he said if God could just give one man who was willing in his complete control he could turn this world upside down it's got to be a willing subject amen gotta be a willing subject praise the Lord - god bless you pray something was said to bless you and help you today amen Lord willing next week we'll probably still stream just Aaron on the side of caution probably stream I've talked to the hotel after that Lord willing we'll see try to find the mind of the Lord if everything seems right then and we'll probably go back to the Holiday Inn but we'll see whatever the Lord has for us and we'll we'll go down that road I don't want to knock down any doors but I want to walk through the door said he opens for us I want to force anything but I don't want to miss anything the Lord my half-horse - and on that light I don't think I ever mentioned to you that I can't remember now but just for a moment I did talk to the pastor voice of God fellowship on Prince Romero and their facility is too large for us they have two units not just one their rent is way beyond what we could afford so that not that and they weren't merging actually either that they've been having services together but not necessarily technically merging as the two churches into one but they haven't been using their facility because the COBE thing and everything so but it wouldn't work for us anyway under those circumstances so I just thought I'd let you know that but we do want to walk through the door that the Lord opens for us amen so appreciate each one of you being here today pray the Lord richly bless you we'll just dismiss some word prayer now to bow our heads Lord Jesus father we thank you again for speaking to us from your word Lord from taking this little lesson father that you put on my heart to hopefully help us God and to help us understand what it takes to reach the finalization of this of this life of this word of living for you and being your disciple Lord it's more than just saying we're a disciple when Jesus told those multitudes of people he chose 12 that was his hand-picked chosen 12 but when all this multitude was following he looked at him and said do you realize what you're doing do you understand what cost it may cost you to follow me it's not easy sometimes Lord but you're always there with us we thank you Father for blessing us thank you for speaking to us today help us to be ready lord help us to be stable and ready and and in the position to move forward in the in the place that you'd have us to be and go lord I pray that you bless those from the hook-up today lest our congregation bless and move upon every request again I pray Lord that your hand of mercy would be on them and bless and strengthen them in a special way we thank you God for this country the purging and all that's going through Lord we know we're at the end times but thank you Lord to still be in a place a country where we can call on your name and we can speak about you and have this way of streaming Lord that God you would be glorified magnified in all that we do and say thank you Lord for your people thank you for this ability to be able to stream and for all that you've given and done for us bless us through the week now Lord we if you could continue to tarry as we commit ourselves our lives our families homeless into your hands we asking your blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and God richly bless you till next week
