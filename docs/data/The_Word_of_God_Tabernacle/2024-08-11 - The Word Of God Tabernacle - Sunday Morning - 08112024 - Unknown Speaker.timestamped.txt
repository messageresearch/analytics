[30:07] I had to ditch her this morning because
[30:09] I come to church way earlier than she
[30:11] does so uh I told Mike I told Joel he's
[30:15] going to have to be the man of the house
[30:16] so uh help s in every way he can so uh
[30:20] she U Ruth still getting used to being
[30:23] in church so she was plan on coming a
[30:26] little maybe halfway through song
[30:27] service so they should be here shortly
[30:29] but Zach and tabith are still in Phoenix
[30:31] uh enjoying their anniversary trip so
[30:35] pray that the Lord just bless them and
[30:36] bring them back home safe U they
[30:39] actually happened to be in the hotel
[30:40] yesterday in Phoenix downtown Phoenix
[30:43] where the Camala Harris was uh of all
[30:47] the places of all the times um they pull
[30:50] in and they stop them and they searched
[30:52] their car and uh why are you here and
[30:55] got a reservation and secur
[30:58] uh
[31:01] uh figures i'
[31:04] forg security the Secret Service secret
[31:07] service thank you uh Secret Service cars
[31:10] everywhere so anyway they finally got
[31:13] there and they sound like they were
[31:14] enjoying their time alone last night so
[31:17] uh just pray for them the Lord would
[31:18] just bless them but Tabitha did have
[31:20] requests that she had mentioned uh this
[31:23] week a couple of them uh one was a young
[31:26] uh well was a young was her age a boy
[31:29] that went to school with her up in
[31:31] pintop at Blue Ridge um boy's name is
[31:35] Drew cook uh was in her class in fifth
[31:38] and sixth grade and he died uh this last
[31:42] week uh apparently she doesn't know
[31:45] exactly but apparently it was a job
[31:48] related injury death uh because she's
[31:52] only 30 years old had three children and
[31:55] was engaged to be married um uh so uh
[31:59] please pray for them if you would
[32:00] especially the young ones she found a
[32:02] picture of the um uh somewhere
[32:07] online uh about it all and uh just some
[32:12] cute little kids so uh please pray for
[32:14] them if you would the Lord his name is
[32:16] Drew cook I don't know uh the others but
[32:20] the Lord knows so just please remember
[32:22] them in prayer if you would she also
[32:24] sent me one earlier this week um
[32:28] that I had forgotten about and asked her
[32:31] to remind me when I got home because
[32:32] course I was working this week and she
[32:34] text me I was still working uh but
[32:38] anyway uh it was a woman to see let me
[32:40] just read it to you it probably be
[32:41] easier she said I just met this is tap
[32:44] also she said I just met in a weird way
[32:46] on the modest children's page an older
[32:49] lady who is 70 she's battling bone
[32:52] cancer and in the hospital uh she says
[32:55] which is just really I mean it's kind of
[32:59] strange to meet a 7-year-old on A's
[33:01] child's page who was in the hospital
[33:03] battling bone cancer so you know me I
[33:08] don't believe in coincidence right uh so
[33:10] there there somehow the Lord hooked tap
[33:13] up with this lady U she's had bone
[33:16] cancer in the hospital didn't say where
[33:19] don't know if she's in Tucson or local
[33:21] or where she is she was met her on the
[33:23] internet like I said mon children page
[33:25] uh she says she's on morphine and
[33:28] Norco 10s three times a day does that
[33:32] make sense I don't
[33:34] know she's on morphine and whatever
[33:37] Norco is it says 10s that could be a
[33:40] typo three times a day anyway sounds bad
[33:45] uh so please remember her just she
[33:47] didn't give a name uh but taba said my
[33:50] heart just went out to her and I told
[33:52] her that I would be praying for her and
[33:54] then
[33:55] Tabitha wanted me to ask us called to
[33:58] pray for her too um the good part about
[34:01] this is God knows who's this woman is
[34:04] yes and knows her name and knows why her
[34:07] and taba got connected together uh so
[34:11] taba asked me to ask everyone if they
[34:13] would pray for her and uh so please do
[34:16] if you would pray for this lady don't
[34:18] know her name but anyway the Lord knows
[34:20] so praise the Lord that's all the
[34:23] request I have I'm not sure where others
[34:25] are let's of course continue remember
[34:27] Sister sister Pat sister Karen uh
[34:30] battling some chronic illnesses uh don't
[34:33] see AR sh please pray for them and
[34:36] sister Julie
[34:37] and amen so but we're here we're
[34:41] thankful to be here soen you have any
[34:43] unspoken request on your heart Lord amen
[34:47] I stand to
[34:49] our we just take these to the Lord today
[34:53] and ask brother Dennis if you would

[45:26] thankful father again of the blessings
[45:28] and love that you give us thank you Lord
[45:30] that you give us this place and time

[45:38] is so near god it feels so precious to
[45:41] know God that you are so mindful of us
[45:43] you love us Lord and you give of
[45:45] yourself to us and Lord so many things
[45:47] that we know of even that that that
[45:50] would even come against our natural
[45:53] Humanity our natural carnality and
[45:55] spirit Lord but God you give us the
[45:58] ability the way to be able to overcome
[46:00] all of those things and to and to bring
[46:02] into us God the pure nature of Jesus
[46:06] Christ and the the spirit of the fruits
[46:09] and uh the attributes that go with it
[46:11] Lord we thank you so much for being able
[46:14] to be a partaker lord of that divine
[46:16] nature and being a partaker of your
[46:19] kingdom to be one of them Lord God it
[46:21] means so much to us Lord to know that
[46:24] you have made us mold us shaped us us
[46:27] into your image and before the
[46:28] foundation of the world placed in us God
[46:31] that life Lord put your put our names on
[46:35] the Lamb's Book of Life the book that
[46:38] could never be removed yes thank you

[46:43] it's been revealed God that we know who
[46:46] we are thank you Lord for watching over
[46:48] us and keeping us through the week Lord
[46:50] we come to this place now turning back
[46:53] the pages of this beautiful wonderful R
[46:56] this Bible Lord that we have God this
[46:59] letter Lord that we can read and learn
[47:01] of you and that you could speak to us
[47:03] through it's such a blessing Lord to
[47:05] know God it's not just a textbook that
[47:09] we can read out of a school Lord but
[47:11] it's a it's a living letter it's a
[47:13] living word that lives to us through us
[47:17] and in us thank you God for it Lord we
[47:20] just commit the remaining part of this
[47:22] service to you Lord have your way in it
[47:24] may your Holy Spirit God be pleased with
[47:27] all that is said and done here now as we
[47:29] commit it to you speak to us Lord hear
[47:31] through our ears speak through our lips
[47:33] that what you desire to be accomplished
[47:35] in this service today the purpose you
[47:37] set it for before the foundation of the
[47:39] world would be accomplished Lord in this
[47:41] place right here today we commit it to
[47:43] you now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:45] Christ we pray amen amen amen second
[47:49] Peter chapter 1 uh we'll begin reading
[47:51] with verse five verse five and besides
[47:54] this giving all diligence add to your
[47:57] faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and to
[48:00] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[48:02] patience and to patience godliness and
[48:05] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[48:07] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[48:10] things be in you and abound they make
[48:14] you that you should neither be Barren
[48:16] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[48:18] Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these
[48:22] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[48:25] and have forgotten that he was first
[48:27] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[48:30] Brethren give diligence to make your
[48:31] calling and election sure for if you do
[48:34] these things you shall never fall amen
[48:37] praise the Lord you can be seated if
[48:39] You'
[48:40] like I really like that last scripture
[48:43] there or that last
[48:45] verse amen if you do these things you
[48:47] shall never fall praise the Lord I'm so
[48:50] glad of that amen so thankful to the
[48:52] Lord that word just means so much if you
[48:55] look at it as PR to us I know we all
[48:58] know this but I fig I'll bring it up a
[49:00] little easier to see as we go through
[49:02] we're just going to do probably get into
[49:04] two today Temperance and patience uh if
[49:07] we could go back to those now uh I want
[49:10] to go into uh uh uh Temperance we went
[49:14] through faith of course and then uh
[49:16] virtue and then knowledge last week and
[49:19] uh we kind of stopped of course we were
[49:21] right at about an hour anyway so we just
[49:22] stopped it there to get into Temperance
[49:25] patience kind of bring these two
[49:26] together maybe a little bit they each
[49:28] stand on their own but they are also uh
[49:31] each sort of intertwined if you will of
[49:34] how Temperance and patience work
[49:36] together now there's a couple of
[49:37] different now again like uh several of
[49:41] these other attributes uh Temperance
[49:43] kind of has two different uh meanings to
[49:47] it uh two different ways when you look
[49:49] at the the root word temper or when you
[49:53] add uh or when you take temper and make
[49:57] it
[49:58] temperate uh make something temperate
[50:01] that means it's tempered it means it's
[50:03] hardened uh when you add temp uh uh
[50:06] Temperance to it that that is uh uh that
[50:10] is something that uh uh is not who you
[50:14] are necessarily if you say uh I I am
[50:17] tempered or or I'm temperate that's a
[50:20] noun uh to have Temperance is something
[50:23] that you express uh something that shows
[50:26] from you amen it shows whether you are
[50:29] temperate it shows whether you do have
[50:32] temper or not amen uh mostly what we
[50:36] look at as far as Temperance is
[50:37] concerned is
[50:40] self-control uh being able to hold your
[50:42] tongue or control your temper uh don't
[50:46] fly off and get angry when you're uh
[50:49] when when maybe you're even spoken badly
[50:52] about uh when uh you have the ability or
[50:56] the sweetness to be able to uh speak
[50:59] good about someone who has spoke bad
[51:01] about you um uh temper is also uh uh the
[51:07] ability to be able to uh have
[51:12] someone not fly off when someone speaks
[51:15] bad about you which of course goes also
[51:17] into the patience be able to uh to have
[51:21] patience to control yourself but uh
[51:23] Temperance also means to be sober yes uh
[51:27] temperer uh means to be uh to be to to
[51:31] be tempered means to be able to con
[51:34] control your anger uh but to temper
[51:38] something also means to solidify it uh
[51:41] someone who is solidified or hardened if
[51:44] you will um uh something that is
[51:48] tempered uh when when uh extreme heat uh
[51:53] or or or or trials if you will uh if
[51:56] Trials come or heavy uh persecution or
[51:59] something comes when the heat comes on
[52:02] uh something that is that really is
[52:06] tempered doesn't just melt away uh it
[52:10] doesn't lose its temper uh a piece of
[52:13] metal uh can be hardened to a place and
[52:16] they have different levels of hardening
[52:20] uh probably should let brother Pat give
[52:21] this lesson more than me being the
[52:23] mechanic that he SP his whole life but
[52:25] um there's temp there's different levels
[52:28] of temperance even of metals you got
[52:31] really soft Metals you got aluminums and
[52:33] stuff like that and things that are a
[52:35] lot softer some that you could Bend I
[52:37] mean uh it used to be before I
[52:41] completely quit soda uh I would I would
[52:44] drink a soda on the plane and then i'
[52:46] just take it twist it and crush it down
[52:47] with my hands it's that soft uh thin of
[52:51] course but soft and you know something
[52:53] that's not tempered as hard I couldn't
[52:55] do that with a piece of iron
[52:57] or something it's a metal that's really
[52:58] hardened like a like a metal IE beam of
[53:01] a building or something you go above
[53:04] these uh uh these ceiling tiles you see
[53:06] there's metal beams that go across those
[53:08] are hardened they are tempered to the
[53:11] point that it Tak something extremely
[53:14] extremely hot to try to to to cause that
[53:19] uh metal to lose its temper uh so you
[53:23] see so when we get to the place that by
[53:26] the Holy Spirit it we have it we we are
[53:29] tempered to the place that we we become
[53:33] uh I hate to say the word Harden but
[53:35] that's basically what it is uh you
[53:37] become so hardened that uh this this it
[53:41] doesn't really matter the heat can come
[53:43] uh the heat can be applied the
[53:45] tribulations can come the trials can hit
[53:47] you but you're so tempered that you
[53:50] don't just melt and lose your temper uh
[53:54] that's where the whole thing comes from
[53:56] uh to have Temperance is to be able to
[53:59] hold yourself now uh you could probably
[54:02] put a simple match to a an aluminum can
[54:05] and it would start to lose its disc lose
[54:08] its color or something but a metal ibeam
[54:11] or something that's really tempered hard
[54:14] that really is solid it won't it it
[54:16] takes something extreme it takes
[54:19] something really hot hot white hot to
[54:22] cause it to melt amen like smelters like
[54:25] they use have smelters like uh that men
[54:29] used to do with horseshoeing uh when
[54:31] they used to do horseshoes for their for
[54:33] their horses that' have to have those
[54:35] things so hard you couldn't have a a
[54:37] soft metal and see uh you got so many
[54:41] people that are like that uh you've got
[54:43] some people that are just to the place
[54:45] and and I don't mean so hard as to when
[54:49] I say that I don't mean to be unfriendly
[54:51] uh I don't mean somebody because we use
[54:53] that word too to say well somebody's
[54:55] just hard that just means they're kind
[54:58] of unfriendly and brass and uh like the
[55:02] Crogan type they're just the hard just a
[55:05] hard guy it's hard to get along with
[55:07] that kind I don't mean that but someone
[55:09] who has gotten themselves tempered to by
[55:11] the Holy Spirit tempered to the place
[55:13] that the little trials the little
[55:16] tribulations the little struggles and
[55:18] things don't don't send them flying off
[55:21] the wheel it doesn't cause them to lose
[55:23] their temper it doesn't cause them to
[55:25] get upset and to get mad and to lose
[55:28] their temper and and and and and all
[55:30] that c but you've got different levels
[55:33] now some people uh usually more younger
[55:36] Christian uh that's less mature might
[55:39] fly off the handle of something that's
[55:41] just simple something that's not uh
[55:44] doesn't really mean a whole lot or when
[55:46] the Trials come or the tribulation hits
[55:49] or something like that you lose your
[55:52] patience and your temper and you fly off
[55:54] the handle say things you shouldn't and
[55:57] act in ways you shouldn't and uh present
[55:59] yourself to people in ways that you s
[56:02] you shouldn't and some people that you
[56:04] profess to be a Christian to look at you
[56:05] and say well that person says they're a
[56:08] Christian and look how they're acting
[56:10] see right amen but someone who is Harden
[56:12] someone who has that Temperance that
[56:15] doesn't lose their self-control just at
[56:18] the fly of a uh F FL to handle that easy
[56:22] just uh something simple they are
[56:25] tempered they they've been tempered
[56:27] they've been hardened they've been
[56:29] they've been brought to the place that
[56:31] they uh uh that that that they can stand
[56:33] the test you amen that they can stand
[56:36] the test and not just melt or lose their
[56:39] temper Temperance is also uh sober to be
[56:44] sober to be a person that's sober now
[56:46] sober is of course A lot of times if you
[56:49] say the word sober in today's society
[56:51] you're talking about someone that's just
[56:52] not been drinking alcohol uh that's
[56:55] usually the way it is but sober in the
[56:57] scripture doesn't refer to that sober in
[57:00] the scripture just basically means
[57:03] levelheaded uh someone who is moderate
[57:06] someone who is not they don't fly off
[57:08] the handle either way see so in the
[57:10] scripture when it talks about someone
[57:12] being sober it talks about the women
[57:15] being sober it means that there to be uh
[57:18] someone that's able to teach and to be
[57:20] levelheaded and and to have uh their uh
[57:24] their faculties in in in hand that that
[57:28] their emotions don't get the best of
[57:30] them they're they're sober and in the
[57:33] world it you know it's something totally
[57:35] different but Temperance to be uh uh to
[57:39] be self-controlled now I have a
[57:42] scripture a couple scriptures I want to
[57:44] read amen the first I have that I have
[57:47] printed out here and then I have another
[57:48] we will go to in the scripture but the
[57:50] first one I want to read is Romans
[57:51] chapter 12 Romans chapter 12 to talk
[57:55] about this
[58:02] amen praise the
[58:06] Lord
[58:10] amen Romans 12 verse4 look at this
[58:14] now the these two are some very uh exuse
[58:20] me but sobering
[58:22] scriptures uh
[58:24] they're the these next two scriptures
[58:27] I'm going to read are scriptures that
[58:31] probably are as much that great against
[58:34] the flesh is any Scripture that we have
[58:37] amen that war against our flesh as much
[58:40] as any Scripture let's read Romans
[58:43] 12:14 bless them which persecute
[58:48] you now that's not human that's not
[58:51] human you you don't pray for people that
[58:54] persecute you people don't normally do
[58:56] people don't normally bless or help
[58:58] those that persecute you and curse
[59:01] not rejoice with them that do rejoice
[59:05] and weep with them that weep be of the
[59:08] same mind one one toward another mind
[59:12] not high things but uh condescend to Men
[59:16] of lowest State be not wise in your own
[59:21] conceits recompense to no man evil for
[59:25] evils so when someone's Reckoning evil
[59:28] to you you don't return evil to that
[59:30] person right amen you don't return evil
[59:34] for evil that's not the way of the Lord
[59:36] that's not the way of Christ provide
[59:38] things honest in the sight of all men
[59:42] when people see this what do they think
[59:44] about amen especially if you're a
[59:47] professing Christian which we all are
[59:50] professing Christians and people look at
[59:52] you you know as well as I do when you're
[59:53] a professing Christian you're under
[59:56] under a microscope 24/7 yes amen no
[59:59] matter where you are or who you're with
[1:00:01] even your family your spouse your
[1:00:04] co-workers uh the wherever people that
[1:00:07] know you you're professing Christian
[1:00:08] you're under a microscope amen so that's
[1:00:12] why I said we live this way because we
[1:00:15] live the to exude Christ in Our Lives
[1:00:19] who lived this life before us as an
[1:00:21] example 18th verse
[1:00:24] now if it be possible as much as lith in
[1:00:28] you live peaceably with all
[1:00:33] men that that's kind of given as much
[1:00:36] levity as you could get I guess if it's
[1:00:39] possible and as much as you possibly can
[1:00:42] right live peaceably with all men amen
[1:00:46] one that's maybe a little tempered might
[1:00:49] be able to a little easier someone who's
[1:00:51] not quite as tempered or temperate
[1:00:53] wouldn't be able to do that they would
[1:00:55] get FL the handle get angry mad dearly
[1:00:59] 19th verse dearly beloved avenge not
[1:01:01] yourselves but rather give Place unto
[1:01:04] wrath for it is written vengeance is
[1:01:07] mine saith Newton Bennett oh no wait a
[1:01:11] minute did I miss that I got that wrong
[1:01:13] didn't I vengeance is mine I will repay
[1:01:18] saith the Lord right amen so it's not my
[1:01:22] place to execute evil for evil right to
[1:01:27] execute judgment on someone who's done
[1:01:29] me wrong bless those that persecute you
[1:01:34] amen Vengeance Belongs to the Lord it
[1:01:37] does not belong to Us Praise the Lord
[1:01:40] that's a hard one to understand uh maybe
[1:01:43] a hard one to give in because it greats
[1:01:46] against the flesh but that's the
[1:01:48] scripture Vengeance belongs to God
[1:01:50] doesn't belong to us amen there's going
[1:01:52] to be um I I was I'm I'm I'm trying to
[1:01:57] Lord he brought this to my attention for
[1:01:59] some reason I hadn't thought of this in
[1:02:02] years
[1:02:04] but I had a brother one time I'm trying
[1:02:07] to help me Lord to say this without
[1:02:10] getting detailed or anything I had a
[1:02:12] brother one
[1:02:14] time uh did
[1:02:17] something and I went to that brother and
[1:02:19] I said you ought not have done
[1:02:22] that and he gave some excuse later on he
[1:02:26] called
[1:02:27] me and he said and he apologized to me I
[1:02:30] said you don't no apologize to me what
[1:02:32] he did wasn't against me I was just
[1:02:34] there when he did it I saw him do it and
[1:02:37] but he apologized to me and he said uh
[1:02:42] you know uh please don't tell some and
[1:02:45] so or please don't do this or do this
[1:02:47] whatever you know to try to R things up
[1:02:51] or uh to try to get him in trouble if
[1:02:54] you will and and I said brother I said
[1:02:58] if there's any correction or if there's
[1:03:01] any judgment or if there's any uh light
[1:03:04] or anything that needs to be done God's
[1:03:06] going to do it not me amen I I don't do
[1:03:09] that I I don't go it's been done to me a
[1:03:12] lot over and over again but I don't do
[1:03:15] that I I don't believe any Christian
[1:03:17] should do that uh I hope I try uh I'm
[1:03:22] not saying I've never done it I try to
[1:03:24] hold my tongue and say that that is if
[1:03:27] and I I literally told the brother I
[1:03:29] said if there's anything if there's any
[1:03:31] correction needs to be done God's going
[1:03:32] to do it not me right that's up to him
[1:03:35] not me amen and of course I I I never
[1:03:38] did I never did say anything but um I
[1:03:42] don't know whatever happened or come I
[1:03:44] have no idea but that's between him and
[1:03:47] God it's not involved me I just happen
[1:03:49] to be there and saw what happened but
[1:03:51] you understand it's not our job it's not
[1:03:54] my position to to execute that judgment
[1:03:57] on that person it's not my job to go
[1:03:59] tattletail about this person and to try
[1:04:02] to make them look bad in front of
[1:04:04] somebody or something like that that's
[1:04:05] that's I don't want to do that I first I
[1:04:07] don't want to do that and first it's not
[1:04:09] my position to do that I I don't it's
[1:04:13] not it's not in my heart I'm not saying
[1:04:16] I've never done it but it's not in my
[1:04:18] heart to try to make someone look bad in
[1:04:20] front of someone else right it just it's
[1:04:23] just not me I just don't like doing that
[1:04:24] I don't like it done to me and it's been
[1:04:26] done many times um but I don't like it
[1:04:29] done to me I don't I try not to do it to
[1:04:31] anybody else and a lot of times I try to
[1:04:34] follow that life
[1:04:36] principle uh if I don't want it done to
[1:04:38] me then I try not to do it to anybody
[1:04:40] else seems like the world's really
[1:04:42] gotten away from that even in even in
[1:04:45] Christian realm but it's still a a
[1:04:48] founding principle I think everyone of
[1:04:49] us should be able to follow amen uh to
[1:04:52] be able to hold our tongue see the
[1:04:53] temperance would do that don't tongue to
[1:04:56] not try to exact Vengeance on somebody
[1:04:59] that's job that's God's job God there's
[1:05:00] not anything that goes on that God
[1:05:02] doesn't know about there's nothing said
[1:05:04] there's nothing thought there's nothing
[1:05:06] done that God doesn't know about so he
[1:05:08] knows about it if it needs to be done
[1:05:10] then he'll do it right amen let him do
[1:05:13] it not me that's up that's God's choice
[1:05:15] now people say well maybe God's going to
[1:05:18] use you to do it well he's gonna have to
[1:05:20] really come and give me a Stern talking
[1:05:23] to uh for me to do that because I don't
[1:05:25] I just don't do I don't think it should
[1:05:27] be done person amen other ways that God
[1:05:30] can do God God gives men gifts and
[1:05:33] visions and prophecies and there's all
[1:05:36] kinds of ways that that that can be
[1:05:38] known without me going and tattletail on
[1:05:40] something but it's not that that's not
[1:05:42] our position amen Vengeance doesn't
[1:05:44] belong to us Vengeance Belongs to the
[1:05:46] Lord let him execute it amen I will
[1:05:50] repay sayth the Lord 20th verse now
[1:05:53] therefore if thine enemy hung hunger
[1:05:56] feed
[1:05:57] him
[1:05:59] amen he's got a flat to on the side of
[1:06:01] the road don't BL past him and say it
[1:06:03] serves him
[1:06:04] right
[1:06:07] amen don't Flow by him with a flat tire
[1:06:10] say well that serves him right you know
[1:06:12] he's he's not what he says he is you
[1:06:13] know all kind of excuses no no no uhuh
[1:06:16] that's not that's not what we do
[1:06:17] therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him
[1:06:21] feed him help him be there for him amen
[1:06:24] I might not be a a a person that I may
[1:06:27] have given
[1:06:28] opportunity uh uh to to be friends with
[1:06:32] or to be there for them or whatever um
[1:06:35] uh and continually
[1:06:38] get well I guess for lack of better
[1:06:40] phraseology stabbed in the back um or
[1:06:44] unedifying there's just some people uh
[1:06:47] that I find that are unedifying to me
[1:06:51] and no matter usually when I'm around
[1:06:53] them or try to be friends or something
[1:06:56] like that it just comes around to the
[1:06:58] place that that person drags me down
[1:07:00] spiritually I'm not going to hang around
[1:07:02] with that person right I'm not going to
[1:07:04] be best friends with that person am uh
[1:07:06] if that person said something about me
[1:07:08] or done something or whatever that's
[1:07:09] that's between them and the Lord right
[1:07:12] uh but if they need help I'll be there
[1:07:14] to help them they need to be prayed for
[1:07:16] something I I'd be I'll absolutely do
[1:07:19] anything I could to be there for them
[1:07:20] but I'm not going to be their bus buy
[1:07:22] been down that road and it's not been
[1:07:24] helpful right is not been edifying and
[1:07:27] God God always wants us to help others
[1:07:32] uh but not to the detriment of yourself
[1:07:35] right amen we're not supposed to give to
[1:07:38] the point that becomes a detriment to us
[1:07:41] yes amen that's when when we start
[1:07:43] falling spiritually then and and it
[1:07:45] becomes unedifying that's when you got
[1:07:48] to re-evaluate and say this is just not
[1:07:50] working that's right and there's people
[1:07:52] in my life through my life my Christian
[1:07:55] life that I've had to I guess for back
[1:07:58] lack of better word cut off uh and just
[1:08:02] not really be friends with anymore
[1:08:03] because they're just not edifying of my
[1:08:05] life they're not helpful they're not
[1:08:07] beneficial and uh it's not but again to
[1:08:11] help them would do anything to in the
[1:08:13] world to help them right Amen to be
[1:08:15] there for them and that's what the
[1:08:16] scripture says if he's hungry feed him
[1:08:19] if he thirst give him drink for in doing
[1:08:22] so Thou shalt heat uh coals of fire on
[1:08:25] his head
[1:08:26] what that just shows who's the person in
[1:08:28] the wrong and you don't do do it for
[1:08:31] that purpose amen but that's that's the
[1:08:34] scripture that's how it comes be not
[1:08:36] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[1:08:39] good amen that's how we overcome evil
[1:08:42] with good right it's the best way to be
[1:08:45] able to overcome evil is with good now
[1:08:47] got another scripture I want to read
[1:08:48] about this and that all goes in line of
[1:08:51] course with being
[1:08:53] temperate being able able to be kind to
[1:08:56] someone that is mean to you being able
[1:08:59] to speak softly or uh to to squel wrath
[1:09:04] whenever uh someone brings wrath at you
[1:09:08] you you you stop it an answer answer
[1:09:12] kindly when you're spoken horribly to
[1:09:16] amen yes
[1:09:18] uh sometimes you may have to turn around
[1:09:21] and walk
[1:09:22] away and just not even be a part of the
[1:09:24] conversation
[1:09:26] but it all comes down to having uh being
[1:09:30] tempered and understanding that those
[1:09:33] names don't bother you that
[1:09:36] tribulation uh doesn't bother you that
[1:09:40] trial uh is like the proverbial water on
[1:09:44] the Ducks back uh you stay strong and
[1:09:47] solid and steady and firm you don't melt
[1:09:51] you don't lose your temper amen you stay
[1:09:54] firm and solid that
[1:09:55] that's the that's the attribute of the
[1:09:57] Holy Spirit just think of the things
[1:10:00] that Jesus how many examples would we
[1:10:02] have read of scripture this morning of
[1:10:04] Jesus when he went through those things
[1:10:06] right wanting to Stone him and calling
[1:10:08] him all kind and the only thing that
[1:10:10] Jesus came to do was to help people only
[1:10:14] reason he was here is to be good and to
[1:10:17] give and to heal and to be a blessing
[1:10:20] and to and to speak to people to help
[1:10:23] them come along and to and and to
[1:10:26] enhance their lives and and and their
[1:10:28] life beyond this life that's all he ever
[1:10:31] came for and all people did a lot of
[1:10:33] people is just hated him and spit on him
[1:10:37] and laughed at him and threw rocks at
[1:10:40] him and how many t two or three times in
[1:10:43] the scripture Jesus had to just simply
[1:10:45] disappear and go to another place so
[1:10:48] they couldn't even find him because they
[1:10:50] were going to kill him right amen so if
[1:10:54] if he was to that place and it was him
[1:10:57] that did that then what does that speak
[1:10:59] to us the Holy Spirit living in US amen
[1:11:03] how we should act now let's go over to
[1:11:05] Matthew Chapter
[1:11:12] 5 Lord help us let these
[1:11:16] things present themselves uh manifest
[1:11:19] themselves out of our Lives let these
[1:11:22] attributes be a part of our life
[1:11:25] everything from the faith virtue
[1:11:27] knowledge Temperance Amen to be able to
[1:11:31] those attributes live through us let us
[1:11:35] be able to say that we are the providers
[1:11:38] of these attributes Amen to its
[1:11:41] completeness to their fullness to their
[1:11:44] perfection amen
[1:11:46] amen praise the
[1:11:48] Lord because it's it's easy to it's a
[1:11:51] lot easier to have Temperance with
[1:11:53] someone that you're friends with or
[1:11:55] someone that you love or someone you're
[1:11:57] close to than it is maybe a total
[1:11:59] stranger or someone that pretends to be
[1:12:01] it really
[1:12:03] isn't it's easier to lose your hand lose
[1:12:06] your temper in a situation like that
[1:12:09] amen but
[1:12:12] um every one of us have our have those
[1:12:17] triggers that we try to keep protected
[1:12:20] amen again like we said that that the
[1:12:22] devil knows those the devil knows those
[1:12:25] places we got to keep them covered
[1:12:27] Matthew Chapter 5 now let's uh let's
[1:12:30] just start with verse
[1:12:33] 43 Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it
[1:12:38] hath been said now I'd like to know who
[1:12:41] said it but the scripture doesn't
[1:12:44] say but it hath been said Jesus said
[1:12:47] these are the words of Jesus of course
[1:12:49] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:12:51] thine enemy now I've heard that
[1:12:55] Jesus said you have heard amen and I
[1:12:58] know I have heard it I heard that
[1:13:00] growing up when I was a kid before I
[1:13:04] became a Christian I was B it was
[1:13:07] basically taught to me not in a school
[1:13:11] or but just what I learned by watching
[1:13:13] other people's actions that I was to uh
[1:13:17] Love My Enemy uh love my neighbor but
[1:13:19] hate my enemy right that's what I was
[1:13:22] always in the world and that's what the
[1:13:24] world teach teaches you amen the world
[1:13:26] basically teaches you love your neighbor
[1:13:28] or love those you're friends with
[1:13:30] buddies whatever and hate your
[1:13:32] enemies amen so we have permission to
[1:13:35] hate our enemies well no we don't but I
[1:13:38] say unto you Jesus said love your
[1:13:43] enemies bless them that curse you do
[1:13:48] good to them that hate you and pray for
[1:13:52] them which despitefully use you and
[1:13:55] persecute you now that's
[1:13:58] hard I mean friend that that's not
[1:14:01] something that the normal human produces
[1:14:04] on a daily basis it just doesn't happen
[1:14:07] this is something that comes out from a
[1:14:10] Christian a holy ghost filled Christian
[1:14:14] is someone that is able to love their
[1:14:16] enemies literally love them amen and
[1:14:20] bless them that curse you pray for them
[1:14:23] do good to them that hate you they hate
[1:14:25] you but do good to them amen what did we
[1:14:28] just read it's like heaping up coals on
[1:14:32] their head right
[1:14:34] amen pray for them which despitefully
[1:14:37] use you and persecute you right it's the
[1:14:40] best way amen that people realize who
[1:14:44] you are who you belong to unfortunately
[1:14:47] now there are people that know that
[1:14:49] about Christians and they take advantage
[1:14:51] of it amen again those are the people
[1:14:54] they take advantage of that in that
[1:14:57] situation that's not somebody you want
[1:14:59] to make your best buddy on a daily basis
[1:15:02] kind of thing amen that's the kind of
[1:15:04] person that's not that is unedifying
[1:15:07] amen and there are people there are
[1:15:09] countries that have sort of taking
[1:15:11] advantage of that even for the United
[1:15:13] States right being a Christian Nation
[1:15:17] which uh I would like to believe still
[1:15:21] is of the United States although it's
[1:15:24] teetering very seriously right now uh uh
[1:15:28] a Christian Nation that others have
[1:15:31] taken advantage of that oh well there
[1:15:34] the Jesus said if they Smite you the
[1:15:36] cheek to turn the other cheek well let's
[1:15:38] just Smite them there and when they turn
[1:15:40] the cheek we'll Smite them there and
[1:15:42] I've heard people say that amen well
[1:15:46] they turn the cheek to me and I'll just
[1:15:48] hit the other one okay but you know what
[1:15:51] wrath you're going to have to incur CU
[1:15:53] vengeance is not m
[1:15:55] amen I'm not going to sit here and beat
[1:15:57] you up or shoot you or the Vengeance
[1:16:00] belongs to God and trust me you probably
[1:16:03] would rather uh me do something than him
[1:16:06] do something when he does it it it it is
[1:16:10] far from Pleasant right uh but it's the
[1:16:15] it's the exhortation that Jesus gives to
[1:16:18] us love our
[1:16:21] enemies but I say now look what he said
[1:16:24] though now there's a reason for all
[1:16:26] this that ye may 45th verse that ye may
[1:16:30] be the children of your
[1:16:32] father this Pro this proves that you're
[1:16:35] a child of
[1:16:36] God which is in heaven for he maketh the
[1:16:39] son to rise on the evil and on the good
[1:16:42] and sendeth reain on the just and the
[1:16:44] unjust he absolutely does that's our God
[1:16:48] Amen so if he does that we should do
[1:16:51] that amen for if now but how look at
[1:16:53] here now for if if we love them which
[1:16:56] love you what reward have
[1:16:58] you do not even the publicans the same a
[1:17:01] worldly person does that a demonic
[1:17:04] person does that an evil person usually
[1:17:06] loves those that love them amen I mean
[1:17:10] there are some people in the world that
[1:17:12] probably don't like anybody or love
[1:17:13] anybody whether they love them or not
[1:17:15] they they'd rather kill you as to look
[1:17:16] at you there's probably some people like
[1:17:18] that but most people everybody they love
[1:17:21] those that love them oh they're they're
[1:17:24] my friends they love me but oh you come
[1:17:26] and make just something a little cross
[1:17:28] and that ends that amen well but Jesus
[1:17:34] says if all you do as a Christian is
[1:17:37] love those that love you what have you
[1:17:39] done amen I it's sort of like tithe
[1:17:43] giving uh the 10% is God's right when
[1:17:47] you tithe you give
[1:17:49] anything amen amen you give your 10% you
[1:17:53] had give anything cuz that is his to
[1:17:55] begin with you just give him back what
[1:17:57] was

[1:21:04] fellow man as best as I possibly can
[1:21:07] Amen to hold my temper or to be
[1:21:11] temperate amen the next is patience
[1:21:14] patience to be able to hold your tongue
[1:21:17] patience to be tolerable with other
[1:21:19] people amen so easy to lose your
[1:21:22] patience patience with God
[1:21:25] patience with each other uh patience is
[1:21:28] uh to
[1:21:29] endure patience is endurance uh
[1:21:34] steadfastness amen there's so many
[1:21:36] examples of patience in the scripture uh
[1:21:39] you've got Noah who waited uh 100 years
[1:21:42] you got uh uh Abraham waited 25 years
[1:21:47] you got the children of Israel waited
[1:21:48] 400 years and uh how many times that uh
[1:21:53] you
[1:21:55] you the patience to have to be able to
[1:21:58] have patience patience will pay off amen
[1:22:01] just hold fast and believe and have
[1:22:04] patience towards God have patience
[1:22:05] towards each other amen suffering
[1:22:09] suffering listen to this now suffering
[1:22:13] without getting angry or upset amen or
[1:22:16] staying temperate
[1:22:19] amen suffering now who wants to
[1:22:23] suffer no nobody wants to suffer right
[1:22:26] amen but that's what endurance to endure
[1:22:29] something or to endure suffering but
[1:22:32] stay patient amen and not get angry or
[1:22:36] upset that's part of the patience Falls
[1:22:38] in line of course with Temperance to be
[1:22:41] able to stay uh to be able to stay
[1:22:43] temperate
[1:22:45] now uh I got a couple scriptures I want
[1:22:48] to read patience obviously is probably
[1:22:51] one of the at least well maybe I'm just
[1:22:54] speaking for myself but one of the most
[1:22:57] difficult attributes I believe that
[1:22:58] there is to
[1:22:59] find patience if I ask in here how many
[1:23:03] people feel like you have patience I
[1:23:05] don't want anybody's hand to go up I
[1:23:07] don't know if anybody's hand would go up
[1:23:09] mine wouldn't uh they feel like you have
[1:23:11] patience sometimes we have patience
[1:23:13] patience breeds tolerance amen right
[1:23:17] yeah if you have patience patience will
[1:23:20] bring tolerance toward someone yes
[1:23:22] because a lot of times the things that
[1:23:23] we end up Los losing our losing our uh
[1:23:26] temper or something over or losing our
[1:23:28] patience about a lot of times isn't even
[1:23:31] what it was originally cracked up to be
[1:23:34] right or told to be or thought to be a
[1:23:37] lot of times it doesn't even manifest
[1:23:39] itself that way or materialize that way
[1:23:41] and we lost our patience for what amen a
[1:23:45] lot of people lose their patience with
[1:23:47] God so God you said you would do so and
[1:23:49] so God says I'm working on it amen how
[1:23:53] long did how long it Daniel had to be in
[1:23:55] the Lion's
[1:23:56] Den Daniel and the Lion's Den prayed to
[1:23:59] God Amen it was uh 21 days I think it
[1:24:03] was is that what the scripture 21 days
[1:24:06] the angel finally came to him and and
[1:24:08] stood there he said well what took your
[1:24:10] song he said well I was hindered amen
[1:24:13] but hold hold hold true he'll come and
[1:24:16] do it God will be there for you God is
[1:24:19] always your portion God is always there
[1:24:22] on time he's never late amen God is
[1:24:25] always just you sometimes you just have
[1:24:27] to be patient Lord I thought I was
[1:24:29] supposed to get a miracle well maybe not
[1:24:31] maybe you just going to be healed today
[1:24:35] amen and your healing today may take you
[1:24:37] a
[1:24:38] year right don't know that's up to God
[1:24:41] but we got to be patient amen yes hold
[1:24:44] our patience patience is a virtue that
[1:24:47] that brings
[1:24:49] Victory uh so many times we just could
[1:24:51] be patient it can bring Victory yes but
[1:24:55] so many times we're eager to jump in and
[1:24:59] and take over and and and and do
[1:25:02] something that gets us in trouble
[1:25:04] because you don't have the patience to
[1:25:06] wait for it wait for it amen it'll come
[1:25:10] just wait for it look patience I have a
[1:25:13] couple of scriptures I want to read
[1:25:15] James 1 one is the first one I want to
[1:25:18] start James 1 verse one
[1:25:26] this is a tough one also maturity will
[1:25:29] help your patience amen it should anyway
[1:25:33] yes it seems like in some ways it did
[1:25:35] help my mother very
[1:25:36] much my mom got very impatient when she
[1:25:39] got older uh well no I shouldn't say
[1:25:42] that when she got older she she was good
[1:25:45] but when after she had her stroke uh she
[1:25:47] got very impatient uh nothing was
[1:25:50] happening fast enough for her at that
[1:25:52] time uh going to a
[1:25:56] restaurant she' start fussing about her
[1:25:58] food I'm like Mom the lady just took the
[1:26:00] order five minutes ago I think it
[1:26:03] probably takes more than five minutes to
[1:26:04] cook the food unless you're roll it raw
[1:26:07] you know but she would just lose her
[1:26:09] patience my could tell you she's in the
[1:26:12] facility sometimes uh nobody comes to
[1:26:15] see him I said Mom I just talked to
[1:26:17] sister so and so and she was just there
[1:26:20] yesterday afternoon and you know yeah
[1:26:24] but it was after that point before that
[1:26:27] she was fine but usually maturity will
[1:26:29] help a person's patience me because when
[1:26:32] you're young you just want to go your
[1:26:34] mind is racing and you just want to go
[1:26:35] and you want to hurry you want to get it
[1:26:37] done you want to uh but when you get
[1:26:39] older and patient you get like brother
[1:26:41] Pat with this car you got to have
[1:26:44] patience with that car you're going to
[1:26:45] drive it off the cliff or or take it to
[1:26:48] the take it to the Smasher but you got
[1:26:51] to have patience amen and patience bring
[1:26:54] a Victory amen enough patience you'll be
[1:26:56] driving that car down the interstate

[1:27:28] these Temptations be happy about it be
[1:27:32] joyous about it falling into this
[1:27:34] temptation knowing this that the trying
[1:27:38] of your faith now we're back on the
[1:27:41] building block again amen back down on
[1:27:44] the building block of Faith because the
[1:27:46] trying of your faith work patience work
[1:27:50] it oh I got to work at this oh yeah
[1:27:54] amen yeah I got to struggle I got to
[1:27:56] endure I got to suffer I don't want to
[1:28:00] work well you don't want to be a
[1:28:02] Christian then work that's what it means
[1:28:05] the trials of your the trying of your
[1:28:08] faith will work
[1:28:10] patience amen it doesn't just come it
[1:28:13] takes something it's a victory amen it's
[1:28:15] a victory that you have how many times
[1:28:18] have you flown off the handle or lost
[1:28:20] your temper or flown off the handle and
[1:28:24] blows something up it just falls apart
[1:28:27] messes up uh start over whatever I get
[1:28:31] like that at work sometimes uh I I just
[1:28:35] get to where I just want to hurry up and
[1:28:37] get it done now in some ways that's good
[1:28:40] because I work I get the job done I uh I
[1:28:44] don't just stand around I I I like to
[1:28:46] work I stood around a little bit when my
[1:28:48] brothers came the other day but that was
[1:28:50] because they were there and we were
[1:28:52] fellowshipping but I normally I uh well
[1:28:56] they can tell you when they walked on
[1:28:57] the lot I was working right uh I I work
[1:29:01] and but sometimes I get going so fast I
[1:29:04] make mistakes I shouldn't uh and I do
[1:29:07] things something just just stupid little
[1:29:10] things I could describe them to you but
[1:29:12] that that wouldn't necessarily help you
[1:29:14] know what I'm talking about things that
[1:29:16] just you get in a hurry and then you you
[1:29:18] mess them but when you get older so a
[1:29:20] lot of times you get older you get more
[1:29:22] patient you think okay uh this this
[1:29:25] would help if I took time to do this and
[1:29:28] make sure that it's done right amen
[1:29:30] because it's better to do it right the
[1:29:32] first time they have to do it two or
[1:29:33] three times yeah amen it even probably
[1:29:37] saves you time if you do it right the
[1:29:39] first time is that happen do it two or
[1:29:40] three different times or break it or
[1:29:43] make it to where it can't be fixed amen
[1:29:47] patience is a victory amen the trying of
[1:29:50] your faith Works patience amen so the
[1:29:54] trying of our faith what's the trying of
[1:29:56] our faith it's all the things that
[1:29:58] things happen in our lives that that
[1:30:00] brings us to the place are we going to
[1:30:02] believe it or are we going to doubt it
[1:30:05] are we going to have faith or are we not
[1:30:07] going to have faith do we trust God or
[1:30:09] we do we not trust God do we know he's
[1:30:12] going to come through or are we just not
[1:30:14] sure what faith trying our faith where
[1:30:18] is our faith then that helps us
[1:30:20] understand what place is my faith at
[1:30:24] what level is my faith at is my faith
[1:30:27] down here that really needs some
[1:30:28] encouraging and some work amen uh
[1:30:32] brother R talked about faith being
[1:30:34] muscles well if you want muscles you got
[1:30:36] to do what sit around on the couch all
[1:30:40] day no doesn't work that way if you want
[1:30:43] muscles you got to go in the gym or get
[1:30:44] some weights and work out you got to
[1:30:47] work you got to suffer you got to do
[1:30:50] something to cause muscle to be built
[1:30:53] that's the only way MUSC muscle is Built
[1:30:54] Well Faith muscles are the same way only
[1:30:57] way Faith muscle is going to be built is
[1:30:59] if it's exercised if it's
[1:31:01] tried if you go through something see
[1:31:04] that's how those thingss and those
[1:31:06] trials brings us to our kns it works
[1:31:09] that faith it brings that Faith to a
[1:31:11] place to where uh it gets stronger and
[1:31:14] stronger your faith increases and it
[1:31:18] gets stronger and your faith gets to the
[1:31:20] place to where nothing rattles you then
[1:31:23] amen your faith our faith should be at
[1:31:25] the place of born again Christian it
[1:31:27] shouldn't be anything that would rattle
[1:31:29] us or bring us down to tear us down amen
[1:31:35] our faith to where we just don't believe
[1:31:38] anymore which a lot of people
[1:31:40] unfortunately get to the place that
[1:31:42] their faith gets torn down because they
[1:31:44] don't they're not to the place to
[1:31:46] receive it their faith gets torn down to
[1:31:48] the place that they they it is it is
[1:31:52] unedifying at that point
[1:31:54] amen but the trial of our faith Works
[1:31:58] patience patience but let patience have
[1:32:02] her perfect work that ye may be perfect
[1:32:06] and
[1:32:08] entire wanting nothing again mature
[1:32:12] grown up patient got a couple more
[1:32:16] Romans chapter
[1:32:17] 5 I want to go over to Romans chapter 5
[1:32:24] Romans chapter 5 the first five
[1:32:29] verses again things remember these
[1:32:32] things they there are some of the most
[1:32:36] the scriptures that great against the
[1:32:38] flesh the humanity the most amen love
[1:32:42] your enemies do good do good to them
[1:32:45] that hurt you pray for them that
[1:32:46] persecute you amen all manner of evil
[1:32:49] against you I'm supposed to love that
[1:32:51] person who does all manner of of evil
[1:32:54] against me well you got to remember
[1:32:56] they're not doing it against you they're
[1:32:57] doing against him and if they're doing
[1:32:59] against him then it's his position
[1:33:01] responsibility to exact Vengeance not
[1:33:04] mine amen because who I am is who he is
[1:33:07] I'm living my life for him not for me my
[1:33:11] life is not my own right I don't live my
[1:33:13] life I live my life for him amen my life
[1:33:16] belongs to him amen and if someone is is
[1:33:19] ridiculing that making fun of that or
[1:33:21] whatever that's that's they're
[1:33:23] ridiculing him yes Amen brother the
[1:33:27] scripture says when they're persecuting
[1:33:28] you they're not persecuting you they're
[1:33:30] persecuting me yes amen and when they're
[1:33:32] doing that it's his it's it's his place
[1:33:35] then to exact Vengeance not ours Romans
[1:33:39] 51 therefore you ready it's going to
[1:33:41] Great some more therefore being
[1:33:44] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:33:47] God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:33:50] by whom also we have access by
[1:33:54] Faith by faith in into this grace
[1:33:59] wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of
[1:34:03] the glory of God and not only so but we
[1:34:09] glory amen now what did James just
[1:34:14] say with
[1:34:16] joy amen with joy now Romans Paul is
[1:34:21] saying we Glory
[1:34:24] in
[1:34:26] tribulations
[1:34:28] Glory or have joy in
[1:34:31] tribulations glory in tribulations also
[1:34:35] knowing that tribulation worketh there's
[1:34:38] that working again Works
[1:34:41] patience
[1:34:42] amen patience comes I remember when I
[1:34:46] was a young Christian remember when I
[1:34:48] was a young Minister I always felt like
[1:34:51] just speaking over and God it was just
[1:34:53] going to Happ happened just
[1:34:55] instantaneously Miracles abounding
[1:34:58] everywhere everything that happened
[1:35:00] everything you touched everything you
[1:35:01] prayed for it was going to be
[1:35:03] instantaneous God said uh lay hands and
[1:35:07] they shall recover he didn't say when
[1:35:10] right you see I was young then didn't
[1:35:12] think about that didn't think about the
[1:35:15] fact that healing is a process of
[1:35:18] time Miracle can happen amen something
[1:35:22] miraculous healing takes a per of time
[1:35:24] oh yeah do things happen instantaneously
[1:35:27] yes they do right amen but those are are
[1:35:30] a lot further apart than the healings
[1:35:33] that God performs right amen and when I
[1:35:36] was but when I was young I didn't
[1:35:38] differentiate differentiate those things
[1:35:40] and so many times I lose patience amen
[1:35:43] so many times I lose patience say God
[1:35:45] where are you a lot of people do that
[1:35:48] they cry where God why why where are you
[1:35:51] and see that proverbial why comes all
[1:35:54] the time when it should have no place in
[1:35:56] us even though there's some trials that
[1:35:58] come so hard I know when the Lord took
[1:36:00] our first son my whole cry I was still
[1:36:04] young of course young young human young
[1:36:08] Christian why God why why I know I heard
[1:36:12] my wife say why out
[1:36:15] loud so
[1:36:17] many ungodly
[1:36:19] demonic alcohol alcoholics drug Abus
[1:36:24] women have perfectly beautiful healthy
[1:36:26] babies and US Christian young Christians
[1:36:29] trying to start a family and God takes
[1:36:31] it home did not make a lick of
[1:36:35] sense but it's not for us to judge right
[1:36:38] it's not for us to understand and I
[1:36:41] don't understand although that's been
[1:36:43] quite the testimony her all through the
[1:36:46] years but God's the one that's in
[1:36:49] control of it not me amen glory Paul
[1:36:52] says to Glory
[1:36:54] GL that's hard to
[1:36:58] do there there's nothing about this that
[1:37:00] says this is going to be easy for you
[1:37:03] and there's really nothing about being a
[1:37:05] Christian that is easy right amen God
[1:37:09] never promis us a a b of roses amen this
[1:37:12] is not easy it's a it's a hard difficult
[1:37:16] wall but he said he'd be with me and
[1:37:19] when you get mature you realize that's
[1:37:21] all that really matters is that he's
[1:37:24] with me that's what matters prise the
[1:37:27] Lord
[1:37:30] amen tribulation worketh patience and
[1:37:33] patience
[1:37:35] experience and experience
[1:37:38] hope amen experience what is that
[1:37:42] maturity growing
[1:37:44] up amen being mature Christian now let's
[1:37:48] go to Romans chapter 8 we'll probably
[1:37:50] stop with this
[1:37:56] Romans chapter
[1:37:58] 8 very very familiar scripture read and
[1:38:01] of course friends so much of this is
[1:38:03] mostly getting
[1:38:05] highlights that uh there's so much more
[1:38:08] of this that can be
[1:38:09] said
[1:38:11] amen uh I one
[1:38:14] time uh I one
[1:38:17] time ask somebody if they prayed for
[1:38:21] patience I had found very few people
[1:38:25] that actually have confided in me or
[1:38:27] asked or or answered the question of
[1:38:30] whether they prayed for
[1:38:33] patience I don't know about you but I've
[1:38:37] had very few people tell me they pray
[1:38:39] for patience in fact I don't know if
[1:38:41] I've ever had anybody tell me that they
[1:38:43] pray for patience you know when you're
[1:38:46] praying for patience you're praying for
[1:38:49] tribulations amen because the
[1:38:51] tribulation is what works the patience
[1:38:53] yeah I know and I anybody say I don't
[1:38:57] pray I don't pray for patience cuz that
[1:38:58] just brings
[1:39:00] tribulation that just brings trials as
[1:39:03] for patience but how are you going to
[1:39:04] get it any other way right amen still
[1:39:07] have to get it Mike used to one of his
[1:39:10] we had a tape we used to play when when
[1:39:13] when cassettes existed um that was like
[1:39:18] Christian song and oh man he he is like
[1:39:22] uh
[1:39:24] uh a little bunny rabbit hopping all
[1:39:26] over the living room every time we would
[1:39:28] play this song he loved that song this
[1:39:30] sound like a uh it was like a rabbit or
[1:39:34] something he's singing uh patience
[1:39:36] patience I want patience give me
[1:39:38] patience right
[1:39:39] now I want patience I need patience give
[1:39:42] it to me now patience doesn't come that
[1:39:46] way amen that was the point of the song
[1:39:49] Romans 8 uh let's go to verse 2
[1:39:54] 6 Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit also
[1:39:58] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[1:40:00] what we should pray for as we ought now
[1:40:04] listen to this really close this is a a
[1:40:06] very uh tremendous
[1:40:10] scripture the spirit helpeth our
[1:40:15] infirmities our
[1:40:17] shortcomings sicknesses for we know not
[1:40:21] what we should pray we don't even know
[1:40:23] what what we should pray we always get
[1:40:25] down thinking when we believe we know
[1:40:26] what we should pray we don't know what
[1:40:28] we should pray for as we ought but the
[1:40:31] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:40:35] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:40:37] amen a lot of people believe that's
[1:40:40] tongue speaking I believe it could be uh
[1:40:43] I believe it's also just the spirit of
[1:40:45] God praying through you it doesn't have
[1:40:47] to be something that's unknown right uh
[1:40:49] to the human ear it could be something
[1:40:51] that the Lord is just praying through
[1:40:53] you that you you don't even realize may
[1:40:57] not even know the person or the
[1:40:58] situation but it's the spirit of God
[1:41:01] using you to pray to audibly bring
[1:41:04] prayer on someone else's behalf because
[1:41:07] we don't know but he does yes and he
[1:41:10] that searcheth the hearts listen to this
[1:41:12] now he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:41:16] what is the mind of the spirit this
[1:41:19] would have been maybe a good lesson good
[1:41:21] scripture with the talking about the
[1:41:22] mind
[1:41:23] uh the Gateway but he that searcheth the
[1:41:27] hearts know knoweth what is the mind of
[1:41:31] the
[1:41:32] spirit
[1:41:34] because because he maketh he because he
[1:41:38] knows this because he maketh
[1:41:41] intercession for the Saints he maketh
[1:41:44] intercession for us amen amen now this
[1:41:48] is where the Catholic well one of the
[1:41:51] hundreds of thousands of places of
[1:41:52] Catholic church is wrong it doesn't say
[1:41:55] the Saints are making intercession it
[1:41:59] says that he is making intercession on
[1:42:03] behalf of the Saints right right the
[1:42:07] Saints aren't making intercession Christ
[1:42:10] is making intercession for the
[1:42:13] Saints amen again one of the many many
[1:42:17] things they got wrong I probably threw
[1:42:19] out a number I probably shouldn't but
[1:42:20] many many things they got they get wrong
[1:42:23] it's not the Saints making
[1:42:25] intercession it's Christ making
[1:42:27] intercession for the Saints he does it
[1:42:31] because he knows what is the mind of the
[1:42:34] spirit and the best part it is
[1:42:38] according to the will of God not your
[1:42:42] will amen not our will that's why we
[1:42:46] have to have patience it's not our will
[1:42:49] amen that's some of the hard part amen
[1:42:52] cuz we want it a certain way certain
[1:42:54] time a certain uh person however it
[1:42:57] works we want it we in our mind so many
[1:42:59] of the times we have it set our mind
[1:43:01] going to be like this and how this and
[1:43:03] this is when it's going to be and all
[1:43:05] and we get it all set and God's up there
[1:43:07] thinking that's not at all how it's
[1:43:09] going to happen that's not at all
[1:43:12] who but we get in our mind but see it's
[1:43:15] not up to us it's not up to our will
[1:43:18] right amen amen and we do pray a
[1:43:20] specific way scripturally and there's
[1:43:22] nothing wrong with with that but we when
[1:43:24] we get into that place of intercession
[1:43:26] of the Holy Spirit to pray through us
[1:43:29] and to speak through us and Christ that
[1:43:32] knows the heart the mind of the spirit
[1:43:35] and can make
[1:43:36] intercession on our behalf the
[1:43:40] intercession that he makes on our behalf
[1:43:44] is not according to what I want it's
[1:43:48] according to God's will amen God's
[1:43:51] perfect will
[1:43:53] amen now follow that up with the 28th
[1:43:58] verse and now we
[1:44:01] know praise the Lord now we
[1:44:05] know now is we we talked about him that
[1:44:08] searcheth the heart and him that knows
[1:44:11] and him that makes intercession and him
[1:44:13] that goes the perfect will of God but
[1:44:15] now we
[1:44:16] know we know praise the Lord right I
[1:44:21] know that
[1:44:23] we know that all things work together
[1:44:28] for the good to them that love
[1:44:32] God amen amen to them that love God and
[1:44:37] that love is ago iil God's love amen
[1:44:42] amen not human love not filio love not
[1:44:45] an affinity not an affection amen but
[1:44:48] love to those that love God if you love
[1:44:51] God you trust him if if you trust God
[1:44:53] you have faith in him if you have faith
[1:44:55] in him you believe then you know not
[1:44:58] just believe but you know that
[1:45:00] everything that God's going to do for
[1:45:02] you is going to be for your good yes
[1:45:04] amen because he maketh intercession on
[1:45:08] our behalf to his perfect
[1:45:12] will so we know based on that that all
[1:45:16] things work together for my good because
[1:45:20] I love
[1:45:21] it I love him H now people that just
[1:45:24] have an affinity for God or an affection
[1:45:26] or yeah he's good he's good God he's you
[1:45:30] know whatever brother R talked about
[1:45:33] back in the day calling Daddyo and stuff
[1:45:34] and whatever right that's kind of
[1:45:36] disrespectful I'm sure other people
[1:45:38] would do uh not like brother BR was just
[1:45:40] talking about it but the way they would
[1:45:42] do that uh yeah but then when when the
[1:45:46] trial comes and when the tribulation and
[1:45:50] when the difficulty set in that love
[1:45:54] that Faith just
[1:45:57] evaporates and I said well why would God
[1:45:59] do such a and then they go off you know
[1:46:03] you thought they were a Christian you
[1:46:05] thought they were a solid Christian you
[1:46:06] thought they were a Believer and the
[1:46:08] next thing you know they're out of here
[1:46:11] amen just because of X Y and Z you
[1:46:15] think what maturity is there in that
[1:46:19] amen
[1:46:20] what faith is there in that that right
[1:46:24] amen for this scripture to work for you
[1:46:29] you have to love God with God's Own Love
[1:46:33] Not Your Love Not Human love but you
[1:46:35] have to love God with God's Own love yes
[1:46:38] and if you love God with God's Own love
[1:46:40] that love is unconditional
[1:46:42] right conditions don't dictate it amen
[1:46:47] which I guess we're jumping way up to
[1:46:48] the Capstone now but it conditions have
[1:46:52] no no effect on your love for God yes
[1:46:56] amen you can be in a ditch somewhere you
[1:46:58] can be on the highest mountain you can
[1:47:00] be in a shanty cardboard box you can be
[1:47:02] in aund room Mansion you could be
[1:47:05] driving a quar million dollar car or a
[1:47:07] $200 galopy conditions don't change your
[1:47:11] love for God period doesn't matter you
[1:47:14] can be sick dying with cancer leukemia
[1:47:17] whatever you're can to be the most
[1:47:18] healthy person on the planet I have come
[1:47:21] to find out that sometimes s the
[1:47:23] healthiest person on the planet has died
[1:47:25] before the person that was
[1:47:27] sick amen I've seen a lot of people uh
[1:47:31] I'm not saying don't do it but just
[1:47:35] health health health health health and
[1:47:37] what they do and what they eat
[1:47:39] everything and then they're dead at 50
[1:47:41] yes now I'm not saying I'm not making
[1:47:44] fun of that and I'm not saying we
[1:47:47] shouldn't be healthy uh but we do what
[1:47:51] we do according to God 's perfect will
[1:47:54] not mine amen and the conditions have
[1:47:57] nothing to do with my love to God
[1:48:01] nothing amen okay then all things now
[1:48:04] then we know work together for good to
[1:48:07] them that love God to them who are the
[1:48:10] called according to his purpose his
[1:48:14] perfect will that's what we
[1:48:17] know amen that's what we know now we
[1:48:20] have to understand in patience that all
[1:48:25] things it just doesn't say the thing all
[1:48:29] things work together it's not just one
[1:48:33] thing you pull down and Bam there it is
[1:48:35] no all things work together they have to
[1:48:40] dovetail they have to all come together
[1:48:43] to work together for our good amen now
[1:48:48] that that sometimes takes
[1:48:50] patience amen I I I know in listening to
[1:48:53] brother Brown I'm closing here that he
[1:48:55] would talk about Vision sometime and
[1:48:58] when he saw Vision he'd see a vision
[1:49:01] exactly a certain way now some people
[1:49:03] might use the word Deja Vu or something
[1:49:06] it's not as clear as maybe a v actual
[1:49:09] Vision but he'd see this vision and all
[1:49:11] of a sudden he would be in this position
[1:49:14] this place where this Vision was coming
[1:49:16] into fruition and he's sitting there and
[1:49:19] he sees this vision and he remembers
[1:49:21] he's in he's he's in that Vision if you
[1:49:24] will but brother brandom himself can't
[1:49:27] do anything about it see because the
[1:49:30] conditions had to bring themselves all
[1:49:32] together now brother random could go in
[1:49:35] there and say in Jesus name you are
[1:49:38] healed wasn't going to happen amen not
[1:49:42] even for brother
[1:49:44] Brown wasn't going to happen he could
[1:49:47] not go over and change the circumstances
[1:49:50] he could not go change things to make it
[1:49:52] fit what his vision was it had to be God
[1:49:57] doing it in God's time brother B just
[1:50:01] had to sit there and be patient and wait
[1:50:05] May took hours May took days whatever
[1:50:08] the circumstances the situation the
[1:50:10] specific
[1:50:11] situation he could not do it God had to
[1:50:15] be the one to do it because it's in
[1:50:16] God's time not ours right amen that's
[1:50:19] where we have to be patient yes it's not
[1:50:22] in my time
[1:50:23] it's in God's time it's not according to
[1:50:26] what I want it's according to what he's
[1:50:28] already done we by faith believe that
[1:50:33] it's going to work together for our
[1:50:36] good amen but so many times more often
[1:50:40] than not we have to be patient we have
[1:50:44] to wait for it amen it will come God
[1:50:48] will God does o God will fulfill his
[1:50:52] word he always always does amen God
[1:50:54] cannot ever not fulfill his word because
[1:50:57] he is his word amen God can no more deny
[1:51:01] his word than deny himself right amen it
[1:51:05] will work we just have to have patience
[1:51:08] and the
[1:51:10] temperance the temperance I've heard
[1:51:13] I've seen so many people too they get
[1:51:15] furious with God because they lose their
[1:51:18] patience they're mad at God
[1:51:22] amen because they've lost their patience
[1:51:25] they didn't really have it to start with
[1:51:28] amen I have to have the Holy Spirit
[1:51:31] brings all the attributes in to that
[1:51:34] place of of completeness in US Amen to
[1:51:38] work together it's lessons that every
[1:51:41] one of us should be able to continue to
[1:51:44] learn and live amen as God shows it to
[1:51:47] us and it lived through us not just
[1:51:50] something we preach not just something
[1:51:51] we listen to not just something that we
[1:51:53] hear and say well okay I get that I know
[1:51:56] that I understand you know it's a place
[1:51:58] that we uh that we
[1:52:02] live that we should live all of us
[1:52:05] should live amen when something doesn't
[1:52:08] go exactly the way we want it to maybe
[1:52:10] there's a reason for that that's right
[1:52:12] one more thing before I
[1:52:14] close I read the other day it was plane
[1:52:17] crash in Brazil 68 people died something
[1:52:21] like that I saw the video that unreal
[1:52:24] the plane was just going along and all
[1:52:26] of a sudden it just
[1:52:27] went it just just fell right straight
[1:52:30] into the ground I mean I've seen I've
[1:52:33] seen you know sometimes they go down or
[1:52:35] dive or something or or even go like
[1:52:37] this this plane just went I had Twisted
[1:52:40] on its way down it just fell to the
[1:52:42] ground I'm thinking what happened to
[1:52:45] that plane it just fell straight down
[1:52:47] but I read the testimony two people were
[1:52:50] supposed to be on that flight and they
[1:52:52] got things all mixed up don't think this
[1:52:54] didn't speak to me
[1:52:56] Saints um
[1:53:00] firsthand something got mixed up
[1:53:02] reservations whatever they didn't make
[1:53:04] their
[1:53:05] flight and if they' made that flight
[1:53:08] they'd have been on that ill- fated
[1:53:09] plane praise the Lord that lost their
[1:53:12] lives their lives were spared because of
[1:53:15] a technicality uh
[1:53:18] snafu the type of snafus that get us so
[1:53:21] mad some times we can't hardly
[1:53:27] spit but God's working everything
[1:53:30] out God's taking care of us God is
[1:53:34] making sure that his perfect will is
[1:53:36] manifested in our lives even if it
[1:53:39] causes us some minor
[1:53:41] inconveniences amen and I tell like I
[1:53:44] said don't don't I can tell you right
[1:53:46] now that spoke to me amen especially
[1:53:49] sometimes we had this situation that
[1:53:51] challenge us with flight sometimes or I
[1:53:53] have to drive the fence or something I'm
[1:53:55] starting to more and more slowly get to
[1:53:58] the place that Lord I don't care right
[1:54:00] whatever I well I I need to get there
[1:54:03] it's my job try to get there as fast as
[1:54:05] I can work with uh the lady at work and
[1:54:08] stuff but you know if it doesn't happen
[1:54:10] doesn't happen if it's another plane
[1:54:12] it's another plane another time another
[1:54:14] time another city another city I don't
[1:54:16] care I'm I'm not going to worry about it
[1:54:20] um God has taking care of us
[1:54:23] amen praise the Lord so those little
[1:54:25] snappo that get us mad
[1:54:27] sometimes there's probably a good reason
[1:54:30] for it we just need to be patient say
[1:54:33] the Lord's working something here amen I
[1:54:36] just want to be patient praise the Lord
[1:54:38] and be patient with one another it's
[1:54:40] sort of like that testimony sister MTI
[1:54:42] sent last week at that lady with her
[1:54:44] husband she realized after a little bit
[1:54:46] that God was doing something God's
[1:54:48] working here I just need to be patient
[1:54:50] and back off a little bit and and just
[1:54:53] be what I'm supposed to be as a
[1:54:55] Christian woman and let God do the rest
[1:54:56] and he did amen he did and the and the
[1:55:00] result was
[1:55:02] positive amen praise the Lord let's
[1:55:04] stand if we
[1:55:10] could God works all things together for
[1:55:13] our
[1:55:15] good amen because we love him because we
[1:55:20] love him
[1:55:23] praise the Lord not because we just
[1:55:24] think he's a good guy not c not and not
[1:55:28] even because he's been good to us amen I
[1:55:31] don't love God because he love I just
[1:55:33] well the Bible says I love him because
[1:55:35] he first loved me but because there was
[1:55:37] no way I could love him without that
[1:55:41] but I if God never did one more thing
[1:55:45] for us in life at all period ever again
[1:55:48] he's done way more
[1:55:52] bunches and bunches more than I ever
[1:55:54] deserve to start with so uh who am I to
[1:55:58] complain amen praise the Lord 493 let's
[1:56:02] sing this CH I want to live the way he
[1:56:05] wants me to live Mich want put it on
[1:56:08] here I want to we probably all know it
[1:56:11] anyway I want to live the way he wants
[1:56:13] me to live that's being a mature
[1:56:15] Christian that's being a grownup amen
[1:56:18] that's letting God take over and live
[1:56:21] through us
[1:56:22] praise the Lord become one of his who he
[1:56:26] wants us to be amen who he wants us to
[1:56:30] be amen God is so good isn't

[1:56:39] your heart though you mean it I want to
[1:56:44] live the
[1:56:46] way he wants me to live I want on to
