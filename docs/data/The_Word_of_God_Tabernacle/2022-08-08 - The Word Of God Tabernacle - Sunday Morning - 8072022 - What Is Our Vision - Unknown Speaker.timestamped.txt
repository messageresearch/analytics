[26:06] glory honor and praise for all that is

[26:17] amen proverbs 29 18 we'll just read
[26:20] verse 18 and we'll let you be
[26:22] seated
[26:24] amen proverbs 29 18 where there is no
[26:27] vision the people perish
[26:30] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[26:33] you can be seated if you like
[26:35] i want you to want to speak on a thought
[26:37] that came on my heart the other day
[26:39] uh about what is our vision
[26:42] and then what is our vision because the
[26:44] bible's here uh the most wisest man in
[26:47] the world put this in the scripture uh
[26:49] solomon said without a vision people
[26:52] perish so to keep from perishing or
[26:56] going away from
[26:58] god
[26:59] uh there is to be a vision there is to
[27:01] be something that keeps us motivated
[27:04] keeps us moving keeps our eyes
[27:07] projected in a place in a way that is
[27:10] going to edify us and bless and build us
[27:12] up and keep us moving forward with him
[27:16] so many people today get stagnant and
[27:19] and their their experience gets stagnant
[27:21] and their relationship with the lord
[27:23] gets stagnant and their uh their uh
[27:26] experience in church and the things that
[27:28] they do for the lord they just kind of
[27:30] grow old and they kind of grow stagnant
[27:32] but there always must be a vision
[27:35] that vision should always be before us
[27:38] and as that vision is before us it is to
[27:40] be what is to propel us and to keep us
[27:43] pressing toward as paul said pressing
[27:45] towards that mark of the call of the of
[27:48] the high calling in christ jesus and to
[27:51] keep pressing is it's hard to do if you
[27:53] don't feel like there's something that
[27:55] you're pressing towards
[27:57] it's hard to keep that energy that
[27:59] effort that that vision if you don't
[28:01] feel like there's something that's there
[28:03] that you're that you're shooting for
[28:04] that you're aiming for that you're that
[28:06] you're working towards without that
[28:09] vision the people perish that people go
[28:11] away so that vision is what we want to
[28:13] talk about today and look at and examine
[28:16] our lives and finding out what is our
[28:19] vision what is my vision what is your
[28:21] vision so many times our vision gets on
[28:24] so many other things
[28:27] satan is going to make sure and put all
[28:28] kinds of things in front of us so that
[28:30] our vision gets put on that or our
[28:32] vision gets put on uh the world's
[28:34] condition or who's in the white house or
[28:37] what our government's about or sometimes
[28:39] we get our vision on what our bank
[28:41] account looks like or uh
[28:44] sometimes we get our eyes our vision
[28:46] focused on on a church or or even on a
[28:49] pastor or on a man or something or we
[28:52] get our vision off on somebody else or
[28:55] family or something but i want us to
[28:57] understand while all those things would
[28:59] be important in a person's life all
[29:01] those things mean something to us in our
[29:04] lives our vision
[29:06] as a christian our number one vision our
[29:09] number one goal our number one drive our
[29:12] number one thing that we shoot for
[29:14] continually and always keep our focus
[29:17] and our vision on is christ
[29:20] our vision should never sway to get off
[29:23] on
[29:24] something that's inconsequential
[29:26] something that's not significant to our
[29:29] eternal salvation or something that's uh
[29:32] that the lord's working out anyway you
[29:35] know so many times the things happen and
[29:37] we don't understand why or things come
[29:39] about and we can't explain them we
[29:42] sometimes can't understand them but god
[29:44] always has a reason and god always has a
[29:46] way and god always takes care of it and
[29:48] we we know that as many of us are
[29:50] seasoned christians to understand that
[29:53] of how many times the lord has brought
[29:55] us through and so that our vision can
[29:57] maintain on that one focus and that is
[30:00] him
[30:01] our focus our vision should always be on
[30:04] him our focus our vision should always
[30:07] be on trying to help others
[30:09] uh become christians others to get the
[30:12] same vision others to let christ be
[30:15] their vision it should always be our
[30:17] goal to try to help those that are in
[30:19] need those that are striving and and and
[30:23] sometimes even in desperation and in
[30:25] prayer and and whatever we can do to
[30:28] keep that vision because you know the
[30:30] number one way that we know that we love
[30:33] the lord jesus is that we love one
[30:35] another yes we can't say that we love
[30:37] him unless we love each other and if we
[30:40] don't love each other then how can
[30:42] anybody say i mean uh john says that how
[30:46] can we say we love him when we don't
[30:47] love each other how can i say i love god
[30:50] if i don't even love you and if i don't
[30:52] show how much i love you or produce or
[30:54] prove how much i love you then what good
[30:56] are my words
[30:58] i can say i love you all but all i want
[31:00] but if you get in the moment of need and
[31:02] i'm not there for you if if i don't if i
[31:05] have a possibility or way to help you
[31:08] and don't do it
[31:10] if i shut up my bowels of compassion
[31:12] against you how dwell is the love of god
[31:14] in me no matter what i say
[31:17] so if i if i say that i love him then
[31:20] then my love must first be to you
[31:23] amen
[31:24] because without loving you i can't love
[31:26] him right amen i can't love him without
[31:29] loving you so
[31:31] our vision
[31:32] is not just as we say well uh i'm
[31:35] focused on christ and that's number one
[31:38] absolutely it should always be
[31:40] but in but in conjunction to that is
[31:44] that we look
[31:45] at on the needs of others yes and and
[31:48] let our vision be on how can i help
[31:51] somebody else
[31:52] what can i do for somebody else how can
[31:55] i make this better or easier i mean
[31:59] i told you
[32:01] i i was more than honored please blessed
[32:04] to be able to baptize javi yesterday but
[32:07] the moment he asked me there there was
[32:09] never a doubt in my mind
[32:12] he asked me if if i would if it would be
[32:14] okay or if you would be available i said
[32:16] brother i will be available
[32:19] whatever i've got to do i will be
[32:21] available i will be there i will do it
[32:24] amen
[32:26] there just wasn't a question they say
[32:27] well i i don't know i i i can't do this
[32:31] or just all the excuses obstacles you
[32:33] know we always we have a life full of
[32:35] excuses reasons for this excuses for
[32:38] that of course i think there's
[32:39] differences in excuses and reasons but
[32:42] an excuse is just a way to get out of
[32:44] something and basically end up doing
[32:46] pretty much what you want to do anyway
[32:48] but the bottom line is
[32:51] always our focus our vision should
[32:53] always be on him and what can i do for
[32:56] him
[32:57] for jesus christ what can i do for him
[33:00] the best thing that i can do for him is
[33:02] to is to do what i can for you to do
[33:05] what i can and i don't mean just these
[33:06] four walls i don't mean just this church
[33:09] i mean hobby doesn't even come here
[33:10] never been here
[33:12] but that doesn't matter that's not the
[33:14] point the point is
[33:17] what can we do for one another as humans
[33:20] as christians
[33:22] as as a body of believers
[33:25] amen because that's what our vision
[33:27] leads us to so what is our vision what
[33:31] keeps you
[33:32] motivated what keeps you driving
[33:35] what keeps you persevering right what
[33:38] keeps you
[33:39] pressing toward believing that you are
[33:41] i'm just going to trust and believe you
[33:43] are what keeps you pressing towards that
[33:45] mark
[33:47] what keeps you motivated to continue to
[33:49] press this battle cause friend you know
[33:52] this battle gets hard as you know as
[33:54] well as i do this this is not a flowery
[33:57] bed of ease that we've chosen to walk
[34:00] this is a godly christian today i mean
[34:03] even god told us in the scripture those
[34:05] who live godly in christ jesus shall
[34:07] suffer persecution i mean that just
[34:09] comes with the territory so you know
[34:11] it's not an easy walk
[34:13] so what keeps you pressing
[34:16] what is the vision that you have that
[34:18] keeps you pushing and pressing what
[34:20] vision did you have that brought you
[34:22] here to church today
[34:25] did you come because of me
[34:27] lord i hope not you could be
[34:29] sorely disappointed if you come here for
[34:31] me
[34:32] did you come here because you wanted to
[34:34] see somebody else and you come here
[34:35] because you had nothing better to do why
[34:37] did you come today what was the vision
[34:40] that brought you here
[34:41] what drove you to this place
[34:43] what drove you to continue to live for
[34:46] the lord
[34:48] what
[34:49] what is it that is put before you that
[34:52] that keeps you going
[34:54] that keeps your eyes on him that keeps
[34:57] your vision on christ
[35:00] because that vision is the only thing
[35:01] that's going to keep you that's what's
[35:03] going to keep you bring you to the end
[35:06] point
[35:07] it's like
[35:08] this is probably a horrible analogy but
[35:11] it's kind of like the carrot at the end
[35:12] of the stick
[35:15] you know the carrot dangling in front of
[35:17] the the person at the end of the stick
[35:19] they just keep going and keep going and
[35:20] keep reaching and keep reaching and the
[35:22] carrot just stays out there uh that's
[35:24] probably not a good analogy because
[35:26] that's not exactly the way this works
[35:28] but it's something that keeps that
[35:30] person motivated
[35:31] or or or they've even done that with
[35:33] animals
[35:35] and keep something in front of that
[35:36] animal it'll just keep running and
[35:37] running and running and running thinking
[35:39] it's going to get to that to that end
[35:41] result
[35:42] that's a facade where we know the
[35:44] reality of jesus christ and that final
[35:47] that finish line is there if you keep
[35:49] your eyes on
[35:50] your vision on him
[35:52] let's look at a couple of places in the
[35:54] scripture
[35:55] um
[35:56] as we delve into this say john chapter 3
[36:02] saint john chapter 3 verse 1.
[36:07] and then we'll start with verse 1.
[36:11] saint john chapter 3 verse 1.
[36:14] and you know the story very well most of
[36:16] you so
[36:18] we'll just kind of skim through it but i
[36:19] want us to see the point i'm trying to
[36:21] get to now there was a man of the
[36:23] pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the
[36:25] jews
[36:26] the same came to jesus by night and said
[36:29] unto him rabbi
[36:30] we know that thou art a teacher come
[36:32] from god
[36:34] for no man can do these miracles that
[36:37] thou doest except god be with him now
[36:39] nicodemus was the only one of that group
[36:41] of that sect
[36:43] that actually
[36:45] said these words to jesus he's the only
[36:48] one of them so you can imagine
[36:50] that as he verbalized this to christ
[36:53] that of the talks that went on behind
[36:55] closed doors between the pharisees and
[36:57] sadducees and some of the things
[37:01] that they would say
[37:03] now the sad part of this is is that he
[37:06] says that we know
[37:09] so
[37:10] my question then would be who is this we
[37:12] he's come there
[37:14] on his own at night no doubt no less
[37:18] he come at night by himself
[37:20] who is he representing because he said
[37:22] we know that thou art a teacher come
[37:24] from god no man can do these miracles
[37:27] except that god be with him who is he
[37:29] talking about so obviously all the
[37:31] talking that these that ended up
[37:33] crucifying him uh we're talking about it
[37:36] behind closed doors nicodemus was
[37:37] actually verbalizing we know that that
[37:40] thou art a teacher sent from god because
[37:43] nobody can do what you do unless god is
[37:45] with him
[37:46] amen
[37:48] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[37:50] verily i say unto thee except a man be
[37:52] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[37:55] god now that's pretty straight
[37:57] amen it's pretty understandable
[37:59] unless you be born again he cannot see
[38:02] the kingdom of god but look at what
[38:04] nicus did look at what
[38:06] nicodemus's vision is
[38:09] nicodemus had said unto him
[38:11] how can a man be born when he is old
[38:16] can he enter the uh enter the second
[38:19] time into his mother's womb and be born
[38:22] so you see what nicodemus's vision is
[38:24] jesus is trying to give him a spiritual
[38:27] vision but only vision that he can see
[38:30] is a natural vision
[38:32] so the vision that he had is not
[38:34] something that's keeping him continuing
[38:36] his vision
[38:38] is a temporal
[38:40] when the vision that jesus is trying to
[38:42] offer to nicodemus is an eternal
[38:45] spiritual vision
[38:48] except a man be born again he cannot see
[38:51] this the kingdom of god now what is that
[38:54] that's that the spiritual birth of
[38:56] course in the spirit realm uh that new
[38:58] birth of the the soul that a person
[39:02] experiences in this life when he is born
[39:04] again his old nature dies and christ
[39:07] comes and lives in him
[39:08] amen but that's not nicodemus vision so
[39:11] what is his vision about his vision is
[39:14] the same vision a lot of people have
[39:16] today it's something of the natural it's
[39:18] the same way a lot of people try to
[39:20] interpret or try to read or understand
[39:24] the scripture
[39:25] it's the same way that so many people
[39:27] try to explain the scripture and try to
[39:30] uh
[39:33] do away with its validity or try to say
[39:35] that oh it contradicts itself
[39:38] well to the natural
[39:40] mind to a human understanding it
[39:43] probably does look that way but if you
[39:46] take god at his word and let the lord
[39:48] reveal that word to you open to just
[39:51] like what jesus was saying you read in
[39:53] the natural if nicodemus is reading the
[39:57] word of god in the natural it looks like
[40:00] an impossibility for a human to be born
[40:03] again right does it not
[40:05] without spiritual understanding in
[40:07] revelation all you understand or see all
[40:10] your vision is how can i crawl it excuse
[40:14] me but in my mother's womb and be born
[40:16] again
[40:17] how can i do that
[40:19] see that's all the person's vision is
[40:21] and that's exactly what so many people
[40:23] get out of the scripture all they get
[40:25] out is the superficial uh
[40:28] human understanding of what they're
[40:30] reading instead of letting the holy
[40:32] spirit that wrote the bible reveal it to
[40:35] you
[40:36] and let you see and open it to you
[40:39] something new
[40:41] a newer vision a spiritual vision a
[40:44] vision that's not just temporal here on
[40:46] earth it'll take you from point a to
[40:48] point b but will take you beyond into
[40:50] the eternities
[40:52] that's what jesus was offering to
[40:53] nicodemus
[40:55] he was trying to offer him something
[40:57] that was in eternity
[40:59] not just here on this earth but of
[41:02] eternity it made me think when i was
[41:04] praying to you this morning
[41:07] about the things that we hear
[41:09] you know
[41:10] outside of maybe plugging our ears or
[41:12] getting earplugs or something like that
[41:14] you can't really control what goes into
[41:16] your ears
[41:18] unfortunately uh you can't really
[41:20] control that but you can control
[41:23] what goes in what you hear in your heart
[41:26] you can control that
[41:28] you can stop anything that does not
[41:31] belong there from dropping from here to
[41:33] here
[41:34] you can do that you might not can stop
[41:37] it here but you can stop and hear you've
[41:38] got control over that yes amen and
[41:42] that spiritual light that jesus is
[41:46] offering to nicodemus he cannot see it
[41:48] because he's looking through the wrong
[41:50] knives
[41:51] he's looking in the wrong place
[41:53] amen first of all he's looking at jesus
[41:56] obviously as he says here as a teacher
[41:59] come from god instead of god building
[42:01] flesh
[42:02] that's his first mistake and then so so
[42:05] you see it matters at what your vision
[42:08] is it matters what eyes you're looking
[42:10] through it matters what you're looking
[42:13] at
[42:14] it matters what what spiritual
[42:17] revelation or understanding that you
[42:19] have as to what your vision is right
[42:21] because you could take how you could
[42:23] take any number of people in the world
[42:25] today so what's your vision
[42:27] or
[42:28] or your eyes on jesus or are you looking
[42:30] at jesus amen and oh yeah certainly am
[42:34] but in what way nicodemus was looking at
[42:36] jesus too but what way was he looking at
[42:38] it
[42:39] he was looking at him in a whole
[42:41] different way than what those that are
[42:42] born again of the spirit of god
[42:44] understanding by revelation the word
[42:47] look at him
[42:48] nicodemus was looking at him in a
[42:50] different way than we look at christ
[42:52] today
[42:53] amen
[42:54] he saw
[42:55] he just saw a teacher he just saw a man
[42:57] a teacher
[42:59] that was sent from god instead of when
[43:01] you look at him what do you see
[43:04] god bailed in flesh
[43:06] amen
[43:07] that's how that's who i see
[43:10] how could a man enter into his mother's
[43:12] womb the second time jesus answered
[43:13] verily verily i say unto ye uh to thee
[43:16] accept a man be born of water and of the
[43:19] spirit
[43:21] now he's trying to expound it to him to
[43:23] try to get him to get to that place
[43:26] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[43:29] into the kingdom of god not enter into
[43:32] your mother's womb but enter into the
[43:34] kingdom of god
[43:36] must be by water
[43:38] spirit praise the lord
[43:41] just like birth is today water blood
[43:43] life
[43:44] water blood spirit this is a natural
[43:46] birth water blood life it's the three
[43:48] steps that god always has god works in
[43:51] numerology
[43:52] amen the three steps water water blood
[43:55] spirits the same thing that spirit that
[43:57] come
[43:58] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[44:00] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[44:03] that which is born of the spirit of
[44:04] spirit marvel not that i said unto you
[44:06] ye must be borned again
[44:08] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[44:10] thou hearst the sound thereof but cast
[44:13] not tell whence he cometh
[44:15] and whether it goeth so is everyone that
[44:18] is born of the spirit
[44:20] nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[44:23] can these things be
[44:25] his vision has not changed
[44:27] no matter what christ is trying to
[44:29] explain to him no matter how in detail
[44:32] he's trying to get him to understand his
[44:35] vision stays the same his vision is only
[44:38] on the natural right his vision is only
[44:41] on the temporal his vision is only on
[44:44] what he can see touch feel smell or hear
[44:47] his vision even though jesus told him
[44:50] about the spirit the supernatural his
[44:52] vision hasn't gone beyond that to see
[44:54] what the revelation that god was trying
[44:56] to get to him to understand right he
[44:59] could not see it
[45:00] amen and that's not necessarily his
[45:02] fault but he could not see it how can
[45:05] these things be
[45:07] then jesus goes and says
[45:10] said unto him are thou a master of
[45:12] israel and knoweth not these things
[45:14] verily verily i say unto thee we speak
[45:17] that we do
[45:18] that we do know and testify that we have
[45:21] seen and ye received not our witness
[45:25] if i have told you earthly things and ye
[45:28] believe not how shall ye believe if i
[45:31] tell you of heavenly things
[45:33] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[45:35] but he that came down from heaven even
[45:37] the son of man which is in heaven
[45:39] and moses and as moses lifted up the
[45:42] serpent of the wilderness even so must
[45:44] the son of man be lifted up that
[45:45] whosoever believeth in him should not
[45:47] perish but have eternal life for god so
[45:50] loved the world
[45:52] that he gave his only begotten son
[45:55] speaking of himself here
[45:57] that whosoever believeth in him should
[45:59] not perish but have everlasting life
[46:01] perish
[46:02] should not perish so
[46:04] look
[46:05] look at verse 16
[46:07] very popular christian scripture i've
[46:10] told you many times about how this is
[46:12] the first scripture i learned growing up
[46:14] as a baptist boy in a baptist church in
[46:16] north carolina how this was the first
[46:18] scripture that we're taught uh as we're
[46:21] growing up in a baptist church for god
[46:23] so loved the world he gave his only
[46:24] begotten son whosoever believed in him
[46:26] shall not perish but look at this
[46:29] should not perish what was it that
[46:31] solomon told us
[46:33] in proverbs 29 without a vision what
[46:36] happens
[46:38] amen without a vision you perish
[46:42] so where is that vision when jesus comes
[46:45] and basically gives us
[46:49] along the same lines of of that
[46:51] scripture
[46:53] god loved the world
[46:55] he gave his son
[46:57] to die and shed his blood
[46:59] that whosoever believeth in him
[47:02] should not perish
[47:04] should not perish whoever has that
[47:07] vision
[47:08] whoever receives that not nicodemus
[47:11] vision as he's speaking to nicodemus but
[47:14] the spiritual vision the spiritual
[47:16] revelation of who jesus christ is which
[47:19] is exactly what he ended up telling his
[47:21] disciples oh man who who do you say the
[47:24] son of man uh who do they say the son of
[47:27] man is oh some say you're elias and the
[47:29] prophets and this that and the other
[47:31] jesus got personal and said who do you
[47:33] say that i am thou art the christ the
[47:36] son of the living god blessed art thou
[47:38] simon for
[47:39] flesh and blood did not reveal this
[47:42] flesh and blood did not reveal it but my
[47:45] father in heaven has revealed this to
[47:47] you revealed what
[47:49] who jesus is amen not was is who is he
[47:56] what is that vision that jesus is
[47:58] telling us in the 16th verse here
[48:02] that will keep us from perishing now
[48:04] what does that perish that parish is not
[48:07] a physical parish
[48:09] because there's a lot of people today
[48:11] that denounce and do not and will not
[48:14] believe jesus christ and they're just as
[48:16] alive as anybody with blood coursing
[48:18] through their veins they can talk they
[48:19] can smell they can live their lives
[48:22] what's this perish that he's talking
[48:24] about
[48:25] it's a spiritual death it's a it's a
[48:27] separation
[48:29] from god
[48:30] just like in the garden of eden what was
[48:32] that death god told adam you do this
[48:36] you'll die
[48:37] adam did that did he die not physically
[48:40] right but there was a separation that
[48:42] took place between god and man yes you
[48:44] never read after that where god came
[48:46] down in the cool of the evening and
[48:48] spoke with adam lift to ear like he did
[48:50] before the fall
[48:52] didn't do it anymore because it was a
[48:54] separation
[48:56] what was this to be our vision now jesus
[49:00] giving us a new vision what is it it's
[49:02] the coming back together
[49:04] of god in man how through jesus christ
[49:08] and the blood that he shed at calvary
[49:10] was to bring the man and the human uh
[49:13] the god and the man back together again
[49:17] blessed
[49:18] is that man
[49:20] that sees this and knows that that word
[49:22] is being revealed to his heart
[49:25] and that vision of who jesus christ is
[49:28] the same one he told his disciples the
[49:31] same one back in the garden of eden the
[49:33] same one that solomon told us in
[49:34] proverbs 29 is the same vision that we
[49:37] are to have today
[49:39] that same vision
[49:42] if we have that
[49:44] we will not perish yes but have
[49:46] everlasting life
[49:48] amen now
[49:50] again to understand this parish is not a
[49:53] physical parish
[49:55] it's an understanding that there's been
[49:56] many of people that have passed away in
[49:59] christ jesus since his crucifixion that
[50:02] have actually died physically and gone
[50:04] into grave
[50:06] but again
[50:07] that's not what he's talking about right
[50:10] you will not perish spiritually
[50:13] will be with me for eternity
[50:16] will have everlasting life eternal life
[50:21] that's that vision that's where that
[50:23] vision leads us to oh saints if that
[50:26] vision just doesn't stay in front of us
[50:29] day and night
[50:30] every moment of our lives that vision is
[50:33] there
[50:34] oh it's so easy sometimes we we
[50:37] we spend so much time and so much effort
[50:41] especially in this message i hate to say
[50:43] it but we spend so much time and effort
[50:45] on on looking at other people and the
[50:48] faults and the mistakes and the things
[50:50] they do or where we get so
[50:53] caught up in the vision of so many other
[50:55] that we just lose track of what we're
[50:57] supposed to be looking at hey we lose
[51:00] track of what our vision is supposed to
[51:02] be yes it's not supposed to be at my
[51:05] brother or sister whom the blood of
[51:07] jesus christ covers them as well
[51:11] but we get our vision so
[51:13] scrupled up sometimes we have so much
[51:15] effort in looking at
[51:17] other things instead of instead of the
[51:19] vision god gave us instead of the vision
[51:22] that he's telling us that we will not
[51:25] perish
[51:26] praise the lord that's the vision that
[51:28] god give us that we maintain for him all
[51:31] the time
[51:32] should not perish
[51:34] but have everlasting life thank god for
[51:36] that vision
[51:38] he keeps giving it to man
[51:40] he keeps giving it to us
[51:43] amen day after day that vision it
[51:46] doesn't fail
[51:47] it just keeps on going
[51:49] amen
[51:50] that vision that vision is of christ
[51:53] it's not of william branham
[51:56] amen amen it's not a voice of god no no
[51:59] it's not a church or a pastor right it's
[52:03] christ it's the same vision
[52:05] that william branham came and showed us
[52:07] to pointed us it's the same vision that
[52:10] john the baptist came and said there he
[52:12] is follow him amen it's that same vision
[52:15] the vision hasn't changed
[52:17] people have changed but he has not
[52:20] for god sent not his son into the world
[52:22] to condemn the world look
[52:25] and
[52:26] how many times that seems like that's
[52:28] the attitude that people have
[52:30] god come for the
[52:31] purpose of condemning man
[52:33] they're sinners and should be judged as
[52:36] sinners amen
[52:37] what if god had come walking your
[52:39] pathway and you were sitting just like
[52:41] them would you want the same thing
[52:43] amen what if your loved one what if your
[52:45] family member or someone is sitting in
[52:48] that seat of the uh uh
[52:50] of unbelief are you going to sit in the
[52:52] seat of the scornful
[52:54] amen i tell you friend
[52:57] it's a bad spirit today that people have
[52:59] that that
[53:01] uh
[53:02] they don't seem to care unless it hits
[53:05] their doorstep right
[53:07] it doesn't matter all the stuff going on
[53:09] everything happening around the world
[53:10] around the country doesn't matter until
[53:12] it hits their doorstep and then all of a
[53:14] sudden there's a big uprising oh
[53:16] goodness we can't have this this can't
[53:18] be like this we shouldn't have to put up
[53:20] with this well
[53:22] where have you been this has been going
[53:23] on for a year two years five years
[53:25] whatever
[53:26] whatever the situation has been going on
[53:28] forever and they only care now because
[53:30] it's on their front door that's right
[53:33] that's the same vision people have today
[53:35] and a lot of times unfortunately
[53:36] christians think oh god just come just
[53:38] just condemn the world no he didn't
[53:40] jesus christ came to shed his blood to
[53:42] save the world
[53:44] to save all of humanity
[53:47] that should be our vision not on you're
[53:49] going and you're not and you're a sinner
[53:51] and you're going to hell and you're this
[53:53] and judging everybody just sending
[53:54] everybody know
[53:56] what our vision should be jesus even
[53:59] said in james
[54:01] that he by his will he would that all
[54:04] would repent and come to the glory of
[54:06] god
[54:07] amen amen he doesn't predestinate by his
[54:10] will but that's what his will was if
[54:12] that's what his will was and what should
[54:14] be our vision
[54:16] what should be our will our will should
[54:18] be the same thing
[54:20] we're too quick to put people in hell
[54:21] instead of lifting them into heaven
[54:24] we're too quick of putting people down
[54:26] instead of trying to lift them and edify
[54:28] them build them up
[54:29] help them
[54:31] amen be good to them let people see
[54:34] jesus through you
[54:36] amen let jesus let let people see jesus
[54:40] through you
[54:41] amen i believe that yes
[54:46] god didn't send his son into the world
[54:47] to condemn the world but that the world
[54:49] through him might be safe thank god for
[54:52] that because i was a part of that
[54:54] amen
[54:55] thank you lord he that believeth on him
[54:58] is not condemned but he that believeth
[55:00] not is condemned already because he had
[55:02] not believed in the name of the only
[55:04] begotten son of god
[55:06] and this is the condemnation that light
[55:09] has come into the world and men loved
[55:11] darkness rather than light because their
[55:14] deeds were evil excuse me are evil i
[55:17] should say
[55:18] for everyone that doth evil hateth the
[55:21] light neither cometh to the light lest
[55:23] his deeds should be reproved
[55:25] but he that doeth tr uh doth trust
[55:28] cometh to the light that his deeds may
[55:31] be made manifest that they are uh raw in
[55:34] god
[55:37] the vision that god's giving us
[55:40] that our vision should always stay on
[55:43] our vision should always
[55:45] be in
[55:46] what we should be looking at
[55:50] is the vision that god's given us
[55:54] to
[55:55] to continue
[55:56] to press
[55:59] the vision the word the revelation that
[56:02] he has shown us
[56:06] and being a blessing to those
[56:08] that are around us
[56:15] amen look at this
[56:20] no wonder
[56:21] in the scripture now
[56:23] the woman with the blood issue
[56:25] no wonder the little woman could touch
[56:26] his garment and be healed by it and a
[56:30] drunken soldier could spit in jesus face
[56:34] and feel nothing at all
[56:37] the woman touched him and virtue left
[56:40] christ
[56:41] came into her so much virtue came out of
[56:44] christ it healed her of
[56:46] probably what we know today as cancer a
[56:48] blood issue
[56:50] she was healed
[56:51] but a soldier would come and spit in
[56:53] jesus face and felt nothing whatsoever
[56:56] take a read hit him in the head nothing
[56:58] at all strip his clothes down naked feel
[57:00] nothing at all
[57:03] so you see it depends
[57:05] on what the person's looking at
[57:07] one person was looking at a god as
[57:09] savior as as a as a healer the other was
[57:12] just looking at him as a malfactor
[57:15] as someone that deserved to die the
[57:17] worst death on a on a cross
[57:20] what was their vision see
[57:22] it's a reason one could do it one way
[57:24] and one could do it feel no no virtue at
[57:26] all
[57:27] depends on how you approach it depends
[57:30] on what you're looking for when you uh
[57:33] when you go to church
[57:36] it depends on what you're looking for
[57:39] amen
[57:40] again i'll go back to the title
[57:43] what is our vision
[57:46] what did we come in here looking for
[57:48] today i'll just say right now let's just
[57:50] make it personal with us right now what
[57:52] was our vision what was the purpose why
[57:56] what were we expecting
[57:58] we expecting to hear from god today
[58:01] yes amen
[58:02] then that's what you're going to get yes
[58:05] were you expecting just to come and have
[58:07] a nice social gathering and go home have
[58:10] something to eat go home
[58:11] that's what you're gonna get yes depends
[58:14] on what you're looking for
[58:15] what did you come for
[58:17] because what you come for is what you're
[58:19] gonna get
[58:20] amen if you come to hear if you come to
[58:23] see him if you come to hear from him if
[58:25] you come to have him
[58:27] move in your life and touch you and the
[58:29] spirit of god to move among this place
[58:31] and to change lives that's what's going
[58:33] to happen
[58:34] lord amen that's what's that's that's
[58:36] the vision if you expect that vision to
[58:39] come into your life into it and for it
[58:41] to change you you say well i've been
[58:44] born again i'm a believer i've been i've
[58:46] been a christian for 30 40 years
[58:49] so
[58:51] i've been preaching for 33 years so
[58:55] it doesn't matter
[58:57] from glory to glory he's changing me yes
[59:00] i want to continue to grow every day in
[59:03] the lord
[59:04] i want every day
[59:06] my life to reflect him more today than
[59:09] it did yesterday yes
[59:11] and more tomorrow yes i want my life to
[59:13] grow to a place that people can see
[59:15] jesus in me more now than they did
[59:18] yesterday
[59:19] next week
[59:20] i want to get on that plane this
[59:22] afternoon and go to my job and have
[59:24] everyone on my crew look at me in a
[59:26] different way yes
[59:28] you're different than you were two weeks
[59:30] ago well in what way i'd like you to
[59:33] explain it to me
[59:34] they probably couldn't but it'd be nice
[59:36] to hear
[59:39] i won't i want to be that much more
[59:41] closer to him can we change absolutely
[59:43] yes can we get closer to him absolutely
[59:46] can we become more like him absolutely
[59:50] that should be our vision
[59:52] our goal our pain
[59:54] amen
[59:55] let it be to us lord according to your
[59:57] word look at this man now st luke
[59:59] chapter 19.
[1:00:02] this is a very good
[1:00:03] story
[1:00:06] kind of made into
[1:00:08] in a lot of ways because of the song
[1:00:10] that was written about zacchaeus
[1:00:13] a little kids song
[1:00:14] but this is a very serious story
[1:00:17] this is a very serious situation that
[1:00:19] nicodemus uh was living through at this
[1:00:22] time
[1:00:23] uh zacchaeus excuse me not nicodemus
[1:00:25] zacchaeus was living through it this
[1:00:26] time
[1:00:27] it's uh luke 19
[1:00:30] verse 1
[1:00:34] luke 19 1.
[1:00:36] now we're getting into a contrasting
[1:00:39] vision from nicodemus
[1:00:41] now you got two men you got two very
[1:00:44] successful men
[1:00:45] you got two uh uh
[1:00:48] one's a businessman in the church and
[1:00:50] the other is just a businessman
[1:00:52] so they're both
[1:00:54] somewhat equally uh
[1:00:58] philanthropists uh
[1:01:01] entrepreneurs businessmen
[1:01:03] successful
[1:01:05] people of statute
[1:01:09] zacchaeus and nicodemus
[1:01:11] but look at the difference
[1:01:14] luke 19 1 and jesus entered and passed
[1:01:17] through jericho
[1:01:18] behold there was a man
[1:01:20] named zacchaeus
[1:01:22] which was the chief among the publicans
[1:01:25] and he was rich
[1:01:27] and he sought to see jesus who he was
[1:01:31] and could not for the press because he
[1:01:33] was little of statute
[1:01:36] and he ran before and climbed up into a
[1:01:39] sycamore tree to see him for he was to
[1:01:41] pass that way now
[1:01:43] the difference in nicodemus now and
[1:01:45] zacchaeus
[1:01:47] nicodemus came by night they both wanted
[1:01:49] to see him they both had something to
[1:01:51] say
[1:01:52] but nicodemus came by night zacchaeus
[1:01:55] came during the day in front of
[1:01:56] everybody
[1:01:58] zacchaeus was so determined because he
[1:02:00] was a short fellow that he climbed up in
[1:02:02] a tree just to make sure he got a vision
[1:02:06] of jesus
[1:02:09] he was that determined
[1:02:11] i like the story the way brother brown
[1:02:13] tells it he goes over and grabs his own
[1:02:15] nasty garbage can or something and moves
[1:02:16] it up next to the tree and man probably
[1:02:18] in a three-piece suit and rich man you
[1:02:20] know the hair and everything and
[1:02:22] everything perfect in line 400 pair of
[1:02:24] shoes and
[1:02:26] getting up into the sycamore tree just
[1:02:28] so he can get a vision of jesus
[1:02:31] you imagine
[1:02:33] man of the little chapter he ran before
[1:02:35] climbed up into the sycamore tree to see
[1:02:37] him for he was to pass that way and when
[1:02:40] jesus came to the place he looked up and
[1:02:42] saw him and said unto him zacchaeus
[1:02:46] make haste and come down for today i
[1:02:49] must abide at thy house
[1:02:52] amen now
[1:02:54] zacchaeus was so determined
[1:02:56] to see jesus
[1:02:58] that when jesus walked by
[1:03:00] he stopped
[1:03:02] at exactly the tree he was up in he
[1:03:05] looked up at him
[1:03:08] i mean how did he know he was there
[1:03:11] well because he was god
[1:03:13] and he looks up at him he says zacchaeus
[1:03:17] now how did he know his name
[1:03:21] because he's god and he says zacchaeus
[1:03:24] come down and make haste because i'm
[1:03:26] going to go eat with you today
[1:03:28] i'm going to go sup at your house
[1:03:31] how many of you would be receptive to
[1:03:33] that call
[1:03:35] well he does it all the time
[1:03:37] does he not right he wants to stuff with
[1:03:39] us all the time
[1:03:41] he always wants to be a part of our
[1:03:43] lives he always wants to come into our
[1:03:45] rooms our homes sister norm is saying
[1:03:47] the song about that room
[1:03:49] amen he always wants to come into that
[1:03:51] house he always wants to go into that
[1:03:53] room he always wants to be a part of our
[1:03:55] lives he always wants to sup with us
[1:03:58] praise the lord zacchaeus just had the
[1:04:00] corporate body of god jesus standing
[1:04:03] there telling i'm going to go eat with
[1:04:05] you today
[1:04:06] oh can you imagine now
[1:04:08] it's surprising zacchaeus didn't just
[1:04:10] fall out of the tree
[1:04:12] but
[1:04:13] he got out of the tree somehow
[1:04:16] and he made haste came down received him
[1:04:19] joyfully when they saw it they all
[1:04:21] murmured saying that he was gone to be
[1:04:23] guest with the madness to see exactly
[1:04:25] what we were saying earlier
[1:04:27] so ready to condemn
[1:04:29] so ready to put down so ready to judge
[1:04:33] this man who
[1:04:36] they didn't even make an account
[1:04:39] to understand that jesus first knew he
[1:04:41] was up there second knew his name
[1:04:46] how is he to know that
[1:04:48] and then tell him i'm going to come and
[1:04:49] eat with you today they're already
[1:04:51] condemning him first thing
[1:04:55] my what was their vision they were
[1:04:57] probably there as critics anyway
[1:05:00] they were probably there trying to find
[1:05:01] something wrong with jesus to begin with
[1:05:04] you know what friend it's just like the
[1:05:05] way you came here today
[1:05:08] you're going to get what you come for
[1:05:10] they got exactly what they came for they
[1:05:12] were looking for something to condemn
[1:05:14] and when they saw jesus do this what was
[1:05:17] the first thing they did they condemned
[1:05:19] them for it right oh he's going to go
[1:05:21] eat with a uh with a sinner with a rich
[1:05:24] man that's probably robbed all kind of
[1:05:25] people wealthy man
[1:05:28] which most of them probably garnered a
[1:05:29] lot of the wealth that they had in their
[1:05:31] church from men like him
[1:05:34] oh my that's a whole other story
[1:05:36] but
[1:05:37] the first thing they did was condemn him
[1:05:41] look at the contrast of visions
[1:05:44] between zacchaeus and those men that
[1:05:46] were following jesus not his disciples
[1:05:49] of course but the men that were
[1:05:50] following along with jesus just like
[1:05:52] they went down to the river when john
[1:05:54] the baptist came out there
[1:05:56] and they said oh we're we're believers
[1:05:58] we're here to support you and help you
[1:06:00] and john the baptist said you're a snake
[1:06:02] in the grass right he said if you're
[1:06:05] here for sincere purposes you show me
[1:06:08] some fruits of your repentance
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:12] that's the exact same thing they came
[1:06:14] they got what they came for
[1:06:17] they came to criticize they came to find
[1:06:19] something wrong and in their eyes they
[1:06:21] found it
[1:06:22] but it didn't matter because zacchaeus
[1:06:24] got what he came for too
[1:06:27] amen he got exactly what he came for his
[1:06:30] vision was to see christ he was going to
[1:06:32] do it at all it costs in all expense and
[1:06:35] he got to see him
[1:06:37] not only did he get to see him
[1:06:39] but jesus went to eat with him
[1:06:42] 8th first zacchaeus stood and said unto
[1:06:44] the lord behold lord the half of my
[1:06:47] goods i give to the poor there you go
[1:06:50] amen how can i love him without loving
[1:06:52] you right
[1:06:54] and if i have taken anything from any
[1:06:57] man by false accusation i restore him
[1:06:59] fourfold
[1:07:02] amen we'll say he was a rich man yeah
[1:07:04] but he didn't have to do that
[1:07:06] in fact
[1:07:07] a lot of people say that same thing oh
[1:07:09] yeah but they're rich but you don't you
[1:07:11] ever notice that a lot of the worldly
[1:07:13] rich people
[1:07:14] the the richer they are the more they
[1:07:16] want
[1:07:17] yes
[1:07:18] they don't want to give it they want
[1:07:20] more giving
[1:07:21] they want to make more
[1:07:23] i i say when is enough enough in my
[1:07:26] opinion
[1:07:28] when is enough
[1:07:31] enough for us
[1:07:33] well sometimes it's not it never is for
[1:07:36] some people right so you say oh he's
[1:07:38] rich didn't matter
[1:07:39] most of the time rich people like him
[1:07:41] businessmen rich people like him they're
[1:07:43] not giving out money they're trying to
[1:07:45] get more and more money right they're
[1:07:47] not gonna they're not gonna have a
[1:07:48] dollar go down their bank account unless
[1:07:50] it's not some kind of an investment
[1:07:52] that's gonna earn them more money or a
[1:07:54] tax dodge or something
[1:07:56] that's the truth that's so that's what
[1:07:59] money does to people amen the love of
[1:08:01] money is the root of all evil right
[1:08:04] and and jesus said unto him this day is
[1:08:07] salvation come to this house for so much
[1:08:11] as he also
[1:08:12] is a son of abraham
[1:08:15] praise the lord
[1:08:16] for the son of man is come to seek and
[1:08:19] to save that which was lost
[1:08:21] now contrast him as well with the rich
[1:08:24] young ruler
[1:08:26] think about the reach on brother he had
[1:08:28] the exact same opportunity the rich
[1:08:30] young ruler came to jesus
[1:08:33] purposely
[1:08:34] and called him good and jesus said why
[1:08:37] are you calling me good there's no good
[1:08:38] but god
[1:08:41] the rich young ruler had nothing but
[1:08:43] good things to say about him
[1:08:45] the rich young ruler wanted to see him
[1:08:47] he wanted salvation he even asked jesus
[1:08:50] he said how can i have eternal life
[1:08:53] how can i keep from
[1:08:56] john 3 16 happening to me where i perish
[1:09:01] and jesus said well you can do these you
[1:09:03] do these deeds you do these this works
[1:09:05] these things that you do and keep these
[1:09:07] commandments and rich young rulers all
[1:09:09] happy in his life in his heart he's
[1:09:10] thinking well i've done all those things
[1:09:12] since i was a youth
[1:09:14] i've kept all those commandments since i
[1:09:16] was a child i've got it made i'm a
[1:09:18] shoe-in to make it to heaven
[1:09:20] then jesus hit him where it hurt
[1:09:23] said then sell all you got give it to
[1:09:25] the poor
[1:09:26] he couldn't do that
[1:09:28] where's zacchaeus he said the half i
[1:09:31] have not not all but the half i have i
[1:09:34] give to the poor and if i've if i've uh
[1:09:37] uh cheated anybody i'll restore to them
[1:09:40] fourfold what i cheated from
[1:09:42] see the difference
[1:09:44] after that
[1:09:46] salvation was come to his house but
[1:09:48] after the rich young ruler he built more
[1:09:51] and more barns because he got more and
[1:09:52] more stuff
[1:09:53] he just got richer he just got more
[1:09:55] popular he just got more wealthy
[1:09:58] but you see at the end what happens to
[1:10:00] them right but you notice he got
[1:10:03] salvation where the rich young ruler did
[1:10:06] not
[1:10:07] right
[1:10:07] rich on ruler oh he loved his neighbor
[1:10:12] jesus told him love thy neighbors
[1:10:13] thyself
[1:10:15] oh i've done all these things
[1:10:17] well if you love your neighbors so much
[1:10:19] and sell all everything you've got and
[1:10:21] give it to them
[1:10:22] you say you love your neighbor so much
[1:10:24] then sell what you got and give it to
[1:10:26] them and take up your cross and follow
[1:10:27] me
[1:10:29] now he didn't love his neighbor quite as
[1:10:31] much as he confessed to did he
[1:10:33] because he couldn't do that
[1:10:35] he was a man of wealth and he wasn't
[1:10:37] willing to allow that well to go and
[1:10:38] look see how the different visions cause
[1:10:42] the different results
[1:10:45] zacchaeus and his vision and and the
[1:10:47] approach
[1:10:49] but what was one looking for
[1:10:51] one was looking for anything he had to
[1:10:54] do to get it he was going to
[1:10:56] and the other was just looking for a
[1:10:58] nice easy way to enter in without having
[1:11:00] to do a whole lot or give a whole lot or
[1:11:02] be anything there's a rich young ruler
[1:11:05] and it didn't matter because after that
[1:11:08] he got richer and richer and richer
[1:11:11] and that's what happens a lot of times
[1:11:12] to people when their vision
[1:11:14] what happens to their vision amen their
[1:11:17] vision changes
[1:11:20] our eyes should always stay on him i'm
[1:11:23] going to finish with this scripture i'm
[1:11:24] skipping a few things but amen uh
[1:11:27] revelation chapter 3
[1:11:33] revelation chapter 3 we'll read a few
[1:11:35] verses of scripture here close just a
[1:11:37] minute revelation chapter 3 let's go to
[1:11:40] the 14th verse
[1:11:43] amen 14th verse
[1:11:50] praise the lord
[1:11:52] revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of
[1:11:54] course this is talking about the
[1:11:56] laodicean church age the laodicean
[1:11:58] church and of course the church age
[1:12:01] uh unto the church of the laodiceans
[1:12:03] right these things say at the amen the
[1:12:06] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:12:08] of the creation of god who is that
[1:12:11] that's jesus right in the scripture you
[1:12:13] see that's jesus the beginning of the
[1:12:15] creation of god again speaking of
[1:12:17] himself that beginning of creation
[1:12:20] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:12:22] cold nor hot
[1:12:24] i would thou were cold or hot so then
[1:12:26] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:12:28] cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my
[1:12:30] mouth
[1:12:31] because thou sayest listen now thou
[1:12:35] sayest who is it this layout to see an
[1:12:37] age
[1:12:39] because thou says
[1:12:40] that i am rich and increased with goods
[1:12:43] and have need of nothing
[1:12:45] knows not that thou art wretched and
[1:12:48] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[1:12:52] he said i counsel thee because it
[1:12:54] knoweth it not see knoweth it not thou
[1:12:57] art wretched miserable poor blind
[1:13:01] blind and naked willingly remember the
[1:13:03] scripture tells us willingly they
[1:13:07] for that are willingly ignorant of the
[1:13:10] truth
[1:13:11] willingly ignorant they are blind
[1:13:13] willingly
[1:13:14] amen blind poor blind naked i counsel
[1:13:18] thee
[1:13:19] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[1:13:22] thou mayest be rich
[1:13:24] and white raimen now that rich is not
[1:13:26] with the world's wealth and goods
[1:13:29] that rich is in the lord amen the goods
[1:13:32] of god
[1:13:34] the blessings of the lord in our lives
[1:13:36] that's the that's the riches that we
[1:13:38] obtain by being a christian by being a
[1:13:41] godly holy ghost-filled son or daughter
[1:13:43] of god
[1:13:44] the riches of god that thou maybe is
[1:13:46] rich not in the world's wealth but in
[1:13:49] the wealth of god with white raiment
[1:13:51] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:13:53] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:13:56] anoint
[1:13:58] amen
[1:13:59] anoint thine eyes with eye salve
[1:14:02] that thou mayest see
[1:14:06] put on the eye sound
[1:14:08] because at this point
[1:14:10] and you know as well as i do
[1:14:12] as
[1:14:14] a person born in this world a human
[1:14:17] you're born a certain way you look at
[1:14:20] things a certain way yes when you get
[1:14:22] into the spiritual realm and going to
[1:14:25] church or something or whatever religion
[1:14:27] people may follow
[1:14:29] they look in a certain way they see
[1:14:32] by a vision
[1:14:34] and as this vision begins to develop in
[1:14:37] their lives
[1:14:38] it begins to develop naturally
[1:14:41] and
[1:14:43] humanity
[1:14:45] and in our humanity and our carnality
[1:14:48] we see certain things with our eyes
[1:14:50] natural
[1:14:53] but jesus says here you're poor and
[1:14:55] blind naked rich wretched miserable
[1:14:58] blind to buy i sat
[1:15:03] anoint thine eyes with isaf
[1:15:06] so that there's that point
[1:15:08] that a person comes to it that i hope
[1:15:10] trust believe we've all come to that
[1:15:12] point
[1:15:13] where that eye sab has been applied by
[1:15:15] the holy spirit to allow you to be able
[1:15:18] to see things differently
[1:15:21] not in a natural like nicodemus but like
[1:15:24] zacchaeus in the spiritual to see
[1:15:26] something that's beyond what you
[1:15:28] understand as a human that it's telling
[1:15:32] you that it's saying
[1:15:34] that that word begins to expound to you
[1:15:37] and that the vision of christ becomes so
[1:15:39] real
[1:15:40] that everything else begins to fade away
[1:15:43] everything else loses its luster
[1:15:45] everything else becomes a secondary
[1:15:48] thing
[1:15:49] matthew said seek ye first the kingdom
[1:15:52] of god and his righteousness and all
[1:15:54] these things will be added to you what
[1:15:56] is first him what's the vision him that
[1:15:59] i self what does it do it'll change your
[1:16:02] vision
[1:16:03] it'll change your vision from a natural
[1:16:05] clouded vision of just the uh
[1:16:10] the normalities of life to that
[1:16:12] spiritual
[1:16:13] realm the spiritual life that that god
[1:16:16] wants to show us in himself in his word
[1:16:18] that zacchaeus saw
[1:16:20] that his disciples saw that god spoke of
[1:16:23] that that we see that solomon tells us
[1:16:26] that vision that points only to him
[1:16:30] that vision that drops the scales off
[1:16:34] our eyes so that we can see
[1:16:36] you say well
[1:16:38] how how can that be well you go back in
[1:16:40] the scripture and look go back to the
[1:16:42] very beginning and look in the garden of
[1:16:44] eden
[1:16:45] how did they receive a different vision
[1:16:49] than they originally had after the fall
[1:16:53] before the fall they had a specific
[1:16:55] certain vision
[1:16:56] did they not
[1:16:58] after the fall just like satan the
[1:17:01] serpent told
[1:17:02] you your eyes will be opened
[1:17:05] and you'll know good from evil you'll
[1:17:06] know
[1:17:07] bad for good and and you'll be as gods
[1:17:10] and all these
[1:17:12] and that did happen
[1:17:14] it was seen in a different way
[1:17:17] all of a sudden they realized they were
[1:17:19] naked
[1:17:20] and adam and eve clamored to find
[1:17:22] something to cover their nakedness
[1:17:25] and god comes down and begins to speak
[1:17:27] and now oh we got to get we got to hide
[1:17:29] we got to try to find some place to get
[1:17:30] away from him i i i i'm exposing myself
[1:17:34] like this but in his physical condition
[1:17:37] he was no different than he was before
[1:17:39] the fall
[1:17:41] he was just as naked
[1:17:44] before the fall as he was after
[1:17:46] he wasn't more naked after the fall
[1:17:51] his eyes just came open
[1:17:54] his vision changed
[1:17:56] he began to see things in a different
[1:17:58] way
[1:17:59] that he could not that that was veiled
[1:18:02] from him before
[1:18:04] he couldn't see it
[1:18:06] you think about the the tabernacle in
[1:18:08] the wilderness
[1:18:09] there were three veils in that
[1:18:11] tabernacle
[1:18:12] you go you look in the outside you can't
[1:18:15] see what's on the inside but if you go
[1:18:17] past that veil
[1:18:19] you can see what's on the inside but you
[1:18:21] can't see what's in the second realm
[1:18:23] you can only see what's out in the
[1:18:25] parlor the front room
[1:18:26] well if you go on the next one you say
[1:18:28] what you can see a whole different thing
[1:18:30] but you still don't know what's in the
[1:18:32] holies of holies right you still don't
[1:18:34] know what's behind that badger skin
[1:18:36] until you actually go behind it and
[1:18:38] nobody went behind there but the high
[1:18:40] priest
[1:18:41] and he had to do it exactly perfectly
[1:18:43] according to the scripture or he dropped
[1:18:45] as a dead man
[1:18:47] they had to put bells and pomegranates
[1:18:49] around the bottom of his garment so as
[1:18:51] long as they kept clanging and ringing
[1:18:53] they knew the man was okay but if he
[1:18:55] dropped dead and the bells quit ringing
[1:18:57] they they had a rope tied around his
[1:18:59] waist they didn't go in there and get
[1:19:00] him because they'd have dropped dead too
[1:19:02] they had a rope tied around his waist
[1:19:04] and when he went in there if he dropped
[1:19:05] dead they just pulled him out with the
[1:19:07] rope because they weren't about to go in
[1:19:09] there
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:12] but his vision changed each time
[1:19:15] you say nothing can change
[1:19:18] all the circumstances be the same but
[1:19:20] you look at it in a different way
[1:19:23] it's a different vision
[1:19:26] it's a different vision
[1:19:28] what's our vision
[1:19:30] what is your vision today yes
[1:19:33] what are we looking at
[1:19:35] what captivates our attention not just
[1:19:38] physically physically too absolutely i
[1:19:41] know we're talking about the spiritual
[1:19:42] vision and that's the more important but
[1:19:44] i'm talking physical too what has gotten
[1:19:46] your attention what gets our vision
[1:19:48] what gets our attention what keeps us
[1:19:51] continuing to press
[1:19:53] i know there's a desire in the human to
[1:19:55] want to live i understand that
[1:19:58] but to live not just to live
[1:20:01] or to live not just to exist
[1:20:05] a lot of people just exist
[1:20:07] i'm talking about living
[1:20:09] what is it that causes that
[1:20:11] that keeps you pressing
[1:20:13] what keeps us
[1:20:15] with the understanding in our heart how
[1:20:17] close we are
[1:20:20] looking
[1:20:21] in a vision for a rapture for a body
[1:20:24] change for the lord return
[1:20:27] what is this is keeping that
[1:20:29] before us
[1:20:30] amen because we know that that vision
[1:20:33] stays there yes
[1:20:35] let's don't get our eyes on all the
[1:20:36] other stuff friends say
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] keep our eyes focused only on him
[1:20:42] let our vision be him
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:46] and let him lead us and show us whatever
[1:20:49] that purpose and reasoning that he's got
[1:20:51] we continue to press this battle
[1:20:54] toward the prize of the
[1:20:56] high calling in christ jesus
[1:20:58] amen
[1:20:59] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:21:12] jesus christ himself came exactly
[1:21:16] exactly like the bible said he would
[1:21:18] exactly like the jews taurus said that
[1:21:21] he would
[1:21:22] and when he got there
