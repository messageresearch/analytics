[22:10] and then so let's remember him also and
[22:12] this in the entire situation family
[22:14] there in prayer if we could
[22:16] the lord would just move upon them grant
[22:18] them his grace and their lives
[22:20] um also as you all know
[22:23] uh sister joyce duggal passed away this
[22:25] week this week
[22:28] kind of
[22:31] seemed like out of the blue although
[22:32] sister joyce has had some heart issues
[22:35] for some time now
[22:36] i remember going to visit her many times
[22:38] in the hospital when she would be sick
[22:40] previous
[22:41] tmc and
[22:44] she's had congenital heart failure
[22:47] and i i don't know i don't even remember
[22:49] what else the sister's been through the
[22:50] lord has been so good to her and blessed
[22:53] her with so many more years and so many
[22:55] more times with her husband with her
[22:56] children grandchildren great
[22:57] grandchildren
[23:00] but it was her time
[23:01] so
[23:04] i say it with a very sad heart i love
[23:07] sister joyce very dearly
[23:10] as i do so many times with those that
[23:12] are close to
[23:17] sister joyce was a tremendous sister
[23:21] she was a matriarch of one of the great
[23:24] families that came to tucson tabernacle
[23:26] and she was a sister who was not afraid
[23:28] to speak her mind she wasn't afraid to
[23:30] stand for what she believed even when it
[23:32] came against
[23:34] her friends that believed contrary to
[23:36] her
[23:37] uh she didn't mind voicing those
[23:39] opinions she didn't mind telling others
[23:41] how she felt
[23:42] and she stood for me when so many people
[23:45] did not
[23:46] and i appreciate and loved her very much
[23:49] um
[23:50] she gave help and aid to lives that
[23:53] probably nobody many people will never
[23:55] know
[23:56] and countless ones that
[23:59] probably couldn't even be counted right
[24:02] her family children grandchildren
[24:05] great-grandchildren my wife just saw her
[24:07] last saturday morning not yesterday but
[24:09] a week ago at her great-grandson's
[24:11] funeral that we talked to you about
[24:13] uh she seemed fine she's doing good
[24:16] um
[24:17] so
[24:19] we saw her a couple weeks ago when
[24:20] brother roger came to visit we went to
[24:22] longhorn for lunch and she was there she
[24:24] stopped and stood there and talked for
[24:26] 10 15 minutes
[24:28] she's just just she's just that kind of
[24:29] sister
[24:32] there's so much more i could say but
[24:34] with the
[24:34] sake of time and service today
[24:37] i don't have any details of service if
[24:39] anybody does please feel free to raise
[24:42] your hand or mention it i don't have any

[33:17] mentioned about it and then sister
[33:18] priscilla sent me a prayer request that
[33:20] we want to pray for and lay hands on

[37:58] which is in heaven
[38:00] many will say to me in that day lord
[38:02] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[38:04] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[38:07] in thy name done many wonderful works
[38:10] then will i profess unto them i never
[38:12] knew you depart for me ye that work
[38:15] iniquity
[38:17] therefore whosoever heareth these
[38:19] sayings of mine and doeth them i will
[38:21] liken him unto a wise man which built
[38:23] his house upon a rock the rain descended
[38:26] and the floods came and the winds blew
[38:28] and the beat and beat upon that house
[38:30] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[38:33] a rock
[38:34] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[38:36] of mine and do with them not shall be
[38:38] likened unto a foolish man which built
[38:40] his house upon the sand
[38:42] and the rain descended and the floods
[38:44] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[38:47] that house and it fell and the and and
[38:50] great was the fall of it amen you could
[38:53] be seated if you'd like
[38:56] amen we're going to have a little bit of
[38:57] a bilingual service today very little
[39:00] bit of a bilingual service
[39:03] um i had the title of this today la roca
[39:06] my wife thinks i'm crazy when i try to
[39:08] speak any spanish with a southern accent
[39:11] but i'm doing it anyway
[39:14] the title today la roca
[39:17] and that's it i'm done that's all the
[39:18] bilingual you're getting today
[39:21] that's not all i know so
[39:23] the rock amen i want to title this the
[39:25] rock today there's a little church
[39:27] actually down well it's not a little
[39:29] church but uh on orange grove right at
[39:31] thorny dale called la rocca it is the
[39:33] rock the church the rock uh but uh i
[39:37] want to speak on this today it's
[39:38] something that the lord gave me kind of
[39:40] as a as a i guess you'd say an offshoot
[39:43] from last week and something the lord
[39:44] had given me to say and sometimes
[39:46] oftentimes when the lord gives something
[39:49] and he just drops something fresh
[39:51] something else comes from it and this
[39:53] came from that i wasn't really sure of
[39:56] that until i came in here in prayer and
[39:58] yesterday i really didn't know
[40:01] uh but after the breakfast yesterday
[40:03] morning and i enjoyed the brothers
[40:04] breakfast so god bless you thank you
[40:06] those who were able to come and were
[40:08] there with us and just enjoyed the
[40:09] fellowship but after and coming over
[40:12] here and spending some time with the
[40:13] lord
[40:14] uh he put that on my heart and reminded
[40:16] me of that so uh and then started giving
[40:19] me some scripture so one of the
[40:21] scriptures we just read now i want to
[40:24] begin this again the title is the rock
[40:27] amen we know that jesus is the rock we
[40:29] talk about a lot of attributes of jesus
[40:32] and we talk about a lot of uh
[40:35] characteristics that jesus has and
[40:38] so many times we we seem to fail to
[40:40] mention and talk about how jesus is that
[40:43] rock
[40:44] he's the anchor the stabilizing force
[40:47] but we must also remember and the thing
[40:49] that a lot of the thing that separates
[40:51] as this scripture tells us that
[40:54] separates the true believer from the
[40:56] make-believer is that rock amen jesus
[40:59] here said they come and they said lord
[41:02] and they call them lord said we've done
[41:04] this in your name we've done this in
[41:06] your name and people say well yeah they
[41:08] call on jesus name well
[41:12] but what is their foundation built on
[41:14] if their foundation isn't built on
[41:16] christ the wrong they can say they come
[41:19] in his name all they want but right here
[41:21] he says depart from me ye that work
[41:23] iniquity i never even knew you
[41:26] you never had relationship with me
[41:29] you never were a part of my life you
[41:31] never came in and had intimate relations
[41:33] with me i did not know you i don't i
[41:36] didn't know you then and i don't know
[41:38] you now
[41:39] you might have mentioned the name jesus
[41:40] or called and implored that name which
[41:42] anybody can do but we go on to find out
[41:45] that jesus said only those that i
[41:47] acknowledge and recognize are the ones
[41:49] that do the will of the father
[41:52] the ones that
[41:53] do what i tell them to do the ones that
[41:55] follow my words if you follow not my
[41:59] words then you don't belong to me it
[42:01] doesn't matter matter how many times
[42:03] they call on the name jesus it doesn't
[42:05] matter how many songs they sing or how
[42:07] much
[42:08] is written about it it's irrelevant if
[42:10] the foundation is not the rock
[42:13] not just a rock but the rock it's got to
[42:17] be jesus christ the rock and unless that
[42:20] foundation is laid on there it doesn't
[42:23] matter we talk about the statue of a
[42:25] perfect man we talk about us being the
[42:27] the housing of the holy spirit we talk
[42:30] about uh ourselves being built up and
[42:33] those things but friend
[42:35] we can have the most beautiful most
[42:37] perfect most uh eloquent most uh
[42:40] uh a holy building that you could
[42:43] imagine but friend if that building is
[42:45] not laid on the foundation of jesus
[42:47] christ then none of it matters
[42:50] none of it matters and see that's the
[42:52] sad part about it so many times because
[42:54] you see people trying to build these
[42:56] spiritual houses
[42:58] but they haven't dug down deep enough to
[43:01] get down to that foundation of jesus
[43:04] christ to lay that there so that when
[43:06] the winds come and the storm blows the
[43:09] house stands right
[43:11] they don't go down deep enough they
[43:13] don't get in there hard enough sometimes
[43:15] people just say uh just come and say
[43:17] well i'm a christian okay you got it
[43:19] you're a christian
[43:21] friend sometimes you gotta dig down deep
[43:24] you gotta get down in to get down to
[43:26] that foundation and lay that spiritual
[43:29] building on that foundation
[43:32] some people come in this message and
[43:34] they feel like they can lay their
[43:36] foundation on william branham right you
[43:39] cannot lay your foundation on william
[43:41] branham it will not work
[43:43] it will be destroyed when the winds blow
[43:46] and the storms come
[43:47] it won't stand
[43:49] some people
[43:50] probably
[43:52] laid their
[43:53] on perry green
[43:55] right you can't do that right you can't
[43:57] lay your foundation on any man
[44:00] on any other man jesus christ
[44:03] you can't lay your foundation on any
[44:05] human
[44:06] anybody that's uh that seems to be a
[44:09] godly good person and that's fine and i
[44:12] would guarantee you if either one of
[44:14] those brothers was here in the flesh
[44:15] right now they would tell you audibly
[44:17] that i am right
[44:19] and don't you dare build your christian
[44:21] foundation in your home and you that
[44:23] spiritual household either one of them
[44:26] they would tell you that personally i
[44:27] believe that but unfortunately
[44:29] so many times it seems like it happens
[44:31] that way people come in the message and
[44:33] say i know the message and they read the
[44:35] books and they get the quotes and they
[44:37] get the the special things that they can
[44:40] say like we talked about last week with
[44:41] the nomination they have their famous
[44:43] little quotes and their famous little
[44:45] scriptures and their specific things
[44:47] that that's and that's their foundation
[44:49] it's almost like a religion
[44:51] or politics
[44:53] you listen and sometimes you listen to a
[44:56] republican speak and they say the exact
[44:58] same thing all the time
[44:59] you listen to a democrat and they're
[45:01] called talking points they have their
[45:03] little talking well blah blah blah and
[45:05] just say these few little words and i
[45:07] guess now they call the word salad but
[45:09] they just say a bunch of stuff and it
[45:11] means nothing
[45:12] they use 50 words and say absolutely
[45:15] nothing
[45:16] because it's all just a bunch of
[45:18] jibber-jabber it's all a bunch of
[45:20] talking points and that's what
[45:21] unfortunately we have in
[45:23] in religion
[45:25] different denominations have their
[45:26] talking points
[45:28] the message has their specific
[45:30] scriptures or their specific quotes
[45:32] that's where they go all the time friend
[45:34] they're laid on the wrong foundation
[45:36] amen your foundation has got to be dug
[45:39] down and and
[45:41] gotten down to that bedrock
[45:44] which is jesus christ yes amen jesus
[45:47] christ christ is that roxy a rock builds
[45:51] a solid foundation let's let's read
[45:54] another account of this over in uh st
[45:56] luke
[46:01] now remember anybody can call themselves
[46:03] a christian anybody can
[46:06] as long as you're not a mute you can say
[46:09] i'm a christian
[46:11] but the problem is does your life line
[46:13] up to your testimony very much
[46:16] brother ram said don't jump any higher
[46:17] you can live yes
[46:19] amen
[46:20] i believe in the gifts of spirit and i i
[46:23] prayed that that manifest in each one of
[46:25] us and whatever they are stir that gift
[46:28] up whatever it is yes but friend the
[46:30] gift's not not going to save you right
[46:33] uh
[46:34] a a few quotes your scripture is not
[46:36] going to save you it's not going to be
[46:37] that that foundation that you need that
[46:40] when all the things in friend you know
[46:42] as well as i do the storms come
[46:44] they're going to continue to come and
[46:46] they're going to beat against that house
[46:48] and they're going to smash and the waves
[46:50] are going to come and the wind's going
[46:51] to blow and the sand is going to knock
[46:53] and
[46:54] all that can be done is going to be done
[46:56] to make sure that you are built on that
[46:58] that solid rock foundation of jesus
[47:01] christ and not
[47:03] a doctrine right
[47:05] not a system
[47:07] not a denomination
[47:09] not a not an individual not a pastor a
[47:11] prophet or a person
[47:13] no it's it has to be on jesus christ yes
[47:18] nothing else
[47:19] and they say i'm a christian but what
[47:21] does that really mean
[47:22] what does it mean to people what does it
[47:24] mean to us what does it mean to you to
[47:26] say i'm a christian what does that mean
[47:28] to you when i say i say i'm a christian
[47:31] i
[47:32] testify to other people and say i'm a
[47:34] christian what does that mean to me
[47:36] i don't know what it means to them
[47:39] but i know what it means to me
[47:41] and what does it mean to be a christian
[47:42] it doesn't mean just that i can say that
[47:45] or just that i come to church once in a
[47:47] while or i participate or i read the
[47:49] bible or pray a little bit or something
[47:51] it doesn't mean that because people do
[47:53] that all the time like like jesus just
[47:55] said here they said we did this in your
[47:57] name this and your name this and your
[47:59] name this and your name we we forsake
[48:02] all we did all this in your name jesus
[48:04] he said i don't even know you right
[48:07] you call on my name but i don't even
[48:09] know you why didn't jesus know them
[48:11] because they weren't obedient to the
[48:12] word
[48:14] and christ is the word yes amen
[48:18] you cannot have a revelation of the word
[48:21] of god unless you have a revelation of
[48:23] who jesus christ is
[48:26] and you cannot have a revelation of who
[48:28] jesus christ is unless your spiritual
[48:31] house is built on that foundation yes
[48:35] christ the rock cannot be
[48:38] if it's built there then the house will
[48:40] be built up there
[48:42] saint luke
[48:44] uh chapter 6 verse 40 uh
[48:46] 46.
[48:50] verse 40 chapter 6 verse 46
[48:55] jesus said why call ye me lord lord and
[48:59] do not the things which i say
[49:03] isn't that just a wholesale
[49:07] witness of what christianity seems to be
[49:10] in most circles today
[49:13] you call yourself a christian you say
[49:16] unto me lord lord but you don't do what
[49:18] my word tells you to do
[49:21] you're not obedient to the scripture
[49:24] you're not obedient to the word and how
[49:26] can you call yourself a christian if
[49:28] you're not obedient to what he tells you
[49:31] to what his word says
[49:34] why do you live like that why do you
[49:36] dress like that why do you act like that
[49:39] and call yourself a christian
[49:42] amen
[49:44] christians not a word it's a life
[49:47] yes
[49:49] it's not a a phrase
[49:51] it's not a club
[49:53] that you join
[49:55] it's a life
[49:57] it's a foundation
[49:59] it's something
[50:01] everyone that's ever going to be a part
[50:03] of him that is built up in
[50:07] it's him
[50:09] 46
[50:11] uh 46 we just read why do you say lord
[50:14] and did not do what i tell you
[50:17] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[50:19] sayings and doeth them i will show to
[50:23] you whom he is like
[50:25] he is like a man which built a house and
[50:28] dig deep
[50:30] amen
[50:31] dig deep
[50:33] some people don't want to take what
[50:34] comes
[50:35] what what it takes to be a christian
[50:37] they don't want to do what it takes they
[50:39] don't want to
[50:40] commit themselves to the to the
[50:43] well i i'll just say the work
[50:47] the struggle
[50:49] the
[50:51] what it takes to get down to that
[50:53] foundation
[50:55] the only way you can get down to that
[50:56] foundation is to get rid of everything
[50:58] else that's cluttering
[51:01] it's like we talked about last week
[51:02] people leave denominations and and try
[51:05] and come in this message and they bring
[51:06] that garbage with them
[51:08] i mean they might die out to some of it
[51:10] but they some of their ideologies and
[51:12] some of their foundation fundamental
[51:14] beliefs they bring with them and try to
[51:16] bring and integrate it into this message
[51:18] right and it just doesn't work
[51:21] you gotta die you gotta dig deep
[51:24] you gotta throw all that other out and
[51:26] dig down to that foundation you gotta
[51:28] get past that denomination you gotta get
[51:30] past that pastor you gotta get past
[51:32] whatever anybody said because this
[51:34] relationship is between you and him
[51:38] this relationship is between you and
[51:40] christ and you and christ alone
[51:43] it's not you brother adam and christ
[51:45] it's not you me and christ not you
[51:47] brother green and christ it's you and
[51:49] christ and christ alone
[51:51] period
[51:52] amen
[51:54] so you got to dig down to that you got
[51:56] to get down to that foundation he says
[51:58] dig deep
[51:59] some people just don't want to do the
[52:01] work they just want to come in and say
[52:03] i'm a christian i'm a message believer
[52:06] i think oh i wear uh a hat or a tie or
[52:10] something
[52:11] and there's nothing wrong with any of
[52:12] that friend but that doesn't that
[52:14] doesn't testify to god who you are right
[52:17] amen might destify to somebody out of
[52:19] here in the world that you you identify
[52:21] yourself as such and such but has christ
[52:24] identified you as such and such am i
[52:27] well he hasn't if it's not on that
[52:28] foundation dig deep you got to get down
[52:31] deep friend and laid the foundation on a
[52:34] rock
[52:35] shall i say the rock
[52:38] jesus christ now the metaphor here
[52:40] christ is using for a literal house on a
[52:43] rock
[52:44] but that representing us that house of
[52:48] god built on zero
[52:50] the foundation
[52:52] amen
[52:54] and uh on iraq and when the flood arose
[52:58] the stream beat the intimately upon that
[53:00] house and could not shake it
[53:03] i like that
[53:05] for it was founded upon a rock
[53:07] could not shake it oh my that's
[53:10] wonderful friend you know it just tells
[53:12] us if your foundation is jesus christ it
[53:14] doesn't matter what comes to you you're
[53:16] not going to be shaken by it it doesn't
[53:18] matter what doctrine swings your way it
[53:19] doesn't matter what somebody as well it
[53:22] tries to tie these stuff together and
[53:23] try to
[53:24] make some great news something that it
[53:26] doesn't matter any that comes it's not
[53:28] going to sway you
[53:30] it's not going to change you it it it's
[53:32] not going to shake you
[53:34] amen because you know what your
[53:36] foundation is yeah when
[53:38] when trials come it's not going to shake
[53:40] you when that went and and it's going to
[53:43] beat friend
[53:45] you know that those winds are going to
[53:47] come those waves are going to be hard
[53:50] but it doesn't shake you
[53:52] because you know what's foundation is
[53:54] you know what you are built upon
[53:57] and you know regardless and you know it
[53:59] comes that when you're on that
[54:01] foundation that foundation holds
[54:04] it's not the house is holding it's the
[54:06] foundation that's holding see that's the
[54:09] problem a lot of the people think that
[54:11] they have in this world their security
[54:13] and they built that and they say they
[54:14] built these oh new big uh buildings that
[54:18] will withstand hurricanes and with stain
[54:22] uh withstand earthquakes and and
[54:24] withstand tornadoes friend there is no
[54:27] such thing
[54:29] there isn't there may be some that they
[54:31] have the technology that might help a
[54:34] little bit better but when god takes
[54:36] california and shakes her so bad
[54:39] underneath there and a single building's
[54:41] gonna stand right
[54:42] not one
[54:44] amen i don't care how
[54:46] technically advanced they are in
[54:48] building these buildings when that
[54:49] foundation is not settled it's not
[54:52] stable it's not on that rock it will
[54:54] shake down amen amen
[54:57] it will shake down
[54:59] the stream beat vehemently upon that
[55:01] house but it could not shake it for the
[55:04] foundation was on a rock
[55:06] was it the house
[55:08] amen it was the foundation
[55:11] was it that the house being built good
[55:13] that's fine it should be
[55:16] but it's the foundation that what keeps
[55:18] it from blowing over
[55:20] that keeps it from crumbling to the
[55:22] ground is the foundation
[55:24] that foundation is the most important
[55:26] part
[55:28] people we we always talk about that the
[55:30] statue of a perfect man i'll read it
[55:32] here in just a few minutes and and the
[55:34] building up and all but it's the
[55:36] foundation that's the most important
[55:37] part you can have the most beautiful
[55:40] building you can have the most
[55:41] technologically advanced you can have
[55:43] million
[55:44] multi-million dollar house setting on
[55:46] but if it's not on that foundation
[55:48] friend it will be shaken down
[55:51] amen it will be
[55:54] but he that heareth and doeth not is
[55:57] like a man that without a foundation
[55:59] built a house upon the earth against
[56:02] which the stream did beat vehemently and
[56:04] immediately it fell and the ruin of that
[56:07] house was great
[56:09] the ruin of the house was great when it
[56:12] fell now how many times
[56:14] have we noticed and seen especially in
[56:16] these last days
[56:18] that
[56:19] people had apparently their houses their
[56:22] spiritual houses built upon something
[56:25] other than the rock right
[56:28] what happens to it
[56:31] when a little something comes
[56:33] i i've had people try to convince me
[56:36] that brother branham was not the prophet
[56:37] for this day
[56:39] i've had people try to convince me that
[56:41] he lied
[56:42] and that
[56:43] stories were fabricated in garbage like
[56:46] this
[56:47] i've had people ask me oh this brother
[56:50] has a compelling evidence uh i'll send
[56:53] it to you i said brother don't bother
[56:57] don't bother i'm not going to listen to
[56:59] it i don't want to listen to it and even
[57:02] if i did listen to it it's not going to
[57:04] shape me
[57:05] so it doesn't matter you can come with
[57:08] the biggest title wave tsunami you want
[57:10] and try to beat me upside the head with
[57:12] it but this man is stable and steady and
[57:16] is not going to be shaken i don't care
[57:17] what they say
[57:19] am i now come to find out when you
[57:20] really dig deep
[57:23] you find out what they've found out is
[57:25] garbage right it's not even true
[57:28] amen
[57:29] trust me i've looked at i've looked at
[57:31] all of it that i could find and it's all
[57:33] garbage and lies
[57:36] and lines even about the clout lies i've
[57:38] had people that i've heard that try to
[57:40] dispel the cloud and they're telling
[57:43] fabrications it's lies it's not even
[57:46] true
[57:49] don't worry doesn't shake me
[57:51] and they say also no no no
[57:54] i've told you before if somebody comes
[57:56] to some kind of doctrine or something oh
[57:58] wow brother branham said so and so no
[58:01] if it's what if if it's
[58:04] what the lord is behind he'll reveal it
[58:08] and he will
[58:09] he'll not only reveal it but then he
[58:11] will uh testify to it
[58:14] he does in my life anyway he will
[58:17] testify to it he will show that that is
[58:20] the truth he will manifest it in a way
[58:23] that we realize that's god
[58:25] we know that's god and nothing else
[58:27] shakes it so when somebody comes and
[58:29] says oh
[58:31] jesus came in 63 there's no more coming
[58:34] he's not coming
[58:36] he was he's here
[58:38] i used to see someone's in florida and
[58:40] the brother come up and said oh you
[58:41] can't sing that anymore he's not coming
[58:44] he's here i said well i know he's here
[58:46] but he's still coming
[58:47] right right amen oh no no no that that
[58:50] happened way back so and so on such and
[58:52] such and you start looking in the
[58:54] message find out if you if you take the
[58:56] little interpretation of what brother
[58:57] branham said about all that i said then
[58:59] you and me are both lost
[59:02] because that is for either one of us
[59:03] became christians
[59:06] one of them was before i was ever born
[59:09] now where are you
[59:11] i'm 56 now friend
[59:13] but it doesn't shake you understand
[59:16] people can come with whatever they want
[59:17] to come with but it doesn't shake
[59:19] because i my foundation is christ this
[59:22] word
[59:24] and if it goes off this word i don't
[59:26] care who tries to
[59:27] manipulate it doesn't matter
[59:30] amen my foundation is christ it's this
[59:33] word
[59:34] amen you can't build on anything else
[59:37] and expect it to stand
[59:39] because it won't
[59:40] it can
[59:42] now let's go to second peter let's talk
[59:44] about this statue for a few minutes
[59:51] the thing that we
[59:53] effectively as
[59:55] message believers call
[59:57] the statue of a perfect man brother
[59:59] bantam title
[1:00:01] the statue of a perfect man
[1:00:03] perfect
[1:00:04] being not
[1:00:05] sinless right
[1:00:07] perfect not being without fault or
[1:00:10] mistake no
[1:00:11] perfect being mature
[1:00:14] grown-up christian a mature person of
[1:00:17] full age
[1:00:19] that's what it means perfection not
[1:00:22] sinless perfection
[1:00:24] but a full age a grown-up
[1:00:27] a mature christian is that perfect man
[1:00:30] reaches that place
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] now look here um
[1:00:36] second peter chapter one
[1:00:38] uh we'll just start with verse one simon
[1:00:40] peter a certain apostle of jesus christ
[1:00:43] to them that have obtained like precious
[1:00:45] faith with us through the righteousness
[1:00:47] of god and our savior jesus christ
[1:00:50] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:00:53] through the knowledge of god and of our
[1:00:55] of jesus christ our lord
[1:00:58] according as his divine power has given
[1:01:01] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:01:03] life and godliness
[1:01:05] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:01:08] called us to glory and virtue
[1:01:10] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:01:13] great and precious promises
[1:01:16] that by these these promises ye might be
[1:01:20] partakers of the divine nature which is
[1:01:22] the holy spirit
[1:01:24] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:01:27] the world through lusts
[1:01:29] and beside this giving all diligence add
[1:01:32] to your faith virtue
[1:01:35] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:01:39] difference and to temperance patience
[1:01:41] and to patience godliness and to
[1:01:44] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:01:46] brotherly kindness charity
[1:01:49] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:01:53] not just in you but abound
[1:01:56] they make you that ye shall neither be
[1:01:58] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:02:01] of our lord jesus christ
[1:02:03] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:02:06] blind and cannot see afar off and had
[1:02:09] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:02:11] old sins wherefore the rather brethren
[1:02:14] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:02:16] election sure for if you do these things
[1:02:20] you shall never fall
[1:02:24] never fall
[1:02:26] well he talks to us about this
[1:02:28] statue of a perfect man
[1:02:30] and dares i say and i know this is on
[1:02:33] camera
[1:02:35] but dares i say there is a religion
[1:02:38] within this message
[1:02:40] that builds their entire foundation upon
[1:02:43] this right
[1:02:45] amen they build their foundation
[1:02:48] upon this
[1:02:49] upon this statue of a perfect man
[1:02:53] but your foundation cannot be faith
[1:02:57] you understand
[1:02:59] add your faith virtue but your
[1:03:01] foundation cannot be faith your
[1:03:04] foundation has to be jesus christ
[1:03:08] and your faith is in the foundation that
[1:03:12] you're setting on which is jesus
[1:03:14] christ if the bottom line of our
[1:03:17] building is faith
[1:03:20] faith in what
[1:03:23] what do you have faith in
[1:03:26] that if faith is the bottom line then
[1:03:28] what is there to have faith in
[1:03:30] it says add your faith virtue well how
[1:03:33] do you well then what is there to have
[1:03:35] faith in to add your virtue to what are
[1:03:37] you believing in
[1:03:39] what is your faith in
[1:03:41] it's got to be your faith has to be
[1:03:44] in the foundation that this building his
[1:03:47] house is laid on
[1:03:50] you've got to dig down deep first
[1:03:53] and once you get down to that bedrock
[1:03:55] foundation of jesus christ then you can
[1:03:58] lay faith on it
[1:04:00] and you can have faith in
[1:04:03] the rock that you are setting on
[1:04:06] and then you can add to your faith
[1:04:07] virtue
[1:04:08] and then from
[1:04:10] your virtue knowledge and tempers and
[1:04:12] then you build that house and that house
[1:04:15] will stand
[1:04:17] amen because it is laid on that
[1:04:20] foundation the rock it is laid on jesus
[1:04:24] if it's laid on anything else we know it
[1:04:26] won't stand
[1:04:27] but it's got to be on that foundation
[1:04:29] it's got to be on that rock it has to be
[1:04:32] on jesus christ or it doesn't matter how
[1:04:35] beautiful and wonderful your faith is
[1:04:37] oh
[1:04:38] faith healers i lay my hands on somebody
[1:04:41] they're immediately well that's just a
[1:04:43] gift of the spirit
[1:04:44] that doesn't mean your foundation's on
[1:04:46] christ oh but they have great faith yeah
[1:04:49] but faith in what where is your faith
[1:04:51] you say well they have faith that's good
[1:04:53] but if it's not on that solid foundation
[1:04:56] then what is it because again that's
[1:04:58] just the gift of the spirit
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:03] amen and then turn around and disobey
[1:05:06] the word
[1:05:07] about whatever life they're living or
[1:05:09] whatever word they're preaching right
[1:05:11] disobeying the word
[1:05:13] sorry the foundation is not on jesus
[1:05:15] christ oh we've done many mighty works
[1:05:18] jesus i never even knew you and they try
[1:05:22] to show their works to you
[1:05:24] as a proof that they're a christian
[1:05:27] friend your works don't prove you're a
[1:05:29] christian your life proves you're a
[1:05:30] christian
[1:05:32] amen how will they know that you're my
[1:05:35] disciples when you have love one for the
[1:05:38] other that's a life lived
[1:05:40] amen that's a that is an evidence of
[1:05:42] proof that shows through your life that
[1:05:45] you do
[1:05:47] amen and you can't fake it
[1:05:49] i people can for a little while and try
[1:05:52] to manufacture something along the lines
[1:05:54] because you can have anybody can have
[1:05:56] faith everybody does have faith the
[1:05:58] bible says every man has been dealt the
[1:06:01] measure of faith everybody's got faith
[1:06:03] right whether you're christian or not
[1:06:04] you've got faith
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:07] it just it builds from there but if the
[1:06:09] foundation is in jesus christ the words
[1:06:11] of what's the faith in amen
[1:06:14] the church
[1:06:17] i'm in the message
[1:06:19] denomination
[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:21] your bank account your job politics what
[1:06:24] is your foundation what is your faith in
[1:06:26] at that point oh my faith is in jesus
[1:06:28] then you obey the word
[1:06:30] you live the word you obey what christ
[1:06:33] said here
[1:06:34] in a holiness
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:37] in a holy
[1:06:39] living
[1:06:40] is that your obedience
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:44] is it in the word yes praise the lord
[1:06:47] amen it's got to be yes of the
[1:06:49] foundation if it's not it's blown away
[1:06:51] yes amen
[1:06:53] and and if we do these things now when
[1:06:56] he mentions the building he talks about
[1:06:58] the building here and peter says
[1:07:02] when peter says add to your faith virtue
[1:07:04] virtue knowledge knowledge temperance
[1:07:05] temperance patience now some people
[1:07:07] believe
[1:07:08] that you have to
[1:07:10] you have to accomplish this entire list
[1:07:13] before you can even get the holy ghost
[1:07:15] well friend my contention is how can you
[1:07:17] have it without the holy ghost that's
[1:07:19] right
[1:07:21] amen you get the holy ghost the
[1:07:23] foundation and then you build on that
[1:07:26] if you're building on anything else
[1:07:27] other than that then you're on the wrong
[1:07:29] foundation right you got to get that
[1:07:31] first amendment amen what did what did
[1:07:33] paul even tell him he said do your first
[1:07:35] words over again
[1:07:38] do it do
[1:07:39] if there was no sincerity behind your
[1:07:41] repentance if there was no uh
[1:07:44] actual repent of spirit in you when you
[1:07:47] repented the god and got baptized then
[1:07:49] it didn't do any good
[1:07:51] if you weren't truly if you came to the
[1:07:53] lord and you repented you said lord i'm
[1:07:56] sorry forgive me if you weren't truly
[1:07:58] repentant of that
[1:08:01] it didn't matter
[1:08:02] he's on a cowhide
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:06] it didn't matter didn't mean anything
[1:08:08] you're your
[1:08:10] your testimony
[1:08:12] your life has to fit your testimony
[1:08:16] if your testimony is lord i'm sorry
[1:08:18] forgive me then what you're saying is
[1:08:20] lord i know this is wrong and i didn't
[1:08:22] mean to do it and i won't do it again
[1:08:26] amen amen
[1:08:28] that's what repentance is
[1:08:30] repentance doesn't mean that you're
[1:08:31] walking along in life and doing things
[1:08:33] you shouldn't all of a sudden you parse
[1:08:34] and say god forgive me i'm sorry and
[1:08:36] then you just keep walking
[1:08:38] no means you're walking you ask god
[1:08:41] forgive me i'm sorry i didn't mean to
[1:08:42] act that way or do those things and you
[1:08:44] turn and you go the other way that's
[1:08:45] right yes
[1:08:47] you live a different life because you're
[1:08:48] a different person
[1:08:50] you obey a different word you live a
[1:08:52] different life because you're a
[1:08:53] different person
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:56] then you become somebody different now
[1:08:58] when this when this building is built
[1:09:00] that we talk about this statue of a
[1:09:02] perfect man
[1:09:04] that's built up to godliness brotherly
[1:09:07] kindness and charity
[1:09:08] charity being the capstone of course
[1:09:10] which is literally christ himself so we
[1:09:13] understand that now jesus is the author
[1:09:17] the foundation and the finisher the
[1:09:20] capstone of us of our faith
[1:09:23] he's the author and finisher of our
[1:09:24] faith he's the beginning the foundation
[1:09:27] he is the end
[1:09:28] he is the alpha
[1:09:30] and he is the omega
[1:09:32] so he bookends
[1:09:34] this spiritual house
[1:09:36] christ the foundation which we always
[1:09:39] talk about the capstone but we forget
[1:09:41] the foundation a lot of times you want
[1:09:43] to add capstone you got to have the
[1:09:44] foundation right so he's the foundation
[1:09:47] he's that bedrock that we build this
[1:09:49] house on and then he comes and captures
[1:09:51] it
[1:09:52] amen now when that agape godly love
[1:09:55] comes and catches that individual
[1:09:57] then you know that it's been accepted by
[1:10:00] god
[1:10:01] it's been it's been a a tabernacle a
[1:10:04] house that is please pleasing to god and
[1:10:08] god receives you to himself
[1:10:11] that statute
[1:10:13] amen that that capstone that comes and
[1:10:16] caps you that that agape godly love
[1:10:20] that so we're now booked in this house
[1:10:23] is so what does it make us
[1:10:26] nothing special we're just his
[1:10:28] we're
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:34] omega beginning ending
[1:10:36] we're all his yes well for all he is
[1:10:39] we're going to do what he tells us to do
[1:10:41] it's like the children sitting here what
[1:10:43] is one of the greatest things that you
[1:10:44] know how they love you oh they can come
[1:10:46] and hug you and kiss you and that feels
[1:10:48] so good as a parent you love them to
[1:10:49] death
[1:10:51] but what makes you more proud is the
[1:10:53] fact that they listen and obey what you
[1:10:54] tell them amen
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:57] that's when you know that you've gotten
[1:10:59] somewhere you know that you've done
[1:11:01] something amen
[1:11:03] and it doesn't have to be
[1:11:05] a directive
[1:11:07] you understand it doesn't have to be
[1:11:09] that god comes and says okay you do this
[1:11:13] no
[1:11:14] it just means that when i walk and i
[1:11:16] live
[1:11:17] i'm doing it based on what he taught me
[1:11:21] amen i see some kids sitting here and
[1:11:24] they're being mostly sweet
[1:11:26] uh mostly quiet
[1:11:28] sitting obediently
[1:11:31] i think they wouldn't be that way if
[1:11:32] they weren't trained
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] their lives are a reflection of how they
[1:11:38] were taught
[1:11:39] it's not a directive you give them
[1:11:41] although you have to do sometimes
[1:11:44] you have to do that sometimes amen or or
[1:11:47] give a hand gesture or
[1:11:49] something
[1:11:52] protoplasm stimulation program said
[1:11:55] and that gets their attention
[1:11:58] but most of the time you set and see
[1:12:01] and that's the thing that makes the
[1:12:03] parent proud
[1:12:04] and that's the thing that makes god
[1:12:06] proud it's not that god comes down and
[1:12:08] says okay do this go here do this and he
[1:12:10] does that sometimes but the fact that we
[1:12:13] just live our lives based on his word in
[1:12:16] obedience to what he's told us to do
[1:12:20] he's given us the directive he just
[1:12:22] wants us to live it out
[1:12:24] he just wants us to be obedient to it in
[1:12:27] fact a lot of times the lord just lets
[1:12:29] us go and lets us once we get to a
[1:12:31] certain place and say well huh i just
[1:12:33] want to see how is she going to do this
[1:12:35] how is he going to act in this situation
[1:12:37] how did what is what is this going to
[1:12:38] bring in there how are they going to
[1:12:40] what are they going to say about this
[1:12:41] and see he
[1:12:43] he does that to make sure to see
[1:12:46] are we going to obey what he told us to
[1:12:48] do
[1:12:50] amen now
[1:12:52] you know just like the children we make
[1:12:54] mistakes and we might say something we
[1:12:56] shouldn't or get up in a spirit or anger
[1:12:59] or something we shouldn't and
[1:13:01] and act in ways that we shouldn't and
[1:13:02] god has to come and correct us
[1:13:05] amen but the thing that makes him the
[1:13:07] proudest is the fact that it doesn't
[1:13:10] have to be told every single time
[1:13:13] do this do this be this be that
[1:13:16] you do it because you know that's what
[1:13:19] he told you to do
[1:13:20] you live your life because you know
[1:13:22] that's what's pleasing to him through
[1:13:24] his word
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:27] and after that house is built after that
[1:13:29] building that god in brotherly kindness
[1:13:32] charity
[1:13:33] he says now if these things be in you
[1:13:36] and abound they'll make you neither bear
[1:13:39] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[1:13:41] lord jesus christ
[1:13:44] but he that likes these things is blind
[1:13:46] cannot see a falloff has forgotten that
[1:13:48] he was purged from his old sins
[1:13:49] wherefore the rather give diligence to
[1:13:51] make your calling and elections sure
[1:13:54] and if you do these things you shall
[1:13:56] never fall
[1:13:58] so now he goes and tells us about after
[1:14:00] the foundation is built
[1:14:02] or or after this house is built
[1:14:06] that we
[1:14:07] live unto that
[1:14:10] statue
[1:14:12] we live
[1:14:13] as instruments of that statue
[1:14:17] that faith that virtue that knowledge
[1:14:18] that tempers patience everything that's
[1:14:20] in it we live to that
[1:14:23] and as we live our lives to that if we
[1:14:25] hold that is at our standard the
[1:14:27] foundation the capstone you can not fall
[1:14:32] praise the lord
[1:14:33] it doesn't matter what comes
[1:14:36] you won't be shaken it doesn't matter
[1:14:38] what comes you cannot fall you can't
[1:14:42] why
[1:14:43] because he's the one that you're
[1:14:45] standing on
[1:14:47] and if you could fall at that point he
[1:14:50] can fall
[1:14:51] and we know he can't fall so if he can't
[1:14:54] fall then i can't fall because that's
[1:14:56] what i'm established here am i right
[1:14:58] that's what i'm standing on
[1:15:00] that's what's beneath me that's what's
[1:15:02] above me that's what's all over me
[1:15:05] in me
[1:15:06] around me
[1:15:07] all over us
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:10] you cannot fall impossible to fall
[1:15:13] let's go back over to matthew again
[1:15:15] chapter 16.
[1:15:25] amen
[1:15:29] now this
[1:15:32] that we talk about is it's only to the
[1:15:35] believer
[1:15:38] only to the believer this is not to the
[1:15:39] make-believer this is not to the
[1:15:41] unbeliever it's only to the believer
[1:15:44] because only the believer is going to
[1:15:46] believe the word
[1:15:48] to the point
[1:15:49] that they make it their absolute yes
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:53] that they make it their lives the make
[1:15:56] believer can fake it and look at this
[1:15:58] and believe that
[1:15:59] you know certain things
[1:16:01] i mean friends i've talked to people
[1:16:03] that claim to be i mean fundamental
[1:16:06] foundational people in this message that
[1:16:08] there are two or three
[1:16:10] things that we know in this message that
[1:16:12] we hold dear as true that they don't
[1:16:14] even believe
[1:16:16] and i've talked to them about it i said
[1:16:18] how could you not
[1:16:19] oh the bible doesn't say it exactly like
[1:16:21] that
[1:16:23] well
[1:16:24] you could you could find several things
[1:16:25] that brother branham taught us that you
[1:16:27] look in the scripture and say oh it
[1:16:29] doesn't say exactly that word no
[1:16:32] but you look at how that and that's what
[1:16:34] the gift of that prophet
[1:16:37] yeah that and i said okay if you want to
[1:16:39] dispel this that brother branham taught
[1:16:41] us that i mean was it's not just
[1:16:44] something simple but really
[1:16:46] a fundamental principle brother branham
[1:16:48] taught us in the scripture
[1:16:49] um
[1:16:50] and you want to dispel that i said then
[1:16:52] what about what authority do you speak
[1:16:56] to dispel it
[1:16:58] i know the authority brother branham
[1:17:00] spoke to bring it to us what is the
[1:17:02] authority you stand on to dispel what
[1:17:04] that prophet said right
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:09] i want to know
[1:17:11] jesus said if you can't believe me
[1:17:12] believe the words because they testify
[1:17:14] to who i am well if you believe the
[1:17:17] words you're going to believe the word
[1:17:20] if it's believed
[1:17:22] properly
[1:17:24] if you just follow an assign that's
[1:17:25] something different that that sign will
[1:17:27] lead you down to a dead end and
[1:17:28] obviously often to the abyss
[1:17:30] but
[1:17:32] if you don't if you don't see it that
[1:17:34] way then about what authority do you
[1:17:36] speak
[1:17:39] where is your prophetic gift
[1:17:41] where is your uh place in the scripture
[1:17:45] that that we can find
[1:17:47] and say that you have the authority to
[1:17:49] come against this what is your authority
[1:17:51] that you speak i know what brother
[1:17:53] branham says i don't have a question
[1:17:54] about that
[1:17:56] amen we all know that
[1:17:58] we know the man's life we know how he
[1:18:00] lived we know the things he did we know
[1:18:02] the miracles that happen we know all we
[1:18:04] know all those things
[1:18:06] so by what authority do you come against
[1:18:08] what god spoke to that man
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:13] nothing contrary to the scripture we
[1:18:15] know that brother branham couldn't bring
[1:18:16] anything contrary to the scripture
[1:18:21] matthew 16. i'll leave it at that
[1:18:24] matthew chapter 16. so we see this is
[1:18:26] only to the believer
[1:18:28] because only the true believer is going
[1:18:30] to believe it enough to receive it
[1:18:34] and then become it
[1:18:36] that word becomes them matthew 16
[1:18:40] verse 15.
[1:18:42] he uh
[1:18:44] let's start up at verse 13. matthew 16
[1:18:46] 13. when jesus came into the coast of
[1:18:49] syria philippi he asked his disciples
[1:18:51] saying who do men say i the son of man
[1:18:53] am
[1:18:54] they said some say thou art john the
[1:18:56] baptist some elias others jeremiah's or
[1:18:59] one of the prophets
[1:19:00] which
[1:19:03] listen
[1:19:06] this is where
[1:19:08] this is the point that
[1:19:11] many people get scrupled up
[1:19:16] and it follows this pattern
[1:19:20] some
[1:19:20] say who are these some
[1:19:24] they're people obviously men probably
[1:19:28] that are saying that you are john the
[1:19:29] baptist
[1:19:32] how could jesus be john the baptist when
[1:19:35] john the baptist baptized jesus
[1:19:39] you're the reincarnation of john the
[1:19:41] baptist really
[1:19:43] and we were the same age
[1:19:47] he baptized me and he's saying that
[1:19:49] jesus you understand
[1:19:51] they say well they look at something and
[1:19:54] all they see is what's in front of them
[1:19:56] it's like the world going crazy now
[1:19:58] don't get me wrong i think we're all
[1:20:00] destroying ourselves and i do believe
[1:20:02] that brother said that men would destroy
[1:20:04] themselves we're destroying the earth
[1:20:05] we're destroying ourselves but this
[1:20:07] green stuff
[1:20:09] and i'll say it that way
[1:20:11] so many times they get up and preach at
[1:20:13] you and all they care about is that
[1:20:15] thing right there
[1:20:16] oh you just plug it in the wall
[1:20:19] well they forget they forget how it
[1:20:21] comes from point a to here to plug it
[1:20:24] into the wall set oh well all you got to
[1:20:25] do is plug it in
[1:20:27] yeah but what does it take to get it
[1:20:29] from over there to that plug i don't
[1:20:31] tell you that part
[1:20:33] and see that's the problem that people
[1:20:35] have
[1:20:36] the parallels are just outstanding when
[1:20:38] you look at him you say that's exactly a
[1:20:40] lot of the way that people do they see
[1:20:42] that jesus said well wow that's like
[1:20:44] john he's john the baptist reincarnate
[1:20:46] and they forget everything that brought
[1:20:48] him to that point
[1:20:49] and the fact that they were together and
[1:20:52] that john baptized jesus and john
[1:20:55] declared jesus the son of the lamb of
[1:20:57] god and take away the sin of the world
[1:20:59] jesus is standing there and disciples
[1:21:01] come to jesus of john's and tell him
[1:21:04] tell john
[1:21:05] so and so such and such you go tell john
[1:21:08] that well why don't you just tell
[1:21:09] himself if he's a reincarnation of john
[1:21:12] but you understand all they see is right
[1:21:14] there and so many times that's all
[1:21:16] people see
[1:21:17] they don't see how it got to there
[1:21:21] people forget
[1:21:22] how does electricity get to this plug
[1:21:26] well you got to do this you got to do
[1:21:27] this you got to go through that you got
[1:21:28] to have
[1:21:29] coal fire plants and all this other
[1:21:31] stuff and all these things that have to
[1:21:32] make the power to bring it to bring it
[1:21:34] to here to begin with
[1:21:36] probably using more than they did if you
[1:21:39] just put some gasoline tank go amen
[1:21:43] that's my opinion
[1:21:44] but i've studied and i know there's
[1:21:47] there's a lot that goes into putting
[1:21:48] electricity in that plug friend right oh
[1:21:51] you just plug garden water be all right
[1:21:53] now
[1:21:54] you got to get electricity that plug
[1:21:56] somehow
[1:21:57] amen what are we going to do fill up the
[1:21:59] entire earth with a bunch of windmills
[1:22:01] and solar panels
[1:22:03] oh that that'd be a pretty sight
[1:22:05] wouldn't it to have all of our great
[1:22:07] landscape covered with all these huge
[1:22:08] panels and
[1:22:10] anyway
[1:22:12] again i said that prefacing i do believe
[1:22:15] we are killing ourselves
[1:22:17] i've said that before and brother brown
[1:22:19] said man we've killed themselves amen
[1:22:21] we've got that point i said so i say now
[1:22:24] are we better with these things are we
[1:22:26] better when they travel down the road on
[1:22:28] a horseback
[1:22:32] amen
[1:22:33] i say i say humanity is better off 100
[1:22:36] years ago than we are now
[1:22:37] people with all these advancements and
[1:22:39] all the technology and all the things we
[1:22:40] use them
[1:22:41] and and we use them for good but
[1:22:45] uh was humanity better than or better
[1:22:47] now
[1:22:48] but
[1:22:49] matthew 16
[1:22:50] uh
[1:22:52] he said
[1:22:53] you some say that john the baptist some
[1:22:55] say elijah jeremiah so the prophets he
[1:22:58] said unto them but who who but whom say
[1:23:00] ye that i am i'm not concerned about
[1:23:02] everybody else now i want to know what
[1:23:04] you think
[1:23:05] what is your opinion what do you say
[1:23:07] what are you guys saying when you're
[1:23:09] over there in the corner whispering to
[1:23:10] one another what is your opinion about
[1:23:12] who i am
[1:23:14] simon peter answered and said thou art
[1:23:16] the christ the son of the living god
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:20] spokesman speaking up
[1:23:23] big mouth peter
[1:23:25] let it known
[1:23:26] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:23:29] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[1:23:31] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[1:23:33] thee but my father which is in heaven
[1:23:35] and i say un also unto thee that thou
[1:23:37] art peter and upon this rock i will
[1:23:40] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:23:42] shall not prevail against it and i will
[1:23:44] give unto thee the keys to the kingdom
[1:23:46] of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bow
[1:23:48] on earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:23:49] whatsoever shalt thou shalt loose on
[1:23:51] earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:23:53] praise the lord that he charged him not
[1:23:55] to tell who he was what was he who was
[1:23:57] he because that that is not something
[1:23:59] that was to be public knowledge
[1:24:01] it was to the believer
[1:24:03] the believer as they stood there and i'm
[1:24:06] sure some of them
[1:24:07] maybe even weren't sure themselves but
[1:24:10] the spokesman stood up and said thou art
[1:24:12] the christ the son of the living god
[1:24:15] jesus said on that foundation
[1:24:17] on that rock
[1:24:19] i will build my church
[1:24:21] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:24:24] against it now it does not say that the
[1:24:27] gates of hell won't come against it
[1:24:30] right it just says the gates of hell
[1:24:32] will not prevail against it
[1:24:35] oh we know that the gates of hell come
[1:24:38] against it all the time brother adam
[1:24:40] said that all hell is out against this
[1:24:42] teaching
[1:24:43] we know that yes so that hell of that
[1:24:46] that that a spirit is going to come
[1:24:48] against it but it cannot prevail yes now
[1:24:52] you understand we see the theme that the
[1:24:54] lord gave yesterday
[1:24:57] amen
[1:24:58] you cannot fall
[1:25:00] you cannot fail it'll be but it will
[1:25:03] stand
[1:25:04] now he's standing here and says the
[1:25:06] gates of hell will not prevail
[1:25:10] praise the lord so
[1:25:13] if we can just get this one thing and
[1:25:15] understand
[1:25:17] that if our if that foundation if our
[1:25:19] building is built on christ that solid
[1:25:22] rock foundation
[1:25:24] that it cannot and you build your house
[1:25:27] on it
[1:25:28] you cannot fall amen it will not fall
[1:25:32] it cannot be broken down it cannot be
[1:25:35] torn down it cannot be prevailed against
[1:25:39] it will stand amen praise the lord now
[1:25:42] we've got four scriptures that the lords
[1:25:44] give us
[1:25:45] to recognize that in all the things that
[1:25:48] we see going on in the world and people
[1:25:51] that have left the christianity have
[1:25:53] left the church have left message
[1:25:55] that if it's built on a foundation not
[1:25:58] the message or not not brother branham
[1:26:00] that's not the message the message is
[1:26:02] the word but not a man
[1:26:04] not a pastor
[1:26:06] but on jesus christ
[1:26:09] and the problem is so many foundations
[1:26:11] are built today
[1:26:13] not on jesus christ's words right
[1:26:16] they're not
[1:26:17] they're built on a message or they're
[1:26:19] built on a denomination or they're built
[1:26:21] on a dogma
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:24] you've got to know the word for yourself
[1:26:27] yeah try to go witness to somebody and
[1:26:29] say and and have a disagreement about a
[1:26:32] certain doctrinal
[1:26:34] concept or scriptural concept and say
[1:26:37] oh well but brother branham said
[1:26:41] they're going to look at you like you're
[1:26:42] crazy
[1:26:44] shall i admit you to palo verde
[1:26:47] i'll
[1:26:48] usher you personally
[1:26:50] are you crazy who is
[1:26:52] brother branham is that your brother is
[1:26:54] he a younger brother older brother who
[1:26:56] is they don't know who you're talking
[1:26:57] about right you got to talk about the
[1:27:00] word
[1:27:01] the scripture
[1:27:03] amen if you talk about the scripture the
[1:27:06] word
[1:27:08] then you've got something and you can
[1:27:10] prove to somebody in the word
[1:27:13] not the foundation to say oh brother
[1:27:15] branham said brother graham said what
[1:27:16] did jesus say i know jesus used brother
[1:27:19] brown to say don't get me wrong in him
[1:27:21] but the foundation can't be william
[1:27:23] branham it's got to be this word yes
[1:27:25] okay
[1:27:26] then you go to somebody if your
[1:27:28] foundation is built on him then you can
[1:27:29] go to anybody you want you know where
[1:27:31] you stand yes and that devil will come
[1:27:33] against you and it will not prevail
[1:27:35] because you know where you stand that's
[1:27:37] why brother branham so many times would
[1:27:39] take his bible and say i challenge any
[1:27:41] one of you to come stand here right now
[1:27:43] and show me in this bible where i'm
[1:27:45] wrong right and not one of them would do
[1:27:48] it
[1:27:49] why not
[1:27:50] because he knew the foundation he was
[1:27:52] standing on yes
[1:27:53] amen it wasn't on him it wasn't on
[1:27:56] wesley or any other prior ministry or
[1:27:59] message or whatever he was standing on
[1:28:01] jesus christ this word
[1:28:03] that's how he could challenge him
[1:28:05] because he knew in here where he stood
[1:28:08] that's what we must absolutely know that
[1:28:11] we stand in this word yes we obey the
[1:28:14] word we live the word we become the word
[1:28:18] it is our father but it has to start
[1:28:20] with that foundation if it's not that
[1:28:21] foundation friend then we're in trouble
[1:28:24] that's what jesus was trying to tell
[1:28:26] them here i am that foundation
[1:28:29] i am the one that this is built on on
[1:28:32] this rock the revelation of who jesus
[1:28:35] christ is he's not the third person of a
[1:28:37] godhead he's not the 10th or 12th person
[1:28:39] he is god almighty himself amen and that
[1:28:43] rock is the one that this church
[1:28:46] that we
[1:28:47] will be built on yes
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:50] spiritual house is built on that who he
[1:28:53] is
[1:28:54] oh he's not he's not just one of a dozen
[1:28:57] he is god
[1:28:59] jesus christ is god he's the same
[1:29:01] yesterday today and forever yes he is
[1:29:04] praise the lord
[1:29:05] first peter let's go back first peter
[1:29:07] chapter 2.
[1:29:13] first peter i'm gonna
[1:29:15] close here in just a few minutes
[1:29:17] first peter chapter two verse
[1:29:20] chapter two verse nine or verse four
[1:29:22] excuse me four 429
[1:29:26] now remember peter is the one that
[1:29:29] that just was just given the keys to the
[1:29:31] kingdom of heaven
[1:29:32] peter was the one who stood up this big
[1:29:34] mouth man who stood up and
[1:29:36] i say that because sometimes he got his
[1:29:38] foot in his mouth it was so big so but
[1:29:42] but when the lord gave revelation there
[1:29:44] was something there
[1:29:45] and
[1:29:46] and this and and this is the same man
[1:29:49] peter peter's the one that spoke up and
[1:29:51] said thou art the christ is none of the
[1:29:52] living gods now if as the catholic
[1:29:55] church says
[1:29:56] that church was built on peter as they
[1:29:59] call their first pope
[1:30:01] then why does peter say right here the
[1:30:04] man that they say it was built on say
[1:30:06] right here that that rock he was talking
[1:30:09] about was jesus
[1:30:11] let's read it to whom coming as unto a
[1:30:14] living stone
[1:30:15] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:30:18] god and precious jesus christ
[1:30:22] ye also as lively stones ye also now
[1:30:27] praise the lord now we're transitioning
[1:30:30] ye also as lively stones or living
[1:30:34] stones or quickened
[1:30:37] been made alive by his spirit
[1:30:40] you as a holy ghost-filled christian
[1:30:43] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:30:46] house and a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:30:50] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god
[1:30:53] by jesus christ
[1:30:55] amen
[1:30:57] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:30:59] scripture
[1:31:00] behold i lay in zion a cheap cornerstone
[1:31:03] elect precious and he that believeth on
[1:31:06] him shall not
[1:31:09] be confounded
[1:31:11] or prevail against
[1:31:13] or overcome
[1:31:15] or fall
[1:31:17] right or knocked down
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:21] shall not be confounded you won't be
[1:31:23] shaken friend
[1:31:25] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:31:27] precious but unto them which uh which be
[1:31:30] disobedient
[1:31:32] disobedient to the word
[1:31:34] the stone which the builders disallowed
[1:31:37] the same as men that made the head of
[1:31:38] the corner which is the literal
[1:31:40] foundation the building block of a house
[1:31:43] the most important part
[1:31:46] and a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[1:31:48] offense even to them which stumble at
[1:31:51] the word being disobedient whereunto
[1:31:53] also they were appointed
[1:31:56] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[1:31:59] priesthood and a holy nation of peculiar
[1:32:02] people that ye should show forth the
[1:32:04] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:32:07] of darkness into his marvelous life
[1:32:10] praise god the transition my friend is
[1:32:13] complete
[1:32:14] you have laid your foundation on jesus
[1:32:17] christ that solid rock
[1:32:19] and now you as a lively stone you who
[1:32:23] have been quickened you who had been
[1:32:26] made alive by his spirit who were once
[1:32:28] dead in sins and trespasses are now made
[1:32:31] a quickened lively stone a royal
[1:32:35] priesthood a holy nation
[1:32:39] a peculiar people

[1:32:44] foundation

[1:32:48] unto that rock to offer spiritual
[1:32:51] sacrifices to him
[1:32:53] amen

[1:32:58] to bring forth and show forth jesus
[1:33:00] christ as he is the same yesterday today
[1:33:03] and forever
[1:33:04] our lives are to be lived to manifest
[1:33:07] this word to a lost and dying world amen

[1:36:26] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:36:36] so many times friends it seems
[1:36:39] the issues that people end up having
[1:36:42] they have different issues for different
[1:36:44] reasons
[1:36:45] people end up having issues in the
[1:36:47] message or
[1:36:48] they believe or don't believe
[1:36:51] their foundation wasn't laid properly
[1:36:54] it didn't dig down deep enough
[1:36:56] it happens a lot of times now don't get
[1:36:58] me wrong but it happens a lot of times
[1:37:00] to children who grow up in this message
[1:37:04] because they're just
[1:37:07] offspring of
[1:37:10] mom and daddy who were in the message
[1:37:11] and they just
[1:37:13] they grew up gnawing on the pew and
[1:37:15] falling asleep and living and growing up
[1:37:17] in the fuse and they don't ever get that
[1:37:19] experience for themselves
[1:37:21] they don't ever get they don't ever get
[1:37:23] to where they their parents dug down but
[1:37:26] the kids they just inherently are
[1:37:28] already there and they don't dig down to
[1:37:30] get for themselves
[1:37:32] to dig down to get to that foundation
[1:37:34] because see at that time their
[1:37:37] foundation is mom and daddy
[1:37:39] right and and that's denominational like
[1:37:41] we talked about last week oh why are you
[1:37:43] a methodist well my dad was a methodist

[1:37:53] i'm a baptist because my daddy was a
[1:37:54] baptist and i see that's the nomination
[1:37:56] yes you're not in this message because
[1:37:58] mom and daddy was you've got to dig down
[1:38:00] that foundation yes you see it a lot of
[1:38:03] kids that are raised in this message you
[1:38:05] have to dig down into that foundation
[1:38:07] yourself
[1:38:08] amen don't put your foundation on mom
[1:38:11] and daddy yes your foundation has got to
[1:38:14] be in the in christ that solid rock
[1:38:17] i mean it's in it's in mom and daddy
[1:38:19] until you get to the age of
[1:38:20] accountability but there comes that time
[1:38:22] where you shed that and you've got to
[1:38:24] have christ for yourself
[1:38:26] as every individual has to do

[1:42:26] rock friend and you got problems
[1:42:29] amen people have spiritual problems
[1:42:31] because their foundation is not in that

[1:42:36] help us lord amen
[1:42:38] thank you jesus god bless you prayed
[1:42:40] something said to bless you today amen
[1:42:43] what a wonderful god we serve
[1:42:45] amen remember the lord a couple weeks
[1:42:47] we'll have communion foot washing two
[1:42:49] weeks
[1:42:51] two weeks till easter you kind of tell
[1:42:53] because it's getting hot
[1:42:54] outside but uh i say hot
[1:42:58] i say that with tongue and cheek because
[1:43:00] it's gonna be in another month or so
[1:43:02] it's gonna be 110 and
[1:43:05] we'll wish it was this again
[1:43:07] but
[1:43:09] thank the lord uh he still watches over
[1:43:11] us
[1:43:12] and he blesses us but easter is in a
[1:43:14] couple of weeks so lord willing we'll um
[1:43:17] we'll observe the communion in foot
[1:43:19] washington on on that sunday we'll have
[1:43:21] a little message and even joy that uh
[1:43:24] community watching the lord give us so
[1:43:26] amen
[1:43:28] um haven't thought anymore well i have
[1:43:30] thought about it but i haven't made any
[1:43:32] more progress on trying to have a
[1:43:34] get-together dinner especially since
[1:43:37] uh craig has rented the place next door
[1:43:39] now so we can't use that
[1:43:41] i'm sure he probably has a place for us
[1:43:43] but he always keeps wanting to put me in
[1:43:45] one of those places upstairs up here and
[1:43:46] i didn't really want to have us to go
[1:43:49] up down the stairs and
[1:43:51] some of you may have trouble getting up
[1:43:53] the stairs i don't know but
[1:43:55] um
[1:43:56] so we'll just see maybe we'll just just
[1:43:59] get a place at a restaurant or something
[1:44:00] i don't know but if you have any ideas
[1:44:02] let me know i'd still like to do it have
[1:44:04] a fellowship together it's just nice
[1:44:06] when we have a room all to ourselves and
[1:44:08] it's just our room and we can just use
[1:44:11] it for us and fellowship and not have to
[1:44:12] worry about
[1:44:13] anybody maybe i just get the hotel room
[1:44:15] down here or a
[1:44:16] conference room or something maybe and
[1:44:18] we'll do it there
[1:44:19] but anyway we'll see how the lord
[1:44:22] provides but i still want you to know
[1:44:24] it's on my heart i like to do it i
[1:44:26] appreciate
[1:44:29] craig even told uh sounded like he was
[1:44:31] still doing it but y'all probably heard
[1:44:33] it but i walked in i've made friends
[1:44:35] with the worker here and talked to him
[1:44:37] about every time i come and he said that
[1:44:39] he would be done by the time we started
[1:44:41] service didn't sound like he was but
[1:44:44] but he said he said that craig told him
[1:44:48] to stop when we start service
[1:44:50] so i thought that was real nice
[1:44:52] that that the man who owns the place
[1:44:54] would tell his worker don't you work
[1:44:56] while they're having church
