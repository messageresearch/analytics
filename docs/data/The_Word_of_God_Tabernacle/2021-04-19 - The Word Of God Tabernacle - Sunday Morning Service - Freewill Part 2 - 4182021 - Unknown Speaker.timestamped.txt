[24:30] this morning
[24:31] uh the person that she had been praying
[24:33] about to help
[24:34] find a a home everybody
[24:37] yeah uh his name is derek
[24:40] he got accepted into a rooming home
[24:42] yesterday and he wanted to start
[24:44] and on top of that he wants to start
[24:46] growing like greens i guess plants and
[24:47] things
[24:49] to supplement his income and god had
[24:53] placed someone in there the house
[24:55] manager works in a nursery
[24:57] that does that sort of thing and um
[25:00] wants to
[25:00] introduce him to other nurseries to help
[25:02] him you know
[25:03] keep growing uh some plants that's
[25:06] that's really awesome of the lord
[25:08] and the way he works things so he's
[25:10] gonna start growing things and he has a
[25:11] place to live now so that
[25:12] is amazing she says it took him six
[25:16] months to find the right place with the
[25:17] right training built in so
[25:19] i praise god for that
[25:23] anyone else and i just want to ask
[25:25] people if they could
[25:27] keep it in their prayers to lead and
[25:30] guide me because when i go down there
[25:32] it takes so much time that i have to go
[25:34] in do what i've got to do
[25:36] and then get out of there before dark
[25:39] it's hard for me to drive home
[25:41] and um and and there just really isn't
[25:43] time he's
[25:44] he's you know because of his chemistry
[25:47] and stuff he's
[25:48] so there i just have to make time to go
[25:51] over there or talk to him on the phone
[25:53] or something
[25:54] to try to get other people maybe over at
[25:57] love divine or somebody that's over in
[25:59] that area
[26:00] i can tell you where he's at if he's on
[26:03] your heart
[26:04] to go and mentor this brother he needs
[26:07] fellowship he needs mentoring this is
[26:11] god's beloved he's given his heart to
[26:13] the lord
[26:14] he doesn't know where to go what to do
[26:16] where to turn to
[26:18] he needs mentoring brothers
[26:22] and it's gonna be out of your way it's
[26:25] gonna be
[26:25] probably way out of your way you know i
[26:28] don't know how important it is to you
[26:31] but if you can if god puts it on your
[26:34] heart i pray he does
[26:36] um i'll tell you where he lives
[26:40] and uh you know that god would just help
[26:42] him leading
[26:43] guide him and and he wants to be
[26:46] baptized
[26:47] and he wants the holy ghost and there's
[26:49] only one place i know
[26:51] where he can guarantee get the holy
[26:53] ghost
[26:54] now i had to wait 18 months after i was
[26:57] baptized because
[26:58] i just didn't get it but god said he
[27:01] would baptize immediately
[27:03] that people would be over in dawsonville
[27:06] georgia
[27:06] in that baptism and there is videos of
[27:09] god
[27:10] honoring his word and so he wants to go
[27:15] and i don't want to take a chance on him
[27:17] with the way he thinks
[27:19] of going to into the baptismal somewhere
[27:22] and then waiting 18 months or
[27:24] you know to get the holy ghost i want i
[27:27] want him to be successful so that he can
[27:31] start
[27:31] this this right way you know and um
[27:35] so i just please i covet your prayers

[44:39] church and just don't see things happen
[44:41] i hear people say that all there's going
[44:42] to be a quick powerful word
[44:44] i hear all these uh looking for all
[44:46] these signs and all these things friend
[44:48] and god keeps moving
[44:50] around us and i don't want us to lose
[44:54] a uh aspect of what god's doing
[44:58] yeah of of the things that god is doing
[45:00] in our church and in our midst and with
[45:02] our families and
[45:04] the the blessings that god's given us
[45:06] yes uh
[45:07] you know where's that book of acts
[45:09] friend it's happening
[45:11] just just don't lose that uh
[45:14] attraction that thought of what god's
[45:16] doing here you realize
[45:18] last week i mean i i know we still have
[45:20] prayer requests
[45:22] those things were struggle we struggling
[45:24] we trust god we believe god
[45:26] you know but there was two
[45:29] outstanding miracles last week that were
[45:32] testified in this little room
[45:34] yes and i don't want us to lose uh the
[45:37] the
[45:38] the perspective of that yes amen sister
[45:41] julie and my daughter sister tabitha
[45:43] and the miracles that god has performed
[45:45] in their lives do you know that
[45:48] some of you may not know this but
[45:50] tabitha went to a doctor that actually
[45:52] said she had
[45:53] lupus now that's just a devil
[45:57] that's just another fancy name for a
[45:59] devil yes
[46:00] but god has touched and healed her
[46:05] people want to look around and say oh
[46:07] you got to go overseas or something
[46:09] there's no
[46:09] there are miracles happening right now
[46:12] you don't
[46:12] know how some of you may not know how
[46:15] sister julie has
[46:16] suffered over the past i don't know how
[46:18] many weeks or months it's been
[46:21] with this thing that the lord's touched
[46:22] her with now
[46:24] it's it's just the miracles that god is
[46:26] doing
[46:27] in our homes and our families and our
[46:29] midst delivering and
[46:31] healing and blessing us and i i again i
[46:35] just want to make sure we understand
[46:36] what's going on around us
[46:38] yes what god is doing and the things
[46:41] that god is touching us with
[46:43] the miracles he's here
[46:45] [Music]
[46:47] don't don't uh don't think he's all he's
[46:50] here right now
[46:51] he's here today he's here in our lives
[46:54] you know
[46:56] i haven't heard anything necessarily new
[46:58] about the building except that they're
[46:59] still
[47:00] in the process of moving over so we can
[47:03] have our own place
[47:04] but do you realize that the the lord
[47:07] basically funneled us to this place and
[47:10] that
[47:10] uh outside of maybe the first or second
[47:13] service or something like that
[47:15] every time mike is always first one to
[47:17] get here he comes in
[47:18] this place is exactly like we left it
[47:21] hallelujah
[47:22] you know that when me and my wife met
[47:24] this man the general manager here
[47:27] he had this all set up as a conference
[47:29] room that he told us that he rents his
[47:31] place
[47:32] regularly this place gets he told us
[47:34] this place gets
[47:36] rented on a regular basis and i thought
[47:39] okay well you know as long as we can
[47:41] have that sunday morning he said no we
[47:42] haven't had a sunday morning in a while
[47:44] and at that moment they had a facility
[47:47] they had a thing going on next door
[47:49] because it was too large for this room
[47:51] here
[47:52] but do you know ever since we've been in
[47:54] here except for maybe one or two
[47:56] services
[47:57] every time we come in here it's exactly
[47:59] the way we left it
[48:01] i can only believe that nobody's renting
[48:05] this building
[48:06] because we're here god is keeping this
[48:10] place
[48:10] for us i don't even know if anybody even
[48:13] comes into this room maybe to vacuum
[48:15] outside of us on sunday mornings now
[48:17] right now
[48:19] god will bless the man for allowing us
[48:21] and cutting the price and allowing us to
[48:23] have the
[48:24] facility and all but god is taking care
[48:27] of us
[48:27] yes even though we're a little
[48:30] uncomfortable now and we're in an
[48:32] interim place and we're not where we
[48:34] want to be
[48:35] god is blessing us here god is blessing
[48:38] our services i don't know about you but
[48:40] i feel him every time i come in here
[48:42] i do and god is blessing us even
[48:45] here and keeping all the other out
[48:50] all the week they're not renting this
[48:51] place anymore so
[48:53] again i i want you to realize what the
[48:56] lord is doing
[48:57] let's let's don't lose perspective of
[48:59] that yes
[49:00] god is blessing us god is moving god is
[49:03] moving in our church and our lives our
[49:05] families
[49:05] in this bride internationally god is
[49:08] blessing us i believe
[49:10] friend that we're living on borrowed
[49:11] time i mean i really do i mean brother
[49:14] branham said
[49:15] uh the coming of the lord is overdue
[49:17] that's not 55
[49:19] plus years ago but i just i believe at
[49:22] this moment that
[49:24] the mercies of god has probably never
[49:26] been any more manifested than they are
[49:29] today
[49:30] with this with the bride still being
[49:32] here and the mercies of god still being
[49:34] on this earth
[49:35] to find that last seat or whatever it is
[49:37] that god has before we go home
[49:40] whatever space of time we're in we know
[49:42] the rapture rapture's in process
[49:44] i'm ready to go home our bodies we're
[49:46] changing
[49:47] moment by moment day by day yeah but
[49:50] uh but god is moving god is doing
[49:53] something it's it's
[49:54] it is miraculous that's just a
[49:57] derivative of the word miracle
[49:59] miraculous what god is doing it's it's
[50:02] uh
[50:02] i i i i just feel so overwhelmed
[50:06] sometime
[50:07] at the presence of god and what god's
[50:09] doing
[50:10] amen and don't lose perspective the
[50:13] testimonies last week
[50:14] and then there's other testimonies but i
[50:16] know those two those
[50:17] those were just miracles yes yeah just
[50:20] absolute flat-out
[50:22] god-ordained miracles and uh
[50:25] i thank him for it you heard me get a
[50:28] little emotional
[50:29] uh over both of their testimonies last
[50:31] week but you don't know how i've been
[50:33] before the lord prayed for the two of
[50:34] them too
[50:35] and all of you but uh you know it just
[50:38] it really it really meant a lot to me
[50:41] and it means a lot to me
[50:43] to to see what god is doing in your
[50:45] families to see what god is doing in
[50:47] your lives and
[50:49] it does something to a pastor i can't
[50:51] it's can't explain it
[50:54] but it just it really it really touches
[50:57] my heart
[50:58] so i appreciate that appreciate god
[51:01] appreciate his goodness i love you all
[51:03] amen and all that you do also last week
[51:06] before we get into the scripture i'm
[51:08] gonna go to part two of the free will we
[51:10] started last week but
[51:11] um i failed to give a little more detail
[51:15] i had a
[51:16] prayer request written down for zach to
[51:18] write to read
[51:19] of my good friend brother mike holloway
[51:22] you all know brother mike he came and
[51:23] ministered for us
[51:24] a year or so ago he was down um
[51:27] ministering
[51:28] for someone in cottonwood and i
[51:31] persuaded him to come down this way
[51:32] before he went up that way because they
[51:34] flew into phoenix
[51:36] and he visits us on a thursday night i
[51:38] don't know how many of you were there
[51:40] uh heard it was uh it was when we were
[51:42] still off cortero but anyway he's the
[51:44] precious brother he's the one who
[51:47] did all the graphics for my book free of
[51:49] charge
[51:50] uh and uh he he had that heart issue
[51:54] that we supposed to have the surgery on
[51:56] they postponed the surgery and the
[51:58] doctors talked to him and
[52:00] asked about how he's doing he says i'm
[52:02] i'm fine he doesn't feel like there's
[52:04] anything wrong with him now
[52:05] and the doctors they're just wanting to
[52:07] reschedule it but his primary doctors
[52:09] first doctors like
[52:10] well i think you need to go get
[52:12] re-examined
[52:14] maybe the lord has done something maybe
[52:17] you don't need surgery anymore
[52:20] so brother mike is in the process of
[52:22] determining
[52:23] where the lord would send him for the
[52:25] next examination to see
[52:27] uh and prove the miracle of the lord
[52:30] that touch his heart
[52:33] because it was a dire situation i mean
[52:34] it was uh it was life and death really
[52:38] you start talking about the heart you
[52:40] know uh it's a dire situation so
[52:43] to let you know um i'll i'll try to keep
[52:47] in contact with him
[52:48] i'd love to have him come and minister
[52:51] for us sometime in the near future
[52:53] i had it planned on my heart maybe if
[52:55] the lord willing when we get in our new
[52:56] place to have some dedication services
[52:59] uh we won't be bound to this room or to
[53:01] the other church or to any of their
[53:03] regulations or time frames so we can
[53:05] have church whenever and however and
[53:07] whatever all we want so i just
[53:10] thought to do that maybe and see where
[53:12] the lord leads that but
[53:14] please continue remember brother mike
[53:15] and mike holloway
[53:17] i just trust the lord's touched him and
[53:19] healed him and he doesn't even have
[53:20] need surgery amen so i'm looking forward
[53:24] to having a
[53:25] wonderful testimony for you again in the
[53:27] near future so
[53:29] praise the lord god bless you let's
[53:30] stand if we could
[53:38] you say well brother you've already used
[53:40] up 20 minutes of the
[53:42] hour that we have well micah talked to
[53:44] the lady outside again and we don't have
[53:46] to give the church up the building up
[53:48] quite
[53:49] at noon so so we have an extra hour or
[53:52] whatever so i don't want to abuse
[53:54] the privilege that they give us but um
[53:58] but i'm thankful that we don't feel
[54:01] quite so stressed to
[54:02] look at that clock so i'm thankful that
[54:06] they said to us you know as long as
[54:07] nobody else is using it as long as it's
[54:09] not rented anybody else you're welcome
[54:11] to it so
[54:12] well we'll just take advantage of that
[54:14] amen so
[54:15] genesis 1 we'll begin uh there reading
[54:18] at that part uh
[54:19] person scripture again as we did last
[54:21] week genesis 1 verse 26
[54:26] i was so inspired last week i was so
[54:28] just my skin could hardly hold me
[54:31] actually
[54:32] um i really preached to you more than i
[54:34] really
[54:35] taught this and i really had it on my
[54:37] heart to do more of a teaching of this
[54:39] than
[54:39] than a preaching but however the lord
[54:42] leads yes
[54:43] just do how we feel led to do but for uh
[54:46] genesis chapter one
[54:47] we'll begin reading verse 26 but let's
[54:49] bow our heads for another word of prayer
[54:51] if we could lord
[54:52] jesus we thank you so much lord for what
[54:54] you've done for us
[54:56] god lips cannot even begin to express
[54:58] how much we love you and appreciate you
[55:00] and
[55:01] thank you for all that you do for us god
[55:03] every day
[55:04] lord and the great miracles and things

[55:13] know about
[55:14] you keep us from accidents you keep us
[55:16] from germs or diseases you keep us
[55:18] and protect us so many times lord and we
[55:20] just thank you for it
[55:22] we thank you for always being with us
[55:24] never leaving or forsaking us
[55:26] and for this time in this place this
[55:28] facility that you've provided for us
[55:30] god may you bless father the remaining
[55:32] part of this service
[55:33] may your hand be upon each one lord
[55:35] those that may be streaming today those
[55:37] that are here
[55:38] in person god may you just bless us and
[55:41] keep us by your perfect will
[55:43] we believe god that you've come today
[55:45] lord to minister to our hearts and lives
[55:47] for father if you don't meet with us
[55:49] here god i know you've already here
[55:51] but speak to us lord if you don't speak
[55:53] to us then none of this is really
[55:55] we could just find the denny's next door
[55:57] and go have a nice fellowship
[55:58] father but you god come and speak to us
[56:02] once again from your precious holy word
[56:04] lord inspire us and strengthen us
[56:06] and show us in there where we need to be
[56:08] in you god

[56:12] come through a revelation to our hearts
[56:14] to make us more like you

[56:18] to the revelation for this day
[56:20] yes and lord we thank you god for each
[56:22] one that has come may you bless them
[56:24] exceedingly
[56:25] we rebuke every demonic spirit that we
[56:27] try to hurt or hinder and infiltrate
[56:28] this service in any way
[56:30] but god knowing your presence here and
[56:32] feeling it god that devil doesn't have a
[56:34] chance
[56:35] and i thank you father for blessing us

[56:43] god we just committed to you lord and
[56:45] ask your blessing upon now this
[56:47] reading of your word father as we enter
[56:49] into it solemnly respectfully but
[56:52] believing god that you're going to speak
[56:54] to us in your precious
[56:56] holy name we pray the name of the lord
[56:58] jesus christ
[57:00] amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[57:05] god said let us make man in our image
[57:08] and after our likeness and let us let
[57:10] and let them have dominion over the fish
[57:12] of the sea over the fowl of the air
[57:14] over the cattle over all of the earth
[57:16] and over every creeping thing that
[57:18] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[57:20] man in his own image
[57:21] and the image of god created he him male
[57:23] and female created he them and you can
[57:26] be seated if you'd like
[57:28] we read the last few verses as well last
[57:30] week
[57:31] but i just felt would just stop right
[57:33] there and uh
[57:34] go enter into the next service i will
[57:36] tell you so make sure i don't forget
[57:38] about it but
[57:39] i appreciate your prayers uh
[57:42] we had the ministers meeting in phoenix
[57:44] last week or last week yesterday
[57:47] and it went uh it actually went really
[57:49] well i was very pleased
[57:51] i was i got a lot out of the brothers
[57:54] that spoke there
[57:56] not everybody spoke but uh there was
[57:58] about 50 brothers there
[58:00] uh probably 10 or 15 of them weren't
[58:03] really ministers maybe deacons or
[58:05] something like that at the church for a
[58:06] while or uh
[58:08] that kind of thing and uh many were
[58:11] there from phoenix
[58:12] there weren't that many pastors from
[58:14] tucson uh there was
[58:16] three or four of us and tried to
[58:17] remember but uh
[58:19] anyway that's irrespective of what what
[58:22] the meeting was about it was a real
[58:24] blessing i enjoyed it
[58:25] me and brother roger went down together
[58:27] we left a little early brother roger has
[58:28] meetings on sunday saturday nights as
[58:30] you know
[58:31] uh that he does his uh streaming so we
[58:33] left a little bit early so we could get
[58:35] back to benson
[58:36] uh to have his service there but it was
[58:38] really well i appreciate your prayers it
[58:40] went really good
[58:42] i felt a lot of unity i felt a lot of
[58:44] love uh
[58:46] fellowship so appreciate your prayers
[58:49] about that
[58:50] and and they're supposed to have it
[58:52] every other month
[58:54] uh we'll see how that goes the lord
[58:55] willing i plan to go to the next one
[58:57] uh i'm not here uh to
[59:01] convince anybody that my doctrine is
[59:04] right i'm not going to those to can
[59:06] try to talk them brothers into believing
[59:07] the way i believe or see
[59:09] the way i see it right um but
[59:12] then that's all a part of free will amen
[59:14] if i can
[59:16] i'll just take a minute you know uh
[59:18] everybody looks at
[59:20] those things a different way if you
[59:22] don't understand that to that point
[59:24] then just read the four gospels right i
[59:27] challenge you
[59:28] when you're when you have a chance just
[59:30] read through matthew mark luke and john
[59:32] consecutively three times through
[59:34] and see what each one of them say and
[59:36] see how they say it and how they
[59:38] describe
[59:40] the exact same situation from each one
[59:43] of them
[59:44] not only do each one of them have a
[59:46] unique perspective on it
[59:48] but they come from a unique background
[59:51] about it
[59:52] uh each one had their own lives and and
[59:55] the type of profession they were and the
[59:57] type of life they lived and where they
[59:59] came from and the kind of parents they
[1:00:01] had
[1:00:02] and that type of thing you know um i i
[1:00:05] could
[1:00:05] uh i could bring this pulpit in the
[1:00:08] middle of the room
[1:00:09] because on wheels i'd do it but and i
[1:00:11] just
[1:00:12] and you can surround it and say okay
[1:00:14] which one what
[1:00:15] what do you see every one of you would
[1:00:17] say you saw this
[1:00:18] you saw that probably no two people in
[1:00:20] this room would have the same answer
[1:00:23] right because you're looking at it a
[1:00:24] different perspective
[1:00:26] that's a part of free will god give you
[1:00:28] that as a part of your free will so that
[1:00:31] you can have that determination based on
[1:00:33] who god has made you
[1:00:35] who are you to be able to fulfill what
[1:00:38] god has called
[1:00:39] that he wants done today now for you
[1:00:42] to see it in a certain way you need to
[1:00:45] see it that way to do what god wants you
[1:00:47] to do
[1:00:48] and this person needs to see it from
[1:00:50] their perspective to be able to do it
[1:00:52] the way
[1:00:53] god wants them to do it you see all that
[1:00:55] evolves
[1:00:56] all that is exactly a part of god's uh
[1:00:59] uh
[1:00:59] god's free will in our lives because he
[1:01:02] gives us
[1:01:03] see you can't even fulfill the purpose
[1:01:06] that god's put in your life and if you
[1:01:09] didn't have free will
[1:01:11] you couldn't do what god put you here to
[1:01:13] do if you weren't on a free moral agency
[1:01:15] basis
[1:01:16] you couldn't do it because god gives you
[1:01:19] the ability to determine
[1:01:20] based on what god has revealed to you
[1:01:23] the point that god wants you to make in
[1:01:25] the play
[1:01:26] the part that god wants you to play all
[1:01:28] of that
[1:01:29] every bit of that goes into your free
[1:01:31] will now that doesn't mean the person on
[1:01:33] this side of the platform is right and
[1:01:35] the person on the left side is wrong
[1:01:37] that's where we get into problems we get
[1:01:40] into problems because someone says
[1:01:42] oh no it is absolutely this way and
[1:01:45] there's no way it could be this way
[1:01:47] now there is a a
[1:01:51] derivative from the word that is not
[1:01:53] scriptural and i'm not talking about
[1:01:55] that
[1:01:56] i'm talking about that that is pure word
[1:01:59] but that is looked at it
[1:02:01] in a different perspective and look at
[1:02:03] this
[1:02:04] god is infinite god is eternal
[1:02:07] and there's no way any one of us any
[1:02:10] group of us
[1:02:11] are ever going to be able to fully
[1:02:13] comprehend
[1:02:15] the mind of god brother branham clinton
[1:02:18] and all of the gift and the and the
[1:02:20] revelation
[1:02:21] that god afforded to brother branham not
[1:02:24] nobody can
[1:02:25] in our human pee little brains there's
[1:02:28] no way we can
[1:02:29] but what we can do is accept the way
[1:02:32] this person over here sees it
[1:02:34] and except the way this person sees it
[1:02:36] not off the word
[1:02:38] and it's got to be with the word okay
[1:02:40] but you're just looking at it from this
[1:02:42] way
[1:02:43] and this person's looking at it from
[1:02:45] this way now if this person over here
[1:02:47] doesn't
[1:02:48] say oh no you're wrong brother it's not
[1:02:51] like that
[1:02:51] it's like this and you're wrong for
[1:02:54] believing that
[1:02:55] that's where the problem comes right
[1:02:57] that's where you have contention
[1:03:00] if this person over here would say oh
[1:03:02] well brother i
[1:03:03] you know i never saw it that way well
[1:03:05] you know that
[1:03:06] that that that goes in and this person
[1:03:08] chimes in and they say
[1:03:09] oh yeah i see it like this and you and
[1:03:12] and the two of them are like wow yeah
[1:03:14] i never thought of it that way right i
[1:03:17] never
[1:03:17] looked at it with that perspective
[1:03:20] every one of them comes in together and
[1:03:23] then you can get
[1:03:24] really a truer picture of what it really
[1:03:26] is right
[1:03:27] if you only look at it at one angle you
[1:03:29] only have one angle of the picture
[1:03:32] but if you get that man's angle of the
[1:03:34] picture and this person's angle of the
[1:03:36] picture and this person's angle of the
[1:03:38] picture
[1:03:38] you could say okay well praise the lord
[1:03:40] i know exactly what this pulpit looks
[1:03:42] like now amen
[1:03:43] i know exactly from all angles from
[1:03:46] every perspective from every point of
[1:03:47] view
[1:03:48] i could without seeing it i could draw a
[1:03:51] perfect picture of this pulpit
[1:03:52] based on everyone's uh description of it
[1:03:56] it's that simple the problem comes in
[1:03:59] the disagreement and say oh no
[1:04:01] it it it's not like that i i i'm looking
[1:04:04] at it this is what i see
[1:04:05] so you're wrong no he's not wrong
[1:04:09] he's just seeing it from over there
[1:04:11] right if he could
[1:04:12] just accept and say well you know i
[1:04:14] never sought from that angle
[1:04:16] amen it would be so much better it would
[1:04:19] be so much easier
[1:04:21] it would be it would give the devil so
[1:04:23] much less room to
[1:04:24] to operate in our midst right but see to
[1:04:28] understand
[1:04:29] you god put you in that position to see
[1:04:31] it from that perspective
[1:04:33] your whole life has been that way we
[1:04:35] went into adoption i
[1:04:36] had three or four services on that about
[1:04:39] adoption and
[1:04:40] and the five-fold ministry and see why
[1:04:42] is there a five-fold ministry
[1:04:44] if there's no free will if we don't have
[1:04:46] a choice why is there even a
[1:04:48] full ministry right there wouldn't be
[1:04:50] any reason to be a five-fold ministry
[1:04:52] because you wouldn't have to have
[1:04:54] different gifts
[1:04:56] you wouldn't have to have differing
[1:04:57] ministering gifts because
[1:04:59] if there's no free free will then one
[1:05:02] one person or one gift or one that you
[1:05:05] just
[1:05:05] lay it out the way it is and that's just
[1:05:07] the way it is
[1:05:08] but there's but but each one of them has
[1:05:11] its own gift
[1:05:12] right each one of them would see it
[1:05:15] based on that gift
[1:05:16] from a different angle a different
[1:05:18] perspective and that goes back into your
[1:05:21] birth
[1:05:22] it goes back to the predestination
[1:05:25] and when it goes back that far you can
[1:05:28] realize who's in control of this
[1:05:30] it's not me it's not you it's not some
[1:05:33] other brother church or
[1:05:34] brother adam god is in charge of it amen
[1:05:37] he predestinated it yeah and if he
[1:05:40] predestinated from before the foundation
[1:05:42] of the world
[1:05:43] then your birth is no accident right
[1:05:46] who your parents were was no accident
[1:05:49] right
[1:05:50] where you were born where you grew up
[1:05:52] what atmosphere you lived in
[1:05:54] is no accident it's all
[1:05:58] predestined by god based on his what
[1:06:02] for knowledge but it's done that way
[1:06:06] you had the parents you lived in the
[1:06:08] place you went to the church you were
[1:06:09] born again
[1:06:10] you were baptized all that happened to
[1:06:13] to
[1:06:13] bring about the person you are for the
[1:06:15] fulfillment of the purpose in your life
[1:06:18] all that's free will every bit of that
[1:06:21] is because you're a free moral agent
[1:06:24] look at the scripture here and
[1:06:27] god said let us make man in our image
[1:06:29] after our likeness
[1:06:31] and let them have dominion okay
[1:06:35] now if i have something
[1:06:39] i can give it to you and if i give it to
[1:06:43] you
[1:06:44] then you'll have it yep understand
[1:06:48] god said let them have so what's he
[1:06:51] doing
[1:06:52] he's taking something that is his
[1:06:54] possession
[1:06:55] and he's giving it to them right so
[1:06:59] they can have it that very
[1:07:02] word that very five-letter word
[1:07:07] is free will in itself
[1:07:11] because why would god give you something
[1:07:13] to have
[1:07:15] if he was just going to control you with
[1:07:17] what he's given you i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:07:19] i'm gonna give you my phone but you
[1:07:22] can't use it
[1:07:24] don't you touch it don't you text on it
[1:07:26] don't you call anybody
[1:07:27] but you can have it oh you're not you
[1:07:29] can't have it unless you're gonna let
[1:07:31] them use it
[1:07:32] all right i'll give you this pen but
[1:07:34] don't you get right with it
[1:07:37] what's the point in giving it to them
[1:07:38] then right what's the point letting them
[1:07:41] have it god had it
[1:07:44] and he gave it so they could have
[1:07:47] it and when they had it god
[1:07:50] knew that based on that determination of
[1:07:53] free moral agency
[1:07:55] that they would do with it what he
[1:07:57] wanted them to do with it
[1:07:59] right now he knew whether they would or
[1:08:01] wouldn't
[1:08:02] of course amen all that was
[1:08:04] predetermined
[1:08:05] again by foreknowledge in god's mind but
[1:08:08] he gave it to them
[1:08:10] because so they with their free will
[1:08:14] would use it and do what god wanted them
[1:08:17] to do with it but it was theirs to have
[1:08:21] you understand if you give something to
[1:08:23] somebody and
[1:08:24] and tell them not to do something with
[1:08:26] it you really didn't give it to them
[1:08:28] if god had given something and then
[1:08:32] made you do it a certain way well you
[1:08:34] really don't have it
[1:08:36] that's just god forcing you to do
[1:08:38] something it's just god
[1:08:39] making you do something you don't really
[1:08:41] have it but when you
[1:08:42] have it you are by your determination a
[1:08:46] free moral
[1:08:46] you can do what you want to with it
[1:08:49] right and that's what god said
[1:08:51] you have dominion
[1:08:55] so now what you need to do adam is use
[1:08:58] that
[1:08:59] for what the purpose that i called you
[1:09:01] to use it for
[1:09:03] everybody's then on that same basis
[1:09:06] every man from that point every person
[1:09:08] from that point
[1:09:09] has been on that basis nobody's been
[1:09:12] separate from that
[1:09:13] it has been given and had
[1:09:17] and now you have god didn't give it to
[1:09:20] adam and then the next that came along
[1:09:22] said no no no you can't have it no
[1:09:24] everyone if god gave it to him see
[1:09:26] remember brother aaron said if he did it
[1:09:28] for one person one way and did it a
[1:09:29] different way the next person he's not
[1:09:31] god
[1:09:32] right he had to do it to the next one
[1:09:34] the exact same way he did it to the
[1:09:35] first one
[1:09:36] yes and when he did it to adam that way
[1:09:38] he had to do it to the next one that way
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:40] and on down the line to you and every
[1:09:43] person that was born on this planet
[1:09:45] earth
[1:09:46] the same affirmation that adam had
[1:09:50] in the beginning had to be or god's not
[1:09:52] god
[1:09:53] but it was all work to be in his perfect
[1:09:56] plan
[1:09:57] this is what i'm giving you to have well
[1:10:00] if they
[1:10:00] if he wasn't if he didn't have free will
[1:10:03] why would god give it to him
[1:10:05] what's the point i
[1:10:08] make you do something god's not making
[1:10:11] you
[1:10:12] it's it's based on your free will see
[1:10:15] free will and predestination are not
[1:10:18] competing factors i'm kind of laying a
[1:10:20] little bit
[1:10:21] i'm kind of laying a little bit of the
[1:10:24] foundation from last week and still
[1:10:26] uh just speaking what the lord puts on
[1:10:29] my heart they're not competing factors
[1:10:31] right free will and predestination do
[1:10:34] not compete with each other
[1:10:36] they are companions with each other
[1:10:38] right because the predestination of god
[1:10:41] is based on his foreknowledge thus the
[1:10:44] two
[1:10:45] cannot compete the two complement each
[1:10:48] other
[1:10:48] yeah because when it gets to the place
[1:10:52] that in your life
[1:10:53] do you realize that that we kind of
[1:10:56] ended with this last week but do you
[1:10:58] realize that
[1:10:59] you can be in god's perfect will while
[1:11:01] you're living in his in
[1:11:02] living in his permissive will you can be
[1:11:06] in god's perfect will while living in
[1:11:09] his
[1:11:09] uh permissive will right yeah because we
[1:11:12] know that everything on this earth and
[1:11:14] everything that has happened by creation
[1:11:16] from the very beginning
[1:11:18] from the fall of uh of sin in the garden
[1:11:20] of eden until today has been in god's
[1:11:22] permissive will
[1:11:23] amen it was never meant to be god's
[1:11:26] perfect will
[1:11:27] for for all this to happen the way it's
[1:11:29] happened the diseases and the germs and
[1:11:32] the hospitals and the police and all
[1:11:33] everything the hospital that ambulances
[1:11:36] that was never supposed to be dying
[1:11:38] there was never supposed to be a death
[1:11:40] it was never supposed to be a child with
[1:11:41] cancer there was never supposed to be
[1:11:44] none of that was supposed to exist it's
[1:11:46] in this is satan's eden
[1:11:48] living in god's permissive will all
[1:11:50] those creations in god's purpose
[1:11:52] permit permissive will
[1:11:56] but you in the middle of that can find
[1:11:59] yourself
[1:12:01] in in god's perfect will for your life
[1:12:05] so you can live in god's perfect will
[1:12:08] while everything else in this world is a
[1:12:10] permissive act
[1:12:11] you understand see where mortal humans
[1:12:15] born in sin shaped iniquity come the
[1:12:16] world's speaking lies
[1:12:18] every one of us but by the free will
[1:12:20] that we have
[1:12:22] we can be we can become born again
[1:12:25] a part of god's plan we can enter into
[1:12:28] from the permissive will of god into
[1:12:30] god's perfect will
[1:12:32] but that's our choice that's our
[1:12:34] decision
[1:12:36] that's our free will to put us in that
[1:12:38] position
[1:12:40] we have to make that decision we have to
[1:12:42] make that determination we have to have
[1:12:44] that self-will
[1:12:46] to be in the place to where we are in
[1:12:48] god's perfect will
[1:12:50] yet while still in this permissive place
[1:12:54] that's and that's based on our the
[1:12:57] determination that we have towards god
[1:13:00] right living in his perfect will
[1:13:03] while everything else around us is going
[1:13:04] on in his permissive will
[1:13:06] right amen now if we as individuals
[1:13:09] devolve
[1:13:10] into god's permissive will for a certain
[1:13:12] time or a certain element or whatever
[1:13:15] that's based on your decision as well
[1:13:17] that's right
[1:13:18] your personal life may devolve from his
[1:13:21] perfect will
[1:13:22] into his permissive will by a choice
[1:13:25] that you made
[1:13:27] by a decision by your free will you
[1:13:29] devolve from that perfect will of god by
[1:13:32] a decision or
[1:13:33] a choice down into his permissive will
[1:13:37] and now you're living in his permissive
[1:13:39] will desiring to get back
[1:13:42] into that perfect will which if you're a
[1:13:44] child of god will
[1:13:45] come to pass because god already foresaw
[1:13:48] it
[1:13:49] god foresaw it that way if it wasn't to
[1:13:52] be foreseen
[1:13:53] or weren't going to happen that way then
[1:13:55] god would have never allowed you to be
[1:13:57] in that position to begin with
[1:13:59] it just never would have happened you
[1:14:01] never would have accepted him to begin
[1:14:03] with
[1:14:04] amen now people say they accept it when
[1:14:07] they really don't
[1:14:08] that was that but that in itself is free
[1:14:11] will
[1:14:12] that in itself is a decision that in
[1:14:14] itself is the purpose
[1:14:16] uh that that each one of us can
[1:14:18] determine in ourselves
[1:14:20] which where are we going to go what are
[1:14:21] we going to do there's people that think
[1:14:23] that god forces you to do stuff
[1:14:25] god makes you do stuff god doesn't make
[1:14:27] you do anything right
[1:14:29] it's our choice amen now
[1:14:33] that's the good shepherd a good shepherd
[1:14:37] leads a bad shepherd drives
[1:14:41] right a good shepherd leads his children
[1:14:44] and that's the good shepherd
[1:14:45] jesus christ is the good shepherd by
[1:14:48] leaving
[1:14:48] his children he doesn't drive you he
[1:14:51] takes your
[1:14:52] free will and he leads you amen he leads
[1:14:56] you in the place that
[1:14:57] that he wants you to go but because you
[1:15:00] made the decision and choice of your
[1:15:02] free will that you
[1:15:03] wanted to do that for whatever purpose
[1:15:06] hopefully it was because you love the
[1:15:08] lord jesus
[1:15:09] with all your heart that you wanted to
[1:15:11] serve him and live for him
[1:15:12] then you're being led by him but being
[1:15:15] led by god is still your free will
[1:15:18] sure people said well god made me no
[1:15:21] no god's not making i know david said he
[1:15:24] maketh me to lie
[1:15:26] uh uh in green pastures but that word
[1:15:31] in the bible is the same as we say god
[1:15:33] forcing you to do something right
[1:15:36] now making me to do something he he may
[1:15:38] in
[1:15:39] in oh i forget the scripture but
[1:15:42] it it says god made us zio made uzziah
[1:15:45] to prosper
[1:15:46] but that doesn't mean that god forced
[1:15:48] him that way
[1:15:50] it just mean that the that the
[1:15:52] circumstances by his decision process
[1:15:56] caused him to be a prosperous person
[1:16:00] god didn't force him to be but by the
[1:16:03] by the will of his of his own self and
[1:16:05] the desire to follow the truth
[1:16:07] he was he was led into prospering
[1:16:11] it was it was the it was the absolute
[1:16:14] result
[1:16:15] of what was happening
[1:16:18] you get into science and you say well if
[1:16:21] this
[1:16:22] if this happened does this happen and
[1:16:24] you can come out with this
[1:16:25] uh if there's a reaction there's an
[1:16:27] equal and opposite reaction or something
[1:16:29] like that
[1:16:30] uh there's there's the two forces that
[1:16:33] come together
[1:16:34] well if you put these two forces
[1:16:36] together let's just say uh
[1:16:38] hydrogen and oxygen if you put hydrogen
[1:16:41] and oxygen together what happens
[1:16:44] you get water h2o it's just a resulting
[1:16:47] effect
[1:16:48] of the fact of those two things coming
[1:16:51] together
[1:16:52] well god's not making that that's just a
[1:16:55] part of the process
[1:16:57] god didn't make us god doesn't make us
[1:17:00] it's just the resulting effect that that
[1:17:03] comes from our decision
[1:17:05] right god coming over here
[1:17:08] that that great faction that comes and
[1:17:11] sweeps in
[1:17:12] our decision meets that and then you got
[1:17:15] a result
[1:17:17] blessed prospering laying in green
[1:17:20] pastures by the still waters
[1:17:22] that's the resulting effect amen see now
[1:17:26] if that great faction god comes
[1:17:28] and sweeps in there and an opposing
[1:17:30] faction comes
[1:17:31] and and and opposes it then there's a
[1:17:34] different reaction
[1:17:35] that takes place and not a good one
[1:17:38] there's
[1:17:39] there's no prospering in that one
[1:17:40] there's no laying by still waters in
[1:17:42] that one
[1:17:43] amen but when that but when that
[1:17:46] equaling faction comes and meets it
[1:17:49] but see that equaling faction is your
[1:17:51] decision
[1:17:53] that equaling faction is your choice
[1:17:56] that equaling faction is your
[1:17:58] will your desire see a lot of people say
[1:18:01] they desire for this result but they
[1:18:04] don't do what it takes to get to that
[1:18:06] result
[1:18:06] right well that's their free will that's
[1:18:09] their choice
[1:18:10] they choose not to do this and they get
[1:18:13] mad when
[1:18:14] it doesn't happen the way they think it
[1:18:16] should
[1:18:18] but you didn't do what it took to get it
[1:18:21] to that place
[1:18:22] yeah that's right if you put hydrogen
[1:18:25] with something
[1:18:26] else other than oxygen you're not going
[1:18:28] to get water
[1:18:29] you say well i want water well then you
[1:18:31] got to do it the right way
[1:18:33] your choice has to be i'm going to do it
[1:18:35] this way
[1:18:37] so you can't make that choice or that
[1:18:38] decision that free will
[1:18:40] and expect it to be one way when that's
[1:18:43] not the way
[1:18:44] of the prescription that god laid out
[1:18:46] for it right
[1:18:48] won't work so you see if you want that
[1:18:52] resulting
[1:18:53] effect you've got to be willing to make
[1:18:55] that right
[1:18:56] choice that right decision to follow
[1:18:58] that right path that
[1:19:00] that free will purpose that god put
[1:19:02] there you got to be willing to go that
[1:19:04] direction you got to be willing to go
[1:19:06] that far you got to be willing to do
[1:19:09] what it takes
[1:19:10] and sometimes the price is hard
[1:19:13] sometimes what you're wanting in life
[1:19:15] what you're expecting to see
[1:19:17] is not just gotten from a two-minute
[1:19:20] prayer in a five-minute five-minute fast
[1:19:22] right right it doesn't come with the
[1:19:24] result of that there's got to there's
[1:19:26] sometimes it takes more than that yes
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:30] you understand but it's got to be that
[1:19:34] of your will to meet that so
[1:19:38] the result is the prospering yes
[1:19:41] so the result is the resulting that you
[1:19:43] want to get from it
[1:19:45] that's us friend that's not god am i
[1:19:48] that's not god
[1:19:52] so we to understand the power
[1:19:55] that god has given into our hands and
[1:19:58] the
[1:19:58] and the power of the result of our
[1:20:01] decisions
[1:20:02] is monumental is is far beyond i think
[1:20:06] what a lot of us actually believe
[1:20:07] understand and the more i delve into it
[1:20:10] it goes way far
[1:20:11] farther than i ever even imagined right
[1:20:14] the things that i was
[1:20:16] seeing and looking at their i i thought
[1:20:18] wow that that
[1:20:20] actually that actually goes
[1:20:23] right into what we're talking about that
[1:20:26] that fits right in
[1:20:27] this wouldn't happen if it weren't for
[1:20:29] free will
[1:20:32] if god didn't give you what you needed
[1:20:35] knowing what you would decide
[1:20:38] and your decision was there your choice
[1:20:41] was there to
[1:20:42] put you in that situation then
[1:20:46] the result won't be what god was
[1:20:49] intending for
[1:20:50] you for your life see i wanted
[1:20:53] uh uh god has you here for this purpose
[1:20:56] we talked about a little bit last week
[1:20:57] god's got you here for this purpose amen
[1:21:00] that adoption bringing us to that
[1:21:02] purpose
[1:21:02] that purpose really is just the
[1:21:04] predestination that prejudice that
[1:21:07] predetermined purpose
[1:21:09] that god had for you but if you're if
[1:21:12] your choice doesn't meet that
[1:21:14] it's not going to work right it's not
[1:21:16] going to uh
[1:21:17] result in in the part or the reason that
[1:21:21] god puts you here
[1:21:22] and god wants you here so understanding
[1:21:25] if if there was no free will you could
[1:21:28] not do
[1:21:30] what god's put you here and called for
[1:21:32] you to do you couldn't do it
[1:21:35] unless god just forced you to do it or
[1:21:37] god just made you
[1:21:40] like god's the great puppeteer up there
[1:21:42] you know moving us over to do something
[1:21:45] that's that's beyond
[1:21:48] what the bible teaches us that's not god
[1:21:52] god's not a puppeteer up there moving
[1:21:54] you all around and
[1:21:57] it's based on our decisions yes see
[1:22:00] and and and
[1:22:04] looking at calvinism and harmony
[1:22:06] armenianism again
[1:22:07] you know calvinism was
[1:22:11] based on the the the theory the thought
[1:22:14] that
[1:22:15] that man was saved by god's choice alone
[1:22:20] it was which which basically eliminates
[1:22:23] free will
[1:22:25] which obviously goes off to a tangent on
[1:22:28] one side
[1:22:29] now part of that is true yes god did
[1:22:31] choose us absolutely
[1:22:34] but you can't say that it's god's choice
[1:22:36] only
[1:22:37] there's got to be free will that's
[1:22:39] determined in there
[1:22:40] right because we're free mortal agents
[1:22:44] but armenianism said well it's it's it's
[1:22:47] god's
[1:22:47] it's man's free will to choose he can
[1:22:50] determine
[1:22:51] and choose what what he wants to do but
[1:22:54] if that's the only way that
[1:22:56] that you see it then that eliminates
[1:22:58] predestination
[1:23:00] that gets rid of predestination there's
[1:23:02] no pre-determining anything at that
[1:23:05] point
[1:23:06] because you take away a god out of the
[1:23:09] mix and say well let's buy my works
[1:23:13] it's it's by my way see uh
[1:23:18] you go one side from
[1:23:21] you start well you start making free
[1:23:23] will and predestination
[1:23:25] competing factors at that point you
[1:23:28] start making them
[1:23:28] opposing factors when you do that and
[1:23:31] they're not to be composing
[1:23:33] opposite uh competing factors
[1:23:36] they're c they complement each other in
[1:23:38] god's kingdom
[1:23:39] not not against each other so you got to
[1:23:42] take what calvinism said
[1:23:44] yes there is predestination yes there is
[1:23:47] god's choice
[1:23:48] but he put man on free moral agency so
[1:23:50] the man would choose yes
[1:23:52] the man's going to choose but god but
[1:23:55] man's choice isn't negating god's
[1:23:57] predestination
[1:24:00] you have election
[1:24:04] fighting against god's free will
[1:24:07] you have the grace of god fighting
[1:24:09] against
[1:24:11] works of man you have
[1:24:14] holiness fighting against legalism
[1:24:19] and and and then which way do you go
[1:24:22] and there's people that that actually
[1:24:26] i know people that are in the message
[1:24:28] that you know the way they think that it
[1:24:31] should be gone is
[1:24:32] is legalism you know you you gotta
[1:24:35] you gotta force and pound the people
[1:24:37] into living right
[1:24:39] don't you dare do this don't you dare do
[1:24:41] this have this go there
[1:24:43] live this wear this have somebody at the
[1:24:46] door with a tape measure
[1:24:47] is your heel right is your skirt right
[1:24:49] is your hair right
[1:24:51] right that's legalism the only way
[1:24:54] you're going to get into heaven is if
[1:24:56] your skirt's down to your ankles
[1:24:59] hogwash i say that knowing that we know
[1:25:04] the right way to dress right but it's
[1:25:07] hogwash to think that just because you
[1:25:09] got a dress down to your knees or down
[1:25:11] to your ankles that you're
[1:25:12] that's that's your ticket into the
[1:25:14] kingdom of heaven
[1:25:16] that's not your ticket to think that
[1:25:19] while
[1:25:20] i i got my hair you know down to my
[1:25:22] knees
[1:25:23] oh that's not gonna get you in oh i gave
[1:25:27] up gambling
[1:25:28] what about the bar you go to every other
[1:25:29] week i mean
[1:25:32] it's just one thing or the other it's
[1:25:34] legalism is not going to get you there
[1:25:36] right amen and holiness can't
[1:25:40] fight against legalism right
[1:25:43] holiness is just a standard of life that
[1:25:46] we
[1:25:46] choose to live that we desire to
[1:25:50] live under because god's word
[1:25:55] amen amen and we desire to do it because
[1:25:58] we love god
[1:26:00] and we love god so much we would not
[1:26:03] want to disappoint him
[1:26:05] in anything that said if that's in his
[1:26:07] word right
[1:26:08] then you have no competing factions now
[1:26:13] you just got complementary holiness
[1:26:17] brings a life of what others would say
[1:26:19] is legalism
[1:26:21] no no no no it's not legalism it's it's
[1:26:24] a
[1:26:25] it's a standard of holy living that i
[1:26:28] desire to live because
[1:26:30] god's word says so and that's my choice
[1:26:34] legalism is i'm going to make you do
[1:26:37] something
[1:26:38] i'm going to force you to do it this way
[1:26:40] i'm going to send you to hell if you
[1:26:42] don't
[1:26:44] that's legalism and trust me friend i've
[1:26:47] heard plenty of that preaching
[1:26:48] yes in this message i've heard plenty of
[1:26:51] that preaching
[1:26:52] i just pray that you get enough holy
[1:26:54] ghost in you
[1:26:55] that you know how to do it how to
[1:26:57] operate it now
[1:26:58] and and everything that's with it
[1:27:01] because see it's not me
[1:27:02] it's you it it's god's relationship and
[1:27:06] your relationship with him
[1:27:10] it's you're the
[1:27:13] if when the lord takes me the rapture
[1:27:15] there's nobody going to be grabbing my
[1:27:17] coattail
[1:27:18] right and i'm not going to be grabbing
[1:27:19] anybody's coattail
[1:27:21] you go on your own am i so it's up to
[1:27:24] you
[1:27:25] it's up to your determination that's why
[1:27:28] my prayer
[1:27:30] is that you have enough holy ghost to
[1:27:32] know
[1:27:33] what to do how to do it where to go not
[1:27:35] go
[1:27:36] to live a holy life amen
[1:27:40] not legalism not making you do something
[1:27:43] see
[1:27:44] and and the competing factions that
[1:27:46] calvin and armenia had there
[1:27:49] just brought more contention and
[1:27:51] confusion
[1:27:53] when you can just simply open the bible
[1:27:56] which i want to go to
[1:27:57] ephesians to start with here
[1:28:01] and see what god is is speaking
[1:28:06] god's purpose behind this
[1:28:12] the balance to it you know we preached
[1:28:16] and
[1:28:17] had that message uh where scripture
[1:28:19] means scripture anybody remember that
[1:28:21] scripture meets scripture yeah and the
[1:28:23] foundation that really i took was a
[1:28:25] calvinism in armenianism
[1:28:28] and and marriage and divorce and brother
[1:28:30] senate brother baron said they got this
[1:28:31] faction that goes and they take this and
[1:28:33] they go so far off that way
[1:28:35] and this one comes and counters that and
[1:28:37] they go so far off this way
[1:28:39] and both of them are right but both of
[1:28:41] them don't have the
[1:28:43] they both have truth but they don't have
[1:28:44] the absolute truth
[1:28:46] where's the absolute truth it's down the
[1:28:48] middle right
[1:28:50] it's down the middle that's why god sent
[1:28:51] a prophet to take those loose ends from
[1:28:54] this one from this one this one and time
[1:28:55] all together and bring them to a bride
[1:28:57] yeah
[1:28:58] and help them understand yes god has
[1:29:00] choice
[1:29:01] yes it's predestination but he also puts
[1:29:04] your own free moral agency to decide and
[1:29:06] determine
[1:29:07] your decision
[1:29:11] the the glue that holds that together is
[1:29:14] again
[1:29:14] god's foreknowledge that's the glue that
[1:29:17] holds it together
[1:29:18] see election won't fight against free
[1:29:21] will
[1:29:22] when you have a revelation of of
[1:29:24] foreknowledge
[1:29:26] they won't fight with each other if you
[1:29:28] have a revelation of foreknowledge
[1:29:30] they don't compete with one another when
[1:29:32] you understand god's foreknowledge
[1:29:34] god knew it all from the beginning amen
[1:29:37] so it could all be predetermined
[1:29:39] remember last week
[1:29:40] we talked about we'll read the scripture
[1:29:42] here in just a minute uh that i want to
[1:29:43] go to in romans but ephesians now
[1:29:46] ephesians 1 1. paul an apostle
[1:29:49] of jesus christ by the will of god
[1:29:53] by the will of god so what does that
[1:29:54] tell us that means that god
[1:29:57] had a will for paul back before the
[1:30:00] foundation of the world and
[1:30:01] everybody had a purpose for him he said
[1:30:04] well paul was saul
[1:30:06] he even had to change his name he was
[1:30:07] such a scoundrel
[1:30:10] he had to change his name had to had to
[1:30:12] put him on his face
[1:30:14] there by the by the pillar of the cloud
[1:30:17] that that
[1:30:18] shone down on him and put and knocked
[1:30:20] him off his horse
[1:30:21] put him on his face had to change his
[1:30:22] name he was such a bad fellow
[1:30:24] yeah but look at what god did for him
[1:30:29] because see god remember god told
[1:30:31] ananias he is a chosen vessel
[1:30:34] what made him that chosen vessel he was
[1:30:36] an apostle by
[1:30:38] jesus christ by the will of god
[1:30:41] by god's will amen
[1:30:44] now god's will doesn't negate our will
[1:30:50] you understand god's will our will his
[1:30:53] will
[1:30:54] they do they're not competing factions
[1:30:58] one does not nullify the other amen the
[1:31:02] what happens to a believer is our will
[1:31:05] melts into his will amen so that all
[1:31:08] becomes the same will
[1:31:11] yes amen amen that's why
[1:31:15] that's why paul was an apostle amen it
[1:31:18] wasn't his will to do that
[1:31:20] he was happy sitting at the feet of
[1:31:22] gamalion putting other churches out of
[1:31:24] business he was happy getting rid of
[1:31:26] christians
[1:31:26] he was happy putting stephen to death
[1:31:29] right
[1:31:31] he was content but god had a different
[1:31:34] plan
[1:31:35] yes he did amen god had a different plan
[1:31:38] he said
[1:31:38] well god struck him down i mean how
[1:31:41] could he refuse that while he struck the
[1:31:43] men that were with
[1:31:44] paul down too but they didn't see it
[1:31:45] right they didn't accept it
[1:31:48] they didn't believe it they had a choice
[1:31:51] just like he had
[1:31:53] right amen but god's predestination knew
[1:31:56] paul wood that's what made him the
[1:31:58] chosen vessel
[1:32:00] by the will of god to the saints which
[1:32:02] are at ephesus and to the faithful in
[1:32:04] christ jesus that's us
[1:32:07] grace be to you and peace from god our
[1:32:08] father from the lord jesus christ
[1:32:10] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:32:12] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[1:32:14] with all
[1:32:15] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:32:17] in christ
[1:32:18] according as chose us before him before
[1:32:21] the foundation of the world
[1:32:23] now notice that he bless us with
[1:32:26] spiritual blessings
[1:32:28] based on his choosing of us
[1:32:33] you see that he blessed us
[1:32:37] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:32:40] places in christ
[1:32:42] according to as he hath chosen us
[1:32:47] in him the blessings
[1:32:50] come because of the choosing
[1:32:54] of god's choice god's
[1:32:57] choosing us is what brought the
[1:32:59] blessings
[1:33:01] according as he hath so you see that
[1:33:04] according as he has
[1:33:06] is telling us that we're blessed with
[1:33:08] all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:33:10] places
[1:33:11] because of the choosing according to the
[1:33:14] choosing
[1:33:15] that he has chosen us in him before the
[1:33:19] foundation of the world
[1:33:20] now how would he know that because he's
[1:33:22] god
[1:33:23] amen that we should be holy and without
[1:33:26] blame before him in love
[1:33:28] having predestinated us unto the
[1:33:31] adoption of children
[1:33:33] by jesus christ to himself according to
[1:33:36] the good pleasure of
[1:33:37] his will again his will
[1:33:41] does not compete against our will we
[1:33:44] just by his foreknowledge was chosen and
[1:33:47] predestined
[1:33:48] for that purpose because god knew that
[1:33:51] we would do it
[1:33:52] yes god knew that we would accept it
[1:33:55] right
[1:33:55] and that's his or his will becomes our
[1:33:58] will
[1:33:59] we want to do it because we decide
[1:34:02] because we
[1:34:02] want to do it and that's exactly god can
[1:34:06] look friend
[1:34:07] god can have angels and cherubims around
[1:34:09] him by the millions
[1:34:11] all the time holy holy holy lord god
[1:34:14] almighty
[1:34:15] he could make them force them cause them
[1:34:18] to do
[1:34:18] any part that he wanted them to but he
[1:34:21] wanted a people
[1:34:23] who would choose him and live love him
[1:34:27] and live for him because they wanted to
[1:34:32] not because he forced them to right
[1:34:35] thus we were predestined to that purpose
[1:34:39] amen that predestination put you
[1:34:43] in the place that you are that
[1:34:44] predestinate
[1:34:46] caused you to see this pulpit from this
[1:34:49] angle
[1:34:50] and you from this angle and you from
[1:34:52] this angle and me from this
[1:34:54] angle understand that predestination is
[1:34:58] what caused that
[1:34:59] to be that way yeah god deals with
[1:35:02] everybody different
[1:35:03] i've said this to you many times friend
[1:35:05] god wasn't up there
[1:35:07] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:08] deciding who he wanted to
[1:35:10] to fulfill this purpose here and just
[1:35:13] cut each one of you out as cookie cutter
[1:35:15] christians
[1:35:16] right we're not a slab of dough that
[1:35:19] god's taking the same mold and stamping
[1:35:21] each one of you out
[1:35:23] right we're all different but we're all
[1:35:25] different for a reason
[1:35:27] for a purpose what did brother green
[1:35:29] always say bear with one another's bear
[1:35:31] right bear with one another's bears what
[1:35:33] he always said
[1:35:34] and there's truth to that to
[1:35:37] understanding
[1:35:38] you're different god's called you for a
[1:35:40] different purpose and that's
[1:35:42] why you're doing you look at it from a
[1:35:44] different angle
[1:35:45] because you're different and that
[1:35:47] purpose is being fulfilled
[1:35:48] because you're different amen amen
[1:35:52] and if we could just understand that we
[1:35:54] could come together as a body of
[1:35:56] believers
[1:35:56] so much better than what we do now
[1:36:00] amen not to just dismiss one another
[1:36:04] but but trust one another enough to know
[1:36:07] that
[1:36:08] god god's dealing with you to see this a
[1:36:10] certain way right
[1:36:12] amen and then you look at it i told you
[1:36:15] many times when i was
[1:36:16] in florida i had a brother who had
[1:36:18] certain doctrinal beliefs and i didn't
[1:36:20] agree with it
[1:36:21] but i didn't dismiss him i didn't put
[1:36:23] him out i didn't even say he was wrong
[1:36:26] i just said brother i'll pray about it
[1:36:28] i'll study it i'll see what the lord
[1:36:30] shows me
[1:36:30] and i did that for months and he on and
[1:36:33] on we'd go fishing or go out to lunch or
[1:36:35] something and he said
[1:36:36] well i said brother hi you know i i'm
[1:36:40] still
[1:36:40] praying i'm still you know and it just
[1:36:43] come one time at lunch and i said
[1:36:44] i said brother you keep asking me that
[1:36:47] and not i mean he wasn't
[1:36:50] it wasn't like he was a pest it was
[1:36:52] sincere
[1:36:53] and we were discussing the bible and the
[1:36:55] lord and uh
[1:36:56] and it wasn't every day you know we're
[1:36:59] talking about
[1:37:00] months going by and finally i i just
[1:37:04] i i got to the place that the lord was
[1:37:07] showing me things that was
[1:37:09] different that was pulling me away from
[1:37:12] what he was seeing and i just had to
[1:37:14] tell him brother
[1:37:15] i'm sorry but the more i pray and the
[1:37:18] more i study the more i read the farther
[1:37:20] i get from where you are
[1:37:23] i wanted to hopefully try to
[1:37:27] see something that would bring it into
[1:37:29] perspective that we could
[1:37:31] agree together on a scripture or
[1:37:34] whatever it was
[1:37:35] doctrinal or but it just wasn't there
[1:37:40] and that's okay and i will tell you this
[1:37:43] i love that brother to this day i never
[1:37:46] told him he was wrong
[1:37:47] and then i can remember he never told me
[1:37:49] i was wrong
[1:37:52] now he finally left the church because
[1:37:53] he didn't feel like he was being fed
[1:37:55] because i wasn't
[1:37:56] i guess revelated enough so he finally
[1:37:59] left but we stayed friends
[1:38:00] and and all but he did finally leave the
[1:38:03] church but i never told him he was wrong
[1:38:05] he never told me i was wrong i just
[1:38:08] didn't see it that way and i still don't
[1:38:11] and i'm further now than i was then away
[1:38:13] from where he is
[1:38:14] so but that's just the way that is
[1:38:17] he's as far as i'm concerned he's still
[1:38:19] my brother and i still love him i do
[1:38:21] anything for him i believe he would me
[1:38:23] too
[1:38:23] that's the way it should be see that's
[1:38:25] the way it should be see
[1:38:27] because god's got that purpose there
[1:38:28] god's got that purpose here
[1:38:30] that's why again in the adoption i
[1:38:32] talked about how important it is to
[1:38:33] understand and know
[1:38:34] where you go to church and who your
[1:38:36] pastor is
[1:38:38] brother newton bennett's not the only
[1:38:39] one that i i believe that preaches this
[1:38:41] message that
[1:38:42] preaches what i i believe i preached the
[1:38:44] truth i'm
[1:38:45] i'd be a hypocrite if i stood up here
[1:38:47] and knew i was lying to you
[1:38:49] but i i don't do that i would never do
[1:38:52] that right
[1:38:53] i honestly this just came to me and i
[1:38:56] know it's going to be a strong statement
[1:38:57] i'd rather go to hell to do that
[1:38:58] right hallelujah i would
[1:39:02] then to deceive you or be a hypocrite or
[1:39:04] try to lie to you i'd rather go to hell
[1:39:07] so it's not that
[1:39:10] but god has different people for
[1:39:12] different people
[1:39:13] different pastors for different people
[1:39:15] different and and that's the way it's
[1:39:17] supposed to be
[1:39:18] and that's good that's not bad that's
[1:39:21] good
[1:39:21] amen amen i i understand
[1:39:25] and i used to be to the place hey you
[1:39:27] know
[1:39:28] we're all believers in this message why
[1:39:30] can't we just meet at the convention
[1:39:32] center there's thousands of us to just
[1:39:33] be one big huge happy group
[1:39:35] it doesn't work that way there's
[1:39:39] different ones for different reasons for
[1:39:41] different people
[1:39:42] because we're we're not cookie cutter
[1:39:44] christians
[1:39:45] and every and again to me
[1:39:49] every bit of that goes right back to a
[1:39:51] person's free will
[1:39:54] goes right back to a free moral agency
[1:39:58] our choice your decision
[1:40:01] people go to church for all kinds of
[1:40:03] frivolous reasons oh my family goes
[1:40:05] there
[1:40:05] oh my i have friends that live there oh
[1:40:08] i've been going there for 30 years i
[1:40:09] don't know where else to go
[1:40:11] well you know get god instead of
[1:40:12] religion
[1:40:14] amen that's just tradition and that's
[1:40:17] not that's just religion
[1:40:18] that's not god pray that's where god
[1:40:22] wants you to be
[1:40:23] ask what god said i'm not talking to you
[1:40:24] personally specifically i'm just saying
[1:40:26] in general
[1:40:28] you know don't just go there because you
[1:40:30] went there for 40 years
[1:40:31] don't just go there because your mom and
[1:40:33] dad went there or you
[1:40:36] go there because that's where god sent
[1:40:37] you and that's where god wants you
[1:40:39] and that's where god's gonna bless you
[1:40:42] that's what matters
[1:40:44] that's nothing else your friend when it
[1:40:45] gets down to the end of it nothing else
[1:40:47] really matters
[1:40:48] yes that's just it but it again it boils
[1:40:50] down to our decision
[1:40:52] we're predestinated predestinated to
[1:40:55] that point
[1:40:56] see amen i want to read one more
[1:40:59] scripture
[1:41:00] again it's after 12 i don't i don't want
[1:41:02] to take advantage of them but
[1:41:04] um i do want to go to another scripture
[1:41:06] romans chapter 8.
[1:41:08] we'll begin reading with verse 28.
[1:41:22] and i'll read this last scripture see
[1:41:25] what the
[1:41:26] word the lord takes from there
[1:41:32] god's predestination
[1:41:35] folding into man's choice power of
[1:41:39] transformation
[1:41:41] october 31st 1965. then adam
[1:41:44] deliberately
[1:41:46] listen what brother branham how he
[1:41:48] verbalizes this adam
[1:41:50] deliberately knowing he ought not to
[1:41:54] done it
[1:41:55] walked out with his wife and did this
[1:41:58] act
[1:42:00] knowingly deliberately
[1:42:04] well that's not free choice free will i
[1:42:06] don't know
[1:42:08] deliberately purposely knowingly knowing
[1:42:11] he ought not to
[1:42:12] walked out with his wife did the act of
[1:42:14] course we know that was just a type of
[1:42:16] jesus but
[1:42:17] all this is has god's unfolding
[1:42:19] predestined planned in it
[1:42:20] amen which finally but not but and look
[1:42:24] what brother braham says now he says
[1:42:25] which finally he would have come to it
[1:42:28] anyhow
[1:42:30] he would have come to it anyhow
[1:42:33] well that just sounds like god's just a
[1:42:35] puppeteer well you're going to go this
[1:42:37] way whether you want to or not
[1:42:39] no no no that's not it he would have
[1:42:42] come to that
[1:42:43] anyhow because that was god's
[1:42:46] predestined plan
[1:42:49] based on god's foreknowledge
[1:42:52] so even if it wasn't then it would have
[1:42:55] eventually
[1:42:56] come to that place brother brown saying
[1:42:59] because
[1:42:59] god knew that it would
[1:43:02] god knew that it would god knew that
[1:43:05] there would be
[1:43:06] people that would come on this earth
[1:43:08] that would have the choice
[1:43:10] decision that would not choose him right
[1:43:13] they would not want him the world's full
[1:43:17] of them today
[1:43:18] that would not want him or his word or
[1:43:20] his ways
[1:43:22] and they and he knew that
[1:43:25] but he knew that there would be that
[1:43:27] little group
[1:43:28] he knew that there'd be that little
[1:43:30] flock
[1:43:31] that chosen people that would choose him
[1:43:36] and want him above any and all else
[1:43:39] and they would be willing to live any
[1:43:41] kind of life
[1:43:42] and do any kind of way that he led them
[1:43:45] into
[1:43:47] because they wanted to amen
[1:43:51] that's powerful to me friend which
[1:43:53] finally he would have come to it anyhow
[1:43:55] he would have come to it anyhow but
[1:43:57] that's just because of god's poor
[1:43:58] knowledge
[1:43:59] but see people can take that and say
[1:44:01] well see god's gonna force you to do it
[1:44:02] anyway
[1:44:03] whether you want to or not no that
[1:44:06] that's just complementary to the
[1:44:07] scripture
[1:44:09] but god knew he would see but see
[1:44:12] it had to be that way the wisdom of god
[1:44:14] caused this this thing that displaces
[1:44:17] attribute to be a savior father healer
[1:44:20] you've heard me preach on that he says
[1:44:22] he just let them out there on free moral
[1:44:25] agency to let them
[1:44:26] act he couldn't make them do it and
[1:44:29] still be a just
[1:44:30] god but he could put them on equal with
[1:44:34] him and free moral agency and let them
[1:44:37] do it themselves and he knew
[1:44:40] they would do it right and so then you
[1:44:42] see when adam lived with she brought
[1:44:45] forth twins
[1:44:46] one of them was of satan one of them was
[1:44:49] of adam
[1:44:50] which was of god cain and abel each one
[1:44:53] choice decision if there was no choice
[1:44:57] in decision then
[1:44:59] why was one boy one way and one the
[1:45:01] other
[1:45:03] romans tells us that god loved jacob and
[1:45:06] he
[1:45:06] hated esau before every boy was born
[1:45:09] does that make him unjust
[1:45:11] does that mean there's no predestination
[1:45:13] that mean a man doesn't have a free will
[1:45:15] or a choice to decide
[1:45:19] this means god do yes amen
[1:45:22] is this all it means it just means god
[1:45:24] knew
[1:45:26] romans 8 28 time's getting away so let
[1:45:28] me get here
[1:45:29] and he and we know we know that all
[1:45:32] things work together for good
[1:45:34] to them that love god to them who are
[1:45:36] the called according to his purpose
[1:45:38] called according to his purpose for whom
[1:45:42] he did for no
[1:45:44] he all he also did predestinate to be
[1:45:47] conformed to the image of his son
[1:45:49] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:45:51] many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:45:53] predestinate
[1:45:54] them he also called whom he called
[1:45:58] them he also justified and whom he
[1:46:00] justified
[1:46:01] then he also glorified so you see here
[1:46:05] as we were talking before
[1:46:07] there's a process to this
[1:46:10] that we unfold is on our human brains to
[1:46:13] try to comprehend
[1:46:14] or god revealed to us there's a process
[1:46:18] of it
[1:46:18] not all of this are the same
[1:46:22] but they all work together okay
[1:46:25] see the four knowledge the
[1:46:27] predestination the calling
[1:46:29] the justifying the glorifying they're
[1:46:31] all different
[1:46:32] parts but they all work together they
[1:46:35] all work together to bring together
[1:46:37] the person that you are today amen
[1:46:42] and all of this brings us into the place
[1:46:44] that
[1:46:45] that we desire to be
[1:46:49] this to fulfill this scripture i want to
[1:46:51] be one to fulfill this scripture
[1:46:53] i believe you want to be one fulfill
[1:46:55] that scripture because we choose to and
[1:46:57] want to be
[1:46:59] you can read that same scripture
[1:47:00] millions people in the world today and
[1:47:02] they wouldn't
[1:47:02] have anything to do with it they call it
[1:47:04] fiction or
[1:47:05] whatever they might say all wouldn't
[1:47:08] want to do that or i wouldn't want to
[1:47:09] live that way or
[1:47:10] whatever their decision or choice but
[1:47:11] they choose not to
[1:47:13] you chose to do it because you want to
[1:47:18] and your want to comes from a desire for
[1:47:20] god because you love him
[1:47:21] amen amen because you love him
[1:47:25] those ye justify he glorifies
[1:47:28] what shall we then say to these things
[1:47:30] if god before us
[1:47:32] who can be against us yes he that spared
[1:47:35] not his own
[1:47:36] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:47:38] shall he not with him so freely give us
[1:47:41] all things who who shall lay
[1:47:45] anything to the charge of god's elect it
[1:47:48] is god that justified it
[1:47:50] right who is that to condemn
[1:47:53] is it christ that died yet rather that
[1:47:56] is risen again
[1:47:57] who is even at the right hand of god and
[1:47:59] make it uh
[1:48:00] also make an intercession for us
[1:48:04] paul is getting very demonstrative in
[1:48:06] this scripture and with those who may be
[1:48:08] listening or in his writing
[1:48:11] and telling the roman church who
[1:48:15] who can do this who can combat this
[1:48:18] who can come against who can say no
[1:48:22] now people can but you see the result
[1:48:25] right people can choose oh i don't want
[1:48:28] to do that
[1:48:29] what then you suffer the consequences
[1:48:32] right
[1:48:32] you suffer the results as you're a
[1:48:34] little child
[1:48:36] we become we're very dependent on our
[1:48:38] parents
[1:48:39] and that's what god i think god said
[1:48:41] unless you become his little child
[1:48:43] well he wants us dependent on him and
[1:48:45] trusting in him
[1:48:47] she can't do it in herself even though
[1:48:49] we have our own
[1:48:50] choice we still trust and believe in him
[1:48:54] we still need him and need his help our
[1:48:57] choices don't put us in that place
[1:49:00] hydrogen doesn't make water
[1:49:04] it needs the oxygen at the same time to
[1:49:07] make it water
[1:49:08] you say well then people say well then i
[1:49:12] don't need god
[1:49:13] i have my own choice i can make my own
[1:49:15] way i can do my own things yeah you can
[1:49:17] but you won't make water
[1:49:20] you won't reach heaven amen you won't
[1:49:23] get salvation you won't have the holy
[1:49:25] ghost
[1:49:25] you won't live a victorious life
[1:49:28] amen well i can do this but you need god
[1:49:32] to come and bring that complimentary
[1:49:34] factor in there
[1:49:35] that's the only way that water could
[1:49:36] come and the ostrich
[1:49:38] yes amen but he wants it by
[1:49:42] our free will decision that god wants us
[1:49:45] to bring
[1:49:46] who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:49:48] god's elections
[1:49:51] it's god that decides you know jesus
[1:49:53] christ had free
[1:49:54] free free moral agents
[1:49:57] as a kin folk jesus was a free moral
[1:50:00] agent
[1:50:03] amen amen he said well now wait a minute
[1:50:07] brother newton he was here because he
[1:50:08] was supposed to
[1:50:10] die for my salvation yeah he did that
[1:50:14] but you know what else he said he said i
[1:50:18] lay my life down i pick my life back up
[1:50:22] again
[1:50:22] yes jesus said i could call
[1:50:26] 12 legions of angels right
[1:50:29] but he chose chose decided
[1:50:33] not to do it right he said nobody takes
[1:50:37] my life
[1:50:38] from me i lay my life down
[1:50:41] that was his choice that was his
[1:50:44] decision
[1:50:45] wasn't an easy one too knowing what he
[1:50:47] had to go through you think about the
[1:50:49] garden of gethsemane he's sitting there
[1:50:50] and his sweat became as drops of blood
[1:50:52] can you imagine sweating drops that big
[1:50:56] or whatever drops of blood are that was
[1:50:58] pretty big
[1:51:00] amen in agony knowing what he was facing
[1:51:04] but he chose to do it he chose to do it
[1:51:08] and said i
[1:51:08] could have i could have called
[1:51:12] 12 legions of angels and they would
[1:51:13] rescue me right
[1:51:15] amen but he chose not to
[1:51:19] because he wanted his decision to be for
[1:51:22] you
[1:51:23] for your good for your betterment for
[1:51:26] our salvation that's why he chose what
[1:51:29] he chose
[1:51:31] amen thank you jesus
[1:51:34] yes amen praise the lord let's stand if
[1:51:37] we could
[1:51:46] i know you're probably thinking i want
[1:51:47] brother newton how much further can you
[1:51:49] go with this but
[1:51:52] i have a whole at least another point or
[1:51:54] two i want to make in this
[1:51:56] amen because people then start thinking
[1:52:00] you know
[1:52:02] god made a certain person do a certain
[1:52:05] thing because
[1:52:06] of something that he did with them or to
[1:52:08] them but understand

[1:58:12] they're still in the process of trying
[1:58:14] to get over to their
[1:58:15] other facility so that's the main thing
[1:58:18] that's that's mainly what i'm looking
[1:58:20] for unless the lord put something else
[1:58:23] uh some other place that comes up that
[1:58:25] the lord wants us
[1:58:26] and that's fine too but uh you know
[1:58:30] unless

[1:58:33] gonna work out they're gonna stay where
[1:58:34] they're at
[1:58:36] that would be an issue but uh they're
[1:58:38] still in the process and they're still
[1:58:40] working and so we'll just
[1:58:41] get to that place and as the lord leads
