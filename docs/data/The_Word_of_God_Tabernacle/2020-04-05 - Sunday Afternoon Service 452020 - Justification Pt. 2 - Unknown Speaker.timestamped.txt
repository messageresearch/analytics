[0:08] praise the Lord Saints it's good to be
[0:11] back again on a Sunday and ready to have
[0:13] church again I hope you're ready for the
[0:16] home meeting that we're having here with
[0:18] Micah and my precious wife and looking
[0:21] forward to another time of service today
[0:23] it's a little different I've had a
[0:25] couple of home services but nothing
[0:27] quite like this usually they have people
[0:30] attending but this is a little bit
[0:32] different but I'm glad that we have a
[0:35] place and a time to be able to do it and
[0:38] I was praying this morning is thinking
[0:39] thanking the Lord for the opportunity to
[0:42] be able to do this because you know
[0:43] there's many countries that people wake
[0:45] up and they get secluded and they can't
[0:48] even mention the name of Jesus or have a
[0:49] church to go to or even stream like this
[0:52] so we're very blessed to be able to have
[0:55] this type of opportunity and the time of
[0:58] my having service and being able to
[1:00] mention the name of Jesus and worship
[1:02] Jesus and have it broadcasts literally
[1:04] around the world I guess it is if
[1:06] whoever Tunes in to this YouTube so we
[1:09] unfortunately again as I text you the
[1:12] other day you're not going to have a
[1:13] song service but and y'all probably
[1:16] happy about that if it's up to me
[1:18] singing but what do want to have a
[1:20] service today and get back to where we
[1:23] left off last week but I do want to
[1:25] enter this service with prayer I've
[1:28] gotten a few prayer requests as I had
[1:30] asked a few minutes ago that people
[1:32] would like to be prayed for those that
[1:34] put on the general requests would see
[1:37] the requests but brother Dennis put in a
[1:39] request for his wife again we had prayer
[1:43] with Leah and Dennis the other night
[1:45] over the phone but Leah of course is
[1:47] still working at the doctor's office the
[1:49] doctor's office is keeping their clinic
[1:50] doors open so in the situation like that
[1:54] of course they stay protected but you
[1:56] never know how the devil would want to
[1:58] try to get into her hand
[1:59] Leigha in some ways since remember her
[2:01] in prayer to also remember brother angel
[2:06] and his family I could just read this
[2:10] but you've probably all got the text
[2:11] that you could see that they really
[2:13] wanted to pray for their family he
[2:15] doesn't have on here that their vehicle
[2:17] broke down so we were in discussion last
[2:19] night about his vehicle and what might
[2:21] be wrong with that so just pray for that
[2:23] their vehicle would we just figure out
[2:26] what's wrong with it and the Lord would
[2:28] just touch it and touch our minds or our
[2:30] intellect to know what to do to fix it
[2:32] all so he had on here of course for
[2:35] prayer for his family for the family of
[2:37] God and just to remember these requests
[2:39] in the name of the Lord Jesus also
[2:42] sister Celia had a request for her
[2:45] brother
[2:45] Harlan very very special unspoken
[2:49] requests me and Sonya know a little bit
[2:51] about that just remember they meant
[2:53] prayer God knows and it seemed like a
[2:57] good man I hope to get to meet him
[2:58] someday but he's in Texas and Julia's
[3:01] brother Harlan so remember him in prayer
[3:03] also had a request from sister Norma for
[3:06] her grandson Jonathan she just wrote
[3:09] that he's messing in something and
[3:12] that's probably I guess enough to know
[3:14] but again God knows where Jonathan is
[3:17] and what's going on in his life and what
[3:19] the situation is so let's just remember
[3:21] just to remember them in prayer remember
[3:23] her in prayer and the situation with
[3:27] Jonathan there so we have our unspoken
[3:30] request and we can lift our hands to the
[3:33] Lord if we'd like to whatever we desire
[3:36] in that situation but I know we all have
[3:39] requests we all have desires we just
[3:41] trust the Lord to type so let's bow our
[3:44] heads together and we'll just go to the
[3:45] Lord in prayer for these needs or Jesus
[3:49] father we thank you today for the
[3:51] ability and the opportunity Lord to
[3:53] gather together even if it's in our own
[3:56] homes Lord and through the streaming
[3:58] service and I appreciate the technology
[4:01] Lord to be able to do this and I very
[4:04] much appreciate my son Lord coming and
[4:06] making all of this happen and Lord it
[4:09] just seems so simple
[4:10] you're on the outside of it or you're
[4:12] just turning on your computer to look at
[4:13] it but Lord just watching Michael work
[4:16] now and just there's a way much more
[4:18] than that goes into this and I certainly
[4:21] appreciate him putting forth the effort
[4:22] to make this happen today Lord we just
[4:25] pray God that you'd be with each one
[4:27] move upon them in their separate homes
[4:29] God I believe that we come before you
[4:31] with great expectation of what you'll do
[4:34] for us today the Lord your anointing is
[4:37] an international anointing father it's
[4:39] good to be in one room together in one
[4:41] mind in one Accord but Lord we can't be
[4:43] in one mind in one Accord now even in
[4:46] our separate places because that
[4:47] anointing is International and Lord let
[4:50] it be upon each one of us father speak
[4:52] through these lips the word should have
[4:54] us to hear father and may you bless the
[4:56] years and the ones that are out on the
[4:58] hook up here out in the streaming God as
[5:01] they receive it - God may it be blessed
[5:04] may they be blessed today we pray Lord
[5:07] for every request and every need is made
[5:09] known Lord we know that our country is
[5:12] going through a very traumatic time
[5:14] right now and Lord it's uh it's a time
[5:18] of purging if you will in a time of
[5:21] hopefully maybe some people giving their
[5:24] hearts to you realizing the day in the
[5:26] hour that we live Lord and God would
[5:29] just pray as we have personal requests -
[5:31] Lord for for Dennis's wife Leah Lord and
[5:34] for sister she Leah's brother Harlan and
[5:37] for sister Norma's grandson father
[5:42] Jonathan and Lord for brother angel who
[5:44] wrote for his family and believing for
[5:46] his vehicle Lord there's just so many
[5:49] requests that we have God and I'm sure
[5:51] there's probably many others that
[5:53] weren't mentioned there's many others
[5:54] that weren't sent to me that God we have
[5:57] needs father we lifted up our hands I
[5:59] lifted my hands to you - Lord just
[6:01] expecting you father to move upon these
[6:03] requests and these needs and upon our
[6:06] hearts and lives we're so thankful
[6:08] father as a congregation and I'll stand
[6:10] here Lord as your representative
[6:12] father's the pastor thanking you so much
[6:15] for your blessings upon us and Lord
[6:17] through this time god of what it seems
[6:20] to be isolation but Lord it appears that
[6:23] through talking to them
[6:24] being in communication that Lord that's
[6:27] just not had much of effect Lord on us
[6:30] and Lord through our jobs and things
[6:32] that you're providing for us Lord we're
[6:34] so thankful God that you just are
[6:36] mindful of us and you should watch over
[6:38] us and keep us Lord my mind goes to a
[6:40] friend of mine Johnny green to father I
[6:43] learned last night that he has this covo
[6:46] coronavirus Lord and my brother is in
[6:50] need today and Lord he's not in the
[6:52] grade of health either knowing that for
[6:55] years he's had valley fever father so
[6:57] lord by the medical standards he would
[7:00] might be one of the foremost that would
[7:02] it would affect the most but God I pray
[7:04] that somehow where he is that you would
[7:06] move down upon him touch him and lend to
[7:09] God and keep your hand upon them oh I'm
[7:11] just thankful without being able to call
[7:13] upon your name today Lord and these
[7:15] terror and these troubles sometimes but
[7:18] Lord know that you're always with us in
[7:20] each you never leave us or forsake us
[7:22] lord I pray that you bless us now god
[7:24] help me Lord and speak these words that
[7:27] you have to be heard today for your
[7:28] congregation that each one of us would
[7:30] be blessed by it been committed to you
[7:32] and each one now in the name of the Lord
[7:34] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[7:38] Thank You Saints let me get to the Bible
[7:42] now we're going to try to leave off
[7:43] where we are pick back up where we left
[7:45] off last week and I want to go to Romans
[7:49] chapter 8 again as we did last week I
[7:53] just read one verse of scripture I don't
[7:55] have a music stand on I always wished I
[7:58] had a pulpit or a Bible stand or
[8:02] something where we are now I don't have
[8:04] either one so but we have something here
[8:07] to provide so but all we needs a Holy
[8:09] Ghost us that's the number one thing we
[8:11] need but going to Romans chapter 8 and
[8:14] I'm just going to read one verse here
[8:16] though this time verse 33 and verse 33
[8:19] says who shall lay anything to the
[8:23] charge of God's elect it is God that
[8:27] justify it amen who shall lay anything
[8:30] to the charge of God's elect
[8:32] it is God that justifieth we talked last
[8:35] week about justification and as I
[8:38] mentioned to you I wanted to get a
[8:40] little deeper into that and I want to
[8:42] get into a understanding kind of where
[8:47] we are with the the body spirit and soul
[8:49] again and and you know maybe a greater
[8:52] understanding hopefully maybe this time
[8:54] on on the streaming you can see it a
[8:57] little better than you did last time
[8:59] although mica pretty one up and put it
[9:01] on the website for us which I appreciate
[9:03] that that's there for for if you want to
[9:05] see it if you want to follow along with
[9:07] us and and see how that justification
[9:10] works in our lives again it may not be
[9:13] something that people in the message
[9:15] especially think a whole lot of but
[9:17] again I think justification in the
[9:20] revelation of what justifications done
[9:22] for us can bring us to a greater
[9:24] understanding of who we are in Christ
[9:26] and and take that stand and take that
[9:29] ground to stand firmly on what God has
[9:33] done for us and who we are in him
[9:35] because knowing who we are you got to
[9:37] realize that God has justified you
[9:40] justification made the way for
[9:42] sanctification sanctification made wait
[9:44] for the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost made the
[9:46] way for the person of Christ to come
[9:48] live in you which is what our third
[9:51] heart over here is of God coming in and
[9:53] taking his abode in your heart so I
[9:56] think in fielded justifications a very
[9:58] important subject today I want to end up
[10:01] and get to the place that I've mentioned
[10:03] to you last week that has been in my
[10:07] many years of ministering and in this
[10:09] message I've had this come up several
[10:10] times especially when I'm pastoring that
[10:12] people would ask me questions based on a
[10:15] specific quote that brother Branham made
[10:17] the quoting made was an invisible union
[10:20] some of you may know what I'm talking
[10:22] about but I want to get to a clearer
[10:25] understanding I don't want to interpret
[10:27] what brother Adam said I don't I don't
[10:29] want to say what I feel brother had a
[10:31] meant but maybe a clearer understanding
[10:33] at least in my opinion of what I believe
[10:36] brother Branham was talking about when
[10:38] he made this specific statement and what
[10:41] he said but
[10:41] do that we're gonna get delve a little
[10:43] deeper into the justification part of it
[10:46] and the justification teaching here now
[10:50] there was some things that I said last
[10:52] week that in prayer when I was praying
[10:57] and got done praying and the Lord and
[10:59] impressed upon me that maybe there was
[11:02] some things I said last week that may
[11:04] have been a little misunderstanding and
[11:07] I want to clear that up because I said
[11:08] last week that the justification takes
[11:11] place in the soul and that's true
[11:14] the justification does take place in the
[11:16] soul that's the place that God is most
[11:18] concerned about the inside of the inside
[11:20] now we read that quote last week brother
[11:23] Graham talked about the inside devil has
[11:25] reign of the body spirit but he can't
[11:27] get on the inside he tries to and he is
[11:30] of course in the inside when were born
[11:32] with the nature of the children of wrath
[11:34] but when we're born again or when that
[11:36] we get justified then that old nature's
[11:39] gone and God wipes away all those sins
[11:41] that justification takes place now we'll
[11:45] read the scripture in a minute to try to
[11:46] clarify this too but I made a statement
[11:49] that the justification takes place in
[11:52] the soul where the soul is burnt out and
[11:55] the Holy Spirit comes and God seals you
[11:57] with the Holy Spirit and and that's
[11:59] that's that's God's justification you
[12:01] stand in your perfect ought to be
[12:04] condition which again is the word
[12:05] justified remember justified was in your
[12:08] ought to be conditioned or righteous the
[12:11] word righteous means that you are in
[12:13] standing here in perfect standing with
[12:16] God if you're in perfect standing with
[12:18] God then you're in the place that God
[12:20] saw you in his mind before the
[12:22] foundation of the world in your ought to
[12:23] be condition and that's where God
[12:26] desires us to be now we draw it out the
[12:28] comparison last week we talked about the
[12:31] body and the spirit
[12:32] and how somebody you make mistakes in
[12:35] your old life and you're dealing drugs
[12:37] or go back to the woman you know the
[12:39] story I told and go back to the
[12:41] woman and say you know I'm the one that
[12:43] Dilts your husband drugs and they killed
[12:45] him and and I'm sorry but I never did it
[12:47] you know yes you did do it see those
[12:50] things of the body justification
[12:53] although it does away with every sin
[12:58] that you ever did every mistake you ever
[13:01] made justifies it doesn't nullify God's
[13:06] biblical law of reaping what you sow you
[13:10] will always reap what you sow regardless
[13:13] of whether you're a child of God not a
[13:14] child of God born again not born again
[13:16] believer taught a believer whatever you
[13:18] are the Bible says you will reap what
[13:21] you sow you can't do away with that that
[13:23] that is the law of God that will always
[13:25] stand and it's always going to be true
[13:27] so when you when you sow to a whirlwind
[13:33] to the wind you weep a whirlwind so if
[13:36] you sow to the things of drugs and that
[13:41] past life you're going to reap that in
[13:44] the flesh but again remember I would
[13:46] rather be guilty in the eyes of man than
[13:49] in the eyes of God so the point I'm
[13:52] trying to make is yes justification is
[13:54] in the soul but God also brings about
[13:58] the justification in the body as well
[14:01] now that again the culmination of that
[14:04] doesn't happen until the body change
[14:06] when God changes this body go from
[14:09] corruption to incorruption and for
[14:11] morally in mortality but the
[14:13] justification we're concerned about is
[14:16] the soul now I bring that up because the
[14:20] quote that I want to get to that that is
[14:22] somewhat controversial on some people is
[14:25] going to involve every element of this
[14:27] it's going to involve every male of the
[14:30] body spirit soul it's going to involve
[14:31] every element so keep that in mind as we
[14:34] talk about this so yes justification
[14:36] isn't the soul that's what God is
[14:38] concerned about because that's God you
[14:39] never did it in the first place remember
[14:42] even in your old life and gods Minds
[14:44] what you did and you weren't even that
[14:46] person
[14:47] I'm not even this person I am who God
[14:50] made me on the inside again brother
[14:52] Graham said
[14:53] if this Bella flesh were to drop off God
[14:55] would be standing in front of you so
[14:57] that's the place that we that we
[15:00] understand between the soul and the body
[15:02] now I want to go over and remember it's
[15:05] God that justify it God that justified
[15:07] no man could lay anything to the charge
[15:09] of God's elect is God's it justifies now
[15:12] people may come and say you did
[15:14] so-and-so and yes you did do that
[15:16] but God has justified you so what else
[15:20] matters for he's the Lord amen I love
[15:22] saying that because it's true and and
[15:25] it's important it's an important thing
[15:26] to keep in mind to understand now in
[15:29] acts I want to go to the 13th chapter
[15:32] and I will eventually put my Bible down
[15:34] but in Acts chapter 13 I wanted to read
[15:36] just two verses here and then I want to
[15:38] go to Romans chapter 3 Romans chapter 3
[15:43] I have to look at my notes every once in
[15:45] a while because just past 25 woke up the
[15:48] other day so I have quite the memory
[15:51] used to but I try to remember but Acts
[15:53] chapter 13 verse 38 and 39 let's look at
[15:57] this real quick it says be it known unto
[16:00] you therefore men and brethren that
[16:02] through this man Jesus Christ is
[16:07] preached unto you the forgiveness of
[16:10] sins now I'm going to get to something -
[16:12] with with the understanding of the
[16:14] forgiveness of sins
[16:15] the remission of sins because he
[16:17] remember in acts 2:38 it says be
[16:20] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[16:21] the remission of sin the word
[16:24] forgiveness the word remit they all
[16:26] coincide with each other there's a
[16:29] slight difference in them just like
[16:31] there is there between forgiveness and
[16:33] justification the difference between
[16:35] being justified and forgiven now it may
[16:39] be a slight difference but the result is
[16:43] astronomical
[16:45] the result is it's a world of difference
[16:48] it is to me anyway but he said be don't
[16:51] be it known unto you therefore men and
[16:53] brothers that through this man is
[16:56] preached unto you the forgiveness of
[16:58] sins the forgiveness of sin God does
[17:01] forgive amen now the forgiveness of sin
[17:05] means that you did it right if you did
[17:09] it you can be forgiven which and
[17:12] forgiveness basically means that I'm
[17:14] going to not hold you responsible for
[17:17] what you did there's not going to be a
[17:19] penalty levied against you there's not
[17:21] going to be a judgment come against you
[17:23] I forgive you you did it but I'm
[17:26] forgiving you it I'm not exercising any
[17:31] punishment towards you
[17:33] remit means to be done away with amen
[17:37] you did it but it's being done away with
[17:39] it's kind of maybe the difference
[17:42] between the president pardons someone
[17:44] and commuting a sentence maybe getting
[17:47] off on the wrong foot here but you know
[17:49] the President of the United States can
[17:51] pardon somebody or they can commute a
[17:54] sentence commuting a sentences
[17:56] forgiveness pardon is remitting pardon
[17:59] means that your your record is wiped
[18:02] away now in the memory of man you did it
[18:04] but your record that they have down in
[18:07] some file cabinet or on some computer
[18:09] it's done away with commuting a sentence
[18:11] just means you did it but they're saying
[18:13] you you've you've served enough time and
[18:17] you've paid the price the penalty and
[18:19] it's okay to go free now so you see the
[18:22] two end up in a freedom and their
[18:24] liberation of the individual but it's
[18:26] two different situations if we commute a
[18:30] sentence is still on your record
[18:32] but you've paid the penalty a pardon is
[18:36] it expunges your record didn't do it you
[18:40] understand it - now see that's the
[18:43] forgiveness and the remittance it's two
[18:45] different things but it produces the
[18:47] same product but now the forgiveness of
[18:50] sins see a 39th verse by him Jesus all
[18:55] that believe are justified from all
[18:58] things from which he could not be
[19:02] justified by the law of Moses now that's
[19:04] where we left off last week read a
[19:06] couple of scriptures Galatians again
[19:08] we're going to get to Galatians again
[19:10] understanding that we are not justified
[19:12] by the law remember this is of course
[19:14] Luthor's whole message justification by
[19:17] faith and faith alone it's not by works
[19:20] it's not by anything you can do it's by
[19:23] God's sovereignty and your free will
[19:26] decision to choose and decide this is
[19:30] what I want this is what I choose so the
[19:33] difference is he you see all that God
[19:35] those who believe are justified from all
[19:40] things which he could not be justified
[19:42] by the law so by the law remember the
[19:46] law just covered sin the sin was still
[19:49] there
[19:49] the desire was still there the water was
[19:53] still there but the sin was covered all
[19:55] it was was enough to bring to bring man
[19:58] back into a working relationship with
[20:01] God again not in fellowship not in
[20:04] communion but a working relationship
[20:06] just like e-even with Abraham and David
[20:09] it was a working relationship was a
[20:11] loving relationship the love didn't
[20:13] change but it was a working relationship
[20:15] God said that am I gonna hide this thing
[20:19] for my prophet what I'm about to do to
[20:22] Abraham he's talking about
[20:23] well no no he said no I can't do it so
[20:25] he came in he told Abraham I'm gonna go
[20:27] and send go down and see if it's also
[20:30] wicked as they say it is in Sodom send
[20:32] his too anxious to go check and he told
[20:34] Abraham pay for him what he was doing he
[20:36] had that relationship but it wasn't
[20:39] until Jesus Christ came and the blood of
[20:41] Christ was shed that brought men and
[20:43] gotted man back into perfect fellowship
[20:46] again back to the libman ear they had in
[20:49] the Garden of Eden back to a perfect
[20:51] communion where God and man could become
[20:54] one that one ship is what this bride has
[20:58] looked to today is that invisible Union
[21:01] the bride in Christ uniting together
[21:03] could only happen after that period of
[21:06] time so they had that working
[21:07] relationship see by the law was only a
[21:10] covering so only that covering could not
[21:13] justify a man it can bring him again
[21:16] into a working relationship with God but
[21:18] it could not justify him now it brings
[21:21] into the difference between
[21:22] justification forgiveness remittance
[21:25] justification
[21:27] means you never did it never did it in
[21:30] the first place and the mind of God does
[21:33] not exist it never happened now that's
[21:37] the incredible power God has to forget
[21:40] and has the tremendous powers we know to
[21:43] forgive but what about the power he has
[21:45] to forget forgiveness just means that
[21:48] you remember it
[21:50] I just forgive you for it justification
[21:52] means you didn't do it
[21:54] you never even did it to begin with so
[21:58] it now justification could not be by the
[22:01] law but now through the blood of Jesus
[22:03] Christ every sin that dips into that
[22:06] blood is annihilated even out of the
[22:08] memories of God now in your body spirit
[22:12] you did do it in this world of
[22:16] acknowledgment and of memories and of
[22:22] records that people keep it would say
[22:25] yes you did it but in God's mind you
[22:28] never did it never existed he's the Lord
[22:32] but see now in in God's mind you could
[22:35] not be justified by the law it only
[22:38] covered that sin the blood of Christ
[22:41] annihilates that sin that's what
[22:43] justification completely wipes away your
[22:47] old life completely wipes away
[22:50] everything that you did in that old life
[22:52] amen
[22:53] let me read something I believe I wanted
[22:57] to get to here now this is in the future
[23:02] home now you know in future home brother
[23:05] branham talks about the the the earth
[23:10] receiving its Redemption just like the
[23:14] man receives its Redemption by water
[23:17] baptism fiery baptism and coming in
[23:20] living in it now in future home he talks
[23:23] about this and the steps that it gets to
[23:25] so listen real close because I know we
[23:28] all understand this but there's a couple
[23:29] of points in here I want to get to
[23:31] specifically future home misses in
[23:33] August 1964 now the first step is
[23:36] repentance and ask them
[23:39] well we know repentance is repentance
[23:41] towards God sincere sorrowful Nisour
[23:44] what you did a turning away from your
[23:47] old ways and delving into the new ways
[23:50] in Christ's first step is repentance
[23:54] toward God then follows that is water
[23:56] baptism water baptism repent and be
[23:59] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see
[24:01] water baptism follows showing that
[24:04] repentance was genuine to remit amen
[24:09] remit our past sins just like John said
[24:15] or Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[24:18] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[24:21] Christ for remission now it's a
[24:23] remission of your past sins what you did
[24:26] here in the past again that's what
[24:29] brings us from here to here remittance
[24:32] brings us from a nature of the children
[24:36] of Wrath an indwelling of the devil to a
[24:39] place of cleanness to a place of being
[24:42] accepted into sanctification where where
[24:45] there is where there is no more
[24:47] defilement and your life begins to get
[24:50] cleaned up again remember that's the
[24:53] most dangerous spot as a person gets the
[24:55] lights all cleaned up and they think
[24:57] they're ready to go and they're a child
[24:58] of God and God hasn't come identified
[25:01] himself with you you're in the worst
[25:02] spot you can be in you think you're
[25:04] there but you're not but now now that
[25:07] that baptism now shows that that
[25:09] repentance was genuine that you're that
[25:12] you truly meant your repentance although
[25:14] people can get baptized still follow
[25:16] through with the emotion of being
[25:18] baptized and still not be right still
[25:21] not being right standing go God still
[25:23] not even have a true repentance even
[25:26] though they could go through the motions
[25:27] of being baptized but that if it's true
[25:31] repentance baptized remits the sin amen
[25:35] remember what our menses was her menses
[25:37] was wiping the wiping away the slate
[25:40] cleaning the slate Amen remitting the
[25:44] past sin the things that you did in the
[25:46] past not future sins not things that are
[25:49] coming but just what happened
[25:50] the past you repented for what you did
[25:53] in the past see can't repent for what
[25:56] you're gonna do you repent for what you
[25:58] did do even today as children of God we
[26:01] repent from what we did do not what
[26:03] we're going to do what we did do now the
[26:05] blood of Jesus Christ came to take care
[26:07] of what you did do and what you're going
[26:09] to do you repent for what we did do now
[26:14] that has nothing look nice in that room
[26:16] it's our past sin but that has nothing
[26:18] to do with future sins
[26:21] it only remits repent and be baptized in
[26:26] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[26:28] remission taking away of past sin has
[26:32] nothing to do with the future just your
[26:35] sin that's been chopped off what you did
[26:37] do you can't repent from what Adam done
[26:41] you never did it Adam did you just get
[26:45] forgiveness for what you done the old
[26:48] nature is still there see but that but
[26:52] when that remittance comes it does away
[26:54] with all of that old sin and gets rid of
[26:57] the things that you did in the past and
[26:59] the things that we've done in the past
[27:01] and God forgives us for amen God God
[27:06] does not hold us responsible for those
[27:07] things but now let me get you a new
[27:10] scripture here probably don't even need
[27:14] my glasses I don't have anybody to look
[27:15] at no offense to my wife and my son but
[27:20] go Romans chapter 3 now let's go to
[27:23] Romans chapter 3 and I want to begin
[27:25] with verse 20 Romans chapter 3 verse 20
[27:30] because I want to save a little bit of
[27:32] time to read a to read a little bit of
[27:36] the message there at the end of
[27:38] invisible union and get into the really
[27:40] depth of the subject that I really
[27:42] wanted to talk about today but now in
[27:44] Romans chapter 3 verse 20 therefore by
[27:47] the deeds of the law there shall no
[27:50] flesh be justified remember notice that
[27:52] says no flesh be justified in his sight
[27:57] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[28:00] amen that's what brought the law brought
[28:03] the knowledge of
[28:04] and that you were doing wrong we didn't
[28:06] know we were doing wrong until a law
[28:08] came against it but now the
[28:11] righteousness of God without the law is
[28:14] manifested the righteousness of the law
[28:16] the righteousness of God without the law
[28:18] Amen because a man could not become
[28:20] righteous with the law so it had to be
[28:23] outside of the law to become righteous
[28:25] which is the righteousness of God and
[28:28] praise the Lord
[28:29] we gotta realize we've become the very
[28:32] righteousness of God the righteousness
[28:34] of God again that's that justification
[28:36] that's that being justified that's in
[28:38] that ought to be condition okay you're
[28:41] in that ought to be condition with God
[28:43] without the law is manifested where's it
[28:45] manifested in me in you and those who
[28:49] believe and those who have been
[28:51] justified and those who live this life
[28:53] that we hold so dearly it's been done in
[28:56] us it's manifested in us we are the
[28:58] manifestation for all the world to see
[29:00] of the righteousness of Jesus Christ the
[29:02] world doesn't understand it they can't
[29:04] comprehend it they might make fun of it
[29:06] but it doesn't matter because it's still
[29:08] the righteousness of God witnessed by
[29:10] the law and the prophets so it doesn't
[29:13] do away with the law but it just
[29:15] magnifies it see even the righteousness
[29:17] of God 22nd verse even the righteousness
[29:20] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[29:22] unto all and upon all them that believe
[29:26] for there is no difference those that
[29:29] believe if you believe that's it now
[29:31] it's not belief like the devil believes
[29:33] it's beyond belief to getting to the
[29:35] understanding by revelation of what it
[29:38] really is for all have sinned and come
[29:41] short of the glory of God being
[29:43] justified freely by His grace through
[29:46] the redemption that is Jesus Christ amen
[29:51] now that brings into the word that
[29:54] brings us to the word Redemption from
[29:56] the justification the justification
[29:59] brings you into by grace brings you into
[30:02] that Redemption which is bringing you
[30:04] from where you were in the mind of God
[30:06] to this fallen condition to go to bypass
[30:09] our theophanies to go through sin
[30:11] to live this life to get into the place
[30:14] of redemption which brings us back
[30:16] through the blood of Christ through
[30:18] justification freely by the blood of
[30:20] Christ to bring us back into that
[30:22] position with God again that full
[30:24] Redemption has taken place the price
[30:27] paid for you has been done at Calvary
[30:31] that price was paid so when that price
[30:34] was paid and you accepted it you have to
[30:37] accept it it's your free will it brings
[30:39] you into that place of redemption you've
[30:40] been redeemed amen now we still live in
[30:43] these sticky fleshes these bodies but
[30:46] you have been redeemed you're as good as
[30:49] their brother Graham said we are as good
[30:50] as their and the mind of God were
[30:53] already there why because we're back in
[30:54] that place again we're back in that
[30:57] position we're no longer the Satan's
[30:59] Satan's pawnshop we're no longer the the
[31:02] millions of the world as he had us to be
[31:04] we were enslaved by the by the whims of
[31:09] the devil God has redeemed us back into
[31:12] our proper position now we are in our
[31:15] ought to be conditioned that
[31:16] justification has taken place that is
[31:21] Jesus that is Christ Jesus who God has
[31:25] set forth to be a perpetuation through
[31:28] faith in his blood to declare his
[31:30] righteousness for the remission of sins
[31:33] that are past through the forbearance of
[31:37] God
[31:38] now that perpetuation simply means that
[31:41] that that that blood is still there it
[31:44] means just like this the the issue of
[31:47] justification that we talked about this
[31:49] last Sunday is that perpetual existence
[31:51] that continues to unfold and evolve in
[31:54] your life
[31:55] it's justification just like that
[31:57] perpetuation that blood is there it's a
[32:00] perpetual existence of the blood being
[32:04] there for that sac up of that sacrifice
[32:07] for you that perpetuation does not leave
[32:10] it takes your place it stands in your
[32:13] stand
[32:14] remember we said it's last Sunday that
[32:17] perpetuation is there that blood on the
[32:19] mercy seat is the there so that it's tan
[32:22] in your place it takes your place so you
[32:26] could take his place by the
[32:28] righteousness of Jesus Christ and robed
[32:32] in His righteousness without spot
[32:34] wrinkle or blemish you're justified you
[32:37] never do it in the first place
[32:39] praise the Lord man if we could just get
[32:42] a revelation that this probably gets a
[32:43] revelation of that friend we know who we
[32:45] are we know who we are God we don't
[32:48] belong to this world would I belong to
[32:50] the things of this world sure we hear we
[32:51] read right in that elements but we're
[32:53] not of this world we're children of God
[32:55] we're ready to go home we look at the
[32:58] things in the world that's going on
[33:00] today we look at this coronavirus thing
[33:02] you know brother now I don't think this
[33:04] qualifies because I don't think this is
[33:06] shut in the church doors but but just
[33:08] think about this it's just a preview of
[33:11] what how little it would take to close
[33:15] the church doors see how little it will
[33:19] take just in what they've done here and
[33:21] if you don't close your doors now I
[33:23] gotta be careful the Lord told me to be
[33:25] careful about what I'm saying on here
[33:27] this is out for the whole world to see
[33:29] so we'll talk about this at another time
[33:32] I feel checked because like I said we're
[33:36] gonna have to go the Lord checked me on
[33:37] what on things that I say on this
[33:40] dreaming so I'm going to do that but but
[33:44] you can see what's going on we're
[33:45] looking for a rapture I don't mean to be
[33:49] crass or hard it's not my job to find a
[33:56] cure for coronavirus it's my job to
[33:59] preach the gospel I'm not responsible
[34:02] for for the virus for the cure of the
[34:06] virus I'm responsible for praying for
[34:09] those and for praying for Humanity and
[34:11] praying for God's people but God brings
[34:17] things on this earth that that that is
[34:21] just very well his perfect will and far
[34:24] be it for me or any of us to try to pray
[34:27] against God's perfect will but I love
[34:29] people I love humans I love
[34:32] I don't like to see one per one person
[34:35] dying from this and it's been a very
[34:37] small amount of people really honestly
[34:39] this give their lives to this but one is
[34:42] too many
[34:42] especially if it's your loved one so I
[34:45] don't mean it in that way
[34:47] I want I want you know my heart I want
[34:50] everybody to go and if I can do anything
[34:52] to help or save eating I can't save
[34:55] anyone but help bring it to that point
[34:57] in somebody then I want to do it a man
[34:59] now but this one so we've gone through
[35:02] the understanding that perpetual
[35:05] existence perpetuation perpetual
[35:08] existence the remission the the
[35:10] justification the justification did end
[35:12] with looser
[35:13] it began with Luther it continues on now
[35:17] justification didn't end when you got
[35:20] the Holy Ghost it's still you're still
[35:22] justifying all the time every day
[35:25] completely your slate being wiped clean
[35:28] amen he says to declare 26 verse now to
[35:32] declare I say at this time his
[35:35] righteousness that he might be just you
[35:39] think Christ is just Amen he's just and
[35:43] the justifier of him which believeth in
[35:47] Jesus now he couldn't be the just fire
[35:49] he himself wasn't just but he is just
[35:52] that that makes him to come to justifier
[35:54] now you think well that's Jesus that
[36:00] that's God of course it is but what did
[36:03] he tell Peter he said I give to you the
[36:07] keys to the kingdom
[36:09] whatsoever you bound on earth is bound
[36:12] in heaven whatsoever you loose on earth
[36:14] is loosed in heaven whatsoever since you
[36:16] ran it they are remitted think about
[36:19] that
[36:19] that's quite an understanding to believe
[36:23] as a child of God I mean the the Bible
[36:26] says Jesus said do you not do you not
[36:28] know that the Saints shall judge the
[36:29] earth right I mean these great powers
[36:32] and authorities of God's Word are given
[36:35] into our possession God has given these
[36:38] things to us this is our responsibility
[36:41] let's not take it lightly I don't take
[36:44] this lightly some of you think they
[36:46] think Whitey's Manny's still in the
[36:47] cotan time cuz this is Church I don't
[36:50] take this lightly friend this is this is
[36:53] church to me wherefore is boasting them
[36:56] it is it is excluded by what law of
[37:00] works neighbor by the law of faith
[37:04] therefore we conclude that a man is
[37:07] justified by faith without the deeds of
[37:10] the law justified by faith praise the
[37:14] Lord
[37:15] now it's your faith where's the faith
[37:16] come from you said well faith in the
[37:18] body is faith in the spirit the faith
[37:21] come from my feet might my free will the
[37:24] faith come from my free moral agency to
[37:27] believe let's got to it's got to come
[37:30] from your free choice he's if it doesn't
[37:35] come from your free choice or free
[37:36] desire to have faith to believe that
[37:39] where does it come from
[37:40] that's where God dwells in faith amen
[37:43] now I want to transition over backing
[37:48] into a couple quotes I want to read one
[37:50] one here I want to read to begin with
[37:52] from last week but I want I want to try
[37:54] to start to transition now into to give
[37:57] me a little more time transition into
[37:59] what I really wanted to talk about today
[38:01] and get into the specifics of that one
[38:04] quote because that that's going to take
[38:05] me just a little bit of time but we'll
[38:07] get to it here this again why Christ we
[38:09] could read this last week right why
[38:11] Christ feet and Clarksville Tennessee
[38:14] October 59 now God is not going to hold
[38:19] a man responsible because he is a sinner
[38:23] because he was remembered sentient
[38:26] brother Ram said a sinner can't sin
[38:27] that's that's just what he is because he
[38:31] was born a sinner but what God is going
[38:34] to hold a man responsible for is because
[38:37] that he remains a sinner he don't have
[38:41] to remain the center for there is a
[38:43] provision made for his justification
[38:45] through Jesus Christ so we understand
[38:48] what happened in the Garden of Eden and
[38:50] then everybody came into this world
[38:53] shades anybody come to the world
[38:54] speaking lies we were all by nature the
[38:57] children of Wrath our nature our soul
[39:00] commanded us to lie steal cheat steal we
[39:03] talked about that last week little boy
[39:04] come and knock the lamp over you know
[39:06] it's nobody taught him that that was his
[39:08] nature we come into that nature because
[39:10] of the fall in the Garden of Eden but
[39:12] that wasn't your fault it wasn't my
[39:14] fault
[39:14] but it is my fault if I don't choose the
[39:17] way of escape that God has prepared for
[39:19] us through Jesus Christ in his blood
[39:21] that's what God's gonna hold a man
[39:23] responsible for now if we go into the
[39:26] Garden of Eden one look at this real
[39:28] quick and and get into and please part
[39:31] of me I'm not I'm not picking I really
[39:34] want to bring this to a complete
[39:36] understanding and of course you got to
[39:38] understand and draw the difference
[39:40] between a worldly woman and a godly
[39:41] woman a Holy Ghost field respectful lady
[39:46] versus a woman of the world say there's
[39:49] a whole big difference there it's
[39:51] amazing how you see these Hollywood
[39:54] stars are now saying we're all in this
[39:56] together with this coronavirus no we're
[39:58] not we're not all in this together we
[40:00] don't all have hundred acre ranches or
[40:02] 10,000 square foot penthouses we don't
[40:04] all have home theaters and bowling
[40:06] alleys and back to basketball courts and
[40:08] tennis courts and go roaming around
[40:09] wherever we want to many of the people
[40:12] this country don't have how hundreds of
[40:13] thousand dollars pouring into their
[40:15] account every day most those people
[40:16] could not if they didn't get a penny for
[40:18] any work they did for the next 12 months
[40:20] and still be multimillionaires so yeah
[40:23] no we're not in this together there's
[40:24] there's a big difference they're trying
[40:26] to draw and and and and bring together
[40:29] that separation frame the separation
[40:31] between Hollywood and the common man is
[40:33] so far removed this was bigger than the
[40:36] Grand Canyon but the world in half and
[40:38] you might have an idea of the difference
[40:40] of the gulf between those people in the
[40:42] common American citizen but but I do
[40:47] want to talk about this situation and
[40:50] this this Lord will it will be the
[40:53] beginning of what I want to talk about
[40:54] on this let me read a quote first all
[40:57] right let me read a scripture first
[41:00] let's go to first Timothy
[41:04] and I was gonna do this second let's go
[41:06] to first Timothy let's see begin with
[41:09] the twelfth first first Timothy one
[41:11] chapter chapter one verse 12 as Paul of
[41:15] course from the writings of Timothy he
[41:18] says and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord
[41:20] who had enabled me for that he counted
[41:23] me faithful putting me into the ministry
[41:26] who was before a blasphemer
[41:29] now what did Jesus say was gonna happen
[41:31] to those that blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[41:33] they would not be forgiven in this world
[41:35] of the world to come see but what did
[41:38] Saul who became Paul do and what was his
[41:41] Proclamation what was the defining line
[41:44] that Paul drew for us to understand
[41:46] where God's grace is and where the law
[41:49] is or were the justification is and were
[41:53] the unforgiveness or non justification
[41:55] is look what he says who was a
[41:56] blasphemer and we know he was and a
[42:00] persecutor and injurious but I obtained
[42:03] mercy obtained mercy because I did it
[42:07] ignorantly in unbelief now you see where
[42:11] Paul's talking about and and we see
[42:14] where he draws the difference he draws
[42:17] the variance between doing it
[42:18] unknowingly he didn't know now remember
[42:22] and brother man has told us many times
[42:24] by the Greek used to tell us that's not
[42:26] going to hold people responsible for
[42:28] what they don't know now there are those
[42:31] people you can go to believe it's 1st
[42:33] Peter chapter 3 there are those people
[42:36] that are willfully ignorant and there's
[42:39] a difference there's a difference in
[42:41] those that obtain knowledge or or get a
[42:45] small understanding of something but
[42:47] decide to remain willfully ignorant
[42:49] there's a difference in being willfully
[42:51] ignorant in just not knowing see and and
[42:54] and the willfully ignorant is not going
[42:56] to be excused but you see now in the
[42:58] course nowadays no ignorance is going to
[43:01] be excused and God used a weakened
[43:02] ignorance it doesn't we get it anymore
[43:04] because there's so many ways to have a
[43:06] knowledge of it but again if those who
[43:09] don't know they just don't know see and
[43:12] and and and God takes that into
[43:15] consideration if they don't know
[43:16] ignorant Paul said he did it
[43:18] ignorant Lee through unbelief so that
[43:21] ignorant once he obtained the knowledge
[43:23] or once he obtained see if he did it
[43:26] ignorantly and Jesus came and then a
[43:28] pillar of cloud and struck him down and
[43:30] said why persecutest thou me and he got
[43:33] up and continued on to the road to
[43:35] Damascus - to hand those orders and to
[43:38] continue to follow the bidding of the
[43:39] high priests then he would be cut off
[43:42] that of any right but it's sort of like
[43:45] the woman that was caught in the act of
[43:47] adultery we know what the Bible says
[43:49] about being caught in the act of
[43:50] adultery she should be stoned to death
[43:52] she was caught in the very act but when
[43:55] she came to Jesus Jesus said where that
[43:57] accusers she said I have none he says
[44:00] neither do i condemn thee but what did
[44:03] he say first year without sin cast the
[44:05] first stone
[44:06] ye without sin cast the first stone he
[44:09] said where are thy accusers I don't have
[44:10] any they walked away one at a time and
[44:13] he said neither do i condemn thee go and
[44:16] don't do it again
[44:18] sin no more and she's got that knowledge
[44:21] and she received grace by that knowledge
[44:24] now what she did after that was her
[44:26] choice
[44:26] I personally don't believe she went back
[44:28] into that I don't believe God would have
[44:30] gave her the chance if he knew that he
[44:31] she was going to go back into that Paul
[44:33] didn't either Saul became Paul and he
[44:35] didn't go back into that he left that
[44:37] and started met Ananias and started the
[44:40] life of the gospel of Christ so there's
[44:42] there's your there's your variance so
[44:45] let's read this invisible Union now most
[44:49] of what I'm going to be talking about
[44:50] now is going to come from invisible
[44:51] Union if you want a message to listen to
[44:57] this week listen to invisible Union I
[44:59] also got a scripture when once you read
[45:01] another scripture I mentioned last week
[45:03] Psalms 56 11 hope you all read that I
[45:07] will David said I will not fear what man
[45:11] shall do unto me but I want you to read
[45:13] job 3:25 read job 325 this week
[45:18] and then see if those things don't apply
[45:20] to the day that we're living amen
[45:23] but now look what are you saying now
[45:24] taking into account what Paul said did
[45:27] it ignorantly invisible union so listen
[45:29] that message this week when you get a
[45:31] chance there really couldn't be an
[45:33] excuse because pretty much all of your
[45:35] home now you should have the opportunity
[45:38] to be able to listen to it he says now
[45:42] look it look what Hollywood has done to
[45:45] the woman look how it has robbed the
[45:49] sacred virtues of the woman on and on we
[45:52] could go see all this she lost she did
[45:56] she she how did she do it because there
[46:00] was a subtle instrument called the
[46:02] church the church not the bride the
[46:05] church made her feel like she was okay
[46:08] make it look like it's okay you know but
[46:12] it's but it wasn't like there like there
[46:16] was in the Garden of Eden a subtle
[46:18] person the devil walked into the church
[46:20] just like he did in the Garden of Eden
[46:22] and deceived her into it deceived her
[46:26] into it she is deceived the woman thinks
[46:31] she don't mean to be wrong Eve didn't
[46:34] mean to be wrong listen that very close
[46:36] friend Eve didn't mean to do wrong it
[46:40] wasn't wilfully again draw the
[46:43] comparison first Peter 3 willfully
[46:47] ignorant to the point brother Bam's
[46:49] talking to you think about Paul Paul
[46:51] said I did it ignorantly through
[46:53] unbelief not willfully but through
[46:56] unbelief well Graham say she was
[46:59] deceived into it now understand this was
[47:03] 20 days before brother Branham but
[47:06] before his accident one month before
[47:08] brother Brown passed away
[47:09] this message was preached one month
[47:11] November 25th 1965 so he says she was
[47:17] deceived she didn't mean to do it
[47:21] it wasn't willfully so keep that in mind
[47:25] it wasn't willfully the Bible said in
[47:28] 2nd Timothy 3 now I'm sorry I
[47:31] never correct brother branham but I've
[47:33] got it but that's the wrong scripture he
[47:36] says second Timothy three its first
[47:38] Timothy two I went back I knew that's
[47:42] where it was but then I read this and I
[47:44] thought I was wrong
[47:46] so I went back to check my Bible and
[47:47] unless my Bible is printed wrong it is
[47:50] first Timothy - it is not second Timothy
[47:53] three but you know what that just tells
[47:55] me brother Ben was a man brother branham
[47:58] was just a man he was subject to make
[47:59] mistakes just like the rest of us are
[48:01] and I believe comes to the Bible out of
[48:03] the word I should say nobody comes to
[48:05] that anointing or the say at the Lord so
[48:07] we'll just say it this way the Bible
[48:08] said so if you go back can you see this
[48:10] quote you'll know I'm correcting it the
[48:12] Bible said in first Timothy two she was
[48:15] deceived and deceived is not when you
[48:19] willfully do it was deceived is not when
[48:23] you willfully do it
[48:25] amen so you understand that's what he's
[48:28] talking about and he and he and he
[48:31] brings it into a into a today he brings
[48:34] it into a what Hollywood has even done
[48:37] to the woman and how I believe through
[48:40] that quote that he's actually drawing
[48:43] into the way that that that things are
[48:47] today and why they are is because it's
[48:50] come from a certain element it's come
[48:52] from a certain product and that
[48:54] deception has come into humanity and
[48:57] women are that way and brother bam
[49:00] talked about you want to see how the
[49:02] church is watch the way the women are
[49:03] doing and you see how they're doing and
[49:05] you see that's mostly how the church is
[49:07] going to be I mean you go down and you
[49:09] see the churches or you drive down and
[49:10] watch them in ting out on the Sunday
[49:13] you'll see that's exactly the way they
[49:14] are
[49:15] then the fads and fashions of Hollywood
[49:17] is all over them that's that's their
[49:19] influence but but let's move on and and
[49:23] get and but hold on to that because
[49:25] that's the first part of that that I
[49:26] want to say to understand about Eve to
[49:30] understand about Paul to understand
[49:32] about the willfully ignorant lead
[49:35] through a belief okay so we draw that
[49:37] difference here now again staying an
[49:39] invisible Union because I want to hit
[49:41] this before I get to the quote I want to
[49:44] talk about
[49:45] I want to read this is this is very
[49:47] powerful to me so listen real close you
[49:51] can again go home you can read it now if
[49:53] you got it you want to listen to it
[49:56] later do it though invisible Union again
[50:00] when you are separated from your first
[50:03] Union by spiritual death now you are
[50:06] born again or remarried again to the new
[50:09] spiritual Union not your natural life of
[50:13] the things of the world amen
[50:15] remember we're trying to draw understand
[50:18] the the comparison beget the contrast
[50:20] between words of justification is how it
[50:23] takes place what God holds responsible
[50:26] and not hold responsible Amen now
[50:29] because that's very important reborn
[50:32] again not your natural life of the
[50:35] things of the world but of eternal life
[50:38] that germ that was in you at the
[50:41] beginning found you there's that little
[50:44] spot you might not even see it on the
[50:46] camera but go printout if you want to if
[50:48] you haven't seen it before go printout
[50:50] it on our website they'll print out that
[50:51] proud that Micah did force you see that
[50:54] little seed right there in the middle of
[50:55] the soul that seed was always there
[50:58] again go read it first John chapter
[51:00] three and you know tell you about that
[51:02] seed and how that seed remaineth in
[51:05] there and when that seed is there that
[51:07] person cannot sin you never have sin
[51:11] again that's I said that last week may
[51:14] sound completely radical may not be
[51:16] something that a lot of people would
[51:18] like to hear but friend you never sinned
[51:20] you never did not if you're over here
[51:23] you didn't aren't you're born again
[51:25] filled with the Spirit of God not if
[51:26] you're one of his not if you're
[51:28] righteous and your ought to be condition
[51:29] is you were in the mind of God
[51:31] you never did you never sinned period
[51:33] old like new life never sinned here you
[51:37] do read put yourself but fortunately as
[51:40] life continues on we start sewing all
[51:42] the good seed so what we reap is from
[51:44] the good seed you're not the bad seed
[51:46] amen
[51:47] now that germ praise the Lord that germ
[51:50] that seed that was he knew at the
[51:52] beginning a germ as a seed amen
[51:54] know
[51:54] in the mail the Germans to see it's the
[51:57] life the hemoglobin to blood see I'm
[52:01] saying that because that's important to
[52:02] what we're getting ready to get to as
[52:04] well see but that seed is in there it
[52:07] found you
[52:08] amen it was always there and just come
[52:11] to life just come to life now your old
[52:14] book is gone with your old union
[52:17] remember the book of life we went
[52:18] through the book of life Lamb's Book of
[52:19] Life that old book of your old union and
[52:23] it's gone now your name is then been
[52:26] transferred do you mean to tell me that
[52:29] old book God has put it in his sea of
[52:31] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before
[52:34] God amen now I hear you shouting I know
[52:39] even Dennis's way out on the east side I
[52:41] hear you praise for you never did it you
[52:45] stand perfectly before God now you are
[52:49] not only you're not only forgiven but
[52:52] you are justified glory justified Romans
[52:56] 5:1 says therefore be justified by faith
[52:59] look up the word brother Mountain
[53:01] challenges even other man challenges
[53:04] look up the word the word don't mean
[53:06] forgiven amen we kind of already went to
[53:09] that forgiving remittance justified now
[53:14] he says look the word don't mean
[53:15] forgiven remember what is forgiven me it
[53:18] means that you did it but we're just not
[53:21] going to hold you accountable to it
[53:22] we're not going to punish you or punish
[53:25] you any further for having done it
[53:27] see that's forgiving I forgive you for
[53:30] it like we have the power to forgive
[53:32] those and we should we should forgive
[53:35] those anything if anybody has done
[53:37] against us that forgiveness should be
[53:40] their friend you don't hold you hold on
[53:42] to that bitterness and you don't let it
[53:43] go that unforgiving that bitterness in
[53:46] your heart will destroy you it'll not
[53:50] destroy you just spiritually a little
[53:51] it'll send you to an early grave you got
[53:54] to let that go but now forgiveness now
[53:57] doesn't mean justify the word the word
[54:01] means just but it don't mean you are
[54:03] forgiven for
[54:04] instance you hear that I got drunk and
[54:06] done some evil things and everything
[54:08] then you come around and say to me you
[54:11] found out that I didn't do that
[54:13] that wasn't me then you come and say
[54:15] well brother round I forgive you forgive
[54:18] me I didn't do it in the first place
[54:21] it wasn't me you see that wasn't me
[54:25] never did it that wasn't me that was
[54:27] something that was somebody else that
[54:29] wasn't me cuz I am this germ that's who
[54:32] I am
[54:33] see a man never did it that wasn't me
[54:36] see I saw you do something no it was
[54:38] somebody else and he met some may I
[54:40] looked old I liked me but that wasn't me
[54:42] that wouldn't mean this is me right here
[54:44] and this again that is the owner of the
[54:50] soul which is the nature of the Spirit
[54:52] which is the life of the body so now all
[54:55] your tastes male feel here see all your
[54:58] recent memory conscious affection
[55:00] imagination are all controlled if we
[55:03] allow it is still our choice is still
[55:05] our choice free will free moral agency
[55:09] is controlled by that seed by that light
[55:13] by that spirit amen
[55:15] I love that praise the Lord now you are
[55:18] not only forgiving you stand perfectly
[55:21] before God you are justified now if I
[55:26] did it I am guilty and you could forgive
[55:29] me and I and I would and I wouldn't be
[55:33] guilty but yet I am not justified
[55:35] because I actually did it but the word
[55:38] justified is this though as if though
[55:40] you've never done it I hope we're
[55:43] getting the understanding of that now
[55:44] see it's not even regarded at all how is
[55:48] it done in God's book of the sea of
[55:50] forgetfulness your old book in marriage
[55:53] is divorced and dead and is not even in
[55:55] the memories of God amen you are
[55:58] justified therefore being justified you
[56:01] are accused but you never did it in the
[56:04] first place
[56:05] hallelujah the old union is in the sea
[56:08] of God's forgiveness you weren't married
[56:10] to it
[56:10] in with bridegroom boy shame
[56:13] himself for you in your place he took
[56:16] your place for you were predestined for
[56:19] him to be in his bride before the
[56:21] foundation of the world the Bible said
[56:23] so you are the predestinated seed that
[56:29] germ any man you are that predestinated
[56:33] see Amen I don't know brother Roger if
[56:36] you're watching but this confinements
[56:38] kind of rough on me right now
[56:39] well I'd like to be running back and
[56:41] forth I am feeling pretty good now
[56:45] did you now how did you come to this you
[56:49] were deceived into it by your first
[56:51] marriage to your adulterous parent even
[56:54] is not any fault of your own by your
[56:58] natural birth you come after eat who
[57:00] committed adultery that is the reason
[57:02] you are born an adulteress you were a
[57:05] sinner to begin with that is right you
[57:07] were deceived into it you had no it
[57:10] isn't your fault
[57:11] you never did it because that little
[57:13] germ that was in you was to be you
[57:17] before the foundation of the world when
[57:20] God put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[57:22] Life that is who you are that seed is
[57:26] who you really are that's where God sees
[57:29] you that's where God places you in his
[57:33] mind that perfect place praise the Lord
[57:36] Amen thank you Lord how we can stand
[57:40] perfect before God other people see our
[57:43] faults and mistakes I see my faults and
[57:45] mistakes
[57:46] my wife sure sees them she probably sees
[57:48] more than I do but that's not me Amen
[57:52] that's not me
[57:53] not if you're born again amen but again
[57:56] as that as that spirit has control that
[57:59] is a gift pit doesn't give a person the
[58:01] license to just sin and live any way
[58:04] they want the grace doesn't give a man
[58:06] to the
[58:07] The Amazing Grace doesn't give the man
[58:10] the right to just live anyhow he wants
[58:12] that Amazing Grace comes in to us that
[58:15] we don't make a disgrace out of it
[58:17] because we allow him to move into our
[58:20] spirit into our body and let that let
[58:23] that manifestation that evidence show
[58:27] itself in our lives that we are the
[58:29] children of God it's not it's not much
[58:32] of a manifestation print if it doesn't
[58:35] show through us who he is in us it's not
[58:39] much of a manifestation is only a
[58:41] manifestation if we're living according
[58:43] to his word if we're lit only living
[58:47] according to his ordinances to be
[58:48] obedient to him amen now let's get to
[58:51] this as I'm going to close after this
[58:56] quote brother Branham mates in this same
[58:58] message invisible Union he may be very
[59:02] familiar to some of you maybe not at all
[59:04] to others of you but I'm gonna read it
[59:06] for the beginning of the message again
[59:09] invisible Union this is October 25th
[59:12] 1965 listen close a woman isn't trusted
[59:18] with certain characters that she must
[59:21] not defile a woman is trusted to that
[59:26] there's not a creature on the earth like
[59:28] a woman and that is true there's not
[59:33] Solomon said a good one's a crown his
[59:36] jewel and his crowning of bad ones water
[59:40] in his blood and Solomon should know
[59:42] because that he had some bad ones
[59:44] there is no female dog there's no female
[59:47] of any kind entrusted with a character
[59:50] that a woman is now once you understand
[59:54] what a character is now a person has a
[59:57] character that is a part of their nature
[59:59] it's a part of their spirit I should say
[1:00:02] it's their upbringing and your
[1:00:04] characters molded in your spirit of the
[1:00:07] things you heard or the things you saw
[1:00:09] or the things that were part of your
[1:00:11] life that shaped you when you were young
[1:00:13] shaped you in your spirit and and and
[1:00:16] all that has an effect through your
[1:00:18] whole life that
[1:00:19] chase you into the character person that
[1:00:21] you are today my son can play the piano
[1:00:25] like there's no tomorrow I don't think I
[1:00:28] could play chopsticks my daughter could
[1:00:32] there's things my wife could paint and
[1:00:36] draw that just is part of her nature
[1:00:39] part of her character you see my
[1:00:43] drawings my drawings become letters
[1:00:46] that's a hunting trip on I can't draw a
[1:00:48] dove keep draw snake of snakes how can a
[1:00:51] person not draw a snake but that's not
[1:00:52] my character I've just that's not
[1:00:55] something I can do but I don't know you
[1:00:57] know how many people have the character
[1:01:00] to stand up the past hour do what I've
[1:01:03] been doing it is just God makes us all
[1:01:05] different for different reasons so that
[1:01:08] that brings about a person's character
[1:01:10] but this character brother Graham is
[1:01:13] talking about we're going to keep
[1:01:15] reading it so they'll become more
[1:01:17] enlightened to you but this character is
[1:01:20] not because because our character that I
[1:01:24] just discussed is our individual
[1:01:26] character we each one have our own
[1:01:29] character or characteristics this
[1:01:32] brother branham is placing on the entire
[1:01:34] female population understand human
[1:01:37] population the entire female human
[1:01:40] population is entrusted with a character
[1:01:45] so that brings us to the second
[1:01:47] definition of what a character is a
[1:01:49] character is also a physical part of
[1:01:53] your being like my mind my finger is is
[1:02:00] is of a certain character this mole I
[1:02:04] have is a little dot it's a certain
[1:02:07] character that I have but not everybody
[1:02:10] has that in fact probably nobody else
[1:02:12] has it at least not exactly like I do
[1:02:14] where I have it but that is a character
[1:02:16] of mine police work use characters all
[1:02:20] the time scar or birthmark or tattoo or
[1:02:24] something they use as a character in in
[1:02:27] if they get a picture or someone sees
[1:02:31] a crime and they look at that person
[1:02:33] they say well you had a tattoo that
[1:02:34] looks like this or he had a big scar on
[1:02:36] his face or something like that that's a
[1:02:38] character that that is a part of that
[1:02:41] person is a physical element that's on
[1:02:45] the outside and when you talk about a
[1:02:48] specific character that brother branham
[1:02:50] is mentioning that the entire one entire
[1:02:54] gender of the human race has this
[1:02:56] character that that woman is entrusted
[1:03:01] with okay so we're all adults I hope we
[1:03:06] make it a little deeper I don't want to
[1:03:08] get too specific but maybe we understand
[1:03:12] what we're talking about the character
[1:03:14] that every woman every female human as
[1:03:17] was born with a woman was not even in
[1:03:21] the beginning of creation because God
[1:03:23] knew that she would fall all other
[1:03:25] females see God knew God knew she would
[1:03:28] fall but the woman did not do it
[1:03:30] willfully okay all other females could
[1:03:33] not commit adultery she is the only one
[1:03:36] that can commit adultery if she had been
[1:03:39] like the original that would have been
[1:03:41] discomfiting to God's great wisdom see
[1:03:43] she was made a byproduct of the man but
[1:03:45] because she was cast over in that side
[1:03:48] she has also been given a sacred
[1:03:51] listening she has this character and she
[1:03:56] has also so this is in addition that
[1:03:59] brother Graham's making she has also
[1:04:01] been given a sacred charge from God for
[1:04:06] Redemption think about that a sacred
[1:04:11] charge of God was given to them when you
[1:04:15] get to understand that's just powerful
[1:04:17] that people want to say I'm a woman
[1:04:19] can't do this woman can't do this can't
[1:04:21] have a gift can't prophesy whatever look
[1:04:24] friends look at what look how God felt
[1:04:27] about the helpmate that he gave to Adam
[1:04:30] the helpmate that he gives each of us
[1:04:32] the the the female race the the gender
[1:04:37] of our race look she's been given a
[1:04:41] sacred
[1:04:42] from God for reduction now we already
[1:04:45] talked about what we're doing she was
[1:04:46] right it was a bring from one place to
[1:04:50] the next this woman from the beginning
[1:04:54] of Eve she was the mother of all living
[1:04:56] from the beginning and Eve was given by
[1:05:00] God from the beginning of creation and I
[1:05:03] remember she was a byproduct cuz he knew
[1:05:05] she would fall he knew she would fall so
[1:05:07] he'd give her that character and he
[1:05:10] entrusted her with that sacred charge
[1:05:13] for redemption what is that of bringing
[1:05:17] life into the world do you think about
[1:05:21] that breaking like the woman God
[1:05:24] entrusted the woman that's powerful with
[1:05:27] the ability the only one that could
[1:05:30] bring life into this world
[1:05:32] that's incredible God entrusted it with
[1:05:35] a woman
[1:05:36] Lorna's life come from life comes from
[1:05:38] God he said what the blood comes from
[1:05:40] the mouth the hemoglobin she has that
[1:05:42] yeah but she's the one that brings that
[1:05:44] male force she's the one that holds that
[1:05:46] baby under her heart for nine months
[1:05:48] she's the one that's entrusted to bring
[1:05:50] that life forth into the world yeah the
[1:05:53] Bible says it was with Genesis and the
[1:05:56] curse and you know what I'm talking
[1:05:57] about and in I forgot the exact words
[1:06:01] but you know what he talks about the
[1:06:03] curse the Garden of Eden she'll suffer
[1:06:06] in all of bringing forth life but she's
[1:06:08] entrusted with that life with life youth
[1:06:13] with why friend think about it life I
[1:06:16] mean that's what this whole thing is
[1:06:18] bound I mean in this same message by the
[1:06:21] man I'm talking to talked about how it
[1:06:22] may actually be am I writing here in the
[1:06:24] might thing you said life is sacred to
[1:06:28] God every life is sacred to God and is
[1:06:31] written in a book my and the woman is
[1:06:34] entrusted with that so she's given that
[1:06:37] character and she's entrusted with the
[1:06:41] sacred charge of redemption that
[1:06:44] redemption to bring humanity back to the
[1:06:48] place that it was hey that's what we're
[1:06:52] all going to people fussing fight about
[1:06:54] going back to Pentecost
[1:06:55] not worry about going back to Pentecost
[1:06:57] I want to go back to the Garden of Eden
[1:06:58] I want to go back to that place was
[1:07:00] perfect I want to make it to that
[1:07:02] pyramid-shaped mountain that's that new
[1:07:04] city Jerusalem that we're looking for
[1:07:06] though everything every wrong is made
[1:07:08] right all the life has brought together
[1:07:11] that full place of redemption what she's
[1:07:14] given that charge it's a beautiful thing
[1:07:18] to me she has got characters though
[1:07:21] listen now that she must not defy her
[1:07:23] she must not defile I was going to read
[1:07:27] this a character of Mark the definition
[1:07:29] the character is a mark brand or stamp a
[1:07:32] sign placed on an object amen now it
[1:07:37] can't be her virginity pardon me I'm
[1:07:40] getting language but it couldn't be that
[1:07:42] because that also applies to the male
[1:07:44] this is only for the female only for the
[1:07:47] woman see so it can't be that it's got
[1:07:49] to be a physical mark a physical stamp
[1:07:52] that you must not defile if she would
[1:07:56] Mar or do physical injury not this not
[1:08:00] spiritual amen this has nothing to do
[1:08:02] with the soul or spirit this is a
[1:08:04] physical marring this is a physical
[1:08:06] injury if she were to Mar them she is
[1:08:10] defiled what for lifetime for lifetime
[1:08:16] in this life so this line has got to be
[1:08:20] something physical because it's only
[1:08:23] lasting for this lifetime amen
[1:08:27] she's defiled for a lifetime no matter
[1:08:29] how much she is forgiven she can't be
[1:08:32] justified there's the quote a lot of
[1:08:35] people so many people just take that she
[1:08:38] can be forgiven but not justified and
[1:08:41] they'll just go to seat on it and say
[1:08:43] see there the woman can't be justified
[1:08:45] that would be absolutely contrary to
[1:08:49] God's Bible and this message to think
[1:08:54] that if a woman made a mistake like that
[1:08:55] and unknowingly doing it I mean what was
[1:08:59] Jesus doing with the woman caught the
[1:09:01] act of adultery then and said neither do
[1:09:02] i condemn you what is he doing if this
[1:09:04] holds true to what a lot of people
[1:09:06] believe why would Jesus
[1:09:07] and tell that woman that I don't
[1:09:10] continue just don't go don't go do it
[1:09:12] again
[1:09:12] what's her character defiled yes it was
[1:09:15] was it marred beyond replacing yes now
[1:09:19] I've heard people they talk about the
[1:09:21] doctor can do a physical operation or
[1:09:23] something and make it back the way it
[1:09:25] was no that's not what he's talking
[1:09:27] about
[1:09:27] amen once that seal is broken it's
[1:09:30] broken and he's broken for life for life
[1:09:34] it will never go back to the place that
[1:09:36] it was it can't if his broken is broken
[1:09:39] for lifetime no matter what she does she
[1:09:43] can be forgiven because of the act that
[1:09:46] she did but not justified how can she
[1:09:48] not be justified not in here but in this
[1:09:52] body not in the spirit not in the soul
[1:09:55] in the body because it's a lifetime who
[1:09:59] what is the one thing that does not
[1:10:01] exist beyond this lifetime this body
[1:10:05] that's the one thing that does not last
[1:10:08] beyond a lifetime well of course she
[1:10:12] can't be justified she can't ever go
[1:10:15] back and physically make that right it's
[1:10:19] not possible I don't care what doctors
[1:10:21] can do operations I'm not worried about
[1:10:22] I'm talking about what he's talking
[1:10:24] about
[1:10:25] once that seal is broke is broke and
[1:10:28] that's what he's talking about he's not
[1:10:30] talking about a woman not being able to
[1:10:32] be justified he's not talking about a
[1:10:34] woman not being able to go back or be
[1:10:36] kids born out of wedlock or anything
[1:10:39] that's not what he's talking about all
[1:10:42] that justification is still there free
[1:10:44] and clear for anybody who accepts it and
[1:10:47] wants it anybody who's made that mistake
[1:10:51] can go back and make it right any God's
[1:10:54] eyes they never did it no they can't be
[1:10:58] justified in this body absolutely not
[1:11:00] remember you reap what you sow there's
[1:11:04] always going to be the repercussions no
[1:11:06] matter who you are to reap what you sow
[1:11:09] that sowing was done in the body there's
[1:11:13] no way to justify that no way physically
[1:11:16] for her to go back
[1:11:19] other brands are talking about he's not
[1:11:21] talking about a woman not being able to
[1:11:24] be justified in the eyes of God as
[1:11:26] completely this complementary to
[1:11:29] everything that we know of God in his
[1:11:31] Bible in God's message it's everything
[1:11:33] against it so what's he talking about
[1:11:36] he's talking about that physical
[1:11:38] character that a woman is entrusted with
[1:11:41] him when that seals broke it's broke
[1:11:43] it's broke for lifetime she cannot go
[1:11:46] back justified it can't be fixed it's
[1:11:51] always that way she can be forgiven for
[1:11:53] her defilement that she cannot be
[1:11:55] justified that's a physical thing it has
[1:11:59] nothing to do with God's justifying of
[1:12:01] the person in their life in their heart
[1:12:04] and their soul because even was that act
[1:12:07] was taking place that scene was still
[1:12:10] there you can't tell me that scene is
[1:12:13] there that even though they'd done
[1:12:15] something wrong in their body or strung
[1:12:18] themselves out on drugs or whatever it
[1:12:20] is this defilement is no different than
[1:12:22] that has the difference in the sacred
[1:12:26] trust that God give but it has nothing
[1:12:28] to do with the justification Amen
[1:12:31] nothing to do with the justification a
[1:12:33] woman can be just as justified in that
[1:12:35] situation as anybody but she can't go
[1:12:38] physically back and be justified in her
[1:12:41] flesh for that specific thing that
[1:12:44] specific character once it's marred once
[1:12:48] that physical injury has been done or
[1:12:50] that that character has been marred it
[1:12:53] cannot go back listen I hope that makes
[1:12:57] sense
[1:12:59] she cannot be justified where I'm
[1:13:02] reading again now she cannot be
[1:13:05] justified in this life in this life
[1:13:10] physical I think I made that point clear
[1:13:12] so I'm gonna move on she cannot be
[1:13:15] justified in this life it is always with
[1:13:19] her okay so I hope that makes it
[1:13:22] abundantly clear what we're talking
[1:13:24] about there's big question on that a man
[1:13:28] has
[1:13:28] nothing to do with God looking at you in
[1:13:30] your ought to be conditioned as being
[1:13:32] justified amen
[1:13:35] yeah your body's still the same it's
[1:13:36] like I said the other day I've got a
[1:13:39] I've got a cut right here I got when I
[1:13:43] was working at leaner stuff across the
[1:13:44] street over here with a knife I cut and
[1:13:47] sliced my hand right there and Gallus
[1:13:49] into my pink ear and the scarves are
[1:13:50] still there
[1:13:51] you know what those cars I'll never be
[1:13:54] justified in this lifetime of those
[1:13:56] scars never they'll always be there I'll
[1:13:59] always be able to see them I'll always
[1:14:01] know they're there I've got other parts
[1:14:03] that have had scars like that never it
[1:14:06] will never be justified until the body
[1:14:08] change it'll never be justified it'll
[1:14:10] always be like that amen now if I did it
[1:14:13] against somebody I could be forgiven I
[1:14:15] forgive myself I guess for being stupid
[1:14:18] but that's what costs the cut but I can
[1:14:21] never be justified in this life it'll
[1:14:23] always be that way amen
[1:14:26] now her body is given to her a sacred
[1:14:30] trust from God no female dog and a bird
[1:14:33] no animal no with a creature like that
[1:14:34] she is the only one by this is the
[1:14:37] reason it is sacred is she is to bring
[1:14:41] forth life into the earth her body is a
[1:14:45] bedding grounds of life therefore that
[1:14:48] is the reason that she has given that
[1:14:51] sacred trust praise the Lord
[1:14:53] think about that how beautiful that is
[1:14:55] it's it's it just to me it that
[1:15:02] entrustment that God gave whatever
[1:15:05] people want to say and think about it
[1:15:06] that that God gives for that
[1:15:09] justification for for that entrustment
[1:15:13] that he gave to be able to be justified
[1:15:17] to bring life into the world it is
[1:15:20] incredible it's no wonder it's the way
[1:15:23] it is now again I hope that float makes
[1:15:25] more sense in this life
[1:15:28] it can't be justified in this life it's
[1:15:30] always with her this can't be justified
[1:15:33] it's always with me always gonna miss
[1:15:36] gonna be a reminder over on them it's
[1:15:38] going to be a reminder of how how
[1:15:41] you don't try to separate two pieces of
[1:15:43] chicken frozen together with a butcher
[1:15:45] knife between your hand don't do it
[1:15:48] and it's reminder I'll never do that
[1:15:50] again
[1:15:51] but it's always with me can never leave
[1:15:55] it's always with her it can never leave
[1:15:57] but in here she's justified she never
[1:16:01] did it
[1:16:01] praise the Lord she never did it now we
[1:16:04] know this is Palm Sunday we know next
[1:16:06] week next sunday is Easter Sunday
[1:16:08] doesn't look like and that concludes
[1:16:11] what I wanted to talk today and it it
[1:16:14] doesn't look like we're gonna be able to
[1:16:15] have a regular Sunday service I don't
[1:16:18] know people doing for sunrise services
[1:16:20] or whatever but Lord willing I guess
[1:16:22] we'll just if nothing changes between
[1:16:24] now and next Sunday we'll try to do this
[1:16:26] again and I had something from this that
[1:16:30] that I wanted to lead into an Easter
[1:16:34] message and pray it be a blessing but
[1:16:36] that that that Easter part that I wanted
[1:16:40] to talk about there's a couple of I
[1:16:42] think valuable little nuggets in there
[1:16:44] that so that I trust to be a blessing to
[1:16:47] you but anyway just remember keep that
[1:16:50] into mind that and then that's why I
[1:16:52] tried to explain earlier the difference
[1:16:54] of the body and the soul and the
[1:16:56] justification the part that God looks
[1:16:58] that part that God cares about the the
[1:17:02] part that God's most concerned with amen
[1:17:04] and and realize if you read that quote
[1:17:07] or somebody tries to bring you that
[1:17:09] quote to think that a woman cannot be
[1:17:12] justified is absolutely irresponsible
[1:17:16] scripturally it's in her lifetime that
[1:17:21] physical mark amen so I hope that made
[1:17:24] sense and I hope it was a blessing to
[1:17:26] you today there's so much more actually
[1:17:29] to justification but
[1:17:31] don't have time to go into it but we'll
[1:17:33] go ahead and close the service today
[1:17:35] like I said next week I want to talk
[1:17:37] about a little bit more but we'll talk
[1:17:40] about you have an Easter message and
[1:17:42] we'll see if the Lord goes from there
[1:17:44] and see where this coronavirus takes us
[1:17:47] and what happens friends but God is in
[1:17:51] control amen and we trust him and fatica
[1:17:53] ly for everything and believe that
[1:17:55] everything's working together for our
[1:17:57] good I miss you all love you so very
[1:18:00] much appreciate you amen
[1:18:03] Sonja's been able to go out and visit a
[1:18:05] couple of you be there but if we can do
[1:18:08] anything to help here be there for you
[1:18:10] in any way you let us know goes
[1:18:11] pastoring it and just standing up here
[1:18:13] preaching on Sunday friend it's a

[1:18:23] that we were here for you so if you need
[1:18:25] anything let us know we'll be praying
