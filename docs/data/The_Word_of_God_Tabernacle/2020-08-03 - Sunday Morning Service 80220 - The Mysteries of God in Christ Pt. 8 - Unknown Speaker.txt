TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone god bless you again today welcome to our home stream again it's kind of hoping to be in our uh new building today but unfortunately it didn't work out for us to be able to do that a little for an unforeseen complications we weren't expecting uh but we're so thankful the lord still provides this way of being able to try to feed the flock so that's the been my whole point and goal and um thankful that the lord provided to be able to do that um we're going to be a little bit longer on the church building uh i'll update you at the end of the service today but a couple announcements i want to make regarding that but i'm very thankful that the lord's blessed us with another beautiful day the time to get together and trust that you're there hope that you're there uh watching live you know it makes a big difference when you're watching live and we're kind of here at the same time together and i'm here and you're there and are all watching and kind of together in unity that way so uh it's good that you can archive and that that's good too but it's it's really different when we're all together and we're watching at the same time so i pray that you are watching and be a part of this today and certainly welcome you to our home and thank you for being a part of this today uh we want to go to the lord in prayer open this service prayer today and take a couple of prayer requests to the lord if you have anything on your heart of course you know it may be something unspoken just between you and the lord but we believe as we uphold one another in prayer continually that god answers hears and answers our prayer but a few requests want to mention audibly today we want to continue to remember brother donnie's uh daughter in prayer the lord would just continue to touch her i haven't heard any updates or anything as far as the cancer there but please remember continue to remember her in prayer also continuing member leah and prayer brother dennis's wife again working at the doctor's office there with the covet going on also to remember sister sheila's brother harlan in prayer uh lord would just have his way in and uh harlan's life and that god would have his hand upon him and also we want to can we want to remember today the maria family uh brother joel and joel senior joel jr uh crystal and isabel they all have come down with cobit and joel is a pretty serious condition right now in the hospital uh i even found out this morning that they put him in a coma uh to help his body rest and heal so and joel jr also had it and had come down with pneumonia he has gone home now uh so that's good thing uh but they kind of if they feel like they're going to they're on the road to recovery they send them home for the bed uh the bed availability uh so he still joel jr would still have a road ahead of him just continue to remember he's younger stronger of course but remember that family in prayer crystal of course going through uh quite the turmoil uh if i remember right isabelle has it but not showing any symptoms uh just kind of strange how this thing does you know but um it's all in the lord's hands uh god has his hand on it and it's up to him and it's according to his perfect will uh you know friend we uh sometimes we pray that you know the lord would just take this covet thing away and of course you know we kind of felt that way with so many of these things that came along and uh ebola and sars and aids and all these things is good god take it away but you know in a lot of ways i don't i don't think that's uh there's a purpose to that it kind of goes back to the message i'm sorry to prolong this but it kind of goes back to that message talked about where the children of israel uh had um had uh um you know spoke against god against moses and god sent fiery serpents and killed many of them uh when god gave them a way of deliverance he didn't take away the fiery serpents the fiery serpent stayed there he just gave them an atonement you just gave them a way of escape honestly my opinion i'm no doctor or i didn't get this spiritually inspired this is just how i feel this is probably going to be something that comes uh like the cold flu that's just going to be in humanity probably till the end um you know they'll probably come out with some kind of vaccine or something whatever they're doing but it'll probably be eventually in my opinion probably eventually everybody will get it at some point in time um but god is our protector god watches after us god keeps us and i'm so thankful that he does and even when different ones that we love and know get into situations like this we know that god's hand is on it and we just pray for him and just trust and believe god's going to continue to have his way and it'll manifest whatever his desire is it for it to be so but let's just again continue to remember the muriel family in prayer at uh god's hand would be upon them and uh all the prayer requests that we've had the needs we're all uh very of blessed people today we're thankful that god blesses us you know our church has been uh so little touched by this thing uh you know people have had their jobs and even gotten busier and uh you know the uh zach had it there for a little bit but very little symptoms and got over it quick and went back to work and it's just god's just really blessed us and i'm so thankful that he has uh god's hand is upon us and i appreciate the lord jesus so much through this trying time so i just pray the lord bless you if you have any other requests of course again you just keep it on your heart now as we go to the lord in prayer for these needs precious jesus father we love you and we thank you today we give you praise honor and glory lord knowing

the things that you've given and entrust us lord with with the work that you have for these last days lord we don't know how many more days we have lord we do certainly feel like the time is drawing

we just remember these other requests before you and trust lord that your hand is upon it take control the remaining part of this message now lord as i committed to you and for your people in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you now i want to turn in our bibles uh i want to turn our bibles now and go back again we're going to uh go with part eight of uh the mysteries of god in christ part eight and god revealing himself to his people part four i told you last week i was hoping to try to finish this section of it last week and uh just wasn't able to with just a lot of things in there and again i don't want to rush and i want to jam things in there and you know we have time and uh we're in the position to be able to do what the lord puts on our hearts so just trust it's a blessing to you today so we're going to try again to finish this part up um uh so we can get to the next part so uh which is uh god having his preeminence and his people but now god revealing himself to his people part four let's start with revelation chapter 10 verse 7 as we normally do here in the scripture but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen then we of course gone through and understand that that mystery and what that mystery is that mystery is christ in christ is all the mysteries that we know that's been hid from ages and generations in the scripture god condensating himself bringing himself down so we read genesis 1 uh in through the scripture and uh john and uh we're going to read some more scripture but i want to go back to melchizedek today of course we found out how you know and there's way more times obviously referenced christ in genesis but we just pulled out a few of them uh to try to bring reference to that to see that even god even then was was showing himself what he was going to do and and as god reveals himself and shows us in his word what he's doing it helps us it gives us comfort and know that that the lord is taking care of that and helping bringing if he's in his mind way back then friend can't you think that he's it's you're on his mind now and that what he's doing and the redemption plan is is for us and the process that we play in it you know it's going to bring us into perfect view this next few services or god having his preeminence and his people that that begins to bring into light exactly who this bride is the the job that she has to do with the and the part that she has to play in all this friend we don't become christians and just sit on the sea to do nothing this is the part that we play that god's put in our lives he's done all this for a reason and for a purpose and we are to fulfill and finish up that purpose i say finish up because we're at the rapture time we're not the beginning of this we're in the middle of this we're at the end of this and so but we're just bringing him down looking at the scripture through here and and just a few points few of the highlights so many more things and i think the lord shows me different ones i think and and here brother brown say different ones i think lord if i keep bringing all these others out this is gonna go on for weeks uh so we're just we're just gonna get this couple things and again hopefully finish this today but we're gonna go back to melchizedek and and look at this and god manifesting himself in theophany form here back to um hebrews chapter six we're going to begin reading with verse 20 again and uh and just hit these highlights here of melchizedek again before we go forward on hopefully uh lord william won't be quite as long as last week but just however the lord leads so again i just trust it'd be a blessing to you hebrews chapter six hope you got your bibles there with us right now hebrews chapter 6 verse 20 as we read together uh whether whether the forerunner is for us entered uh that is to say he has the forerunner has entered for us on our behalf even jesus who entered in who so the forerunner is entered in for us even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek now melchizedek we know uh it's strange because melchizedek and it's even spelled different in the old testament but melchizedek is not mentioned but one place in the bible from genesis to hebrews only david mentions in one time i think it's psalms 110 he david mentions melchizedek but it's not even mentioned in the bible until we get to the hebrews till we get to the hebrew series of paul breaking this down going so far back into hebrews to to describe and to talk about jesus christ to bring from the old testament and and those jews from the torah to relevate that back to where it was at the current time so you see what he's doing pulling in way back even from genesis 14 is the first place that we find melchizedek over to that current standing that they were in at that time and paul is trying to bring this out to see even this melchizedek jesus christ was after that order going all the way back that far so this this great individual that's spoken of uh with these great attributes that we're going to read again of melchizedek has spoken of so few times in the scripture but there's a reason for that see is to catch the visions you got you got to catch that revelation see here but if we go back to uh genesis chapter 14 which i will in a minute we'll see that's where melchizedek is picked up in the scripture but now goes all the way through except for the one time and david said in in the psalms all the way to hebrews chapter six now or hebrews i think he mentions him in chapter five too uh if i remember right but anyway hebrews the hebrew series uh that he brings this this melchizedek back up well what's he doing that for you to help us understand that he's bringing god jesus christ the reference and knowledge jesus christ god revealing himself back from then genesis 14 into this current day and what we're doing here what brother branham did 50 60 years ago what we're doing here is to bring him up again update see we're not serving a god of history he is a god of history but we're not serving a god of history we're serving a living god we're serving a current present now living resurrected savior who's alive in you revealing himself to his people yet today see so as paul did that brother bannon did it and down through the scripture bringing us into this day right now today so that we see who he is for this day now of course i encourage you to go back because it won't be i won't dig into it as much as brother branham did but did but uh go back and listen to who is this melchizedek and that'll even help you more but now let's go on jesus christ made in high priest after the order of melchizedek after the order of melchizedek we'll go back to in just a minute for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all now again remember and look at these parts that is very specific about melchizedek that is bringing out the the adjectives the descriptions uh that that paul gives under inspiration is in his holy writ today of who melchizedek was and it says the priest the most high god now if you if you go to um even theologians and doc bible scholars and doctors of divinity uh still don't know and you'll never know without revelation whom elk hezek was or he came from or he went to what happened between genesis 14 and hebrews uh what is this order how does this come about they they just don't know they think it may be a priesthood i think that was scofield if you read schofield notes they think it was just a priesthood a priesthood that of course if it's a priesthood it didn't have a father or mother but see this said it didn't even have a beginning melchizedek didn't have a beginning well if it's if it's an order of a priesthood it had to happen i hadn't have a beginning because again remember the only thing we know we know by revelation the only one that does not have a beginning and does not have an end is god period god is the elohim eternal almighty god he's the only one that is eternal no beginning no ending no father no mother see so the description really helps us to understand who this is and we can go and take this back to isaiah 9 as we did when when jesus was prophesied to come forth the most perfect sacrifice that was to come forth see it's these uh these descriptions king of sam priest the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings blessed him to whom also abraham gave the tenth part of all now god's prophet god's servant god's son is not going to give a tenth part of the tithing of the spoils to just anybody because he knows that's god's money see by revelation see everything he did bring it through types and shadows for us to see today first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now if you don't have the godhead correctly if you think there's three gods if you believe in some trinity out there that jesus is the second person of the godhead or something and then you're never going to be able to understand and get the revelation of who melchizedek was and fit this into that because if you can't do that then then it doesn't fit because melchizedek is being brought in and jesus described as the self-same person the self-same order together see if you if you if you don't see this by revelation the godhead then then then none of it can become clear to you so hopefully certainly that makes sense because it says he's without father without mother without descent either having beginning of days or end of life he's eternal it wasn't beginning wasn't ending well there's only one he could be talking about everything else has been created everything else has come forth only that that's issued from the eternal one as in eternity is can be considered or as is eternal see never had a beginning and never had anything it's just like us i had a beginning i had an ending or we'll have an ending see but in but that part of me who i am and god never had a beginning because that thought of that attribute who god is that he placed in me the real person that i am the real person that you are that part of god is in you is eternal the only part of you that could be eternal that's why the bible says from dust you are the dust you'll return see there's a beginning to that there'll be an end to that but of god and of that life of that attribute there was no beginning there can be no end that's the only reason the only way we can have eternal life is because it's his life it's the only thing that's eternally it's not our life that's eternal it's his life that's eternal and we are who we are just simply because we're attributes of him praise the lord thou father mother see uh uh abideth the priest continually like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now consider how great this man was now it's like i said last week now if you didn't catch this uh remember again i'll reiterate if you look and you see italicized words or blocked off words in your bible different bibles do it different ways i had the old scofield uh king james version it's highlighted or italicized i should say if it's italicized that's not a word in the original transcript it is added to for the flow of the reader it's it's for the reader to be able to read it it flows better when they add these certain words in there and this is one of those words that's added because that and it just when i was studying this the other day it really struck me as the as the way scofield put this now consider how great this man was he tries to make melchizedek a past tense but he's not a past tense he is a present tense he is a perpetual continual existence so if you take the was out it says now consider how great this man praise the lord that just means he's self-existing he's self-uh uh uh uh existing he he never began never ends perpetual always existed how great this man period praise the lord unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils and verily that there are the sons of levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take ties to people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them uh from them received ties of abraham blessed him that had promised and without all contradiction the lest is better uh blessed the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness that he liveth and as i say as i may so say levi also who received tithes paid tithes in abraham for he was yet in the launch of his father whom uh when he met melchi when milk has ignored him now that of course um don't want to get into a tight teaching but to help you understand that ministry pays ties to receive tithes pay times same thing but now let's go back to this melchizedek let's catch him here in the first reading that we have in genesis 14. let's try to catch melchizedek and see if we can't find a couple of things here that coincide with it that help us help us understand who who he is this spirit remember we've already gotten in to the logos that spirit of god that come out and and came into word form uh a fiat form um look at this now um genesis 14 verse 18 and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and this is after the slaughter of the kings the king of sodom had just met him after this after the slaughter after the victorious son abraham come and rescued his nephew lot out of being captured uh abraham goes and rescues him and after his the victorious son comes forth abraham he comes forth melchizedek meets him as he comes forth after after being victorious and winning the battle praise the lord after abraham has met the enemy and won the battle melchizedek meets him and brings him bread and wine king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god now why would melchizedek bring abraham now remember abraham just fought a battle abraham just came forth victorious and melchizedek comes out and meets the victorious abraham with bread and wine it was a celebratory thing to celebrate and prefigure the the communion that we have today god melchizedek that spirit making himself known in a victorious way with abraham by giving of himself the bread and wine which is the typical ceremonial service that we hold today remember uh one of the ordinances divine ordinances that god left to us was the communion the the bread and wine melchizedek comes and meets abraham with this celebratory communion with this celebratory ordinance that we see here he shows him which just helps us now we can just take a minute on this communion because first of all the communion is ordinance to us to take and jesus tells us that it's in the bible it means how many places it tells us and brother branham tells us is one of the ordinances left for us to partake of and that's what we do and lord willing we get back in our building it's going to be one of the first things we do by the grace of god let's have communion foot washed again but this this is this is something that's ordered of god to his children and what it does is it helps us finalize see in the scripture how that god's children are in a battle and we wrestle it out every day every day of our lives now the real communion is the fellowship that we have with god that's our real community and that's a daily thing that we do but the lord's supper we take is a ceremonial uh representation of the sacrifice the true sacrifice which was jesus christ amen as jesus christ came from melchizedek and a word body into a physical body that victorious wrestling that we do every day helps us in light of having that communion and fellowship with the lord that's what our communion is about we have we wrestle it out we fight every day demons devils spirits every day in this world in this life and and sometimes more adversely than others but we're always in a battle every day and we as god's children and with his help come out victorious every day every day even though it may not look like it we come forth victorious every day wrestle it out and come in communion fellowship with the lord jesus that's what we have that ceremony that time that fellowship melchizedek came forth and met him personally amen god used to come down with abra with adam in the cool of the day amen of course adam didn't have the wrestle that we have till after the fall but he come down and fellowship with him in the cool of the day but after abraham come forth as a victorious son god met him there and brought the bread and wine for them to fellowship together it was a ceremonial thing and look at this where they had the communion was right on the literal grounds of where the new jerusalem is going to be set up right in the same spot with that that pyramid shaped mountain is going to come forth in the new city holy the holy city the new jerusalem is going to come down on adorned as a bride for her husband is going to be right there on the exact spot where melchizedek may met abraham the victorious son to have fellowship to have communion together oh just think about when we reach that city friend oh the battle is going to be over then it's going to be the supreme uh ceremonial fellowship and and celebratory time to come together the wedding supper is going to be great the millennium's going to be great but ma'am the saints when we get to that place it's it's going to be the finalization of the perfect place that god is set up for his children oh my oh god we can look forward to that time frame but god's telling us about that here in genesis 14 god met his son abraham to have communion together to have fellowship together he brought the bread and wine giving of himself helping him see and it's the son of god i'm sure he didn't see it all but he saw a part of it like we see today that we can realize the perfect sacrifice jesus christ was going to come for amen because melchizedek came forth here as we say uh in a in a theophany in a spoken word body in a in a word body amen that was what that was and you can think of all the forms that that god has made himself in and we could go from here and you can see over in genesis 18 where he takes uh with just a couple of angels with him and say michael and gabriel with him and the three of them come down and meet abraham again and abraham knows exactly who he is because he goes right to him and says my lord he knew exactly who he was what do you think that was it's the one he just met here in genesis 14 after you come forth from the sword of the kings it's the same one god speaking himself something to step into so he could go and present himself before his son abraham same one that meant moses well he was in the burning bush to start with but then moses wanted to see him so bad god went by his head hit him in the cliff rock hid moses face so he could walk by and all he saw was behind the part of the man well who was that i mean joe saw him in the whirlwind uh uh the children of israel cloud by day if hillary fire by night uh we talked about last week how saul saw the cloud and and the clouds spoke and he said who are you lord just like abraham said abraham when the three of them come he said my lord when the when the clouds spoke to saul he said my lord he said who are you he said i'm jesus praise the lord oh friend how can we not see how perfect continuity the word the word flows together it's the same god and god can come at any place at any time oh people grapple and they fight and fuss about the cloud and all this praying god can do whatever he wants so while the time has to be here and i had to be at that place and had to do this and no i didn't god can make it however he wants to make it he can go anywhere anytime do anything anywhere he wants to do at any time and he's not going to consult you about it because he's going to do what he wants to do because he's god he knows exactly what when and how to do it and who am i to question him that's god's decision god can do it however he wants to it's his choice amen and he can come in any form he wants to god spoke through a donkey one time god spoke through a bush one time god speaks out of clouds he can do it any way he wants saints how many more times places times things you can find ezekiel looked up and saw him as a wheel in the middle of a wheel jesus christ and all the spokes coming off of off of him that one the supreme one oh you can't put god in the box he can do it however he wants to we're just looking at this and understanding how god can just speak and create something he can step into that spirit body can have something to dwell in for a moment just for a moment and then come forth he can bring a ceremonial bread and wine to have a ceremony he can meet abraham in the in the tent door and have meat and and wine and fellowship uh but then but that but it wasn't to the place that that supreme sacrifice could be because remember jesus had to come in a corporal body not a spoken body but a created blood seed body the seed of the woman genesis 3 last week the seed of the woman had to call forth a created blood seed body in the womb of a woman to come forth to bring forth jesus christ the only way he could come to bring redemption to the human race amen but before we get further uh in into that i want to read you this uh that brother brown talked about who is this melchizedek this kind of sums it up and lord willing this we'll just sum this up with this and we'll move on as we get to that place and understanding who really this melchizedek was who this this individual that confounds the most intelligent most studied learned scholar a divinity bible knowing people could not find could not see but listen this why did he come abraham being the one with the promise and the message of the coming son and also he was god's word prophet that was trusting god's word calling anything that was trusting god's word calling anything contrary as though it wasn't now look the differentiation between someone that calls themselves a prophet which is a very loose terminology really it's taken in high regard a lot of times but it's a very loose understanding of translation but a god sent word prophet is going to stay with god's word period they don't stay with god's word they're not god's prophet see how perfect the word is the word came to the prophet he's talking about melchizedek coming to abraham the word melchizedek came to the prophet see there was god in a theophany the bible says the word comes to the prophet and there he was the word in the theophany a word body housing the almighty to come and meet his victorious son abraham and brought up communion served him of his of his own self now you say what uh was that god abraham said it was he said his name he called him elohim now in genesis 1 you find the elohim created the heaven and the earth genesis 18 abraham called this person sat there talk with him could tell his secrets of his heart tell what sarah was thinking behind him abraham said it is elohim he was in a theophany form or a word body it was a spoken word body that was just created it wasn't a hemoglobin created blood cell human body there's a difference there amen this was just a spoken word out of the dust and indigos jesus was that was that spoken germ seed blood cell body in the womb of mary that brought forth a human flesh in the likeness of sinful flesh nothing simple about the offany body amen and and and and shall i say each one of us those that are believers those that are a part of god have that theophany body waiting for us as well that word body we just bypassed our theophanies to go from the attribute of god down into these human flesh bodies to be tempted tried but when the flesh drops off of this he said when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one that's waiting that is of the heavens we have a created word body a theophany waiting for us just to step from here to here is just a step from here to here amen this body can no longer hold us but we go into that word body we go into that theophany that body that's been prepared for us before the foundation of the world we just bypass it to come into this human body he was in theophany form that word body see now we find out that he was in the theophany form he called him lord god elohim genesis 18. now notice abraham there was three of them together but when abraham met the three he said my lord and we've gone over that i understand he looked at that there was only one there the others weren't his lord it was just the one that was his lord god melchizedek that spirit that same logo see but when lot down in sodom two of them went down there and lot saw the two of them coming he said my lords plural see what was the matter the first place locke was not a prophet that's right neither was he a messenger messenger of the hour so he didn't have any revelation of him is exactly right lot called them lords a dozen of them he would have still said lords but no matter how many abraham saw it was still one lord there is god this was the melchizedek amen this was the melchizedek the same one notice after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious child communion think of that part of himself been hitting that now now we want to sir uh to see here and type into view the communion after the battle he gave him himself because the communion is part of christ we do it as a ceremonial form not as the literal body but a ceremonial form as a as an ordinance that god left us that we partake of amen that's a part of our continual victory our continuous victory communion and fellowship with the lord jesus on a daily basis as we battle it out wrestle it out we come forth victorious with the help of almighty god and we commune with him on it we fellowship with him on it praise the lord have that daily communion but then we have that ceremonial time that we partake of the wine and the bread that ordinance that god gave us that's that time together that we take that's a part of him we consider part of him and after the struggle is over and after you've got got uh and after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of christ become part of this being amen after you've whipped it out and become part of this being and won that victory amen that's when we become victorious in the lord jesus that's our victory the battle has been won yes we know we are more than conquerors but we're still conquerors we're only conquerors because he conquered for us and made us more than conquerors but we still have the conquering to do we still have the battle again it's not the setting on the sea to do nothing we have the battles to fight too we have the battles to win and with his help we always uh we always come out victorious amen now let's look at the condescension let's look and finalize this condensation today jesus christ we just talked about jesus christ coming in body form it's not the spoken word theophany word body it was a body that was created by the spoke by god's creation yes spoken of a blood cell a literal blood cell in the womb of a woman to bring forth a human baby in the likeness of sinful flesh now we read this uh we read which was to which was to be the perfect supreme sacrifice something that was sinless and had the ability to take away the sin of the soul the darkness of the soul now the body too unfortunately we you know body spirit would benefit but the but the the thing that god is most concerned with is the soul not not the body not the spirit those part of it of course that is of that is of our desire and need we we bring that under subjection by the spirit of god but god's coming to get the soul the soul is the real you that's that part of god that was him and had to be before the foundation's world that's what he's coming to get that's who you really are so the darkness of that soul had to be cleansed and the blood of a bull or a goat or a lamb back in genesis 3 21 could not satisfy that again remember the sacrifice was the the original sin was a blood sin so the sacrifice had to be a blood sacrifice but it had to be a sacrifice now those lambs were innocent yes but the lambs didn't have a soul animals didn't have a soul the bulls goats but jesus christ come forth in human flesh and the likeness of sinful places a human with a soul to be able to live sinless to take his our sins upon him and we read this before saint john chapter one we see here in saint john chapter one in the beginning we went to this uh back when we read genesis 1 1 was the word that word greek is logos that word that comes forth and we talked about what the logos is and read it to you again here logos is a thought or concept a thought or concept or the expression or utterance of that thought expression or utterance of that thought that thought or concept well that was god in the beginning was the word that fault concept the utterance of that come forth now in hebrews 11 it says that by the word of god the worlds were framed by the word of god now that's not logos that's rhema but it's the result of what has been spoken what we see today is a result of what has been spoken god's word and you see we talked about logos rhema just briefly before but you see the difference see now that was the result of what was spoken now in the beginning was the word that's the existence of god it's kind of like god's love uh agapo agape uh is one is a noun and one is a verb one exists because god exists the other exists because it's god in action it's actually a manifestation of it this is the same thing see this word is the existence of god in the beginning was the word his existence period the word was with god and the word was god it was that existence of the almighty elohim all-knowing god just say god see that word that logos but now uh and the same in in the beginning and the same was in the beginning with god see that same spirit banana 14 and the word that word see in the beginning was the word that logos that part of god see now it's manifested and that word was made flesh you see now the word made flesh it calmed down from the existence of god in his self-existing uh uh condition it never began never end never will end self-existing elohim god never had a beginning never had an ending that that god then existence became flesh and when it became flesh it became the expression read colossians 1. i'm sorry i keep referring back to these different places where hardy hit this part four so i'm trying to bring this back together again and tie it see in colossians uh uh chapter one that we found out that expression came forth the word expressed god's spoken word created germ blood germ seed in the woman expressed and came forth in the flesh and dwelt among us and he is the same hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever but we see the word coming flesh now uh romans 8 he come in the likeness of sinful flesh we'll read something in a minute that brings us to that point of that of that flesh that he came as a kinsmer redeemer ohio thought seriously and we'll just have to do it another time and did it the tabernacle one time but uh of bringing in that kinsmen redeemer and ruth and boaz and and and helping get a grips of understanding the old testament type again of that kinsman redeemer and how important it was that that that there was a nearer kinsman truth it was oh i i'm starting to get into it there's there was a near kinsman there was somebody that had claims over her amen look friend after the fall there was someone that had claims on you first of all that was the devil had claims on you that's why we're born in sin shake iniquity come in the world speaking lies that near kinsmen satan had rights to you that he had to forfeit his rights when jesus christ come forth as the kinsmen redeemer as the the as the one in sinful flesh the only one that could bring redemption satan could not redeem it the near kinsmen reduced could not redeem it so boaz could come forth and take ruth to himself there was a near kinsman but he couldn't lay his hands on it so he had to forfeit the one that could bring redemption jesus christ as the kinsmen redeemer the word made flesh not just the word theophany but the word made flesh that come flesh for me and you he had to come that way he could feel pain he could feel tiredness he could feel hunger he could feel sickness he could feel all the things that we feel he could have a headache he could have a back ache he could be tired he could be of all the things that we feel and know today amen that body was subject to and that body today is subject just like our bodies are subject to that he overcame it the same way we overcome it amen praise the lord we're victorious in jesus christ but it was only because of that word becoming flesh that allows us to be able to do that now we have to have faith in that that's where our faith comes from we have to have faith in that to believe that if we don't believe it if we don't have faith in it it's not going to work see but we've got to have faith believe in that not not just an intellectual faith not just i believe he existed or i believe he came or a an unwavering faith of god um that's beyond our comprehension and it's not something you work up it's not something you manufacture it's just there it's a part of who you are because you're a part of him but it's got to take that faith now listen this is in the hebrew teaching in 1957. he said here's what happened he said oh excuse me a minute i get this just gets right down where i love it see the logos and this great fountain this great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in the creation that spirit began to form in the creation that's why paul married the two together jesus and melchizedek amen brought the two together see it was that spirit forming itself into creation again another portion of god's condescension where he could come and and and and live and breathe and and be with those that he his disciples and those around him we can read about hear about it amen that spirit that spirit began forming into that creation and the logos that went out from it was the son of god was the son of god it was the only visible form that this spirit had the only visible form the spirit had and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man moses saw when he passed by the rock he said look the look like the hind part of a man same type of body to receive when we die here if this earthly tabernacle beat is off we have one already waiting that was it and that was the theophany which was the son of god the son that logos became flesh because we were put in flesh it he came in flesh that spirit forming into creation because we are flesh we were brought into flesh so he came in flesh because we were put in flesh again the kinsman part together the if theophany logos became flesh here among us and it was nothing else but the dwelling place for that entire fountain dwell in him all the fullness of the godhead bodily colossians 1 and colossians 2 both say that he was the fullness jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and i believe his colossians 2 10 says and we are complete in him amen if he's the fullness of the godhead bodily and we are complete in him where does that make us we are complete in him talk about a full preeminence we will we get to this next part that in that in uh dwelling place see theophy logos came flesh among us it was nothing but the it was nothing else but the dwelling place for that entire fountain dwelt in him praise the lord that entire fountain dwelt in him and we are complete in him praise the lord my friend if that doesn't help us get to the place we understand who we are i don't know what it's going to take amen let's look here now let's go to philippians we'll finish this up in philippians chapter 2 philippians chapter 2. now we've already gotten here to to the to the body of christ the blood that was shed the blood of god blood cell that was broke release god upon the uh in spirit form upon the people and come back and the worshiper uh and not just on the worshiper but in the worshipper acts 2 the spirit of god come like a rushing mighty wind and lit upon them and its cloven tongues and set upon them and went in them the anointing and the indwelling not just one not just an anointing which anybody can feel but the indwelling you come into the soul of man not just on but in both amen see philippians 2 verse 1 if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies and that is the vows is the deep affection the heartfeltness is what it means by the bowels see and mercies fulfill ye my joy fulfill your complete my joy and paul talking here in the philippians complete my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind that was that was paul's desire see every true man of god every true pastor uh though he's an apostle uh has that desire that he that he desires to see all of us he desires to see his congregation his people those that are he's witness to ministry to to become one together see and that's what he's like that's what he's saying here fulfill my joy make me a happy man by being like-minded by having the same love being of one accordion of one mind together as a people together amen let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but a lowliness of mind that each esteem other better than themselves we uphold one another above ourselves esteem other better than themselves let nothing be done through strife and glory but low leaders might let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also that's not saying not to take care of your own home but it's saying also on the things of others to be there to help other people it's not busybody he's not talking about being a nosy busybody he's talking about helping people praying for people being there for people being one another together if we hold together like james said we pray one for the other that we all may be healed see that's the way it works that's the way the unity in the body combines together to work see and uh he's just clarifying this or giving more description to it uh now fifth verse let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus that mind that spirit the holy spirit the mind of god let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god and this word and being in the form of god see he talked about being in that form that word form is morpha uh which of course we know is changing from one form to another that that god that almighty could do now that form we just talked about morpha really highlights a lot of what we talked about at the beginning of this message the the morpha changing coming from a word body theophany into a burning bush into a whirlwind into a wheel in the middle of a wheel into a cloud into a pillar of fire into all the things god manifested himself marking himself this morphe that he did becoming flesh god morphing himself jesus christ being in the form of god morphed in human flesh see took on human sinful flesh bought it not robbery to be equal with god amen or of the of the equal standing of the same mind the same spirit the same uh uh aptitude this the the basically thinking the same equal but made himself of no reputation and he took upon himself amen he took upon himself he voluntarily purposely voluntarily took this upon himself the form there it is again form morpha of a servant of a servant or the likeness of sinful flesh and was made in the likeness of men that's what uh the paul says philippians he told them in the in in to the roman church in chapter eight that it was a likeness of sinful flesh here he's saying uh that he made himself no reputation took upon himself the form he called it a servant being made in the likeness of men morph himself into our likeness he didn't become literally me but he came as i was and we sing the song he became me that i might become him that's the that's the uh the spirit the the changing of that spirit or or us from who we were to who he is and i'm still me but i took him upon myself he took me upon himself he took my sin so i could become his righteousness see he was righteous gave himself up and became in the likeness of sinful flesh in the form morphed himself into that form so that we could become righteous by taking our sins from us the only way he could do it made himself of no reputation but now look in the form of god he thought it not robbery to be equal with god now in the form of god he morphed himself see in the likeness of sinful flesh god morphing himself and becoming in the likeness of his servant thought it not robbery to be equal with god now i want to hit a point here as i will post here just a few minutes robbery is to subtract or to take away from so if you think in the in the context of the bible saying thought it not robbery he thought it's kind of odd verbiage there but what he's really saying is what he considered was it did not take anything away from god for him to consider himself equal with god you understand see even though he was morphing into the likeness of sinful flesh it was not subtracting anything from god for him to realize who he was in god oh friend if we could just understand even though we are in the form even though we are morphing in sinful flesh not the likeness of sinful flesh as he was we are actually in sinful flesh even though we are morphing in that sinful flesh we can look at this by the mind of christ and realize that it's not taking anything away from god for us to realize who we are in god that we are a part of god and that god has put in spirit in us so that it would bring us to the place that he is oh that's exactly what god's trying to get us to see that's exactly what god's trying to get us to understand and become is that we are in that form but it's not taking anything see satan's problem was satan wanted to be above god he wanted to subtract away from god by taking the worshipers fro of god away from him and exalting him above the most high see that satan's big mistake was to be as god is to be above the most high to take away from god those that worship him so that they would worship him instead and how many people oh my how many ministers how many people want to try to do that today from business to government to to churches people want to take away and rob away from god so that those people serve them instead of him [Music] but we're not here to serve a pastor a minister a church or a government we're here to serve almighty god oh help us it's not robbery for god to put us in the position to know who we are when this bride comes to know who she is that's not taking anything away from god that's actually adding to god because if you came from god you're going back to god that's just adding to that's not subtracting away from that's not any kind of robbery and paul is helping us to see jesus in that position but look friend if you are complete in him then it's not taking away anything away from god for you to know who you are in him oh praise the lord it's not robbery it's actually adding to not taking away amen he thought it not robert to be equal with god of the same mind if you look that word equal up it just means of the same mind the same spirit well that isn't that what we're supposed to be aren't we supposed to be in that place aren't we supposed to be of equal mind of equal spirit god is bringing us to the place that that that we're in that place with him not our carnality not our human minds not our human abilities i'm talking about the spirit the soul that place that god dwells with man oh let let god help us bring us to that place it's not taking away from him it's adding to him amen praise the lord jesus being found in the fashion is a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and giving him the name which is above every name that the name of jesus every knee should bow the things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and then every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father amen praise the lord that's exactly what he's trying to do god help us to do it god help us to fulfill that part that he give us not think it'd be robbery it's not taking away it's adding two one more quote here unveiling of god god unveiled in jesus to do the work of redemption at the cross god could not die as a spirit he's the eternal but he had to put on a mask and act the part of death he did die but he couldn't do it in his god form he had to do it in sun form morphine in the form in the image in the likeness of sinful flesh as son of man on earth he had to be a sun formed then when he returned pentecostal did uh he was son of god again amen god that great spirit that great condensation ascension of the great almighty god that great spirit that come and is doing the same today he's doing it through us he's doing it through this bride friend let's take our place in that it's not robbery it's it's adding to god it's not taking away from it's adding to god that place that god has called us that we're supposed to be that place that god desires that's our position that's our place that goes right back to that adoption we talked for a year almost on amen brings us right back into that into that fellowship into that place with the lord amen the bread and wine is set before us that continual communion with the lord jesus amen how wonderful it is praise the lord god bless you saints amen i pray something was said to bless you today my wish which we were together i would have loved to have delivered
