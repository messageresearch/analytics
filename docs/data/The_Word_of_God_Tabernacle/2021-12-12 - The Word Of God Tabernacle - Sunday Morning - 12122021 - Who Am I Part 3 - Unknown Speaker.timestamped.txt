[16:12] this time
[16:13] absolutely
[16:15] um
[16:21] uh
[16:22] here we are in the last day
[16:24] and
[16:25] you know through the years and brother
[16:28] um bennett touched on it last week
[16:30] that um
[16:32] when we're adopted we um get into um you
[16:35] know we are adopted and then we're and
[16:37] then we get it and then we're given our
[16:39] position
[16:40] and so through the years i've heard this
[16:43] about you know being knowing our
[16:45] position that we need to know our
[16:47] position in christ
[16:49] and so i knew i was adopted and so i
[16:52] didn't know what my job was
[16:54] and i'd have to and uh and and i have to
[16:57] back up on that because
[16:59] about 20 years or more ago god showed me
[17:02] what to do and but you know still we
[17:06] i still had those thoughts well what's
[17:08] my position you know thinking that it
[17:10] was different than my job you know
[17:13] and i don't know why but
[17:15] and uh and and god revealed to me
[17:19] that and i'm telling this because
[17:21] there's other people
[17:24] that are going through this too not just
[17:26] me
[17:27] that i i went through of knowing what is
[17:30] my position what is my job in christ if
[17:32] you go down to the wire brothers and
[17:34] sisters we got to be out
[17:36] talking to people and telling them about
[17:38] the lord i realize i'm not just saved
[17:41] for myself
[17:42] i'm safe for other people to get that
[17:44] word out there and we've been given a
[17:47] job and so
[17:49] um whether it's praying for those who
[17:51] are doing it or yadda yadda so i so i
[17:54] just i the lord revealed to me
[17:57] that
[17:59] i don't have to have a name for my
[18:01] position
[18:02] i don't have to have that and here i
[18:05] thought i had to have a name all this
[18:06] time i'm a prophet i'm an evangelist i'm
[18:09] a what i mean that's i'm not a body
[18:11] minister but you know it's just you know
[18:13] what i'm saying
[18:14] i don't have to have a name for what i
[18:16] do or or have to know i just need to
[18:19] follow the leading of the holy spirit
[18:21] that's it that's all i need to do
[18:24] i don't have to have a name for it and
[18:26] it could and wherever he leads me that's
[18:28] right that's my position amen amen
[18:32] god bless you exactly right i'll bless
[18:34] you i just want to encourage people amen
[18:38] amen good system of peace absolutely
[18:40] amen anyone else
[18:46] yes ma'am absolutely i just wanna
[18:50] confess and confess
[18:52] praise the lord for healing my love

[18:59] good huh
[19:00] yeah
[19:01] mine was really bothering me a couple of
[19:03] months ago that kobe probably tried to
[19:06] attack gurgling and stuff

[19:21] the lord i believe has shown you what to
[19:24] do
[19:26] and it's helped me amen i'm gonna
[19:29] continue like brother newton said god

[19:53] and listen and god help us to recognize
[19:56] it yes when he sends it we humble
[19:58] ourselves to it
[19:59] yeah exactly true hey
[20:02] amen anyone else
[20:04] song okay
[20:07] you do you have a song uh after you how
[20:09] about that i just need a mic either
[20:11] yours or
[20:12] my dad's uh
[20:15] okay i'll get you mine how about that
[20:17] we don't have a little microphone no
[20:18] more huh well we only have the two okay
[20:21] i thought we had a handheld bike we do
[20:23] but i can't play
[20:27] it
[20:28] all right sorry
[20:29] i'm gonna try it sure you can i know
[20:44] this song came to my heart uh
[20:48] because
[20:50] usually i try to sing like christmas
[20:51] songs or easter songs depending on the
[20:53] holiday
[20:54] one came to my mind but it didn't quite
[20:56] work out and then this came to my mind
[21:00] because without christ there is no
[21:02] christmas
[21:05] this is
[21:06] my one of my mom's favorite songs i
[21:08] don't know she hadn't
[21:10] stuff to say last time i sing it i don't
[21:11] know if she wants to
[21:13] share
[21:14] why this is one of your favorite songs
[21:16] that's one of my favorite songs because
[21:19] being an orphan i never had anything or
[21:21] anybody
[21:22] and when i came to know god that song
[21:24] just spoke to me
[21:26] that's all i've got that's all i want
[21:40] [Music]
[21:47] christ alone will i glory
[21:51] though i could pride myself
[21:54] in battles
[22:02] [Music]
[22:11] successes
[22:12] like diamonds in
[22:15] my hands
[22:17] but those trophies
[22:22] by which i

[43:22] this week brother tom had to do some
[43:24] things for the gym show still coming up
[43:26] so they're not with us i haven't heard
[43:28] from the frappos or
[43:30] sister
[43:32] sister julie and of course the prayer
[43:34] requests you heard about art so listen
[43:36] remember the bios terrorists and prayer
[43:38] brother arch and he was bothering my i
[43:40] don't really know why the circumstances

[43:49] you thank you for coming being here
[43:50] today appreciate the lord most of all or
[43:53] we can all be here but if he's not here
[43:56] means nothing
[43:57] we might as well go down to the denny's
[43:59] right here and have a nice little meal
[44:00] because that's about all it would amount
[44:01] to
[44:02] but if he's here
[44:06] healing is met salvation
[44:09] the spirit of god whatever need you have
[44:11] amen
[44:12] praise the lord so let's turn our bibles
[44:14] now uh saint john we're going to go back
[44:16] here again
[44:18] third part of who am i
[44:20] amen saint john chapter three
[44:24] we'll uh begin reading in the same place
[44:26] that we read from before
[44:28] is this on
[44:31] light doesn't look like it's kind of
[44:33] dull
[44:34] probably need to change the batteries in
[44:35] it i'm going to use this one brother
[44:38] as long as it can hear it's okay okay
[44:40] yeah if it kind of goes out or something
[44:43] say something to me or something we got
[44:44] batteries but
[44:46] i'm just thinking maybe that's why the
[44:47] lights kind of dull i don't know but
[44:49] anyway st john chapter three i i never
[44:53] don't need a mic but we do it because it
[44:55] helps the
[44:57] uh coming into the camera for the
[45:00] streaming and
[45:01] for the
[45:02] archiving later so
[45:04] that's the reason we do it but st john
[45:06] chapter three uh we're gonna read a
[45:08] couple of verses of scripture here as we
[45:09] have been the past couple of weeks but
[45:11] let's bow our heads for another word of
[45:12] prayer if we could
[45:14] amen lord jesus we're so thankful father
[45:16] of your blessings your grace your love
[45:18] your mercy lord what can we say god
[45:21] it fails us so many times with the human
[45:23] tongue to be able to thank you
[45:25] for how much we love you and what we
[45:27] feel in our hearts and what you mean to
[45:29] us lord in life god i believe maybe
[45:31] sometimes that's why you give us another
[45:33] language in this life that we call
[45:35] tongues god because it just seems like
[45:37] sometimes we just don't have enough
[45:39] human words to be able to thank you and
[45:41] praise you enough for all that you do
[45:43] for us every day god you never leave us
[45:45] or forsake us you bless us strengthen us
[45:48] of course god your mercy your grace your
[45:50] love is so bountiful in our lives
[45:53] lord
[45:53] and a people that was so unworthy and so
[45:56] undeserving
[45:57] that god you made us worthy father
[45:59] because as it was saying earlier you
[46:01] became us that we might become you so
[46:03] that it's by your grace that we can be
[46:05] robed in your righteousness today stand
[46:08] upon the promises of your word god
[46:10] because you give them to us and it would
[46:12] be negligent on our part to think
[46:15] anything other than that yes lord it's
[46:17] uh it's a word that we look to that god
[46:20] we desire to become because it's
[46:22] something that you wanted us to do where
[46:24] you want us to be father to help us
[46:27] realize who we are and you god yes lord
[46:29] that's that's our standard that's our
[46:31] placement that's our adoption that's
[46:33] where we live that's where you want us
[46:35] to be and i don't believe lord this
[46:37] bride will ever go out of here until she
[46:39] recognizes that each and every one of us
[46:41] lord yes so god may you bless us again
[46:44] with this service bless us father with
[46:46] what you would speak to us this word
[46:48] lord this message all that you've given
[46:49] to us god we just give it back to you in
[46:52] servitude and love lord we rebuke every
[46:54] demonic spirit that will try to hurt
[46:56] hinder infiltrate this service in any
[46:58] way that you would get the glory and the
[47:00] praise for all that is said and done
[47:02] today in the name of our lord and savior
[47:05] jesus christ we pray
[47:07] amen amen
[47:08] amen
[47:10] john chapter three we're just going to
[47:11] read two verses this time verse
[47:13] beginning with verse 15
[47:15] for whosoever believeth in him should
[47:18] not perish but have eternal life for god
[47:21] so loved the world that he gave his only
[47:23] begotten son the whosoever believeth
[47:25] that him shall not perish but have
[47:27] everlasting life
[47:28] amen you can be seated if you'd like
[47:32] amen
[47:34] i'm going to lay a challenge down real
[47:36] quick before i get started
[47:38] uh brother wilson was streaming the
[47:40] service wednesday night and i appreciate
[47:42] his comments that he gave after the
[47:44] service was over and he had some
[47:46] thoughts he wrote down some notes and
[47:48] things and that was
[47:50] that was going through his mind during
[47:51] the service and i thought well why don't
[47:54] you just come preach it to us
[47:57] the challenge has been laid
[48:00] amen i have a lot of respect for your
[48:02] love brothers and so you are welcome
[48:04] amen amen i know the challenge is out
[48:07] now but and i mean it i don't say that
[48:10] just for uh just for effect or just here
[48:12] but i absolutely mean it so uh amen so
[48:16] thank you brother god bless you
[48:18] we want to continue on with the thought
[48:20] that we had uh the past couple of weeks
[48:22] on who am i
[48:25] and uh try to pick up lord willing from
[48:27] where we left off last week uh and by
[48:29] the way i really enjoyed the the
[48:31] fellowship last week i enjoyed the meal
[48:33] i appreciate all the efforts everything
[48:35] that went into making it a success uh
[48:37] next door i thank the landlord for
[48:40] allowing us to use the place next door
[48:42] and uh and
[48:44] a lot went into it it's a big effort is
[48:46] it's it's work uh it's uh but uh a lot
[48:50] of cooking and all but it was a real
[48:52] blessing real blessing to me i really
[48:54] enjoyed it i loved the fellowship love
[48:56] to have everybody all sitting together
[48:58] there and we filled up that room thanks
[49:01] you know that room was almost too small
[49:04] with the food and everybody the table so
[49:06] but it was a real blessing and i enjoyed
[49:08] it very much you know
[49:09] i uh
[49:11] you know when when we moved in here and
[49:13] that place moved in next door and
[49:16] immediately we started praying that the
[49:18] lord would move that out and my thought
[49:20] my thought process was god that just
[49:21] didn't want those evil spirits hanging
[49:23] around
[49:24] you know this close you give us this
[49:26] place and i told you we lay hands on
[49:28] that wall and those people that month
[49:30] two months later they were gone
[49:33] but tabitha told me right after that
[49:35] they had left
[49:37] uh that i you know
[49:39] my testimony and how i've been praying
[49:41] about that she said i felt like the lord
[49:42] opened that up because we was going to
[49:44] need it
[49:45] so amen
[49:47] so thank god
[49:50] believing that both of those things came
[49:52] to pass
[49:53] amen
[49:54] god moved those spirits out and was able
[49:57] to use the place so thank the lord for
[49:59] that amen and again
[50:01] the man let us have it free of charge so
[50:04] uh it was a real blessing and i
[50:05] appreciate that god's so good to us
[50:07] amen so thank the lord so we'll just
[50:10] continue on again where we left off last
[50:12] week now we want to i want to get the
[50:14] focus on that uh eternal life part
[50:17] because that eternal life again is
[50:19] remembrance to us
[50:21] of what eternity is and and who is
[50:23] eternal and what is eternal right uh we
[50:26] all talk about him boast about having
[50:28] eternal life but but we recognize that
[50:30] that as we look at one another there's
[50:33] something beyond that that we recognize
[50:35] is eternity because we had a beginning
[50:38] we'll have an end but the only thing
[50:40] that's eternal is god because god never
[50:42] had a beginning and anything that never
[50:44] had a beginning will never have an end
[50:46] that eternity part now i want to enter
[50:49] into that sonship part the sonship
[50:53] christ and the sons of god and as we are
[50:56] sons and daughters of god today a lot of
[50:58] times um
[51:00] uh the bible references and we talk
[51:02] about sons of god and it says sons of
[51:04] god but you understand that that's just
[51:07] humanity that doesn't leave you sisters
[51:09] out right it means humanity sons of god
[51:12] is humanity not just men right it is men
[51:15] and women amen we're sons and daughters
[51:18] sometimes we'll add the daughter apart
[51:19] but the fact of it is it just
[51:21] encompasses the entire humanity so as we
[51:25] mentioned sons of god so i want to get
[51:27] into that son ship a little bit today
[51:29] and and uh and read some that i had
[51:32] mentioned a couple of weeks ago that
[51:33] maybe uh maybe something that
[51:36] that that might help a little bit but uh
[51:39] but let's go over to romans chapter
[51:41] eight
[51:42] and let's uh let's start into this if we
[51:44] could we we read galatians chapter four
[51:47] and we could go back there too but
[51:49] i want to since we've read that i want
[51:51] to go to uh romans chapter 8 now
[51:56] we'll begin reading
[51:58] with verse 14 romans 8 14
[52:02] and uh and talk about this sonship
[52:05] because remember
[52:08] a son
[52:10] has a beginning a son a daughter is
[52:12] something that is begotten right
[52:14] anything that is begotten had a
[52:16] beginning amen amen anything that's
[52:20] begotten had a beginning has an ending
[52:24] thus is not eternal
[52:26] it may live on and on and on even our
[52:28] lives and our spirits uh just like
[52:31] people who
[52:32] end up going to hell
[52:34] there is no such thing as an eternal
[52:36] hell right right because if there's an
[52:38] eternal hell you got to have eternal
[52:40] life to be in hell and anybody that has
[52:42] eternal life won't be in hell right
[52:44] there's no point of hell being eternal
[52:46] right so it might go forever and ever
[52:49] but it is not eternal because
[52:52] hell was created for the devil and his
[52:55] angels so if it was created it meant it
[52:57] had a beginning if it had a beginning it
[52:59] will have an end so we understand so
[53:02] as sons as a son ship
[53:05] that had a beginning was a begotten so
[53:08] that begotten had it has an end that sun
[53:12] again is that adoptive place the
[53:15] placement of relationship that we have
[53:17] now not placement like sister matisse is
[53:20] talking about but relationship amen so
[53:24] let's go to uh
[53:25] well we're in romans 8 14 let's read
[53:27] here
[53:29] romans 8 14 for as many as are led by
[53:32] the spirit of god
[53:33] they are the sons of god amen so if you
[53:37] are led by god that you are if you have
[53:39] the holy spirit of god that holy spirit
[53:42] in you is leading you
[53:44] then that leading just proves that you
[53:47] are a son of god because otherwise you
[53:49] would you would reject the word you
[53:52] would reject that spirit you would
[53:54] reject that leading right and anybody
[53:56] that rejects that leading cannot be
[53:58] considered a son a son is someone who is
[54:01] going to be obedient and be led by that
[54:03] spirit so as we're led by that spirit as
[54:06] galatians said because we are sons of
[54:10] god
[54:11] amen we are led by the spirit of god so
[54:14] you see the the the intertwining of
[54:17] these two facets
[54:19] amen
[54:20] uh
[54:22] scofield has in his notes here that we
[54:24] become
[54:26] we become in a relationship as sons when
[54:29] we're born again
[54:30] but i beg to differ now in our human
[54:33] flesh we come to the recognition as our
[54:37] humanity is that we are sons of god
[54:40] absolutely that's a beginning place for
[54:42] us in our recognition of it in our
[54:44] humanity but if you are a son of god now
[54:48] you have always been a son of god
[54:49] because you came from god if you came
[54:52] from god that makes you a son of god a
[54:54] part of god from before the foundation
[54:56] of the world
[54:58] so if you were born again you didn't
[55:01] become a seed because you were born
[55:03] again you are born again because you
[55:05] were a seed
[55:07] amen so it's it's transverse on the in
[55:11] the scripture uh like i said a
[55:13] scofield's note said that you you you
[55:15] come in relationship as adoption when
[55:18] you when you were born again or upon the
[55:20] new birth but you could not be reborn if
[55:23] you hadn't already had that relationship
[55:26] that seed that placement of what you
[55:29] what part of god you are to begin with
[55:32] if it wasn't there to begin with it was
[55:34] never going to be there but if it was
[55:37] there to begin with it will always be
[55:39] there
[55:40] praise the lord amen
[55:42] so as we are led as as we are led by the
[55:45] spirit of god we are sons of god that's
[55:48] that's a proving ground that's a place
[55:51] of acceptance amen because you're led of
[55:54] god
[55:55] for ye have not received the spirit of
[55:57] bondage again to fear which kind of goes
[55:59] to our wednesday night service
[56:02] we have not received the spirit of
[56:04] bondage again to fear
[56:06] amen which the world is putting on the
[56:09] the people this world's putting fear
[56:11] upon the whole world
[56:13] uh in my life which my short 56 years
[56:16] will be wednesday now for my short 56
[56:19] years i've never seen the world in such
[56:21] a tr a tumultuous
[56:23] uh place of fear
[56:25] i i've just it's fear has so gripped
[56:29] people today right
[56:31] i think it's probably some in part due
[56:33] to
[56:34] the fact that people have rejected god
[56:37] turned their back on god the unknown of
[56:39] death
[56:40] people are scared of death used to be
[56:42] people were willing to lay down their
[56:44] lives for uh for different reasons
[56:46] people uh a military whatever nowadays
[56:49] it seems like uh
[56:51] people are just scared to death to die
[56:53] friend
[56:54] death is just that open door like
[56:56] brother said just that open door that
[56:58] allows that allows us out of this past
[57:01] house
[57:02] amen i don't want to rush it
[57:04] but when the lord's ready for me i'm
[57:06] ready
[57:07] amen i'm not going to push him on it
[57:10] i'm not gonna say let's hurry this
[57:12] process lord
[57:14] uh
[57:14] many of all my family's gone many
[57:16] friends but uh but i want to do it as he
[57:19] leads to do it you see so uh whatever he
[57:22] does but there's fear
[57:24] such a fear but the spirit of god has
[57:26] not come to bring fear right right amen
[57:29] a bondage that fear is a bondage exactly
[57:32] you might just talk about wednesday
[57:33] night a bondage that keeps people bound
[57:36] that fear is what is one thing that does
[57:38] it but you have received the spirit
[57:41] capital s
[57:42] of adoption whereby we cry about father
[57:45] that spirit of adoption that placement
[57:48] amen we already know that we are sons of
[57:50] god
[57:51] like we said before the last couple
[57:53] services the prodigal son was always the
[57:55] son yes amen he was never not a son he
[57:58] was a son in the beginning when he was
[58:00] out with his nose dipped in the pig
[58:02] trough he was a son when he came back
[58:04] home he was a son always a son never not
[58:07] a son so as he was that son that spirit
[58:10] of adoption
[58:12] uh comes to to place us in a position of
[58:15] faith see it's hard to have faith when
[58:18] you don't know who you are when you
[58:20] don't know where you're at in the body
[58:22] of christ and who you are in christ uh
[58:25] even if you are in christ a lot of
[58:27] people still probably even doubt that
[58:29] they are in christ or a christian uh
[58:32] they don't they don't uh have a
[58:34] revelation of that
[58:35] so that that spirit that placement amen
[58:39] helps us be able to have that faith and
[58:41] the faith is what casts out the fear
[58:43] right the faith will cast out the fear
[58:45] so if you have that faith because you
[58:47] know when you're standing on the word of
[58:49] god you know who you are in the body of
[58:52] christ and there's no worry
[58:54] there's no fretting over it you know
[58:56] that you can stand on that word and say
[58:59] satan gifty behind me
[59:01] you have no place in this home you have
[59:03] no place in this family you have no
[59:05] place in this church you have no place
[59:07] in my life
[59:09] amen and you can stand on that and faith
[59:11] will move that mountain that's right
[59:14] faithful get rid of that doubt faithful
[59:16] get rid of that fear faith will get rid
[59:18] of that devil yes and put you in that
[59:20] place where you should be standing where
[59:23] you should be positioned in him
[59:25] and that places is where god can use us
[59:28] right how many so many times i thank god
[59:31] he keeps me healthy yes relatively
[59:34] healthy strong in him
[59:36] and and i thank him for that not because
[59:38] i enjoy being healthy i do
[59:41] but i i thank him because i can't serve
[59:44] them the way i want to if i'm sick
[59:47] i can't serve him the way i want to if
[59:49] i'm if i'm in a lowered position or or
[59:52] incapable of doing something right if
[59:54] i'm incapable of it then i can't serve
[59:56] him the way i want to right i got to be
[59:59] in a in a positionally miserly
[1:00:02] physically financially spiritually to be
[1:00:04] able to serve him the way i want to
[1:00:07] and if i'm in a falling condition down
[1:00:09] somewhere even if it's just physical i
[1:00:11] can't serve him like i want to i thank
[1:00:13] him god thank you for that
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:16] not for my benefit but that i might do
[1:00:19] something for your kingdom
[1:00:21] that's the whole point yes amen
[1:00:24] father father praise the lord thank you
[1:00:26] for that the spirit capital s again
[1:00:30] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:00:33] lower s like we had on the board the
[1:00:35] past couple of weeks
[1:00:37] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:00:40] god yes so that spirit that capital s
[1:00:43] now that spirit is coming to our soul i
[1:00:46] took the drawing off so i can't
[1:00:48] i got something else i just it's not a
[1:00:50] secret i just uh didn't want you
[1:00:52] focusing on that the whole time or
[1:00:54] looking at that but that capitalist that
[1:00:57] holy spirit god's spirit coming in our
[1:00:59] soul taking over permanent resident of
[1:01:02] our soul
[1:01:03] our spirit our human spirit then
[1:01:06] recognizes because there has to be an
[1:01:08] acknowledgement because remember the the
[1:01:11] the soul is the nature of our human
[1:01:14] spirit so if that's the case then that
[1:01:17] nature that is in there now which is god
[1:01:20] god's nature god's own life is is in
[1:01:23] there that seed has become germatized
[1:01:26] and is growing that seal is laid on
[1:01:28] there and that soul is the permanent
[1:01:30] residence of that holy spirit in you
[1:01:32] then that human spirit bears witness to
[1:01:35] that spirit amen comes under subjection
[1:01:39] if you will to that spirit it has to yes
[1:01:42] amen has to come under subjection now of
[1:01:44] course there's a lot of times we'll uh
[1:01:46] do things according to that uh human
[1:01:48] spirit that we shouldn't do imagination
[1:01:51] conscious infection reason memory those
[1:01:53] things
[1:01:54] will take over and cause the body to do
[1:01:56] something it shouldn't do but the
[1:01:58] but the but the human spirit has to
[1:02:01] recognize
[1:02:03] witness when there's a new birth that's
[1:02:06] taken place in you that's why there's a
[1:02:07] change
[1:02:08] that's why there's an there's a visible
[1:02:11] change not that my ugly face is changed
[1:02:13] but that that there's a difference in us
[1:02:17] than when we weren't born again or when
[1:02:20] we weren't what we should have been in
[1:02:22] him even could have been going to church
[1:02:25] it could have been in church for years
[1:02:26] could have been
[1:02:27] baptized a dozen times right right
[1:02:30] but until his spirit comes amen amen
[1:02:33] it's just you just take just go take
[1:02:35] another bath
[1:02:36] right
[1:02:37] go dip in the pool because that's the
[1:02:39] equivalent of it and you can be baptized
[1:02:41] a hundred times doesn't matter right
[1:02:42] when his spirit comes then there's a
[1:02:45] witness to the human spirit and that
[1:02:46] body says it recognizes that and there's
[1:02:48] a change
[1:02:50] amen you're not the person you used to
[1:02:51] be paul said the things i used to love i
[1:02:53] now hate things i used to hate i now
[1:02:55] love why because he was a different
[1:02:57] person
[1:02:58] old things have passed away because
[1:03:00] behold all things have become new that's
[1:03:02] when you recognize that's your sonship
[1:03:05] you recognize i'm a son of god you
[1:03:07] reckon and then you come to a
[1:03:09] recognition that i have always been a
[1:03:11] son of god even when my nose was stuffed
[1:03:14] into the pig trough i was still a son
[1:03:17] i didn't know it right i didn't
[1:03:19] recognize it
[1:03:21] and a lot of me and my human spirit
[1:03:23] didn't want to
[1:03:25] i didn't want to
[1:03:27] i i was a sinner i enjoyed being a
[1:03:30] sinner
[1:03:32] but saints when that recognition come
[1:03:34] very much and i began to realize who i
[1:03:37] really was
[1:03:38] it the world became a miserable place
[1:03:42] amen when i lived in san fran i lived in
[1:03:44] sin
[1:03:45] i did
[1:03:46] but when i become a child of god and
[1:03:48] that recognition hit me that became the
[1:03:51] pig trough that became
[1:03:53] why it's like when when the prodigal son
[1:03:56] came to himself see the bible said he
[1:03:58] came to himself when you come to
[1:04:00] yourself you recognize oh my god
[1:04:04] i'm eating stuff that the hogs won't
[1:04:06] even eat
[1:04:08] i've got my face dipped into something
[1:04:10] that
[1:04:12] but you see where but that's where you
[1:04:14] were you recognized it and then it
[1:04:16] become a stinky filth in your nostril
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:19] because you recognize you're a son of
[1:04:21] god yes that spirit recognizes i'm a
[1:04:24] child of god and then
[1:04:27] and then everything about you your life
[1:04:30] atmosphere who you are how you act where
[1:04:32] you go what you listen to what you do
[1:04:34] what you watch everything change what
[1:04:36] you wear
[1:04:38] everything changed amen because you're a
[1:04:41] different person
[1:04:42] new creature amen because that spirit
[1:04:46] capitalist witness to your spirit
[1:04:49] amen in the human spirit it's the life
[1:04:52] of the body
[1:04:53] we are the children of god
[1:04:56] amen children of god
[1:04:59] and if children now listen this is
[1:05:01] beautiful now
[1:05:02] and if children then heirs
[1:05:05] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:05:10] well let me ask you the question we're
[1:05:12] heirs of god praise the lord we we like
[1:05:15] to hear that that's
[1:05:16] encouragement
[1:05:18] but what is as we can find scripturally
[1:05:21] the inheritance of jesus christ what is
[1:05:24] his inheritance
[1:05:26] well what happened on mount uh
[1:05:28] transfiguration
[1:05:30] god said this is my beloved son hear him
[1:05:33] right
[1:05:35] all power was given unto him in heaven
[1:05:37] and on earth
[1:05:39] that was his inheritance
[1:05:41] praise the lord amen
[1:05:43] hear him
[1:05:45] but now i want you to recognize the
[1:05:46] scripture says we are joint heirs
[1:05:50] with him
[1:05:52] you know if you take a prop
[1:05:55] possession of a property
[1:05:57] uh this basically countrywide if you
[1:05:59] take a a possession this country of
[1:06:01] property there is something called you
[1:06:04] can take joint tenancy
[1:06:06] and a joint tenancy of course now common
[1:06:09] property a man and a wife that's that's
[1:06:11] something that's inherent in the fact
[1:06:13] that you're married right but you can
[1:06:15] take
[1:06:16] uh in this country a property possession
[1:06:20] of a property and the title could be
[1:06:22] joint tenancy
[1:06:24] that means if you took possession of
[1:06:26] this property this building with one
[1:06:29] other individual and you paid for it 50
[1:06:32] 50. this property becomes both of yours
[1:06:36] equally
[1:06:37] 50 50.
[1:06:39] every bit of this property that's owned
[1:06:41] by your partner you own as well
[1:06:45] anything you want to do to this property
[1:06:47] you can do it anything that he does you
[1:06:50] can do it too
[1:06:52] you understand anything that your joint
[1:06:56] tenant does with this property you can
[1:06:59] do it too right right yes understand if
[1:07:02] you want to occupy this building
[1:07:05] if he wants to occupy you can occupy
[1:07:08] it's your building too
[1:07:09] you own this building just as much as he
[1:07:12] does
[1:07:13] i know i'm pushing the envelope a little
[1:07:15] bit friends but i want you to understand
[1:07:16] the bible says that we are joint heirs
[1:07:20] with christ
[1:07:22] what he
[1:07:24] his possession
[1:07:26] is our possession
[1:07:28] what's been allotted to him has been
[1:07:31] allotted to us
[1:07:33] right
[1:07:33] doesn't colossians say all the fullness
[1:07:36] of the godhead bodily uh dwelt in jesus
[1:07:39] christ and that you are complete in him
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:44] well if we're complete in him that means
[1:07:46] that everything that you need is done
[1:07:50] it's finished it's complete complete
[1:07:52] doesn't mean that you need to add some
[1:07:55] more down the road
[1:07:57] complete means it's finished it's
[1:07:59] complete it's it's fulfilled
[1:08:02] jesus said be there for perfect even as
[1:08:05] my father in heaven is perfect
[1:08:08] that is mature full age grown up or
[1:08:12] complete
[1:08:13] that's what he means that's what it
[1:08:14] means
[1:08:15] perfect is complete you are complete in
[1:08:18] him
[1:08:19] praise the lord
[1:08:21] well if we're joint heirs in his
[1:08:23] completeness of that godhead then where
[1:08:26] does that put our
[1:08:28] lives our word
[1:08:30] where does that put that puts you jesus
[1:08:33] one time told peter get thee behind me
[1:08:35] satan
[1:08:36] now i've told you many times that you
[1:08:38] know
[1:08:39] jesus wasn't calling peter satan right
[1:08:42] he was calling the spirit that was on
[1:08:44] peter at the time satan and putting that
[1:08:46] spirit in its place
[1:08:48] because that spirit was saying something
[1:08:50] that was contrary to the word right the
[1:08:53] spirit that was coming out of peter was
[1:08:55] saying something contrary to the word
[1:08:57] and when it's contrary to the word it's
[1:08:59] of the devil right and when jesus saw
[1:09:02] that recognize it he said get thee
[1:09:04] behind me satan well if jesus said get
[1:09:07] thee behind me satan what more would god
[1:09:10] listen to your word when you tell the
[1:09:12] devil the same thing right am i will he
[1:09:15] not yes would god not obey your word in
[1:09:18] that situation now we already understand
[1:09:21] we're in the position of being adopted
[1:09:24] we're in the position that god put us to
[1:09:26] have that faith to believe that who we
[1:09:27] are in him
[1:09:29] amy don't let your mistakes yesterday
[1:09:31] rob it from you
[1:09:33] don't let the faults and failures and
[1:09:35] mistakes you made this past week take
[1:09:38] that faith from you
[1:09:40] believe it
[1:09:42] because no matter if you made a hiccup
[1:09:44] last week you're still a son of god
[1:09:46] you're still a daughter of god you still
[1:09:48] own the rights to this promise of god's
[1:09:51] word
[1:09:52] it's still yours
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:55] god said hear ye him
[1:09:58] amen he didn't tell he didn't just tell
[1:10:00] jesus that for fun he didn't just tell
[1:10:03] brother brown that
[1:10:04] amen that's for all of us that's for the
[1:10:07] bride internationally
[1:10:10] to obey your word
[1:10:12] to listen to you because you
[1:10:14] you are a joint heir with christ
[1:10:18] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:10:20] may be also glorified together
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:24] that sonship places you in that position
[1:10:28] amen that sonship but let me show you
[1:10:30] something
[1:10:32] because of the position of what happened
[1:10:34] in the garden of eden the fall in the
[1:10:36] garden of eden we ended up in a unique
[1:10:38] situation now god knew all things from
[1:10:40] the beginning we know that there was
[1:10:42] nothing that god did that god had
[1:10:44] attributes things he wanted to display
[1:10:46] that he wanted to manifest that he
[1:10:48] wanted to bring forward and we know that
[1:10:50] uh we read in in 1st john chapter 3 last
[1:10:53] week of the past two weeks actually that
[1:10:56] that jesus christ was manifested y'all
[1:10:59] remember what that scripture said why
[1:11:01] does why did first john say jesus was
[1:11:05] manifested or unveiled made known
[1:11:08] why was he made known
[1:11:10] that he might take away what
[1:11:13] sin
[1:11:14] son
[1:11:15] jesus was manifested that he might take
[1:11:18] away our sin
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:21] so let me ask you in the garden of eden
[1:11:23] when god spoke and created a man
[1:11:26] and adam came forth and everything was
[1:11:28] perfect
[1:11:30] he was a true son of god adam was a true
[1:11:32] son of god
[1:11:33] spoken word being of god god took of
[1:11:36] himself put it in adam breathed into him
[1:11:38] the breath of life
[1:11:39] that was that was god that was his
[1:11:41] creation that was something that he
[1:11:43] created he could come and have
[1:11:44] fellowship with
[1:11:45] which he enjoyed very much
[1:11:47] which he still enjoys with his sons and
[1:11:50] daughters very much
[1:11:51] amen so don't neglect that time
[1:11:54] he enjoys that very much he enjoyed that
[1:11:56] there very much now if there had not
[1:11:59] been sin if there had not been a fall
[1:12:02] would there have been a necessity of the
[1:12:04] of the bringing forth of of the son
[1:12:09] of jesus
[1:12:11] where there have been a necessity
[1:12:13] there's no sin
[1:12:15] living in perfection
[1:12:17] living in in a godly atmosphere
[1:12:20] everything is perfect
[1:12:22] no sin
[1:12:24] what the necessity would have
[1:12:25] precipitated to have jesus be brought
[1:12:29] forth begotten into this world
[1:12:34] amen
[1:12:35] he wouldn't have needed to come in our
[1:12:37] kinship i was just quiet
[1:12:40] because
[1:12:50] we understand what that means to us
[1:12:52] right amen but understand what would it
[1:12:55] mean to us if we had if there was never
[1:12:57] a fall
[1:12:58] if there was never sin if there was
[1:13:00] never sin to be taken away
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:04] so let me ask you this and before i read
[1:13:06] this
[1:13:08] when sin is completely annihilated and
[1:13:10] done away with
[1:13:12] what is the necessity
[1:13:14] of that son
[1:13:19] i know it's awful quiet
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:22] but if some if sin is god if he was
[1:13:25] manifested to take away our sin and
[1:13:27] there is no more sin
[1:13:30] what's the purpose of that existence of
[1:13:32] that sonship
[1:13:34] because remember
[1:13:36] sonship not just yours
[1:13:38] not just mine
[1:13:40] but the only begotten son
[1:13:43] ship
[1:13:44] actually began we'll have an end
[1:13:48] because he was manifested for that
[1:13:50] purpose right amen now we know that's
[1:13:53] just an extension of god
[1:13:55] that flesh that that we identified as
[1:13:58] jesus was just human flesh
[1:14:00] god wrapped in that flesh
[1:14:02] we know that
[1:14:04] brother graham said that that flesh was
[1:14:06] the only part of god that could die
[1:14:10] right right
[1:14:11] he talks about
[1:14:14] the catholic church and other churches i
[1:14:16] guess that that reference jesus as being
[1:14:19] the eternal son
[1:14:21] which is contrary just in the just in
[1:14:24] the verbiage
[1:14:26] contrary in the fact that a son is
[1:14:28] something that is begotten
[1:14:30] and anything that's begotten had a
[1:14:32] beginning has an end cannot be eternal
[1:14:35] right now we're back into the eternities
[1:14:38] again
[1:14:39] and identifying
[1:14:41] who we are now we've done that as sons
[1:14:43] and daughters of god
[1:14:45] but who we really are in that seed
[1:14:48] that attribute that intel intellectual
[1:14:50] property that came from god
[1:14:53] that placed that seed in you that is who
[1:14:56] you really are
[1:14:59] then you begin to draw
[1:15:01] from that seed life
[1:15:03] you begin to draw from that holy spirit
[1:15:06] from that god
[1:15:08] from that god light that's where you
[1:15:10] begin to draw from
[1:15:12] you used to draw from when you were in
[1:15:14] the world nasty filthy uh uh
[1:15:17] wiggle worms and everything but when
[1:15:19] that crystal clear water came through
[1:15:21] you begin to draw from a different
[1:15:23] source
[1:15:24] you begin to draw like we talked about
[1:15:26] the soul the soul that sins that soul
[1:15:30] shall die
[1:15:31] but he who is born of god cannot commit
[1:15:35] sin
[1:15:36] you're drawing from a different fountain
[1:15:39] yes you're drawing from a seed life that
[1:15:42] makes you a new creature
[1:15:45] that identifies to you who you really
[1:15:47] are
[1:15:48] amen who you really are in this life as
[1:15:52] a son of god just like adam as a son of
[1:15:55] god
[1:15:56] we've been in the position even in the
[1:15:58] fallen state that we have we've been in
[1:16:01] a position that we that we fellowship
[1:16:04] with god
[1:16:05] that that
[1:16:06] we reject everything in the world
[1:16:09] everything of satan we reject all of the
[1:16:11] ideals and and all things and we accept
[1:16:14] christ as our savior as our lord as our
[1:16:17] god
[1:16:18] we receive it and believe in the
[1:16:20] position that we are as sons and
[1:16:22] daughters of god
[1:16:24] we accept what god has made us and what
[1:16:27] god wants us to see in his word we
[1:16:30] accept that we believe that
[1:16:32] although it's challenging sometimes with
[1:16:34] all the things that goes on in our lives
[1:16:36] and our sticky flesh it it's challenging
[1:16:38] sometimes but we believe that
[1:16:41] we know who we are we know where we
[1:16:42] stand
[1:16:44] so that's the position and we have that
[1:16:46] fellowship that eternal shall i say
[1:16:48] eternal fellowship with god
[1:16:51] now we had that fellowship god wanted
[1:16:53] that fellowship and we still have the
[1:16:55] opportunity the ability the blood of
[1:16:57] jesus christ has
[1:16:59] has
[1:17:00] built that bridge
[1:17:02] back across the chasm again that brought
[1:17:05] man and god back into fellowship
[1:17:07] that precious blood
[1:17:09] bridge that gap so that god and man
[1:17:12] could come back together heaven and
[1:17:13] earth can embrace again
[1:17:15] we can have that relationship again
[1:17:17] that's that's where god wants it to be
[1:17:20] that's who we are amen but when we go
[1:17:22] beyond this mortal reach there is no
[1:17:25] more sin
[1:17:26] where do we stand then amen the son of
[1:17:29] god was created was begotten
[1:17:33] to take away sin
[1:17:35] well when sin is completely annihilated
[1:17:38] let's look at this
[1:17:41] and christ
[1:17:42] revealed in his own word
[1:17:45] he's talking about the bible the bible
[1:17:49] he said it's not a book of systems
[1:17:52] a code of moral ethics
[1:17:54] neither is it a history book or a book
[1:17:57] of theology altogether it is not
[1:18:00] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:18:03] god himself revealed from word to flesh
[1:18:07] that's what he is
[1:18:08] revealed from word to flesh
[1:18:11] amen that logos that came out
[1:18:15] went into that body that was begotten
[1:18:17] from a woman
[1:18:18] sinless spoken word
[1:18:21] came forth sinless to take away our sin
[1:18:24] yes remember he could not take away our
[1:18:28] sin if he was a sinner himself right
[1:18:31] right and if he was born of a of an act
[1:18:35] that was the original sin
[1:18:37] he would have been born in sin shaped
[1:18:39] iniquity come the world speaking lives
[1:18:41] just like the rest of us
[1:18:43] but because he did not and from the womb
[1:18:46] of a virgin came forth as a spoken word
[1:18:49] being god bailed in that flesh
[1:18:53] that begate that made him the begotten
[1:18:56] son
[1:18:57] praise the lord the word that came into
[1:19:01] flesh
[1:19:02] she birthed forth the word that was in
[1:19:04] flesh we'll just say it that way
[1:19:07] what is it the bible is
[1:19:11] the word of god is flesh god
[1:19:14] uh jesus being the flesh it's a
[1:19:17] revelation how god the word was
[1:19:19] manifested in human flesh
[1:19:22] and revealed to us
[1:19:24] and that's why he becomes a son of god
[1:19:27] he is a part of god
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:31] and in that sonship
[1:19:33] as being a
[1:19:35] coming forth as a part of god
[1:19:38] and that sonship is what causes us to be
[1:19:42] joint heirs with him right now we came
[1:19:46] forth in sin he did not
[1:19:49] but we're joint heirs because we came
[1:19:52] forth as kin folk
[1:19:54] he's a kinsmen redeemer to us
[1:19:56] and that's what made us kinfolk
[1:19:59] and and as being kinfocus being a part
[1:20:01] of god in this human flesh is the son of
[1:20:04] god it makes that co-equal
[1:20:08] possible amen in our lives
[1:20:11] that co-equal right praise the lord now
[1:20:14] when jesus spoke something you think he
[1:20:16] believed it
[1:20:18] amen he believed it because why he said
[1:20:21] i'd do nothing unless the father showed
[1:20:22] me first right amen there's that leading
[1:20:25] right that's the leading the holy spirit
[1:20:27] system of this is talking about be led
[1:20:28] of the spirit and that's what it boils
[1:20:30] down to our whole lives of the spirit of
[1:20:32] god that's what it that's what it all
[1:20:34] amounts to really that's what we want
[1:20:36] is to be led of the holy spirit
[1:20:38] so that leading is what led him to
[1:20:41] calvary that leading is what leads us to
[1:20:44] do what do what to do what we do for the
[1:20:47] lord brother adam said she'll she'll
[1:20:49] have thus saith the lord and she'll be
[1:20:51] quiet
[1:20:51] what does that mean that just means
[1:20:53] she'll have the leading of the spirit in
[1:20:55] her life to do as god would have through
[1:20:58] us or she won't do it at all
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:02] so that word is what that that life
[1:21:06] that word that came life is what leads
[1:21:09] us
[1:21:10] what brings
[1:21:12] us through that same position amen as a
[1:21:15] part of god but now look look at this
[1:21:17] now but now it's still the same quote
[1:21:21] the body is a part of god
[1:21:23] so much that it is a son now look how
[1:21:26] he's dividing this the body is that is a
[1:21:30] part of god is in in as much that it is
[1:21:33] a son
[1:21:34] it's like i've said the past couple
[1:21:36] weeks
[1:21:37] my son is an extension of my body as
[1:21:39] much as he is a son
[1:21:42] my son
[1:21:43] amen that's just a natural application
[1:21:46] to spiritual revelation see he's just
[1:21:49] that son the part that body is part of
[1:21:51] god embodies part of me as much as he's
[1:21:54] the son see in that relationship
[1:21:58] he said as a catholic puts it eternal
[1:22:00] son all the rest of churches the word
[1:22:03] don't even make sense there cannot be
[1:22:05] eternal and then be a son
[1:22:08] because a son is something that he's
[1:22:10] begotten from
[1:22:11] now you've already laid the foundation i
[1:22:13] tried to lay the foundation this before
[1:22:15] reading this
[1:22:16] but this is this is where i
[1:22:20] come from amen
[1:22:22] that a son there cannot be eternal and
[1:22:25] then be a son because a son is something
[1:22:28] that's begotten from
[1:22:30] the word eternal he cannot be a son but
[1:22:34] he uh he can be a son but he cannot be
[1:22:37] an eternal son no sir he cannot be an
[1:22:40] eternal son and people will come with
[1:22:42] this and say now wait a minute are you
[1:22:44] saying that jesus christ is not eternal
[1:22:48] the sonship
[1:22:50] notice again the division
[1:22:53] he's god so much
[1:22:55] as he is in that flesh as he is a son
[1:23:00] amen but when you separate that out
[1:23:03] recognize that that
[1:23:06] that son that that
[1:23:08] attribute that was in jesus christ is
[1:23:11] just an attribute of god to be a son yes
[1:23:14] that's all it is
[1:23:15] it's his attribute that he had in the
[1:23:18] great elohim that was that was an
[1:23:20] attribute to be a son
[1:23:23] that's all it did he just took that uh
[1:23:25] intelli intellectual property and put it
[1:23:28] in his own son
[1:23:30] amen but the sonship part
[1:23:35] is not eternal
[1:23:37] that's right it is not eternal that's
[1:23:39] right
[1:23:40] again
[1:23:41] when
[1:23:42] he was manifested
[1:23:44] in other words brought forth
[1:23:46] he was
[1:23:47] he was brought from undercover that that
[1:23:50] sun attribute
[1:23:52] was manifest was was brought in full
[1:23:56] display
[1:23:57] a manifest we talked about a manifest
[1:23:59] before manifest is just something that
[1:24:02] tells you what's inside
[1:24:04] if you have a package sometimes you have
[1:24:06] a packing slip or a manifest a manifest
[1:24:08] package same thing it just tells you
[1:24:10] what's inside the box before you open it
[1:24:13] amen that's just a manifest so a
[1:24:15] manifest is just telling you he was
[1:24:18] manifested
[1:24:20] that we might see him touch him handle
[1:24:22] him
[1:24:23] because he was the son in that flesh so
[1:24:26] much
[1:24:28] of god as it was in that flesh
[1:24:30] but when but when that manifestation was
[1:24:34] to take away sin well when he stood when
[1:24:36] he hung on calvary and said it is
[1:24:38] finished friend he meant it yes
[1:24:42] it is finished what's finished
[1:24:45] everything
[1:24:46] everything
[1:24:48] you can go chronologically you can go
[1:24:49] alphabetically you can go numerically
[1:24:52] you can go whatever way you want to but
[1:24:54] everything that god almighty had
[1:24:55] intended to
[1:24:57] to do to fulfill through the son jesus
[1:25:00] was done
[1:25:02] finished every bit of it up through to
[1:25:05] the introduction again or the the
[1:25:07] entering back into that place of
[1:25:10] eternity
[1:25:12] amen
[1:25:13] we went through this time came out it
[1:25:14] went through eternity remember
[1:25:16] eternity's just
[1:25:17] just a circle there's no beginning and
[1:25:19] ending to it just you know i used to get
[1:25:21] this off easy it won't come off
[1:25:25] they miss some days it does some days it
[1:25:28] doesn't but it's just like that ring you
[1:25:29] get on the edge of that ring and you
[1:25:30] could run around and round and round
[1:25:32] around until you just starve yourself to
[1:25:33] death and die
[1:25:34] because there's no end to it no
[1:25:36] beginning to it no end to it amen which
[1:25:38] signifies my
[1:25:40] commitment to that woman right over
[1:25:41] there
[1:25:42] amen amen from eternity to eternity
[1:25:45] that's my commitment to her
[1:25:47] amen right till death do we part no no
[1:25:50] no only in the flesh
[1:25:52] right only in the flesh do we part but
[1:25:54] that eternal is there it stays it's but
[1:25:57] then there's this little blip that came
[1:25:59] off i could draw it but i don't want to
[1:26:01] mess up what i did yesterday
[1:26:03] they came off into this time element
[1:26:05] this time elements about to blend back
[1:26:07] into eternity again
[1:26:09] when that time element blends back up
[1:26:11] into that place of eternity there is no
[1:26:14] more sin
[1:26:15] sin is annihilated sin is done away with
[1:26:17] it is finished
[1:26:20] done
[1:26:21] that is that sin is annihilated when
[1:26:23] it's done and there is no more sin
[1:26:26] then the sonship cease to exist
[1:26:29] amen it's no it's not eternal
[1:26:32] it'll continue on as long as the
[1:26:33] necessity of it is there and for us as
[1:26:36] sons of god but it won't be eternal
[1:26:40] part of god that same that same
[1:26:42] attribute of god to be son will still be
[1:26:45] there
[1:26:46] amen but the sonship of jesus christ the
[1:26:49] name of christ jesus christ that was put
[1:26:51] on it won't will cease to exist
[1:26:54] amen no sir cannot be an eternal son
[1:26:59] now that he is in the sun is so much as
[1:27:01] the word was in jeremiah it was in moses
[1:27:03] all these words all these uh prophets
[1:27:06] they speak of me all the true divine
[1:27:08] revelation of the word was wound up into
[1:27:10] one human body and god put flesh around
[1:27:13] it
[1:27:14] amen all the fullness of the godhead
[1:27:16] bodily in him
[1:27:18] all that all that god was he poured into
[1:27:20] christ all into that flesh
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:24] but again the part i like we all know
[1:27:26] that amen we give christ his praise and
[1:27:28] his accolade but the part i like is that
[1:27:31] you
[1:27:32] amen are complete in him who has the
[1:27:36] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:27:39] amen we might have an earnest of that
[1:27:42] but oh friend what is our real
[1:27:44] inheritance
[1:27:46] our real inheritance isn't just that
[1:27:48] earnest right amen we're headed to
[1:27:50] something that's greater
[1:27:52] and that's direct that that's the
[1:27:53] acknowledgement that that's the place
[1:27:55] that that that i want us to get to i
[1:27:58] guess through this not not negating our
[1:28:01] sonship here not negating what god has
[1:28:03] done for us and in this life in our
[1:28:05] humanity but understanding friends that
[1:28:08] that there's more in there to who we
[1:28:10] really are
[1:28:12] then sometimes maybe is acknowledged
[1:28:15] that we really are
[1:28:17] not just this
[1:28:19] flesh but who we really are amen down on
[1:28:22] the inside the inside there
[1:28:24] all the divine true revelation the word
[1:28:26] wound up in one human body god put flesh
[1:28:28] around that's the reason he called it a
[1:28:30] son
[1:28:31] reason he refers to father amen why
[1:28:34] jesus brother says just as simple just
[1:28:36] as plain as anything like the nose on
[1:28:39] our face yes
[1:28:40] amen just that plain and simple now
[1:28:47] i want to go to ephesians chapter one
[1:28:56] chapter one
[1:29:00] i know i'm running short on time and
[1:29:02] there's
[1:29:03] no way i'm going to get through this but
[1:29:05] i want to lay out
[1:29:07] what i felt the lord gave me yesterday
[1:29:09] when i was reading i've read brother
[1:29:11] wilson i've read this scripture i'd
[1:29:13] probably
[1:29:17] you see that on my bible
[1:29:20] that is a huge grease spot that's how
[1:29:22] many times i've gone into scripture you
[1:29:25] see that that huge grease spot right
[1:29:27] there is my human
[1:29:29] uh
[1:29:30] oil off of my body that's how many times
[1:29:32] i've gone to this scripture
[1:29:33] but yesterday i was reading and
[1:29:35] something became more plain to me i want
[1:29:38] to share it with you
[1:29:39] at least part of it today anyway
[1:29:41] ephesians 1 1
[1:29:44] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[1:29:46] will of god to the saints which are at
[1:29:48] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[1:29:50] jesus now it has to be that way
[1:29:52] amen it has to be an apostle has to be a
[1:29:55] calling
[1:29:56] of jesus christ has to be of jesus
[1:29:59] christ it has to be by the will of god
[1:30:01] amen not just because somebody has the
[1:30:03] gift of gab or something that they can
[1:30:05] get up in front of people and talk no
[1:30:07] that's not a minister it's got to be of
[1:30:09] christ by the will of god
[1:30:12] it's the only acknowledgement that
[1:30:13] that's recognized in heaven
[1:30:16] people churches might be full of them
[1:30:18] people all over but the acknowledgement
[1:30:21] in heaven by god has to be by the will
[1:30:23] of god yes amen praise the lord to the
[1:30:26] saints richard episode faithful in
[1:30:28] christ jesus grace be to you peace from
[1:30:30] god our father lord jesus christ
[1:30:34] blessed be god blessed be the god and
[1:30:37] father of our lord jesus christ who has
[1:30:39] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:30:42] in heavenly places in christ thank god
[1:30:45] for that
[1:30:46] now the the next verse
[1:30:53] and i just wrote this
[1:30:55] so that it maybe a visual could make it
[1:30:58] a little more plain
[1:30:59] we had elohim the self-existing god he
[1:31:02] wasn't god
[1:31:03] we know that
[1:31:04] god's an object of worship he was god as
[1:31:06] we know god is the almighty but he's
[1:31:08] elohim the self-existing god
[1:31:10] but in the fourth verse
[1:31:12] it says according to
[1:31:15] according as he had chosen us
[1:31:18] he meant when did he choose us
[1:31:21] before the foundation of the world
[1:31:23] that's what it is chose us
[1:31:25] where in him
[1:31:27] so he issued forth his choosing we
[1:31:30] issued forth from the elohim
[1:31:34] because we were in him that's what the
[1:31:36] bible says we were chosen amen issued
[1:31:40] forth from elohim
[1:31:42] chosen by him hand-picked
[1:31:45] praise the lord i like that part
[1:31:48] i like that part i i talk about
[1:31:51] sometimes like a woman or or a man going
[1:31:53] to a grocery store and need to get some
[1:31:55] tomatoes or something especially
[1:31:57] tomatoes oranges and apricots and
[1:32:00] or uh
[1:32:01] avocados but tomatoes
[1:32:03] you know tomatoes can go and bananas
[1:32:05] even but tomatoes a lot of times they
[1:32:07] have those things piled up in a thing
[1:32:09] there and
[1:32:10] you go and you look at them and you
[1:32:11] think wow that's a good looking bunch of
[1:32:13] tomatoes and you go and you really look
[1:32:14] at them you're like oh there's bruises
[1:32:16] on that one and this one and this one's
[1:32:17] squishy on this side and they don't look
[1:32:19] quite as good once you get it close up
[1:32:21] look
[1:32:22] but when you go there you have something
[1:32:24] that you want in mind to do with that
[1:32:26] tomato
[1:32:28] tomato sandwich from the south
[1:32:30] uh i love them my mom loved them
[1:32:33] my mom had to quit eating them because
[1:32:35] she only had one hand and she'd take a
[1:32:36] bite and the whole thing would fall out
[1:32:38] she could when she got older she loved
[1:32:40] tomato sandwiches i do too
[1:32:42] don't hardly have one but i like them
[1:32:45] tacos for you southeastern or
[1:32:48] southwesterners tacos
[1:32:50] tomatoes on tacos whatever it is there's
[1:32:53] a reason you want that and you want the
[1:32:55] perfect tomato
[1:32:57] you want it to fit on that burger just
[1:32:59] right right or in that sandwich
[1:33:01] perfectly you know uh tacos not so much
[1:33:04] sorry but you just dice them up but you
[1:33:06] want it to serve a particular purpose
[1:33:09] amen so if you go into that bin of
[1:33:11] tomatoes and you look at this and there
[1:33:13] may be a hundred 200 tomatoes there
[1:33:16] but there's two or three of them that's
[1:33:17] going to go home with you right and
[1:33:19] they're going to be the two or three
[1:33:21] depending on your time element which you
[1:33:22] might just say one two three especially
[1:33:24] the guys but
[1:33:26] there's three tomatoes that's going to
[1:33:28] suit your purpose the best and you go
[1:33:30] and you look and you might and i see
[1:33:31] women i i don't mean this sexist but
[1:33:34] it's usually women you go and you look
[1:33:36] at the women and they're staying and
[1:33:38] they'll stand there for 10 and 15
[1:33:39] minutes trying to find three tomatoes
[1:33:41] that's true how long does it take to get
[1:33:43] a tomato
[1:33:45] sounds like brother wilson's witness has
[1:33:48] been a
[1:33:50] partner in that
[1:33:51] as i have
[1:33:53] but i like to write tomato too so i
[1:33:55] can't say much
[1:33:56] but you're going there's there's going
[1:33:58] to be three tomatoes that's going to go
[1:33:59] home with you but you're going to
[1:34:01] purposely specifically go and pick and
[1:34:05] man i've seen them they'll go over here
[1:34:06] and they'll look over here they'll go
[1:34:08] around here and they'll elbow you out of
[1:34:10] the way because this over here is the
[1:34:11] perfect tomato that they want
[1:34:13] and you might look at it and say oh i'm
[1:34:15] glad she took that one because you don't
[1:34:17] want it right but it was hand-picked by
[1:34:20] her right or you picked the one this was
[1:34:23] mine and you'll they'll go all over and
[1:34:25] they'll look all around and they'll look
[1:34:26] and tomatoes but eventually they're
[1:34:29] gonna have those two or three whatever
[1:34:30] tomatoes and they're going to take those
[1:34:32] home with them because those were the
[1:34:34] ones that they chose
[1:34:36] they handpicked it was their choosing
[1:34:39] this tomato is going to serve the
[1:34:41] purpose that i need for it to serve in
[1:34:43] my home
[1:34:45] praise the lord
[1:34:46] and god chose chose you saw you in his
[1:34:50] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:34:52] he chose you and said this one is going
[1:34:55] to do exactly what i want him to do down
[1:34:57] there yeah
[1:34:58] amen and he chose you
[1:35:01] he hand picked you
[1:35:03] the family the flesh that you come into
[1:35:05] that was just this time house that we're
[1:35:07] in
[1:35:08] but god chose you the real you down in
[1:35:11] there and placed his own spirit his own
[1:35:14] seed in there
[1:35:15] amen
[1:35:17] then his spirit come and brought it to
[1:35:18] life because he knew
[1:35:20] that you are going to be the one through
[1:35:21] his poor knowledge
[1:35:23] amen i don't have the foreknowledge to
[1:35:25] know how my burger is going to turn out
[1:35:26] but he had the foreknowledge to know
[1:35:29] exactly what it was going to be how it
[1:35:31] was going to turn out and who he needed
[1:35:33] to do it
[1:35:35] and people say i don't know what my
[1:35:37] place is i don't know what i'm supposed
[1:35:38] to do i don't know god must not have it
[1:35:40] god's got something that only you not
[1:35:43] only for you to do but he's got
[1:35:46] something that only you can do
[1:35:50] you're the one that he wants to do it he
[1:35:52] picked you
[1:35:53] he chose you
[1:35:55] he hand chose you for that purpose
[1:35:58] amen
[1:35:59] predestinated in him
[1:36:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:04] what's that predestination that's the
[1:36:06] mind to know i know by foreign knowledge
[1:36:08] who it is but the predestinated says i'm
[1:36:11] gonna take it to my kitchen i'm gonna
[1:36:13] get this knife and i'm gonna cut it just
[1:36:15] so thick and i'm gonna put it this way
[1:36:17] and i'm gonna lay it on a plate or i'm
[1:36:19] gonna put it on that burger and he knows
[1:36:21] exactly that's the predestination this
[1:36:23] is the purpose it's going to serve
[1:36:25] amen and he chose you for that reason
[1:36:29] praise the lord when he chose you though
[1:36:31] he chose you in him before the
[1:36:33] foundation of the world
[1:36:35] before this ball of this big rock was
[1:36:37] ever hung in space he saw you that's
[1:36:40] eternity
[1:36:42] you didn't begin there
[1:36:44] no more than god began there
[1:36:47] we say that so many times just because
[1:36:48] of our human vernacular but you didn't
[1:36:51] begin there he didn't begin there
[1:36:54] you just always were there right
[1:36:56] you didn't know it but you were always
[1:36:58] there just like he's always there yes
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:07] fourth verse still that we should be
[1:37:09] holy
[1:37:11] amen holy
[1:37:12] and without blame
[1:37:14] before him amen now that before him
[1:37:18] means that there's an issue coming forth
[1:37:20] we're coming to this world
[1:37:22] amen that we're supposed to be holy
[1:37:25] where not there here
[1:37:27] before him here
[1:37:30] holy and without blame before him who
[1:37:32] did that christ because he was
[1:37:34] manifested to take away our sin
[1:37:38] when there's no sin it's holiness
[1:37:42] praise the lord
[1:37:43] there's no there's no religion
[1:37:46] there's no legalism right it's just in
[1:37:49] him
[1:37:50] praise the lord that's why god told you
[1:37:53] he knew you would do it
[1:37:55] he knew you'd be the right person
[1:37:58] praise the lord somebody witnessed to
[1:38:00] you one day
[1:38:01] more than likely yeah somebody spoke to
[1:38:04] you maybe even about christ about the
[1:38:06] message somebody spoke to you somebody
[1:38:08] witnesses a reason you're here today
[1:38:10] right
[1:38:11] maybe that was the only person that
[1:38:14] could have spoke to you that would have
[1:38:15] caused you to come and go through your
[1:38:18] life to where you are here this morning
[1:38:21] may have been that one person amen
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:25] i know what might
[1:38:26] when
[1:38:27] uh the things were going on in our
[1:38:29] family
[1:38:30] uh
[1:38:31] you know sometimes
[1:38:33] there's nothing you can say that's gonna
[1:38:34] make a difference
[1:38:36] amen right brother wilson your boys
[1:38:39] something that sometimes it just is just
[1:38:41] absolutely nothing you can say to them
[1:38:42] it's going to make any difference at all
[1:38:44] my prayer became lord you know who it is
[1:38:47] that needs to go and speak to them do it
[1:38:50] for me please
[1:38:51] send the right person right at the right
[1:38:53] time to them
[1:38:55] amen because we always especially
[1:38:58] parents you know always feel like
[1:39:00] we we we're in control we've got to be
[1:39:02] the ones that do it and we're the ones
[1:39:04] to lay down the law blah blah blah
[1:39:07] but you know god has already
[1:39:08] predestinated somebody right to come and
[1:39:11] speak to that person to come and talk to
[1:39:14] them and to help them get back and get
[1:39:16] into the place where they're supposed to
[1:39:18] be
[1:39:19] amen now obviously from that comes the
[1:39:22] spirit of god speaking to them which is
[1:39:24] more prevalent but it had there had to
[1:39:26] be that that beginning place there had
[1:39:29] to be that star before it could get to
[1:39:31] the place to where that spirit began to
[1:39:33] talk to it there had to be that
[1:39:34] willingness amen your son sister teresa
[1:39:37] brother charlie's starting to read the
[1:39:38] bible again there's that place that they
[1:39:41] got to come to
[1:39:42] right to bring them along amen right
[1:39:45] well that predestination sets that in
[1:39:48] place
[1:39:49] it puts that in position so that we we
[1:39:52] fulfill the purpose god called us to
[1:39:55] we're holy
[1:39:56] here now before him without blame before
[1:39:59] him having predestinated us and i'm
[1:40:02] afraid i have to stop here
[1:40:04] predestination
[1:40:06] he predestinated us amen
[1:40:09] unto the adoption of children
[1:40:12] by jesus christ
[1:40:14] to himself
[1:40:16] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:40:18] will so he not only chose us but then he
[1:40:21] predestinated us well there would be no
[1:40:24] predestination
[1:40:26] if there was not a choosing so the
[1:40:28] choosing issues fourth for of the
[1:40:30] predestination choose issues for from
[1:40:33] the choosing
[1:40:35] just like the choosing issued forth from
[1:40:37] the elohim from god we were chosen in
[1:40:40] him and then predestinated
[1:40:43] so he chose us and then he predestinated
[1:40:46] us yes to the adoption to our placement
[1:40:50] to our position amen that's his
[1:40:53] predestination that he put for us
[1:40:56] to that adoption
[1:40:58] by jesus christ by the sonship
[1:41:01] jesus christ but he did it unto himself
[1:41:05] yes praise the lord
[1:41:07] that's why we're predestinated
[1:41:10] all of it
[1:41:11] every bit of everything that we go and
[1:41:13] do it all goes right back to that same
[1:41:16] one god
[1:41:18] it all goes back to that same place amen
[1:41:20] amen like i said everything a few weeks
[1:41:23] ago everything before christ pointed to
[1:41:26] calvary
[1:41:27] everything behind it is pointed back to
[1:41:29] it because that's the point that's the
[1:41:32] pinnacle that's the place amen as a
[1:41:35] believer as a as a child of god that's
[1:41:37] that's where it all lies amen they back
[1:41:40] here they didn't know it maybe they were
[1:41:42] looking to that
[1:41:44] we as believers look back at that yes
[1:41:47] and we see but he's not there anymore
[1:41:49] he's here praise the lord but without
[1:41:52] that where would any of us be
[1:41:55] amen i hate
[1:41:57] that
[1:41:58] you know it
[1:41:59] it's hard that my savior my lord my god
[1:42:02] had to go through that
[1:42:04] i tell i told you before i've seen the
[1:42:05] passion one time
[1:42:07] uh for all the way through brother
[1:42:09] brother wilson i saw it with brother
[1:42:11] jewell thorning we came preached for us
[1:42:12] up in the mountains we went to a theater
[1:42:14] and watched her when he came out me and
[1:42:15] joy set next and that's the only time
[1:42:18] every time he was scourged i jumped in
[1:42:20] my seat
[1:42:21] i bought the video i was intended i was
[1:42:23] going to watch it have it hadn't been
[1:42:25] able to watch it since i've started it
[1:42:27] two or three times and it gets to that
[1:42:29] certain point and i just can't watch it
[1:42:31] anymore
[1:42:32] it just it just
[1:42:34] just something about it i just have been
[1:42:36] unable to get past that
[1:42:38] but i thank god that he did it though
[1:42:40] i'm so thankful he went through it and
[1:42:43] he did it for me yes
[1:42:47] but i can't watch it but i'm so glad he
[1:42:49] did it amen
[1:42:52] yes
[1:42:53] because it was in him
[1:42:55] that i was predestinated
[1:42:57] by
[1:42:59] uh
[1:43:00] that children by jesus christ now notice
[1:43:03] we're not children to jesus christ
[1:43:05] children by jesus christ that's why
[1:43:07] we're heirs in joint heirs where the
[1:43:09] children of god were the bride of christ
[1:43:12] amen so
[1:43:14] it doesn't say that we're children to
[1:43:16] christ with children by christ
[1:43:19] by that blood but what he did there made
[1:43:22] us sons and daughters of god yes praise
[1:43:25] the lord through the annihilation of sin
[1:43:28] yes
[1:43:29] according to my good pleasure
[1:43:32] to what i want to do
[1:43:34] how i want to live my life to where i
[1:43:36] want to go
[1:43:37] to my worst no no no
[1:43:39] not my will your will
[1:43:41] to his will and that's where a lot of
[1:43:43] people get confused they think that
[1:43:45] they've been set free and liberated like
[1:43:47] we talked about wednesday night
[1:43:49] set free and liberate to do what we want
[1:43:50] to do just live however we want be
[1:43:52] whatever no no he didn't come to
[1:43:54] liberate us for that purpose he came and
[1:43:56] liberated us to serve him
[1:43:58] praise the lord amen amen
[1:44:01] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:44:03] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:44:06] beloved
[1:44:07] and now i guess we'll just have to
[1:44:10] but
[1:44:11] as you can see my little drawing i have
[1:44:15] paul laid it out here no wonder brother
[1:44:18] talked about the ephesian church being
[1:44:19] the most mature church
[1:44:22] just in the first chapter and how he
[1:44:24] lays this out from the great elohim of
[1:44:26] god to choosing of us before the
[1:44:28] foundation of the world into the
[1:44:30] predestination
[1:44:31] give us a revelation who we are to the
[1:44:34] end of time and our inheritance right
[1:44:36] back to him again
[1:44:38] amen all goes right back to him again
[1:44:41] praise the lord
[1:44:43] and that's and that's fine with me
[1:44:45] because that's where i want to be
[1:44:46] anyway all right praise the lord let's
[1:44:48] stand if we could
[1:44:52] that's exactly where i want to be anyway
[1:44:53] so thank god for that am i

[1:45:02] i thank god that he showed us
[1:45:05] that he's made us who we're supposed to
[1:45:07] be in him
[1:45:09] we're playing out the part that god
[1:45:11] called for us from before the foundation
[1:45:13] of the world

[1:47:44] that anchors our soul

[1:47:47] part of who we are if it's not a
[1:47:48] revelation amen it's got to be a part of

[1:50:40] real to you when you believe it that

[1:51:20] thank the lord for his mercy now i
[1:51:22] wanted to mention to you that there will
[1:51:24] be we will have service here wednesday
[1:51:26] night it's my birthday but i i want to
[1:51:29] have service so
[1:51:31] no other place i'd rather be on my
[1:51:33] birthday right so
[1:51:34] amen so we will have service here
[1:51:36] wednesday night seven o'clock um but uh
[1:51:39] there is
[1:51:40] i want to let you know that i found out
[1:51:43] that there is going to be harmony this
[1:51:45] year and it's going to start
[1:51:48] on the
[1:51:50] second wednesday of the month i think
[1:51:52] like the 13th or 14th somebody knows
[1:51:55] dates better than 12.
[1:51:57] start on wednesday the 12th
[1:52:00] that sounds right sister yeah um
[1:52:04] i've been meaning to announce this and i
[1:52:06] forgot thank you
[1:52:09] so it starts winning wednesday nights
[1:52:11] the 12th and it goes just like
[1:52:14] it did before the wednesday night is i'm
[1:52:16] guessing they're going to play a tape uh
[1:52:18] thursday night friday night saturday
[1:52:20] night and sunday afternoon singing at
[1:52:23] the tucson tabernacle
[1:52:25] not at the hotel like it used to be
[1:52:28] wow i yeah i'm not sure everybody's
[1:52:31] gonna fit or if everybody's even gonna
[1:52:33] come
[1:52:34] uh imagine kovit might keep some people
[1:52:36] away the fact that it's that the
[1:52:38] tabernacle will probably keep some
[1:52:39] people away
[1:52:42] that's sad but true
[1:52:44] sorry i i don't you know and there's so
[1:52:48] little parking i don't know how to have
[1:52:49] a problem for three or four hundred
[1:52:51] people
[1:52:52] uh anyway i want you to announce it to
[1:52:55] let you know so i now will be announcing
[1:52:58] it goes along even though
[1:53:00] they'll probably have a tape
[1:53:02] uh we'll cancel that just just
[1:53:05] to be christian
[1:53:07] for the wednesday night to go i'm not
[1:53:09] saying that i would be able to go or
[1:53:11] that i will go
[1:53:12] but
[1:53:13] for those who would like to go
[1:53:15] and just to be a brother to dismiss our
[1:53:17] service in lieu of that on wednesday the
[1:53:20] 12th we will not have january 12th we
[1:53:22] will not have service here but remember
[1:53:24] the harmony uh go if you can pray for me
[1:53:27] if you can't or pray for me the way and
[1:53:29] um just
[1:53:31] i'm not sure how the semantics are going
[1:53:33] to work out but
[1:53:34] they usually have a
[1:53:36] huge orchestra in that and i'm assuming
[1:53:38] i believe that wmo's still going to be
[1:53:40] involved in it yes
[1:53:42] that's what i thought so
[1:53:45] anyway so the 12th
[1:53:47] through the wednesday the 12th through
[1:53:49] the following sundays harmony is tucson
[1:53:50] tabernacle
[1:53:52] as it gets closer i'll tell you the
[1:53:53] times i don't you can look at all my
[1:53:55] lines if you want to but um
[1:53:57] there's different times there'll be a
[1:53:59] minister's meeting uh that friday the
[1:54:02] 14th
[1:54:04] uh that i plan to attend
[1:54:07] so
[1:54:08] and brother roger we're going to cancel
[1:54:11] work for that day to attend the
[1:54:12] ministers meeting and it's going to be a
[1:54:14] caleb's church
[1:54:17] kind of
[1:54:18] uh
[1:54:19] i kind of prefer that a neutral site not
[1:54:22] that it's a caleb's i if it was at the
[1:54:24] tabernacle
[1:54:25] or here i would rather it be
[1:54:27] at a neutral site i think that just
[1:54:30] kind of lends a little
[1:54:31] better when it's at a neutral site but
[1:54:33] it it's okay anyway
[1:54:35] but it's supposed to be the minister's
[1:54:37] meeting is supposed to be the 14th so i
[1:54:39] know that doesn't involve
[1:54:41] really much of any of you um but if you
[1:54:45] uh would pray for us
[1:54:46] that's the main thing pray for us i
[1:54:48] still plan to go we me and brother
[1:54:50] rogers been to the first two or three
[1:54:52] of phoenix and and it's been good
[1:54:55] so uh we'll try the lord willing we plan
[1:54:57] to be at that so
[1:54:59] amen
[1:55:01] thankful the lord blessed us amen i take
[1:55:03] you all out to lunch brother green we
[1:55:04] don't have furs anymore
[1:55:07] hardly any of you liked it but uh we
[1:55:09] went
[1:55:10] but we don't have furs and
[1:55:13] uh
[1:55:14] i shouldn't say i don't have them i
[1:55:16] probably have the money to pay for
[1:55:17] everybody not a long one
[1:55:20] but
[1:55:21] uh but anyway we love you all appreciate
[1:55:23] you very much amen
[1:55:26] we'll be dismissed
[1:55:28] i want to add that
[1:55:29] brother brother green shared a testimony
[1:55:32] that brother brown gave him
[1:55:34] and that was
[1:55:36] that brother brown said that these
[1:55:37] people there
[1:55:39] he saw that people would be leaving
[1:55:41] tucson tabernacle for whatever their
[1:55:44] reasons were and everybody has different
[1:55:46] reasons
[1:55:47] he said
[1:55:49] brother green he said they're going to
[1:55:51] all come back
[1:55:54] they're all coming back one day
[1:55:56] and that may be exactly what it was
[1:55:58] even though brother's not here anymore
[1:56:00] which precipitates my i'm sorry to leave
[1:56:02] you standing but i felt compelled to say
[1:56:04] this um
[1:56:06] i mentioned wednesday night
[1:56:08] um
[1:56:09] about
[1:56:12] being in bondage of having
[1:56:14] uh worshipping
[1:56:16] the the image of a god a church a pastor
[1:56:19] or a memory of a pastor
[1:56:21] and some of you may have saw my
[1:56:24] you know consternation i guess after
[1:56:26] that i was but honestly
[1:56:29] and i'll say this before god
[1:56:32] i said it before i knew i'd said it
[1:56:34] and i absolutely had nobody or no church
[1:56:37] or no pastor in my mind when that came
[1:56:39] out of my mouth
[1:56:41] so i hope i didn't offend anybody um
[1:56:44] that was not my intention but i'm not
[1:56:46] going to apologize because like i said
[1:56:48] it was out of my mouth before i knew it
[1:56:49] was sick
[1:56:52] and again before god and i told my
[1:56:54] family afterwards i said i
[1:56:56] had nobody in my mind there was nobody
[1:56:59] no church no pastor no
[1:57:01] pastor that's gone on for the green or
[1:57:03] otherwise that was in my mind when that
[1:57:05] came out not at all so i
[1:57:08] i hope that didn't offend anybody so and
[1:57:11] had no direct purpose to anyone or
[1:57:14] anything like that so anyway i just
[1:57:16] wanted to make sure i cleared the air
[1:57:18] that's why i'm not apologizing because
[1:57:20] i'm not going to apologize if i felt the
[1:57:22] lord said
[1:57:25] and it doesn't negate the fact that what
[1:57:27] what was said is true
[1:57:29] what it said was still true
[1:57:32] so i don't want to take that back either
[1:57:34] but i wanted to make sure i didn't hurt
[1:57:35] anybody or offend anybody and let you
[1:57:37] know that i had no i had no body in mind
[1:57:41] or anything so anyway so just so you
[1:57:44] know that's before god that's the honest
[1:57:46] truth
[1:57:48] remember that for your family
[1:57:50] at last um brother brown yes please do
[1:57:54] thank you that should have been a prayer

[1:59:51] graveside was thursday so please
[1:59:53] remember that family and
[1:59:55] all the families and this intertwined so
[1:59:57] many people and so many families that
[1:59:59] were intertwined with them so remember
[2:00:01] them in prayer too
[2:00:04] did you have something
[2:00:05] yes um
[2:00:06] that a
[2:00:08] wave of tornadoes that had six states
[2:00:11] there's got to be some believers in that
[2:00:14] crowd
[2:00:15] and the bible teaches us to pray
[2:00:17] especially for the household of faith
[2:00:20] and
[2:00:21] mayfield kentucky was totally devastated
[2:00:24] i saw it on the news i couldn't help but
[2:00:27] just go to the lord and pray
[2:00:29] and um
[2:00:30] you know we don't experience it but it
[2:00:33] it's devastating and we need to pray for
[2:00:35] those people
[2:00:37] or pray the souls will get saved through
[2:00:39] that sure
[2:00:41] amen
[2:00:42] and in an area that they don't typically
[2:00:45] expected or prepared for that too but
[2:00:47] you know kansas nebraska that's a little
[2:00:49] different but
[2:00:51] tennessee and coming through arkansas
[2:00:53] it's just not something that they
[2:00:54] normally deal with so i've heard up to
[2:00:56] 100 people died
[2:01:02] i get so focused on uh on this a lot of
[2:01:06] those things leave me so
[2:01:08] i appreciate y'all mentioning that for
[2:01:10] me
[2:01:12] anything else
[2:01:14] god bless you amen again thank you for

[2:01:49] that he suffered yes we're
[2:01:53] constantly continually
[2:01:55] being made more subject to you and more
[2:01:58] yielded to you
