well amen all is at peace all does at rest anybody that doesn't believe that the Lord has everything under control is just not a person of faith but I believe that God has everything under control amen amen I believe God it's all in God's hands and as he desires to do he will amen he's told us that the heart of our leaders is in his hands and he can direct them in whichever direction he wants to so it's all in God's hands I trust him I absolutely refuse to live in fear really I mean I never have been a person to fear not gonna be down a man even though it's strange standing up here to a bunch of empty seats it's a little different but I know that you're there and that you're listening to us and just trust and pray that what the Lord says today will be a blessing amen I'm very thankful for all the prayers and all the thoughts and encouragement that each one of you gave during this time of bereavement and mourning for my mother still kind of hard to I still have a hard time gladly grasping that that she's gone to the other side now but again it's all in God's plans and it's prayers and support of you precious Saints and different ones that really help them make the difference to us so I certainly do appreciate your patience and your love and your prayers and contributions and things that you gave to us and help Sonja and mica and Tabitha and the grandkids come out and be a part of the celebration of my mother's life so we love you and appreciate you so much and glad to be back home glad to be back in Tucson and glad be with you folks hopefully before long we'll find a way to get together amen I miss you it's it's good to have a service here today we'll just take some time and just trust the Lord will feed us of his word but you know it's just not the same the Bible says to gather with those of like precious faith to gather together even if that much more as we see the Day approaching and boy don't we see that Day approaching it is at the door the things that we used to say are coming we can now say our here now there are others still coming there's other things to happen and we know that they're unfolding and unfolding probably quicker than we could have imagined a member we're a part of it and we know and looking to very soon for this brother the Lord Jesus to be taken home in a rapture and that's my Hall desire I have a scripture reading I want for you to read at your home I would say when you go home but most of you are at home we're not gonna I'm not going to read it right now the two people here grabbing their Bibles I'm not gonna read it now I want you to read it at home reading it when you get a chance Psalms 56 11 it's become quite a motto of mine lately as I've been under these circumstances and living through these additions and things that we've done while we were in North Carolina and then had fly back to Tucson and underneath the umbrella of the possibility of closing down Airlines and closing down state borders and all these other things and I just pray Lord get us home and so I'm thankful that he did praise the Lord I was asking some brothers last night or brother and sister last night and asked other people for so water shirt water message people going to do now that we can't go to restaurants and eat that seems to be most of the thing that we do we gather together we go to restaurants we spend time to break bread nothing wrong with that it's very scriptural we break bread and set together and have oh ship and I will admit it's been a couple two or three weeks and I miss it very dearly and miss you all very dearly so we just want to do what the lords put her on a heart to do what the pastor of the Holy Cross Church here that we rent from has done for us and Micah and all his efforts and the equipment and everything and exactly being here to lead a couple of song service I just didn't we could have done it without song service and just didn't feel I just didn't feel right I just I felt like we needed to have some kind of solemn service something to till that ground to get ready for the scene so I appreciate brothers that coming and singing to an empty congregation except for sister matisse who also sang for you and appreciate Micah playing for us today it's unusual times that we live in but we knew unusual times were coming friends we we knew by the scripture by what brother Branham taught us that unusual times were going to come we didn't know who of us would be alive to see these things unfolding but we happen to be a part of that generation that we see these things so the unfolding are beginning to unfold I guess more rapidly actually so we are a part of it and just put our shoulder to the wheel and do what we can for the Lord Jesus and hopefully for too long we just get past this point we can all come together and be together in fellowship again around God's Word you know brother Branham said many many years ago and I've said it several times I actually said it last Sunday when I was ministering for vaio the pastor brother Richard Boatwright in North Carolina said you know we might not have this opportunity and be able to meet like this together again and we sure come to fruition amen I don't believe that church doors are closed but it sure come to fruition that you know each day each week is unfolding things that you know I guess people a lot of people in the world in this country might never thought was going to happen the history over a few hundred is quite outstanding considering a hundred times more people that died from the flu in the United States every year but it's all for a reason it's all for a purpose and again I believe it's all in God's hands we're going to continue to press about it hey man I'm continued to do what the Lord to put on a heart now we left off last time but don't forget your scripture reading to Psalms 56 11 don't forget that I've got another one too but that I'm gonna want to give to you today but we had ended up last time on the mysteries of Christ in God or myth Christ the mystery God revealed and finally got that mystery and the singularity of that mystery that's hidden Jesus and the necessity of revelation to bring about the understanding of mystery in our in the scripture and in our lives but when I was praying on it and and I I sent you all the text and told you there was some things I was going to do today that the Lord stopped me from doing and I'll explain it all to you later when we can talk lip to ear but I just want you to know that there's some things that that I want to talk to you about that that kind of switched me and changed my gears if you will and I'm I had on my heart from the beginning of the year to enter into a series it's not going to be long Lord willing but enter into something of teaching to bring us into the Easter time so that's what I want to start on today is getting into this particular subject that will bring us into Easter time made by the grace of God we can meet together at Easter but if we can't then we'll be here doing the bidding of the Lord so that's what we want to do so we want to start on this today so I want to go into Romans chapter 8 and begin with verse 28 and that's where I want to start Marini today we'll get to the board here in a little bit it won't be anything that most of youth not only be haven't already seen but sometimes I like to bring up an illustration it makes a little plainer but we're going to go to Romans chapter 8 verse 28 I'm going to begin to talk about being justified or justification so as we find that in the scripture now let's just bow our heads if we could you at home forward prayer Lord Jesus father were so thankful today God that you give us again another beautiful day to come to worship you and expect you Lord once again to speak to our hearts and lives Lord may you take control over us Lord may you can take control over my lips of our spirit Lord anoint us wherever we are God we don't have to be in these four walls for you to comment for your anointing to be powerful and the supernatural to enter into our living rooms our homes wherever we are and Lord we believe in the name of Jesus Christ that you keep us healthy and strong and purposeful for your glory and honor God for Lord we know that what we do we do for you and lord I pray that God is you do for us we continue to press this battle and continue to stay on the frontlines of this war that we're at with the devil and all of the things that's happening in this world today god we know that there's chaos going on around going through the airport seeing people everywhere with gloves and masks and just reminded me of what a world of fear looks like when people don't have God I'm so thankful that we have you Lord Jesus you can be our mask you can be our gloves gifts Lord you had job hedged about Lord and he was perfectly impenetrable until you let it down when you let it down you let it down for a reason and Lord Joe come to find out that reason and it meant something to him and I believe it does to us today so keep us edged about Lord from all the things that's going on in this world and the diseases and afflictions Lord we will not be afraid we thank you God for your word and for the revelation of your word and for opening this to us once again we committed to you and ask your blessings upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ move upon every request every need and the people they're listening in at home that we commit them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord let's read Romans beginning Romans eight beginning with the 28th verse now and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and then and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him also freely give us all things who shall blame who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies you can be seated if you like a man if you're standing at home those here in the congregation Amen and wherever it is in the comforts of your home now this scripture reading is very familiar scripture reading to all of us I've read it many many times I actually put the scripture reading in my book I think it's a very paramount scripture reading that we have to understand the things that God does for and in our lives and of course working all things together for our good but once you get past the part of understanding that God allows things to happen in our lives that will work together for our good if we love him doesn't work if we don't love him now if we have a passing fancy for the Lord we just have some sort of affinity for the Lord it doesn't work but if you love God the way he loves us in you know love then it will work so regardless of what comes regardless what comes may go God always works those things together for those that love him and I believe that we love the Lord we stand together love the Lord according and we do that because it's according to his purpose there's the rub that a lot of people have a lot of people want the things that happen in their lives and things that happen in the world they want it to be according to their purpose and not according to God's purpose they wanted to be fulfilling their desires who are fulfilling their purpose or fulfilling their will we're not here to fulfill our will we're here to fulfill the will of the Lord we're wilded we're here to do the beating in the will of the Lord not by our bidding not our own will but his purpose we are called to his purpose for whom he did foreknow when the foreknowledge of God he did all and also did predestinate so we see that predestination is by foreknowledge to be conformed we are to be conformed to the image of his son there's a way that confirmation that conforming takes place something has to happen in our lives that brings that conforming it doesn't just happen by the snap of a finger it doesn't just happen by God coming and beating you over the head with a baseball bat it comes with a willing subject who desires the things of God the willing heart God can move on a willing heart God can do something with and it has to be somebody that has a willing heart to do it we'll see in our picture drawing here in just a few minutes takes a willing heart for some for God to move on someone's life he did predestinate he called that he might be the first let's go back scuse me to be conformed to the image of his sons we're to be conformed to the image confirms all iock situation that many brethren it wasn't just Jesus once all that was in Jesus but all that was in Jesus is now poured in his bride poured in his people poured in his chose imported he's bought poured into his predestinated and those are the ones that come to the conforming of the image of Jesus Christ those are the ones that God has brought to the place the predestination to them he is called he is to whom he is called he is also justified and now that's the first step of this confirmation being justified is the first place of getting to so that this conforming can take place to them that are justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now what a major or look at that were justified now I know probably in message ranks people don't think very highly about listening to a message of justification oh that was that was Luther's message Luther came with a message of justification very true but that message of justification rolled over into the message of sanctification by Wesley and the justification sanctification rolled over into the new the the restoration of the gifts and the new birth bringing in the this last day of the time with this bride is going is conforming into his image to go into a rapture and the image of Jesus Christ who is the word is what this word what this people what this bride is becoming we're becoming the word becoming conformed into that image if you're conforming to the image of Jesus Christ you're conforming to the word because that's not that's what the word does justifying is the beginning of that of that conforming you have to be justified first now as we know brother man talked about justification to being justified that's the first work of grace that's the beginning of it see but that justification is very important to understand brother Branham brings it in reference to the church ages and the church being justified as a whole as a part of the at the bride of Jesus Christ down through the ages that justification was was the church being justified as that church was justified that church wedded to sanctification that church went into the Holy Ghost it took one step at a time but now for each individual we each individual have to cross the same path that that church does but first be justified and if you've been justified and you've been sanctified and you have the Holy Ghost and you've been born again and filled with the Spirit of God then that puts you in relationship or one with Jesus Christ now that doesn't when God justifies you you're justified we'll talk about that justification in a minute and excuse me I meant to I meant to start this as a recording here I still was planning on recording this as I normally do for anybody that would want to CDs or something like that but I wanted to do that but in justification to be justified there's there's people that reach the place of this justification now that's the beginning it's not the end but if you receive sanctification let's say you've been justified and you get sanctified but you don't throw justification out the door just because you've reached a place of sanctification doesn't do away with justification in your life just because you reach the place of being born again and filled with the Spirit of God you don't throw away justification you don't throw away sanctification those are all still apart you say oh that's that that's that that's old news we've we've been born to give it's you had to be justified before you can become Lord again and if you don't understand what justification means in your life and how poor it it is it was so important brother branham took a very prominent part of a service in 1919 sixty-five to explain it to us that they must have been pretty important he didn't leave it off he brought it on with us that we could understand where we're standing in Jesus Christ this helps us to understand just justification helps us understand who we are in Christ if we can't get to the place if we know who we are then were we going to be were just we're just following around in this world just slopping around in the world just going about our daily lives but friend I'm ready to go home I've got more on the other side now believe now the other side I got here as far as natural life birth I got a son I got a dad a mom and my brother and my sister and different ones they're all said they're waiting on me I told my mama said Wednesday night when I got to see her before she passed next morning I said now make sure y'all gonna have too big of a homecoming without me now I'm not too far away just hold on for me I'll be there won't be too long have a nice celebration enjoy one another but don't have too big a family review just yet I'm coming just be a little patient but it but to understand that we want to get to that place begins with this single step of justification to whom he called he justified let me just spot them he also glorified now can you be justified without being sanctified absolutely can you be justified and sanctified without having the Holy Ghost absolutely right I think that's one of the worst danger spots that there are yes brother branham tells us and that's where Judas was he was but he was between sanctification and and the Holy Ghost because he couldn't go to the upper room never enter the upper room killed himself but he was stuck in that position between sanctification and Holy Ghost you can absolutely be justified righteous sanctified cleaned up before before having the Holy Ghost but the justification the justification doesn't go away just because you've been born again mm-hmm amen justification is is it is just like sanctification is a perpetual working of our daily lives justification and sanctification continue to work in our lives every day now I took this subject because I want to talk about something the Lord willing in a probably next week that that that brother Ram said and that brother hadn't brought up that was that's kind of controversial and some people have misunderstood or not as good or even misinterpreted in my humble opinion what he meant by what he said that's a little teaser for you I'm not going to get in that today Lord willing next week I want to just laid the foundation of justification for right now those he called he justified let me justified you glorified and what shall we say then if God be for us who can be against us you go down who can lay anything to the charge listen them who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified if you were in God and God has justified you he has cleans your slate justified means let me just look it up here for you just a minute I got it pulled up justify in the Greek is to be freed amen to be liberated to be freed to have that that that burden of sin taken off of you because Jesus died to take that sin off of you to be free to be liberated to be righteous amen you understand you can't be righteous without being justified but being justified puts her of righteousness with God now there's more to it there's of course the growing from there but that's the place of righteousness that God wants us to be because justification is what takes that sin from you justification is what takes the sin off of you that's what relieves you of all of your wrongdoing and all of your past sin and all of the things that we make mistakes we make today the the mistakes we made today God cleanses through his blood by the process of justifying you and the only way we can be justified by faith you've got to believe it it's got to be by faith mine isn't that just becoming quite a separation point now between between having faith and not having faith now I believe in using wisdom by the grace of God we use wisdom in all this right that's why we just have what we got here now we use wisdom and everything that we do a lot of the wisdom that is given is practical use things like the pamphlet that Micah gave to us couple weeks ago is practical use things it's washing your hands and staying clean and staying sanitary and things like that no don't going over the top to do things even Micah was telling me who we were in North Carolina we stayed in a hotel and of course restaurants were closed so we had to go get food and bring it and eat in the lobby oh because we hate the lobby instead of going all the way upstairs we just go to the bathroom there in the lobby and mike was telling me one time then he went to go wash his hands and he was coming out or there was another guy coming out that somebody had been in the restroom there and had used facilities and did not wash his hands before he left the restroom when I mean outside of that being just horribly disgusting it gross why under the conditions that we're living now would you leave the restroom without washing your hands as people still do it but it's just common sense stuff washing your hands being sanitary dude doing things that that keep it clean I guess we're going to end up like the Chinese into this bow at each other we can't we're not supposed to shake hands anymore I don't know if I'll ever get to that place that's too much of a habit of mine to shake people's hands I think that's one of the friendliest gestures humanity's known is shaped in persons hands but the Chinese they always bow to each other Chinese and Japanese that's what they do so we have to keep that distance but the strange thing about it is that Chinese practice the bowing and that's where all the viruses come from explain that to me justification to be righteous to be righteous you have to know that you are the righteousness of Jesus Christ to render righteous or such as he ought to be and think about that we've made that statement here many times not reading the definition of justification but the state of someone and how they ought to me to be in here ought to be condition what does it mean to be in here ought to be condition it means that you're in the place spiritually or God saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world before sin ever entered in the camp before the fall of the Garden of Eden God had you in his mind and that perfect place that perfect position that God saw you is exactly where God is taking us back to because that's who we really are we're not this sinful shell of a human that God put us in these time bodies we are that righteous holy person the seen of God that he's put in us that he saw us before the foundation of the world justification brings us into that vision justification brings us into that place where we can truly see what God has done for us who we are in him for the righteousness of Jesus Christ it puts us in our ought to be condition now does that do away the stickiness of this flesh absolutely not no sir we still have the stickiness of the flesh still good are we gonna be dealing with that until the the to wit the redemption of these bodies right that's that's the only thing is gonna change it's still gonna be stinky yes amen but we're still that doesn't change the fact of what God has done the stickiness of your flesh does not nullify justification it doesn't do away with the fact that when God justified you he wipes your slate clean he made you what he saw you before the foundation of the world that's justification that's wiping it all clean now I'm gonna turn this around forgot my board so I'm sorry but fortunately I found one that they had here I found a board that they had here in the back I guess teach the kids that I couldn't have them you see that we have the body spirit and soul again that I draw this is one of my favorite teachings if you will that I that I like to get into because to me this explains a lot then this shows a lot too to us that it can be revealed to us where we are and the separation of Understanding between the soul and the spirit of the body it brings things in a greater light but now in the soul we can look and brother brown one time drew the human heart and when we're born we're born in this condition now I know that doesn't look like it but that's supposed to be a snake so you know me I'm not an artist but it helps us see that the condition that were born in and who we are today we were born with a snake nature now I want to go to another scripture before we get fully into that and fusions chapter 2 just again lay that foundation of justification to lay that foundation of what God has done for us and where it has put us if you've been justified you've been justified by God it's God that justify us we just read that other people may desire to or want to dig up sins from the past things you may have done wrong but that's the devil God does God's not the shovel business God's not the digging business God's in the saving business God's in the healing business and that's what he does so if you want to lay charge do anything of God's elect then you've got to talk to my boss about that but let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 Ephesians 2:1 and you had the quickened that is made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins so you were dead in your trespasses and sins but now you've been made alive wherein in time past in your old life you walked according to the course of this world we all did it that's how we were born according to the Prince of the power of the air Satan the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so there's those that are still of the disobedience those that are led by the devil to do the bidding of Satan among whom also we all had our conversation in time pass in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind which is the Spirit of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath so I want you to see that Spitzer brings in few this drawing now let's read the third verse again among them also we all had our Commerce the loss of our flesh the body the outer man fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind the spirit brings in the the second person in our try unity of our our beans desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Raptor where's your nature your nature's in your soul your nature is the sole objective the your soul is the nature of your spirit your spirit is the life of your body so by so by fulfilling the desires of the flesh the body and the mind the spirit and we're by nature in your soul the children of Wrath so your very desire in your soul the very desire of your heart but that state nature was to do wrong was to be children of disobedience to lie steal cheat whatever attributes you can put to what scene is which is just unbelief that snake nature is what we are all born with if you're one of us were born with that sake that snake nature our nature commanded us to live our nature commanded us to steal our nature commanded us to do things that were against God in his word you see a little kid many parents the experience is probably every parent has experienced this your child is old enough you may have done this with you a child not a celeb over break some on the floor mom and dad comes in and says Johnny who broke that lamp I don't know but what do you mean you don't know you're the only one here here our only child there's no other human in the building but broke it I don't know that's just just nature to do he's lying he knows he's lying but it because he's conscious of that because the spirit makes in conscience of the fact that he's not telling the truth - he's old enough but that conscious there is nothing in a place to understand ready for cousin of what he's doing and and just like but he's born that way we were all born that way we're all born to lie it came from my very desire from that very snake nature to lie to steal to cheat I mean you said well a squirrel came through the door and ran up on the table and knocked the lamp over ran back out the door nobody taught him to do that hopefully nobody told him to do that hard to tell nowadays the parents but hopefully nobody told him to do that it didn't why is this in his nature to live and just who he is to light happens for the fall in the beginning we're all born by nature the children of Wrath that's what our nature taught us to do and our nature which is our sole natures itself out to the Spirit which is our conscience imagination reason affection memory it affects that spirit which is the life of the body which comes into our see taste fuel smell in here the context of this world all of that just runs in continuity together now when you become a Christian does the same thing run some continuity with every bit of it when that nature has changed and God comes in your heart let's just draw another than you won't believe that now when when God comes in there then the same thing happens if God's nature's in there and that seed that is in there that little dots to see you God pure born to you predestinated foreknowledge we just read it here the foreknowledge predestination your predestinated you're gonna come to that place to understand that seat is in there it's going to come to light that's God well what it does is it burns out that old nature and God comes in there you have that place here though before it's still empty amen we not gonna really make your own that but understand that when God comes in and justifies you he takes that out of there there you are you're clean you're righteous justified and so you've never done it in the first place but you're not truly until he comes and identifies himself with you by putting himself in you that's women and now that's when God takes control over this being now we still have free will understand we still have free will but God takes over that free will and we had that free will though in our soul but then that that light that's in there overtakes her conscience imagination reason face cream which also takes control of the body see taste feel smell hear all those things take and it all becomes in subjection to God it all becomes the the the the image the projection the expression of God that's who we've become we are the expression of God that expression stays in as we are here shell stays the same but the expression that's in there that all changes then they read you something here a couple of quotes I got now this is a thinking man's filter in thinking man's filter he says when you come in this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a fighting chance think about that we didn't even come into this world with a fighting chance you are born in sin shaped in iniquity and come into this world speaking lines within your own spirit think of that now as we just had this within your own spirit much less your body your own spirit was the desire of sin mine a lover of sin because you were born in sin you get to have a chance think about that from the very beginning and the fall the Garden of Eden everyone come after has been come with a fallen nature you didn't even have a chance but down inside of you somewhere that's that little seed now amen go back to first John chapter 3 you'll see that again we've read it many times you go back and find that seat down inside that cedar in there somewhere here you come see here you come not this guy not this body not this spirit but you you are that seat praise the Lord that's the real you brother Graham said here you come now we're down on the inside of the inside down inside of you somewhere here you come Amen praise the Lord I'm so glad this isn't me this is just a house to show that God has put me in but but I am who he has made me that seed which is part of him and actually the thought before the foundation world any of that's who we are they've been praise the Lord that process of justification has to come first to bring us into the reality of understanding that's who we are I was never this I was never this I was never a sinner I was never a roustabout and a liar and a thief and all this stuff I was never that understand I'm not being that that was never you to begin with you are in here yeah pretty good Bachman so thankful with God help us understand all those things that's what justification is remember when one random said if you never did it in the first place that's not a vigorous speech right that's a literal of happening from the scripture in your life you never did it in the first place what does that mean your slate is clean in the mind of God you never did it that was never you principle this was always you that see that German there was what he is what you are that's always been you that's the way God sees us praise the Lord I'm glad that's the way God sees us about what I see in the morning I like grooming myself and you have to partner a little shaggy this year I my barbers postponed our appointment so I'm supposed to give a haircut Friday but my barber postponed my appointment but anyway and we grew when we take care of ourselves but I'm concerned about the guy in the mirror I'm concerned about what I look like he got smeared right in God's eyes what does God see what is God looking at what is God interested in he's not interested in those little petty things what he's interested in is this in the middle that actually that see that thought that God was might want to get into that box event we're gonna do that in our next when we get back up to that to Christ and mystery God revealed again a man that lo box that thought that come out of God the condescending of God bringing himself into the understanding that us little he bring humans can understand but God in there that that that seed was God was there he says here again there you come he meant that's us there was something in there that begin to draw if you note it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word then you took the church and you took their ideas when he was told better do you never use the thinking man's filter but when we use the thinking man's filter all other filters had to pass away what is that that's God's Word the truth of God's Word God's thinking man's filter but minds shall not and when you take God's closer and drawed your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter now you've changed and that that seed of you became that see that you were there that was dormant at the time it came real and began to overtake and control your spirit of your body became you this is a still a shell but it's more of an evidence of who I really am my life now is in heaven who I always was not that guy back 4050 years ago whenever not that guy this guy is becoming more in that image because God taking over see if you draw your desires through God's filter his word at thank you miss filtered there's nothing left with the Holy Ghost amen nothing left but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what takes control over it the Holy Ghost is that this is what's so important about understanding that new birth the Holy Ghost that's why that's why Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again that's why everything we talked about last time agree here and the revelation that God gives the mystery is to those that have the Spirit of God those that are born again not some anointing not some gift we're not talking about gifts we're not talking about prophecies and ministry we're talking about God and God's Spirit and His Holy Ghost living in you that's what we're talking about not some gift or some gifts and callings and without repentance Devils witches and warlocks have all kinds of gifts they talk about skiing things that's not what we're talking about we're talking about you've got that spirit of you that's where the breaking point is that's where the revelation comes revelation doesn't come unless you've been born again revelation doesn't come not the revelation from God if God doesn't look if God has not identified himself with you I'm kind of crossing over to the other subject for a minute but if God doesn't if he doesn't come and identify you by putting himself in you by buying that Holy Spirit common now taking it's full of ugly stealing himself in there if God doesn't do that God has not identified himself with you no matter how much you've identified yourself with him if he has now identified himself why would he ever give a revelation to you now there might be something that comes along then like like the devil did in the Garden of Eden the devil gave me the revelation he meant and in that revelation caused the whole world to fall into the chaotic state granted a common 9pt seems fault sorry yes that's where the fall began in the beginning Amen she was deceived into it and we'll get to that that's part of what I want to talk about and Lord willing we'll do next week but she was deceived into doing it there's a difference in being deceived into doing something and doing something willfully right he'd never did it willfully she was deceived into doing it but she did it by a revelation from the devil not from God but from the but from the devil that's where she got that revelation from and you see what happened so you said well yeah the revelation can cut that can come from the devil and that revelation can be 99% of the truth but a revelation that contains 99% of the truth is not a revelation from God God works in purity holiness righteousness one hundred percent not 99 percent 100 percent why Christ speak what if we had alysha's drop down a little bit this is why cry speak in October 1959 he said now God is not going to hold a man this is where I'm going to get to we just left this off listen now God is not going to hold a man responsible because he's a sinner think of that could you imagine one of your local charismatic church or Baptist Church or you imagine saying that on TV enter some day star television network ed right now hey good job Sam you got a five-second delay and off the mouth I don't want to hear that because they don't believe that but look at the truth of it God is not going to hold a man responsible because he's a sinner why is he not gonna hold us be being a sinner because that's the way we were born we didn't have a choice in the matter which born in sin shape iniquity come world Sweden lies we didn't have a choice right we were all sinners that's how we come into the world so why would God hold us responsible something that we didn't have a choice over but the choice comes later because he was born a sinner but what God is going to hold a man responsible for is because that he remains a sinner there you go because God has made the way of escape and if someone a person desires to remain a sinner after God has made the way of escape dead God holds him responsible if he's come to the age of accountability and he knows right and wrong and what to do would not do when he's got to that what God holds that person responsible God will hold the man responsible if he remains a sinner he don't have to end because he doesn't have to remain a center for there is a provision made for his justification through Jesus Christ provision has made for what his justification his getting rid of this guy so that you have the clean harm Amen God will hold a man responsible for staying in this condition when Jesus Christ has made a way to burn out that old nature and for God to be able to come in now again we still have this sticky area here where you know the Bible Matthew tells us that if the spirit is gone out of a man and he Romans and drop places in that that place stays unfilled where God doesn't identify himself with that man then that old comes back in he said Seven Devils worse than him right no wonder Jesus said you get these proselytes you make them too full or Chavo hell Network start with why because you put them in this position now you got this all these Devils in here worse than the first one right so that tricky place is right there but it's got to come to that place first justification God has made a way of justification a provision has been made for his justification through Jesus Christ did the blood of Jesus Christ has made a way to cleanse this and to get rid of that to annihilate his past-due way with all those sins so that the man is a new creature in Christ Jesus now you know there's got to be the follow-up to that but that's what justification does now the perpetual work of justification brings you to understanding that your life stays that way because as we just read who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect why would he say that cause God's justified right jogs God's justified and we live in this state of new birth if God is justified then who can lay anything to the charge of that person said yeah but he did this and he did that now see that's another sticky thing that people had the justification I've heard people and I hate to say that I've heard people even in this message use that justification wrongly I heard one time of a man that was accused of something go in before a judge and said Judge I never did that and the judge is like excuse me I paraphrase don't remember a whole story but he's like well we had you on video we have eyewitnesses everybody here they're saying that you did it they saw you there's eyewitnesses that prove that you did that no judge that ever did it only God's eyes you never do if you've been charged us to fight and you're living in perpetual place of justification yeah true you never did it in God's eyes but here on the earth you actually did it right you understand as a human you did it you could have been a drug dealer and you could have been selling drugs to a man that killed that man and left his wife a widow and children without a father and you get born again you get filled the spirit God justifies you wipes that slate clean and God's eyes you never did that that never even happened not to God Gregor but did you go knock on that woman's door and you say man I'm here to tell you that I was the guy that got you your husband hooked up in drugs I was the man that sold into drugs I was the one that was responsible for him over D and you being a widow you know what you're gonna do you're gonna walk away from that door with a black eye and you should but none of you try to make it right that's good but if this woman comes to she and you try to tell her but but I didn't do it well yeah you did the result of her widowhood is there the result of her fatherless kids are there yeah you did it but the fact of understanding what God is doing circumvents everything else yes we own up to our past mistakes and understand that we did things wrong we understand that brings us into a place of perfection with the Lord because we don't ever want to be that way again or do those things again and we clean our life God cleans our lives up when we move forward from there absolutely but in the flesh it didn't happen but in God's eyes it never happened so what it says look when it says that that that who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God that justify it then who can put anyone I guess in the place you did it and you may have to pay the consequences for it but in God's eyes God says you never did it because God's the one that justified the court system didn't just fight you the woman that sweater now did just for you God justified to you if God justified you fitting his eyes in his mind you never did it now I'd rather be guilty in a court of law than guilty in God's eyes God said she never did it is God who justifies you can even go back to like we've done a quoted this many times over the past I don't know year or so and and this scripture I've got to tell you this scripture continues to mull in my spirit over and over and over romans 4 I usually quoted I'm gonna read it today Romans 4 8 now David said this to David even in the state that he lived in before the giving of the Holy Spirit now we know he was a man after God's own heart and he was the pre figure of Jesus to come but David even before the Holy Ghost could make this statement but look at us today when the spirit is calm the blood has been shed Redemption is free Romans 4:8 blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin what is that word impute mean it needs to account to or hold accountable up hold accountable to so if there's if if the word says that there is a person even if there's just whatever in the history of humanity now believe there's a board because the description says there is but even if there's only one there is a person that the Lord does not impute are hold him accountable for his wrongdoing now if the perpetual nature of justification did not exist how could that word ever be true it's true because we are perpetually continually justified by God you know why cuz we're always continuously perpetually making mistakes yes and doing things we shouldn't we're always in the place of repentance the anointing of the day God I'm sorry forgive me Lord it's God that justifies who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect God's justified but as it is the man to whom the Lord will not impute you and God does not even impute that sin to you even if you've done it right it's not imputed to you one cuz you're righteous in God's eyes that perpetuated blood that Jesus shed at Calvary still sets there no matter how many message preachers try to tell you the blood is off the mercy seat let me tell you it's their sheep brother Bentham said the the prayers of the Saints could not even get through to God if the blood was off the mercy seat greater so you do with that hair you want but it is still there and that perpetuated blood is a proxy for me yes you know what that means it means it took my place it sets there and stays there in my stead taking my place now if it's taking my place what place do I take I take the place of Jesus I step into the robe of righteousness that Jesus through his justification has put upon us now we are as righteous as he is righteous you say oh that's too much brother you I'm afraid sometimes we just don't go far enough that's the truth of God's Bible that's where God wants us to be how are we ever going to get to the place that we know who we are without the understanding of what God has done for us and made us to be he wants us to be that way he wants us to understand that and for that chip knowledge purchased an understanding he wants set to be a revelation in our minds in our hearts if that becomes a revelation you know what's gonna happen the rapture is gonna take place because brother Graham said when this broad comes to know she is we're going home I don't know what better way to understand them that's who we are that's who God is madness in his might was his design that's what he called for us all along forget what you done in the past forget what you done yesterday forget what you did this morning blasting is the man to whom God will not what the Lord will not impute sin he does not even hold you a callable for it great he's the Lord now somebody makes it Michael just do whatever I want didn't know that just proves that you don't have any what you say you do Amen if you just want to go out and do whatever you want to and live however one life you want to well that just shows that you don't have what you say you have you have not been justified you are not living in a place of righteousness if you are righteous and you're gonna live a holy consecrated line you're not gonna do just whatever you want because that brings us in a place to say Lord not my will but your will be done oh it's so is so beautiful things seems like so many times they just wanted to skip right over justification and then not delve in it to see what it means to us greatest battle ever fought saying I appreciate that that song that come on Zack ago the Zacks part about all is well I love that song lyrics just beautiful and then greatest battle ever fought which is in that song if you remember then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from there from there goes for feeding every channel now when you were sitting that's what it did this you live that life because that's the feeding of that channel but when you become bored and God lives in you then that's what's feeding those channels then your conscious imagination reason affection memory feeds off of that channel feeds off of that spirit and when that gets in contact it's in line with that spirit then that's what affects the see taste smell smell here that's why would you see the things you should feel turn your head when you hear things you shouldn't you quit listening when going when gossip gets told to you you say no I'm fine yours aren't a garbage dump I'm not gonna listen to that then you you cut it off see you all these things are controlled because it's it's becoming to the image of Jesus Christ praise the Lord feeds every channel trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of doubt trying standing in here with a lot of doubt trying to accept what is out there that's least on my healing trying to reach healing so about the greatest battle in the mind here with a lot of doubt trying to reach out to that that's out there that's that's in a different dimension to try to bring that dimension into this so that that healing takes place in our bodies in our minds wherever that that miracle that supernatural happens see we can't doubt it it's got to be pure faith you've got to stop that and come down that channel with the true Word of God and then it goes out itself automatically praise the Lord I like that word and automatically if that life is in you it just happens it's automatic it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts is on the inside see we always focus so much on the outside on the Purdy and on the eloquent and all the the great speakers and stuff we we always make sure on the outside no it's what's on the inside amen it's what's on the inside man a man could be his alchemist speakers there is he the noida speaker as he is but what is he saying right what are the words coming out of his mouth because that's what matters it's on the inside that matters see it's not one man not watching his the Bible says that from from from his heart the man speaketh well that's on the inside it's what's on the inside that that defy was a person he says that's what counts is on the inside say these approaches from the inside because he knows it is he now you say I don't steal I don't drink I don't do these things that has nothing to do with it see it's the inside no matter how good you are how tall you are how truthful you are those things are respected but jesus said except a man be born again there's got to be something happen inside if you don't it's an artificial put on that's downing your hardened that down in your heart gives the desire to do it eating out then the desire is still there the desire to do it is still there even though there has been a justification took place now I want to go and read a couple more scriptures because I believe we're going to close here I I doubt I'd lose track of time because I'm I'm used to looking up to the clock but those who start at 1:30 is just now on thirty I'm used to starting and knowing about what time so but what closer you're just very shortly but let's go to Galatians I want to read a couple of scriptures out of Galatians Galatians 2:16 and in Galatians 3:11 amen Galatians 2:16 now I'm doing all this lay this foundation to understand for the justification is the justification is not on the bottom the justification is not on the spirit if God took everything wrong let's just say if because again I want to get to something if God is if the justification has taken place in the body then every wrong that was done in your rock in your life should be made private but I don't know about you but I am that's got a lot of scars of things that's happened in my life in my body any of my spirit right memories come back with things that scarred me in my life yes from my spirit you think would have been justified well it's done and over with yes but in your body in your spirit that's not what the justification is it's right here in the heart the justification is not here it's just like people brother Richard boat right now form pastor preach last Sunday for him he got it backwards he was talking about the very subject or sort of to the point we were making and you know he said you got to remember sea wisdom place a part of an understanding how do we approach what's going on today and by having that wisdom it helps us realize yeah we've been sealed with the holy spirit of promise but where is that seal it's in the soul absolutely not the body not the spirit now we're hedged we can be heads just the Bible says as we prayed about and talking about being pitched but the seal did not seal your body that's why you get sick that's why we had the flu or have a head cold or get out oh geez er the things that affect our body cuz that's not where the justification is that's not where the seal gets that's not what broke that's exactly what brother Brandon was talking about here it's only inside that's what he told him that is what matters what's on the inside not the body not the spirit I want us to keep that in mind to understand with this justification even things you I've started my body that things were done wrong well the bad never happened and why do I still have the scar because your body's not justified right it's going to be chained by the grace of God according to Romans a when our bodies are changed to be like his own glorious body we go through moral the immortality from corruption to incorruption yes maybe won't have any scars to worry about even spear or body but now we look at the justification now keep that in mind hopefully I'll try to draw that out next week to make the point I want to be thing I want to say next week of a quote that brother Greta made to understand this is not where it is justifications inside amen listen galatians galatians chapter 2 verse 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law is not something you do it's not something that you can make up or there's something that you can that you can perform to to garner the graces of God or enter into heaven it's not based on your words it's not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law or the works of the law shall no flesh be justified ready that solidifies fred the fact that it's not here it's in here it's not the bodies not the spirit it's not something you can do or say or no place you can go where you work you can perform it's like the rich young ruler remember the rich young man he got got richer and richer after he turned down Jesus the law was his approach I mean we're talking about a man that fell down on his knees before Jesus we're talking about a man that the Bible says Jesus looked on and loved him but what was his approach his approach was what shall I do great then I might inherit eternal life there's nothing you can do there's no work you can perform the work has already been done Jesus Christ has already done the work he's already paid the price that's a finished work there's no work we can do all they do is accept what he has done for us praise the Lord there's no work to it there's no law to it there's no justification outside of faith that grace by faith that brings us into that fellowship now Galatians 3:11 but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the judge shall live by faith that was Martin Luther's crime that was that was his whole message the just shall live by faith but what are we gonna do today friend amen are we gonna live by faith are we gonna live by sight are we gonna live by what God has done for us are we gonna live by what we can see taste go smelling here are we gonna live by what God has said who we are are we going to live by what we think we are about the devil tries to convince you you are I can tell you what God believes you are you are his you are him manifested in this earth living in these bodies but man said of this place where the fall off you see God standing in front of you I mean what more do we need to understand and no you say yeah I want you to make a mistake today you ever make a mistake again tomorrow but it's understanding that perpetual justification that keeps you clean even when you are born again is filled with the spirit God does not impute any of that to you hey man I'm a clothes here let's bury who is this no kidding and look clearly make it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning praise the Lord that thought that was in God in the beginning that low gosh that thought calm down into the predestined in the form of that scene right there amen that seat right there shows destination of God in each life whom he has chosen and he did it as we read by his foreknowledge his foreknowledge so who would receive him and who would not receive him now that brings them that that's the scripture I mean we can't you denied the scripture all you want but that's what it says you will never be the word what is that the Express image of Jesus praise the Lord man I wish y'all are all here you just be shouting you will never be the word unless you is a fault at the beginning that's that Express image that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word less you were a fault you had to be in the thinking of God first in order to stand temptation though we had to bypass that theophany oh we see that condescension now it just keeps coming to me friends we'll get back to it that condescension of God coming down that logos to come out we bypassed our theophanies you had to come here in the flesh to be tempted of sin and and all the father has given me will come to me and I have raised him up the last day Amen see you first let's keep going now before the foundation of the world his name your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he became the word that theophany that could appear disappear then he became flesh we turn back again Ritt resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you by pat but you by past in theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin in this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet those bodies but look when this body receives the Spirit of God the immortal light inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God praise the Lord it throws this body in the subjection to God why the soul is the nature of the Spirit and the Spirit is the life of the body amen in that soul is the place of freewheel yes your decision point that's where people decide do I look to accept God or do I not well God's moving on me well that's wonderful are you going to accept that move or are you gonna reject it amen people around the world today making that decision when this body receives the Spirit of God the immortal life of God in you that throws this body subjection to it he that is born of God does not commit sin amen there's another one he that is born of God does not commence he and he cannot see it again first John three go back to find that scene there that's where brother Browns quoting from he that his board of God cannot see in Romans 8:1 there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body in subject you don't have you don't have to say oh I could just quit drinking or it might be just wit smoking her if I could just quit doing all this stuff he said just get into Christ and it's all gone man notice what he said he said you get into Christ amen praise Him we get into Christ not just Christ God the Holy Spirit in us we get in him then all that is gone been said well I gotta do this I gotta do that go God will do what he wants but he's gonna find a willing subject to do it through there's always there's always you looked in the Bible there's always willing subjects that God has used down through the years someone who is making the choice to do it and to be there it's their choice oh if I could just quit smoking just put drinking to just get into Christ and it's all gone see because your body is to the spirit your body is subject to the Spiritist no more subject to the things of the world they are dead the things of the world that come into this guy see taste smell smell in here and even and even will affect your spirit I don't know how many have experienced this but when I was in the world I like classic what we call classic rock man I was just walking rollin it was a kid now it's called classic rock I guess I've reached that age in classic rock anyway you go to the store restaurant of course you can't go the restaurants anymore hard to go the stores but you hear this is that they explain music music sometimes sometimes I hear the some use except song I haven't heard in probably 30 or 40 years and I can sing every word of that song one I know heard in 30 40 years how would I be able to more than 30 how I'd be able to still see him written every word of that song you so that's your memory you know that's right here that's in your spirit you remember that those things conjure back up because that's that that conscious brings into that memory to remember those things even back from them that's the power of music by the way too that brings that into into play defensive it's still that world still hasn't affected here to body and spirit it still it still works to affect both but your body is subject to the Spirit of God no it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in Baptism and you are a new creation in Christ praise the Lord now we just have to believe that we just have to act like that that's that's not just verbage that's just not words on the page that's something that we are supposed to live that's our life amen it's Christ in us the hope of glory the only way to get to that place it brings us to that places to be justified amen God takes and wipes all that away no more the bad nature amen but God coming and living in there is what changes the whole thing the justification Psalm with a body mount with the spirit yeah you still did those things back years ago you still did those things you still listen to that music and ran with those people you still did that and that that's there but in God's mind it's erased amen I mean God's mind keep that in mind please as we go into next week Lord willing next week and get into a greater depth of that part of it so we get to that amen when we get to that part so we'll seek a little song here close our service appreciate each one of you being there I don't know who of you are but I appreciate each one of you being there and being a part of this inaugural I don't know how long it'll go on the inaugural streaming service or the Word of God Tabernacle I don't think that I've ever done this before in my life so I've preached in churches that had cameras and things like that but never have I pastored a church that put it in the perspective that it's in today so but I'll say once again you've all been desperately missed but I pray something was said to bless and help you today let's see let's go back to that song that we sang their last all is well they may we sang two verses of it and those Act had it on his phone it's 650 if you see the chorus here don't know what let's sing it to the glory of the Lord now just listen to the listen to the words very powerful all is way [Music] all is well we have heard the message and all this way [Music] well there is a place a perfect rest behind the interval so rest the ride rest for all these barrels he has second verse now things have not worked out by God's people for we're still here were fighting the greatest battle ever gone but if will have the faith of Abraham [Music] knowing God's Word never fails it will trust in here we'll find that all this will you believe that the name is all this [Music] all this way we have heard the message alone and all this way well there is a place of perfect rest behind me is a man you believe that today all is well all this will in the name of Jesus Christ so thankfully God has give something in us to understand that we stand upon his mercies and His grace not upon the judgment of the world not upon the things of the world but upon Jesus Christ amen I believe in my trust him thank him so much for being my portion always being there amen you feel it with you he's so real he's so good I love the Lord with all my heart amen god bless you richly amen again I pray something was said to bless you today Lord willing again we'll pick this up next week and then if the Lord tarries mean we're at the end we all pretty well figured that out but but if the Lord tarries and next week I want to get into really what I want to talk about with this justification and then the next week the Lord willing we'll have our Easter service so we'll see where the Lord takes from here and hopefully Lord will if we don't see you know this side we'll see on the other side appreciate each one being a part of the service today may God richly bless you amen we're gonna bow our heads and dismiss this in a word of Prayer amen Lord Jesus thank you father again for blessing and keeping us in your perfect wheel for watching over and helping us to do only what you would call for us to do
