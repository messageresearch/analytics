and happy New Year happy New Year hard to strange to say that on what is it the 21st but this is our first service in the new year amen so happy New Year amen praise the Lord glad to make it to a new year St Matthew chapter 11 going to continue on with where we finished with the god in Simplicity got a few more here and um close this study out with God in Simplicity this will be part 10 this will be the Bride versus a church or the bride contrasting the church this will be part one of that so God in simplity part 10 bride in the church part one praise the Lord but we're going to start in Matthew 11 as we do verse 25 but before we do can we bow our heads for another word of prayer precious Lord Jesus we're so very thankful again Lord to be here today thanking you for your grace and your mercy your love in our lives for bringing us to this place Lord giving us the beautiful rain that we look outside Lord although sometimes it's a little bit of a hindrance but God you've you brought it to us to liven up our beautiful desert we're so thankful to you for it Lord but God we're more thankful father that you'd Reign the spirit of God the Holy Spirit the the rain the latter rain come into this place today Lord and fill all this house where we will be sitting here today God and let your spirit Lord have the preeminence as we be obedient to follow the leader leadership of that spirit and doing only what you call and commission and help us to do father for we are in your hands Lord bless each one that's come Lord may your hand be upon them in a special way those who may not been able to make it for whatever reason God those who may be streaming Lord may your hand be on them as well move on every request every need every heart every life Lord every sickness We Believe God that you are the dissolver of doubt and you're The Giver of every good gift we believe today God that you're here to do that very same thing for us Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is son done here in this place God this time that's been set aside that you knew before the foundation of the world that this would be here that we would be here God and you knew Lord as this place would have a would have a significance Lord to the furance of your kingdom Lord I pray that you would accomplish that today and whatever we do and say God lord may you just speak through these lips Lord the words you'd have us to hear may it fall on every one of our ears to bring Revelation to our hearts and draw us closer to you we commit Our Lives to you and all in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus answered said I thank thee F oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things for the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto bads amen you can be seated if you'd like amen from there I'd like to go over to Isaiah Isaiah chapter 59 read one verse of scripture here Isaiah 59 very uh enlightening ver uh scripture chapter actually but I just want to read one verse out of it if you uh get the time your home comes on your mind maybe get out Bibles in your reading time and go back to Isaiah 59 parallels a lot actually over into Ephesians as well uh but Isaiah chapter 59 just one verse of scripture Isaiah 59:19 this is kind of where we want to draw a context for this service today amen it won't be too long uh just TR the leading of the Lord here though Isaiah 59:19 amen it says so shall th so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the East uh from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him amen amen and we've quoted that many many times but based on the uh the the direction of this service today I felt led to read this to us sometimes s it's a lot means a lot more when you read it from the scripture than just simply quoting it but I want to read this last part again listen very closely it says when the enemy when the enemy shall come in like a flood now that's not your brother that's not your sister that's not the church down the street that's the devil amen that's the devil the devil when he comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord the Holy Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him amen a standard against him praise the Lord now I want to go over to Revelation praise the Lord and uh go from our go for our context continuing today so remember when the enemy comes in like a flood amen the spirit of the Lord raises a standard against him amen Revelation chapter 4 praise the Lord Revelation 4 I want to read a couple of verses of scripture here um I wish I had more time probably could take the time but um to read a lot more of the the scripture pertaining to this but I'll just want to get to the highlights of this part that we want to speak on today uh Revelation 4 uh verse 6 and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto christone and we know the waters uh represent people scripture most multitudes throngs of people uh would be considered a sea uh scripturally sea of glass like unto Crystal uh and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full uh full of eyes before and behind uh and the eyes are just symbolic I've seen these pictures that theyve drawn tried to artists tried to draw these pictures of these beasts and have eyes all over them it's more of a symbolic uh issue here not the fact that there's actually eyeballs on every one of them all over top bottom front back is is symbolic of the vision uh the seeing uh is is to say that uh Le let's just say this real quick uh God knows all things does he not there's not one thing that happens that God doesn't know about but that doesn't mean God has eyeballs all over his head in front and back and all around just understand it's the vision of the lord it's it's it's the vision of of the uh foresight of a prophecy even of what's about to take place because remember Jon is on the AL of patmas caught up in the in the spirit of the Lord on the Lord's day that wasn't Sunday or Saturday it was two years uh caught up in the Lord as God was revealing these things through him showing to him in many ways symbolic gestures symbolic things that he would see uh that's why you notice and we'll just let me let me get to this part because uh you'll notice all through Revelation where uh John says unto or as or like unto he doesn't say it's exactly this in a lot of cases let's read this rest of this now uh seventh verse and the first Beast was like a lion he didn't say it was a lion but he said it was like a lion so in every way I believe what he saw was something that had the same defining characteristics of a lion of what a lion would be or project amen so you notice that and that runs in continuity through the scripture with John A lot of it is unto or as or like uh this is one of those places the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had a face as a man a lot of people say he was a man that's not what the scripture says amen he had the face of a man now brother random talks about this man as the intelligence amen uh the intelligence of the age of man but it was simply the face of man didn't say he had the Torso legs body just the face of the man see and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle amen now these those four anointings each age that that I just want to touch on here today uh to take us forward each age had its own special anointing now notice we go back to the scripture that we just read in Isaiah when he talks about the enemy coming in like a flood that God the Holy Spirit raising that standard against the against the the the the enemy against the devil God raising a standard against it so each time the enemy would come in the God would raise a standard against it each one of these animals each one of these uh visionist beasts was like unto a specific Beast a specific animal for a specific purpose it was a representation of an anointing of God Amen a representation of an anointing of god notice that they were by around about in The Throne of God as an anointing each one of these represented a type of an anointing now look I want you to see because I I felt it would be a little bit more um it maybe make a little bit more sense if if I wrote it out and I'm sorry if my handwriting is terrible uh I thought about trying to put it on the computer and put it up on the screens but uh I couldn't get that to work either so uh I just wrote it out here hopefully you can see it okay but we want to talk talk about now let's go over to Revelations chapter 6 and I want to go over this uh again to to understand uh the the workings of God in the churches now this obviously outside of the revealing of the Seven Seals was that that that part of those seals that that brother that God gave to brother Bram to bring to the church to bring to the bride amen uh and and that is the the the subtitle of this uh sermon today Bride versus church or bride and church however you want to say it uh but brother brandham did not uh and actually most of the world probably still sees no difference uh they look at the scripture uh they teach in their seminaries they preach in their churches uh that there's the bride and church is the same the same people and they're not uh you look to the scripture you can find out that now obviously that's things that you read through the scripture that God brings as a revelation to you that you can see and brother brandom uh in his early Ministry made the in his preaching basically coupled the two together it wasn't until the time of the seals uh I believe actually before the first seal was broke and brother bam talked about uh in the breach where brother brandham actually definitively begin to separate the bride from the church church and begin to teach that the bride and the church are two separate groups amen now we find it all through the scriptures it's not hard to understand it's just getting out of the out of the denominational teaching and into truth that helps you understand when God reveals the word to you that that this Falls perfectly in continuity with the rest of the scripture and it's it's absolutely perfect to understand one of the greatest dilemmas that a lot of people have and a lot of people in uh Christian churches today still believe that God's people we'll just put it that way are going to go through the tribulation and that is not true but there when if you have the church and the bride being the same group I could understand that but when you see through Revelation by the scripture that the church is one group and the bride's a different group The Bride is they called out of the church group that that the church does go to the tribulation but the bride does not amen amen so when you separate them by by through the scripture and you read it the in the context by the word you see that the church would go to the to the tribulation the bride does not that's why a lot of people because they see it going through that way which makes sense but it it doesn't if you separate the two and a lot of a lot of Christian does not they don't see a difference they don't know there's a difference but there is a difference there's a very distinct difference between the bride and the church so much so that Matthew 25 that Jesus tells a whole parable about the two groups amen but let's let's move on with this so we'll begin about uh uh with with the bride versus the church recognizing the very most Stark difference between the bride and the church is the church goes to the tribulation the bride does not uh which brings into understanding that the that the bride has a new birth and the church does not right amen amen the biggest difference between the two the only difference in Matthew 25 the only difference in Matthew 25 is one had the Holy Ghost and one didn't right they all had an anointing but one had an indwelling presence and the other did not that's the difference amen the difference in the bride and the church the church is still a virtuous group amen but they're not they're they're not born again the Bride is a born again called out group amen so we see the difference now to be able to understand where we're going to go with this and and recognize uh the fulfilling and hopefully encourage us today of Isaiah 59 that when the enemy does come in when the enemy does try to strike you there's a standard that God has already set now look this isn't something that we recognize that is some great new thing that God does for us every day no no God's already done it the standard is already set the standard is already there and we my friend the bride is the standard Bearer for this day amen for the last day especially we are the standard Bearer so when he comes in the enemy comes in like a flood that standard is already there brother Ram said if God could come and heal you right now he would do it but God can do no more for you right now than what he has already done if God could come in this place right now and save you all he would do it but he can't do anymore than what he's already done right which brings salvation and healing and all the other red blessings that we have need of in our human flesh God's already given them the standards already there the the the the the price has already been paid it's already been met so the standards already there we just grab a hold of that standard and we ride that wave over the enemy amen amen we ride it over the enemy faith faith faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God that's the standard amen that's the standard that God gives so the enemy continues to come in like a Flood now notice the enemy does not have a standard the enemy just goes about doing what he can do to disrupt everything that God's done or is God is doing he has no standard but God has a standard you can't stand on the words of the devil you can't stand on the words of a person they're here today and gone tomorrow science medicine whatever it is education it all changes continually but you can trust and believe on the standard that God has that God has placed that standard is still there today and we are the ones that are to be the standard Bearer so that when the enemy comes in like a flood we stand up and we say boo amen boo devil yes that devil has no place friend amen amen the devil will begin to shrink back down he has no place because the standard has already been set when the when the enemy when that standard comes across that what ever the devil tries to bring it crested every one of those waves just like it was here look now the sman let let's start with the church ages here we have the Ephesian Church age the sman church age pergamus thus Sardis Philadelphia Leia that's the seven Church ages uh those a lot of people don't even believe in uh uh Dimensions like that of of uh of the churches through time they just believe that in the scripture that it was just speaking solely to those churches that were there at that time in Ephesus and in Smur and in pergamus that's what they only believe that they don't believe they're not dimensionist or uh uh not that's not what I'm trying to say they're not uh dispens dispensationalist thank you sister dispensationalists they don't believe in the dispensations that we believe in amen that we know to be true Not only was it about each of those churches that was there at the time but that there's each Church age that birth forth out of the beginning at at uh uh at uh the upper room Amen on the day of Pentecost that each one's birth forth now the the greatest example that we have here that we can see Revelation 6 doesn't speak on the church ages but it talks about uh as we know the seals and the seals that Encompass the Church ages amen now we know that there's Seven Seals and seven Church ages but only four seals pertain to the church ages the fifth seal is the souls under the altar Sixth Seal is tribulation seventh seal is coming of the Lord amen so there's only four that pertain to them so as you look at them and recognize them in their dates I didn't put the dates down I I ran out of room almost basic as it was uh I didn't put the dates down but if you had a church age book or something you can look you can see how the dates fall in line and how perfectly it is that that the scripture talks about especially in the seals that lines these Church ages out it's uh it's actually it's actually really pretty here but I want us to see uh kind of more or less the this this message of encouragement of the enemy coming in like a flood that God's done it all through amen all through the church ages even in the Dark Ages God was still there the holy spirit is brother said Bound By the Doors of Creeds and dogmas couldn't move like it was but there was still that Sil sliver of light in the darkest of Ages in the in the pergamus and thar there was still that sliver of light amen that represented the bride for that day amen praise the Lord now we know each circle was a church age but that sliver was God's people that was the bride but the the first church age was Ephesus now I thought thought I could just read through uh Revelation 2 and 3 uh but we can if you want to do that we can do that at home or do that later or something uh to read through these Church ages again but the Ephesians was the first church age it was the birth of the church uh Ephesians birth the church forth now as the Ephesian Church age was birth forth at the day of Pentecost with the new birth that was taking place there on the upper room 3,000 Souls added that day amen as that Ephesus Church burth forth there was that lion nature wasn't a lion but lion nature that was there as an anointing that Beast that was there to represent that church age it was there as an anointing now remember uh there there's there's there's that Holy Spirit anointing over the whole world the rain falls on the just and the unjust but there's a specific special anointing hope you can see maybe sister Julie probably not in a good place for you um that specific special anointing for the bride amen that's what that lion anointing was and of course we know the lion would represent Christ amen with the new birth of course the Holy Spirit coming down in the upper room birthing the church forth of course that was Jesus Christ that was the spirit of God that was God's spirit in the church bir in the church forth that's why that lion anointing was there it was going forth it was doing its Duty as as that church was being born now the second Church age the smia church age was a church age that was anointed for death uh so much so as you notice in the circles that brother random Drew out uh there was less light in that church age in the sman church age as that SM Church age went forth uh it it got darker and darker because it started getting more towards uh uh the church started getting more toward dogmas and more towards uh organization and denomination amen it didn't start yet didn't start till pergamus in 3 uh 320 ad uh were the the N year Rome when they all came together but this was the predecessor of it amen the beginning of it in Ephesus they left their first love when they left their first love they fell just enough for Deeds to be mentioned to be brought forth things that were not scriptural and in smia those those uh those things that were mentioned those deeds became Doctrine amen and and as they became doctrine that anointed this church age for death of course myrr is one of the uh things that they brought to Jesus uh at his birth which was a symbolization of uh of the anointing of his death amen we know that when when the three wise men had brought those gold myrr uh and frankincense myrr was the thing that they used to embomb the dead Myrrh is the root word of smia anointed for death because at that time it began to continue to slide it was still under the anointing of the lion that still there was still bride in that age amen because there's bride in every age there was still bride in that age that were still anointed by the lion by the lion Nature by the lion Beast so even as these Church ages begin to slide into uh dogmas and doctrines of devils they begin to slide into what then in pergamos became the Catholicism when they met in niome uh just like they did just like Israel did uh when they got together and they said uh we like God and all but we want a king over us uh God's a good guy we like him we want him around but we want a king over us we want to be like all the other nations and we want to have a king we want to have somebody rule over us see brother R says they finally rejected God when they did that amen right but God honored their request nevertheless and gave them AA of the House of Benjamin amen and then we know Samuel and so forth but they did the same thing here they they they were going along and the and as each one of the the apostles begin to die off a little bit more of the corruption began to come in there was still always that anointing for the bride for the ones that stayed true in that day but at the end of the saman church age when that when it was dying off because it was anointed to death and remember each one of these ages kind of overlaps each other I know uh if I remember right the dates on the church age book They're they're very specific but brother brandom tells us that each one of those age overlapped each other right so as each so as one Church age was going out while it was going out the other one was coming in right so there was an overlap so during that time is when between smia anointed for death still under the lion but anointed for death slid over into the pergamus church age which was the birth of Catholicism or the seed of Satan it became the seed of Satan remember we read I I know it's been a long time but when we go back to Thessalonians chapter 2 and we see in there where uh he as uh uh as God sitting in the temple of God showing himself that he is God he became in that seed of Satan became through this Dogma through this Doctrine through this denomination he became an object of worship and we see here look and I saw now this the first two Church ages Revelation 61 first seal and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals now the lamb is Christ the lamb is not brother brand the lamb is Christ Christ opened the seals not wing and brown amen the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it were as the noise of thunder so it was a thunder in the first seal as these as these seals began to unfold a thunder came forth we know a thunder represents a voice in this case would be the voice of God the voice of God speaking but he's speaking through he's speaking through these anointed representatives of the Bride for that age which is what we call it calls the Beast of that age or the lion in this case now that Thunder one of the four beasts uh saying come and see we know that was the lion beast at First Church age now what comes in we've already I don't need to go into this in great detail because we've already did we've already gone through the six seal the sixth chapter many times uh and talked about it in detail so I I'm not going to go into that detail again I just want to hit those highlights to get the point here one of the four beasts saying come and see that's the lion Beast that anointing for that that time come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow no Arrow just a bow a bluff and a crown was given unto him didn't earn it didn't inherit it it was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer in these two Church ages and he was beginning to succeed he did succeed he took over by calling the the SE of Satan this pergamus church age the beginning of Catholicism was the beginning of what the ultimate severe downfall of of this church began it slid all the way to the point that it ended up in the dark ages to word just barely just a small sliver of light of people of of of Believers but there was always an anointing it was always an anointing seej look as that enemy came in like a flood started the Catholic Church uh baptism in Father Son and Holy Ghost titles titles for everything basically again I've said this before Satan's whole goal and aim was to wipe the name of Jesus Christ away right he did not want anybody calling on the name of Jesus Christ titles is fine even you say father son holy ghost Crossing yourself of course that's a heathenistic trait Crossing yourself is Heathen trait I can show you the scripture it's a it's a heathen trait just like cutting yourself that a lot of people do amen it's a heathen trade Crossing yourself what where did it come from the seed of Satan the pergamus church age but notice friend as it did that as the Catholic Church gained strength as people looked at it and they thought Oh What a Mighty power what what a great thing how beautiful the churches how great and began to give them all the wealth of the world into the into the Catholic Church brother Ram said he went to the Vatican one time you know and and and is as you know he's uh they said you know do this and do this cut the cuff out of your pants and all this mess and he said I was glad to do that he says now when I come up to him what do I do he says you got to bow on the one KN knee and kiss his ring said oh no that's out I'm not doing that but he said I went in that place he said you couldn't buy it with a billion billion billion dollars or something like that a billion trillion dollars something to that effect he said all that wealth coming into this place it looks so grandioso and that's what attracts people that's Whata attacks uh uh attracts people's emotions and feelings and think well how could something Follow by so many people and such a beautiful thing how could it be wrong because it's of the devil but that's the trick of the enemy just from the very beginning of the Garden of Eden his whole trick he works through Beauty always has still does Amen to attract to deceive to to to bring people to draw people away from Christ the word and he did an excellent job the pergamus church age and the people the church let him right they let him but there was a bride there's always a bride under that that calf anointing and he they they killed they murdered 60 I think on on the on the catholic's books not not a third independent Arbiter but the C the Catholic Church themselves recorded 63 million murders of Protestants at that time through this Dark Age and we entered into thar which was the Dark Ages but look at the anointing God sends remember God sent forth this line anointing in the first couple of church ages that was Christ the birth of the church the Raging forth the the the the telling of Christ the story of Christ the uh Salvation all around the world remember three or as it was in that day 3,000 people were added to the church the very day of the day of Pentecost it's 120 Upper Room yeah it was 120 yes but Paul's uh but uh um Peter's sermon was so persuasive that the Bible says 3,000 were added that very day amen and that was that lion anointing going forth now there's a different anointing on these on pergamus and thar there's a different anointing but notice that anointing that standard even though these people had to give their lives even though they had to diey in marman they still had that anointing Amen in my opinion and I believe it has been recorded I'd have to go back and look again so I'm speaking kind of off the cuff a little bit some of you may know if you've read especially if you've read the fox book of Martyrs that at that time when people were going to the stake to be burned at the state they stood there with with with joy and thankfulness that for the testimony of Jesus Christ they could give their lives amen singing praising worshiping God I don't think they felt a thing I don't think they felt I don't think they felt one single lick of that fire because it was an anointing there now the Bible says calf anointing brother random references ox or laboring a laboring or or a animal that sacrifices themselves gives themselves U even to death that's why that Ox anointing was the next anointing and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see went out another horse that was red bloody power was given to him that sat there on to do what take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another which they did and there was given unto him a great sword and was given unto him a great sword why because this is the dark ages the seed had to fall into the ground before it could come back up and but God already the standard was already there Saints yep praise the Lord the ox anointing was already there for those people that calf anointing was already there for those people see that's why brother VanDam could kind of change it to the ox because John the Revelator saw it and said this was like unto so the like unto is the same thing it's a sacrifice it's it's something that gave itself willingly it was a it was a beast of burden uh the ox is a burden Bearer that's why that anointing was here for those people that day yes they gave their lives yes it's horrible the morate and all that they went through but there was an anointing there to help them to be with them while they went through it again I don't believe as they as all these things were happening the story I believe in Fox book of Martyrs this couple their children had been mared martyred uh uh they had come up to the place that they would not deny Jesus Christ and they came up to uh twin stakes in the ground that they were both going to be burned and God saw the fire raging or something or the the the the kenneling built up there and and it got a hold of his heart he said I I Rec can't I Rec can't I Rec can't he quit and his wife looked at him and said what are you doing honey please don't no she pleaded and begged for him not to recant but he recanted anyway so even that separation she walked and she walked gladly up to that Stak and was burned at the steak and her husband so it's it it it shows friend that a person can look like it act like it sound like it all the way through but when it come right up to where excuse me where the rubber me the road he couldn't do it right right up to the very point of going to that state she looked at him and said honey it'll be over in a couple of minutes it's okay but I don't believe that that anointing was falling on those people I don't believe she felt the thing amen they pushed off the cliffs on the spikes and gashed open and honey and bees come and eat them up and it it just the things that happened during those Dark Ages 63 million of them just because they were Protestant Saints but that anointing was there the enemy was coming in like a flood even to the point that the the Dark Ages were almost completely blacked out but that anointing was still there for those people there was a bride at that age because God that standard was there that standard bear at that time it was for those people to give their lives IM morate that's what the anointing was for that day it was for them to give their lives that's why they did they freely went to that stake because of what was uh what that anointing was on them you freely do what you do as you serve the Lord Jesus because there's an anointing on you to do it there's a reason that God put that on you so that you have that feel that and and live that because it's who you are it's God on you you and when that Devil comes in anytime we have a standard against it amen they had a standard against it even in the Dark Ages they had a standard against it and you go down to the Sardis Church age you have a you have an anointing of that's that's the face of a man brother Ram called intelligence during this period of time we had the birth of the Renaissance intelligence sculpture paintings literature poetry all these things was a part of the Renaissance birth of the intelligence of man that led to into I could bring you the dates but anyway that led into the Reformation what we know now is the reforming of the church praise the Lord through the intelligence of man what did that mean through God uh through man well God the an anointing man uh being Anointed with this even maybe unbeknownst to them they started inventing things during the Renaissance things be they began to invent things left and things over and over and the greatest thing that was invented during the Renaissance that was capitalized during the Reformation was the printing press and man who began to want to take just oh my help me Lord to take take one page of this sacred Bible and read it over and over and over and over and over because that's all they have we got a whole Hall oh God help us amen yes they poured over one page over and over and over and then they started printing it but they could only print like a Bible in defiance of the Catholic church in remember these are lapping over now in defiance of the Catholic church and in and in threat of the Catholic Church's dominance there was an anointing on those people uh the White Cliffs and I forget all their names hus and different ones they those men under that anointing begin to uh take the word when they get it and started to try to replicate it in their language so people could have it so people could read it anyone that was caught with it though now was murdered was killed was hung or burned at the steak something but even if they were found to know parts of this they would come up to little kids and they would say do you know uh uh the Ten Commandments or something like this if that child knew it they took them away they took that child away from the parents right then and killed them killed a whole family that's how that's how suppressive that was it does make you wonder why there's a Statue of Liberty out in Isis Island in New York now and how happy those people were to come to a place to come to a land where they weren't under that oppression where they weren't under that denomination where they weren't forced to do something that in their good conscience they did not want to do but this man anointing began to get on these men amen and started and of course each one we know has has its reformer of its day its Prophet if you will they weren't prophets but you know each one is God gave to brother brandom as he come down to this reformation and this Reformation was of course that was Wesley or I mean uh Luther the just shall live by faith these men begin to print the Bibles and the Gutenberg printing press because of the Renaissance the Gutenberg printing press was invented and they could M they could Mass produce the Bible so that hundreds and thousands of people could have it instead of just one or two people they can have the whole thing instead of just one page amen that anointing is what brought that to pass that anointing of that man intelligence that brought this to fruition so that these people could have the Bible amen now you go down to the Philadelphia Church which is above the the age of Love they say it's the missionary age it's the age brother bam called of the open door uh when the Bible speaks of that Open Door he's talking about the Philadelphia Church age when when after this the Bible was printed and and and of course then around that time when uh a miracle was discovered and and the the the gospel began to spread like never before and men like Wesley uh who was the Charles Wesley his his brother I I forg I had some of the statistics written down before of how many miles that man traveled on a horse how many times in a week he preached the gospel to try to get that word out that open door that mission age look at this now and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld in low a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand continuing now to weigh out the wealth of the world pences for this and that that and I Heard a Voice a voice in the midst of the four Beast Jesus Christ say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and wine don't you touch mine those that belong to me amen Jesus is giving the devil a check on his authority a check on his ability to be able to overcome people at this time do this anointing God's standard is being raised always being raised now we come to leysia leysia church AG is the loosening of the Holy Ghost or in it in it the bright age birth forth come forth at this time the Holy Ghost now loosed finally from the bondage that it was under through all these dark ages the Holy Ghost now loosed and the Holy Ghost being loosed the Holy Ghost then began the the restoration of the gifts you had AA Street take place and all these and thank God in 1906 1906 brother Ram was born yes 1909 I forget the dates yeah I'm sorry 1906 was Aza 1909 brother Brandon was born a prophet to this age the leoda age which is simply in the scripture here represented by the by a black writer or by a pale horse rider which was all of these all accumulated into one piled up on this one age oh Hallelujah but God sending the anointing of the Flying Eagle like a flying eagle above the intelligence of man representing a bride for this day through the bride age that is going to take a rapture we still have now that same anointing again there's anointing over all the Earth Saints there's that anointing that we know the just fall the rain falls on just and unjust but there is a special significant anointing for the bride the bride that she's received in this day and thank God through the birth of a prophet a man that God could work through that for that gift of a prophecy that gift of a prophet to bring the word of God for this last days to take the bride through the revelation of the word to height she had never reached before re praise God thank God for bringing not just truth through a prophet but Revelation through the Holy Spirit to my heart so that I could see it so that it's a part of my life so that I could reach these Heights that we could go above higher than any place an eagle goes up and can see for hundreds of miles yes sir praise God nothing is impossible for this Hallelujah this standard that we are the standard bearers for takes us above every way that the Devil comes in like a flood and takes us beyond anything that the devil could bring to us or try to se us or deceive Us by oh a little sickness here or there that's one thing but sickness that's that's just as of the devil I'm talking about remember when Jesus said don't touch oil and wine he's telling them don't you uh they're they're dying in marma but don't you dare make them say hail mares and go deny the word right because that's the fundamental Foundation behind everything that God has done here and that is the that is the completion and the revelation of his word to his people in here through each one of these anointings God has a bride yes through every one of those ages even through the Dark Ages when they were specific Al anointed as Ox as Cales as burdens of bears of Burden even in there God was bringing his family bringing his children bringing his bride along to see that it's God that takes care of it and that bride is who goes in the Ramer right amen that anointing for the bride puts her in a Rapture not not not the church not the church nominal but the bride amen praise the Lord God has set in place the biggest difference that we have as for this bride this bride has found its place in Jesus Christ amen amen yes praise I got a couple quotes I can read to you here but I'm just going to forego those for now I'll read those next time amen let's stand if we could I'm going to stop there praise the Lord but now the thing just as a little before the next time we get on this when the bride leaves tribulation sets in actually brother B says Leo to see a church ages over apostasy takes over amen this bride leades but during that time remember this is the church ages the church ages ceased each one of these anointings is for the bride when the bride leaves brother Ram said Church ages in goes into apost these anointings will no longer be here during the tribulation everything that you read in the scripture everything that they go through during the tribulation friend there will be no anointing right they gave themselves in the Dark Ages what they went through they gave their lives they they they labored for that church for that age but even at that there was an anointing there for those people but friend if you're here during I heard I've heard people talk about well I'd be foolish virgin oh my you just you just don't know what you're saying right there will be no anointing for everything all of what's going on during the tribulation period there will be no anointing there will be no God here there will be no love there will be no uh purity of God to to to keep or to hold it's it's it's going to be a it's it's going to be a a horrible time God help us God help those who are remaining after the bride leaves because God is give us something to overcome all of it overcome every one of them amen amen praise the Lord thank God for his word thank God for the loosening of that spirit I mean I don't I don't mind saying uh I I'm thankful I don't live during I didn't live during the Dark Ages I'm thankful I didn't have to watch my children pulled in tube but by elephants and their bodies thrown to the Lions and I don't I'm I'm glad I didn't live during that time but it's it's it's something that God gives us to understand though that they they they they were under that anointing it it was something that was just a part of them because of what they had gone through let's sing this chorus 3:16 Lord prepare me amen put it on there but I think we probably all know it anyway Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary at your desire God help us amen thank you Jesus Lord prepare me to be a [Music] sanary pure and holy Tri and true with [Music] Thanksgiving I'll be a living Sanctuary for you one more time to him now yes Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and [Music] holy right and [Music] true with Thanksgiving I'll be a living sanary

today Saints but remember amen when that enemy comes like a flood God raises that standard the enemy comes in like a flood the standard is there Saints this is the standard and we're the standard bearers amen don't let that devil defeat you this belongs to us yes it does praise the Lord it's ours thank you Jesus amen sorry we had to postpone the communion in that um it'll probably be March now
