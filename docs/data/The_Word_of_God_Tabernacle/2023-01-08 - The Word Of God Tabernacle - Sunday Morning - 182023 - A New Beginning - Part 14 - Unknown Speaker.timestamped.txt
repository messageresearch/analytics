[24:13] this is a long one
[24:15] um sister sheily is going to have her so
[24:17] I guess it's still tomorrow at nine
[24:19] o'clock in the morning so we remember
[24:21] Sister Shelia and then she had the other
[24:23] one done we're just believing that this
[24:25] is going to be as good or better amen
[24:27] amen praise the Lord sister Lydia text
[24:29] also she desired greatly to be here
[24:32] today but uh that she had a bad cough
[24:34] and that cough came back last night she
[24:37] was up most of the night with this bad
[24:39] cough and obviously didn't want to
[24:41] interrupt the service but just pray that
[24:43] the Lord would just touch that and he'll
[24:45] sister Lydia take this call from her
[24:47] amen sister Matisse not with us today
[24:50] she uh text me earlier today and said
[24:52] that the couple that she had been
[24:55] housing
[24:56] has finally been admitted I guess into a
[24:59] rehab center so they were up all night
[25:02] packing in whatever they were doing so
[25:04] she was extremely tired but the prayer
[25:06] request is if she can get rest in her
[25:08] body from resting sleeping but uh let's
[25:10] pray for that couple
[25:12] who they are or
[25:14] is this something that Matisse does you
[25:16] all know but
[25:19] if they need help they need to place the
[25:22] state temporarily whatever they need
[25:24] some help they need to be rehabbed they
[25:26] need Jesus more than anything so if the
[25:29] Lord sent them across matisse's path to
[25:32] bring this to this place and let's just
[25:34] pray for them amen I don't know their
[25:36] names or who they are but let's please
[25:38] remember them in prayer also I have a
[25:41] request that this came to my heart that
[25:43] I wanted to let everybody know of and
[25:45] you may not know but
[25:47] for as long as I can remember there's
[25:50] been a woman who walks up and down
[25:51] Oracle uh and it has been told that her
[25:56] parent that her husband and her children
[25:58] were killed on Oracle and she she walked
[26:02] up she just been walking up and down
[26:04] ever since uh she came to our church one
[26:07] time sister Matisse took her in
[26:10] um and she came to our church home on
[26:12] the when we were at Cortaro her name is
[26:15] Lydia uh she's known affectionately in
[26:18] the neighborhood by the as the umbrella
[26:20] lady
[26:21] we back in the day always called her the
[26:23] Oracle lady because she always walked up
[26:24] and down Oracle but I guess she expanded
[26:26] and started going down Aina she got ran
[26:29] over uh on Aina
[26:31] Wednesday or Thursday I can't remember I
[26:33] think it was Wednesday didn't I tell you
[26:35] all much about it Wednesday no it was
[26:38] Thursday it was Thursday okay so then it
[26:41] was so she got she got hit by a car on
[26:44] Ina Wednesday or Thursday uh as far as I
[26:47] know I haven't heard or read the last
[26:49] thing I found in the news was she was
[26:51] still in the hospital they hadn't heard
[26:52] any updates I don't know if she's passed
[26:56] um but it was just on my heart to pray
[26:59] for her so again her name is Lydia she
[27:01] came to our church one time I didn't ask
[27:03] her about the situation with her husband
[27:06] or children or any of that I didn't want
[27:08] to get personal she just came to one
[27:10] dime tried to help her talk to her
[27:12] Matisse wanted her to stay longer she
[27:14] just wanted one night's rest in
[27:16] matisse's home and she took a shower and
[27:18] that was it
[27:19] and that's all she wanted and she left
[27:22] and so people help her all the time in
[27:25] that but I think it's kind of sad she
[27:27] got
[27:28] hit by a car on Aina you're pretty bad
[27:31] too from what I heard critical
[27:33] life-threatening they said in the news
[27:35] so let's please remember uh her if we
[27:38] could in prayer again her name is Lydia
[27:41] got this prayer request here from
[27:43] brother Dennis
[27:45] says please remember my stepdaughter
[27:48] Jill in prayer she is constantly dealing
[27:51] with severe depression
[27:54] putting a lot of pressure and weight on

[28:00] Dennis's wife on Leah's shoulders which
[28:03] is bringing Leah's Depression more
[28:06] severe as well as as well Jill is
[28:12] constantly asking for financial help
[28:14] which is a heavyweight on us

[45:41] know it's getting kind of lengthy but

[45:55] is where we're at here
[45:58] amen but as we normally do we start in
[46:00] Genesis chapter one read a couple read
[46:03] the first few verses and then before we
[46:06] do let's just bow our heads for another
[46:07] word of prayer if we could
[46:10] Precious Jesus father we are so thankful
[46:12] Your Grace your mercy your love your
[46:15] blessings Lord all that you do for us
[46:16] give to us leading and guiding and
[46:19] helping and strengthening us Lord and
[46:20] God I just appreciate so much what
[46:23] sister Pat said because sometimes I know
[46:25] of myself get discouraged lord of the
[46:28] ability to be able to do something or go
[46:30] here leading or or or or some something
[46:34] you put in my path Lord and God would
[46:36] just as humans just get so objective
[46:39] sometimes but Lord we can't know and
[46:41] have faith that there's nothing that you
[46:43] would put in our path there's nothing
[46:45] you would call for us to do there's
[46:47] nothing that you would want us to move
[46:48] forward with that you haven't already
[46:50] given us the ability to do it and we can
[46:53] reach out and claim that and believe it
[46:55] in Jesus name because it's your promise
[46:57] Lord not ours all we have to do is step
[47:00] into it believe it have faith God is
[47:03] that faith that brings us to that level
[47:05] of place of belief and truth in your
[47:07] word God and in your abilities and

[47:29] preeminence now the main part of this

[48:16] Genesis chapter 1 we'll read the first
[48:18] couple of verses in the beginning God
[48:21] created the Heaven and the Earth the
[48:23] Earth was without form and void darkness
[48:25] is upon the face of the deep and the
[48:27] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[48:29] water amen you can be seated if you'd
[48:32] like
[48:36] amen good to be back again today amen I
[48:39] want to go over back over to Revelation
[48:41] chapter 20. last week we talked about
[48:43] the setting up of the white Throne
[48:45] judgment we've obviously gone through
[48:47] our times we've gone through the
[48:48] Armageddon we've gone through the
[48:50] Millennium through uh Gog and Magog and
[48:53] the setting up of this um this white
[48:56] Throne judgment talked about last week
[48:58] of those who would be in judgment and
[49:01] those who will be judged and those who
[49:03] will be sitting on the throne with
[49:05] Christ amen the bride and those that are
[49:08] his that are uh with him as Miss Jesus
[49:12] if you will and those that will come up
[49:14] before him in judgment and those that
[49:17] will be judged by those books and uh
[49:20] we're going to talk about those books
[49:22] Lord willing next week but this week I
[49:25] wanted to enter back into this judgment
[49:28] now we read over in Daniel and we see
[49:30] here and we'll read here again we read
[49:32] over in Daniel where it uh where Daniel
[49:35] of course solved is just like John saw
[49:37] this but of course God told Daniel to
[49:40] seal it up and of course he told that it
[49:42] would be revealed in this last days even
[49:44] to John the Revelator so he realized
[49:46] that at this time that God is showing
[49:48] and revealing and helping us know uh the
[49:50] things of the scripture that's unfolding
[49:52] to us uh and but but Daniel did give a
[49:56] very good depiction description of of
[49:59] this very scene of this why as we call
[50:02] it to Noah as the white Throne judgment
[50:05] scene or the white Throne is the final
[50:07] judgment uh we know that judgment
[50:10] continues on all the time uh God sends
[50:13] warning though before he issues judgment
[50:16] but judgments continue to go forward in
[50:19] life amen even the Bible says you shall
[50:22] know them by the fruits they bear uh
[50:24] that's a judgment but the final judgment
[50:27] is the white Throne judgment the
[50:30] Judgment that is the final separation
[50:32] between believer and unbeliever between
[50:34] Satan and God those two vines that grew
[50:39] up together through the church ages
[50:40] God's going to take that one Vine and
[50:42] it's going to be cast into the lake of
[50:44] fire while the other one goes and enjoys
[50:46] eternal life uh in the most beautiful
[50:48] place that Noah has ever seen there has
[50:50] never heard a nor is entering the heart
[50:52] of man what it's going to be like that
[50:54] God's got in store for us yeah but uh as
[50:57] as he gave us this depiction Daniel did
[51:00] and John the Revelator which you'll read
[51:02] here uh that this uh that this white
[51:05] Throne judgment has now been set up
[51:08] there's the premiere of it uh we sort of
[51:11] maybe can get a vision of it's a little
[51:13] difficult but we try to maybe get a
[51:16] little vision of what we're looking at
[51:17] now what we can see what the scripture
[51:20] is revealing to us and helping us
[51:22] understand uh but now in Revelation 20.
[51:25] I do want to read this part again
[51:26] Revelation chapter 20 uh verse 11. and I
[51:30] saw a great white throne and him that
[51:33] sat on it from whom's face the Earth and
[51:36] Heaven fled away and there was no found
[51:39] no place for them which we just talked
[51:41] about last week and I saw the dead small
[51:44] and great stand before God and the books
[51:48] were opened and another book was opened
[51:51] which is The Book of Life again which
[51:54] we'll get into those books next week
[51:56] whether it takes a week or two on those
[51:59] I'm not sure I'm trying to I'm trying to
[52:01] not take I think the last time we talked
[52:04] about the books here over in Cortaro we
[52:06] I took four or five services to do it
[52:09] but I'm kind of just trying to take the
[52:11] highlights this time uh and just make it
[52:13] into one service and we'll just see
[52:15] however the Lord leads us that's all I
[52:17] want to do is whatever he'd have me to
[52:19] do the book Trope and another book was
[52:22] open which is The Book of Life and the
[52:24] dead were judged out of those things now
[52:26] this is a part one of the parts I want
[52:28] to get to that we the one of the things
[52:30] that we want to talk about today
[52:33] uh the dead were judged out of those
[52:36] things which were written in the books
[52:37] according to their Works amen and the
[52:41] Sea gave up the dead which were in it
[52:43] the dead and Hell delivered up the dead
[52:45] which were in them and they were judged
[52:48] every man according to their words
[52:51] and death and hell were cast into the
[52:54] Lake of Fire this is the second death
[52:56] and whosoever was not found written in
[52:59] the Book of Life was cast into the Lake
[53:01] of Fire now we had this set up we
[53:04] realized that the bride the righteous
[53:06] those that redeemed those that received
[53:08] the blood of Christ who uh who did not
[53:11] reject it uh were born again filled with
[53:14] the Holy Spirit we could go through that
[53:16] in uh in Matthew 25 the first part of
[53:19] Matthew 25 which we will go over to
[53:22] Matthew 25 but I wasn't intending on
[53:25] reading the scripture about the ten
[53:26] virgins uh but you can see where the
[53:29] five foot the five wise virgins had oil
[53:31] in their land right Amen in their
[53:33] vessels and in their lamps and the five
[53:36] foolish only had enough in their vessel
[53:39] to sustain them for a period of time
[53:42] which again is just simply The Same
[53:44] Spirit but an anointing on the flesh
[53:47] rather than an indwelling presence of
[53:49] Christ in a person's soul right which is
[53:52] the new birth there's the difference
[53:54] between the foolish virgin and the wise
[53:56] version they're all virgins they're all
[53:59] virtuous they're all undefiled by men
[54:01] they're all undefiled by men's ideas
[54:04] opinions doctrines but five had oil in
[54:07] their vessels and in their lamps and the
[54:09] other five only had it enough in their
[54:12] lamps enough that went out that was in
[54:14] their flesh not in their soul they
[54:17] weren't born again they just had a
[54:19] spirit on them it's brother random
[54:21] talked about it in false anointing ones
[54:23] at the end time these people are
[54:26] anointed they absolutely have an
[54:28] anointing of the Holy Spirit but that
[54:30] anointing only goes as deep as the flesh
[54:33] or the spirit it is not a new birth yes
[54:37] a new birth changes a person from the
[54:40] inside out and makes you a part of of
[54:43] Christ the word amen and seals that
[54:46] spirit in there by the Holy Spirit to
[54:49] where no one could get in or out of
[54:52] there ever again and sealed until you're
[54:54] the day of your destination so these
[54:57] five that are foolish they have the Holy
[54:59] Ghost but only enough on their flesh
[55:01] only enough to jump and dance or shout
[55:03] or have a tingling in their Spirit or a
[55:05] manifestation of a of a gift of some
[55:08] kind or something and but yet they
[55:10] weren't actually born again they didn't
[55:12] actually receive the new birth of the
[55:15] Holy Spirit coming in their soul and
[55:17] there's the difference between the wise
[55:19] virgin who is born again the foolish
[55:22] virgin who simply has an anointing amen
[55:24] so as we go upon that we recognize that
[55:27] the bride those that are part of him
[55:30] that were born again that didn't receive
[55:33] the new birth are with him on the throne
[55:36] in judgment yeah they're judging the
[55:38] rest of humanity as theirs I say I will
[55:41] say Miss Jesus because she's a part of
[55:44] him yeah she's becoming part of him now
[55:47] she he's become her she's become him he
[55:50] took my place so I could take his amen
[55:53] God when it mentions as we said last
[55:55] week God he's talking about not just God
[55:57] he's talking about his bride his wife
[56:00] who we are was set with him in his
[56:04] throne in Judgment of the rest of
[56:06] humanity which includes the foolish
[56:09] virgins that come forth now uh there's
[56:12] uh brother random talks about of course
[56:14] in in a couple of places where there's
[56:16] uh the foolish virgins that are at the
[56:18] end time
[56:20] that go into the tribulation period and
[56:22] they have to seal their testimony of
[56:25] Jesus with their own blood
[56:27] but he also tells us that there is
[56:29] foolish virgin and wise Virgin uh
[56:33] through every age so we know there's
[56:35] bride in every age we already although
[56:38] that's very well established there's
[56:40] bride in every age but there is also
[56:42] foolish virgin in every age amen amen
[56:45] that come through and uh how God gets
[56:48] them to that point of of the ones at the
[56:51] end where they seal their testimony with
[56:53] their blood did that as they would have
[56:55] even in the Dark Ages and through those
[56:57] times it was foolish and wise virgins
[57:00] amen those foolish however because see
[57:04] from the damn Pentecost nothing has
[57:06] changed
[57:07] from the day of Pentecost it took a new
[57:10] birth to be in Christ amen from the from
[57:13] that day when the 120 received in the
[57:15] upper room that was the precedent that
[57:17] was the scriptural precedent that was
[57:19] set for everyone that ever desired to be
[57:22] or say they were a Christian you had to
[57:24] have a new birth you must be born again
[57:27] there was no uh there was no a wiggle
[57:30] room here you must be born again Jesus
[57:32] told Nicodemus you must be born again
[57:34] and the precedent the scriptural preced
[57:37] that set at the dead Pentecost the 120
[57:40] there that received a new birth they
[57:42] received the spirit of God on them and
[57:45] in them and there's the difference and
[57:49] from that time everyone that had that
[57:51] that claimed to be a Christian that said
[57:53] they were that believed they were had to
[57:56] have that new birth
[57:57] that's how you that that is your ticket
[57:59] that is your token that that is your
[58:02] that is your uh uh your past to get on
[58:07] the train damn I the boat the plane the
[58:09] whatever the rocket ship whatever you
[58:11] want to call it uh the to go in the
[58:13] Rapture you have to have that ticket you
[58:17] have to have that token you must be born
[58:19] again there's no leeway so everyone
[58:21] through there had to have that those who
[58:24] did not if they stayed virtuous and fell
[58:27] under that same category as a foolish
[58:29] virgin will still yet come up for the
[58:32] wipes on judgment in fact all of the
[58:35] rest of humanity comes up before the
[58:36] Judgment at that time every one of them
[58:39] because it's that final judgment amen
[58:42] that's why it says
[58:44] I saw the dead small and great stand
[58:47] before God
[58:48] all of the Nations
[58:51] came before at this one place it's all a
[58:54] gathering now
[58:55] some came to church
[58:58] during life
[59:00] many came to the place of Armageddon
[59:05] some went through the Millennium inside
[59:07] the city outside
[59:10] some lived through and went through Gog
[59:13] and Magog
[59:14] but everybody will be here right every
[59:19] knee will bow and every tongue will
[59:22] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[59:24] everyone
[59:25] so they all small great Rich poor
[59:29] whoever they are everyone comes to this
[59:32] place
[59:33] atheists agnostics Buddhists Hindus
[59:37] whoever they are every one of them will
[59:39] come to this judgment Throne amen and
[59:42] they'll have to give an account for
[59:44] their lives how now in the books
[59:48] according to their Works yes according
[59:51] to their words he says that twice here
[59:54] in the scripture they were judged every
[59:56] man according to their words now there's
[1:00:00] going to be some crossover here between
[1:00:02] here in the books the next Sunday
[1:00:06] but I want us to understand
[1:00:08] that since the bride is on the throne
[1:00:12] it helps us to understand that the book
[1:00:16] of your Deeds as the human carnality
[1:00:20] part of yourself was
[1:00:22] has been by the blood of Christ put in
[1:00:25] his sea of forgetfulness right
[1:00:27] amen so the Deeds that it that it reads
[1:00:31] out of these books for all of humanity
[1:00:34] except the Bride of yours is annihilated
[1:00:39] amen your your Deeds God's not judging
[1:00:43] you by your Deeds because you received
[1:00:45] the blood of Jesus Christ and Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ annihilated every sin by his
[1:00:50] blood that would ever be accounted to
[1:00:53] you
[1:00:54] amen so when the books are open to look
[1:00:57] at any kind of Deeds no we don't make it
[1:01:00] by Deeds
[1:01:01] amen we only make it by his blood yes
[1:01:04] that's the only way we make it now the
[1:01:06] others that have the Deeds that they're
[1:01:08] read they rejected Christ they did not
[1:01:12] become born again and they and they're
[1:01:15] working on making it by their words you
[1:01:18] hear a lot of people say that I mean
[1:01:20] honestly that's the fundamental
[1:01:22] foundation of the Catholic Doctrine yes
[1:01:24] is by your Deeds by your works you must
[1:01:28] earn your way to heaven and a lot of
[1:01:31] people even that are Catholic I hear
[1:01:33] people that say they're Christians try
[1:01:36] to work their way to heaven friend you
[1:01:37] cannot do it yeah
[1:01:39] yeah you cannot you cannot do enough
[1:01:42] things in life to try to offset the sin
[1:01:45] and iniquity that we accumulated just
[1:01:49] from our birth right
[1:01:51] which we had nothing to do with but amen
[1:01:54] but that
[1:01:56] rejection is what puts a person in this
[1:02:00] position
[1:02:01] the receiving of Christ takes that deed
[1:02:05] of yours and does away with it so you're
[1:02:08] not judged according to your words
[1:02:10] you're judged according to Christ amen
[1:02:13] amen the word by the blood that's
[1:02:15] already been cleansed that's already
[1:02:18] been judged and found not guilty
[1:02:20] because you have become him
[1:02:22] there's no sin in him how can there be
[1:02:24] any sin in you right if you are born
[1:02:27] again and your very Soul which is the
[1:02:29] one that uh that that stands before God
[1:02:32] if that is controlled and owned and
[1:02:36] occupied by God himself then how can
[1:02:39] there be any sin in there
[1:02:41] there cannot
[1:02:43] so if there's if the devil wants to
[1:02:45] write down something you did bad this
[1:02:47] week or something you said bad that you
[1:02:50] put under the blood of Christ it's
[1:02:52] annihilated out of that book there's no
[1:02:54] book left for you
[1:02:56] I'll read you a quote next week but like
[1:02:58] I said these are going to cross over a
[1:03:00] little bit but now the others that come
[1:03:02] to be judged they are just according to
[1:03:04] their Works where are those Works those
[1:03:06] works are recorded in a book right amen
[1:03:09] all the things they say all the things
[1:03:12] they do remember last week we read the
[1:03:14] quote brother random said even to their
[1:03:15] very thoughts right their very folks are
[1:03:18] being recorded here and will be read
[1:03:20] forth and will be shown for us brother
[1:03:23] man talked about that great screen
[1:03:25] across the sky that that will be shown
[1:03:29] for everyone to see there's no deny it
[1:03:32] then you can hide stuff for people now
[1:03:35] you can lie about it you can do it in
[1:03:37] secret you can do it in a closet but
[1:03:39] there's no way you can hide it from God
[1:03:41] right amen and when that time comes
[1:03:43] there'll be no hiding it there'll be no
[1:03:46] privacy there'll be no secrecy there'll
[1:03:48] be no secret compartment that you tuck
[1:03:51] this away in it'll be there for everyone
[1:03:53] to see amen for these words now let's go
[1:03:56] to uh Matthew chapter 25.
[1:04:00] let's fortify this with some scripture
[1:04:06] Matthew 25 is obviously the first part
[1:04:09] of it is talks about the 10 virgins
[1:04:11] which we sort of give a brief synopsis
[1:04:14] about if you want to go back if you have
[1:04:16] never read about the 10 verses you can
[1:04:18] go back to Matthew 25 1-13
[1:04:22] read about those virgins and find out uh
[1:04:26] why some went in and some did why did
[1:04:30] the why did the wise virgins go in with
[1:04:33] Christ
[1:04:34] and the and the foolish did not even to
[1:04:37] the point that the foolish even knocked
[1:04:40] and spoke
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:44] this is the 10th verse I'll just read
[1:04:45] this and while they went to buy
[1:04:48] the oil because their oil ran out all
[1:04:51] they had was what was on their flesh
[1:04:52] they didn't have enough to get them in a
[1:04:54] rapture
[1:04:55] the bridegroom came and they were ready
[1:04:57] and they that were ready went in with
[1:04:59] him to the marriage and the door was
[1:05:01] shut
[1:05:01] afterward came also the other virgins
[1:05:04] saying Lord Lord open to us and he
[1:05:07] answered and said barely I say unto you
[1:05:08] I know you're not now
[1:05:10] that no is a different no than when he
[1:05:15] talks about I never knew you when he
[1:05:18] talks to that group of people earlier in
[1:05:21] in John he says a depart from me ye that
[1:05:24] work iniquity I never knew you that
[1:05:26] means I never had relation with you I
[1:05:28] don't know you we've we've not had any
[1:05:31] Fellowship communion uh relationship
[1:05:34] intimacy I never knew you but when he
[1:05:37] says I know you not here
[1:05:40] he's not telling These Foolish virgins
[1:05:42] that same thing if you look it up it's a
[1:05:45] different word he's saying I am not
[1:05:48] acknowledging you
[1:05:50] I am ignoring you is what he's saying I
[1:05:54] know you not is saying I'm not I'm
[1:05:56] ignoring you I I'm I'm not listening to
[1:06:00] you amen because this has already been
[1:06:03] done you had your chance and you didn't
[1:06:06] you didn't
[1:06:08] follow through
[1:06:10] you weren't born again
[1:06:12] the door's been shut the marriage been
[1:06:15] set with one to the marriage sufferer of
[1:06:16] the Lamb I'm ignoring you because it's
[1:06:20] finished
[1:06:21] and what is left is left to them that
[1:06:25] they are to go into tribulation amen so
[1:06:28] he says I the door was shut
[1:06:30] and he came and said open to us no I
[1:06:33] know you're not he's ignoring them watch
[1:06:34] therefore for you know near the hour day
[1:06:36] when the son of man cometh now let's go
[1:06:38] over to the 31st verse after this
[1:06:41] now the great scholar Scofield
[1:06:44] disagrees with uh what I'm about to tell
[1:06:47] you what I feel the Lord has showed me
[1:06:49] and and through the message I believe
[1:06:52] that brother Branham taught uh helps us
[1:06:55] realize that uh the great Dr Scofield
[1:06:59] was wrong right
[1:07:00] uh he believes that this that we're
[1:07:03] about to read was is not the great white
[1:07:06] Throne judgment
[1:07:07] uh because of a couple of semantical
[1:07:10] things that he says that the scripture
[1:07:12] doesn't specifically identify at this
[1:07:14] point
[1:07:15] although we do see that at the beginning
[1:07:18] of this chapter a Rapture takes place of
[1:07:22] the of the wise virgins right
[1:07:25] hey so it's got to be after that point
[1:07:29] uh but he makes a denotation of
[1:07:32] different things but there's some things
[1:07:34] I want to show you that also help
[1:07:37] solidify that this is speaking about the
[1:07:40] white Throne judgment but now listen
[1:07:43] uh 31st first 25 25th chapter 31st birth
[1:07:48] when the son of man shall come in his
[1:07:50] glory
[1:07:52] and all the Holy Angels with him
[1:07:55] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:07:58] glory
[1:07:59] amen now when was the son of man to sit
[1:08:03] according to scripture upon his throne
[1:08:05] of Glory
[1:08:08] that would be my question if this man
[1:08:10] was still alive
[1:08:12] what other time does the scripture tell
[1:08:15] us
[1:08:16] that he is to set on his throne of Glory
[1:08:20] amen well let's keep it let's keep going
[1:08:22] then
[1:08:23] and before him before him shall be
[1:08:27] gathered all nations
[1:08:29] and he shall separate them one from
[1:08:32] another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep
[1:08:35] from the goats
[1:08:37] now they're in judgment they are the
[1:08:39] ones being judged remember now we've got
[1:08:42] the Judgment all set
[1:08:44] these ones that are coming up before the
[1:08:47] throne as he's sitting on the throne
[1:08:49] with his bride in that throne with him
[1:08:52] in judgment
[1:08:54] All Nations come before him and he
[1:08:58] begins to separate them as a Shepherd
[1:09:01] would divide his sheep from the goats
[1:09:03] now it does not say that they are sheep
[1:09:08] it does not say that they are ghosts
[1:09:11] follow me with what the scripture says
[1:09:13] it says they accept he separates them
[1:09:16] one from another
[1:09:18] as a Shepherd would
[1:09:21] it's not saying they are it's saying
[1:09:25] that this is a a a a metaphor of what a
[1:09:30] Shepherd would do by separating the
[1:09:32] sheep from the goats he's not saying
[1:09:34] they're sheep and he's not saying there
[1:09:36] goes he's saying he divides them as a
[1:09:39] Shepherd would separate his sheep from
[1:09:42] the goats you understand
[1:09:44] it's like people I I don't want to
[1:09:47] create any controversy here but it's
[1:09:48] like
[1:09:50] in my opinion I differ with some people
[1:09:52] when they say that Jesus uh was bleeding
[1:09:55] in the Garden of Gethsemane he was
[1:09:57] bleeding but that's not what the Bible
[1:09:59] says
[1:10:01] the Bible says and if you believe that
[1:10:03] that's okay we're not going to fight
[1:10:05] over this but the Bible says that his
[1:10:09] sweat
[1:10:11] became as it were drops of blood it does
[1:10:15] not say they are drops of blood it said
[1:10:18] his sweat became as it were drops of
[1:10:21] blood so in other words his sweat would
[1:10:24] be pouring off his body like pouring
[1:10:26] this water out of a bottle
[1:10:28] not blood as it were well this is the
[1:10:32] same type to me you read the scriptures
[1:10:34] you got to follow what the scripture
[1:10:36] says it would be as it were a Shepherd
[1:10:40] separating his sheeps from the goats
[1:10:42] that's all he's saying amen I mean you
[1:10:45] could go play a game of checkers what's
[1:10:47] the first thing you're going to do when
[1:10:48] you open the Checker box you're going to
[1:10:49] separate the red ones the chips from the
[1:10:52] black chips
[1:10:53] well you could you could use that you
[1:10:56] could use that a metaphor just as much
[1:10:58] as you could anything
[1:10:59] you're just separating them that's all
[1:11:01] he's talking about he's just saying as
[1:11:03] it were so when people say well these
[1:11:06] are sheep so they got to be bright he
[1:11:08] didn't say they were sheeps he just said
[1:11:10] he's separating him as they as if it
[1:11:14] were a Shepherd dividing amen what if it
[1:11:18] were a checkered player separating his
[1:11:20] red chips from his black chips
[1:11:23] or whatever they call them they're not
[1:11:25] chips I guess
[1:11:26] amen that's all he's talking about amen
[1:11:28] it's it's just it's a time of of
[1:11:31] Separation okay let's move on
[1:11:34] and he and he shall set the sheep on his
[1:11:38] right hand but the goats on the left now
[1:11:41] remember the right hand is the point of
[1:11:43] authority okay the right hand of God is
[1:11:45] a point of authority not a literal fin
[1:11:48] but a par a point of authority
[1:11:51] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:11:54] right hand
[1:11:55] Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:11:58] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:12:00] foundation of the world
[1:12:02] for now you say well then that means
[1:12:06] that uh that these that this was
[1:12:09] prepared before the foundation were for
[1:12:10] them so that's got to be the pride no it
[1:12:12] doesn't right it's just saying that the
[1:12:16] kingdom that they're going to be allowed
[1:12:18] to become a part of was created for the
[1:12:22] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:12:25] and they're going to be a part of it it
[1:12:27] was prepared before for them from before
[1:12:29] the foundation of the world because now
[1:12:31] they are a part of it and remember when
[1:12:34] you start entering into the eternals of
[1:12:36] God you start recognizing that God knew
[1:12:40] all this the beginning to the end
[1:12:42] amen or as it were a beginning and as it
[1:12:46] were there's an end there's no beginning
[1:12:48] or ending to Eternal we know that but as
[1:12:51] it were see from the foundation of the
[1:12:54] world that does not make them bribe amen
[1:12:57] amen it just means that they're
[1:12:59] inheriting life now why has God put some
[1:13:04] on the right as they were sheep
[1:13:06] why would he put some on the right that
[1:13:08] the scripture actually calls later as
[1:13:10] righteous amen and the only way you can
[1:13:12] become righteous is by the blood of
[1:13:14] Christ amen amen but remember These
[1:13:17] Foolish virgins sealed their testimony
[1:13:20] of Christ by their own blood
[1:13:24] amen for I wasn't hungered and he gave
[1:13:28] me so they're asked this is their
[1:13:29] question let me get back to this then
[1:13:31] shall the king say unto them on the
[1:13:33] right hand Come Ye blessed of my father
[1:13:35] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[1:13:37] from the foundation of the world for I
[1:13:39] wasn't humbered and you gave me me now
[1:13:42] what's he doing
[1:13:43] he's judging them by what
[1:13:46] not by the blood of Christ right but by
[1:13:49] their Works yes amen isn't that exactly
[1:13:53] what Revelation 20 just told us that
[1:13:55] when he opens the books he judges them
[1:13:58] twice it says it by their words what's
[1:14:02] God telling them here how was he able to
[1:14:05] separate them from the right to the left
[1:14:08] because of their works because the books
[1:14:12] that were open and out of those books
[1:14:14] were read The Works remember last week I
[1:14:17] told you
[1:14:18] that there will be times even as the
[1:14:21] Bride As the wife will be sitting there
[1:14:24] in judgment
[1:14:25] and say
[1:14:27] when I was on Earth he did this for me
[1:14:31] yes he he was here for me she was here
[1:14:34] for me uh
[1:14:36] I I was broke down on the side of the
[1:14:39] road never saw this person my entire
[1:14:41] life haven't seen him since but I had a
[1:14:44] bad flat tire and I couldn't fix it and
[1:14:45] this person stopped and took their time
[1:14:47] energy effort and they fixed this tire
[1:14:49] for me and that person comes up in
[1:14:51] judgment right
[1:14:53] you don't think there's going to be some
[1:14:55] mercy towards that person because of
[1:14:57] that yeah
[1:14:58] amen let's read for I was hungry and you
[1:15:02] gave me me I was thirsty and you gave me
[1:15:05] drink I was a stranger and you took me
[1:15:08] in
[1:15:09] naked and you clothed me I was sick and
[1:15:13] you visited me I was in prison and you
[1:15:16] came unto me
[1:15:18] then shall the righteous hears where it
[1:15:20] calls them righteous how did they become
[1:15:22] righteous amen
[1:15:25] praise the Lord answer him
[1:15:27] people want to put God in such a box
[1:15:30] they want to put
[1:15:32] us in a box the blood of Christ it it
[1:15:36] can only do this it can do exactly what
[1:15:39] God says and he'll do it'll reach to the
[1:15:42] lowest lows right remember before the
[1:15:45] blood of Christ was even shed God gave
[1:15:49] Cade a space to repent right
[1:15:53] hey the grace of God is so prevalent and
[1:15:57] so enormous
[1:15:59] and so far-reaching he gave the son of
[1:16:02] the serpent the devil a chance to repent
[1:16:07] Jesus God told him I will accept you if
[1:16:10] you'll do right yeah of course he
[1:16:13] couldn't do it wouldn't do it couldn't
[1:16:15] do it but he gave him a space to repent
[1:16:17] friend who are we to save
[1:16:20] I know one thing brother Ram said we'll
[1:16:22] be surprised to people that's going to
[1:16:23] be there right yeah and we'll be very
[1:16:26] surprised the people that won't be there
[1:16:27] right I had to vary to that I don't
[1:16:29] think he said very well be surprised the
[1:16:32] people that are there and surprise
[1:16:34] probably the people that aren't going to
[1:16:36] be there amen it
[1:16:39] It's just sometimes it confounds the
[1:16:42] natural mind we want to try to have it
[1:16:44] all figured out and all worked out and
[1:16:46] this is going to be there and that one's
[1:16:48] going to be there exactly who God has
[1:16:49] planned for before the foundation world
[1:16:51] is going to be there yes amen
[1:16:54] praise the Lord
[1:17:01] let's see where do we go no stranger you
[1:17:04] took me and naked you clothed me I was
[1:17:06] sick you visited me and I was in prison
[1:17:08] you came into me then shall the
[1:17:09] righteous
[1:17:10] answer him saying Lord
[1:17:13] when saw we thee and hungered and fed
[1:17:16] thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when
[1:17:19] saw we thee a stranger and took the end
[1:17:22] or naked and clothed thee or when saw we
[1:17:25] thee sick or in prison and came unto
[1:17:28] thee
[1:17:30] and the King answered shall answer and
[1:17:33] say unto them barely I say unto you in
[1:17:37] as much as ye have done it unto one of
[1:17:40] these
[1:17:42] I could just see him pointing to the
[1:17:44] bride
[1:17:46] I can see him pointing to his wife here
[1:17:48] sitting in the throne as you've done it
[1:17:50] onto one of these the least of my
[1:17:53] brethren that'll be me
[1:17:55] have done it unto me amen praise the
[1:17:59] Lord
[1:18:00] now that's the scripture
[1:18:02] that's judging them based on their words
[1:18:06] which is what they will have to rely
[1:18:09] upon when they get there now no doubt
[1:18:12] there'll be people that obviously are on
[1:18:14] the right hand that will be granted life
[1:18:17] for the Judgment of their works but I'm
[1:18:21] telling you here friend I don't want to
[1:18:22] be one of those ones that takes the
[1:18:25] chance of being judged by my words right
[1:18:30] my words
[1:18:32] my words are filthy rags right
[1:18:36] right I don't want to be there and take
[1:18:39] a chance because I've had people tell me
[1:18:42] so well
[1:18:43] maybe they're foolish virgin to go
[1:18:45] through the tribulation why would you
[1:18:46] even say that I've had people I've heard
[1:18:48] people saying about the kids why yeah
[1:18:51] why would you say that about your
[1:18:53] children why would you say it about your
[1:18:55] grandchild I don't care how they're
[1:18:56] living I don't care what it looks like
[1:18:59] yeah I would never go there about that
[1:19:02] that is the last thing I would think
[1:19:04] about Now is it going to happen for
[1:19:07] people sure it is but I don't believe
[1:19:09] that for my children my grandchildren my
[1:19:11] family I don't believe that
[1:19:14] I don't and I would never want to put
[1:19:16] them there nor would I want to think of
[1:19:17] even for a moment to be there in
[1:19:19] judgment
[1:19:20] oh friend when the when the Fountain of
[1:19:23] Christ and the blood of Christ is so
[1:19:26] wide open to receive any and any
[1:19:28] everybody that would that would want it
[1:19:30] and receive it and come to him and
[1:19:32] surrender their lives to him as he gave
[1:19:34] his life for us why would you not do it
[1:19:38] why when the when the Holy Spirit in
[1:19:41] this last day is still there just
[1:19:44] pulsating to come into your life why
[1:19:47] would you reject him
[1:19:49] I just don't understand that
[1:19:51] but he's still there
[1:19:53] the opportunity still exists
[1:19:56] the place the the the point the
[1:19:58] opportunity it's still there for anybody
[1:20:02] that would receive it am I anybody that
[1:20:05] wants it desires it
[1:20:07] amen oh God Let It Be Lord
[1:20:12] I never want to be in that place yes
[1:20:14] they will be granted life but now notice
[1:20:16] now
[1:20:17] I will say this I said it once we'll get
[1:20:20] into it more detail later but these
[1:20:22] people are not bright but these people
[1:20:26] will not be inheritors of of The
[1:20:30] Inheritance that is allotted to the
[1:20:32] bride these people will not be in the
[1:20:36] new city the New Jerusalem right they
[1:20:38] will not be in that walled City they
[1:20:41] will not be there they'll be granted
[1:20:43] life absolutely but there'll be workers
[1:20:45] outside the city right now don't let
[1:20:48] that confound you Lord willing we'll
[1:20:50] talk about that more later but they are
[1:20:52] not inheritors of the things that the
[1:20:53] bride is inheritors of and they will not
[1:20:55] be in that new city
[1:20:57] only thing that they have is life that's
[1:21:00] it God just grants them life I mean I I
[1:21:04] shouldn't say that's it because
[1:21:07] that's quite a gift
[1:21:09] uh but that but that's all
[1:21:12] that's all they don't they're not
[1:21:14] inheritors of anything that the bride is
[1:21:16] here if you think that that vaults them
[1:21:19] into the position of where the bride is
[1:21:21] no no no it doesn't absolutely not
[1:21:23] God just God just in his
[1:21:27] in this Mercies
[1:21:29] and through the Judgment at that joke
[1:21:31] because remember God's a fair judge he's
[1:21:34] going to judge them fairly righteously
[1:21:35] he judged them in this way
[1:21:39] to allow them to have life
[1:21:42] let's continue on
[1:21:44] when you've done to know one of these
[1:21:46] the least of my brother you have done it
[1:21:48] unto me
[1:21:49] then shall he say unto uh on them on the
[1:21:53] left hand depart from me ye cursed into
[1:21:56] Everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[1:21:59] and his angels now if this is not the
[1:22:03] white Throne judgment
[1:22:04] then why are these people that we know
[1:22:07] cannot be cast into the lake of fire
[1:22:10] until the white Throne judgment how can
[1:22:12] this not be that right
[1:22:15] sorry Mr Schofield but uh
[1:22:18] you your analogy is starting to break
[1:22:22] apart
[1:22:23] because these people that are that are
[1:22:25] put on the left which in my opinion will
[1:22:28] be the majority of people the majority
[1:22:30] of people will be on the left not the
[1:22:32] right there will be multitudes on the
[1:22:35] right which we'll talk about in a minute
[1:22:36] if hopefully I can get to that uh
[1:22:38] that'll be on the right but the far
[1:22:40] majority will be the people on the left
[1:22:42] sad to say but true
[1:22:45] amen close remember uh abroad is the
[1:22:48] gate and many find it and there is the
[1:22:50] way if you find it so uh we can know
[1:22:53] through other scripture that those that
[1:22:56] don't will be the far majority of the
[1:22:58] those that do
[1:23:01] so he says then shall he say to them
[1:23:03] with us depart from me ye curse into
[1:23:06] Everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[1:23:08] and his angels so if this isn't the
[1:23:10] right your own judgment then what is it
[1:23:13] what other scriptural precedent if
[1:23:16] anybody wants to continue to think that
[1:23:17] way what other scriptural precedent do
[1:23:20] we have that tells us of this event
[1:23:24] other than the white Throne judgment
[1:23:27] there's not
[1:23:28] and God doesn't send anybody into a lake
[1:23:30] of fire until after the final white
[1:23:33] Throne judgment right amen
[1:23:38] if people tell you there's somebody in
[1:23:40] hell now that's wrong right if they say
[1:23:43] there's that that in the the pits of
[1:23:45] fire and that's wrong okay if you say
[1:23:47] hell is in Hades the grave I'm okay with
[1:23:50] that but the Lake of Fire
[1:23:52] it does that's not true they're not
[1:23:55] cannot be until after that final
[1:23:58] judgment cannot be yes
[1:24:00] if I was in Hungary and you gave me no
[1:24:02] meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[1:24:04] drink I was a stranger you took me not
[1:24:07] in naked and you clothed me not sick and
[1:24:10] in prison you visited me not then shall
[1:24:13] they answer unto him saying Lord
[1:24:15] When shall we uh saw we thee and
[1:24:18] hungered or a thirst or stranger or
[1:24:20] naked or sick or in prison and did not
[1:24:22] Minister unto thee then shall he answer
[1:24:24] them saying verily I say unto you
[1:24:27] inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
[1:24:30] these Elisa uh the least of these you
[1:24:33] did it not to me
[1:24:35] and these shall go away into Everlasting
[1:24:38] punishment but the righteous into life
[1:24:41] eternal now notice the differentiation
[1:24:44] here yes it tells them that those that
[1:24:47] are on the left go into an everlasting
[1:24:50] punishment not eternal amen Everlasting
[1:24:54] is a long time but it had a beginning
[1:24:57] and it will have an end just like we
[1:24:58] said last week hell was created
[1:25:01] and if hell was created it had a
[1:25:04] beginning and anything that has a
[1:25:06] beginning will have an end yes
[1:25:08] Everlasting yes not eternal but what did
[1:25:12] he tell them that are as described now
[1:25:15] here as the righteous into life
[1:25:19] eternal
[1:25:20] they are granted eternal life praise the
[1:25:24] Lord that's just the that's just the
[1:25:27] mercies of God Amen that's just the
[1:25:30] goodness of God that God gives that
[1:25:31] God's uh mercy and Grace look and and
[1:25:35] the Judgment now
[1:25:37] the Judgment of those of their works out
[1:25:40] of the books it's like I said
[1:25:43] I was stuck on the side of the road I
[1:25:45] had no hope no help no way out and
[1:25:47] somebody stopped and and did this I had
[1:25:50] one time brother Pat and brother Dennis
[1:25:52] can account to this one time in my
[1:25:55] stupidity I ran out of gas on Cortaro
[1:25:58] going to church
[1:25:59] and some people from nowhere they
[1:26:04] stopped their truck behind me they got
[1:26:05] out and they helped push my car off the
[1:26:07] side of the road they got their truck
[1:26:08] and left I'll never see those people
[1:26:10] again the rest of my life but I might
[1:26:11] see them but I will see him one day
[1:26:13] right
[1:26:15] now what do you think my judgment's
[1:26:17] going to be on them
[1:26:19] amen does that give them eternal life I
[1:26:21] don't know
[1:26:23] but if but if I have a say so I'm going
[1:26:26] to say something positive about these
[1:26:27] people that help me see we entertain
[1:26:30] angels unaware sometimes friend we don't
[1:26:32] realize they might be clothed like a
[1:26:34] homeless person they might be of a
[1:26:36] different nationality tongue race they
[1:26:38] might be of a different religion we
[1:26:40] don't know
[1:26:41] but a lot of times entertaining angels
[1:26:43] unaware and and also Entertaining Angels
[1:26:47] Aware
[1:26:48] as you've done it unto these the least
[1:26:51] of my little ones you've done it to me
[1:26:54] praise the Lord well that all factors
[1:26:56] into in my humble opinion the
[1:27:01] the the the the
[1:27:02] righteous Judgment of God
[1:27:05] according to the books don't you think
[1:27:07] that it was written down when those men
[1:27:10] jumped out of their truck didn't have to
[1:27:12] people zimming by left and right
[1:27:14] couldn't care if you're stuck just
[1:27:16] you're an annoyance to them you're in my
[1:27:17] way these people stop and push me you
[1:27:19] don't think that's not written in one of
[1:27:21] their books
[1:27:24] amen and I'll be the first one to stand
[1:27:27] up to say I was the one they did that to
[1:27:30] you amen does that give them eternal
[1:27:32] life I'm not saying it though right but
[1:27:35] if you if you want something from me or
[1:27:38] if you understand how I feel about it
[1:27:40] they're going to get a positive review
[1:27:42] on my on my account amen amen you see
[1:27:46] Yelp doesn't have anything on these
[1:27:49] books friend uh nothing you can put all
[1:27:53] kind of reviews on there you want on
[1:27:54] Yelp or whatever they are but when it
[1:27:57] comes to this time right when when
[1:28:00] Christ is sitting there and his bride
[1:28:02] and she's in judgment
[1:28:04] she said he's out
[1:28:07] cars zooming all around me and these
[1:28:09] these guys specifically stopped took
[1:28:10] their time pushed my car out of the way
[1:28:13] and got in their truck and left
[1:28:15] didn't know who they were don't know
[1:28:18] where they came from don't know where
[1:28:20] they went
[1:28:21] but they helped me
[1:28:23] has somebody done that to you before
[1:28:25] yeah
[1:28:26] and I don't mean push
[1:28:28] but I mean help you right get you out of
[1:28:30] a situation or bring you a cold cup of
[1:28:32] water whatever something that that a
[1:28:34] person has done to help those are the
[1:28:37] works that they'll be judged by
[1:28:39] amen now people give all kinds of money
[1:28:42] and time and things to Charities and all
[1:28:44] and they do good deeds but that doesn't
[1:28:47] put them in the category of doing it
[1:28:49] unto Christ
[1:28:51] when you've done it unto his little ones
[1:28:54] you've done it to him
[1:28:56] not because you gave a tax deduction to
[1:28:59] uh some charitable organization right
[1:29:03] but when you've done it unto these at
[1:29:05] least at my little ones you've done it
[1:29:07] to me amen look at this
[1:29:10] we read this last week he's talking he
[1:29:13] brother Ram talked about the virgins
[1:29:15] he says the foolish virgins uh they were
[1:29:20] not permitted to go to the wedding
[1:29:21] supper but they suffered persecution and
[1:29:24] was martyred and raised again at the
[1:29:27] general Resurrection remember after the
[1:29:29] after the Thousand Years
[1:29:31] the general Resurrection in the last day
[1:29:33] those are the people
[1:29:35] he separated look now those are the
[1:29:39] people where he separated like the sheep
[1:29:42] from the goats
[1:29:43] amen this is questions and answers being
[1:29:46] missed being being misunderstood
[1:29:49] they suffer persecution
[1:29:52] and was and was martyred and raised
[1:29:56] again at the general Resurrection in the
[1:29:58] last days those are the people where he
[1:30:00] separated the sheep from the goats
[1:30:02] amen uh makes it pretty
[1:30:07] and what did he do for us he put our
[1:30:09] sins on Christ because we received him
[1:30:11] in the first seal
[1:30:14] um I think I read this one too last week
[1:30:16] now notice the rest of the Dead church
[1:30:19] members dead church members live not
[1:30:21] again until the thousand years and then
[1:30:22] at the thousand years they were gathered
[1:30:24] another Resurrection come that was the
[1:30:27] General Resurrection which is the second
[1:30:29] resurrection and they were gathered and
[1:30:31] Christ and the bride not the church the
[1:30:35] bride Christ and his Queen Christ and
[1:30:39] the bride stood there
[1:30:41] seated
[1:30:43] stood semantics and they were separated
[1:30:46] like the sheep from the goats that's
[1:30:49] right there's the church members come up
[1:30:52] or foolish virgin if you will amen now
[1:30:55] there's all kind of talk of people say
[1:30:57] the foolish virgins come from this group
[1:30:59] The foolish virgins come from this group
[1:31:00] I'm of the opinion foolish virgin can
[1:31:03] come from any group
[1:31:05] and and I've heard arguments that a
[1:31:07] foolish virgin couldn't come out of the
[1:31:09] message people that are around the
[1:31:10] message I heard people against it I've
[1:31:13] heard people for it amen I I can see
[1:31:16] both sides and people hold their hard
[1:31:18] lines that's up to them I'm not I'm just
[1:31:21] saying that they could come and I've had
[1:31:23] people hold hard lines that they could
[1:31:25] come out of denomination or not come out
[1:31:26] of the nomination you think Al could a
[1:31:28] foolish virgin come out of denomination
[1:31:30] well now how are these people able to
[1:31:32] con reconcile this when this one's
[1:31:34] saying well they can't come out of the
[1:31:36] nomination they're saying they can't
[1:31:37] come out of the message people then
[1:31:38] where are they coming from
[1:31:41] how do you draw you draw such a hard and
[1:31:44] fast friend you cut everybody out and
[1:31:46] you know what I'd rather not do that
[1:31:49] God's gonna do that I I'd rather draw a
[1:31:53] circle and draw everybody as much as I
[1:31:54] can back in if I can I'd rather draw a
[1:31:58] circle not a line
[1:31:59] and if I can that's what I like to do I
[1:32:02] understand why they say this site and I
[1:32:04] understand why they say that sign again
[1:32:05] I'm not here to argue that point and
[1:32:08] they may be right I'm not saying I'm
[1:32:10] right I just would rather
[1:32:12] give Mercy
[1:32:14] than excluded and I would rather give
[1:32:18] someone an opportunity than no hope at
[1:32:21] all right
[1:32:22] and that's just my stance that's just
[1:32:24] how I feel about it and and that's just
[1:32:27] that's just the way I believe it but
[1:32:29] they will come up now brother Brown
[1:32:32] calls them church members will come up
[1:32:34] to be separated as she from goats
[1:32:37] foolish virgin the rest of humanity the
[1:32:40] foolish version will be in my opinion
[1:32:42] the ones that of course go off onto the
[1:32:44] right hand side
[1:32:46] uh and notice
[1:32:48] I'm not saying that it is but notice in
[1:32:50] the scripture
[1:32:51] when he talks about the wise and the
[1:32:53] foolish he says there's five wives and
[1:32:56] five bullies she gives us the exact same
[1:32:58] number
[1:32:59] there's not one more wise than there is
[1:33:01] foolish
[1:33:02] now does that account to the numbers as
[1:33:07] far as being bride and being foolish
[1:33:09] virgin are the exact same amount I'm not
[1:33:11] saying that but I do think there's some
[1:33:13] relevance to that other than just a
[1:33:16] parable
[1:33:17] that he had five on one side and five on
[1:33:19] the other but but I'll read a scripture
[1:33:23] here in just a minute so let me get
[1:33:24] through this real quick uh separate the
[1:33:27] chief and goes there's where the church
[1:33:29] members come up and they heard the truth
[1:33:31] rejected the truth then what's going to
[1:33:34] be said when that big thing spreads
[1:33:36] across the canvas brother Brandon talks
[1:33:38] about that again and the sky we did uh
[1:33:40] we did go into that part last week and
[1:33:42] show that you had the opportunity
[1:33:45] amen everybody will have the opportunity
[1:33:48] that's that's a righteous judge a
[1:33:51] righteous judge gives every opportunity
[1:33:54] Amen to receive it
[1:33:57] an opportunity
[1:33:58] how would you judge someone
[1:34:01] against someone who did not have the
[1:34:04] opportunity to receive it
[1:34:08] well that's not very just
[1:34:10] it it it's like saying
[1:34:13] coming into the church to say okay I'm
[1:34:15] gonna I'm gonna take this ten thousand
[1:34:17] dollars now
[1:34:18] you had your chance
[1:34:20] what do you mean I have a chance I
[1:34:22] didn't even know it was here
[1:34:26] how could that be a chance when you
[1:34:28] didn't even know
[1:34:31] everybody will know they have to know to
[1:34:34] be a righteous judge
[1:34:36] to be able to judge in that capacity now
[1:34:38] let's talk about uh uh
[1:34:42] the juice for a few moments let's go
[1:34:43] over to Revelation chapter six
[1:34:53] I'm not
[1:34:57] probably not going to be able to give
[1:34:59] this the time that I want to
[1:35:03] but we'll go to Revelation chapter six
[1:35:06] we know that's the seal chapter verse
[1:35:09] first first six seals we're in
[1:35:11] Revelation 6.
[1:35:13] but I want to pay particularly close
[1:35:15] attention to the fifth seal
[1:35:18] the fist still starts with the ninth
[1:35:19] verse so Revelation 6 9 and when he had
[1:35:22] opened the fifth seal
[1:35:24] I saw under the altar now alter is a
[1:35:27] place of sacrifice where's the sacrifice
[1:35:29] our sacrifice was Christ amen that was
[1:35:32] the sacrifice that was rejected by the
[1:35:35] Jews they said let his blood be on us
[1:35:37] and our children but look at this now I
[1:35:40] saw her in the altar The Souls of them
[1:35:43] that were slain for the word of God and
[1:35:46] for the testimony which they held now a
[1:35:48] lot of people think this was Christians
[1:35:50] this was bride or Christians at least
[1:35:52] that were under the Altar and a lot of
[1:35:55] people until and even brother Adam said
[1:35:57] I thought that until the Lord revealed
[1:36:00] it to me and showed me this is not
[1:36:02] Gentile this is not the bride these are
[1:36:04] Jews
[1:36:05] amen and he said
[1:36:09] and let's just redo it you'll you can
[1:36:11] see first of all
[1:36:13] they were slain for the word of God and
[1:36:15] the testimony they held they weren't
[1:36:17] slain for Christ they weren't slain for
[1:36:19] the testimony of Jesus
[1:36:21] they were slain for the testimony for
[1:36:23] the word of God and the testimony would
[1:36:25] say held the Christian is slain for
[1:36:28] their testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:36:31] when you talk about the bride that comes
[1:36:34] up into the Dark Ages they didn't just
[1:36:36] give their lives in martinement uh
[1:36:38] because of the word
[1:36:40] they held to the testimony of Jesus
[1:36:43] Christ and the Holy Spirit
[1:36:46] okay that's one and they cried with a
[1:36:49] loud voice saying how long O Lord holy
[1:36:52] and true thus thou not judge and avenge
[1:36:55] our blood on them that dwell on the
[1:36:57] Earth
[1:36:58] and white rose were given
[1:37:02] unto them every one white robes weren't
[1:37:05] given
[1:37:07] amen now
[1:37:09] we'll we'll we'll read another scripture
[1:37:11] in a minute to to help you understand
[1:37:14] how you differentiate between the two
[1:37:17] this group was given white robes okay
[1:37:21] and we'll get it done in a minute and it
[1:37:23] was said unto them that they should rest
[1:37:26] for a little season until their fellow
[1:37:28] servants now the bride's not Gentiles
[1:37:30] aren't servants amen there's people this
[1:37:34] is the servants are the Jews
[1:37:37] and which again
[1:37:39] helps us understand that these are the
[1:37:42] also these salt these fifth seal souls
[1:37:44] and algebra Jews
[1:37:46] their fellow servants which
[1:37:53] I have to put in here to understand
[1:37:56] when you talk about the church ages this
[1:37:58] was all for gentiles
[1:38:00] the church ages from from the dead
[1:38:02] Pentecost until today but for those who
[1:38:04] would receive Christ the word be born
[1:38:07] again from the day of Pentecost to today
[1:38:12] now God has to account for because he
[1:38:16] doesn't forgive remember God said how
[1:38:19] could I ever forget my people and he
[1:38:22] doesn't and he can he puts them here in
[1:38:25] this fifth seal amen as a part of the
[1:38:27] seals fellow servants also and their
[1:38:31] Brethren that should be killed as were
[1:38:33] as they were should be fulfilled which
[1:38:36] does happen
[1:38:38] and I beheld when he had opened the
[1:38:40] Sixth Seal well we finished this
[1:38:42] official that they should be killed the
[1:38:44] fellow servants would be killed as they
[1:38:46] were as the Jews now look as as their
[1:38:50] Brethren were let me read this to you in
[1:38:54] the fifth seal
[1:38:55] when after the Lord reveals this to
[1:38:58] brother Brown
[1:39:00] I notice I I don't usually spend a lot
[1:39:02] of time
[1:39:03] on the Gen on the on the Jew part of
[1:39:06] because it doesn't necessarily affect us
[1:39:09] or or or or pertain to us but to to
[1:39:14] bring scripture into continuity uh I
[1:39:18] think it helps that we look at it and
[1:39:19] discuss it and talk about it because uh
[1:39:24] the Jew is is uh was God's people so his
[1:39:30] servants
[1:39:31] but in the fifth seal now he says now
[1:39:34] we find out revelation 22 8 same thing
[1:39:37] now or to settle it look now he says
[1:39:40] this now to settle it for those
[1:39:43] whose Souls those Souls that were under
[1:39:46] the altar of the breaking of this seal
[1:39:49] that had been slain in the time between
[1:39:53] the death of Christ and the going up of
[1:39:57] the church
[1:39:58] so from the time basically from the day
[1:40:01] of Pentecost
[1:40:02] until the going up of the Bride
[1:40:05] this is those Souls under the altar in
[1:40:08] that period of time that were slain for
[1:40:11] this reason
[1:40:12] for the word of God and the testimony
[1:40:14] they help our brother Brandon brings
[1:40:16] into light A specific group which we
[1:40:19] know
[1:40:20] which we know very well is what we call
[1:40:22] the Holocaust
[1:40:24] he said the Eichmann group and all that
[1:40:28] them true Jews with their names on the
[1:40:30] book if you watch my brother according
[1:40:33] to the scripture they could talk Christ
[1:40:35] speak here and had all five senses not
[1:40:38] sleeping in a grave unconscious they
[1:40:40] were very much awake and could talk
[1:40:42] speak anything else but he he he
[1:40:45] accounts this group
[1:40:48] two a part of it as the Eichmann Group
[1:40:51] which is the Holocaust and the Jews that
[1:40:54] were slaughtered the millions of Jews
[1:40:56] that were slaughtered as a result of
[1:40:58] this who he said were true Jews
[1:41:02] amen true Jews and had their name on the
[1:41:06] book
[1:41:07] that's what brother Adam called in the
[1:41:09] fifth seal to understand that this fifth
[1:41:12] seal is the Jewish people yes amen that
[1:41:16] that died at that time and they're
[1:41:19] sitting there waiting for their Brethren
[1:41:22] fellow servants to come around to be
[1:41:25] able to see what they now know which
[1:41:28] were given white roads given to them
[1:41:31] that they will come around and the and
[1:41:34] the scripture says you just have to wait
[1:41:36] just a little while sit here under this
[1:41:38] Altar and they will come to that place
[1:41:41] and they will
[1:41:43] the Jews will finally after the bride's
[1:41:45] gone the Jews the spirit of God moves
[1:41:48] back to the Jews we've talked about this
[1:41:49] before then they will recognize the Jews
[1:41:52] there will recognize Jesus Christ as the
[1:41:55] Messiah amen and then they will have to
[1:41:58] be uh
[1:41:59] through the tribulation they will be
[1:42:01] martyred as well now let's look in
[1:42:03] Revelation 7 real quick
[1:42:06] Revelation 7 there's so much more I'd
[1:42:08] like to say but
[1:42:10] um let's go to verse 9.
[1:42:12] and maybe we'll fill this in next week
[1:42:14] we'll see and after this uh Revelation 7
[1:42:17] 9 after this now above that it talks
[1:42:20] about the 144 000 coming together uh the
[1:42:24] 12 12 000 of each of the tribes of
[1:42:26] Israel after this I be held in lobe a
[1:42:30] great multitude which no man could
[1:42:31] number of all Nations Kindred and people
[1:42:34] and tongues stood Before the Throne and
[1:42:37] before the lamb clothed with white roads
[1:42:39] and Palms in their hands now look a lot
[1:42:41] of people think this is the bride
[1:42:43] and it is not
[1:42:45] this is the group that comes forth from
[1:42:48] the white Throne judgment and we're and
[1:42:51] we're granted life
[1:42:53] they were
[1:42:54] accounted as righteous at that point
[1:42:59] and they and they had and they were
[1:43:02] wearing at this time white rose
[1:43:06] he meant they were wearing white robes
[1:43:07] so
[1:43:09] but let's just continue to read because
[1:43:11] they're they're not the Jews that were
[1:43:13] given white robes
[1:43:15] they had on white robes but they were a
[1:43:18] number that's after the Jews of a great
[1:43:21] multitude which no man can number out of
[1:43:23] all Nations Kindred people tongues stood
[1:43:26] Before the Throne which again tells you
[1:43:29] it's not the bride right because they
[1:43:31] were in the throne those who overcome
[1:43:34] will I grant to inherit to sit with me
[1:43:36] in my throne
[1:43:38] and cry to the loud boys saying
[1:43:40] salvation to our god which sitteth upon
[1:43:43] the throne and unto the lamp and all the
[1:43:45] Angels stood round about the throne and
[1:43:47] about the elders and the four beasts and
[1:43:49] fell Before the Throne on their faces
[1:43:51] and worshiped God saying amen blessing
[1:43:54] and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving
[1:43:56] and honor and power and might be unto
[1:43:59] our God forever and ever amen one of the
[1:44:02] elders answers saying unto me what are
[1:44:04] these which are waiting a raid in white
[1:44:06] robes and whence came they and I said
[1:44:09] unto them sir thou knowest and he said
[1:44:11] to me these are they which came out of
[1:44:14] Great Tribulation now we know that can't
[1:44:18] be brought because we know the bride
[1:44:21] does not go through the tribulation amen
[1:44:23] these came out of the tribulation right
[1:44:27] they went through the white Throne
[1:44:29] judgment they were accounted as
[1:44:31] righteous and given robes right
[1:44:35] they came out of tribulation and have
[1:44:38] washed their robes and made them white
[1:44:41] in the blood of the Lamb which the blood
[1:44:44] of Christ is the only thing that can
[1:44:46] make something White
[1:44:47] and pure
[1:44:49] theirs was washed now in the blood of
[1:44:52] the Lamb see the bride does not need her
[1:44:55] garment wash she is wearing His Garment
[1:44:58] she is rubbed in his righteousness she
[1:45:01] doesn't need to wash her wash her robe
[1:45:04] she's got on his robe his robe of
[1:45:08] righteousness these came out of
[1:45:10] tribulation and had their robes washed
[1:45:13] praise the Lord therefore they are
[1:45:16] Before the Throne of God and serve him
[1:45:19] day and night in his Temple and he that
[1:45:21] setteth on the throne uh shall dwell
[1:45:24] among them they shall hunger no more
[1:45:26] because he's going to feed them and
[1:45:28] recognize theirs was washed
[1:45:31] the Jews had the robes because it was
[1:45:35] given to them
[1:45:37] why because they had been martyred
[1:45:41] their fellow servants had yet to
[1:45:44] recognize Christ as their Messiah to
[1:45:48] have those robes
[1:45:50] but they were given to them because of
[1:45:53] the truth that they stood for
[1:45:55] the testimony of God for being as
[1:45:58] brother Branham called them true Jews
[1:46:01] and were standing for that word
[1:46:03] they stood there they were given ropes
[1:46:06] but the Gentile foolish virgin had to
[1:46:09] have their robes washed in the blood
[1:46:12] through the tribulation they come out of
[1:46:15] tribulation and had because then that's
[1:46:18] when they received after God had had
[1:46:21] accounted them on the right hand as
[1:46:23] righteous amen amen oh praise the Lord
[1:46:27] I I want you to understand though now
[1:46:30] again
[1:46:31] as I close here
[1:46:33] they are not
[1:46:35] inheritors of anything but life
[1:46:40] they're not inheritors of anything that
[1:46:42] the bride has
[1:46:44] or will be in the new city I'll read
[1:46:46] that to you next week Lord willing amen
[1:46:49] let's stand though we could now
[1:46:58] foreign
[1:47:00] amen
[1:47:03] seventh the seventh chapter
[1:47:05] which I probably did not do a very good
[1:47:07] job of
[1:47:09] the seventh chapter is
[1:47:12] the six chapters of seals
[1:47:15] the seventh chapter is the 144 000 in
[1:47:18] the foolish virgin it goes into the
[1:47:20] eighth chapter in the eighth chapter
[1:47:21] first verse is the seventh seal and then
[1:47:24] when there's silence in heaven and um us
[1:47:27] Brothers we were talking about the the
[1:47:30] the the thousand days is one year one
[1:47:34] year's one year is a thousand days again
[1:47:37] brings about the understanding in the
[1:47:39] scripture and verbiage one day is as a
[1:47:43] thousand years uh basically what it's
[1:47:45] saying is there's eternity but I know
[1:47:48] people that would take that half hour of
[1:47:51] silence and they would try to do the
[1:47:53] math to figure out the difference in a
[1:47:56] day and a thousand years a thousand
[1:47:58] years in the day of what is 30 minutes
[1:48:00] and I'm thinking man if you've got to
[1:48:02] know that to be in God's right I am
[1:48:04] finished
[1:48:06] you can count me out
[1:48:08] I can't do that math
[1:48:11] some of these guys you might be all
[1:48:13] smart and Tommy's I don't know I can't
[1:48:15] do that kind of math and I'm not going
[1:48:17] to try to because I don't think that's
[1:48:18] what you have to do
[1:48:20] amen that's not a part of it but boy
[1:48:22] they stake their life on it they hold to
[1:48:25] that hard and fast when you look at the
[1:48:27] scripture and it just says that one day
[1:48:30] is as a thousand years it doesn't even
[1:48:33] say that one day's a thousand years but
[1:48:36] it's amazing people I I don't know
[1:48:40] why people aren't satisfied with just
[1:48:43] the Simplicity the pure gospel you've
[1:48:46] got to figure everything out just hold
[1:48:48] to the gospel and God's gonna bring it
[1:48:50] to pass what he desires to amen amen
[1:48:53] it's going to be what he wants it to be
[1:48:55] when he wants to be how he wants it to
[1:48:57] be it I just plan on being a part of it
[1:48:59] amen amen that's my desire praise the
[1:49:03] Lord amen let's sing this course before
