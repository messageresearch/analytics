[16:06] they're getting invaded with a bunch of
[16:08] ants and they're having a hard time
[16:09] getting rid of them uh i know they're
[16:12] those probably those little bitty ants
[16:14] that come out in monsoon season they're
[16:16] subterranean and they get flooded out
[16:17] and they try to find higher ground
[16:20] uh that's probably what they are i
[16:22] remember we had them
[16:23] somewhere we lived not recently but um
[16:27] the exterminator just said there's
[16:28] really nothing they could do just
[16:30] keep things sprayed
[16:31] the exterminator even said just get the
[16:33] best bug sprayer and spray and keep
[16:36] areas sprayed and try to keep them away
[16:38] it's about the best you can do till
[16:39] monsoon season's over but
[16:41] uh they're harvesting a hard time
[16:43] battling that she also said that art had
[16:44] been working 18-hour shifts
[16:47] uh this week and
[16:49] i really needed prayer the lord would
[16:51] just touch him and help him and
[16:52] strengthen him i didn't even know it was
[16:54] legal to work an 18 hour a day shift
[16:57] but
[16:59] anyway that's what she has here so he's

[26:31] and i want to have the course on the
[26:33] screen here psalm number 38 higher
[26:34] ground
[26:37] amen i found out
[26:39] got a new revelation this week
[26:41] ended up you know working in
[26:44] one of those car wash tunnels and
[26:46] uh our crew is a great crew
[26:50] but some of the other people there
[26:51] didn't have their jobs done so they were
[26:53] in there and there's people they put up
[26:54] this wall board around and
[26:57] for hours on end unfortunately we made
[26:59] enough racket i didn't hear it all the
[27:00] time but there was the whole time was
[27:02] hip hop rap all that
[27:05] i thought no wonder people are going
[27:06] insane and killing each other
[27:08] i'm ready to kill somebody
[27:11] i gotta listen another one of these
[27:12] songs i'm gonna go crazy myself
[27:15] i still wonder it's just a bunch of
[27:17] repetitive chanting of nothing but
[27:19] demonic evil stuff
[27:21] it's incredible how people can listen to
[27:23] that
[27:24] there's no music there's no musician to
[27:27] it the people couldn't play an
[27:29] instrument if their life depended on it
[27:30] they can't sing a lick they just chant
[27:33] over and over just the most vile
[27:35] disgusting things you could imagine
[27:37] i thought mine give me a drill
[27:42] but make just somebody make some noise
[27:45] but i figured it out that's why
[27:48] they're going insane they're they're
[27:49] just going crazy it's
[27:51] a big reason why
[27:53] amen but
[27:55] the lord blesses he always does amen so
[27:58] i'm thankful for that i'm looking for
[28:00] higher ground how about you amen praise

[42:26] we rebuke that devil and we bind our
[42:28] faith together in the name of jesus
[42:30] christ that you would take this from him
[42:33] lord
[42:33] satan you take your hands off of this
[42:36] young man i will mature you in jesus
[42:39] christ's name you have no right to him
[42:42] and i tell you in the name of jesus
[42:44] christ you must go
[42:46] lord touch him now father we believe in
[42:49] your precious name he is healed by your
[42:51] stripes
[42:52] in calvary we claim it as we bind our
[42:55] faith together for it in jesus christ's
[42:57] name
[42:58] amen
[43:00] amen
[43:04] been happening on and off with him in
[43:05] the past couple of weeks
[43:08] even last sunday we left here we went to
[43:10] go get something and he didn't it wasn't
[43:12] anything he drank or ate it just he sat
[43:14] down and was getting ready to get the
[43:16] food and then he his stomach started
[43:18] hurting and it was hurting while i had
[43:20] to go to the airport he just keeps
[43:22] having that trouble and then it just
[43:23] goes away
[43:25] after a little bit of 20 30 minutes or
[43:28] something goes away
[43:30] but i'm so proud of him because every
[43:31] time
[43:33] it happens like that he says pray for me
[43:37] how many children how many
[43:38] eight-year-olds in the world today when
[43:40] they're not feeling good go to you and
[43:42] say pray for me
[43:45] been taught that
[43:46] amen
[43:49] praise the lord so
[43:51] believing in faith satan has no right to
[43:54] him
[43:55] amen
[43:56] praise the lord let's stand to our feet
[43:57] if we could
[44:00] god shall bless you today the lord
[44:02] willing we'll
[44:03] try to continue on with last week's
[44:05] message
[44:08] amen
[44:10] and go back to the second timothy
[44:12] chapter two
[44:15] second timothy chapter two we'll pick up
[44:18] with this probably won't be as lengthy
[44:20] as last week
[44:24] because like i said these must knots
[44:27] that we were talking about that brother
[44:28] branham referenced to for us in crisis
[44:31] revealed in his word
[44:32] these three must nots the first one
[44:35] really to me was the more
[44:36] uh they're all three very important but
[44:39] the first one is very
[44:41] very much uh
[44:43] uh prominent today and and what and
[44:46] what's going on in the world and the
[44:48] first one that we talked about last week
[44:50] um
[44:51] was the misinterpretation of god's work
[44:54] misinterpreting him so we talked about
[44:56] that last week
[44:58] we'll get to the other two here today as
[45:00] they kind of run together they all
[45:01] really three run together but these last
[45:04] two more so
[45:05] so second timothy chapter two we'll read
[45:08] a few verses of scripture here but let's
[45:09] bow our heads for word of prayer before
[45:11] we do that lord jesus we're thankful
[45:14] father again to be in the house of god
[45:16] we're thankful for the health strength
[45:18] and life you give us thank you for the
[45:20] blessings lord that you bestow upon us
[45:22] every day lord yes in our lives god of
[45:24] the blessings you give us and never
[45:26] leaving or forsaking us god and just a
[45:28] peace that we can have to know that in
[45:30] the middle of a tumultuous world god
[45:32] you've given us a type host you've given
[45:35] us a standard you've given us an anchor
[45:37] you've given us something that helps
[45:39] keep us
[45:40] from getting ourselves all
[45:43] out of shape and worried and discouraged
[45:45] and down and depressed because we know
[45:48] our redeemer liveth yes and we know that
[45:51] on that last day that we will stand with
[45:53] you together and we will stand
[45:55] victorious in the precious name and
[45:58] under the shed blood of jesus christ
[46:01] we thank you lord for your willingness
[46:02] to go to calvary for doing it for us for
[46:05] becoming us
[46:06] that we can become you that by that lord
[46:09] we could draw nearer to you we could
[46:11] come close to you we could be more like
[46:13] you in this world that we live thank you
[46:15] for this time this service this place
[46:17] for these people that have come those
[46:19] who may be streaming we thank you so
[46:21] much for all that you do for us every
[46:23] day now we pray once again that you take
[46:26] complete control over this service we
[46:28] rebuke every demonic spirit in the name
[46:30] of jesus christ that we try to hurt
[46:32] hinder or infiltrate this service in any
[46:34] way that you get the glory and praise
[46:36] for all that is said and done
[46:38] thank you for your word lord now speak
[46:40] to us from it anoint hearing speaker
[46:42] alike that
[46:43] that would accomplish whatever your
[46:45] desire lord is for this service to be
[46:48] accomplished and we committed to you we
[46:50] thank you for it in the name of the lord
[46:52] jesus christ we pray
[46:54] amen amen
[46:56] second timothy chapter 2 we'll begin
[46:59] reading with verse 11
[47:02] 11 through well we'll see what we go
[47:04] through
[47:05] verse 11
[47:06] it is a faithful saying
[47:09] for if we be dead with him we shall also
[47:11] live with him
[47:13] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[47:15] him if we deny him he also will deny us
[47:19] if we believe not yet he abideth
[47:22] faithful he cannot deny himself of these
[47:25] things put them in remembrance
[47:28] charging them before the lord that they
[47:30] strive not about
[47:31] words to no prophet but the subverting
[47:35] of the here put to the subverting of the
[47:37] hearer
[47:38] study to show thyself approved unto god
[47:41] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[47:43] rightly dividing the word of truth amen
[47:47] you can be seated if you'd like
[47:50] amen
[47:51] rightly dividing the word of truth
[47:55] which is what uh we want to
[47:57] think about as we go back into this
[48:00] three must nots that brother random gave
[48:03] us and christ revealed in his own word
[48:05] you remember those three must not uh
[48:08] i'll read it again here because there's
[48:09] some maybe here that went here last week
[48:12] but i'll read this again it is from
[48:14] christ revealed in his own word of those
[48:16] three must-nots that he talked about now
[48:18] he mentioned about
[48:20] so many times you must do this you must
[48:22] do this the scripture says you must be
[48:24] born again the scripture says
[48:26] but there are those that he talked about
[48:28] here now like i said there probably are
[48:32] other things that we should not do
[48:35] or must not of the scripture but these
[48:38] are the three that he pointed out
[48:40] specifically and i believe the point of
[48:42] that was that of these three
[48:46] any of those three will cause the word
[48:48] itself to lose its picture it will lose
[48:52] its effectiveness it will lose its uh uh
[48:56] ability as god would to reveal it to us
[48:59] it loses all that if it gets out of
[49:02] focus
[49:04] the word starts getting
[49:06] muddled up and jumbled and and then all
[49:08] of a sudden if you if you misplace this
[49:11] or you misinterpret that or dislocate
[49:13] this
[49:15] the picture starts to get wrong
[49:17] it starts to
[49:19] get like i said
[49:21] last week the cow and the tree picking
[49:23] grass and
[49:24] so
[49:25] these are the three important things as
[49:28] as you said in studying the scripture
[49:31] and that's what that's what paul told
[49:33] timothy in studying the scripture these
[49:36] three mustangs there's obviously a lot
[49:38] of must-nots that we should do but in
[49:41] the scripture and studying the scripture
[49:43] those are things that will cause the
[49:44] scripture to lose its effectiveness to
[49:47] get
[49:48] jumbled up as i said we'll start
[49:52] if we see part of the scripture a
[49:54] certain way
[49:56] that's not according that is
[49:58] misinterpreted or mislocated or
[50:00] something it'll make other parts of the
[50:03] scripture not fit or look right or work
[50:05] right that's why so many people think uh
[50:08] that the bible contradicts itself no no
[50:11] the bible does not contradict itself
[50:14] if there's any contradiction it's how
[50:16] you've misinterpreted or mislocated or
[50:19] dislocated or misplaced it or something
[50:22] that's the only reason it won't work in
[50:24] perfect continuity and dovetail one word
[50:26] to the other genesis to revelation is
[50:29] that one of those three things has
[50:30] happened a misinterpretation has come a
[50:33] misplacement somehow or dislocation some
[50:36] has caused the word and your
[50:38] interpretation of it to be skewed to
[50:40] where it doesn't look like this fits
[50:43] with this but it all fits together and
[50:45] it has to and it will if you put it all
[50:48] exactly the way it's supposed to be as
[50:49] god wrote it amen so again
[50:53] understanding the importance of this
[50:55] three must nots is very vital
[50:58] the first one we talked of last week was
[51:00] not misinterpreting the word uh and
[51:03] understanding how important it is and in
[51:05] today's world and how many things even
[51:08] sister mati sent me a text about
[51:11] all these
[51:12] and i hadn't even thought about it but
[51:13] all these new variations of the bible i
[51:15] don't know how many translations of the
[51:17] bible there are today
[51:20] but you want to talk about
[51:21] misinterpretation uh when i get
[51:24] i think i may have said this to you
[51:26] years ago but when i look at a new bible
[51:29] which you can tell i haven't gotten a
[51:31] new bible but uh if i look at a new
[51:34] bible i had somebody one time that i
[51:36] took from the airport
[51:38] who gave me a bible
[51:39] and it was some translation i can't
[51:41] remember what i kept it but
[51:43] i looked at it but when i see a
[51:44] translation of the bible the first place
[51:46] i go
[51:47] is genesis
[51:49] and when you go through the first three
[51:51] four chapters of genesis and it doesn't
[51:54] match up with what we know to be the
[51:55] truth by art by
[51:57] what brother branham stood on the king
[51:59] james version of what he ministered
[52:01] which most all or most if not all are
[52:04] wrong
[52:05] uh you get an understanding right there
[52:07] i that that bible's gone that's right i
[52:10] don't use it i don't read it i don't
[52:13] it it's not going to be as any profit to
[52:15] me because it has already misinterpreted
[52:18] what the true scripture is into
[52:20] something that came out of some theology
[52:22] or some seminary somewhere
[52:25] or some doctrine or dr divinity who
[52:27] believes there's three gods
[52:30] i mean then so to me if those first
[52:33] three chapters are wrong
[52:35] i've put it away
[52:37] so that's kind of how i look at it but i
[52:39] thought that was very good i didn't even
[52:40] think of that about how people
[52:42] misinterpreted those things they take
[52:44] from the scripture and try to divulge
[52:46] and put into their their own opinions
[52:48] into there remember how we talked about
[52:50] the developing of our opinions and
[52:52] trying to interject our opinions into
[52:54] the scripture can no be no opinion it
[52:58] has to be you have to die out to
[52:59] yourself and accept and believe the word
[53:02] and its purity and its holiness and and
[53:04] the way god wrote it in the in the in
[53:07] the spirit of the holy spirit is exactly
[53:09] the way that we read it
[53:11] and god will reveal it to you that way
[53:13] and when god reveals it to you that way
[53:15] then every bit of it runs together in
[53:17] continuity yes amen now there's also
[53:21] the perspective of let's just take the
[53:23] four gospels there's also the
[53:25] perspective in the scripture of the four
[53:28] gospels being a good example of
[53:31] different men
[53:34] seeing the same event
[53:36] and writing it a different way
[53:38] and people would say oh well this one
[53:40] contradicts this one no no it doesn't
[53:42] um
[53:44] if if i were to write about this service
[53:46] today i would write about what i see
[53:49] right here in front of me about
[53:52] the ones on the left the ones on the
[53:53] right and how many is over here and how
[53:55] many is over there and my perspective
[53:58] and who's wearing glasses and uh and all
[54:00] the different that that's what i would
[54:02] write about now if somebody was standing
[54:04] over in that corner and looking at it
[54:06] this way they would write it a different
[54:07] way
[54:09] amen
[54:10] because they're looking at it at a
[54:11] different angle it's the exact same
[54:13] thing
[54:14] it's the exact same scenario and i
[54:16] believe god had though that's why those
[54:19] uh those cherubims are there to guard
[54:22] those gospels see that god allowed these
[54:25] different men
[54:26] to write these things from different
[54:28] backgrounds and from different
[54:30] perspectives and from different point of
[54:32] views to see the exact same thing
[54:35] it might look like it's different but
[54:37] it's not
[54:38] if you bring and take the entire picture
[54:41] and put it together
[54:42] see
[54:43] jesus would say one thing or one
[54:46] specific thing would happen well matthew
[54:48] might have thought that was important
[54:50] but luke didn't
[54:51] right luke may not have wrote what
[54:53] matthew wrote because matthew saw from a
[54:55] different perspective and that's why god
[54:58] had those four to write it the way they
[55:00] did so that we would get the entire
[55:01] picture
[55:02] amen so you see it's not a contradiction
[55:06] it's not a misinterpretation
[55:09] it's men filled with the holy ghost
[55:11] moved by the holy ghost i should say
[55:12] that's what the scripture says move by
[55:14] the holy ghost to write it
[55:16] and they wrote it that way now it was
[55:19] guarded so that not just anybody's not
[55:21] going to see it it has to be revealed by
[55:24] god it has to be written in the red in
[55:27] the spirit that it was written and it
[55:29] was written by the holy ghost it's got
[55:31] to be read with by men women
[55:33] feel with the holy ghost yes or it will
[55:36] not work right it will not dovetail it
[55:38] will not
[55:39] uh uh
[55:41] show itself perfect the way it is now
[55:43] christ revealed his own word now in
[55:45] order to study the scripture just laid
[55:48] that foundation
[55:49] paul told timothy study it
[55:52] rightly dividing the word not
[55:54] interpreting it amen not interpreting
[55:56] but rightly dividing it right
[55:59] the word of god which is truth there is
[56:02] three musts in studying the scripture
[56:06] and using god's word there is three
[56:08] things you must not do now let's study
[56:11] next ten minutes he said these things
[56:13] you must not do all out in the land
[56:15] wherever you are you must not do these
[56:17] things we tell you all the time what you
[56:19] must do now i'm going to tell you what
[56:21] you must not do now it's not again
[56:24] it's not with your life it's in studying
[56:27] the scripture right that's what brother
[56:29] branham made specifically sure to help
[56:31] help us understand in studying the
[56:34] scripture there's three must nots okay
[56:37] i'm going to tell you what you must not
[56:39] and do now must not do now you must not
[56:42] misinterpret the word that's number one
[56:45] the first thing
[56:47] you say well i believe it means this
[56:49] it means exactly what it says it needs
[56:53] no interpreter
[56:54] and you must not misplace
[56:57] the word and you must not dislocate the
[57:00] word those are the three must not must
[57:03] not interpret must not misplace must not
[57:06] dislocate the word and if we do either
[57:08] of these it throws the entire bible into
[57:11] a confusion and chaos
[57:14] see because then it doesn't dovetail
[57:16] right because men's ideas are
[57:18] interjected into it now let's go to
[57:20] dislocate for a few minutes and let me
[57:24] let me at first i just feel to do this
[57:26] let me at first
[57:28] uh take an overall
[57:30] picture of this
[57:32] from what i see because like i said last
[57:34] week it can sound like that miss
[57:38] misplace and dislocate sound a lot the
[57:41] same
[57:42] misplace and dislocate but if you go to
[57:45] study and how brother brown said it and
[57:48] how the scripture uh presents itself you
[57:52] can see that the two are very close
[57:54] together but they are different
[57:56] and as i was sitting
[57:59] a couple of weeks ago
[58:01] at my desk
[58:02] and asking the lord to give me something
[58:05] uh help me let me let me see this i
[58:09] i
[58:10] i like to be able to see it
[58:12] uh
[58:13] before i say it before i bring it before
[58:16] i stand up here i want to be able to see
[58:18] it i'll i want it to be
[58:20] dumped down so much for me
[58:23] that even my little p brain can see it
[58:27] and
[58:27] and the lord kind of showed it to me
[58:30] like this
[58:31] it's like a puzzle
[58:33] now
[58:34] dislocate now just bear with me for a
[58:37] few moments as we're going to delve into
[58:39] each one a little bit but again i won't
[58:41] be as long as it was last week but
[58:42] dislocate
[58:44] to dislocate means you must have the
[58:47] correct
[58:48] puzzle
[58:50] okay
[58:51] you must have the correct puzzle
[58:54] you can't if you dislocate you've got
[58:57] the wrong puzzle for the wrong time
[59:01] okay so you have to first have the right
[59:03] puzzle just like a dislocate we call
[59:07] what we have today the message of the
[59:10] hour
[59:11] that's our phraseology that we use
[59:14] uh
[59:15] for what
[59:16] the for the what we follow what we
[59:18] believe
[59:19] uh william branham the prophet and that
[59:22] message it wasn't him but it was that
[59:24] message it was it was christ the word
[59:27] coming to a people
[59:28] it cannot be dislocated
[59:31] to where
[59:32] that prophet come for this day
[59:35] and come and tell millions of people to
[59:37] go build an ark
[59:40] that would be dislocating the scripture
[59:43] right because it wasn't time for us to
[59:46] go build an ark
[59:48] for a big flood
[59:50] that would be dislocating the scripture
[59:53] so you have to have the correct puzzle
[59:56] the correct puzzle for this day we
[59:59] affectionately call the message of the
[1:00:01] hour that we believe that's the message
[1:00:04] for our day that's the puzzle that we
[1:00:06] are supposed to have that we live by
[1:00:09] amen now that that puzzle also
[1:00:13] has to be per put in its
[1:00:16] exact position so to dislocate means
[1:00:19] you've got the wrong puzzle
[1:00:22] you've got uh moses
[1:00:24] uh crossing the red sea
[1:00:27] or you've got
[1:00:29] us building an art somewhere or
[1:00:32] uh
[1:00:33] uh how many others
[1:00:35] we're gonna go out after church here and
[1:00:38] take all of us take a bunch of lambs
[1:00:39] over and sacrifice them on an altar up
[1:00:42] on mount lemmon or something
[1:00:44] you can't dislocate the scripture
[1:00:47] the word has to fit for your day for
[1:00:50] your age
[1:00:53] you can't take now it's like i said last
[1:00:55] week now
[1:00:57] martin luther
[1:00:59] we
[1:01:00] we're not martin luther's age but we do
[1:01:03] preach martin luther's message
[1:01:05] we do preach justification we just
[1:01:08] understand it in a greater light right
[1:01:11] we
[1:01:12] wesley yeah we don't have wesley's age
[1:01:16] but we do preach wesley's message
[1:01:19] so you see those all come up together
[1:01:22] but we're not standing just to say
[1:01:24] uh justification is it or sanctification
[1:01:27] is it or or or the gifts of the spirit
[1:01:30] that's it pentecost that's that that's
[1:01:32] it you stop right there no
[1:01:34] the message of this hour is to take a
[1:01:37] bride into a rapture
[1:01:39] this word is to take her and make her
[1:01:42] like him
[1:01:44] so that he when he comes shall find
[1:01:47] faith that we go in that rapture with
[1:01:49] him that's the only way we could do it
[1:01:52] so you can't dislocate or it won't it's
[1:01:54] not going to work
[1:01:56] this is a rapture age luther's wasn't
[1:01:58] the rapture age right wesley's wasn't a
[1:02:01] rapture age amen restoration gifts that
[1:02:03] was fine brought the spirit back we all
[1:02:05] needed that i believe that spirit is
[1:02:06] still here we didn't leave we didn't
[1:02:08] leave pentecost behind we just brought
[1:02:11] it with us
[1:02:12] a lot of people want to say well we're
[1:02:13] not pentecost anymore i know we're not
[1:02:15] but we we take that and we bring it into
[1:02:18] this day
[1:02:19] there's nothing wrong with the gifts of
[1:02:20] the spirit you just don't see them
[1:02:22] manifested as much as you did because
[1:02:24] the spirit of god's moving off the
[1:02:26] gentile bride but we do have it we have
[1:02:28] it here prophecies tongues those things
[1:02:31] god manifests himself in those the word
[1:02:34] is what's taking precedent today so it
[1:02:36] can't be dislocated you got to have the
[1:02:39] correct puzzle
[1:02:41] for the day that we live we have to have
[1:02:43] the correct puzzle we can't take
[1:02:45] noah's puzzle
[1:02:47] amen now
[1:02:49] to misplace is to make sure that every
[1:02:52] piece of that puzzle
[1:02:54] goes exactly where it's supposed to go
[1:02:57] so if we have not dislocated the word
[1:02:59] and we've got the correct puzzle we've
[1:03:02] got the correct puzzle for our day we've
[1:03:03] got the message of the hour we've got
[1:03:05] the correct puzzle for our day now we
[1:03:07] got to make sure that every piece of
[1:03:09] that puzzle gets put where it belongs
[1:03:12] every piece has to go because that's
[1:03:14] what makes that picture for us
[1:03:16] so we can see it and when the lord
[1:03:18] showed me that i thought well that's
[1:03:20] just dumbed down enough just for someone
[1:03:22] like me to understand it
[1:03:23] you got to have the right puzzle and
[1:03:25] then every piece of that correct puzzle
[1:03:27] has to be in its correct place amen you
[1:03:30] can't dislocate and you can't misplace
[1:03:33] the word
[1:03:34] you can't preach a footage
[1:03:37] when you're in the i age right right
[1:03:40] amen we have feet of course
[1:03:43] but you can't preach a torso age in a
[1:03:45] mind age
[1:03:47] we have a torso absolutely but we've
[1:03:50] gone higher than that yes you can't just
[1:03:52] say well this is just all it is i just
[1:03:55] stop right here well then where's the
[1:03:56] intelligence
[1:03:58] if you stop with the torso if you stop
[1:04:00] with the shoulders neck where's the
[1:04:01] intelligence
[1:04:03] where's the speaking where's the scene
[1:04:04] where's the thinking
[1:04:06] you have to go and that body that god
[1:04:09] had built up from the time that that
[1:04:11] seed fell in the ground from pentecost
[1:04:14] and that seed fell on the ground and
[1:04:15] that body that god has been building the
[1:04:18] the bride of jesus christ the mystical
[1:04:20] body of jesus christ has feet toes legs
[1:04:24] torso a neck head eyes and brain
[1:04:29] every bit of it
[1:04:30] in the mind
[1:04:31] just like we've gone from
[1:04:33] riding on horseback to horse and buggy
[1:04:36] that we've gone to the little motor car
[1:04:39] or motor carriage uh we've gone up into
[1:04:43] uh
[1:04:44] vehicles into automobiles cars to where
[1:04:47] now we've gone from going five miles an
[1:04:50] hour to
[1:04:51] 155 miles an hour 205 miles an hour they
[1:04:55] race
[1:04:57] they have races out to nascar those cars
[1:05:00] if the right track they can those cars
[1:05:03] could go over 200 miles an hour round
[1:05:05] and round and round
[1:05:06] you imagine
[1:05:08] if they came back from the 1850s and saw
[1:05:10] those would you imagine if they came
[1:05:12] back from the uh i i remember my
[1:05:15] grandmother was born in 1899
[1:05:18] and the advent of the car
[1:05:20] the advent of the airplane all these
[1:05:23] things the advent of all these things
[1:05:24] happened during her lifespan
[1:05:26] good could you imagine today if somebody
[1:05:29] came that was in the 1850s and saw
[1:05:32] something going across the sky they
[1:05:33] grabbed their shotgun
[1:05:36] what is that
[1:05:38] giant things come to kill us
[1:05:41] they would they would know what to think
[1:05:43] that big silver thing flying over their
[1:05:45] heads what is that they would have no
[1:05:47] idea
[1:05:48] see that wasn't their day
[1:05:51] this is our day we look up and okay just
[1:05:54] another one boy they're awful noisy you
[1:05:56] know it's a lot of pollution a lot of
[1:05:58] noise
[1:06:00] we're so common to them and we can hop
[1:06:03] on one and
[1:06:04] be on the other side of the country in
[1:06:06] four hours
[1:06:08] where it used to take them four months
[1:06:12] that's the progression
[1:06:14] but we we still got feet we still got
[1:06:17] legs we still got torso
[1:06:19] neck head
[1:06:20] speaking seeing
[1:06:22] intelligence
[1:06:24] that's intelligence
[1:06:25] this intelligence age the fullness of
[1:06:28] the word
[1:06:29] god
[1:06:30] revealing himself in the fullness of who
[1:06:33] he is that mystical body of jesus christ
[1:06:36] that he's been building from that time
[1:06:38] when that seed fell on the ground god's
[1:06:40] been building that body up to this point
[1:06:42] up to this time and the intelligence and
[1:06:45] the message of the hour to bring a bride
[1:06:48] back into perfect unity with the
[1:06:50] bridegroom again just like it was in the
[1:06:52] garden of eden save all the sin around
[1:06:55] us
[1:06:56] amen just like it was the garden of eden
[1:06:59] god and man coming embracing together
[1:07:01] once again
[1:07:03] that is this age you can't dislocate it
[1:07:06] amen you can't uh
[1:07:08] put it back in a different age it's
[1:07:11] today it is this day this is the day
[1:07:13] that we live now some people want to say
[1:07:15] oh well sanctification's great
[1:07:18] and it is
[1:07:20] but we got to have more than
[1:07:21] sanctification if we're going to try to
[1:07:23] go in a rapture yes you must be born
[1:07:26] again yes there's got to be the
[1:07:28] justification sanctification peter said
[1:07:30] on the day of pentecost repent
[1:07:33] be baptized in jesus christ in jesus
[1:07:36] name and you shall receive the gift of
[1:07:38] the holy ghost the promise to you unto
[1:07:40] them and that gift gives way for the for
[1:07:43] the life of christ to come and take
[1:07:45] permanent residence of your soul
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:50] that's a different age
[1:07:51] it's a different time
[1:07:53] you can't dislocate it it's got to be
[1:07:56] exactly at that time it's got to be like
[1:07:58] the puzzle that was made and every piece
[1:08:00] of that puzzle
[1:08:02] has to be exactly where it's supposed to
[1:08:04] be
[1:08:05] amen every piece of it again you can't
[1:08:08] you can take your picture but you can't
[1:08:10] put the cow in the tree and
[1:08:13] the birds got to be in the tree cows got
[1:08:15] to be on the ground right the picture's
[1:08:17] got a
[1:08:18] no
[1:08:19] no portion
[1:08:21] and i say that because there's so much
[1:08:24] uh
[1:08:26] misplacement of the word that's gonna
[1:08:29] say misinterpret but misplacement of the
[1:08:31] word there's so much of the misplacement
[1:08:34] of the word
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:36] that people say well brother branham
[1:08:38] said that's of course a lot of the most
[1:08:41] famous things that people in the message
[1:08:42] like to say well brother branham said
[1:08:45] well it's like we found out last week
[1:08:49] satan came to jesus and said it is
[1:08:51] written
[1:08:53] what was he doing
[1:08:55] he was misplacing the word
[1:08:57] you say misinterpreting the word
[1:08:59] misplacing the word he was misplacing
[1:09:01] the word he was putting it out of its
[1:09:03] context he was putting it out of what
[1:09:07] what the scripture was written to bring
[1:09:09] us
[1:09:10] enlightenment on it he was misplacing it
[1:09:13] that's why jesus said it is also written
[1:09:17] now people like to say that the word
[1:09:19] correct the word the word correct the
[1:09:22] error because you can't correct the word
[1:09:24] because there's nothing wrong with the
[1:09:25] word am i so the word didn't correct the
[1:09:28] word the word corrected the misplacement
[1:09:31] of that word
[1:09:32] when satan displaced it jesus came and
[1:09:35] said it is also written to put all the
[1:09:37] scripture back where it belongs to take
[1:09:40] that cow out of the tree and put it on
[1:09:42] the ground
[1:09:43] to take that bird and put him where he
[1:09:45] belongs in the heavens
[1:09:49] jesus did that and he gave it to us for
[1:09:52] an example to make sure we didn't do
[1:09:54] that and people do that today oh brother
[1:09:57] mam said what did he say it based on
[1:09:59] your interpretation did he say it based
[1:10:01] on what you think he meant did you base
[1:10:04] it based on your doctrine did you base
[1:10:06] it based on uh
[1:10:07] something that you believed back over
[1:10:09] here that you saw and got some grandeur
[1:10:11] of a revelation or something
[1:10:14] and then you come and say but you know
[1:10:16] it says this over here and the word says
[1:10:18] that's why we have to take everything
[1:10:20] back to the word yes amen how many times
[1:10:23] should we say brother branham said and
[1:10:25] then another one come and say but
[1:10:26] brother graham said over here no let's
[1:10:28] take it back to the word
[1:10:30] if brother branham said it it's in here
[1:10:33] yes it is because he did not leave the
[1:10:36] pages of this bible
[1:10:38] so if he said it it's in here
[1:10:40] so if you believe a specific
[1:10:43] interpretation
[1:10:44] or taking that puzzle piece and putting
[1:10:46] it in a corner when it belongs in the
[1:10:48] middle then let's take it back to the
[1:10:50] word let's find out where it does belong
[1:10:53] let's see it in here
[1:10:55] if you can't find it in here and it's
[1:10:57] not dovetailing one scripture to the
[1:10:59] other which it will dovetail one
[1:11:01] scripture to the other it will dovetail
[1:11:04] one uh quote to the other if it doesn't
[1:11:06] do that there's nothing wrong with that
[1:11:08] scripture
[1:11:10] you gotta go and find out where you got
[1:11:11] off
[1:11:13] he gave us a straight narrow path
[1:11:16] few there will be that find it we are
[1:11:18] supposed to stay on that straight narrow
[1:11:20] path but as soon as you get a little
[1:11:22] piece missing you're in the wrong place
[1:11:25] you get off just a tick and it doesn't
[1:11:27] take much
[1:11:29] amen just like in the garden of eden
[1:11:31] friend
[1:11:32] just one word
[1:11:34] that satan misinterpreted to eve
[1:11:38] that one work took it off just a tick
[1:11:41] but that little tick just that little
[1:11:43] off
[1:11:44] is what threw the whole world into the
[1:11:46] chaotic state that it's in today
[1:11:49] all it has to be is just that little bit
[1:11:51] and if you continue to follow that
[1:11:54] that thought process you continue to
[1:11:57] thought follow along with that and you
[1:11:59] find something else you think matches up
[1:12:01] with it or another scripture that
[1:12:03] matches up with it although it's not
[1:12:04] matching with the other scripture that's
[1:12:06] why so many people they get a lot of
[1:12:08] grace all confused
[1:12:10] and so well that's just in the old
[1:12:12] testament
[1:12:13] well then why don't you just take
[1:12:15] genesis to malachi rip it out of your
[1:12:17] bible and just go burn it
[1:12:20] if it means that little to you just
[1:12:22] throw it throw in the garbage
[1:12:26] david psalms
[1:12:28] proverbs solomon it's all old scriptures
[1:12:31] old testament too
[1:12:33] well then throw in the garbage if you
[1:12:34] don't believe the old testament throw it
[1:12:36] away but you're like chopping jesus in
[1:12:38] half because you get rid of the word
[1:12:41] and people and they misinterpret that
[1:12:45] to people and they prey upon people's
[1:12:48] desires and lusts
[1:12:50] because the truth is
[1:12:53] you can go to any church that'll tell
[1:12:55] you anything that you want to hear yeah
[1:12:58] there's churches out there i guarantee
[1:13:00] you'll find one that you that you like
[1:13:02] that that'll be saying the things that
[1:13:04] you want to hear somewhere some
[1:13:06] denomination
[1:13:08] if it's just a 15-minute sermon you'll
[1:13:10] find someplace out there that says that
[1:13:13] it'll say exactly what you want to hear
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:16] and then you can fit right in it's like
[1:13:18] uh
[1:13:19] when i was purchasing back in charlotte
[1:13:21] years this is 1989 90.
[1:13:25] there was a sales consultant called us
[1:13:27] older gentleman he's a christian
[1:13:28] professing christian he was a nice man
[1:13:31] and he was trying to tell the purchasing
[1:13:33] manager at the time my boss
[1:13:35] about going to church he's always
[1:13:37] witnessing and you know everybody has
[1:13:39] their excuses if they're not going and
[1:13:42] and not that you miss a service or two
[1:13:43] but i'm talking about just people that
[1:13:45] just don't go
[1:13:46] they'd rather cut the grass on sunday
[1:13:48] but um
[1:13:50] or whatever what do we do what are they
[1:13:52] uh rage or gravel on sunday
[1:13:55] or your dirt whatever it is here in
[1:13:57] tucson they'd rather do that on a sunday
[1:13:59] they just don't go and he's telling him
[1:14:01] he said
[1:14:03] you need to find you a church and go
[1:14:04] there i mean like making church the only
[1:14:07] way you can be saved
[1:14:09] uh i believe if you're saved though you
[1:14:10] will go to church but
[1:14:12] uh throwing the church didn't save you
[1:14:14] either you need to find one he said
[1:14:16] they're like gloves churches are like
[1:14:18] gloves you just need to keep going until
[1:14:19] you find that glove that fits right into
[1:14:21] your hand i thought what a subtle lie
[1:14:23] the devil that is
[1:14:24] this christian man this good christian
[1:14:27] man is trying to teach this man they
[1:14:29] just go find your glove that fits now
[1:14:31] you better go find you a man of god that
[1:14:33] preaches a pure unadulterated word or
[1:14:35] you're going to hell
[1:14:38] that's the way it is
[1:14:39] you repent or perish yes that's the way
[1:14:42] the scripture is not all just find a
[1:14:44] glove it's as long as that gloves fit
[1:14:47] it's it's okay
[1:14:49] and that's and it is but it is true
[1:14:52] if you look long enough it goes back to
[1:14:55] what i said a couple weeks weeks ago
[1:14:57] people are just going to do what they
[1:14:58] want to do
[1:15:00] most of the times they just try to find
[1:15:02] an excuse to do it
[1:15:04] they just try to follow well so-and-so
[1:15:06] said son said so i don't have to do that
[1:15:09] because some somebody says see they
[1:15:11] showed it in the scripture they read
[1:15:13] this scripture
[1:15:15] yeah but how is that scripture applied
[1:15:18] is it misplaced
[1:15:20] is it misinterpreted is it dislocated
[1:15:22] you got to find out how that scripture
[1:15:24] lines up with everything if the excuse
[1:15:26] is just oh it's old testament then just
[1:15:28] rip the whole thing out
[1:15:31] oh now they don't want to do that it's
[1:15:33] just certain things well then who gave
[1:15:35] you the authority
[1:15:36] who puts you as the arbiter of truth in
[1:15:40] charge of what part of the old testament
[1:15:42] we're supposed to believe and live and
[1:15:44] which part we're not
[1:15:46] who puts you in charge to tell me that
[1:15:48] that scripture is inspired in that
[1:15:50] scripture isn't friend every bit of him
[1:15:53] from genesis 1 to revelation 22 is
[1:15:55] inspired and we are to obey it all amen
[1:15:59] amen just a lack of revelation
[1:16:02] a lack of revelation amen law versus
[1:16:05] grace oh it gets so scrupled up but the
[1:16:08] bottom line is they find teachers we
[1:16:10] read that scripture last week teachers
[1:16:12] having itching ears they'll say whatever
[1:16:14] you want them to say
[1:16:15] as long as you keep coming and giving
[1:16:17] them your money and doing all to make
[1:16:19] their church a big church and a good
[1:16:21] name and
[1:16:22] on tv or whatever it is you just keep
[1:16:24] coming it's okay greens grass sky is
[1:16:26] blue and everything's beautiful
[1:16:28] just say beautiful pure holy good you
[1:16:31] know
[1:16:32] and and it really doesn't matter other
[1:16:34] uh otherwise yeah they're just
[1:16:37] patronizing people
[1:16:39] instead of preaching the gospel
[1:16:41] the gospel is to be preached is to be
[1:16:43] lived
[1:16:44] it's not to be pandered to
[1:16:46] it's not to try to make some excuse or
[1:16:48] find some reason
[1:16:50] to do something or not do something that
[1:16:53] that god says for you to or not to do
[1:16:55] just to try to fit your ends
[1:16:57] just to try to pacify something is the
[1:17:00] desire you had in your heart to begin
[1:17:02] with
[1:17:04] i didn't want to do this to begin with i
[1:17:05] finally found somebody that showed me
[1:17:07] the scripture that i don't have to
[1:17:12] my mind
[1:17:13] where does that leave
[1:17:15] where does that put it
[1:17:18] is it misinterpreted dislocated
[1:17:19] misplaced friend if it doesn't fall
[1:17:21] through this word
[1:17:22] genesis to revelation it's like i said
[1:17:24] last week this is the filter
[1:17:27] but that holy ghost
[1:17:28] the filter this word must go through
[1:17:30] every part of it
[1:17:32] and if it doesn't if there's a hang up
[1:17:34] somewhere you say oh i'm supposed to do
[1:17:36] this or i shouldn't do that or something
[1:17:38] that you find in the scripture oh but
[1:17:40] that that that's old testament
[1:17:42] yeah so we'll just throw that out oh but
[1:17:44] jesus didn't really mean it that way you
[1:17:46] know well i'll be baptized this way
[1:17:48] jesus you know peter peter was just
[1:17:50] peter but jesus said this
[1:17:53] see whatever excuse they can find
[1:17:56] see it says right there there's there's
[1:17:58] three gods
[1:18:00] whatever excuse people can find
[1:18:02] to mislocate
[1:18:04] displace misplace this cloak dislocate
[1:18:07] the word anything
[1:18:08] to to try to
[1:18:10] fit
[1:18:11] what they want to do
[1:18:13] the desires of the heart the bottom line
[1:18:15] of all that is they don't have the holy
[1:18:18] ghost
[1:18:20] they're not born again
[1:18:22] and they're just trying to find an
[1:18:24] excuse somehow somewhere
[1:18:26] try to back it up with some
[1:18:28] quote somewhere or scripture to try to
[1:18:31] justify their ends
[1:18:33] when the truth is they're not born again
[1:18:35] they didn't want to do it to start with
[1:18:37] right
[1:18:38] but it's obed disobedience to the word
[1:18:42] that disobedience will lead you down a
[1:18:44] path you don't want to go for him
[1:18:46] you're getting off that little bit of a
[1:18:48] tick and if you get that little bit off
[1:18:50] it's like i said last week
[1:18:52] people say well i i i listened to this
[1:18:54] preacher i said well you know that
[1:18:56] preacher believes this right
[1:18:58] this this minister is a trinitarian
[1:19:00] ministry believes there's three gods
[1:19:01] three separate gods three separate
[1:19:02] people
[1:19:04] oh yeah but he never preaches that
[1:19:07] but every single thing he sees and it
[1:19:10] gets filtered through gets filtered
[1:19:12] through with the understanding of three
[1:19:14] gods right it's tainted from the
[1:19:17] beginning yes
[1:19:19] you understand
[1:19:20] it's tainted from the start
[1:19:22] it doesn't matter if he doesn't preach
[1:19:24] that exact scripture
[1:19:26] everything he sees in the word has to be
[1:19:29] filtered through that demonic lie
[1:19:32] yes
[1:19:33] they've misplaced it
[1:19:36] dislocated and somehow they've gotten
[1:19:38] off but they do it because most of
[1:19:41] first they're not born again
[1:19:43] second they want that that was a desire
[1:19:45] in their heart to begin with
[1:19:48] oh you you can try to manipulate the
[1:19:51] word
[1:19:52] and sisters cut your hair all day or not
[1:19:54] wear dresses or dress holy or whatever
[1:19:56] it is and just live like the rest of the
[1:19:58] world
[1:20:00] ministers out in the world preaching oh
[1:20:02] it's okay to get yourself all scarred up
[1:20:04] with a bunch of colors and numbers and
[1:20:07] tattoos and stuff
[1:20:09] there's ministers people
[1:20:12] that call themselves ministers behind
[1:20:14] pulpits and say that's okay
[1:20:18] and people go there and say well my
[1:20:19] preacher says it's okay where did he get
[1:20:21] it from
[1:20:23] did he misplace it somewhere in here oh
[1:20:26] well we shouldn't scar our bodies that's
[1:20:28] old testament there you go again
[1:20:31] old testament i can show you in the new
[1:20:32] testament too if you want to see it
[1:20:35] not that the old testament is gone done
[1:20:37] away with but there's a truth to it yes
[1:20:40] and all it does is give people a leg way
[1:20:44] to do what was in their heart to begin
[1:20:46] with
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] and it's in their heart because they
[1:20:50] don't have god
[1:20:52] that's unfortunately that becomes the
[1:20:54] bottom line
[1:20:56] it was in their heart
[1:20:58] to do this
[1:20:59] to live this way or whatever to get that
[1:21:02] tattoo let's just be very specific
[1:21:05] it was in their heart to do it all along
[1:21:08] they just found an excuse
[1:21:10] he finally found a reason
[1:21:12] somebody said or somebody quoted or
[1:21:14] somebody came up with a scripture
[1:21:17] and made it okay
[1:21:20] it's misplaced
[1:21:22] mislocated
[1:21:24] something's wrong somewhere
[1:21:25] amen it's got to be according to the
[1:21:28] scripture genesis to revelation
[1:21:30] now let's go to another scripture
[1:21:34] i know that may sound hard friend but
[1:21:36] it's just the truth
[1:21:40] it's like i said a week or two ago
[1:21:42] people
[1:21:43] ultimately people are going to do
[1:21:45] whatever they want to do
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:49] they're they're going to live however
[1:21:51] they want to live
[1:21:55] if they're not born again yes
[1:21:57] if they're born again
[1:21:59] they're not going to do what they want
[1:22:00] to do they're going to do what he wants
[1:22:02] them to do yes
[1:22:03] they're not going to live the way they
[1:22:05] want to live they're going to live the
[1:22:06] way he wants them to live
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:10] matthew chapter 17
[1:22:16] let's see how jesus
[1:22:18] straightens out the word for the
[1:22:19] disciples who had it all scrupled up
[1:22:30] matthew chapter 17
[1:22:36] verse 10.
[1:22:39] and his disciples asked him saying why
[1:22:41] then say the scribes that elias must
[1:22:43] first come see they got it all scrupled
[1:22:46] up that's why they asked the question
[1:22:48] and that's good they needed to ask the
[1:22:49] question they needed to get straightened
[1:22:51] out scripturally
[1:22:53] jesus answered and said unto them elias
[1:22:57] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:23:00] things
[1:23:01] that is spoken in a future tense yes
[1:23:05] so there is an elijah that is to come
[1:23:09] that will restore all things
[1:23:12] now we know that couldn't be even the
[1:23:14] scofield notes you read
[1:23:16] scofield's all scrupled up with his
[1:23:18] notes
[1:23:19] but there there was to be a restoration
[1:23:23] gift
[1:23:24] a restoration ministry
[1:23:27] to bring a people to that position
[1:23:30] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:23:32] lord
[1:23:33] dreadful to the world great to the bride
[1:23:36] so that day jesus is putting in place
[1:23:39] now they know the scripture
[1:23:41] and they're quoting the scripture to
[1:23:42] jesus
[1:23:44] why does the bible why does it say this
[1:23:47] jesus said elias truly shall first come
[1:23:50] and restore all things that's future
[1:23:52] tense so there will be a ministry that
[1:23:55] will restore back
[1:23:56] now what's it going to restore it's
[1:23:58] going to restore
[1:24:00] exactly what malachi said it would
[1:24:02] restore behold i send to you elijah the
[1:24:06] prophet but come before the coming of
[1:24:08] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:24:10] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:24:12] fathers to the children which was then
[1:24:15] and the heart of the children to the
[1:24:17] fathers which is now lest i come and
[1:24:19] smite the earth with a curse
[1:24:22] now that word that word had to begin
[1:24:24] dual meaning the first part
[1:24:26] by that spirit of elijah the first part
[1:24:29] being fulfilled by john the baptist
[1:24:31] turning the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:24:33] children
[1:24:34] and then by the message we know the
[1:24:37] message of the hour to turn the hearts
[1:24:38] of the children back to the fathers the
[1:24:41] faith amen the faith of the fathers now
[1:24:44] jesus is trying to lay this to them
[1:24:46] because they're looking at it and they
[1:24:48] don't understand it
[1:24:50] most people don't understand it today
[1:24:52] yes
[1:24:53] and a lot of times ministers look at it
[1:24:55] and
[1:24:56] almost say something
[1:24:58] uh don't please don't take me wrong but
[1:25:00] there's ministers this message got that
[1:25:02] scrupled up not just out in the world
[1:25:05] but we'll talk about worldly
[1:25:08] veins now
[1:25:09] they get this scrupled up they don't
[1:25:12] understand it and you know most of the
[1:25:14] time when they don't understand
[1:25:16] something like this they avoid it
[1:25:18] they don't even preach on it they won't
[1:25:20] even get to it and read it or if they do
[1:25:22] they'll just place everything on john
[1:25:25] the baptist as jesus said this next now
[1:25:27] look but i say unto you that elias has
[1:25:30] come already now that's past tense and
[1:25:32] they knew him not
[1:25:34] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:25:37] listed likewise shall also the son of
[1:25:39] man suffer of them the disciples
[1:25:42] understood he spake them of john the
[1:25:44] baptist on the second part
[1:25:47] but not the first part
[1:25:48] john the baptist didn't restore anything
[1:25:53] jesus said that this elijah ministry
[1:25:56] that was in the future was to bring a
[1:25:59] restoration
[1:26:01] john didn't restore anything so what's
[1:26:03] jesus doing
[1:26:05] by the gospels in matthew's gospel here
[1:26:08] those chairmans with flaming sword
[1:26:10] keeping this word at a guard keeping it
[1:26:13] protected from just anybody well it says
[1:26:16] just right there
[1:26:17] you know most people wanted to well it's
[1:26:19] just got to be plain and simple right
[1:26:21] there no no no
[1:26:22] god writes the scripture to where the
[1:26:25] common person without a new birth and a
[1:26:28] revelation of this cannot receive it
[1:26:32] they can't see it
[1:26:34] there has to be that that new birth
[1:26:37] that revelation of the word that god
[1:26:39] would reveal it in the context he said
[1:26:42] it
[1:26:43] wrote it
[1:26:44] that's why he puts it like this but
[1:26:45] people want to say hey
[1:26:48] they even come to jesus
[1:26:50] if you are who you just tell us plain
[1:26:52] just tell us outright
[1:26:55] and then jesus would tell him i am the
[1:26:57] son of god blasphemy
[1:27:01] you asked me to tell you right i just
[1:27:03] told you
[1:27:04] and it made you mad
[1:27:07] so the point was they didn't want to
[1:27:08] hear it
[1:27:10] they they weren't concerned with what
[1:27:12] the truth was
[1:27:14] they just had the misplacement of that
[1:27:16] just like they did
[1:27:17] isaiah said a virgin shall conceive a
[1:27:19] virgin conceived but was the pharisees
[1:27:22] and sadducees they hung onto their
[1:27:24] dogmas they hung on to their doctrines
[1:27:27] friend the only way you ever see it is
[1:27:29] to die to yourself to die to any earth
[1:27:32] training of a catholic church or gone to
[1:27:34] some seminary or
[1:27:36] or or been raised in some denomination
[1:27:38] and you know
[1:27:40] you got to guide all that yes all that
[1:27:42] has to go away yes to enter into the
[1:27:46] purity and holiness of this word to be
[1:27:48] born again
[1:27:49] let god reveal that to you jesus is he
[1:27:53] he's explaining it and breaking it out
[1:27:55] to them and saying yes
[1:27:57] there
[1:27:58] the scripture does say that can i
[1:27:59] paraphrase
[1:28:01] the scripture does say that
[1:28:03] and it says it that there will be an
[1:28:05] elijah that is to come
[1:28:07] that's going to restore all things
[1:28:10] now these they didn't understand the
[1:28:12] restoration at that point because
[1:28:14] nothing had been fallen
[1:28:16] what is there to restore at this point
[1:28:18] of the scripture what is there to
[1:28:20] restore
[1:28:22] well they after this they reach the
[1:28:24] pinnacle of the new birth in the upper
[1:28:26] room and the and the gifts of the spirit
[1:28:29] and then it fell down and the seed went
[1:28:31] into the ground and came up and through
[1:28:33] luther and wesley and it came back back
[1:28:35] to the point of restoration again
[1:28:37] bringing it back
[1:28:39] to a place that it had fallen from yes
[1:28:42] that's the only way you can restore
[1:28:43] something
[1:28:44] something was here
[1:28:46] it became an
[1:28:48] a a condition it shouldn't be in
[1:28:50] to restore it is to bring it back to
[1:28:52] where it was yes
[1:28:54] by the past restoring cars
[1:28:57] i see cars going down the road i think
[1:28:59] what a hunk of junk
[1:29:00] it's rusted out there's hardly a body on
[1:29:02] it and tops flying and flapping all over
[1:29:05] the place and there's no hood and
[1:29:06] everything's all that said what a hunk
[1:29:08] of junk but somebody else who knows what
[1:29:10] they're doing and what they're looking
[1:29:12] at will look at that car and say my
[1:29:14] that's a masterpiece i want that so
[1:29:16] what's he going to do with it he's going
[1:29:18] to take that car he's going to spend
[1:29:20] thousands of dollars dragging it across
[1:29:22] the country and he's going to restore it
[1:29:24] to what it was when he came off the
[1:29:26] factory line
[1:29:27] it was here this was the perfection of
[1:29:29] that automobile
[1:29:31] and then through wear and tear and miles
[1:29:33] and everything it became a punk of junk
[1:29:35] and most people look at it think it's a
[1:29:36] hunk of junk
[1:29:38] but then when that man with that eye
[1:29:41] the man that can look at it and put it
[1:29:43] in his proper place
[1:29:45] amen you got to know it to be able to
[1:29:48] put it in his proper place
[1:29:50] you've got to know it and when you know
[1:29:52] it and you know the value of it and you
[1:29:54] know what the value of it is to your
[1:29:56] heart
[1:29:56] you put it in its proper place then the
[1:29:59] restoration comes and puts it back what
[1:30:01] it was like
[1:30:02] as close as possible from the showroom
[1:30:05] floor
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:07] thank god that this comes not close as
[1:30:10] possible comes exactly like that and
[1:30:12] takes us home
[1:30:14] praise the lord amen
[1:30:17] john the baptist didn't do that
[1:30:19] john about knew nothing about
[1:30:21] restoration that's why jesus said there
[1:30:23] is one that's coming
[1:30:25] but there has also been one and they
[1:30:27] killed him
[1:30:28] chopped his head off they did whatever
[1:30:31] they wanted to they hated him he had no
[1:30:33] education
[1:30:34] he had no affiliation he had no
[1:30:36] denomination a
[1:30:38] fellowship card
[1:30:40] he had none other uh their mainstream
[1:30:43] beliefs
[1:30:44] he just came out of the woods with
[1:30:47] honey dripping off his beard and told
[1:30:49] them that you must be baptized and
[1:30:52] repent in jesus that wasn't in jesus
[1:30:54] name at that time but be repent but
[1:30:56] repent of your sins and be baptized
[1:30:59] he had a message
[1:31:01] they didn't listen to him they thought
[1:31:03] it was crazy
[1:31:04] they went to spy on him
[1:31:07] and he looked at him and said you snakes
[1:31:09] in the grass
[1:31:11] you want to come here and show me that
[1:31:13] you're
[1:31:14] serious about what's going on here
[1:31:16] he said you show me some fruits of your
[1:31:19] repentance and then we'll talk
[1:31:22] amen give me some fruits of your
[1:31:24] repentance you say i want to repent no
[1:31:26] there's got to be fruits to follow that
[1:31:27] repentance or you're just a liar
[1:31:31] amen i'm sorry it's awful hard today but
[1:31:33] that's the truth
[1:31:35] amen there's one place that liars go yes
[1:31:38] we all know what the scripture says
[1:31:40] where liars end up that's in hell
[1:31:42] and he told him you have a bunch of
[1:31:44] snakes in the grass
[1:31:45] the axes laid to the root of the tree
[1:31:48] you serpents
[1:31:50] you show me some fruits we'll go from
[1:31:52] there they weren't there for
[1:31:55] for sincerity they were there for show
[1:31:58] they didn't care about what john was
[1:32:00] doing they didn't care about being
[1:32:01] baptized or anything else because they
[1:32:04] had it it wasn't in their heart
[1:32:06] it wasn't a desire
[1:32:10] amen there's got to be that desire jesus
[1:32:13] breaks it out for him
[1:32:15] it's going to be a lodge coming but
[1:32:17] there's elijah been here already and you
[1:32:19] did whatever to him you treated him in
[1:32:21] whatever manner
[1:32:23] even john the baptist came to the point
[1:32:25] that his eyes his eagle eyes got dimmed
[1:32:27] over and he sent some of his disciples
[1:32:30] that still followed him
[1:32:33] even though he told his disciples
[1:32:36] he had told his followers
[1:32:38] there's the lamb of god follow him
[1:32:42] amen even though he's even though the
[1:32:45] prophet
[1:32:46] said there he is follow him
[1:32:49] there were still men that stayed and
[1:32:51] followed john the baptist
[1:32:54] sound familiar
[1:32:56] yes
[1:32:57] even though the prophet of god came in
[1:32:59] this day and said there he is
[1:33:03] follow him
[1:33:04] they still follow brother branham
[1:33:07] amen
[1:33:08] and and i don't mean in the context that
[1:33:10] we we follow his message and believe his
[1:33:12] word i mean just believing that he's god
[1:33:15] baptizing in his name and all that they
[1:33:17] do
[1:33:18] they still had disciples and that evil
[1:33:20] eye being dimmed over he sent some of
[1:33:22] his men over and said go ask and see
[1:33:24] is he the one or is there one still
[1:33:26] coming
[1:33:28] and he said you go back and tell john
[1:33:30] the things that you've seen and heard
[1:33:31] and been testified to you go tell him
[1:33:34] what has all happened happening he'll
[1:33:35] know who i am
[1:33:38] praise the lord even though he baptized
[1:33:40] him and
[1:33:41] met him at the river and baptized him
[1:33:44] and saw the spirit come down on him his
[1:33:46] eagle eye even got timed over go ask and
[1:33:48] see he said you just tell him this he'll
[1:33:50] know
[1:33:52] amen and he knew
[1:33:54] now he said well i gotta decrease so
[1:33:55] that he'll increase
[1:33:57] didn't our prophet do the same thing
[1:33:59] yeah did he say the same thing i've got
[1:34:01] to decrease now so that this increases
[1:34:05] praise the lord increases in your life
[1:34:07] why why did he have to go away
[1:34:10] because people were getting the word
[1:34:11] dislocated yes they were looking at
[1:34:13] birth to brother branham as it
[1:34:16] i think i told you one time that the
[1:34:17] church i used to go to kind of uh broke
[1:34:21] i've you know i've been in the message
[1:34:23] most of all my life but when i came back
[1:34:25] to lord i got baptized filled with the
[1:34:27] holy ghost started ministering and there
[1:34:29] was
[1:34:29] there was a sister that was in the
[1:34:31] church bless her heart just absolute
[1:34:33] precious sister
[1:34:35] um but
[1:34:36] oh if if brother branham would just hear
[1:34:39] he would pray for me
[1:34:42] okay
[1:34:43] is it god still here you're not right is
[1:34:46] it god the one that heals you
[1:34:48] brother brown didn't heal you
[1:34:50] if you
[1:34:51] if if
[1:34:52] if you need to have a physical corporal
[1:34:55] body a brother brandon standing here to
[1:34:57] be able to raise your faith to the level
[1:34:58] to receive that healing then you've got
[1:35:00] worse problems
[1:35:02] yes
[1:35:03] and that's true
[1:35:05] and again
[1:35:06] that may be an awful hard saying but
[1:35:08] it's the truth
[1:35:10] because
[1:35:11] our faith is in christ yes our faith is
[1:35:14] in god we know god's the healer so god
[1:35:18] had to take brother abraham said i got a
[1:35:20] decrease god had to take that
[1:35:22] because every every every from what i've
[1:35:24] been told
[1:35:26] i wasn't here i was alive 10 days before
[1:35:28] brother brown passed away but my brother
[1:35:30] green had different ones i've i've met
[1:35:32] dozens of men that spent time with
[1:35:34] brother branham including brother pat
[1:35:37] that told me
[1:35:38] that
[1:35:40] everybody was looking to brother brown
[1:35:43] they were looking to him that's not what
[1:35:46] his message was about and that's not
[1:35:48] what the intent was to be but it's
[1:35:50] inevitable that as us as humans would do
[1:35:52] that it happened all through the
[1:35:54] scripture so he had to decrease
[1:35:57] so that we get our eyes off of a man and
[1:35:59] onto god
[1:36:01] the god that that man was pointing us to
[1:36:04] yes the message that that man was
[1:36:06] bringing us to and pointing us to
[1:36:10] so that that word christ the word
[1:36:13] will come and
[1:36:15] cap this bride
[1:36:18] praise the lord
[1:36:19] capper but people would get
[1:36:21] dislocated
[1:36:23] misplaced
[1:36:25] this scripture here or there and get it
[1:36:27] all jumbled up just like they did here
[1:36:29] and jesus had to correct them oh yes
[1:36:32] there's elijah coming but this elijah's
[1:36:34] already been and didn't even talk about
[1:36:36] the elijah the original elijah elisha
[1:36:39] and the old testament oh but you people
[1:36:41] got rid of the old testament so i guess
[1:36:42] you don't talk about elijah elijah
[1:36:44] anymore even though it comes in the new
[1:36:46] testament silson
[1:36:47] but unfortunately that's the way a lot
[1:36:49] of people treat him but jesus had to set
[1:36:53] it straight
[1:36:54] amen kind of said it's true let's go
[1:36:56] over to one more scripture i'm going to
[1:36:57] close
[1:37:03] jesus putting
[1:37:04] each elijah where they belong
[1:37:07] hebrews
[1:37:09] we're going to hebrews
[1:37:13] amen chapter 13 verse 8.
[1:37:16] you all probably could quote it just as
[1:37:18] much as i could quote it
[1:37:20] one of the themes brother brahma's
[1:37:21] ministry
[1:37:22] hebrews 13 8
[1:37:24] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:37:27] today and forever
[1:37:30] amen jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:37:34] today
[1:37:35] and forever
[1:37:37] amen he told him back in the old
[1:37:38] testament i am the lord thy god i change
[1:37:41] not
[1:37:43] he's the same
[1:37:45] he's the same right now as he was then
[1:37:47] as he has always been
[1:37:50] people misplaced the scripture
[1:37:54] you probably all know one of the things
[1:37:57] back at brother branham's day to try to
[1:37:59] to try to make brother branham look like
[1:38:01] he was possessed of some demon
[1:38:04] when all these people
[1:38:07] healings and manifestations and
[1:38:10] and
[1:38:12] prophecies and things that came forth
[1:38:15] to try to discredit it
[1:38:17] to say oh that would that was only for
[1:38:19] the apostles
[1:38:21] that ended that ceased when the last
[1:38:23] apostle died so you showed me that in
[1:38:25] the bible
[1:38:27] that might be what your seminary teaches
[1:38:29] but i want to know what this word says
[1:38:32] did it cease when the last apostle died
[1:38:35] but that's misplacing the word that's
[1:38:37] taking the wrong piece the puzzle piece
[1:38:39] and putting it out of place
[1:38:41] no it didn't die when the last apostle
[1:38:44] died he's the same today
[1:38:47] as he was then he does the same thing
[1:38:50] we know i've said this brother around he
[1:38:52] said it
[1:38:53] dozens of times if god did it one way
[1:38:56] for one person he's got to do it the
[1:38:57] same way for the second person or he's
[1:38:59] not god
[1:39:00] if the same condition arose in the old
[1:39:03] testament new testament back in life
[1:39:06] wherever it was if that arose at one
[1:39:08] point and god acted a certain way
[1:39:10] towards it the same circumstances come
[1:39:12] again god's got to do the exact same
[1:39:14] thing or he's not god
[1:39:17] that's why the whole scripture runs in
[1:39:19] perfect continuity together
[1:39:23] from the very beginning when god took
[1:39:25] lambs and sacrificed them and gave them
[1:39:27] to adam and eve to the very end where he
[1:39:30] said that the the bride
[1:39:32] the the lamb's wife has made herself
[1:39:35] ready amen amen
[1:39:38] the lamb
[1:39:39] all the way through
[1:39:40] it's all
[1:39:42] jesus christ
[1:39:44] every letter every jot and tittle as
[1:39:46] brother branham would say that's every
[1:39:48] mark every punctuation
[1:39:50] is is christ all the way through
[1:39:53] if you don't
[1:39:55] see it
[1:39:56] as jesus christ in every word
[1:40:00] of this message and this word if you
[1:40:03] don't see jesus christ go read it again
[1:40:06] pray god asks uh ask god god show me i'm
[1:40:10] missing something here
[1:40:12] something is not
[1:40:14] clicking right lord show it to me help
[1:40:16] me see it
[1:40:18] god i'll show it to you
[1:40:20] it might not be right that minute but
[1:40:22] he'll show it to you he'll help you see
[1:40:24] it it's like i told mentioned last week
[1:40:26] program said god will let you
[1:40:29] let you know it when you have need of
[1:40:30] knowing it right
[1:40:32] and there's times and places
[1:40:35] you look at and say well god gave
[1:40:37] god gave isaiah the prophecy a virgin
[1:40:40] shall conceive
[1:40:42] well it didn't happen right then
[1:40:45] it didn't happen at that church it
[1:40:47] didn't happen in his lifetime
[1:40:49] it didn't happen in the old testament
[1:40:52] it wasn't until mary came along almost
[1:40:55] 800 years later
[1:40:58] but the scripture was finally fulfilled
[1:41:01] so there is always not just a a
[1:41:04] thing but
[1:41:05] but a place there's a time
[1:41:07] for everything too so it might not be
[1:41:10] time but ask him anyway yes
[1:41:12] and it's like i said when you're going
[1:41:14] along in life you're living for god
[1:41:16] you're reading the bible you're praying
[1:41:17] or something and something just drops in
[1:41:20] there and he's there there it is and
[1:41:22] you've got it and you know because god
[1:41:24] fits it all together just perfectly
[1:41:27] you don't have to manufacture something
[1:41:29] it's like telling a lie
[1:41:31] you know why people have a hard time
[1:41:33] maintaining a good lie
[1:41:35] because they change the details all the
[1:41:37] time because they can't remember the lie
[1:41:39] they told two weeks ago right
[1:41:41] but when you have the truth and it's
[1:41:44] embedded in your memory and you you
[1:41:46] experienced it it's something
[1:41:48] uh
[1:41:49] if you don't embellish uh it's something
[1:41:52] that stays with you and you can tell it
[1:41:54] the same way over and over and over yes
[1:41:56] because it's that
[1:41:58] prevalent i heard brother green tell
[1:42:00] stories all the time
[1:42:02] all the time brother green told the
[1:42:04] stories all the time
[1:42:07] but i will say
[1:42:10] outside of you know a margin for human
[1:42:13] error
[1:42:14] a small margin it was exact this story
[1:42:16] was the exact same from the first time i
[1:42:18] ever heard him tell it till the time
[1:42:20] right before he passed away
[1:42:22] the same the story the details was the
[1:42:24] same every time
[1:42:26] i heard him tell it same time same thing
[1:42:29] every time
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:32] that's the way it is when you tell the
[1:42:33] truth if you tell a lie it's hard to
[1:42:35] remember right
[1:42:37] what detail did i tell what who did i
[1:42:39] say this to and who did i tell that to
[1:42:42] because it becomes
[1:42:44] it comes a muddled mess this is saying
[1:42:46] that it's the same way people treat the
[1:42:48] word
[1:42:50] but if it's something that is
[1:42:52] embedded in you
[1:42:54] becomes a part of you then
[1:42:56] you don't have to worry about
[1:42:59] muddling about with
[1:43:01] doubt or confusion or any of that
[1:43:04] it's the purity of the word and god
[1:43:05] reveals it to you
[1:43:07] amen must not
[1:43:09] misinterpret we must not mislocate we
[1:43:12] must not displace the word yes amen
[1:43:15] those are three musts and studying the
[1:43:17] scripture
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:20] don't just read a quote
[1:43:22] i i got a revelation make sure that word
[1:43:25] fits with the make sure that quote fits
[1:43:27] within the scripture the way that you
[1:43:29] see it it fits in the scripture i
[1:43:31] promise you that but the way you see it
[1:43:34] amen make sure that it fits the way you
[1:43:37] and it'll go all perfect make that
[1:43:40] perfect picture and it'll be jesus
[1:43:41] christ
[1:43:43] amen the perfect picture of jesus christ
[1:43:46] amen let's stand if we could
[1:44:00] well i said it was going to be shorter
[1:44:01] last week but i don't think it really
[1:44:02] was
[1:44:06] god knows amen yes praise the lord god
[1:44:09] knows
[1:44:10] praise the lord listening is little
[1:44:12] course
[1:44:13] amen to him
[1:44:15] to be like jesus
[1:44:17] and to be like jesus
[1:44:20] purity of god's word
[1:44:22] it's got to be handled
[1:44:24] with respect reverence
[1:44:26] it's got to be handled
[1:44:28] with the hands of
[1:44:30] god
[1:44:32] red
[1:44:33] in the context in which it was written
[1:44:35] by the holy spirit
[1:44:37] the holy spirit's not prevalent
[1:44:40] in you
[1:44:41] you are born again
[1:44:44] and that's the number one thing
[1:44:47] born again
[1:44:48] you must be born again
[1:44:51] praise the lord that's the only way we
[1:44:53] can be like jesus
[1:44:55] to be born again
[1:44:56] be like the word
[1:44:58] people see you they'll know there's
[1:44:59] something different
[1:45:01] i noticed when i went on this job
[1:45:03] people looked at me differently
[1:45:06] it's inevitable i expected it
[1:45:09] when they're around me they talked
[1:45:11] different
[1:45:12] because i could overhear them when
[1:45:13] they're over there talking to each other
[1:45:15] you know
[1:45:16] and some explicits and things not no
[1:45:19] not like some i've heard but but when
[1:45:21] they get around me then everything
[1:45:23] changes
[1:45:24] and you know there's something there
[1:45:26] there's a reason for that there's a
[1:45:28] spirit there's an atmosphere
[1:45:30] they know it they might not understand
[1:45:32] it they know it
[1:45:33] they know it
[1:45:35] let's be like jesus amen

[1:49:53] do you want to get you going i don't
[1:49:56] know you all get something out of that
[1:49:58] where you get what you wanna the bible
[1:50:00] the lord
[1:50:01] takes me through the bible with pieces
[1:50:03] of journal
[1:50:04] but um
[1:50:07] there was a
[1:50:10] about
[1:50:12] esau
[1:50:14] and uh
[1:50:15] so i just wonder why you know that
[1:50:18] why do the why do the arabs hate
[1:50:21] the jews so much today you know
[1:50:24] well
[1:50:25] it's esau's fault but
[1:50:27] uh
[1:50:28] esau became edom
[1:50:30] and edom was the
[1:50:33] and uh
[1:50:35] david and his officers and the kings and
[1:50:39] things that are they
[1:50:40] they annihilated the
[1:50:44] and so there are no more
[1:50:46] that's why the arabs are
[1:50:49] afraid of the israelites they know that
[1:50:51] israelites god
[1:50:52] can eliminate them
[1:50:54] right
[1:50:55] and he will someday or he said he would
[1:50:57] you know it's
[1:50:59] everyone that's not a believer yeah is
[1:51:02] going to be
[1:51:03] gone into the
[1:51:05] fear of forgetting amen yes it was just
[1:51:08] interesting so i looked online to see
[1:51:11] you know how many other people were
[1:51:13] studying the same thing
[1:51:15] oh there's been so many books written on
[1:51:18] there all down through

[1:51:22] all similar stuff it's just there's a
[1:51:24] lot of information

[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:52] praise the lord joel asked me that
[1:51:54] question the other day
[1:51:56] about
[1:51:57] why when israel came over and these
[1:52:00] people just scattered
[1:52:02] and i said well they had already heard
[1:52:05] that how israel annihilated these other
[1:52:07] people and they didn't want to be like
[1:52:09] them right
[1:52:11] so many times come up and you cannot
[1:52:13] deny
[1:52:14] there's something supernatural about
[1:52:16] those people
[1:52:17] you can't deny it and you can't fight
[1:52:19] against it
[1:52:21] i told him i said so they ran for
[1:52:23] self-preservation
[1:52:24] because they had heard and they knew
[1:52:26] that god was with them
[1:52:28] amen so praise the lord that's the truth
[1:52:32] amen to god bless you amen amen
