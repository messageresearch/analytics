[19:03] Jesus with grateful Hearts knowing that
[19:06] by your grace you look for us and
[19:09] brought your Plan of Salvation into our
[19:13] hearts Lord and it's all by Grace gra
[19:16] you sa us your grace will keep us and
[19:19] your grace will Jes take us home we're
[19:23] living in the hour father where the enem
[19:26] is fighting us harder than ever before
[19:30] and Lord It's like you said to Israel
[19:32] one time I have stretched out my hands
[19:36] oh yes to uh uh disobedient and gang
[19:40] people amen and Lord that's what you're
[19:42] doing with your bride right now Lord
[19:45] you're stretching out you're calling us
[19:48] to get right with you to stay with your
[19:52] word to have a life that is pleasing in
[19:56] your side worthy of your gospel and
[19:59] father there's so many that I believe
[20:02] had haven't fully waken up Lord you gave
[20:06] us a lesson about those 10 virgins yes
[20:10] five were wise and five were foolish the
[20:13] wise had their oil had that Holy Spirit
[20:16] Born Again
[20:18] experience and they were always keeping
[20:22] their walk with you in line with your
[20:26] word staying away from the world Amen
[20:28] staying away from the things that'll
[20:30] hinder him in their walk with you and
[20:33] then there was the foolish father the
[20:37] foolish they they look good they might
[20:41] quote the word quote the message but
[20:44] father there's something in their heart
[20:47] that stops them from fully lining up
[20:50] with your word they lack that Born Again
[20:53] experience father that's why it's a
[20:56] struggle to come to church that's a
[20:59] struggle to pray
[21:01] sincerely one for another it's a
[21:05] struggle father to pay our ties it's a
[21:09] struggle to truly lift one another in
[21:14] encouragement in love in whatever it
[21:18] takes to be a real Christian yes Lord
[21:20] Jesus and Lord help us to get away from
[21:24] all
[21:25] carnality all things of the flesh
[21:29] it's like Paul said the things that I
[21:31] want to do I don't do it the things I
[21:34] know I shouldn't be doing I do father
[21:38] it's it's that flesh that fights us
[21:41] every time Jesus and there's a time that
[21:45] as you you taught us in your word about
[21:48] this late and SE Church age they blind
[21:52] miserable naked wretched and don't even
[21:55] know it yes there's blindness that's h
[21:59] amongst uh the believer this day they're
[22:03] blind they can constantly hear the word
[22:05] and the word Goes Forth to uh teach him
[22:09] what's right to teach him what it takes
[22:12] to be in full obedience to your word but
[22:15] that blindness is stopping them from
[22:18] lining up to your word oh Lord help us
[22:22] to not be in that condition at any time
[22:27] if we don't wake up we refuse to line up
[22:30] with your word we're going to find
[22:32] ourselves in that Great Tribulation
[22:35] Jesus we're going to find ourselves
[22:38] seeking you when your Holy Spirit has
[22:41] left the Gentiles and gone back to the
[22:45] Jew oh Lord we want to truly live your
[22:50] life and What It Is What It Takes it's
[22:52] like Paul says I Die daily brother Brown
[22:55] said my worst enemy is William Brown it
[22:58] takes for us to die to ourselves die to
[23:00] our thinking and be out of the way that
[23:03] your Holy Spirit may have pre
[23:06] preeminence and work through US Lord

[34:31] for this time we commit it to you in the
[34:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[34:35] amen amen 2
[34:38] Corinthians we're going to read CH uh 2
[34:41] Corinthians 10 and verse 5 2 Corinthians
[34:46] 105 casting down imaginations and every
[34:49] High thing that exalted itself against
[34:51] the knowledge of God and bringeth into
[34:54] captivity every thought to the ob
[34:57] Obedience of Christ amen you can be
[35:00] seated if You'
[35:02] like amen it's a way to live a
[35:05] Victorious life amen we've read through
[35:07] the scripture many times we have not
[35:09] brought necessarily any out to during
[35:12] this study but uh we we've known that
[35:15] there's been god- calleded men there's
[35:17] been gifted men there's been gifted
[35:19] people through the scripture that have
[35:22] had gifts that have had callings uh that
[35:24] have been handpicked by God that went
[35:28] astray uh they they didn't necessarily
[35:33] lose their inheritance but they lost
[35:34] their Victory amen a lot of times today
[35:37] people end up in that situation uh
[35:40] brother Dennis talking about uh sister
[35:42] Lydia's sister and uh many people they
[35:45] may have gotten the victory they may
[35:47] have gotten themselves uh into the hands
[35:50] of the Lord and they may have given
[35:52] themselves to God and and brought him
[35:54] and claimed him as their lord and savior
[35:56] and maybe even back baptized in the name
[35:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh maybe
[36:01] maybe even filled with the Holy Ghost
[36:04] amen but it's to whom you yield your
[36:06] members is to what victory you have or
[36:09] don't have yes amen amen uh Saul was
[36:13] handpick and chose by God God told
[36:16] Samuel go pick Saul Saul is the guy he's
[36:20] the one I want when you see where Saul
[36:22] went amen he didn't lose his inheritance
[36:26] he didn't lose his place
[36:28] because when the witch of Endor called
[36:31] Samuel up from the grave Samuel's
[36:34] prophecy was that you saw and your sons
[36:39] will be with me this time tomorrow I
[36:41] believe that's right
[36:43] tomorrow so and and I don't believe
[36:46] Samuel didn't lose his his placement so
[36:49] if Saul was going to be with Samuel and
[36:52] Samuel was with the Lord uh by
[36:55] transverse property Saul was going to be
[36:57] with the Lord yes so it wasn't that Saul
[37:00] lost his inheritance if you will but he
[37:03] lost his victory yes because he began to
[37:06] live by the dictates of his mind of what
[37:08] he thought was best of what he thought
[37:11] would be a better way of doing something
[37:12] of his ways of his thoughts and that's
[37:15] where we get tripped up so many times
[37:17] that we don't obey this scripture that
[37:20] tells us to bring every thought into
[37:23] captivity to The Obedience of the word
[37:26] amen when you bring every thought into
[37:29] captivity in obedience to the word and
[37:32] you yield your members to that you will
[37:36] live in Victory amen you will live a
[37:39] Victorious Life yeah because your
[37:41] members your body your self your mind
[37:44] will be yielded to God the victory will
[37:47] be there inherently simply because of
[37:51] The Obedience of God's word amen so it
[37:54] depends the way to live a Victorious
[37:57] life not live a Victorious Life it's up
[38:00] to the individual amen it's our choice
[38:03] we can choose to or not to it depends on
[38:05] us amen but there's a way to live the
[38:08] Victorious Life and yes you you
[38:12] can real quick you can have you can have
[38:16] the Holy Ghost and you still will can
[38:18] yield your members to things that you
[38:21] know you shouldn't do or or ways you
[38:24] shouldn't go amen now obviously
[38:28] uh the Lord has his way to bring things
[38:30] back to where they should be and that's
[38:32] where forgiveness comes and repentance
[38:35] comes and making things right comes and
[38:38] uh a person can backslid and still be in
[38:41] the hands of God remember the prodical
[38:43] son was never not a son no matter what
[38:46] he did no matter where he went no matter
[38:48] what he did no matter what how he uh
[38:51] conducted his life he was always a
[38:54] son he was always a son you're son of
[38:57] God you've always been always will be
[39:00] son or daughter of God no matter which
[39:04] uh uh uh rout I remember one time
[39:06] brother random telling a story about uh
[39:08] a guy that I I can't remember the
[39:10] circumstances of the story but he got
[39:13] off and he backslid and he was going
[39:15] just down a dark dark path and and the
[39:20] man uh drowned and died and the Lord and
[39:24] and if I remember right brother Bram
[39:26] said the Lord was merciful to the man
[39:28] because he was going down such a dark
[39:30] path God took him before he got too far
[39:34] yes amen I believe those were the words
[39:36] he even used before he got too far God
[39:39] took him amen but that's why God that's
[39:42] why the Lord died and shed his blood and
[39:45] gave us Redemption and gave us
[39:46] forgiveness and gave us grace and mercy
[39:49] now we don't take the grace of God and
[39:51] make a disgrace out of it absolutely not
[39:54] amen but there's a way there's there's a
[39:56] life us to live that is in Victory the
[39:59] victory of yielding our members to the
[40:01] Lord Jesus now let's go over to
[40:04] Philippians speaking of the scripture
[40:07] brother Dennis and quoted Philippians
[40:08] chapter
[40:12] 2 Philippians chapter 2 let's begin in
[40:16] Reading with verse
[40:18] one amen Philippians chapter 2 verse one
[40:27] praise the Lord if there be therefore
[40:31] any consolation in
[40:33] Christ any
[40:36] consoling if any comfort of love if any
[40:40] Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels
[40:44] and mercies that's Tender Mercies that's
[40:47] from as we would call it today the heart
[40:51] amen but he's talking about the very
[40:53] most inwardness of a person their bowel
[40:56] amen and
[40:58] mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[41:03] likeminded so the joy that he's speaking
[41:05] of here is for the people to be
[41:08] likeminded amen likeminded having the
[41:11] same love being of one Accord of one
[41:16] mind now remember what brings contention
[41:20] pride pride bringeth contention how does
[41:23] pride boil up in a person when a person
[41:27] thinks that they are better than the
[41:29] next person right they become puffed up
[41:32] and prideful I know more than you I'm
[41:34] smarter than you I'm better than you I'm
[41:37] higher than you I'm greater than you I
[41:39] got a better position I got a bigger
[41:42] house I got a nicer car I got a bigger
[41:44] bank account I got a better job whatever
[41:47] it is it swells up a person in their
[41:50] Spirit into a place of Pride and pride
[41:53] is what brings contention right that's
[41:55] why Paul's saying here fulfill ye my joy
[41:58] and be
[41:59] likeminded so in that case there's
[42:01] nobody cuz remember in the sunship of
[42:04] Jesus Christ there is no big eyes and
[42:06] little yous there is no preferential
[42:08] treatment one over the other it don't
[42:11] matter what place they held when they
[42:12] were here on Earth or what gifts they
[42:14] did or did not have in the sunship of
[42:18] Jesus Christ we are all the same yes
[42:20] we're all on the same level he's talking
[42:23] about here bringing that reality into
[42:26] our life lives in our Humanity our
[42:28] carnality in this life before we get to
[42:32] the other side be
[42:35] likeminded having the same love the Same
[42:38] Love could you imagine what this world
[42:40] would be like if no one was prideful no
[42:43] one was boastful even even the greatest
[42:46] remember brother bam said the greatest
[42:48] leader would be a benevolent
[42:51] dictator amen we love our democracy and
[42:54] of course in this world it it probably
[42:56] works as good as any but um but the best
[43:01] government would be that that's Ran by A
[43:04] benevolent
[43:06] dictator and basically what he's saying
[43:08] is that the best one would be the one
[43:10] that God runs because God is a
[43:12] benevolent dictator you know what
[43:15] benevolent benevolent means that the
[43:17] person that's ruling over you has
[43:19] nothing but your best interest and his
[43:22] heart amen amen he wants nothing but the
[43:25] best for you that's what someone
[43:27] unconditionally loves benevolent they
[43:31] they put you first even though they're
[43:32] the ones in charge they put you first
[43:35] praise the Lord a benevolent dictator is
[43:38] one that's going to do everything they
[43:40] can to make it better not for themselves
[43:44] but for their subjects for the people
[43:46] around them see that's humility a
[43:49] benevolent dictator isone who is humble
[43:52] it's one who doesn't consider themselves
[43:55] above everybody even though they are or
[43:57] better let's just say better than
[43:59] anybody else amen but of the same ey
[44:02] could you imagine what this world would
[44:03] be like today if everybody was in that
[44:06] position if everybody was in that place
[44:09] of all the people of all the thoughts of
[44:12] all the ideas of all the creations of
[44:14] all the inventions of all the religions
[44:16] of all the gods of all the everything if
[44:19] everybody had this in one
[44:22] mind the likeminded of the same love
[44:26] being a one Accord you imagine what it
[44:29] would be like well it would be Utopia
[44:31] right it would be like the place we're
[44:34] going to yes it would be like heaven
[44:38] praise God because that's the way
[44:39] Heaven's going to be amen Paul's saying
[44:43] fulfill my joy that all ye now he's
[44:44] talking to a selected group I'm just
[44:46] saying if the whole world was like that
[44:48] could you imagine could you imagine if
[44:50] just the City of Tucson was like that
[44:53] amongst message
[44:54] Believers what this city would be like
[44:57] this city would be turned upside down
[44:58] Saints it wouldn't know what to do with
[45:00] itself amen amen I I believe you imagine
[45:05] and think if the country was like that
[45:08] if the world was like that my mind what
[45:11] would it be but that's what he's saying
[45:13] that's the joy that it would give to him
[45:16] amen I can't think of one of the one of
[45:19] the greatest joys in my opinion I
[45:22] believe my wife shared that with me but
[45:24] as we were growing up and as we had
[45:26] children one of the greatest Joys that
[45:27] we had in our life was watching our two
[45:30] children play together enjoy one
[45:32] another's company have fun together
[45:35] laughing and enjoying and playing and
[45:38] having fun and being brother and sister
[45:40] that was one of the greatest Joys amen
[45:43] one of the worst Thorns was watching
[45:46] them
[45:48] fight so you can imagine if you put
[45:51] yourself in that position what Paul's
[45:52] talking about he's talking about his
[45:56] children that he birth forth into Christ
[45:58] if they were likeminded loving one
[46:00] another with the same love feeling the
[46:03] same way about everyone it's the same
[46:05] thing and some people say well that's
[46:06] just you know sit down and no it's the
[46:10] spirit of God Amen that can bring us
[46:13] into that capacity because he goes on to
[46:16] say this being of one Accord of one mind
[46:21] amen amen being of one mind praise the
[46:25] Lord let nothing here we go now let
[46:28] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[46:31] Glory
[46:33] pridefulness nothing be done through
[46:36] Strife or vain Glory but in liness of
[46:40] what the
[46:42] mind the mind in the liness of of the
[46:45] mind so yes there is a place of a
[46:48] humility in the
[46:50] mind of a of of a lowering
[46:55] of what we would say the the pride is
[46:58] that we would have uh my th and no more
[47:03] or as it is it seems like today me and
[47:05] nobody else it's not even four anymore
[47:08] it's just that person they don't care as
[47:10] long as they get that parking space they
[47:12] don't care you've been sitting there 10
[47:14] minutes waiting for it as long as they
[47:16] get that light they don't care if they
[47:18] run over you as long as they're getting
[47:20] through the life
[47:22] amen they don't care if they go 40 m
[47:25] hour of the speed minute as long as
[47:27] they're in front of you they don't care
[47:30] cuz they're first and they're going to
[47:32] be first and nothing else matters their
[47:35] time their place their mind their
[47:37] thought that's all that matters it seems
[47:39] like that's becoming very prevalent in
[47:41] the world today yeah but this helps us
[47:44] understand don't do anything to strive
[47:46] for vain glory to Puff me up or to lift
[47:49] me up amen what we don't we don't do
[47:52] this to try to make a name for ourselves
[47:55] amen we don't do this this to for great
[47:57] wealth or to become popular or anything
[48:00] vain Glory no we do it because we want
[48:03] to help one another we do it to increase
[48:06] the body of Christ in liness humility of
[48:11] Mind Let each esteem other better than
[48:16] themselves that's what a benevolent
[48:18] dictator does amen and if we as the
[48:22] subjects of a benevolent dictator God if
[48:26] we have the
[48:28] likeminded of him of one another then
[48:32] we're going to do and live as he does
[48:34] and lives and that is putting us before
[48:37] himself putting us first he's always
[48:40] done that if God did not put us first
[48:43] friends we would have no hope yes we
[48:45] would be lost dying going to
[48:48] hell if the first time they come up and
[48:50] say well if they're not going to accept
[48:52] me they're done amen you sealed your
[48:56] faith that's not God right cuz he knows
[48:59] that's not what's best for his children
[49:01] he loves
[49:02] you he loves you UNC not just loves you
[49:06] he loves you
[49:08] unconditionally amen
[49:10] so he esteems you better than
[49:15] himself how did he prove that he went to
[49:18] Calvary he didn't have to he didn't do
[49:21] anything wrong he wasn't going there for
[49:24] himself he wasn't sinful he didn't
[49:27] commit a sin he didn't have a wrong
[49:30] thought but yet he died the most cruel
[49:33] death that humans ever died why because
[49:36] he put you first yes not himself but you
[49:39] yes you think that was something that
[49:41] made him somebody no he didn't do it to
[49:45] go through all because of he did it for
[49:47] you esteem other better than himself so
[49:52] now what's he telling us to do the exact
[49:54] same thing amen to esteem others better
[50:00] than ourselves putting our brothers
[50:02] first putting our sisters first loving
[50:05] amen unconditionally as he does to us
[50:08] it's just a matter of that being our
[50:13] influence for a life to be lived through
[50:15] us to everyone else to others Este
[50:18] seeing other better than themselves amen
[50:22] Jesus did that it reminds me
[50:25] of it reminds me of brother green story
[50:27] brother
[50:29] brandom uh I think I've told y'all this
[50:32] story before when I came out I was uh
[50:37] just freshly hadn't even been pastoring
[50:39] for a year in Florida and we decided to
[50:42] come out for the convention in December
[50:44] and brother green started giving some
[50:46] testimonies and stories that it
[50:47] quickened to me uh that uh well well I
[50:52] satting there on the Pew the Lord said
[50:54] he's going to call you to preach
[50:55] tomorrow night cuz it was that it was
[50:57] that convention where brother green said
[50:59] if you're a minister be prepared he said
[51:02] I I'm not giving you any notice he said
[51:05] I'm going to I'm going to call you out
[51:06] and point at you and you better be ready
[51:08] to
[51:09] preach and I was a nobody from Florida
[51:12] that pastored as many people sitting
[51:14] here today I wasn't anything important I
[51:17] wasn't anything special I'd never even
[51:19] met brother green before I met him a
[51:22] couple days when we got here so he knew
[51:25] who I was but I didn't never met him
[51:27] before he didn't know who I
[51:29] was but the spirit of the Lord spoke to
[51:31] me and said I sat there with my mom he
[51:34] said he's going to call you to preach
[51:36] tomorrow
[51:37] night and I said oh my what do I do and
[51:41] I'm you know in myself I'm sitting here
[51:42] Lord what do I do I I I don't I don't I
[51:45] don't know what to say I mean I I got
[51:48] books full of messages but that I I
[51:51] don't I don't preach because I got books
[51:53] full of messages I preach what the Lord
[51:55] puts on my heart what whatever it is if
[51:58] it's if it is the first sermon out of a
[52:02] brand new
[52:04] book
[52:05] today or it's something that the Lord's
[52:08] given me before I only would preach what
[52:10] the Lord gives me I didn't have anything
[52:12] honestly had nothing and so brother
[52:15] green started talking about his
[52:18] experiences with brother brandom and the
[52:20] things that he did and remember you all
[52:22] remember the dart
[52:24] story brother green said that uh he sat
[52:27] over and watched brother brandom and
[52:29] brother brandom just he'd hit the Bull's
[52:31] Eye every time just in true brother
[52:34] Brandon fashion hit the bullseye the
[52:36] darts every time every Dart he threw hit
[52:39] hit the Bull's Eye brother green sitting
[52:41] there watched him and he went up and
[52:42] challenged him said let's let's play a
[52:45] game brother brother brandom he said
[52:47] okay sure we'll play we'll play a game
[52:49] we'll play the 21 whatever it is he said
[52:52] okay so brother green and of course
[52:54] brother Bram said you go first brother
[52:55] Perry brother green go D he throws a
[52:58] four and brother random gets up there
[53:00] and he throws a five or a three or how
[53:02] do you score darts is it low or high
[53:04] anyway I don't remember but he threw one
[53:07] and the brother brandom's Dart was worse
[53:09] than brother Green's brother brother
[53:12] green got up there he threw another you
[53:14] get three darts he threw another one
[53:16] there a 10 brother brandom gets up there
[53:19] and he throws one that's
[53:21] worse and brother green is just
[53:24] mystified so brother green this is his
[53:27] testimony he did his third and last Dart
[53:29] he throws it completely off the board he
[53:31] just threw it over somewhere he said
[53:33] brother Brown did the exact same thing
[53:36] didn't even hit the board with the darts
[53:38] man had just put however many darts
[53:40] right in the center of that board
[53:42] couldn't even hit the board now and
[53:45] brother green says I don't understand
[53:46] brother B said what what are you talking
[53:48] about brother per he said I sat over
[53:50] there for whatever time it was watching
[53:52] you throw these darts and you hit the
[53:53] bullseye every single time he said I get
[53:56] up there and I play with you you can't
[53:58] even hit the board he said what what is
[54:00] the problem he said so well brother
[54:02] green that's simple he said if there's
[54:04] any joy in winning why don't I let you
[54:06] enjoy it he said I know what I can do I
[54:10] can he knew he knew he can hit the
[54:13] Bull's Eye every time if you wanted to
[54:14] he said but if there's any joy in
[54:15] winning why don't I let you enjoy it
[54:19] that's esteeming other better than
[54:21] themselves and that's when God quickened
[54:23] the message to me that I was going to
[54:25] preach night and when I came up there I
[54:28] knew exactly what the Lord wanted me to
[54:30] say Amen
[54:33] now what happened during that service
[54:35] that's up to the Lord but I did what I
[54:37] felt the Lord had me to do that was
[54:40] esteeming other better than
[54:43] themselves Jesus Christ did it when he
[54:46] showed himself when he went to
[54:48] Calvary and every believer if we look at
[54:51] this and we believe this word the way it
[54:53] says amen now I'm not saying I'm said I
[54:56] preach this before and I've gone and had
[54:59] people and they have a little simple
[55:02] teenagers volleyball game or something
[55:04] and I said I'm not I'm not telling you
[55:06] to purposely throw the volleyball game
[55:09] you know hit the ball over the net you
[55:11] know see what happens I'm not saying
[55:13] purposely lose brother brandham did that
[55:16] with brother green and just just played
[55:17] the game so everybody was asking me well
[55:20] should we lose purposely no that's not
[55:23] the point amen it had the the the point
[55:26] is esteeming other better than
[55:28] themselves amen amen and that and uh and
[55:33] that's just a simple game that they
[55:35] played to to do such so but esteeming
[55:38] other better than themselves with the
[55:40] humbleness of Mind esteeming other
[55:43] better than themselves if you want to do
[55:46] anything in this life in this world
[55:49] especially now that is the most contrary
[55:52] thing amen I know we look different I
[55:55] know we look
[55:56] I know uh people think you're crazy nuts
[55:59] whatever it is the the the
[56:03] most separative thing you can do in the
[56:07] world
[56:08] today that would be as contrary to the
[56:11] world standards today is esteeming
[56:14] others better than yourself right
[56:16] because that's absolutely the opposite
[56:18] contous I see sisters with long hair and
[56:21] dresses there's plenty of women out
[56:23] there that have long hair and wear
[56:24] dresses I see them all the time
[56:26] that doesn't make him a Believer amen
[56:29] that doesn't make them
[56:31] Christians but if you esteem other
[56:33] better than themselves that's something
[56:35] the world does not do that is completely
[56:39] contrary to the devil and everything he
[56:42] espouses and lives through through
[56:45] people his subjects today esteeming
[56:48] other better than themselves that's a
[56:50] that is a victory that
[56:53] is beyond anything else
[56:57] amen you ever heard that you ever heard
[56:59] you have a Harden phrase It's better to
[57:01] give than receive you don't hardly hear
[57:03] that anymore because most people don't
[57:04] believe that they'd rather get than give
[57:08] but it's the truth it's more blessed is
[57:10] it to give than to receive well it's the
[57:13] same thing you're you're esteeming
[57:15] others better than yourselves you want
[57:18] more for them than you do for yourself
[57:21] amen I'm content look Saints Paul said
[57:24] wherever you find yourself whatever
[57:26] state you find yourself in to be there
[57:29] with content amen that doesn't mean you
[57:32] just become a bum and don't do anything
[57:35] no it means that what lot that the Lord
[57:37] has given you through the labor of your
[57:40] hands be happy be content thank God God
[57:44] has blessed me God has saved me God has
[57:47] provided for me God is here for me I'm
[57:51] content with what the Lord's GI me
[57:54] amen content
[57:56] is great gain if we will accept it and
[58:00] if we stay in that place of contentment
[58:02] we don't worry about what the other
[58:05] person has or what the other person does
[58:08] because I'm happy where I am I'm happy
[58:11] who I am I'm happy what the Lord's given
[58:13] me I'm content with what God has done
[58:15] for me I thank God that he's given me a
[58:18] place to live it might not be the $10
[58:20] million mansion on the hillside over
[58:22] here although I might have one of those
[58:25] waiting for me anyway
[58:26] uh it might not be up there but I have a
[58:29] place to live and I'm happy I'm thankful
[58:33] amen this place right here might not be
[58:35] the tajma hall it might not be the
[58:38] 30,000 seat place that some Churches in
[58:41] this country have but it's very
[58:45] humble and I thank God every time for it
[58:49] yes amen when I come in here and I pray
[58:52] in the morning I thank God for giving us
[58:54] this place yes amen
[58:57] if it come a time where this wasn't
[59:00] working anymore he'd have another place
[59:03] whatever it is but I thank him that he's
[59:05] given it for us amen we might have
[59:08] glitches in our equipment we might have
[59:10] things happen uh there might only be a
[59:13] handful of a show up but God has blessed
[59:16] us with it and I'm thankful amen content
[59:19] yes content if you're content you don't
[59:21] worry about what the other guy's doing
[59:23] or what the other guy's got or how many
[59:26] people's in his church or how great the
[59:29] whatever it is you know you don't worry
[59:31] about that's that's not a consideration
[59:33] that comes in your mind because that
[59:36] that will bring contentment and that
[59:38] will that will breing pridefulness and
[59:40] contentment amen and that is not or U
[59:45] not contentment that will that will
[59:47] breed pride and contention that's what
[59:49] I'm trying to say that will bring
[59:51] contention not contentment amen then
[59:54] contention then will bring bring a
[59:56] division between people and then you
[59:59] you've got the world like we have today
[1:00:01] just or the country just divided right
[1:00:04] straight basically down the middle and
[1:00:06] both sides hate each other amen when it
[1:00:10] seems like that the normal human just
[1:00:13] wants to be happy and live a happy good
[1:00:16] healthy life
[1:00:18] right amen amen steeming other better
[1:00:22] than
[1:00:23] themselves look not every man for verse
[1:00:26] on his own things but every man also on
[1:00:29] the things of
[1:00:30] others let this mind amen he's
[1:00:34] describing that that this mind what that
[1:00:37] mind of loneliness that that mind of
[1:00:40] esteeming other better than themselves
[1:00:41] let this mind be in
[1:00:44] you which was also look now which was
[1:00:50] also in Christ Jesus praise the Lord now
[1:00:55] it's telling us to have the mind of
[1:00:58] Christ that mind of Christ will bring
[1:01:01] you to that place amen because it'll
[1:01:04] obey 2 Corinthians 10 for we bring every
[1:01:08] thought into captivity to The Obedience
[1:01:10] of Christ the word amen who being now
[1:01:15] who Jesus Christ who being in the form
[1:01:17] of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:01:21] equal with God form we know we said many
[1:01:24] times that word form means inm Mor
[1:01:26] amen he morph himself as God did people
[1:01:31] want to say there's so many gods how
[1:01:33] many gods there one God morphing himself
[1:01:36] well what did he do he morphed himself
[1:01:38] he's the father morphed himself he's he
[1:01:40] is the son he is the holy spirit God
[1:01:43] morphing himself God who Jesus Christ
[1:01:47] being in the form the EM morha of God
[1:01:51] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:01:53] God now the problem the Satan had the
[1:01:56] problem that Lucifer had is that his
[1:01:59] desire was to be exalted above God right
[1:02:03] Amen to be the object of worship instead
[1:02:06] of God that was his
[1:02:09] problem Jesus being in the form of God
[1:02:14] thought it not robbery to be equal it
[1:02:16] didn't take anything from God Amen so
[1:02:20] when you when we as Christians act Godly
[1:02:24] and live Christian lives live Godly
[1:02:27] lives that's not detracting from God
[1:02:31] that's adding to God that's bringing God
[1:02:35] in a place to where he has people
[1:02:37] through his benevolent dictatorship that
[1:02:40] that love him so much that they want to
[1:02:43] do everything and in every way like he
[1:02:47] does Amen that doesn't detract from God
[1:02:51] being in the form of God does not take
[1:02:54] away from God
[1:02:56] amen that being you say it
[1:02:59] says robbery to be equal with God Amen
[1:03:03] well in in in the Garden of Eden what
[1:03:06] did God what's one of the first things
[1:03:08] God did in the Garden of Eden he put a
[1:03:11] man in there and he said subdue it you
[1:03:16] are the God of this
[1:03:18] Earth if you want that tree moved just
[1:03:21] tell it to move if you want that animal
[1:03:24] to be a lion just tell it
[1:03:27] whatever it is that you are the god of
[1:03:29] the earth that's one of the first things
[1:03:31] God did was to put a man down here and
[1:03:34] put him in complete control over this
[1:03:36] Earth that's what he did so how is it
[1:03:41] robbery for today for us to be
[1:03:44] Christians for us to be Christlike for
[1:03:46] us to be Godly examples for us to live a
[1:03:50] life that's obedient to the word that's
[1:03:53] not taking away from God that's add
[1:03:55] that's adding to God that's showing
[1:03:58] that's showing more and more of God's
[1:04:02] omnipotence amen but it where was it
[1:04:07] now let this mind be in you which was in
[1:04:11] Christ Jesus Christ Jesus thought it not
[1:04:14] Rob to be equal with God in the form of
[1:04:16] God what does it do to us what does it
[1:04:19] do for
[1:04:20] us but made himself of no
[1:04:23] reputation and took upon on him the form
[1:04:27] of a servant again that word form is a
[1:04:30] morha took upon himself the form of a
[1:04:33] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:04:36] men the likeness of men though he was
[1:04:39] yet still God made in the likeness of
[1:04:42] man he looked just like us amen hands
[1:04:45] feet toes amen being found in fashion as
[1:04:48] a man he humbled himself praise God he
[1:04:53] humbled himself and became OB obedient
[1:04:56] unto death even the death of the Cross
[1:04:59] and as we said before he didn't do that
[1:05:01] for himself he didn't do that because he
[1:05:03] had to he didn't do it because he wanted
[1:05:05] to necessarily himself in the flesh yeah
[1:05:09] right but he esteemed you above
[1:05:13] himself amen not my will but thine be
[1:05:17] done that's the Cry of every
[1:05:19] believer wherefore God also has highly
[1:05:22] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:05:25] is above every name that at the name of
[1:05:27] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[1:05:31] heaven and things in Earth and things
[1:05:32] under the Earth and that every tongue
[1:05:34] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:05:38] to the glory of God the Father amen God
[1:05:42] esteemed him in that position the
[1:05:45] victory the victory now that we were
[1:05:48] talking about before the victory of
[1:05:54] likeminded comes from the
[1:05:56] humility amen of the Mind comes from the
[1:05:59] loneliness and the humility of having
[1:06:02] the mind of Christ the mind of Christ
[1:06:04] took him to
[1:06:06] Calvary in the form of a servant who
[1:06:09] wants to be a servant who
[1:06:12] who nobody wants to be a servant
[1:06:15] everybody wants to be the king everybody
[1:06:17] wants to be in chared everyone wants to
[1:06:19] be the ruler I know sometimes I go on
[1:06:22] the job and somebody will look over here
[1:06:24] and say well how are things going why
[1:06:25] it's not going very well why is that we
[1:06:27] got too many chiefs and not enough
[1:06:28] Indians cuz everybody wants to be the
[1:06:31] boss everybody wants to do it their way
[1:06:33] everybody thinks they have a better idea
[1:06:35] or a better way of doing it amen
[1:06:38] just do it the way the blueprint
[1:06:43] says amen do it the way the blueprint
[1:06:47] says amen it's that simple the man who's
[1:06:51] really in charge is the one who wrote
[1:06:53] The Blueprint amen just do what it says
[1:06:57] amen then we're all Indians at that
[1:07:00] point if you will excuse the expression
[1:07:02] we're all obedian all servants if you
[1:07:05] will we're all the ones that that serve
[1:07:07] the Lord and it and it comes from that
[1:07:11] the victory comes of the loneliness
[1:07:16] humility amen Victory comes through
[1:07:19] humility let's go over to Romans chapter
[1:07:21] 8
[1:07:28] read you a quote as you're going over
[1:07:30] look at
[1:07:31] that we're going to go to Romans 8 but
[1:07:34] look at
[1:07:36] this while you're looking did you ever
[1:07:39] see
[1:07:41] people this me and my wife have talked
[1:07:43] about this so so many times and when I
[1:07:47] saw this and I was doing some research
[1:07:49] thought I just I just got to read that
[1:07:52] did you ever see people looking at he
[1:07:54] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:07:55] today and forever
[1:07:57] 1961 did you ever see people that you
[1:08:00] love to be around you love to be around
[1:08:03] them you and my me and my wife said that
[1:08:05] so many times about sometimes when you
[1:08:07] go places and message churches and you
[1:08:09] think well the person doesn't
[1:08:12] necessarily seem to be at all interested
[1:08:14] in trying to live the life or or really
[1:08:18] even as we would know be a Christian but
[1:08:21] they come and they're there and they're
[1:08:24] in service
[1:08:26] I me I know it seemed like a lot in
[1:08:27] Tucson we don't get that here but in
[1:08:29] Tabernacle it seemed to be quite often
[1:08:31] and we think why why would people come
[1:08:33] well look brother R said they're just
[1:08:35] people that you just love to be around
[1:08:37] some people come because they they feel
[1:08:39] they love to feel the spirit they feel
[1:08:41] when they come to that place they love
[1:08:44] to feel the the atmosphere that they're
[1:08:47] around amen you know a lot of times
[1:08:53] uh you know a person
[1:08:56] think about a couple of the guys on my
[1:08:58] team a person can go to a bar or or go
[1:09:01] to a store and think about all the
[1:09:03] alcohol they want they about any any
[1:09:08] alcohol that they want beer liquor
[1:09:09] whatever it is they can buy as much as
[1:09:11] they won't go home and drink
[1:09:12] it but bars are one of the most popular
[1:09:15] places that we have on this in this
[1:09:17] country why are bars so popular amen I
[1:09:22] mean say well there's people around well
[1:09:24] have those people come to your house
[1:09:26] I guarantee well I don't have any idea I
[1:09:28] would assume that the that the liquor at
[1:09:31] a bar is a lot more expensive than you
[1:09:33] can get the grocery
[1:09:34] store just invite people to come to your
[1:09:36] house then why do they go to a bar it's
[1:09:39] the
[1:09:40] atmosphere there's something about that
[1:09:43] amen it's the same thing going to a ball
[1:09:45] game there's an atmosphere and a lot of
[1:09:48] people feed off of that they go to bars
[1:09:51] because they like that atmosphere they
[1:09:52] go there because they like that that
[1:09:54] feeling that they get well then it's
[1:09:57] just some people like you said like
[1:09:59] brother bar said here did you ever see
[1:10:01] people um did you ever see people you
[1:10:04] love to be around just love to be around
[1:10:06] them amen sometimes people come they
[1:10:09] just they just love that atmosphere they
[1:10:11] love that feeling and why wouldn't they
[1:10:13] here I mean if they come to a a Godly
[1:10:16] Holy Ghost filled Church why wouldn't
[1:10:18] they love to I mean the feeling the the
[1:10:21] the the the
[1:10:22] spirit because they create an atmosphere
[1:10:27] yes amen bar creates an atmosphere me a
[1:10:30] ball game creates an atmosphere Church
[1:10:32] creates an atmosphere a political event
[1:10:35] creates an atmosphere
[1:10:38] amen it's an atmosphere that's created
[1:10:41] by all of where does it come comes out
[1:10:42] of their comes from their mind amen
[1:10:44] which is the wound of the spirit
[1:10:46] remember because they create an
[1:10:48] atmosphere here a Heavenly atmosphere
[1:10:52] and you just love to be around them
[1:10:54] praise God God I think that has a lot to
[1:10:57] do with what brother bam said about
[1:10:58] coming to church
[1:11:01] amen others seem to be good people but
[1:11:05] you just I have to get away once in a
[1:11:07] while this that you know what I mean he
[1:11:10] says and they yet seem to be good people
[1:11:12] it's not
[1:11:13] creative and a man was good to be uh a
[1:11:17] man was made to be a God we know that
[1:11:20] Genesis 1:26 he had dominion over the
[1:11:23] whole earth he was made an amateure God
[1:11:26] and now when he receives God he becomes
[1:11:28] a Son of God he was made in the image of
[1:11:32] God God had hands God had feet therefore
[1:11:36] a man was made like him so he is an
[1:11:38] amateure God but sin blinded every fiber
[1:11:42] in his body in his mind in his heart but
[1:11:45] now don't never try to State it out he

[1:12:27] until you are positive that there's
[1:12:29] nothing positive that nothing can turn
[1:12:33] you can turn you
[1:12:36] away the greatest Victory the the uh the
[1:12:40] the greatest Victory is the Walk of
[1:12:42] Faith yes amen the faith is humility
[1:12:46] this is a walk of Faith the walk that we
[1:12:49] walk is a walk of Faith yes amen we must
[1:12:52] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:12:55] rewarder of them that diligently seek

[1:12:59] go through this real quick or go through
[1:13:02] it as the Lord leads I shouldn't say
[1:13:04] real quick but this uh we'll finish up
[1:13:07] with this uh Romans 8 chapter uh chapter
[1:13:10] 8 verse one there is
[1:13:13] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:13:18] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:13:20] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:13:23] what is the mind the mind is flesh yes
[1:13:26] amen you don't walk after the mind you
[1:13:28] don't walk after your ideas your
[1:13:30] opinions your ways you think are the
[1:13:32] best ways don't walk by your mind you
[1:13:34] don't walk by the flesh but you walk
[1:13:36] after the spirit for the law of the
[1:13:39] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[1:13:42] me free from the law of sin and death
[1:13:46] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:13:48] was weak through the flesh God sending
[1:13:51] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[1:13:54] flesh again in the likeness of sinful
[1:13:57] flesh and for our sin condemn sin in the
[1:14:02] flesh or eradicated if you will amen
[1:14:06] eradicated done away with sin in the
[1:14:10] flesh so the things even that have been
[1:14:12] done contrary to the scripture in the
[1:14:15] flesh have been put under the blood of
[1:14:17] Christ amen or shall as I said
[1:14:20] annihilated by the blood of Christ never
[1:14:23] to be remembered by God again never held
[1:14:26] to your account again amen praise the
[1:14:31] Lord condemn sin in the flesh that the
[1:14:34] righteousness the righteousness of the
[1:14:36] law might be fulfilled in us so he
[1:14:39] didn't do away with the
[1:14:41] law amen he just brought about by the
[1:14:45] blood a way for the righteousness of the
[1:14:48] law the righteousness to be fulfilled in
[1:14:51] us now who are born of the spirit
[1:14:56] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:14:58] the spirit for they that are after The
[1:15:00] Flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[1:15:03] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:15:04] things of the spirit we follow by the
[1:15:07] spirit those who are of the Flesh of the
[1:15:09] Mind follow those things those that of
[1:15:11] the Spirit Fall by walk by remember it's
[1:15:14] just the Walk of Faith right amen the
[1:15:16] Walk of Flesh the Walk of intellect is
[1:15:19] something normally you can see or smell
[1:15:21] or hear or something is a walk of the
[1:15:23] flesh the Walk of the spirit is a walk
[1:15:24] of Faith amen because a walk of faith is
[1:15:27] a walk one day at a time one step at a
[1:15:31] time it's like that story that brother
[1:15:34] told that
[1:15:35] man uh after he preached come out said I
[1:15:39] uh Mr brand I don't believe this uh uh
[1:15:43] by this
[1:15:44] Revelation uh uh how do you know that
[1:15:48] this Revelation exists and he said well
[1:15:52] he said and he tried to give him some
[1:15:55] ideals and reason with him he said and
[1:15:58] finally come down the guy just wasn't

[1:16:12] just sitting right there to my house he
[1:16:14] said well how do you know the house is
[1:16:15] there he said well I've been there I
[1:16:16] believe it I I've see he said well what
[1:16:19] does that mean to you then he
[1:16:21] means it it's a revelation to you
[1:16:25] because you know because brother bramon
[1:16:27] he said well you can't see it he said
[1:16:30] but I know it's there he said but you
[1:16:32] can't see
[1:16:33] it you can't feel it you can't smell it
[1:16:36] you can't declare any of your five
[1:16:38] physical senses to that house so how do
[1:16:42] you know well I know it's there I
[1:16:44] believe it's
[1:16:45] there why because you've experienced it
[1:16:49] praise the lord it's come to you by
[1:16:51] Revelation faith is a revelation by
[1:16:54] faith you know it's
[1:16:55] there he said well uh then brother BR
[1:16:58] once he got that across the man he said
[1:17:00] well how now how you going to get there
[1:17:01] he said well I got a there's a path that
[1:17:04] goes up over here and goes up over the
[1:17:05] rice he said well how do you there's no
[1:17:07] path you can't see the path he said well
[1:17:09] I got a lantern he said well what is a
[1:17:11] lantern do it just lights one step at a
[1:17:14] time amen just one step at a time that's
[1:17:19] all the light will do the light will
[1:17:21] light up the light will illuminate the
[1:17:23] path but it'll only illuminate one step
[1:17:25] at a time so what is he trying to get to
[1:17:27] the man it's a walk of faith faith is a
[1:17:29] revelation just get him to understand no
[1:17:31] you can't see the house but you know
[1:17:33] it's there you can't see the path but
[1:17:35] you know it's there how you going to
[1:17:37] walk on it got a l i got a light and the
[1:17:40] light directs me for one step at a time
[1:17:45] everybody wants to everybody seems to
[1:17:46] you know brother green always told that
[1:17:48] story brother BR said everybody wants to
[1:17:49] know the future yes you well brother per
[1:17:52] you want me to tell you yours yeah I
[1:17:53] want said no no no I don't want to know
[1:17:55] I don't want to know don't tell me acts
[1:17:57] like they want to know their future
[1:17:59] what's coming next or something be
[1:18:01] prepared no I'm not tell you how to be
[1:18:03] prepared have your life in Christ
[1:18:06] that'll prepare you for anything that
[1:18:07] comes amen it's so walk of Faith one
[1:18:10] step at a time to be carnally minded is
[1:18:14] death to be spiritually minded is life
[1:18:16] and peace because the carnal mind is an
[1:18:20] enemy against God it's enmity against
[1:18:23] God for it is is not subject to the law
[1:18:26] of God neither indeed can be that's why
[1:18:29] s like we said last week that's why
[1:18:31] Satan chose
[1:18:33] it Body Spirit Soul Satan did not choose
[1:18:38] the part that he knew could be sealed
[1:18:40] out from him so he chose the part that
[1:18:43] he knew he could manipulate even if
[1:18:46] you're a born again Christian he could
[1:18:48] manipulate it that's the part he chose
[1:18:52] amen carnal mind is enmity against God
[1:18:55] for it is not subject to the law of God
[1:18:58] neither indeed can be it's the flesh
[1:19:02] amen but the righteousness cannot be
[1:19:05] subject to the law but the righteousness
[1:19:08] of the law the Holy Spirit can bring
[1:19:12] that mind like you do to yield your
[1:19:15] members to righteousness and not
[1:19:19] unrighteousness your mind cast down
[1:19:23] reasonings
[1:19:25] cast down
[1:19:27] imagination cast down the things that
[1:19:29] might come contrary to the word and
[1:19:32] bring them into complete
[1:19:34] obedience praise the
[1:19:37] Lord
[1:19:39] amen the carnal mind is imity against
[1:19:42] God for it is not subject to the law of
[1:19:44] God neither indeed can
[1:19:46] be amen the the the the the mind is
[1:19:50] flesh and can
[1:19:53] corrupt so then they that but the soul
[1:19:56] that is born of God
[1:19:59] cannot cannot praise the Lord so then
[1:20:03] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:20:05] God but ye are not in the flesh but ye
[1:20:09] are in the spirit if so be that the
[1:20:12] spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[1:20:15] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[1:20:19] none of his but we belong to God because
[1:20:23] the spirit of God is in US us the spirit
[1:20:26] of God is leading us the spirit of God
[1:20:28] has taken control over every part now
[1:20:31] what we yield to the B the Bible didn't
[1:20:34] say that God would bring every one of
[1:20:36] your thoughts to captive to the word it
[1:20:38] tells you to bring every thought
[1:20:41] cap it's whom you yield your members to
[1:20:46] amen not God God's done God's done his
[1:20:50] part the rest is up to us that's the
[1:20:53] whole part of being a free preoral agent
[1:20:56] living for God serving God loving God
[1:20:59] not because we have to or because he
[1:21:00] makes us but because we love him because
[1:21:04] we want to amen the greatest Victory
[1:21:09] because we want to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:21:17] 1 First Corinthians chap 1 verse 10
[1:21:26] Paul sort of like he told he was
[1:21:29] explaining to the Philippians here he
[1:21:31] tells to the Corinthian

[1:22:09] devil bring some kind of wedge in there

[1:22:14] towards somebody that doesn't belong
[1:22:17] Amen Let There be no
[1:22:20] divisions be perfectly joined together

[1:22:27] hath been declared unto me of you my
[1:22:30] brethren by them which are of the House
[1:22:32] of Khloe that there are contentions
[1:22:35] among you remember we've already talked
[1:22:37] about the contentions what brings
[1:22:39] contention Pride that's what I mean
[1:22:42] David told us that in Psalms I believe
[1:22:45] it was the
[1:22:47] Psalms U actually maybe it was I'm
[1:22:50] trying to remember now if it was
[1:22:52] Proverbs it be

[1:22:58] verse now this I say that every one of
[1:23:01] you sayith I am of Paul and I am of
[1:23:05] Apollos and I am of cus and I of Christ

[1:23:14] were you baptized in the name of Paul I
[1:23:17] thank God that I baptized none of you
[1:23:19] but christas and gas lest any should say
[1:23:22] that I have baptized in my my own name
[1:23:25] he did not Paul didn't want any Glory at
[1:23:28] all he didn't want people following him
[1:23:30] he wanted people following Christ all of
[1:23:34] these that he's talking about sephus
[1:23:37] Apollos all Christ
[1:23:40] all the same mind don't follow them
[1:23:43] follow
[1:23:45] Christ brother Bram did the same thing
[1:23:47] don't follow brother brandom follow of
[1:23:49] Christ he lived a life to be exemplified
[1:23:53] absolutely but but I don't follow him I
[1:23:55] follow Jesus Christ I don't follow great
[1:23:58] ministers that come all over I don't

[1:24:11] say that I have baptized in my own name
[1:24:15] and I baptized also the household of
[1:24:17] Stephan stephanus besides I know not
[1:24:21] whether I baptized any other
[1:24:24] and and he thank God that he didn't
[1:24:27] baptize any other but what he's telling
[1:24:29] the same thing be of one mind be of the
[1:24:32] same mind come together as the same mind
[1:24:35] as the same people let that mind be in
[1:24:38] you that was in Christ Jesus if that
[1:24:41] mind that was in Christ is in you it
[1:24:43] will do that it will accomplish in you
[1:24:46] now you yield your members as you are a
[1:24:49] born again Christian you yield your
[1:24:51] members to that Spirit to that life to
[1:24:55] that mind that is now in you to obey the
[1:24:58] word one I'm going to read one more
[1:25:00] scripture and I'm going to close here uh
[1:25:02] Ephesians chapter 2 first three
[1:25:10] verses Ephesians 2:1 and you hath he
[1:25:14] Quicken that is to make
[1:25:17] aive who were dead in trespasses and
[1:25:20] sins wherein in time pass ye he walked
[1:25:24] according to the course of this world
[1:25:26] according to the prince of the power of
[1:25:28] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:25:30] the children of
[1:25:32] Disobedience or still work in the
[1:25:35] children of Disobedience of one of whom
[1:25:38] you used to be one of whom I used to be
[1:25:43] a child of
[1:25:45] Disobedience that disobedient spirit is
[1:25:48] still prevalent in the world today amen
[1:25:51] third verse
[1:25:52] now among whom also we all had our
[1:25:56] conversation in times past in the lust
[1:26:00] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:26:02] the Flesh and of the
[1:26:06] mind so that tells us that there's
[1:26:09] fleshly lustly desires that come into
[1:26:12] the mind again the cross that brother
[1:26:15] brandom put in his car reason for it as
[1:26:18] a redbled male put in his car reason for
[1:26:22] it goes for all of us same thing and
[1:26:25] it's not just a a sexual lust it could
[1:26:28] be a lust for anything
[1:26:30] ungodly someone can be so driven for
[1:26:34] money their whole life is consumed and
[1:26:37] trying to be a
[1:26:39] millionaire their life can be so
[1:26:41] consumed with drugs that they spend
[1:26:44] their last penny on another fix it can
[1:26:48] be a lot more lusts that take over their
[1:26:51] lives than just something like that amen
[1:26:54] that consume a person's
[1:26:57] mind consume their mind let Christ
[1:27:00] consume your mind then he becomes
[1:27:03] everything fulfilling the desires of the
[1:27:06] Flesh of the mind and were by Nature the
[1:27:09] children of Wrath even as others what
[1:27:12] does it do it doesn't create anything
[1:27:15] that's positive that's edifying that's
[1:27:18] righteous that's holy doesn't create
[1:27:20] anything in us that is good amen men we
[1:27:24] want that that's that of Christ that
[1:27:27] that is good to to be consumed in our
[1:27:31] members to be consumed in our lives let
[1:27:35] it take over your mind as the mind of
[1:27:37] Christ and yield to that as a walk of
[1:27:40] Faith as a walk of humility in faith
[1:27:45] amen obedience obedience to Christ the
[1:27:48] word amen let this mind be in you which
[1:27:51] was in Christ Jesus amen
[1:27:54] praise the Lord let's stand if we
[1:28:01] could amen that mind is in you it'll
[1:28:04] cause you to do the exact same thing not
[1:28:07] go to
[1:28:08] Calvary
[1:28:11] amen or as we would say a physical
[1:28:13] Calvary to actually be crucified
[1:28:16] although some people try to emulate that
[1:28:18] don't know why absolutely contrary to
[1:28:21] the scripture he's already done it so we
[1:28:23] didn't have to do do it so why would you
[1:28:25] choose to do it but the life that he
[1:28:28] lived the life that he lived was to put
[1:28:30] others first you don't think Jesus knew
[1:28:33] that the words he was saying would would
[1:28:36] agitate the people that wanted him dead
[1:28:39] you don't think that Jesus the next time
[1:28:42] he healed a
[1:28:44] person he knew that it would INF Fury it
[1:28:47] would just infuriate more the people
[1:28:50] that wanted him
[1:28:51] dead but he didn't care because the
[1:28:54] people were in need and the whole point
[1:28:57] was to help them not himself even though
[1:29:01] it would put him in a worse place it
[1:29:04] would put him in a worse
[1:29:06] standard he did it anyway because the
[1:29:09] people needed help amen he did it so
[1:29:14] that we you and I would have life and
[1:29:19] life more abundant amen praise the Lord
[1:29:23] that's that's his goodness that's his
[1:29:25] grace that's his loving
[1:29:28] kindness praise the Lord but we have to
[1:29:30] let that mind be in us which was also in
[1:29:33] Christ

[1:33:08] amen I just I want to do my bowing and
[1:33:12] confessing now yes amen not when it's
[1:33:14] too late praise the Lord he is he is
[1:33:18] Lord he is my Lord
[1:33:21] amen praise the Lord sorry uh about the
[1:33:25] lunch and thing um last
[1:33:28] Sunday um I talked to Craig and
[1:33:31] everything seemed to be a go but last
[1:33:33] Sunday when I was leaving uh out to go
[1:33:37] uh Jeff the maintenance got here was in
[1:33:39] the in the place next door and U we've
[1:33:42] gotten to be acquaintances so I see him
[1:33:44] I say hello and I saw him in there
[1:33:46] working I went in there and the whole
[1:33:48] place is just full of just stuff all the
[1:33:51] stuff that they had down on the end that
[1:33:53] one time they moved all that stuff over
[1:33:55] here now all that stuff's over here just
[1:33:58] desk chairs dividers uh missan is just
[1:34:02] all I mean there's barely an aisle to
[1:34:04] walk down the middle so it's not even
[1:34:08] remotely feasible uh to do it son's like
[1:34:12] well can we move the stuff no no we
[1:34:15] cannot uh don't know where we'd put it
[1:34:18] if we moved it it's just piled in there
[1:34:22] uh it's a little more organized than it
[1:34:24] used to be on the end down there because
[1:34:25] I saw it what it's down there I saw it
[1:34:27] what was back here and uh now it's over
[1:34:30] there the good thing maybe that'll keep
[1:34:33] him from renting that place so that's
[1:34:35] probably a good thing but the lunch in
[1:34:37] there is not going to work so what we're
[1:34:40] going to plan to do hopefully this week
[1:34:42] maybe even tomorrow we'll go down the
[1:34:44] office and uh we're going to give them
[1:34:47] deposit and everything we're going to
[1:34:48] try to have it at our church community
[1:34:50] area so hopefully that'll work they have
[1:34:53] a problem with that they like to have a
[1:34:55] couple of weeks notice uh so it may be a
[1:34:59] couple of weeks away I'll announce that
[1:35:01] or text you when we have something more
[1:35:03] firm on a date uh but right now we just
[1:35:06] it's it's just up the streets not far
[1:35:08] from here so it's close uh Sonia says
[1:35:12] she went and looked at it last week
[1:35:14] while I was work and she said it was uh
[1:35:16] uh it was a good place it was place to
[1:35:18] put food and places to sit so uh as long
[1:35:21] as it's going to work uh semantically
[1:35:24] physically to have everything then uh
[1:35:27] then if that is okay then we'll just
[1:35:29] we'll have that and uh do that probably
[1:35:32] in a couple weeks we won't do it this
[1:35:33] coming Sunday uh so maybe the next
[1:35:36] Sunday I'm not sure next week uh I'll be
[1:35:40] I will definitely be in Tucson next week
[1:35:43] because uh next week is my current
[1:35:46] manager actually they' switched teams
[1:35:48] over now but what the man that was my
[1:35:50] manager uh this week is going to be his
[1:35:52] last week so he's going to be in Tucson
[1:35:54] we're all going to be in Tucson to see
[1:35:57] him all so they're not he's not our
[1:36:00] upper manager is not going to be sending
[1:36:01] us anywhere else next week so I know
[1:36:03] I'll be here in Tucson next week so uh
[1:36:06] the next few Sundays are available uh
[1:36:09] for us to do something so uh I'll let
[1:36:12] you all know as soon as we have
[1:36:14] something firm set and uh that we can do
[1:36:17] that and and of course you know Sonia
[1:36:20] can communicate and let everybody know
[1:36:22] and uh what's bringing and that kind of
[1:36:25] stuff we have refrigerator to put things
[1:36:27] in if you need to that kind of thing so
[1:36:29] uh but just let you know I haven't
[1:36:31] forgotten it it just u i I just I I
[1:36:35] assumed this was the way it was when he
[1:36:37] left it uh before wide open with glass
[1:36:41] uh shelves so we could just put stuff on
[1:36:43] anyway so Lord willing in a couple weeks
[1:36:47] or so we'll try to have
[1:36:49] that so hopefully that works for
[1:36:51] everybody I just uh i h i just I have to
[1:36:55] set a date and I just pray everybody can
[1:36:58] come um if it's something you can I'm
[1:37:02] sorry
[1:37:04] but
[1:37:08] suay is it oh nice is that a bad time
[1:37:12] which would be nice for your family but
[1:37:14] maybe other people's
[1:37:18] fathers that's just what I'm thinking
[1:37:21] maybe anybody have a father
[1:37:25] mine's gone so I'm mine's gone to be
[1:37:27] with the Lord so she's going to be with
[1:37:30] me is a father huh is a father yeah um
[1:37:36] if if that's an issue let me know I know
[1:37:39] I know it's a congregation we have a
[1:37:40] very difficult time speaking up in
[1:37:42] church
[1:37:43] but if you don't want to speak up in
[1:37:45] church that's understandable it's okay
[1:37:47] uh just let me know if that if that day
[1:37:51] that's the 16th then at the 16th 16th
[1:37:55] then that would be um then that would
[1:37:59] constitute a problem if if that day is a
[1:38:02] problem for everybody if not we'll have
[1:38:04] to do it two weeks after that because
[1:38:06] next Sunday I I'll probably will be fing
[1:38:08] about out
[1:38:10] now if there's anything else you could
[1:38:12] always let me know privately text me or
[1:38:14] something or son you uh of what works
[1:38:17] best so that we can make sure we get the
[1:38:19] right Sunday that's going to work for
[1:38:22] because I as much as I want to need to
[1:38:25] just set a date and hopefully everybody
[1:38:26] can make it I I do want to try to make
[1:38:29] it where everybody can be there
[1:38:31] so so thank you
[1:38:35] that that that's pretty much all I had
[1:38:38] appreciate your prayers um my flights to
[1:38:40] Idaho were great back was great uh work
