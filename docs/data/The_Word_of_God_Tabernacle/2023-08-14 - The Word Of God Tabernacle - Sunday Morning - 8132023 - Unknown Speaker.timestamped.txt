[18:12] amen he's wonderful Lindy got a text
[18:16] from Sister Shelia this morning she uh
[18:19] had an accident
[18:20] um I believe it was yesterday and uh I
[18:23] could look at the text again but I
[18:24] believe it was yesterday she
[18:26] um had a man uh uh washing machine
[18:29] delivery I think coming to her house
[18:31] shoot anyway she had a misstep off of
[18:33] her steps and her foot her leg went down
[18:36] in between the mobile home and the step
[18:38] and just ripped the skin off her leg and
[18:41] her foot and it's just so very sore
[18:43] right now which I can only imagine I
[18:46] just like to try to cut my finger off
[18:48] this week but I wasn't successful
[18:50] but just rip the skin right off of there
[18:53] so I in just just a little bit I think
[18:55] it's so sore I can only imagine how she
[18:57] feels her leg amen so please remember
[19:00] Sister Sheila in prayer she stayed home
[19:02] the pain is just radiating basically she
[19:05] said from her knee to her foot I just
[19:08] can't walk on it just can't go anywhere
[19:10] not planning to go to work tomorrow so
[19:13] please remember Sister shealy in prayer
[19:15] it's it's it's uh very unpleasant it's
[19:18] hurting her
[19:20] for that
[19:23] that's that's the only actual written
[19:25] prayer request I have here so
[19:27] does anyone else have anything in your
[19:29] heart your request
[19:34] as as we all know the Maui was kind of
[19:38] ridden with fires right now the death
[19:40] toll is 55 people
[19:43] um
[19:45] yeah and they're expecting it to
[19:47] increase so
[19:48] those people those families those the
[19:51] tourists that are trapped and
[19:53] there's been fires in Greece there is a
[19:56] firefighting plane that crashed so those
[19:59] pilots and their families and there was
[20:01] another helicopter
[20:02] cop crash and in California I think so
[20:05] there's all kinds of things going on
[20:10] just right down about the Maui fire so
[20:12] thank you for reminding me Monica I
[20:13] forgotten about to mention that that is
[20:16] an extremely severe situation going on
[20:18] over there and of course as one that had
[20:21] as a family that had visited there
[20:24] um I'll get you a minute as a family had
[20:26] visited there and Lahaina was one of our
[20:28] favorite places uh we enjoyed that place
[20:31] very much and had some really good
[20:33] places to eat and always just so sad to
[20:36] see the devastation of the before and
[20:39] after pictures and of course that burger
[20:42] place that we like I saw uh where it
[20:45] used to be it's gone now
[20:47] two store just beautiful place uh it's
[20:50] it's incredible but beyond the lot the
[20:53] loss of property which can be rebuilt
[20:56] the loss of lives has just been
[20:57] devastating they said that that
[20:59] hurricane offshore that made those winds
[21:01] whip across through there blew that fire
[21:04] across so fast people just couldn't even
[21:06] get out they just they had no place to
[21:09] go some people I heard had to jump into
[21:11] the ocean to get away from it uh it very
[21:15] very severe situation so please remember
[21:18] the families those lost loved ones and
[21:21] all the situations I think that brother
[21:23] Michael's talking about let's remember
[21:25] all those Awards and prayer very sad
[21:27] situation

[22:38] conveyor this week
[22:40] I can't even begin to elaborate to you
[22:43] what a feat that is uh one conveyor was
[22:46] 123 four feet the other was 177 feet and
[22:51] just to get those things out of there
[22:54] just we cut just to give you a small
[22:57] example we cut on the new conveyor we

[23:03] that come in on the tires if you've gone
[23:05] through the car wash you know these
[23:07] little black brushes have come through
[23:09] all the tires
[23:10] um we cut we have to cut the conveyor to
[23:12] make room for those to come in and out
[23:14] and just a strip that's about 10 feet
[23:17] long and about that tall wide and just
[23:23] you know quarter inch thick is about 60

[27:33] experienced this to a point before as
[27:35] well
[27:36] brother Danny says I took my car on
[27:39] Thursday to the missions and my check
[27:41] engine light was on and you know they
[27:43] won't even touch you if it's on
[27:45] I didn't have any choice because it's
[27:47] due on the 15th when I got up to have my
[27:51] car checked before they could connect
[27:53] the adapter my engine light went off and
[27:57] my car passed

[28:03] amen God is good give all the glory and
[28:07] praise uh as I was surprised but knowing
[28:10] that what the Lord was doing amen and so
[28:13] praise the Lord God is good isn't it
[28:16] amen wonderful that's such a wonderful
[28:18] testimony amen and sister uh Matisse has
[28:22] a testimony she'd like to give as well
[28:24] that happened to me I also two brothers
[28:40] I don't know why why is I came to the
[28:45] Lord in 1970
[28:47] free and got the Holy Ghost in 74.
[28:51] and and uh or maybe it was 75 anyhow
[28:56] that was about 14 months later and
[29:00] um I saw all these years is what 2023 I
[29:06] have never gotten this and I just want
[29:08] to share it with you because it's it's
[29:09] changed my life and blessed me so much
[29:14] I heard a testimony of a man who had an
[29:17] open Vision he he saw his Bible a Bible
[29:22] and it was just electric with blue
[29:25] lights and everything and he realized it
[29:27] was a sword and he took it and he just
[29:29] level the mountains and then he looked
[29:33] at it and he saw a cross on it and it
[29:35] was just blowing and he was getting so
[29:37] big and he he thought is that the sun is
[29:39] it what and he looked and it's just
[29:41] getting bigger and brighter and then all
[29:45] of a sudden you felt the Bible start to
[29:47] go boom boom boom boom boom boom
[29:51] and he he thought what is that is it a
[29:54] drama what is that
[29:56] and then he started to see the Bible
[29:58] started to vibrate and he opened the
[30:00] Bible and there was a big heart inside
[30:04] how many times have we heard brother
[30:07] Brown say well I heard it I don't know
[30:09] they talked he said I used to think that
[30:13] God was angry with me and Jesus Christ
[30:16] loved me and I came to find out that
[30:19] Jesus is the very Heart Of God Amen
[30:25] that just blessed me so much no wonder
[30:30] when he comes and you get a revelation
[30:32] you feel that closeness of heart no
[30:35] wonder
[30:36] praise the Lord I just never connected
[30:38] them before amen
[30:40] praise the Lord amen
[30:43] when you have the Revelation that he is
[30:45] not chopped up into three pieces but he
[30:48] is one God
[30:50] changes everything about it
[30:53] the worst speaker
[30:54] than that yeah amen I'm thankful that uh
[30:59] that I can realize
[31:03] the Lord makes me realize so
[31:05] that we're

[31:11] all the
[31:13] terrible things that you see in the news
[31:15] of whatever but
[31:17] even for the drivers and nature every
[31:21] little thing we're always uh
[31:23] protected and amen
[31:26] accomplishing just the little things
[31:28] that we
[31:29] do Hallelujah so it's through the day
[31:32] amen it would still be safe in here yes
[31:36] sir brother that is so true when we were
[31:39] in York last Monday
[31:41] there was severe thunderstorm warnings
[31:44] and a tornado warning for our area
[31:47] it stormed and the wind blew but all the
[31:51] bad stuff stayed away from us
[31:56] it didn't come to us I know that so God
[32:00] keeps us safe amen I don't know how many
[32:03] times too I can tell you and you know my
[32:05] testimony and the motion sickness and
[32:07] all that and flying uh how many times it
[32:10] happened two or three times again on
[32:11] this trip where Pilots would come up and
[32:14] say okay we're getting ready to get I'm
[32:16] I'm instructed to the uh the flight
[32:19] attendants to take their seats and
[32:21] buckle your seat belts and we're getting
[32:23] ready to hit some turbulence and it
[32:25] comes
[32:27] is going it's going where's this
[32:30] turbulence and it
[32:32] hardly ever does it materialize and
[32:35] especially not to the level we did that
[32:38] yesterday coming into Tucson he had them
[32:40] sit he had the flight attendants take
[32:42] their seat way out of Wilcox uh there's
[32:45] going to be a real bumpy coming in it
[32:47] wasn't hard there was hardly any bumps
[32:48] at all one or two maybe little things
[32:52] went landed that was it
[32:54] amen so even the pilots that come people
[32:57] that think they're experts that know all
[32:59] this stuff and read their instruments
[33:01] reminds me of that story where uh that
[33:04] family's daughter was dying and the
[33:07] doctor told her she was dying and uh
[33:09] brother random came and prayed for her
[33:11] and they were worshiping and praising
[33:13] God and the nurse came in and checked
[33:15] and she was getting worse the girl was
[33:17] getting worse and the parents were just
[33:19] celebrating worshiping and they looked
[33:22] at the parents they said what are you so
[33:24] happy about what what are you thanking
[33:26] God for what are you worshiping about
[33:27] what are you so excited about
[33:29] this girl's dying can't you see your
[33:32] instruments are failing she's she's
[33:34] she's going she's going to die and then
[33:37] dad looked at her and said
[33:39] young lady we love you and appreciate
[33:42] all that you do for us and everything
[33:44] that you do here as a nurse it's it's
[33:46] quite admirable he said but let me tell
[33:49] you something you are trained to read
[33:51] all those instruments and all that stuff
[33:53] and you know what all of it does he said
[33:56] but we're trained to believe God and God
[33:58] says she's healed by Jesus Christ and
[34:01] that's all
[34:02] and she was healed
[34:05] that's that's what they know all they
[34:08] know is to read their instruments all
[34:10] they know is to look at this but we know
[34:12] a God who is greater than all that
[34:14] amen praise the Lord I believe I believe
[34:17] God I believe the tornado could head
[34:20] right for your head and come and go up

[40:27] Lord helped him and blessed himself
[40:31] it's a testing time when a family goes
[40:33] through those things but it's also a
[40:36] glorious time when God reveals himself

[40:57] something Lord changes something
[40:59] uh this will be our next the last
[41:01] service on this subject the holy spirit
[41:03] this is part 11.
[41:06] um obviously I just take some of the
[41:08] more higher lights of things from the
[41:11] scripture
[41:13] subject
[41:14] you could start on Genesis 1 and take
[41:17] years to go through to revelation 22 on
[41:20] this subject but just the things that
[41:23] the Lord lays before me to pull out to
[41:26] talk about that's what we do so
[41:28] Holy Spirit part 11 amen and as we have
[41:32] done through this series I want to start
[41:34] with Genesis chapter 11 or Genesis
[41:37] chapter 3 verse 21 amen before we do
[41:40] let's just buy our heads for word of
[41:42] prayer once again Lord Jesus father we
[41:45] are so very thankful Lord God of your

[41:57] strong and Lord in so many ways so many

[42:05] Lord you keep us safe and you bless us
[42:07] Lord we know as a child of God there's
[42:09] not one thing can happen to us that you
[42:12] don't allow Satan cannot touch us
[42:15] without your permission
[42:17] and we know and we're so very thankful
[42:19] God that your hand is upon us in every
[42:22] way and at every turn our hearts desire
[42:25] Lords to stay in your perfect will to be
[42:27] led by your spirit so Lord I pray that

[42:52] you for your presence thank you Lord for
[42:54] the feeling of the moving and the
[42:56] anointing and the pulsation of your
[42:58] spirit Lord in this place to this point
[43:01] today God and just trusting Lord there's
[43:03] that Spirit sweeps through here as those
[43:06] words would come Lord that you would
[43:07] anoint me and just anoint our ears God

[43:25] committed to you in the name of the Lord
[43:27] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[43:30] amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21.
[43:35] unto Adam also unto his wife did the
[43:37] Lord God make coats of skins and clothe
[43:39] them praise the Lord he could be seated
[43:42] if you'd like I want to go over to
[43:44] Matthew chapter 13.
[43:49] I want to talk about the seed of God
[43:55] as you may have discerned or
[43:58] taken out of the
[44:01] song sung today uh that's what it's a
[44:05] lot about is being the seed of God being
[44:08] a seed of God means that you are a part
[44:10] of God from before the foundation of the
[44:12] world Amen and I want to speak on that
[44:15] just for a little bit today the Lord
[44:16] willing we're going to begin in Matthew
[44:18] like I said the 13th chapter
[44:22] uh talk about the seeds or 24th verse I
[44:26] mean we read this a few weeks back when
[44:28] one of our uh
[44:32] one of our parts so uh
[44:34] I want to go through this again just
[44:36] real quick
[44:37] uh Saint Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 24.
[44:42] another Parable but he forth unto them
[44:45] saying
[44:47] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a
[44:49] man which sowed good seed in his field
[44:52] but while men slept his enemy came and
[44:56] so Terrors among the wheat and went his
[44:59] way so we now we see that the good man
[45:02] of the house which we know would be God
[45:04] Jesus so good seed or the seed of God
[45:09] Amen and that would be considered the
[45:12] wheat the wheat of the field that was
[45:15] useful was that that is from God so that
[45:19] God seed is the seed that is purposeful
[45:22] to be sown Amen in in the world sin
[45:26] entered into camp and When sin entered
[45:28] into Camp man and woman began to
[45:31] procreate uh through a union between a
[45:34] man and a woman transfer of seed
[45:37] transfer of hemoglobin that would bring
[45:40] forth human life it was inherent in the
[45:43] human as God created them to be able to
[45:46] reproduce and this way through C by
[45:49] reproduction a transfer from male to
[45:52] female the growth of that seed into a
[45:56] life into a life of maturity the exact
[45:59] same thing happens in botany life and in
[46:02] animal life in every life that God
[46:04] created their seed represented of course
[46:07] the human seed carries with it as that
[46:10] birth comes forth the the entrance of a
[46:13] soul into that person because of the
[46:16] human life but as as this procreation
[46:20] began to take place it was a sowing of
[46:23] seed if you will and it was a sowing of
[46:26] good seed and that seed was to be the
[46:29] seed of God from the very beginning Adam
[46:31] Adam God placed Adam on this planet and
[46:35] from that was to emit good seed but as
[46:40] men and women begin to procreate upon
[46:42] the Earth and is the serpent seat begin
[46:44] to prolificate upon the Earth that that
[46:48] bad seed begins is so itself as well to
[46:51] where the the ground that we have today
[46:54] the world that we have today would be
[46:57] scattered about with the seed of God but
[47:01] the majority of the seed that
[47:02] prolificated upon this Earth was from
[47:05] the serpent sea that seed that was the
[47:08] tear seed the seed that was not now hear
[47:12] me right through predestination in my
[47:15] mind now we know God has everything
[47:17] under control and everything nothing can
[47:19] happen that he doesn't already know but
[47:21] the per the the the perfect will of God
[47:24] to me was to be in here Adam and Adam
[47:28] see or the life of God if you will which
[47:33] would be God seed not Adam seed but God
[47:36] seed it only became Adam's seed after
[47:39] the fall was to be the seed of God that
[47:42] was to that was to cover this ground
[47:46] that was to cover this Earth was to be
[47:48] those names written in the Lamb's Book
[47:50] of Life before the foundation of the
[47:52] world predestinated in God's mind to be
[47:55] so
[47:56] now the prolification of the uh the
[47:59] continuance the the growth of The Bad
[48:02] Seed has happened in this world because
[48:05] of the fall and because man and woman
[48:07] can procreate that procreation brought
[48:11] about a sowing of bad seed amen the
[48:16] sowing of Bad Seed now the Earth is
[48:19] overtaken with the bad sea with the
[48:22] tares if you will and it was only that
[48:25] way it was never intended to me Saints
[48:28] it was never intended to be that way it
[48:32] was never intended in God's mind in
[48:34] God's perfect will for those in God's
[48:37] permissive will the care to be born on
[48:40] this Earth it was those that were whose
[48:43] names when the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:44] before the foundation of the world whose
[48:47] seed was supposed to be planted on this
[48:49] Earth and come forth as the seed of God
[48:53] that's all it was ever supposed to be
[48:55] but uh but because of the evil spirit
[48:59] there was the spirit that come forth in
[49:01] the fall of the Garden of Eden that
[49:03] began to sow Bad Seed begin to sow at as
[49:07] it is represented here an enemy
[49:11] an enemy seed and it was considered or
[49:15] called tares in the Bible which we know
[49:18] is just a weed or something that's
[49:20] basically useless it's more of a
[49:22] nuisance than anything
[49:24] especially if you're trying to uh grow
[49:28] something if you're trying to uh uh
[49:31] plant or harvest uh something is
[49:34] difficult sometimes when uh when there's
[49:37] tears everywhere to be able to to
[49:39] harvest the the correct wheat the
[49:43] correct seed
[49:45] but
[49:46] the tear now is basically something
[49:49] that's
[49:50] useless worthless I'm not saying that
[49:53] humans aren't because every human is a
[49:57] person with a soul where 10 million
[49:59] worth and we don't personally know uh by
[50:03] appearance whether someone is or is an a
[50:06] seed of God yes uh we don't know that
[50:09] even no matter if they come to church no
[50:11] matter if they've never gone to church
[50:12] in their life though we may we buy we
[50:15] don't know for sure everyone that is a
[50:18] seed of God or everyone that is a terror
[50:20] we don't know that we just do know that
[50:23] the terror song was in a greater
[50:26] quantity uh than the seed of God that's
[50:29] why it has taken over the world uh God
[50:32] the the seed of the serpent Satan seed
[50:35] that had taken over this world we know
[50:37] has prolificated to the point that it
[50:39] covers the earth now amen and the seed
[50:42] of God that's why God is going to one
[50:44] day take his seed his wheat and he's
[50:47] going to pull them out amen and then the
[50:49] rest is going to be burned
[50:51] amen the rest is going to be burned
[50:54] let's continue
[50:55] so now we see from that
[50:57] that this Parable that Jesus was talking
[51:00] about God The Good Seed the good man
[51:04] sowed wheat good seed the enemy came in
[51:09] so tears bad seed and went his way but
[51:13] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[51:16] forth fruit then appeared the tares also
[51:19] the Servants of the householder came and
[51:22] said unto him sir this not thou sow good
[51:25] seed in thy field from Winston as it
[51:28] tears
[51:30] and he said unto them an enemy has done
[51:33] this the servant said unto him wilt thou
[51:37] then that we go and gather them up but
[51:40] he said nay lest while ye gather of the
[51:43] tares ye root up also that we with them
[51:46] and we talked about that again like I
[51:47] said
[51:49] four or five weeks ago I forgot at what
[51:51] part of this it was but we we talked
[51:54] about that yeah
[51:55] let both grow together until the Harvest
[51:59] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[52:01] the Reapers Gather ye Gather ye together
[52:04] first the tares and buy them in bundles
[52:07] to burn them but gather the wheat into
[52:09] my barn amen so God's taking he's
[52:13] binding the tares together now we see
[52:15] that happening all the evil coming
[52:18] together as divided as things sing now
[52:20] Saints with all the government and all
[52:22] everything else going on around the
[52:24] world that that all the evil is coming
[52:26] together all of the evil is being bound
[52:29] together but yet all the bride is coming
[52:32] together she's coming together they're
[52:35] coming together under evil spirit she's
[52:37] coming together under the blood of Jesus
[52:39] Christ
[52:40] and God is about to take his pride out
[52:43] of here so the rest of this can be
[52:46] burned amen that's where we're getting
[52:49] to the place of the of the complete
[52:51] annihilation of this world of
[52:53] annihilation with the complete burning
[52:55] over complete uh uh cleansing of this
[52:58] world is about to take place now
[53:00] Revelation chapter 13.
[53:09] amen Revelation 13 8.
[53:16] Revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon
[53:19] the Earth
[53:20] shall worship Him whose names are not
[53:23] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[53:26] slain from the foundation of the world
[53:28] now this is of course talking about the
[53:30] Beast the Beast that will be worshiped
[53:33] by everyone except for those whose names
[53:38] were written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[53:40] before the foundation world or the wheat
[53:43] or the seed of God the seed of God those
[53:47] that that is Gods who have the seed of
[53:50] God in them will not worship this Feast
[53:53] regardless of the cause regardless of
[53:56] what it takes regardless of what it cost
[53:58] them they will not ever worship that
[54:01] Beast they will never bow down to that
[54:04] Beast amen remember that one time when
[54:07] the devil tried to trick brother random
[54:09] into doing that when he was gonna go see
[54:11] the Pope
[54:13] the image to the Beast of the Beast when
[54:16] he was going to go visit the pope he had
[54:18] a audience with the Pope and brother bam
[54:22] talked about the cutting of the cup and
[54:24] all I forgot all the stuff they had the
[54:25] pump and stuff he had to do all these
[54:27] things but then the last thing they said
[54:29] now when you approach him you must
[54:32] battle a knee and kiss his ringing
[54:34] programs up that's out
[54:36] I'll never the gut the Cuffs your pants
[54:39] and all that stuff that's okay but I
[54:41] don't bow to anybody but Jesus Christ
[54:44] right most Last Kiss the Rain that it
[54:47] did Hallelujah from a man how about
[54:50] nobody but Jesus Christ
[54:52] and of course he left never saw him amen
[54:55] because the seed will not do that
[54:57] deceived what I'm about to that image
[54:59] will not bow to that Beast will not bow
[55:02] down or uh accept any of its dogmas and
[55:07] doctrines which a lot of people bow to
[55:09] today they may have never had audience
[55:11] with the Pope but they bow down to that
[55:13] Doctrine they bow down to that Dogma
[55:15] which is the exact same thing by bowing
[55:18] down to what he says and obeying it
[55:21] through its Dogma instead of the word
[55:23] they're bowing down to that Beast
[55:25] they're serving to the image of that
[55:28] Beast because of what they say and do in
[55:31] their worship by by their religion or
[55:34] whatever they want to call it religion's
[55:37] nothing but a covering right amen but
[55:39] people they bow down to this Beast by
[55:42] bowing down to that word their words not
[55:46] the word their word
[55:48] denomination
[55:50] whatever form of it it may be it's still
[55:53] man's idea it's still man's opinion it's
[55:56] still man Dogma they will not do it only
[55:59] those whose names were written in the
[56:01] last book of life who were those those
[56:03] that are the seed of God now we notice
[56:07] that
[56:09] in this last day that brother Brown
[56:12] talked about I remember listen to the
[56:13] sermon uh the the uh cease not air with
[56:17] the shock and it is the rising of the
[56:20] sun uh and the quickening power
[56:23] Amanda forgot the uh
[56:26] Easter seal but the man talks about that
[56:29] quickening power see the only way
[56:32] that it can bring forth the right kind
[56:35] of fruit as that it has to be the right
[56:37] kind of seed
[56:39] and it has to be the right kind of seed
[56:41] in the right atmosphere to produce
[56:45] what's in the sea
[56:47] to produce something that is healthy
[56:49] strong viable to bring forth the good
[56:53] fruit a good crop that seed has to be a
[56:56] right kind of seed in the right
[56:58] atmosphere and brother random said in
[57:01] this last days what this bride is doing
[57:03] through the ministry that is coming
[57:06] through the message that's been
[57:07] delivered and through the word that's
[57:09] been revealed this bride is laying in
[57:12] the presence of the sun just to ripen to
[57:16] get to the place of maturity to get to
[57:19] the places she is no longer uh bathed in
[57:23] Christ or babes in the word she is she
[57:25] is a mature adult in the word Jesus said
[57:28] be therefore perfect
[57:31] grown a full age of maturity be
[57:37] therefore perfect easy this is my Father
[57:40] in Heaven is imperfect that's why this
[57:41] variety is laying in the presence of the
[57:43] Sun
[57:44] she's laying in the presence of the sun
[57:46] now to ripen all this Pride around the
[57:49] world she's taking this word and through
[57:51] Godly ministers and through godly people
[57:54] and through holy ghost-filled people
[57:56] reading and listening in that word
[57:58] becoming real to her she's ripening
[58:01] she's becoming more mature she's
[58:03] becoming more in the image of Jesus
[58:05] Christ every day
[58:07] the bride is becoming more and more like
[58:10] him every day she's becoming more and
[58:12] more like the word every day why because
[58:15] of the seed that is in her
[58:17] it was the seed is what made the
[58:20] difference it was the seed of God if
[58:22] you're not a seed of God then you can't
[58:24] go on into producing or manifesting that
[58:28] that image of God
[58:31] people produce the image of the beasts
[58:33] but not the image of God
[58:36] the only way to produce an image of God
[58:38] is to have the seed of God in you to be
[58:41] a seed of God to be someone whose name
[58:45] was on the Lamb's Book of Life from
[58:47] before the foundation of the world for
[58:50] that seed to bring forth the right kind
[58:52] of life it can only do it when it's in
[58:54] the right place that's when you and I
[58:57] come in the right place God doesn't just
[59:00] plant his seed in anywhere
[59:02] he only plants his seed in the places
[59:05] that he knows is going to represent him
[59:08] that he has sung before the foundation
[59:12] of the world
[59:14] through the annals of time God looked
[59:16] and he saw
[59:17] that who would receive who wouldn't
[59:19] receive who would who would be who
[59:20] wouldn't be amen remember the story
[59:24] brother random tells about the uh the
[59:27] eagle in the chicken yard
[59:29] amen
[59:31] it was uh it was the right kind of seed
[59:34] that was hatched
[59:35] uh the right kind of seed that was that
[59:38] was brought forth
[59:39] but it ended up in the in the wrong kind
[59:42] of atmosphere it ended up in the wrong
[59:44] kind of place uh this this evil egg that
[59:47] this farmer found and stuck under a hen
[59:49] so it could be uh that so that it could
[59:52] be hatched it brought forth the funniest
[59:54] looking chicken you ever seen
[59:56] and that's probably the way the world
[59:58] thought about you the funniest looking
[1:00:00] uh uh uh sinner they had ever seen you
[1:00:05] mean you don't do this you mean you
[1:00:07] don't go there you mean you don't act
[1:00:09] this way and just little things that
[1:00:12] made you look odd that made you feel odd
[1:00:15] even when you're in the world I know so
[1:00:18] many things and sinful things I did when
[1:00:20] I was in the world it made me feel
[1:00:22] uncomfortable uh when I would do them
[1:00:25] that's right uh I when I take a drink or
[1:00:28] something I felt uncomfortable it just
[1:00:30] didn't feel right and I didn't
[1:00:32] understand why because I was one of them
[1:00:36] I was in I I was I was in the atmosphere
[1:00:39] I was in the company and they were all
[1:00:42] doing it and everybody was having a
[1:00:44] great time I remember when I was just a
[1:00:46] boy maybe just just probably a team a
[1:00:50] little older than Joel uh maybe 12 years
[1:00:53] 10 12 years old
[1:00:55] I I I we had all the neighborhood
[1:00:57] friends all the guys we're all friends
[1:01:00] and and people that were around and I
[1:01:02] grew up in a neighborhood with a bunch
[1:01:04] of guys my age so I I grew up with a lot
[1:01:07] of friends and we had set in a circle in
[1:01:10] the middle of the street because a dead
[1:01:12] end Street and a royal air rural area
[1:01:15] we'd sit and somebody one of my buddies
[1:01:19] it'd pull out a uh
[1:01:22] uh stinky I don't want to say it
[1:01:26] to where it sounds okay but not uh an
[1:01:31] illegal cigarette is that something
[1:01:35] uh maybe it's not so illegal anymore I
[1:01:38] don't know but
[1:01:40] and he'd pull it out and then start
[1:01:42] puffing on that thing
[1:01:44] and they'd pass it around the circle
[1:01:47] and for some reason I was 12 years old
[1:01:50] for some reason every time that thing
[1:01:52] came to me I grabbed it and passed it on
[1:01:57] didn't touch it
[1:01:58] didn't want to have anything to do with
[1:02:00] it and I don't know why well I do not
[1:02:02] want now but I didn't know why then
[1:02:05] why can't I be like them
[1:02:07] why can't I act like that why can't I do
[1:02:10] this
[1:02:11] and every time that I do it I smoked a
[1:02:14] little bit when I was a kid when I was
[1:02:16] really young I mean probably even Jose
[1:02:17] yes stuff that happens and I hate every
[1:02:22] every single second of it
[1:02:24] that I hated it
[1:02:26] I I tried so hard to fit in I tried so
[1:02:30] hard to be one of them I tried so hard
[1:02:33] to do what they were doing and I just
[1:02:35] couldn't do it right
[1:02:36] uh it just was something in me it just
[1:02:39] it that's my my soul I might I just
[1:02:42] couldn't do it because there's just
[1:02:44] something in your Saints even from birth
[1:02:47] that told you who you were even when you
[1:02:50] didn't understand yourself who you were
[1:02:53] it was a seed of God that was down in
[1:02:55] there amen you know brother Brown did
[1:02:58] the same thing
[1:03:00] they picked on him and laughed at it
[1:03:02] called him he grabbed that
[1:03:04] cigarette was getting ready to take a
[1:03:05] puff on it in that whirl of wind come
[1:03:07] across through there and he says he
[1:03:08] threw that thing down and ran a rope
[1:03:10] crying and said You big sis he said yeah
[1:03:12] I guess I am I mean what else can you
[1:03:14] say
[1:03:15] I guess I was don't matter to me because
[1:03:19] I don't care anymore because I know who
[1:03:21] I am now
[1:03:22] that's right but I didn't know them but
[1:03:24] it was this it was the seed of God that
[1:03:26] was in that was in me that was in you it
[1:03:29] was a seed of an eagle that was in that
[1:03:31] eagle even though it was in the chicken
[1:03:33] yard it didn't feel comfortable in the
[1:03:36] chicken yard what did him say he said
[1:03:38] that eagle would Peck around the ground
[1:03:39] like all the rest of them they were just
[1:03:41] pecking around and having a great
[1:03:43] Jubilee and just enjoying their
[1:03:44] beautiful feet and that eagle was
[1:03:46] picking that stuff singing what in the
[1:03:48] world are you so happy about this is a
[1:03:50] nastiest stuff I ever tried to eat
[1:03:52] how can you live on this that's just
[1:03:55] pegging but that's all they do picking
[1:03:57] and pecking and pecking ball one time he
[1:04:00] heard a voice stream that was something
[1:04:02] he recognized from the inside it wasn't
[1:04:06] something that was identified to his
[1:04:07] ears or knew his mind or it was
[1:04:10] something on the inside that screen that
[1:04:12] he remembered from before when when it
[1:04:15] was when it identified with who he was
[1:04:17] and he said now I'm something that's
[1:04:20] real amen Mama screamed down and said
[1:04:24] just flat those big wings she got I'll
[1:04:26] catch you just come on up and come up on
[1:04:29] the uh getting just a little bit higher
[1:04:31] in those chickens and clucking clucking
[1:04:33] club and said what's wrong with this
[1:04:34] this is this is great stuff why would
[1:04:37] you leave here
[1:04:38] he looked down at him and said I got I
[1:04:40] got a higher calling
[1:04:42] I'm going to higher Heights just slap
[1:04:45] those wings you'll come up here I'll get
[1:04:47] you amen Mama brought him a nice uh
[1:04:51] rabbit or something that he started
[1:04:52] tearing in and said now that's what I
[1:04:54] know that I was born to eat I wasn't
[1:04:57] born to eat and Peg in that chicken yard
[1:04:59] I was born to eat that fresh Manna amen
[1:05:02] and when God comes across your pathway
[1:05:05] what God reveals to you who you really
[1:05:07] are and you start to realize praise God
[1:05:10] no wonder I didn't want that old chicken
[1:05:12] feet no wonder I let them pass that
[1:05:14] thing across me no wonder if I took a
[1:05:16] puff or a drink it was a nastiest thing
[1:05:18] because I was never one of them
[1:05:21] I've always been one of his praise God
[1:05:24] because I'm one of his none of that
[1:05:26] matters anymore I don't care anymore
[1:05:29] praise God you can bow your heads and
[1:05:32] you can pray in the middle of a crowded
[1:05:35] restaurant you can sit with people who
[1:05:37] are drinking till they're
[1:05:39] into Oblivion and not bother you because
[1:05:42] why because you know who you are
[1:05:45] praise the Lord I think I told you one
[1:05:46] time one of the guys on my uh on my crew
[1:05:50] uh the curmudgeon my one of my best
[1:05:54] friends now
[1:05:55] he told me one time he says you and I've
[1:05:57] never known a minister didn't drink I
[1:05:59] said what you now
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] amen I can't bounce for the rest of them
[1:06:03] but I can sure bounce for me
[1:06:06] amen and praise God because I know by
[1:06:09] the seed of God see and I just have to
[1:06:11] do that because of the identification
[1:06:13] who I know who I am you have to take
[1:06:15] this and you have to apply it to
[1:06:17] yourself
[1:06:19] because you have to be that one you have
[1:06:22] to be that person you have to be the
[1:06:24] recognize you have to recognize who you
[1:06:27] are in yourself as the seed of God
[1:06:29] you're not that chicken and the eagle in
[1:06:31] that chicken yarn you don't belong in
[1:06:33] the chicken yard you're the eagle you
[1:06:36] belong in the heavens eating fresh
[1:06:39] God because
[1:06:42] amen first John chapter
[1:06:45] three
[1:06:46] let's go to First John chapter three
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:52] amen the seed of God
[1:06:57] that is in you that seed of God that was
[1:06:59] there from before the foundation of the
[1:07:01] world sings
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:09] probably get to this again a little bit
[1:07:12] that seed of God
[1:07:15] the god there
[1:07:16] amen that's what that represents
[1:07:19] in my Outlook by life much but that
[1:07:21] little seed right there all the fault
[1:07:23] was in that seed is in God created all
[1:07:26] the heavens and the Earth
[1:07:28] might not look like much
[1:07:31] but it's the most powerful greatest
[1:07:33] force that there's ever been and ever
[1:07:35] will be amen they've got little as much
[1:07:39] if God is in it doesn't matter what it
[1:07:41] looks like doesn't matter what you
[1:07:43] doesn't matter all this doesn't matter
[1:07:45] because what is in me is greater than
[1:07:48] any of the rest that seed seed of God
[1:07:52] first John chapter 3
[1:07:56] . amen talking about the seed now
[1:08:01] look ninth verse whosoever is born of
[1:08:06] God does not commit sin
[1:08:09] for his seed who's seed
[1:08:13] God see
[1:08:14] whose LCD would it be
[1:08:17] amen because you're already born whose
[1:08:20] they'll seed would it be
[1:08:21] his seed God's seed remain I don't know
[1:08:24] why that's not a capitalist not a
[1:08:26] capital H in my Bible shame on Scofield
[1:08:28] but it's not a capital H my Bible should
[1:08:30] be yes yes amen his is God's seed
[1:08:34] remaineth in him me
[1:08:37] and he me cannot sin because he me is
[1:08:41] born of God
[1:08:44] born now there's got to be a new birth
[1:08:46] obviously we know that seed has to be
[1:08:50] born in you it has to be a new birth has
[1:08:53] to be a new line like we talked about
[1:08:55] last week there has to be the Holy Ghost
[1:08:58] in fire come to burn out that old nature
[1:09:00] that we were born with because that seed
[1:09:03] that laid in there was you from the
[1:09:05] beginning it wasn't that safe nature it
[1:09:08] was always God so no matter when no
[1:09:12] matter what you were well no matter how
[1:09:14] you felt no matter who your copy was or
[1:09:16] what you did that seed of God was always
[1:09:18] the representation of who you were who
[1:09:22] you were to be who you are
[1:09:24] and by that seed being in there even
[1:09:27] when that snake nature was doing its
[1:09:30] thing there was something in there that
[1:09:32] said no
[1:09:33] it just didn't feel comfortable
[1:09:35] because that seed was always in there
[1:09:38] now it had gone live it was dormant
[1:09:40] but when the spirit of God comes down on
[1:09:43] that seat when you're burnt born to end
[1:09:45] with the Holy Spirit and fire it comes
[1:09:48] to life it burns out the old nature and
[1:09:51] it gives life remember the seed has to
[1:09:54] be the right kind of seed in the right
[1:09:56] atmosphere
[1:09:58] in the day it was never in the right
[1:10:00] atmosphere but when the Holy Spirit came
[1:10:03] and it came into you that old nature was
[1:10:07] burned out the atmosphere that it was
[1:10:10] now in like we talked about the love and
[1:10:12] the Dove and the lamb in the right
[1:10:15] atmosphere then that that seed began to
[1:10:18] bring forth life and it was the life of
[1:10:20] God
[1:10:21] the life of God from the seed of God to
[1:10:25] produce who you were to be from before
[1:10:27] the foundation of the world Even in our
[1:10:31] sticky human flesh God wants to produce
[1:10:35] us mold us shape us into his own image
[1:10:39] amen praise God and that doesn't mean
[1:10:42] because I'm a male it doesn't mean
[1:10:44] because I'm a human it doesn't mean
[1:10:45] because looks or any of that is because
[1:10:48] of the spirit that is inside of me is
[1:10:50] who I really am
[1:10:52] praise God if it's not then all of us
[1:10:54] are in trouble friend
[1:10:55] all of us are in trouble because there's
[1:10:57] only one form of eternal life and if you
[1:10:59] think you're Eternal the only way you
[1:11:01] can be Eternal is to be God
[1:11:03] because God is the only form of Eternity
[1:11:06] so if you don't if you believe you're
[1:11:09] Eternal then you then you have to
[1:11:11] understand that you are God
[1:11:13] because that's the seed of God
[1:11:16] yeah amen just like we talked about
[1:11:18] before intellectual prayer we talked
[1:11:20] about intellectual property and and
[1:11:23] copyrights and patents and things like
[1:11:25] that that they have even in the natural
[1:11:28] in the world when someone has
[1:11:30] intellectual property an original fault
[1:11:33] and they're mine they put it down and
[1:11:36] they register it with the government
[1:11:37] nobody else can duplicate that without
[1:11:40] having to pay a cost
[1:11:42] or get permission
[1:11:44] that's what that's legal in the country
[1:11:47] right if you come with original thought
[1:11:50] and you put it on paper and you register
[1:11:52] it with the government that's the only
[1:11:53] way that's why when I wrote the book
[1:11:56] I had to copyright that but that book
[1:11:58] because that was original false now I
[1:12:01] took some things and I gave credit to
[1:12:03] the people that I'd heard or took stuff
[1:12:05] from
[1:12:06] but all the original thoughts or
[1:12:08] scripture that came from me is in that
[1:12:10] book and anybody that tries to
[1:12:12] disseminate that and reuse it is illegal
[1:12:14] they're breaking the law
[1:12:16] without my permission which if anybody's
[1:12:20] watching anybody has permissions to you
[1:12:23] know don't hybrid it or anything say
[1:12:26] what it says but it's someone who wants
[1:12:28] to use it
[1:12:29] um I know my wife gets upset sometimes
[1:12:31] that day's just preaching out of your
[1:12:33] books
[1:12:34] maybe that's why God had me write it
[1:12:37] don't worry if people are getting helped
[1:12:38] and blessed by it praise the Lord amen
[1:12:41] you know that's fine
[1:12:43] it's okay I don't God blesses me I don't
[1:12:47] need another dime just God blesses me if
[1:12:50] people are being helped that's all that
[1:12:52] matters that's that's that's what I care
[1:12:54] about but from that seat down the
[1:12:56] intellectual property of God it's a part
[1:12:58] of me it's who I am that thought
[1:13:01] originated for me that thought is a part
[1:13:03] of me
[1:13:05] that thought is Newton Bennett just like
[1:13:07] your original thoughts just like your
[1:13:10] original thing that you think or have or
[1:13:12] do those are yours they came from your
[1:13:15] mind they belong to you they're an
[1:13:16] extension of Who You Are
[1:13:19] well that's just the same thing with
[1:13:21] these scenes those are those are nothing
[1:13:23] but God himself
[1:13:25] God's original thoughts that God has put
[1:13:28] down
[1:13:28] we say in paper but he put his thoughts
[1:13:31] in you
[1:13:33] because you're the thought of God where
[1:13:34] it's your thought of God God's thought
[1:13:36] is as much a part of God as any part of
[1:13:38] God
[1:13:39] Jesus was more much a part of God as any
[1:13:42] part of God
[1:13:43] 's sponsor as much a part of God as any
[1:13:46] part of God and it's your thought of God
[1:13:47] a thought of God then you're as much of
[1:13:50] God than any part of God there is
[1:13:52] that makes you Eternal praise God not
[1:13:56] this nasty thing but that that God had
[1:13:59] predestined in his mind before the
[1:14:01] foundation was who you really are by the
[1:14:05] seed of God
[1:14:06] the seed of God that remaineth in him
[1:14:09] now a lot of people say that you uh and
[1:14:12] I've heard people I've preached
[1:14:14] sometimes I've had
[1:14:17] I'll just be honest uh she may be passed
[1:14:20] now but I actually had one time a woman
[1:14:22] a sister came and tried to correct me on
[1:14:25] something that had spoke I said I'm
[1:14:29] sorry sister but you're completely off
[1:14:31] the word
[1:14:32] not to mention that many quotes I can
[1:14:35] provide for you that brother rounds said
[1:14:37] exactly what I just preached on well you
[1:14:40] that you don't get that seed until the
[1:14:42] word comes into you
[1:14:44] I said I understand the premise of what
[1:14:47] you're saying but let's go to the
[1:14:49] scripture
[1:14:50] because you can take anything and and
[1:14:52] derive something out of it to fit
[1:14:55] something you think or a narrative that
[1:14:57] you have but if you don't take it back
[1:15:00] to the word then what good does your
[1:15:02] thought mean
[1:15:04] my thoughts mean nothing
[1:15:06] my thoughts are absolutely nothing I
[1:15:10] don't care what I try to derive from it
[1:15:12] what does it say that's why I like to
[1:15:16] hinge on in many cases what did Brother
[1:15:19] Branham say
[1:15:21] because I believe brother Brown could be
[1:15:22] the mouthpiece of God a prophet of God
[1:15:25] when God spoke spoke through him I
[1:15:28] believe that was God speaking now when
[1:15:29] brother Brown spoke as a man I
[1:15:31] understand that he was a man only God's
[1:15:34] speaking and when he's ministering and
[1:15:35] the words come before that's I take that
[1:15:37] as God speaking to me amen but now when
[1:15:40] God speaks to me friend that is that is
[1:15:43] a personal relationship that I have with
[1:15:46] God that's that's God speaking my
[1:15:48] thought means absolutely nothing I said
[1:15:51] so when the Bible says that whosoever is
[1:15:54] born of God that means you have a new
[1:15:57] birth
[1:15:58] not a death thought commits sin for his
[1:16:01] seed God seed remaineth in him
[1:16:06] that doesn't mean it was just put there
[1:16:09] that means that it was there and after
[1:16:12] the birth it remained there
[1:16:16] unless I'm nuts crazy whatever probably
[1:16:19] not the right thing to say today but
[1:16:21] politically correct
[1:16:23] unless I've gone crazy isn't that what
[1:16:27] the scripture says
[1:16:28] the seed remaineth in him it didn't just
[1:16:32] get put there it was always there and
[1:16:35] after the birth it remained there yeah
[1:16:39] yeah that's pretty simple to me I don't
[1:16:42] think that takes a huge level of
[1:16:43] intelligence if it did it would it would
[1:16:46] eliminate me right off the bat so I
[1:16:48] thank God that he made it simple so my
[1:16:51] little p brain could understand it or
[1:16:53] that the revelation of God could bring
[1:16:56] it to where I could understand it amen
[1:16:58] that makes sense to me
[1:17:00] so no matter what a person drives of
[1:17:03] their own opinion that's what the Bible
[1:17:04] says and that's what I care about what
[1:17:08] the Bible says that's God's this is
[1:17:10] God's thoughts on paper
[1:17:12] amen this is the thought of God written
[1:17:14] on paper this is God's original thoughts
[1:17:18] whosoever is born of God now whosoever
[1:17:21] is born of God now it's another thing
[1:17:22] get people
[1:17:25] cannot commit sin
[1:17:28] you have to understand uh we and we I
[1:17:31] brought this out before in the past but
[1:17:34] you have to understand there's a
[1:17:35] difference in what the body of the
[1:17:37] spirit are subject to as to what the
[1:17:40] soul is subject to
[1:17:42] amen because when again as we've gone
[1:17:45] through this series so far you
[1:17:47] understand that when you are born of God
[1:17:50] the seal the Holy Spirit remember the
[1:17:52] holy spirit is a seal
[1:17:54] the Holy Spirit seals himself in there
[1:17:57] seals the devil out there's no there's
[1:18:00] no coming in or out of that Soul any
[1:18:03] longer it belongs to God that Soul's
[1:18:07] pure
[1:18:10] is the influence because of your nature
[1:18:13] now the nature of who you are the nature
[1:18:16] of who you are is the nature of God you
[1:18:18] want to know the nature of God reads
[1:18:20] your Bible because Jesus Christ produced
[1:18:22] the nature of God
[1:18:24] so when the nature of God is is
[1:18:27] reflected or produced out of you that
[1:18:30] seed soul is what becomes an influence
[1:18:34] or the nature of your spirit
[1:18:37] your human Spirit now
[1:18:40] influencing what is the life of your
[1:18:42] body and the life of your body bringing
[1:18:45] an influence to the body itself
[1:18:48] now that is absolutely contrary to human
[1:18:52] reasoning because science and and
[1:18:56] medicine and reasoning every bit of that
[1:18:59] channels just the opposite direction
[1:19:03] it all comes science all comes in
[1:19:07] medicine all medical all comes all these
[1:19:10] things in the world all comes in
[1:19:13] is to channel into you through your see
[1:19:16] tells tasteful smell here that channels
[1:19:19] into you
[1:19:21] should try to influence from the out in
[1:19:24] but what God is doing through the new
[1:19:27] birth is influencing by the nature of
[1:19:29] your soul out to your spirit and out to
[1:19:32] your body
[1:19:34] now if that is done in the correct way
[1:19:37] that spirit of God is in you
[1:19:40] then then that Soul belongs to God it's
[1:19:43] that's God
[1:19:44] your Soul's God that's who you really
[1:19:47] are remember we talked about who you
[1:19:50] really are
[1:19:51] who you really are is the thought of God
[1:19:53] is as much God as any part of God and
[1:19:56] that soul is the thought of God it's an
[1:19:59] attribute an expression of God that seed
[1:20:02] that has come forth now
[1:20:04] so how can in your soul you ever commit
[1:20:08] a sin there
[1:20:12] God there's no way because God can't
[1:20:14] commit sin God can't be with their sin
[1:20:18] amen if God can't be with their sin then
[1:20:21] how can there ever be another sin ever
[1:20:24] committed in your soul well when you're
[1:20:26] born of god let's go back to the
[1:20:28] scripture when you're born of God you
[1:20:31] cannot sin why because you've been born
[1:20:33] not your body the body's the same body
[1:20:37] you were naturally born with not your
[1:20:39] spirit because that's the same human
[1:20:41] spirit that came in you at Birth
[1:20:45] it's the same Spirit but what is Born
[1:20:48] Again is your soul
[1:20:51] so it's the soul through your new birth
[1:20:53] that can never commit sin it cannot
[1:20:57] because it's God now the body now if we
[1:21:00] become influenced to the things of the
[1:21:01] world and the Sea tasteful smell here
[1:21:03] imagination constant reason memory come
[1:21:06] back in the spirit and the body and it
[1:21:08] starts and it starts feeding downward
[1:21:10] instead of outward that's when we in our
[1:21:13] sticky flesh and our humanity and all
[1:21:16] those things say things we shouldn't
[1:21:19] feel things we shouldn't act in ways we
[1:21:22] shouldn't get tempers like we shouldn't
[1:21:24] things like this that happens that we
[1:21:26] that should not take place but it's our
[1:21:28] old nasty sticky flesh now that's not an
[1:21:31] excuse and that's not making an excuse
[1:21:34] for sin that's just who we are that's
[1:21:36] just the way it happens that's why we
[1:21:38] have repentance
[1:21:39] that's why Jesus came and shed his blood
[1:21:42] so that we can know that when something
[1:21:44] happens he's not supposed to God forgive
[1:21:47] me I'm sorry I didn't mean to act that
[1:21:49] way I didn't mean to talk that way I
[1:21:51] didn't mean to do that whatever it was
[1:21:53] say God forgive me right and repent
[1:21:56] what did Brother green used to say
[1:21:58] repentance was the greatest bargain we
[1:22:00] ever got I think it was brother green
[1:22:02] used to say that repentance was the
[1:22:04] greatest bargain human ever got amen
[1:22:06] that's the truth because we can go to
[1:22:08] God not that we make the grace of God of
[1:22:10] disgrace we don't go do it say well you
[1:22:13] know just lay in the lap of sin and just
[1:22:15] say oh God will forgive me well you
[1:22:17] might as well go to a Catholic church
[1:22:18] because that's you know do your Penance
[1:22:20] and do your thing and pay the money
[1:22:23] whatever they do now and you're absolved
[1:22:25] and even if you do die in the horrible
[1:22:28] wretchedness of sin they'll just pay you
[1:22:30] even more money and get you out of
[1:22:32] purgatory and you're still okay so
[1:22:35] what
[1:22:38] anyway
[1:22:39] your soul is what's born of God
[1:22:43] amen and when your soul can't when your
[1:22:46] soul is God how can it sin that's why it
[1:22:48] says you cannot the man whoever's born
[1:22:51] of God not born here not born here but
[1:22:53] born there so that's what it's referring
[1:22:56] to cannot see uh cannot sin for the seed
[1:23:00] of God is in there
[1:23:02] cannot sin because because of the uh is
[1:23:06] born of God because he's a new creature
[1:23:09] because that Spirit now that that the
[1:23:13] spirit of God is now the nature of God
[1:23:16] is now influencing your human spirit
[1:23:19] which is influencing your body which is
[1:23:22] causing you to outwardly act different
[1:23:26] think different and sound different and
[1:23:29] eat different and drink different and
[1:23:31] talk different and have different
[1:23:33] friends and have different company
[1:23:35] people that you that you're around your
[1:23:38] life is all different again Paul the
[1:23:41] things I used to hate on all the other
[1:23:43] things I used to love and I'll hate why
[1:23:44] because he was a different man
[1:23:46] he was born again
[1:23:49] God in his Infinite Wisdom
[1:23:54] May to help us
[1:23:57] to to be at the place where his life
[1:24:01] his Spirit can influence us in even a
[1:24:05] more greater way than we could ever
[1:24:06] thought to begin with
[1:24:09] look now
[1:24:12] let me see you this is the invisible
[1:24:15] Union
[1:24:17] brother Ram says
[1:24:19] you never did it he's talking about
[1:24:22] justification
[1:24:24] he said you never did it
[1:24:27] sin going back to this scripture we just
[1:24:31] read first John 3 9.
[1:24:33] because that little germ
[1:24:36] amen little germ
[1:24:39] that was in you
[1:24:41] was to be you before the foundation of
[1:24:45] the world
[1:24:46] when God put your name in the Lamb's
[1:24:49] Book of Life
[1:24:51] that there was always in there remember
[1:24:54] what did he say here
[1:24:57] because that germ that was in you
[1:25:01] now people is
[1:25:03] that I I don't know that precious sister
[1:25:06] if she ever
[1:25:09] but that got the Revelation I'm not sure
[1:25:11] but
[1:25:14] this is pretty this is the scripture
[1:25:16] this quote is exactly in line with the
[1:25:19] scripture
[1:25:21] not a man's thought not a woman's
[1:25:23] thought not anybody's thought but the
[1:25:25] word
[1:25:26] because that little germ that was in you
[1:25:31] was to be present you
[1:25:36] past tense was be present you now
[1:25:41] praise the Lord again to me friend it's
[1:25:45] very simple
[1:25:46] it was to be you from before the
[1:25:48] foundation of the world God put your
[1:25:50] name in the last book of life when what
[1:25:52] we've just read the scripture before the
[1:25:54] foundation of the world he put my name
[1:25:56] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:25:59] foundation of the world
[1:26:01] Christ revealed in his own word
[1:26:04] let me see I'm the time's getting away
[1:26:06] from me let me see if I can
[1:26:08] I think this was a little bit of a
[1:26:16] let's see here Christ revealed in his
[1:26:18] own word
[1:26:19] last Sunday when we was going into those
[1:26:23] uh Cycles about how the five senses of
[1:26:25] the Realms of these circles here he's
[1:26:27] talking about he says or it's written on
[1:26:30] here Cycles I thought he meant circles
[1:26:32] uh the five senses on the outer realm
[1:26:35] that's the endless to the five senses to
[1:26:37] the body there's only one way you can
[1:26:39] get into that body that's by those five
[1:26:41] senses the sea case will smell here and
[1:26:44] there is no other way to contact that
[1:26:46] body on the inside of that man is called
[1:26:48] Spirit human spirit and he has five
[1:26:50] senses uh he doesn't list them all here
[1:26:53] but we just set them in imagination
[1:26:55] constant region fiction
[1:26:58] um
[1:26:58] and
[1:27:00] five of them now you can't now you can't
[1:27:04] think with your body you think with your
[1:27:06] mind and in there is where too many
[1:27:10] Christians only uh too many of
[1:27:13] Christians only stop
[1:27:15] and they can just uh like the corner
[1:27:17] wheat in the field and the weed and the
[1:27:20] the uh and the weed in the field they
[1:27:22] can be Anointed with the same Holy
[1:27:25] Spirit
[1:27:26] uh that the real believer is Anointed
[1:27:29] with but down on the inside of that the
[1:27:32] next realm Third Realm is the soul
[1:27:35] and that's predestinated by God there is
[1:27:39] where the real germ seed lays is in
[1:27:42] there in the soul that's why that's what
[1:27:45] God is concerned about cares about
[1:27:48] that's what we should be concerned about
[1:27:51] cared about I remember if I take a
[1:27:53] couple bird and cut it open drafting the
[1:27:56] heart of a weed and put it in there bury
[1:27:57] it it would bring forth the wheat out of
[1:28:00] the cockle bird no matter what the
[1:28:01] outside is well if the emotions are and
[1:28:05] and those things today people are so
[1:28:08] confused about the evidence of the Holy
[1:28:10] Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate
[1:28:12] any kind of a gift that God has but he
[1:28:15] cannot bring that word word by word by
[1:28:18] word right yes amen cannot do it
[1:28:22] that's where he failed in the Garden of
[1:28:24] Eden that's where he's always felt
[1:28:26] that's where them on the tape the false
[1:28:28] anointed ones uh they can be Anointed
[1:28:31] with the same Spirit speak in tongues
[1:28:33] dance shout preach the gospel and still
[1:28:36] be a devil is the inside
[1:28:38] praise the Lord
[1:28:41] amen he talks about Abraham and Levi and
[1:28:45] uh
[1:28:46] being the great great grandfather I
[1:28:49] forgot how many times removed it was but
[1:28:52] anyway and and still that seed that was
[1:28:55] in Abraham we talked it goes in Hebrews
[1:28:59] that same seed that God recognized he
[1:29:03] attributed to Levi Generations later he
[1:29:06] attributed to Levi because he was
[1:29:08] already in him amen
[1:29:11] praise the Lord
[1:29:13] let's go on
[1:29:14] Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:29:19] Ephesians chapter one we'll start with
[1:29:21] verse 1.
[1:29:28] something
[1:29:30] amen Ephesians 1 1.
[1:29:33] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:29:35] will of God to the Saints which are at
[1:29:37] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:29:39] Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God
[1:29:42] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ
[1:29:44] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:29:46] Lord Jesus Christ who bless us with all
[1:29:48] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:29:50] in Christ according as he had chosen us
[1:29:55] God had chosen Us in him
[1:29:59] before the foundation of the world that
[1:30:02] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:30:05] before him in love
[1:30:08] which God is love
[1:30:10] having predestinated us unto the
[1:30:14] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:30:17] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:30:20] of his will predestinated of a bad word
[1:30:24] in a lot of Christian circles but a true
[1:30:27] word nevertheless a scriptural word
[1:30:29] nevertheless because we are truly
[1:30:33] predestinated of God
[1:30:35] because God
[1:30:37] predestinates based on his foreknowledge
[1:30:40] not based on his will that's right
[1:30:43] God knew everything in from the
[1:30:46] beginning thus he could predestinate you
[1:30:49] can't say that God didn't know every
[1:30:52] single thing every single person that
[1:30:54] would ever be on this planet God knew
[1:30:58] amen and if he did then he could
[1:31:00] predestinate he knew who would believe
[1:31:03] who wouldn't believe who would accept
[1:31:04] him who wouldn't accept him and thus by
[1:31:07] that he could put that seed in that
[1:31:09] person
[1:31:10] amen put their name on the last book of
[1:31:13] life before the foundation of the world
[1:31:16] and that book that contains your name is
[1:31:19] the seed of God that brings forth your
[1:31:22] name and was supposed to be that way as
[1:31:24] decreed time
[1:31:26] by the original creation
[1:31:28] but God still made a way through
[1:31:31] procreation man and woman through time
[1:31:33] uh we know how brother green used to
[1:31:36] talk about brother Brown told him that
[1:31:38] that God sent your dad from wherever
[1:31:41] here and your mom way over here however
[1:31:42] it was brought the two together so they
[1:31:44] would breed you that was his word that's
[1:31:47] what brother green said to bring you to
[1:31:50] bring him about amen the purpose of that
[1:31:53] being regardless of what else happened
[1:31:55] regardless of what else goes on there
[1:31:58] was a reason why God brings all these
[1:32:01] things together to work according to his
[1:32:03] perfect plan because of the
[1:32:05] circumventing of of of of the original
[1:32:08] sin God had to bring forth the seed that
[1:32:11] he intended in The Book of Life the last
[1:32:14] book of life through procreation and
[1:32:18] then produce a plan to save that person
[1:32:21] and to fill them with his spirit
[1:32:23] that's why he brought us to this place
[1:32:25] why every one of us or are in this place
[1:32:29] not not this place but in him now
[1:32:32] because of what God did and brought all
[1:32:36] this together however it is why I forgot
[1:32:38] it takes God to do it things amen and
[1:32:42] God brings every bit of it around to
[1:32:43] bring it all the place so that every bit
[1:32:45] of it falls in line to work together for
[1:32:48] our good and for the good pleasure of
[1:32:51] his will
[1:32:53] amen we're predestinated to the good
[1:32:57] pleasure of his will to the praise sixth
[1:32:59] verse to the praise of the glory of his
[1:33:01] grace where he hath made us accepted in
[1:33:04] the Beloved in home we have Redemption
[1:33:08] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:33:10] sins according to the riches of his
[1:33:12] grace we've been predestinated and now
[1:33:14] we've been redeemed praise the Lord he
[1:33:17] redeems the predestinated only the
[1:33:21] predestinated are redeemed
[1:33:24] because you can't redeem something that
[1:33:25] was not previously there
[1:33:28] you can only re prefix or E bring back
[1:33:32] you can only read something that was
[1:33:35] there to start with that's right if it
[1:33:37] was never there to start with it
[1:33:39] couldn't be read
[1:33:40] you could deem it
[1:33:43] I deem you as so and so or like they do
[1:33:46] in England i dub you so-and-so I deem
[1:33:50] you as something but to redeem something
[1:33:52] it had to be there to start with
[1:33:55] I put you in a position
[1:33:58] but redeem means I put you back in the
[1:34:01] position that you should have been and
[1:34:03] we're in
[1:34:05] praise God so only those that were there
[1:34:07] to start with could be read back to
[1:34:10] there
[1:34:11] praise God
[1:34:13] through his blood the forgiveness of sin
[1:34:15] the forgiveness of sin according to the
[1:34:18] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[1:34:20] abounded toward us and all wisdom
[1:34:22] Prudence having made maybe I should have
[1:34:25] split this in two parts is taking longer
[1:34:28] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:34:31] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:34:34] which he had purposed in himself now
[1:34:37] that he's predestinated you and he's
[1:34:39] redeemed you he's revealing himself to
[1:34:42] you amen praise God revealing to who the
[1:34:46] Regis
[1:34:48] now that God's put you back in your
[1:34:50] proper position now that the New Birth
[1:34:53] has taken place and now that influence
[1:34:56] of God is taken over your life now he
[1:34:58] begins to reveal himself to you now he
[1:35:01] begins to let himself known to you who
[1:35:04] he really is know what you learned in
[1:35:07] Sunday school or some denomination or
[1:35:09] something which is okay or some uh uh uh
[1:35:13] a Catholic or Pope or something but who
[1:35:16] you really are and who he really is in
[1:35:18] you he begins to reveal to you
[1:35:21] the mystery
[1:35:24] is no longer a mystery not to the bride
[1:35:27] because it's been revealed to her
[1:35:29] praise the Lord is this not the
[1:35:33] manifestation
[1:35:34] of the word of God the revealed word of
[1:35:37] God for the day as it was
[1:35:39] as it was in the days of the son of man
[1:35:44] amen the manifesting revealing
[1:35:49] 10th verse now that in the dispensation
[1:35:51] of the fullness of time he might Gather
[1:35:54] in one all things in Christ which are in
[1:35:58] heaven and which are in Earth even in
[1:35:59] him now we're being gathered together
[1:36:01] because this is the end time
[1:36:03] and the fullness of time we're about to
[1:36:05] go home God's bringing it all together
[1:36:08] he's predestinated you he's redeemed you
[1:36:11] he's revealed himself to you he has
[1:36:13] brought you through to the maturity of
[1:36:16] who you really are and now into the
[1:36:18] fullness the end of time we're about to
[1:36:20] go home in home we have obtained an
[1:36:23] inheritance and that's where
[1:36:25] to our inheritance
[1:36:27] amen
[1:36:30] oh
[1:36:31] Paul had such a revelation of the word
[1:36:34] no wonder God no wonder brother Branham
[1:36:36] said that God would show to Paul to
[1:36:39] bring to the Ephesians the message he
[1:36:42] did
[1:36:43] this first chapter would have thrown the
[1:36:46] Corinthians or Galatians on their ear
[1:36:49] but I by the way brother banham talked
[1:36:52] about it the Ephesian Church could
[1:36:54] receive this and accept it to understand
[1:36:56] who they were and not worry about
[1:36:58] talking about honey you need to quit
[1:37:00] talking about each other the way you are
[1:37:02] you need to keep running each other down
[1:37:04] you need to quit doing this and quit
[1:37:05] doing that no he just showed them the
[1:37:08] revelation of Jesus Christ Christ from
[1:37:10] the beginning to end
[1:37:12] amen praise
[1:37:14] predestinated from before the foundation
[1:37:16] of the world mine amen being
[1:37:20] predestinated according to his purpose
[1:37:22] of whom uh of him who work in all things
[1:37:24] after the Council of his own will that
[1:37:26] we should be to the praise of his glory
[1:37:29] who first trusted in Christ in whom he
[1:37:32] also trusted after that you heard the
[1:37:35] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:37:36] salvation in whom also after that you
[1:37:39] believe you were sealed with the Holy
[1:37:40] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[1:37:42] of our inheritance until the Redemption
[1:37:45] of the purchased possession praise the
[1:37:48] Lord God predestinated you God is
[1:37:52] omniscient which means all-knowing he
[1:37:55] knows all things beginning from End Amen
[1:37:58] and all things that were redeemed now
[1:38:01] I'm going to read this
[1:38:03] amen and I'm going to close and
[1:38:07] uh the next part was going to piggyback
[1:38:10] on this part so Lord willing what we'll
[1:38:13] do is just try to take some of the nose
[1:38:15] things the Lord had gave me on to the
[1:38:17] we'll just try to make the next one that
[1:38:19] if not it'll just go to another part but
[1:38:21] let me read this
[1:38:23] and we'll close here
[1:38:26] in broken system
[1:38:28] now this is something that people still
[1:38:30] struggle over even in the message I've
[1:38:33] talked to people who still struggle over
[1:38:35] this
[1:38:36] I have people who have told me that they
[1:38:39] understand
[1:38:41] said thing yet their actions
[1:38:46] tell a different story
[1:38:48] uh it
[1:38:49] their actions in the way they talk would
[1:38:52] would lead you to believe that they
[1:38:55] don't have a revelation of this
[1:38:57] of the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:01] probably one of the most misunderstood
[1:39:03] things in all of Christendom is the
[1:39:05] evidence of the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:39:08] amen and I say that because it's
[1:39:10] discussed about in so many different
[1:39:12] circles in the Christian religion now
[1:39:15] Trinity of course is we know it's false
[1:39:18] but that has you said well that's one of
[1:39:21] the most controversial no it's not the
[1:39:24] most 99 probably of the Christian
[1:39:28] religion Christian World believes in the
[1:39:30] Trinity they believe in three Gods
[1:39:32] there's no debating that you go to
[1:39:35] another church or calvary or a Baptist
[1:39:38] Church or they that's all that the
[1:39:41] Trinity is it they believe in three gods
[1:39:43] it's not up for debate that's not
[1:39:46] something we look at it and we know it's
[1:39:48] not up for debate either we know there's
[1:39:50] not three Gods we know there's not a
[1:39:53] Trinity right we know there's one God
[1:39:55] amen amen amen no not one like your
[1:39:58] finger but that's a whole nother message
[1:39:59] but uh but this is still in controversy
[1:40:05] with a lot of people and a lot of people
[1:40:06] I've talked to even in the message
[1:40:08] listen brother Brown now remember
[1:40:12] I I take what he says to the word
[1:40:15] amen and to me what is said here what
[1:40:18] the word says matches yes yes by the
[1:40:21] Revelation the Lords get me now it may
[1:40:23] not be the same for other people that's
[1:40:24] up to them that's their responsibility
[1:40:26] to God this is my responsibility to God
[1:40:29] that's what I believe amen but this I
[1:40:33] believe brother random spoke
[1:40:35] I considered that as God speaking to me
[1:40:38] listen
[1:40:40] he talked to he said let me just read
[1:40:42] the whole thing this isn't broken sister
[1:40:44] and if you want to find it July 26 1964.
[1:40:48] today I was talking with my good friend
[1:40:50] Dr Lee Vale who is present now
[1:40:52] he's quite a theologian and so we
[1:40:55] usually have some pretty good
[1:40:57] discussions on the scripture he's very
[1:40:59] smart and he asked me one time what I
[1:41:02] thought about the initial evidence of
[1:41:03] the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:41:06] it's been that way been said that way
[1:41:09] many years and a lot of people they
[1:41:10] still believed that I had a very dear
[1:41:12] good friend of mine in Charlotte that
[1:41:14] still believed that believe he probably
[1:41:16] believed it to the day he died I guess I
[1:41:19] I tried to help him with some scripture
[1:41:22] but they had I won't tell you what
[1:41:25] Ministry he was involved in is is a big
[1:41:27] one but they actually their Church in
[1:41:30] Charlotte that he went to their sign for
[1:41:32] their Church their Church sign was
[1:41:35] literally in the image of a tongue no
[1:41:38] joke I'm not I'm I'm not exaggerating
[1:41:40] right their Church sign on the side of
[1:41:44] the road was literally in the image of a
[1:41:46] tongue yeah that that is how steeped
[1:41:50] they were in believing that that you
[1:41:52] spoke in tongues with initial love until
[1:41:54] he goes he told me one time
[1:41:56] that he had a sales consultant purse
[1:41:59] that they were after they got done
[1:42:00] meeting with a client and they were in a
[1:42:03] parking lot and he got to talking and
[1:42:05] they were talking about Christianity and
[1:42:07] stuff like this and the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:09] he told now this is his testimony to me
[1:42:11] or was he's passed away now but he was I
[1:42:14] loved the brother he was a good friend
[1:42:16] um he would he expressed the story to me
[1:42:19] said and I'll just tell you in my way
[1:42:22] yeah
[1:42:23] what I heard was I got this woman to
[1:42:26] battle him so much she thought she was
[1:42:27] speaking in tongues
[1:42:29] that's what I heard
[1:42:31] because they get you repeating the same
[1:42:33] phrase over and over again
[1:42:36] and they get a person so tongue-tied
[1:42:39] that they think they're speaking in
[1:42:40] tongues that and the Holy Spirit done is
[1:42:43] you got it that's it you got it now
[1:42:45] you've reached it and all the person's
[1:42:47] done is basically gotten they're babbled
[1:42:49] their tongue tied so to the point that
[1:42:50] they think they have the Holy Ghost
[1:42:52] sad but true
[1:42:55] sad but true but look now this is the
[1:42:58] question initial evidence of Holy Ghost
[1:43:02] uh brother man said now to leeville's
[1:43:05] question no I can't see that
[1:43:09] speaking of initial let's begin in
[1:43:12] tongues initial evidence the Holy Ghost
[1:43:13] he said I can't see that he said neither
[1:43:15] do I leave Bell said neither do I said
[1:43:18] though I thought I've Been Told
[1:43:21] he said what would you think would be an
[1:43:24] Evidence I said the most perfect
[1:43:26] evidence I could think of as love
[1:43:29] and we got to talking on about it and I
[1:43:31] thought that sounded pretty good that
[1:43:33] love love would be the initial evidence
[1:43:36] of the Holy Ghost you can really Express
[1:43:38] the love of God shows the initial
[1:43:40] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said so
[1:43:42] brother random said so I held to that
[1:43:46] so you imagine when brother Branham is
[1:43:49] holding to this belief
[1:43:51] that love was the initial evidence of
[1:43:53] the Holy Ghost how his ministry was
[1:43:57] affected by that and any message that
[1:44:00] brother Brennan preached during that
[1:44:01] period of time was affected by it amen
[1:44:04] not that he didn't preach the truth I'm
[1:44:06] not saying that and I'm not saying not
[1:44:08] to follow or listen to any of that but
[1:44:11] it has to be affected by it amen he says
[1:44:16] so I thought that sounded pretty good so
[1:44:18] I held to that if a man's got love but
[1:44:23] one day the Lord
[1:44:26] now forget about the discussion between
[1:44:28] a theologian and a minister forget a
[1:44:31] discussion about two individuals and
[1:44:33] their personal opinions
[1:44:35] he said the Lord now you've got
[1:44:38] something
[1:44:39] the Lord in a vision straightened me out
[1:44:43] and he said that the evidence of the
[1:44:45] Holy Spirit was those who could receive
[1:44:48] the word neither speaking in tongues or
[1:44:52] or love but it was receiving the word
[1:44:56] praise God now I'll take that any day
[1:44:59] because that's scripture
[1:45:02] amen amen you've got a lot of people
[1:45:05] around you can produce all kinds of love
[1:45:07] I mean
[1:45:10] there's probably millions of people out
[1:45:12] there produce more love than any of us
[1:45:14] sitting here amen yeah amen me I I'll
[1:45:17] just speak for myself then amen but is
[1:45:20] that the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:45:22] Ghost
[1:45:22] speaking in tongues there's people he
[1:45:25] said devil speak in tongues people speak
[1:45:27] in tongues all the time and even genuine
[1:45:29] anointed Spirit of speaking in tongues
[1:45:32] but that's not an evidence that you got
[1:45:34] the Holy Ghost somebody brother Ramen
[1:45:36] says don't jump any iron you can live
[1:45:38] amen I say don't don't
[1:45:40] don't don't speak anymore with any
[1:45:43] higher than you can live amen but what
[1:45:46] it is is receiving Christ and what is
[1:45:48] Christ the word and he's not literally
[1:45:51] this book Christ the word receiving the
[1:45:54] word because what he say that's the one
[1:45:57] thing the devil cannot do he can
[1:46:00] impersonate any kind of a gift prophecy
[1:46:03] tongues uh love whatever Spirit he can
[1:46:07] produce any of those things he can
[1:46:09] replicate them he can fake them but he
[1:46:12] cannot bring that word word by word by
[1:46:14] word he cannot do it amen amen and that
[1:46:18] shows now receiving of the word that's
[1:46:21] different than just hearing the word
[1:46:23] that's different than just going to
[1:46:25] church and reading the word receiving it
[1:46:28] means you become it
[1:46:29] when you take something into yourself
[1:46:31] that means you've received it it's like
[1:46:33] brother random said when he talks about
[1:46:35] a man and a woman he said as soon as you
[1:46:37] take a woman to your bosom she leaves an
[1:46:40] imprint do you know he said that
[1:46:42] she leaves an imprint that becomes a
[1:46:45] part of you
[1:46:47] amen because you take that you take her
[1:46:50] in unto yourself and she becomes a part
[1:46:53] of you amen that's why uh well one
[1:46:56] reason one reason you don't see us as
[1:47:00] brother and sisters going around hugging
[1:47:02] each other
[1:47:03] for that reason
[1:47:05] many other reasons but that's one of
[1:47:07] them when you take that woman unto
[1:47:10] yourself she becomes a part of you amen
[1:47:13] when I took my wife took her to my I
[1:47:14] received her as my wife amen now she's
[1:47:17] my wife there's no other period that's
[1:47:19] it
[1:47:20] when you receive the word that word
[1:47:22] becomes a part of you when the word
[1:47:24] becomes a part of you you start living
[1:47:26] the word when you live the word your
[1:47:29] life replicates what's in the pages of
[1:47:31] this book
[1:47:33] amen and who Jesus Christ is your life
[1:47:36] replicates your life duplicates your
[1:47:38] life becomes what it is that's receiving
[1:47:42] the word amen
[1:47:44] you can you can drop a word anytime
[1:47:47] but it doesn't matter until somebody
[1:47:49] takes it and puts it into action
[1:47:53] when you put it into action that's the
[1:47:55] token on display the word an action is
[1:47:58] the token on display is the word being
[1:48:00] manifested through you because you've
[1:48:03] received it to yourself it's become a
[1:48:05] part of who you are now it's not just
[1:48:08] now by the true Revelation it's not
[1:48:11] necessarily even just a part of you it
[1:48:13] is who you are
[1:48:15] not in part but in whole
[1:48:18] praise the Lord let's stand if we could
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:29] praise the Lord now you talk about
[1:48:31] acting different
[1:48:32] talking different looking different
[1:48:36] amen because it's who you are
[1:48:39] praise the Lord amen amen and the whole
[1:48:43] thing about that is
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:45] I know we were born in sin-shaped in
[1:48:47] World speaking lies but it isn't even by
[1:48:51] true Revelation by true god-given
[1:48:54] Revelation it really isn't even what you
[1:48:56] have become it is who you always were
[1:49:01] amen it's who you always were
[1:49:05] because you all you never were when
[1:49:08] brother Adam says you never get it did
[1:49:10] it it means you never were that old
[1:49:12] person you were always
[1:49:15] this right here
[1:49:16] always
[1:49:18] amen
[1:49:19] praise the Lord all let's sing this
[1:49:22] course to him before we go today
[1:49:24] amen Lord prepare me my body is the
[1:49:28] Temple of the Holy Ghost amen and God
[1:49:31] has made me to that purpose
[1:49:33] so many times I see people around I
[1:49:36] usually even have a guy that worked with
[1:49:38] us and he said he was a Christian went
[1:49:40] to a charismatic nominal church
[1:49:42] somewhere of actually Pennsylvania he
[1:49:45] come back one time uh when he was on our
[1:49:48] team
[1:49:49] eight ten months ago and he had a big
[1:49:52] cross tattooed on his arm I'm like why
[1:49:54] did you do that
[1:49:55] well that's just a representation of my
[1:49:57] papers you think God really liked you to
[1:50:00] scar up the temple that he's supposed to
[1:50:02] be housed in with
[1:50:04] with ink with the scarring on your body
[1:50:08] I I don't I don't understand but there's
[1:50:10] a lot of
[1:50:12] there's a lot of nominal Christian
[1:50:14] churches out there that believe that
[1:50:16] that's okay now you know and when those
[1:50:18] things happen before you except Christ I
[1:50:20] understand you know that all things have
[1:50:22] happened to us before life I get that
[1:50:25] you we bear the scars physically
[1:50:27] mentally or emotionally of things that
[1:50:29] we did when we were questions
[1:50:32] but but when you become one and what my
[1:50:37] preacher says that's okay the Bible
[1:50:39] doesn't say us
[1:50:41] first you need to take whatever new
[1:50:43] international revise of their revised
[1:50:45] new edition of the revised edition of
[1:50:47] somebody's opinion and throw it in the
[1:50:49] garbage
[1:50:51] because it's not a good it's not the
[1:50:53] scripture right
[1:50:56] right but we are to be sanctuaries of
[1:50:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:51:00] amen pure holy
[1:51:03] amen we struggle to it every day we work
[1:51:06] toward it every day amen as humans
[1:51:09] because the black and the white dog or
[1:51:13] but we're always to be what God made us
[1:51:15] let's sing it amen
[1:51:19] Lord
[1:51:22] prepare me give me a sanctuary
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:33] will be

[1:55:36] have to be a young person to go but if
[1:55:38] you want to go attend let me know I'll

[1:55:44] flyer if you will it's online so yeah if
[1:55:47] it's something you want to attend
[1:55:49] if anybody else does then just let me
[1:55:51] know I'll send it to you text it to you
[1:55:54] also
[1:55:56] remember uh Zach Tabitha their
[1:55:59] anniversary was yesterday uh Dennis and
[1:56:02] Danny just had a birthday so
[1:56:05] happy anniversary happy birthday to you
[1:56:08] brother Danny is here uh Dennis who is
[1:56:11] not here praise the lord it's amazing
[1:56:13] how y'all's birthdays are on the same
[1:56:14] day every year but happy birthday okay I
[1:56:18] guess it'll be that way till you die huh
[1:56:23] praise the Lord so very happy birthday
[1:56:26] to Dennis and Danny so thankful that
[1:56:28] happened with us uh also after
[1:56:31] consideration and thinking about all
[1:56:33] options and everything
[1:56:34] I'm going to cancel next Sunday service
[1:56:37] I'm flying out at 6 00 a.m in the
[1:56:39] morning uh to uh go back to Pennsylvania
[1:56:44] absolutely no flights nothing available
[1:56:46] nothing that was going to work as far as
[1:56:49] flying so I'm flying out at 6 a.m and I
[1:56:53] appreciate all the input I appreciate
[1:56:55] all everything that everyone
[1:56:57] 's Jester said Mike is not going to be
[1:57:00] here next Sunday so I just I kind of
[1:57:04] felt leaning towards canceling anyway
[1:57:07] but I hate feeling like I'm letting
[1:57:09] everybody down but then after Mike had
[1:57:13] mentioned that he wasn't going to have
[1:57:14] some of my mind I remembered you saying
[1:57:16] that that just didn't connect it
[1:57:18] I just didn't feel to leave the whole
[1:57:21] service burden on Zach so
[1:57:23] um so next Sunday we'll just cancel the
[1:57:27] 20th I'm not going to make this uh
[1:57:31] a common thing though so I don't feel
[1:57:35] like that this is going to happen
[1:57:37] because it's not
[1:57:39] um
[1:57:40] if this becomes an issue I'll quit
[1:57:43] but I don't think I don't believe it's
[1:57:45] going to do it I think this is just a
[1:57:46] one-time thing
[1:57:48] so just keep in your mind remember I'll
[1:57:50] try to remember to let everybody know
[1:57:52] next week but there will be no service
[1:57:56] here if you want to
[1:57:57] visit other place
[1:58:00] watch some of the old sermons we watched
[1:58:03] today's message again if you'll wonder
[1:58:05] feel free to do as you feel led of the
[1:58:08] Lord and just pray the Lord really the
[1:58:10] best unit we'll see you again on August
[1:58:12] 27th
[1:58:15] so I trust and pray that's okay I
[1:58:18] apologize if I'm hurting anybody or
[1:58:19] letting anybody down um
[1:58:21] sorry about that
[1:58:23] again a one-time thing but I certainly
[1:58:27] appreciate everyone's understanding
[1:58:29] so Lord reach to bless you and thank you
[1:58:33] for all
[1:58:34] the you do and the blessings you are it
[1:58:37] means everything to me
[1:58:39] I was going to mention this during the
[1:58:42] prayer time I forgot and I thought well
[1:58:44] I'll mention next time but there won't
[1:58:46] be a next service but the Lord really
[1:58:50] helps on these trips that I go but I'm
[1:58:53] just having a hard time sleeping on
[1:58:57] these trips and I'd appreciate your
[1:58:58] prayers about that

[1:59:04] single night is maybe five hours tops

[1:59:24] got three hours sleep I come home
