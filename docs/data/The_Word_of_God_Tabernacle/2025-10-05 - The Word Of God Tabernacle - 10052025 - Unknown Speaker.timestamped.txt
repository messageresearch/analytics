[23:07] talks about Paul and Silas in the prison
[23:09] and how they were beaten so bad they

[23:13] Lord. And when they opened their eyes,
[23:15] they were going to see Jesus. Amen. But
[23:17] yet they were in that horrible, horrible

[23:26] the Lord."
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; I will praise the Lord. Just like Paul
[23:31] and Silas did in that innermost prison.

[23:41] today brings, no matter what tomorrow
[23:43] might be, I will praise the Lord. No
[23:46] matter my circumstances, no matter how I
[23:49] feel, no matter how things look, no
[23:51] matter what the world's condition, I
[23:54] will praise the Lord.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Is that your desire
[24:00] today, saints?

[27:17] Just uh enter these with a prayerful
[27:19] heart.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Just expecting the Lord to deliver to
[27:23] meet these needs. Amen. I got a text
[27:25] from Sister Julie this morning. uh her
[27:28] sister Kristen I guess
[27:31] ruptured her Achilles tendon in her
[27:33] foot. So she had surgery on that foot
[27:35] and her foot is uh well you know the
[27:39] Achilles tendon is basically useless
[27:41] from the you know foot up even into the
[27:43] calf. Her foot's wrapped up. So Julie
[27:45] stays home to take care of her and to
[27:47] help her there today. So please remember
[27:50] sister Julie Sister Kristen in prayer.
[27:52] Amen. I will say one thing about uh
[27:55] Kristen. She helped us move when we
[27:58] moved into this place and uh she's never
[28:01] set foot in church, but she pays her
[28:03] tithes faithfully.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, it's just it's just the
[28:10] grace of God. God blesses her for it,
[28:12] too. I know that. Amen. Because that's
[28:14] the promise of his word. But yes,
[28:16] &gt;&gt; she's never been to one single service.
[28:19] Amen. But in her heart, she has it that
[28:21] uh she does She does that. Uh she does
[28:25] pay her ties. So we're thankful for her.
[28:28] So please remember uh Julie staying home
[28:30] with her and her uh speed of recovery
[28:33] for her sister Kristen. Also got a text
[28:35] to talk to Danny the other day. Um he is
[28:39] doing good. He's back home. Uh he did
[28:42] have to have all of his toes removed. Uh
[28:45] but he was giving God thanks in the in
[28:47] the text to me. He was giving God thanks
[28:49] for uh he said he had not gotten to the
[28:53] hospital when he did, the doctor said he
[28:54] might have died. Uh so we're very
[28:57] thankful that you know how the
[28:59] infections are that get in your body and
[29:01] um you know if you don't catch him just
[29:03] in time if that infection gets certain
[29:06] place and and over a certain percentage
[29:08] of body something there's nothing
[29:10] doctors can do at that point. Uh but the
[29:13] doctor did tell him it's good thing he
[29:14] came when he did and he's thankful that
[29:17] the infection didn't get into the bone
[29:18] and uh that uh all and that all he did
[29:22] was lose his toes. So, he was very
[29:25] thankful that all that happened was uh
[29:27] all of his toes on his left foot. So,
[29:30] amen. But we want to remember brother
[29:32] Danny in prayer. The Lord would grant
[29:34] him a speedy recovery. The Lord would
[29:36] bless him. Also got a text yesterday
[29:38] from Tabitha. Uh she said that Emma is
[29:40] not feeling well today or wasn't feeling
[29:43] well yesterday. So, please remember her
[29:44] in prayer. She had a fever. uh very uh
[29:48] serious symptoms, flu symptoms I guess
[29:51] it was uh in her body. So please
[29:53] remember him in prayer today as well. Uh
[29:56] also please remember Pats in prayer.
[29:59] Sister Pat spent a couple days in the
[30:00] hospital again. Uh she had an infected
[30:03] liver and uh heart congenital heart
[30:07] failure, congestive heart failure.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh I didn't I didn't get a
[30:14] text. I hadn't talked to brother Pat uh
[30:17] but I did see a Facebook that he put out
[30:20] uh thanking the Lord for sister Pat
[30:23] being back home from the hospital and
[30:25] what had happened. So uh but she is
[30:27] feeling better. She is doing good. She's
[30:29] recovering well according to her text uh
[30:32] from her hip surgery. Uh but we
[30:34] certainly definitely want to continue
[30:36] remember Sister Pat in prayer the Lord
[30:38] would just touch them. Amen. And
[30:40] remember sister Sheilia today, she
[30:42] wasn't sure if she was coming down with
[30:44] some symptoms or if it was allergies or
[30:46] what, but she uh wasn't feeling well, so
[30:48] she stayed home today as well. So please
[30:50] remember sister in prayer. I was going
[30:52] to give God thanks for sister Leah's uh
[30:55] surgery, but I'll let brother Dennis do
[30:57] that.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I thank the Lord. I asked
[31:01] her yesterday and this morning, how you
[31:04] doing? She's recovering very well.
[31:07] That's the Lord's touch. Um, otherwise I
[31:10] would have stayed home to take care of
[31:12] her.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; But she says, "No, I'm fine. Go to
[31:14] church." I said, "That's where I want to
[31:16] be."
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; So, I thank the Lord. She's coming
[31:20] along. She gets very tired. I says, "You
[31:22] need to rest." And she does hurt and but
[31:26] she's just taking Tylenol, not those
[31:29] stronger meds for pain. So, thank the
[31:32] Lord.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. you know, she had
[31:35] that constructive surgery uh on the 2nd,
[31:39] October 2nd. So thankful. I knew that
[31:42] things must have been going well.
[31:45] My wife, she said, I guess brother
[31:47] Dennis won't be there today when she's
[31:48] had the surgery. She usually likes to
[31:50] stay with her. But I said, I haven't got
[31:52] a text from him. I said, if I had got a
[31:54] text from him, he's going to be there.
[31:55] So I knew if you were going to be here
[31:57] that she was okay. So thank you for
[31:59] that.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So praise the Lord. Glad glad the
[32:03] Lord is mindful of us. Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.

[32:13] sister. I usually try to look and it's
[32:15] hardly ever anything over here and then
[32:17] I forget to look

[32:32] can do it. I'm asking mercy for Amanda.
[32:35] Also, uh Daniel's grandchildren, um uh

[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless. Man
[34:01] works hard. So, and especially with his
[34:04] back, working man needs his back,
[34:07] Saints. That's for sure.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; I know that feeling sometimes
[34:12] pretty be pretty brutal sometimes. So,
[34:16] continue to remember our prayer. We've
[34:18] had this request and we just need
[34:20] perfect deliverance for him. Anyone else
[34:26] have an unspoken request
[34:29] today.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, it is a
[34:42] privilege to be once again in your
[34:44] house. worship, your house of prayer, a
[34:47] house where the revealed word is
[34:50] preached, a message you have sent to get
[34:53] a bride ready for church.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; I just heard as I was driving to church,
[34:59] uh, Brother Brown was speaking that God
[35:01] would rather that we live a sermon
[35:05] than preach the sermon.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; And Father, this is the age of
[35:10] perfection where you can come and live
[35:12] in your bride. Yes.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Where your bride can reflect Jesus
[35:17] Christ in everything that she does.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, God.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; And I heard you probably also say that
[35:23] we must put God first.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; He must be first in our finances where
[35:30] 10% belongs to you, Father. That's your
[35:33] word. And you said as you as we pay our
[35:37] tithes, you'll pour out a blessing more
[35:41] than what we're able to see.
[35:44] We must put you first, Father, as we
[35:48] have a church service. As the prophet
[35:51] said that it if Christ is truly in your
[35:55] heart, you can't wait for those church
[35:58] doors to open up. If you don't feel that
[36:01] way, then it's time to to get to praying
[36:06] and seeking God that God will be first
[36:10] when it comes to being at the house of
[36:14] worship.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Lord, we must put you
[36:18] first when it comes to
[36:22] fellowshipping
[36:23] with believers and fellowshipping with
[36:26] you and and your word. Lord, we must not
[36:31] let the world bring us down. Even though
[36:35] we have loved ones that that love us,
[36:39] but if they're ungodly and worthy,
[36:42] they'll take the very Christ out of our
[36:45] lives that we're not careful.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; We must put you first in everything.
[36:51] Lord,
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. You know our lives better
[36:55] than what we know of ourselves.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; You know our heart better than what we
[37:01] know of ourselves. Yes. The Bible says a
[37:04] heart is deceitfully wicked. Who can
[37:07] know it?
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we cannot
[37:11] hide anything from you. We may be able
[37:14] to hide it from the pastor, from the
[37:18] congregation, from all the people that's
[37:20] around us. But if we're not living that
[37:23] life, we cannot hide it from you. Help
[37:26] us, Lord, to repent and get right with
[37:30] you while your grace is sufficient. The
[37:34] blood is still on the mercy seat.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; You said in your word, if we confess our
[37:40] sins, you are faithful and just to
[37:43] forgive us our sins and cleanse us from
[37:46] all unrighteousness. Thank you, Lord.
[37:48] And Father, there are needs, serious
[37:51] needs. There are several that's had
[37:54] surgeries, serious surgeries. Father,
[37:57] sister had my brother Danny, my wife
[38:01] Leah.
[38:02] Oh Lord, if I overlooked someone that
[38:05] had served you recently, oh, sister
[38:08] Sharia's friend Cara, Lord, may you come
[38:12] on the scene and continue to give them a
[38:16] a complete
[38:18] healing from what they have endured.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. But we know, Lord, there's
[38:24] no uh disease, there's no affliction
[38:28] that can stand before you, for you'll
[38:31] defeat them all.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; For thou are the high priest that can be
[38:35] touched by the feelings of our
[38:37] infirmities. Thank you, Jesus.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And by your stripes, we are healed.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And Lord, all the other requests, I
[38:45] can't remember them all, but they were
[38:47] spoken. You heard them. That's what's
[38:50] the most important, Lord, cuz you heard
[38:53] them. You're mindful of them. May you
[38:55] come on the scene and grant each and
[38:58] everyone their need from you. May their
[39:02] cup runth over. May that healing virtue
[39:06] waters flow continually, Father.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Grant it, God. Amen.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless our pastor. He's worked a
[39:14] full week. He's tired, but Father, he's
[39:16] a faithful servant of yours. May you use
[39:19] him to bring forth your word. May your
[39:22] word fall on our hearts, Father, in good
[39:25] ground where it'll help us to draw
[39:28] closer to you.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Help us to get ready. The rapture, I
[39:32] believe, is imminent. It's knocking at
[39:35] the door, Lord. It's not time to play
[39:37] church. Amen. It's not time to play
[39:39] games with you. It's time to get right
[39:42] with you. Lord Grant, Lord, bless each
[39:44] and every unspoken request for everyone
[39:47] that has a need. Father, in your name we
[39:50] pray. Name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[39:56] seated if you'd like.
[39:58] Amen.
[40:01] I uh usually make sure and
[40:05] give the prayer requests and always
[40:08] forget myself.
[40:10] I'm supposed to go Wednesday. I
[40:12] appreciate your prayers. I'm supposed to
[40:13] go Wednesday for a dental appointment.
[40:15] I'm supposed to get a root canal and two
[40:17] extractions on Wednesday. So, I
[40:19] appreciate your prayers for that. Um,
[40:22] why you do it all at one time? Well,
[40:24] kind of. It's all on the same side of
[40:25] the mouth. So, long as I got half my
[40:27] mouth, I'm
[40:30] &gt;&gt; wor. But, uh, I appreciate your prayers
[40:33] for that. I thought this tooth in here
[40:35] that I was supposed to have the root
[40:36] canal on was getting infected this week,
[40:38] and it was. It was. It was infected.
[40:40] I've had it happen before. I've had
[40:42] abscesses before and I could feel it
[40:45] infected. My ear was popping and my
[40:47] gland was tender and sore and uh it was
[40:51] getting a little puffy and hurting so
[40:52] bad. Uh I was taking
[40:57] uh 2,000 milligrams of uh acetaminophen
[41:00] at one time just to try to dull it. Uh
[41:04] but uh by the grace of God told my wife
[41:07] I said you know that it was it was
[41:10] feeling bad and uh I just kept working
[41:13] but it was feeling bad and u I think it
[41:17] was Friday morning I can't remember it
[41:19] was Friday and uh it wasn't so bad the
[41:22] infection felt okay and the swelling
[41:25] gone down and the gland was still a
[41:27] little swollen but it wasn't or it was
[41:29] it wasn't as swollen but it was still a
[41:31] little tender
[41:33] But uh yesterday it was all fine. Flew
[41:36] in flew on the plane and today uh
[41:39] there's no swelling and there's no
[41:41] tenderness and my ears not popping up. I
[41:43] don't feel like it's just just normal.
[41:45] But um so I'm thankful to God because if
[41:48] there was an infection they wouldn't
[41:49] have been able to do anything Wednesday
[41:52] and it's stuff that I need to get done.
[41:53] So uh so I appreciate the Lord's
[41:56] goodness. Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; So that's a prayer request and a
[41:59] testimony at the same time. So thank you
[42:01] for that. Amen. Just thank the Lord
[42:03] Jesus for blessings. Amen. He's mindful,
[42:06] isn't he?
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; It's just it's just people just don't
[42:11] People just don't understand. They just
[42:13] don't know what they're missing when
[42:14] they by not serving the Lord Jesus. He's
[42:17] so good to us.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Psalm number 196.
[42:23] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. You know, I
[42:27] guess there's there's one on here. Was
[42:29] you going to sing this as a special?
[42:30] Let's let Micah sing this special first.
[42:33] Amen. We might hold the other one till
[42:34] after service. Amen. Micah's got a
[42:37] special he wants to sing here. So goes
[42:38] right in with the service. So just pray
[42:41] the Lord bless him now.
[42:46] [Music]
[42:52] This is a song I've seen before several
[42:54] times and rarely do I sing a song based
[42:58] off of the that daddy gave me. But as
[43:00] soon as I saw the list, this came to
[43:02] mind. So I was like, I'll sing.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; So sing along. Bless
[43:13] [Music]

[43:25] mountain seems so tall and you realize
[43:30] life's not always fair.
[43:34] You can run away and hide. Let the old
[43:39] man decide.
[43:41] Or you can change your circumstances
[43:44] with a prayer.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] When everything falls apart.

[43:58] heart,
[44:00] I raise your hands and say,
[44:03] "Lord, you're all I need.
[44:06] You're everything to me." And he'll take

[44:55] And the mountain seems so tall and you
[44:59] realize
[45:01] life's not always fair.
[45:05] You can run away and hide.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; But the old man decides or you can
[45:11] change your circumstances
[45:14] with a fair.
[45:18] When everything falls apart,
[45:23] raise his name. When you have a broken
[45:27] heart,
[45:28] raise your hands and say, "Lord, you're
[45:32] all I need.
[45:34] You're everything to me." And he'll take
[45:38] the Hallelujah.

[45:43] And when it seems you're all alone,
[45:48] praise his name. When you feel you can't

[46:18] Oh,
[46:19] you can overcome
[46:21] by the blood of the lamb and by the
[46:26] words of your testimony.
[46:29] [Music]
[46:31] You'll see the darkness go as your faith
[46:35] begins to grow. You're not alone. So,
[46:39] how can you leave on me
[46:44] when everything falls apart?
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.

[46:57] all I need.
[46:59] You're everything to me. It'll take the
[47:03] pain away."
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Praise you, Jesus.
[47:08] And when it seems you're all alone,
[47:12] praise his name. When you feel you can't
[47:16] go on,
[47:18] raise your hands and sing
[47:23] that is within me. And you can raise the
[47:27] birds away.
[47:30] [Music]
[47:36] You just praise his name.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Gater is he that is within me. And you
[47:48] can praise the words away.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.

[48:35] or something on your heart today?
[48:50] your car.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Usually they'll prorrate it
[49:15] or something. They won't necessarily
[49:16] give you a free one.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] Well, wonderful. God is good. Amen.

[49:32] our feet and amen.
[49:35] Go to the scripture now.
[49:39] Pardon me.
[49:43] Amen. We're going to turn over to Romans
[49:44] chapter 8.
[49:46] Amen. Start here back with adoption part
[49:50] 29 fivefold ministry part two.
[49:55] Amen. So adoption part 29 fivefold
[49:59] ministry part two. We want to delve in
[50:02] today. We're going to start again with
[50:03] Romans chapter 8. Read the same few
[50:06] verses of scripture 14-1 17 on our
[50:09] adoption series that we've been talking
[50:12] about.
[50:13] Amen. And just trust the Lord bless it
[50:16] today. Amen. So let's just bow our heads
[50:18] if we could now. Another word of prayer.
[50:21] Father God, again we approach your
[50:23] precious holy throne, Lord. Thanking you
[50:25] so much again for the wonderful song
[50:27] service, Lord, and just worshiping and
[50:29] praising you, God. Lord, even at this
[50:32] point, we just I do just feel so scoured
[50:35] out, Lord. Just in my spirit, just
[50:37] worshiping and praising you, Lord.
[50:39] Lord, lifting up your name and exalting
[50:42] you, Jesus. It brings you on the scene
[50:44] and feeling your presence so near, God
[50:46] is so wonderful, Lord. It just it just
[50:49] means so much. Sometimes I just I wish
[50:51] my voice would just would just keep
[50:53] strong, Lord, so I could just keep
[50:55] worshiping and singing. It's just so
[50:57] beautiful, Lord, to enter into your
[50:59] presence and worship and glorify you,
[51:01] Lord. Just being in that presence just
[51:03] feels so good, Father. Especially after
[51:05] you've been in the world all week and
[51:08] gone through the things and work and
[51:09] everything and all the the the uh
[51:13] demonic forces of hell in this world and
[51:16] things that you listen to and hear and
[51:18] put up with and oh God, it just feels so
[51:21] good, Lord, just to get into that place
[51:23] of worship and your presence. And God,
[51:26] just realize that is those heavenly
[51:29] places in Christ Jesus you told us
[51:31] about, Lord, that we stand in, that we
[51:33] get into. And Lord, we're just so
[51:35] thankful to be in that place again today
[51:37] in this place. And so thankful, God,
[51:40] that you give it to us, Lord. Now, we
[51:42] just pray that your Holy Spirit would
[51:44] once again take complete control of this
[51:46] service, Lord, as your word would come
[51:48] forth and take control of this vessel.
[51:50] Speak only what you'd have us to hear,
[51:52] Lord. And Lord, shut my mouth to
[51:54] anything that you would not have to be
[51:56] said, God. And just bless this, Lord,
[51:59] your uh people, Lord, and this word as
[52:01] it comes forth.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, may it come forth in power and
[52:04] manifestation of your spirit and help it
[52:07] find its bedding ground in the hearts of
[52:09] your people. Anchor it in us, Lord. Help
[52:11] us to draw closer to you, more like you
[52:13] in this last day through it, Lord, and
[52:16] recognize your word is eternal in
[52:18] heaven. And God, we believe and thank
[52:20] you for that word. God, reveal it to us
[52:23] now as we commit it to you. Let it not
[52:25] return void. Accomplish in each of us
[52:28] that you would have it to accomplish. In
[52:30] the precious, holy, and lovely name of
[52:32] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we
[52:34] pray. Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Romans 8:14,
[52:42] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[52:44] God, they are the sons of God. For ye
[52:47] have not received the spirit of bondage
[52:49] again to fear, but ye have received the
[52:52] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[52:54] "Abby, Father." The spirit itself
[52:56] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[52:58] are the children of God. And if
[53:00] children, then hes of God and joint hes
[53:04] with Christ. If so, be that we suffer
[53:07] with him that we may be also glorified
[53:10] together.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. I
[53:14] want to go back over, of course, to
[53:16] Ephesians. Amen. And pick up try to pick
[53:19] up back up a little bit where we left
[53:20] off last week
[53:23] in Ephesians. We're not going to read
[53:24] the whole chapter this time. Amen. But I
[53:27] just want to start with the 11th verse
[53:29] and begin there uh and try to delve back
[53:33] into this five-fold ministry as we've
[53:35] gone through and recognizing and seeing
[53:37] the purpose and needfulness of of the
[53:41] ministry of preaching of preaching the
[53:43] gospel. Uh people they're unbelievers,
[53:47] scoffers, atheists think the preaching
[53:49] of the gospel is foolishness. And a lot
[53:51] of people think of to the foolishness of
[53:54] them that believe that preaching is is
[53:56] is foolish. Uh to us it's glorious.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing. Amen. It's good that
[54:03] the Lord speak to us from his word and
[54:05] we know that to be the truth. So, amen.
[54:08] We're going to get back to that today.
[54:10] The Lord really Now, uh Ro uh Ephesians
[54:13] uh chapter 4. We're going to start again
[54:16] uh like I said with the 11th verse and
[54:18] try to pick up where we left off. We may
[54:20] background just a tad bit, not a whole
[54:22] lot. Amen. But try to pick up and move
[54:25] forward with what uh I want to speak
[54:27] today. Now 11th verse, Ephesians 4:11.
[54:31] And he gave some apostles
[54:33] and some prophets and some evangelists
[54:36] and some pastors and teachers. Now
[54:39] again, the three things, verse 12, the
[54:42] three things that the Lord gave this
[54:44] five-fold ministry for that we talk
[54:46] about for the perfecting of the saints.
[54:49] We know what that perfecting is.
[54:51] Remember that perfecting is the
[54:52] edifying. Amen. Uh the uh the the
[54:56] building up, the bringing this to
[54:59] helping us get. Now uh as we said the
[55:02] other day, this perfecting is a
[55:05] different word than the perfect that
[55:07] Jesus talks about in Matthew 5:48. But
[55:11] it it but it is uh if I can say it this
[55:14] way in my uh I guess hillbilly
[55:17] vernacular it is akin to that word the
[55:20] same. It is not sinless perfection but
[55:23] it's a growing up. It's a edifying. It's
[55:26] a building. It's a getting to that place
[55:29] where we as as children are are no
[55:32] longer children but grown-ups.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say that in relation to of
[55:38] course the word that says perfect on
[55:39] down here. the 13th verse, unto a
[55:42] perfect man brings us to this
[55:44] understanding. Not sinless perfection,
[55:47] but a grownup mature person. Amen. And
[55:50] that's what this edifying is to do.
[55:52] That's why it's a different root word,
[55:54] if you will, or a or a different uh uh
[55:57] meaning. Uh because this perfecting is
[56:00] to is to bring to that place of
[56:03] perfection. Bring to a place that you're
[56:06] perfect or grown up. Amen. There's got
[56:09] to be an edifying. There's got to be a
[56:11] building. There's got to be a growth
[56:14] before you can get to the place of that
[56:16] maturity just like any child that's
[56:19] born. Amen. Of of of in normal human uh
[56:24] way that child has to grow up. They get
[56:28] older and they learn and they become
[56:30] more mature and they get physically
[56:32] mature and they get uh mentally mature
[56:35] and as it grows and they get to a place
[56:37] that they come to the position of
[56:39] adulthood. Now if that child is trained
[56:41] correctly and that child learns
[56:44] correctly when they get to the place of
[56:46] adulthood they become an adult not just
[56:49] a child in a big body. Amen. which
[56:52] unfortunately a lot of times you get
[56:54] spiritually and physically big children.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Uh spiritually it's a horrible thing
[57:01] because it it's always the constant
[57:03] whining and crying and and and all
[57:05] instead of just speaking the word. Amen.
[57:08] Just instead of knowing your position,
[57:11] knowing who you are and speaking that
[57:13] word and taking authority over the
[57:15] position that you are in, knowing who
[57:17] you are.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Instead of whining and crying about it,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; right? But now a a an adult that's still
[57:24] a child is is bad naturally because it's
[57:29] a child in a in a big body. They haven't
[57:31] matured. They haven't grown. They
[57:33] haven't learned. They haven't been
[57:34] taught. They haven't got to that place.
[57:36] That's why I read that uh verse uh that
[57:39] um uh quote last week about brother
[57:43] Brandham saying, "Well, the reason it is
[57:45] this way is because they've not been
[57:46] taught. They don't know. If you don't
[57:50] know, how do you know? You can't know
[57:52] unless you know. You can't hold somebody
[57:54] responsible for something they don't
[57:56] know. That's why it's essential that the
[57:59] ministry
[58:01] perfects the saints.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; To bring them to a knowledge of
[58:05] understanding. Amen. Knowledge. That's
[58:08] why it talks about in here in the 13th
[58:11] verse, the knowledge. Amen. We're going
[58:14] to go over to uh Peter when we talk
[58:16] about that statue of a perfect man and
[58:18] recognize that it's contin Peter
[58:20] continually mentions that word knowledge
[58:23] to bring us to that place. Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; The only way you get there that's how
[58:28] you do it
[58:30] having having spiritual children with no
[58:34] supernatural guidance is like having a
[58:37] natural to ch child born with no
[58:39] parents. right
[58:41] &gt;&gt; now. They now obviously they have to
[58:43] give a a woman has to give birth to a
[58:46] child, but that doesn't mean that that
[58:48] child has parents. That doesn't mean
[58:50] that that child might have a father that
[58:52] fathered that child, but that doesn't
[58:54] mean that father is a dad is the way I
[58:57] put it. To me, a dad and a father are
[59:00] two different things. Amen. You can
[59:02] father a child and hit the road, but to
[59:06] be a dad, you've got to be there and
[59:08] you've got to raise that child and
[59:09] you've got to uh be a dad and a strong a
[59:12] masculine influence in that home for
[59:14] that child to be raised right.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; That that that's why the hand of God is
[59:19] upon us to do the same thing to us.
[59:22] Well, the same thing spiritual, same
[59:24] thing natural. If a child's born into
[59:26] this world and has no parents, what's
[59:28] that child going to turn out to be?
[59:30] They're probably going to be one of
[59:32] these bums laying out on the side of the
[59:33] road with no purpose or meaning in life
[59:35] and just letting their life waste away.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing spiritually. Amen.
[59:43] There's got to be a growth. There's got
[59:46] to be spiritual perfecting. There's got
[59:48] to be edifying. The five-fold ministry
[59:50] is there to edify and to help
[59:54] be an instrument of God that through
[59:56] that instrument brings that perfecting
[59:58] to the saints. That edifying through the
[1:00:01] preaching of the gospel,
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; the preaching of the good news, the
[1:00:05] preaching of the word is to bring them
[1:00:07] to that place of perfection, the
[1:00:09] perfecting of the saints, edifying.
[1:00:12] Amen. Building up, teaching them. Let
[1:00:15] them learn. Let them grow. Don't let
[1:00:18] them go forth not knowing, but teach
[1:00:21] them. That's why I said that quote I
[1:00:24] read last week. They don't know because
[1:00:25] they hadn't been taught.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; I and I told y'all every anytime I've
[1:00:31] seen that, brother Ram says that a
[1:00:33] couple times in the message, I take that
[1:00:35] very seriously.
[1:00:37] Uh because I don't want to fail in that
[1:00:40] position.
[1:00:41] Amen. If a child needs to learn manners,
[1:00:44] the parent needs to teach it manners.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; If the child needs to learn discipline,
[1:00:49] it's the parent that's to teach that
[1:00:51] child discipline.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; If that child needs to be reigned in and
[1:00:55] learn how to be in a restaurant or
[1:00:57] wherever, they then that's the parents
[1:00:59] there to teach them that. And sometimes
[1:01:01] it's hard.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, it is hard. Not just sometimes.
[1:01:05] It's hard uh especially when you have to
[1:01:08] uh uh enact some kind of uh judgment on
[1:01:12] that child like a little protoplasm
[1:01:15] stimulation.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; But it's good for that child. That child
[1:01:19] will respect you. They may hurt and they
[1:01:21] may say, "Oh, I don't like daddy for
[1:01:23] five minutes." But they'll respect you
[1:01:25] for that
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; because they know that you wouldn't do
[1:01:28] that if you didn't really love them.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a parent that really loves
[1:01:32] their child will correct their child.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. and make sure that child is raised
[1:01:37] right.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Make sure that child has manners and and
[1:01:40] God does the same thing for us
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; to make sure that we are raised in the
[1:01:45] nurture and admonition of God just like
[1:01:47] a a a little child is.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Perfecting that five-fold ministry for
[1:01:53] the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:01:55] work of the ministry. Now notice,
[1:01:58] excuse me,
[1:02:00] um the the word is that's said here. It
[1:02:04] says for the work of the singular
[1:02:08] ministry.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Now we'll we'll eventually probably and
[1:02:13] maybe the next t today next service
[1:02:16] probably the next two or three services
[1:02:19] talk a lot about the unity of the body.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. the togetherness of this group,
[1:02:28] the work of the ministry. Yes. You say
[1:02:31] work of the ministries because there's
[1:02:34] five of them. No, there's five offices,
[1:02:38] but there's one work.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Just like God, there's three offices,
[1:02:44] father, son, holy ghost, but there's one
[1:02:46] God,
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; There's five offices. There's pastor,
[1:02:50] evangelist, missionary, teacher,
[1:02:52] prophet. There's five offices, but
[1:02:54] there's one work of the ministry,
[1:02:57] singular work of a ministry, and that's
[1:02:59] how these each one of these offices is
[1:03:03] supposed to work together in continuity.
[1:03:06] Uh we talked about when uh I've done
[1:03:11] this before, but when brother Brandham
[1:03:13] showed brother Green about the five-fold
[1:03:15] ministry, you know, he used his hand and
[1:03:18] how he did that. I probably won't do
[1:03:19] that today, but that hand is just one
[1:03:22] hand. It has five fingers.
[1:03:25] And you and you get this little pointer
[1:03:27] finger over here, which is the which is
[1:03:29] the uh evangelist. And you get that
[1:03:32] little pointer finger, and he says,
[1:03:33] "Well, I want to do this and this. I
[1:03:34] want I want to get away from the hand."
[1:03:36] Well, if this finger gets away from the
[1:03:38] hand, it dies.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; This finger can't exist without the
[1:03:42] hand.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; This hand can't exist without this arm.
[1:03:45] This arm can't exist without this body.
[1:03:46] His body can't exist without his head,
[1:03:48] without this heart. It all has to work
[1:03:50] together. But it's one hand,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Five fingers. The thumb might say,
[1:03:55] "Well, you know, I want to." No, no.
[1:03:57] This pastor, he has to say, "Well, I'm
[1:03:59] the pastor." No, but this pastor has to
[1:04:01] work together with this evangelist and
[1:04:04] with this apostle and with this teacher.
[1:04:06] They have to all work together. Amen.
[1:04:09] All this whole everything has to work in
[1:04:12] continuity. That's why it's one
[1:04:14] ministry. That's why he said when you
[1:04:16] take that five-fold ministry and they're
[1:04:18] working together in continuity and you
[1:04:21] bring them all together and you seal it
[1:04:22] up there, you can give the devil a good
[1:04:25] walk with it.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; The five-fold ministry.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's working as a
[1:04:31] ministry, not ministries,
[1:04:35] not multiple, one ministry. Body
[1:04:38] together, unity together as one. They're
[1:04:42] supposed to work together, not against
[1:04:44] each other,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it does. And and in
[1:04:47] God's ministry, that's the way it works.
[1:04:50] They complement each other in God's
[1:04:52] ministry. Now, like I said last week, if
[1:04:55] God if if God is if that is not a God
[1:04:58] called man, God has no obligation to
[1:05:01] that to that man to keep that man
[1:05:04] straight.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; God has no obligation to that man
[1:05:07] because he didn't call him. if the
[1:05:09] denomination call them or if they call
[1:05:11] themselves or they're up there doing it
[1:05:14] because they think this that or the
[1:05:15] other. Having the gift of gab does not
[1:05:18] make you a preacher.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just being able to spout off words
[1:05:22] and being able to talk in front of
[1:05:24] people does not make you a minister.
[1:05:26] Does not make you a preacher. But a lot
[1:05:29] of people still do that under those
[1:05:31] circumstances. But you must be God
[1:05:34] called. If you have not come face to
[1:05:37] face with that pillar of fire, you have
[1:05:39] no business standing behind this
[1:05:41] bullpit.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what brother Bam said.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; And that man will work with the other
[1:05:48] man that God ordained. The other man
[1:05:50] that God ordained, not denomination, not
[1:05:53] Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic,
[1:05:55] Methodist. No. What God ordained. When
[1:05:58] God ordained it, then then no matter
[1:06:00] where they are, who they are across the
[1:06:02] country, across the land, across the
[1:06:04] world, they all work together in
[1:06:06] continuity together. That's what brings
[1:06:08] this bride together as one.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Because remember, this bride is one
[1:06:13] body.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; She's this ministry is one ministry
[1:06:19] within this body bride. She's one
[1:06:22] together to bring that bride together.
[1:06:24] It all has to come together in that
[1:06:27] place of perfection
[1:06:30] in the place of unity, perfecting of the
[1:06:34] saints, work of the singular ministry
[1:06:36] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:06:40] to build up and to increase, to equip.
[1:06:46] Amen. That word is edify. To equip, to
[1:06:49] give the tools to Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Because although God uses a ministry to
[1:06:57] bring this truth, to bring this word, to
[1:06:59] preach the gospel. God can always be
[1:07:02] with you, but it's like brother Dennis
[1:07:04] prayer. You might hide it from the
[1:07:06] pastor. Amen. But God is always there.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; It's funny.
[1:07:13] These guys, we worked with a worked with
[1:07:15] a different team this week. There was
[1:07:17] three guys off their team and one of the
[1:07:19] guys had a hard hat. And guys wear their
[1:07:22] hard hats. They like putting all kinds
[1:07:23] of stickers on them. They're usually
[1:07:24] foul and nasty stickers.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; But this one kid, he had and he's fairly
[1:07:29] young. I call him kid. He's probably in
[1:07:30] his early 20s. He had a sticker on this
[1:07:33] part of his helmet that said that has a
[1:07:35] picture of Jesus and said, "I saw that."
[1:07:38] And I asked him, I said, "Where'd you
[1:07:40] get that sticker?" He said, "Oh, some
[1:07:42] guy brought him in, had a whole thing
[1:07:44] full of stickers, and I picked that
[1:07:45] one." I said, "Well, I like that
[1:07:47] sticker."
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's true. Amen. It's
[1:07:51] true. Jesus said he said, "I saw that."
[1:07:53] He does. He sees everything. But see,
[1:07:55] the pastor doesn't.
[1:07:58] Amen. The the ministry doesn't. That's
[1:08:01] why there has to be this unity, this
[1:08:03] togetherness. See, this uh uh working
[1:08:07] together for the for the entirety of the
[1:08:09] body because the body can't be saying
[1:08:13] different things. The ministry can't be
[1:08:15] saying different things. When I pray,
[1:08:17] I'll tell you how I pray. When I pray
[1:08:19] for the ministry, I pray that God bless
[1:08:22] and keep every minister that's preaching
[1:08:25] the pure, unadulterated word in the
[1:08:28] calling they were called to bring this
[1:08:31] bride to the place of perfection.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Waiting for our loved ones to
[1:08:37] appear anytime. I said that last week.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes it all together. See,
[1:08:42] there can't be this pulling back and
[1:08:44] forth. Brother Am talked about taking
[1:08:46] somebody, you know, your teammates's
[1:08:47] running to the end zone with a touchdown
[1:08:49] and his teammate comes over and he tries
[1:08:51] to grab the ball away from and try to
[1:08:53] run himself and the other one the other
[1:08:55] teammate says, "No, that's my ball." It
[1:08:57] doesn't work that way. We're on one
[1:08:59] team.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; No matter who scores the touchdown, our
[1:09:02] team got six points,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; No matter who scored it, don't matter.
[1:09:07] Don't matter if he's the shortest,
[1:09:08] tallest, fattest, skinniest, strongest,
[1:09:11] don't matter. six points to that key. So
[1:09:15] it's not us working against it. Should
[1:09:18] never be the ministry working against
[1:09:21] each other.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It should always be the ministry working
[1:09:24] together.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; there's a there's a a vast supply of
[1:09:30] material within this Bible. There's it's
[1:09:33] endless. I mean, it's eternal. It's God.
[1:09:36] God's eternal. Amen. But just the
[1:09:39] written material, there's an endless
[1:09:41] supply.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; A man could preach for a thousand years
[1:09:44] and not be able to touch every part of
[1:09:46] the scripture.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they they may be on a different
[1:09:50] subject, but we're not pulling at each
[1:09:52] other. We're not fussing. That's why I
[1:09:54] think it's so great sometimes,
[1:09:56] especially like when ministers come in
[1:09:57] here, null's done it several times, and
[1:10:00] pick up, I guess, the spirit that's in
[1:10:02] here and starts ministering a lot of a
[1:10:05] lot along the same lines that we've been
[1:10:07] talking about.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's supposed to be here November
[1:10:10] 2nd. I don't expect it to be any
[1:10:12] different.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He might take a different subject. He
[1:10:16] might read a different scripture. He
[1:10:18] might take a different quote, but the
[1:10:21] theme of it is all on the same line,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; As God is speaking to his bride
[1:10:26] internationally
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; around the world through the work of the
[1:10:29] ministry to edify, to equip. Amen.
[1:10:34] Again,
[1:10:36] there may come a time where the the
[1:10:40] ministry won't be there for you. Right?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; There may be a time where I don't have a
[1:10:46] phone in my hand to receive a text from
[1:10:48] you that says, "Pray for me."
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; There may be a time where you're
[1:10:55] isolated from anybody that you could
[1:10:58] text or have a a a text chain that says,
[1:11:01] "Pray for me or for my uh family,
[1:11:05] whatever."
[1:11:07] And it's going to fall on you
[1:11:10] to pray for yourself, to pray for your
[1:11:13] family, to pray for those circumstances,
[1:11:15] to contact God.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; It's going to be up to you to contact
[1:11:20] God. That's why the ministry is here to
[1:11:23] equip you with that ability.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. to equip you with that knowledge,
[1:11:28] to equip you with the understanding of
[1:11:30] who you are, so that when you talk to
[1:11:33] God, you know that he's listening
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; and that he hears you and that he
[1:11:37] answers your prayers.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there may not be anybody
[1:11:41] else to rely upon,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; That's why there has to be an equipping
[1:11:46] because every single individual is an
[1:11:50] individual unto God of themselves.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. As each individual finger is,
[1:11:56] you're an individual unto God. As each
[1:11:59] individual makes up this one body, we
[1:12:02] are still together. Now, that's not to
[1:12:04] say that a a a brother in
[1:12:08] China may be in need of prayer and God
[1:12:11] will put it on my heart to pray for him
[1:12:13] or put it on your heart or you may have
[1:12:16] a need and put it on somebody's heart
[1:12:18] over uh in India somewhere and put it on
[1:12:21] their heart that you need prayer. I'm
[1:12:23] not saying God can't do that because he
[1:12:24] does.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; He does it all the time, regularly.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying that what we're doing,
[1:12:30] the ministry is to equip you with the
[1:12:34] knowledge, the ability, the
[1:12:37] understanding, the faith that you and
[1:12:40] yourself can contact God Almighty as
[1:12:43] effectively as anybody else.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And and mean as much. And God respond
[1:12:51] just as well. That's why
[1:12:54] growing up in this message in truth, it
[1:12:56] really I had a I I've told you this
[1:12:59] before, but one sister that we had back
[1:13:01] in back east, uh she's she was older and
[1:13:04] she's passed away many many years ago,
[1:13:07] but so many times we get, "Oh, if
[1:13:09] Brother Brandham, we're still just here.
[1:13:10] Brother Ram just were still here." And
[1:13:13] it just never sat right with me. I knew
[1:13:16] what she meant, but my responses was,
[1:13:19] "Sister, God is still here." Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was just one vessel
[1:13:25] that was to get you to the place that
[1:13:29] vessel was to equip you.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that you had the faith that
[1:13:34] you can talk to God. You can reach God
[1:13:37] and you can get what you have need of
[1:13:39] regardless of who prays for you. It's
[1:13:41] your faith.
[1:13:43] You touch the hem of his garment.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; You notice when that woman touched the
[1:13:48] hem of his garment, he said, "Who
[1:13:50] touched me?
[1:13:52] They're like, "What do you mean who
[1:13:53] touched you? There's throngs of people
[1:13:55] turning, grabbing all over you. What do
[1:13:56] you mean who touched you?" I felt virtue
[1:13:59] come out of me,
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Strength. Something left him. Where did
[1:14:04] it go? It went into that woman who
[1:14:05] received her healing.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; He turned around and said, "You're
[1:14:09] well." He didn't pray for her.
[1:14:12] Amen. He didn't kneel down and say, "Oh,
[1:14:15] sister, where's some anointing oil? Can
[1:14:17] we find some? Would you, Peter, would
[1:14:19] you give me some oil? No, he didn't
[1:14:21] kneel down. He didn't say in in God
[1:14:25] would you father would you? No, it was
[1:14:28] her faith. He said you're well.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; All she did was touch the hem of his
[1:14:33] garment. What she touch him with? Faith.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; She touched him with a faith that
[1:14:38] brought healing to her body.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And from that moment on, she was well.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. That's the equipping. is
[1:14:47] getting us to the place that we we have
[1:14:49] the faith to believe and understand that
[1:14:52] is who we are. We let the devil beat us
[1:14:55] down so much with our little faults and
[1:14:57] failures and mistakes. Don't let the
[1:15:00] devil defeat you with that, saint.
[1:15:02] Recognize, yes, we need to get better.
[1:15:05] We all do. We're all still growing in
[1:15:07] the Lord.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; But don't let the devil pound you down
[1:15:10] with those defeats.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And ruin your faith. That's exactly what
[1:15:15] he wants to do to keep you from
[1:15:17] receiving and believing who you are, who
[1:15:20] you are in Christ. And that equipping of
[1:15:23] that truth, that message, that five-fold
[1:15:25] ministry is to bring us to that place.
[1:15:29] Equip us, edify. Edify is to equip,
[1:15:32] build up.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. To make a building.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; To make a to build a body. That body
[1:15:40] comes forth in the image of Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ. The body that Jesus Christ died
[1:15:46] for. The body that that that he's coming
[1:15:48] for again to take home to be with him.
[1:15:51] That bride body that's without spot,
[1:15:54] wrinkle, or blemish. That's who this
[1:15:55] ministry is for is to bring us to that
[1:15:57] place. Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Edify the body of the body of Christ
[1:16:04] till we all again till we all come in
[1:16:10] what? The unity. Yes.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got a piece of
[1:16:16] equipment on the job. If you've ever
[1:16:17] gone through one of our car washes, when
[1:16:19] you get twothirds of the way through the
[1:16:21] tunnel, there's this uh big blue arch
[1:16:26] and there's this place that has five uh
[1:16:30] well, it used to have five, maybe three
[1:16:31] now bars on it and it has uh water that
[1:16:36] shoots out from the front and comes in
[1:16:38] from the back and right
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; this we call that a unity arch.
[1:16:44] You know why it's called a unity arch?
[1:16:46] because it's the it's the one place
[1:16:48] where all this stuff comes together and
[1:16:51] works together to try to finalize the
[1:16:53] cleaning of your car before you get to
[1:16:55] the blowers to dry it off. It's called
[1:16:58] unity because this water comes in to do
[1:17:01] this and this water comes in to do this
[1:17:03] and this does and all this comes
[1:17:05] together. Amen. To finish that car, to
[1:17:08] complete that car before it before the
[1:17:11] blowers blow all the water off. Unity.
[1:17:14] We're to come into the unity. Praise the
[1:17:17] Lord. Where it all comes together. Oh,
[1:17:20] praise the Lord. We're to come till we
[1:17:22] all come, all of us come in the unity
[1:17:27] of the faith. We're not separated. We're
[1:17:30] not divided. Amen. Don't matter what the
[1:17:33] devil tries to do to us as a church, as
[1:17:36] ministers, as church in this city, in
[1:17:39] this state, in this country. Amen. We
[1:17:41] are all one.
[1:17:43] We're all one in this body. We're all
[1:17:45] We're all one together. Come into the
[1:17:48] unity of the faith
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; and of the here we go now. The knowledge
[1:17:53] of the son of God. Now, if you receive
[1:17:55] that knowledge, there is no uh ignorance
[1:17:58] there. There's no I well I did not know.
[1:18:02] You receive that knowledge. That's part
[1:18:05] of the ministry is to be able to receive
[1:18:07] that knowledge. Now the knowledge of the
[1:18:09] minister is just to minister and preach.
[1:18:12] What is it? We have one hour a week.
[1:18:16] So where does the rest of it fall? Now
[1:18:18] if we have two or three even if you even
[1:18:20] if we had like some churches in town and
[1:18:23] had three hours a week Sunday morning,
[1:18:25] Sunday night, Wednesday night or
[1:18:26] Thursday night, whatever it is, that's
[1:18:28] three hours. And that's still only three
[1:18:31] hours out of how many hours is in a
[1:18:33] week?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; 144. How many hours are in a week? I
[1:18:37] don't know.
[1:18:39] You got three at the most. So, where
[1:18:42] does the rest of it fall? Falls on you,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Falls on us. Some people are only
[1:18:48] Christians when they come to church.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Some people only bother to crack the
[1:18:52] covers of their Bible when they're in
[1:18:54] church.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Some people only bother to hear a quote
[1:18:56] from the prophet when they're in church.
[1:18:58] Right?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Some people only take a few minutes to
[1:19:01] pray when they're in church. And all of
[1:19:03] this should be a part of our human daily
[1:19:05] spiritual lives every day.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we grow in this in in the in
[1:19:12] the uh faith and in the knowledge of the
[1:19:14] son of God, the grace of God brings
[1:19:18] knowledge. That knowledge, not head
[1:19:20] knowledge, spiritual knowledge.
[1:19:22] Revelation. I like the word revelation
[1:19:24] better than knowledge, but that's what
[1:19:26] the Bible says, knowledge. That's how
[1:19:27] the translators translate it into
[1:19:29] knowledge. Receiving knowledge. Amen.
[1:19:32] And and there is a truth to that because
[1:19:35] as as as ministry goes forth, it it g
[1:19:39] you can gain knowledge off of that. If
[1:19:42] you receive it, if you receive it, you
[1:19:44] you've gained knowledge off of what's
[1:19:46] being said, what's being ministered,
[1:19:48] what's being preached. But it still
[1:19:50] takes God to bring it as a revelation to
[1:19:52] your heart.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I as a man can't do that. I no matter
[1:19:56] how gifted brother Brandham was, there
[1:19:59] was no way Brother Brandham could give a
[1:20:01] revelation to anybody.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; It takes God to do that.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; You can preach a truth. You can preach
[1:20:07] something till you're blue in the face.
[1:20:08] You can repeat it. You can go and give
[1:20:10] the absolute perfect scriptural
[1:20:13] interpretation, if you will, of it from
[1:20:15] God Almighty himself. But it still takes
[1:20:17] a revelation.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; From God. It takes a revelation.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that knowledge becomes
[1:20:24] revelation. And then it becomes a part
[1:20:25] of you.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Knowledge is just not knowledge at that
[1:20:28] point. Then it's who you are.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; We've talked about that many, many
[1:20:33] times. So I won't go into that. But that
[1:20:35] revelation becomes a part of who you
[1:20:37] are.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Then when you get
[1:20:41] in situations that you need God, then
[1:20:43] you call on God and you know God is
[1:20:46] going to be there. You know God is going
[1:20:48] to bless you. You know God is going to
[1:20:49] heal you. Amen. As he has done so many
[1:20:52] times before. I listen to this song.
[1:20:54] So many times I list these songs that
[1:20:57] while I'm working and this song says
[1:20:59] count your blessings.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how big or small, count
[1:21:02] them.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; He said when you start counting, you
[1:21:05] might find that you have trouble being
[1:21:06] able to count all of them because of the
[1:21:09] blessings of God that have rained on to
[1:21:10] you. No matter how big or small they
[1:21:12] are, count them all
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; because he's the same God. And what
[1:21:16] happens then to your troubles? What
[1:21:17] happens then to your uh to your disease,
[1:21:19] your affliction, your thought that that
[1:21:21] that negative thought that goes away
[1:21:24] because all you're thinking of at that
[1:21:26] point is God and the goodness of God and
[1:21:28] what he's done for you.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's the truth.
[1:21:33] All come in unity of faith, the
[1:21:34] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:21:36] perfect man. Again, that's a different
[1:21:39] word that we saw uh in the perfecting of
[1:21:42] the saints, but they work together, if
[1:21:45] you will, these two words. Amen. It
[1:21:48] takes one word to get to the next. The
[1:21:51] translator translated it that way and
[1:21:53] used the word perfect in both instances
[1:21:55] when it probably could could have been a
[1:21:58] different word used, but anyway, one
[1:22:00] brings you to the next. perfecting of
[1:22:03] the saints, building up, edifying,
[1:22:05] brings you to the place that you're
[1:22:07] mature, that you're grown up, per uh
[1:22:10] unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
[1:22:13] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go and read that real quick.
[1:22:19] Well, we're not going to do it quick,
[1:22:22] but we're going to do it anyhow.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Over in second Peter chapter 1.
[1:22:30] Now, it hasn't been that long
[1:22:33] since she actually had a study on this
[1:22:36] building of a perfect man. In fact, it's
[1:22:38] not been so long since we still have it
[1:22:40] on the my uh little uh whiteboard over
[1:22:44] here of the of the statue of a perfect
[1:22:46] man building up from the faith, virtue,
[1:22:49] knowledge, temper, patience. So u this
[1:22:54] acknowledgment in the scripture that
[1:22:56] Ephesians gives us that Paul gives to
[1:22:59] the Ephesians is about coming into the
[1:23:02] unity of the faith the knowledge of the
[1:23:04] son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:23:07] measure
[1:23:09] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:23:12] fullness of Christ.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; What's that measure? That measure
[1:23:17] measures in what we're talking about
[1:23:19] that we see here in Peter. That's the
[1:23:21] measure.
[1:23:22] Praise the Lord. Accumul the culmination
[1:23:25] is love. And what is God? God is love.
[1:23:29] The capstone.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Which is what this bride is being capped
[1:23:33] with.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; She is the capstone. She is she is love.
[1:23:36] Now we talked last week. She she has
[1:23:40] that that co that capstone. A man of
[1:23:43] love has brought us to that measure.
[1:23:46] That measure of taking it as a pyramid
[1:23:48] as brother Brandham put it in this
[1:23:49] pyramid, this statue, this pyramid from
[1:23:52] the bottom. Faith. Amen. Everybody has
[1:23:56] faith. But then you get up to virtue and
[1:23:58] the pew fall off. You get up to
[1:23:59] knowledge, few more fall off. And
[1:24:00] temperance and patience, godliness. Or
[1:24:02] you get up to the capstone and there's
[1:24:04] just a few left.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; A few that can get to that measure, that
[1:24:10] measure, the stature of a perfect man.
[1:24:11] Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 1. Simon Peter, a
[1:24:15] servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to
[1:24:17] them that have obtained like precious
[1:24:19] faith with us through the righteousness
[1:24:21] of God and our savior Jesus Christ.
[1:24:24] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:24:26] through the knowledge knowledge.
[1:24:28] Notice how Peter uh exclaims or at least
[1:24:32] was translated that way into the word
[1:24:35] knowledge several times in this passage.
[1:24:38] Grace and peace be multiply unto you
[1:24:40] through the knowledge of God and of
[1:24:42] Jesus our Lord. According as his divine
[1:24:46] power hath given unto us all things that
[1:24:50] pertain unto life and godliness,
[1:24:54] divine power has given unto us
[1:24:58] all things that pertain unto life and
[1:25:02] godliness. Praise the Lord. How did he
[1:25:04] do that? through a five-fold ministry.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] Through the knowledge of him, another
[1:25:12] knowledge. Amen. Through the knowledge
[1:25:15] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:25:18] virtue,
[1:25:20] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:25:24] great and precious promises,
[1:25:27] that by these ye might be partakers of
[1:25:31] the divine nature. And that's just the
[1:25:33] Holy Ghost.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The divine nature of God is his
[1:25:37] spirit. What is the spirit of God? The
[1:25:40] spirit of God is the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:25:43] Or the Holy Spirit. That is the spirit
[1:25:45] of God.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; And that is God's divine nature. Just
[1:25:50] like your nature is your spirit.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your your affection, reason,
[1:25:55] conscience, affection, memory, that that
[1:25:57] that uh is is what contacts your outside
[1:26:02] body. Amen. that then that outside body
[1:26:05] then reacts on on what that spirit is.
[1:26:08] Now the spirit is still uh is still a
[1:26:11] part of humanity. Amen. Because the part
[1:26:13] that God controls is the soul. Amen.
[1:26:17] That uh the but now when you become born
[1:26:21] again of this divine nature then that
[1:26:24] divine nature is what takes control over
[1:26:27] your spirit and then takes control over
[1:26:30] your body.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we notice that when we become
[1:26:34] partakers of that divine nature, we're b
[1:26:37] we become born again, then it's comes at
[1:26:41] uh unto us as knowledge and virtue from
[1:26:44] God.
[1:26:45] These precious promises, where do they
[1:26:47] come from? Again, how are they
[1:26:50] expressed? How are they ministered? How
[1:26:52] are they brought to a bride body?
[1:26:55] Through a five-fold ministry. Amen. And
[1:27:00] every one of these is is in a different
[1:27:04] calling for a different purpose as we
[1:27:08] said last week. Um
[1:27:11] let's see here. Let me read this. I
[1:27:14] didn't get to this last week, but let me
[1:27:15] read this quote before we continue on
[1:27:18] with that scripture.
[1:27:21] Amen. Now notice, the nature of your
[1:27:24] spirit is your soul.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; N Amen. The nature of your body is your
[1:27:29] spirit. But the nature is what controls
[1:27:31] each one. If you're born with the wrong
[1:27:34] nature, as we all come in the world
[1:27:35] speaking lines, born with the wrong
[1:27:37] nature, then it affects our spirit, then
[1:27:39] it affects our body. Amen. But when when
[1:27:42] but when brother Brandham talks about
[1:27:44] that five-fold ministry, he talks about
[1:27:47] that five-fold ministry bringing
[1:27:49] bringing the body to that place of of
[1:27:53] the promised word of God here
[1:27:56] to be partakers of the divine nature of
[1:28:00] the Holy Spirit. Amen. When I learned
[1:28:04] what the scripture said, it become
[1:28:07] revelation that what I was reading was
[1:28:11] true. And when it become a revelation to
[1:28:14] me, I acted upon it. And I asked my
[1:28:17] pastor to baptize me in the name of the
[1:28:20] scripture baptism of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:23] Christ.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] And when that happened then then you
[1:28:28] become you you are then a candidate to
[1:28:32] receive
[1:28:34] the Holy Ghost to receive this divine
[1:28:36] nature
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; right
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; for this divine nature to come now and
[1:28:40] take over your spirit
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; and to take over your body.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Now you see things differently, you hear
[1:28:48] things differently. Everything about you
[1:28:49] is different. I mean Paul said, "The
[1:28:51] things I used to love and now I hate. It
[1:28:52] thinks I hated out love because the
[1:28:54] divine nature come in and even changed
[1:28:57] his name like we talked about a couple
[1:28:59] weeks ago. Amen. Cuz Saul wasn't the
[1:29:02] name that God wanted him named to do
[1:29:04] what he needed to do. He needed to be
[1:29:06] called Paul. So God changed his name
[1:29:09] just like he changed the names. We
[1:29:11] talked about the name changes through
[1:29:12] the scripture. The reason why those
[1:29:15] names are important.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now let me read this because
[1:29:20] each part of this it plays its own part
[1:29:22] for its own purpose.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And this is this is another reason why I
[1:29:27] believe in the separation of those
[1:29:30] offices and that a person is divinely
[1:29:34] called to a position.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me read this. But now no
[1:29:41] actually
[1:29:43] time get this by so fast. But now
[1:29:45] notice, I feel like it's been five
[1:29:46] minutes.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I honestly it's been 40. 45. I think
[1:29:51] it's been five. So I have to look at the
[1:29:53] clock cuz I just think I just got
[1:29:55] started. Notice gifts in 1956. Brother
[1:29:59] says, "But notice now notice now we're
[1:30:02] at the at the at the carnival. Maybe it
[1:30:06] was all uh that's all of us here now.
[1:30:08] We're at the carnival. Maybe none of you
[1:30:11] see visions. I don't know.
[1:30:14] Maybe you'd be uh something else because
[1:30:17] we're all one big body.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; We're all one big body. That's brother
[1:30:22] Bam's exhortation to this. See, we're
[1:30:24] all one big body.
[1:30:27] Here's a lot of pastors sitting here.
[1:30:30] Good preachers. Now, Brother Bam said
[1:30:32] he's, you know, Brother Bam was fairly
[1:30:35] good at self-defeating. He he put
[1:30:37] himself down a lot. Uh he never
[1:30:40] acknowledged his position. Very rarely
[1:30:42] did he ever when the spirit really hit
[1:30:45] him and he was in the middle of
[1:30:46] preaching, he said, "You believe me to
[1:30:48] be God's prophet." I mean, but when he's
[1:30:51] talking soberly, he he he tried to shun
[1:30:55] that every bit he could. So, brother
[1:30:57] Brandham always put himself down. But I
[1:31:00] say that as we continue reading, here
[1:31:02] are a lot of pastors sitting here, good
[1:31:04] preachers. He says, "I can't preach.
[1:31:08] I wasn't called as a preacher." That's
[1:31:11] what he said. 1956. Now, that's what he
[1:31:13] said. I I wasn't called as a preacher.
[1:31:18] They can teach. He said, "I'm not a
[1:31:20] teacher." See, I taught a convention.
[1:31:23] Well, I may be in here in here. We're
[1:31:27] all put in a We're all put in it in a
[1:31:31] way you'll understand it. Here's a man
[1:31:35] standing here. Uh is short and strong.
[1:31:40] That's what he is. He could lift up a
[1:31:43] big something, tote it on his shoulder,
[1:31:45] and walk away with it. He said, "I'm
[1:31:49] tall and skinny." Now, I got to be the
[1:31:51] first time I think I had ever seen
[1:31:54] Brother Brandham call himself tall.
[1:31:57] I I never knew 5 foot n was tall.
[1:32:01] But brother Brandham calls himself tall.
[1:32:03] I guess he means he's taller than the
[1:32:06] guy that he's talking about that's short
[1:32:07] and strong. But he says, "I'm tall and
[1:32:11] skinny. I couldn't do what that man
[1:32:14] does." See, but God made him that way
[1:32:18] for his work. He made me this way for my
[1:32:22] work.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; You understand the whole point. I try to
[1:32:27] make an understanding. I am not a
[1:32:30] pastor, prophet, teacher, evangelist.
[1:32:32] I'm a pastor.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not a pastor evangelist. I'm a
[1:32:36] pastor.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] a pastor can teach, but I'm not a
[1:32:41] teacher. I don't come and and just teach
[1:32:44] on things. There's that. But a pastor
[1:32:49] has to delve into these avenues where
[1:32:53] there's evangelistic kind of
[1:32:55] ministering, there's teaching kind of
[1:32:57] ministry, there's things to get into to
[1:33:00] help pastor the people. Amen. But now
[1:33:03] notice, I believe, before I finish
[1:33:06] reading this quote, I believe, and I've
[1:33:08] said this before, maybe a long time ago,
[1:33:10] but I believe Brother Brandham filled
[1:33:11] every office to a degree.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Obviously, he was prophet number one.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thus sayeth the Lord. He's prophet
[1:33:19] number one. He's prophet. Amen. Because
[1:33:23] thus sayith the Lord. That's his call
[1:33:24] was prophet. But as a word prophet,
[1:33:28] especially in what was given to him to
[1:33:30] do, I believe caused him to pastor
[1:33:32] people. I believe it brought him in the
[1:33:35] place of evangelizing. I believe he's
[1:33:36] evangelizing here.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Missionary. How many times you go
[1:33:41] overseas?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Seek people overseas. Missionary. Um
[1:33:45] overseas.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Uh uh teacher, pastor, evangelist,
[1:33:53] uh pastor. uh prophet, he fulfilled
[1:33:56] every one of them to a degree. But now
[1:34:00] notice, you say, well uh if he if he if
[1:34:04] he was uh had occupied uh or or had in
[1:34:09] him the gift through a prophet gift
[1:34:14] because do you understand there's a
[1:34:16] difference in a word prophet and a
[1:34:18] gifted prophet,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; right? A gift of prophecy is someone
[1:34:22] that just has a gift to to give
[1:34:26] prophecy. But a word prophet is a person
[1:34:30] that has that gift. But also in him is
[1:34:33] the ability to approach these other
[1:34:36] offices to bring the word and expound
[1:34:39] the word to people.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring this word forth in in
[1:34:43] pastor and in in apostilhip and in and
[1:34:47] in uh uh teaching and pastoring. It the
[1:34:50] ability is there to do all of those
[1:34:52] things because a word prophet, not just
[1:34:55] a gifted prophet of of Corinthians 12,
[1:34:59] not just someone that has the gift of
[1:35:00] prophecy, but a word prophet.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. that had thus sayeth the Lord
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; brought the Bible, brought the scripture
[1:35:08] to life with a ministry of the breaking
[1:35:11] down and writing the dividing of the
[1:35:13] word.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; It's a whole different situation.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And there have been very very few word
[1:35:21] prophets through the scripture and
[1:35:23] through history. Very few. I mean,
[1:35:25] there's been a lot of prophets, a lot of
[1:35:29] gifted prophets, a lot of gifts of
[1:35:31] prophecy,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; but very, very few word prophets
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; that have come. In fact, brother Graham
[1:35:37] was the first one since Paul,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; There's been very few word prophets that
[1:35:45] were in that position to bring that
[1:35:47] word, which puts him
[1:35:50] at impart at least in each one of these
[1:35:53] offices. And he said, 'Well, if brother
[1:35:55] Brandham fulfilled the the office of
[1:35:58] pastor, why did why didn't he put Armen
[1:36:00] Neville in charge as pastor of Brandham
[1:36:03] Tabernacle? Because brother Brandham
[1:36:06] knew by the scripture that a pastor
[1:36:11] stays and tends to his flock.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; And he could not do that and fulfill the
[1:36:16] office that God gave him a prophet to be
[1:36:19] on the road.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to go all over the country, to
[1:36:22] go all over the world.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; He knew, yes, he was the he he called
[1:36:28] himself associate pastor. He giggled
[1:36:30] about it and I forgot what tape it was.
[1:36:32] He's we got a place for the pastor, a
[1:36:34] little place for the associate, you
[1:36:35] know, when he giggles about himself. But
[1:36:38] the truth is he knew by the scripture
[1:36:41] that he could not do that,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; That was not his main call. Yes, he
[1:36:48] could pastor to people. He had
[1:36:50] I I mean how many even brother Pat was
[1:36:54] in a private interview
[1:36:56] as they call it with brother Brandham.
[1:36:58] What is that? What is a private
[1:37:01] interview? He's pastoring those people.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; He's pastoring and giving them advice
[1:37:07] and telling them what the scripture says
[1:37:09] or what he's pastoring them. That's what
[1:37:11] a private interview is,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; right? when someone comes in with
[1:37:15] questions and stuff like that and he has
[1:37:16] a private interview. Yes. He's pastoring
[1:37:20] those people,
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; when he's when he's marrying people,
[1:37:23] when he's uh attending uh officiating
[1:37:27] funerals, when he's dedicating children,
[1:37:30] and when he's when he's uh uh uh oh,
[1:37:33] what do you call it? Nominating keeps
[1:37:35] coming to my mind. Ordaining ministers.
[1:37:40] That's what a pastor usually does. Now,
[1:37:42] of course, he has other ministers come
[1:37:44] up and lay hands, too. But still, that's
[1:37:46] that's pastorial duties. But brother
[1:37:49] Brandham could not be the pastor of
[1:37:51] Brandham Tabernacle because he's on the
[1:37:53] road all the time. And he knew that.
[1:37:55] That's why he put Orman Neville or he
[1:37:57] didn't, but it was Orman Neville was
[1:38:00] voted in as pastor of Brandham
[1:38:01] Tabernacle. And Orman Neville was pastor
[1:38:04] of Brandham Tabernacle till he died.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That's the reason.
[1:38:10] And then you got pastors out here that
[1:38:12] say they're pastors and want to tend to
[1:38:14] their sheep and they're burning up the
[1:38:16] roads left and right, east to west,
[1:38:17] north to south, all over the place, gone
[1:38:19] six months out of the year. That's not a
[1:38:21] pastor. I'm sorry.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; If you're an evangelist, resign your
[1:38:25] church and go hit the road.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; If you're a missionary, get on that
[1:38:29] plane and go to India, go to Africa, go
[1:38:31] to China, go to Russia, go wherever
[1:38:33] God's sending you, but don't try to
[1:38:35] pastor a church at the same time.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I will say this.
[1:38:41] I believe and this is my personal
[1:38:44] opinion and my personal belief just like
[1:38:46] brother Brandham
[1:38:48] uh God has in the scripture in certain
[1:38:52] instances
[1:38:54] little caveats of people that fulfill
[1:38:57] different offices for a different
[1:38:59] reason, different purposes.
[1:39:01] I believe uh brother Green was one of
[1:39:05] those brothers. Yes,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; I believe brother Green was the pastor
[1:39:09] of Tucson Tabernacle and was gone all
[1:39:12] the time
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; because of the position that he had for
[1:39:16] the responsibility that was given to
[1:39:19] him.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; All the things that needed to be done at
[1:39:24] the end of Brother's ministry to carry
[1:39:27] that message across over after his
[1:39:31] passing had to be done by those that
[1:39:33] were left behind.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Well, the people that were left
[1:39:36] behind had to have the means. They had
[1:39:39] to have the ability. They had to be in
[1:39:41] the position. They had to have been
[1:39:43] groomed. They had to have been
[1:39:47] molded to fit that position.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And brother Perry Green was the man that
[1:39:52] fit that position.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; That's why I had so many people say uh
[1:39:58] complain about Brother Green as a
[1:40:00] pastor. Brother Green wasn't really a
[1:40:02] pastor,
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; right? But he pastored the Tucson
[1:40:05] Tabernacle which helped him be able to
[1:40:08] facilitate all the things that God had
[1:40:10] him do.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; It brought him in that position. That's
[1:40:14] why brother That's why God always Now,
[1:40:17] Brother Green wasn't perfect, but that's
[1:40:19] why God always brought a a Nathaniel
[1:40:21] Johnson and a and a brother Linhardt and
[1:40:25] uh a me uh and different ministers. I
[1:40:29] won't call anybody else's name, but uh
[1:40:31] brought in brothers to do that to be
[1:40:34] quote unquote defunct pastors to that
[1:40:37] group of people
[1:40:39] because there there they had to have a
[1:40:43] stable force of someone there tending
[1:40:45] the sheep. There had to be. But brother
[1:40:49] Green had to have the the heading of
[1:40:52] pastor to do what he did to accomplish
[1:40:55] what he accomplished. That transition
[1:40:58] had to take place not just for Tucson
[1:41:02] Tabernacle or just for Tucson or not for
[1:41:04] just for Jeffersonville
[1:41:06] which nobody else took it upon
[1:41:08] themselves to do but brother Perry Green
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; right
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; and he's the one that did it and he
[1:41:13] started flying overseas and when brother
[1:41:15] Green when brother Brown was still here
[1:41:19] brother brother Green remember brother
[1:41:20] Green's testimony went to brother Brown
[1:41:23] said this brother come Galdona was it
[1:41:26] Galona
[1:41:27] He come and want to be baptized.
[1:41:28] Brother, brother brother Brown says,
[1:41:30] "We'll baptize him."
[1:41:32] Brother Green said, "Okay." So he takes
[1:41:35] him down and brother Brown, Brother
[1:41:36] Green baptizes, brother God.
[1:41:40] And now brother went back to Brother and
[1:41:41] said, "Now go preach the gospel to him."
[1:41:45] So brother Green gets on a plane and
[1:41:46] goes down to South Africa or uh South
[1:41:49] America and starts preaching to him. And
[1:41:51] off it goes.
[1:41:53] Well, then what did that do? That just
[1:41:56] lit a fire,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm saying this to try to caveat
[1:42:01] the five-fold ministry to the
[1:42:02] understanding of why God does some of
[1:42:04] the things that he does. He equips us
[1:42:06] all in different ways. There was nobody
[1:42:09] I'm sorry, friend, and I may get some
[1:42:12] push back or disagreement on this, but
[1:42:14] there was nobody when brother Brown
[1:42:17] passed away equipped to do what Perry
[1:42:20] Green did. Nobody. Everybody,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; it was on him and him alone.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Now from him and from that time started
[1:42:27] little fires and started little pockets
[1:42:30] and started little ministries and God
[1:42:32] started working with them and started
[1:42:34] working with them and God started
[1:42:35] working with them and started still had
[1:42:37] Tucson Tabernacle still the pastor of
[1:42:39] Tucson Tabernacle. I've had a lot of
[1:42:40] people tell me he was a horrible pastor
[1:42:43] that there's a reason for that.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; there's a reason you feel that way. I'm
[1:42:47] not saying he was. There's a reason you
[1:42:49] feel that way. Amen. He went here and
[1:42:53] then God started dealing with these
[1:42:54] people and started dealing with those
[1:42:56] people and then you got people going and
[1:42:58] then you got other generations coming up
[1:43:00] and they said, "Wow, these got this
[1:43:01] group and these well I feel I called a
[1:43:04] missionary and so they fly over to this
[1:43:05] group and so well we just heard about it
[1:43:07] and they started distributing books and
[1:43:08] they started distributing tapes and
[1:43:10] ministers started rising up and they
[1:43:12] started sending people all over the
[1:43:13] place." Now you had and from that grew
[1:43:17] just a huge balloon of this message
[1:43:19] around the world.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; And grew from a couple thousand probably
[1:43:25] I think or so that when brother Brandon
[1:43:27] passed away to two million people that
[1:43:29] that were professing message believers.
[1:43:33] How did that happen?
[1:43:35] Well through obviously through
[1:43:37] technology and stuff like that. You had
[1:43:39] the invention of airplanes and then you
[1:43:41] had telephones and then you know along
[1:43:44] come the internet and you had all this
[1:43:45] sudden then you could spread the gospel.
[1:43:46] Things could spread a lot faster and a
[1:43:48] lot more broad with technology. But
[1:43:51] there had to be people men brothers to
[1:43:53] use that technology to get it out.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's to get to this
[1:44:00] whole bride body internationally. And
[1:44:02] Perry Green was the one that started
[1:44:04] that. I'm sorry. He's the one that
[1:44:05] started that.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; That got that going. That's the reason
[1:44:09] that that is the way it is.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Now, Tucson Tabernacle still exists and
[1:44:13] that's fine. That's great. That's my
[1:44:15] brothers and sisters. I love them with
[1:44:16] all my heart. Brother Dan Evans, I love
[1:44:18] him with everything I can love him with.
[1:44:20] Amen. But after brother Green passed
[1:44:22] away, the purpose of all that ministry
[1:44:25] was gone.
[1:44:27] And I've had people tell me, "Well,
[1:44:30] they're changing this and they're
[1:44:32] changing that, and the building's
[1:44:33] changing, they're doing this, and
[1:44:34] they're doing that, and it doesn't even
[1:44:35] look the same. Doesn't even feel the
[1:44:37] same. It's not supposed to be.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I don't like it either because that was
[1:44:41] my home for 15 years. I don't like it
[1:44:44] either, but it's supposed to be that
[1:44:46] way. Brother Green's gone,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; It doesn't fulfill the purpose that it
[1:44:50] used to fulfill. Amen. It It's not in
[1:44:53] the position that it used to be in with
[1:44:55] Barry Green as the head of it.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; It's and it's never going to be the
[1:44:59] same. But it doesn't have to be the
[1:45:01] same. It's not supposed to be the same.
[1:45:04] You understand? It's not supposed to be
[1:45:06] what it was. It doesn't need to be what
[1:45:08] it was. Now, God's got these bride
[1:45:11] members and churches and ministers and
[1:45:13] pastors all over the world. And we're
[1:45:16] doing one thing. We're all getting ready
[1:45:19] for the coming of the Lord.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; All getting ready for the coming of the
[1:45:24] Lord.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And it falls back on
[1:45:27] the five-fold ministry. Let me finish
[1:45:28] this before I before I close today. this
[1:45:31] man. Look now again my separation of I'm
[1:45:36] not a pastor, evangelist, missionary.
[1:45:38] Amen.
[1:45:40] God made me the way he made me to be a
[1:45:42] pastor.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; He made that other brother over here the
[1:45:46] way he made him to be an evangelist.
[1:45:48] So if you're an evangelist, don't try to
[1:45:50] be a pastor. Like we said last week, an
[1:45:52] evangelist is supposed to come in, tear
[1:45:53] the place apart, and and leave.
[1:45:57] A pastor can't do that.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. A pastor likes evangelism coming
[1:46:02] into his church because he likes the
[1:46:04] five-fold ministry. But a pastor
[1:46:06] understands when an evangel a true
[1:46:07] evangelist comes in anointed of God,
[1:46:10] he's going to rip the hide off your
[1:46:11] congregation.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to come back in
[1:46:16] with the with the sav and make it all
[1:46:18] good.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not patronize people, but bring in
[1:46:23] a pastorial spirit that helps people
[1:46:26] come into an understanding. Brother
[1:46:28] Brandham could do all that in one
[1:46:30] service, but Amen. It's just different.
[1:46:32] So it
[1:46:35] again, Brother Brandham said, "There's
[1:46:37] this guy. He's short and strong. He can
[1:46:40] pick up that bag of something and walk
[1:46:41] away with it." He said, "I'm tall and
[1:46:43] skinny. I couldn't do it. God built him
[1:46:46] for the reason he built him the way he
[1:46:47] built him. And he built me the way he
[1:46:49] built me for a reason. Because of who I
[1:46:51] am, what I'm supposed to do, what God's
[1:46:53] called me to do. That's why I am who I
[1:46:56] am. That's why I was raised in the house
[1:46:58] I was raised with the parents I have and
[1:46:59] the neighborhood I had, the friends I
[1:47:01] had, the schools I went to. It all goes
[1:47:03] down the line. It was to equip and to
[1:47:06] bring me to the place that God could use
[1:47:08] me in this capacity. Same thing with
[1:47:10] everyone just in a different capacity.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You look and read brother Bam's life and
[1:47:15] see if brother Bam's life, every bit of
[1:47:18] what happened to him did bring him up to
[1:47:19] the point to do what he needed to do
[1:47:21] when God called him.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. every bit of it shaped him into
[1:47:27] who he was. Brother Brandham even talks
[1:47:30] about to his to his manly structure.
[1:47:34] Amen. I wasn't built to do that.
[1:47:37] So, I don't do it. I don't pick up that
[1:47:39] big bag of something and tote it over
[1:47:41] here. That's not my It's not mine to do.
[1:47:43] Amen. I'm not supposed to evangelize to
[1:47:46] you. That's not my job to do. I might
[1:47:47] rip the hide off of you once in a while,
[1:47:49] but that's just something that the word
[1:47:50] does that God gives. And that's what a
[1:47:52] pastor does. Amen. But that's not my
[1:47:56] ministry. Understand?
[1:47:59] But God made him that way for his work.
[1:48:01] Made me this way for my work. Now, we're
[1:48:03] trying to look beyond the curtain of
[1:48:05] time. Well, perhaps I'd be the one to do
[1:48:07] it. Now, what will it do? What will I
[1:48:09] do? I jump up, grab a hold. And a little
[1:48:13] short fella, he couldn't do that. He
[1:48:16] couldn't find his load. See what I mean?
[1:48:19] Maybe you preach. Maybe you're a pastor.
[1:48:21] Maybe you're a teacher. Maybe you're an
[1:48:22] evangelist. You don't see visions. I
[1:48:25] don't. He says, "I see visions." But
[1:48:28] some none of them. See, but God has set
[1:48:31] in the church all these things for the
[1:48:34] perfecting of the body.
[1:48:38] Amen. For the perfecting of the body,
[1:48:40] the bride body as a whole.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; That's how we come together.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; That's why this body has to come
[1:48:47] together.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I've got to read this before I
[1:48:51] close. I didn't even finish second
[1:48:53] Peter, but anyway,
[1:48:55] we'll finish it later. Hebrews chapter
[1:48:59] 10. Let me read this. We're talking on
[1:49:00] the body real quick. Notice Hebrews
[1:49:03] 10:1. For the law having a shadow, I
[1:49:06] don't know if I could do this without
[1:49:07] teaching you. The law having a shadow of
[1:49:09] good things to come and not the very
[1:49:12] image of the things can never with these
[1:49:15] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:49:17] year continually make the comers there
[1:49:20] unto perfect.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; For then would they have not ceased to
[1:49:25] be offered? Of course. Why wouldn't they
[1:49:28] still be doing it if that's what it took
[1:49:31] to be made perfect?
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:34] If that's all it took to make man
[1:49:35] perfect, why did Jesus even come?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Thus, we finish the reading.
[1:49:41] For then would we have not ceased to be
[1:49:43] offered? Because that the worshippers
[1:49:45] once pursed have no more conscience of
[1:49:48] sin. Let's see. They Well, let me let me
[1:49:51] go on. But in those sacrifices, there is
[1:49:54] a remembrance again made of sin um uh
[1:49:59] every year.
[1:50:01] For it is not possible that the blood of
[1:50:03] bulls and goats would take away sins.
[1:50:06] Wherefore when he cometh when Christ
[1:50:10] cometh into the world, he says,
[1:50:12] "Sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest
[1:50:14] not, but a body thou hast prepared for
[1:50:18] me." Praise the Lord. Let's just think
[1:50:21] about that till next week.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. A body thou has prepared
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; for me.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:30] I'm thankful today. Now, he had his
[1:50:32] human natural body, but I thank God I am
[1:50:35] a member of the mystical body of Jesus
[1:50:38] Christ.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A part of that body. A
[1:50:43] member of that body. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:46] Let's stand if we could.
[1:50:50] Wow. This too long. It says an hour.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; 10 minutes. Is that okay? Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; God's mindful.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; God knows. That's why everything about
[1:51:04] this, everything about his word brings
[1:51:06] us right back around to that
[1:51:08] understanding that God's bringing us to
[1:51:10] the place that we're at today. Because
[1:51:13] we're, this bride is about to go home. I
[1:51:16] almost said ready. We're not ready or
[1:51:17] we'd be gone.
[1:51:20] Brother Brown said when this bride's
[1:51:21] ready, she'll be gone.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm believing that anytime, any
[1:51:26] moment. one more seed possibly. Maybe
[1:51:29] that seed is in and maturing. I don't
[1:51:31] know. It's up to God. But I believe in
[1:51:34] my spirit, in my heart, in my soul, it's
[1:51:37] it's not much longer. Can't be much
[1:51:39] longer. Amen. That God's calling us
[1:51:42] home. I I've talked about you for the
[1:51:44] past couple of weeks about this movement
[1:51:46] that's going on. I saw an interview of
[1:51:48] somebody. I think it was Pat Robert's
[1:51:49] daughter who's kind of taking up the
[1:51:51] mantle of Pat Roberts. Y'all know Pat
[1:51:53] Roberts. Robert's son. Was it Roberts or
[1:51:55] Robertson? Pat Robert Pat 700 Club
[1:52:00] Pat Robertson. Okay. Um
[1:52:03] I I saw an interview on the news. I was
[1:52:06] getting dressed in the morning going
[1:52:07] getting ready to go to work and I turned
[1:52:08] on the news and um she was doing an
[1:52:12] interview with her and she was talking
[1:52:13] about how uh how these this great they
[1:52:18] call revival coming up now in this
[1:52:20] country sweeping through. I read another
[1:52:23] article yesterday on the plane where
[1:52:25] Jenzers, which I thought Z was the end
[1:52:28] of the alphabet, but apparently I guess
[1:52:29] the next generation is alpha or
[1:52:31] something. Anyway, Gen Zer men are now
[1:52:35] flocking to churches.
[1:52:37] They're they're even Gen Z men, what I
[1:52:40] read, is now outnumbering millennial men
[1:52:44] in churches
[1:52:46] because of that because of that spirit,
[1:52:48] that wave that's going.
[1:52:51] She made the comment about the Holy
[1:52:55] Spirit and those people going to get in
[1:52:57] that that getting into that Holy Spirit.
[1:53:00] Friend, isn't that just exactly what
[1:53:02] I've been trying to get to us for two
[1:53:05] weeks about Re Matthew 25? Three weeks
[1:53:08] maybe. Matthew 25. When that foolish
[1:53:12] virgin goes after that oil, that's when
[1:53:14] the bridegroom comes. I for I I can't
[1:53:17] help it, saints. It's all in my spirit.
[1:53:19] It's in my soul. I believe that to be
[1:53:22] the day that we're living.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I think we're watching it unfold right
[1:53:26] now. And it's it's it's going home time.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; It's going home time. She actually
[1:53:31] literally out of her own mouth said
[1:53:34] those almost exact words that I have
[1:53:36] said here. Now, she didn't say it in in
[1:53:38] relation to Matthew 25. She wouldn't
[1:53:41] call herself or those foolish virgin.
[1:53:43] But we know as we know the scripture,
[1:53:46] that's what's going on.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; that's what's happening. And it is h is
[1:53:50] sweeping this country, saints. Amen.
[1:53:54] My mind. Praise the Lord. It's like
[1:53:56] brother brother Dennis prayed. Not time
[1:53:59] to be playing church. Not time to be
[1:54:01] playing with God.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time to get right with the
[1:54:04] Lord Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] Amen. I was going to sing this whole
[1:54:14] song, but we'll just sing the chorus
[1:54:16] here. Amen. It's I think let's see
[1:54:20] 196 You're home with the book. We
[1:54:22] probably know it though. I was going to
[1:54:25] sing the verses, but we'll just sing the
[1:54:26] chorus as we're closing our service
[1:54:28] today. Is that okay? Just praise him.
[1:54:30] Worship him again. We entered our
[1:54:32] service with praise. We ended our
[1:54:34] service lifting our hands and worship
[1:54:35] the Lord. Let's go out that way. Amen.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I will praise him.
[1:54:43] I
[1:54:45] will praise him.
[1:54:48] Praise
[1:54:50] the Lamb for sinners slave.
[1:54:58] Give
[1:54:59] him glory all ye people
[1:55:05] for his blood has washed away
[1:55:10] each stain.
[1:55:13] Oh hallelujah. Let's sing it again. Yes,
[1:55:16] I
[1:55:18] will praise him.
[1:55:21] I
[1:55:23] will praise him.
[1:55:26] Praise
[1:55:27] the lamb for sinner's slave.
[1:55:34] Give. Oh, give him glory. All you people
[1:55:42] for his blood has washed away
[1:55:47] each day. One more time again with all
[1:55:50] our hearts now.
[1:55:52] Yes, I
[1:55:55] will praise him.
[1:55:57] I
[1:55:59] will praise him.
[1:56:02] Praise
[1:56:04] the lamb for sinners slain.
[1:56:12] Give
[1:56:13] him gloryy all ye people.
[1:56:19] For his blood has washed away
[1:56:24] each day.
[1:56:29] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank
[1:56:33] you, Jesus, for that precious blood that
[1:56:36] washed away every stain, that cleansed
[1:56:40] us.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Made us righteous in the eyes of God.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:56:48] I'm so thankful that he did the work.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; It is finished.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Now it's to the body bride
[1:56:54] internationally, the mystical body of
[1:56:56] Christ to continue this thing forward on
[1:56:58] into the coming of the Lord. A rapture,
[1:57:00] a going home time. Amen.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Look up. Your redemption drawth nigh.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you.
[1:57:09] Pray something was said to bless and
[1:57:11] strengthen you today. Lord willing, if
[1:57:13] there is a next Sunday, come back again
[1:57:15] next Sunday expecting the Lord to do he
[1:57:17] always done and probably continue on
[1:57:20] this thought unless the Lord changes
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; which I don't doubt he could do
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; or would do but if not we just be back
[1:57:29] here same time same place I not heard I
[1:57:32] don't know we're not scheduled for next
[1:57:34] week yet so I don't know I have no idea
[1:57:37] it seems like week to week anymore I
[1:57:39] don't know where we're going next week
[1:57:40] so
[1:57:42] uh kind of make decisions at the last
[1:57:45] minute to and all arrangements and stuff
[1:57:48] at the last minute anymore to because
[1:57:50] the way the sites are going. So, I don't
[1:57:52] know, but I will let you know um what's
[1:57:56] going on. If we go back to one of the
[1:57:57] other two places we've been recently, uh
[1:58:00] I won't have to do service up, but
[1:58:02] there's no telling where we may go. So,
[1:58:05] but I will let you know what's going on
[1:58:06] in the service time and everything so
[1:58:09] that um we'll all be on top of that.
[1:58:13] See, whatever the Lord's will is. Amen.
[1:58:16] So, God richly bless you. Appreciate
[1:58:18] your prayers. Continue to pray. Remember
[1:58:20] the prayers and requests, things that
[1:58:22] we've heard today and those who've had
[1:58:24] surgeries and those who've been in
[1:58:26] situations, hospitals, the past. And of
[1:58:28] course, Cara is upcoming Wednesday.
[1:58:30] Mine's upcoming Wednesday. And just
[1:58:33] appreciate the Lord for that. He's
[1:58:34] always good to us, isn't he?
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, God richly
[1:58:38] bless you. Yes, you're right.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's his pastor's
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful she's okay though.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; She's okay. Pray for her recovery and
[1:58:51] for saying that.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Good.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Lord mind. Thank you. Amen. Lord reach
[1:58:58] bless you. Amen. We're going to keep on
[1:59:02] in our heart still
[1:59:06] my back right here tweaks sometimes and
[1:59:08] man it hurts. Just I I can pick up a 200
[1:59:12] pound something but and I I can bend
[1:59:16] over to pick up a paper clip and it tear
[1:59:18] me up. I don't I don't understand just a
[1:59:21] certain way. I don't know what it is,
[1:59:22] but man, when it hurts, it hurts. I know
[1:59:25] that. So, anyway, so God bless you.
[1:59:28] Bless you. And then we'll be dismissed
[1:59:30] in prayer. Appreciate. Anyone else have
[1:59:35] God bless you then? Appreciate you
[1:59:37] coming with us today.
[1:59:42] She wanted to ask for prayer for her.
[1:59:45] She's being shy.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's okay. You can tell mom or dad
[1:59:48] or
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I don't think April's very shy. He can
[1:59:51] tell us what
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; we'll pray for.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Is it It's getting better though, isn't
[1:59:59] it?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's getting better. You can say
[2:00:05] getting better.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; We'll still pray for you though.
[2:00:14] Gracious heavenly father god today once
[2:00:16] again not making making this a normal
[2:00:20] thing or something we take for granted
[2:00:21] but just that we're bowing our heads
[2:00:23] thanking you for this time together
[2:00:26] praise and worship you and hear from you
[2:00:28] and learn more maybe just re remember
[2:00:31] the things that we've heard or know
[2:00:32] before Lord Jesus maybe with the hope
[2:00:35] that you can reveal something new to us
[2:00:37] each and every time
[2:00:39] may be with us as we go our separate
[2:00:40] ways, our separate houses, separate
[2:00:42] places. Lord Jesus, those of us have to
[2:00:45] work through the week or medical
[2:00:47] procedures getting done. Others that are
[2:00:49] recovering for little Alice's need,
[2:00:52] Father God, may just be with us and
[2:00:53] touch us
[2:00:55] days not take anything for granted, but
[2:00:58] always be in prayer and thanksgiving for
[2:01:00] everything that you give to us.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Ourselves into your hands and ask
[2:01:04] everything in the name of Lord Jesus
[2:01:05] Christ. Amen. Amen.
