[37:45] thank you
[37:47] amen God bless you today now we'll go uh
[37:51] turn into the scripture now to Genesis
[37:53] chapter one
[37:55] try to pick up where we left off last
[37:57] week
[37:59] um we're willing
[38:01] with the Lord's help
[38:09] Genesis chapter 1 verse one new
[38:11] beginning part 16
[38:14] amen is what we're on today uh I felt
[38:17] like as I went through it last week I
[38:20] I almost felt like in my condition and
[38:22] feeling the way I did I almost just
[38:24] didn't do justice but when I started
[38:25] listening and looking
[38:27] um
[38:28] uh
[38:31] I believe what the Lord wanted to have
[38:33] said last week was said so
[38:36] um
[38:37] with hopefully with that with leaving
[38:41] behind some certain specific issues that
[38:44] would involve the books the book The
[38:46] Book of Life limbs book of life
[38:48] together that just the highlights that
[38:51] we hit
[38:52] um that it will move on past that so
[38:56] we're going to go to Revelation 21 after
[38:58] this uh after Genesis but we're gonna
[39:02] go beyond the white Throne judgment
[39:05] today so
[39:07] stress the Lord bless us and speak to us
[39:10] through it now and help us to
[39:13] get a little clear understanding of some
[39:16] of the things of the scripture here
[39:17] today amen before we read the word now
[39:19] Lord let's just power his forward prayer
[39:21] if we could Precious Jesus father it's
[39:24] certainly privileged to be here again
[39:26] today we thank you so much Lord for the
[39:29] time and for the energy and for health
[39:32] and strength and life and
[39:34] thank you for this place you've given us
[39:36] Lord thank you for these people that
[39:38] have come
[39:39] those who may be streaming today Father
[39:41] God would just give you glory and praise
[39:44] for Lord without you none of this would
[39:47] be possible yes yes none of it would be
[39:49] worth it uh what would be the point of
[39:51] coming here if you're not here Lord to
[39:53] meet with us Lord it just be another
[39:55] social Gathering which we could do
[39:57] anywhere we go to a restaurant or some
[39:59] other place to have a social Gathering
[40:01] but we didn't come here for that Lord we
[40:03] didn't come to hear come here to see
[40:05] who's here we didn't come here to see
[40:07] what we're all wearing or uh what the
[40:09] circumstances might be we we come to

[40:28] father I pray God believing that you
[40:30] were uh pleased Lord with with our
[40:34] worship God and received it unto
[40:35] yourself as a sweet smelling savior here
[40:38] Lord to do the exceeding and abundantly
[40:40] above all that we could ever ask or
[40:42] think I pray you anoint speaker in here
[40:44] and now God alike that Lord whatever is
[40:47] is is to be accomplished in this service
[40:50] that you would accomplish it father Yes
[40:52] for it'll not return void the word never
[40:55] returns void but it will accomplish what
[40:57] you sent it forth for Lord and I just
[41:00] pray that we just give ourselves in your
[41:02] hands and completely obedience Lord and
[41:04] deliverance that Lord you would have the
[41:07] preeminence now we rebuke every demonic
[41:09] spirit that would try to hurt hinder
[41:11] infiltrate this service in any way that
[41:14] you get the glory and praise for all
[41:15] that is said and done father we commit
[41:18] it to you Lord now and all that is
[41:20] therein in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:22] Christ we pray amen amen
[41:26] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 again
[41:29] we'll read in the beginning God created
[41:32] the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth
[41:33] was without form and void darkness is
[41:36] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[41:38] of God moved upon the face of the water
[41:41] amen and you can be seated as you if
[41:43] you'd like and again as I said we're
[41:45] going to go over to Revelation uh gone
[41:49] through we spent quite a bit of time on
[41:50] Revelation 20.
[41:53] um 19 and 20 we're going to go into
[41:55] Revelation 21 today
[42:00] Revelation 21 is the beginning of that
[42:03] time as we know of as the new Heaven and
[42:05] the new Earth
[42:07] uh judgment's over white Throne judgment
[42:10] is over
[42:11] um God has set aside his children and
[42:15] those who were found worthy through
[42:18] their works and given given uh washed
[42:24] their robes in the blood of Christ
[42:27] those he set up on his right hand and
[42:31] the rest have uh have been banished to
[42:35] the Lake of Fire right Heaven has been
[42:38] pure Earth uh well we'll just get to
[42:41] this part right now as we're gonna read
[42:43] uh Earth is being purified amen at this
[42:46] point
[42:47] purification of the Earth
[42:49] is a little unclear uh to me through the
[42:52] scripture and in the things that brother
[42:54] random said as to exactly the time of
[42:58] the purification of the earth whether
[43:00] it's before the white Throne judgment or
[43:02] after the white Throne judgment uh I
[43:06] believe as I said before that I tend to
[43:08] believe it's before
[43:10] uh uh but not absolutely sure about that
[43:14] but as you know at the end of uh Gog and
[43:18] Magog when God brings the fire and
[43:20] brimstone and destroys them
[43:22] as we could see would be to me uh uh a
[43:28] time that would ignite that that fire
[43:32] that is to purify the herb right amen
[43:34] remember the Earth has gone through its
[43:36] water baptism
[43:38] uh justification has gone through its
[43:40] bloody baptism uh sanctification when
[43:43] Jesus dropped his the chemistry of his
[43:46] blood upon this Earth that's going to go
[43:48] through a fiery baptism the Earth gets
[43:51] redeemed in the exact same way that we
[43:53] do uh there's justification
[43:55] sanctification holy spirit amen the the
[44:00] Earth which we are a part of our bodies
[44:03] are a part of goes through the same
[44:05] process the water baptism the
[44:07] sanctification of the blood on the earth
[44:09] and now a fiery baptism so to me it
[44:13] seems like that that period of time is
[44:15] more or less the time that um uh that it
[44:20] would be a complete wholesale burnover
[44:22] of the earth now is it before or after
[44:25] is really to me inconsequential though
[44:27] uh although I guess if we read the Bible
[44:31] and and we desire to uh look at it in
[44:36] the in the way that we see it through
[44:38] the scripture and the scripture the way
[44:40] it describes things and how events are
[44:42] going to unfold we kind of all have our
[44:45] ideas of how it's going to happen and
[44:47] how it's going to unfold and and what
[44:49] the Lord's going to do and when he's
[44:51] going to do it and things like that it's
[44:52] it's kind of like the earthquake it's
[44:54] going to sink California uh you know
[44:57] brother Branham never says if it's
[44:58] before the Rapture after the Rapture uh
[45:01] there's nothing in the prophecy that
[45:04] says that there's nothing that he says
[45:06] afterwards I have a lot of people that
[45:09] I've heard say it's got to be before and
[45:10] I've heard a lot of people say it's got
[45:12] to be after and everybody has their
[45:14] reasons and their uh their proofs that
[45:17] they have to to substantiate their
[45:19] belief but we bottom line is we don't
[45:22] know right but also the bottom line is
[45:25] it's really inconsequential the fact is
[45:28] it's going to happen yes amen I kind of
[45:30] tend to believe it's sort of going to be
[45:31] simultaneous with that great earthquake
[45:34] and uh the dead in Christ shall rise
[45:37] first and uh we all caught up together
[45:39] to meet the Lord in the air and there's
[45:41] going to be a lot of chaos at that
[45:42] period of time and things going on so
[45:44] but again I guess we all kind of have
[45:46] our things that we said in the scripture
[45:49] and say well I believe it's going to be
[45:51] this way well that's fine I'm not going
[45:52] to argue about that with you uh it very
[45:54] well could be this is what I believe and
[45:57] this is what I think so uh and and all
[46:00] that is fine one way or the other but
[46:03] we've gone through the white Throne
[46:04] judgment uh to me we're at that point
[46:07] where the new Heaven and the Earth the
[46:09] new Earth is to be set up so let's read
[46:11] this Revelation chapter 20 where where
[46:15] we are ushering in
[46:17] uh I'll probably read something a little
[46:20] bit later but this crossover now uh
[46:24] ushers us into a to the to the point of
[46:28] Eternity yeah yeah this ushers in the
[46:32] point of this study all the way through
[46:35] the new beginning that began this is now
[46:40] this is what we were heading for the
[46:43] whole time when we started out in the
[46:44] Garden of Eden in Genesis what's this
[46:47] this new beginning that we call a
[46:50] beginning is the ushering in this time
[46:52] now now we've had time elements all up
[46:55] to this period of time even after the
[46:57] Rapture even after uh uh the Millennium
[47:01] and Gog and Magog is is unfolding
[47:04] Through Time elements but this now is
[47:07] the beginning of Eternity
[47:10] eternity
[47:12] um amen well I wasn't going to do it but
[47:14] let me let me do it
[47:16] um I was going to say this for next week
[47:19] let me just show you something so many
[47:22] of you have probably seen this or heard
[47:23] this and I've tried to describe it and
[47:25] use uh different things that would maybe
[47:28] describe it a little bit better and I
[47:30] probably should have taken this off
[47:31] earlier because this doesn't go off very
[47:34] easily
[47:35] but I don't need a lot of room here to
[47:38] show you what I'm talking about the
[47:40] blending in is kind of the verbiage that
[47:43] I like to use yes the blending in back
[47:46] into
[47:48] eternity because remember when we when
[47:51] when it started out we started out in
[47:54] eternity
[47:54] when Adam and Eve started out they
[47:56] started out in eternity correct well
[47:59] when the fall happened uh
[48:02] eternity is just like a circle
[48:06] there's no beginning and no ending to it
[48:08] obviously as I drew it here you can
[48:10] point to a beginning and ending but and
[48:13] I usually like to take my ring off but
[48:14] my ring doesn't come off very easily
[48:16] anymore so but if you take your ring if
[48:19] you have a ring
[48:20] across the top of that ring you could
[48:22] run until you just starve to death or
[48:24] die or whatever because there's no
[48:27] beginning and ending to it see and
[48:29] that's what eternity is eternity never
[48:31] had a beginning never has an ending amen
[48:34] that's God God never had a beginning
[48:37] I I sometimes shudder to teach a lot on
[48:41] that because it blows my mind when I try
[48:43] to think about it it drives me crazy to
[48:46] think of where because even when I was a
[48:48] little kid but even when I was Joel's
[48:49] age I was asking my dad uh where did God
[48:53] begin where did God come from because
[48:56] see in our little finite P brains
[48:58] everything has to have come from
[49:00] something the way we think about it
[49:03] normally naturally carnally in our human
[49:05] thinking everything had to come from
[49:07] something but God didn't he just always
[49:10] was he's just a self-existing Elohim he
[49:14] never began and he never ends that's
[49:17] eternity there's no beginning and no
[49:19] ending to it but when God created man he
[49:23] created man in a uh in a uh here but
[49:29] in eternity in God's perfect will God's
[49:33] perfect will is eternity God's
[49:35] permissive will is time
[49:37] now when man fell it brought into here
[49:41] into eternity a little blip of time
[49:45] that that came off and Blended from
[49:48] eternity into time That's How Time began
[49:51] with the Fall In the Garden of Eden it
[49:54] Blended and ushered in a Time see and
[49:58] people think there's this great
[50:00] definitive
[50:01] separation between one and the next and
[50:04] there really isn't it's just a matter of
[50:07] uh it's just a matter in God's Mind of a
[50:10] blending in it just Blends in from one
[50:13] to the next and just as it blended into
[50:15] time and we've been in time this whole
[50:18] time out here just as we Blended from
[50:21] eternity into time just from the simple
[50:24] fall in the Garden of Eden we blend
[50:26] right back in to Eternity again right
[50:29] amen it's not necessarily to think some
[50:33] great shaking or event now I know we've
[50:35] got the white Throne judgment and after
[50:38] that it begins and blends back into this
[50:42] eternity again but it's not uh something
[50:45] to say there's this uh bam that's it it
[50:49] just Blends from time right from the
[50:52] white Throne judgment it just Blends
[50:54] right from that time element and goes
[50:56] right back into eternity again yes amen
[50:59] so he Blended out of God much perfect
[51:02] will in eternity out into a time element
[51:06] where uh there was Fallen man in sin and
[51:10] and all the things we see in the world
[51:12] today in this time element Satan took
[51:15] control of the earth and all the things
[51:17] that were therein of the earth through
[51:19] this time of and he's been in control of
[51:21] it this whole time Satan is still in
[51:23] control of it through this whole time
[51:25] element but when Satan loses his grip
[51:29] when Satan has to loose his grip off of
[51:32] this Earth and all the things that
[51:35] entered in through this time element
[51:36] when God when Satan loses his grip off
[51:40] of this
[51:41] kind of hard to put it where everybody
[51:43] can see it now when when Satan loses his
[51:46] grip off of this he's thrown into the
[51:48] Lake of Fire we blend back into eternity
[51:51] again yes yes see him into the place
[51:54] that at this time after the white Throne
[51:57] judgment everybody is in their glorified
[52:02] condition amen no longer time bodies now
[52:07] this time body that we have that's a
[52:10] part of the earth will be glorified amen
[52:14] not another body but it will be in a
[52:17] glorified condition that's why brother
[52:20] Branham tells us that our loved ones has
[52:22] gone on I remember when my dad passed
[52:25] away I found a picture of my dad when he
[52:27] was about 18 years old 19 years old and
[52:30] I put it on his casket and everybody
[52:32] come by and look at my dad I said that's
[52:35] the carcass my dad was housed in but
[52:37] this is what he looks like now amen
[52:39] because he's going back we go back to
[52:41] that young man young woman in a
[52:44] glorified condition in the way that it
[52:47] was supposed to be to start with
[52:49] in the way that our bodies that we are
[52:52] in now were supposed to be in a word
[52:55] body in a spoken word body The Way We
[52:59] were supposed to be from the beginning
[53:01] is how we will be after we leave here in
[53:06] a glorified condition so everyone at
[53:09] that time remember those that have
[53:11] rejected it are in the Lake of Fire and
[53:14] all we have are those God's bride those
[53:16] who be granted life 144 000 that blends
[53:20] back into eternity to give
[53:23] eternity there is no more time element
[53:26] involved there are no more time bodies
[53:30] to be stuck in like we are now
[53:32] there's no more time involved at all and
[53:36] that and this permissive will when Satan
[53:39] is cast in the lake afar has to lose his
[53:42] grip off of everything that he had
[53:45] control over through this whole time
[53:47] period he'll have to let go of it Blends
[53:51] back into eternity again right
[53:54] amen
[53:55] that is the beginning here that we are
[53:57] looking at Revelation 21 is the blending
[54:01] back in from time back into eternity
[54:04] we've had this how many thousands of
[54:07] years now from the time that it fell in
[54:10] sin into time and we're about to thanks
[54:16] with a short period of time are going to
[54:19] be blending right back into eternity
[54:21] where everything is right again
[54:23] everything is perfect everything's the
[54:25] way God thought it made it predestined
[54:28] in his mind uh everything about it will
[54:31] be exactly according to his his word and
[54:35] will amen now
[54:38] we can't
[54:40] we can't just box God up into the pages
[54:45] of this Bible
[54:47] God is greater and more expansive and
[54:51] and that's not even good enough words to
[54:53] describe it then what this book can hold
[54:56] right than what this book can contain
[54:59] God is so far more greater uh than what
[55:03] this book can hold but God gave us this
[55:07] so that we as humans in this time
[55:09] element can get a can just get a little
[55:12] glimpse a little grasp of who the
[55:16] Eternal Almighty omnipotent really is
[55:19] this is just a small snippet so when you
[55:22] look at this obviously God has to obey
[55:27] his word and fulfill all this work once
[55:30] this word becomes fulfilled see since
[55:32] we're getting at the end here
[55:33] Revelations is the end of the Bible
[55:36] there's only 22 chapters and we're
[55:38] starting on chapter 21.
[55:41] so this is the end of that
[55:43] but it's not the end of God Amen it's
[55:46] not the end of you
[55:47] it's just a it's just an unfolding back
[55:50] into where we're supposed to be to begin
[55:54] with amen that God had now
[55:58] so keep that in mind
[56:00] Revelation 21 we've now gotten to that
[56:03] new beginning
[56:04] we've now gotten to that place of
[56:08] Eternity again where where
[56:11] time has had to give way Satan has had
[56:16] to let loose of his script as God and
[56:20] his children enter into this new day
[56:22] this new beginning praise the Lord
[56:24] Revelation 21 now let's read it
[56:27] we'll just read the first couple of
[56:28] verses today it's probably all I'll get
[56:30] to today
[56:31] and I saw a new Heaven now Luke John
[56:33] this is the vision that God of course is
[56:36] giving to John and John describes it
[56:38] this way he said and I saw a new Heaven
[56:41] and a new Earth
[56:43] amen and we'll get to that a little bit
[56:44] I'll have to
[56:46] I'll have to I thought about it
[56:49] yesterday and
[56:50] I spent some time in reflection and
[56:53] prayer and
[56:55] there was no other way but to go back
[56:57] and reiterate some things that we've
[56:59] said in the past in this series so I
[57:02] hope it doesn't become redundant to you
[57:04] if it does please forgive me but to to
[57:07] get us to this point uh I found it
[57:10] necessary so
[57:11] just to let you know of that ahead of
[57:13] time
[57:14] John saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[57:19] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[57:22] were passed away and there was no more
[57:26] sea
[57:28] and I John saw the holy city New
[57:31] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[57:34] heaven
[57:35] prepared
[57:37] as a bride adored for her husband
[57:41] now there's quite a lot that's involved
[57:44] just in the first couple of chapters our
[57:46] first couple of verses but let's go back
[57:49] to this new Heaven and this new Earth
[57:51] and the passing away of the old Earth
[57:55] and the old Heavens so let's go back
[57:58] over as we have before II Peter chapter
[58:02] 3.
[58:07] amen
[58:09] because there's
[58:11] this Earth has to be prepared
[58:15] it's always been a point of contention
[58:18] in Christendom as to the placement of
[58:23] these events
[58:25] a millennium a white Throne judgment uh
[58:29] the this Revelation 21 this new city the
[58:33] New Jerusalem
[58:35] uh to understand
[58:38] at a lot of uh Christian organizations
[58:42] religious believe that this is just
[58:44] something that will be uh out somewhere
[58:47] they don't recognize that it's that this
[58:51] is going to be set up right here on this
[58:54] Earth
[58:54] on this place that God created for you
[58:58] and me
[58:59] God is
[59:01] has ended at this point of the scripture
[59:04] has ended all the sin
[59:07] all the unbelief all the doubt
[59:11] all the gray hair all the eyeglasses all
[59:13] the old age all the Death all the
[59:15] sickness all the police all the
[59:17] ambulance all of any of that is done
[59:19] away with amen God has conquered every
[59:22] bit of it that is all done finished
[59:25] now God is
[59:27] restoring back
[59:29] what he intended for it to be when he
[59:33] created Adam in the Garden of Eden
[59:36] restoring back that's the that that's
[59:38] the premise the whole premise of this
[59:41] new beginning is the restoring back of
[59:44] what was lost in the Garden of Eden
[59:47] re bringing back a restored Eden to the
[59:50] place that it was supposed to be when
[59:53] God first said let there be as we read
[59:56] every single time we started a a a a
[59:59] part of this series in the beginning God
[1:00:03] created the Heaven Earth back to that
[1:00:05] point
[1:00:06] God is restoring back now bringing it
[1:00:08] back to that place so if he's going to
[1:00:11] do that where is he going to do it
[1:00:14] he's going to do it right here right
[1:00:16] right here on this Earth in this place
[1:00:19] that God created he created it for you
[1:00:22] and I to live on for us to enjoy for it
[1:00:25] to be a part of of his creation and us
[1:00:29] together with body life and animal life
[1:00:31] and human life existing coexisting
[1:00:34] together in in unity Harmony perfection
[1:00:39] restoring a restored Eden is where he's
[1:00:42] talking about people fussing fighting
[1:00:45] going about uh whether we're going back
[1:00:48] to Pentecost or uh or not to go back to
[1:00:50] Pentecost things like that that's always
[1:00:53] the verbiage they want to throw out
[1:00:54] friend I'm not concerned about going
[1:00:56] back or not going back to Pentecost my
[1:00:59] concern is getting to the place that we
[1:01:01] reach this restored Eden yes that's what
[1:01:04] I'm looking for this place of Eternity
[1:01:06] this new hope this new Heaven and new
[1:01:09] earth that's what I'm looking for you
[1:01:12] can have your Pentecost gets the spirit
[1:01:13] that's that's fine all that's part of
[1:01:16] the scripture absolutely but my goal of
[1:01:18] mine is not to go back when 120 was an
[1:01:21] upper room but my goal in AIM is to go
[1:01:24] back into the mind of God where he
[1:01:26] designed it to be and the way it was
[1:01:28] supposed to be in his mind before this
[1:01:30] world was ever formed amen amen now
[1:01:33] Revel uh II Peter
[1:01:36] uh chapter three we got a new Heaven now
[1:01:38] continue to keep in your mind
[1:01:41] the verbiage that we just read that
[1:01:43] Peter uh that uh John the Revelator gave
[1:01:45] us he saw God showed him a new Heaven
[1:01:50] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[1:01:52] the first Earth were passed away now
[1:01:55] most of you know uh of course if you
[1:01:58] know the message and have heard me talk
[1:02:00] about it several times you recognize
[1:02:03] that when you get into the scripture and
[1:02:05] you and you see the truth of what pass
[1:02:09] away means it doesn't mean a complete
[1:02:12] annihilation
[1:02:14] this passing away does not mean that the
[1:02:17] Earth is going to be completely
[1:02:19] annihilated yes as we've talked about
[1:02:21] it's going to be drastically changed
[1:02:25] it's going to be brought back onto its
[1:02:28] perfect axis like it was the beginning
[1:02:30] it was still supposed to be
[1:02:32] the whole frame of it outside what we
[1:02:35] just read what what was the last thing
[1:02:37] there in first and the first verse that
[1:02:39] John saw
[1:02:40] he or did not see he saw no seed there
[1:02:45] was no more seat well just to be just to
[1:02:49] see this Earth
[1:02:50] as we see it now which is uh anybody
[1:02:54] correct me if I'm wrong but 70 plus
[1:02:56] percent water
[1:02:58] that there's going to be no more C right
[1:03:00] well that tells you right there that
[1:03:02] that the changing of this ball of dirt
[1:03:05] this big rock is going to be quite
[1:03:07] drastic because first of all there's no
[1:03:10] more seed right amen so that tells you
[1:03:13] there amen that's going to be a big
[1:03:15] change but now look second Peter chapter
[1:03:17] three let's start with verse one
[1:03:20] foreign
[1:03:22] this Second Epistle
[1:03:24] beloved I now write unto you
[1:03:31] in both which I stir up your pure Minds
[1:03:34] by the way of remembrance
[1:03:36] that you may be mindful of The Words
[1:03:38] which were spoken before by the holy
[1:03:40] prophets and of the Commandment of us
[1:03:42] the Apostles of the Lord and Savior
[1:03:44] knowing this first
[1:03:47] that there shall come in the last days
[1:03:49] offers walking after their own lusts
[1:03:51] we've gone through that and saying where
[1:03:54] is the promise of his coming
[1:03:56] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:03:59] things continue as they were from the
[1:04:01] beginning of creation and that is not
[1:04:03] true but that's what the scoffer says
[1:04:05] believe
[1:04:07] for this
[1:04:09] they willingly are ignorant of now
[1:04:12] remember we've gone through that
[1:04:14] being deceived or willingly ignorant
[1:04:17] willfully ignorant there's those that
[1:04:20] are willfully ignorant
[1:04:23] of
[1:04:24] that by the word of God the heavens were
[1:04:27] of old and the Earth standing out of the
[1:04:29] water and in the water but John saw an
[1:04:33] Earth with no water
[1:04:34] no more seed
[1:04:37] whereby the world that then was being
[1:04:39] overflowed with water perished amen
[1:04:43] perished now
[1:04:46] now
[1:04:47] I want you to notice something here when
[1:04:50] it when it talks about
[1:04:52] when it talks about the word world
[1:04:56] perished here
[1:04:58] means to destroy or to be lost or to
[1:05:03] loose uh
[1:05:05] to be changed if you will
[1:05:09] uh not entirely abolished or uh
[1:05:15] completely annihilated but destroyed or
[1:05:19] perished to the point that it's uh it's
[1:05:23] changed it's changed its form amen
[1:05:27] now
[1:05:30] with it changing its form this perish
[1:05:34] when it talks about uh uh the the the
[1:05:37] whole the old Heaven and Earth perishing
[1:05:41] it it's talking about that that Earth
[1:05:44] that
[1:05:45] changed from what it was to what it will
[1:05:49] be
[1:05:51] and the word world here
[1:05:54] does not mean and you can look it up and
[1:05:56] see
[1:05:57] but this world here does not mean this
[1:06:02] the physical Earth
[1:06:05] the Greek on this means Cosmos
[1:06:09] so when you look up whereby the world
[1:06:11] that was being overflowed by water the
[1:06:14] world that was is not talking about this
[1:06:17] ball of dirt
[1:06:18] it's talking about the cosmos or the
[1:06:21] world order
[1:06:23] everything about the Earth that was in
[1:06:27] the Earth on the earth at the time not
[1:06:30] the actual structure of the Earth itself
[1:06:32] when it says World here it means the the
[1:06:36] the science and the medicine and the
[1:06:39] politics and the sin and and the
[1:06:42] degradation
[1:06:43] it's talking about the spirit it's
[1:06:45] talking about the germs it's talking
[1:06:46] about the diseases it's talking about
[1:06:48] the world order amen just like is very
[1:06:53] prominent and people's verbiage today
[1:06:55] they want to talk about a one world
[1:06:58] order
[1:06:59] well that's what they're talking about
[1:07:00] the order the structure of the world not
[1:07:04] the not the chemistry of the earth not
[1:07:06] the actual uh uh uh makeup of the Earth
[1:07:10] itself but the world order is what
[1:07:13] perished it's understand so everybody
[1:07:16] and all the things that were there
[1:07:19] all the animals uh all the things of the
[1:07:23] Earth
[1:07:23] were changed by that perishing were
[1:07:27] loosed
[1:07:29] but it was simply the world order amen
[1:07:32] the world ordered so when it says
[1:07:35] whereby the world that then was being
[1:07:39] overflowed with water perished that
[1:07:41] means the old Andalusian World ceased to
[1:07:45] exist
[1:07:46] only ones that came through there were
[1:07:48] the eight that were on the arm the
[1:07:51] animals and and those but the only human
[1:07:53] life were Noah his wife his sons and
[1:07:56] their wives That's the only ones that
[1:07:58] came out of the Andalusian world into
[1:08:01] the next new beginning
[1:08:03] the next World the the uh uh the the
[1:08:07] world order perished okay
[1:08:13] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[1:08:16] now
[1:08:17] by the same word are kept in store
[1:08:20] reserved unto fire against the day of
[1:08:23] judgment and Perdition of ungodly men
[1:08:27] and that's destruction Perdition is just
[1:08:30] the destruction of ungodly men
[1:08:33] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:08:36] thing that one day is with the Lord is a
[1:08:38] thousand years a thousand years is one
[1:08:39] day the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:08:42] promise as some men count slackness but
[1:08:45] his long-suffering to us word not
[1:08:48] willing to any should perish but that
[1:08:50] all should come to repentance
[1:08:52] the sad part about that is the more
[1:08:55] grace it seems and the more time it
[1:08:58] seems that God gives to humanity the
[1:09:01] worse humanity is
[1:09:03] instead of taking that time taking that
[1:09:06] extra Grace taking that extra time that
[1:09:09] God's given for repentance people are
[1:09:11] taking it and stopping at it instead
[1:09:13] right they're not taking advantage of
[1:09:16] the of the long-suffering of God they're
[1:09:19] just seemingly getting worse
[1:09:22] and I say seemingly just to be polite we
[1:09:25] all know it is and it's going to be but
[1:09:28] yet God if there's just one soul
[1:09:31] and all of that you think oh it's just
[1:09:33] getting worse it's getting worse yes it
[1:09:35] is but if there's just one Soul that's
[1:09:37] worth 10 million World Saints comes in
[1:09:40] during God's long-suffering or or time
[1:09:43] because I I still don't understand why
[1:09:45] we're still here uh that's God's plan
[1:09:47] that's God's doing all I can tell you is
[1:09:50] he is long-suffering to us
[1:09:52] in in his will that none would perish
[1:09:55] knowing that it's getting worse but if
[1:09:58] there's just one that comes out of it
[1:10:00] it's just one soul that comes out of the
[1:10:02] long suffering is worth it it's worth it
[1:10:05] for us to continue to dwell here while
[1:10:09] God is doing his work
[1:10:12] amen that's why it's up to us to do our
[1:10:15] jobs if there's one person somebody can
[1:10:17] witness to somebody you can talk to amen
[1:10:21] that's what we do praise the Lord it's
[1:10:25] amazing I'm gonna say this it's amazing
[1:10:28] what a difference you can make in
[1:10:30] somebody's life just by projecting
[1:10:32] Christ to them
[1:10:34] you don't have to talk to them you don't
[1:10:36] have to witness to them you don't have
[1:10:39] to uh
[1:10:40] preach to them
[1:10:42] all you have to do is live a life in
[1:10:44] front of those people and they'll see
[1:10:46] Christ yes amen whether they want to or
[1:10:49] not whether it has a good effect on them
[1:10:52] or not they will see Christ
[1:10:54] and most of the time in my experience in
[1:10:57] my belief and you may call me naive but
[1:11:00] I believe it how it happens for the
[1:11:03] better
[1:11:04] yes your presence your mere presence in
[1:11:08] in people's lives will make them better
[1:11:11] yeah
[1:11:12] amen doesn't happen all the time I know
[1:11:14] sometimes I've experienced the other it
[1:11:16] makes them worse but a lot of times
[1:11:18] it'll make that person better
[1:11:21] amen it'll make that person better I've
[1:11:23] just experienced that on on the job uh
[1:11:27] just I haven't preached anybody talked
[1:11:31] to people from time about the Lord or uh
[1:11:33] things like that but I Don't Preach to
[1:11:36] anybody but my life does just be who you
[1:11:40] are amen and people start recognizing it
[1:11:43] and seeing that you know there's some
[1:11:45] value to it amen yeah there's some good
[1:11:47] to this I may not have just I may not
[1:11:50] have agreed with that person I may not
[1:11:52] have even liked him at first at first
[1:11:53] most of the time people look at a
[1:11:55] Christian especially ones that try to
[1:11:57] live the word like we do and think
[1:11:59] you're a holier than thou or something
[1:12:00] and they shun you to start with but when
[1:12:03] they get to know you and recognize you
[1:12:04] as a person amen not some Celestial
[1:12:07] being floating around somewhere you're a
[1:12:09] human you're a person yes it makes a
[1:12:12] difference it does more than probably
[1:12:14] we'll ever recognize but it makes a
[1:12:16] difference just projecting Christ to
[1:12:18] somebody
[1:12:19] amen it makes a difference it doesn't
[1:12:22] it'll change their life
[1:12:24] amen you're changing lives and don't
[1:12:26] realize it sometimes but it's the truth
[1:12:28] yes amen
[1:12:31] let's continue on the Lord is not slack
[1:12:34] concerning his promises some men count
[1:12:36] slightness is long-suffering to us word
[1:12:38] not willing to any should perish but all
[1:12:40] should come to repentance is just one
[1:12:42] Soul Thing
[1:12:44] that'd be great amen maybe more amen but
[1:12:47] if it's just one
[1:12:49] but the day of the Lord look now the day
[1:12:52] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[1:12:54] night we know that in the which the
[1:12:55] heaven shall pass away the heavens shall
[1:12:58] pass away with a great noise
[1:13:02] and the and then listen to what's going
[1:13:04] to happen
[1:13:05] Heaven shall pass away again it's the
[1:13:07] same word
[1:13:09] we look at pass away it's the same word
[1:13:11] it's not an Annihilation it's a changing
[1:13:14] it's a loosing from one form to another
[1:13:17] okay Heaven shall change uh shall pass
[1:13:23] away
[1:13:24] with a great noise
[1:13:26] and the elements
[1:13:28] shall melt with fervent heat that is a
[1:13:33] hot hotter than hot amen a fervent heat
[1:13:35] is a burning passionate hotter than hot
[1:13:38] can be than we could think
[1:13:40] you think white hot has no comparison to
[1:13:43] this fervent Heat
[1:13:45] elements will melt with fervent heat the
[1:13:47] Earth also look now and the works the
[1:13:52] works
[1:13:53] now recognize what we said a minute ago
[1:13:55] about the world Cosmos
[1:13:58] what is the world Cosmos it's the world
[1:14:01] order or the works that are therein
[1:14:05] the worst happening on the Earth
[1:14:08] the spirits the denominations the
[1:14:12] government
[1:14:13] the politics the sin
[1:14:15] covid germs diseases the Wows of the
[1:14:20] devil all of that the works what's going
[1:14:23] to happen the Earth also and the works
[1:14:26] that are therein shall be burned up
[1:14:30] shall be burned pass away
[1:14:33] change
[1:14:35] to all the germs the worst will be done
[1:14:38] away with this Earth will undergo a
[1:14:41] comfort uh uh uh
[1:14:44] a change
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] a change from one form to another it's
[1:14:52] God preparing it when when John saw it
[1:14:55] he saw it after this had taken place
[1:15:00] again another reason maybe why I think
[1:15:02] it will probably be before the white
[1:15:04] Throne judgment after the white Throne
[1:15:06] judgment we just go back into eternity
[1:15:08] right amen and and God sets up this city
[1:15:11] that we go live in so but when John saw
[1:15:15] it when God showed it to John he saw it
[1:15:18] in its new condition
[1:15:21] he saw it in its perfected condition if
[1:15:24] you will he saw it as God did after what
[1:15:28] Peter is telling us here after the part
[1:15:32] that heavens and earth pass away that
[1:15:35] all the elements and The Works therein
[1:15:37] burn up
[1:15:39] sing then now that all uh all these
[1:15:42] things shall be dissolved what men are a
[1:15:44] person ought ye to be an all-holy
[1:15:46] conversation and godliness
[1:15:48] amen if that doesn't shake us to our
[1:15:51] very core what is it going to take amen
[1:15:53] that's right amen
[1:15:56] looking for
[1:15:58] and Hasting unto the coming of the day
[1:16:00] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[1:16:03] shall be dissolved
[1:16:06] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:16:09] Heat
[1:16:11] dissolves and melt with fervent Heat
[1:16:15] now I want to show you something we had
[1:16:17] the perished a minute ago
[1:16:22] amen this is the pass away
[1:16:28] foreign
[1:16:29] I had a couple things I wanted to show
[1:16:31] to you because when you start breaking
[1:16:33] it down and looking it makes a big
[1:16:35] difference now when it talks about
[1:16:37] dissolving look again 12 first looking
[1:16:40] forward Hasting unto the coming of the
[1:16:41] day of the Lord wherein the heavens
[1:16:43] being on fire shall be dissolved
[1:16:46] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:16:48] Heat this dissolved look yes works with
[1:16:53] the passing away
[1:16:55] means Greek I can't it's l-u-o whatever
[1:16:59] that however you pronounce that
[1:17:01] those with the same passing away as as
[1:17:05] Matthew 24 35
[1:17:07] when Jesus said heavens and earth will
[1:17:10] what pass away but my word shall never
[1:17:14] pass away or change from one form to
[1:17:19] another Heaven and Earth will change
[1:17:22] from one form to another but my word
[1:17:25] cannot change am I amen
[1:17:28] him that word being that the word is
[1:17:31] Christ
[1:17:32] it can't change because it's gone it's
[1:17:36] Eternal anything is eternal as God God's
[1:17:39] the only thing that's the only one
[1:17:40] that's Eternal cannot change
[1:17:43] cannot get better can I have a better
[1:17:46] thought can I have a better idea
[1:17:49] it cannot be uh anything wrong with his
[1:17:53] thoughts
[1:17:54] everything is perfect in God
[1:17:58] cannot change dissolved
[1:18:01] same now is to break or to unloose
[1:18:05] again what did we talk about
[1:18:09] losing or or taking away too loose look
[1:18:13] to lose any person or anything tied or
[1:18:17] fastened tight or fastened let me read
[1:18:21] you this quote
[1:18:23] so many of these things go together
[1:18:24] Saint so please bear with me but in
[1:18:27] Future Hope brother random talks about
[1:18:29] this passing away look here for a second
[1:18:33] the Greek word passed away he said how
[1:18:36] this world how's this world going to
[1:18:38] pass away and we're going to live on it
[1:18:40] remember we're going to live here
[1:18:44] here on this Earth that God created
[1:18:46] remember this is a restored Eden we're
[1:18:48] talking about this isn't something
[1:18:50] floating out in the stratosphere
[1:18:51] somewhere this is here amen this is here
[1:18:55] how is it going to pass away we're going
[1:18:57] to live on it notice he said he spelled
[1:19:00] it out
[1:19:03] p-a-r-e-r-e-c-h-o-m-i-a uh I don't know
[1:19:06] how to pronounce it he didn't know how
[1:19:07] anyway now that way inspiration strikes
[1:19:11] me something goes and writes it down
[1:19:12] heavens and earth will pass away now the
[1:19:16] word means passing from one form to
[1:19:19] another
[1:19:20] passing from one form to another
[1:19:22] remember it falls in the same category
[1:19:26] or lines with dissolved where it means
[1:19:30] to melt or too loose to let grip to let
[1:19:34] hold of
[1:19:35] remember what Satan's going to have to
[1:19:38] do
[1:19:39] Satan is going to lose his grip on this
[1:19:42] Earth he's going to lose his grip on
[1:19:45] everything that he's had control over
[1:19:46] for all these thousands of years he will
[1:19:49] lose his grip over it he will for a
[1:19:51] short period of time a thousand years
[1:19:53] during the Millennium but then he's
[1:19:55] loose to give but what's him the prophet
[1:19:57] the Beast are cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:20:00] his grip over all of this is loosed he
[1:20:04] has to take his dirty hands off of it
[1:20:07] once and for all amen praise the Lord
[1:20:13] let me go down a little bit Jesus used
[1:20:16] the same word Matthew 19 he's talking
[1:20:18] about Matthew 19. uh
[1:20:21] now he said you've set in my father's
[1:20:24] Kingdom regenerated changed
[1:20:27] we use the same word as he used the word
[1:20:31] when he said to the cult remember when
[1:20:34] the the the Palm Sunday was coming and
[1:20:37] he told his disciples go and you'll find
[1:20:39] a cult of this tide he said loose him
[1:20:42] and bring him to me it's the scripture
[1:20:45] brother Brown was referring to he said
[1:20:47] to the coal said loose the cold and let
[1:20:50] him go lose him let him go same word
[1:20:54] here the same thing the resurrection of
[1:20:57] Lazarus loose him he was bound Lazarus
[1:21:02] was in grave clothes when he came forth
[1:21:05] he proclaimed to those around him loose
[1:21:08] him and let him go free
[1:21:11] praise the Lord you see that's that same
[1:21:14] uh word that he's telling us here he's
[1:21:17] been tied let him go what does it mean
[1:21:19] the Earth will be loosed from the grip
[1:21:22] of Satan it will be loose from politics
[1:21:25] it will be loose from the nominational
[1:21:28] religious systems to be used for the
[1:21:31] kingdom of God to be established here on
[1:21:34] this Earth again
[1:21:36] as long as it's in Satan's hands it is
[1:21:40] politics Satan's the ruler of the earth
[1:21:43] he owns it it belongs to him they can
[1:21:45] fight back and forth they can scream
[1:21:47] elephant or donkey they can yell
[1:21:48] Democrat Republican independent all they
[1:21:51] want they can change parties all they
[1:21:53] want but every bit of it is of the devil
[1:21:55] and is rotten to the core yeah amen
[1:21:58] every bit of it I don't care who's in
[1:22:01] office I don't care who's not in office
[1:22:03] I don't care who's speaker I don't care
[1:22:05] who's this that and the other amen and I
[1:22:08] say I don't care I do care but the
[1:22:10] bottom line is none of it matters
[1:22:12] because every bit of it's corrupt it's
[1:22:15] all of the devil the whole system's
[1:22:17] corrupt yeah yeah the whole system is
[1:22:19] corrupt it's of the devil amen but Satan
[1:22:22] is going to have to lose his grip off of
[1:22:24] that
[1:22:25] as long as it belongs in Satan's hands
[1:22:28] and it still does politics Satan the
[1:22:32] ruler of this Earth owns it it belongs
[1:22:34] to him but Christ has redeemed it and
[1:22:37] now is the time that we're reading that
[1:22:40] God takes control over the property that
[1:22:43] his son redeemed back amen praise the
[1:22:46] Lord
[1:22:48] dripped his blood upon it and redeemed
[1:22:50] it back Satan still a squatter he still
[1:22:54] has control over it but he's loosed his
[1:22:57] grip but now when when when this takes
[1:23:01] place when this passing away unfolds his
[1:23:05] grip will come be completely gone yes
[1:23:07] that's why we blend right back from the
[1:23:10] time back into eternity again
[1:23:12] because Satan's grip has been loosed and
[1:23:15] it has and has Blended right back again
[1:23:19] from time back into eternity again
[1:23:22] the only way
[1:23:23] it Blended out of Eternity because of
[1:23:26] Satan because of sin in the Garden of
[1:23:28] Eden
[1:23:29] amen it Blends right back into eternity
[1:23:33] when he is done away with and he has no
[1:23:35] more grip over it
[1:23:37] praise the Lord so what does that tell
[1:23:38] you about time
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:42] look now one time it was his property
[1:23:45] but not now one time he talked about
[1:23:48] that little woman was his property look
[1:23:51] at this now
[1:23:53] one time that little woman was his
[1:23:55] property but not now one time I was his
[1:23:58] property but no more
[1:24:00] it was a day when you were his property
[1:24:03] and I'd say that word was depending on
[1:24:05] your faith but was his property but no
[1:24:08] more amen right I don't belong to him
[1:24:10] anymore I'm no longer his property he's
[1:24:13] had to loose me
[1:24:15] and set me free Amen to Worship the Lord
[1:24:19] he come to loose the grip of it he
[1:24:22] loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my
[1:24:24] life upon your life and now we are not
[1:24:28] his
[1:24:29] have you often heard me say in prayer
[1:24:31] take your hands off of God's Property
[1:24:33] amen listen now have faith to claim your
[1:24:38] own
[1:24:40] that's your rights
[1:24:43] amen have the faith to claim them they
[1:24:47] belong to you
[1:24:48] take your hands off of him take your
[1:24:51] hands off of her see faith will do it
[1:24:54] cause the grip of Satan to be loosed
[1:24:57] because it no longer belongs to him
[1:25:00] by the authority of God's word and you
[1:25:04] in his life Satan has to loose his grip
[1:25:07] off of that now Satan is losing his grip
[1:25:09] off of all of the earth everything about
[1:25:12] the Earth let's look at this future home
[1:25:17] notice here
[1:25:18] he's talking about Bible students he
[1:25:20] said when you look at that word I'll
[1:25:21] just use this to
[1:25:23] patch it in for you if you will
[1:25:25] and look at that word there in second
[1:25:28] Peter 3. he uses the word world
[1:25:32] as the Greek word says it means Cosmos
[1:25:36] which means the world order
[1:25:39] the Earth shall pass away melt the
[1:25:42] elements with fervent heat see doesn't
[1:25:44] mean the Earth the planet is going to
[1:25:47] pass away but the world Cosmos the
[1:25:51] politics Center systems sin diseases
[1:25:55] germs everything that is wrong will pass
[1:25:59] away
[1:26:00] done away with
[1:26:02] elements
[1:26:04] The Works will melt with fervent heat no
[1:26:08] wonder John saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:26:10] Earth
[1:26:11] no wonder everything that was a part of
[1:26:13] what this Earth used to contain what
[1:26:16] even the heavens and the atmospheres
[1:26:19] the germs diseases the sin and all in
[1:26:23] the atmosphere
[1:26:25] devils and demons
[1:26:27] principalities of the powers of the air
[1:26:30] will be done away with cast in the Lake
[1:26:32] of Fire and every bit of it will be
[1:26:35] annihilated will be cleansed amen the
[1:26:39] heavens will explode with fervent Heat
[1:26:43] the politics and all will be done away
[1:26:45] with
[1:26:46] Peter said it will melt with fervent
[1:26:48] heat the works that are there and not
[1:26:50] the planet The Works therein
[1:26:52] The Works of man all their politicians
[1:26:55] in their schemes all their denominations
[1:26:56] and man-made schemes will all go with it
[1:26:59] when it burns heavens and earth will
[1:27:02] pass away with a great noise
[1:27:04] listen the whole earth will be on fire
[1:27:07] and will ignite the gases that's in the
[1:27:11] earth and explode it
[1:27:13] exactly now I'm saying this because it's
[1:27:16] bringing us to to a point here and I'm
[1:27:19] running out of time to make my point but
[1:27:21] I will uh before we get into the next
[1:27:24] one
[1:27:26] there's there's something that this is
[1:27:28] doing
[1:27:29] it's simply not just purifying the Earth
[1:27:33] although that is the utmost importance
[1:27:35] friends
[1:27:36] putting the Earth back on his proper
[1:27:38] axis like it's supposed to be remember
[1:27:41] everything that everything that is that
[1:27:43] happened during this time blip is going
[1:27:45] to be made right
[1:27:47] amen and and the tilting of this Earth
[1:27:50] happened during this time blip
[1:27:53] amen during the flood it will be brought
[1:27:56] back in its proper place in its proper
[1:27:58] condition everything will be made right
[1:28:00] God will make every single thing that
[1:28:03] was corrupted by Satan right again
[1:28:05] in his perfect will perfect will perfect
[1:28:09] will is God's eternity yes permissive
[1:28:12] Willis when we entered into time yes
[1:28:15] will be made right all of this is
[1:28:18] bringing about the Earth of of the
[1:28:22] explosions and the convulsions of this
[1:28:25] Earth
[1:28:25] it's going to is is going to change it
[1:28:28] and bring about a tremendous
[1:28:31] cataclysmic event
[1:28:34] listen now
[1:28:35] the whole earth will be on fire the
[1:28:37] gases will ignite the Earth will explode
[1:28:41] the Bible said and heavens and earth
[1:28:43] will pass away the great noise such as
[1:28:45] such an explosion will rock his whole
[1:28:48] mind he says because it's got to kill
[1:28:50] every disease
[1:28:52] every thistle every Thorn everything
[1:28:56] there is to be done the fire will burn
[1:28:58] it up purify it what did we say a few
[1:29:01] Services ago best purifier that we even
[1:29:04] know or have today is fire
[1:29:06] amen remember it's not all together just
[1:29:10] a literal fire but it's a Holy Fire
[1:29:13] even the H2O the water will explode
[1:29:17] amen because remember
[1:29:20] half of water is hydrogen
[1:29:23] hydrogen and oxygen amen so even the
[1:29:27] water the hydrogen the H2O will explode
[1:29:30] no more Seas
[1:29:32] praise the Lord see it's setting
[1:29:34] something up
[1:29:35] no more scenes right okay
[1:29:38] you know when man receives a fiery
[1:29:40] baptism there's a lot of noise around
[1:29:42] amen yes there is they think that's a
[1:29:46] shame to hear people scream shout like
[1:29:48] that just wait till this Earth gets her
[1:29:50] baptism it'll explode the water the H2O
[1:29:54] and there'll be no more seed
[1:29:57] this will change the whole surface of
[1:30:00] the entire Earth shall burst and blow to
[1:30:03] Pieces all the outside the crust and for
[1:30:06] hundreds of feet below it it'll just
[1:30:08] simply be completely demolished
[1:30:11] not annihilated
[1:30:13] amen but changed right right amen even
[1:30:17] to uh as he said hundreds of feet below
[1:30:20] the crust
[1:30:22] the atmospheres the gases that's in the
[1:30:25] earth now where they're finding missiles
[1:30:27] they can't get through up there the
[1:30:28] sphere somewhere all kinds of gases they
[1:30:31] say that'll bust a burst a holy wrath of
[1:30:34] God will it will will ignite and cleanse
[1:30:37] the entire surface of the Earth now why
[1:30:40] why are we why are we talking about this
[1:30:43] because it's got to bring something it's
[1:30:46] got to bring something about
[1:30:48] because
[1:30:50] in this
[1:30:52] time element
[1:30:55] eternity time element we still have what
[1:30:57] we know of as this planet Earth that we
[1:31:00] live on
[1:31:04] bursting
[1:31:06] exploding I'll make it a little bit
[1:31:08] better than that later but
[1:31:09] bursting exploding even to underneath
[1:31:13] the Earth
[1:31:14] to where even the gases and think about
[1:31:17] all the petroleum we pump out even from
[1:31:20] under the earth now
[1:31:21] I mean they talk about super volcanoes
[1:31:23] and all these things friend that's just
[1:31:25] a drop in the bucket to what's going to
[1:31:27] happen to this planet right amen and all
[1:31:30] that under the Earth
[1:31:32] it's got to do something look here now
[1:31:35] I know I'm not finished in second Peter
[1:31:36] but
[1:31:38] let's go over Revelation I I I'd save
[1:31:41] this for next service but let me just
[1:31:43] read this as we'll finish this
[1:31:45] for today
[1:31:47] uh
[1:31:49] I'm sorry
[1:31:51] that's horrible
[1:31:54] that's not even a good egg
[1:31:56] I Must List a good Circle all right
[1:31:59] that's a little better
[1:32:01] the Earth
[1:32:03] I was gonna say this for next time but
[1:32:04] remember no more C
[1:32:06] no more C and what was our lesson that
[1:32:08] we talked about with with with uh with
[1:32:11] Abraham when Abraham met Melchizedek
[1:32:15] Abraham was looking for what a city
[1:32:19] who's looking for a city whose Builder
[1:32:21] and maker is gone that city is the same
[1:32:24] one we just read that John said I saw
[1:32:26] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[1:32:28] from God
[1:32:29] that's the city he was looking for when
[1:32:32] he went looking he ran into the
[1:32:35] president
[1:32:37] the Elohim
[1:32:39] God
[1:32:40] the logos that was in Elohim the thought
[1:32:44] expression of God spoken
[1:32:47] formed into the person of Melchizedek
[1:32:52] I say person for lack of better
[1:32:55] phraseology or terminology
[1:32:59] unfolding into that low boss down
[1:33:03] condescending down into a human body
[1:33:06] that we call Jesus Christ
[1:33:09] same blow boss same God not a different
[1:33:11] God just like the books we talked about
[1:33:15] last week amen unfolding in from one to
[1:33:19] the other one's the natural birth the
[1:33:21] other's the spiritual birth but one
[1:33:23] leading to the other not two books but
[1:33:25] the one amen he's not two Gods he's one
[1:33:28] amen but he's unfolding himself in the
[1:33:32] manifestation of these offices that he
[1:33:35] sought to declare on the earth what was
[1:33:38] already declared in the heavens
[1:33:40] when Melchizedek came and Abraham found
[1:33:43] him and and he came to him the slaughter
[1:33:46] of the Kings as Abraham was looking for
[1:33:49] this city he ran into
[1:33:52] Melchizedek yes Jesus Christ got himself
[1:33:57] the city himself
[1:33:59] amen he ran into him on the literal spot
[1:34:02] he had communion had fellowship with
[1:34:05] Melchizedek communion bread water wine
[1:34:08] on the literal spot where this city will
[1:34:11] be put will come down
[1:34:14] where this city will be that we will
[1:34:16] enjoy we got to talk about the
[1:34:18] dimensions and all those things yes but
[1:34:21] the explosion as I get to here that
[1:34:24] explosion is going to and I've done the
[1:34:27] dimensions I have a very accurate on a
[1:34:31] thumb drive somewhere drawing of of the
[1:34:34] approximate Dimensions very close though
[1:34:37] I did it uh by scale as close as I could
[1:34:41] of the Earth
[1:34:43] and this pyramid-shaped mountain
[1:34:47] that is going to push up out from the
[1:34:49] Earth
[1:34:50] all of this explosion
[1:34:53] not a very good pyramid Mountain but
[1:34:55] that's that's approximately what it's
[1:34:57] going to look like because one time I
[1:34:58] thought the size of this thing and I
[1:35:00] thought how is this Earth but when you
[1:35:03] look at the dimensions of the earth it's
[1:35:06] absolutely entirely feasible that it
[1:35:09] just takes up of this mountain as big as
[1:35:12] it is this pyramid-shaped mouth of this
[1:35:14] city this place where where this city
[1:35:17] will set off is going to be
[1:35:19] easily
[1:35:21] brought up or pushed up out of this
[1:35:25] Earth in all the explosions all the
[1:35:27] changes all the belchings of the Earth
[1:35:30] from down a hundred feet below will
[1:35:32] press and push this pyramid-shaped
[1:35:34] mountain up you say how will that happen
[1:35:36] how all these mountains out here today
[1:35:40] how did this mountain over here get to
[1:35:42] where it's at
[1:35:43] somebody just dropped some dirt one day
[1:35:45] and there it is
[1:35:47] no even science says that these plates
[1:35:51] come together and it pushes them right
[1:35:53] straight up
[1:35:54] you think well this seems impossible no
[1:35:57] it's not right how is that impossible we
[1:35:59] see the things we got here today God's
[1:36:01] not changing right
[1:36:03] amen is still the same even the
[1:36:05] explosion everything it's all going to
[1:36:07] be it's still going to be this Earth
[1:36:08] that pushes up this pyramid-shaped
[1:36:11] mountain seeing a lot of people don't
[1:36:12] don't grasp or understand that but let's
[1:36:15] let me read this real quick
[1:36:17] let me make sure I got my uh scriptures
[1:36:20] that I had here I wanted to get correct
[1:36:23] 15 and 16. same Revelation 21
[1:36:27] and he that talked with me had a golden
[1:36:30] Reed to measure the city
[1:36:32] and the gates thereof and the wall
[1:36:34] thereof and the city lieth Foursquare
[1:36:38] amen Foursquare
[1:36:41] and we'll get to that later and the
[1:36:43] length is as large as the breath and he
[1:36:46] measured the city with the Reed 12
[1:36:50] 000 furlongs the length and the breadth
[1:36:52] and the height of it are equal
[1:36:55] the link and the breadth and the height
[1:36:57] of it are equal now going back to most a
[1:37:02] lot of people I would say most in the
[1:37:05] Christian belief
[1:37:06] still believe and will teach that this
[1:37:10] is a cube
[1:37:12] that this is acute but it cannot be
[1:37:14] acute and we'll talk about why later
[1:37:18] but there is another
[1:37:22] shape
[1:37:24] that can meet these dimensions of four
[1:37:27] square and exactly the same on every
[1:37:29] side and that is a pyramid
[1:37:33] a pyramid
[1:37:34] as such that goes
[1:37:38] up to the top that's the same in every
[1:37:41] side
[1:37:42] amen now if the I'll just say this real
[1:37:46] quick if the lamb is to be the light
[1:37:49] obviously a perfect shape pyramid is
[1:37:52] going to be more earthy than that like
[1:37:54] our mountains out here it's not going to
[1:37:56] be straight up
[1:37:57] um it is going to be more mountain-ish
[1:38:00] this pyramid-shaped mountain that's
[1:38:02] going to be but if it is a cube and the
[1:38:07] lamb is the light of that City how is
[1:38:09] the how is the Lamb going to light up
[1:38:10] the whole city if it's a cube there's
[1:38:13] going to be sides of it that couldn't
[1:38:14] see the light right at all but if the
[1:38:17] lamb is the light and it's and he is up
[1:38:20] here
[1:38:21] it can light down over all sides of this
[1:38:24] pyramid from the top to the bottom right
[1:38:27] the whole the entire city will be
[1:38:30] illuminated
[1:38:31] continuously by the lamb being the light
[1:38:36] amen amen disappeared so all this
[1:38:39] shaking and changing yes it is to purify
[1:38:43] it is to get rid of all the sin it is to
[1:38:45] get rid of all the destruction and the
[1:38:47] diseases and the and the sin the
[1:38:49] politics it is to do all that and get
[1:38:51] rid of all that but it's also bouncing
[1:38:54] underneath to get to to make to get rid
[1:38:56] of the seas because there'll be no more
[1:38:58] seed because remember this is uh as it
[1:39:02] said the uh 140 uh four cubits it's 1500
[1:39:07] Miles Square
[1:39:08] it's 1500 miles this way and 1500 miles
[1:39:11] this way 1500 miles up because it's it's
[1:39:14] a perfect Dimension remember
[1:39:16] 1500 miles
[1:39:18] so if it's that and it's over in
[1:39:21] Palestine well where are you going to
[1:39:23] have 1500 feet by 1500 feet anywhere
[1:39:26] that's not going to be interrupted by
[1:39:27] water
[1:39:29] so there has to be no more C for this
[1:39:31] thing to push up to be at a place to
[1:39:33] where God can bring his holy city down
[1:39:36] right amen so as we go back
[1:39:40] I know I've thrown a lot out there that
[1:39:42] I'm going to have to solidify later uh
[1:39:45] but please bear with me
[1:39:47] but let's go back to the first first saw
[1:39:49] new Heaven and new earth I hope what
[1:39:52] we've talked about here is kind of
[1:39:53] explained that amen it's not that God
[1:39:57] started over again with Genesis 1. nope
[1:40:00] just took what was here and purified it
[1:40:03] changed it
[1:40:05] verse heaven and first Earth were passed
[1:40:07] away or changed from one form to another
[1:40:10] there is no mercy or loosed loosed amen
[1:40:13] no more seeing and I John saw the holy
[1:40:16] city New Jerusalem coming down from God
[1:40:19] out of heaven
[1:40:22] coming down from God out of Heaven
[1:40:24] prepared as I brought a door for her
[1:40:25] husband coming down and setting Upon
[1:40:28] This Mountain this city comes and sits
[1:40:31] the city comes and sits right right down
[1:40:33] on this mountain that God had prepared
[1:40:35] for us
[1:40:37] amen so many of the things of this that
[1:40:40] I just love to get into that we will
[1:40:42] later
[1:40:42] but let me leave you with this
[1:40:46] this Mount this city this mountain this
[1:40:49] pyramid
[1:40:51] remember
[1:40:53] is 1500 miles
[1:40:56] High
[1:40:58] the same as it is 1500 miles wide
[1:41:01] it has to be squared has to be a perfect
[1:41:04] Dimension or or the Q people are right
[1:41:07] amen so it has to be 1500 wide has to be
[1:41:10] 1500 long has to be 1500 times you ever
[1:41:13] thought of How High 1500 and 1500 miles
[1:41:16] is
[1:41:18] you know that we travel on airplanes at
[1:41:20] about 30 000 feet
[1:41:23] that's
[1:41:25] seven miles
[1:41:27] you ever flown an airplane you better
[1:41:29] flown an airplane yes you ever gone 30
[1:41:32] 000 feet you look down and semi trucks
[1:41:34] look like smaller than ants
[1:41:37] trains look like smaller than centipedes
[1:41:40] crawling along the ground and that's
[1:41:41] only what's 30 000 divided by 52.80
[1:41:46] whatever that is I've I don't have that
[1:41:48] in my notes
[1:41:49] was that six six miles
[1:41:54] that's six months
[1:41:56] this city is going to be
[1:41:59] 1500 miles high
[1:42:02] it's going to be over 200 percent higher
[1:42:07] than an airplane flies
[1:42:10] do you think about
[1:42:12] this that God has set up
[1:42:15] that how big it's going to be but how
[1:42:18] high it's going to be
[1:42:20] it's it's
[1:42:21] and the fact that the lamb is going to
[1:42:24] illuminate the entire city
[1:42:26] praise the Lord amen amen let's stand
[1:42:29] I'm going to stop there
[1:42:37] that was that is as I have done this
[1:42:42] one of the most fantastic details
[1:42:45] of this whole thing you got streets of
[1:42:50] gold and all the things that it talks
[1:42:52] about
[1:42:55] but that
[1:42:57] when I first learned about that one the
[1:43:00] Lord first showed me that it blew my
[1:43:02] mind
[1:43:04] 1500 200 I forgot it's 230 some I'll do
[1:43:08] the math later
[1:43:09] 230 some times higher than an airplane
[1:43:12] Fox instead of
[1:43:15] 7.9 million feet
[1:43:19] you can figure that out
[1:43:22] that's how high the city is going to be
[1:43:24] that's how high of a mountain that's why
[1:43:26] I wonder how is that going to come out
[1:43:28] of the Earth but it's very very
[1:43:30] plausible and then when you know the
[1:43:32] dimensions of the earth which I did all
[1:43:34] that to one time
[1:43:36] amen I wasn't even intending to get to
[1:43:38] that part today but anyway one thing
[1:43:40] just kind of led to another and And
[1:43:42] discussing this destruction to bring us
[1:43:45] to this point amen that's the reason
[1:43:47] that's one of the reasons for it one of
[1:43:49] the grand reasons is to bring this into
[1:43:52] being amen praise the Lord
[1:43:56] amen I'm so thankful that God has a
[1:43:59] place that he's already prepared for us
[1:44:01] amen amen praise the Lord let's see a
[1:44:04] couple of courses of this amen looking
[1:44:07] for that City praise the Lord Abraham
[1:44:10] went looking for it my heart's Desiring
[1:44:12] it amen
[1:44:13] I'm looking for a city the one not made
[1:44:18] by hands
[1:44:25] the waters will be parted and I'll be on
[1:44:29] my way as we're crossing over Jordan I
[1:44:34] can sing now I have that
[1:44:39] Everlasting towards

[1:46:45] Lord God Rich says bless you I heard now
[1:46:48] those you may have went to Harmony I'm
[1:46:50] not sure if any of you did I wasn't able
[1:46:52] to uh as you know I wasn't here last
[1:46:55] week and then Saturday when I got home I
[1:46:57] was not feeling good at all and as
[1:46:59] witnessed here Sunday
[1:47:01] but I heard it was told that Bobby
[1:47:05] announced that that was the last Harmony
[1:47:08] uh so
[1:47:10] I
[1:47:11] don't know who of you may or may not be
[1:47:13] interested in that fact but that was
[1:47:16] what he announced that this last Harmony
[1:47:18] was the last Harmony so uh it was nice
[1:47:22] while it lasted uh it kind of got to
[1:47:25] work
[1:47:26] it was
[1:47:28] um
[1:47:30] not very well attended I remember the
[1:47:33] days when we when he first started
[1:47:35] having it I went to the very first I
[1:47:37] went to every one of the first ones for
[1:47:39] a longest time I could say I'd gone to
[1:47:41] every one of them for years but
[1:47:45] uh when they when he moved it over to
[1:47:48] the old Ramada the Center City Motel
[1:47:51] whatever it is over there now
[1:47:53] um I
[1:47:54] took up three ballrooms it was over a
[1:47:57] thousand people there
[1:47:58] now they were struggling to get Philip
[1:48:01] Tabernacle uh so I guess he just felt
[1:48:05] that the time had run its course uh
[1:48:08] maybe you don't know but John Yarbrough
[1:48:10] is the one that named it Harmony of the
[1:48:12] desert we all had meetings before it
[1:48:14] started and all was talking about
[1:48:16] different things and that was actually
[1:48:17] John's I John Yarbrough as I did a name
[1:48:19] in Harmony in the desert so it was nice
[1:48:22] I enjoyed it I appreciate brother Bobby
[1:48:23] for doing what he did with it
[1:48:25] finding it for all these years but for
[1:48:28] those you may not know that he did say
[1:48:30] that that was going to be the last one
[1:48:33] so anyway pray for him
[1:48:36] um this uh miss seeing him and a lot of
[1:48:39] the fellowship we used to have with
