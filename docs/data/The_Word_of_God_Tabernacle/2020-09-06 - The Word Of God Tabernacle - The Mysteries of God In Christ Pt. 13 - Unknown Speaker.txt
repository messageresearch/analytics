service we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to come and filtrate hinder or hurt this service in any way god but we also want to take a time lord to dedicate this place to you god and to surrender it to you father for all that is done is truly the labors the efforts and all this done lord for your glory and honor god nothing that we can do or say but only what we've given to you lord for what you've given to us we thank you so much for it may this building be a place lord that is the habitation of the holy spirit god as we come and feel your presence and know you to be real and come and power and manifestation of your spirit and have wonderful times together lord and lord may the much of the blessed word of jesus christ go forth lord from this place god and not only just here but around the world father for what is done we just thank you for it god we thank you so much for giving it to us and we did we just take this time and we dedicate this place right back to you and lord pray that it would be for your glory and honor bless us here today we just commit ourselves each one that's here those who weren't able to make it for whatever reason god we just committed to you lord now in the name of jesus christ believing you being the author and finisher of our faith for all that is done and said we give you glory praise and honor for it now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you amen welcome you can be seated if you'd like amen i want to personally thank brother roger there's only probably a few people know the efforts and the finances and all that brother roger and sister monica put into uh making this the place that it is obviously you can see it's not quite finished that's a few finishing touches to go but we finally got a decent electrician out here to put the lights in and got them wired up so that helped a little bit but now we're thankful for that but brother rogers put a lot of time effort finances into making this the carpet ceiling lights electrical everything monica with the drapes and bought the chairs the lord just blessed it all along when we first started this one of the first things we started thinking about actually separate but when we came together for job he mentioned it and i said that's what i had been talking about was getting chairs and uh the lord blessed chairs uh we were looking at paying 35 40 a chair for the exact same chair you're sitting in that he ended up paying less than 10 dollars a piece for maybe ten minutes delivered delivered and the little racks on the bottom cost two three dollars more per chair so the lord just from the very get-go my point is from the very get-go the lord's just blessed this and we're so thankful god has made a way and brought it to the place that it is today brother angel and his family his dad his brother his brother-in-law have done a lot of work getting the floor up and putting the carpet down and all that was done just so very thankful for everything that's been done to go into making this um and and still moving forward with it but what it is today and god's just been so good to us i had a wonderful time in the lord yesterday with the baptisms and uh just trust the lord bless that and each one of you today amen so we want to open our song books now if you did if you missed the song books apologize one of the things skipped my mind was a table back there me and brother roger talked about it but we i forgot to get one we had some at the house we could have brought a couple of them back in the back if you don't have a song book there's some back next to the door we just set them on the floor back there so if you need to grab one grab one we're going to turn to song number 426 uh we're going to start here and i think it's very powerful that one of the songs that i had yesterday to sing today micah was the very first song he started playing here so it's going to be the next song but uh very thankful for that i appreciate too of course uh sister norma as soon as i mentioned something about a pulpit norma said her daughter's friend uh kathy's friend wanted to build one for us and i said well praise the lord how do you want it and i sent a couple videos or a couple pictures there's nothing like the pictures but it's a beautiful pulpit sister norm was afraid i wouldn't like it because it wasn't like the picture i said sister the picture was just something to go by it wasn't exactly but then brother roger i told called brother roger said it was here and he's welcome to use it for his streaming and he got me looking so well this is just inspired of the lord the three-step justification sanctification the holy ghost comes right up into the cross right to the word amen and he didn't know anything about that the man who built this but the three steps of grace coming up from the bottom and coming right up into the cross amen that's all it is right to the word praise the lord so i appreciate daniel's his name so you want to mention his name in prayer who built this for us and i'm very thankful for that too so amen praise the lord 4 26 let's sing this song and uh worship the lord today that's what we're here for amen here to worship the lord amen it's good to have michael back with us good to see you again yesterday today amen thought you might have been in the

thank you jesus wonderful wonderful he is yes amen thank you lord we go to the lord in prayer now amen i have a couple of prayer requests i want to bring to your attention today but i forgot to mention too uh if you need to use the restroom it's through the door so if you don't mind if you have to please i'd prefer you didn't but if you have to go out to back the wall and go down the back and through the door and the bathroom's out there on the right uh you'll see the door there next to the refrigerator that's where the restroom is so if you need to go there so god bless you today um i got some news yesterday from north carolina that shocked me but was tough on the heart because it involved people that i know and know fairly well and micah does too fairly well um a couple young men that was that used to go to brother tim hume's church uh in gastonia north carolina was in a bad car accident yesterday and one of the young men passed uh he was 17 years old his name was nate from nathaniel barrett and quite a fine young man quite a godly family and he lost his life in the accident the other young man was caleb capps who of course brother roger knows kenny capps very well growing up the tabernacle in jeffersonville together uh kenny's son caleb katz he got banged up pretty bad he's supposed to be in surgery right now uh i don't know any details i don't know how it happened first thing i heard from was tabitha but then i saw on facebook several other ones that was mentioning in prayer and of course i'll let mike know and he remembers them he didn't necessarily they weren't necessarily that friend i guess because those they were 11 12 years old when he was there so it wasn't kind of the group that was with them but still that church at that time those young people they were very close and i spent a lot of time with because micah was there spent a lot of time with him a lot of times those young people and brother kenny and sister kim's boy was just little fella 11 12 years old but he's supposed to be in surgery right now i believe he has a broke leg and some other injuries so just please remember them in prayer if you would again i don't know what happened or any details but i know there is a grieving family for their son and he was i think he was 17 but he was married so he had a wife so please remember that family if you would the barrett family the cap family and all those that are associated affiliated back there it's a it's a little different in north carolina than it is in tucson if you've never been there or experienced it it's hard to understand but and to our shame in tucson uh we're not as close-knit as you'd say uh used to be that way in north carolina churches were against churches and people didn't fellowship together and stuff but past 15 20 years or so maybe not quite that long it's really changed and and really all the churches back there that are the message affiliation they're very close most of them are very close a lot of the young people spend time together there's a lot of fellowship together so not only are the families affected not only as a church they're going to but the church that they used to go to and i would promise you all the other churches that are local around there are grieving and and hurting this morning for for that of course nathaniel's he's at his reward so he's where we want to be but obviously it's a it's a tough time for them so please remember the barrett family cat family specifically in prayer and then all the ones that are affected by nate's passing and just and of course prayer for caleb's recovery from his injuries so please remember that prayer i got a request from sister shelia this morning she sent me a text and asked that we would had she had a couple of unspoken requests she wanted us to remember she wanted us to remember her son dominic as well again today he had a couple of his friends passed away lives in seattle a couple of his friends passed away recently one to cancer one to another ailment so just remember him in prayer if you would she asked prayer and unspoken request i know she has desired my heart too for her brother harlan she still continues to pray for him in the situation domestic situation he's in in texas so please remember that prayer if you would as well amen so remember these requests remember there's there's other several other uh people that i know and different ones that uh contracted coveted gotten over it but yesterday they had the funeral for brother joel mariello senior so please continue to remember the rio family in prayer joel jr i guess he's about 18 ish now 1718 himself and little isabel and what's probably not so little anymore and of course crystal mario so remember that uh family in prayer the lord would just continue to bless and comfort and be with them too so amen have unspoken requests on your heart and the lord knows all of our hearts today all the needs that we have all the desires that's in our heart let's stand to our feet if we could amen we'll uh take a moment and uh the angel and his family just pulled up but brother john would you go ahead just leave us in prayer brother if you would take these things yes lord in jesus christ's name lord once again we just thank you lord god for having us here lord god uh let's gather together our brothers and sisters lord may you just fill us lord god as it was spoken this morning lord god with your person or god that's the most important thing lord god is you know everything and uh have everything else lord about what it's will you that we really want father we really want to see you yes jesus and one another lord god thank you lord god if you're with us lord god and in us lord we're going to love one another father and that's what we're looking for god that loves in us lord god for one another in jesus christ's name we invite you lord yes submit the service into your hands and thank you lord god for both these

confident in his great love for all i'm saying [Music] the tempest may blow and the storm clouds arise obscuring the brightness of blood i'm never alarmed at the overcast skies the master looks on at the stride by faith in jesus [Music] trust for all hearts saved in his sheltering arms i'm living by faith i know that he safely will carry me through no matter what evil why should i then care though

praise the lord you know that last verse is quite outstanding i'm living by faith and i feel no alarm amen that's quite a statement today amen the world that we live in today has quite a statement to say that you can live in this world with everything that's going on and have no alarm because we live by faith not by sight but we can feel taste meal smell here but we live by faith amen faith in jesus i believe the lord is going to take care of us and watches over his own amen amen amen you say well just just had the memorial service for joel yesterday and he passed from covet well the lord has his way in everything and in every way so we trust him in all things and whatever god's will and you know joel senior past there coped and daniel barrett passed yesterday from a car wreck so it's all in god's hands yes and that's how we live we live trusting he's in god's hands amen we're not promised tomorrow we weren't promised today but we're thankful that god give us today god give us another opportunity today to do something for him and if we can't live our lives with the understanding that we're here to do something for him then we are here for the wrong purpose or the wrong attitude anyway we are bought with the price you always been watching the the the streamings we've been doing we're bought with a price we don't belong to ourselves we belong to him amen he is our portion he is the one that we look to he is our lord and our savior amen praise the lord so thank god for another day to do something for him if he gives us tomorrow may we serve him tomorrow better than we did today if it's at all possible give us the strength the ability to be able to do what he calls us to do amen praise the lord amen anyone have a song in your heart today if there's a short testimony burning then we'll take that too but somebody have a song you want to sing a short burning testimony [Music] i was so tired last night and i heard how jesus christ comes and visits when two or three are gathered together in his name and i was talking to the believer last night i was late my ass was getting later and lay her house get so tired and then we just started talking about the word and when we started talking about the word all of a sudden people complain they don't hear from god but as we were talking about the word all of a sudden thoughts just kept coming in we're online and and finally i woke up to god was speaking to us putting those thoughts in our minds just listen and just spell them out praise the lord and the more we listen the more my fatigue went away and pretty soon i was hopping up and down it's 3 30 in the morning before i move to the right oh my god jesus christ is in his word just just talk to one another that's how important fellowship is these meanings yes so thankful god give us the building so thankful we have a place to come to now it's just hard to explain you you know from your perspective but from my perspective of being here and seeing you and watching and having somebody to minister to it's been 30 years preaching to congregations of dozens or hundreds and and this is it was just it was very strange different i'm thankful the lord gave us the ability to stream and this and the technology and all that was good to be able to keep the food going out but looking at a computer uh that's looking back at you is a very uh very different we'll just say when it comes to ministering but amen anyone else have a see y'all made it praise the lord they fixed your car fast no kind of okay it's incredible so well then we're just gonna we'll lay hands on it when we leave thank you because we know the best mechanic amen and he'll honor you and on you all for being here today brother that's right anyone in a song praise the lord

[Music] [Music] hallelujah praise god praise god god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] oh it is amazing amen the amazing grace of god amen thank you cheyenne appreciate that it's a real blessing god bless you let's stand to our feet now and uh go to the word of god amen welcome again to the house of the lord appreciate each one of you being here today amen let's go to revelation chapter 10 we're going to begin uh our scripture reading again with verse 7 as we have done some of you maybe all of you know or been going dealing with the mysteries of god in christ or christ the mystery of god revealed kind of titled it a little backwards in the way brother branham did but that was for a purpose because of the mysteries of god in christ uh realizing what the scripture says about the mystery of god would be finished that mystery being jesus christ the revelation of who christ is he's not the second person of a trinity he's not just some good prophet he was god almighty build in flesh and upon that foundation is what this church is built upon his bride so mysteries of god in christ part 13 is what we're on now and having the preeminence in his people this would be part five of having the preeminence in his people so we'll begin at um uh revelation chapter 10 verse 7. read here again but in the days of the voice the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now you can be seated if you'd like i'm not going to background very much kind of hard to background 13 separate messages so if it's something in that that is uh you have to kind of catch up with maybe you can go back on youtube and look them up and see where we're at when we get to that point but basically what we're looking at is the word of god realizing the fulfillment brother branham in revelation 10 7 and the seventh angel message was to begin to sound then the mystery singular was to be finished and that mystery was jesus christ who christ is christ told them as they asked him and said who do men say that i am and they said some says your lies some says your prophet son says you're this or that and jesus looked at them personally and said but now who do you say that i am and peter spoke up and said thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus said flesh and blood had not revealed this but my father in heaven's revealed this to you reveal who he was to you and on that rock who jesus christ is i will build my church so the foundation of this building that he has preeminence in is that building that he's built up a mini-member body called the bride of jesus christ for this last day and we've worked on and looking at that foundation that was laid which is jesus christ again not some trinity not three gods but the god one god and him being that foundation that this church is built upon without that solid correct foundation it don't matter how many times you come to an altar don't matter how many times you get baptized it doesn't matter how many times you come to church how much size you pay or how good of a person you are unless that foundation is laid in your life of jesus christ and the revelation of who he is then you're lost that church is built on that foundation jesus christ that foundation that he said his church would be built upon who is jesus all those other things are great find when we're christians we we obey the word and we do what the word says and we baptize we come to church and we read the word and we're obedient to that but friend unless that foundation's there it'll be just like the just like the seed that ends up on the rock it'll be like the seed that ends up in stony ground it'll be like the seed that ends up in the wrong place that's sown in the wrong place but it's got to be in the right foundation the seed has got to be in the right foundation for it to grow up a house of the lord we've talked about that and we've got to the preeminence part and understanding what preeminence is and the preeminence that god has in his bride now that's what we're focused on so go to colossians and as we read this we enter into this subtitle having the preeminence in his people i want to go to colossians 1 17 again and you might want to hold your bibles near because i've got quite a few scriptures i want to try to get through today to finish this having the preeminence in his people subtitle lord willing next week we'll get to the third part or the restoration of the kingdom which would be the third part of this uh mysteries of god in christ or christ the mystery god revealed so we're going to try to read a few scriptures here but now first uh excuse me colossians 1 17 man the light's so much better in here sometimes i had to strain at my house to read the bible and he is before all things and by him all things consist now that's jesus of course he jesus is before all things of course we know as we went into revelation 3 14 that talked about being the beginning of the creation of god he is before all things and by him all things consist or that is stand everything stands today it is what it is because of him he is the head jesus is the head of the body that we just talked about the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence now again we talked about that all things having preeminence jesus having the preeminence in all things so it's not just human life or his bride he has preeminence or look to have preeminence in but body life animal life god has the preeminence but we're focused on him having the preeminence in his people god having the preeminence in his pride god having his preeminence in your life that is first place amen we talked about the word pre and what that means first first place eminence amen superiority uh just like someone would call the pope your imminence or something to that effect uh sorry there's no imminency there there's only imminency to the lord jesus it's not to a man it's to the lord jesus so when he talks about preeminence that is first in superiority in your life amen he has superiority in your life or he should if he doesn't then uh i pray you give you give it to him today so many people want to uh say that they live their lives on their own and there's ministers out there there's people in the world today there's nominal christians there's people that are high high influence and high fluency people that say you know you're your own god and we do our own thing and we live because you know we are jesus christ we are bought with a price friend if you are a christian today you're bought with a price you do not belong to yourself you belong to him and just like any item that you own you have the dictation of what you do with that item right you allow that and but as as we belong to god god wants to move us and god wants to shape us and he wants to mold us and he wants to cause us to go by the leading of his spirit we have to be willing to do that because we have a soul which is worth 10 million worlds but gives self uh self will and we have self will and we can deny that you know some people say well if god wants to save me he'll come and make me be saved no it doesn't work that way god you have to be willing you have to give yourself to the lord for him to have preeminence in that you have to subject yourself to his will whatever it is sometimes it's not easy sometimes it's very challenging sometimes it's very difficult what the lord wants from us sometimes it grates against the flesh sometimes he'll take uh and make things happen just to bring around a certain result sometimes he takes certain people home for a reason to bring about a a result that he wants but in all things we give him the preeminence it's not my life it's his life i give my life died and give my life to him many years ago now are there times that my flesh rises up and does things probably shouldn't do or contrary to what he would have shown me to do of course is there sometimes the lord unctions me in some way and i i just don't quite listen to that voice as well as i should have and i do something else and get in trouble for doing it or see how this path would have worked if i had just said you know the lord showed me to do that i decided to do this i felt the lord pulling me to go a certain way but but i did this anyway and you get in trouble for it god wants the preeminence in everything in all of our lives so even though it talks about the preeminence he will have the preeminence in all things we're talking about him having the preeminence in us in our lives allowing him letting him wanting him to have the preeminence in our lives if you knew that i knew exactly everything for the rest of your life that was going to be perfect for you would you trust me if you knew i knew that would you listen to me would you do what i tell you you probably would if you knew for a fact that i knew everything of your life and exactly what was going to be best for you in your life you'd listen to me if you really believed it now if you don't believe it that's a different story you're not going to listen if you don't believe it but if you truly believed me you would listen well that's the exact same thing that we trusted the lord god knows everything from he knows the end from the beginning he knows everything in between he knows everything about you everything about your life and everything that's going to work perfectly for your good so why don't we listen to him trust him believe him give it to him so that he has the preeminence in us his preeminence is only going to lead us to do what's right according to his word it's only going to lead us to do what's right according to his perfect will it's only going to lead us in a place that's going to be for our betterment sometimes it's hard to understand that it's going to be that way i mean when our when our son died 36.5 hours after he was born it was hard to believe that that was going to lead to something good right but god has it all under control and i promise you more ways than one that is led to be for our good i can't sit here and tell you all about or explain it to you but i have that much confidence in the lord i have that much trust in my life to know that he's the one in charge of it and he's taking control of it and he's the one that i look to and listen to in the preeminence of all things for it please the father then in him should all fullness dwell now we talked about the head of the body we went to the head we've gone to the body we built that body on the foundation now i want to try to finish this uh body foundation off with the the realization who we are and and the part that we play in this because look friend if god's and i'm going to read something to you a little later uh if god's doing something today if god has a plan that he's working out if god has a a finalization of what he's finishing up here with with with the world and with time and with everything that's going on then there's going to be somebody that god's going to work through to accomplish what he's trying to do he's going to have a person he's going to have a people who are willing to submit to him enough to do the plan that god has that he's finishing and we're still here with this world's time of what's going on with the world today and in our lives there's a plan that god is working to finish to reach to a place that the bride goes and raps your tribulation sets in and of course you know the rest there's a plan that's to be finished well who's going to be the ones to do that who's going to be the ones that god is going to work through to finish that full expression that jesus christ is manifesting himself on earth today who's going to be willing to be one of those ones well the bride's going to am i going to be one of them are you going to be one of them i believe i am i trust i do go i do what i can now again if it's something that i've already i've already gone through and laid this foundation in previous services so it may seem like i'm jumping in the middle here but i'm really not based on what we've already brought forth so if if it seems a little difficult or misunderstood or something then you can go look at the other services or ask me or whatever you'd like to do so it like i said it may seem like we're kind of jumping in the middle of this but we're really not we're just trying to finish this complete this at the end of this so first corinthians 12 13. now for by one spirit because we we did first corinthians 12 the other day in this body and who we are as a body and we're not just the body of in between our four walls we're not just a body that's just in our church or assembly it's not just a body in tucson or arizona it's not just a body of united states this body is inclusive of every people tongue kindred and nation all around the world we are involved as one body together this body we're we're fitly joined together the bible says brother brahm talked about the pyramids being put together and each stone remember we talked last week about the lively stones that we are lively stone royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices those stones brother brown talked about putting on those pyramids you couldn't run a razor blade those stones were so finely hewn together those stones were so finely put together you couldn't run a razor blade between them and that's the way the body of the bride of the believers should be today around the world internationally no matter where they are we're all a part of that same to this body by going to a seminary you don't get into this body by putting your name on the role of a of a church you get into this body by one holy spirit baptism by one holy spirit word baptism we get into this body because he tells us by one spirit we are all baptized in that one body now that we're baptized as we found out yesterday that we're baptized means immersed when you're completely immersed that's the whole point this spirit immerses you baptizes you when that spirit comes and and immerses you in his spirit just like the day of pentecost when the bible says it came on them and went in them there's a new birth that takes place that one spirit that baptizes us into this body that makes us a mini-member body now now we as a many member body we all as one belong to the lord we all belong to jesus we're all one in him so if we're in that same spirit one spirit not many spirits it's not an it's not a baptist spirit it's not a presbyterian spirit it's not a charismatic spirit it's not a calvary spirit it's not a word of god tabernacle spirit it is one spirit the holy spirit god almighty come in spirit form that one spirit has baptized us all into that one body if you're one of them we're all baptized into that same body so we're all part of the same body see it doesn't matter what you look like it doesn't matter what you sound like no matter how old you are doesn't matter you're male female we're all baptized born into that same body that new birth that puts us into that body jesus nicodemus came to jesus at night and he was talking and said rabbi we know that you're a man sent from god and i mean you can imagine as you as i paraphrased a little probably jesus is probably thinking well if you knew who i am and you know i'm sin for god then why aren't you doing what i told you but he had to come by night because he'd have been ridiculed if he had gone by the ones that had probably kicked him out of their uh organization or something if they had known nicodemus was coming to consult with jesus almighty you can't do that so it had to come by night it had to make it the secret of things the nicodemus came but jesus just basically told him unless you be born again you can't even see the kingdom of heaven unless you're born again well there has to be a holy spirit birth that bursts you into that body jesus told nicodemus you must be born again it's not a it's not a maybe it it it's not a well if you'd like to you must be born again you must be born into this body we are one spirit in one body and the capstone jesus christ the all-seeing eye is is the head of this body we just read the preeminence the head of this body you cut my head off i'm done you cut jesus out of your life you're done that's just the bottom line of it he is the head right he is the head everything about it by one spirit now so we're all by that spirit by this one body baptized immersed we are immersed into that waters of separation we talked about last week that waters of separation people want to separate today people want to draw separation from him but what's drawing separation true separation is the belief from the unbelief amen amen forget about the race the creeds the colors the the the the religion all it's belief and unbelief that's separating today and god's doing that separation that separation is by the word and that waters of separation has come to draw the variance between you and others that just don't believe they may say they believe but if they believe they're going to obey the word if they're not in obedience to the words just like the 13 people we baptized yesterday brother roger baptized and be an angel helped there and my back had been bothering me so i appreciate brother roger coming and uh baptized we baptized 13 people we buried him in the name of the lord jesus christ because that's the only name whereby man can be saved is the name of the lord jesus christ any of the baptisms is not baptism you go on the bible and you look in people that actually weren't baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ what the disciples do the disciples told them so you got to come get baptized again they had to get re-baptized they got re-baptized the name of the lord jesus christ hands laid on them they received the holy ghost praise the lord see that's not a complicated formula but it's something that separates it's that waters of separation we talked about last week that draw separation between belief and unbelief god has called you god has brought the bride to a place to where she is a called out group of people that's why you look different that's why you act different that's why you sound different that's why you don't tell the dirty jokes again you don't listen to them even in certain places you don't go anymore things you don't do because you are a separate called out chosen generation royal priesthood because by one spirit his spirit we've been baptized into that body we belong to him now we don't belong to ourselves you saw him i said well i was sure like the uh the old mute would have liked to have done that or the old mute would have done this or something let's see he's dead though see the old mutant can't do anything because he's dead he no longer exists when you're baptized when you're or when you're buried in the name of the lord and god fills you with his spirits you become a new creation that we're joined together into that one body by that baptism immersed into that uh into that waters of separation what does that do though it brings us by to the point of of the word of god uh in saint john let's go to saint john chapter 1. i'm trying to bring us to this point saint john chapter 1. i want to begin reading with with verse 12. we'll just begin with verse 11. saint john chapter 1 verse 11 and remember thinking on what we just read in first corinthians by one spirit we're baptized into that body we're all a part of that same mystical body of jesus christ remembering and thinking what god has had told nicodemus that you must be born again what god has done for us to bring us to the point that we can have the ability the desire to even do it right for uh saint john chapter 1 verse 11. let's look here now he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power or authority to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh it doesn't come by man didn't come by a woman doesn't come by procreation of man and woman didn't come by blood or the will of flesh the will of man but of god we're here because of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and he was the and he was and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now what did he do in this that jesus did for us what was the purpose what did he do in being able to come forth with a new birth baptism nicodemus didn't understand it he said how could i go into enter into my mother's womb the second time had nothing to do with his mother's womb had everything to do with the wound the mind of god where he was from before the foundation of the world that's what it had to do with not his mother's womb but the womb of god the mind of god that's where he was to begin with well if you were a part of god maybe nicodemus wasn't but if you're a part of god that's where you were that's where that birth is that's what jesus talked about here now as as you have received him has been he's received him not just believed amen now people we talk about faith and believing that's all true absolutely but don't you know that the devil believes the devil believes too well sure he does he's been whooped enough by god he he knows very well he knows who god is he knows who jesus was he believes but the bible says to them that receive him now see that's something he didn't do to receive the word is to receive christ not to receive dogma not to receive denomination or some man's thought but idea but to receive the word to receive the word is to receive christ and to receive christ god give you the power amen god give you the power the authority to become a son of god amen my friend have you ever thought about how powerful that is that we as ranked sinners humans come into this world speaking lies sinners had no hope headed to hell that god would give us the power the authority to become a son of god amen no wonder we ought to offer him all of the preeminence in our lives he gave us the power to become sons of god see when you come forth in a natural birth there was no power there was no control and there was no discussion from you about it did your parents discuss with you before you were born whether they would want you to be born or not or whether you would want to be born i know we didn't discuss it with our children kind of been tough what to discuss with your children before they were born whether they would want to be born i know that sounds kind of ludicrous but you know there's a guy in india who sued his parents for being born i never asked to be born i never wanted to be born and he sued his parents because he was born they never asked me how crazy ludicrous the world has gotten to be but the fact of the matter is it's it it's it's not about that amen god give us the power to become sons and daughters of god now it's our choice it's our decision we have to make that decision am i going to be a son or daughter of god do i want god jesus christ to have full preeminence and control of my life do i trust and believe him enough to know that he knows everything about my life and now and in the future for me to put my life in his hands is he gonna ask me to do something that i don't want to do he might that's true in fact there's a very good possibility that god will ask you to do something you don't want to do i know he has me many many times but when you do it when you obey that voice and when you do it god tells you oh it's it there's nothing in the world like it you see the hand of god moving left and right what god's bringing together and and the purpose and the will of god and how it manifests itself i'll tell you friend that's exactly how we're here this morning in this building that's right it's exactly by that way that was god doing that god did this out of nowhere god did it me and brother rogers looking all over the place searching the internet daily looking everywhere asking people we know driving by places and all we had to do is have one person see his craigslist ad and call for some electrical work who happened to be a brother and sister that was at the tabernacle that i knew you might know them too to call him up for us to do some electrical work to find out he had the building sounds pretty simple doesn't it amen that doesn't mean you just sit down and do nothing of course and you know but when god brings it about and when god does it it works perfect it works out exactly the way he wants it to be he puts it in exactly place the exact place he wants it to be and it works together for our god that's how god does it god give us the power see when you're born naturally you had no power you had no consultation you had uh you had no choice you were just born but now with this new birth with this spiritual birth you have choice and you have power you have authority to become sons of god because god gave us that spiritual birth to become a new creation to to be born into the body of god you have a choice you have the power because god's given to us to be able to become sons of god we're not born of blood we're not born in the will of flesh or the will of man but that birth is of god the other was all man all that was just about man but this was god this is by the will of god that's your birth into the kingdom of god so how we don't give him the preeminence in our lives see because that last birth is a word verse that last verse are you with me that last birth is a word birth it's not a human birth it's not a fleshly bird we're still here we're still in this shell you know i still go by the name newton even though i'm not newton's actually dead i still go by that name well sometimes sometimes people call me george but anyway i uh because that's my other name but i i go by the same name i look a lot like i did when i was younger but the man inside the person who you really are changes you're a different person it's a word birth it's a word birth in the in in the point that you are born of we were born before of corruptible seed but this spiritual birth was of incorruptible seed uh first peter chapter three uh if you want to turn there real quick it's up to you if you'd like to i'm gonna look it's uh chapter one excuse me first peter chapter one uh just one verse here 23rd verse first peter 1 23 being born again has to do over again it says being born again but for us and it's not really born again it really is the understanding that it has to come into human understanding to come into human understanding you say well you have to be born well i am born so to put it in human understanding you say born again i'm not born again or born over again i'm just born a new i'm a new creature in christ being born again not of corruptible seed which was our first birth but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so this is a word birth we are born of incorruptible seed by the word of god so the so the product that comes forth even though it may look the same and the hair and everything although there's more gray and more wrinkles and whatever else is still the shell is still the same but you understand it's not that that that's the focus that god's looking at yes sure all that's the same but this is a word birth what has changed is that you are no longer the person you used to be as far as living by your own dictates and will and purpose this new birth word birth means that this incorruptible seed which is the word this incorruptible seed now has taken the residence in your soul and you now belong to christ not yourself but you belong to christ now this incorruptible seed is the seed of god the word of god the word birth that we now birth our that that we are birthed into by the word of god we're no longer ourself we're birthed in the word so if we came from an incorruptible seed there's only one incorruptible seed that's god's seed god sees the only one it's incorruptible so if we're born of god by the seed of god which first john 3 tells us by the seed of god the seed remains in you then what does that bring you into life of being if you have been born again of the incorruptable seed by the word of god a word birth what does that make you you are born again from the seed of god a new from the seed of god if you're born from my seed then you're born from the seed of newton that's corruptible if you're born of the seed of god that's god's seed that's incorruptible god's incorruptable seed makes you what you are paul said in romans which came from david is blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin i know i've said that quite a bit but i just i really like that scripture blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin well who is that man that man is the man who's born that purpose man humanity not just a male that is born of an incorruptible seed that is born a word birth which has no corruption from god himself see amen if we can't see that's who we are friend look that that's what god has made us that's where god has brought us to speaking of first john 3 let me read this first john 3 verse 1. behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us now think about this this is emanating from his love this is coming forth from the love of god so when things happen you don't understand it's coming from the love of god it's not coming because god hates you it's because god loves you and he knows what's best for us the old what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god now he gave us the power to become sons of god now blessed is he to whom god uh that that we should be called the sons of god therefore the word the world knoweth us not because it do him not beloved now are we the sons of god it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that we he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is well how is he we've seen him and how is he they said it's john here says it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when we will see him when he shall appear we will be like him well what is he we know the appearance has come we know that god that revelation 10 7 has been fulfilled and and the mystery of god has been finished if the mystery of god the understanding of that foundation jesus christ who he is the revelation of christ and who he is then who is he when we look at christ what do we see do we just see a man a lot of churches just see the second person of a trinity that's all they see some people look at him and they just see why he was a good man some people that are out the corrupt world look and see they consider him a deceiver what do you see when you see jesus what is he it says when he appears or manifests himself we shall be like him what is he he is the word christ is the word and if we are to be like him then what is that place the bride asks that makes her the word right she's a word bride because she's born of incorruptible seed she's born a word birth so of course if she come out of christ like the quote i read last week if she come out of christ then what is and he's the word and we're a part of him and we are to be like him what does that make us that makes the bride the word because she's had that incorruptible birth of the incorruptible seed and we have seen him we know him we better our relationship better we better have a relationship with jesus christ amen we better have one yeah we've seen him we know who he is we know him as the word amen we know him as the word if we come from him then what does that make us praise the lord he is the word we are like him that's not that that's not a doing that we did of our own accord right that's what god has done for us that's the purpose god has called us to how are how is this bride going to ever be the full expression of jesus christ on earth today unless she is like him how is she ever going to complete the work that god has put in your life if we are not obedient and he has the preeminence in our lives how is it ever going to get done how is it ever going to get finished it can't but promise you whether it's you me or all of us god's going to have somebody that he has the full preeminence in and will work through amen there's going to be a people that's going to finish this work amen i i i pray we have a little more time that the lord give us to do that uh if not then then we're ready to go home uh i think uh the next less than 60 days will probably dictate a lot of that but anyway that's i'm not getting into politics would probably dictate a lot of that but i hope we have a little more time maybe we do we'll see but we take opportunity of every bit of time that we have because he has the preeminence in us if it's not us who's it going to be if it's not let's just say us i don't mean us here i mean the bride who's it going to be she come from him she's a incorruptable seed she is a word body bride then who then who's going to do it the full expression oh we're getting to it let me get a couple other scriptures in here um we'll try to wind this up philippians chapter 2 philippians chapter 2 we'll begin with verse 1. philippians 2 1 i read this a couple of services to go and i told you we'd come back to this because i want to hit one specific point maybe two we'll just see but one specific point in here philippians 2 1 if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind one court one mind one body let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let us each esteem other better than themselves in humility right we put others before ourselves in humility take the lower seat look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus what is that mind the mind that was to be in you that was also in christ jesus is what led christ to do the things and live the life that he lived if you have the mind of christ it caused you to do and live and act like he did you already see the little bracelets and stuff people had for a long time wwjd what would jesus do you know i mean you don't have to wear one of those to show you're a christian your life should show that but it's kind of profound people say well what would jesus do in that situation well how would you know what jesus would do in any given situation if you don't know what the bible says if you only know what some minister or some church or something's telling you how do you know what the bible says unless you know it for yourself how do you know what jesus would do unless you know who jesus is right unless you have a personal revelation relationship with him yourself how would you know what he would do there's some situations come up in my life in my wife's life i don't even know what she would do sometimes i've lived with her for 35 years there's some things come up i don't even know what she would do but how do we know what jesus would do because of what he's already done because of who he is if we're like-minded to christ then that means that we're going to be able to yes even in our bodies even in our flesh try to work on our best to fulfill the manifestation the purpose that god has us here for the work that god is finishing god is completing this we have that part to play in bringing this to a finish they're bringing this to a close i hear people all the time talk about rapture rapture rapture and i preach on it many times and we're as a body of believers as a bride i i i could not express to you with human tongue how much happiness and joy it would give me you see my mom my dad my sister my brother my son sitting right there right now that i can actually visibly see them right but we still have work to do there's still a purpose god has us here for if god has us here for that he's given see what i'm trying to read to you and get to you is the point that god has given us the ability and the power to be able to do it so many times i see people get weak in their faith and they get weak in their that their their faith of who they are in christ and who god has made them and then you know friend once you once you lose that sight of what god has done for you and who you are in him the devil could just plow right over you because you don't know who you are you don't know where you're standing you don't know what god has done for you and where you're placed in that body and who we are in him and devil just run right slap over people because they just don't know they just they they just get so beat down with their faith but i'm trying to help us see here now what god has called us to and who we are in him this point this purpose god would not have done it if he didn't know that we could do it that we can fulfill it and again i keep saying the word we and it you know i don't want to get to the understanding that i mean just we i mean this body internationally around the world god wouldn't put us in this position if he didn't know we could do it but there had to be things that god had to set in place even in the old testament through the new testament what god did and jesus did at calvary where we are today the prophet the message what it's brought us to friend the revealing and the understanding of who jesus christ really is today who he's always been it can help us it is what we need to bring us to the point of that understanding so when paul says to the philippians let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus it's not just a statement it's not just a a a platitude or or advice it's something he's trying to get a people to that that we're all trying to strive to get to that that mind is going to lead you into doing the things here on this earth as a representative of christ that he would do if he was here in bodily form himself but he's doing it through you when jesus when god went to abraham when god went to abraham and he talked to abraham he told according to the scripture of genesis 18 i believe it is he said i will now go and see if sodom is all together as wicked as has been said well the one that stood there that abraham called lord elohim did he go to sodom he stayed right there with abraham who went the two angels that was with him well with the two ages with him does that mean god lied he was gonna go but he didn't go of course not he went he went in his representatives brother man him michael and gabriel whatever you want to say you know blow dust out and have them step they went well when they went it was as good as god had went has anything changed god does the same thing today as he did dinner he would be god when god says i will or i have or he may be talking about you he may be talking about me when he says i will well what he means is newton's going to as his representative and god has given us the power to be able to do that let this mind be in you that mind is going to lead you and guide you into all truth let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus what else did it do who being in the form of god we talked about that form notice that word therefore means in morpha or changing of mask as you would in a play if you will one person can play two or three different parts by changing their mask they'll play and do be this part and then they'll go back and they'll change their costume or something they'll come out and play another part well that's what form means that's what morpha is people want to make him the second person of a trinity no god changing his mask in the form of god and morpha thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation now look what it'll do for you amen he said what are you talking about jesus well who came from him who has the mind of god if you have the mind of christ oh i'm talking to us it's real friend we have the mind of christ we have the mind of christ like the word says here and he says he thought about robert to be equal with god who made himself of no reputation so what will the bride do she'll be like-minded she'll make herself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant so what would the bride do she will put on the cloak of servant amen not serving as jews but servant as fulfilling the purpose and will of god and was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the cross but if he was in the form of god now don't don't want to lose you and then but i want us to understand something if being in the form of god as jesus the bible says jesus was in the form of god he morphing himself thought it not robbery to be equal with god what does that mean robbery simply means that somebody took something from you if somebody took something from you that means they're taking or robbing or stealing away from you well what he's saying is here that he thought it not robbery it didn't take anything from god for who jesus christ was filled in flesh if you are in the form of god if you are in the like-mindeness of god if you are born of the incorruptible seed of god if you are a word birth spiritual birth into this body is that robbing from god that's exactly what god's calling this bride to be today not robbery it's not taking from god actually if we're here we're doing the purpose and that god has called us to that's adding to god that's exactly what god wants us to be that's exactly what god called us to be it's not robbing from god it's adding to god if you say adding to this probably probably not a correct word to put because you can't add to god he's perfect but you know what i'm saying i don't mean actually literally adding something to god but it's enhancing who he is by fulfilling the purpose that god's put us here for it's not robbery knowing who you are in jesus christ this word is not taking from god you're not taking anything from him it's it's it's an enhancement look in second corinth and uh uh excuse me colossians chapter two colossians chapter two i'm just going to read it's getting a little late in time but so let me finish this colossians chapter 2 verse 9 and 10. for in him jesus dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily in jesus dwelt all the fullness not partly not some fullness of the godhead bodily and ye you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power you are completed him all the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in jesus and you are complete in him you know in the greek the word fullness and the word complete are the same so when the bible says that in christ all the fullness of the godhead bodily was dwelled and you are complete or full in him you know what means the exact same thing according to the greek exact same word why put it in two different ways i'm not sure fullness and complete full fullness means of filling up complete means you're full if all the fullness completeness was in christ and you are complete in him oh i hope that helps us understand to be full let's look at this to be full causes one to abound and to fill to the brim to complete plea to complete to be full is to fill to the brim anybody knows the brand's the top of the glass you put any more in that it just floods over full to the brim and cause to abound amen you are complete in him it's just i it is beautiful to me god has completed me in a in in causing your life in the completeness of christ to abound in him not just exist right not just get along but abound does that mean you're going to be a millionaire no not necessarily mean you're going to have houses and cars and lands and be rich and wealthy and whatever no no no that's not always that's what that means you know you are you never ever going to get sick in your body no that's not what that means it's not what he's saying but you're going to abound in everything you do for christ because he he has made us complete complete in him and the completeness okay the completeness is the fullness of the godhead bodily what is god at the godhead is the state of being god that's what the godhead is you go look it up the godhead the word godhead is is is the state of of god of being god bodily just means in a bodily form or in a corporal body so in hebrews fullness of the godhead in his corporal being the fullness of god in his bodily form was in existence because jesus was here and people want to make him a second person or a third person or some kind of some of a lower state well the father's up here and and and the son and the holy spirit are down here oh friend come on now there's there's a revelation this church is built upon and i promise you it's not that amen the fullness of the godhead bodily the fullness of the state of being god in bodily form was standing there in the body of jesus christ where one day all that wholeness was fullness was poured into one man one body when jesus left and came back and poured out the first pouring of the day of pentecost on those 120. now millions i don't know billions maybe since then i don't know have been had been poured upon that that paul is talking to the corinthian church by one spiritual baptized into this body since that time that spirit has come into in a many member bodies in the fullness of the god-head bottle you say well all of god was in christ yes that's the truth you know brother brown talked about the spoonful you know everything that's in this everything that's in the bodies in the spoonful i'm just trying to help see we are completing him we are the complete representation of the state of being god in a bodily form god help us i we we can't do it on our own god help us god bring faith to understand that the only way that i'm able to do this is by the lord's preeminence in my life the only way to become or be or show forth the full expression of jesus this last day is for him to have preeminence in our lives amen the full expression i love that full expression let me read these couple other scriptures i'm going to close here ephesians chapter one i want to bring ephesians chapter one and romans 8 together here and then we'll close ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 in whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom and also after that ye believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise sealed with the holy spirit after you believed of promise which is the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and what is that redemption well first of all what is the purchased possession i am i was bought with a price paul said he was bought with a price we are bought with a price if you're part of this body you're bought with a price on what's the purchase possession we are what's the full redemption of that purchased possession well the full complete redemption of it is going to be when god changes these vile bodies and we go into rapture the redemption of our soul has already taken place so that we could manifest jesus christ on earth so that we could become that full expression and get to the place where if we don't go out by the way of the grave there's a body change and a rapture if we do go by the way of the grave they resurrect first hence my families that's the front row right there amen you said well brother you that's far-faced is it that's what the bible said amen that first resurrection they all resurrected and appeared unto many 30-40 days they appeared unto many what would

travaileth and pained together until now and not only they but also but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit we even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption or that is to say to wit the redemption of what our bodies the purchased possession god has purchased us we belong to him now if we've been purchased we belong to god and if we belong to god then god
