honor to go before your presence yes today is as a group of believers of life precious faith yes jesus believes your word and that without you father as our brother said it already it's impossible to please you if we don't have that faith oh god and i remember one time one of the apostles might have been paul he says certain ones the preaching of the gospel did not profit them anything because it wasn't mixed with faith oh god help us lord to recognize the day and the hour that we're living in yes lord i can't remember your prophet said that it's not the big things we do for god it's the little things we leave undone and help us lord in our walk with you i believe that's very important yeah that's not going to be a second chance or a do-over lord let our lives count for you right now let us be more sincere and dedicated let us have a prayer life that is worthy of the gospel let us be loving and kind one to another yes let your word become life in us father because lord there are needs of your people this morning and lord i also remember as i heard your prophets say that we know god cannot lie yes amen we come before you and and taking you at your word whatever we should ask believing we shall receive and brother brown said take god his word believe it and you shall hear it lord i remember that there was a time even in my life i i just didn't have the strength but then you revealed to me it's not my fight it's yours yes my battle is yours i can do all things through christ who strengthens me and are there some that need a touch a healing touch from you for thou art our great physician our high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your strides we are healed we claim it we believe it it's a finished work you have accomplished in full at calvary father we believe in the lord grant the desires of the hearts of your people help us lord and know that we're lacking our good points lord it shows we're growing but our failures that's what we need to know as the preaching of your word comes forth today help us lord to make things right right now yes jesus thing's over with my brother and he says my things are going crazy just shooting after shooting killing after killing and just to think it's not even the great tribulation lord wake us up lord let us make things right with you yes let us have the faith to walk as

because so many times we we develop our the people churches develop into a place to where everything is the pastor the pastor the pastor the pastor and that's not the way it's supposed to be we are a body of believers it's not all on the pastor it's not all up to the pastor god talks to all of you god moves in all of you god moves through all of you god speaks to all of you and for what happened and god's speaking to brother pat and sister teresa and what happened sunday um i was just i was beaming with pride and happiness uh last week with what took place so i appreciate that very much appreciate y'all follow the leading of the lord yes god is good amen amen praise the lord jesus so just we always remember that it seems to get to be to where we inherently become a nicolaitan system by the pastor doing and being everything and it's not supposed to be that way amen it's not supposed to be that way we are all part of god's family god speaks and uses all of us amen like he's getting ready for his sister norma right now it's the holy spirit amen it is brother and all of us praise the lord you don't like that it's easier to hear you that much god bless you all um praise the lord

all stand to our feet now amen we'll go to the word of god thank you jesus let's turn over in the scripture now to romans chapter 1. romans chapter 1 just thinking on something for today and distrusting the mind of the lord to bring something that would be his will and be a blessing and a help amen today and through our father's day we celebrate in this country today the father's day amen something very simple just came to my heart we'll just bring to you this morning in romans chapter one we'll begin reading with verse 16 and 17 amen but let's bow our heads lord jesus lord we are very thankful lord god you've been so good to us god if you never did another thing for us the rest of our lives you've done more for us than we ever deserved and we thank you so much lord but we know god that you're going to continue to honor your word and you're going to continue to bless your people and you're going to continue to watch over us and never leave us or forsake us and keep us and strengthen and bless us lord you're going to continue the benefits you've shown us through your word god flowing to your people continually every day lord we thank you god for this moment we thank you for this place this time that we come fellowship out from the world lord expecting you to meet with us hear god and to speak to us from your word yes lord have you sung the songs of zion we've worshipped and exalted you lord feeling your presence so strong and real right now god we just want to lift you in prayer and praise all that we have that with us that is within us lord we thank you for these people lord and preach when they've come those who may be streaming today lord may your holy spirit move in a special supernatural way right now god to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think or trusting and believing you to draw us nearer to you lord for faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god lord through that word god that we hear that you speak to us god may have been greater faith increased faith in our lives that we draw closer to you lord and become more like you in this last days that we live yes we thank you lord for this uh for the blessings of your word lord and for the spirit that we have felt we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way god but feeling your pure presence lord god in this place and giving you glory and honor for it now we pray lord as we broke open this uh this word lord that you give us this bible is holy writ father may you just speak to us through it now father and anoint the speaker the hear and each one of us lord to accomplish what you have to be done today we committed to you and asked your blessings upon the remaining part of it now may it all be pleasing to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen romans chapter 1 3 verses 16 and 17 amen paul says here now for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written to just shall live by faith you can be seated if you like i'd like to take my text from the 17th verse here today that last part of the 17th verse for the just shall live by faith i know it's something that that was martin luther's message but you know i think a lot of times some of the worst mistakes that we make especially in this message is that we say we're beyond so and so we're beyond luther we're beyond wesley and i understand that there's a word that god has brought to us in this last day through a message i understand that but it's like um uh when when you grow up and get older you become more responsible you become stronger you become smarter you become a more viable to do things in the world well when you do that you don't forget the things that you learned as a child you don't let go of those things and forget those things you just bring those things with you because those things are the things that makes you stronger when you get older and a lot of times i think we have the mistaken uh uh that we do when we when we kind of think well we've gotten past that yes but you can't forget about that amen you can't let that go because that is as important a part of our lives as a christian today as what we know now amen without justification where would we be today but my point today i really want to speak on a major on faith faith had become the thing that was a theme of my heart that i wanted to speak on today and yesterday the lord gave me the scripture of the just shall live by faith because when you take that into an overall understanding of our christian walk and our christian life it becomes paramount to us to recognize faith isn't it is not just an event of life faith is a life lived amen uh this that we live this this just shall live by faith it's a life that we live it's a livelihood it's a way of life it's not just an event it's just not something that we expect to implore on when somebody's sick or needy we don't just try to grab faith when it's convenient for us our life should be lived in faith everything about our lives is faith the fact that we take our next breath is faith the next time our heartbeat is faith the everything that we do in life we we do it by faith amen it's all in faith it's a life of faith but now the just are the ones who live by faith amen the just the just are the ones that are justified have been justified by the blood of jesus christ what is justified means well brother random put in very simple terms when he basically said that being justified means you never did it in the first place not that you were forgiven but that you did not do it it's like when we talked about last week back from deuteronomy when he said when god told moses there was to be no leaven for seven days in the household amen no eleven seven days in the household that meant no eleven not that you were forgiven of the leaven that came in no not the forgiveness but that there was no leaven you understand justified means it never happened you never did it amen now there there comes a caveat to that because we understand that the physical aspects of what we've done in life still remain amen i've told this story before that uh this analogy that a a person would try to uh go to a woman's house with just say a woman's house whose man's whose husband's life was destroyed because this man was a drug dealer and this man came to a sense and he was no longer a drug dealer so he comes to this woman's house and knocks on the door and says uh mama uh i i just want you to know uh your your husband's wife your husband's life's destroyed he's dead you killed her your children your home was all destroyed because i dealt your husband drugs but i never did it i just want you to know i never dealt your husband drugs you know what you're going to walk away with a bloody nose black eye or maybe worse because you did do it amen in this world in this life physically i've known people to go before judges that would say but you know judge my plea is that i never did it well i've got six witnesses over here that watched you do it i but i didn't do it yes you did do it but see the point of it is in the spiritual aspect in god's eyes you never did it so we can't go to seed with that and then and say well i never did do that well then you actually did do it but in god's eyes you never did it so the point of this being is that you're justified because god does not hold that to your account god doesn't hold it against you because in his eyes when he's been justified and annihilated by the blood of christ it never happened no leaven praise the lord didn't happen so in god's eyes it never happened so now although we may have done these things and we may have made these mistakes in god's eyes it never happened and i'd rather it have never happened in his eyes than in the world anyway amen i mean there's a lot of things i've done in life that i wish back and could wish i could go back and undo and change and wish i had not done that or said that or whatever but once it's done it's done it it's like i uh it's like you talk about when when you're verbalizing things and when you're saying words people aren't guarded with their words so much anymore but people try to take their words back the best you can do by taking your words back is apologize amen i go to somebody who i made said something i shouldn't have said and said well i never said that yes you did amen it's like the it's like the man trying to went to the priest and said how can i make all these things that i did wrong right how can i fix all these things that i said how can i take back all those things he said well i'll tell you he said take a uh take a basket of feathers and lay a feather on every door of the person that you think that you said wrong or did wrong go take the basket of feathers and lay a feather on every door amen monsoon season so now he came back to the priest and he said now i want you to go back and collect every one of those feathers from all those doors he said those pheasants feathers are gone by now they're blown away they're gone away people's picked them up they're not going to be there anymore he said neither can you take back those things that you said amen it's easier to go collect those feathers back than it is to put those words back in your mouth once they're out they're out once they're out you've said it it has its effect but in god's eyes and that's the most important place now in god's eyes you never did it in the first place being justified justified means you're guiltless guiltless praise the lord you can be brought before a tribunal of satan and all of his minions and you will be found guiltless because in god's eyes she never did it amen he's the supreme judge anyway in god's eyes she never did it you're guiltless amen so the just so now those that are guiltless those that have been justified those who live in a perpetual state of justification never did to begin with no leaven there's no leaven that sin leaves goes is annihilated by the blood of christ goes back on the head of satan and that mistake will lay on his head till the day of judgment so satan on the damn judgment will have to give an account for the things that happened in your life amen that he tricked you into doing this amen thou be accounted to him not you you never did it justified guiltless virtuous that's another one virtuous justified means to be virtuous undefiled even undefiled by sin undefiled by 11 justified virtuous living the just now those are the people who live by faith so we understand not everybody lives by faith only the just live by faith only those that have been justified by the blood of christ to the annihilation of sin only those are the ones who live by faith in a perpetual existence of faith my whole life is about faith i believe that faith and i stand upon that faith and that faith operates in my life every single moment of my life now there's the faith of the scene and there's a faith of the unseen a lot of people everybody has faith we know that the bible says each man is dealt be measure of faith we know everybody's got faith even atheists can get healed from colds if an atheist get healed from a cold how did he get healed well he didn't get healed from the devil he got healed by god well what healed him he didn't pray to god and ask for healing so how did he get healed he had faith to believe yes not believing god he may have believed in his doctrine he may have faith in his medicine whatever that whatever it took to bring that man or that person's faith up to a level of receiving healing and that healing then comes because of that faith god has no respect for a person friend and we sometimes forget that but god has no respect for a person regardless of whether that person is justified a child of god or not god is no respecter person and that faith stands just like it does with anybody else but now the just live by faith their life is an example of the of the faith in jesus christ our lord amen amen that faith is that conviction that we have it's a conviction of course hebrews 11 explains all about that faith the things that are unseen the things that we can't see but yet we believe it we have faith in it faith seems to be one of those things that that is far-reaching for some people it seems to be something that people sometimes just can't get a grasp on can't understand but you know it's it's easier uh let me try to put it this way it is easier to have faith in the things that are unseen than it is to have faith in things that you can see but are contrary to your faith you understand it's easier to have faith in things that you cannot see or touch or hear or feel it's easier to have faith in the unseen than it is to have faith in things that you can see tangible but that are contrary to your faith right you understand because many times we ask god for things let's just take a sickness for example you just have a simple sickness it's easier to believe for something that doesn't exist than to believe that you're well when you're standing there with the symptoms of a sickness it is it's easier to believe in something that you can't see it's it's a we have prayer all the time and believe for things that that we're just trusting the lord in but when it's you how many times have we said that when it's you and that sickness is in your life or that that situation is in your life to have the faith that's going to reverse what you can feel what you can hear what you can taste what you can see your faith is to reverse that that's even harder to take it uh and and and put it bring it in a different direction well that faith will do that the faith will change the circumstances faith will change whatever is happening to match what you believe what you ask god for what you spoke to be real what you have spoke to be real your faith will change that it'll reverse its course it'll take a sick person and make them well it'll take a person to eat up with cancer and have them with no cancer at all amen faith will do that but it takes that unwavering belief that the just live in now we do that understanding that we follow in what we believe to be the will of god for all of our lives sometimes things happen that might go against what our or what we believe in faith and some people come up and say well you just didn't have a faith enough but you know if i ask god for something and i believe it's his will to do something contrary to what my heart is i want to follow what he wants what god wants it may be contrary to what i want but it doesn't matter what i want it matters what he wants and what he wants becomes what i want regardless of if it's going to be good for me or whether i want it to happen or not it may be contrary but it's what god wants that's where our faith meets god our faith meets god because our will his will or our will has molded from his will because we do what he wants us to do that's where our faith comes and when you're standing in what you believe to be the perfect will of god of your life there is no greater place you can be to have faith than to know that you're standing in the center of god's perfect will when you know you're there you can have faith in what you pray and believe amen i've told you the story about my sister many times i prayed for my sister to be well over and over and over and over and over prayed for my sister to be well she had cancer and i prayed for her to be well she got sicker prayed for her to be well she got sick see it's harder to have faith to believe she's going to be well when i can look at her right and i can see how sick she is and how sicker she's getting yeah it's he's easier to have faith when i don't see her the unseen then when i'm looking at it and have faith and believe she's going to be wealth regardless of what the circumstances look like because our faith has to master circumstance you know brother random says perfect i used to had this printed he used to had on my desk at the school at tabernacle perfect faith masters every circumstance yes every circumstance and i was driving home one night you know i think i told you a story from flagstaff to show low i was on the interstate and it came on my heart and i prayed for my sister again and god stopped me and said don't pray for her anymore i said lord i want my sister to be well i don't want to lose my sister i don't want her to die from cancer lord i want my sister to be well i'm going to keep praying for her because i believe you're going to heal her god said don't pray for her anymore i said why not he said because it's time for me to take her home he said and your prayers are keeping me from doing that that's what he told me and i said okay well not my will but yours be done i didn't want to see my sister go i didn't want to lose she's only 48 i think when she passed away so young i didn't want to see her go but it but it was her time god told me it was her time and i said okay lord i said then i'll no longer and then once before i was praying in faith and i believed but after the but after i knew when god spoke to me there now he doesn't always make it that real that's that's a very exceptional circumstance at least for me anyway maybe he does you more but in my life it was a very exceptional circumstance that the lord would speak to me like that but usually i believe when i'm praying it i believe i'm not going to talk to the lord and waste his time amen that sounds crazy when he dwells in eternity but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna waste my time his there's no point if i don't believe i'm not gonna pray it i'm not going to say it you know friends when you sit down at a meal if you don't believe what you're praying when you pray over that meal don't just don't even it's time to do it right what's the point and that sounds crude and blunt but it's true you must have faith when you pray that when you bow your head before god and you ask you a petition whatever it is believe no there's not a devil in hell that's going to stop it from happening right nothing but when god spoke to me and i knew at that moment what his perfect will was in that situation i had every faith in the world to believe what god was doing and what he was going to do a month later my my sister was gone the lord took her probably about a month i think this is november that was she passed in december a month later she was gone after that but when i knew my point of the story was then when i knew that that's what the lord of the perfect will of the lord i've had people come up in churches before never hear never hear so don't feel that but never hear him but i've had people come up before me in churches when i preached and want to get prayed for and i would go before that person of the lord and i feel something come on the lord said don't pray blessings on this person and that's hard because you know brother branham said if god if god is trying to teach somebody and god has got a sickness on that person or allowed a sickness or something on that person god's trying to teach that person something and i go up and i and i command that demon that god allowed to be on there off i'll be responsible for what happens in that person's life and i've gone and god said don't don't pray blessings on that person amen you can pray over them and god's will and and all but don't pray blessings in whatever the situation healing or whatever i've had god do that to me but it doesn't happen often but i've had it happen before not here again but i have had that happen before because when you know what the center of god's perfect will is every situation it's a life lived not just an incident it's not something you reach out and try to get when you need it when you're expecting god's blessing healing or something it's a life lived faith is a life lived to those that have been justified by the blood of christ amen it's a life yes it's in every pore of our being to live by faith faith is a conviction faith is a fidelity fidelity just like justified was virtuous fidelity means that you're virtuous pure undefiled fidelity means that you stay pure to that one thing whatever it is usually we talk about fidelity in this life like a husband and wife a a man that's true to his wife is is is a fidelity to that wife he there's no he forsaken every other woman on the planet he doesn't look at another woman he doesn't desire another woman he definitely doesn't touch another woman his fidelity is to that woman he stays true to her that's what faith is it's like jesus talked about when he told them when the disciples asked that lord increase our faith god goes on and starts telling different uh stories about if you had faith the great of a mustard seed you could tell that mountain you could tell that sycamore tree you can tell this to be cast in the sea or move from here to there you can tell it what to do and it will do it that's faith if you have faith to create a mustard seed now what is a mustard seed mustard seed of course is the smallest of all seeds we know that a mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds but it is also a mustard seed cannot be mixed with anything else it has to remain virtuous a mustard seed has to be has to have fidelity it cannot be mixed and your faith cannot be mixed with anything else it has to stay pure it has to stay unfaint i don't know if you all know brother green used to go around and give out the mustard seeds i put a bunch of mustard seeds in 1917. that little dark spot in there underneath that yellow sticker that's a bunch of mustard seeds not just one that's a whole bunch of mustard seeds i never call it a canada but there's probably 20 or 30 mustard seeds just under that little sticker thing there i keep them there matthew 17 to remind me faith to grain of a mustard seed move mountains small yes but it cannot be mixed cannot muster cannot be mixed with anything else nor can our faith be mixed with anything else it has to be fidelity it has to be pure it has to be virtuous our faith has to be virtuous there can be no leaven none not a crumb there can be no doubt there can be no unbelief it has to be pure faith faith in god's word faith in the truth of what god's word is amen must be faith it's a life lived not a single incident the just live by faith now page over romans chapter 3 romans chapter 3. amen romans chapter 3 we'll start reading with the verse 21 but now the righteousness of god the righteousness of god what does that sound like sounds to me like god is righteous what is righteous righteous means someone who is in there ought to be conditioned to be righteous is to be in your rightful position your rightful place amen god is righteous correct because god is always in the proper position god is always in the proper place amen i told y'all about this job that i'm getting ready to take and the man asked me he said when we were talking about the putting the building together and all that we do to fix that and to build it and he said obviously there's things that we don't do correctly there's probably things that can be done better i said well are you god he said well of course not i said then there's always going to be a way to improve something because god's the only one that's perfect god's the only one that does it exactly the right way the first time only time every word every thought everything god ever does is perfect the first time it cannot be improved on it cannot be made better everything god does is exactly right and perfect so i got to minister to the man just a little bit but everything god does it's perfect always take your opportunities when you get them correct so but god is righteous now now the righteousness of god without the law is manifest being witnessed by the law and the prophets so the righteousness of god he's speaking up here is the giving of jesus christ jesus christ being the son of god that one that was in his rightful position so that righteousness of god came down and manifested itself before us now why amongst the many other reasons did his son come did jesus come to manifest himself here and do what he did in that position that god placed him now remember you can have no greater faith in your life than when you know that you're in the center of god's perfect will you'll have no greater faith in your life than when you know where you're standing with god that's when you have the greatest faith that's when you can stand on what you know is right now you can have faith and people do have faith other times other ways but you can have no greater faith than when you're standing why do you think brother branham could stand there like hattie wright and say you can have whatever you want you think a man would make a fool of himself in front of all those people with it being recorded and not have god speaking to him to tell that woman that he knew that through the righteousness of god that that word was going to be manifest to her because god gave it to him and him standing there in the middle of god's perfect will of course he knew it and he could speak it because he believed it faith living by faith and when he spoken and she spoke what she wanted what was her harsh desire god gave it to her right amen what better way to know to have that faith than when you're in the center of god's perfect will the righteousness of god amen jesus christ without the law jesus without the law is manifested when he manifested jesus came forth manifested remember that's to be made known to manifest something is to let it be known to show it to open it to reveal it jesus christ came manifested witnessed by the law the torah and all that were there the the pharisees sadducees and the prophets which uh even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ now the righteousness condescended and manifested himself without the law but before the law and the prophets that that righteousness which is by faith amen now i can ask you to raise your hand to how many of you here believe that you are righteous or believe that you are the very righteousness of jesus christ i could ask you that i don't know how many hands i'd get raised being we're in church i might get a lot of hands but tomorrow afternoon after a day's work or something it might be a different story you know why because we're so obsessed with our mirrors we are so unfortunately and it is in this country in this world we are so obsessed with our mirrors quit looking at what you see in the mirror and look at what you see in the mirror of god's word amen don't look at what the devil tries to convince you or talk to you about that you are what you see in the mirror believe you are what god says you are amen and god says that you are righteous because the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ well do you have faith that jesus christ was the son of god the lamb of god to come and die and shed his blood and take your sin away to justify you and to put you in his will do you believe that well if you believe that by the faith of jesus christ what does that make you that makes you righteous that puts you in your ought to be conditioned that puts you in your rightful place in the mind of god and that's and when you know that you're in your rightful place every devil of hell can come and try to convince you otherwise but you know that you're standing where you're supposed to be in god's word and will don't matter what anybody else says somebody can come by satan can incarnate somebody says oh now you shouldn't be going you shouldn't be doing you shouldn't be and you shouldn't amen but when god speaks to you it doesn't matter what they say it doesn't matter what anybody else tries to tell you doesn't matter how much the devil tries to convince you you're not the word says you are amen and that puts you in your rightful position you're in your right standing in the sonship of jesus christ and in your right position the sonship of jesus quit looking in the mirror just try to garner your faith look in the word amen look in the word that will bring you the faith that you need to tackle any challenge that might come in your way amen the righteousness even the righteousness of god the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ do you believe in jesus christ well then where does that put you amen where does that put you i know we don't like saying it because the mistakes you made this week or this morning or yesterday or whatever it was or things you said or did or the traps you got caught in whatever forget that right you are justified yes what does justified mean you never did it satan is trying to defeat you with something that never happened amen he's trying to destroy you with something that in the mind of god never even happened right praise the lord don't let him defeat you that way we are the righteousness of jesus christ by faith unto all and upon all them upon all them that believe and that's the same greek word as faith same word here of faith same exact word even though it says believe which sounds like to me when i see the word believe it sounds to me like a lesser word than faith to me that might not to you believe just means well i believe it faith is a step up to me but in the greek it's the exact same word i looked it up exact same greek word so there's no difference in the faith and belief so unto all them that believe there is no difference amen amen praise the lord oh god let that raise our faith let that bring us up to that place that we're supposed to live in you you know because we live brother brandon said 60 years ago we're living so far below our privileges yes oh and i hate to say it today but we still are amen so far below our privilege as saints but there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus the redemption now we've got a redemption that's taking place a purchase a purchased possession because being redeemed through the blood of christ has purchased you and brought you out of where you used to be amen in your sinful condition whom god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith now the perpetuation through faith means that our faith helps us understand that god took our place he perpetuated on our behalf it's like this word is uh is coupled with the word used in the in the hebrew in the old testament for mercy seat that mercy seat that was there in the holies of holies was the place that the priest was to go to make intercession on behalf of the entire camp the entire group of people were to be a forgiven based on that mercy seat being present and every of course everything that god required of him to do and to say and to bring forth that mercy seat that blood of christ then on that mercy seat became that perpetuation it was forgiveness of sin for them and it is an annihilation of sin for us because he took our place we don't have to go to calvary every year every year i think even this past christmas you read about or easter you read about these people who voluntarily allow themselves to be crucified on a cross i think even a young man died this year somewhere from being crucified on the cross i think why would you do that he did it for you you don't need to do that you don't need to go there you don't need to suffer that he became our perpetuation he did it so we don't have to he became us so that we could become him the very righteousness of god himself the just living by faith because you must have faith to believe that because that's not something that's tangible you're not going to see that you're not going to feel that not with your hands you might feel it in your soul but you're not going to feel it with your hands you're you're not going to see it you've got to believe it because the word says so that's the beginning of our faith it's like the statue of a perfect man what's the bottom line the bottom foundation of that house is faith you try to build on anything other than faith and it will come up to the ground faith god sent forth jesus it doesn't say jesus but we know that from what he just said to be a perpetuation to take our place through faith in his blood and we believe that we accept that perpetuation remember a pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted as a pardon even in the land even in the country a pardon is not a pardon unless is accepted as a pardon yes jesus came and became a perpetuation for our sin a perpetuation for our sin but unless we believe it and accept it by faith in christ through his blood it doesn't make any difference he didn't do it in vain because there's going to be somebody to believe it but we have to believe that the just believe that because it's his blood faith in that blood that helps us understand he took my place he took my place and he took my place so i could take his he became me so i could become him praise the lord to declare his righteousness for the remission of sin that is to remit to do away with praise god done away of sin that are passed through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and he might be just and the justifier of him me you him which believeth faith in jesus amen now are you one of them then put your place there put your name there yeah put your life in that scripture right there the justifier of you amen the justifier of you me which believeth in jesus because i believe i have faith i know amen praise the lord where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of words made by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law justified without the deeds is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith so it's faith either way again no difference i know it was applied in a different context earlier but it's the same meaning there is no difference praise the lord circumcision uncircumcision it's all through faith believing do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law amen by faith because we believe what god's word says now a man is justified with uh by faith without the deeds of the law thank god because they tried through an entire old testament for thousands of years to try to be justified in a law and it could not work a fallen man from the garden of eden could never be justified by deeds because there's nothing that could ever have made us in our flesh good enough to please the lord no matter how hard we try no matter what we do no matter what we give no matter how we live our lives no matter how far people seclude themselves or become monks or priests or put themselves in a building separate from anything else you're born with a fallen nature and there's nothing we can do in our flesh that would ever be good enough through any law or rules or regulations or beings to be able to please him to ever be able to reach a place of righteousness it's got to be by faith through the blood of christ and through that perpetuation knowing that he took our place yes that's the only way can't be by deeds but now look james chapter 2. now people look at that and they say well we can just do what we want then god god is okay with that he has amazing grace yes he does yeah his mason his grace is absolutely amazing but his grace is not to be trampled over his grace is not to be made a disgrace amen amen think well i can i can do what i want get away with it no no no it doesn't work that way i mean if you feel that way if you believe that you might as well just go up the catholic church or just go out of religion or god all together because it doesn't work that way right and well god i just i tell this lie god forgive me it doesn't work that way amen there's a difference between willfully doing something and not willfully doing something but maybe we'll talk about that another time but there's a difference amen the bible says if you sin willfully after having received the knowledge there remains no more sacrifice there is a willful doing it and then there's those mistakes that are made that are not willful done but the deeds can never save you no matter how much religions and people try to do it they still try to do it even i sometimes i hate doing this but i've met several people even that say they're in this message and they they still try to make it to heaven on their deeds me and my wife were sitting in a restaurant yesterday having some fish and song came on and said they're working hard to get to heaven and people love his country music song and people love that you know working hard what says heaven working hard who's working hard to get to heaven well first of all you can't get there by working hard am i it doesn't work that way right pardon the redundancy it doesn't work that way you can't work your way into heaven you can't get there by good deeds but that being said look what james says we know this scripture but i just want to read it 7 2 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone faith is a living oracle that's why you can live in faith you can live the just can live by faith because faith itself is a living oracle it is a constant perpetual existence of a spirit life that god that comes out of god so faith is alive it's a living oracle but faith alone without works with it being alone is dead because if it's living if it's if it's a verb if it's an action there's going to be something to follow there's going to be examples there's going to be uh things that you can look and point to and and and examine as as an evidence of your faith and evidence if you will faith even so if not without works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i will show thee my faith by my words amen some people try to work their way to heaven and that's all they got is works deeds but if you truly have faith and believe god to me i know i know the bible says works deeds if you truly have faith it's it's not a work if you truly are living by faith even when things are examples that happen in your life through faith it's not a work not to me i don't consider it a word now james identifies it as a work and that's okay but i want you to express to you how i feel about it if you have faith and you're living godly in christ jesus and that faith is alive in you and it's the life that you live it's a part of who you are it's just living your life it's not doing a work it happens in your life because of who you are not because of what you do understand the the results of your faith if you're a born again christian living by faith just living by faith it is something that happens because it's a part of you yes not because it's something that you did a work to me is something that you do the rich um ruler was full of them wasn't he the rich young ruler had deeds probably outside any of us he was full of deeds and worse the rich young ruler gave money and did all the things in the church and uh all the things that he did brother braham talks about dramatizing the story he was he was a great man he was full of works but where'd he end up he did something now don't misunderstand me it is things that we do but it's not that we do it because it's a work we just do it because we it's just who we are yes i've told you so many times friend and i'll say it again i don't live the life of a chinese woman why don't i live the life of a chinese woman because i'm not a chinese woman i live the life of a white male and there's only one reason i live the life of a white male it's because i'm a white male i live my life because that's who i am it's not a deed that i do i don't go around faking every day to be a white man i don't fake or feign some kind of uh uh good misconception that i'm a white man i just live it because that's who i am and when you have faith and you live this faith in christ jesus all the things that become in your life as a result of that are just living your life yes it's things you do but it to me it's not a work work is something that you just you take out and you go and you do it but that's not what you do when you live it when you live it just becomes a part of your life you just walk down the street living your life and in your wake is the results of that life amen not a work not works not deeds but a result of your life if your life is godly in christ jesus the wake of your walk is going to be the results of who you are not what you do amen now if you are who you are you're going to do what you're supposed to do yes and what's left behind you all the results of that that james calls works and deeds are going to be there yes they're going to be there but they're only going to be there because that's who you are that's right it's because the life you live is because of the person that you are in christ jesus and that's the result of it praise the lord now that's the way i see it now we can call them works and deeds all we want that's fine i know what the bible says i just give you my example what i believe that when a christian lives their life what it really means to be a christian amen those things are what's left behind those are the things that are that are left in your wake when you do what you're supposed to do and live the life the way you're supposed to live amen your faith produces the deeds the just live by faith but you can't be justified without faith you take that to some scientist people stream and yell believe the science they yell and scream believe the science but how many how many genders do we have now i heard my partner say the other day me and michael went and got our hair cut monday and uh he said we were talking about it a little bit he said yeah god made man and woman democrats made all the rest of them that's that's probably not a good joke to tell behind the court but man and woman that's that's where i stand that's what i believe amen but god made that's what god made everything else is perversion but that's god's word now um let's go to colossians chapter 2. so you try to feed that to a scientist your faith your faith is what justifies you but you can't be justified without the faith amen and your faith will produce the deeds colossians chapter 2 verse 4 and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though i be absent in the flesh yet i am with you in the spirit joining and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in christ as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him here we go now walk ye in him so what does it become becomes a wall it becomes a light it's just a life lived amen walking in him rooted and built up in him established in the faith established again a life the just shall live by faith rooted built up in him established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving it becomes your foundation it is your foundation if you're a christian built on the model of the statue of perfect man your foundation must be faith rooted grounded built up from there in that faith that faith is what becomes the foundation of everything you do second corinthians chapter five verse 5 now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also has given us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith we walk by faith not by sight our walk living the just live by faith our walk is faith amen that's how we walk faith not by what we can see amen one more i'm going to close here hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that day approaching amen as we live it as we walk it it is our lives it is who we are amen the just shall live by faith it's how we live martin luther brought it out as a rebuke to the catholic church who majored in all the works all the deeds you can't even be a christian you can't belong to catholic church or whatever the thing is unless you're just full of all the things you do that are right and good and all those things are good all those things are good to do the things that are right and good amen but what was it what would it be like then to try to compare that to jesus walking in the temple with platted ropes and beating him out of the temple right oh my was that love you better believe it was love some of the greatest love ever shown amen outside of calvary of course was the love that he showed that was corrective to those people to try to make them do what is right he took the ropes and flatted them and beat him out of the temple making that temple making that sanctuary that house of god into a den of ill refuge god set him straight jesus went and beat him out and he said well now that was that good deeds was that good works in the might is a man probably not in the eyes of god absolutely because he was protecting that sanctuary yes he was trying to protect the sanctity of that holy place and he beat them out because of how they were acting and what they were doing amen that's why we like to respect our sanctuary when we leave because we expect this this is where we meet god we have god everywhere but this is a special place in time that we come together to meet the lord jesus and we want it to stay that way yes it may not have looked righteous it may not look like good deeds or works to the to man but to god that was a righteous as jesus did while he was on this earth it was to be the mind of god perfect will of god when you're in the center of god's perfect will nothing else matters you can have the faith to believe when jesus went to the garden of gethsemane his sweat became his drops of blood but he did that why because he even asked if this cup could pass but he knew what that will was and in that perfect will he could stand and believe and walk to a calvary be crucified shed his blood give his life for us because he knew i mean how's the song go when he was on the cross i was on his mind amen praise the lord i want to read one more scripture just in honors of a father's day if you want to read with me you can that's fine ephesians chapter 4. i just want to read three verses of scripture ephesians 4 4 there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all in you all amen amen happy father's day let's stand up amen thank you lord a song came on my heart this morning that i didn't give to micah to put on the tablet so we'll just try to sing it here together because that all right amen trust something was

more than an event amen more than just something on the shelf waiting for you to pull it down when you have need of it it's a life amen it's a life by faith we believe amen we live it because it's who we are amen that's the problem a lot of people have today that's why some people stumble and struggle and have such a hard time because it's not in them to live they try to live it they produce works and deeds and they make themselves do things but unless it just becomes a part of your life it becomes who you are struggle is always going to be there yes the struggle goes away friend when it just becomes who you are amen revelation god's word to you born again by the holy spirit becomes your life then it becomes and then the struggle is gone there's no more struggle people struggle with trying to live right and you eat or drink or don't drink or place we go don't go it becomes a struggle people fight and struggle now that we got the enemies enemies always fighting us enemy fights every one of us i guarantee you the enemy fights every one of us every morning to keep us out of church yes every morning to keep us out every sunday morning jesus probably fights every one of us amen but that's to be expected by the end yes yes but the struggle's gone and that's why you're here the struggle's gone very much because it's just who you are amen it's like i told you when me and my wife uh were raising our children it wasn't a matter of meeting in the living room to say well you think we should go to church today are we going to go to church well i don't know what do you think we think you think we should go to church today oh we're like yeah i kind of like the father well you know what's father's day maybe we should go to church oh it's easter we may maybe we should let's go to church team classes you met in the living room at a specific time ready to go to church am i correct there was no debate there was no question it's just because then the struggle's gone the struggle's gone amen you do it because it's who you are amen praise the lord you live by faith the struggle's gone yeah this is who you are maybe don't have to fight struggling oh i i just gotta live right i
