know we kind of we're a little bit of a witness a good witness sir and we invited him to church and he said that he works on sundays but i got the impression that um and i'm going to believe it

gifted to see the future i was saying that we are going to be going into the malls and and being lights and and talking to people and bringing them out and trying to find those last ones and and um

last weekend and there was a woman that was sitting out and i i i was sitting in my car and i heard this crying like a child and so it sounded urgent so i just packed up my stuff and got out since i was going to go in anyway and there was a woman maybe 35 40 years old 35 maybe and and sitting on a blanket with her back against the wall of the store and just so distressed and wailing and i i went up and talked to her and she told me she has fear of people she gave me the scientific name and and and so i talked to her and and and i offered her prayer and the name of jesus christ went over her and just swept that out and she was just transformed like that and and i and so i i told her well just you know from here on out just pray and read the bible that's right and and i i just want to encourage each one of us to not pass the people on the street they are in desperate need and and in the name of jesus christ is lifted up and and um and and we need to um i just i just want to hold that up to you to not be discouraged when you see people that are in such problem problematic stages you know that go and and talk to people talk you know um help them to lift them up out of the fire

amen it's our pastor [Music] oh um [Music] yes we will [Music] is [Music] amen praise the lord we can be in the finest church we can have the finest speaker we could have the pure word present with us we could have prophetic gifts moving and speaking in tongues operation but without him all of it would be in vain amen every bit of it would be in vain right if you weren't here he went here controlling it moving it doing it according to his perfect will and his spirit then we might as well go back to denny's have a nice breakfast lunch whatever because that's all it's going to amount to yeah that's all it'll mean but you know when you just speak his name and sing about him worship him amen he inhabits the praises of his people just a little bit of worship praise from the heart we speak his name he comes he's in the midst and i believe he's here today just a few of us that are here amen sometimes we feel we're lopsided over this way we're outside this way uh just brother john and brother pat sitting on this side but amen i appreciate the lord's goodness i mean different reasons different ones weren't able to be here today uh sister sheila and the vice derose they're out with a family uh trip they're doing a little day trip today with their family so they're not out it's just enormous home with their husband and different ones so but we're thankful that again most of all he's here right here amen could be full amen we could be in a hundred thousand seat stadium but if he's not here it makes no difference it could be one of us here and if he's here then that can change the whole world amen amen praise the lord so that's what we're expecting today amen thankful for thankful that he promised he would be yes amen and i believe he is here today so maybe greece in the name of the lord jesus welcome to the house of the lord appreciate each one of you coming streaming today god bless you appreciate you being here too you heard the prayer requests different things that was mentioned of course i want to reiterate uh the prayer requests for sister hope uh buckles and the family there but of course especially sister hope with the passing of brother uh brother steve um and since we gathered last actually brother roger's dad passed away since we gathered last sunday we were here wednesday but from sunday brother rogers dad passed away last sunday uh evening afternoon evening so since we actually gathered here last sunday brother rogers dads passed away too of course they went back for the funeral and it just want to talk to brother roger about it we always talk about things like that we always like to talk about how the lord moves things and intervenes in our lives and moves us in certain directions and certain events happen to cause southern certain events to take place and you know brother roger told me yesterday that him and his wife and brother will gates were the only three people at the hospital when steve passed away and the first thing that came to my mind is i'm so thankful that brother roger happened to be back there for his dad's funeral so that him and monica and hope and moniker are pretty close monica hope called monica two or three times a day every day since steve's been in the hospital wow they're pretty close and the fact that they were there to be with hope when steve passed friend could make all the difference i mean just yeah that changed the whole atmosphere everything for her and for and for them so uh i'm thankful that i hate brother rogers i'm sad brother rogers dad passed away he's on his reward and and of course the sadness and the morning that it brought to brother roger and his family but uh i'm so thankful he was there uh brother roger had his dad's funeral i said this at the breakfast yesterday but for those who may not know but brother roger went to his dad's funeral friday went to a family gathering friday afternoon and then went to the hospital to see steve when they lifted the restrictions for visitation went to see steve he died that night he passed that night just you just never know who could orchestrate any of this any better than the lord yes it god is just so good amen even even in soldiers of the cross going on to be with him and the sadness and the mourning that it brings who could have made this any better than what it was in the lord amen i tell you i've said this before i say it again i've told other people i said you can live whatever life you want to live friend but even if there is no heaven even if there is no god even if jesus was a hoax even if every bit of it is a fallacy which is of course a light from hell but even if it were i still contend this is the best life to live i still believe that i still would rather be here than in a bar somewhere waking up to next to a strange person or with a gun in my hand because i just gambled away all my entire living right and sitting in the car deciding whether to blow my brains out or not i'd rather be here than any of those places hospital police station jail sick drunk high on drugs i'd rather be here in this life than any place i know of amen i still contend it's the best life to live amen praise the lord i believe that i really do but i'm so thankful that even with that after all of it the best is yet to come praise the lord the best is yet to come amen you have your bibles turn with me to first thessalonians chapter 4. we're going to read this scripture one more time amen as i as it was that i kind of thought it would be i felt loved yesterday that we'll we'll wind up the rapture series with this message today amen talk about the trump and uh not a trump b trump amen not president trump but the trump of god yes amen praise the lord although i do believe he was put in office of god right but we're talking about a different trump here so a lot of times we'll probably try to refer to trumpet because i'm thinking if i mention the word trump too many times on youtube we're going to get flack so i probably try not to say that any more than have to we'll revert over to trumpet and so amen might even get flagged at that i don't know but anyway we'll read this one more time in this rapture series uh with this message today won't be very long um i i i had a i'll just be honest i had just like the first just like to shout in the boys uh this just became overwhelming and and it was a decision to either take it for two or three days two or three services or just simplify it make this it and that's what i felt led to so that's we'll just leave it there and uh just trust the lord to bless it today amen first thessalonians 4 now again before we read the word let us bow our heads forward a prayer precious lord jesus father it is a privilege to be here again this morning as it has been sung as it has been prayed as it has been testified we're so very thankful god that you are with us that lord you put the desire in our hearts to be here and that you guided us to this place once again today sure we had the time set in advance lord we have the place set in advance and we knew all of this was going to be going on but lord it still took a desire it still took an unction it still took a pull in our lives to bring us here this morning lord god i'm thankful that that pull has led us to this place and brought us from the desire of our heart lord to learn more of you to come into this place and to feel your presence to know you to be real once again god in us and lord to explain that to other people is is pretty near impossible lord but if you just feel it one time you know it's real right and lord we've felt it multiple multiple times we know that you're real we know that you're here we know you're going to do the exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think we thank you lord for those that have come those who may be streaming lord may you bless us exceedingly lord bless this the reading of your word i pray again now as we finish up this rapture message lord and this rapture uh series and god we're just trusting and believing you anoint the speaker in the hearer we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the honor and the praise for all that is said and done be with every prayer request every need lord comfort every heart we give you thanks and praise for it now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first thessalonians chapter 4 beginning with verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen you can be seated if you like amen last uh going back to verse 16 here last couple of sundays um we went into the shout the voice as we read here and we find that brother brahm teaches us that the lord does all three of these on his upon his dissension as uh he's descending it comes forth to shout there comes forth a voice and a trump amen we talked about the shout the shout being of course the message get the living bride together those that are alive and remain talk last sunday about the voice the voice of the resurrection the voice that shines that spoke out resurrected lazarus from the dead resurrected those old testament saints from the dead that voice of the resurrection crowd again to rouse together and bring up and bring and resurrect those dead bride saints from the first church age through that has gone on to be with the lord to come and be with us and present themselves and be with us for a minimum of 30 days yes amen shout the voice now the trump the trump of the the the trump that finishes up the trump of god amen that that uh that completes this series of of threes of the shout the voice of trump the three steps that takes us into glory amen now now the trump the trump of god is what calls us all so we have a gathering together of the living and alive remain group we have a calling together of those that are resurrected from the dead and we're all together here and now the trump is what sounds to bring the entire body bride into a rapture to a wedding supper of the lamb that's what the trump is to be for the trump is to call us to that place that's all gathered together under the shout and under the voice we've all been gathered together we're all here we all present ourselves and are together here again for a minimum 30 days and then that trump when that trump sounds we all go to the wedding supper of the lamb the gentile bride to go to meet the lord in the air which is the gathering place that god has for us has been said a table a thousand miles long and wiped the tears from our eyes and uh used to have a picture we probably still do somewhere that table a real long table that's set up a lot of you've probably seen it in chairs chairs lined up and just to think about what that's going to be like amen millions upon millions of people together amen to get fellowship together at that wedding supper that gathering place that time of coming together amen now to get into this again i'll i don't intend to be very long but just uh however the lord leads here now the the to get into the trump now that trump that calls us into the air to meet the lord in the air to go to the marriage supper of the lamb brother madam said down here in the message uh the rapture we're going to uh revisit these couple of things as he says here's therefore the message calls the bride together the shout out amen and the same one he said and with a loud voice he screamed out shouted with a loud voice that woke lazarus when he cried lazarus come forth see it woke him up and that shout that voice wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and the trumpet with the sound of a trumpet and when it does listen now when that trumpet sounds always brother brown said always a trumpet called israel to the feasts of the trumpets now israel being the type and shadow we've used so many times and of course that we bring back over into the new testament into the gentile bride we recognize that god did so many things in types and shadows back there in the old testament and the laws and levitical uh feasts that god brings it back over to this day now when you start getting into those levitical feasts it can take days to bring out and that's why i chose not to do that but i do want to get into specific points of this that bring us to this trump rapture amen this calls this bride to a rapture amen this is what does it now he says now a trumpet called israel to the feast of trumpets or to their feasts amen but brother branham specifically denotes feast of trumpets because it wasn't a little more than a year before this brother branham preached feast of the trumpets right believing that those trumpets were going to be to the gentiles brother branham said he was going to try to get an auditorium like he did uh this the church ages he had and took the whole week and the seals and took the whole week he's going to do the same thing with the plagues the vials the trumpets uh but then the lord began to show him that these trumpets here were like the seals to the to the uh jews right amen amen but this particular trumpet though again like we talked about last week was what uh god is using to call this bride home amen now god brother branham is just typing those trumpets god brother graham's just typing those feasts and those feasts of trumpets to the trumpet that's going to sound to take the bride home the gentile bride home yes so he says now always nice as always trumpet calls israel to a feast a feast of trumpets see which was a pentecostal feast the great feast in the sky the feast of the trumpets and now a trumpet uh do announce a calling together come to the feast so that's the that's the that's the bottom line takeaway from this uh sounding of trumpet or trumpets is it calls people to come together it calls them to come to the feast amen that's that's the whole point of the trumpet the bottom line uh point of the trumpet is to come to the feast yes amen that's what it's supposed to be for so when the trumpet sounds that last trumpet last trumpet of god not trumpet of an angel not the trumpet of a man but the trump of god is to call this bride to that feast yes amen that's what it did old testament and now that is for us now that is the lamb's supper in the sky now watch the assembling together the bride feast of the trumpets wedding supper we've seen it in times now watch just for a moment he's talking about there is he closed that now as brother branham is talking about those feasts let us help try to understand this uh a little bit better by going over to leviticus chapter 23. and we'll read just a couple of portions of it here amen recognizing the sounding the trump sounding of a trumpet remember now brother branham says it here in a later quote i have but remember last week we talked about when paul mentions in the first corinthians when he was talking about the gifts of the spirit when he was talking about speaking in tongues prophecy giving words of edification exhortation or ministering he talked about the the speaking in tongues as the trumpet giving an uncertain sound now of course there's several places in the old testament that deal with the same thing not just these feasts because there are certainly trumpets that are sounded for different reasons through the scripture especially the old testament that denote specific things that's why again like we said last week that paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound how will the people know what to do how will they know how to gather themselves how will they know how to attack how will they know whether it's retreat or attack right because you know in war there's uh there's different uh soundings of the trumpet that meant different things even in some of our i don't know if they do it anymore but some of our more modern day uh war uh there's been trump as revolutionary war and there was a sound of attack if the trumpet blew there was a sound that main attack right if a trumpet blew there was a sound out of the trumpet that meant retreat well if you're confused about what the sound is you might be attacking when you're supposed to be retreating and you're going to die because the chances are you're headed into a horrible place where the enemy is slaughtering you so if you get them confused and you don't understand what they mean then they can they can put you in a bad situation they can cause death injuries whatever you have to know what the trumpet means what the point of the trumpet is if it gives an uncertain sound that people don't know what to do we went over to uh had our little vacation in san diego i'd get up early in the morning and go out on the balcony and was a little chilly with the wind blowing but it was nice with a cup of coffee and a sweater and i could i could hear them blow revelly at the naval station across the water that was so neat listen to the revelry uh being blown in the military base there across the acro and see they all know what that means i don't know what it means i don't you know i'm not asking now it's not the right time to ask but what revelry is i don't even know wake up uh go here do this i don't know come to breakfast i'm not sure what it meant but it was neat to hear anyway but see if they're trained and they know what it means when it sounds and it sounds properly they know what it means and they know what to do they know where to go they know what to take with them they know what to be prepared for because that trumpet is sounding and it's sounding the specific sound it's supposed to and everyone is trained to understand what that sound is that's right what to do about it well when these trumpets sound that they're they're the different trumpets for the different purposes and different reasons amen i won't go into that any much more brother branham does in a later quote we'll hit that a little bit more but in leviticus chapter 23 and in recognizing of course this this is the same thing and you know you god could have used a drum uh god could have used uh uh something else i mean i don't know but the trumpet is the loudest most controllable instrument in my opinion uh a a drum is loud and you know and you could beat it a few times to make it but but but a drum doesn't make a different sound you can make all kinds of sounds with the trumpet right i should have mike bring his trumpet uh you can make all kinds of different sounds of the trumpet all kinds of different notes all kind of different blasts and everything you can do and it's really loud right trumpets are very loud uh trust me when my practice trumpets are very loud uh fortunately he got real good at it quick but anyway uh they're very loud so they can be heard so when they reverberate through a valley or through a desert area where there's little obstruction people all around can hear it people can hear that trumpet from from long distances amen you can have a drama beat and drum's kind of loud but you're limited as in as to the uh uh the number of sounds you can make from a drum a drum just basically makes one sound you could you could tap it a different way but you know if you hit tap tap tap tap or something like and and and somebody a little distance away said when it was that two caps or three well then you're confused again god's not the ultimate confusion there's going to be no confusion right and but with the trumpet there's no question uh it's so loud and so pronounced that it it's easy to distinguish leviticus 23 now uh god talks about these things the lord's faith unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts amen now what's a feast a feast is something you have where people come and gather together right you come and you bring everybody together those that have an invitation those that have a uh uh have been asked they they are the ones that come together to this feast if they're part of that family or if they're part of that group or that company if they're a part of the family of god uh that calling is a calling them to a feast and that's what god said these are the feasts that i want you to have they are even holy convocations and that convocation is nothing more than a sacred gathering right a sacred sacred gathering now you can see why brother branham led us back here when he talked about the trump of god that was calling the bride to a wedding supper because it's a sacred gathering it's a sacred coming together it's a holy convocation a bringing of a gathering together to the feasts where god wants to uh to to supply to us like he would at the marriage supper of the lamb amen six days shall uh six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest and holy convocation ye shall do no work therein it is the sabbath of the lord and all your dwellings and that's exactly what it will be for us saints amen there will be a rest god will call us home and we will rest from all of our labors yes we'll set there and you can understand i mean i we could all understand why there might be a tier or two drop from our eyes and sitting there and thinking about it just resting and realizing that there's no more toil there's no more struggle there's no more fight there's no going to be there's not going to be any more losing of family members or passing on i'm going to be in more mournings or no more graves very dug and no no more sirens to listen to ringing through your apartment at night and there's no there's not going to be any stillborn babies all that's going to be done away with and just to set there when that all-in-consuming spirit comes into you and you start beginning to think of how could you not drop a tear that's right but jesus will come and wipe them all away amen amen said it was well done praise the lord entered into the joys of the lord and you sat there at rest it's a time of rest right it's symbolic amen it's a time of symbolism of of of of rest of a peace of a settlement it's been it's been tried out it's been done it's been finished and now it's a rest yes amen you know what it feels like sometimes and you know people coined that tgif for a reason i don't know if it matters anymore because so many people work on saturdays and sundays anymore i don't even know if tgif exists or even hunt day which used to be wednesday where people would get to friday and they go i get to rest now my labors of the week is over now i can enter into a weekend where i don't have to have this on my mind now even if there was other things to do even if you had to pull weeds or or whatever chores you might have had on a saturday or something even with that it's still different than knowing on your mind and your spirit that you've got to get up and it's so and so a time you've got to be at a place and you got to go and and and the grind is there as they call it the the the job grind is there that grind is lifted you know of course yeah if you love what you're doing and you really enjoy your job then it's not so much a grind but for most people it's not that way but you understand how that rest enters in you feel that rest you can see the symbolism of that rest maybe brother john when you finish a job you finish a job and you get paid and you can take a little rest you feel like a weight's lifted yes and it's just that's just a microcosm just a small symbolism of this that we're talking about of why god is calling us to that to that feast to that holy convocation to that gathering where we all gather together and we we come together and that trump calls us to that supper and we have uh we had that time together of rest with the lord jesus all our friends all our family people we may not have known but saints from the dark ages and all through we get to set together at that supper and enjoy it amen and rest have a rest praise the lord this holy convocation the sabbath it's a rest it's a rest these are the feasts fourth verse of the lord even holy convocations which he shall proclaim in their seasons amen now as that trumpet called to the feast that trumpet is what is is the significance that brought them to that place amen now in feast of the trumpets which is what brother branham preached uh as a result of the lord showing him that this was for the gentile for the jews he he brought it down to just a simple message instead of taking a seven part series uh that would have been more significance or importance to the gentile this was for the jews so he laid it out because of scripture needful for us to know to a point but it wasn't as necessity as something that was strictly for the gentiles for us for this last day bribe which was which was which was his message right that was brother brown's message remember the shout gather us together yes amen the shout was in particular now each one again that received their shout of their message for their age they played their part they'll come up too but that shout out to that message of of this last day wasn't for all of them it was for us it was for this last day it was for this this group that was to pass on of course but that was to be an alive and remain group too it was supposed to be something to bring her enough rapturing faith that would change our bodies one day yes amen that we would be ready and have the rapturing faith to go beyond this mortal reach yes and to expect that hallelujah amen that message it was brought to us so brother and preached feast of the trumpets it was july 1964 he did preach an outstanding mess now i i will say this and give just this smackling of a warning i have heard different what i considered rogue doctrines come out of the feast of the trumpets and i believe that is because brother branham preached this because these were to the jews not the gentiles and when people start misapplying them right then they can it can muddle up the whole gentile picture it can muddle up the whole picture of our time and our day and what the lord's doing for us yes and i think that's kind of maybe some of what happened amen but it has to come from the lord so if god god keeps a god called minister straight god keeps his children straight and we're going to stay straight on his word regardless it's all got to meet the middle of the road yeah amen i i brought brother david over here yesterday and showed him a church and david fritz and and we were talking a little bit and you know i said there's we were talking we always end up talking doctrine but we were talking about some things and he mentioned some things he'd heard and stuff and you know and and and i told him i said there's there's things i'll mention that uh that i feel the lord has revealed to me that brother babe didn't say or that you can't specifically pinpoint in the scripture yes i do but i always caveat that with you do i not i always caveat that with you to let you know now this i don't find this in the message i don't find in the scripture this is my opinion this is what i feel the lord has revealed to me and i'll let you know that you have to know that course you have to work out your own salvation anyway right but i'll let you know that i don't i haven't found it now what i do do now then this is the point i'm trying to make here what i do is if i feel like the lord has shown me something i don't just take it and run with it i check the scripture and make sure what he's showing me is scripture right because of what he's showing me or what i said well brother man didn't say it but i feel the lord revealed this to me but if i can't run it through the scripture what i feel the lord show me if it won't go through the scripture then i still leave it alone right yes i still don't want to if i can't if i can't verify and legitimize in the bible what i feel like the lord showed me then i still don't touch it right and i believe that's the whole that's the whole point of it see if it's not through this scripture leave it alone amen that's what it boils down to see and that's i'm afraid that's what a lot of people get to uh in the breach of first seals you know when brother brown preached the breach which a lot of confusion comes from the seals weren't even opened yet right or they weren't even revealed i should say not even to brother brown but the adam had received brother madam had not received the revelation of the first seal when he preached the breach right he had not received a revelation of the second seal when he preached the first right and on and on and on and on that's why you see later in his ministry in the next uh the following subsequent couple of years things that uh might actually seem different than what he had in like the breach or or the seals you know he talks about in the breach about the the lamb taking the book the intercessory leaving the mediator seat and no more blood on the mercy seat and a lot of people run with that so there's no more blood on the mercy seat but if you listen later on in in the messages remember the brother man was talking about what the scripture said not that it was happening that second right right but then as he goes on through in his ministry you hear him several times say well if there's no blood on the mercy seat god don't even hear your prayers right yeah well then what do you do how do you reconcile the two a lot of people say well mercy's only in the bride and this that and the other and uh but but i want you to know i'm god's bride and i still need mercy amen right i still need blood on the mercy seat yes i'm not the mercy seat although i can offer mercy to others right that blood still has to be there for me yes the prayers i prayed here this morning i expect god to hurt him and according to the message he didn't if that blood's not there right do you see how things can get all scrupled up you know sometimes it just i i think sometimes we just take this radical idea and just drop it off and take this radical idea from there and just drop that off and just come and meet there's going to be a truth in there somewhere brother man talked about that's why we i preached a few years back scripture means scripture right right because there's there's a bringing together somewhere his brother graham said armenianism had a truth but not all truth calvinism had truth but not all truth but both of them if you brought them together had an absolute truth because there's an absolute truth somewhere yes and that's where we want to be amen feast of the trumpets now but around again to the to the jews but brother branham's typing here notice the trumpets that we're speaking of is a call together for either now now brother brown gives these different examples a call together for either a feast for war for a person or some sacred day or something so there's different reasons each one of these feasts each one of these feasts of trumpets there's even a feast of trumpets amen after the feast of pentecost right you ever notice that's a there's the feast of pentecost leviticus 23 uh uh 15 16 17 there's a feast of pentecost and then you got seven sabbaths which would be the time for the seven church ages and then you had the blowing of the feast of the trumpets right amen yeah the feast of pentecost the birth fourth of the gentile church and from that time to this time today there's been seven church ages and there's about to be the blowing of a trumpet right to take this bride home and then immediately oh i love this immediately after the feast of the trumpets there's the feast of atonement which is exactly what the jews are going to receive after the wedding supper of the lamb we go we get our trumpet and we go home right amen but now here there's a feast of atonement that takes place for the jews and they receive their messiah praise the lord it'd be beautiful maybe i should have taken two or three services anyway it it's just beautiful but now look he's telling us here again there's the trumpet that sounds for calling a feast war person sacred day but notice each one of these particular things that the trumpets calling for is still a gathering of people it's still a coming to gathering of people amen amen to a feast war feast person sacred there something he said notice you say for a person yeah or for the year for the year of jubilee the announcing of the coming of freedom at the jubilee trumpet there is a there's a liberation there's a freedom the trumpet blows to liberate these people and if they who want to be set free of course they don't want to be set free they take it all bore holding their ear and they're slaves to the rest of their lives but after the 50 years all the property was gone has to come back to its original honor anybody that was taken indentured servant or slave has to be released and given their freedom all that happens at the jubilee right well there's a trumpet for that that's what brother brown said it could be for a specific person if you hear that trumpet blow and you know what it means then you know what your rights are you know what the trumpet blow means you know where you're standing you know what your rights are you know what that trump is being blown for and you know it's speaking to you amen and if you were a slave like we all were and that trumpet were to blow and you know what the blowing of that trumpet meant to you then you knew that you had the opportunity to go free praise the lord when that trumpet blew in your life you knew you had the opportunity to go free and you took it rather than have your ears bored with a hole in them and slaves the rest of your life to the devil you decided to go free and be liberated because who the lord has set free is free indeed right amen you had that opportunity but you had to understand what was being blown they had to understand had to know what was being blown what did this trumpet mean if they didn't know they could be a slave's wrestler yes unknowingly you mean i had the chance to go free and you didn't take it mike did you imagine all that day saints we get to that place and people they're going to be people saying you mean i could have gone free yes and you turned it down right yes sir right mine that's going to be a bad day for a lot of people a horrible day oh my announcing the coming of freedom when you could go back now and you could complete mourning uh on just one thing but now getting into the trumpet he says you got the background now of the seals and the church ages now we're going into the trumpet the trumpet sounded and a trumpet denotes again he reiterates this either war feast day or what it means again hitting this baseline what it means is a gathering together of the people praise the lord that's what it meant trumpet meant gathering together of the people whether it was for war whether it's for feast whether it's for jubilee what whatever the purpose of it was it was it was a gathering together of the people right amen now the shout the voice brings us all to that place but we're not together yet are we right we're under that one auspice under that one umbrella but you're still got bride over on the other side of the world right people i still don't know right but the trumpet is going to bring us all together yes amen amen we'll speed up they'll slow down we'll reach that shore together saints amen we'll go to meet the lord in the air amen well what's the air that's the air i was just in the air this is air right here people think the only air that exists is a thousand miles up there right that's not the only air that exists this right here is air too where we're going to go meet him in the air well hey lord that's air so people make some things more complicated than they really need to be but yes we go to meet the lord in the air yes amen it's a gathering gathering of people paul said when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound again get back to that who can prepare themselves for war for peace whatever it is who knows you have to know what the trumpet sounds and i want to get to another particular point here before we before i finish this out you have to know what the trumpet sounds therefore when the trumpet sounds we see something in the earth today there is a great trouble somewhere we know that and this was 1964 so how much greater has it gotten since then we know there is everybody uh everybody has come a neurotic the whole world is a neurotical world and isn't that the truth yeah and we know there is something wrong the pentagon everywhere we know there is something wrong now the only way listen now the only way you'll know what the trumpet sound is is to look what the sheet music says what's the sheet music only way you're going to know what the trumpet sound is is to look and know what the sheet music is yes amen you got to know what the music is to know what the sound is or how to sound he said that's all it's a great symphony see beating out like peter and the wolf see though that sure dates it doesn't it peter in the wall see when you see uh the composer has wrote the book the composer has wrote the book and the director now the director must be in the same spirit as the composer amen speaking of himself of those that uh preach the word or amen propagate the word that if you propagate the word you you must be in the same spirit as the composer you must read the you must read the sheet music in the same spirit that the director wrote that the composer wrote it in and the [Music] people walk out in the heartbeat we listen to that and pay a hundred dollars to come listen to a bunch of squealing and squawking who would do that but when you get it all working in fine harmony and perfectly together and this one does his partners and does this part and all this and then the director is in the same spirit as the composer and that music comes forth my it's a beautiful sound yeah have you only gone to a symphony before orchestra music a lot of people don't like it i love it i don't i'd say i love it but i like it i do i like listen all the instruments come together used to be a band for several years so when i listen to that i think oh that's so beautiful you see how they play and they're so uh it's it's it's beautiful even watching the poke kids play when you see how how they they play their instruments and how they and you know they have commanded that instrument and they play it and when they bring that ball across that string man it's beautiful amen amen because they know what they're doing yes amen they've gotten into the spirit of the composer amen the director the minister must be in the spirit of the composer if he doesn't he gives the wrong beat and the whole thing is out that's what's the matter today we've got too many directors it's not in the spirit of the composer right now yes then i'll say amen amen i have to be one of the directors but by the grace of god i try to stay in the spirit of the composer but the band said too many directors that are not in the spirit of the composer amen oh that's why we get this brother branham is god and all this stuff that's where all that comes from right amen all those doctrines and things that's that's what they all come from right you gotta directors self-composed directors that are out of the spirit of composer amen this is this when they draw this can't take it all through the bible you just pull a quote out here or a scripture out here but it won't match letter to letter word the word scripture scripture it won't match it was like i was saying before if you try to take a hard line and out of the breach message what are you going to do over here in 65 when he says something that would sound contrary right what are you going to do with it i told you before i had that brother in florida but he used to do that pray about it pray about a prayer about it i said brother the more i pray about it the father i'm getting from where you are the more the lord is revealing to me the less i can see where you're at you're a dark spot right now you're so far away from me you tell me to keep praying about it it's getting me further from you right i said you know what he said well what about this and then i said well what about this because in my prayer and study the lord would show me this right and i said what about this i can show you where the lord backs this up can you show me where it backs this up right yeah what are the quotes do you have what other scripture do you have does this follow a scriptural pattern or a scriptural precedent and it doesn't and if it doesn't friend there's something wrong somewhere yes because if god done it one way one time one way he's gonna do it that way all the way through there's gonna be the scriptural precedent and pattern that god follows and if somebody says well this has got to happen brother branham's got a private resurrection coming and he's going to follow over the country i said show it to me where's the scriptural precedent do i believe he's coming back with my dad and my son and my mom and my family yes yes i do what he's going to do in that 30 days i have no idea brother green's gone now but he said if brother battle needs a plan i'll pry i have a credit card i'll charter him apply private jet and i'll take him wherever he wants to go he said by the time the bill comes due i'll be gone all right nemo 30 days right so when the bill's due i'll be gone but i'll find anywhere he wants to go if that's what happens i don't believe that but you know it's just a little knock on the the ideals and not i'm not trying to belittle others beliefs but uh there just comes a time where it says really right you have you have to you can't just say this is going to be this you've got to show it scripturally you've got to find the scriptural precedent you've got to find the patterns in the bible where god has done this or or does this right if it doesn't exist then it it's it's highly unlikely it's going to happen now because everything that we everything that we have refers back to this amen my god in the scripture might have had things that he started but that that day is in the scripture everything we do falls back to this this is our pattern this is our blueprint it says put a wall there you put a wall there not over there right if it says make the wall three foot high you make it three foot high not ten foot high you gotta follow the blueprint amen if that's what he said that's what we do and that's where so many times directors get out of the spirit of the composer they say this denomination well this no matter what you say the bible is right beat it out according to the sheet music beat it out according to this direct it let each instrument blow this particular time note play space amen according to this sheet music am i amen not not not a pastor not not a pope not a prophet not a denomination right but according to this this is our pattern always our pattern it doesn't follow this it is wrong that's right then the great symphony of god great act is playing out just right then we see the hour that we are lit that we are standing now notice the trumpet is to call together the people assemble themselves together for something now we know what our something is amen i hope this camera keeps working because i forgot to turn my phone off um but we know what our something is we know that we are gathering together this trump is going to gather us together to meet the lord in the air for the wedding of letting suffer the lamb we know what our something is that's what our gathering is for yeah praise the lord and a new body yes no corruption my sometimes it announced an important person he said like joseph the sounding of the trumpet joseph appeared which is a symbol of the great trumpet we speak of he's talking about after a while he said now when the grave trumpet sounds when that ensign will be lifted up there'll there'll come a time when the great trumpet will be signed and all nations will gather to it to jerusalem that's when the millennium starts the great trumpet well when is that that is after the atonement oh you could get into and we could so easily go back into the feast and find where brother branham found that after that time that after that feast after that seventh feast that seventh church age the sevens that brother adam the threes five sevens the scriptural uh numerics in the scripture so what do you do with that seventh now it's run out but now you've got because remember the seventh age runs in through the millennium you realize that right people always say well and we have songs we sing it we read in the scripture and time is no more people think time cease to exist when the bride leaves no it doesn't right you got a tribulation going on you got armageddon that goes on right you've got god revealing himself to the jews uh you got the millennium you got gog and magog and then the white throne judgment right amen time runs through all that even through the millennium right there'll be time right and we had that discussion yesterday i think i actually may have brought a quote up about it and uh now if we did it's going to be in here somewhere amen well i don't know if i printed it or not uh i had some quotes pulled up and my computer conked out on me so i had to start all over again so i may have forgotten to put that one in there but the discussion we had was about you know we're gonna our brother pat i think said are we gonna build our own houses when we get there it's like well it's been somewhere you're talking about it's the millennium according to scripture brother brown yes new city no it's already all prepared for us right amen so so the time period of the millennium is is a different period it's that thousand years that we'll spend with the lord whether nobody dies breaking the curse of the original sin right in the garden of eden no man's lived a thousand years or one day with god since uh the sin the god of eden nobody but it will be and we all will be in the millennium together yes praise the lord and i found a quote that was along those lines where brother branham said that which refreshed my memory that brother brown did say that he talked about yeah in the millennium they'll be building houses and eating the fruit of the vineyards and things like that and i know when brother lionel read that he was real excited because he's a carpenter so building houses well praise the lord that was right up his alley but um but anyway so uh here i wanted to get to this quote so the we finished off with the with the with the idea the thought that um that you you have to be in the spirit of the composer the director should be in the spirit of the composer the people the the instruments should be in the spirit of the composer the director and when they're all working together in harmony in unison it makes beautiful music right but if i were to go up there and i were to try to play a clarinet like my wife tried to do in high school or read the sheet music of of a trumpet or even a guitar piano uh i played the drums boom boom boom boom that's that's what i knew i could read music a little bit every little boy does every good boy does fine face but anyway i could read music but to to try to get it behind and to play something i would be completely lost see it was only for that person the composer wrote it for everybody to be included but i could go and i could play the drums to that music but i couldn't even begin to think about playing guitar or piano or trumpet or something to that music i'd have no clue right you see so each one was made for each person for them to understand right now how are we gonna know how does the bride know because it's not for everybody this rapture is not for everybody it's only for a small selected alive and remain group that's still here now of course it's for those that resurrect two but we're just talking about the live and remain group see he says here now he said why didn't this feast of the trumpets again still why didn't they get it why didn't the jews understand why didn't the jews get it they were righteous men listen now they were righteous men they were good men they were holy men there were all kinds of people but to whom it is predestinated to hear the word right it's only to those who are predestinated to hear the word amen now if a clarinetist or a flutist or something was in an orchestra that person was hand-picked maybe out of 200 different flutists flautas flutists clarinettis their knives i don't know out of 200 they picked one maybe two maybe three but out of 200 a few were selected to do that to play that part it's not for everybody it was only for the predestined right for those to hear the word it was only for the predestination for those to listen to the trumpet of freedom when it sounded and you heard that voice of freedom that loosed you from the binds of the the bonds of satan and it loosed you it was only for the predestination yes amen now the the invitation was free for all understand the invitation went out to everybody amen but only those that chose and and and decided to go that were the predestined that god knew before the foundation of the world to whom it is predestined to hear the word well to whom it is predestined they'll be the ones to hear that trumpet amen when the trumpet of god sounds it'll be the predestined that hears it not everybody's going to know it it's a secret the bride is a secret going away the world won't know about it there'll be some people left behind that'll know because they were privy to certain information but they're not going to know there'll be certain people to say well where did john go well i knew john duncan yeah he was you know lived here and painted and did all this and i hadn't seen him a while anybody seen him oh no he's gone i don't know what happened amen and people know so well i noticed so-and-so is gone too well you know i haven't seen so-and-so in a while either reckon it could have happened already and it will have yes it will have happened yes it's a promise predestinated here the word how do you know whether it is the word how do you know whether it's the word each one says this that and the other is the promise of the bible being vindicated of that age there you are then you come back to where the holy spirit is it's the word of god vindicated that was predicted scripturally vindicated at that in that age at that time with those people there you are that's where this whole that brother ramen says that's where you come back that's where the holy spirit is watch the sound of a trumpet in a few minutes it declares the trumpet the gospel trumpet see who can hear it who can hear it remember those in the walled cities could not come out in the jubilee no sir they were in the walls and other parts that you believe wanted to talk about but anyway in that walls they could not see it they could not come out no sir they were in the walls they had to stay there it was over they were slaves the rest of their life because they had been marked slaves the rest of their lives they could not hear it they could not participate they weren't a part of it it's for the predestination those that god has selected and pre-chosen amen to hear that trump that trump of god that sounds out amen the trump of god the voice of god revelation chapter one i'll read this i got one more quote i want to finish with revelation chapter one verse uh we'll start with verse nine i john who also am your brother and command a companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the owl that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet amen what trumpet is that it's the trump of god amen that is the trump of god yes person i go by sometimes up here on aina and i see that beautiful mormon lds temple they got set up there and some and i tell you what friend those are some diligent people because that guy up there blowing that trumpet stays as crisp and clean and and shiny as you'd want any element to be shined and it's not easy to get to every time i every time i go by it that thing is shining and it probably to have a heart a speck of dust on it somebody probably cleans it every week but he's standing there blowing the trumpet supposed to be gabriel maybe michael i don't know this is the trump of god friend when the trump of god blows it's god's speaking right just like he did in in with moses amen when he spoke it trumpeted when they listened to that voice it trumpeted it when john heard that voice speak it was like a trumpet saying i am alpha omega the first and the last and what thou see is write in the book and send it unto the seven churches where asia ephesus merdian pergamos ty tyra sardis philadelphia laodicea but that voice like a trumpet amen god's call right well no yes well no people say how will you know how will you hear it how will it be some things will experience it to know it that's just happens sometimes sometimes you hear old people say the the best lessons in life are what learned learned lessons are the best lessons in life we'll learn it when it happens we'll know right it won't be a secret not to us right amen the rapture now finish with this the rapture and finish this up and the rapture series now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride suffer the marriage supper with the bride in the sky first things come forth this message calling the bride together next thing resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that have died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends amen that's the thing that takes place we're right here now ready the only thing the church bride coming out has to lay before the sun to ripen combine will come by soon after a while gathered into the garden and that's where and how much more is there to gather how much more is there coming out we don't know but we're coming to this precipice this peak this end this time where i believe we're all looking to believing for that rapture that's gonna and that trump is gonna call us home yes amen next thing we're looking for though is our loved ones to appear yes amen we heard the shout yes amen i couldn't tell you whether we'll hear the voice or not but we'll know it because they'll be here in front of us right that's right but then we'll all hear the trump right amen amen the trump will speak and it'll set us free and liberate us from this pest house the faith of god that shakes these beads into a perfect body into an incorruptible body to go to meet him in the air yes oh what a celebration what a time together amen i'm i'm personally i'm sick of this pedestal yeah amen and i i've told you before i love my life i enjoy my life i appreciate god for life all right i'm ready to go whenever he can amen amen not before time amen but whenever he calls praise the lord ready for that rapture ready for that rapture amen praise the lord let's stand if we could yes looking for that time amen but we'll work wait amen until jesus comes he'll work amen there's some resting in our labors amen but as long as we're battling in this body that was one of the things my precious brother in florida had we're not working now we're resting don't sing that song anymore i said brother i don't know what where you think we're at but i'm still laboring in this whole nasty pest house yes every day laboring in this nasty pest house i'm settled in my spirit spiritually yes amen right but i'm looking for that to wit the changing of our bodies yes amen praise the lord number 87 let's sing this to the lord before we go today number 87 when the world is called up yonder amen maybe get joel a chance to get that tambourine out number 87 praise the lord when the trumpet of the lord [Music] is [Music] is [Music] glory of his resurrection [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] i'll be there [Music] amen amen amen thank you jesus hallelujah oh when that trumpet of the lord shall sound see even in this even in this song when the trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be no more they're not synonymous things right that trumpet doesn't end time amen but we sing them and worship the lord that's okay people pick part songs and things it's okay we just sing and worship the lord amen the trumpet of the lord shall sound amen and the dead in christ and we'll all be together and go meet him in the air amen hallelujah thank you lord amen not bright and cloudless morning every time i every time i sing that i could hear brother brandon i'm on the rapture message talk about that brings the band brings in this song on that bright and cloud this morning because you know he said between 60 believe between six and nine some morning amen that's when that will take place now six and nine does that mean kentucky time is that six and nine cover california to north carolina uh three times the the time zones we have three three eastern central mountain pacific is four times long so it says four hours difference in depending on so yeah you can bring in all kinds of variables is it going to be here is that six to nine in the morning here is that 69 in australia is that 69 rushes amen praise the lord i would think if that was if that was completely accurate it would be uh the hills of kentucky time amen or tucson either way but it doesn't matter whenever it is we'll just be ready amen praise the lord god bless you appreciate each one of you being here today pray the lord bless you said something to strength you help you today and the lord finish that rapture we'll see what the lord does next sunday is the sunday before thanksgiving so maybe see if the lord has something for that thanksgiving message maybe maybe some more testimonies we'll see but whatever he had for us uh lord willing uh i guess i didn't even ask mike i guess we're gonna paint tomorrow i was planning on painting tomorrow i was planning on painting the church tomorrow um so or william will be here tomorrow painting anybody's want who wants to come willing to come want to come i already did some preliminary work i could do a little sanding on the drywall on the mud there's a few little places but i mean look at the wall anyway it's not like flat so i'm not too worried about it santa claus a couple edges down most i got it most uh pulled out there i'm not sure i still have to go get the paint and stuff for it i don't have the paint or the i don't even have any brushes or rollers or anything yet so i have to get those together but okay so it shouldn't take too long of cutting in is kind of the more time-consuming part my brother john yeah yeah and uh and then the rest and get a couple cutters couple rollers we'll get it done but even if it's just me and micah we'll get it we'll get it it won't it shouldn't be too bad did you have a question system so if you want to lord willing then the next time we come back in service it will be a different color it won't be hugely different it'll be the grayish type color is what we picked kind of that matches the carpet a little bit more amen but lord william i'm going to try to do that tomorrow brother rogers extended his stay in in jeffersonville to the end of the week because of steve's passing and he's supposed to he was asked to officiate the funeral so he'll be gone probably at least till thursday so probably do again uh this monday i haven't heard from craig yet about the facility for our dinner but we're still working on it the refrigerator is supposed to be here friday uh i've noticed there the cleaning crew and all was in over here today cleaning out this place next door so we'll we'll let you know about that when that time comes but it's likely going to be the 5th or 12th not sure yet but december and that will do it so amen it seems like i had another thing to say but i can't remember yeah what about tuesday i have a doctor's appointment at 1 15. uh you're going to be here tuesday probably not i promise joel my tuesday what's that again i promised joel my tutor okay yeah they wanted to get together too and then wednesday which i hear the service but you said there's no no service wednesday right thank you no service this wednesday or the following wednesday this wednesday of course the paint i made if i need to come back and paint wednesday i may be here with painting wednesday too some uh i want to get rid of these chords too so i'm going to fix all this to where the chords go away um so i still have some work in here to do uh but wednesday yes wednesday that's that was the thing i was want to say wednesday service is canceled in lieu of the paint fumes the next wednesday's canceled because the thursday following is thanksgiving so the next two wednesdays are canceled we'll our wednesday reconvening wednesday will be december 1st amen so thank you that's uh that's the one thing i wanted to remember to say again yes thank you amen praise the lord god bless you we did uh i'd probably do it when we have more brothers but there's three sisters it's it's very unusual for brothers to outnumber sisters in a message church but i looked i thought well we got a trifecta of sisters here the rest are all brothers now but we enjoyed the breakfast yesterday so we talked about doing that maybe once a month a breakfast one on a saturday morning once a month doing that so i hear i see a lot of nodding so maybe we'll do that then you can come you can can't you know we'll try to switch it up and go different places maybe um see what the lord does with that i enjoyed the fellowship so yeah it was a real blessing you can't beat that 6.99 breakfast though yeah true maybe in taste not in price john's disagreeing with me too no my wife likes it i know that amen praise the lord so we'll think on that and and uh if y'all want to text me or throw a date uh that you like the next time then we'll look to that and see what we could do but i like that idea so lord richly bless you today anything else before dismissed patricia wanted it said that she does not have goldman amen if it entered in anybody's mind since brother pat said that uh neither does julie and her sister they don't have it of course julie she has natural immunity because she had it previously which is even stronger than the shot plus she got the shot so that's true um but her sister actually got tested and she is negative is educated on the csi effect and she says i know that the tests don't always come out correct so true true we've seen that with joel you just came back positive you never had code none of us got it but anyway yeah that's true great truth i i wanted to say you know the lord i think the lord just gave me a revelation but you inspired the lord to give me the revelation and picking them when your name is called you know i i didn't come up on my own i believe the lord just said that you know your name is your name in any language you're john in english you're still john in french you're john you know if you say you call me this then that's what your name is yeah amen no matter what language you speak yeah the lord don't call your name no matter what language you're speaking it's going to be your name amen yes yeah just not sure if i'm going to be identified as newton on the other side i think he's got me a new name but we'll know it either way he says either way because it's a call in the heart not the year right amen it's funny because i'm sorry to keep you i when i was driving uber i was down and some people came and knocked on the window and i looked and they said what hey like no you must have the wrong car because i've been waiting on the people and they stuck their head hey oh i don't know who you're looking for oh yeah no that's me that's me yeah because i forget an uber i'm george and they were spanish so i was like no that's not me well yeah it is me the lord god bless you again appreciate you coming amen god's good to us isn't he very much amen we appreciate you all remember the request and prayer this week and again uh sister sister hope just really continues to be heavy on my heart so please pray for her amen to praise the lord brother john would you dismiss this problem amen blessed lord are god amongst
