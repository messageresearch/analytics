[28:41] once again to be in your presence.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Knowing one word from you will make all
[28:47] the difference. Lord, we're here for one
[28:51] purpose and that's to draw closer to
[28:54] you.

[28:55] &gt;&gt; To be better prepared,

[30:06] Lord, it's not time to make excuses why
[30:09] we can't obey your word. THERE'S SOME

[30:48] "Father, a person is not even a
[30:51] Christian until the the Holy Spirit of

[43:13] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord Jesus calling us to a
[43:15] higher walk.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord wanting us to become more

[43:54] belong to him, he's not pulling.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; You don't belong to him. There's no call
[43:59] there.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; When you feel that pull and you feel
[44:01] that call, you know it's the Lord moving
[44:04] you.

[44:11] thankful for that today. Amen. Praise
[44:13] the Lord. God bless you. Anyone have a
[44:16] testimony or something on your heart
[44:18] today
[44:19] like to give to the Lord? Sister Norman.
[44:23] Back in July of June,
[44:28] I had an MRI and they saw
[44:35] in my
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. I remember that.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And then they
[44:42] I had another MRI
[44:45] this month. No, I knocked over and
[44:51] then they checked my
[44:53] cancer and they said I didn't have
[44:56] cancer. So I give God praise.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; By his stripes I am healed.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord Jesus. God is good.
[45:06] Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord Jesus. Anyone else?
[45:10] [snorts]
[45:11] Amen.
[45:14] God bless you. Then we'll stand to our
[45:15] feet. Amen. Good to see each one of you
[45:18] again. Praise the Lord again if you're
[45:20] streaming. God bless you too. Good to
[45:22] have you as well.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh thought probably since I
[45:27] started the streaming back during CO,
[45:29] I've probably thought 20 times about
[45:32] stopping the streaming. And about as
[45:34] soon as I get ready to think about
[45:36] stopping it, somebody will come up to me
[45:38] and say, "I'm glad you had the
[45:39] streaming." And I'm like, "Well, Lord, I
[45:42] guess I just take that as a sign that
[45:44] we're just supposed to keep it going."
[45:46] So, uh, we just keep it going. And I'm
[45:48] thankful. now that certain ones aren't
[45:51] even able to make it that we have it.
[45:53] So, amen. As long as I know, we'll just
[45:57] keep uh keep that going and just so
[45:59] thankful that uh if you're there, Amen.
[46:02] that God bless you as well. Welcome to
[46:04] the service.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to be as much part of the
[46:06] service as we are here as much as can
[46:08] anyway. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're
[46:11] going to uh go in our in [clears throat]
[46:13] the scripture here to Ephesians chapter
[46:15] 4. We're going to pick up where we left
[46:17] off a couple weeks ago.
[46:20] Amen. It's uh been uh a little bit of
[46:23] time. We'll probably background a little
[46:24] bit of what we spoke on uh before we uh
[46:28] finished our service that Sunday.
[46:32] Uh but uh I believe we've had a service
[46:35] we missed because I wasn't feeling well
[46:37] and brother N. And uh but anyway, we'll
[46:40] just uh continue on with what the Lord
[46:42] gave us here. We're going to go to
[46:43] Ephesians. We're still in adoption. This
[46:45] will be part 31B.
[46:48] U we kind of spoke on it last time. Uh
[46:51] but it didn't quite uh get into all I
[46:54] wanted to with it. So figured that when
[46:57] I closed that last time, we said we'd
[46:58] just carry it on uh to try to complete
[47:01] this today. So this is kind of I guess
[47:03] you'd say part adoption part 31B. Last
[47:06] time was A. This will be the five-fold
[47:09] ministry. Um I guess part 4B. Last time
[47:14] was part four, so not sure how else to
[47:16] name it except that maybe. Uh but uh
[47:19] anyway, that's what we'll continue on
[47:21] today. So, Ephesians chapter 4. Before
[47:24] we read the word, we just bow our heads
[47:25] for a word of prayer. Lord, we're so
[47:28] very thankful again of this service, of
[47:30] this time, of this day. Thankful for
[47:32] these people. So glad, Lord, to be able
[47:34] to feel your presence and know that
[47:36] you're here among us today, God, to do
[47:38] the exceeding and abundantly above all
[47:40] that we could ever ask or think. Lord,
[47:43] without you, all of this is in vain.
[47:45] Lord, without you, I if I knew that you
[47:48] weren't here, I'd close this Bible and
[47:50] I'd walk out the door. There's no point
[47:52] in me being here. I We could have a nice
[47:54] normal discussion. We could do that
[47:56] around the We could go to the restaurant
[47:58] and do that, Lord. But we're here to
[48:00] meet with you, Lord. We're here. knowing
[48:02] that you are here, Father. And I
[48:04] wouldn't even open that Bible if I
[48:06] didn't know that you were here. And I'm
[48:07] so thankful, God, that you are. And that
[48:10] you, Lord, are the one to speak to us,
[48:12] to minister to us, for you, Lord, to
[48:14] take complete control over every fast of
[48:16] this service. Now, God, as we enter into
[48:19] this sacred time with the ministering of
[48:21] your word, expecting you to be with us,
[48:23] Lord. I listen the other day, and
[48:26] brother Brandham even exhorted the
[48:28] congregation. He's like, "You know what
[48:30] I'm waiting for, oh God. How any of us
[48:33] are defenseless. How any of us are
[48:35] useless without you, Lord."
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; He was waiting on you, Lord. We are
[48:39] always trusting you to be with us, Lord.
[48:42] So, may you just anoint speaker and
[48:44] hear, and accomplish in this service
[48:46] that that you'd send it forth for,
[48:48] whatever purpose, Lord, for these
[48:50] people, those who may be watching, those
[48:51] who may be may watch this service later,
[48:54] Lord. whatever it may be, we just commit
[48:56] it into your hands, Lord. May you get
[48:58] the glory and honor for all that we do
[49:00] here, Lord. And as we worship you today
[49:03] and learn of you through your word, may
[49:05] you speak to us from this word. We
[49:07] commit it to you, Lord. Now, we ask it
[49:09] in the precious, holy, and lovely name
[49:10] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[49:13] Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Chapter Ephesians chapter 4. We'll
[49:18] just read a couple of verses here
[49:20] beginning with the 11th verse as we are
[49:22] all again on the five-fold ministry. He
[49:25] gave some apostles and some prophets and
[49:27] some evangelists and some pastors and
[49:29] teachers for the perfecting of the
[49:31] saints for the work of the ministry for
[49:33] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[49:36] we all come in the unity of the of the
[49:38] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[49:40] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[49:44] of the stature of the fullness of
[49:46] Christ. that we henceforth be no more
[49:48] children tossed to and fro and carried
[49:50] about with every wind of doctrine which
[49:53] we went over fair fairly extensively
[49:56] last time and we will we will refer back
[49:59] on the doctrine in just a little bit. by
[50:01] the slight of men, cunning craftiness,
[50:03] whereby they lie in weight, excuse me,
[50:06] to deceive, but speaking the truth in
[50:09] love, may grow up into him in all things
[50:12] which is the head, even Christ, from
[50:14] whom the whole body fitly joined
[50:16] together, and compacted by that which
[50:19] every joint supplieth, according to the
[50:22] effectual working in the measure of
[50:25] every part, making increase of the body
[50:27] unto the edifying of itself in love. You
[50:30] can be seated if you'd like.
[50:35] Again, quite uh uh quite a powerful
[50:40] section of s of of of scripture that we
[50:43] have here to read and so much of it.
[50:45] Most of which we've kind of already
[50:47] touched on and went through, but I want
[50:49] to go back to second Timothy and read
[50:51] this just background. I probably won't
[50:52] spend but just a couple minutes on the
[50:54] backgrounding of where we left off from
[50:56] last week to try to bring it over, tie
[50:58] it into what we want to finish off with
[51:00] today. So, second Timothy chapter 2, uh
[51:05] we're going to go back to verse 14. We
[51:07] read this last time, but uh just to
[51:09] reiterate here, uh not to be quickly, I
[51:12] don't want to say quickly, but just to
[51:14] refresh our memories from this now. So 2
[51:17] Timothy 2:14 of these things put them in
[51:21] remembrance charging them before the
[51:23] Lord that they strive not about words to
[51:26] no profit but to the subverting. Again
[51:29] remember we said that is the destruction
[51:32] of the hearer. The subverting is the
[51:34] destruction of the hearer. So it's to
[51:36] bring them back in remembrance charging
[51:39] before the Lord that we strive not about
[51:41] with these words to no profit to the
[51:43] destruction of the hearer. study
[51:47] to show thyself approved unto God. Amen.
[51:51] That is your that is the that
[51:53] appointment. Amen. Or or if we would
[51:56] just go back to our adoption, your
[51:58] calling election. Amen. Study, show
[52:01] thyself approved unto God, a workman
[52:05] that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
[52:08] dividing the word of truth. Remember we
[52:10] talked rightly dividing last week,
[52:12] preaching that word correctly, teaching
[52:15] that word straight, bringing it direct
[52:18] and correct, not cutting corners, not
[52:20] trying to pamper, not trying to uh
[52:23] soothe over people's uh uh
[52:25] idiosyncrasies or or their spirits or
[52:28] whatever, but preaching that word truth,
[52:31] preaching that word straight, not
[52:33] holding back, not trying to be a a a
[52:38] a people pleaser. I guess if you will,
[52:40] but just preaching that word straight.
[52:42] Amen. Because if the if if it's a man of
[52:46] God preaching the word of God by God,
[52:48] the men and women, the sisters and
[52:50] brothers and sisters and the bride of
[52:52] Jesus Christ, they receive that word
[52:54] even if it rips the hide off of them.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; They take that word. They want to obey
[52:58] it. They want to live it. They want to
[52:59] become it. Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Because it's that pull. It's that call.
[53:03] It's that deep calling to the deep. is
[53:05] calling that witnesses to them that this
[53:08] is the truth and that we need to make
[53:10] ourselves right. We need to get
[53:11] ourselves ready. We need to make sure
[53:13] that we are in the position and when the
[53:15] Lord calls uh uh calls us home, we're
[53:18] ready to go be with him. Amen. And the
[53:21] only way to do that is to become more
[53:22] like the word to to become more like
[53:24] him.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; How do we do that? By faith. How does
[53:28] faith come? By hearing. Hearing what?
[53:30] The word of God. The pure unadulterated
[53:33] word of God. Amen. So to rightly divide,
[53:37] to be able to rightly divide, to teach
[53:39] that word not just uh directly but
[53:42] correctly the truth. Amen. Unaird,
[53:46] unadulterated,
[53:48] not mixed with any man's idea, opinion,
[53:50] not mixed with anything that's uh from
[53:54] someone's thoughts or opinions, but the
[53:56] true pure word of God. Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful that we know the
[54:00] message of the hour to be as such as
[54:03] well. Uh praise the Lord. So thank God
[54:05] we we received that word directly
[54:09] correctly right dividing the word but
[54:11] shun
[54:12] 16th verse now but shun profane and vain
[54:16] babblings for they will increase unto
[54:19] more ungodliness. Now what is he talking
[54:22] about again? Uh I I just want to
[54:24] reiterate this again. What is he talking
[54:26] about? What is Paul referring to?
[54:28] Profane and vain babblings. Profane and
[54:31] vain. Anything is profane and vain is
[54:34] something that's against the word.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; That's against God.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's against the truth.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Vain and profane is something that will
[54:42] injure people, that will hurt people,
[54:45] that will draw people away from God.
[54:47] Amen. That's why he goes on after this
[54:50] that increases to more ungodliness
[54:54] because all it takes is that little just
[54:56] that little bit which we'll probably
[54:59] we'll finish off with this in this
[55:01] message. But it just takes that little
[55:03] bit. It just takes that little crack in
[55:05] the door for the devil to get in. It
[55:08] only took one word in the Garden of
[55:09] Eden.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It only took one word in the
[55:12] Garden of Eden with everything else he
[55:14] said. 99% truth. It just took that one
[55:17] word of error. It just took that one
[55:19] word off of the truth that God had
[55:21] spoken to bring this world into into the
[55:24] catastrophe that it's in today. Now, it
[55:27] didn't start that way. Amen. The day
[55:29] after the fall, THEY DIDN'T START
[55:31] BUILDING A HOSPITAL. The day after the
[55:33] fall, you didn't hear ambulances and
[55:35] sirens and police going around. You
[55:37] didn't hear guns firing and people
[55:38] killing each other. all that. But but
[55:41] over a period of time, it just took that
[55:44] one drop to bring it to where it is
[55:46] today. And now it's grown to this place.
[55:48] And he's talking about in a person's
[55:50] life receiving shame uh uh uh profane
[55:54] and vain babblings does nothing but
[55:57] increase to more and more and MORE
[56:00] UNGODLINESS. OH, GOD'S okay with this.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; God will forgive me for that. you know,
[56:05] God will let this slide or I'll ask for
[56:07] you or whatever the attitude or the
[56:10] thought might be.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; But all that does is lead to one more
[56:14] and one more and one more and before you
[56:16] know it, you're as far from God is the
[56:19] rank center.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Brandham even
[56:22] said
[56:23] &gt;&gt; that all it takes is a service.
[56:27] You miss a service. He said a service.
[56:30] Amen. I know sometimes we all miss at
[56:32] some point for different reasons, but he
[56:35] missed a service. He said it's easier if
[56:38] you miss a service to miss the next,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And then it becomes in multiplied. It's
[56:43] like compound interest. It becomes twice
[56:45] as easy to to miss the next one. And
[56:47] then that much easier to miss the next
[56:50] one.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's it doing? It's just
[56:52] compounding to more and more
[56:55] ungodliness.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Then he begins to mention names
[57:02] and their word will eat as doth a canker
[57:05] of whom Himenius and Felitus which we
[57:08] mentioned last time he called names
[57:11] their word who concerning the truth have
[57:13] aired which means what they're bringing
[57:16] to the people is vain and profane. Why?
[57:18] Because it's not the pure word anymore.
[57:21] It's hybrid. It's added to a man's idea
[57:24] or opinion. They've aired saying that
[57:27] the resurrection is passed already and
[57:29] overthrow the faith of some of some
[57:32] overthrow the faith of some because
[57:34] remember especially this day the bride
[57:37] cannot be deceived.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; It would be so close that it would
[57:41] deceive the elect, but it can't deceive
[57:44] the elect. So, thank God it cannot
[57:46] deceive the elect. But it brings us to
[57:48] an understanding to make sure that we
[57:51] that we are uh that we are tight. We're
[57:53] secure on that uh on on the truth of
[57:56] God's word. That's why you don't take uh
[58:00] I I'll say it this way. Don't take
[58:02] brother Brandham's word for it.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was going to say my word, but
[58:07] I'll go even deeper. Don't take brother
[58:09] Brandham's word for it.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; You take what he said to the word.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God is in your life, God will
[58:15] reveal to you that what he said is from
[58:18] this word.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's scripture. Amen. He
[58:22] said, "We added this and this," but it
[58:26] didn't add to the word.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like when brother Random
[58:29] thought that when he was going to uh
[58:32] prepare to pre to preach the seals.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; At one time, brother Random said that
[58:36] that he thought the seals would be would
[58:38] be something that wasn't in the word
[58:41] that was just going to come and bring
[58:43] and be a a a great revelation of
[58:45] something uh to the people that wasn't
[58:48] in the scripture. And then the Lord
[58:50] showed him that can't BE BECAUSE THE
[58:53] BIBLE SAYS IF YOU ADD TO THIS word or
[58:57] take a word from this word, amen, the
[59:00] plagues will be added or your name will
[59:01] be taken out of the book of life.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; So it can't be anything that's not
[59:05] already here. What was it? It was word
[59:08] that was previously hidden.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; That it took a prophet. It took a
[59:14] rightly divining gift to bring that
[59:17] truth to the people. Amen. It wasn't
[59:20] adding to anything. It was taking what
[59:22] was already there that was hidden and
[59:26] brought a revelation of a truth of it.
[59:29] And if you look at that, you'll
[59:31] recognize it if any of you say, "Well,
[59:33] that's just his opinion." Well, look at
[59:35] that opinion. You know, I like uh I I I
[59:40] like one time brother Green said uh
[59:44] people say, "Well, that's just his
[59:45] opinion." And he's like, "Well, I'd
[59:47] rather take his opinion than anybody
[59:48] else's." [laughter]
[59:51] &gt;&gt; I I sat there and thought about that for
[59:54] a minute. I thought, you know, that's
[59:55] probably right. I think I'd probably
[59:57] take his opinion over anybody else's.
[59:59] So, I guess that's all right. But if you
[1:00:02] look at that, when it's brought and
[1:00:04] revealed by the word by Christ, it's
[1:00:07] going to follow in line with the
[1:00:09] scripture,
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; It's not going to go outside the
[1:00:12] scripture.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; It's going to fall within the confines
[1:00:15] of Genesis 1 to Revelation 22. And
[1:00:18] that's what you find when you recognize
[1:00:20] what brother Brandham brought was the
[1:00:22] pure word of God.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And any minister or anybody that tries
[1:00:26] to expound that word must fall in that
[1:00:29] same place. Yes.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what they say, it must be
[1:00:33] according to the word. That's why, like
[1:00:35] brother null said last week and I
[1:00:37] reiterated when I got up here, if it's
[1:00:39] something that hasn't been said,
[1:00:41] something that has been revealed,
[1:00:42] something brother Brandham didn't say or
[1:00:44] whatever timing of something, whatever,
[1:00:46] I always tell you in my opinion, I
[1:00:50] always make sure you understand this is
[1:00:52] my opinion. This is the way I feel about
[1:00:54] it. Can't find anywhere where brother
[1:00:56] Brandham expounds on it or in the
[1:00:57] scripture. But in my opinion, this is
[1:01:00] what I believe. But I base my opinion on
[1:01:03] the scripture.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I try to derive the way I feel about it
[1:01:07] from what the word has already said.
[1:01:09] Amen. Not just come off a cuff of
[1:01:11] something that I just want to be or
[1:01:14] something I want to say or whatever. Be
[1:01:16] important or anything like that. Who
[1:01:18] could I could care less about that.
[1:01:20] Amen. I'm about to be 60. being
[1:01:23] important is not significant in my life
[1:01:25] anymore. I don't care. I just want to be
[1:01:28] what he wants me to be.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; But make sure that you know that's that
[1:01:32] it is the word. It is the word. Amen.
[1:01:36] That's the number one thing is it it
[1:01:38] must be the pure unadulterated word
[1:01:40] because faith only comes by hearing the
[1:01:43] pure unadulterated word.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture does not
[1:01:48] contradict itself in any way.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no place in this Bible
[1:01:53] that it contradicts itself. You can look
[1:01:55] and look at it with a normal thinking or
[1:01:57] understanding and people would think
[1:01:59] with an education that it contradicts
[1:02:01] itself. But if you look at the whole the
[1:02:04] scripture as a whole by revelation,
[1:02:06] there's no contradiction.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; None at all. If there's anything in
[1:02:10] there that doesn't work right, you go
[1:02:12] back and you find out where you got off
[1:02:15] because there's nothing wrong with this.
[1:02:18] You must find out if something's not
[1:02:20] working according to what you feel,
[1:02:22] believe, teach, preach, whatever, you go
[1:02:24] back and find out where you got off.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Because this is not wrong.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be the the faults got
[1:02:31] to lie with us. Now, u
[1:02:35] with our backgrounding, let's go back.
[1:02:37] Let's go u over to Well, let's just stay
[1:02:40] in second Timothy.
[1:02:42] Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just stay in second Timothy
[1:02:46] on the in the fourth chapter
[1:02:50] as Paul spends a great deal of time in
[1:02:52] Timothy speaking about ministry and
[1:02:56] ministering. Amen. There's a a lot more
[1:02:59] of course in here that we won't go into,
[1:03:01] but that is important for us to know and
[1:03:04] see. Now, second Timothy chapter 4,
[1:03:07] let's look at beginning with the first
[1:03:09] verse.
[1:03:12] He says, "I charge ye therefore before
[1:03:14] God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
[1:03:17] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:03:18] appearing in his kingdom, preach the
[1:03:21] word." Praise the Lord. That is the
[1:03:23] greatest exclamation
[1:03:26] I know of.
[1:03:28] If a minister in Christ, that's the
[1:03:30] number one thing I know of, preach the
[1:03:32] word.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Any of these five-fold ministry would
[1:03:37] fall in the category of preaching the
[1:03:40] word. Right?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, a preacher is a
[1:03:42] preacher." Well, no. To me, every one of
[1:03:45] these five-fold ministry is a preacher.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Every one of them is a preacher in some
[1:03:49] way, shape, or form because a preacher
[1:03:51] is a carrier of the gospel, a carrier of
[1:03:53] the good news. And the good news comes
[1:03:56] through that five-fold ministry.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which then in turn comes through
[1:04:01] all of us, every one of us,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; because we are the good news,
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; the gospel. Preach the word. Now be
[1:04:08] instant in season, out of season,
[1:04:11] whatever the situation may be,
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; be ready. Amen. That's why we just read
[1:04:16] when when he told Timothy over here,
[1:04:18] "Study to show thyself approved." Amen.
[1:04:21] That you are God called. Amen. Now he's
[1:04:26] saying, "Preach, be instant, in season,
[1:04:28] out of season."
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Be ready. Whatever the situation,
[1:04:32] circumstances, be ready. Praise the
[1:04:35] Lord. for when the Lord might call.
[1:04:37] Reprove. Now, let's look at these few
[1:04:39] things for a minute. Preach the word.
[1:04:42] So, this is to a preacher, to a
[1:04:44] minister, to one of the fivefold. Be
[1:04:46] instant in season, out of season. That
[1:04:48] is uh that is paramount for any
[1:04:51] minister. Any of the five. We're talking
[1:04:53] about any and all of the five here. Now,
[1:04:55] [snorts]
[1:04:56] reprove. Amen. Minister is to reprove.
[1:05:00] What is reprove? Reprove is to tell
[1:05:03] one's fault and correction.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Reprove is to is to it sort of
[1:05:11] like we just said about rightly
[1:05:13] dividing. Amen. But tell one's fault and
[1:05:17] then the correction of that fault.
[1:05:20] [snorts] How does a person know that
[1:05:22] they're wrong unless they are told
[1:05:25] they're wrong?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:27] And how can a person correct themselves
[1:05:31] unless they know what the correction is?
[1:05:34] I had uh uh dinner with uh a guy that
[1:05:37] used to be on my team lives in El Paso.
[1:05:39] He can when he comes through and goes to
[1:05:41] Phoenix, he calls me, we go out and have
[1:05:43] a meal, lunch or dinner, whatever it is.
[1:05:45] And we were talking about it and um uh
[1:05:49] there was this one time we did a job and
[1:05:51] somebody came through and was saying
[1:05:53] that different things were wrong. And so
[1:05:56] he was he was telling me I was we were
[1:05:58] reliving this this been a couple years
[1:06:00] ago and he went to our team manager and
[1:06:04] he said, "Well, what did I do wrong?"
[1:06:08] See, I did it this way.
[1:06:12] I thought that was the right way to do
[1:06:13] it. It's wrong. Well, then tell me
[1:06:16] what's wrong.
[1:06:18] Show me what's wrong.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And then once YOU'VE SHOWED ME WHAT'S
[1:06:22] WRONG, TELL ME HOW TO DO IT RIGHT.
[1:06:24] RIGHT.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S THE BEST WAY that the next
[1:06:28] time you do it, it'll be done correctly.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; The next time I do it, I'll make sure
[1:06:33] and do it correctly.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So that there so that it's not wrong
[1:06:37] next time. And that's what it is in our
[1:06:40] lives to understand that we are to
[1:06:43] reprove, tell a fault, tell a wrong and
[1:06:47] a correction. Amen.
[1:06:49] You're not supposed to live this way.
[1:06:51] You're supposed to live this way. You're
[1:06:53] not supposed to do this, you're supposed
[1:06:54] to do that. Amen. Through the scripture
[1:06:57] to make sure understand, I want to be
[1:07:00] right. And anybody that's Holy Ghost
[1:07:03] filled in the word wants to be right.
[1:07:06] They want to be right with God.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people don't understand
[1:07:10] or even know what right is. And right is
[1:07:13] becoming uh uh used to be a line that
[1:07:17] was drawn in the sand that you didn't
[1:07:18] cross. But people have gotten so far
[1:07:21] away from that line anymore, it's a dot
[1:07:23] to them, if even a dot,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Because they're so far removed from it,
[1:07:27] they don't EVEN KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT
[1:07:28] ANYMORE. People just started saying,
[1:07:31] like even important figures that have
[1:07:33] influence over millions of people, just
[1:07:36] do what feels good to you.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Just do what feels right in your eyes.
[1:07:40] Well, in some PEOPLE'S EYES, DOING RIGHT
[1:07:43] means to take a gun and shoot somebody
[1:07:45] dead.
[1:07:47] THAT'S WHAT'S RIGHT TO THEM,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; They're righteous in doing this, but
[1:07:52] it's not right. I had a guy in the car
[1:07:54] one time. He's like, "Well, how do we
[1:07:56] know?" I said, "By the word." By the
[1:07:58] scripture.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Say, "I want to be pleasing to God." He
[1:08:02] said, "Well, how do I know what's
[1:08:03] pleasing to God?" READ YOUR BIBLE.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; IT TELLS YOU WHAT'S pleasing to God and
[1:08:08] what God hates. Know what it says. Let
[1:08:10] God reveal it to you and show you in
[1:08:12] there what he likes and doesn't like,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; right? and and and understand how to do
[1:08:18] it correctly the next time,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And live a life that's pleasing to the
[1:08:23] Lord.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's what a minister is supposed to
[1:08:26] do.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there may be facets of these
[1:08:32] because we're going to go through
[1:08:33] reprove, re rebuke, exhort. Um there may
[1:08:37] be parts of these that one of the
[1:08:39] ministry may lean on a little heavier
[1:08:41] than another. Amen. There may be a part
[1:08:44] of one or two parts of the five-fold
[1:08:46] ministry. I won't get into specifics,
[1:08:48] but they may may lean a little heavier
[1:08:51] on the reprove part than maybe another
[1:08:53] minister might.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Or another ministry might.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] But they're all to the
[1:08:58] place that [clears throat] they see
[1:09:00] wrong to call it out.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; To call to preach the truth.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. To tell one's fault to bring it
[1:09:08] correctly. Amen. Reprove. To rebuke.
[1:09:12] Now, it sounds like a word that we
[1:09:14] probably all know, but rebuke is to
[1:09:17] straightly charge. It's to hold a person
[1:09:19] accountable. It's to hold them
[1:09:21] responsible. Straightly charge them.
[1:09:24] Amen. That's why I think Paul said over
[1:09:26] here, bring to their remembrance. Remind
[1:09:29] them this is the way it is. This is what
[1:09:32] we do. This is how we act. This is how
[1:09:34] we live. Yes.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Remind them. Bring them to THE POINT.
[1:09:37] STRAIGHTLY CHARGE them and show them.
[1:09:40] Make them responsible for it. make them
[1:09:42] ha uh be held accountable
[1:09:45] because that's where you know that's
[1:09:46] when you know you belong is when you
[1:09:48] have an accountability.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; You don't belong to anything when
[1:09:52] there's no accountability.
[1:09:54] When there's nothing that you have to
[1:09:56] reflect on to look to to be responsible
[1:09:58] for there there's no there's no value in
[1:10:01] life unless you're responsible. There's
[1:10:04] no value in life unless there's some
[1:10:06] kind of that goes back again to the root
[1:10:08] of our whole subject here of adoption.
[1:10:11] Yes,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; there's no belonging. There's no feeling
[1:10:14] of of purpose. If you don't have some
[1:10:17] kind of responsibility,
[1:10:19] some kind of I guess as they would call
[1:10:21] it, skin in the game, there's no skin in
[1:10:24] the game, then most of the time people
[1:10:27] don't care.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um
[1:10:31] I I've heard people say horribly
[1:10:36] uh before and I it just makes me sick in
[1:10:40] my stomach say well you know this
[1:10:43] horrible thing happened to this family
[1:10:45] daughter's killed or something and
[1:10:46] they're like well that wasn't that
[1:10:48] that's not my family or that wasn't in
[1:10:50] my city or that wasn't so and so such
[1:10:52] so.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Where is the compassion?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Where's the empathy? Where's the love?
[1:10:59] Yes.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Where's the where is the the simple
[1:11:02] human decency to feel for someone else's
[1:11:05] infirmity like that
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; and and and to walk a mile in his
[1:11:10] moccasins?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. What if that were you?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Straightly charged. What if that was
[1:11:18] you? But a lot of times if it's if if
[1:11:21] there's no skin in the game, they don't
[1:11:22] care. It it doesn't bother them. It's
[1:11:26] not in their home. It's not in their
[1:11:27] family. it's not a part of their lives.
[1:11:29] Whatever it is, they don't care. And
[1:11:32] that's the loss of humanity that we've
[1:11:34] lost in this world today. The loss of
[1:11:36] humanity that people just don't seem to
[1:11:38] care as far as human decencies decency
[1:11:41] is concerned. That's why ministry is
[1:11:43] there supposed to be to straightly
[1:11:45] charge a person. Have responsibility.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Take responsibility. Amen. Charge them.
[1:11:53] This is as much your fault or as much as
[1:11:56] belongs to you as anybody else.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants the prize, but they
[1:12:01] don't want to pay the cost to get it,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. They want the reward, but they
[1:12:06] don't want what it takes to get to the
[1:12:08] reward,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; The fight, the struggle,
[1:12:12] the the heartache sometime to get to
[1:12:15] that place. People don't want to do
[1:12:16] that. But that's why I minister should
[1:12:18] straightly charge. Amen. to understand
[1:12:22] this is A BODY, A BRIDE BODY. We are the
[1:12:27] body of Jesus Christ, the mystical body
[1:12:29] of Jesus Christ. Internationally,
[1:12:32] there's
[1:12:34] multitudes of people. I was going to say
[1:12:37] millions, but I don't know if there is
[1:12:38] or not. Whatever the number is, but
[1:12:40] there's multitudes because I know that's
[1:12:42] what the Bible says. THERE'S MULTITUDES
[1:12:45] OF PEOPLE THAT BELONG in that body that
[1:12:48] are part of that family. And [snorts]
[1:12:49] I'm AS RESPONSIBLE TO it as anybody else
[1:12:52] is.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what position you
[1:12:55] hold, who you are, where you live, where
[1:12:56] you go to church. YOU ARE AS RESPONSIBLE
[1:12:59] TO THIS BRIDE BODY as anybody else is.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's ours to be responsible for my like
[1:13:09] it's like brother Bam even talked about
[1:13:11] in a church, just in a single church. He
[1:13:15] said one unconfessed sin can cause
[1:13:18] someone else from getting their healing.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; One unconfessed sin just in the whole
[1:13:23] body.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's the charge to all of us. Not the
[1:13:27] person that was sick. He didn't talk
[1:13:29] about the person that was sick. He said
[1:13:31] anybody in that church. That's
[1:13:34] responsibility of that church in that
[1:13:36] position. We're all responsible to all
[1:13:39] of it. We're all responsible. We're all
[1:13:41] responsible to every one of us. this
[1:13:43] body worldwide. We're all in much a part
[1:13:46] of it. If I'm holding this rapture back,
[1:13:49] Lord, help me
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; to get right. Lord, help me to do
[1:13:53] whatever I need to do. Go talk to
[1:13:54] whoever need to talk to, bring in
[1:13:56] whoever I need to bring in. If I'm doing
[1:13:58] something to hold IT UP, LORD, HELP ME.
[1:14:00] I WANT TO get it right.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Because I am responsible.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. It could be my fault that these
[1:14:08] people over in China are going through
[1:14:10] what they're or uh
[1:14:13] oh, where is it? They're getting
[1:14:15] Nigeria. Christians are just getting
[1:14:17] slaughtered like it's the dark ages all
[1:14:19] over again,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Just burned and and and and
[1:14:24] every manner of of of murder killings
[1:14:27] that you can think of these people. And
[1:14:29] now not Somalia, I think even different
[1:14:31] places. Christians. Christians.
[1:14:34] I I see and they're bright. But
[1:14:36] Christians, which we're part of,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; we are all a part of this Christendom
[1:14:41] that we're all a part of this Christians
[1:14:44] being slaughtered and murdered,
[1:14:46] persecuted.
[1:14:48] THAT'S A THAT'S MY BROTHER AND SISTER.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; We cannot turn a blow to it. Amen. We
[1:14:56] need to be responsible.
[1:14:58] Amen. There's nothing we can do but what
[1:15:00] else God has given us. Go down face
[1:15:04] first and pray for those people.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Pray for this body. Pray for those
[1:15:08] Christians. Pray for those people. Amen.
[1:15:11] Because we're all a part of the same
[1:15:12] family of God. Amen. In one way, shape,
[1:15:16] or form. We're all a part of it. And
[1:15:18] that's the rebuke. Rebuke to charge.
[1:15:22] Straightly charge.
[1:15:25] make sure that we are in the place that
[1:15:27] we're supposed to be with the Lord.
[1:15:29] Exhort. Now, a lot of people probably
[1:15:31] like that. Exhort. To teach, to
[1:15:35] strengthen, and encourage. To teach, to
[1:15:40] strengthen, and encourage goes along
[1:15:42] with the uh the uh ma the Ephesians 4
[1:15:46] that we read. Amen. the things that the
[1:15:50] perfecting of the saints to the edifying
[1:15:52] to the building up of the body of Christ
[1:15:55] to exhort. Amen. There's a lot of
[1:15:58] exhortion that goes on exertion.
[1:16:00] Exhortion that goes on in a ministry in
[1:16:03] a in a in a preaching. If a man is
[1:16:06] called of God and he was under the
[1:16:08] operation influence of the Holy Spirit,
[1:16:10] God's got something to say to us.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; There's a there's an appointed time.
[1:16:15] There's an appointed place. God's got a
[1:16:18] reason and a purpose. He wants to talk
[1:16:20] to us. He wants to say something. Amen.
[1:16:22] The children of Israel one time, they
[1:16:24] said, "Won't don't don't let Moses speak
[1:16:26] to us anymore. We want to hear direct
[1:16:28] from God." They heard from God one time
[1:16:30] and they fell on their face said, "NO
[1:16:31] MORE. NO, NO. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM
[1:16:33] GOD. PLEASE, MOSES, WE JUST YOU speak
[1:16:36] for God. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR HIM
[1:16:37] ANYMORE."
[1:16:39] [laughter]
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Then Mo then God started using
[1:16:42] Moses again. They learned their lesson
[1:16:45] pretty quick. I want to hear. Well, if
[1:16:48] God's doing that, he's got a purpose.
[1:16:50] He's got a reason. God wants to say
[1:16:53] something. God wants to tell us
[1:16:54] something. Amen. So, it's an exhortion,
[1:16:57] a teaching to bring us all to that
[1:17:00] place, amen, of understanding that the
[1:17:03] Lord would speak to us. Exhort, exhort
[1:17:05] with all longsuffering and doctrine.
[1:17:08] Longsuffering is endurance and patience.
[1:17:11] Longsuffering. We know as our God, our
[1:17:13] Lord is very much long-suffering. Amen.
[1:17:16] With the patience that he displays to
[1:17:18] the humanity as a whole, if you will,
[1:17:22] the patience that God is I I think that
[1:17:24] patience that that cup of iniquity is
[1:17:27] like one drop from overflowing at this
[1:17:30] point. But longsuffering. Amen.
[1:17:33] Patience. Uh endure with patience. Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Because it takes time to bring to that
[1:17:41] place. And doctrine. And doctrine. to
[1:17:45] make sure we follow the truth of the
[1:17:48] doctrine. Doctrine is that that was
[1:17:50] correctly spoken the the the correctly
[1:17:53] spoken I'll just say it this way. The
[1:17:55] correctly spoken word of God to his
[1:17:58] people to his children that that has
[1:18:00] been said that that has been brought is
[1:18:03] doctrine. We receive it as doctrine
[1:18:06] correct doctrine. Amen. Because uh
[1:18:09] that's why we that's why we also have
[1:18:11] what we call a cood book conduct order
[1:18:13] doctrine. Right.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we have in this message. Yes.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; That we believe is the truth that come
[1:18:18] from the prophet that we have for this
[1:18:20] day.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And some of what his opinions are.
[1:18:26] But the opinions derived from the
[1:18:28] scripture,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham had. People would
[1:18:31] ask him questions of questions of
[1:18:34] opinion. Amen. I got one here I'm going
[1:18:36] to read just a minute. Uh it's it's
[1:18:39] basically a question of opinion. Amen.
[1:18:42] You can drive it from the scripture but
[1:18:44] it's just opinion
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's what we believe. But
[1:18:48] now doctrine of some issue the Catholic
[1:18:50] Church they pride themselves in their
[1:18:53] doctrine. Where does their doctrine
[1:18:55] derive from? From the pope. Amen. They
[1:18:58] take very little of the scripture. They
[1:19:00] don't that they they they follow it as a
[1:19:03] guideline if you will but it's not
[1:19:06] absolute to them. The pope is absolute.
[1:19:09] If the pope says something against what
[1:19:11] this word says, then they believe him
[1:19:13] instead of this because he's the viker.
[1:19:16] He's here in place of Christ. That's
[1:19:19] what vicarious filidi in place of
[1:19:21] Christ. He's here in place of uh he's
[1:19:24] he's supposedly the anointed here in
[1:19:27] place of Christ. So if he says something
[1:19:29] contrary to this word, they believe him.
[1:19:31] And that is their doctrine,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; They believe that. Amen. Doctrine is
[1:19:36] that. That's but now we're looking at
[1:19:38] not just doctrine but correct doctrine.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Right doctrine that that's been brought
[1:19:47] revealed through the Holy Spirit through
[1:19:49] God through individual by God through
[1:19:51] individual. God is bringing that truth
[1:19:54] and correct doctrine.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's important. A lot of people
[1:19:57] say, "Well, they don't want doctrine."
[1:19:59] Well, no. We got to have doctrine.
[1:20:01] Doctrine is important to us. Amen. It's
[1:20:03] the word. the foundation of what we
[1:20:05] believe, what we hold true and dear.
[1:20:07] This word that's been preached is
[1:20:10] doctrine. Amen. But we do it with the
[1:20:13] correctness of what the scripture says.
[1:20:15] We don't take somebody else's word for
[1:20:17] it. That's why I told you. Amen. They'll
[1:20:19] take the pope's word. I'm telling you,
[1:20:21] don't take brother Bam's word. Don't
[1:20:23] take my word. Don't take Perry Green's
[1:20:25] word. Don't take Eddie Biscos's word.
[1:20:28] Don't take Donnie Reagan's word. Don't
[1:20:30] take any MAN'S WORD. TAKE WHAT GOD SAID.
[1:20:33] AMEN.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; And then you compare. Now, if that man
[1:20:37] is speaking what God said, praise the
[1:20:39] Lord. We all celebrate in that. We all
[1:20:41] worship in that. And I believe Brother
[1:20:43] Brandham did. Fact, I know he did. It's
[1:20:46] not even a belief to me anymore. It's a
[1:20:48] know. I know he did. Amen. I try my best
[1:20:53] to do the same. The Lord, by the help of
[1:20:55] the Holy Spirit, I try my best to do the
[1:20:57] same. I believe these other pe other
[1:20:59] brothers as well. It wasn't a slight on
[1:21:01] brother Green. I believe he did. Amen.
[1:21:04] Eddie Biscll or D, I put those names out
[1:21:06] there. I believe they do. I believe them
[1:21:08] to be men of God.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And that's that's the way it's supposed
[1:21:12] to be. But we don't just take their
[1:21:14] word. We study for ourselves and make
[1:21:17] sure
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; that that doctrine, what has been spoke
[1:21:20] is correct. It is right. It is what God
[1:21:23] has told us. Now, let's continue on with
[1:21:25] this scripture reading because I
[1:21:27] [snorts] got one other place uh well,
[1:21:29] maybe two other places before we close.
[1:21:33] Amen. [clears throat]
[1:21:36] So we'll read it. Preach the word. Be
[1:21:38] innocent in season, out of season,
[1:21:40] reprove,
[1:21:42] rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering
[1:21:45] and doctrine.
[1:21:47] For the time will come when when they
[1:21:50] will not endure sound doctrine, correct
[1:21:54] doctrine, true doctrine. Amen. What time
[1:21:58] is that? Right now.
[1:22:01] today.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not saying it started today. I
[1:22:04] think it started years ago,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; but it's here now to where they people
[1:22:10] come to a place where they will not
[1:22:12] endure sound doctrine. But after their
[1:22:15] own loss, that means doing what they
[1:22:18] want to do. Amen. It doesn't mean
[1:22:20] necessarily a a a an affair, a man or
[1:22:24] woman or something. No, it doesn't have
[1:22:25] to be that. It's just a lustful act,
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; right? It's just a lustful idea. It's
[1:22:30] it's lustful is something that is
[1:22:32] pleasing to your flesh,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what lustful is. Something
[1:22:36] that's just pleasing to your flesh.
[1:22:38] People just want to do whatever they
[1:22:40] think is right.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; They want to do whatever they think
[1:22:42] feels good.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever in their opinion might be
[1:22:46] something that's it's it's okay to do.
[1:22:48] And in a lot of times nowadays in
[1:22:50] people's eyes, almost anything is okay,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; right? But that's what lust after their
[1:22:57] own lust shall he themselves teachers
[1:23:00] having itching ears because you can find
[1:23:02] a minister out there anywhere that'll
[1:23:04] condone whatever conduct you want to
[1:23:06] that you want to give live be. Amen.
[1:23:11] There's churches I' I've seen one down
[1:23:13] the street. I mean there there's ones
[1:23:16] that they don't care if you think you're
[1:23:18] man or woman. They don't care if you're
[1:23:20] uh homosexual. They don't care if you're
[1:23:22] uh whatever situation. They don't care.
[1:23:26] Every anything and everything's okay.
[1:23:28] You find you'll find I think I told
[1:23:30] y'all this story one time. I'll tell it
[1:23:32] real quick. When I was uh in Charlotte
[1:23:34] was working purchasing. Uh I was under
[1:23:37] the pering manager at the time and we
[1:23:39] had salesman call on us and the guy that
[1:23:41] considered himself a Christian called
[1:23:43] and he was always talking to Roy and
[1:23:44] tell him about God and you know and God
[1:23:47] Roy was he was he was like the the nom
[1:23:50] the the quintessential nominal person.
[1:23:53] uh he went to church Christmas and
[1:23:55] Easter probably at that and you know uh
[1:23:58] he was he would always try to tell him
[1:24:00] he said well you go to church he's you
[1:24:03] know he didn't go to church really that
[1:24:04] I knew of he didn't belong to one I
[1:24:07] think he went maybe like say Christmas
[1:24:08] and Easter and he said but and
[1:24:11] [clears throat] this man who is a
[1:24:12] Christian told him said church is like a
[1:24:16] glove you just go until you find one
[1:24:18] that fits
[1:24:19] I'm like what a subtle lie the devil
[1:24:22] that is
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I sat cuz I'm sitting across the hall
[1:24:25] from in my office doing my work and I'm
[1:24:27] listening to this and it piqus my
[1:24:29] attention because he's talking about God
[1:24:31] of course and I'm listening and said and
[1:24:34] when he says that I I I
[1:24:37] raise up I remember it vividly. I raise
[1:24:39] up and I'm thinking my what a lie that
[1:24:41] is
[1:24:44] you just go try to find a church that
[1:24:46] that fits you.
[1:24:48] That's not the purpose of being a
[1:24:49] Christian. Purpose of being a Christian
[1:24:51] is so that you are molded to there's
[1:24:53] only one glove and that's God's glove.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care what church wear, who
[1:24:58] preacher, there's only one glove. It's
[1:25:00] God's glove. And we are to mold
[1:25:02] ourselves. We are supposed to be molded
[1:25:04] to fit his glove.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Period. No chat, church, whatever
[1:25:08] denomination. I don't care what it is.
[1:25:10] We're not to we're not to try to find a
[1:25:12] glove that fits us. No, we're supposed
[1:25:14] to change our lives and the way we live
[1:25:17] and who we are to fit his word.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that we're
[1:25:22] acceptable to God.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; But that's what it's trying to say.
[1:25:27] These people have lust. So they go
[1:25:29] trying to find a preacher and find a
[1:25:30] preacher that agrees with the way they
[1:25:32] live and what they do and how they are
[1:25:33] and everything and said, "It's okay.
[1:25:35] You're fine. You're good." You know,
[1:25:37] that's going to be a lot of help, a lot
[1:25:39] of accountability on the day of
[1:25:41] judgment, friend. Especially for people
[1:25:43] who think they're holding these higher
[1:25:44] positions, such as a pastor in a church
[1:25:48] that tells these people they're okay and
[1:25:51] say, "We love you. Live as you are." Oh,
[1:25:54] what that that's the fastest way to hell
[1:25:56] that I know of.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. To just be who you are. Live just
[1:26:02] live how you are. That's the That's the
[1:26:03] quickest way to go to hell that I know
[1:26:05] of.
[1:26:07] You must change. You must let your life
[1:26:10] reflect Jesus Christ. You must become
[1:26:12] like this word. You must let the Holy
[1:26:14] Spirit come and mold you and make you
[1:26:17] and shape you into his image.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will accept you when he can
[1:26:22] see his reflection in the mirror.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; When he looks at you.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; When he looks at you, he wants to see
[1:26:28] his own reflection. Yes.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; That reflection is the word.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And until we come to the place that
[1:26:34] we're reflection of that, then we've
[1:26:36] fallen short. Amen. It's not finding,
[1:26:39] but you'll find it. They want to endure
[1:26:42] sound doctrine. So what do they do? They
[1:26:43] go find some place because they have
[1:26:45] lustes and they find some place teacher
[1:26:47] having itch and ears that'll just say
[1:26:48] whatever they want them to hear and
[1:26:50] you'll be okay and just keep on going
[1:26:51] with life. All is well. Amen. Would you
[1:26:54] like some company? Uh would you like
[1:26:56] some company drinking that fifth of
[1:26:57] whiskey? Would you like some company
[1:26:59] drinking that smoking that cigarette?
[1:27:01] Would you I mean you know that's just
[1:27:04] what about what it's become. It's all
[1:27:06] good. Well I don't live that way but
[1:27:08] it's okay if they do. No, it's not
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; No, not to God it's not. I mean, you're
[1:27:13] a free moral agent. You can live how you
[1:27:14] want, but not to God.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; To God, it's not all right. They have
[1:27:20] teachers having itchy ear. And they
[1:27:22] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:27:24] truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
[1:27:27] That's that vain and profane babblings
[1:27:30] that he was talking about over in the
[1:27:32] second chapter. [snorts] But watch thou
[1:27:34] in all things.
[1:27:36] Endure afflictions.
[1:27:38] do the work of an evangelist. Remember
[1:27:40] what God spoke to brother Brandham about
[1:27:42] that. I heard brother Brandham reiterate
[1:27:43] that the other day when God told him he
[1:27:46] said he said now he didn't tell me I was
[1:27:48] an evangelist. Notice brother Brandham
[1:27:50] said he didn't say I was an evangelist.
[1:27:53] He just told me to do the work of an
[1:27:55] evangelist. Amen. Make full proof of
[1:27:58] that. And that'll help in a minute when
[1:27:59] I read this quote. Make full proof of
[1:28:01] thy ministry for I am now ready to be
[1:28:04] offered and the time of my departure is
[1:28:06] at hand. I have fought a good fight. I
[1:28:08] have finished my course. I have kept the
[1:28:10] faith. Praise the Lord. What a wonderful
[1:28:12] saying that any of us should be able to
[1:28:16] say. Any of us should by the grace of
[1:28:18] God be able to say. Let me read this
[1:28:20] [snorts]
[1:28:22] questions and answers to get to this. As
[1:28:24] I've mentioned, an opinion
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; that people are asking.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; How does one know? I think I've read
[1:28:32] this the other day, but I didn't read
[1:28:34] the whole thing. How does one know their
[1:28:36] rightful position in the body of Christ?
[1:28:38] How does one know? Brother Ram said
[1:28:40] that's a very good one. How does that'd
[1:28:42] be kind of a question amongst many of us
[1:28:44] here tonight. How do you rightfully
[1:28:46] know? Now I'm presuming this brother
[1:28:47] wants to know what position uh part in
[1:28:50] Christ that they play. Now for instance,
[1:28:53] and it's it's brother Brown is giving
[1:28:55] his opinion based on scripture.
[1:28:59] For instance, I'd say like this,
[1:29:00] brother, to give you the best answer I
[1:29:02] know your position. Christ is revealed
[1:29:04] to you by the Holy Spirit. And [snorts]
[1:29:06] then if you want to know whether it's
[1:29:08] the Holy Spirit or not, find out whether
[1:29:10] he blesses what you're doing or not. And
[1:29:12] if he blesses it, then that's him.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Like someone said to me
[1:29:18] not long ago said, "Lord called me to
[1:29:20] preach." I said, "Well, then preach."
[1:29:23] I really think it's so uh Satan if he
[1:29:26] can just get somebody to act like that
[1:29:28] and then deceive them. That's just what
[1:29:30] he wants to do. Then the world the whole
[1:29:33] uh the whole world points their finger
[1:29:35] right there. Somebody thinks that they
[1:29:37] have a a gift of speaking in tongues,
[1:29:39] interpretation, the gift of divine
[1:29:41] healing and some things like this.
[1:29:43] Sometimes they're mistaken in those
[1:29:45] things. See, sometimes they think they
[1:29:47] haven't gotten it when they do have it.
[1:29:49] It's so very tricky. He said, [snorts]
[1:29:52] "So always do this, brethren. Whether
[1:29:54] you feel that you're supposed to do a
[1:29:56] thing, first find out if it's scriptural
[1:29:58] or not for you to do it. If it is in the
[1:30:01] scripture, not just wrote in one place,
[1:30:03] but I mean completely scriptural, which
[1:30:06] is a good way of putting it. If it's
[1:30:07] scriptural, not just scripture, but
[1:30:10] scriptural, a scripture could just be
[1:30:12] one scripture,
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Scriptural means it runs through
[1:30:16] the whole the whole Bible." Amen. He
[1:30:19] said, "Not just a scripture, but is it
[1:30:22] scriptural?"
[1:30:24] Amen. Now, uh not just wrote in one
[1:30:26] place.
[1:30:28] If you'd be an evangelist, pastor,
[1:30:30] teacher, prophet, whatever that God has
[1:30:32] called you, if you had the gift of
[1:30:34] tongues, interpretation, any of these
[1:30:36] nine spiritual gifts in the church, the
[1:30:38] four spiritual offices of the church,
[1:30:41] any position, first see if it's God
[1:30:44] called. And usually way I watch for
[1:30:47] myself. See this is me. I watch how he
[1:30:49] even says this is me. Uh I watch the
[1:30:52] nature of a person. See what kind of a
[1:30:54] gift that they're professing. And God
[1:30:56] and see God will work with his creature
[1:30:59] the way he's made him. And he'll make a
[1:31:02] creature if you see him uh real flighty
[1:31:05] going on. I think I may have paraphrased
[1:31:08] this the other day. He said, "The Lord
[1:31:09] called me to be such and such to be a
[1:31:11] pastor." Now a pastor can't be a flighty
[1:31:14] person.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; A pastor's solid sound. See, God called
[1:31:18] me to be a teacher. Watch him how he
[1:31:20] interprets the word. He gets things all
[1:31:22] mixed up and everything. Then you can
[1:31:24] tell not a teacher. Amen. See, but then
[1:31:28] the thing you do your position usually
[1:31:30] don't whether you can or cannot do it.
[1:31:32] Now, when God called me, he said to be
[1:31:36] an evangelist, he said, "I wanted to be
[1:31:38] a pastor." And I thought staying at home
[1:31:41] here would be just fine. And the Lord
[1:31:43] called me. And finally, all the people
[1:31:45] got together. There's not a one of them
[1:31:47] left here tonight. Um, they cry went on
[1:31:50] uh 1717 Spring Street. The lady, Miss
[1:31:53] Hawkins, over there uh met me crying
[1:31:57] [clears throat] during depression. goes
[1:31:58] on. He says, "And I'll allowance my
[1:32:00] children at the table if you'll only
[1:32:02] build a tabernacle." Now, he's this lady
[1:32:06] imploring Brother Brandham, be a pastor.
[1:32:08] Build a church. Have a church for us to
[1:32:10] go to. My children need help. We need to
[1:32:12] go to church. Have a church. Brother
[1:32:14] Brandham, if you'd just be a pastor,
[1:32:15] build a church. See, the call of other
[1:32:18] people asking things that basically was
[1:32:21] really against the will of God. But from
[1:32:24] a sincere heart, she sincerely wanted
[1:32:27] what she wanted. Amen. For her children
[1:32:29] to be in church, have a good church to
[1:32:31] go to. She said, "I'll allowance my
[1:32:32] children a table if you'll just only
[1:32:34] build a tabernacle." He said, "My
[1:32:37] calling was an evangelist. The Lord
[1:32:38] laying right here the cornerstone. If I
[1:32:41] could burst that in tonight, you'll uh
[1:32:43] see a fly leaf off my Bible where he
[1:32:45] told me to be an evangelist." See, and I
[1:32:47] wasn't a successful pastor. never would
[1:32:50] be because I haven't got the patience
[1:32:53] and what it takes to be a pastor. See,
[1:32:56] so therefore, if I tried to be a pastor,
[1:32:58] I would just be as far out as a pastor
[1:33:02] is trying to be an evangelist.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Be what God called you.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; The fruits will manifest themselves.
[1:33:12] Brother Brandham felt like he would just
[1:33:15] be a pastor, that he would just um stay
[1:33:19] at home and be be at home and be there
[1:33:21] and have his church and go to church and
[1:33:24] uh help the people around the
[1:33:25] neighborhood and stuff and just and just
[1:33:27] be a pastor. But that's not what God
[1:33:28] called him. Called and said, "Do the
[1:33:30] work of an evangelist." Again, he wasn't
[1:33:33] an evangelist,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; But he did the work of an evangelist. He
[1:33:37] wasn't a pastor, but he did the work of
[1:33:40] a pastor, did he not?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, what what were these private
[1:33:44] interviews about it? Not being a pastor.
[1:33:47] Uh he wasn't a teacher, but did he
[1:33:49] teach?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; absolutely.
[1:33:52] Even we know he was a prophet. So, I
[1:33:54] mean, and we know he was a missionary.
[1:33:57] We know uh the overseas and all. So, to
[1:34:01] me, this word prophet
[1:34:04] filled every position.
[1:34:06] I I I believe he was the fulfillment of
[1:34:08] each one of the positions that was given
[1:34:10] to him based at the time and the need.
[1:34:13] Amen. Under the circumstance. That's my
[1:34:16] opinion. Brother Graham never says that.
[1:34:18] Amen. But you look at the things I just
[1:34:20] offered you as examples as evidence to
[1:34:23] why I draw that conclusion.
[1:34:26] Maybe we come to our the same
[1:34:28] conclusion. 1 Timothy 4. Now, let's get
[1:34:31] to this couple more times on this
[1:34:33] doctrine. We'll close.
[1:34:36] Um, first Timothy,
[1:34:39] 1 Timothy 4, 1 Timothy 4, not second
[1:34:43] Timothy this time. 1 Timothy 4. Now the
[1:34:45] spirit speaketh expressedly that in the
[1:34:48] latter times, that is today.
[1:34:52] Some shall depart from the faith. We
[1:34:54] just read about that over in second
[1:34:56] Timothy. Giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:35:00] and what kind of doctrines? Of devils.
[1:35:04] doctrines of devils.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. These are doctrines that did not
[1:35:09] ar derive from the scripture. They
[1:35:11] derived from a man
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; or or humanity, if you will. Somebody
[1:35:18] derived this this doctrine,
[1:35:21] built churches on them. Amen. Such as
[1:35:24] the Catholic Church, built on these
[1:35:27] doctrines. Amen. But they're doctrines
[1:35:30] of devils because they're not according
[1:35:32] to the scripture.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; They must be according to the word.
[1:35:36] Amen. These doctrines of devils, these
[1:35:39] are these winds of doctrine
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; that Ephesians 4, we wrote many read
[1:35:45] many times. Ephesians 4 teaches us that
[1:35:48] we be not children tossed to and fro
[1:35:49] with every wind of doctrine. What do we
[1:35:53] talk about that wind being? Disturbance.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Disturbance. doctrines of devils.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; See, it it's it's beautiful how a
[1:36:03] minister, you can take brother
[1:36:04] Brandham's messages and look, Brother
[1:36:07] Bam can have a message titled the same
[1:36:09] thing on three different tapes and you
[1:36:10] listen to it and and you can hear a
[1:36:13] couple of scriptures that was the same,
[1:36:15] but a lot of the message is different.
[1:36:17] It'll vary a little bit, actually a
[1:36:20] great deal in a lot of cases because
[1:36:22] it's trying to get to these points. You
[1:36:24] bring it all together to find this point
[1:36:26] that he's trying to make. How many
[1:36:28] places here? I've only got a few that he
[1:36:30] goes into and talks about these these
[1:36:33] evil doctrines, these doctrines of
[1:36:36] devils, these winds of doctrine. That's
[1:36:38] what the ministering a pure true
[1:36:41] ministering of the word, the pure and
[1:36:43] adulterated word will bring a a faith to
[1:36:46] a people that won't wander around to
[1:36:49] every wind of doctrine.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Every wind of doctrines of devils. Yes,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; they won't worry about going to find
[1:36:56] somebody with a teacher having itching
[1:36:58] ears that'll just be a people pleaser.
[1:37:01] Someone that'll rightly divide the word
[1:37:03] and preach the truth, repro, rebuke,
[1:37:05] reprove with, exhort with all
[1:37:07] longsuffering. See?
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:10] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:37:13] doctrines of devils, speaking lies in
[1:37:17] hypocrisy,
[1:37:19] having their conscience seared with a
[1:37:22] hot iron.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; My friend, if we don't have if we don't
[1:37:27] have a humanity today whose conscience
[1:37:31] is seared,
[1:37:33] numbed,
[1:37:34] dead, I don't know what is
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Seared with a hot arm. You know, you
[1:37:39] sear something with a hot iron, it
[1:37:40] becomes numb. You kill the you sear sear
[1:37:43] the end of your finger, it comes numb.
[1:37:46] You'll kill you'll kill the nerve ends
[1:37:47] in that finger, you won't be able to
[1:37:48] feel anymore.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's what people have gotten. They
[1:37:51] don't have any feeling anymore.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Seared with a hot iron to where they
[1:37:55] can't there's no feeling in their
[1:37:57] conscience. He says their conscience in
[1:38:01] their very soul in the place of reason.
[1:38:04] THERE'S NO CONSCIENCE. IT'S SEARED WITH
[1:38:06] A HOT IRON,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? No feeling. There's nothing there
[1:38:10] because there's nothing. It's it's all
[1:38:12] numb. Poor, miserable, blind, wretched,
[1:38:14] naked, and what? Don't even know it.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Knowest thou not that you're poor,
[1:38:21] miserable, blind, wretched, know this le
[1:38:23] to see us. Saints, God, it's a miracle
[1:38:26] that anybody comes out of this lessa. I
[1:38:29] thank God that I'm one of them.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's horrible, horrible time.
[1:38:35] Conscience here with a hot iron. One
[1:38:36] more. We're going to close. Matthew 16.
[1:38:42] St. Matthew chapter 16.
[1:38:46] Read on this again. Verse six. And Jesus
[1:38:49] said unto them, "Take heed and beware of
[1:38:51] the leaven of the Pharisees and
[1:38:54] Sadducees." Now again, you know what
[1:38:56] leaven is? Levan is something like that
[1:38:59] helps with the dough to rise and stuff.
[1:39:01] Sort of like yeast. Uh but all it takes
[1:39:06] the the thing of the leaven is remember
[1:39:08] the scripture says a little leaven
[1:39:10] leavenveneth the whole lump right
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; right so it doesn't take an entire uh
[1:39:15] gallon of leaven to ruin
[1:39:19] of course I say ruin because
[1:39:23] taught them against the leaven uh to to
[1:39:26] ruin
[1:39:28] something all it takes is a drop all it
[1:39:31] takes is just a smidge
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; and that little bit remember will grow
[1:39:35] unto godliness and ungodliness and lead
[1:39:37] unto more ungodliness lead unto more
[1:39:39] ungodliness.
[1:39:41] That little bit of leaven. Amen. Now
[1:39:43] he's he's telling them beware of the
[1:39:47] leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; And they reasoned among themselves
[1:39:53] saying is it is because we have taken no
[1:39:55] bread which when Jesus perceived he said
[1:39:58] unto them oh ye of little faith why
[1:40:00] reason ye among yourselves because ye
[1:40:02] have no bread brought no bread? Do you
[1:40:04] not understand? Neither remember the
[1:40:06] five loaves, the 5,000, and how many
[1:40:08] baskets he took up, neither the seven
[1:40:10] loaves of the 4,000, how many baskets he
[1:40:13] took up? You worried about bread? You
[1:40:16] worried you didn't bring any bread?
[1:40:17] You've already seen me multiply bread
[1:40:19] unto thousands and thousands of people.
[1:40:24] How is it that How is it that ye do not
[1:40:27] understand that I spake it not to you
[1:40:30] concerning bread that ye should beware
[1:40:32] of the leavenven of the Pharisees and of
[1:40:34] the Sadducees?
[1:40:36] Then understood they how that he bade
[1:40:39] them not beware of the leavenven of
[1:40:41] bread, but of the doctrine,
[1:40:44] the doctrine of the Pharisees and the
[1:40:47] Sadducees.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; What is the beware of the doctrine?
[1:40:52] the doctrine itself. Yes.
[1:40:55] But in but in comparing it to leaven,
[1:40:59] he compared it to levan as the
[1:41:01] understanding back in the garden of Eden
[1:41:04] where it doesn't take a whole bushel of
[1:41:06] leaven just a drop.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; All it takes is for you just to
[1:41:11] disbelieve on one point.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Compromise on a scripture.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Disbelieve a scripture. common connives
[1:41:20] something else in your mind of what that
[1:41:22] scripture quote unquote means rather
[1:41:26] than what it says.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] Then we get to the place that that
[1:41:31] leaven, what is it? Grows unto more and
[1:41:33] to more unrighteousness. It grows unto
[1:41:35] more and more godliness.
[1:41:39] Amen. A little levan. That's why Jesus
[1:41:43] warned them to beware of that leaven.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take much. you just believe
[1:41:49] this little bit here and this little bit
[1:41:51] here. I know brother Ram talked about,
[1:41:53] you know, if you can't if you can't get
[1:41:54] a go to a church, go to go to a church.
[1:41:58] If you can't get a whole loaf, just get
[1:41:59] a slice or something like that.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; But you got But he also told us that
[1:42:03] those denominations are the mark of the
[1:42:05] beast. And don't don't join yourself up
[1:42:07] to it, too. Right.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beware what? Of the doctrine.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Beware of the leaven. It doesn't take
[1:42:16] much to bring impurity.
[1:42:18] Doesn't take much leaven in a bread to
[1:42:21] to leaven the whole lump.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't take much doctrine to believe to
[1:42:27] go off and build one thing to the next
[1:42:30] and one thing to the next. Amen. Every
[1:42:34] wind of doctrine,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; every doctrine of devils.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's so important that
[1:42:41] the minister be a God- called man to be
[1:42:45] able to rightly divide that word so that
[1:42:48] that word comes forth in the purity and
[1:42:50] the rightness the righteousness truth
[1:42:54] that it is to bring faith to a people.
[1:42:57] Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; To bring rap more so just in even faith
[1:43:00] rapturing faith to a people in this day.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need more of that to bring
[1:43:08] rapturing faith. That's why I believe
[1:43:10] there had to be this time that this
[1:43:12] prophet came to bring this message to
[1:43:16] unveil those seals and to church ages.
[1:43:18] All that the word that we have that were
[1:43:20] at our disposal
[1:43:22] that that God brought through a prophet.
[1:43:25] All of that is necessary. We we ingest,
[1:43:28] we take in and believe all of that that
[1:43:31] it brings us to that place of of faith
[1:43:35] in in Christ. Faith in what we know is
[1:43:38] truth. Faith in what we're in a body
[1:43:40] change in what we're about to experience
[1:43:42] is going home to be with the Lord in the
[1:43:44] rapture.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It all brings us to that same
[1:43:48] place. Amen. God has that five-fold
[1:43:52] ministry in that place for that point to
[1:43:54] the foolishness of preaching that it
[1:43:56] might save the soul.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. People look at it as foolishness,
[1:44:01] but God looks at it as his way of
[1:44:03] bringing. Again, remember they tried one
[1:44:06] time.
[1:44:08] We don't want to hear Moses and God
[1:44:10] speak. They one one short blast of that
[1:44:13] and they were done with that.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's a reason.
[1:44:17] There's a purpose. A lot of people lose
[1:44:19] the understanding, the reason, purpose,
[1:44:20] why we come to church, why we listen to
[1:44:22] preaching, why we have live ministry,
[1:44:25] and don't just press play.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We do. Because we believe that to
[1:44:32] be the truth. And anybody that presses
[1:44:34] play, listens, they'll hear who they
[1:44:36] hear on THAT PRESS PLAY TELL you to go
[1:44:39] to church to a minister.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we
[1:44:45] could.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] Amen.
[1:44:51] Take heed. Beware.
[1:44:54] It's a word that God brings to us that
[1:44:56] we stand true on.
[1:44:59] Faith comes by hearing that word.
[1:45:03] Hearing and hearing that word. Praise
[1:45:05] God for it.
[1:45:09] Correctly. Teaching of doctrine of
[1:45:12] truth.
[1:45:14] God brings it to us that we believe it.
[1:45:18] We receive it. We accept it as truth.
[1:45:20] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:45:24] Amen. Let's uh let's just let's just
[1:45:27] sing this little course again here we
[1:45:28] have in the book we already have on the
[1:45:30] screen. Your Lord prepare me to be a
[1:45:33] sanctuary.
[1:45:34] Praise the [music] Lord. Comes in the
[1:45:36] same way, saints. Amen. Comes in the
[1:45:39] same way. We believe it to be so. We
[1:45:42] desire that with all our hearts.
[1:45:45] Let's sing now. Lord, prepare [singing]
[1:45:49] me
[1:45:51] to be a [music] sanctuary,
[1:45:58] pure [singing] and holy, [music]
[1:46:03] tried and [singing] true.
[1:46:08] With [music] thanksgiving,
[1:46:13] I'll [singing] be a living [music]

[1:46:44] [music]
[1:46:45] tried and true
[1:46:50] with [singing and music] thanksgiving.
[1:46:54] I'll be a living [music]
[1:46:57] [singing]
[1:47:00] sanctuary
[1:47:03] [music]
[1:47:05] for [singing]
[1:47:06] you.

[1:47:23] That's where he [music] wants us to be.
[1:47:25] Amen. He wants us to be his sanctuary.
[1:47:29] He wants to use us. He wants to live
[1:47:31] through us. He wants to speak through
[1:47:33] us. He wants to walk in our shoes. He
[1:47:36] wants to use our hands. He wants to
[1:47:37] [music] use our voice. He wants to be He
[1:47:40] wants us to be the extension of him on
[1:47:42] this earth today.
[1:47:45] God help us. In some cases, probably in
[1:47:48] most cases today, it's probably more of
[1:47:52] being a judgment on others than it is
[1:47:54] anything else. Amen. But we try to
[1:47:58] witness to people to help them
[1:48:00] understand there is a better way.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; There's a right way. There's a true way.
[1:48:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. And we know that
[1:48:08] way.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; We want to share it with others.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But when they get But
[1:48:13] if they refuse it and get on the other
[1:48:15] side, they can't look up there and say,
[1:48:17] "Well, God, I didn't know."
[1:48:20] Well, let me play it back for you and
[1:48:22] let you see. This is where this is where
[1:48:24] Dennis, this is where Sheilia, this
[1:48:26] where Ralph told. This is where they
[1:48:27] told you. Amen. Here it is. And what can
[1:48:31] they do? hang their head in shame
[1:48:33] because they know it's true.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; In front of that light, in front of that
[1:48:37] great light, every bit of it comes comes
[1:48:40] to a reality comes comes to light. Amen.
[1:48:44] There's no hiding it then.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. The only thing
[1:48:49] hidden, the only thing in that is
[1:48:51] annihilated and done away with is your
[1:48:53] sin.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That is not replayable.
[1:48:58] That is not on rewind. That tape that
[1:49:01] that book, Brother Brandon said, was
[1:49:03] thrown in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Yes,

[1:49:23] bless you along the way and keep us amen
[1:49:26] through the week. If he blesses us with
[1:49:27] another day, we'll have another day.
[1:49:30] Blesses us with another week, we'll come
[1:49:31] back next week.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. After this week, now I'll get
[1:49:35] three weeks off. So, there won't be any
[1:49:38] uh church changing. Um I may send out
[1:49:42] texts just to make sure. Everybody
