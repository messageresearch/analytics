[22:05] um my roommate
[22:08] um he's been my roommate for about two
[22:11] years or so now
[22:13] but his grandmother has been through a
[22:17] whole battle over the last
[22:19] 10 years or so with she was smoking and
[22:22] she quit
[22:23] and she's been quit for forever but she
[22:26] developed cancer in her lungs and then
[22:29] her lung capacities only to about 50
[22:32] and now she's to basically um
[22:36] i think she's holding on she probably
[22:37] would have passed by now her one last
[22:39] wish is to have a christmas dinner with
[22:40] her family
[22:41] and they're doing that today oh wow um
[22:44] so
[22:45] i don't i don't know when but it's
[22:46] probably gonna be pretty soon that god
[22:48] takes her and
[22:49] they're all really close so they're all
[22:51] they've been crying for like the last
[22:52] week and spending time with her and

[40:29] 26.
[40:30] i'm going to read several verses
[40:33] of scripture
[40:42] luke chapter 1 verse 26.
[40:53] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[40:56] was sent from god into a city of galilee
[40:58] named nazareth
[41:00] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[41:03] was joseph
[41:05] of the house of david and the virgin's
[41:08] name was mary
[41:10] an angel came in unto her and said hail
[41:13] thou art highly favored the lord is with
[41:16] thee
[41:17] blessed art thou among women and when
[41:20] she saw him
[41:21] she was troubled at his city and cast in
[41:25] her mind
[41:25] what manner of salutation this should be
[41:30] the angel said unto her fear not
[41:34] mary for thou hast found favor with god
[41:39] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[41:43] shall bring forth a son and shall call
[41:46] his name
[41:46] jesus he shall be great and shall be
[41:50] called the son of the highest and the
[41:51] lord god
[41:52] shall give unto him the throne of his
[41:54] father david
[41:57] he shall reign over the house of jacob
[41:59] forever
[42:01] of his kingdom there shall be no end
[42:05] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[42:08] this be
[42:10] seen that i know not a man
[42:13] an angel answered or said unto her
[42:16] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[42:19] and the power of the high shall
[42:21] overshadow thee
[42:23] therefore also that holy thing which
[42:26] shall be borne of thee shall be called
[42:29] the son of god
[42:33] behold thy cousin elizabeth
[42:36] hath also conceived a son in her old age
[42:39] this is the sixth month with her who was
[42:42] called baron
[42:44] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[42:47] amen yes mary said behold the handmaid
[42:52] of the lord
[42:53] be it unto me according to thy word and
[42:55] the angel departed from her
[42:59] mary arose in those days and went into
[43:02] hill country with haste
[43:05] into the city of judah entered into the
[43:08] house of zechariah
[43:09] and saluted lisbon
[43:13] they came to pass that when elizabeth
[43:15] heard the salutation of mary
[43:18] that the babe leaped in her womb
[43:21] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[43:26] she spoke out with a loud voice
[43:30] and said blessed are thou among women
[43:33] blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[43:36] for which it is that this to me
[43:40] that the mother of my lord should come
[43:43] to me
[43:44] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[43:47] salutation
[43:49] sounded in my ears the baby leaked in my
[43:53] womb for joy
[43:55] blessed is she that believeth for there
[43:59] shall be a performance of those things
[44:02] which were told her from the lord
[44:06] mary said my soul the magnify the lord
[44:09] and my spirit have rejoiced in god my
[44:13] savior for he hath regarded the lowest
[44:16] date of his handmaid
[44:18] for behold from henceforth
[44:22] all generations shall call me blessed
[44:26] for he that is mighty had done to me
[44:28] great things
[44:31] and his name holy is his name
[44:34] his mercy is on them that fear him from
[44:37] generation to generation
[44:41] he has shown strength with his arm he
[44:44] has scattered a crowd
[44:46] into the imagination of their hearts
[44:50] it put down the mighty from their seeds
[44:52] and exalted them
[44:54] of the lower degree may the lord have
[44:57] the blessing of the reading of the word
[44:58] you may be seated
[45:05] i'd like to to speak on
[45:11] a christmas message and i know sometimes
[45:14] around the
[45:16] the message is not a popular thing to do
[45:21] because they say that christmas is
[45:25] a pagan holiday
[45:28] i was with brother benny the other day
[45:30] and we was on a job site
[45:33] and somebody asked him he said do you
[45:35] celebrate christmas
[45:38] and he said no we don't he said we
[45:41] celebrate the birth of christ
[45:46] and i thought that was just an
[45:47] outstanding answer
[45:51] because of the importance
[45:54] of the birth of christ he said well it's
[45:57] not the right time
[45:59] why is it at the wrong time
[46:02] because of the truth of what it is
[46:07] satan has done all he can
[46:10] to take away from who it was
[46:13] right that was born there amen he's
[46:17] changed the time of the year he's made a
[46:19] pagan holidays
[46:21] surrounding his birth he's done all
[46:23] these things
[46:25] why has he done that
[46:30] because the truth without a birth
[46:35] there's no death right without a death
[46:38] amen
[46:38] we're lost that's right great
[46:42] there's no salvation without a death
[46:45] okay and so this morning
[46:51] i would like to speak
[46:54] and most of you are familiar with me
[46:57] but i'm always looking at things a bit
[47:01] differently
[47:02] and this has been kind of odd for me
[47:06] because we do a service here
[47:10] on saturday night and not long after i
[47:13] got
[47:13] the saturday night service done
[47:15] scripture started flowing through me
[47:18] for this morning i had a hard time
[47:23] getting ready for the service that's
[47:25] just ahead of this
[47:27] because i had so much material here
[47:30] and that's very unusual for me to know
[47:34] anything besides a starting point
[47:35] right okay it just is
[47:38] but i'd like to go back and just take a
[47:42] few minutes
[47:43] and i'd like to cover the first few
[47:45] verses of this
[47:47] a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[47:49] was joseph
[47:51] of the house of david and the virgin's
[47:53] name was mary
[47:55] do you realize that the king of kings
[48:01] didn't come to earth as a king
[48:04] right he could have chosen any way he
[48:08] wanted to
[48:10] to come that's right
[48:13] but he chose one of the poorest families
[48:16] that there was
[48:19] they were so poor
[48:22] that they didn't have a blanket the
[48:25] rapid man
[48:31] you say hold on but they was the full
[48:35] the reason he was wrapped in swatted
[48:37] clothes i know the meaning of that
[48:40] but they had to be poor right
[48:43] to not have the needs for a baby
[48:50] we can't imagine that today right
[48:55] even the poor's the poor
[49:00] people knit blankets they give them
[49:02] clothes they do
[49:04] their stuff they hand me down from
[49:06] families
[49:07] but you see become
[49:10] so bored
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] he come to a poor family am i
[49:21] bring life
[49:30] an angel came to her and said hail thou
[49:32] art highly favored
[49:34] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[49:38] among women
[49:40] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[49:42] his saying
[49:44] and cast in her mind what manner of
[49:47] salutation this
[49:48] being and the angel realized
[49:54] that his presence troubled her
[49:59] well what we need to realize
[50:06] that we have let become common
[50:09] to us the supernatural of god
[50:14] right now we explained it away
[50:21] this was a very act
[50:24] that was promised
[50:29] in isaiah 7 14
[50:32] a virgin shall conceive
[50:35] but there was so much time lapsed right
[50:41] they're relatively sure they have
[50:44] forgotten it
[50:50] i'm gonna ask a question because i'm
[50:53] going to get right down where we live
[50:55] this morning
[50:56] and if i offend you
[51:02] i apologize if i offend you
[51:05] but the word offends you i don't
[51:07] apologize right amen
[51:10] okay
[51:16] but have we been so long
[51:20] since that we was in the meetings of
[51:22] brother brown
[51:26] since the tapes and the supernatural
[51:30] prayer lines
[51:33] have we forgotten that
[51:37] haven't just become quote that brother
[51:40] brown said
[51:42] instead of the life right amen
[51:45] that was manifested there right right
[51:50] it's become a doctrine it's become
[51:54] legalism
[51:55] yes it's become do's and don'ts
[51:59] right
[52:02] with the life of christ is forgiveness
[52:06] and love and power amen
[52:13] we've come become judgmental
[52:18] because people don't believe the message
[52:21] so we
[52:22] think that they're less than we are
[52:24] right right
[52:27] that's garbage yes religious spirit
[52:30] yes sir amen that would let come in
[52:34] i told you it's going to get down where
[52:38] we live today
[52:40] people won't know if somebody's in the
[52:41] message that's nonsense
[52:44] amen
[52:48] are they in christ amen
[52:51] that's the devil separating you from
[52:53] somebody else that making help
[52:55] right that's true that's a religious
[52:58] spirit
[53:03] that's not the holy ghost
[53:06] i want to show you something that's
[53:08] where we're going to go today
[53:16] the angel said you will be overshadowed
[53:20] by the holy ghost it is
[53:23] words right he said by the holy ghost
[53:27] you'll be overshadowed
[53:31] and what did that produce in mary
[53:39] life yeah
[53:53] i read it to you what did he produce
[53:59] because elizabeth said
[54:04] right just her very greeting yeah
[54:13] this was was filled with the holy ghost
[54:18] just her very greeting
[54:22] yes
[54:28] and a baby leaked in a womb
[54:33] just at the very greening of mary
[54:36] because the holy ghost had overshadowed
[54:39] her
[54:40] right
[54:51] paul says in galatians
[55:03] see if i can find it real quick
[55:07] my children of whom i travail at birth
[55:10] again until christ
[55:14] be formed in you amen
[55:20] the spirit that god is to perform in us
[55:24] not our knowledge right right
[55:29] not our knowledge amen it's the spirit
[55:33] of god that's to come out of us
[55:35] amen we're to love
[55:39] one another
[55:56] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[56:03] even in this thou shalt love thy
[56:06] neighbor as thyself
[56:13] you can't love your neighbor
[56:17] without the love of god that's right yes
[56:22] because you got eyes
[56:25] that's looking at you
[56:28] and looking at somebody else and we're
[56:31] seeing
[56:31] what we don't like right
[56:35] we're seeing their lifestyles that we
[56:39] don't like
[56:40] we don't like their mannerism we don't
[56:43] like who they are
[56:44] so what do we do we open our
[56:48] mouth and we execute law on them
[56:52] right wow
[56:57] when we do that
[57:00] we're shutting down our own life
[57:05] we're shutting ourselves down amen
[57:12] we won't criticize somebody else
[57:15] we don't like them we don't like how
[57:19] they do
[57:20] you know what that proves you don't have
[57:22] the holy ghost
[57:24] amen i told you you're going to be
[57:27] strong today
[57:29] you can't speak negative and have the
[57:31] spirit of god remember right right
[57:34] right you can't do it
[57:40] now this is being filmed live going
[57:43] around the world also
[57:50] we have about 500 people that watch
[57:52] these services
[58:00] because the pattern
[58:04] that was given to mary
[58:07] can't be broken brother branham said we
[58:10] must receive the word the same as mary
[58:13] did
[58:14] she didn't receive it intellectually
[58:18] she asked a question and he answered her
[58:24] he said how can this be i know it's not
[58:27] a man
[58:28] right
[58:33] but we've let the religious spirits come
[58:35] in
[58:37] we would let the message
[58:41] spirits
[58:44] i remember the last service i was with
[58:49] my uncle
[58:52] he had gone to macon georgia
[58:56] in 1955
[58:59] the last service i was with him
[59:03] five years ago he's gone to be with the
[59:06] lord now
[59:10] but he took 20 minutes before he played
[59:12] a tape
[59:14] and he talked about what he saw
[59:17] in macon
[59:20] not about what he said
[59:25] we're more interested in what brother
[59:27] brown said
[59:29] than what we saw hmm
[59:33] he said wait my brother listen he talked
[59:36] about
[59:37] jesus christ being manifested in those
[59:40] services
[59:41] healing the sick the lame to walk
[59:45] setting the cactus free that's what he
[59:48] saw
[59:50] he wasn't talking about brother brown
[59:52] got that one the brother
[59:53] was against that one listen when people
[59:56] come against us
[59:59] it's more of a test for us than it is
[1:00:01] them
[1:00:02] right yes
[1:00:05] but we get an attitude
[1:00:14] it's time that we get back to the altar
[1:00:17] for a refilling he said brother this is
[1:00:20] not a christmas message
[1:00:21] it is a christmas mission they could be
[1:00:23] birthed
[1:00:24] it's greater in our hearts
[1:00:29] right folks there's trouble on every
[1:00:32] side
[1:00:33] yes amen right
[1:00:39] and i'm going to say something here that
[1:00:41] i haven't
[1:00:44] i've only talked privately to people
[1:00:52] that have only voiced it a few times and
[1:00:55] i may be incorrect here
[1:01:01] but i believe the pandemic
[1:01:07] is on many levels
[1:01:10] going to usher in the closing out of the
[1:01:13] world
[1:01:15] but this is just the beginning yes
[1:01:19] yes it is but you know what all this
[1:01:21] testing's about it's not about what you
[1:01:24] got the virus or not
[1:01:26] it's about you willingly giving up your
[1:01:28] dna
[1:01:32] okay they couldn't get it unless you
[1:01:35] willingly give it up
[1:01:39] okay
[1:01:43] so now they got a track of you
[1:01:49] okay and i'm relatively sure
[1:01:53] for us to travel overseas they're going
[1:01:55] to make us get
[1:01:58] right yeah there's going to be no choice
[1:02:00] about it
[1:02:05] there's a lawsuit
[1:02:08] of doctors in europe
[1:02:12] because this
[1:02:15] vaccination is going to make women
[1:02:18] infertile
[1:02:19] around the world
[1:02:26] you talking about control
[1:02:29] the enemy is coming in like a flood
[1:02:33] right but see if the enemy keeps us
[1:02:36] fighting each other
[1:02:38] keeps us criticizing each other i don't
[1:02:41] like this
[1:02:41] i don't like that folks
[1:02:46] i i i i'm going to run out of time here
[1:02:50] but that's the spirit of the enemy right
[1:02:53] yes
[1:02:54] amen amen well i'm critical to you
[1:02:58] brother dennis
[1:03:00] that's the enemy spirit that's not
[1:03:03] the holy ghost you said well
[1:03:06] but i'm just speaking fact that's
[1:03:08] nonsense
[1:03:10] because i show you something
[1:03:19] and i've done this before
[1:03:25] and i i don't mean to pick on you
[1:03:27] brother dennis but can i use you just a
[1:03:29] minute
[1:03:30] okay i trust you don't take it
[1:03:34] personally
[1:03:36] but i can come up to you and i say man
[1:03:40] you got them sticking cowboy boots on
[1:03:43] what you trying to be like somebody big
[1:03:50] you know i could criticize you right for
[1:03:53] what you dress
[1:03:54] for the way you speak and where does
[1:03:57] that
[1:03:58] go right in here
[1:04:01] okay we take that
[1:04:06] but i can say well dennis
[1:04:09] i love you and appreciate you he said
[1:04:12] but you don't know me
[1:04:13] i said but i do know you because we're
[1:04:16] one in christ
[1:04:17] make a move okay but you'll have a hard
[1:04:21] time receiving that
[1:04:23] we'll receive the negative that quick
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:27] well we won't receive the positive about
[1:04:29] each other right
[1:04:33] we say brother
[1:04:36] i appreciate it hey i appreciate you too
[1:04:38] what we just done
[1:04:40] we have just reflected
[1:04:44] when somebody was trying to encourage us
[1:04:48] we didn't receive it right
[1:04:51] if we don't receive the spirit of god
[1:04:55] amen in the depths of our heart
[1:04:59] like mary did brother brother said we
[1:05:02] must receive the word
[1:05:04] not the printed word
[1:05:09] the spirit words amen just
[1:05:13] like mary did
[1:05:18] that christ be formed in us
[1:05:24] if we want to know what spirit we are
[1:05:26] watch what comes out of our mouth
[1:05:28] amen yes
[1:05:33] okay example
[1:05:39] when jesus walked down to the pool of
[1:05:42] bethesda
[1:05:45] and he told the man pick up the bed and
[1:05:49] walk
[1:05:55] and then what he went to carrying his
[1:05:59] bed
[1:06:02] the pharisees said it's not lawful for
[1:06:05] you to carry your bed
[1:06:11] it wasn't marveling at a man that had
[1:06:13] been on the bed for 38 years
[1:06:16] was up walking carrying his bed they was
[1:06:18] almost right
[1:06:19] they was only concerned about what they
[1:06:22] saw that didn't add up to what they
[1:06:24] wanted
[1:06:25] right right right
[1:06:28] amen they wasn't looking at the miracle
[1:06:32] they couldn't receive that hmm
[1:06:38] but roger the message is important yes
[1:06:41] but we don't enter receive it
[1:06:44] intellectually
[1:06:45] we receive it in our spirit amen
[1:06:49] that's right he said well why don't we
[1:06:52] listen to tapes why don't we read the
[1:06:54] scriptures
[1:06:54] it's because we feed a spirit right
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:03] you are what you eat yes true that's
[1:07:06] right it's true
[1:07:10] that's in the natural yes
[1:07:14] i'm 98 pounds less than i was because i
[1:07:17] eat less
[1:07:21] you are what you eat
[1:07:25] but when i was 300 pounds my blood sugar
[1:07:28] was up here
[1:07:31] we're talking about a complete healing
[1:07:33] right amen
[1:07:36] i've checked my blood sugar and that's
[1:07:39] just happened in the last two months
[1:07:46] i controlled it with diet exercise
[1:07:52] my blood sugar's so low now that
[1:07:56] i talked about in the 80s
[1:08:02] with nothing right
[1:08:12] if you believe god amen
[1:08:16] you have to receive it
[1:08:19] okay i shared a testimony last night on
[1:08:22] the service
[1:08:25] i have struggled for weeks with my ears
[1:08:35] my sinuses makes it feel like my water
[1:08:38] ears are full of water
[1:08:42] and then it runs out and makes them itch
[1:08:48] it gotten to the point i was getting up
[1:08:50] at night
[1:08:55] the night before last
[1:08:58] after i got up something said to me why
[1:09:01] don't you ask me to fix your ears
[1:09:04] right
[1:09:17] and i told him lord i'm sorry all right
[1:09:20] i just never thought about it
[1:09:29] see we are so critical the way somebody
[1:09:33] worships
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:40] they would have never believed
[1:09:45] the religious people that day would have
[1:09:48] never believed the king of kings laid in
[1:09:50] a manger
[1:09:53] wouldn't have believed it
[1:10:01] the king of kings will come at least to
[1:10:06] the daughter of problem of man
[1:10:10] but die right
[1:10:15] he said i come to save that
[1:10:19] that was lost
[1:10:22] it was undone right
[1:10:26] he said i come to do that
[1:10:39] he said love covers a multitude of sins
[1:10:48] oh yes
[1:10:58] let me if i don't watch it i'll run
[1:11:02] completely out of time
[1:11:05] i need to go back here i know
[1:11:08] that most of you people here have heard
[1:11:10] me read this scripture before
[1:11:13] ephesians 6 and 17 take the helmet of
[1:11:16] salvation
[1:11:18] and the sword of the spirit which
[1:11:21] is right yes the word of god amen
[1:11:25] okay so what was that
[1:11:30] that come to mary here
[1:11:35] the word of god that had been spoken by
[1:11:38] isaiah
[1:11:43] okay
[1:11:46] right
[1:11:50] what was come to us in our day
[1:11:57] it was what was spoken
[1:12:01] by malachi
[1:12:04] amen behold i send you elijah the
[1:12:06] prophet
[1:12:07] right well
[1:12:11] the people of this day raise elijah the
[1:12:15] prophet
[1:12:16] higher than god raised him
[1:12:20] right go back there with that scripture
[1:12:23] with me just a moment turn with me and
[1:12:26] if i take too long today you'll just
[1:12:29] deal with it okay
[1:12:33] verse 5 behold i send you elijah the
[1:12:35] prophet
[1:12:38] behold i send you
[1:12:43] he tells you who he's sending right
[1:12:49] him too before he tells you who he
[1:12:51] sinned
[1:12:57] so what does that make it more important
[1:13:00] elijah the prophet
[1:13:01] or who he's being sent to right
[1:13:09] hello see
[1:13:13] what we've got here that's the
[1:13:15] fulfillment
[1:13:16] of the word spoken by the prophet
[1:13:19] malachi
[1:13:20] and we beheld it in our day
[1:13:25] but we've done the same thing with it
[1:13:27] that they did
[1:13:30] if you're not a jew if you're not a
[1:13:32] pharisee
[1:13:35] that they're dealing with christ
[1:13:40] we've done the same thing with our day
[1:13:43] it's not by the letter of this message
[1:13:47] because it wasn't by brother branham's
[1:13:49] learning
[1:13:50] right that he was able to do that that's
[1:13:54] right amen it was by the spirit of god
[1:13:59] that he received amen amen
[1:14:03] okay
[1:14:06] see today
[1:14:10] we like to put
[1:14:13] but about them higher than us that means
[1:14:16] we don't have to be responsible
[1:14:18] to what the spirit spoke to
[1:14:22] right okay
[1:14:25] because we can't reach that if we place
[1:14:27] him higher
[1:14:28] but if we really want to know the truth
[1:14:31] he said that we must
[1:14:33] receive the word the same way that mary
[1:14:36] did
[1:14:38] now i'm going to get hard on you again
[1:14:44] mary was a little
[1:14:48] bitty nobody woman
[1:14:51] right hey
[1:14:58] she wasn't even a man that he come to
[1:15:02] but
[1:15:06] in the jewish law her word
[1:15:12] wasn't even allowed in court
[1:15:15] right
[1:15:22] but yet god
[1:15:30] found it expedient
[1:15:36] to come down
[1:15:52] to realize
[1:16:08] i've got so many scriptures this morning
[1:16:10] i can't begin to get done
[1:16:17] this i say then as apostle paul speaking
[1:16:21] in
[1:16:22] galatians 5 16 walk in the spirit
[1:16:26] and not in the fulfillment of the lust
[1:16:29] of the flesh
[1:16:32] lust has nothing to do that word lust
[1:16:34] there has nothing to do
[1:16:36] with sex
[1:16:39] it has to do with pride
[1:16:43] it has to do with things
[1:16:46] like that
[1:16:50] because out of the mouth
[1:16:54] do we speak what's in the heart
[1:16:59] okay out of mary's
[1:17:02] mouth her salutation
[1:17:08] after she received the holy ghost
[1:17:16] we should be centered in christ to the
[1:17:20] point
[1:17:25] and out of our mouths
[1:17:42] blessings
[1:17:44] enviance murders drunkenness revel in
[1:17:47] such like
[1:17:47] what you i tell you before as i vote so
[1:17:50] told you in times past the day which do
[1:17:52] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:17:54] right amen
[1:17:59] what's the kingdom of god
[1:18:04] i want to go someplace here
[1:18:09] what is the kingdom of god
[1:18:19] the kingdom of god is the authority of
[1:18:21] god
[1:18:24] right or wrong now stop and think about
[1:18:27] that
[1:18:29] what is exercise from the kingdom
[1:18:33] the queen or the king their authority
[1:18:37] and they're not questioned right right
[1:18:39] or wrong
[1:18:42] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:18:47] in earth as it is in heaven that's right
[1:18:50] that's right
[1:18:52] in earth this earth
[1:18:57] this 16 elements of dirt
[1:19:01] that the authority of the word
[1:19:04] would come to me like he didn't marry
[1:19:11] repent be baptized every one of you in
[1:19:14] the name of jesus christ
[1:19:15] amen listen
[1:19:21] most of what we don't like about someone
[1:19:24] else
[1:19:30] let me go back here i need to go here it
[1:19:33] says they shall not inherit
[1:19:35] the kingdom of god
[1:19:38] it does not say that shall be lost
[1:19:41] right you say that
[1:19:45] but roger
[1:19:54] because the kingdom of god and salvation
[1:19:56] is not the same thing
[1:19:57] right
[1:20:01] now i've got you really upset
[1:20:09] because all the people that you cut out
[1:20:11] because you didn't like their actions
[1:20:13] are still in
[1:20:14] right you didn't put them that's right
[1:20:16] you can't cut
[1:20:26] my dear wife i said you know i said
[1:20:27] people don't like me a lot of times
[1:20:29] i said but they can't throw me out
[1:20:31] because it didn't put me in
[1:20:32] right true that's right amen that's
[1:20:34] right okay
[1:20:36] i've got a saying
[1:20:40] you can get angry with me you can
[1:20:43] dislike me
[1:20:46] but unless you're a snake you got to get
[1:20:48] glad in the same skin you got mad at
[1:20:50] right yeah
[1:20:54] it's true true amen
[1:20:58] you know
[1:21:02] so what was that in the garden of eden
[1:21:05] a serpent a snake so unless you're a
[1:21:08] snake
[1:21:09] you got your glad in the same skin you
[1:21:11] got mad here right
[1:21:14] if you're born again you're not a snake
[1:21:19] amen satan may be
[1:21:22] hammering at your heart
[1:21:27] you know i
[1:21:35] got a request not long ago
[1:21:38] a person wanted to pray for their spouse
[1:21:53] i think we need to start judging people
[1:21:58] let me go here i've just got a few more
[1:22:01] minutes
[1:22:06] quit judging people for what we see
[1:22:12] because you realize that the law said
[1:22:17] that mary was to be stoned right
[1:22:22] anyone that was pregnant
[1:22:25] without being married
[1:22:29] was to be stoned to death
[1:22:33] she accepted
[1:22:38] the black mark right yeah exactly
[1:22:44] she accepted that everyone i walked
[1:22:48] around said oh
[1:22:49] she was pregnant because they could see
[1:22:53] the signs
[1:22:55] right before they got married
[1:23:01] she was pregnant
[1:23:10] what were they doing i was executing
[1:23:14] judgment on somebody
[1:23:16] that they had no idea what they were
[1:23:18] talking about
[1:23:20] and i'm afraid that we do that way too
[1:23:21] much yes
[1:23:28] you can't give life
[1:23:31] not to destroy it that's right
[1:23:34] right and if we're sons and daughters of
[1:23:37] god
[1:23:38] we are givers of light givers of
[1:23:41] life not destroyers of life what comes
[1:23:45] out of our mouth
[1:23:46] better not be negative amen
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:58] well people come to me
[1:24:02] they tell me a certain minister's done
[1:24:04] certain things this this
[1:24:05] this and i said listen i said what do
[1:24:08] you think about it
[1:24:09] i think i think it is not my
[1:24:10] responsibility
[1:24:15] i'll tell you how strongly i believe
[1:24:16] this
[1:24:22] i want to talk about a circumstance
[1:24:26] that some of you may know about some of
[1:24:28] them may not because it's been many
[1:24:30] years ago
[1:24:32] but there was a minister
[1:24:36] in the west
[1:24:49] they were stepping out on his wife
[1:24:56] and some people in his church suspected
[1:24:58] it
[1:25:07] so they heard a private detective to
[1:25:10] catch you
[1:25:15] you know what they caught it
[1:25:19] they destroyed the man
[1:25:22] you know why
[1:25:26] because they went contrary
[1:25:30] to the word
[1:25:35] the word says your sins will find you
[1:25:37] out right
[1:25:38] it didn't say any part in me or anyone
[1:25:40] else you're a sin fighter
[1:25:42] okay when we take on that role we're
[1:25:46] executing judgment
[1:25:47] without god's authority he said but oh
[1:25:50] he's wrong
[1:25:52] god's to deal with it not me
[1:25:58] god's to deal with it that's right not
[1:26:01] me
[1:26:02] you say oh no about roger oh yeah yes
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:06] right okay now
[1:26:12] and i can call the name on this brother
[1:26:15] graham snelling that was the second
[1:26:16] pastor of the branham tabernacle
[1:26:19] there was one before him and then graham
[1:26:21] snelling was put in
[1:26:23] brother graham snelling got caught in
[1:26:26] adultery
[1:26:28] brother brown come off the field went
[1:26:30] and talked to graham
[1:26:35] he went to the church he said don't put
[1:26:37] him out
[1:26:39] graham has repented amen
[1:26:43] okay we won't take that right
[1:26:47] we'll be judgmental on that
[1:26:52] we don't like it
[1:26:55] six months later graham got off in false
[1:26:58] doctrine
[1:27:00] brother graham come off the field again
[1:27:03] and he took him out of the pulpit
[1:27:06] he didn't ask him anything we'll judge
[1:27:10] somebody for something that could be put
[1:27:11] on the blood
[1:27:13] but something that will damn our soul
[1:27:16] we'll sit under day in and day out right
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:23] okay because the spirit of god
[1:27:27] it's a religious spirit a false doctrine
[1:27:30] is a religious spirit right
[1:27:31] and a religious spirit will stam your
[1:27:35] soul right right
[1:27:39] it will
[1:27:43] if we are going to look
[1:27:48] at the true spirit of christmas
[1:27:53] it's the holy ghost amen amen
[1:27:56] it's nothing else but the holy ghost
[1:27:59] amen
[1:28:09] i i go to
[1:28:13] share a personal thing here
[1:28:26] 1987.
[1:28:29] my youngest brother took his own life
[1:28:35] my dad ended up being the longest
[1:28:37] servant deacon at the brethren
[1:28:39] tabernacle in the history of the church
[1:28:46] he had been on the board probably 20
[1:28:47] years in 1987
[1:28:52] maybe not quite 20 years i think he went
[1:28:54] on in
[1:28:55] 1970 or 71.
[1:29:01] because of the the things that was
[1:29:04] happening in
[1:29:09] a lot of the family members around
[1:29:13] said dad should step down dad should do
[1:29:16] this
[1:29:16] that should be that
[1:29:24] i said because this house wasn't in
[1:29:25] order is this
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:31] him and mom was at odds
[1:29:35] with my youngest brother and just taking
[1:29:38] his own life
[1:29:45] dad told me later said i wasn't praying
[1:29:46] about it
[1:29:52] is that one talked of his brother which
[1:29:54] was brother collinson
[1:29:56] he says god i don't think i'd resign
[1:30:02] what was it it was a thing that pulled
[1:30:04] him through
[1:30:08] but we want to take god away
[1:30:11] from people because of what we see
[1:30:15] happening right well that's just for
[1:30:18] caesar
[1:30:22] but the spirit of god is eternal life
[1:30:25] forever amen
[1:30:29] see they just tried to get us to
[1:30:33] the the enemy trying to get us to lose
[1:30:35] faith
[1:30:36] in god right
[1:30:43] just the mayor of speaking
[1:30:47] brought life yes
[1:30:56] saint john 14 12 a very familiar
[1:31:00] scripture
[1:31:15] verily i say unto you
[1:31:23] not to you all
[1:31:26] unto you
[1:31:31] he that believeth on me
[1:31:34] singular he
[1:31:39] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:31:43] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:31:46] because i go within my father
[1:31:50] i got a question for you how many people
[1:31:52] did the angel
[1:31:53] gabriel appear to
[1:32:02] how many people did the angel gabriel
[1:32:04] appear to
[1:32:08] just one correct mary
[1:32:14] singular one person amen
[1:32:19] we try to the enemy tries to make the
[1:32:21] gospel the group
[1:32:23] of the word of god tabernacle or the
[1:32:26] group
[1:32:27] of tucson tabernacle or the group of the
[1:32:30] branham tabernacle
[1:32:31] but it's not amen it's individuals that
[1:32:35] god
[1:32:35] speaks to their heart amen amen
[1:32:43] is god doing the speaking right
[1:32:50] brother graham said
[1:32:54] the greater works in one
[1:32:57] several places she said you can't do
[1:32:59] greater than what christ did
[1:33:02] but there's one quote
[1:33:06] maybe two but i know for sure why
[1:33:09] he said greater works is imparting
[1:33:13] eternal life
[1:33:19] how do we impart eternal life
[1:33:30] how do we impart eternal life
[1:33:39] anybody got any idea i've done told you
[1:33:42] you have to have it
[1:33:43] you have to have it to impart
[1:33:50] what did mary do when she went to
[1:33:53] elizabeth's house
[1:33:55] she imparted eternal life
[1:33:59] is that simple it was not complicated
[1:34:02] for the dentist
[1:34:03] yes it's not complicated zach
[1:34:08] it's just merely
[1:34:11] speaking about what you have amen
[1:34:16] amen
[1:34:18] not what you want to have what you have
[1:34:22] am i that's right
[1:34:27] too many of us are talking about what we
[1:34:30] hope to have
[1:34:32] hmm but not about what we have
[1:34:38] it's a woman i'm gonna ask you a
[1:34:40] question
[1:34:41] and i told you
[1:34:46] i read through the scriptures shall not
[1:34:47] inherit the kingdom of god i said this
[1:34:49] is
[1:34:49] proof that you don't have the holy ghost
[1:34:51] because you can't get in the kingdom of
[1:34:52] god without the holy ghost
[1:34:54] right okay
[1:35:10] when the scripture says mark 11 23
[1:35:14] when you stand praying forgive amen
[1:35:18] okay
[1:35:21] do you know if you don't forgive
[1:35:25] all the times you've asked for
[1:35:26] forgiveness is not forgiven right now
[1:35:29] yes
[1:35:33] amen you don't receive grace until you
[1:35:37] give it out
[1:35:38] right evidence that you've got grace is
[1:35:41] when you give grace to somebody else
[1:35:43] amen right
[1:35:44] amen amen but somebody's spitting in
[1:35:47] your face you say
[1:35:49] lord bless you and you walk away yes
[1:35:52] wow you're not folding up five real
[1:35:56] firmly
[1:35:57] and minister them real strongly
[1:36:03] okay when we're able to give out grace
[1:36:09] when we're able to give forgiveness when
[1:36:12] we're able
[1:36:13] to behave in the very worst of
[1:36:16] circumstances
[1:36:19] when people are against us
[1:36:24] but people don't understand us
[1:36:28] they talk about about us
[1:36:48] brother doug mccues told me one time
[1:36:50] that he was at that meeting
[1:36:52] that brother branham was at when the
[1:36:54] angels of the lord come to him and told
[1:36:56] him that there was a trap set for him
[1:37:00] okay and i think that if it was a trap
[1:37:04] set for him there's a lot of traps set
[1:37:06] for us
[1:37:06] exactly yes exactly okay yes
[1:37:11] and i think we don't realize how much
[1:37:13] the traps are set for us
[1:37:16] yes
[1:37:19] he said that the young people were
[1:37:20] sitting on the front row and it was
[1:37:22] about a four foot stage up there like an
[1:37:24] auditorium you know where i'm talking
[1:37:26] about
[1:37:26] about four foot high stays all the way
[1:37:28] across and they were sitting on the
[1:37:30] front row
[1:37:30] and he said they were literally making
[1:37:32] love
[1:37:45] and they didn't and the voice spoke to
[1:37:49] me him
[1:37:50] and said whatever you say is the way
[1:37:53] it'll be
[1:38:00] okay got to be careful what you say here
[1:38:03] now
[1:38:04] right he said i could
[1:38:07] spoke and they would have carried them
[1:38:09] out
[1:38:14] he says but neither
[1:38:18] do i condemn thee i forgive thee
[1:38:23] why grace come out his mouth
[1:38:27] right because he had received grace
[1:38:30] right correct
[1:38:34] amen hallelujah we can't give
[1:38:37] eternal life if we haven't received it
[1:38:42] right
[1:38:46] i'm gonna make a statement here in
[1:38:49] closing
[1:38:50] there's way too many people
[1:38:53] that claim to be message believers
[1:38:58] that have got an intellectual holy ghost
[1:39:01] not a real holy ghost
[1:39:03] right say what's the difference it's
[1:39:05] because that you have studied
[1:39:09] not that you've received right
[1:39:16] okay you say oh i can't do that
[1:39:20] jesus said you could yeah when he told
[1:39:23] peter he said
[1:39:24] you've not been taught this by man right
[1:39:28] but been showed this by my father in
[1:39:31] heaven
[1:39:33] amen hello
[1:39:37] that's right and it was talking about
[1:39:40] who he was
[1:39:43] so there's such a thing as an
[1:39:44] intellectual holy ghost
[1:39:46] yes yes and that's where the religious
[1:39:50] spirits dwell
[1:39:54] they think they're right
[1:39:58] and they have no grace for nobody
[1:40:03] let's look at jesus's life in closing
[1:40:07] when they brought the woman caught to
[1:40:09] him in adultery
[1:40:11] he said neither do i condemn thee go and
[1:40:14] sin no more
[1:40:15] right when they was
[1:40:19] absolutely accusing her we caught her in
[1:40:22] the very act
[1:40:23] but you know they were contrary to the
[1:40:25] word because they were supposed to bring
[1:40:27] the man
[1:40:28] and the woman they only brought the
[1:40:31] woman
[1:40:35] according to the law if you're going to
[1:40:38] live by the law
[1:40:43] if you're going to judge somebody by the
[1:40:44] law
[1:40:48] you know you gotta be judged
[1:40:54] so folks all right i trust
[1:41:00] that today
[1:41:04] i don't know how good a job i've done
[1:41:06] because i had so much today
[1:41:13] but i want us to be able to lay aside
[1:41:18] because the spirits around the message
[1:41:20] will condemn you
[1:41:22] for even separate celebrating christmas
[1:41:27] i was raised at the branham tabernacle
[1:41:31] they always get a suit of clothes to
[1:41:33] brother branham and brother neville
[1:41:36] as a christmas gift he always got a new
[1:41:38] suit
[1:41:40] and the kids
[1:41:44] they give a box of candy and an orange
[1:41:46] to every kid
[1:41:47] in attendance to the sunday
[1:41:50] before christmas
[1:41:55] years later all the widows and divorced
[1:41:59] women
[1:42:00] to give a food basket
[1:42:04] people say you shouldn't do that brother
[1:42:07] brown gives gifts to his children
[1:42:11] but he did he said well
[1:42:15] no here's where i'm gonna go with this
[1:42:18] are you more spiritual than brother
[1:42:20] breton was
[1:42:22] okay intellectually you may be
[1:42:26] but in real holy ghost leadership no no
[1:42:30] amen right you know
[1:42:33] you can cut people in and out because
[1:42:34] they
[1:42:36] want to recognize christmas or
[1:42:39] residential birth of christ
[1:42:43] listen you have no authority over them
[1:42:47] all you do is exercise this judgment on
[1:42:49] yourself
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:53] amen that's all
[1:42:57] i used to get floods of people
[1:43:00] criticizing me
[1:43:02] for my stand on christmas
[1:43:05] but after i saw that quote without a
[1:43:07] christmas there's no easter
[1:43:08] without easter we're lost hallelujah
[1:43:12] amen why do you think that the devil
[1:43:16] drug it from
[1:43:17] april to december
[1:43:20] trying to make havoc of a truth right
[1:43:27] the bottom line is
[1:43:32] the day you're born
[1:43:36] is not as important as your birth is
[1:43:43] hello
[1:43:48] the day you're born is only a date
[1:43:54] but your birth is life amen
[1:43:57] right that's right
[1:44:01] so why don't we make a big deal
[1:44:06] and try to cut out all
[1:44:09] the worship
[1:44:12] of a risen savior amen
[1:44:16] let's come set us free
[1:44:19] amen
[1:44:30] if we love him we love one another
[1:44:33] yes
[1:44:39] we see imperfections
[1:44:44] in everyone's life me being in the
[1:44:48] ministry
[1:44:49] you know what that does that puts it on
[1:44:51] a big screen yes
[1:44:52] right okay
[1:44:57] and the devil's pointing them out hey
[1:44:58] look there look at that
[1:45:02] you know what's he trying to do
[1:45:06] murder my influence right okay
[1:45:09] right yes it says some of you were
[1:45:12] murderers
[1:45:14] you know if you're criticizing somebody
[1:45:18] else
[1:45:19] murdering their influence from christ
[1:45:23] that's right okay
[1:45:27] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:45:30] shall not inherit the authority of the
[1:45:33] power
[1:45:34] of god right you can't speak
[1:45:38] cursing and life
[1:45:42] right they can't come out of the same
[1:45:44] mouth
[1:45:46] they can't do it
[1:45:51] just the salutation of mary
