They still have a difficult time, but uh please remember them in prayer. They're so very thankful to have church and we're thankful to be able to have the streaming that they can be a part of. So, amen. We love and appreciate brother and sister Pat this morning. Miss them so very much when they're not here. Amen. But so glad and happy to have brother Danny back with us. Amen. Thankful the Lord blessed him and feeling better and able to get around. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

So let's please remember Martha in prayer as well. Also my wife informed me that the zincas don't normally come till January. For some reason, I thought they came a little before that, but uh anyway, we still love them, miss them when they're not here. So, please continue to remember them in prayer uh as they're not here this morning. Sister Sheileas said she'd be here today. I haven't got a text from her. I'm assuming she's on her way. So, uh Lord, just bless and uh be with her this morning. Anyone have a a request on your heart, something you'd like to make known to the church this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes. Sister will be going to see and she found out that her &gt;&gt; doesn't sound good. &gt;&gt; Amanda, Amanda's going in surgery Tuesday, right?

Um, my wife Leah, it's a testimony and a purpose. She went and saw the doctor this past Tuesday. They cleared her. She's doing fine from all those surgery. Uh, but she gets real tired and [clears throat] she's the type of person who likes to stay busy. And I tell her, "You're tired? Go rest." Sometimes she'll rest twice, take a nap twice a day. &gt;&gt; And um, there's some reason she gets tired easy. I I have my problem, but I don't get tired like she does. &gt;&gt; So, I'm real concerned about it. But the Lord knows one touch from him. It's all that matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.

If there's any sin that easily beset us away from you, TAKE IT OUT OF US. It's not a situation where we say, "Lord, I I'm giving you my best." We can give him 99% AND STILL BE BOUND ON THE TRAIN OF HELL. &gt;&gt; OH, Lord Jesus, it took 1% that changed a a human race. And Lord, IT'S TIME TO TOTALLY COMMIT our hearts, our lives to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know, respect a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love all all of us the same. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you gave one person the Holy Ghost and obedience the to your word, you're obligated to do the same for the next person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, it takes full commitment, full surrender.

He had a tough week. I conceal [music] it, Father. Touch and give him strength. Then give him the time to recover and rest. He's your servant.

I am greeting even those that are not at church today may be streaming. Amen. &gt;&gt; Back home. I have a brother in South Africa by the name of Moses. He's in the city Johannesburg. He said to me, just tell me what church you going to be in. &gt;&gt; I want to follow you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said to him, "No, you must follow the Lord, not me." &gt;&gt; But I I gave him know as the pastor this morning, the name of the church, the website, and that I gave it to him. Perhaps they all saw streaming in this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad to be with you. I hope I have something to say that will encourage the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing greetings from the church back home. We in our local church we have the numbers say 60 plus. We 60 plus and we have another satellite group in we are a thousand kilometers out of Cape Town &gt;&gt; out in the remote area where there's no running water. At least we do have electricity now only now &gt;&gt; and sometimes I love to stream the churches I mean the services here but I wouldn't I couldn't because of the coverage the network the the the what do you call it? Yeah. So I sometimes can sometimes I cannot and then but I'm glad to be back here to see you again. I was here. about three years ago. Three, four years. 2023 I think it was &gt;&gt; when I was over here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I felt the love when you welcome here to come and share the little that I could from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the believers back home are sending their greetings. I just spoken to my wife as the pastor alluded before we started the service. She sends her cards as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. at at lovers to perhaps go into the word shortly. Um [clears throat] I'm trying to remember a few things that I wanted to say there. Oh maybe before I forget this one. The last time I was here, some believers gave me presents. They gave me what they could give me. And uh I was really so thankful to receive what they gave me. But there's a a big one, a great gift that was given to me from this church last time. &gt;&gt; Do you know do you know by whom? By brother Joel. &gt;&gt; And I forgot even his name when I was reporting back home and I said this brother &gt;&gt; his name is Joshua. I said his name is Joshua. Only find out it wasn't Joshua. I don't know how old was he when I was here three years ago. &gt;&gt; 10. &gt;&gt; He was 10. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He would be now 13, 14 now. &gt;&gt; 12 &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; Okay. That brother did &gt;&gt; a great thing to me when I left this church last time. I received a letter from him and the letter is here with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Written with his own handwriting and it reads maybe brother read it for us please. &gt;&gt; Yes. He wrote me this letter that brother. &gt;&gt; It just says thank you for coming from Joel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that really touched my heart when the brother he couldn't have no money on him nothing to give but he gave me love. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what I took this thing and it was such a teaching to our church back home &gt;&gt; that a little brother could have done this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just to show how welcome I was in this church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming from joy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um yeah, if I forget some of the things, God I believe God will I want to read from the book of John. Let's read a portion of scripture just one verse perhaps from the book of John chapter 13 and I'll read verse 34 and I have other few scriptures that I might I might not that I will read. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I have some other few scriptures that I will read. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us all stand if we can before we read the scripture. We can stand to our feet if we can and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we are about to open this holy book. Oh Lord God, we learned from your prophet Lord &gt;&gt; that each and every man that's got two hands would be able to open the pages of this book. Lord God, &gt;&gt; but only thy spirit which is thyself Lord would be able to unveil Lord and reveal and speak Lord the things that are contained in the holy book of Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come before you Lord. We bow our hearts Lord our heads and our everything Lord &gt;&gt; we ask you Lord to do what you said you would do Lord. Each time we open the book, you speak to us through this book. Lord, &gt;&gt; our prophet says, "Oh Lord, God, this is a love letter to your bride." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We know, Lord, that you love each and every one of us this morning. Lord, &gt;&gt; we thank you, Lord, for welcoming us, Lord, and taking this precious word, Lord, and bringing to us, oh Lord God. It's it is said, Lord, you are a great eagle, Lord, &gt;&gt; and who are the eagllets, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you feed your igllets Lord from your mouth to our mouth. Oh Lord God, &gt;&gt; thank you Lord Jesus. Speak to us now Lord as we read the word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us read from as I said the book of John chapter 13 and we read verse 34. Let us read. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he also love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you love one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. Um maybe I will talk although it will not seem that is what I'm talking on but I'd like to say a little message that I will bring a new commandment &gt;&gt; the Lord says &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; a new commandment I give unto you. on that new commandment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, before we get to this new commandment in a little deeper manner, let us also read from the book of Hebrews. Let's go to the book of Hebrews, chapter 6, and just read the first three verses of the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm reading from verse one. Therefore, living the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. not laying again the foundations of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And this will we do if God permit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So here I'm just uh laying a foundation to talk about getting to this what is called in the Bible a new commandment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know the new commandment is love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the talking about &gt;&gt; brotherham even says it's the 11th commandment. &gt;&gt; We know there were 10. When I came in there and I saw on the boat right here, "Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shalt not. And I thought, yeah, &gt;&gt; this is what I'm going to speak on anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now, and the Lord Jesus comes around and says, I give you another commandment, a new one. Now, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; that commandment is love, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That you must love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will grow a little bit into it. But now Paul in chapter six of this book of Hebrews says, "Therefore living the principles of doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you will find out that if we talk about going on unto perfection, it means we are growing. We are going on into this new commandment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are growing on into being in that love, that perfect love. You you will know brothers and sisters that in the stat of a perfect man you have your first step being faith and you add to faith virtue from virtue you add you add you add until oh thank you brother [laughter] you add you add until you get to where I think the believers all Christians are at this moment in brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brotherly kindness is where you know in one place in Cape Town the people don't that don't go to church at all that are not believers in in Christ were so amazed when they saw the believers there they said WHAT KIND OF CHURCH ARE YOU GOING to &gt;&gt; we see a difference in you people &gt;&gt; you are always together &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; if we see you in a restaurant you are together in the streets you are together they said there's so much love among you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; what is going on WHAT KIND OF CHURCH IS That &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you see in the scripture say in the Lord Jesus says the people will know by this &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that you are my children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have love one for another. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it means you have grown up. You've gone to where NOW YOU ARE IN that that 11th commandment that you are in that perfect love. &gt;&gt; And now when you are in this brotherly kindness where there is love in the church. Oh brother, sister, when we were praying for people that had requests this morning, I thought how wonderful. Our prophet teaches that God heals. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD IS A HEALER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES IN HIM. &gt;&gt; EVEN BEFORE HE WAS GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE was that selfexistent one, &gt;&gt; HE WAS ELOHIM. &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE BEGINNING, ALL THOSE ATTRIBUTES WERE IN HIM. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE HAD THE attribute of being a healer. But brother Denny was not sick then. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FOR HIM TO PROVE THAT HE WAS A HEALER, HE HAD TO HAVE BROTHER Denny sick &gt;&gt; so THAT HE CAN PROVE I'M A HEALER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE WERE LOST, WE WERE SINNERS IN the world. We didn't care. &gt;&gt; I hate to remember that one time I was not interested in reading the Bible. as a young young little thing if I could get a a just a page of the Bible I said no I'm not going to read this it made me think you know and you know but the Lord loved me so much even then &gt;&gt; I was NOT SAVED &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; HE WAS a savior &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he had that attribute in him of being a savior &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but if I wasn't lost how would we show how would he prove prove that he is a savior. &gt;&gt; He had to have me lost so that he can say he can prove himself that he is a savior. &gt;&gt; So that I CAN BE THANKFUL AND SAID I THANK YOU LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I will carry on. Now, brother Paul here says, "Therefore, living the principles of the doctrine of Christ, &gt;&gt; let us go on unto love." &gt;&gt; Yes. unto that 11th commandment &gt;&gt; unto the commandment that the Lord added, the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, "Now, not laying again the foundation of repentance &gt;&gt; from the dead works and of faith toward God, &gt;&gt; right? of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment. &gt;&gt; You might think that these are not important anymore. But that's not what the scripture is saying here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul is encouraging us to grow a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grow up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. But these are very important because in verse three he says and this will we do if God permits. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now listen here brother and sister I I really want to continue until we get to where we see now that by God's grace we are getting into this perfect love. We're getting to this place now. [clears throat] I I will read a few quotes of brother Brennan about two or three of them. In the in the message spiritual amnesia &gt;&gt; 640411 I read uh paragraph 200 here bra is talking to some person and this guy or lady or whoever it was says to him and he said them people why don't you teach them women how to to have great spiritual gifts &gt;&gt; and help people instead of trying to he said they regard you as a prophetam says I don't call myself a prophet &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but this person says to him they regard you as their prophet &gt;&gt; they will listen to you why don't you teach them &gt;&gt; to have spiritual gifts great gifts and be a help to the people &gt;&gt; instead of what he says h listen to this one instead of always condemning them. &gt;&gt; Now what what this person was calling condemnation to the people was not condemning the people. &gt;&gt; It was helping the people. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was setting up of the principles. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They were in the beginning. You will hear what Raenham says here. But to the other person, HE THOUGHT HE WAS CONDEMNING THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; How couldam condemn the people because he loved the people so much. &gt;&gt; He had that love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't condemn nobody. &gt;&gt; But he didn't compromise when it came to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought the word as it is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; In order to help me, in order to help you, &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO HELP EVERYONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO to the other people, it was like condemning them. Why do you condemn them? Why do you con teach them great gifts? How to help people, how to be to have spiritual gifts, gifts, speak in tongues and do all those type of things. But now &gt;&gt; listen to I want us to go to this condemnation. What they call condemnation here. This person called condemnation. How was condemning the people? Yes. Yes. You hear this one condemning them because brother Brennan was teaching them how to dress. &gt;&gt; You see, you know, he teaches you how to dress nicely. You know, he'll talk to you until you understand it &gt;&gt; and tell you that being a man, you know, a believer, you cannot go around in your shorts &gt;&gt; and show out your that's how he puts it, your dirtiness, [laughter] shows out his daddies. You can't do that. And he tells you that as a sister, you have to keep your hair long. You know, you you have to cut cut your hair. He tells you how to dress. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that type of a thing. And he says he and brother it feels like condemnation sometimes. He would say he puts her under that's the shorts for a man and he says she puts his &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you know he he his u long pants and that type of a thing. He says he tried to put everyone in his own little, &gt;&gt; you know, rightful place. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; let me put it that way. And he carries on and until you learn, he teaches you that you mustn't be late for church. He teaches you that you must help your pastor, help your neighbor. And he teaches all those kind of things. And the people ARE IN SUCH A HURRY. THEY SAY, "NO, YOU DELAY THEM. &gt;&gt; Teach them the spiritual gifts. Teach them the the the great things. You delay them. You delay this bill. Brother Brennham says, listen to this one. In the same quote, he says, &gt;&gt; I said, how can I teach them algebra? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; When they won't even learn their ABCs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the ABCs is like in Hebrew they say it's alf b because the Hebrew letters start with an alf bait dallet kiml hey and it carries on you know that is the ABCs alf bait &gt;&gt; so they they they must they must know they are they are ABCs first that's wheream was starting with the ABCs and as he get on with the ABCs he says You've GOT START TO START FROM THE BOTTOM. And now he comes very harsh. HE SAYS REPENT OR PERISH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He says now you can suit yourself if you want to repent or perish. He says Jesus Christ has thoroughly identified himself here &gt;&gt; night after night. Brother where the Lord would heal the sick. The Lord would you know in descentment would tell you where's brother Peter? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean I love to hear the testimonies that you know where he talked to him and talk to him. But anyway the Lord was performing some marvelous works. the Lord each night he he was you know showing the people how great he is what marvelous works he did through the prophet &gt;&gt; I tell you my brother and brother Brennham says now if you see that you have to repent if you don't repent you perish so night after night and uh it's just a few steps now and he says I got he's got plenty of time. Now that is where I say it's the principles where he tells you of repentance &gt;&gt; from the dead works, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Where he tells you about baptisms. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where he tells you about the laying on of hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and carries on like it's just the principles you still have to grow. &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] Lord help me here. You know what? When if anyone I know in this church in the inner message church the word of God in in its fullness is brought out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And uh even the people that don't come to this church, they know that you do baptize in this church. &gt;&gt; And many of them know that you you baptize differently. &gt;&gt; Mhm. from how they baptize out there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We have people that will visit the church and will come to church and they will know everything. They will know that even if they want to force him or her to be baptized out there, he says, "No, no, I won't be baptized here. I KNOW WHERE I WANT TO GO." AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF I WANT TO get the right baptism. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the baptism that is given here is the only Christian baptism. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT ONE IS in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why would say to the people, IF YOU'RE NOT BAPTIZED, BE BAPTIZED. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; Some will would be young people that grew up in church. Some they don't make a move. &gt;&gt; They just sit there. They just sitting for the sake of sitting, brother. &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO BE BAPTIZED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And they know that they're going to be baptized. But brother Paul says what I like with him, he's not pointing to the next person and saying you. He says we &gt;&gt; he includes himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must go on now. Go on unto perfection. &gt;&gt; Yes. Living those principles of the laying on of hands, of the baptism, of the repentance from the dead works. Now we on the road. We want to grow. We want to to go up. Now brother, sister, he says they have learned first. They must learn their ABCs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I believe you've been through your ABCs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when the church starts, you know how to press, you know, in order to to to show us that really brother could teach those ABCs. I don't know here in other places you find people that are not coming to church anymore. Some are just you know grown weak and uh some are in a so-called backslided backslitting condition right &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; but believe you me &gt;&gt; those people though they don't come to church they have learned their ABC so well &gt;&gt; that they conduct themselves like they're coming to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, in my area, there's young sisters. One of one that I know that is not coming to church anymore, but she dresses like he's coming to church. She doesn't cut her hair. She doesn't. A lot of things when you look at her, you think he was in church yesterday. &gt;&gt; It's good. &gt;&gt; Only to find out he hasn't she hasn't been to church for 3 years or so. &gt;&gt; But she learned her ABC so well. Mhm. &gt;&gt; that no she she can't dress the way she used to before. She can't cut her hair. She she behaves. She she she she behaves herself. She will talk to you and say sister, brother, pastor and you know but then brother that is not enough. The Lord wants us as Paul puts it now to go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go on. &gt;&gt; Go on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Go on until WE WE REACH THAT perfect love. &gt;&gt; Until until we reach that &gt;&gt; that 11th commandment, &gt;&gt; that new commandment the Lord is talking about here. But I will I will show us here. Let us read from the same book of Hebrews as we grow. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brennan, I will read from the fifth chapter. You you can hold that. Brother says, "A person should have a purpose in life." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We should have a purpose in life. We shouldn't be just We don't know why we here. &gt;&gt; We don't know where we going, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We don't know why you attend church. We We should know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we going? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the message faith is our victory of 1958 104 paragraph 27 says it reminds me of one time I don't like to say this word but he was just a bum &gt;&gt; that came to the door. &gt;&gt; I like with the respect of brother Benham. People think was condemning them when he he doesn't even want to to to utter the word bum. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Referring to a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He respected people so much. But he says this gentleman came to his door. He says and he said could you give me a sandwich? I said certainly. Would you step in? And instead of making him a sandwich, Raenham goes an extra [clears throat] mile. He said, "I thought I'd fix him something to eat &gt;&gt; and fix him up just about what I could get around in the place and sit him down to eat." &gt;&gt; And while he was eating, I thought I would speak to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Seeing he was a traveler, I said, "Where did you come from?" And the answer he says he just shrug his shrugged his shoulders a little said no way. &gt;&gt; And Bra said I said then where are you going? &gt;&gt; And he stopped eating. He looked up at me and said no way. He looked around and swallowed a big bite and said, "Sir, just where my heads rest, that there is where I rest." &gt;&gt; Now, says, and I said, "How long have you been doing this?" He said, "Oh, some 20 years or more." He had no ambition &gt;&gt; to better himself. Now that's just about the attitude of the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Says brother just what I call these people. He says he call them drifters, floaters. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the people who join the church is just about the same. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They join the church. &gt;&gt; They don't take the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They just drift us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says, I've often thought of floating driftwood. A driftwood is just hands up in any kind of trash. But brother, thank God for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank God for you, sister, that you not just drifting about. You have a purpose in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a purpose in life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If brother Paul says, "LET US GO ON." YOU WANT TO GO ON. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE TIME IS LATER THAN WE THINK. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND OUR LORD IS COMING BACK. HE'S NOT coming back for drifters. is not coming back for people that wants to sit and not carry on. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE MUST CARRY ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE MUST GET TO THAT LOVE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WE MUST GET TO THAT PLACE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHERE THE people look and say, but you are one of them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you say to yourself, "No, I've been there only a week." But the person looks at you and say, "You're one of them." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He looks at you and he says, "YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. I CAN SEE YOU'RE ONE OF THEM." You know what, my brother, sister, We we we are growing. Let let me go back to the reading chapter 5 of the book of Hebrews. Bear with me. I'm reading a bit of lengthy scripture here. Maybe I'll just read from verse 5. Chapter 5 of the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Verse five. So also Christ glorified to himself, sorry, glorified not himself to be made high priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my son, today I have begotten thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As he saith also in another place, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melc. &gt;&gt; Now we talking about Jesus. The one who we follow, &gt;&gt; the one who says, "I'm I'm giving you a new commandment." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says, "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications," that's what he was doing when he was in the flesh. &gt;&gt; He was offering prayers and supplications. I looked up that word supplication. It says a deep heartfelt humble prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we as Christians maybe we we don't do that but our Lord when he was in the flesh like us that's what he did. &gt;&gt; Yes. He would be praying. The scripture doesn't shy saying with prayers and supplications with strong crying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now if your person cried in church, some people look around and think, "Hey, what's happening?

Last time when I was here in 2023, I had a couple of sheep, but when I got back home, they stole four of my sheep. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; my heart was so sore when they stole four of my sheep. But with those little lambs, you don't find a lamb telling you, "Now my owner, come and get me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you don't come and get me, I complain against you. &gt;&gt; But with us, &gt;&gt; the lamb, the lambs of the Lord, we complain a lot. &gt;&gt; We say they don't come.

The scripture says sometimes we d of hearing &gt;&gt; meaning that our ears are not sharp to catch that blessing &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; to catch that revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Lord help us.

They're not sharp to catch the things of God. &gt;&gt; So he's got so much for us, but we must sharpen our ears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must. And then he carries on. He says, "For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again." &gt;&gt; Which be the first principles of the oracles of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why he says, "Let's go on now." &gt;&gt; Yes.

It was 1964 and now we are how many years from then? &gt;&gt; So many &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we are in 2025 now. &gt;&gt; So from that time on the Bible says we ought to be teachers now. &gt;&gt; Amen. to teach other people.

Let him talk to a young sister here in the church &gt;&gt; and that bishop or that whoever cardinal whatever he is, you will end up saying, "Hey, you show respect to me. You are too young to talk to me like that." Because the the people here they know the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They know we are teachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says you should be teaching the others. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come to church once your next door neighbor you could TEACH THEM. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COMING TO CHURCH FOR A WEEK.

We We are growing into that love, THAT PERFECT LOVE. I WAS THINKING now where brother Brennham says God heals. &gt;&gt; Going back to that one, he says God heals through prayer. Yes. &gt;&gt; God heals through music. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE'S SINGING. He says, "God will heal through love." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL HEAL you &gt;&gt; in many ways. My dear brother and sister, &gt;&gt; we come in here. I know when I get out of this place, I WILL BE FEELING MUCH BETTER than when I came in. &gt;&gt; I'LL BE HEALED. HALLELUJAH. I would be feeling unhappy when I came in. I don't know what obstacles I went you went through when you were coming in but on your way out you should be glad that Holy Spirit should be just you know giving you all the joy &gt;&gt; all the joy you rejoice my BROTHER SAID IT'S JUBILEE ALL THE way &gt;&gt; hallelujah you rejoice in the Lord &gt;&gt; amen praise the Lord &gt;&gt; I have read all what I wanted to read from here but we can carry on a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't know how long. Can I carry on? &gt;&gt; Go right ahead. &gt;&gt; Just a little bit. Just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To encourage us. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; You know where when when you come to the house of the Lord, my brother, my sister, I read another quote here, brother Brennham, in the message faith is our victory 58104 paragraph 43. He says, "I was reading old uncle Robertson's life story some time ago." &gt;&gt; And he says this brother Robinson, he says, "And he was such a great man and a loving man." A loving man. God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be loving people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he was a man of faith. this old man and he got to hungering for the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He became so hungry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For the Holy Spirit because the Bible taught it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She could have it. He can have it. I can have it. The little one can have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. So this old man got so hungry for the Holy Ghost and it says that one day he was plowing corn on the farm there and he stopped his old mule, the one that he was using for a while plowing. The name of the m is Alex. &gt;&gt; Says stop Alex one way and he got down in the cornrow. You know at work, at school, wherever you are, there's times when you feel like talking to your Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. At a place of work where I used to work in Johannesburg years ago, my one Jewish brother by the name of Benjamin Goldberg, he believed the message and yet he was a Jew &gt;&gt; and he said, "I'm double portioned because my name is Benjamin." &gt;&gt; If I don't make it with the Jews, I'll make it in the rapture [laughter] with the Gentiles. So he believed the message and he would be he GET SO EXCITED AT WORK, HE WOULD SHOUT, "HALLELUJAH! AMEN. HALLELUJAH." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Carrying on like that. And the other guys would ask the boss as what's wrong with you, Benny? &gt;&gt; He says, "I'M A CHILD OF GOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the boss says, "The only thing with you, you two, yourself and Zeff think you are the only two children of God here." He says, "Yeah, we can all be children of God, but it depends. It might be the same mother, different fathers." Yeah, [laughter] &gt;&gt; that's Benny to that guy, you know, he's talking about Abel and Cain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, THERE'S TIME YOU YOU JUST FEEL, you know, now it's time to talk to the Lord. It's time to to praise him. And this old brother here, he stops Alex one side and got down into the cornrow, the cornrow and said, "GOD, IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU COME BACK TO EARTH, &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; YOU WILL FIND MY bones laying right here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will pray. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Until I get that Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because why? Right. &gt;&gt; He's growing into that new commandment. &gt;&gt; HE'S GROWING INTO THAT LOVE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; He's forgetting those principles and that we will do if the Lord permit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We'll preach water baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll preach repentance. WE'LL LAY HANDS on the sick. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the way, WE JUST SAY A WORD AND A person recovers. &gt;&gt; Yes. I think there's a there's a story that I got just before I I came over and this at this neighborhood a man got sick, a man that I know. So I heard he was sick. He was in hospital and I went to visit this man. He he doesn't worship in the message. He's I'd say he's not a believer. So I went in his house to see him. And he says, "Hey, brother Seth, I I didn't know that death was so close to a person. &gt;&gt; I literally died." &gt;&gt; I said, "What happened?" He said, "I felt a pain in my chest and as I was trying to cough out, then there came out blood. I threw up blood and I I collapsed and I was gone." &gt;&gt; And then I asked him what happened. He says your brother in the message brother Gideon over here I'm told he came OVER HE SAYS I WAS GONE I'M TOLD BROTHER GIDEON CAME OVER AND HE PRAYED OVER ME &gt;&gt; AND HERE AM I &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I thought Jesus you can ask him I don't KNOW I WAS OUT I WAS GONE AND THAT BROTHER CAME OVER AND HE PRAYED OVER ME HERE am I &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I said praise God &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; a few days after that I went and saw Brother Gideon, you know what we do, brother? Just like you &gt;&gt; jumping up and down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behind that pull pit. When I get to his home, my dear brother, we normally don't greet. If I greet I say hi and he says hi. We start talking the things of God. We start fellowshipping LIKE THAT AND I STAND UP. HE STANDS UP. I sit down. He stands up and we get on like that. And I said to him, "Brother, I hear that you went and prayed. Where did you hear that one from? Isaiah here from Lazarus. &gt;&gt; He just raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother, I don't know what happened there." He says, "I went in there and the man was gone. His wife was crying." And he says, "I tried to call." His name is Steedwell. He says, "We were calling him Steady, Steady, Steady. Steady was gone." &gt;&gt; He couldn't say anything. So he said, "I decided I'm going to pray. I took off my hat." He says by the time I took off my head the wife thought now I had given up that now he's gone. &gt;&gt; She started you know crying or something &gt;&gt; and then he says I prayed I prayed when I prayed as I was leaving him laying there on the bed says he started coughing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No. &gt;&gt; So this old brother said, "Lord, if you don't give me the Holy Spirit when you come back to the earth, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; you'll find my bones laying right here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "That's having purpose in heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's really getting to business." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get that kind of a purpose in your heart, God is going to open the windows of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Something has to take place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You get to to get to business with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And have some purpose &gt;&gt; and some gratitude for him saving you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have that my dear brother. &gt;&gt; I was thinking I stop shortly. I was thinking if you have that presence around you that Holy Spirit I'm glad my brother when he prayed when he was opening the service in prayer he mentioned that our lord said where two or three &gt;&gt; are gathered in my name &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; there will I be amongst them &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; I was dead you know another thing brotherham says The devil counts his crowd. &gt;&gt; 1 2 3,000 2,000 a million. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; he weighs his church." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Outweighed in the balances. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And at found wanting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He weighs. &gt;&gt; It's not the the quantity, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's the quality &gt;&gt; that comes, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. So not only that, Rabam says to add to that scripture, he says every time we come and worship, Christ our Lord comes &gt;&gt; and walks between the aisles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says to my need, he says to your need, he says because we differ. &gt;&gt; He says to your need, he walks here between the aisles because that's what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's when we grow into that new commandment, &gt;&gt; right? Into that love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me read this one. Go with me to the book of Romans. Now, I think those are going to be the last few verses that we're going to read. The book of Romans, chapter 8. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just jump here. Take a verse here, a verse there. I read from verse one. There is therefore now no condemnation to them to them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't worry. They will say he he condemn you telling you how to dress telling you this is there's no condemnation in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; The Lord doesn't condemn you. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; If you be in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing you must walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must thank God. If there's that hunger in you, you hunger for that spirit. &gt;&gt; For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin. He condemn sin in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's what we we must do, brothers. Yes, sisters. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit, &gt;&gt; the things of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For to be cannally minded is death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to be spiritually minded is life and peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the cannal mind is enmity against God. For it is not subject to the law of God. Neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must get in the spirit so we can please God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit. If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. &gt;&gt; Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ. He is none of his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what matters. We should have the spirit of Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we are his. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody is going to take you in. Nobody is going to take you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have that spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; And if Christ be in you, the body is indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if the spirit of him that raised up Christ up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies. Yes. &gt;&gt; By his spirit that dwell in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean sister I mean when you have this spirit of God there is that presence I was saying around you &gt;&gt; there is that aura there's that holiness there's that peace &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; around you &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; today they have what they call hotspot I asked the pastor when I came in here to give me a hot spot &gt;&gt; so that I could be connected with the Wi-Fi. &gt;&gt; You know what? As a child of God, let them hot spot on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you there, peace is there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you there, &gt;&gt; you might not preach, but they feel that presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the Lord is there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's such kindness around you. They will even get healed from their diseases. Let them watch spot. Then should I should I say this one? I jumped into a taxi cab back home some years back in this taxi cab only to find I'm sitting next to this woman. I didn't know that she was a spiritualist witch doctor. &gt;&gt; I just sat there as I was sitting next to her and she start going &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I thought what's wrong? &gt;&gt; You're there. &gt;&gt; What's wrong? &gt;&gt; You're there. &gt;&gt; They say, "No, no, she's, you know, they have a term in my language." When one of them, you know, practices those kind of evil things. They say she's a white person. [laughter] They say she's white. They were saying she's white. I said, "So what? &gt;&gt; So what?" here. I'm sitting here. But I knew what was taking place because that evil spirit in her felt THAT THERE WAS A HOLY Spirit sitting NEXT TO THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND now she she was restless now that I'm there. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it happens, my brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, that Holy Spirit, that presence, the Lord goes with you. The Lord is with you. And brother, don't hesitate. Many times we think that we sisters cannot preach. The prophet said your place is in the kitchen. Is that so? &gt;&gt; So yes, he said so. But the same brother Brennham says when you hang on the washing IN YOUR BACKYARD, YOU CAN TESTIFY TO YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAYS YOU CAN TESTIFY TO THE MAN THAT COMES TO DELIVER MILK AT YOUR HOUSE. &gt;&gt; You you can't just keep quiet &gt;&gt; because there's so much life in you. Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's so much life. Now, um I think let me read the last one before I I I close one verse one in in chapter 8 of this book of uh uh Romans verse 14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. You must not fear but you have received the spirit of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has adopted us and made us his sons and daughters indeed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whereby we cry &gt;&gt; aba father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What aba means in Hebrew? Aba means father. means father. And to say my father, you say a &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; a and you say when when you you say you are my father, you say a &gt;&gt; you are my father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When when when we talk to him, we don't talk to him as mere creatures, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We talk to him as our own father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we were in him before we're in this flesh. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we are going back to him again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's coming for us, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's coming for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me close my Bible. Our Lord said, &gt;&gt; I give unto you a new commandment. &gt;&gt; Amen. this new commandment. I sometimes brother sister feel in the message that day on Calvary of 1960 0925 paragraph 27 says now watch Jesus watch how he stated Jesus he said the works that I do he's doing them when right now &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he says the works that I'm doing Now, healing the sick, raising the dead, open the eyes of the blind, these works shall you do also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll do this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you believe in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You do these works. And then a greater than this shall you do, for I go to be with the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prob and the world won't see me no more yet you shall see me. I will be with you even in you to the end of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will pray with the father. He will send you another comforter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is that perfect love, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who is that a love, that love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you another comforter, the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Whom the world cannot receive, &gt;&gt; yet you can receive him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again he goes on to say Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Whosoever sin you retain to them they are retained. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now here is where the Catholic Church and many others made their big mistake. They got out to say I forgive your sins. &gt;&gt; That wasn't it. That wasn't it. How did they forgive sins? They gave him the word of God. How did they forgive sins in the Bible? Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost. He said, they said, "What can we do to be saved?" &gt;&gt; He he said, &gt;&gt; "How can we get that you all got?" He laid down the the prescription. He told them, "Repent and be baptized &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, that is I think I will stop there. You know, I love the prophet so much. In the church age book, the very last paragraph, brother says, "Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me." &gt;&gt; Churches want followers. They want crowds. They want &gt;&gt; But That was not the prophet's intention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't want them to join my church. I don't want to start a fellowship or an organization. I have never done that and I will not do that now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have no interest in those things. But I do have an interest in the things of God. Yes. And people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. to know that brother that brother Brennham had that interest in the people in the things of God in the people. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; You know when he went over to our country, he knew all the tribes that we were that we are. &gt;&gt; He would just say, "Oh, I miss those people from South Africa." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He says, the Shangan because I'm closer the Zulu the Chonga &gt;&gt; and he's so interested in the people and one time you hear him saying oh I miss those colored people from South from South Africa &gt;&gt; and he goes in Africans he says when they prayus that's what I'm saying they say thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus in Africans &gt;&gt; so he carries on like that because he's so interested in the people. He wants to get whatever seed is still out there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, that's that's what we're here for. We're waiting for the last one to come and then we can go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's that's what we're waiting. And he even when was interested in the languages there, he says those African people say there's one word that ties them together. They have different languages. those um dialects. &gt;&gt; Dale. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says they but there's one one word that ties them together. He says that is um says you hear them that say that great umoya. So that great spirit that great umoya. How did he keep all those words was interested in the people and you find him going to Germany and he says those German they say Jesus for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus with dead feet. He goes over to Israel and he says, "Shalom." &gt;&gt; Which means peace. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Peace unto the bride. Shalom. &gt;&gt; And brother, sister, I love that. And I've never seen no man that speaks like that prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, sister, even [clears throat] the sayings, the the idioms, the you know, he would use things like how can you be half a goat and half a sheep? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't be drunk and sober at the same time. &gt;&gt; He says you can't be inside and outside the pawn SHOP AT THE SAME TIME. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He would say a river does not run up and down. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So we not running up and down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are focused, brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said there's no such a thing as a black and black white bed. &gt;&gt; He says there's you can't be a crow and a dove at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's brother Bren. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, you go serve the Lord. Help your brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, somebody said, "I don't want to be a liability in the church.
