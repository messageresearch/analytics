[43:36] ask your blessings again on in the name
[43:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[43:40] praise the Lord Genesis chapter one I
[43:44] will read the first couple of verses
[43:45] again in the beginning God created the
[43:48] Heaven and the Earth
[43:49] the Earth was without form and void and
[43:51] darknesses upon the face of the deep and
[43:53] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[43:56] the waters amen you could be seated if
[43:58] you'd like
[44:05] amen now I want to go to Genesis chapter
[44:06] 12. amen I started reading there again
[44:10] as I said uh we finished off last week
[44:12] with the feast days and the type of
[44:15] understanding of of what God's dealing
[44:19] with and doing with the Jews and what
[44:20] God's dealing with and doing with us
[44:22] Gentiles today and how the two frankly
[44:25] matched together to to some degree uh
[44:28] bribe going in a Rapture and at the end
[44:31] of the marriage supper Christ comes down
[44:33] and reveals himself to his people and
[44:35] they recognize what they had done at the
[44:38] end of the tribulation period uh and
[44:40] then we go from there of course to the
[44:42] Millennium but we're ending up in that
[44:44] new city that's again it's the focus
[44:46] that we're looking on for this series
[44:48] and the new beginning that new beginning
[44:50] really is uh there's the new beginnings
[44:54] that we keep talking about but the focus
[44:56] of the new beginning of this series of
[44:58] course is that City a man that New
[45:01] Jerusalem Revelation 21 that we'll end
[45:04] up to but I want to talk about our
[45:05] father of Faith Abraham today and
[45:08] Genesis 12 we'll begin our reading there
[45:11] let's go over to uh uh well let's just
[45:14] start with the first verse Genesis 12 1.
[45:17] God dealing with Abraham now listen now
[45:20] the Lord had uh now the Lord had said
[45:23] unto Abram get thee out of thy country
[45:26] and from my Kindred and from my father's
[45:28] house unto a land that I will show thee
[45:31] now can you imagine how miraculous this
[45:34] really is can you imagine how
[45:36] um uh how our faith-based this really is
[45:40] to understand that a voice that spoke to
[45:44] Abraham which if people today said they
[45:47] heard a voice they would give you a they
[45:49] would put you in something they'd give
[45:50] you a constant hug of yourself uh it's
[45:53] called a straight jacket you're
[45:54] continuously hugging yourself so they
[45:56] would think you're crazy rubber room
[45:58] because you're hearing voices well
[46:00] Abraham Abram heard this voice and God's
[46:03] speaking to him by faith Abraham
[46:06] believed that that voice was the
[46:08] almighty God even though he wasn't
[46:10] necessarily really raised that way he
[46:12] felt that that was the voice of God and
[46:14] now this voice is telling him to leave
[46:17] everything that was dear to him or
[46:19] almost everything everything that he
[46:21] loved lead your father leave your
[46:24] comfort zone get out of uh out of the
[46:28] comfort of your life there in your
[46:29] father's home and all that you have and
[46:31] all will find it's everything that
[46:33] you've got that you see that you do go I
[46:35] want you to leave and go someplace I got
[46:38] something for you amen now Abraham
[46:40] believed that and and as we will read
[46:43] Abraham obeyed that right and he went
[46:46] forth and left almost everything that he
[46:49] had looking to follow Christ now it
[46:53] finds it seems a rare thing today that
[46:55] people will forsake and leave everything
[46:58] or almost everything I took his wife and
[47:01] his nephew with him and servants and
[47:04] animals and things but his father the
[47:06] Comfort let's just put it that way the
[47:08] comfort of the life that came with Abram
[47:11] being in his father's house
[47:13] he had to lead that Comfort to go to
[47:16] follow Christ to go to follow the word
[47:19] to go to follow the command of God he
[47:22] had to leave that and a lot of people
[47:24] are very unwilling they're they're
[47:26] willing to say they're a Christian
[47:27] they're willing to go to church they're
[47:30] willing to do the semantics and the
[47:32] religious rights that we uh that that
[47:35] the scripture that we afford that we do
[47:37] but they're unwilling to relinquish
[47:40] everything that they have and obedience
[47:43] to what God's word would tell them
[47:45] Abraham was willing to do that by faith
[47:48] he did it amen and we know that the only
[47:51] way that we can serve God that we can
[47:53] please God Is by faith yes so sometimes
[47:56] it takes us in serving God I know this
[47:59] may bite but sometimes it's serving God
[48:02] it takes us out of our comfort zone
[48:05] it takes us away from now sometimes you
[48:09] may be in the same place you may be in
[48:11] the same surroundings but something will
[48:13] happen to make your life uneasy to make
[48:17] your life uncomfortable to make your
[48:19] life sometimes even
[48:21] I could say the word miserable to the
[48:24] human flesh but God is working a greater
[48:27] purpose than every one of our Lives God
[48:30] is working a greater work for us so that
[48:33] we become like him and sometimes it
[48:36] takes that adversity to put us in that
[48:39] place yes and that's what God is
[48:41] expecting of Abraham and if God was
[48:43] expecting that of Abraham here as we
[48:45] read this he's expecting that of us
[48:47] today he's expecting us
[48:50] many times to get out of our comfort
[48:53] zone to lead the things that that seem
[48:56] to be that that the Comforts of the
[48:58] world and the Comforts of humanity in
[49:01] the Comforts of life to follow Jesus
[49:03] Christ yes he did it he left all this
[49:07] because God told him now
[49:09] recognize this this is a God not unlike
[49:13] us
[49:14] that Abraham had never seen
[49:17] Abraham didn't have pictures hanging on
[49:19] his wall
[49:20] he had never seen this God
[49:23] this God didn't even tell him who he was
[49:26] yellow him
[49:28] he's the old Shaddai he's I mean how
[49:31] many uh
[49:32] Jehovah-jireh titles that that were
[49:35] given to Abraham but Abraham didn't he
[49:39] didn't see him it wasn't something
[49:41] tangible it wasn't something he could he
[49:45] could feel or touch or see but he still
[49:48] believed it he still believed him
[49:51] because he is something inside of
[49:53] Abraham that called to him when that
[49:56] voice spoke and again not unlike today
[49:59] in each one of the Believers each one of
[50:03] God's children just like that little
[50:05] Eagles story there's something that's
[50:07] inside when that cry Goes Forth that
[50:10] rings out to that that responds to that
[50:12] cry very much the deep cause of the deep
[50:15] when Mama eagle flew over a little baby
[50:18] might have been hatched in the chicken
[50:20] yard but when she heard that screaming
[50:22] witnessed to her heart to that little
[50:25] eaglet it witnessed to him and said now
[50:27] that sounds more like something I
[50:30] identify with right I don't identify
[50:33] with the world I don't identify with the
[50:35] things of the world I've been
[50:36] uncomfortable here for years so many
[50:38] times that's what drowned themselves in
[50:40] tobacco and alcohol and drugs and
[50:43] illicit living and gambling and all the
[50:45] things that the life tries to to hide
[50:47] and to push all that down but inside
[50:50] there of God's children
[50:52] when that cry Goes Forth there's
[50:54] something that responds to that very
[50:56] much and Abraham had that responder that
[50:59] that responded to the voice of God when
[51:02] God spoke to him
[51:04] it's time to move
[51:05] it's time to get out of your comfort
[51:07] zone it's time that the Eagles pulling
[51:09] out all the stuffing from the nest and
[51:12] the little eaglets starting to sit down
[51:13] on a big Thorn and say oh this isn't as
[51:16] comfortable as it used to be this
[51:19] doesn't feel as good as it used to be
[51:20] where's all my cushion gone no it's time
[51:22] for you to get out of this nest and go
[51:24] fly on your own yes because there's a
[51:27] purpose that God has God had a purpose
[51:30] for Abraham and so many times just as it
[51:33] is just as it was in brother Brown's
[51:35] life just as it wasn't Abraham's life
[51:38] just as it was in Moses like just like
[51:40] it was in Jesus Christ and so many of
[51:42] the men of God just like it is in our
[51:44] lives God used Abraham Abram as an
[51:48] example for us to read and look at today
[51:51] and be an example to us to see what God
[51:54] is doing what God is what God did what
[51:57] God is doing what God is going to do
[52:01] we're going to examine some of the doing
[52:02] and going to do today as we as we
[52:06] reflect on the Dead
[52:08] now God now the Lord said to Abraham let
[52:11] me read it again said unto Abram get out
[52:13] of thy country
[52:14] and from by Kendrick and from thy
[52:17] father's house into a land that I will
[52:19] show thee in other words just go just
[52:22] start walking I'll show you
[52:24] where am I going don't worry about that
[52:27] which direction I had don't worry
[52:31] I'll show it to you just keep you just
[52:33] walked I'll show you
[52:35] Prince that's hard
[52:37] yeah you think why Abraham's Abraham but
[52:39] that's hard he was a human being that's
[52:41] hard to do to think well but where am I
[52:43] going everybody wants this well what's
[52:45] going on what what's the end result
[52:46] where am I headed where am I going to
[52:48] end up well there may be uh uh
[52:52] thieves out there there may be murders
[52:54] out there that may be no just walk I'll
[52:56] take care of you I'll show you where to
[52:58] go you just start walking
[53:01] okay Lord
[53:03] uh I'll just do I'll just start walking
[53:07] and you know so many times it
[53:09] God just wants you to walk and you might
[53:12] think well is is is this going to happen
[53:15] well is this gonna be in the way is this
[53:18] don't worry about it I told you to walk
[53:20] just walk
[53:21] amen
[53:23] and I will make of thee now this is the
[53:25] promise
[53:27] I will make it thee a great nation and I
[53:29] will bless thee and make thy name great
[53:31] and thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[53:34] bless them that bless thee that same is
[53:38] to Israel same thing today whoever
[53:40] blesses Israel is blessed whoever curses
[53:43] Israel's curse I will bless them that
[53:45] bless thee and I will curse them that
[53:48] curse thee and then thee shall all
[53:51] families of the earth be blessed praise
[53:54] the Lord that's quite a promise amen
[53:57] as the sand of the sea as the stars of
[54:00] the sky it's a blessing but it's the
[54:03] promise but that's a but look
[54:05] the point I'm trying to make and I'll
[54:07] move on is that
[54:10] to
[54:11] to normal human thinking these are just
[54:15] words
[54:18] I I've had people make promises to me
[54:20] all the time and it never happened I've
[54:23] had people tell me all kinds of stuff of
[54:25] things that do this it never comes to
[54:27] pass never happens
[54:29] a lot of times if I ever see that person
[54:31] again they act like you know it never
[54:34] happened they never said it or their
[54:36] promise never existed or you know or all
[54:39] human these in the humanity these were
[54:42] these are just words
[54:43] so there had to be something beyond that
[54:46] for Abraham to respond
[54:48] I believe that when God tells me this
[54:51] it's going to happen he's going to do
[54:54] what he said he would do amen again
[54:57] the anchor is Faith only way is to be
[55:02] able to have faith to believe so Abram
[55:04] Departed
[55:06] as the Lord had spoke unto him and lot
[55:09] went with him and Abram was 70 and five
[55:12] years old
[55:13] when he departed out of Herod
[55:15] and Abram took Sarah his wife and lot
[55:19] his brother's son and all their
[55:21] substance that they had gathered and the
[55:23] souls that they had gotten in Herod and
[55:26] they went forth to go into the land of
[55:29] Canaan and into the land of Canaan they
[55:32] came
[55:33] as God showed him obviously and Abram
[55:37] passed through the land unto a place of
[55:39] shechem Unto the plain of Mora and the
[55:43] Canaanite was the Canaanite was in the
[55:46] was then in the land
[55:48] and the Lord appeared unto Abram and
[55:50] said unto thy seed will I give this land
[55:53] and they're building he an altar unto
[55:57] the Lord who appeared unto him and he
[56:00] removed from fence unto a mountain to
[56:03] the east of Bethel and pitched a tent
[56:05] having Bethel on the west and Ayah on
[56:08] the East and there he building an altar
[56:11] unto the Lord and called upon the name
[56:13] of the Lord worship amen worship by
[56:18] faith you always believe that Faith's
[56:20] got to be the anchor but the worship
[56:22] then comes he worship
[56:25] and Abram sojourned going on still
[56:28] toward the South now let's go to the
[56:30] book of faith Hebrews chapter 11.
[56:35] see where God recorded this event in
[56:39] Hebrews chapter 11 it's only a couple of
[56:40] verses right
[56:43] but it is very descriptive
[56:48] what was the point of it
[56:50] why was God sending him out you know the
[56:54] the bottom line of the faith
[56:58] the moving on the voice of God believing
[57:02] that when God speaks we act as he speaks
[57:05] to it but what would be the purpose
[57:09] because God does just God doesn't just
[57:13] willy-nilly do things he there's always
[57:15] a reason why God does things now we may
[57:18] not ever know those things it may be a
[57:21] while before we ever know those things
[57:22] or if we ever know him at all but God
[57:25] has a reason
[57:26] God has a purpose and he is mine he
[57:29] knows what he's doing and why he's doing
[57:30] it
[57:31] so we look at the story and then we go
[57:35] to Hebrews now of course there's a lot
[57:37] more to that story and we'll come back
[57:39] to Genesis before we end up this service
[57:40] but and there's a lot more of the story
[57:43] so if you go read it if you haven't
[57:44] already or re-familiarize yourself with
[57:47] it
[57:48] there's more to that story but
[57:51] the recordation of it by Hebrews
[57:56] gives a
[57:58] a a why if you will and it's and it and
[58:02] it's the why that I that we are focused
[58:06] on now that Y is really the purpose of
[58:10] this entire series let's read uh Hebrews
[58:14] chapter 11 verse 8.
[58:18] by faith
[58:19] Abraham when he was called to go out
[58:22] into a place which he should after
[58:25] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[58:28] went out not knowing whether he went but
[58:31] he did it by obedience remember
[58:33] obedience is better than sacrifice amen
[58:36] obedience
[58:38] by faith he uh by faith he sojourned in
[58:41] the land of promise
[58:43] as in a strange country dwelling in
[58:47] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[58:49] Heirs with him of the same promise now
[58:52] notice
[58:53] it's the land of promise
[58:55] it's the land that God gave him
[58:59] but yet he's still wandering around
[59:02] intense uh in a strange country
[59:06] like a stranger
[59:09] so Journey Like a Stranger in a land
[59:12] that God promised to give him
[59:15] if God promises to give you something
[59:17] friend it's as good as yours
[59:21] I don't care what a piece of paper says
[59:23] I don't care what anybody's opinion or a
[59:25] judge or a potentator anybody else says
[59:28] if God gave it to you it belongs to you
[59:30] it's yours
[59:32] amen that's how that's my approach to my
[59:34] family it they belong to me God give
[59:38] them to me didn't give them to the devil
[59:40] gave them to me don't belong to him
[59:42] don't belong to the world belong to me
[59:44] they're mine they're my possession
[59:47] but as he had that possession
[59:51] he still wandered around as a stranger
[59:52] right like a Sojourner he's sojourned in
[59:55] this land as in a strange country it was
[59:58] his God gave it to him it's yours but he
[1:00:01] still wondered
[1:00:03] amen why did he wander look at this
[1:00:06] in a strange country dwelling in
[1:00:08] Tabernacles Isaac Jacob The Heirs of the
[1:00:10] same promise for he looked
[1:00:13] Abraham's looking for a city which had
[1:00:17] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:00:20] God
[1:00:22] that's why he was so unsettled
[1:00:24] that's why I continued even though he
[1:00:27] was in the land of promise that's why he
[1:00:29] continued to sojourn around and
[1:00:30] Tabernacles and temples and uh
[1:00:33] Tabernacles and sojourning and houses
[1:00:35] and Tents because he's looking for this
[1:00:37] city
[1:00:38] he's in the promised land but he's still
[1:00:41] looking for that City
[1:00:43] amen look friend we may be in our
[1:00:46] Promised Land which is the Holy Ghost
[1:00:48] amen and if you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:00:50] are because the Holy Ghost is our
[1:00:53] Promised Land amen but you're still
[1:00:55] lucky
[1:00:56] you're still so Journey yes you're still
[1:00:59] wandering around because this place is
[1:01:01] not home even though this Earth is
[1:01:05] exactly where we're going to live
[1:01:08] you get it but still wandering around
[1:01:12] so Journey like a soldier this this
[1:01:15] world is not my home this place doesn't
[1:01:17] this is not mine this this is the
[1:01:20] inheritance of the devil amen all this
[1:01:23] atmosphere not the Earth but the world
[1:01:25] the cosmos all the governments all the
[1:01:27] banks all the money all the everything
[1:01:29] that God blesses us with and we're
[1:01:31] thankful God gives us things that bless
[1:01:33] us like Micah said in his prayer but
[1:01:36] this world is not our home God just
[1:01:38] bless us to be able to have a place to
[1:01:40] live and have a place to stay in car
[1:01:42] driving job and money and things to
[1:01:45] provide to eat to live
[1:01:47] but this place is not our home amen even
[1:01:51] though we've received the promise we're
[1:01:52] in our Promised Land we're still so
[1:01:54] Journey as as strangers amen because we
[1:01:59] look around and we and and it's like
[1:02:02] I've told you before I go in and out
[1:02:04] airports all the time now I look at
[1:02:06] people all the time and I look and I
[1:02:08] think
[1:02:10] I I hope I pray some of these people
[1:02:13] have something inside them more than
[1:02:15] what I'm looking at I really do amen
[1:02:17] like the homeless people I I hope
[1:02:20] there's something more in there that I
[1:02:22] can't see right now that God knows that
[1:02:24] he sees but I look at this and I think I
[1:02:27] am the Oddball here
[1:02:29] I I'm this Earth belongs to me
[1:02:33] Jesus brought it back bought his bought
[1:02:35] it back with his own blood and now it's
[1:02:37] our inheritance we're coming back to
[1:02:39] live on this Earth but this place is the
[1:02:41] I I don't fit in here very much I I
[1:02:45] stand out like a sore thumb and I'm a
[1:02:48] man in this message
[1:02:50] so if I'm a man of this message I think
[1:02:53] of how you sisters feel yesterday in
[1:02:55] Dallas I saw a woman in her in her
[1:02:58] little two three little girls walking
[1:03:00] down and that I'm sure they were message
[1:03:01] girls or Holiness anyway
[1:03:04] walking down uh you know where the gates
[1:03:08] are in the The Concourse there at the
[1:03:09] airport and I and I looked at them and I
[1:03:12] looked at everybody else and I thought
[1:03:13] my you could see them in a crowd of a
[1:03:17] thousand people walking from a mile away
[1:03:19] yes
[1:03:20] because that's how they stood out right
[1:03:22] right but they stood out in a good way
[1:03:25] I looked and think they don't belong
[1:03:27] here I sat there and I think I don't
[1:03:29] belong here let me read you this quote
[1:03:32] brother random said
[1:03:34] this is a a questions and answers I
[1:03:36] don't have the question I don't know
[1:03:38] what the question was
[1:03:41] but it's in questions and answers 1964.
[1:03:45] if you go on a logo look at it it's uh
[1:03:50] 1062-8 I don't know what that means one
[1:03:53] zero six two dash eight I guess that's
[1:03:54] the page number maybe and and the Cod
[1:03:57] book uh I'm not sure but it's questions
[1:04:00] and answers 1964.
[1:04:03] he said I he said and I'd advise anybody
[1:04:07] never be a rolling stone that's just
[1:04:10] somebody who's always uproot and moving
[1:04:13] and everything never be a rolling stone
[1:04:15] see less it's some kind of ministry that
[1:04:19] calls you to be that way
[1:04:21] because he said I'd give I I'd just give
[1:04:25] anything this morning if I had a place
[1:04:28] here on Earth that I could go and say
[1:04:31] this is home
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:36] I I would reiterate that for myself
[1:04:39] I mean I love my wife my children my
[1:04:41] grandchildren my family uh you know I I
[1:04:45] love you all I I enjoy living in Tucson
[1:04:50] still won't say love but I enjoy living
[1:04:53] in Tucson
[1:04:55] but there's there's just there's just
[1:04:57] just never been a home me and my wife
[1:05:01] were talking about it she even said
[1:05:02] yesterday she said I miss sometimes
[1:05:04] living around a lot of the greenery and
[1:05:06] you know you go over to a Greener but
[1:05:08] places got Greenery and I tell her I
[1:05:10] said well I miss you know having some
[1:05:11] water a body of water or something a big
[1:05:13] river or a ocean or something and we
[1:05:16] talk about that and as soon as you go to
[1:05:18] a place like that you're like oh man
[1:05:19] this is so humid goodness I hope and
[1:05:21] live here
[1:05:23] you think well maybe it wasn't so bad
[1:05:26] over there The Grass Is Always Greener
[1:05:28] but what it is this is just always
[1:05:30] there's just not that place brother
[1:05:31] Graham said I'd just give anything this
[1:05:34] morning if I had a place on Earth here
[1:05:36] that I could say this is home
[1:05:38] he said if I had it
[1:05:40] I'd give a million dollars this 1960
[1:05:44] . so a million dollars and 64. today a
[1:05:47] million dollars is like a thousand and
[1:05:49] you know people millionaires or a
[1:05:52] diamond does anymore I happen not to be
[1:05:54] one of them and none of us are but
[1:05:57] millionaires are uh like the grass
[1:06:01] in a place that has grass
[1:06:05] which we don't really have here so that
[1:06:08] analogy doesn't work very well here but
[1:06:10] it's like the sand of the scene stars of
[1:06:13] the sky and millionaires are all over
[1:06:15] the place now brother Graham said I'd
[1:06:17] give a million dollars if I had it
[1:06:20] if I had a place that I could say boy I
[1:06:23] just love this so well I don't ever want
[1:06:26] to leave it no more
[1:06:28] amen I feel the same way
[1:06:31] much as I love you all and love being
[1:06:33] here and my family amen
[1:06:36] it be that way
[1:06:39] he said
[1:06:41] I'd leave it no more he said I'd give
[1:06:43] anything he said but I just I just can't
[1:06:46] find it
[1:06:48] I'm I'm something like Abraham was I'm
[1:06:51] looking for a city see I can't find it
[1:06:54] but I know it's there
[1:06:56] but I certainly can't get adjusted to
[1:06:59] any certain place on this Earth I just
[1:07:01] don't uh it just doesn't look like
[1:07:04] fine people find places you go here it's
[1:07:08] too wet you go there it's too dry you go
[1:07:10] up there it's too cold you go down there
[1:07:12] it's too hot
[1:07:15] you see there's no place it just ain't
[1:07:18] home
[1:07:19] and it's just not just like here
[1:07:22] but just like him
[1:07:25] just like Abraham just like we are today
[1:07:28] our vision still it's not of this world
[1:07:31] it's not of this Cosmos our vision is on
[1:07:34] something that's greater
[1:07:35] we're looking for that City in my heart
[1:07:38] my heart knows it it's there
[1:07:41] amen Abraham went looking for it
[1:07:44] Abraham desired to get there we do today
[1:07:48] that's our vision we want to go that's
[1:07:51] it that City
[1:07:53] this place is not our home am I amen we
[1:07:57] may settle a little bit we may have a
[1:07:59] home we may have the things that we have
[1:08:01] and loved ones and family and friends
[1:08:03] and church and all that we've got and
[1:08:05] God blesses us with but this place just
[1:08:08] in home
[1:08:10] amen
[1:08:13] I look and I I used to told you before I
[1:08:16] you know you all know I drove Uber Lyft
[1:08:18] and I would always have people ask me
[1:08:21] especially if they were out of town pick
[1:08:23] them up a hotel or something came to the
[1:08:25] airport how do you like living in Tucson
[1:08:28] I said well I'm not from Tucson I'm from
[1:08:30] North Carolina well which do you like
[1:08:31] better I said and six and one half does
[1:08:34] the other there's good bad see it
[1:08:36] there's goods and bads to here there's
[1:08:37] goods and bats and we lived in St
[1:08:39] Augustine there's good and bad to every
[1:08:40] place
[1:08:41] it just depends on I said it now if if
[1:08:44] you really have to live by a big body of
[1:08:47] water don't live in Tucson
[1:08:49] amen if you hate the humidity
[1:08:54] Tucson's a great place to live
[1:08:56] amen if you like you know beautiful
[1:08:59] weather nine months out of the year or
[1:09:00] two it's not in a good place
[1:09:02] last Friday we were up in Minnesota
[1:09:04] again Minneapolis the high I think was
[1:09:07] 45.
[1:09:08] wind was blowing spitting a little rain
[1:09:11] and cloudy
[1:09:13] it was cold
[1:09:16] uh we went downstairs that morning and
[1:09:18] we have our little breakfast and they
[1:09:20] have a couple of monitors up and they
[1:09:21] had the news over there local news and I
[1:09:24] looked over the weather comes on and on
[1:09:26] the on Friday this was like Wednesday or
[1:09:29] Thursday on Friday they had the word
[1:09:30] chili
[1:09:32] chili 45 is not chilly 45 is cold yes
[1:09:39] especially when the wind is up and the
[1:09:43] rain's coming it's cold not chilly but I
[1:09:46] guess to those people up there it's it's
[1:09:48] chilly I don't know if it's zero cold
[1:09:49] but this place is just not home right
[1:09:53] too cold too hot although I would rather
[1:09:56] work in the cold than the hot when I'm
[1:09:59] out in labor I'd rather it be cold than
[1:10:01] hot but it's just just not our home
[1:10:04] it wasn't Abraham's he went to the land
[1:10:07] God showed him but he's sojourning
[1:10:09] around like he's in a strange place and
[1:10:12] it belonged to him
[1:10:14] it belongs to us but
[1:10:17] We Were Strangers and we are
[1:10:19] we are but when it's all burned off and
[1:10:22] God gets rid of rid of Cosmos this world
[1:10:24] order God will set up his own kingdom
[1:10:27] here amen God will set up his own
[1:10:29] kingdom here and it'll be a kingdom of
[1:10:31] righteousness praise the Lord but keep
[1:10:33] in mind now Abraham went looking for
[1:10:36] that City whose Builder and maker was
[1:10:38] God
[1:10:39] you know the strange thing is
[1:10:42] found it and you didn't even know it
[1:10:45] Abraham founded and he didn't even know
[1:10:48] it not at the time
[1:10:50] and not until a prophet came for this
[1:10:53] day called William Branham did anybody
[1:10:56] know that Abraham found that
[1:10:59] amen let's read Genesis chapter 14.
[1:11:06] he found that City
[1:11:08] praise the Lord amen that City that
[1:11:12] bride is adorned for her husband yes
[1:11:15] coming together
[1:11:18] the meeting place
[1:11:21] look at
[1:11:24] Abraham
[1:11:26] Abram
[1:11:27] now as As We Know The Story Goes uh
[1:11:32] these Kings come in from the different
[1:11:34] cities towns and they come and they take
[1:11:37] over Sodom and Gomorrah they spoil the
[1:11:39] place
[1:11:41] but the worst mistake they made was they
[1:11:43] took block and his family
[1:11:46] as prisoners
[1:11:48] slaves doesn't say but they took lot and
[1:11:53] when they took lot they took Abraham's
[1:11:55] possession
[1:11:57] they could have took anything and saw
[1:11:59] them they wanted to and it wouldn't have
[1:12:00] mattered
[1:12:01] but a but lot belonged to Abraham
[1:12:05] and when lot when a man came and that
[1:12:08] was uh that came out alive
[1:12:11] that got out of that place and when told
[1:12:14] Abraham said Abraham this happened they
[1:12:16] got locked like Abraham looked he said
[1:12:19] God he said you told me to look north
[1:12:22] south east and west and wherever I go
[1:12:24] it's mine a lot is mine and I'm gonna go
[1:12:26] get him
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] Lord is mine that's the worst mistake
[1:12:31] this Kings made was taking lot because
[1:12:34] then they got Abraham's possession
[1:12:37] lot belonged to Abraham and Abraham said
[1:12:41] he belongs to me and I'm gonna go get
[1:12:43] him everybody praise the Lord and he did
[1:12:46] now look at this triumphant Prophet
[1:12:48] let's start uh uh word Genesis 14.
[1:12:54] let's just start with verse 12. we'll
[1:12:56] kind of get in the middle of my my
[1:12:59] synopsis of the story here and they and
[1:13:02] again uh go go back recently realize
[1:13:06] yourself there's a lot more than what
[1:13:07] we're going to touch on today
[1:13:09] re-familiarize yourself with the story
[1:13:11] because when Abraham left home remember
[1:13:13] he took lot
[1:13:15] uh took his servants his uh his
[1:13:18] possessions cattle and everything and
[1:13:20] then lot in Abraham's herdsmen started
[1:13:23] uh conflicting and and getting into
[1:13:25] fights and uh they they were rubbing
[1:13:29] each other so uh Abraham said look it's
[1:13:32] it's not good for us to to have this
[1:13:34] contention he said lot you go look out
[1:13:38] wherever you want to go you just go but
[1:13:40] we need to separate
[1:13:42] and lot looked down and he saw the
[1:13:44] cities of Sodom and he decided to go
[1:13:47] down and Pitch his tit down there
[1:13:49] and that's where he was when Abraham got
[1:13:51] the word that lot had been captured by
[1:13:54] those kings that came in and spoiled
[1:13:56] Sodom and Gomorrah and took lot and his
[1:13:58] family
[1:14:00] and they took Lot 12 verse now Genesis
[1:14:03] 14 12. and they took a lot Abram's
[1:14:05] brother's son who dwelt and saw them and
[1:14:08] his goods and departed
[1:14:10] there came one that had escaped and told
[1:14:13] Abram the Hebrew
[1:14:15] for he dwelt in the plane of memory
[1:14:18] the Amorite brother of eschalk and
[1:14:21] brother of Aynor
[1:14:23] and they and these were Confederate with
[1:14:27] Abraham they were joined together
[1:14:30] allies
[1:14:32] and when Abram heard that his brother
[1:14:34] was taken was then taken captive he
[1:14:38] armed and trained his uh he armed his
[1:14:40] trained servants born in his own house
[1:14:44] 318 and pursued them unto Dan
[1:14:48] and he divided them against them he and
[1:14:52] his servants by night and smote them and
[1:14:54] pursued them unto hoba which is on the
[1:14:58] left hand uh left hand of Damascus
[1:15:01] and he brought back Abraham the
[1:15:03] Victorious Prophet now brought back
[1:15:08] um all the goods and also brought again
[1:15:11] his brother lot and his goods and the
[1:15:15] women also and the people
[1:15:18] so Abraham a rescued his possession he
[1:15:23] took back what belonged to him
[1:15:25] amen he didn't take anything more than
[1:15:28] what belonged to him he didn't take
[1:15:29] anything less but he took what belonged
[1:15:32] to him amen
[1:15:34] amen praise God
[1:15:35] it belongs to you you have a right to
[1:15:38] take it back and Satan has took it from
[1:15:40] you you have a right it belongs to you
[1:15:43] amen
[1:15:46] and he brought Abraham took them back
[1:15:48] and the king of Sodom went out to meet
[1:15:51] him after his return from the slaughter
[1:15:53] of uh uh say dorlemer of the kings that
[1:15:59] were with him at the valley of Sheba
[1:16:01] which is the King's Dale and Melchizedek
[1:16:06] amen here we go now Melchizedek king of
[1:16:09] Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and
[1:16:13] he was the priest of the most high God
[1:16:16] now we all know that through a prophet
[1:16:19] of this day a Vindicated word Prophet
[1:16:22] William Branham told us that that
[1:16:25] Melchizedek was God in flesh formed that
[1:16:28] then later became Jesus Christ yes amen
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:33] became in in that spirit in the body the
[1:16:37] Corporal body of Jesus Christ
[1:16:40] so
[1:16:41] when Abraham Abram met now kazadik he
[1:16:46] finally not realizing it but got a
[1:16:48] bodily form at least one of them of God
[1:16:52] there communing with him
[1:16:56] the
[1:16:58] the god of Heaven and Earth
[1:17:00] brought to his Victorious prophet
[1:17:03] communion
[1:17:06] praise the Lord they had communion
[1:17:09] just like we're going to have communion
[1:17:11] today yes they had communion Fellowship
[1:17:14] yes communion together conversing
[1:17:16] Fellowship
[1:17:18] we take the Lord's Supper based on of
[1:17:20] course the crust the crucifixion of
[1:17:22] Jesus Christ but Melchizedek himself God
[1:17:25] in in this bodily form brought wine and
[1:17:29] bread for him and Abraham to sit down
[1:17:31] and have communion together
[1:17:34] praise the Lord amen wonderful I believe
[1:17:37] he's meeting us here today too yes amen
[1:17:40] he's gonna he's here with us to do the
[1:17:43] same as he did here he met now Cassidy
[1:17:46] king of Salem king of Peace Salem
[1:17:49] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[1:17:52] the priest of the most high God go to
[1:17:54] you can go to Hebrews in several places
[1:17:58] and it refers to Melchizedek we had a
[1:18:00] little study on Melchizedek a year or so
[1:18:03] ago but it explains and tells us
[1:18:07] who this was that was meeting Abraham
[1:18:10] amen and he blessed him and said Blessed
[1:18:14] Be Abram of the most high god possessor
[1:18:18] of Heaven and Earth
[1:18:19] and blessed be the most high God which
[1:18:22] had delivered thine enemies into thy
[1:18:25] hand and he gave him Abraham Abram gave
[1:18:29] him Melchizedek tithes of all
[1:18:33] Abram paid Melchizedek
[1:18:37] God in bodily formed in Melchizedek ties
[1:18:41] of all that he possessed praise the Lord
[1:18:45] and the king of Sodom
[1:18:47] said unto Abram give me the persons and
[1:18:52] take the goods to thyself no no Abraham
[1:18:56] didn't go there to get rich
[1:18:58] Abraham didn't go there to get all the
[1:19:00] spoils of anybody any Nation any King he
[1:19:04] went there to gain back his possession
[1:19:07] and that was locked
[1:19:09] he got locked back that
[1:19:12] but the king of Sodom said now give me
[1:19:15] the persons and take all the goods you
[1:19:17] take all the spoils you won the battle
[1:19:19] you take all the spools and Abraham said
[1:19:22] to the king of Sodom I have lift up my
[1:19:25] hand unto the Lord the most high God the
[1:19:28] possessor of Heaven and Earth that I
[1:19:30] will not take of a friend even to a shoe
[1:19:34] latcher and that will not take anything
[1:19:36] that is done lest thou should say I have
[1:19:39] made Abram rich
[1:19:42] save only that which the young men have
[1:19:44] eaten and the portion of the men which
[1:19:46] with uh went with me uh aynar escal and
[1:19:51] and mammary
[1:19:52] uh let them take their portion but
[1:19:55] Abraham went for one thing and that was
[1:19:57] his possession and when he went now look
[1:20:00] where they are
[1:20:02] when he went he met Melchizedek he
[1:20:05] milked he met God
[1:20:07] he met the one that was to later become
[1:20:10] as we know Jesus Christ amen the same
[1:20:14] God same spirit that came in a bodily
[1:20:17] Corporal body of Jesus Christ Abraham
[1:20:20] met him right there so God look now God
[1:20:23] sent Abraham away from his home remember
[1:20:26] there's always the end goal there's
[1:20:29] always a purpose and a reason why God
[1:20:31] tells us we might not understand it
[1:20:33] might not ever know why but there's
[1:20:35] always a reason yes there's always a
[1:20:38] purpose amen amen my flight's got all
[1:20:42] mixed up yesterday
[1:20:44] my bags weren't delivered so I don't
[1:20:46] know what time they get there last night
[1:20:47] yeah she I went to bed like I was tired
[1:20:50] uh
[1:20:52] they got my bike my Banks got to the
[1:20:54] house last night at 10 o'clock
[1:20:56] because all this stuff going on and it's
[1:20:58] so easy and I did I honestly you get
[1:21:01] rattled get upset and things aren't
[1:21:03] going right you're exhausted and tired
[1:21:05] and worked a hard 70 hour a week and you
[1:21:07] got four hours sleep the night before it
[1:21:10] just you know your flesh is weak that's
[1:21:13] when Satan wants to attack the most yes
[1:21:15] but there was a reason for it I don't
[1:21:18] know I sat on I ended up sitting in a
[1:21:21] middle seat which I have never done and
[1:21:24] absolutely hate
[1:21:25] I sat in a metal middle seat from
[1:21:28] Minneapolis to Dallas but I sat next to
[1:21:30] a guy that we didn't do nothing but talk
[1:21:32] the the entire flight and even after we
[1:21:35] got off the plane
[1:21:37] whatever will come of it I don't know
[1:21:40] why all that happened I don't know
[1:21:43] but there's a reason
[1:21:45] God Did It for a reason when your spirit
[1:21:48] gets settled down and you get to a place
[1:21:50] you think God whatever purpose and
[1:21:53] reason that was
[1:21:56] so be it unto me amen amen why have you
[1:21:59] did that I don't know we we got on the
[1:22:02] plane in Minneapolis and we pulled away
[1:22:05] from the gate in this you know they push
[1:22:06] you with those things and we started to
[1:22:08] turn it was a loud pop on the plane we
[1:22:11] turned around and sat there and and the
[1:22:13] captain we just sat there and sat there
[1:22:15] and the captains came on and said you
[1:22:16] may didn't realize the recognizing we
[1:22:18] just been sitting here a while a while
[1:22:20] but we heard that loud pop as you
[1:22:22] probably all heard and we don't know
[1:22:23] what that is I said then you can get me
[1:22:25] off this plane
[1:22:28] we're gonna turn around we're gonna go
[1:22:30] back to the gate and inspect it not a
[1:22:32] problem with me
[1:22:33] so they go back and it's wow this is
[1:22:36] going to take a while and it was it was
[1:22:38] 6 30 in the morning uh in Minneapolis
[1:22:41] and they came back and said well the
[1:22:45] mechanic said of abundance of caution
[1:22:47] we're just going to delay it and it was
[1:22:49] like two o'clock I think it actually
[1:22:50] finally left so I ended up getting on
[1:22:52] another plane going to Dallas it was
[1:22:53] just two gates over that left at 8 11.
[1:22:57] um and why I don't know why there was a
[1:22:59] pop you know it probably was absolutely
[1:23:01] nothing I'll never know if it was
[1:23:03] anything wrong with mechanically wrong
[1:23:05] with the plane but it doesn't matter
[1:23:07] there's a reason for it and as a as a
[1:23:10] child of God you recognize
[1:23:12] God may have purposely listen this is
[1:23:16] gonna this may sound a little arrogant
[1:23:18] friends but God will purposely disrupt
[1:23:22] 250 people's lives just because of you
[1:23:25] right amen just because he wants you at
[1:23:28] a certain place at a certain time with a
[1:23:30] certain person or whatever God will
[1:23:32] absolutely turn 250 people's lives
[1:23:35] upside down because they're all
[1:23:36] scrambling fortunately I had uh uh
[1:23:39] purchased first class I had you know a
[1:23:41] little upgrade so I got off the plane
[1:23:43] immediately uh when that happened and I
[1:23:46] was at the ticket gate first to get my
[1:23:48] arrangements but I'm I'm done with my
[1:23:51] arrangements and people in the back of a
[1:23:52] plane are still getting off I don't know
[1:23:53] what those people did there's no way
[1:23:55] they got on the plane I got on
[1:23:57] but God would have disrupted all those
[1:24:00] people's lives I don't know what they
[1:24:01] did where they went where they ended up
[1:24:03] I don't know but all those lives
[1:24:04] disrupted just because of me
[1:24:07] just because God wants me to do
[1:24:09] something whatever it was I don't know I
[1:24:11] mean you think that's crazy well God
[1:24:13] landed an entire plane for how long for
[1:24:15] brother Brown to go see a widow woman
[1:24:17] about her son yeah
[1:24:19] grounded that plan for we don't know how
[1:24:21] long
[1:24:22] and brother Rams going around saying
[1:24:24] well I'm sure I missed my plan I'm sure
[1:24:26] my plank they held the plane just for
[1:24:29] him right
[1:24:31] now they didn't hold it just for him
[1:24:33] they don't know that they held it just
[1:24:35] for him but they held it just for him
[1:24:37] because God said so yes
[1:24:39] you don't know
[1:24:40] why God does
[1:24:43] but God always has a reason yeah there's
[1:24:46] always an in-purpose and goal amen that
[1:24:49] God has in his mind and whatever he does
[1:24:51] with us there's always a reason there
[1:24:53] was a reason why God did this with
[1:24:55] Abraham there's a reason why God sent
[1:24:58] him out from everything he loved to go
[1:25:01] find a land that he may not have even
[1:25:03] known existed and when he got there he
[1:25:06] felt like a total stranger but yet God
[1:25:09] had him go
[1:25:13] had the herdsmen
[1:25:16] let's just make a synopsis here God had
[1:25:20] their herdsmen fight each other
[1:25:22] so that they could be separated so that
[1:25:25] lot would go down to Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:25:28] so that the Kings would come in and
[1:25:31] spoil Sodom and take lot just so Abraham
[1:25:34] would go down there and slaughter them
[1:25:37] and take lot back to himself so that he
[1:25:40] would meet Melchizedek amen
[1:25:43] Hallelujah
[1:25:45] explain that to me friends
[1:25:48] put some reasoning to that you can't do
[1:25:51] it it's just God's purpose and reason
[1:25:54] that he has for his children and God had
[1:25:57] there the reason that he sent him out
[1:26:00] from his dad and from his family and
[1:26:02] everything that was comfortable to it he
[1:26:04] was standing right there in the form of
[1:26:06] male president
[1:26:08] and Melchizedek brought him and had
[1:26:10] communion right there and Abraham paid
[1:26:12] him a tithe of all he had oh praise God
[1:26:15] friend you can't explain that
[1:26:18] it's just God
[1:26:20] it's just God working the work in his
[1:26:22] life
[1:26:24] Abraham when that was over was still
[1:26:26] sojourning and looking for that City
[1:26:28] till the day he died yes amen until we
[1:26:33] die or we Rapture I'm going to still be
[1:26:35] looking for that City hallelujah amen I
[1:26:38] just know that City that we have that's
[1:26:40] our possession we're still we're still
[1:26:42] sojourners here there is a place that
[1:26:45] God's got yes that that
[1:26:50] city is gonna come down on that
[1:26:53] pyramid-shaped Mountain that's pushed up
[1:26:55] out of this earth look at this future

[1:27:46] the form of melchized that
[1:27:48] that City will be a literal City one day
[1:27:50] that'll be set up for us that City that
[1:27:53] Abraham was looking for see being a
[1:27:56] prophet
[1:27:57] he knew that city was somewhere the
[1:28:00] Bible said so and he forsook the city he
[1:28:04] lived in and went over and went to where
[1:28:07] he was exactly where he went is exactly
[1:28:10] where that City will be
[1:28:13] exactly where God and uh Abraham and
[1:28:16] Melchizedek had communion is exactly
[1:28:20] where that city is either mid-shaped
[1:28:22] mountain is going to push up from the
[1:28:23] earth that that city is going to come
[1:28:24] down on
[1:28:26] that very spot now it may not be
[1:28:29] geographically within that mile
[1:28:31] but that area Palestine
[1:28:34] Israel that that place is where that
[1:28:37] pyramid-shaped mountain is going to push
[1:28:39] up right there where he met he he was
[1:28:41] standing right there
[1:28:42] right where it's going to be having
[1:28:44] Fellowship communion with Melchizedek

[1:29:06] we're the promised land that God has
[1:29:07] promised his children this whole time
[1:29:09] that's where that City will be
[1:29:11] amen this is the city that Abraham was
[1:29:14] looking for being a prophet he knew that
[1:29:16] city was somewhere the Bible says so he
[1:29:18] forsook the city he lived went over and
[1:29:20] looked where it went and where he went
[1:29:23] is exactly where it will be see he was
[1:29:26] looking for a city whose Builder and
[1:29:28] maker was God
[1:29:29] Jesus gone to prepare with Divine hands
[1:29:32] a Divine City a Divine architect for a
[1:29:36] Divine bottom people for a predestinated
[1:29:39] people he has gone to prepare it Abraham
[1:29:42] was looking for him he possessed uh
[1:29:44] professed that he was a pilgrim and a
[1:29:47] stranger for he looked for a city whose
[1:29:50] Builder maker was God that Prophet
[1:29:52] knowing it was somewhere John saw it
[1:29:55] coming down uh but Abraham thought it
[1:29:58] must be on the Earth right then why
[1:30:00] because he met Mel custody
[1:30:02] did not realizing that he is that City
[1:30:05] praise the Lord the king of it and he
[1:30:08] gave him tithe Abraham gave him tithe
[1:30:10] and had no father Melchizedek no father
[1:30:13] no mother had no beginning of day ending
[1:30:15] of Life Abraham met him and they took
[1:30:18] communion right on the little spot where
[1:30:21] the city will be raised up that Holy
[1:30:23] Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed
[1:30:26] will live
[1:30:27] praise the Lord right on that very spot
[1:30:29] that you begin that place that we've
[1:30:32] been talking about that place that we

[1:31:26] amen now we want to see here and type in
[1:31:29] the view of communion after the battle

[1:32:26] Victorious then you partake of the
[1:32:28] Lord's Supper yes amen

[1:32:34] you of himself that is his true
[1:32:36] communion little bread and wafer just
[1:32:38] represents it you shouldn't take it
[1:32:40] unless you've wrestled it out become a
[1:32:42] part of God remember at this time the
[1:32:45] communion had never been instituted not
[1:32:47] until the death of Christ hundreds and
[1:32:49] hundreds of years later but Melchizedek
[1:32:51] after his child Abraham had won the
[1:32:53] victory Melchizedek met him and gave him
[1:32:55] one uh wine and bread showing that after
[1:32:58] the Earthly battle is over we will meet
[1:33:00] him in the heavens and take the
[1:33:02] communion again at the wedding supper
[1:33:04] yes praise the Lord

[1:33:09] together yes amen How It just fits so
[1:33:12] perfectly how God still he's mindful of
[1:33:15] his children how he's mindful of his
[1:33:17] Gentile bride how it all comes in
[1:33:20] message uh meshes in the beauty that is

[1:33:26] who else could play it out who else
[1:33:28] could have others live and play that out
[1:33:32] in his mind
[1:33:34] for him
[1:33:36] that's what we do
[1:33:38] Melchizedek went to meet Abraham before
[1:33:41] he got back home what a beautiful type
[1:33:43] amen Melchizedek meeting Abraham before
[1:33:47] he got back home after the battle

[1:34:06] of the day you remember Rebecca and
[1:34:08] Isaac amen when Eliezer went out and
[1:34:11] found Rebecca and brought her unto Isaac

[1:41:39] in Reading
[1:41:40] 23rd verse
[1:41:45] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:41:47] which also I delivered unto you
[1:41:50] that the Lord Jesus
[1:41:53] same night in which he was betrayed to
[1:41:55] bread
[1:41:57] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:42:00] heed this is my body which is broken for
[1:42:03] you
[1:42:05] to do in remembrance of me
[1:42:07] after the same manner also he took the
[1:42:10] cup when he ends up saying this cup is
[1:42:13] the New Testament in my blood this Duty
[1:42:17] as off as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:42:19] me
[1:42:21] or as often as you eat of this bread
[1:42:23] drink of this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:42:26] death till he come
[1:42:28] wherefore whosoever shall eat the eat
[1:42:30] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:42:32] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:42:36] body and blood of the Lord
[1:42:38] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:42:41] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:42:43] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:42:46] unworthily eateth and drink of damnation
[1:42:49] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:42:52] body
[1:42:53] for this calls many a weak and sickly
[1:42:56] among you in many sleep
[1:42:57] for if we would judge ourselves we would
[1:43:00] not be judged
[1:43:02] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:43:05] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:43:06] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:43:09] brother when you come together to eat
[1:43:11] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:43:14] hunger let him eat at home that ye may
[1:43:16] come together unto con uh
[1:43:19] come not together unto condemnation and
[1:43:22] the rest will I set in order when I come
