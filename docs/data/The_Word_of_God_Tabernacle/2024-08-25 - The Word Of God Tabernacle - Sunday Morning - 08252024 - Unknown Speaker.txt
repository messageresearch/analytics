willing finish uh this subject that we've been on here for a few weeks now amen the statute of perfect man or as we' called it spiritual growth just not to be H really what it is amen growing in the Lord growing in God God's grace amen finished off last week or we kind of got part of the way through brotherly kindness so uh this week we'll just start back with brotherly kindness and um and go from there so let's turn over to Second Peter chapter 1 we'll get our scripture reading there as we uh always have second Peter chapter 1 we'll begin reading with verse five second Peter chap 1 verse 5 and is the Lord willing there's a obviously the Capstone love is um much more encompassing than what you we could say in one service must less part of a service or uh two or three services so um but we'll uh we'll just try to contain it here to today and try to finish this up I've had aou other subjects I want to get to too so Lord willing we try to finish this here today second Peter chapter 1 uh verse 5 before we read though let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer if we good Lord Jesus so very thankful again Lord God your blessings your love your mercy so thankful God that you give us health strength and life the ability and the desire to be here today God in your house thanking you for this place and all that you've done and are doing for us God and knowing that this is just the beginning this is just a part Lord that we play while we're here God trusting and believing one day when we go beyond that precious mortal reach God there's a there's a land that we're looking for a great land god there's no death no sorrow no sickness no pain no parting Lord just with our loved ones trusting you God and living through eternity with our savior father as one God in that place of perfection Lord in this place God that we have that is so far from perfect Lord help us God to be able to fulfill this Place th in this time in this place this statue Lord that brother randam preached to us that Peter spoke to us about Lord and now that we're trying to go through God that we can reach that place of perfection in this life God not that sinless Perfection we'll have there but Lord that place that you have for us the full embodiment of Jesus Christ in us living through US showing to this world that you are the same yesterday today and forever Let It Be to us now God as we commit ourselves to you and just trust and believe as you spoke to us along the way through this subject God that it would bring true to our hearts and it would Minister to us Lord that we don't forget it we don't let it slip but God we put it and applied in our lives and let it grow in our hearts and sometimes we may not even realize what is going on and what's happening Lord as the word is going forth God it will not return void so we know that in us as we're listening as we're receiving as you're revealing God that it will manifest and grow in us God to be this perfect man that you've called for each of us to be Lord yes God I pray that you'd bless it now and amongst us God and those who have come today Lord may you bless them those who may be streaming those who may even watch it archived Lord just bless them exceedingly we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hind or and filtrate this service in any way may you get the glory honor and praise prise for all that is said and done for we commit it to you in the precious holy lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen amen second Peter chapter 1 verse 5 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall you could be seated if you'd like amen as I said we've gone through uh uh a part of Brotherly kindness last week obviously we went through faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience got through godliness last week which took most of our time than kind of delve into the brotherly kindness which I wanted to a little bit because I knew if we didn't do that it wouldn't strike uh what I wanted it to be how how much I I wanted to add to that because uh all these all these attributes all these virtues are so very important to us obviously faith is being the foundation but all of it's so very important to us but when you start getting up to the Capstone it starts getting up to the place like it is here like it is for us today when you start getting closer and closer it starts getting narrower and narrower uh it starts getting more uh uh fundamental uh the seriousness of it increases especially when you get to the place of godliness amen brotherly kindness which again uh to me uh is uh is something outstanding that we should always uh try to attain to because brotherly kindness is above godliness right amen uh to be able to show godliness is to be able to show brotherly kindness like I said last week uh brother bam said God would rather me love you than love him because if I'm loving you I'm loving him so that brotherly kindness gets us and really enps I said brotherly kindness and godliness goes together but really all three of these go together and a few of the scriptures I'm going to read today uh actually encapsulate all three of these attributes amen godliness brotherly kindness and love amen so uh these these get to the place they wanted I I didn't want to go over them quickly wanted to spend more time on them thus brotherly kindness I wanted to spend a little more time on it uh I could have broke off and just put brotherly kindness just for today and then love just for next time but uh I thought maybe that we could bring the two together a little bit better than to spread them out more because it it kind of It kind of Falls in Better Together than if it you you get a week apart and things kind of go away you get two weeks apart and more stuff kind of Falls away and uh sometimes I feel almost like I repetitive and have to repeat myself because a things that was ministered two or three weeks ago is sometimes kind of leaves the Mind unless it's brought to our remembrance right uh so I just felt it's better to try to condense this into two Services instead of three so brotherly kindness brotherly kindness put yourself in someone else's place again walking in the other man's shoes if you will to be affectionate careful of others feelings the way we treat one another is the way that we treat God right amen the way that we treat one another is the way that we would treat God people would say well if God was standing here in a Corporal body well sorry but you would do it exactly the same as you do nowen that's what brother brandom said said you would treat him no you would treat him no differently than you do now amen people say if I had been back in that day well you with Jesus on the earth you treat him exactly the way then as you treat him right now amen and how you treat your brother is exactly the same way you treat God Amen cuz we are the embodiment representation of Jesus Christ on this Earth and even to those humans that may not be born again or even Christians to treat with brotherly kindness amen it's how we that would show how we would treat God Amen God is looking for this when we become like him to reach this place of Brotherly kindness is to be like God to have godliness and to be like God shows the godliness that and the brotherly kindness that uh is the attribute of God's spirit God's spirit in us we went through the godliness uh we talked about last week I read this scripture Matthew 18 2122 I won't uh go on as much as I did last week but I did want to read it again one of the brotherly kindness scriptures that I came up with Was Then Came Peter to him and said Lord how all shall I my sin uh my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times Jesus sayth unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 times seven yes amen again as we've said if you do simple math 7 time 7 he is 490 times per person per day that's a lot of forgiveness sadly a lot of times when someone's offended against once they cut they're done right they cut that person off there no forgiveness one time maybe too if some people are really full of a lot of Grace to that person maybe twice how many you know actually 490 times amen like I said Peter probably held the bar real high when he thought he was coming up to Jesus boasting seven thought well that's a lie actually in our Humanity seven is an extraordinary amount Jesus said absolutely not it is unlimit Li mited I my opinion that's what the 490 means amen unlimited at the amount of times you should forgive your brother amen forgiveness should be uh uh should be in us to forgive amen that's hard it is hard I'll be the first to say it forgiving is very difficult because it GRS against the flesh it's very hard to forgive it's even harder to try to forgive and forget amen amen but it is extremely hard uh to forgive but that's an attribute of God that's why having the spirit of God and the full embodiment of Christ in US is the only way that is going to bring us to this place to this statue of a perfect man this this place of perfection is only going to be achieved because you die to yourself because more of us dies and more of Christ lives it's the only way it's going to be reached it's the only way these attributes are going to manifest through your life only way it can be that's why it's so important believe that's why brother Brandon preached it to that way and then uh I'll probably uh read a quote or two that to solidify that the things that brother brandom said about that now let's go over to Romans chapter 12 uh Romans 12 verse 9 amen Romans 129 amen Romans 129 let's look at this 9 and 10 let love again like I said some of the uh uh scriptures that's going to encapsulate all three of these attributes let love be without dissimulation or hypocrisy if you will let it be without hypocrisy or uh dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring preferring one another amen that's the opposite of uh selfishness that's the opposite of self-centered that's the opposite of my Me Myself and no one else amen that is preferring your brother showing brotherly kindness showing brotherly love to let others know that your affection towards them is even more than it is to yourself you prefer others better than you amen that shows a brotherly kindness but it can't be done without that love that love let the love be without hypocrisy Amen Let It Be to where you genuinely love someone you don't you don't the Bible says not to love of course again we're these two are going to inter intermingle uh don't love in word or by the tongue but love in deed and in Works love someone by showing that you love them right produce that brotherly kindness by doing something for your brother or sister by being there for them even if it's something as simple as remembering them or praying for them or a text or a call or a visit something to show you care right that you love them that they're a part of you in your heart as brotherly kindness that love will not be with with hypocrisy it would be without hypocrisy it won't be that you love this one you don't love that one you love that one more than you love that one God's love is perfected in his pride and that love is agape love which is unconditional amen amen that will produce the brotherly kindness that we have to those that are around us amen especially if you will maybe not don't me it to be hypocrisy but our brothers that our brothers and sisters whom we love that we stand shoulder to shoulder with in the faith amen now let's go over to Hebrews chapter 13 we're going to read a couple of verses of scripture there when I'm when I'm through this I got a couple quotes I want read too brotherly kindness now Hebrews 13 verse1 let Brotherly Love continue yes amen that's pretty simple isn't it seems Elementary but it's gets right to the point let Brotherly Love continue Amen to continue something means you have to start it if you're going to start it want to continue brotherly kindness uh brotherly love but it's got to start start first that's the whole point for it to continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unaware remember them that are in bonds as uh as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body in other words put yourself in their place amen feel their pain feel their infirmity feel their trans transgression whatever it is feel that Mo move into that for someone else amen if you if you feel that way about somebody else it just proves that you had that true love that genuinely brotherly kindness that Brotherly Love towards that person because you put yourself in their position you've prayed for them as such you've given them support and adoration so that that person knows that you really care that you feel like you've been now see when when when uh someone is sick we pray for that person but we don't pray for it uh for dissimulation or hypocrisy we don't pray for them just because we it's out of Duty that we pray for them we pray for them because we genuinely care about that person we pray for them because if we were in that same position we would want those the others to pray for us right amen amen it's like the feelings of the infirmity ities uh the high priest that's touched by the feeling of our infirmities he feels those infirmities he knows what it's like CU he's been through it yes how many times do we we we we understand uh well we have a live example uh sister uh uh Lydia is going through the cancer brother Dennis has been there I I I I sat with brother Dennis saw some of what he went through but he but I still can't feel what he feels towards her amen as much as I can as much as I love her and I'll enter into that as best as possible he's been there he knows how it feels to take those treatments he knows what it feels like to take those pills and go through that treatment and sit there in that PL he knows what it feels like amen I've only been there I I wasn't plugged to the machine I wasn't taking the pills my wasn't falling out amen I wasn't feeling the the all the side effects but he does and see that's how it should be as much as possible towards one another how that person feels and think but unfortunately it's got to the world that a lot of people today well that's not my problem and I just honestly Saints I absolutely hate that attitude I hate that attitude I get that attitude at work sometimes that people people come up and I'll mention some and say well that's not my problem I hate that yeah yes you're a part of this job you're a part of this crew you're a part of this company you're a part of this this actual wash it is your problem yeah act like it's your problem do something about it don't just push it off and say well that's that's their job or or that's not my problem let's be a part of it don't be a part of the problem be a part of the solution amen the only way to do that is to enter into that Amen Let it become a part of you amen let it let let it let it feel in you like they would maybe feel as much as you can I haven't had cancer by the grace of God so I can't feel that way I haven't had a a joint replace I I can't feel exactly how sister patter brother Dennis NE I I can't I don't know that in the in the completeness that it is but we can sure enter into the place to say I can only imagine what it's like to have your flesh cut open and a part of your body ripped out and something fake put in that's the only thing I can think of Amen but when we get into that place to say oh God we enter into that I mean Jesus enter look Jesus entered into our Affliction so much he entered into our sins and our pain and our Affliction and our lives so much that when he went to the garden of Gethsemane his blood be his sweat became as drops of blood he was agonizing over what he was about to go through but yet he still cried father let it not be my will but your will be done right amen what the great example that we have of the brotherly kindness because he didn't do it for himself amen he didn't do it for himself he did it for others he did because he loved he did it because he cared he did it because he wanted you to be in a better place he wanted you to be in a better position he knew that if he didn't do it then all the human race was lost he knew if he if he didn't do that there would be nobody could take and open that book and every name in there would have been sealed and never found Redemption oh but by the grace of God he did it what a great example of Brotherly kindness amen enter entering into their afflictions that's exactly what this is let Brotherly Love continue Amen Let it continue I got one more now I want to read Philippians uh go over to Philippians chapter 2 amen we've read this scripture many times I um told you many stories that follow along with this scripture and it still means as much to me but SEC uh Philippians chapter 2 verse one if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind praise the Lord and what it did for him it should do for us let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory let nothing be done uh uh selfishly amen for let for me let it not be done Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of mind let Let each esteem other better than themselves amen esteem your brother better than you do your own self esteem your brother's life esteem your brother's flesh esteem them above your own self amen look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and we get to that place that place of Brotherly kindness where we're concerned about our brothers when we love our brother when we do what we do to help them to be there for them to love them to pray for them to and and to enter into not just pray but enter into prayer for those people feeling the affection of being in their shoes then that that effectual how that effectual fervent prayer that effectual the the burning passionate prayer is what affectionate means burning passionate uh uh prayer that we have for for someone and fervent is continues a continual prayer a passionate prayer for that person like I said last week that David himself said I pray for my enemy as though they were on my own mother amen and you think to yourself well how would I pray for my mother amen mine it says a lot it meant a lot amen and it was a great example for Peter to show brotherly or David to show brotherly kindness amen how he felt towards others even those that did him wrong even those that hated him and put him down statue of a perfect man now he said let's stud let's add to our faith these things then that which we might come in the full stature of Christ being join together with Godly love amen fear of God reverence in our hearts to one another deep respect to one another brotherly and sisterly kindness never vulgarity nothing but just the purity of the Holy Ghost living in us see live together be a Christian walk with faith let the virtue of God flow through you let the knowledge of God when it comes to right and wrong when the devil presents something that's not exactly scripture walk away from it kindly affectioned one to another amen with brotherly kindness now let's go um to charity if I don't get there pretty soon we'll never finish it which you kind of already have sort of Charity love obviously love charity uh it says in the Bible charity I put love up here because love fits a little better than charity uh when I write it four letters it's a little easier to read from you back there uh love love is Charity charity is love love uh charity love perfect love kindness love of God Amen uh the love of God Jesus uh the love of God written Epistles as we are written Epistles read of all men yes amen uh being uh of the love of God towards one another the other seed God in us that God's reflecting himself through us as written Epistles without the Capstone the rest of the body means nothing amen because why because God is love God is the Capstone without the Capstone without God we can have any all these attributes portions parts of them as the world does and still be nothing right amen because it's love why you say well that's what the scripture tells us let's go and read this amen this the scripture I want to get to First here in charity obvious the love chapters what I'm going to read here 1 Corinthians chapter 13 amen look here though I speak with the the tongue of men and a we know it all I imagine pretty well yes 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol amen without the Capone what are we amen amen praise the Lord all these attributes are great friends they're all needful they're all need all of them but without the love to cap it what good does it do to us we can speak with tongues men and angels but if we don't have the charity we're a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol just an undistinguishable noise is all it is and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries all knowledge though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing you might have the faith to be able to move Mount Lemon over there and throw it in the Pacific Ocean but without this you are nothing amen right amen people hang theirselves on these tongues and prophecies and gifts and doing this and doing that oh they did that all through the scripture anyway and they said and the group came to Jesus and said we did it in your name and he still said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you right I'm I amen all Mysteries all knowledge all Faith to move mountains don't have charity I am nothing though I bestow all my goods third verse to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing listen now the attributes of Charity love charity love suffereth long love is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself it's not prideful it is not coughed up again not prideful not arrogant does not behave itself unseemingly the love of God seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices the love of God rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth bearing all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things yes charity never fail praise the Lord that's one of the greatest things about charity about love it never fails yeah love never fails God is love charity God never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall see whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away the love of God the great love of God Amen that manifests itself self to us charity amen bringing bringing forth those attributes that God has shown us now let's go to the script to uh Matthew chapter 19 Matthew chapter 19 verse1 17 amen without the charity it means nothing charity is love love is the love of God as we've said before there's uh different kinds of love there's the love of man which is a fio love uh fileo however someone wants to pronounce it there's a goo love that's the love of God there's aape the love of God in action it's the it's still the love of God Amen the vilio love man's love is conditional comes goes God's love is without Condition it's like brother Dena said brother Bram came to the point that he under that he truly understood the love of God and and he said we don't love God to try to dodge hell we don't love God because he's going to punish us someday we love him because of who he is period not because uh of what he's done for us but just simply because of who he is and when you come to that understanding that that's God's love then that means that regardless of what God does we still love him if we still love him that way to the point that even if he were to sentence me to hell I would still still love him if I he said if I go with the same affection the same way that I am now and if God send me to hell I would still love him amen because even hell did not change his love for God yes amen and how many times do do the smallest things in life sometimes big things in life but how many times did those the circumstances of life change people's love for God people say they did love God but then they left him why God let this happen well did you love him apparently not because even after that if you loved him you'd still love him yes because your love wouldn't change it does not change based on condition does not change based on even where your location is like brother bandam said doesn't change amen it's still love is still the love of God uh Matthew 19:17 and he said unto him this is again the Rich Young Ruler he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou wil enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself again brotherly kindness and charity working together love thy neighbor love thy neighbor as thyself amen that is not a part of the Ten Commandments but the command that God that Jesus gave to this Rich Young Ruler right it's in Leviticus but it's still the same it's still it's still a command of God that God gives us that we are to love our neighbor uh uh love our neighbor as ourselves what other scripture we just read in brotherly kindness to esteem others better than ourselves now these things they're they're great against the flesh these things are not easy we can sit here and I can talk about it uh we can listen to it we can hear brother brandom or anybody else say it or talk about it or read it in the scripture but when we go go outside those doors and it comes and applies into our lives and these things start coming against us and start testing us and start challenging us what are we going to do how are we going to react that's why so many times we may not recognize or realize how much the word of God has taken effect in our lives because the word will not return void right but how much that word is taking effect in our lives until we get into a position and God does something or sends a trial or something and then all of a sudden we see something happen and say wow that wasn't even me I wouldn't have done that in myself I would have done this but God through me produced his own life and did this to this person and forgiveness and love and charity and brotherly kindness and the fullness of Christ UND displayed amen amen when Jesus was sitting there and they was smacking upside the head who hit you he could could have told them he could have played along right with their game and said and told them their name their address where they live who they were what their lineage was what their mom and daddy's name is what her mother mother mother's made name was down to the 10th and 12th and 20th generation he could have done it but he didn't play their game because he wasn't showing for himself he wasn't doing this for himself he was doing it for us yes he could have turned them to fleas he could have turned them to the frogs he could have spok them out of existence completely if he wanted to right but he proved through that how to overcome and when it comes to us how do we act or react in in conditions what are we going to do right how does it manifest itself through us and when those times come up friend those testing times that's the only way to find out yes amen I know sometimes when I was doing elect work with brother Roger they well you know we've done what we can do it was done right it should work just fine but you don't know until you flip the switch right amen when you flip the switch and no light comes on you say well I did something wrong somewhere something's not right it's like we do at this job you you put this together and say well I did it right it's exactly like it's supposed to be I don't know what I could have done better but you don't know until you flip the switch Yeah and we come to a place uh Church and God speak to us and we think oh yes uh wow brotherly kindness yeah I got that love of course I love my neighbors I love this it when everything's nice Grand and fine and all is good yeah it's easy to do that but then God flips the switch and all of a sudden uh everything comes against you you're like now what are you going to do is it going to operate properly you say I think I've done all I can do I think I've done everything I'm supposed to do I think I'm in the right position position if this were to happen I believe I'd know how to react but you don't know until the flip the the the switches flipped amen I've had so many people say oh if I won the lottery well I'd tell them well wait wa hold on a second especially if they're a Christian if I won the lottery I said hold hold on a second if you won the lottery you're coming against God already because that's gambling you didn't do that that's in my opinion people do whatever they want but in my opinion you're you're wrong already but they say oh well well if had all this money I'd do this and i' do that and I'd give to the church and i' I'd pay my tithes you want to pay your tithe now you wouldn't pay it then right amen yeah that's truth people say I I'll do this I'll give here I do no you won't you know when it happens now how many times do people oh I do this that and the other and all of a sudden it happens and you're like oh well you know I'm not sure maybe I should just but see you don't know till the flip the flip the switches flip yeah amen that's what God does to us so many times the tests the trials it's just God flipping a switch man we reuke the devil all we want but you know God allows the devil to get to us for certain reasons certain times certain purposes it wants to see the test has got to come oh I passed that in two beautifully that's the best past job I ever done I put more glue on it and this is sticking solid but you don't know until you pump it up if it's going to hold air or not yeah amen God flips the switch God pumps God makes sure that it's going to hold that it's going to stand that Love's got to be tested friend amen and God's going to test it but that love is what shows us who we really are when he came to the test here this Rich Young ruer couldn't stand it yes when the test came down he said oh I've done all this stuff from my from my youth up I I I passed that tire I did did this just right I I put that well together I put those uh uh wires together it's as perfect as it can be and then when the test comes you find out oh I've done all this for my youth young man said I've kept all these from my from my youth up but then when God tested it he said that and then God flips the switch and says okay then give all you sell all you've got and give it to your neighbor like you say you love like you say you love amen sell it all and give it to them he couldn't do that amen you know what his man-made patch on that tire blew a hole in it bigger than the one that was there to start with and that air that that tube deflated as fast as it could be pumped up amen light didn't come on water pipe sprung a lead you can think it all day long friend but until the pressure is applied until it comes down to flipping the switch you don't know no right this man thought he had it all I've kept all this I've done all these things and yet when God flipped the switch he could not do it right amen the Bible says he could not do it because he had great possessions and he walked away from Jesus sorrowful now did he become a pper no did he become a poor man did his life wreak the rest of his he become a bum or homeless no he got richer he grew greater he got more important he got greater stature he had to build more barns just to hold all the stuff that he got amen but the last account we find of him he's lifting his eyes up into hell right because when the flip the switch was flipped he couldn't stand it yes he couldn't take it amen and it blew praise the Lord let's go over to uh um what scripture we got next uh let's do first John first John chapter 4 and there's so oh my goodness there's there's so much and John was just a man of love this point uh pretty much all of first second third John is just about love so you could actually go and just read all of the all the firsts second third John and he's going to talk to you about love yes Amen Let Let's uh see what's if I stay on topic we'll be good with this let's go over to the let's look at the third chapter first John the third chapter 11th verse 1 John 3:11 for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain look now he's given the converse example here not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers were righteous that's why he killed him Marvel not my brother if the world hate you we know that we have pass looked how we how do we know we know that we have pass pass from Death unto life because we love agapo the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know not uh and ye know that no murderer has entered has eternal life abiding in him whereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren let let's let's go over to the fourth chapter now I wanted to get that people say they love one another but then they really do hate when it comes right down to it when the rubber meets the road if you will they find out they really don't love them they hate them amen one reason biggest reason is because the other is good you're evil and that's why the world hates a lot of times will hate a Christian because of your attribute your Godly love they hate it Bible says it's pouring coals on their head U fourth chapter Now 1 John 4 let's go down to 13 hereby know that that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he is and he in God and we know and and we and we have known and believed the love that God have to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God God and God in him now we got a whole another we got a whole another love coming up here 17th verse 17th verse herein is our love made perfect praise the Lord now we get to this place this Capstone Christ God love now John is speaking of not just a love but a perfect love remember and remember that when we talk about this entire body read some uh verses some uh quotes later that brings this whole thing into view This Love Now is made perfect herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love again perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment and that's exactly what the world tries to do to control people today by fear right I've talked about our country and of course going through Co and the fear that people put on through Co this is this is worldwide this is a tactic of the devil it was a tactic in the Garden of Eden it's a it's a tactic today fear to put fear on people is to try to control them but fear is torment God doesn't torment you so there is no there is no fear in God because there's no fear in love fear is of the devil fear brings torment right fear torments the Mind fear torments and the worry of and and the torment brings worry the worry of what what the next minute the next hour the next day the next month the next year is going to be we don't even know but God knows but love casteth out fear God cast out fear because fear had torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love amen God help us amen people run around scared in fear no probably no more than I've seen in recent memory than there was during the co thing people in fear Christians in fear I couldn't believe the number of PE professing Christians I saw in line that were literally generally fearful yeah so what are you afraid of amen amen well it can kill me no it can't if you're a Christian only God takes your life yes amen God's the only God's Got A Time ordained for all of us I believe right amen I know brother Bram said you could go before your time I personally think that's an extreme example but I think we all have that time when God's done with us then God takes us home and if God's done and if God's done with you why would you not want to go home yeah if my usefulness and my purpose for being here is over then why would I want to stay I mean I understand family and love and things like the spouse and think I I understand all of course that that matters to God understands that but the fear is what Satan puts on people somebody say I'm I'm afraid to die why would you be afraid to die if you're a Christian why would you be afraid to die amen I don't want to die I love my wife my children my grandchildren my family I love my church I love my I I I don't want I don't want to die but if it's my time to go I don't want to stay either oh look I happened to Hezekiah think it was Hezekiah 15 look what happened he asked God for more time God gave it to him look what happened to him right amen look now he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that I love that straightforward talk don't you yeah just just tell it like it is amen if something is of an evil spirit it's a liar then say what it is you're just lying he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen no wonder brother Braham said God would rather be love you than love him amen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also the complete circle of that love right of the love of God what does it do it talks about here this commandment have we from him God that we loveth God Amen God loveth uh loveth God love is brother also brotherly kindness amen is the godliness of God being love it all encompasses the exact same thing Jesus Christ man manifesting himself to us bringing to us the fullness of these attributes to the Perfection of this perfectness statute of perfect man now one more Galatians chapter 5 amen Galatians chapter 5 I want to read one quote here as you're turning over there because I want to finish with that in the Statue of a perfect man amen you're going over to Galatians s a perfect man then the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things by these things but it cannot be completely controlled until it completely possesses these qualities amen cannot be completely controlled that's what the Capstone does because again Capon is God love God controls the whole thing amen it cannot bring be brought to that perfect position unless it this controls the whole thing as he said cannot be completely controlled completely controlled remember we said people have these attributes at points times anybody till it completely possesses these qualities completely amen not in part not here or there not for some and not others listen now no hypocrisy is not for some people and and it's and not for others amen it's for everybody the completeness of that yes is encapsulated the Capstone now let's read this scripture Galatians chapter 6 verse 5 or 5 Verse 6 excuse me Galatians 56 for in Jesus for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love amen now you've got the whole thing Faith which works by love amen encapsulates the whole thing Faith which is the foundation operates by love amen only way your faith can operate is by love yes your faith doesn't operate based on your uh your intellect or your will or your desire for something your faith operates off the love which brings us back to that same point of Brotherly kindness putting yourself in their position what does that do the love operates the faith the love for that person the brotherly kindness to generate through the godliness will generate a faith in you that will manifest for that person to bring healing or salvation or whatever the need may be whatever the prayer may be the faith is operated by the love if you have faith is I've got faith to believe pray for a person but if it does if there's no love there what does what good does it do right it doesn't produce anything the faith won't operate like it should remember the effectual prayer effectual is the passionate prayer the love of the prayer that what that's what will generate the faith that's what ignites the faith amen that's why a lot of people know it shouldn't but makes a difference if it's someone you're praying for a stranger or something versus someone that you know or your family member or your immediate family who you think well I love my wife more than I love the stranger on the street but why ailo love yes in ailio love yes I love my wife more than I love that guy on the street or that woman begging money down here yeah I love her more than them filio love but God's love absolutely not in God's ago love I do not love her more than I love him I want him to get to heaven and be a Christian as much as I do her yes and as much as I would myself amen that Faith then now operates that love it's that's something that's effectual then it's a desire that we have it's not something manufactured or made up because you can't make it up you can't fake it you can try to produce a little bit of it here and there for a while but it takes the Holy Spirit to make this whole thing operate now we've encom now we've encompassed we've encircle this entire this entire man amen as one person purposeful human being to work life Faith love it all operates together it's God operating it amen through US amen God's showing the rest of the world that he lives in us we are his disciples amen I know sometimes on the job it kind of gets to that place when others do what they do and say the things they say and I I I some a lot of times I'll come along and say you know you shouldn't be that way you shouldn't talk like that shouldn't feel that way uh but um the world is the world and worldly people are worldly people and all and that's all they know they live what they know amen right let me read a couple of quotes I'm G I'm gon to go ahead and stop there but let me read a couple of quotes because you know the devil fights us from getting this yes the devil fights you all the time from getting this and and remember God God is Not trying uh to pamper us physically but he's trying to perfect us spiritually yes amen not pamper us physically because physical pampering does not perfect spiritually he's not here to pamper us physically he wants us to be perfected spiritually and the devil's trying everything to keep us from getting to this place amen forgetting all of this that God has for us amen listen to this now Abraham restored what's he doing con God condensing trying trying to draw near to his people so he can be loved and worshiped and we' in the leodan age turned him on the outside he's knocking trying get back in as many as I love I rebuke and chasen as many as I love I rebuke and chasen repent he said here we are that's God that's God our father in the form of the Holy Ghost trying to get get back into our lives to control us this is what God is trying to control Us by say control absolutely amen but he can only do it because free moral agents if we allow him right amen which again means Newton dying to himself letting God live he's got to have a church as I said last night that Capstone to come on it's got to come on their perfect and the church has got to draw into that Perfection amen you say perfection he said yes he said be you there therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect amen praise the Lord statute of a perfect man these people who died in there he's talking about Hebrews 11 now the end of the back end of Hebrews 11 those SAA and sa and caves and stuff those people died in there depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection God helped me I want to I I want to do my part yes to put for this old man to be in that position for the resurrection to take place yes I mean brother Brown said several times that the Rapture was overdue God help us let us get into the position the place to where it will bring that Resurrection that's what we're looking for that's what we need that's what we desire greatly in on Earth now perfect Faith look now the identification of a scriptural Christian the identification of a scriptural Christian that could have been a good title for this too the the identification of a scriptural Christian guess again that would that could have been a good title here these words said Jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a Believer a people and deny those words my mind how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of this word see you can't do it you're not a Believer therefore signs signs can't follow you because you just accept what you want to believe and the rest of it you don't want to believe it but you got to take the whole thing and believe it and when truly and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs will follow the believer One More as I close here amen one more statue perfect man again um he said I pledge this morning to make him look now I hope we all do this God help me I pledge I pledge let not be something I'm reading me I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray that I will seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements following in this little old stature of mine amen God let it be yes a pledge is it a pledge that we have to live up to till I can be till I can be a manifestation of the living Christ for he became sin like me that I might become the very righteousness of God like him he took my place so I could take his yes praise the Lord in the fullness of that stature that God has has put for us to put us in that position Amen in the rising of the sun brother Bram said we we are now laying in the presence of the sun to ripen amen till all these come into full Perfection full maturity in our lives that we are the embodiment and the reflection of Jesus Christ who had who is the full reflection of these attributes amen we lie in the presence of not the Su n now but the o n lie in the presence of the s o n so that we can be rightness that God can bake all the greenness out of us I believe said make all the greenness out praise the Lord all the what is the the greenness is the is is the the immaturity greenness is when a a seed is real young and has just come forth and just been born and bake all that out of us till we come to that mature place of the mature grain that can be useful to God Amen a green seed is not useful can't be used for anything taste horrible if you ever tried to taste a green fruit or a green nut or something it's horrible except maybe a pistachio they're green anyway but a green uh what what I mean by Green is not necessarily color though it means the youth a young one it's horrible but when it comes to maturity when that bean when that fruit when that nut when that uh uh vegetable comes to a place of complete maturity is it it is useful amen make food it's good to eat taste good amen and it's it's good for you praise the Lord L in the presence of the Sun that God bake all the greenness out of us to come to that place of maturity that God will perfect us spiritually amen praise the
