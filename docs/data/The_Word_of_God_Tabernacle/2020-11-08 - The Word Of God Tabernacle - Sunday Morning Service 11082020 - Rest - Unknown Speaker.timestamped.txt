[21:38] up um totally against Christian
[21:42] principles abortions is going to be uh
[21:45] taken off again um he stands for the
[21:49] mlim nation they're going to be served
[21:52] you know better than our own uh service
[21:55] people that you know dedicated their
[21:58] lies you know for the service of this
[22:01] country uh so so much that it's it's
[22:05] almost
[22:06] mindboggling and I believe it's a test
[22:09] for us as Believers there's going to be
[22:11] some dark times but we must press on
[22:14] more harder more diligent than ever
[22:17] before and um true I I I I I'm almost
[22:22] baffled I'm I I I can't believe that uh
[22:26] he's going to raise taxes he's going to
[22:28] do do everything that's contrary to what
[22:31] us Believers you know were anticipating
[22:34] so it's time to pray people and I
[22:37] believe we're going home soon I believe
[22:39] that too brother yes amen let's just
[22:42] stand as we go to the Lord in prayer and
[22:44] brother Dennis would you mind praying

[22:57] God will have his way with you you and
[22:59] Lord Jesus there are troubling times

[39:46] amen The Book of Ruth now uh chapter 3
[39:49] we'll just begin reading with verse at
[39:51] verse
[39:53] one then then Naomi her mother-in-law
[39:56] said unto her my daughter shall I not
[39:58] seek rest for thee that it may be well
[40:01] with thee and now is not Boaz of our
[40:04] Kindred who uh with whose maidens thou
[40:08] was behold he went with barley tonight
[40:11] in the threshing floor wash thyself
[40:13] therefore and anoint thee and put thy
[40:16] rment upon thee and get thee down to the
[40:19] floor but make not thyself known unto
[40:21] the man until he have uh shall have done
[40:24] eating and drinking and it shall be when
[40:27] he lith down that thou shalt Mark the
[40:29] place where he shall lie Thou shalt go
[40:32] in and uncover his feet and lay thee
[40:35] down and he will tell thee what Thou
[40:37] shalt do and she said unto her all that
[40:41] thou sayest unto me I will do amen and
[40:45] she went down unto the floor and did
[40:47] according to all her mother-in-law B her
[40:50] when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his
[40:53] heart was merry he went to lie down at
[40:55] the end of the Heap of corn and she came
[40:57] came softly and uncovered his feet and
[40:59] laid her down and it came to pass at
[41:02] midnight that the man was afraid and
[41:04] turned himself and behold a woman lay at
[41:07] his feet and he said who art thou she uh
[41:10] she answered I am Ruth thy handmade
[41:13] spread thou for thy skirt over thine
[41:15] handmaid for thou art a near
[41:18] Kinsman and he said blessed be thou of
[41:21] the Lord my daughter for thou has showed
[41:23] great kind uh has showed more kindness
[41:26] in the latter end than at the beginning
[41:28] in as much as thou uh follow us not
[41:31] young men whether poor or Rich and now
[41:34] my daughter fear not I will do to thee
[41:37] all that thou requirest for all the city
[41:40] of my people doth know that thou art a
[41:42] virtuous woman you can be seated if
[41:45] you'd
[41:46] like stop there story of Ruth is a great
[41:49] story um we say story again you know my
[41:52] thoughts about saying story but uh the
[41:55] the truth of Ruth and the life that she
[41:57] lived uh is is quite a story it's only
[42:00] uh four chapters but it's uh it's
[42:02] outstanding there's many things type
[42:05] shadows and many different messages that
[42:08] no doubt have been preached could be
[42:10] preached probably will be preached but I
[42:12] just want to take a simple thought today
[42:14] of rest amen just a just a simple
[42:17] four-letter word of rest uh we know that
[42:21] brother randam preached about um the
[42:23] kinsman redeemer and that is a huge part
[42:26] of what Ruth is about of course and and
[42:28] identifying Jesus Christ as the kinsman
[42:30] redeemer to come and to redeem all man
[42:33] uh we know though that Ruth also was uh
[42:37] the story of Ruth was also a uh a a a
[42:41] foretelling of the Gentile church
[42:44] because Ruth was a gentile uh Ruth was
[42:47] the daughter-in-law of Naomi who was a
[42:50] limex wife and they had two sons and
[42:53] there was a famine in in in the land so
[42:56] they uh IMC got Naomi and his sons and
[42:59] they went to the land of Moab uh now the
[43:02] land of Moab of course we know was not a
[43:04] good place it was a it was a wicked
[43:07] place it was evil place it was a place
[43:08] that was born out of uh of uh of
[43:11] adultery and um um if I should say that
[43:16] well Moab came about because uh lot had
[43:19] relation with his daughter and lot was
[43:22] and and Moab was born as a relationship
[43:25] of an incestuous relation relationship
[43:27] between lot and his daughter uh that's
[43:30] how Moab came about and of course Moab
[43:33] was also used by the prophet balum to
[43:37] deceive the children of Israel into
[43:39] marrying into Moab so that all of them
[43:41] would intermingle together the righteous
[43:44] with the unrighteous saying that they
[43:45] were all one and all a part of one big
[43:47] great family when in truth they were
[43:50] right because lot was a part of Abraham
[43:52] Abraham was his uncle so they were
[43:54] family but they weren't family in the
[43:56] sense that they were family spiritually
[43:58] they only had a blood trail that they
[44:00] could follow and uh and so balam tricked
[44:03] Israel into marrying into Moab and when
[44:06] they did that they committed fornication
[44:08] against God when they committed
[44:09] fornication against God God put them
[44:11] away but the rest part that I want to
[44:15] get to is the Gentile part that Ruth is
[44:18] now when when uh Naomi and imim Sons uh
[44:22] when they went to Moab they found two
[44:24] women and married them uh one was orpa
[44:28] uh I like to call her Oprah that's
[44:29] probably not a good thing to do but you
[44:32] just switch two letters and it becomes
[44:33] Oprah but anyway her name is orpa o r p
[44:37] ah I believe is how it's spelled but
[44:39] anyway uh uh that was one
[44:41] daughter-in-law and Ruth was the other
[44:43] daughter-in-law well Ruth was uh uh well
[44:47] when when uh orpa and Ruth's Sons passed
[44:53] away when uh Naomi and imc's sons died
[44:57] uh they were left uh together with just
[45:00] Naomi because Naomi's immc died and
[45:03] their two sons died so it just left the
[45:05] three women so when the three women were
[45:08] there uh they had a choice to make the
[45:10] famine that Naomi had heard was was gone
[45:13] in Bethlehem and so Naomi decided to go
[45:16] back home to her people where she should
[45:18] have stayed to begin with you see uh
[45:20] when the children of Israel in their
[45:22] Homeland that's when they're blessed and
[45:24] when you leave the Homeland that's when
[45:26] you're not blessed blessed right so when
[45:28] they left the Homeland they weren't
[45:29] blessed andc died and their two sons
[45:31] died but Naomi saw that the famine was
[45:34] gone uh and so she took uh her two
[45:37] daughter-in-laws was one and was going
[45:39] to go but as but before she went because
[45:42] they were women of Moab she gave them
[45:44] leave to go back to their uh to or to
[45:47] stay actually in their Homeland and to
[45:50] uh marry other men but uh they both
[45:54] cling to na meat but Ora finally uh got
[45:57] to the places she's like okay I'm sorry
[45:59] she was crying and but she went ahead
[46:01] and left and went back into the world so
[46:03] orpa orpa Oprah left God and went back
[46:07] into the world so when orpa went into
[46:09] the world Ruth had a decision to make uh
[46:13] orpa made her decision and she decided
[46:15] to go back in the world Ruth had her
[46:16] decision to make and she decided to
[46:18] cling to Naomi and she told naom me
[46:21] where you Lodge I'll Lodge where you
[46:23] live I'll live where you are I'll your
[46:25] people be my people where you die die
[46:28] and so Ruth made that decision as a
[46:30] gentile moabit as a gentile made that
[46:34] decision that she was going to stay with
[46:36] Naomi and go into the Homeland where
[46:38] Ruth would be blessed right and so that
[46:41] decision part and of course you know as
[46:43] brother brandham did and if you have a
[46:45] Scofield bible he did the same thing uh
[46:47] brother Bram probably maybe got it from
[46:49] Scofield's notes here but you can see
[46:51] the first part of uh of the Book of Ruth
[46:54] is Ruth's decision Ruth deciding because
[46:58] Ruth had a decision to make and just
[47:00] like the Gentile Church the Gentile
[47:02] bride had a decision to make amen every
[47:05] one of us even if you're a Christian if
[47:07] you feel like you're a born again
[47:09] Christian today you had a decision to
[47:11] make cuz we're free moral agents that
[47:14] decision that Ruth had to make was
[47:16] either if she was going to go back into
[47:17] the world again back to the moabites or
[47:20] if she was going to claing to Naomi if
[47:22] she was going to cling to that uh that
[47:24] Jewish church that she was going to
[47:26] cling to and be blessed by that because
[47:28] that's where they were blessed so that
[47:29] was her decision after that then they go
[47:33] back together and they're in Bethlehem
[47:35] and Ruth begins to serve second chapter
[47:38] you can read Ruth begins to serve she
[47:40] goes out of the field and she starts to
[47:42] glean all of the uh the the stubble and
[47:46] and all of the field to bring back for
[47:48] her and Naomi to eat and and to be
[47:50] blessed by and she met Boaz and uh and
[47:53] Boaz told his men to throw more stuff
[47:57] out for Naomi or for uh Ruth to gather
[48:00] together and and uh and they became very
[48:03] close and so when Ruth did this she
[48:06] served and she served moaz and she
[48:08] served Naomi and she was in she was in
[48:10] the life of service to Naomi and to
[48:13] those that were around her because
[48:15] Naomi's people became her people amen so
[48:18] that was Ruth serving well then we get
[48:21] to the third part where Ruth enters into
[48:24] a rest first she's decided
[48:27] then she's serving and then she's at
[48:29] rest and brother random we know he types
[48:32] it into a part of uh into a place of the
[48:35] new birth the justification the
[48:37] sanctification and the being born again
[48:40] Having the Holy Ghost the justification
[48:42] is the decision that you make the
[48:44] decision you make for Jesus Christ and
[48:47] accepting Christ as your savior puts you
[48:49] into a place of justification because
[48:52] the blood of Jesus Christ by your
[48:54] testimony annihilates the sin that was
[48:56] in your life it justifies you as though
[48:59] you had never done it in the first place
[49:02] so that was the the the decision that
[49:04] you make that brought you to that place
[49:07] that's not the end result however
[49:08] because there's a time that we serve
[49:11] that serving is that we do for the Lord
[49:14] and we serve the Lord and we work
[49:16] there's a work to be done when you
[49:18] decide to accept Jesus Christ there's a
[49:20] work to be done there's something that
[49:22] you do there you you uh accept Jesus you
[49:26] you you need to go get baptized in the
[49:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[49:31] need to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:33] and there's there's work to be done
[49:35] there's a service to be done but once
[49:37] that Holy Spirit comes in your life and
[49:39] you've received the baptism of the Holy
[49:41] Ghost you've receive the indwelling
[49:43] presence of Jesus in your soul you
[49:46] become to a place of rest amen where
[49:49] you're resting in Christ you're resting
[49:52] in his word you're resting in his
[49:55] promises and that rest has put us not
[49:57] just in the presence of God but at ease
[50:00] in the presence of God at rest in the
[50:03] presence of God Amen now I want you to
[50:05] know something before the election
[50:08] before all the stuff happened this week
[50:10] before any the Lord put this on my heart
[50:12] long before any the stuff that's been
[50:14] going on this week but then all this had
[50:17] began to unfold this week made my heart
[50:19] glad because I begin to see why the Lord
[50:22] put this on my heart however long ago it
[50:25] was a month or more so or go so uh to
[50:29] understand this just didn't come about
[50:31] because of brother Dennis's testimony or
[50:33] because of all the turmoil and stuff
[50:35] that's going on in their country today
[50:36] the lord gave this to me a while back
[50:38] but I believe it was purposely designed
[50:41] for today amen what greater time do we
[50:44] need to have or to feel that we're at in
[50:48] resting today in the promises of God
[50:50] there's ever a time that we need to rest
[50:52] it's right now rest in what rest in the
[50:55] fact that we know who we are we know
[50:58] Christ has paid the price we know we're
[50:59] born again and filled with the Holy
[51:01] Ghost we know that God has G us the
[51:03] promised land and in that Holy Ghost is
[51:05] where God promised his children to be
[51:08] blessed amen so if God has blessed us
[51:10] even in the worst times then how could
[51:13] anything change that amen praise God but
[51:16] Ruth now as she's laced notice this last
[51:20] verse Boaz tells Ruth now fear uh and
[51:25] now my daughter fear not amen what does
[51:29] that do what is it when when when
[51:32] somebody comes and says fear not what is
[51:34] it do to you when you read in the word
[51:36] Jesus said fear not when he says fear
[51:39] not little flock is my father's a good
[51:43] pleasure to give you the kingdom when
[51:45] the word tells us now when this happens
[51:47] it it should bring a rest to our hearts
[51:50] it should being rest to our soul of
[51:52] Peace amen remember the service a few
[51:55] weeks ago God is not give us the spirit
[51:57] of fear he's G us the spirit of Love of
[52:00] power and of a sound mind not the spirit
[52:02] of fear that rest is what God gives us
[52:06] that we can stand upon all the things
[52:08] that's going on and still know and have
[52:10] TR uh faith that God is there with us
[52:13] praise God Amen now Ruth uh uh Boaz was
[52:17] the near Kinsman to Naomi but we know of
[52:22] course there was a near Kinsman to Naomi
[52:26] and that that near Kinsman that boas was
[52:29] talking about uh we didn't read if you
[52:31] want to finish reading that just for
[52:33] sake of time there's that near Kinsman
[52:36] that had a greater claims on Naomi now I
[52:39] don't want to get into the Kinsman so
[52:40] much because I want to really focus on
[52:42] the rest part but uh just to highlight
[52:45] real quick that that kinsman redeemer
[52:47] had to be somebody that was Kinfolk
[52:50] right now I know that might be strange
[52:52] in Tucson Arizona but in Charlotte North
[52:54] Carolina or in the mountains North
[52:55] Carolina kin folk is a common word right
[52:58] it's used to denote people that are
[53:00] related to you people that are the
[53:03] closest to you I had family I had mom
[53:06] dad brothers sisters those were my
[53:08] closest family then I had uh cousins and
[53:12] uh uncles and aunts and and they were
[53:14] the next tier and then I had second
[53:16] cousins and things like that and and
[53:18] that's all in your family but see your
[53:20] brother is closer to you than your
[53:22] second
[53:23] cousin amen you understand that so that
[53:26] that brother is a nearer Kinsman to you
[53:30] he's a closer Kinfolk to you than what
[53:33] your second cousin might be or what or
[53:36] first cousin or whatever it might be
[53:38] they're closer to you the bloodline is
[53:40] pure amen do you understand so if the
[53:43] bloodline is pure that makes you a
[53:45] closer kin person to that individual
[53:49] well there was a closer kin person that
[53:52] could lay claims on a lic's property
[53:55] which was Nam Naomi and then Ruth then
[53:58] what Boaz was it was a pure bloodline it
[54:01] was a closer kinfo amen amen now there
[54:05] was a nearer Kinsman to uh uh uh uh to
[54:09] you there was a nearer Kinsman to me and
[54:13] to Christians than Jesus Christ was do
[54:17] you know who that nearer Kinsman
[54:19] is that near Kinsman was the devil
[54:23] because the devil had first claims on
[54:26] you right the devil had first rights to
[54:29] you because in the beginning when the
[54:31] fall took place when when all of
[54:34] creation fell all of humanity fell every
[54:37] human since then has been born in sin
[54:39] shap iniquity come the world speaking
[54:41] lies that devil had first claims on you
[54:45] yes amen and if a person doesn't become
[54:47] born again and filled with the spirit of
[54:49] God that devil will hold that claim amen
[54:53] but to a Christian the devil had no
[54:56] right to that claim and so he had to let
[54:59] loose cuz he could not perform the duty
[55:02] of the near Kinsman amen and you go read
[55:05] it the uh he had to take off his shoe
[55:07] and beat the table and all and of course
[55:09] goes in the cruffin anyway we won't talk
[55:11] about that but but that near kinum he
[55:14] could not perform the duty to redeem
[55:19] Naomi right and because he couldn't
[55:21] perform that duty to redeem Naomi he
[55:24] could not get Ruth
[55:27] amen he was in he was incapable of doing
[55:29] it he was unable to do it amen now we
[55:34] can go into a lot of detail but I don't
[55:36] I don't again we want to focus on the
[55:37] rest part but Boaz in his position
[55:42] though he was not the nearer Kinsman he
[55:45] was a Kinsman who was able to perform
[55:49] the act of Redemption on Naomi or IMC
[55:53] which was Naomi and Naomi and when he
[55:56] got Naomi got Ruth Ruth came with the
[56:00] claim that Boaz made on IMC and his
[56:03] family so Ruth was a part of that
[56:06] Redemption he not only redeemed now look
[56:09] when Jesus Christ came CU remember the
[56:12] devil could not lay claim on you he had
[56:14] no right and no ability to to exercise
[56:17] his claim on you so Jesus Christ came
[56:21] and he shed his blood and he took claim
[56:24] over the property that belonged
[56:27] rightfully to God in the beginning
[56:29] Hallelujah now not everybody rightfully
[56:31] belongs to God but I believe that I'm
[56:33] looking at a group of them that belong
[56:35] to God and if you belong to God from
[56:38] before the foundation of the world he's
[56:40] the one that had right to be able to
[56:42] come and claim you as his own amen and
[56:45] he not only claimed the Jew Naomi and
[56:49] Israel but he claimed the Gentile bride
[56:52] at the same time Lord so when he got her
[56:55] Naomi he got Ruth right when he got the
[56:58] Jew when he got his people he got the
[57:02] genti the cross was made it went from
[57:05] the older uh uh uh uh inheritance to the
[57:09] younger right it went from the tamame
[57:11] olive tree to the Wild Olive Tree it
[57:13] went from through the cross to the Bride
[57:16] of Jesus Christ the Gentile bride right
[57:19] now that Kinsman work has been done
[57:21] today amen we belong to him if we belong
[57:25] to him
[57:26] if we're born again filled with the Holy
[57:28] Ghost that is our rest amen amen we
[57:31] already talked about Israel's rest is
[57:34] their Homeland God gave them a place
[57:36] that they could go and he told them when
[57:39] you go there it'll be a place to rest
[57:41] you can go and you can set your swords
[57:43] down you've been fighting and there's
[57:45] been infighting and there's been uh all
[57:47] this all the time you can lay down your
[57:49] swords and you can just rest it's a land
[57:52] full with milk and honey you can just go
[57:55] to the land that I promis you don't
[57:57] matter who's there you hear me today
[58:00] don't matter who's there don't matter
[58:02] who's inhabiting that land right now
[58:04] it's yours amen I gave it to you
[58:07] Hallelujah so today friend it don't
[58:10] matter who's there it don't matter what
[58:12] part of it anybody's inhabiting that
[58:15] land belongs to God's people
[58:18] Amen period amen it's it belongs to the
[58:22] Jew it's theirs it's their place of rest
[58:26] and as long as they're in their Homeland
[58:28] they're blessed God blesses them that's
[58:31] why they had to all fly from all over
[58:32] the world to come back from everything
[58:34] that's going to be the 144,000 all back
[58:36] from all over the world cuz they have to
[58:38] be there to be blessed they have to be
[58:40] there to receive that uh uh uh that
[58:43] Messiah that's going to come and they're
[58:45] going to realize that they had crucified
[58:47] the very Messiah they claimed to serve
[58:49] right they say where you get those scars
[58:51] he said in the house of my friends they
[58:53] realize that they put on sackcloth and
[58:54] Ashes They Mourn but it doesn't matter
[58:57] the morning because they already know
[58:58] that is their Messiah he come and when
[59:00] he did the Redemptive work at Calvary he
[59:03] did it for them too but he come to get
[59:05] this Bri this Gentile bride and that's
[59:07] why we're about to leave this world Amen
[59:10] now this is so outstanding that that
[59:15] Boaz through Ruth became the what became
[59:19] the great grandfather of King
[59:23] David amen amen boas was the great
[59:27] grandfather of David King David Ruth the
[59:31] moabitas who received Redemptive value
[59:34] through boaz's Kinsman relationship
[59:38] became the the the grandmother the great
[59:41] grandmother excuse me great grandmother
[59:43] of King David amen praise the Lord
[59:46] that's wonderful friend amen amen
[59:49] working the work of God being at rest in
[59:53] the truth of God's word now it is very
[59:58] easy and if you watch much news at all
[1:00:01] or hear much news at all or see it in
[1:00:04] the newspaper much it's it's very easy
[1:00:07] to get yourself in a in a in a tussle
[1:00:11] it's very easy for your spirit to get
[1:00:13] all tore up with with events that's
[1:00:16] going on right it's it's really easy for
[1:00:18] that to happen and and there's nothing
[1:00:20] wrong with your civic duty there's
[1:00:22] nothing wrong with being concerned
[1:00:24] there's nothing wrong with praying
[1:00:25] there's nothing wrong with with putting
[1:00:27] action to your prayers there's nothing
[1:00:29] wrong with that but don't let your
[1:00:31] spirit become so tore up that you become
[1:00:35] uh uh less than what God wants you to be
[1:00:38] for him for you to be an instrument in
[1:00:39] his hand amen amen we can become so tore
[1:00:42] up that we become useless to the Lord
[1:00:44] people become so fixated on it yes that
[1:00:47] that it just it tears them apart and and
[1:00:50] they can't
[1:00:51] rest I I hear people sometimes say I
[1:00:54] won't rest night and day until so and so
[1:00:56] and such and such right oh friend don't
[1:00:59] let that don't let that Spirit Get On Us
[1:01:02] yes amen amen let's be at rest night and
[1:01:05] day regardless of what else takes place
[1:01:09] amen cuz we've already heard and we know
[1:01:11] God's in control of all anyway amen
[1:01:13] God's in control of it all then he's
[1:01:15] going to make it work together the way
[1:01:16] he wants to now I'm going to tell you
[1:01:18] something and I was going to type it to
[1:01:20] my next uh story but
[1:01:26] this nation is at a serious
[1:01:30] Crossroads it's in a Crossroads of a
[1:01:33] place that that that I want to say one
[1:01:37] way or the
[1:01:39] other is I is it's gonna it's going to
[1:01:43] be rough yes uh I if Biden stays
[1:01:48] president and Camala Harris the second
[1:01:52] president which become first president
[1:01:55] anyway
[1:01:56] um we already see what's going on in the
[1:01:59] world mhm right uh there's three or four
[1:02:01] countries right now completely shut down
[1:02:04] for a whole
[1:02:05] month and that's the purpose remember
[1:02:07] what I told you I did it off camera but
[1:02:09] remember what I told you five or six
[1:02:10] months ago of what this was the Lord
[1:02:13] told me in prayer of what was going on
[1:02:15] and the control and and and the uh uh
[1:02:19] trying to get people in in obedience see
[1:02:23] uh what they want to do now I I've heard
[1:02:25] people say and I agree that if if the
[1:02:28] government shuts down you say well
[1:02:30] brother not supposed to be talking
[1:02:31] politics I looked up what brother
[1:02:33] brandham talked about politics friend
[1:02:34] and I'm not going to go on about
[1:02:36] politics because this is rest but uh but
[1:02:38] he mentioned it hundreds of times right
[1:02:40] so especially when it come to Kennedy
[1:02:42] and Nixon he talked about it a lot he
[1:02:44] talked about how uh Kennedy stole the
[1:02:46] election 1960 the FBI proved it and they
[1:02:49] still did nothing about it brother Roger
[1:02:52] showed me a a a um wellow I can show you
[1:02:56] show me a picture of
[1:03:00] um of the globe now that's not not the
[1:03:04] globe's not the most reputable magazine
[1:03:06] your paper of course who are now
[1:03:09] everybody's biased and uh but on this
[1:03:12] paper I showed it to my wife if you want
[1:03:14] to see it that paper came out November's
[1:03:18] issue November this month's issue top
[1:03:21] headline Kennedy stole 1960 presidential
[1:03:25] election Nixon was the real winner right
[1:03:28] told us that in 1960 right after it
[1:03:30] happened yes he did he told us that 60
[1:03:33] years ago that that had happened and
[1:03:35] they proved it by the ballot booze that
[1:03:37] it was
[1:03:39] stolen now that now this month they're
[1:03:41] now running this how coincidental is
[1:03:44] that I I mean I don't know but look at
[1:03:46] it now people people scream and yell uh
[1:03:50] Trump Trump trump I think Trump did a
[1:03:52] great job for this nation I I'll be
[1:03:54] honest he made this country more
[1:03:56] prosperous than probably any present
[1:03:58] maybe since
[1:04:00] Reagan uh Clinton did good with the
[1:04:03] balancing budget and stuff but that was
[1:04:05] a whole different scenario but it it was
[1:04:08] blessed and prosperous uh so I I'll tell
[1:04:12] you uh now one way or the other uh like
[1:04:16] Zach said one way or the other uh I'm
[1:04:19] gonna tell you friend try to hold on to
[1:04:21] what you got uh because there's a very
[1:04:25] good good chance that some really uh
[1:04:27] hard times are about to hit amen now and
[1:04:31] you say well you know Trump a man well
[1:04:33] he may be and if he is that's fine if
[1:04:35] that's because but it'll take a miracle
[1:04:37] to put him in office now and if it does
[1:04:40] then it'll just be a miracle I thought
[1:04:43] it was a miracle if Biden wins so
[1:04:45] whatever Supernatural event or cheating
[1:04:47] whatever going on uh God sets them up
[1:04:49] and God puts them down right that's what
[1:04:52] the Bible says so he sets the Kings up
[1:04:54] and he takes the Kings down so whatever
[1:04:56] he does there but what I see here what I
[1:04:59] see here is even if he were to you think
[1:05:03] about for a moment with all this has
[1:05:06] happened and declaration for Biden
[1:05:08] getting the presidency think about this
[1:05:10] for a minute what if through recounts
[1:05:13] and litigation Trump gets the White
[1:05:15] House back again can you imagine you
[1:05:18] think they've been rioting and looting
[1:05:20] and killing and burning buildings down
[1:05:23] now if that happened this country would
[1:05:26] be so divided more divided it's been
[1:05:28] since the Civil War right amen amen
[1:05:31] it'll rip it completely apart you won't
[1:05:33] you haven't seen riding and looting and
[1:05:36] burning down unless something like that
[1:05:38] happens
[1:05:39] right the other
[1:05:41] way uh everything's probably just going
[1:05:43] to be shut
[1:05:45] down country will just be shut down
[1:05:47] you'll probably we you'll probably be
[1:05:49] required to wear a mask in your
[1:05:52] shower country will be shut down I'm
[1:05:55] telling you
[1:05:56] you see countries are already doing it I
[1:05:58] read an article this week from a certain
[1:06:00] news organization not Fox but a
[1:06:03] different news organization paper that
[1:06:05] talked about that this um this priest
[1:06:08] now you talk about well brother new you
[1:06:11] talking about politics no I'm talking
[1:06:13] about I'm talking about prophecy I'm
[1:06:15] talking about the word is sometimes it's
[1:06:18] hard because the two intermingle so much
[1:06:21] amen but I read this article and it
[1:06:23] talked about this Archbishop had sent a
[1:06:26] letter to Trump and a lot of people
[1:06:28] believed that he was the last Garrison
[1:06:30] to hold back this globalism to where
[1:06:33] these great people that are in power and
[1:06:37] countries around the world are already
[1:06:38] giving to it because you see them they
[1:06:41] they are setting down he he said they
[1:06:43] will shut down those countries again and
[1:06:46] that was six months ago and just this
[1:06:49] month two or three countries started
[1:06:50] doing that so he was right they are
[1:06:54] starting to shut it down what do they
[1:06:55] doing just like I told you the warning
[1:06:58] the lord gave me it's control they're
[1:07:00] trying to take over the people they're
[1:07:02] trying to take over the ones that have
[1:07:04] no voice you think you do but you don't
[1:07:08] to take over the people that don't have
[1:07:10] money only the people that have money
[1:07:12] and popularity and power those are the
[1:07:14] ones that want to take over the whole
[1:07:16] system why are they going to do that
[1:07:18] because Revelation 17 tells us there's a
[1:07:21] beast that's going to rise up and take
[1:07:23] over this whole thing amen amen it's
[1:07:25] going to be in that same venue and some
[1:07:29] people well if the government shuts it
[1:07:32] down then they have a right to pay the
[1:07:34] people so they can stay alive I agree
[1:07:37] with that to a point because understand
[1:07:41] something the more the government pays
[1:07:44] you the more they own you right right
[1:07:48] amen you go to communist countries North
[1:07:50] Korea China and Russia ask them if
[1:07:52] that's not true right just recently few
[1:07:55] months ago China went through homes
[1:07:57] Christian homes homes with the Bible
[1:07:59] homes with the pictures of Christ up and
[1:08:02] they said take that picture down and put
[1:08:04] up Shan pay that's right if you want any
[1:08:08] assistance from our government you're
[1:08:10] going to take that down you're going to
[1:08:11] get rid of that Bible and you're going
[1:08:13] to claim allegiance to the to the uh to
[1:08:15] Jay Jen ping it's exactly what they did
[1:08:18] no more than a couple months ago because
[1:08:21] they control those people you say oh
[1:08:24] well they pay us that's wonderful that's
[1:08:26] great that's fine but the more they pay
[1:08:28] you the more they own you right because
[1:08:32] if you become Reliant and dependent on
[1:08:34] them all they have to do is snap a
[1:08:37] finger take it away and then what do you
[1:08:38] do right right you have no jobs you have
[1:08:42] nothing you can do or it it it's down to
[1:08:45] that
[1:08:46] point it's down to that
[1:08:50] point I'm not saying this is
[1:08:53] it and I don't know if it will be or
[1:08:56] not but brother bandham said several
[1:09:00] times one here from that time 19 July
[1:09:04] 1960 he said I won't have time the
[1:09:07] meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a
[1:09:09] woman's Nation it's number 13 Pier's
[1:09:11] 13th chapter Revelation 13 star 13
[1:09:14] stripes everything 13 everything's a
[1:09:16] woman remember thus sayith the Lord amen
[1:09:20] there will be a woman ruled before the
[1:09:23] end time before the end time amen she'll
[1:09:27] either be president or vice president or
[1:09:30] it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman
[1:09:32] I've seen her a great woman the nation
[1:09:35] bowed to her it'll be one before the end
[1:09:38] time thus sayth the Lord write it down
[1:09:41] find out young people that it doesn't
[1:09:43] happen I'm a false
[1:09:44] prophet now there was all the turmoil
[1:09:48] about Hillary Clinton right woman
[1:09:51] president everybody thought she was
[1:09:53] going to be the woman president people I
[1:09:55] know told me that they knew people that
[1:09:58] quit this message when she lost the
[1:09:59] election because she was surely the one
[1:10:02] yeah now she was a great powerful woman
[1:10:06] she was wicked at heart which brother
[1:10:08] Bram said it' be evil a wicked at
[1:10:11] heart but I couldn't get past the
[1:10:14] beautiful
[1:10:15] part uh I I I'm sorry I'm sure maybe you
[1:10:20] know to some people she probably was an
[1:10:22] attractive woman I don't know to me I
[1:10:24] looked and I thought a wholesale beauty
[1:10:26] that brother bam talked about she wasn't
[1:10:28] it she just wasn't it but look at the
[1:10:32] woman now that's right my wife doesn't
[1:10:35] think she's attractive I think she's
[1:10:36] attractive yeah I think she's an
[1:10:38] attractive woman Wicked at
[1:10:41] heart oh my the woman she had she
[1:10:45] started a uh or helped start a fund with
[1:10:50] money in it to bail out the people that
[1:10:53] were rooting and Li and riding and
[1:10:55] burning down buildings
[1:10:57] yeah she believes in partial birth
[1:11:01] abortion that the baby's head come out
[1:11:03] cut it off
[1:11:06] done Wicked at heart beautiful is that
[1:11:10] the one I don't know a lot of people
[1:11:12] might claim this that and the other I
[1:11:14] don't know right B's Catholic could be
[1:11:17] Catholic church and the woman they're
[1:11:19] combin together I mean we don't know we
[1:11:22] do know as Zach said as uh brother Denis
[1:11:25] has said God's in control of it amen our
[1:11:28] job is to rest amen is to rest in the
[1:11:31] promise that God give us now that being
[1:11:34] said I want to read one quote about Ruth
[1:11:35] and I want to enter into the next part
[1:11:37] of this and when Ruth was resting it was
[1:11:41] a type of the church resting in the
[1:11:43] promises of God Amen resting in the
[1:11:46] promises of God is that okay you rest in
[1:11:48] the promises of God today can we get
[1:11:51] past all the other and everything going
[1:11:52] on no matter you can be in the middle of
[1:11:55] a whirlwind friend and you can still be
[1:11:57] at peace amen you can still be at rest
[1:11:59] cuz you know who your maker is yes you
[1:12:01] know it's God in control of it and if
[1:12:03] God is allowing this to happen and and
[1:12:06] whether it's by uh deceit or vote change
[1:12:09] or whatever now we know that that
[1:12:11] happened with Biden because or Biden
[1:12:13] excuse me Kennedy because it proved it
[1:12:16] but then maybe it wasn't time so to and
[1:12:19] a half years later he's done I hate to
[1:12:22] say it that way he was murdered uh
[1:12:25] Kennedy was killed 2 and 1/2 years later
[1:12:27] so I don't know maybe that maybe he
[1:12:29] needed to be elected what time I don't
[1:12:31] know uh because sometimes this we just
[1:12:34] Prospect about it we're not absolutely
[1:12:36] sure right but in the middle of all that
[1:12:38] we know that we can be at rest amen
[1:12:41] whether an election stolen people say
[1:12:44] it's stolen I don't know if it was
[1:12:45] stolen could have been maybe not
[1:12:46] everything's so crooked now it doesn't I
[1:12:48] mean and people scream on one side of
[1:12:51] the other the reason I always identify
[1:12:53] with moderates and Republicans is
[1:12:55] because I I feel they have a lot more
[1:12:57] values than I share uh like not
[1:13:00] anti-abortion so anyway um but at rest
[1:13:05] at rest either way I'm at rest either
[1:13:08] way amen doesn't matter uh one way or
[1:13:11] the other uh whichever way it goes is
[1:13:14] still not going uphill it's going down
[1:13:18] heel resting in the promises of God how
[1:13:21] many promises of God do we have we have
[1:13:24] the earnest now of our Salvation what's
[1:13:26] the earnest that's the Holy Ghost holy
[1:13:30] spirit's the earnest so if you have the
[1:13:31] Holy Spirit you're born again you now
[1:13:34] have that Earnest that's in you we're
[1:13:37] not worried whether we're going over or
[1:13:39] not we're going amen amen praise the
[1:13:43] Lord amen we're not worried of whether
[1:13:44] or not we're going we're going amen
[1:13:48] because God said
[1:13:50] so God promised it and we have the
[1:13:53] promise we have the earnest
[1:13:56] done been received Christ has accepted
[1:13:59] us no way to get away from it now we are
[1:14:02] there amen amen amen all we have to do
[1:14:07] he's uh writing down the kidsman
[1:14:10] Redeemer we have the earnest of it right
[1:14:12] now waiting let's go to uh another
[1:14:16] scripture in
[1:14:21] Psalms Psalms chapter 95
[1:14:26] all the things I felt the Lord had put
[1:14:28] on my heart I wasn't sure if I was going
[1:14:29] to
[1:14:30] say
[1:14:32] so now I know amen and now you know
[1:14:36] those are things that's just been on my
[1:14:37] heart now there been other things beyond
[1:14:40] that and you can and I have my personal
[1:14:42] opinion and if you want to I'm not going
[1:14:44] to give my personal opinion as far as
[1:14:45] that goes and you can ask me later if
[1:14:47] you want to know what it is that's fine
[1:14:49] but in my personal opinion I don't want
[1:14:51] to add to effect what the word is here
[1:14:54] amen the word word is the
[1:14:56] word regardless of our personal opinion
[1:14:58] word's a word amen uh Psalms chapter
[1:15:03] 95 let's begin with verse
[1:15:06] 7even for he is our God and we are the
[1:15:10] people of his pasture and the Sheep of
[1:15:13] his hand amen a't that beautiful today
[1:15:17] if you will hear his voice Harden not
[1:15:20] your heart as in the provocations and as
[1:15:23] in the days of Temptation in the
[1:15:25] wilderness when your fathers tempted me
[1:15:27] proved me and saw my work 40 years long
[1:15:30] was I grieved with this generation and
[1:15:33] said it is a people that do error in
[1:15:35] their heart and they have uh and they
[1:15:38] have not known my ways unto whom I swear
[1:15:42] in my wrath that they should not enter
[1:15:45] into my rest now what's David talking
[1:15:47] about David of course we see when he
[1:15:50] talks about the Wilderness he's talking
[1:15:52] about the children of Israel children of
[1:15:54] Israel being in Egypt for 400 years in
[1:15:56] bondage in bondage enslaved to their
[1:15:59] enemy which became their enemy they were
[1:16:02] enslaved by the Egyptians and for 400
[1:16:06] years were slaves enslaved by the
[1:16:09] Egyptians God comes to deliver them God
[1:16:13] sends Moses to deliver to deliver them
[1:16:15] out of the hands of the Egyptians out of
[1:16:17] the land of Egypt God comes and delivers
[1:16:20] them now before God delivers them what
[1:16:23] does he do he sends
[1:16:26] plagues he sends uh pestilence and
[1:16:30] plagues upon the land of Egypt right
[1:16:34] well who is in the land of
[1:16:36] Egypt
[1:16:38] Egyptians and
[1:16:41] Israel they're all there in Egypt
[1:16:45] they're all a part of the same land
[1:16:48] Egyptians were in one place of course uh
[1:16:51] Israel was in
[1:16:52] Goan which they were was not their
[1:16:55] promised land they were in Goan but it
[1:16:57] was still Egypt so understand all of
[1:17:01] them all of God's children all the
[1:17:04] Israelites were in Egypt while the
[1:17:07] plagues were hitting Egypt right they
[1:17:10] were in the
[1:17:11] plagues but they weren't affected by the
[1:17:15] plagues amen they were in the middle of
[1:17:18] all of the plagues that was going on in
[1:17:20] that country but they weren't affected
[1:17:22] by the plagues God continued to bless
[1:17:25] them and prosper them and be with them
[1:17:28] every step even though they were in the
[1:17:30] middle of all that was going on around
[1:17:32] them right yes now when God went to
[1:17:35] deliver them because you know the story
[1:17:39] when God went to deliver them the
[1:17:42] provocation came when some of them many
[1:17:46] of them begin to murmur and complain
[1:17:49] against Moses and when they murmured and
[1:17:52] complained against Moses they were
[1:17:53] actually murmuring and complaining
[1:17:55] against God cuz God was the one leading
[1:17:58] Moses and God told Moses that they
[1:18:01] rejected you they rejected me amen they
[1:18:04] murmured and complained oh we should
[1:18:06] have just been back how many times did
[1:18:08] they tell Moses how many times they tell
[1:18:10] the a group of people around we should
[1:18:12] have just stayed in Egypt we had the
[1:18:15] flesh pots in Egypt we had this in Egypt

[1:18:25] back and the stripes so they beat you
[1:18:27] your hands so GED you oh but they were
[1:18:31] so good to us they took care of us and
[1:18:34] we should have just stayed in Egypt some
[1:18:37] of those people even in the middle of
[1:18:40] Egypt even though they were exempt from
[1:18:42] all the the the the pestilence and the
[1:18:45] plagues and and judgments that God was
[1:18:48] sending down even though they were there
[1:18:50] they were in Egypt so many of those
[1:18:54] people so many of Egypt or or or
[1:18:57] Israel became so affected by Egypt and
[1:19:01] they had so much Egypt in their hearts
[1:19:04] that when they actually were delivered
[1:19:06] from Egypt they wanted to go back right
[1:19:09] right they would preferred staying in
[1:19:12] the world than being delivered by God to
[1:19:16] a Promised Land
[1:19:18] amen some of them because they were in
[1:19:22] Satan's Eden because they were in leoda

[1:21:26] those people provoking God saying all
[1:21:29] kind of evil and wicked things against
[1:21:31] Moses and against God because their
[1:21:34] heart was back in Egypt right their body
[1:21:37] had been delivered but their heart was
[1:21:39] still in

[1:22:36] with God his heart was in the world
[1:22:39] right but now as God is about to deliver
[1:22:43] us as God is about to take his children
[1:22:46] home if this is another prophecy being
[1:22:49] fulfilled right if I knew look I'm going
[1:22:53] to say something very bold here
[1:22:55] if I knew that this is up because it
[1:23:00] won't be up until go all of God's chosen
[1:23:02] are in right we know that but if that
[1:23:05] last seat is in and I knew that this was
[1:23:08] to be the thing to Usher that in I would
[1:23:10] have voted for
[1:23:12] Biden I just told you who I voted for I
[1:23:15] wasn't supposed to do
[1:23:17] that but could it be I don't know I
[1:23:20] don't know if it is or not might be
[1:23:23] possible
[1:23:26] because no matter what roadblocks there
[1:23:28] are to stop it nothing's going to stop
[1:23:30] the work of God Amen nothing's going to
[1:23:33] stop it amen no matter what has to take
[1:23:35] place or what's going on you say wellow
[1:23:37] they lied they cheated they stole okay
[1:23:39] that's fine but when God had to
[1:23:41] accomplish something with Ahab what did
[1:23:43] he do he sent a lying Spirit down to go
[1:23:46] deceive those 400 prophets amen that's
[1:23:48] what the Bible says right God did that
[1:23:52] well if God did it then could he not do
[1:23:53] it now
[1:23:55] amen amen Satan friend listen Satan is
[1:23:59] simply a tool in the hand of God that's
[1:24:02] all he is right that's all he is all the
[1:24:04] destruction all the things going on yeah
[1:24:06] that's up the devil yeah it is but who
[1:24:08] do you think's allowing it right amen
[1:24:11] amen right God has to be the one
[1:24:13] allowing it maybe even orchestrating it
[1:24:15] but he's using the devil to do it right
[1:24:18] he's just a tool in the hand of God
[1:24:20] that's all he is let's go to another
[1:24:22] scripture here Hebrews chapter
[1:24:26] 4 hopefully it's getting us to the place
[1:24:30] to understand friend it's just it's just
[1:24:31] a rest when you get to a point in your
[1:24:34] relationship with Jesus Christ trusting
[1:24:36] and believing we all have a relationship
[1:24:39] with Jesus Christ you get to that place
[1:24:41] that's a place of rest amen you get to a
[1:24:44] certain place in there you're rest now
[1:24:46] you're not complacent I don't mean that
[1:24:49] you're not just sitting on the seat of
[1:24:50] do nothing and just complacent no no
[1:24:52] you're just you're just at rest it
[1:24:54] doesn't and rest doesn't mean that you
[1:24:56] don't go to work and earn a living right
[1:24:58] rest doesn't mean this kind of rest
[1:24:59] doesn't mean that you don't put food on
[1:25:01] your table and clothes on your back roof
[1:25:03] over your head that's not that I'm not
[1:25:05] talking about that amen it's the rest in
[1:25:07] knowing that the promise of God's word
[1:25:09] applies to you yes and we're
[1:25:13] not as brother Adam said worried about
[1:25:16] whether we're going there because we're
[1:25:19] going amen God's already made that loud
[1:25:22] and clear he told us we're going now a
[1:25:26] little more as I finish up on the
[1:25:29] rest Hebrews
[1:25:33] 4:1 let us therefore fear lest the
[1:25:37] promise being left us of entering into
[1:25:40] his rest any of you should seem to come
[1:25:43] short of it and I I I talk to people
[1:25:46] sometime and they been in the uh uh the
[1:25:51] the word a long time they've been
[1:25:53] Christians a long time they've been in
[1:25:54] the message a long time they they they
[1:25:56] have a relationship they say with the
[1:25:57] Lord and and and yet they seem to
[1:25:59] somehow be be short of that
[1:26:02] rest they just can't seem to enter into
[1:26:05] that rest they enter into that place of
[1:26:08] of of of knowing that God is taking care
[1:26:11] of it it it's all
[1:26:13] okay I know those are strange words to
[1:26:16] say in today's Dynamic but it's all okay
[1:26:19] amen it really is as much as I look at
[1:26:22] it and it Grieves me
[1:26:24] it it's all okay amen amen remember the
[1:26:28] Bible says even lot the person he
[1:26:30] was e even the sin of Sodom grieved his
[1:26:34] V uh righteous Soul daily the Bible said
[1:26:38] right so yeah it's hard of that but that
[1:26:40] doesn't mean that I'm unrested about it
[1:26:42] it's okay God's going to take care of it
[1:26:45] yes it's going to work out fine God's
[1:26:47] going to make it work and and not only
[1:26:49] that but all of that's going to work
[1:26:50] together for our good anyway because we
[1:26:52] love him amen amen we love
[1:26:56] him but some come short of that rest if
[1:27:00] you're missing that rest today if it
[1:27:02] doesn't seem like you're able to get
[1:27:04] into that rest you have to trust the
[1:27:07] Lord amen and fir first you must be born
[1:27:11] again you have the Holy Ghost because
[1:27:12] that is the rest the Holy Ghost is our
[1:27:14] rest the promised land for Israel that
[1:27:16] was their rest the Holy Ghost is our
[1:27:18] rest amen we're in that rest that's the
[1:27:21] Lord's given us don't fall short of that
[1:27:22] rest no that the promised word of God is
[1:27:25] going to come to pass in our life God

[1:27:30] and there won't be one God cannot lose
[1:27:34] one amen cannot you say well someone

[1:27:49] are you resting in that you you are you
[1:27:52] believing and trusting God's word and
[1:27:54] promises amen amen amen for unto us was
[1:27:58] the Gospel preached as well as unto them
[1:28:00] but the word preached did not profit
[1:28:02] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:28:05] that hurt it now that brings Faith
[1:28:07] brings a rest
[1:28:09] see for we which uh for we which have
[1:28:12] believed do enter into rest as he said
[1:28:16] as I have sworn in my wrath if they
[1:28:18] shall enter into my rest although the
[1:28:20] works were finished from the foundation
[1:28:22] of the world for he SP uh spake in a
[1:28:25] certain place the seventh day on this
[1:28:27] wise and God did rest the seventh day
[1:28:30] from all his works and in this place
[1:28:33] again if they shall enter into my rest
[1:28:37] amen there's a difference in the rest of
[1:28:39] the world rest in the world and the rest
[1:28:41] in Christ see his rest yes he works six
[1:28:45] days rest the seventh there's a great
[1:28:47] fight that people have had about the
[1:28:49] Sabbath day which is the Sabbath day you
[1:28:51] had uh sabbatarians believe Saturday uh
[1:28:56] they believe that the Saturday is the
[1:28:57] Sabbath well that was that was the
[1:28:59] seventh day that was the end of the week
[1:29:01] yeah we we celebrate that and and we
[1:29:04] meet together as we consider a Sabbath
[1:29:07] Day on Sunday but the Sabbath day is
[1:29:09] neither Saturday nor Sunday the rest is
[1:29:12] neither Saturday nor Sunday it's a
[1:29:14] Perpetual existence it's a Perpetual
[1:29:17] being in the presence of God always not
[1:29:20] just on Saturday or Sunday right we
[1:29:22] don't come to just meet with God here
[1:29:24] we do come to meet with him here but not
[1:29:26] just here our whole lives should be
[1:29:28] engulfed with the presence and the rest
[1:29:30] of God every day not one day not
[1:29:33] Saturday not Sunday Saturday's the end
[1:29:36] of the week yeah that's when God rested
[1:29:38] but the but the first day is a type of
[1:29:41] the eighth day which is a rolling over
[1:29:43] into eternity right well what that's a
[1:29:46] brand new day when Jesus Christ died
[1:29:50] that was a day but when he rose again
[1:29:51] that was a new day amen that's started a
[1:29:54] new life it started a new everything
[1:29:56] started a new then cuz it was a new day
[1:30:00] The Eighth Day rolls over into eternity
[1:30:03] it'll do it again amen we go through the
[1:30:06] seven Church ages in the Millennium
[1:30:07] it'll roll over again amen praise the
[1:30:10] Lord and in and in this time it ERS into
[1:30:13] eternity that last day time will cease
[1:30:17] and will enter into eternity amen that's
[1:30:20] the Eternal rest but we're already
[1:30:23] partakers of that rest right now amen
[1:30:26] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:30:28] seventh day on this wise God did rest
[1:30:30] the seventh day all his Works in this
[1:30:31] place again if they shall enter into my
[1:30:33] rest seeing therefore it remaineth that
[1:30:36] some must enter therein and they do whom
[1:30:39] uh and they do and they to whom it was
[1:30:42] first preached enter not in because of
[1:30:45] unbelief again he limith a certain day
[1:30:48] saying in David today after so long a
[1:30:51] time as it is said today is if you will
[1:30:54] hear the his voice Harden not your
[1:30:56] hearts for if Jesus had given them rest
[1:31:00] then would he not afterward have spoken
[1:31:03] of another day there remaineth therefore
[1:31:06] there remaineth amen remaineth what is
[1:31:09] remaineth mean remaineth means it was
[1:31:12] there and it stays there right remaineth
[1:31:16] doesn't mean that it just came it me it
[1:31:19] means it was already there and it
[1:31:22] remains there it doesn't leave praise
[1:31:26] the Lord there remaineth therefore a
[1:31:29] rest to the people of God now do you
[1:31:32] consider yourself a people of God Amen a
[1:31:35] person of God Amen do you consider
[1:31:37] yourself a child of God well that could
[1:31:39] be a further question that you need to
[1:31:40] answer for yourself I can't do that
[1:31:43] right you have to do that for yourself
[1:31:45] whether you're streaming whether you're
[1:31:46] going to watch this archive whether
[1:31:47] you're here today you've got to answer
[1:31:49] that for yourself if you're a child of
[1:31:51] God then this pertains to you amen
[1:31:54] remains a rest for the people of God it
[1:31:59] continues it's not just on a Saturday or
[1:32:01] a Sunday or any day of the week it's
[1:32:04] here and it
[1:32:06] continues for he that is entered into
[1:32:08] his rest he also has ceased from his own
[1:32:11] works as God did from his let us labor
[1:32:15] now again that doesn't he's not talking
[1:32:17] about not going to the job not earning
[1:32:19] money and that's not what he's talking
[1:32:21] about he's talking about laboring over
[1:32:24] whether you're born again whether you're
[1:32:25] a Christian whether you uh uh belong to
[1:32:28] God or not whether your name was in The
[1:32:30] Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life he's
[1:32:32] talking about all that laborous things
[1:32:34] of of of of of indecision and and and
[1:32:39] decisiveness uh that that Satan wants to
[1:32:41] try to bring doubt into you all the time
[1:32:43] and that doubt he brings into you is by
[1:32:45] fear see that's the work he's talking
[1:32:48] about cease from my own works as God did
[1:32:50] from his let us labor therefore to enter
[1:32:52] into that rest let us labor to enter
[1:32:56] into
[1:32:57] rest amen that sounds contradictory
[1:33:00] doesn't but it's absolute truth well
[1:33:02] read a scripture here because he goes on
[1:33:05] in the sixth chapter but um let's see
[1:33:09] we'll we'll just stop here uh lest any
[1:33:12] man fall after the same example of
[1:33:15] unbelief for the word of God is quick
[1:33:16] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[1:33:18] sword piercing even the dividing ther of
[1:33:21] Soul and Spirit and is and of the joint
[1:33:23] and marrows anderer of thoughts intents
[1:33:26] the heart that's the Holy Spirit the
[1:33:28] word but now if you go down to the sixth
[1:33:31] chapter first verse it says therefore
[1:33:32] leaving the principles the principles of
[1:33:35] the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[1:33:39] Perfection let us go on unto Perfection
[1:33:42] what does the Perfection produce it's
[1:33:44] not a Perfection of saying that I am a
[1:33:46] sinless human it's a Perfection of
[1:33:48] knowing that you are mature in Christ in
[1:33:50] the body of Christ in his word go on
[1:33:54] into perfection in that Perfection is
[1:33:57] rest amen
[1:34:01] if it's probably impossible but let's
[1:34:04] just say that somebody let's just say an
[1:34:08] artist crafted the perfect
[1:34:11] painting and they and they in their eyes
[1:34:14] because they're the master they're the
[1:34:16] uh ones the painter they're the artist

[1:34:22] perfect amen I appreciate Angel and both
[1:34:26] both angels and um his brother painting
[1:34:30] this but let just say it's a painting of
[1:34:33] a of of a landscape well the artist
[1:34:36] looks at it he says oh I'm I'm done with
[1:34:38] that painting he signs his name on it he
[1:34:41] puts his name on the painting right
[1:34:43] that's right I haven't seen any in the
[1:34:44] corners there so I guess y'all didn't
[1:34:46] sign but he signs it in the bottom right
[1:34:49] hand corner that's his painting her
[1:34:51] painting whoever that's their painting
[1:34:55] phito done finished it's perfect amen
[1:34:59] it's exactly the way I saw it it's
[1:35:02] exactly the way I wanted it to be
[1:35:04] there's not one more brush stroke needs
[1:35:05] to hit that canvas cuz it's perfect the
[1:35:07] way it is amen he can look at it and
[1:35:09] he's said that's
[1:35:12] it
[1:35:14] amen perfect amen he's not laboring over
[1:35:18] another leaf or Another Hill whether
[1:35:21] certain colors right he's rest he's done
[1:35:24] it's complete it's finished I'm resting
[1:35:26] it's perfect when you enter into that
[1:35:29] place of perfection what what do it mean
[1:35:32] it just means you're in that place of of
[1:35:34] where God saw you from before the
[1:35:36] foundation of the world Amen nothing
[1:35:38] added nothing taken away is is
[1:35:41] perfection Amen in these bodies yes we
[1:35:43] still get sick we still have needs and
[1:35:45] things that happen and we do things that
[1:35:47] are wrong or say something's wrong or
[1:35:48] things like that that's the stickiness
[1:35:50] of this flesh still but the Perfection
[1:35:52] of that is still entered in into that uh
[1:35:55] uh entering into that rest and when he
[1:35:57] says here let us go on unto Perfection
[1:36:00] what he's saying again is we're not
[1:36:03] going to take this painting and we G to
[1:36:05] say oh I hate that part or I hate this
[1:36:07] part no God's already signed his name
[1:36:10] he's already amen by placing his life in
[1:36:13] you he signed his name to you you are
[1:36:17] exactly the way he saw it before the
[1:36:19] foundation of the world there's not
[1:36:21] another bre breast uh uh breast stroke
[1:36:23] needs to hit you you're finished
[1:36:26] Hallelujah and he signs it with the Holy
[1:36:29] Ghost and places his own life in you not
[1:36:33] another brush stroke needs to hit it so
[1:36:36] when he says this we're not laying again
[1:36:38] the foundation repentance of dead works
[1:36:39] and Faith towards uh Faith towards God
[1:36:42] that's what you're resting from amen
[1:36:44] you're not struggling to come back and
[1:36:46] say oh man that that needs to be changed
[1:36:48] and this is changed and I need to add a
[1:36:50] color here to another painting is
[1:36:52] finished right is perfect it's the way
[1:36:55] you saw it you signed your name to it
[1:36:57] it's done amen and people just don't
[1:37:01] trust God enough sometimes to believe
[1:37:04] that God has put his spirit in them and
[1:37:08] has finished the work amen they want to
[1:37:11] go back and they want to they they want
[1:37:13] to lay another Foundation uh repentance
[1:37:16] uh I got to get baptized again I I got
[1:37:19] to do this work again I I got to do this
[1:37:22] uh thing that whatever ever it is this
[1:37:24] work has got to be done and people are
[1:37:25] just constantly laboring over their own
[1:37:28] salvation when it wasn't Theirs to labor
[1:37:30] over to begin with amen God finished
[1:37:34] your salvation at Calvary all you have
[1:37:36] to do
[1:37:37] is it's perfect it's finished when Jesus
[1:37:42] was hanging on the cross he said it is
[1:37:45] finished amen yes God signed his name on
[1:37:48] that scene amen God signed his name on
[1:37:50] that scene cuz it pleased the father to
[1:37:52] bruise him amen he he signed his name on
[1:37:56] it it's finished and now we look to that
[1:37:59] cross we look to that cross is a
[1:38:02] finished work in our lives we don't have
[1:38:04] to go back and worry about laying other
[1:38:06] foundations oh I got to do this again
[1:38:08] and I got to oh I made a mistake so I
[1:38:10] better go get baptized again no no no no
[1:38:13] no you're at rest amen now you might go
[1:38:16] to the father and say Lord forgive me I
[1:38:18] made a mistake Lord and you repent and
[1:38:20] you ask forgiveness and you pray the
[1:38:22] Lord that's perfectly fine
[1:38:24] amen but that doesn't take away your
[1:38:25] rest amen your rest is still there in
[1:38:28] the work of Christ not in your work in
[1:38:31] his work so many people are worried
[1:38:33] about their work and getting to uh uh
[1:38:36] getting to heaven on their work you
[1:38:38] don't get to heaven on your work get to
[1:38:40] heaven on his work just trust him
[1:38:44] believe it rest in it when you get to
[1:38:47] that place you just you rest in the Lord
[1:38:49] amen you rest in his word of the
[1:38:52] doctrines of baptisms and the laying on
[1:38:54] of hands resurrection of the Dead
[1:38:56] Eternal judgment uh all those things
[1:38:59] they labor after we're not laboring over
[1:39:02] those things friend we're at rest amen
[1:39:05] we're at rest we we' we've obeyed the
[1:39:07] word we fulfilled the part of the word
[1:39:09] that God give to us now we rest in that
[1:39:12] we stand upon that word God has give us
[1:39:15] to rest let me read this I got a couple
[1:39:18] more scriptures but I'm going to close
[1:39:21] time is up here the uh seven Church ages
[1:39:24] in the patmas vision it's a little
[1:39:26] lengthy but I'll try to cut it off a
[1:39:27] little bit let's see the Bible teaches
[1:39:29] us about this sabbath rest for he that
[1:39:32] is entered into his rest this entering
[1:39:34] in is not only entering in but remaining
[1:39:38] in rest not just entering in remaining
[1:39:42] in that rest am
[1:39:44] amen it is an eternal rest of which the
[1:39:48] seventh day is simply a type seven is
[1:39:51] completion eight is the first day again
[1:39:54] we talked about that Jesus resurrection
[1:39:56] was on the first day of the week what
[1:39:58] recalling bringing forth a new day amen
[1:40:02] a new week A New
[1:40:05] Beginning first day of the week giving
[1:40:08] us eternal life and eternal Sabbath rest
[1:40:12] thus with because if Christ had not
[1:40:14] resurrected there would be no rest
[1:40:16] there' be no Holy Ghost there be no rest
[1:40:18] amen if there's no rest then we continue
[1:40:20] to labor but as that eternity broke
[1:40:23] forth through the resurrection of Jesus
[1:40:25] Christ as that eternity broke forth it
[1:40:27] broke us forth into that into Christ and
[1:40:30] into that rest
[1:40:32] amen which Israel could not do having
[1:40:35] only a shadow of the true substance
[1:40:37] which we enjoy we go uh why we go back
[1:40:40] to a shadow when we have the reality of
[1:40:42] it now how we receive this rest or
[1:40:45] continuing Sabbath is at the invitation
[1:40:48] of Jesus he said in Matthew 11: 28:29
[1:40:52] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:40:54] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:40:56] amen take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:40:59] me and you shall find rest or keeping of
[1:41:02] the Sabbath not a day but an eternal
[1:41:06] life Sabbath unto your souls a rest unto
[1:41:09] your souls amen this body may get tired
[1:41:13] it may uh fight and struggle with with a
[1:41:16] sickness or with uh laboring on a job or
[1:41:19] something but our souls have entered
[1:41:22] into that rest
[1:41:23] no matter how long you have been
[1:41:25] laboring under the load of sin whether
[1:41:27] it's 10 years 30 years 50 years no
[1:41:29] longer or or longer come with your tired
[1:41:33] weary life and you will find rest in
[1:41:35] this true Sabbath yes Jesus will give
[1:41:38] you rest now exactly what is that rest
[1:41:41] Jesus will give Isaiah 28 8-12 for all
[1:41:45] tables are full of vomit and filthiness
[1:41:46] so that there is no place
[1:41:49] clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom
[1:41:51] Shall he make to understand doctr to
[1:41:53] them wean from the milk drawn from the
[1:41:55] breast for precept must be upon precept
[1:41:58] precept upon precept line upon line line
[1:42:00] upon line here a little there a little
[1:42:02] for with stammering lips and other
[1:42:03] tongue will I speak to this people the
[1:42:06] Holy Ghost amen Pentecost will I speak
[1:42:09] to this people to whom he said this is
[1:42:14] the
[1:42:15] rest amen this is the rest not something
[1:42:18] to continue uh uh else to come but a
[1:42:21] rest a settlement
[1:42:27] a
[1:42:28] refreshing this is the rest Sabbath
[1:42:30] wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest
[1:42:33] or keeping of his Sabbath and this is
[1:42:35] the refreshing yet you would not hear
[1:42:38] here it is prophesied again here in
[1:42:40] Isaiah and it came to pass about 700
[1:42:42] years later at Pentecost when they're
[1:42:44] all filled with the Holy Ghost exactly
[1:42:46] as it was and that said that it would be
[1:42:48] this is the true Sabbath that was
[1:42:50] promised thus when they were filled with
[1:42:52] the whole Holy Ghost they cease from
[1:42:55] their worldly Works they're laboring in
[1:42:58] sin their worldly doings their evil ways
[1:43:02] the Holy Ghost took charge of their
[1:43:03] lives they entered into rest there is
[1:43:05] your rest there is your Sabbath it is
[1:43:07] not a day nor a year but the eternity of
[1:43:10] being filled and blessed in the holy
[1:43:13] spirit amen it it is you ceasing and God
[1:43:17] doing amen praise the Lord resting in
[1:43:21] the promise of his word resting in in
[1:43:24] the uh in the holy spirit that God has
[1:43:26] given us that rest
[1:43:29] amen amen in the
[1:43:33] rest in the middle of a storm in the
[1:43:36] rest in the middle of
[1:43:40] chaos I'm going to give you this story
[1:43:43] just came to my mind as I close we lived
[1:43:46] in St Augustin
[1:43:48] Florida and for three and a half
[1:43:51] years and
[1:43:53] uh I had gotten to the place the other
[1:43:55] day I thought I'm I am embarrassed to
[1:43:56] say I'm from North Carolina because it
[1:43:58] look like North Carolina was going blue
[1:44:01] and I was embarrassed to be in Arizona
[1:44:03] so I said I'm just going to tell
[1:44:04] everybody I'm from Florida now I'm from
[1:44:06] St Augustine I'm lived there three and a
[1:44:08] half years I'm from Florida anyway I'm
[1:44:10] just kidding but Florida we lived there
[1:44:13] three and a half years and a big
[1:44:15] hurricane was coming Floyd was coming C
[1:44:17] Category 5 huge you see pictures of it
[1:44:21] if you put hurricane Floyd on top of
[1:44:24] Florida it hung out on each side like
[1:44:26] 200 miles it was that big and the eye
[1:44:31] and it was supposed to come and almost
[1:44:33] hit St
[1:44:34] Augustine and me and my wife prid about
[1:44:37] it and you know I just talked to the
[1:44:40] Lord about it and I I felt no urgency
[1:44:45] everybody was everybody was evacuating
[1:44:47] everybody was leaving and I looked at I
[1:44:49] said I don't I don't feel urgent I don't
[1:44:52] I don't I don't feel there's this uh
[1:44:55] that the Lord's pulling us to go
[1:44:57] anywhere uh I I I feel like there's a
[1:45:00] peace I feel at rest I I don't feel
[1:45:04] scared I'm not afraid I I don't feel
[1:45:07] like the Lord's urging me to go
[1:45:09] somewhere and I you listen to the radio
[1:45:11] and the interstate was so piled up
[1:45:13] anyway we couldn't have got anywhere
[1:45:15] anyway uh people were going uh uh uh it
[1:45:18] was taking them two mile two hours to go
[1:45:20] one mile and it's so backed up
[1:45:23] and I saidwell I said I told my wife I
[1:45:25] said I don't nothing I don't feel I'm at
[1:45:29] rest I I've got a pieace about this I
[1:45:31] don't think there's and it turns out
[1:45:34] that the hurricane ended up stopping and
[1:45:37] then going north instead of continuing
[1:45:40] West it stopped and it went North so it
[1:45:44] ended up a 100 miles offshore now you
[1:45:47] know it it we we had some winds and
[1:45:50] knocked down a limb in the yard and
[1:45:51] flooded the yard but that was it that
[1:45:53] was all that happened and then the water
[1:45:55] went away and all these people came back
[1:45:58] home I guess and it was just at
[1:46:02] rest now if God had said something
[1:46:05] different or get out or something like
[1:46:07] that then I would have gone right but
[1:46:09] when you're at peace and when you're at
[1:46:11] rest you don't struggle over that when
[1:46:14] something like that comes in life it's
[1:46:16] it's not a struggle it's it's not a a
[1:46:20] fight it there's a rest to it there's a
[1:46:23] peace you feel at rest because God's in
[1:46:27] control of it if you're one of his then
[1:46:28] he'll take care of you amen if if you
[1:46:31] need to get out he'll tell you
[1:46:33] Hallelujah if it's okay you stay God's
[1:46:35] going to take care you stay right there
[1:46:37] amen you you could be in the middle of a
[1:46:40] tornado and one house in the middle of
[1:46:42] 10 that were destroyed and one house
[1:46:44] will be perfect it'll be your house amen
[1:46:46] praise God yes amen God will take a
[1:46:49] tornado knock four of out here go up
[1:46:51] over yours come back down and go across
[1:46:54] y yes you that's crazy well I you know
[1:46:58] what I remember brother Jeff Smith's
[1:47:00] testimony when they come up and he had
[1:47:02] his his shop on 22nd Street and people
[1:47:06] come down the street shooting into the
[1:47:07] shop and all he said they were shooting
[1:47:10] right in there and and nothing was
[1:47:13] disturbed no glass was broke no bullet
[1:47:16] holes in the glass but places behind the
[1:47:20] building was shot up
[1:47:23] so you tell me if the bullet didn't go
[1:47:26] through the glass and through the black
[1:47:27] wall to hit the places behind them how
[1:47:30] did it get back there
[1:47:32] right oh
[1:47:35] oh
[1:47:37] amen amen you don't think God can do
[1:47:40] that hallelujah amen bullets went by the
[1:47:43] by the dozens bullets went oh oh oh down
[1:47:48] hit the places behind this building
[1:47:50] didn't even break a piece of glass right
[1:47:53] yes amen that's the God I serve that's
[1:47:56] the god that we rest in friend we trust
[1:47:59] and believe that's he takes care of us
[1:48:02] amen amen praise the Lord let's stand if
[1:48:05] we
[1:48:12] could that rest I believe is about to
[1:48:15] become permanent amen I'll just be
[1:48:18] honest I mean we've said that for years
[1:48:20] we've talked about the coming of the
[1:48:21] Lord for years but there'll be a time
[1:48:24] where we won't talk about it anymore
[1:48:25] because it'll be a reality amen amen and
[1:48:28] I'm believing that reality is here if
[1:48:31] that if that woman is that woman that he
[1:48:36] saw he said I saw her that's right then
[1:48:39] where are we I'll just ask you that if
[1:48:42] she is that one where are
[1:48:44] we I mean it cuz it won't be a year this
[1:48:47] man he probably won't be able to carry
[1:48:49] on a coherent sentence so who's going to
[1:48:51] take over right
[1:48:53] we're there it I I don't mean to be
[1:48:57] derogatory for him if he's if he's going
[1:48:59] to be the president for I'm going have
[1:49:00] the respects for him as president like I
[1:49:02] would any president like the Bible
[1:49:04] dictates in the office but if that is a
[1:49:08] fulfillment of that Vision where are we
[1:49:10] that's right where are we friend we're
[1:49:13] right here amen amen but that but that
[1:49:17] should give us more rest than anything
