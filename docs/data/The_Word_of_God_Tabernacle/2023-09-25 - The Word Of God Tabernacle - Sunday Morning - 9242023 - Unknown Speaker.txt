[Music] go ahead go ahead brother hey man in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be citizen I want to thank brother Newton for giving me this opportunity to stand here and speak a few words amen amen I'll start by introducing myself I am she has alluded brother Zephaniah papiso is my surname so I come from South Africa I met brother Roger Collins some 25 years ago in South Africa when he was busy with his Outreach 10th meetings there amen amen and we got to be glued together since then because I noticed that he had something that I had also he had a heart to get out and get out the Lost bring them back to the Lord and the Lord was using him so mightily out there amen hallelujah amen I'm so glad to be with you this morning I was taking a little video clip while my brother was singing the song there so that I can take it back home I'm so touched forgive me I like to cry a lot amen amen I'm so tired my wife actually bring greetings from her and from the old church at home amen she really encouraged me when I got here and I went I was at brother Collins church and they seemed to be hardly no one because we have bigger groups back home we don't have a pictures I'm not a person that has got the pictures party because it's a little bit bigger and she says to me after we took a photo with the group that was the church and I sent over to him she says to me that's right that's where you need to be here I thank God for it um just as a way of introduction I think I've done I came to know the message of the hour in the year 1983. the Lord brought him miraculously in each time I tried to tell the testimony I took a lot of time so I won't go into it because I value it so much so dear brothers and sisters and the Lord guided me supernaturally into accepting the message of the hour praise the Lord and our I grew up in the Assembly of God Church that's where I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ when I was 16. and I became a young preacher in our church and while I was carrying one with the work of the Lord I came across message I actually heard from a brother that was with us he was also ashamed of God but he had heard that there was a brother pranam those days you couldn't even uh easily see a spoken word book but their brother used to write to many people to many places America and around the world so he happened to receive a few old spoken word books and he told me that this man William Branham had been visited by angels and we went into a few things um he told me about the baptism because we were trulitarians he told me about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus which I had short time before that heard from the people that they call um Juanes group they call them Jesus only yeah so I added it from them and I was convinced that I didn't want to accept it so when he said he told me that and I said brother I understand so do you want to tell me now you're going to be re-baptized he said if there was someone to baptize me I would because we've been given God in pieces in three pieces one piece the Father the other piece the Son and the Holy Ghost he says but we didn't do anything about that one so we read and the first spoken word that he gave me was so I write up one and this time I read about brother Brennan or what he was saying because like I thought this man had this longing for God like I have in my own art I thought I didn't know yeah he's a prophet or anything but then um I stumbled over the seven Seed doctrine that's that doesn't sound all right but anyway after two years uh I happen to be I thought I wasn't gonna tell this testimony but I'll try not to take time on it what happened to be it was I come from the country if I talk country you think of a place that is a nice place with all the flowers the trees and everything my area where I come from is very very dry it's it's Inland in the part of South Africa that's called Eastern Cape that's where all the people that are still without all the modern things you know it's like they have mad Hearts they have all those things that's why I come from I grew up there and when I accepted the message did not send me back there so that's where I come from amen and yeah then I went to Johannesburg when I was in Johannesburg I was preaching on the farms for my sister lived in one so much fun and I was preaching there on the farms just getting people to know Jesus I happened to be in a hard time going through some trials and things so it was December 1983 I believed and I went and I went out to Cape Town traveling by trains more than close to 2 000 kilometers I don't know what would that be in miles I decided to fast for three weeks and asked a lot to give me a replying answer to all the troubles that I was going through you know as I believe I know the Lord will answer you amen yes sometimes you use somebody to talk to you and sometimes he uses even an unbeliever sure amen talk to me if I have dreams and all those things so for the three weeks I was just drinking water and not [Music] not getting anything from the Lord while in the Train on my way back to Johannesburg I had a dream I was just sleeping during the day shop to a voice asked me in the dream do you remember William Branham do you remember the way he used to pray for his sins and the sins of his people said yes when I woke up I was standing next to the window or you know on the train thinking what is not telling me yeah is that maybe I must pray like we don't Panama what is it because it's for my Ministry to be successful on the farms then when I got to the family my sister lived forgot to preach at a certain gathering with people maybe three times this congregation and the Lord gives me so much I even remember the scripture today that I write it was in The Book of John where he says I hear other ships I have or other ship I have that that I must also pray if I don't know how to cut the scripture now but I must print that the throat fold with the one and the shepherd will do anything about that one right and then well an old lady was so moved and the next day I was on my way to Johannesburg because I was gonna go to Soweto the great biggest Township in South Africa in Johannesburg evangelist from Germany by the name of rain and bonke had intended up there and I wanted to witness all the Miracles that were taking place there but before I got there I met a brother in town in Johannesburg he said to me no no let's not call them and let's go to another meeting here us from America Kenneth hagging and the others so come to this one so I was reluctant but I ended up going with him what happened to me that if that last evening I was there there was something you know us the Lord was telling me that there's somebody coming to me to tell me something from the Lord so I stood next to the entrance as the people were coming in I was expecting somebody to speak to me nobody spoke to me when everybody sat down I would come and sit down service started after the service but the same thing still there nobody came I did it for three days the last meeting you know as the people went out I was still standing there waiting to for this person that will come to me it's something from the Lord which I didn't know in fact I'm skipping something here because when I left to my sister's place as I was going to the station catch the train her brother met me which I didn't know I just met him for the first place he said to me oh yeah are you the brother that goes around preaching the gospel and I heard from your sister and I love to know I said I'm going to joburg he says he says to me have you heard of William Branham I said no it didn't mean anything to me he says man it's just that now I'm getting to work it was about eight o'clock he was gonna stadwick and he says to me I pray that when you get to Johannesburg you meet the people that believe this message I think that's what he said [Music] a message that last night in this particular meeting that we went to now I stood again nobody came they came and sat down and said he started after the service I said to the Lord I I spoke openly I said Lord I don't know who it is that must come to me I don't know what he's bringing if he doesn't come I'm also leaving now so I went out as people were greeting each other and that was during the time of appetite in South Africa and we didn't miss weeks with white people much but there you know it was a School location many were white people because it was in the white area and I just saw this one white brother and he looks at me even before greeting me he says he smiles and he says have you heard of William Brenner and I thought no I'm not gonna leave this one now I'm not gonna let this one go by I grab him with his coat and I said tell me who's this William brother he is a prophet of this generation yeah and we were taught you know in the denomination to be careful of false prophets and the other false prophet you know you you be careful of the false prophet you don't even know the true one amen he invited me to his home he was a young man then I went to his home and came and picked me up and then he started sharing ah seven seats that I stumbled over them but when he he brought it up no I said God that's right man and I said to him how did it come through the ark during the time of Noah and he says to me Prada pranam says came through one of daughters-in-law of of Noah and foreign but I'm waiting for the Lord to confirm what the weather must be baptized I just didn't tell him I was waiting for the Lord and then a few other things yeah we were at uh some conference because I was already and go to conferences with the church people and across all the weeks politics and test things the next day I was gonna go now see this Brenham Church of the years and we went to bed say early hours of the morning about one [Music] I'm not a dreamer but yeah there came a dream in the dream I'm seeing a swimming pool being a country boy this I wasn't even used to swimming pools and I see this swimming pool and to me even the fact that the walls of the swimming pool are painted blue I saw remarkable then I saw that and I saw green grass flowers and trees around the pool element so in the morning went into town called up this brother and he came with his friend that he was with when they met me there I didn't know that so drove all the way from Johannesburg to Pretoria and so I've passed the white area where white people live and pass the other group and then all the way into the colored area into a Community Hall there brother preach and I could descend the brother was in the spirit but I didn't know what he was talking about it didn't make sense I later learned that because Martin had a message that he made he is using all Prophet random status [Music] and you know like he's speaking in tongues when you don't know the message he's preaching future day and ties up all the titles of brother Branham and he says when David came and [Music] and they say oh he's so big he carries on it he says but he said oh the voice said don't look at him look away to Jesus and all that and when he came they gave him those things to where David he says he looked at me and says I look like an oddball and you know all those things he ties it together it doesn't so but after that were invited brother in town in Pretoria I'm the only black amongst these whites and while he's sitting there waiting for today sisters are busy preparing us some food he comes in from the is o from the Addison's Brothers do you want me to show you a pool where we baptize people that want to die to themselves and live for the Lord oh my dream last night I didn't tell it to nobody so I jumped to my feet and here I follow him to the backyard there is that identical wow I even have a picture of it amen the one I saw in my dream and I said Lord here's a confirmation what am I waiting for yes right the scriptures were open to me I still wanted the confirmation and the lord gave it to me yes yes and I said Lord please I said to the brother please baptize me here now and he says no brother after this afternoon service will come and baptize you hey and he delayed me to understand that I don't even remember our place in that service when I come to my memory comes back when we were standing there and he had given me he was a tall brother he still came down he's now 76 years old he baptized me there ever and when I came out of the water I thought Lord you're so wonderful yes amongst all people's needs that I thought I'm fighting so much with the African as the whites here this brother baptized me in Pretoria the capital of appetite and but God is wonderful praise the Lord but didn't I say I was born again when I was in the denomination but now there's a difference now yes the Lord had taken me up a step up so brothers and sisters that's how I came in and he baptized me and I started going to church I stayed in joburg for three years just getting to know the message and then I took it back out to the country to my people I thought when I got their brother there was going to be such a Revival everyone's gonna take it you know it was like I even met uh our late brother Lonnie Jenkins one time and I'm asking brother bunny how do I do it whenever I want to go out there and spread the message he said no foreign anyway before I went out I had had Brothers speaking about the message whoever speaks about um yeah and I will remember it now but it's talking about and time he talks about um this is where he he speaks about Souls that are in prison I had yet people speak about it I hadn't read it or listened to it but then we didn't have tapes then that we could really listen and brother Brenda when you listen to you who speaks American English is fast we hardly hear him and we used to try and get a book and to read and you know message but before I went out there back home in my dream I dreamed just the title Souls that are in prison amen and I woke up and I looked amongst my folks to see why is this one then I go when I got the book it it didn't just say source that said Souls that are in prison now then I read the book and what I gathered after reading that book is that now it was not like what I thought that I would give get everyone to believe it because it's going and I started church with my wife and my two little children one was about three plus four and the other one who played enough the other one is about three and a half or so I started of this have done now I am so glad to see you Brothers I'm glad to you when he took me up to Sabino Canyon and yeah I was so privileged that it was him that must take me out there and not anybody that's gonna twist his stories and that and you know I was my heart was very close to brother Peregrine I had met him about two times I didn't meet him in South Africa but I met him in Canada and yeah I saw attracted to him so I made him he was close to him and he tells me the things exactly the way they were so praise God Amen thank you very much brother and I was glad to see brother telling you for a tennis brother of pets the other day that had seen brother Brennan and told me if you must tell me more bro amen thank you very much brothers and sisters and then when I met brother Roger for the first time I went every time ministers came from America that I could meet I would go close to them expecting that they would have little what should I call it some blessing from The Prophet's Ministry and I was even expecting the Miracles some would come and he would go to places where when I'm all held in meetings when he was in South Africa Federal Market theater in Port Elizabeth and in in Durban grave or race course and all those places amen so now I would take this book we are pregnant medicine from God take another one a prophet with South Africa and look at the things that brought him the Lord did I expect the same and if you go there my brother I won't let you to just Bridge in Cape Town in Pretoria Johannesburg those cities I'll take you all the way out that's what I do with them dinner absolutely I look I will mention just too baby what I saw in brother Roger the Lord used him so much use him so much this one I don't know I don't know if he knows how you could do that he is praying for the sick at our church I'm standing next to the dog and as many people the line is and this girl of about 16 I think has just fell down you know I think she's possibly demon-possessed or something and now while she fell down and he calls me from where I was telling Brothers I have come here tell her that's that's Diamond that is with her it's a demon of witchcraft she is not Bewitched but they are trying to win him over yeah into into practice practicing witchcraft brother I had heard that before I went to the service because this girl is related to my family and then they had taken into some fortune teller and that was until I had said exactly what you say you know amen amen and he says to me it's a prayer to accept the spirit or totally divorce it yeah yeah they thought how can a man know that when he's there he lives in bed and breakfast out in Queenstown which is two hours away from where we are because of the bad Road and well that's only God yeah and he prayed for some sick people the deaf those it was like like this you you would pray for a deaf person just put his his hands here the next time he tests one of the Thousand Years from behind the person's ears are open amen and a lot a lot of other things I'm sorry I didn't mean to tell all these patterns like workers together praise the Lord that was that's what brought us together amen I've told this one over and over I don't know if it's my first time that the last main one we had a tent meeting in Queenstown and I was interpreting there one lady came one sister and I was gonna end up with because she can speak English so she spoke to brother Roger I didn't know what she said and I just saw brother Roger lifting up his hand and then the people stopped singing a big crowd of people he says brothers and sisters you see this sister next to me yeah has been married for over 10 years has never had a baby she comes to ask the Lord to give her a baby amen and he says this is what I do report he said in his pocket took out a bill 50 Rand or 20 Rand gave it to us as yes is that buy a gift for your child let us pray amen amen that one I will never forget well after 10 months he had left to come back to the States after 10 months he came went to visit a brother that was a Pastime but it was that was sick and I met him and he left again for the states later I thought let me just go and visit the old man not thinking that now this old man this old brother that I was visiting little did I know he was a father to that lady that sister that had asked for a baby so are we just talking in the house with the old brother the brother is going to be with a lot now he says when last did you see brother Roger I said no he was here I I spoke to him he says that brother the Lord uses him so much he says my daughter dad was asking for a baby he has got a baby boy amen he had two Bible names like Joshua Caleb or something of that sword he says to me like I was gonna say I don't believe it it's just yeah yeah he shows me a picture he says yeah he's he's a miracle from the Lord and when he showed me that Tears start running down his cheeks amen so well I am here because of brother Roger not because we were friends like friends with me but then they're not just put us together I'm glad to see you brothers and sisters when I landed here on the 20th 26th of August when I landed in detusa and it was like I was so full of joy like I wanted to sing and get on I like this place so I will share a little I don't call it a message a little thought I I had alluded to when you were just talking with the brother Newton yes we contend to our Bibles could we to the book of uh let's turn to the book of First Corinthians First Corinthians description resistance Maybe yes thank you Lord amen Hallelujah not God we pray before we open the scriptures Lord that your Holy Spirit Lord as my brother has prayed already really come Lord and take control brother when I'm taught us love that Lord amen with two hands can push back the pages of the Bible it's only Lord You're Holy Ghost your holy spirit amen that can take out what is contained in the Bible Lord and puts it into our hearts Lord yes make us understand the name of Jesus I pray that you bless us [Music] in Jesus name amen amen [Music] book of Corinthians [Music] and I will read [Music] only verse 40. amen First Corinthians chapter 14. verse 40. amen okay let all things be done decently and in order amen thank you amen amen when when I read this seemingly little scripture it means so much to me amen that thought would utter those precious words to the Believers and say let all things be done decently and in order amen now when I'm not talking about order of what time the church starts who must break use cut instruments who must I'm not talking about how long the service smile I'm just talking about the order yes or the order of God you know brother Branham in one place says people likes water so much like I saw you Brothers lifting up and singing and carrying on the one who's saying hallelujah and another one Amen brother Brendan says some people won't tolerate that they think it's so disorderly right goes on to say what about Jesus is just order yeah he says on the ground and change that thing and apply it to the men's eyes and the man says that was his order yes but now yeah Paul is talking about the order in the church he found them he was new in the face and he found them carrying on they were men there were sisters there that were long in this way and Paul comes and all of a sudden he says let all things be done decently and in order amen it's so much reminds me of brother pranam because brother Branham you you know this story when he came to meet the Pentecostal people for the first time and he says he got amongst them you know the story and he says he was sitting not very close from not very far from the door and it's not when one woman stood up and started running and always all of them stood up and started running it up if anything goes wrong there wrong yeah I know where my car is and God is going to say him having that gift [Music] all his life he says he saw these two men that were the one who prophesied speaking tongues and the other one would interpret and he says I thought after the service I'm gonna get this man I think I'm among the Angels here yeah so he says I spoke to the first one asked him ask him this and that and he says when I talk to him he rang 100 percent [Music] when I was talking to him I could see his eyes becoming classy he was feeling that something was taking place then he says oh when I left him I was saying what I'm amongst the Angels here yeah right then I thought I'm gonna get the next one he goes around and he get the next one and when he says when I talk to that one he says hi well I don't know but I don't have rice there's something that you all people have that I don't have I don't know whether he says well then there's the pool prophetam said no I've been baptized in the name of the Lord have you spoken in tongues problem no I haven't spoken it I said I will tell you right away you don't have the Holy Ghost he says I kept talking to him talking to him like that he says brother when I talk to that one if you ever met a hypocrite yeah yes that was one of them right amen okay that's when he says I didn't know now am I among the Angels or among the Devils right yes but then the Lord later you know but now I amen I want us to look at this one that now Paul he's just came in and he tells these people if you read in in your in your book in this book of First Corinthians you'll get to chapter 12 where Paul says each and every one of the Believers has got a gift to Worship the Lord with amen he says in the the 12th chapter there some speaking tongue some interpretongues some you know there's about nine spiritual gifts and prophetam says those gifts are for every one of us amen men and women yes children I'll say boys and girls says you saw all of us then they were going on carrying on in this 14th chapter if you read that they were prophesying jumping up and down just like what was happening when prophetam went to that group they were prophesying coming up and down and carrying on and here comes now Paul just above where I read you will see that now they had women preachers as well and Paul says they are not permitted to preach this same chapter he puts them into into order it puts them into order right but now brothers and sisters um I am so proud of our Prophet I want to or read from the book of Genesis chapter 1 without taking much of your time I will read a few scriptures perhaps in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis the Bible says in the beginning Elohim in the beginning God yes created the heavens and the earth I say Elohim is because Hebrew says Elohim right right means the one who existed who Before Time When she said in himself by suffix in himself by himself now um in Hebrew if anyone knows a Hebrew I know a little bit of Hebrew it reads parachute that means in the beginning Elohim amen in fact Hebrew starts by saying instead of saying in the beginning God created it says in the beginning who created God um in the beginning God created the Heaven and now brother sister that's what what not I want you what I want you to hear now we were just reading and reading and reading and prophetam comes around and he says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth periods yes amen we didn't take note of that period in South Africa we say full stop right but you say period yeah and brother Branham says period is a space of time so between between verse 1 and verse two there was a space of time right hallelujah how long the space of time was nobody knows right it could be millions and millions of years between verse 1 and verse two right yeah yeah Hallelujah when we went up to Savannah Canyon we saw those roads at the station that they were showing us they say this Rocks video for millions of years and you kind of think millions of years I know did you know she's know what they're talking about they say you know in order to win them you just tell them you are right yeah because we don't know how long we've been here I mean this creation has been to us between verse 1 and verse two it's a space of time yeah and now when the Lord creates anything he makes it so perfect you agree with me amen he doesn't create anything that is not perfect right when he created you when you came into this Earth I know the scripture says we came into this life telling lies we were Liars but we became more layers we graduated in license we grow up right to understand that we needed to repent amen Hallelujah that's why the prophet says if if a child we cannot baptize a child a minor right right a little one we cannot baptized because he doesn't know between wrong and right yeah until we get to that he gets to that age where he can distinguish between wrong and right only gently baptizing amen but now as we grew up we graduated in doing wrong things you are not taught by your parents right right some of our parents were people that were Christians serving the lord so much praying for you but we we we did this disappointed them yeah yes we went our way until such a Time the Lord called you amen hallelujah now what I want to show us here is that we were so good in the beginning we're not as bad because the Lord didn't make us to be bad people he made us to be good people but between verse 1 and verse 2 something happened four if you read verse 2 of The Book of Genesis chapter 1 and the Earth was without form and the Earth was void and there was Darkness is that beautiful no it's not God had just created the whole creation perfect and investor we find everything in China yeah without forming for that's not what God created it's not in the original it's not in the original state but then what has happened between verse 1 and verse two yeah something has happened to put all things is in such a chaotic yeah sin now if you read with me in the Book of Revelations you may 10 with me or you may read it later but I want to read in the Book of Revelations oh thank you Lord chapter 12. of Revelations chapter 12. verse 7. and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels what a crazy Dragon yes and the dragons fought against his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven amen amen the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deserves the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and these Angels were cast out with him yes you know I want to believe that that war took place with universal and then first two of Genesis you know what brother Ram teaches us that we were always on the right side we are always in Christ amen don't you believe that yes before the foundation of the world right Hallelujah yes sir when David fought Goliath you were there yes on which side were you Amen on David's side of course yes Hallelujah and my brother my sister when this war took place I was there yes and I was on the side of my girl so when Michael fought the Dragon I was fighting on his side right brother and the Lord later when he was kicked out we as Believers my brother my sister that's why we don't support all these things we don't support these new things that they bringing up today and they say a child can be even if she was a female she can turn herself to be a male yeah a male can tell himself to be a female we don't believe that stuff we can't support it amen hallelujah is not in the world we are original amen we believe the word of the Lord yes sir Hallelujah so now well they were fighting over there we were fighting with Michael fighting those evil spirits yes when those evil spirits were kicked out of heaven were there we keep them out and the lord gave you an opportunity to come down here what to do to fight them again amen amen hallelujah and when you believe the word of the Lord you fight in the evil one brother sister brother pranam says if in by attending this morning servants service it's a victory to be here to be in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah you are so Victorious that you couldn't come here and lift up your hands and praise His holy name praise because I want to say when you pray he says the enemy the devil when he sees the weakest of a Believer yes on his own or on her knees amen he says the devil Shiva scramble yes he tumbles amen hey man you okay can you see what privilege it was such privileged people were such Pleasant people and then the Lord I I had read but I will maybe I won't go for the sake of time into all the scriptures you know these scriptures in the book of Israel chapter 28 I think it's it's white it talks you maybe get that one amen just so I need the Book of Ezekiel I hope I will get that one Ezekiel chapter 28. um where's [Music] 28 has somebody there amen yes chapter 28 and verse 13 thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was high covering the studies I wouldn't even know how to pronounce some other precious stones here I'm poor I don't know what precious don't demon the studies the Toppers and the diamond and the burial and the ones I don't know how to pronounce that one and Jasper and Sapphire the emerald and all those and codes you know and the scripture goes on to say the weapon ship offside tablets and offside pipes was prepared in the in the in the days that town was creep agent yes Thou Art the anointed that cover it and I have said they saw us upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire yes I'm having a teacher here of Lucifer when he was still that shadow us he was walking upon those stones brother those precious stones we're on top of we're on the surface in Eden [Music] the gold and all the pressure Stones were on the surface but ah that law that took place took all the pressure stones to be now thousands and thousands of feet down under the ground yeah and you know what I read in the Bible in the fourth chapter of the Book of Genesis start now the sons of Cain were the first ones to discover that the pressure stones are down there they are the ones that were so good in music there is support in making the ammunition right and the old daily all the arms of War they are all those guys and now we have people you know they know where it is anyway they will go and keep that gold out they will go and dig the diamond out but before it was up yet but something happened that Great Wall we are taught I go to a place where problems we are told and it is like that that now the Earth doesn't stand up the way it should be right it's still changed on its axis amen he says what shook they act like that that war was so terrible today they are complaining that there's I don't even know they first called it a global warming but sometimes it becomes so cold when it's supposed to be warm yeah and then they don't know what to call it somebody said is it called profile calling now look what what's happening they have a new word for it what is it called now climate change yeah the climate change It's Gonna Change and change until the Earth will come back to its position right and they won't be there amen and we are promised in the scripture that we will be there yes it's not gonna be cold it's not gonna be warm it's just gonna be good amen hallelujah amen and they're not going to see it but something that happened until God had to bring somebody in fact he came himself inversely of the Book of Genesis that's where he says now let there be light yeah yes hallelujah amen and revenue says when the Lord's poke is wet he believed his own way yes it didn't matter how long it took if he says sir Hallelujah we as the Sons and Daughters of God we wait yeah it doesn't matter how long it takes if he promises you anything he will fulfill it amen hallelujah if he promises you that your loved one will be saved they will be yes Hallelujah yes you just live the life yes you trust me the salt and they'll be thirsty yes amen I have seen that how many times brother sister as you walk Jesus is seen in your own life amen you know I the day I went for my interview for the American visa to the consulate I just prayed before I left the house I said Lord let me just be a blessing to the people I will meet amen and let the people be a blessing to me but then I went out when I got there I joined the queue outside the embassy this little woman standing next to me she turns around says oh I am so blessed today to see you she doesn't know me I don't know her and I stretch forced my hand to create you and he said God bless you since even to touch this and such a blessing to me brother sister I'm not telling lies amen I don't know where that woman is from I don't know where she came from yeah I don't know what was pressing her I just believe the Lord that's what I asked from the Lord amen now yeah God invested maybe I read it so that I of chapter one of the people of Genesis I just read it if it if you just listen yes I read the investing now and God said let there be light he's fixing all the chaos that was now invest to let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light it was good yes and God divided the light from the darkness you know that's why we divide everything accordingly God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and evening in the morning when the first day it continues on and on and on and on now in the spiritual side brother Paul comes to this Believers and says to them now you know this he didn't side you can speak in tongues you can do this in is now I will tell you these things must be done decently and in order you know the sun might have thought that who are you where do you come from you just this little fellow that just come now and you come and tell us that let things be done descending order but he was sent by God to do that amen he came and said let all things be done in order why a little Tony come lately like yourself you come and tell us things must be done in order but those that were meant to believe Paul's message beneath Paul's message yes in this age God sent that there was Pentecostal churches everywhere people were killing one woman preachers this and that and that and that and brother Branham comes around he says let that be and everything we turn decently and in order amen and some of those people didn't believe him some follow them for a while while they were looking all the Miracles wanted to benefit from his ministry and after that they deserted him right do you know brother I love brothers so much I'm sorry if I'm boring you now at home I I've never had a man that speaks like all Prophet amen simple things and we will tell you things like you can't be dead and alive at the same time right have you had that one yeah where else he says you come inside and outside at the same time yeah he says you can't be a half a ship and you have a goat yeah I like those and he says the river doesn't run up and down at the same time you know you make sure that he he he Imports things in order yes and in a decent way right right he makes sure that if you come in and you accept the word you must know that you are really sweet amen otherwise if you're not sit it's going to cut you out true if your eyes gonna bring you in amen right even now it's working brother sister have you seen how many are denying brother when I'm today amen people that grew up in the message Hallelujah but no it's harvest time yes yes sir it is yes sir I'm not carrying them all out I'm praying for them yeah amen amen yes but they took some stuff there that we will think that investing in the holy spirit amen that's between them and God Amen that's right all we know when the prophet came in your own life when the word of the Lord came he put things in order yes and in a distant way yes and it will carry on doing that yes you know and I read and it gives me joy in the seven Church ages bring them when when you wrap-ups he wraps something did the church ages ages says now please let us be careful here he says this message to the angel of the church which is in Ephesus is not a message to the actual local efficient Church it is a message today and that age had in it the seed of Truth and the seed of Pera right exactly and set forth according to the parable of Wheat and the test sure the church age is the food and in it a wheat and test amen the first church organized humanized the government and the world what the true Christian what what I gather there now what was planted in the first church in the first church age is what is being harvested in this last age amen amen it's going to be wheat there's gonna be weeds yes now he says tears always flourish my dear or any other cultivated plant I don't know in my little little garden there where we don't have rain much I would plant some spinach and also some vegetables you plant it and you see that's sweet you hold the weight you take you you approach the weight and you did within a while you must do it again yeah is still growing yes but you must do it about three times right until you you have assume they flourish like that but you know the witch that doesn't seem to flourish that much and the problem says the chair Church grew rapidly in the first age but in which the witch church was flourishing also right by the side of that one by the end of the first age the Deeds of the Nickelodeons were flourishing in the local false Vine churches amen which increased attempting to to spread their influence further than their own body they were you know now in our time we see all these things going on bugs all we know is that our God has sent this prophet to say let all things be done descended and in order [Music] you can go out there amongst all the people you know what is planted in your heart you believe the word of the Lord wholeheartedly amen you go out there amongst them you leave this message you do everything according to the way the prophet told you amen amen I had I was interpreting translating the message now I have my voice next to Prophet Venom's voice and even you know little things the people he says we create you this morning and he's the only one in the Pulpit but he says we yeah and when we translate maybe some in determine some into my language course or something to Spanish it fits so much we agreed you until those captains are so perfectly made that people will ask you have you seen them and you talk so much like you you you are on his side and brother if I may share this legal one when we were translating I would just take a manuscript read it write it in my language there right and while writing that something tells me that's wrong that's wrong right some reason it's as strong and I scratch it like that yeah if I could have helped my my mind is you're pushing I write it like that and something says it's wrong I scratch it back like that and I carry on and put the right one yeah there was a time when we first started the brother that was like leading us he thought I was too slow and I wasn't doing it and I was well they sent the manuscript to voice of God to to be checked and then by the way when brother Peter Paul met me he says to me what's your language what are you doing I said I'm doing awesome all those kind of all of those kind of clicks that we have he says brother they this language one of the languages that my father liked so much when we when those days it kind of you know mostly and I met brother Joseph because if Brenham says to me brother remember daddy said when you translate this message you must not live in high order and I thought he says do you know what my order is I said no no I don't know what that is he says I'll give you an example it's like the word pneumonia that is a Greek name pneumonia he says when you pronounce it it's like it begins with an n but when you write it it begins with a p but you kind of for me to repeat and send you one yeah translate that one Studio and problem is bridging you're preaching to the invisible audience somehow you go back to his time yeah and you visualize that until if he cries you cry you'll be so in the spirit and my brother while your other brother thought I wasn't doing it they the the translations came over and us number one yeah but anyway what I'm saying God comes around he let those Pentecostals do their thing there was a zusa Street there was Pentecostal churches all over there were Ministries all over they were doing so well and program comes around so he says let all things be done decently and in order amen and brother sister if you stay in love online my brother my sister God will bless you amen you remember that time program saw the preview of the Bride yes he says he saw me right I mean me yes in that Vision amen he saw you Prophet yep in that same vision amen he says I saw them the Japanese you saw them Japanese Pride was there African bride was that right yes American was dead yeah yeah all the members of bride were there and he says now Wiley they were marching so orderly he saw two or three that stepped out of order and I want to believe that he even forgot it he was in the vision when he saw those two or three I guess maybe it was me brother that was getting out of order and problem calls and yes Hallelujah right right because God brought him that things can be done decently and be done in order right amen I I don't forget this one I keep repeating that some sisters there was a quote that I asked my brother here to to wherever my name says we would like to be somebody else he says maybe I would like to be period and many of us ministers would like to be sorry and so so you could have us powerful Ministry and he says but you cannot take any amen right neither that person can take your place that's right he says some a call to be preachers evangelists and everybody and what but I like it when it comes to where he says summer calls to be just Housewives right and he said someone just called to be farmers and he even mentions mechanics yes he's a mechanics and these some this and you just be amen the light where you are yes yes it is this little one I'm telling that this three or four sisters were coming out of a store in cape and then this worker at the sources excuse me well you I want to ask you something do you know Jesus and they say oh well we thought she's going to push to us now and we said no yes we do know Jesus the message believe us and she couldn't talk anymore so they asked her back they said why why you just asked as if you know Jesus and you don't say anything he says why I ask you look like you amen I don't know what would that mean but it was such such a moving testimony amen that somebody can look at you and say you look like Jesus amen you look like him brother sister because the prophet came in our day so that things could be done decently and in order amen we have two groups I don't want to go into that but we have two groups now in the message we have people that are so legalistic [Music] that will strangle you with the quotes of brother pranam and the the defenses of of the the Bible right that will make it as private and puts it a bunch of do's and don'ts right the message you know those guys will judge you before minor things yeah and they will take you out and say you won't make the ram charges that's right yeah I don't know yeah in South Africa there's preachers but on the other side there's another group in the message that is so Carefree amen so Carefree so Reckless yes that will really do anything anyhow anyway that will sometimes act as an unbeliever yeah yeah that will talk bad things through their own mouths true they also follow the message I don't want to talk about those that are denying the message and they make all the efforts to do not talk about that one but there is also that don't you think that now we must be in line amen we go don't go overboard to that side we're going to there are those you know I can take right now I'm I can take brother where I put brother Branham on that side brother they say brother I wouldn't have a name on this side and I brought the Lord Jesus on this side and take those things and see hey the looks uh they look so alike amen Jesus Christ was prophesied by the prophet that she was going to be here Amen brother Branham the same thing yes it's written about him in the Bible yeah he even tells of one time when he got amongst those Believers the the church people that he got to and he what did you say did you say your name was he says Brennan and he says the old man oh what's your name first name William and this is the old man took out a piece of paper in the openness that he says we were praying for a Revival yes and Lord spoke in the church said I'll send you image a Prophet by this name yes don't worry people will think that you you you are you are crazy yeah when you believe the message of the Prophet but you are not amen now brother pranam Jesus was born in a stable program was born in a shack Jesus sufficient sorted brother when he grew up Jesus was hated of those that were supposed to be on his side yeah so as brother pranam sure the little kids I think who is the Sunday school teacher I think that they are taught yeah you know all these things and now you know brother pranam says now he was walking from school with the other fellows and then there's this beautiful young girl he happened to carry the books for her and they thought you what are you because he was considered not even a white man yeah yeah he has gone so was Jesus because they said to Jesus you are a Samaritan yeah yeah you're not even a Jew Nam says they they thought that Mary went down and met as a Samaritan Soldier yeah and when she came back she had this big tummy and they wanted to cover up that admit make it a holy thing all right meant to understand Jesus was not even a Jew so they thought about problem oh you are go to it and you are when those boys went and then that hit him like that and say and then he says he ran to his his dad's house and he caught a shotgun yeah while they were saying we're guarding we got him they were talking like that yeah he comes with a gun he says which one of you wants to die first right so that he can he can see the others when they die so he tried to shoot but you know in his ministry our all these things but let me say this Ministry it was the first preacher brother Branham that I ever had in all his sermons he uses Bible verses and I look and I see in the Bible that the Lord Jesus Christ had different sermons hear The Sermon on the Mount he said a communion he had different ones Beatitudes he had all those different sermon so did Jesus what did Prana pranam you know what in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ there was a time you read in the in the gospels that now they couldn't get the segment to wedges as he was for him to pray for discipline and it's written that they opened up the roof Ministry in one place they couldn't get brother Venom into the stadium the place was so full they had to take them and drop him inside here using ropes don't you say it's the same thing can you see that amen amen but it's just refreshed it's just the other way around it so now when Robin says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he means it sure and it's happening and many of the messages that he preaches it was what was taking place in his own life take a man running from the presence of the Lord is here amen take this daily scripture what was happening that was Christ again standing there there in in brother Branham creating that book yes like he did back then amen but rather sister if you look at all those things you comes to when one time you know the stories brother pranam says oh that's the time that we went to pray for that nail girl nail girls yeah you read in your Bible there's a time that Jesus went to pray for that girl from name name it's the same thing but now brother if you look when the ministry was growing and then Prada Branham laughs bear with me his ministry the ministry that Christ did in this day was exactly the one that Jesus In the Flesh did was exactly what Paul did in his time yes you know Paul will tell you that now there was these brothers that were helping him in the supported brother when I'm in Italy yeah not so amen do you know that's not just coincidentally that that is something and then now when the time came and brother when I'm lost his wife he lost his baby time now he was so pain thinking about this one time he says he went and he was doing his work at the Public Works he went he climbed up that boat and he says when I climbed out the pole and they were singing all a little far away stood an Old Rugged Cross he says I happen to look and I saw my Shadows there and the arms were like this he says I said Lord that was my sins that put you out there amen and you know what brother sister in our day brother William says they are crucifying him again yes yes right amen yes yes I didn't even realize that it would come to a Time when people would be crucifying him from the message prophets as well amen true and when he says I looked at God lord that was my sins that put you up there and I look at that one and I say Lord that was my sins that made you to be crucified for the second time that I may see this message right right it stood for it and it goes on and on until I get where I see now who knows Jesus Christ said those different sermons different people who was what was Jesus last sermon that he preached from the Bible any Bible scholars I might know which one was Jesus's last one thank you thank you sister exactly the last message that Jesus preached was communion with his disciples and now come around brother Branham what is this last one that he had thank you amen so communion with his disciples just to show us that this message is nothing else is Jesus Christ today the only one that was yesterday amen and you will do it forever yes this message praise the Lord and now my brother that is why I say whatever chaos there is if we allow him to come and say not to that side extreme not to that side extreme but we stay in the middle of her amen yes he says let all

amen some of Micah might think you are you guys are so misled by your parents you know when your father is a pastor or some of these grandchildren they think they're doing because their grandfather is a pastor taking is a family thing yeah but we know it's not a family thing amen we know you have to have your own relationship with Christ yes yes we know that Hallelujah he has to show himself

anything but we know we have got his Spirit yes I'm such a believer in the Supernatural amen beautiful praise the Lord yesterday I mean a shadow from Phoenix I'm sitting next to an old man here he said he was 70 something about 76 or so he started talking to me asking me where I'm from and then I talked to him and uh he says she played golf and all those things that he kept on why are we talking you know he wants to know my language he's interested and then I told him yeah he even learned to say and then this man I want to ask him his name and I say with him with Robert but I just I just didn't say it out so I asked him what's your name is Robert I thought why didn't I say it why didn't I say it but I told him anyway I thought of saying you're a robot he says but how do you know it he said I don't know something doesn't I call you Robert and he says you know what he says he told me he's not a Christian he's or everything he drinks wine he carries one with all things that's what he told me but when I told him that he says oh by the way you said you were a preacher such things happen to you guys we don't believe ourselves but the other people believe yeah they know what we are he said such things happen to you guys yeah that you know things before they you are told yeah and I thought when what if I could have called his name no I know I know this happened to me one time in South Africa I'm sorry but I'm sorry brother I'm sorry I see you you know when you were singing here brother in that song where you say if if we don't meet again yeah we're making the Rapture amen I believe that yeah I believe that brother when brother Branham was saying to brother Eddie biscuit when they were out there in the mountain he says brother Eddie brother Ed when you get over there it's just similar to this you see when you get over there you will see one of these little roads if you see one of these you run down that road you'll find me down there yes amen brother I'll our our meeting this one day I gave a lift to this young lady I was with my son I gave a lift to her will you go all the way we get to a place now okay I answered on the way I said what's your name she says her name is so and so I said no your name is Zuki he said no no it's not so it's okay when we went to drop by at the bus station I I took a number instead of writing the other name that she gave me again and when we got to Cape Town two weeks later we went to visit her home and she says to her and oh this is the man that I met that day I don't know okay I didn't know what it was all about when I'm about to leave the place she says by the way do you know people from my area where I come from I don't know anybody Jesus doing our soft shocked when you asked my name I gave you a wrong name Marian name is somebody just told me that that is something told me that your name was not that it was that one so brothers and sisters I'm glad to see you well yeah I think we all can say

that I have this church out in the rural area where I come from many young people grew up in our church but when they come to Varsity level they have to go to Cape Town to the cities to get education and many of them get places where they can have a better life and we like the little church all the time but with raised up so many that leave us now I have that little church at home and I have one that has just started when I was taking the video hey I'm going to keep using or for twice halfway to Cape Town and in Cape Town I have another group in a place called Robertson four hours and two hours from Cape Town and in Cape Town in Canada there used to be brother Cambridge the old man he went to be with the Lord now I have that church also because many of the people that came from marches are in touch yes the biggest percentage in the church so I have those three groups to kind of of us here amen so may God bless you I thought I just said amen this morning [Music] I was saying when the Lord left the Lord Jesus Christ said I won't leave you comfortness I will send the Holy Ghost Hallelujah when the prophet left the sin [Music] comfortless he left us with the Holy Ghost he left us with a voice because he said if anything comes up if you doubt anything [Music] to see if I said it or I didn't say it [Music] if there is anything my brother don't want God to come around and say in your own life that all things be done decently important don't you want to say Lord I want to make the rapture taught us if there be three or less that will be taken from this group saved by his grace Lord I am the first one in that group in those that are going to make by God's grace the Lord can come in my life can come in your own life we are out there brother still hunting for that little one for that last one that must come in before we go home and I recall problem says it might be one little black sheep out somewhere in Africa that will be the last one we are out there and we appreciate
