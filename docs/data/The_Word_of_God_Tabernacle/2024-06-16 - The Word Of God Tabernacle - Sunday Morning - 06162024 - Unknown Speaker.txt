to our Lord Jesus amen amen Happy Father's Day Lord God Amen Micah has a testimony he wants to give today of his trip and the sites that he saw when he was out that pertains to scripture and things so um I see here you got some pictures you want me to go over those with you want to tighten this or okay I'm going to sit here so I can see the pictures God bless you um didn't really know what to say or do um other than uh grateful for a good trip gone for about 14 days um flew from Tucson to Atlanta Atlanta to Athens um flight was great no issues no bumps no nothing um made up some time it supposed to be 10 and a half hours made in 10 hours um slept on the plane everything was good there to get app up in Athens and everything is great so beautiful um it's a type of beauty that we don't have as far as I know on North and South America there's just a beauty in in the Mediterranean that we don't have here so much tropical um tropical vegetation it's just it's all natural everywhere what we have here like oh I'm growing oranges or I'm growing figs or I'm growing pomegranates they're they're everywhere there are um the the hillsides are full of olive trees the hillsides are full of huge Fung Grant trees bigger than I've ever seen big trees bigger than I've ever seen as big as this room um it's just amazing the beauty over there and it helps me to relate to what we hear in the Bible about the mberry trees and the pomegranates and the olives and how how that kind of coincides with what we read in the Bible um it was so great to be able to see that so I do have a couple pictures that out of the 4100 that I took to share with you um that do pertain a little bit to um the scripture and the things that we hear in the New Testament specifically um so the first the second stop we took was in Turkey um so we drove three hours to Ephesus um that we know the Ephesians church is where they were in Ephesus um but we our first stop in in Ephesus area was uh said to be the last house that Mary the mother of lived in before she passed so um this is a couple pictures of that the that I think that's a mulberry wow yeah there's another picture mberry um but Mulberry is also the trees that the silk worms eat and live in um and it's also where they build their cocoons and that they're harvested from the moary trees to make kind of Sil cloths and Sil RS couple extra side of the house um very rustic very old construction um just basically cement made out of dirt with dirt smooshed into what we know is Brick the obviously there's glass windows but back in the day they were not glass just area and then we drove back down the mountain to Ephesus this is the of epis what's left of it anyways so the people would come through either the east or west gate this is the East Gate this is where we started our tour and we work our way down to the west gate um and then a lot most of the ruins in Athens and the greater European area um what we see is ruins were actually messed up from previous restoration efforts before we had the technology to move these tons of of rock so will'll see lots of just pieces laying around everywhere um I took hundreds of pictures of just these kinds of pieces all over a huge Shaw puzzle um there are continued restoration efforts but they are so slow and meticulous about it it takes years and years and years um this is the stadium um where Paul stood and preached in Ephesians church so I I took a couple of the rocks from that and give it to my parents so it's just so neat to be in a place that an apostle stood and preach the word you could I mean I don't know how many Christians were there with me on our tour or just in the general group but it's just I didn't have a whole lot of time to kind of sit there and meditate but you I just touched the because scientifically I don't know if you know rocks absorb the energy and the sounds um in a way that humans don't know how to extract it um billions and billions of terabytes of data can be contained in crystals and rocks so I know that the words that Paul spoke are in those rocks and those pillars so um this is a politician speaking platform um politicians had three minutes to give their speech about what they wanted to do what they wanted to change um and then they only served for six months so policies they made they were done that way so they would have to live under them um but this is where they would stand and give their speech um this is the marketplace of Ephesus where most of the trading would happen um it's it's an amazing structure it's you can the how small they are compared to the heights you got a six foot person and then the rest of that even just these little statues are like 10t tall and it's just it's just amazing um we learned at one of the silk rug carpet manufacturing places where it's also made by hand that they actually use silk to cut the granite and the marble to make these kind of structures um and then here's a very very tree um that's in Ephesus when you walk into the great tourist area it's just there on the left and then um and bront is where all the ruins are so it was just absolutely huge there were a few big trees that size also um it was just incredible W and we take it for granted here but prickly bees are are there and they're actually invasive but I thought it was really neat to have a little bit of home on the trip um this is a overshot uh over the city of Athens this is also where Paul stood and preached in Athens um this building here in the middle that you see is um the Agora or ancient Agora it was just filled with a bunch of Market places and that was the General congregating area of everyone where all the markets were and Paul would stand up here on this rock base and reach out to um so it's you can't really tell but that it's huge it's probably 100 ft wide um it's been so traveled now that the rocks are like glass almost but yeah it was really neat and this is just a a zoomed in view of that ancient aora this that small building in the bottom right is a monastery they do have monasteries sprinkled throughout the cities and they all kind of look the same and this is what the acop looks like um you can see the Acropolis from anywhere in the city because it sits in the middle of the city high like that um so you got the the great Acropolis which is this is a closeup shot you can tell how large it is also by this tiny person standing in front of it there is a crane in the middle as they slowly reconstruct um any of this white piece are pieces that they can't find to put put back together so they used um New Marble from the area of grease to reconstruct any of the dark pieces are original um so they are still slowly very slowly rebuilding that and that area is also littered with just a jigsaw puzzle things that they use to put together and reconstruct the parts of Happ um this is a beach in Corfu an island of Greece the most beautiful beach I have ever seen and I just came back from the Caribbean so this makes the Caribbean look like a for AG it's the intense light blue that that water is is just absolutely incredible um so I had to include that and then those are just people and then this is the brokn um and just also beautiful water beautiful city Old City PS um it just the beauty is it would be hard without showing you more and more pictures to convey what that's like and what it looks like so those are all the pictures I I decided to show just I didn't want to take up too much time um but just thank the lord for keeping you safe um out there while around there there were cats everywhere um the the city takes care of them um but no there are cats everywhere but there are no pigeons um so we don't have to worry there wasn't all the pigeons and stuff trying to get your food sitting at a table CU all the restaurants they have sit in areas but they all have communal um like cover spots where you go to eat um because they don't really want you in the the restaurant so small but cats would just wander around through um the food was unlike what we have in the US it's unprocessed they don't import so anything we ate was grown in gree um the potatoes for the french fries don't taste like the french fries here they potatoes actually have flavor to them and they're a slight yellow color the tomatoes the Cucumbers the the yogurt was amazing um the honey they eat they eat their yogurt we call it Greek yogurt yogurt there they just put honey on it and eat it um yeah and then we went on the cruise the cruise in days we stopped at several Greek Islands a couple different um countries like turkey um and we got back um out after the crew stayed one day so that way we could recover and hop back on the flight and it was 11 and a half hours on the way back because of the Winds but everything was was great and just thankful that everything um went completely smooth no issues no health issues no sicknesses no ceases um no delays the Lord is to us amen thank you for your pra amen yes the Lord makes me want to go see those places guess I don't know never even been to Israel myself so maybe some in here have but I haven't even done now so but love to go places one time U they had planned a trip and U brother green uh with brother green or he wasn't going or he decided he was going to go and he asked me I said no I said I'm I'm going to stay here and help the Lord told me to come here to help you and you're going there you need me here to help um so he said he he appreciated that very much he said maybe one day just me and you will go and obviously honestly that never happened of course truth I think if I remember right the trip that he was planning anyway didn't happen uh he never did go back to your so um but I would like to go someday the Lord willing if it comes out that way kind of tough under the circumstances but you never know the Lord has a way of making things happen so we'll just see what he has in store so I'm so glad that U Lord blessed Micah and brought him back and obviously touched him on the trip so just seeing those things very powerful and then kind of makes things come alive you never before you read the scripture know the scripture well enough to understand what the pictures are about uh and then just kind of put yourself in there when you read that part of the scripture now you can keep in your mind the picture he took and what you saw on the picture and what you're reading put the two together and kind of makes a picture amen so I appreciate him doing that so God bless you God bless you let's stand if we could I'm going to go ahead and'll just change the service now uh I did fail to mention um bring out a prayer request uh me tabith and the kids are going on a trip this week out of town uh so certainly appreciate your prayers for that Zach had to work so unfortunately he couldn't go Micah just got back from his trip so he couldn't go so it's just going to be me tabith and the kids going out this week so appreciate your prayers about that so let's turn over in our Bibles now to Second Corinthians again uh far as I know Lord willing from what I've done thus far this will be the last um installment if you will of this series The Gateway about the mind um so uh first cor uh 2 Corinthians chapter 10 we'll start there as we have and I'll we'll read the first I will start with the first verse again since this is the last last one to read through for the entirety of uh 2 Corinthians 101-6 but before we read can we just bow our heads for another word prayer Lord Jesus we're so very thankful father of all that you do for us Lord all that you give us yes Lord in this life Lord you don't you don't want us to just hate life you want us to enjoy life you want us to uh be be thankful for the life that you've give us father and use this life to honor you L Lord so many times we we think as Christians we're everything's supposed to be dull and not supposed to do anything or go anywhere or be boring or but Lord there's so many things in life that youve give us so many things Lord that we can do that we do God that just means so much because you love us so much and we're thankful Lord for it we're thankful God for the blessings you give us every day Lord Lord we're thankful father that you give us health and strength and life and God the blessings that you give in our lives God thank you Lord for being our father and Happy Father's Day to you Lord you've blessed us some of us here to be fathers in this place thank you so much Lord for each one God we just take a day to honor God those fathers those dads Lord who are truly dads to their children who are there raising their children the nurturing admonition of God trying to teach trying to bring up a new generation in the nurture and admonition of God lord may you take complete control of the remaining part of this service Lord and have your way in it thank you God for the spirit we felt thank you Lord for all that you've uh shown us thus far we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we commit it to you now Lord and ask your blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10 let's begin reading with verse one now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who impr present and base among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds that's the strongholds of Satan right casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled you could be seated if you'd like amen so as I said this Lord willing will be the uh the last part of this series on the Gateway or the Mind amen as we uh delve into this Lord not looking to to be too long but just how the Lord leads so amen um so we get to the mind I want to read this quote that I wanted to start out with after that amen that brother randam in 1964 Christ identified and the same in all generations and what he said in a couple places but this specifically uh uh read Christ identified the same in all generations April 1964 now look at the position everybody will admit she's in a Sodom condition I passed over California here the other day and got a hold of a magazine or a paper where it read homosexuals had increased 60% in LA in just the last year see oh my pitiful see it's just because women has throw themselves away that's right and just on the streets naked it's just a shame but the Bible says that it would be that way every man if they're just he said they're changed he said and it's going to get worse going to get worse and hasn't it my mind since 1964 and it's going to get worse in another if the world would stand listen to what he said now if the world would stand another 50 years the whole world would be totally insane look at the sanity Insanity 40 from 40 from 20 years ago till this time look at it that was 60 years ago yes 60 years ago he said 50 years be totally insane and you look and you see well people aren't filling up the insane asylums but look at the way they're living look at the way they're acting look at the way they're eating look at the way they're dressing the way they're dressing would make you realize there's something mentally unstable with that person to look at the people on the streets and how they dress or or don't dress their lack of dress makes you realize that must be something totally insane there must be something wrong mentally with that person the way they talk the things that are acceptable today you think it would be inside 40 30 25 30 years ago there were things thought that are common today that we thought back then a person would be insane to think that was okay to think that was normal to think that was right but that's the way it's gotten to be today yeah that it's that it's thought to be is something that's normal that's okay it's something that's that is a a a kind of run-of-the-mill if you will and it's something that you look at and as we know and we're reading the scripture is something that you can't help but know that somebody's there's there's some Insanity going on somewhere yes there there's there's people that have just lost their minds they don't they don't have their mental faculties to know what's right or wrong anymore uh it's all gone so if you think you say well 50 years will be totally insane this began longer back than 50 years from that time that this started and how crazy and how bad it's gotten today that's the way it's become amen where people people have completely in in in a lot of cases they've just lost their minds yes what was right what what what was right then is wrong now what what was wrong then is right right now and it's totally completely upside down and based on what we know as common decency and morality just just common morality is just not the same anymore uh laws on the books that don't even get observed anymore things you you wonder why things are illegal or they have laws on the books against certain things and and and it's just as common as anything else you think well why do they why why do they even bother it it just is just baffling to me I know in the state of Arizona they were fussing and complaining around the country and how Antiquated Arizona was because the Arizona state representatives decide to try to bring back or start to enforce an abortion law that's been on the books for over a hundred years for the state or however many years it was a long time start to bring that back it's always been there it's just people ignore it it doesn't exist in it it it's as though it didn't exist anymore and now they bring it back up and people criticize and say oh how dare Arizona do this it they're just it was just something that they brought up to say this is the law in the books and that's what we should enforce if you want to change it then we'll change then it you know you got to change it amen but it was like back then it was illegal for any kind of murder as such right now it's not doesn't matter it's not important to a lot of people anymore in fact um that's that's the thing that a lot of people that that uh they they must have in life uh they think they can live without air drink or water as long as they can ab abort their babies they're okay you know don't I don't need any water I just need to be able to murder my child I don't need any food you know that's just how bad it's gotten and and they think and they think that that's crazy lost their minds totally insane right amen let's go over to uh Matthew St Matthew chapter 22 Matthew chapter 22 begin with verse 35 maybe 34 let's start with verse 34 Matthew 22:34 now look at this but when the Pharisees had heard that he Jesus had put the Sadducees to silence he tied their words up so much they didn't have an they didn't have an A a rebuttal for what Jesus was saying they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master tempting see wasn't serious he's tempting Master which is the great commandment in the law always trying to catch him with something amen same thing it's the same devil today does the same thing same tactic just trying to just trying to stir things to to to find something to accuse you with amen Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets now look he said you must love the Lord thy God with all th heart soul mind but look at what Jesus is covering here look at what look at what his answer is first of all his answer that he's given is which uh I may Lord willing when I feel compelled to I keep thinking about trying to bring the series on bitterness again um offenses but I just haven't felt that to do it so I just haven't done it but in that this love we know there's the the three loves there's the love there's God's love which is a love it just exists and there's a human love which has uh a love of affection in it and a love of action so there there's a love filo love that's that is a that is a noun and a verb so it has two forms to the one love that's human love God's love agapo agapo agapo actually is that love Is Just it it just exist it it just is because God is as long as God is it is it's unconditional uh it's unchanging uh man's Love Changes man's love flip flops from one to the other and uh it's can be here today and gone tomorrow that's man's love but this love that he speaking of you look it up it says they shall Thou shalt love that's God's love that is the goppa love thou shalt love unconditionally the Lord thy God now look at what he's specifically bringing now it's got mind in here which is part of the which is the subject of what we've been dealing with Thou shalt love the Lord go thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind all all all but now why is he differentiating them amen amen why is he differentiating the the heart soul mind the love love love of course ailia love a love is a love is a choice amen uh is a choice uh God's love not a choice it just exists um my love for him existed long before I even knew right it just was there amen because he was there praise the Lord but look how he splits this up he said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart now what's the heart the heart is the Cent of the physical life amen the heart is the center of the physical life you say the heart and the Soul's the same thing but the heart that we talk about the beating heart inside our bodies is the center of our physical life he said all th heart and with all thy soul and what's the soul the soul is the center of the spiritual life amen so the heart's the center of the physical life the soul is the center of the of the spiritual life and with all thy mind is the gateway to them amen so as that love comes it comes in a way that it filters through the Mind obviously but then it enters into an effects and takes over the physical the center of your physical being and the center of your spiritual being so every bit of you every part of you every molec of you spiritually and physically is to love the Lord thy God period amen amen every part of you not just giving a hand or a toe or as brother Brown preached a little room in the heart well you can go in here but you can't go over here no all of it all the heart all the physical all the spiritual and everything that enters in through the Gateway every bit of it is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul and mind amen our entire life is to be absorbed with Jesus Christ our entire life every part of us every every part of our being every thought amen every action every deed every everything about us spiritually physically mentally emotionally in every way amen that's why Jesus is saying Thou shalt love the Lord thy God in every single facet capacity city of your being yes not just your physical being not just your spiritual being but your physical and your spiritual being amen amen through your mind the Gateway that is the gateway to the truth now look this is the first and great commandment praise the Lord to love the Lord thy God everything you've got everything absorbed in your in your entire being to love the Lord thy God Amen that's the first and great commandment but look what he says and the second is like unto it amen amen he didn't say it was exactly the same amen but look it is like unto it so you can't separate the two amen amen you can't separate the two they are two as he says like unto it they are twoo but they are inseparable amen that's why it's like unto it praise the Lord he says the second is like Thou shalt love that love is the same love agapa love unconditional love thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself now who's your neighbor person lives under you person lives next to you person lives above you next door neighbor God down the street who is your neighbor everybody Humanity amen humanity is your neighbor amen and I could actually enter into that all of creation amen you realize all of creation came from God God spoke and every bit of what came out of him is what we see every day all of this creation amen it's beautiful God created till man got a hold of it right now now it's just and people love I guess somehow love all the buildings and stuff that's fine uh personally I I just soon have a 100 acres in the middle of the woods with a cabin right in the middle of it and a nice stream going right through the middle I'd be fine with me amen I sent a song to my family this week asking if they ever heard it my wife stopped and listen to it I can't remember I could look it up but I don't want to take the time to do that but it's a song about the guy's talking about heaven he says I don't need I don't need streets of gold just a nice dirt path to get me home I don't need crystal seed is just a nice stream flowing in front of my cabin or something that's all I need and that's I just identify so much with that song because that's all I need that's all I care about big skyscrapers and all this stuff that that is what it is whatever that's that's fine man the marbles the uh the buildings and stuff that's all great the things Mah showed us and stuff that's wonderful that people build glad to have a roof over our heads here in air conditioning amen but just give me what God made amen amen that that's satisfies me all the time amen these two now these two Commandments hang all the laws and the prophets to love the Lord thy God all your being to love your neighbor everyone all of creation all Humanity love as yourself Amen in the exact same way that you love the Lord God now how many times do you see that manifested right how many times do you see it manifested that we love Humanity in the same context the same way that we love God Amen am that's what he said we can be critical of it all we want we can say well that's not possible or we can make excuse or whatever we want to say but that's what Jesus said amen so we either want to obey it we want to live it or we don't it's our choice but that's what he said amen all thy heart and soul the Gateway way that gets to them the Mind Amen to love all the same way that you love God yes amen praise the Lord let's go over to uh Proverbs chapter 23 praise the Lord the mind that place of decision yes amen the place of decision that people people can't understand things if if someone can't understand something you going over to Proverbs 23 if people can't understand something they they don't normally receive it amen you ever you ever thought of that if someone can't understand it with their brain they don't normally receive it right they don't normally accept it that's why we have to believe and accept the Lord Jesus by faith amen we accept and believe him by faith yes because we don't necessarily have the evidence of him standing there or or or whatever the evidence someone may be looking for if they can't believe it with their minds they they just a lot of times they don't accept it and there's so many things in the scripture that defy common logic there's so many things in the scripture that defy nor normalities in life and they don't make sense to the human mind you look at it and say how could that happen how can iron float it can't right without God right God can make iron float yes man can't chemically scientifically everybody says believe science well if I just believe science there's no way I'm going to believe that iron can float there's no way but did it do it yes yes amen go man lost a head in the in the river Prophet come along and made iron float that doesn't make sense right you can look at it with your own eyes and say I just I don't believe what I'm seeing have you ever said that I have yes not as dramatic as iron floating but I have said I can't believe what I'm seeing actually almost every day when I go down the street and I see people out I can't believe what I'm looking at I took a picture of a guy in the Denver Airport one time cuz I absolutely just could not believe what I was looking looking at I took a picture of it amen I actually and and and another time in in the Denver Airport I saw a woman going down the Concourse with a goat and I thought that there is no way that could be a support animal it didn't have the vest or any of that on I thought how in the world was that woman allowed to come into the airport with a goat and it wasn't a little nanny goat I'm talking about this goat was it was a big full SI goat with horns how could they allow that it it went by so fast I didn't get to take a picture of that one I got a picture of the guy I'm like how I can't believe what I'm seeing I looked at I like how I can't believe what I'm seeing there's a goat in the airport how does that happen I've heard of people bringing ostriches how does that happen they call them support animals I don't I don't understand I look say how could that happen I could look you could look if you were there at that time and see an axe head float on the water and say how could that happen I can't believe what I'm saying amen you see with your own eyes and not believe it it's hard to something just as simple as as as a Christian biblical principle of tithing there's no way that 90% of your money will go further than 100% of your money it's just not possible Right but it does it does right amen given in faith as unto the Lord it will go further as a than 100% right that's his word it happens and how many people in here and I heard you said amen because it's the truth it does doesn't make sense it defies common logic there's no way that can happen but it does it does exactly the same way that iron can float yes but it doesn't make sense to the human mind so the mind and so many ways it will cast it out because it just can't understand it it just can't believe it that's why you believe it by faith yes it's all faith everything about this walk with the Lord is Faith amen and you believe it you trust him now you don't do it you don't experiment with God you hear me right you don't experiment with God you don't say well let me see if I can try to get this iron to Flo no it won't work right amen won't work oh let me I'll just I'll give this experiment I I'll give a little bit and we'll just see what God does no no no God doesn't experiment friend right amen you either are or you aren't you're committed or you're not you do it as unto the Lord you don't it's not a this is not a scientific experiment it's not something you reason with your brain it's not something that you try to accumulate to to try to understand scientifically or prove you believe it by faith and God proves it every time amen and it doesn't matter what other people say I don't care about their opinions I know because I've seen it I believe it and it's a truth I've proved it I do it according to the scripture as unto the Lord God proves himself every time amen every time yes he does doesn't make sense none of it makes sense amen but God showed it to be true amen there are scientific experiments too that God has allowed people has allowed men the intelligence to be able to do could you imagine a hundred years ago or so uh a 777 flying over somebody's did you imagine a 777 flying over Ephesus when Paul's standing there preaching oh there's another load of tourists what is that thing amen but God has allowed the unbelievable to happen hundreds of tons of metal can St set suspended in the air or set floating in water right I'm definitely not smart enough to understand it it doesn't make sense to me I know there's a there's a there's a a a scientifical principle to it but how hundreds of tons of iron can float they do it that way or be suspended in air amen it doesn't make sense now they prove that scientifically you can't prove God Amen or I say prove scientifically you can prove him in fact when we were talking about tius Malachi 3 he said prove me right and see if I won't do what I said I would do praise the Lord so he does say actually that's the only place in the scripture that God actually said prove me you know that yes only place in the Bible where he said prove me right amen it's the truth but mind the mind just can't comprehended but that's why we believe it by faith amen now let's go to Proverbs 23 I told you I wouldn't be too long here now Proverbs 23 one verse verse 7 for as he thinketh in his heart thinketh in his heart how do you think in your heart amen you ever pardon the pun thought of that how a man thinketh in his heart right for as he thinketh in his heart as a person think it in his heart so is he how do you think with your heart amen a lot the exact same way that we were just talking about when Jesus said with all thy heart soul mind amen mind is the gateway to the heart yes amen that that you as we read the scripture thinketh that we receive except amen now if you cast down reasonings if you cast down imaginations and those things and bring them captive to the word or or or like we had the computer example where you put it in your software and you you you you put it in a a quarantine and you erase it that that's gone but but if something that you accept something that you receive something that you ponder that you that you accept and receive as truth as as reality that becomes a part of a person in their heart as he thinketh in his heart it it because the only way to get to the heart is through the mind yes amen so that's the way you get to a person's heart is through their is through their mind say through the the mind yeah see taste feel smell here imagination effect reason memory faith we believe trusting in God comes to the heart as a man thinks so is he as a man thinketh in his heart so is he he is that person because that's what he feeds upon that's what he looks at that's what he trusts in there's so many things too and absorbing even especially for the children even to absorb and to and and to take in they become that thing amen uh let me let me read this to you this is the the last quote but look it's 196 April again 1965 though God's provided place of worship look at this look at this teenage insane now he's talking about teenage Insanity yeah look at this teenage insane I told you the other day they was uh t uh uh taking an analysis there at the school in Arizona where I live and 80% of the children in school is mentally 80 now you can't say that word anymore that's not politically correct U but you know me I am probably about as far from politically correct as a human being can be I am not even remotely close to caring about being politically correct just say it as it is yes amen and the truth is and he's talking about here 80% of children in 1965 year I was born 1965 80% in the schools are mentally that's that's a hard number when you look at it think but look at where it's gone come to see remember remember the warning that brother green even gave and talked about uh with Ali oop remember about alyo anybody seen the cartoon character alyo right brother and brother brandom told Brother green said that's exactly what Satan looked like when I saw him was like that alyu cartoon character you think well that's simple there's that's harmless there's nothing to that but look what will there now look if 80% of the children are mentally what will their children be yes again you got a mama that's a flapper you got a mother a child that's a strip teas and a daughter that's a grand a granddaughter that's a porn star and a great granddaughter where does it go from there amen what is the next one going to be like right yeah I saw one time I I forget where but you know being out a lot i i u i I was out and I saw the mother and she had tattoos all over piercings the dad which I'm assuming is the dad the male and the female he had tattoos all over him piercings everywhere see the little boy probably Emma's age probably not even Joel's age more like Emma and Alice he was rocking around and had these little tattoos on his arm now I'm sure they were probably uh U fake um yeah the the stickers uh whatever they put like a sticker that they put I'm sure it was something like that but he had two or three of them on his arms I thought no wonder what is this poor kid example I prayed for the little boy right there in my heart said God help that little boy he has no chance if if the circumstances and condition remain like that that little boy has no chance at life he'll end up just he'll end up worse than Mom and Daddy his two influence I felt so sorry for him Amen in that condition that's what it becomes amen what has it got to see then say what will the next Generation we can't have he says now we we can't have another generation and I was 6 months from being born eight months eight months from being born we can't have another generation we're at the end Jesus said these things would come look at all these televisions things getting these fictitious things in order it'll come a time I predict that people will be completely totally insane the world will be the Bible speaks of such hideous sights as they show in movies today of some prehistoric creatures eggs that lived in the Earth for so many thousands and millions of years hatch and come forth to some just a minor thing see he said to what's going to happen when hell is loosed and open and the Devil comes out of these mysterious things when Locust locust look like women long hair teeth like lions why that that world will be completely totally insane right it's he and then he said it's not but just about one degree from it now what would he say 60 years later yeah if it was just one degree from it there friends where are we now if we see it the secretiveness of it of of Satan the the cunningness the the crafty the beguiling and the beguiling is one of the greatest hindrances because it's something you don't realize when you're being beguiled you don't realize you're being tricked right that's one of the attributes of beguilement is you don't recognize or realize you're actually being tricked yes into believing something into seeing something amen that's what begot and that's exactly what the devil does he makes it seem so normal so okay amen and see the problem is it seems like so many times we as Christians you know standards are up here and of course you know a Godly person should always have their standard higher than the world but our standard should never leave where it's supposed to be and that's in the word our standards the word not based on what they do out there but what the word says amen standard of the world may be going lower and lower but that doesn't mean the standard of the Christian follows along with it well I'm not like them well no the the standard of the Christians to stay here the scripture is here the world keeps doing this but we don't follow the world well as long as we're A step above the world we're okay no no no we stay here yes that's why you become more and more an oddball every day yes because the world is getting worse and worse every day yes what is it it's the deception of the Mind amen where does the devil work the most in the mind Amen to deceive to to try to trick to try to bring around something well this this at one time oh and then when something becomes mainstream that used to be thought of as immoral when something immoral becomes mainstream then the people that still believe in the morality become the the the oddball you become the crazy person and if you look at it we are certainly in the minority amen always in the minority because that's the that's the trick of the devil yes to normalize it in people's minds it's not normal there's nothing normal about it amen not according to the scripture Our Life our life is to stay up here our morality is to stay up here not to follow and just stay a step up above the world if if if the world's dropping and dropping and dropping we don't drop with it we maintain our morality we maintain our scriptural standards we don't lower them amen we stay right there with them but that's the trick of the devil the Mind devil said well that's okay you know it'll be all right just keep going along that's exactly what he told eeve he does the exact same thing oh it'll be okay because God does know then then that day see you'll be as Gods knowing good and evil the trick let's go over to Isaiah chapter 26 we'll read this scripture here another one close shortly Isaiah 263 amen Isaiah 263 look at this look how beautiful this is amen everybody got a Bible got a way to read this I want everybody to read this this amen even Joel and Emma I want y'all to read this s if you got a Bible for them to read let them look at this amen I want everybody to read this if you can if you've got it there you got to look it up on your phone look it up Isaiah chapter 26 just one verse of scripture I'm give it a minute because I want everybody to get it I want to read it together 263 Isaiah 263 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee amen amen amen let's read it can we read it together amen let's go thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee amen amen now do you believe it yes praise the Lord quote it every day believe it every day amen something Comes The Devil Comes quote it to him tell him thou will keep him me God you will keep me in perfect peace because my my mind is stayed on thee amen I trust in you my faith is in you he will keep me in perfect peace I've had so many times even at work the gods come along and say how can you be so calm and stuff's going crazy or something's messed up or something goes wrong how can you stay so calm I said it's peace amen that's all it is I I I I don't know how to explain it uh I I know I know how to get it because it's scriptural but I can't give it to you I can just tell you how I got it it doesn't upset me amen even we had the M the manager he just retired we had his retirement part party Friday even his boss the guy that hired me the the the upper guy um he even was talking about because I thanked him for hire me putting me on this team he said uh he saw me as a as a an even kill guy and I thought I that was I took that as a compliment yes amen because we all get a little exasperated sometimes we all get beside ourselves sometimes uh and act in ways maybe we shouldn't but by the by the grace of God we try to stay as even as even keill as just keep our minds on the Lord yes we keep our minds on God and he will keep us in perfect peace now when your mind is cluttered with every everything else then this doesn't work amen you got to keep your eyes and your mind on the Lord remember complete absorption of Jesus Christ in our being complete absorption in our body all that we are should be absorbed by Jesus Christ everything that we get everything that we are should be compl I'm not saying that we're monks and I'm not saying that but everything about everything should be about him right number one first and foremost I keep my mind on him he will keep you in perfect peace when it gets cluttered with all this other stuff going on and all the things in the world and everything that's happening around the world when all that stuff gets cluttered in your mind and then then yeah that your mind starts reasoning it starts thinking of things and what does the Bible say the first scripture we read cast down imaginations and reasonings yeah those don't become a part of who we are the word becomes a part of who we are that's what we follow that's what we live by because that's who we are amen amen then God keeps us in perfect peace yes amen because our mind is stayed on him amen stayed on him and that's where it should be praise the Lord amen one more scripture and I'm going to close second Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 11 11 and I will leave you with this and with this scripture with this lesson for all of us to follow 2 Corinthians chapter 13 2 Corinthians chap 13:1 my last scripture listen closely now finally Brethren farewell be perfect that means like God Amen mature like God be of good
