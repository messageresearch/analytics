prophetic spoken father even in the darkness we see the light so father we know there's a victory in all this and there's something to be learned but father sometimes we just ask that you move mightily with your mighty hands come down swiftly father because we know it's your time and just give us the patience and the understanding to know what you're doing and to hold fast to you father because your word never comes back void we thank you for that father for the needs that were unspoken father assets you meet them as well father for there's so many things going on right now with this

thank you for drawing us here today lord helping us giving us the ability to be here father and lord the desire to be here god there's a desire in many people's hearts to go to different places but lord our hearts lord is to come to the house of the lord once again expecting you to speak to us from your word lord i pray that this word will go forth and find its betting ground in the hearts of your people that lord today we could draw closer to you lord be more like you father from those things that are said and for what you do for us father and lord for your presence being here god lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done today through the remaining part of this service anoint these lips lord and speak through them what could have to be said and lord anoint the ears that are out there today god that you would anoint to them what you would have them to hear knowing that word will not return void but accomplished in each one of us whether we can feel it whether we can see it whether we know it or not god we believe by faith that it will have its part in us god because you delivered that word to our hearts through the anointing of the holy spirit and the and the glory of god coming and and bringing it betting it into us lord and revealing it to us once again lord we just pray that you break open this bread of life speak to us lord from your word help those requests those needs situations circumstances those who weren't able to make it

and honor for this in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask and pray amen amen praise the lord god bless you first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet uh with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you can be seated if you'd like amen i have to say now before i start on this i must really enjoy the good old-fashioned monsoon last night i don't know i know the winds mess things up and the lightning might shock a little bit and the thunder might scare the animals or whatever but i really enjoy a good old-fashioned come up just like it used to it seems like forever since we've had that good monsoon come through and sweep across the city and give us a good dousing of rain and uh opened the door and my wife said you smell the desert if i'm not from here i don't i got up to the door yeah smelled it smell it smells so good smell the creosote and all the water hitting and you know and then she said the uh coyote urine i said no not so much but the desert is just has a unique smell about it it's just uh i've had people tell me uh maybe even david fritz i think may have told me oh they hate that i love that smell i like when that rain hits the desert everything is fresh and it watches all the dust and everything away and it just it just produces that uh that aroma just like any place else i've ever been yeah amen but i really enjoyed that flying thank god for that rain hopefully we won't be the end of it through this monsoon season so amen this um we get back to this invisible union now last week we talked about the invisible union and kind of ended up at the part of understanding where we began with and that was the fact that we that we want to make sure and and before we leave this subject that we understand that this rapturing bride is a word bride that she is a word bride that came from god and going back to god amen we just weren't born arbitrarily friend we weren't just put on this earth for absolutely no reason we didn't just come about because uh a man and a woman knew how to procreate the act of procreation we came about because we were predestined to come about we came about because we were from in god from the beginning and we are come down in this earth to produce the life of jesus christ afresh again in our flesh and we're going right back to god if you come from god what is god what the bible says first john 1 1 that he is the word well if god is the word and we came from him what makes that what what makes that uh us to be we are that word if we came from him we're just a part of him if we came from him we're just as much a part of that word as he is because he is the word so if we come from him it's just god coming back to get what is his amen he's just claiming what is his he's just coming and redeeming what is his what he saw what he foreknew before the foundation of the world in his mind as an attribute of god was just a part of of him as who we are and he's just coming to redeem that part of him who we are revamped said he come to redeem those that were what redeemable right well the redeemable are those who are a part of god to begin with just like god gave us in the nice natural as we saw the beautiful rain and see the dew in the morning just as god sends the rain down on the earth and he calls it back up by the beautiful sunlight amen god rains upon the earth and he calls it back up by his beautiful sunlight god put us here on earth and one day the s-o-n is going to draw us right back up to him again amen it's just god testifying at the resurrection god testifying of his grand plan from the beginning that we were from him and we're going back to him one day as that little dew drop begins to shimmer and begins to shake and begins to get ready to to be pulled back up into the heavens by that s-u-n so the bride is doing the same thing because she's recognizing who she is and when she knows who she is and each individual you as an individual recognizing who you are in christ when you recognize who you are the bride comes together as a body recognizing who she is there comes a a sound from heaven like the mighty rushing wind from that was like in the upper room on the day of pentecost that begins to shake and shudder and you begin to realize there's some beyond this moral reach that the s-o-n is calling us back he calling us back to where we came from amen there's that little quiet time in the morning sometimes you just got to get quiet amen that little quiet time in the morning that it is when that dew drop goes back to the heavens it's going to be that way some morning saints god's calling this bride is going to call us back home because we came from him we're going back to him amen there's a couple of things i want to pick up from last week that we read in the rapture message he says now hey you get to this body we read this scripture last week first corinthians 12 by one spirit we are all baptized into this one body by one holy spirit baptism a baptism is an immersion that immersion comes in and god puts his life in you that makes us one in him that's the unifying factor amen is that holy spirit that's that this bride is an international bride correct it's an international bride this this uh truth is an international truth christ went around the world not physically but his word around the world so that word is joined together by the holy spirit the the the anointing that comes upon that is the one uh solidifying factor that this bride has around the world the holy spirit you must be born again jesus said correct you must be born again well if you must be born again you must be born again by the holy spirit that god sent back upon the believer well that unifying factor that holy ghost is the one thing that brings us in as a part of that body we've become a part of that body and what is that body that body is the word we become a part of that body by by a holy baptism of of the holy ghost and fire of god that comes and burns all the old nature out and puts his own life in there that makes you a part of his that's god claiming his property people get baptized and some denominations even claim that they're saved when they're baptized when you're not saved when you're baptized that's a part of it that's an ordinance that god the scripture leaves us that we know we're supposed to do as an outward sign that we've accepted jesus as our savior and we want to be buried in a cold dark grave and arisen and new and afresh again but it's when god comes in with the fiery holy ghost that comes and burns out your old nature and then shows to the rest of the world he's accepted you right amen now you've got a new birth amen now that's the new birth that's when all the old things are passed away and everything has become new that's a new birth by one spirit we're baptized that puts us as the word if that is uh uh he said put it down first corinthians 12 is that life is the spirit is the life of jesus christ the life of christ and the life of christ any seed he said which was the word seed brings the seed of life you get it he says now if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the holy spirit if the holy ghost comes upon it it is going to bring that seed to life right it is going to bring that word seed to life and if you go back to first john 3 9 not gonna read it but if you want to write it down or go back and read it again as we have expounded on here before but first john 9 uh first john 3 and 9 you'll see that that seed of god that he placed in a believer placed in a predestinated which we get from predestinated seed if you got that predestinated seed it remains in you amen john 3 9 that seed remaineth in you what is that seed that's a seed it came from god what is god god's word if that seed come from god and it comes alive in you what's it going to produce god an apple seed is not going to produce oranges a squash seed's not going to produce grapefruits a grapefruit seed's going to produce grapefruits a lemon seed is going to produce lemons a tomato seed's going to produce tomatoes a seed of god is going to produce god amen that's right i know sometimes it's hard for us to recognize and realize that but that's part of coming to who we know who we are because that seed was placed in you when that seed was in there that god put in there before the foundation of the world when god placed that seed in there he come to recognize that seed and the holy spirit can brood over an entire congregation until it finds a seed no matter whether it's in a baptist methodist catholic wherever it is that holy spirit will root over until it finds that seed and it'll go in and it'll quick in that secret amen when that seed comes to life it'll produce the life that's in the seed amen that life is god amen just kind of replicating what we finished with last week that seed is god it's a seed of god the seed comes to life and produces god where is it producing god in new in me in his body of believers amen that's why we're to live act walk talk act uh speak and everything about should be according to the word of god should be according to the to the good pleasure of his will not ours because we've been we've been born again we're different we don't paul said the things i used to love i now hate right the things i used to hate i now love yeah why because he was changed he was a new creature the holy spirit had come into him and changed him and now he begins to live not the life of under caephas but he or gomez he began to live the life under under god in the leadership of the holy spirit he began to do the things of god because the seed of god came alive in his heart you do the things of god because the seed of god has come alive in your heart sometimes the problem is that we get deceived by that man that's in the mirror we need to quit looking sometimes so hard the man in the mirror and recognize what the word says that you are exactly look in the mirror of the word not in the natural mirror i look in that mirror right there and i find all kinds of faults not just in me but in you too you find them in yourself nobody knows your faults better than you do and nobody knows you better than god does and he's forgiving you then why do you hold it against yourself that's right if god's forgive you don't hold it against yourself don't look in that near look in the mirror of god's word and what does god's word say you are a couple weeks ago we talked about abraham you go back and look at the account of abraham's life in genesis you see that abraham absolutely seemed to deny faith denied the promise uh got another woman pregnant and all the things that he did but if you go over and look how god saw abraham god's account of abraham and romans in hebrews was he was a faithful servant who never wavered that's right could you imagine if if if abraham looked at that and said well that's not right that's not how i did that's not how i lived if abraham looked in the mirror what do you think he would see oh i shouldn't have done this i shouldn't have said that i shouldn't have doubted here i shouldn't have right life is full of shitness amen but we need to get rid of the shitness and go to the i am amen because he is the great i am and forget about all those things because i'm sure if abraham would look at the account in romans and say oh wait that's not what i did i absolutely wavered and see in abraham's mind and in his experience he recognized and realized yes he did waiver but does that matter no because his account was before god amen my account his friends i'm sorry but my account is not before you my account is not even before myself my account is on the rolls of heaven before god almighty that's where my account is and as god sees it is what the truth of it is people say well that's the truth you know i used to tell you the story that when i'd go to work and have a little sniffle or something and people come in my office and say oh you get nicole i said no and sneezing or coughing and have a little congestion oh you you get the cold nope not right i have people come christian people professed christian people oh not you you know you're just lying and they have a grin on their face you know you're just lying you know that you're sick i said no i'm not i said they said that's that's just a lie i said no you want to know what the lie is the lie is the lying vanities of this mess that satan's trying to put on me that's the lie right the truth is that by his stripes i am healed that's the truth amen the truth isn't the sniffles the truth is the word right amen amen how does god see it that's what matters yeah amen what matters is how god sees it that's god's account god's account to you is that you are a word seed bride predestinated in his mind from before the foundation of the world friend and this world's history is about to wind down and this bride is getting ready to go home yes amen amen it's for a word bride that seed that remaineth in him when a germ comes into the womb of a female we talked about this last week again i'm going to finish this up and then we'll start where we left off you didn't come into as a a human germ from your father and then the next thing a dog a cat and a chicken you become a human germ from a human germ just like again like we said last week a baby is born a baby is conceived is conceived as a germ that seed brings life when it brings life it doesn't bring the the seed of a male human doesn't bring forth the life of a chicken it doesn't bring forth the life of a human and then on the next cell it's a chicken or the next cell it's a dog no when it brings forth life when that seed comes forth it comes forth as a as a human being the next seed or the next cell that builds on that is another human cell not a dog cell not a chicken cell but a human cell and the next cell that builds on that cell is another human cell not not a dog cell not an alligator cell it's a human cell and as each cell begins to build on itself you see the human begin to form in the form of the womb of the woman nowadays with the technology they can take pictures of the baby you can see its mouth its nose its eyes umbilical cord feet everything it's incredible what they could do today beautiful pictures i've loved it my children they were just kind of ultrasound was the thing that then is just it's just amazing to see them there you know and say there's life but it's a cell in the cell that's what forms the human well the same thing is in the spiritual friend the natural always types the spiritual and the and in the spiritual we know it's the same thing when you're birthed forth of this seed first john 9 3 9 your birth forth of this seed it doesn't burn forth as a word seed and then all of a sudden you've got a a catholic seed attached to it or or or a baptist cell that adds to it next or or some kind of other uh cell on top of that no it's word cell on word cell on word cell word on top of word on top of word on top of word and that's how you are born again that's how you continue to grow that's how you continue to live is that cell of the word is building on itself in your life and you're becoming the spiritual person by the word of god through the holy spirit life bringing on that seed the seed doesn't just come forth and all of a sudden there it is no there's a cell that builds on it what is that that's word there's another that brings forth the word body what is the body of jesus christ the mystical body of jesus christ it's a word body so if it's a word body it's not just a seed that comes forth and there it is no there's got to be another cell that comes on top of that well what's that cell well if it's a word body what's he going to what's the cell going to be it's got to be the word amen not denomination not hybridism not some man's opinion not some somebody learned from a seminary no it's got to be a word cell and that word is going to witness to the word itself the life of the word is going to witness to the written word itself amen remember what we talked about the other day with the written word that's here amen that's just a small part of jesus that's just in a written form there's a life there's a life friend and that seed that comes that cell that comes on that seed is producing the life that comes and the word witness to the word because it's a word body this is this word was just derived from him this word did not create jesus this word derives from him amen you understand this word did not create god this word exists because god already existed and this word derived from him right and what does it do it builds one on the other word on word sell on self amen and the bride the bride will have to be the same way this word bride will have to be the same way she will have to be that seed this form again first john 3 9 will have to be cell on cell have to be word and word on word on the word it's got to be a word so now wait a minute i think this cell i'll interject my opinion in there oh boy now you're going to be you know you're going to be hybrid and you're going to have you're going to have 18 toes on one foot now you're going to have 12 fingers on one hand you're going to have a growth coming out of the side of your head you better get rid of that opinion and just take the word amen the pure word will get rid of the impurities that's right the pure word will get rid of all the deformities all the hybridism the pure word will get rid of the 18 toes will be just the exactly where it's supposed to be amen because everything works because it's got to be word of word or word not your opinion amen not the opinion of some man or some denomination but god's word it's got to be built word or word or word when it does then there's a body that comes forth that body that god has created here through his word on this earth god has come and brought an invisible union to happen that's right amen again like i said last week just the just the simple title of that message exactly tells you what it means invisible union there's an invisible union that takes place well what is this it's a union that you can't tangibly see me and my wife got married we got married down here campbell and uh and fort lowell and when we came together there was a tangible marriage there's a man there was a woman there was a minister there was a word there was a ceremony there was an introduction of industrial douche and mr ms bennett now we walked out and we were husband and wife he was my bride amen we went and had a reception praise the lord we had a reception see that was tangible well it's an invisible union an invisible union is something that takes place that you don't see it's not tangible but you know it's there you say well it's it's you know what's there how do you know it's cereal how do you know faith is there right how do you know you love somebody can you prove it i mean just because you give a hug or kiss doesn't mean you love somebody amen can you go buy me some love so you understand see it's an invisible thing that is taking place an invisible union that is happening today and that invisible union is uniting that word bride body back to the word itself again that union that that the two have become one amen the two have become one look at matthew chapter 19. matthew chapter 19 uh verse three we'll just read a couple of verses here in matthew 19. remember the subject again today it's invisible union verse 3 matthew 9 3 or 19 3 excuse me yes matthew chapter 19 verse 3 the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female we talked about that adam the feminist masculine took from adam eve took out of adam's the feminist spirit out of adam not just the physical part we always talk about the rib of adam and taking the rib and making a woman but we forget a lot of times that that the feminist spirit out of adam and put in the woman see so it's the spirit and the flesh just like he did the bride amen just like he did the bride made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let no man put asunder now that's a big statement there because the again the natural typing the spiritual what god has put together let no man put us under now it's not talking about uh anything outside of god let's just put it that way it's saying what god has joined together let no man put asunder and when god joined this union together this invisible union it is it is a union and a and a fellowship of union between a a male and a female that cannot be broken satan tries all the time to defeat this this bride today away from the word and away from the truth and away from this union but what god has joined together no man can put asunder no man can tear it apart no man can separate in the eyes of god it is still together it is still a union amen the twain have become one to two have become one now you see when he talks about christ and the bride as being one we read that that quote last week they should be they ought to be they will be they are one amen they have to be one christ and the bride be one together remember we talked about that changing of relationship last week there's got to be through the annals of time and through the through the uh uh church ages there there was relationship of of christ to his bride down through that down to those ages and there's pride to each one of those ages and there's those in each one of those ages that live to their message and will be there in the first resurrection i believe we'll maybe begin to see them pretty soon we'll see how the time frame on that goes we don't none of us know but it sure feels like it won't be too much longer but we'll see that they'll they'll resurrect first but they live to their message and if they limp to their message they will be there as pride well that relationship down through there has come up to this point in time now that we're we're at this place we're at this juncture of time where the relationship has changed uh luke 17 30 all the mystery the the the mystery being unveiled through the ministry of the son of man the son of man ministry that come to to unveil christ to to make it known to his people so that there are no more secrets there is no more uh uh misunderstanding or or or things that are unknown god begins to have relationship with her with his bride but before god can have that kind of relationship there's got to be a union amen to be legal lawful and right in the eyes of god before that union can take place before that act can take place there's got to be a union there's got to be an invisible union take place before god will have that type of relationship now remember god had that relationship one time with his uh with the old uh jewish bride and they committed spiritual fornication against him and he put them away he put the jewish bride away to get a gentile bride and that's why god allowed them to be blinded so that the gentiles could come in now the gentiles in now god's getting a gentile bride from the day of pentecost to this day god's getting together himself a gentile bride a bride that will be without spot wrinkle or blemish he has already by his own blood completely annihilated every sin that can ever be held accountable to his children annihilated never even in the minds of god justified as if though you've never done it in the first place that very record is taken and thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered one place he says on the head of satan it'll lay on the head of satan until the day of judgment and everything that you did in the flesh he'll be accountable for right amen because he did it it's his fault from the very beginning he even talked about eve and how she was tricked into doing what she did right it brought all the uh things that it did upon this her today but she was tricked into doing it amen that's god's justification you did you listen to that invisible union i thought you don't have to raise your hand i don't want it to be any judgment going on in here but in your own mind your thought you listen to that invisible unit i will tell you when brother dennis texted me said he wasn't able to come today he didn't say he'd listen to it but anyway that message invisible union when he goes into that invisible union and pardon me i i i'm trying to finish this today so uh i'm trying not to go too slow but be as fast but be as clear as possible but that in that invisible union he talks about um the fact that we were born seen shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies our first union was with the devil right that was our first union because our very nature taught us ephesians 2 to be children of wrath we were taught we weren't taught we were just born with that nature nobody teaches a baby to lie they're just born that way right amen life cheat steal live in the world corrals whatever all gamble all the world things of the pleasures that they have in the world today you're born that way right you're born with that nature you're born to do those things we were the wife of satan we were in a union with the devil but it wasn't a right kind of union and his whole point in there is you have got to die to that man you've got to die to that old nature you've got to die to that first union before you could ever be resurrected again born again with the fresh union with jesus christ the word amen if you try to marry yourself up with christ the word while you're still living out in this world you are an adulteress and the bible says there's not an adultery enters into the kingdom of heaven amen if you try to union the two together you'll be an adulterer and there's no adulterer goes into heaven that old man's got to die he's got to be divorced he's got to be out of the memories even of the uh of your life of ever having that union that you had before to marry jesus christ the word amen how many people they try to they try to claim to be christians and they keep going over in the world and dabbling in the world living in the world and wearing all these nasty clothes and looking all these horrible ways and going all these ungodly places living all these horrible ungodly ways friend and trying to claim there to be christians saying that they're living for jesus christ they are the bride that's going in a rapture they're an adulterer and god will not have that right amen now thank god there was a time we all there amen it was a time we were all there but god came when he shot his light upon our path and that holy spirit brewed over found that seed and that light caught that seed and that seed came to life you said you know you might have been in a bar you might have been in a stranger's bed you might have been in a gambling hall you might have had a fifth of liquor in your hand but when that light struck you said oh praise god i'm more than this right amen i am more important than this i'm a greater person than this yes god has made me more than this drug god has made me more than this alcohol god has made me more than this righteous living i'm a dishonored daughter of god and i've been called to be a a a son or daughter of god to live the life that god has called me to live right i'm greater than this i'm more than this and that light struck something changed oh friend if there you know if there ain't a whole cell ungodliness going on in this world today i don't know what is right even the very instrument of satan calling out anti-word you ever wonder why there's so much of this piercing and tattooing and stuff going on it's because our bodies were made to be the temple of the holy ghost our bodies are to be the temple of the holy ghost god doesn't want you to scar it and and and and deform it right now thank god there's some here that's that's done that but see when that light struck you amen it chased you amen that nasty thing might still be on your arm or something but you're a different person inside and god knows right but you see i hear the world though i mean pierced around their faces and everywhere and uh tattoos necks and arms and hands and everything it's just unbelievable i i one time in you know we live in a fair fairly liberal liberal city but in the back country in north carolina where our church used to be we lived in in uh outside of charlotte we went to a church in a little town called stanley and and i got a friend it was one day and i don't mean to be judgmental on this person i just want you to understand that's the spirit's in the world today right it wants to take the body that god gave you which is supposed to be the temple of the holy ghost and destroy that temple but this person he was a man walking down the street as we were coming out from church and he had pardon me i don't know how to say this but he was pierced on both sides he had piercings in both sides and a chain between the two connecting the two together right i thought my that just ain't something that just crawled out of the pits of hell i don't know what it is that's just a physical manifestation of the spiritual that's going on right i mean because you understand the spiritual is much greater that's just a fear of spiri a physical manifestation what do you think this out here is the same thing right desecrate what the bible says is the temple of god that's exactly what's going on that's what but his wife's not going to be that way right amen amen she's going to take the word because the word is her portion the word is her life and when you come to realize because we've all been there friend we've all made mistakes we all lived our lives and maybe some of the youngbourne's not so much but we've lived our lives up and we've been there but when that light struck that path you said oh there's something i'm called to be a greater person than this i'm called to more than what my life is living right now right and you recognized him you came back and when you become that there's a union that takes place a relationship change well there's a relationship changed with you individually so racism relationship change with the bride internationally that bride comes and he slips that unmerited wedding band upon your finger amen invisible union christ in the bride the word marrying the word amen the word groom wearing the word the word brine but remember that next change it goes from acquaintance to girlfriend boyfriend to fiance to to bride and groom but the next element of that relationship change is when they become husband and wife right amen husband and wife is when that wedding band is slipped off and i know brother said then and the bible says when you're promised to you're as good as married to a friend but let me let me show you in fact you know what since we're already talking about that let me just let me just read this to you amen power of transformation i believe this was in prescott now we find out that after he made this transforming into this kind of life it was all put in by the word of god the creator we find out that this all headed up the headquarters called the garden of eden it's garden to be god's creation god's transformation wound up in the garden of eden remember the power of transformation what was that transformation it was a word transformation the word transformed this world that was in dark chaos you know the bible says it was without form and void right it was dark chaos was this world when god when god created it but then when he began to brood over and it developed into this beautiful garden of eden and god put his son there and god put his uh his son's his son and his son's bride over all of it this great creation see he had a reason for it he every everything so pretty had the flowers life birds no death no sin no sorrow no sickness and then all this great thing headed up into one big headquarters which is which was the guard of eden and there he put his son adam and adam's bride wife now you might say listen this real close now we're talking about that relationship change god now you might say it was his wife potentially it was his wife but he had never really been with her as wife yet as wife yet if he had not really been with her as wife yet it's still his bride right like in the scripture we find out where is it joseph thou son of david if you're not taken to the the very thy wife for that which is conceived in her as the of the holy ghost see now it was his wife when he made the promise to marry her or to have her but yet it wasn't his wife yet because he had never known her as wife that was the big struggle up in the garden of eden because the serpent got to her and lived with her as wife before adam could amen amen he lived with her as white before adam could but when adam did he became white she became white after that point is when he actually named her up to that point he will look in the bible up to that point he called her a woman right after that relationship changed she called her e mother of all living not adam father of all living but eve mother of all living right because serpent knew her as wife before adam did see he was she was his wife certainly but he never knew her because he never knew her as wife yet and so that's why it was the reason i said god's son and his bride adam had never knew his wife as wife but yet it was his wife potentially just like the bride is to christ now amen in that in that position for that relationship there must be union first i do union fellowship to have that kind of a relationship to have a husband and wife relationship they must be union married together that's when you begin to know each other begin to whisper sweet nothings and enjoy your relationship together husband and wife that's the after i do as the wedding band unmerited grace slipped upon your finger by god it says i do you say i do he says i do you become one what did he say in matthew 19 and no more twain they're one right you do you no more twain you're one that's true and that's exactly that bride which we talk about is who he's coming to get to take home remember friend we're going to a wedding supper not a rare not a marriage ceremony that's right how could god have that kind of relationship unless he had already slipped that band upon your finger that's right god wouldn't do that god is a clean holy righteous god he wouldn't have that kind of relationship with a woman unless that unless that band was slipped on her finger amen wouldn't happen yeah because he's god you wouldn't want to have that kind of relationship either unless god had done that when god said i do and you say i do and the two become one the bride becomes the wife the wife of jesus christ you say now wait a minute we always use the word bribe well it's interchangeable i still consider my beautiful 36 years married wife back there who just turned to so many years old uh my bride she's still my bride amen but she's she's more than my bride she's my wife right she's my bride too amen but she's my wife amen and there's nobody else that'll ever be my wife as far as i'm concerned amen that'll ever be my wife she's my wife and there's nobody else can feel that relationship understand so that relationship's unlike any other relationship that's why it's so coveted and precious to god now you look at the other thing that satan's tearing down in this world today in this country the family the fabric of the family satan is trying to destroy oh it doesn't really matter that you're married that's why more than half of marriages fail today that's why most more than half 60 percent whatever i don't know what the number is now fail marriage is fail yeah this country you look at what it's doing he's ripping that apart to the point people said well we just they call it what common law mayor common-law marriage oh really you think that's what god looks at and believes it's just it's just then another fabric of god see it completely denies and and delegitimizes everything about the word when god is trying so to get his bride together under that word to unite for that uniting time and sign because the bride and the groom have become one she's become the word because he is the word he has taken her unto his bosom and the two have become one amen abraham and isaac had a ceremony but friend they weren't unionized in a fan and and a couple husband and wife until he took her in the tent right amen the two became one that's when god begins to speak to you reveal to you himself reveal the word to you tell them friend if this bible is just a bunch of words it's just knowledge it's just some intellectual knowledge that you gain or understand but when god comes and that union takes place then then there's then there's a revelation there's a there's a secretive relationship that takes place between you and him and it's only for the bride it's only for his wife it's not for everybody else it's only for his wife you take on his name you become miss jesus that's another thing the devil's so hard to try to tear down yeah you remember when it talked about years ago when hillary clinton becomes so famous when she becomes so famous and her husband became present on this mess she was hillary clinton until her fame rose to a certain place and then she started calling herself hillary rodham clinton by her old name and she kept her husband's name but look what spirit that generated how many places how many people how many women today refuse to take the name of even men who want to take the name of the wife i i just it just shows there there's something to that friend but but the the wife absolutely refusing to take the to take the the bridegroom's name which you're just simply refusing that you even belong to him that you're even part as a union together amen but you see that very thing that satan is destroying because it's so prevalent in the word and so it is what the word teaches us that union between christ and the bride amen between christ and the bride now you know if if i had a if i had a name like ricky or rickett or something i might change it that might be a little different you understand but you know what i'm saying the whole premise of that amen is to take on his name we've taken on his name to be miss jesus see shows that union together the bride becomes the wife she's the bride is the wife now look at this god's provided place of worship the church will go through justification luke through sanctification wesley through the baptist the holy ghost pentecostals go right into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the self-same person husband and wife would be the self-safe person now we've typed it naturally we know that's fact naturally we read it in the scripture here what about spiritual sure night natural type spiritual husband and wife will be the same god will be so manifested into his bride till they will both be the same amen amen they are one he god will be so manifested in his bride that the two will become one amen the two are one he said now if those two have become one they are one now he says do you see where we're at oh friend that's 1965. that's 55 years ago almost 56 years ago if we were there then where do you think we are now right how much further down the road are we oh in years you say well we're 55 years down 56 years down the road i'm not talking about years i'm talking about spirit right right that's what he's talking about where are we at what in the spirit he wasn't talking about 1965 he was talking about spiritually where we are spiritually my exhortation today that if he said that's 56 years ago where are we now mine the two are one two or one things that are to be now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds got to be word on word or word we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of the hour what is the manifestation of the hour people say oh they look for the return of jesus oh we all looking for the return of jesus but what is the return of jesus what is the return for our day our day i'm not talking about years ago i'm not talking about the future our day what is our day what does it mean when we talk about the return of jesus for our day it means that the dead in christ shall rise first those who are alive and remain will have a body change and we will all be caught up together to meet the lord in the air right that's what it means that's where we're at right if that's what it means then what does it mean for us what does it mean for us right now what is that that we're looking for see well we're looking for this we're looking for that but if we're a part of that bridegroom the word bride she must be the greatest oh the the greatest example the greatest indication we have of the coming of the lord for our day is the manifested sons and daughters of god the bride the word bride manifesting itself on this earth today is the greatest example we have of the second return of the lord jesus amen because he will not put his feet on this earth at that coming he will not but who does you looking at it i'm looking at her amen how does god put his feet on this earth today by walking in your shoe leather the manifested sons and daughters of god the manifestation of the bride for this day is the hour that we're living in praise the lord we must be that word bride what is it is that manifestation today this hour of that bride manifested sons and daughters of god not a creed not a denomination but living by every oracle of god a living a living attribute of god displaying the world the act displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that is to be expressed in this hour that we're now living express now we're talking about the expression of a bride for this hour amen the expression of the bride is the manifestation the manifestation is just the unveiling you understand the manifestation is simply an unveiling of what something is right and just showing what's inside there all god is doing is pulling the lid off that you can see everything else around i mean it's not that this bride has always been necessarily kid but the world around it's gotten so bad and so dark that the light that the bride is producing is brighter than ever it's manifesting greater than ever it's manifesting in this little church yes you know it we've seen it amen but i'm got to close here but there's a couple more things i really want to say brother and said in the rapture message he said now notice not only is the bride washed forgiven but she is justified we hit on that a minute ago did uh did you ever try to look up the word justified see what it means he said now for instance brother green heard that i've been drinking i've been doing bad things then found out that i didn't do it he'd come to me and says well i forgive you brother brown he said you forgive me for what i never did it what do you forgive me about see but if i'm guilty then i can be forgiven but i'm still not just because i did it but the word justified is though you've never done it at all right through it yes never did it gracefully amen justified the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin till it's put in the book of god's forgiveness he's the only one that can do it we can forgive but we can't forgive i can forgive you but i'll always remember you did these certain things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of god now that the record we're worried about we're concerned about that's what we care about amen in the eyes of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there listen listen to me standing there married to the virtuous son of god amen hallelujah married to the virtuous son of god hallelujah praise the lord amen that's the bride's invisible union married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place she was full ordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth she come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous no sin on her at all praise god praise the lord no sin at all on earth pray amen because she's the virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ you say now brother newton how how is it that she could be uh that she could be his bride let's let's just go over his wife let's go to a couple places again i'm closing here revelation 19 though bride's name the name change the bride's name change is miss jesus you've taken on his name revelation 19 now you've taken on his name the name of jesus it's not a name of father it's not a name of son it's not a name of holy ghost there's only one name right amen and that's the lord jesus christ that's his name that's why people get so scrupled up in baptism they baptize father son holy ghost he said in the name of the lord jesus christ that's a name amen that name change caused us to be miss jesus amen miss jesus not miss baptist oh no no no he's not gonna marry a miss baptist right he's not gonna marry a miss denomination he's gonna he's not going to marry a miss jeffersonville or or or a mis-message he's not marrying a mis-message friend right he's marrying miss jesus understand he's marrying miss jesus that name change is not changed to branham or message is changed to jesus understand praise that that message is the word yes and that's who we become that's who we always were actually that's who we always were you just come to know it amen that's who we always were we just come to know it praise the lord revelation 19 verse 5 and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great heard as it were the voice of great multitude as the voice of many waters the voice of the mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reign amen let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come amen now who is shouting man well he's talking about the voice of many waters what's that that's the ministry amen what's the ministry in this place this morning doing what's god speaking through these lips telling us today the marriage of the lamb has come praise the lord hallelujah the marriage of the lamb has come and who his wife had made herself ready right his wife we are the wife of jesus christ his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints clean pure he took my place so that i could take his well if i took his place then i'm i'm i'm clothed in the than the in the clean white unmerited uh favor of god the word of god that is my garment clean pure white without spot wrinkle or blemish but it's not because of what i did this was what he did amen you know i was just in prayer this morning it just struck me so strong i thought about you know how how sometimes people people relish in the grace of god today seems like more than ever and and i and a friend of amazing grace will always be my anthem you know that without the grace of god we're all lost and done but people take the grace of god and make a disgrace out of it so oh well if the grace of god is that prevalent then i just do anything i want you know and live any way i want to wear whatever one dress and act to do and you know and just and just be like the world and then it's going to be okay because god's going to forgive me anyway his grace will overcome that and i thought how much the grace of god and i started thanking god in my prayer i started thinking thank you god for everything you've done for me i mean i named things and right you know just talking to him and and i got to the place i thought god that that amazing grace to me when you get a revelation of the true grace of god it will cause you to want to be closer to him it'll cause you to want to be more like him it'll cause you to want to be more faithful to him it'll cause you to want to be less like the world it'll cause you to want to do anything that would ever hurt him again if you really get a revelation the grace of god yes i thought about my wife i thought about what brother talked about his work and and i i could sit here as a man and i could say oh my wife has been just a hundred percent faithful to me for 36 years she's so good and so faithful and shows so much grace i just go with any other woman now does that sound right does that sound like something does that sound like i love her does that sound like i appreciate the grace the faithfulness amen but that's how people treat god yeah they treat god like oh god you're so good to me you're so faithful to me and i love your grace so much now i'm just gonna go do whatever you don't love him that that a revelation of the grace of god will cause you to want to act and live your life to where you would never hurt him again that's the truth of what grace is amen revelation 21 i got one more verse i want to read revelation 21 9 just a page over they're coming to him uh come unto me one of the seven angels had the seven vowels uh full of the seven last plagues taught with me saying come hither i will show you the uh show thee the bride the lambs what what why why it's not unprecedented to realize that there's an invisible union taking place it's not that invisible union friend i'm sorry that's already taken place now there's others that may have come in amen there's others that may come in and including myself that come to realize who i am in that body but that that union taken place as a body of believers that that union has taken place god has already had that when when john the baptist came he said behold the lamb of god that take away the sin of the world that's right in a physical form jesus was standing there a corporal body of people left with john and went and followed jesus when brother brown came with this message in the unveiling of the son of man ministry what did he do and he was saying there is the lamb of god there's a union an invisible union but a union and it's changing the relationship the bride has had all through down through the ages and slipping that wedding band on now now it's the time that this bride is coming and and i just read your quote here but i'm not because i i've got to close there's that time where this bride is being pregnant amen impregnated the choosing of a variety talks about the church is being impregnated the bride being pregnated by what one's going to bring forth the nominational child the other's going to bring forth the word child amen but how could they be pregnant if they didn't have a relationship if we weren't his wife how could we bring forth those that are like him being fruitful and multiplying isn't just for the trees out here it's for the children of god we produce the fruit of the spirit which reveals jesus christ that others might come tonight it just reproduces the same life over again because he is the word in the sixth seal brother branham said he is coming there's a lot of women churches in the world but he is coming for his wife he is coming for his wife amen i believe that this bride that union has taken place he's coming that rapture is happening he's coming for his bride amen from glory to glory he's changing me he's changing us from glory to glory more in his image more in his likeness every day word upon word sell upon self word on word amen don't interject your own opinion your own thought your own dogma amen don't worry about what they say on tvn or on some radio station it's just word on the word amen word on word that's what that's why it came today the way it came that's why god had to send the prophet in this last day to bring those things together to talk about a couple weeks ago solidify that point to understand that's why it had to be because it's got to be a word ride coming forth christ and the bride united as one can't tell the two apart amen you know brother you know people say that about brother branham and all the things that they do and whatever you know he said i'd have to apologize if those people didn't exist i'd have to apologize for my ministry because i didn't live close enough to god to produce enough of god for people to think i was god that's that makes me want to crawl in the corner and sit off the end of a sheet of notebook paper and dang on my feet amen that makes me feel so small i was telling my wife i'mma close with this i was telling my wife yesterday i saw this saying the other day and i want you here now if you think you are too small to make a difference try sleeping with a mosquito if you think you're too small to make a difference try sleeping with a mosquito i got that point very clear amen very true and it count home to me because i've tried that and it doesn't work amen let's stand if we could amen you love the lord jesus amen he's so good to us isn't he thank you lord amen did you talk to them yeah i want to sing i would skip this if there was something going on song 591 let's sing this and then once again i want to uh something i wanted to discuss for those of you who weren't here last week amen when we get done with this michael turn the camera off so amen god bless you 591 who i am whom i am lord who are we today amen the unadulterated word of god the bride of jesus christ the lamb's wife amen oh glorious made my heart his very throne my life is [Music] is
