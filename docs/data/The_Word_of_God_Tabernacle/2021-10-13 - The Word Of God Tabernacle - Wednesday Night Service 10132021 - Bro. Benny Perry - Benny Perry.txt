love the word amen the message is what's thus said the lord amen glory and we have thus said the lord amen or we keep still come praise the lord and i i believe that god have a purpose for us being here tonight right yeah from all the way down you know from where this is from south carolina that's right and you may look at it just having a church meeting but i believe god had us here for a purpose right here for a purpose that's right let's find out what god be able to fulfill what god promised yes sir if you have your bibles let's turn to the book of judges and you will be familiar with the judges chapter 16 and then praise god amen and verse 28. he says and samson called unto the lord and said oh lord god remember me i pray thee strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may be at once revenge of the philistine for my two eyes and if you have uh uh once more brother brahma says here he says but notice samson thought there must be a possibility he caught the idea but the sad part is today the church don't catch that come on they don't realize that there is a possibility of a revival they don't realize the possibility they hadn't caught the vision yet yes they just said let's buy his amen heavenly father we thank you lord god for all the great things that you have done yes yes i pray god that you will move us out the way yes that the holy spirit will have the prayer amen lord we're here tonight by divine revelation lord you brought this together you orchestrated it and lord we thank you for what you've done bless the pastor here bless those that are listening online that want to be here for some reason they couldn't be here thank you lord for the supernatural yeah god you've been the same yesterday today and forever and to go in this service who was that the holy spirit would have the preeminence amen amen amen that testimony years ago and y'all maybe seen it when it was uh i think what the sister joyce was sister fleming was driving anyway and uh y'all know they had the head on accident i'm pretty sure that you i know since the gwen was there in the church the scandal was there in the church what happened and but the testimony was that what what got offered me was they when the police officer came he interviewed a 200 pound man that was in the in the car yeah and there was no men in the car there wasn't nobody but with ladies in the car and the officer interviewed the man and and and talked to him and when he got at the hospital he was interviewing everybody trying to he said that was a 250 pound man i talked to him i wrote it down i got it man and but that man wasn't there you know why let nothing take my fire that god put in me and don't you let nobody take the fire that god put in you samson had a gift to glory and god gave him a gift and that given how many know you have a gift you have to give to the holy ghost amen that the holy ghost is in you and grieve not the holy spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption amen had a divine gift that was given to him by god and you have the holy ghost that was given to you by god right what that same power the same life the same thing that was in jesus christ as he said a little while the world won't see me but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you know that i think today people in the message has got to a place come on that they so laid back come on back instead of realizing that you have the plan of god a redemption see if it was possible you could write another book of acts [Applause] what they really need and that's god living and [Applause] look at the people i'm getting ahead of myself you know this little pandemic we had come on man it's like if the church is like samson come on don't get quiet with samson i knew god that he had a divine gift that's right everybody knew that god he was a nazi right now i knew that his gift that god gave him no overcomer amen glory but when it happened the church again like samson did they going around feeling in other words trusted in their self come on trusting in their doctors right trusting in the cdc not trusted in all the things in the world but we are not of the world [Applause] let your pocketbook sister brother brandon was preaching one time they stole that man car he said send the holy ghost to break it back the man was stealing cars all over the country but when he bought god stopped him in the track trying to bring i don't know where i found it but i found it [Applause] uh samson mother father listen he says now brother brandon preached
