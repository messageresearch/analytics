[25:45] amen amen praise the Lord look of the
[25:49] Lord in prayer now we can take a couple
[25:50] prayer requests here
[25:53] um sister Norma texted me earlier this
[25:55] morning she's not with us today
[25:59] she's not with us today because
[26:02] Daniel Kathy I believe she just said
[26:05] Daniel tested positive for covet but
[26:08] then she wrote me back and said Daniel
[26:10] and Kathy uh are getting over covid but
[26:14] they still have a lot of cough going on
[26:16] so since she had been with them recently
[26:18] she and sister Norma herself not feeling
[26:21] any symptoms but decided to stay home as
[26:24] a precautions so please remember her
[26:26] please remember Danny and Kathy as well
[26:28] you know Kathy is Norma's daughter
[26:31] Daniel's the gentleman that built the
[26:33] pulpit here for us so we know them very
[26:36] well but please remember them in prayer
[26:37] if you would
[26:39] um also got a prayer request appear from
[26:42] brother Danny
[26:44] thank you buddy uh please uh prayers for
[26:49] uh prayers for these mass shootings to
[26:53] cease
[26:54] uh an analyst pointing out that
[26:56] sometimes when there is one in the same
[26:59] area it may increase encourage others to
[27:02] do the same we have had more mass
[27:04] shootings uh than than days of this year
[27:09] um
[27:10] assuming that means that means that uh
[27:14] this is the 29th day of the year there's
[27:16] been over 29 mass shootings
[27:19] they could they consider it's it's a
[27:21] little deceiving though they they
[27:23] consider in statistics a mass shooting
[27:26] is more than two people or more than
[27:28] three people I forget it's more than two
[27:30] or three people so
[27:32] I guess when a when a person goes into a
[27:35] home and kills two or three people is
[27:37] considered a mass shooting anyway not
[27:39] going to a Walmart or to a fair or
[27:41] something and shooting up people or
[27:43] shooting out of the top of a hotel
[27:45] building in Las Vegas thank you buddy
[27:47] it's just we're more than three people
[27:50] are shot by one person is considered a
[27:52] mass shooting any any and all is
[27:54] unacceptable but we do know
[27:57] we are living and still living and
[27:59] Satan's Eden but it doesn't change how
[28:03] we feel about it in our hearts amen and
[28:06] I agree with brother Danny would be
[28:08] wonderful have these things that they
[28:10] would stop so amen
[28:12] do you remember that let's remember that
[28:14] request in prayer also
[28:17] um
[28:17] we also have a very deep heart deep felt
[28:20] request from Brother Pat and sister Pat
[28:25] um
[28:26] he texted me the other day I told him
[28:28] I'd leave it up to him as he as how he
[28:30] proceeded to let everyone in the
[28:32] congregation know but for the Pat's
[28:34] grandson Patrick Echo Patrick Henry
[28:37] Echols III uh passed away two days ago
[28:41] uh family I guess found him dead uh he
[28:44] was a pilot
[28:45] and uh airplane pilot and a Christian
[28:48] believer so that's what brother Pat if
[28:52] you wanted to add anything brother Pat
[28:54] feel free to or if you just leave it
[28:55] with this grandson he's only 31 years
[28:58] old 31 years old forgot to write read
[29:00] that part to the excuse me
[29:03] 31 years old
[29:06] it's very much a tragic tragedy of
[29:09] course the namesake of brother Pat and
[29:12] that sees the third so brother Pat
[29:14] Ackles the third passed away a couple
[29:16] days ago so please remember the family

[34:31] sister Matisse
[34:36] go ahead sister yeah
[34:38] um I went to the bus stop this morning
[34:40] and um
[34:42] and had the best fellowship and I did I
[34:46] thought I mean I hope church is just
[34:48] half as good this morning
[34:50] and what happened was I told the story
[34:54] of a person that had had a dream that he
[34:57] was dying to be entering into a race and
[35:00] he had his little tag on to his
[35:02] registration for the race and he put it
[35:05] on and he started to uh it was one of
[35:08] those triathlons where he had run and
[35:10] you swim and you know bicycle and
[35:12] everything and so he started off running
[35:15] just as hard as he could in this race
[35:17] and so he's getting along on the path
[35:20] and there's this old man in the path and
[35:22] he's just wanting to talk to him and so
[35:25] he he stops and he's gracious and he
[35:27] talks to him and then he's just getting
[35:29] so nervous inside and he says you know
[35:31] I'm sorry but I'm in a race and I've
[35:33] gotta get going and so the man
[35:36] graciously he says okay so he takes off
[35:39] and he runs and he's going as hard as he
[35:42] can and then he gets to the part where
[35:44] he's swimming and then he's swimming as
[35:46] hard as he can and he's just you know
[35:48] he's pouring it on and it's like the
[35:49] last part of the race and he's gotta and
[35:52] he gets to that and he climbs out of the
[35:54] water and he gets to the finish line and
[35:56] he looks down in his tag for it is
[35:58] missing he can't find his tag
[36:02] it can't be a a a contestant
[36:07] and so he
[36:09] all that effort for nothing it breaks
[36:11] down a new Wheats and this woman comes
[36:13] over to him and says you know somebody
[36:16] turned in your tag for you
[36:19] it was um it and he thought about it a
[36:22] minute and he realized it was the old
[36:24] man and he realized he met Jesus is on
[36:27] the path
[36:28] now I'm in the shower this morning and
[36:30] I'm thinking about the scripture that
[36:32] says run the race you know that we might
[36:34] receive the prize and I was just
[36:36] thinking when I thought well what is the
[36:38] prize you know just kind of General with
[36:39] me the Holy Spirit spoke back to me and
[36:42] he said the Holy Spirit
[36:48] praise the Lord amen
[36:52] wonderful it is to be faithful to run
[36:55] this race with patience amen praise the
[36:58] Lord no time to quit now you know the
[37:02] last mile of any race is the hardest
[37:04] mile
[37:05] amen is the longest hardest mile but we
[37:09] continue to press amen press this battle
[37:11] press forward keep going amen not a time
[37:15] to quit
[37:18] it had already been turned in for him at
[37:20] the beginning of the race amen
