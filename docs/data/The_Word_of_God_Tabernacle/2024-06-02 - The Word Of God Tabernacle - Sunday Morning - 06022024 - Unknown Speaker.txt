her sister oh I'm sorry [Music] that's what was her name Leah Leah anybody else oh sorry I didn't mean to cut anybody off Lord Jesus we come before you father Jesus with grateful Hearts knowing that by your grace you look for us and brought your Plan of Salvation into our hearts Lord and it's all by Grace gra you sa us your grace will keep us and your grace will Jes take us home we're living in the hour father where the enem is fighting us harder than ever before and Lord It's like you said to Israel one time I have stretched out my hands oh yes to uh uh disobedient and gang people amen and Lord that's what you're doing with your bride right now Lord you're stretching out you're calling us to get right with you to stay with your word to have a life that is pleasing in your side worthy of your gospel and father there's so many that I believe had haven't fully waken up Lord you gave us a lesson about those 10 virgins yes five were wise and five were foolish the wise had their oil had that Holy Spirit Born Again experience and they were always keeping their walk with you in line with your word staying away from the world Amen staying away from the things that'll hinder him in their walk with you and then there was the foolish father the foolish they they look good they might quote the word quote the message but father there's something in their heart that stops them from fully lining up with your word they lack that Born Again experience father that's why it's a struggle to come to church that's a struggle to pray sincerely one for another it's a struggle father to pay our ties it's a struggle to truly lift one another in encouragement in love in whatever it takes to be a real Christian yes Lord Jesus and Lord help us to get away from all carnality all things of the flesh it's like Paul said the things that I want to do I don't do it the things I know I shouldn't be doing I do father it's it's that flesh that fights us every time Jesus and there's a time that as you you taught us in your word about this late and SE Church age they blind miserable naked wretched and don't even know it yes there's blindness that's h amongst uh the believer this day they're blind they can constantly hear the word and the word Goes Forth to uh teach him what's right to teach him what it takes to be in full obedience to your word but that blindness is stopping them from lining up to your word oh Lord help us to not be in that condition at any time if we don't wake up we refuse to line up with your word we're going to find ourselves in that Great Tribulation Jesus we're going to find ourselves seeking you when your Holy Spirit has left the Gentiles and gone back to the Jew oh Lord we want to truly live your life and What It Is What It Takes it's like Paul says I Die daily brother Brown said my worst enemy is William Brown it takes for us to die to ourselves die to our thinking and be out of the way that your Holy Spirit may have pre preeminence and work through US Lord there are niece this morning our several sisters that I can recall as a prayer request was shared sister Karen sister Lydia sister Norma with her daughter-in-law and oh Lord we know

minister to each and everyone the healing touch that deliverers they need at this time for we know that truly you are a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed Jesus yes and Lord for the ones like our sister goon that needs a job and others that might be struggling financially yes Jesus you're our Jehovah Gyra our great provider as we

amen praise the Lord we're going to go back over to uh Second Corinthians uh chapter 10 amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10 we're going to read the verse of scripture there that we've been reading on this subject the Gateway the Mind amen the battle of the Mind greatest battle ever fall we want to continue along that thought if we could today am then sort of the go into the scripture that brother Denis quoted for us in his prayer today amen we're going to start with 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and read one verse of scripture if we could amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10 just in case that's not recording I always try to record them on myone Amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads for a word of prayer if we could before you lord lord Jesus father we're so very thankful God of your grace your mercy your blessings your love all that you give for us all that you do to us lord it's everything in our lives you are everything God so many people in this world want to make you a part of their lives father but the true born again Christian doesn't want to make you a part of their lives you are their lives yes there is no life without you there is no life beside you and God you're not just a part of our Lives you are us you are our lives without you we are nothing God we just commit ourselves to you Lord yielding our members Into The Obedience of your word Lord Into The Obedience of the holy spirit that lives in and through us God may you continue to bless and strengthen us along this journey and bless this service today God as we felt your presence trust you to be here and know God that you are the same yesterday today and forever God may you bless these people that have come may you bless those who may be watching today uh Lord I just pray God that everything is working God somehow uh that everybody will be able to hear this and God it'll be to your glory and honor Satan tries to trip things up every chance that he can get but Lord by your grace you've given us the blessings that we uh uh need God from you and trust in you God that you're going to continue to see us through Lord may you continue to bless remain part of this service as we rebuke every demonic spirit that try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way he has no right to be here father so we commit ourselves to you and all that we do today and all that is done all that is accomplished in this service may it be to your glory and honor father and let it be according to how you would have it uh before the foundation of the world in your mind trusting you in it God and and believing father for your spirit and your love and for this time we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen 2 Corinthians we're going to read CH uh 2 Corinthians 10 and verse 5 2 Corinthians 105 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringeth into captivity every thought to the ob Obedience of Christ amen you can be seated if You' like amen it's a way to live a Victorious life amen we've read through the scripture many times we have not brought necessarily any out to during this study but uh we we've known that there's been god- calleded men there's been gifted men there's been gifted people through the scripture that have had gifts that have had callings uh that have been handpicked by God that went astray uh they they didn't necessarily lose their inheritance but they lost their Victory amen a lot of times today people end up in that situation uh brother Dennis talking about uh sister Lydia's sister and uh many people they may have gotten the victory they may have gotten themselves uh into the hands of the Lord and they may have given themselves to God and and brought him and claimed him as their lord and savior and maybe even back baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh maybe maybe even filled with the Holy Ghost amen but it's to whom you yield your members is to what victory you have or don't have yes amen amen uh Saul was handpick and chose by God God told Samuel go pick Saul Saul is the guy he's the one I want when you see where Saul went amen he didn't lose his inheritance he didn't lose his place because when the witch of Endor called Samuel up from the grave Samuel's prophecy was that you saw and your sons will be with me this time tomorrow I believe that's right tomorrow so and and I don't believe Samuel didn't lose his his placement so if Saul was going to be with Samuel and Samuel was with the Lord uh by transverse property Saul was going to be with the Lord yes so it wasn't that Saul lost his inheritance if you will but he lost his victory yes because he began to live by the dictates of his mind of what he thought was best of what he thought would be a better way of doing something of his ways of his thoughts and that's where we get tripped up so many times that we don't obey this scripture that tells us to bring every thought into captivity to The Obedience of the word amen when you bring every thought into captivity in obedience to the word and you yield your members to that you will live in Victory amen you will live a Victorious Life yeah because your members your body your self your mind will be yielded to God the victory will be there inherently simply because of The Obedience of God's word amen so it depends the way to live a Victorious life not live a Victorious Life it's up to the individual amen it's our choice we can choose to or not to it depends on us amen but there's a way to live the Victorious Life and yes you you can real quick you can have you can have the Holy Ghost and you still will can yield your members to things that you know you shouldn't do or or ways you shouldn't go amen now obviously uh the Lord has his way to bring things back to where they should be and that's where forgiveness comes and repentance comes and making things right comes and uh a person can backslid and still be in the hands of God remember the prodical son was never not a son no matter what he did no matter where he went no matter what he did no matter what how he uh conducted his life he was always a son he was always a son you're son of God you've always been always will be son or daughter of God no matter which uh uh uh rout I remember one time brother random telling a story about uh a guy that I I can't remember the circumstances of the story but he got off and he backslid and he was going just down a dark dark path and and the man uh drowned and died and the Lord and and if I remember right brother Bram said the Lord was merciful to the man because he was going down such a dark path God took him before he got too far yes amen I believe those were the words he even used before he got too far God took him amen but that's why God that's why the Lord died and shed his blood and gave us Redemption and gave us forgiveness and gave us grace and mercy now we don't take the grace of God and make a disgrace out of it absolutely not amen but there's a way there's there's a life us to live that is in Victory the victory of yielding our members to the Lord Jesus now let's go over to Philippians speaking of the scripture brother Dennis and quoted Philippians chapter 2 Philippians chapter 2 let's begin in Reading with verse one amen Philippians chapter 2 verse one praise the Lord if there be therefore any consolation in Christ any consoling if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies that's Tender Mercies that's from as we would call it today the heart amen but he's talking about the very most inwardness of a person their bowel amen and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded so the joy that he's speaking of here is for the people to be likeminded amen likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind now remember what brings contention pride pride bringeth contention how does pride boil up in a person when a person thinks that they are better than the next person right they become puffed up and prideful I know more than you I'm smarter than you I'm better than you I'm higher than you I'm greater than you I got a better position I got a bigger house I got a nicer car I got a bigger bank account I got a better job whatever it is it swells up a person in their Spirit into a place of Pride and pride is what brings contention right that's why Paul's saying here fulfill ye my joy and be likeminded so in that case there's nobody cuz remember in the sunship of Jesus Christ there is no big eyes and little yous there is no preferential treatment one over the other it don't matter what place they held when they were here on Earth or what gifts they did or did not have in the sunship of Jesus Christ we are all the same yes we're all on the same level he's talking about here bringing that reality into our life lives in our Humanity our carnality in this life before we get to the other side be likeminded having the same love the Same Love could you imagine what this world would be like if no one was prideful no one was boastful even even the greatest remember brother bam said the greatest leader would be a benevolent dictator amen we love our democracy and of course in this world it it probably works as good as any but um but the best government would be that that's Ran by A benevolent dictator and basically what he's saying is that the best one would be the one that God runs because God is a benevolent dictator you know what benevolent benevolent means that the person that's ruling over you has nothing but your best interest and his heart amen amen he wants nothing but the best for you that's what someone unconditionally loves benevolent they they put you first even though they're the ones in charge they put you first praise the Lord a benevolent dictator is one that's going to do everything they can to make it better not for themselves but for their subjects for the people around them see that's humility a benevolent dictator isone who is humble it's one who doesn't consider themselves above everybody even though they are or better let's just say better than anybody else amen but of the same ey could you imagine what this world would be like today if everybody was in that position if everybody was in that place of all the people of all the thoughts of all the ideas of all the creations of all the inventions of all the religions of all the gods of all the everything if everybody had this in one mind the likeminded of the same love being a one Accord you imagine what it would be like well it would be Utopia right it would be like the place we're going to yes it would be like heaven praise God because that's the way Heaven's going to be amen Paul's saying fulfill my joy that all ye now he's talking to a selected group I'm just saying if the whole world was like that could you imagine could you imagine if just the City of Tucson was like that amongst message Believers what this city would be like this city would be turned upside down Saints it wouldn't know what to do with itself amen amen I I believe you imagine and think if the country was like that if the world was like that my mind what would it be but that's what he's saying that's the joy that it would give to him amen I can't think of one of the one of the greatest joys in my opinion I believe my wife shared that with me but as we were growing up and as we had children one of the greatest Joys that we had in our life was watching our two children play together enjoy one another's company have fun together laughing and enjoying and playing and having fun and being brother and sister that was one of the greatest Joys amen one of the worst Thorns was watching them fight so you can imagine if you put yourself in that position what Paul's talking about he's talking about his children that he birth forth into Christ if they were likeminded loving one another with the same love feeling the same way about everyone it's the same thing and some people say well that's just you know sit down and no it's the spirit of God Amen that can bring us into that capacity because he goes on to say this being of one Accord of one mind amen amen being of one mind praise the Lord let nothing here we go now let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory pridefulness nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in liness of what the mind the mind in the liness of of the mind so yes there is a place of a humility in the mind of a of of a lowering of what we would say the the pride is that we would have uh my th and no more or as it is it seems like today me and nobody else it's not even four anymore it's just that person they don't care as long as they get that parking space they don't care you've been sitting there 10 minutes waiting for it as long as they get that light they don't care if they run over you as long as they're getting through the life amen they don't care if they go 40 m hour of the speed minute as long as they're in front of you they don't care cuz they're first and they're going to be first and nothing else matters their time their place their mind their thought that's all that matters it seems like that's becoming very prevalent in the world today yeah but this helps us understand don't do anything to strive for vain glory to Puff me up or to lift me up amen what we don't we don't do this to try to make a name for ourselves amen we don't do this this to for great wealth or to become popular or anything vain Glory no we do it because we want to help one another we do it to increase the body of Christ in liness humility of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves that's what a benevolent dictator does amen and if we as the subjects of a benevolent dictator God if we have the likeminded of him of one another then we're going to do and live as he does and lives and that is putting us before himself putting us first he's always done that if God did not put us first friends we would have no hope yes we would be lost dying going to hell if the first time they come up and say well if they're not going to accept me they're done amen you sealed your faith that's not God right cuz he knows that's not what's best for his children he loves you he loves you UNC not just loves you he loves you unconditionally amen so he esteems you better than himself how did he prove that he went to Calvary he didn't have to he didn't do anything wrong he wasn't going there for himself he wasn't sinful he didn't commit a sin he didn't have a wrong thought but yet he died the most cruel death that humans ever died why because he put you first yes not himself but you yes you think that was something that made him somebody no he didn't do it to go through all because of he did it for you esteem other better than himself so now what's he telling us to do the exact same thing amen to esteem others better than ourselves putting our brothers first putting our sisters first loving amen unconditionally as he does to us it's just a matter of that being our influence for a life to be lived through us to everyone else to others Este seeing other better than themselves amen Jesus did that it reminds me of it reminds me of brother green story brother brandom uh I think I've told y'all this story before when I came out I was uh just freshly hadn't even been pastoring for a year in Florida and we decided to come out for the convention in December and brother green started giving some testimonies and stories that it quickened to me uh that uh well well I satting there on the Pew the Lord said he's going to call you to preach tomorrow night cuz it was that it was that convention where brother green said if you're a minister be prepared he said I I'm not giving you any notice he said I'm going to I'm going to call you out and point at you and you better be ready to preach and I was a nobody from Florida that pastored as many people sitting here today I wasn't anything important I wasn't anything special I'd never even met brother green before I met him a couple days when we got here so he knew who I was but I didn't never met him before he didn't know who I was but the spirit of the Lord spoke to me and said I sat there with my mom he said he's going to call you to preach tomorrow night and I said oh my what do I do and I'm you know in myself I'm sitting here Lord what do I do I I I don't I don't I don't know what to say I mean I I got books full of messages but that I I don't I don't preach because I got books full of messages I preach what the Lord puts on my heart what whatever it is if it's if it is the first sermon out of a brand new book today or it's something that the Lord's given me before I only would preach what the Lord gives me I didn't have anything honestly had nothing and so brother green started talking about his experiences with brother brandom and the things that he did and remember you all remember the dart story brother green said that uh he sat over and watched brother brandom and brother brandom just he'd hit the Bull's Eye every time just in true brother Brandon fashion hit the bullseye the darts every time every Dart he threw hit hit the Bull's Eye brother green sitting there watched him and he went up and challenged him said let's let's play a game brother brother brandom he said okay sure we'll play we'll play a game we'll play the 21 whatever it is he said okay so brother green and of course brother Bram said you go first brother Perry brother green go D he throws a four and brother random gets up there and he throws a five or a three or how do you score darts is it low or high anyway I don't remember but he threw one and the brother brandom's Dart was worse than brother Green's brother brother green got up there he threw another you get three darts he threw another one there a 10 brother brandom gets up there and he throws one that's worse and brother green is just mystified so brother green this is his testimony he did his third and last Dart he throws it completely off the board he just threw it over somewhere he said brother Brown did the exact same thing didn't even hit the board with the darts man had just put however many darts right in the center of that board couldn't even hit the board now and brother green says I don't understand brother B said what what are you talking about brother per he said I sat over there for whatever time it was watching you throw these darts and you hit the bullseye every single time he said I get up there and I play with you you can't even hit the board he said what what is the problem he said so well brother green that's simple he said if there's any joy in winning why don't I let you enjoy it he said I know what I can do I can he knew he knew he can hit the Bull's Eye every time if you wanted to he said but if there's any joy in winning why don't I let you enjoy it that's esteeming other better than themselves and that's when God quickened the message to me that I was going to preach night and when I came up there I knew exactly what the Lord wanted me to say Amen now what happened during that service that's up to the Lord but I did what I felt the Lord had me to do that was esteeming other better than themselves Jesus Christ did it when he showed himself when he went to Calvary and every believer if we look at this and we believe this word the way it says amen now I'm not saying I'm said I preach this before and I've gone and had people and they have a little simple teenagers volleyball game or something and I said I'm not I'm not telling you to purposely throw the volleyball game you know hit the ball over the net you know see what happens I'm not saying purposely lose brother brandham did that with brother green and just just played the game so everybody was asking me well should we lose purposely no that's not the point amen it had the the the point is esteeming other better than themselves amen amen and that and uh and that's just a simple game that they played to to do such so but esteeming other better than themselves with the humbleness of Mind esteeming other better than themselves if you want to do anything in this life in this world especially now that is the most contrary thing amen I know we look different I know we look I know uh people think you're crazy nuts whatever it is the the the most separative thing you can do in the world today that would be as contrary to the world standards today is esteeming others better than yourself right because that's absolutely the opposite contous I see sisters with long hair and dresses there's plenty of women out there that have long hair and wear dresses I see them all the time that doesn't make him a Believer amen that doesn't make them Christians but if you esteem other better than themselves that's something the world does not do that is completely contrary to the devil and everything he espouses and lives through through people his subjects today esteeming other better than themselves that's a that is a victory that is beyond anything else amen you ever heard that you ever heard you have a Harden phrase It's better to give than receive you don't hardly hear that anymore because most people don't believe that they'd rather get than give but it's the truth it's more blessed is it to give than to receive well it's the same thing you're you're esteeming others better than yourselves you want more for them than you do for yourself amen I'm content look Saints Paul said wherever you find yourself whatever state you find yourself in to be there with content amen that doesn't mean you just become a bum and don't do anything no it means that what lot that the Lord has given you through the labor of your hands be happy be content thank God God has blessed me God has saved me God has provided for me God is here for me I'm content with what the Lord's GI me amen content is great gain if we will accept it and if we stay in that place of contentment we don't worry about what the other person has or what the other person does because I'm happy where I am I'm happy who I am I'm happy what the Lord's given me I'm content with what God has done for me I thank God that he's given me a place to live it might not be the $10 million mansion on the hillside over here although I might have one of those waiting for me anyway uh it might not be up there but I have a place to live and I'm happy I'm thankful amen this place right here might not be the tajma hall it might not be the 30,000 seat place that some Churches in this country have but it's very humble and I thank God every time for it yes amen when I come in here and I pray in the morning I thank God for giving us this place yes amen if it come a time where this wasn't working anymore he'd have another place whatever it is but I thank him that he's given it for us amen we might have glitches in our equipment we might have things happen uh there might only be a handful of a show up but God has blessed us with it and I'm thankful amen content yes content if you're content you don't worry about what the other guy's doing or what the other guy's got or how many people's in his church or how great the whatever it is you know you don't worry about that's that's not a consideration that comes in your mind because that that will bring contentment and that will that will breing pridefulness and contentment amen and that is not or U not contentment that will that will breed pride and contention that's what I'm trying to say that will bring contention not contentment amen then contention then will bring bring a division between people and then you you've got the world like we have today just or the country just divided right straight basically down the middle and both sides hate each other amen when it seems like that the normal human just wants to be happy and live a happy good healthy life right amen amen steeming other better than themselves look not every man for verse on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind amen he's describing that that this mind what that mind of loneliness that that mind of esteeming other better than themselves let this mind be in you which was also look now which was also in Christ Jesus praise the Lord now it's telling us to have the mind of Christ that mind of Christ will bring you to that place amen because it'll obey 2 Corinthians 10 for we bring every thought into captivity to The Obedience of Christ the word amen who being now who Jesus Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God form we know we said many times that word form means inm Mor amen he morph himself as God did people want to say there's so many gods how many gods there one God morphing himself well what did he do he morphed himself he's the father morphed himself he's he is the son he is the holy spirit God morphing himself God who Jesus Christ being in the form the EM morha of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now the problem the Satan had the problem that Lucifer had is that his desire was to be exalted above God right Amen to be the object of worship instead of God that was his problem Jesus being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal it didn't take anything from God Amen so when you when we as Christians act Godly and live Christian lives live Godly lives that's not detracting from God that's adding to God that's bringing God in a place to where he has people through his benevolent dictatorship that that love him so much that they want to do everything and in every way like he does Amen that doesn't detract from God being in the form of God does not take away from God amen that being you say it says robbery to be equal with God Amen well in in in the Garden of Eden what did God what's one of the first things God did in the Garden of Eden he put a man in there and he said subdue it you are the God of this Earth if you want that tree moved just tell it to move if you want that animal to be a lion just tell it whatever it is that you are the god of the earth that's one of the first things God did was to put a man down here and put him in complete control over this Earth that's what he did so how is it robbery for today for us to be Christians for us to be Christlike for us to be Godly examples for us to live a life that's obedient to the word that's not taking away from God that's add that's adding to God that's showing that's showing more and more of God's omnipotence amen but it where was it now let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus thought it not Rob to be equal with God in the form of God what does it do to us what does it do for us but made himself of no reputation and took upon on him the form of a servant again that word form is a morha took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men the likeness of men though he was yet still God made in the likeness of man he looked just like us amen hands feet toes amen being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself praise God he humbled himself and became OB obedient unto death even the death of the Cross and as we said before he didn't do that for himself he didn't do that because he had to he didn't do it because he wanted to necessarily himself in the flesh yeah right but he esteemed you above himself amen not my will but thine be done that's the Cry of every believer wherefore God also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen God esteemed him in that position the victory the victory now that we were talking about before the victory of likeminded comes from the humility amen of the Mind comes from the loneliness and the humility of having the mind of Christ the mind of Christ took him to Calvary in the form of a servant who wants to be a servant who who nobody wants to be a servant everybody wants to be the king everybody wants to be in chared everyone wants to be the ruler I know sometimes I go on the job and somebody will look over here and say well how are things going why it's not going very well why is that we got too many chiefs and not enough Indians cuz everybody wants to be the boss everybody wants to do it their way everybody thinks they have a better idea or a better way of doing it amen just do it the way the blueprint says amen do it the way the blueprint says amen it's that simple the man who's really in charge is the one who wrote The Blueprint amen just do what it says amen then we're all Indians at that point if you will excuse the expression we're all obedian all servants if you will we're all the ones that that serve the Lord and it and it comes from that the victory comes of the loneliness humility amen Victory comes through humility let's go over to Romans chapter 8 read you a quote as you're going over look at that we're going to go to Romans 8 but look at this while you're looking did you ever see people this me and my wife have talked about this so so many times and when I saw this and I was doing some research thought I just I just got to read that did you ever see people looking at he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1961 did you ever see people that you love to be around you love to be around them you and my me and my wife said that so many times about sometimes when you go places and message churches and you think well the person doesn't necessarily seem to be at all interested in trying to live the life or or really even as we would know be a Christian but they come and they're there and they're in service I me I know it seemed like a lot in Tucson we don't get that here but in Tabernacle it seemed to be quite often and we think why why would people come well look brother R said they're just people that you just love to be around some people come because they they feel they love to feel the spirit they feel when they come to that place they love to feel the the atmosphere that they're around amen you know a lot of times uh you know a person think about a couple of the guys on my team a person can go to a bar or or go to a store and think about all the alcohol they want they about any any alcohol that they want beer liquor whatever it is they can buy as much as they won't go home and drink it but bars are one of the most popular places that we have on this in this country why are bars so popular amen I mean say well there's people around well have those people come to your house I guarantee well I don't have any idea I would assume that the that the liquor at a bar is a lot more expensive than you can get the grocery store just invite people to come to your house then why do they go to a bar it's the atmosphere there's something about that amen it's the same thing going to a ball game there's an atmosphere and a lot of people feed off of that they go to bars because they like that atmosphere they go there because they like that that feeling that they get well then it's just some people like you said like brother bar said here did you ever see people um did you ever see people you love to be around just love to be around them amen sometimes people come they just they just love that atmosphere they love that feeling and why wouldn't they here I mean if they come to a a Godly Holy Ghost filled Church why wouldn't they love to I mean the feeling the the the the the spirit because they create an atmosphere yes amen bar creates an atmosphere me a ball game creates an atmosphere Church creates an atmosphere a political event creates an atmosphere amen it's an atmosphere that's created by all of where does it come comes out of their comes from their mind amen which is the wound of the spirit remember because they create an atmosphere here a Heavenly atmosphere and you just love to be around them praise God God I think that has a lot to do with what brother bam said about coming to church amen others seem to be good people but you just I have to get away once in a while this that you know what I mean he says and they yet seem to be good people it's not creative and a man was good to be uh a man was made to be a God we know that Genesis 1:26 he had dominion over the whole earth he was made an amateure God and now when he receives God he becomes a Son of God he was made in the image of God God had hands God had feet therefore a man was made like him so he is an amateure God but sin blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart but now don't never try to State it out he says you can't figure it out the garden of eight in the Garden of Eden as we've said this to begin this service this uh study he said in the beginning in the Garden of Eden Satan chose his part of the man his head his intellectuals God took his heart the intellectuals will reason well I'm this way I'm that way you'll never get anywhere with God there intellectuals you'll never get anywhere with God in your intellectuals that's right you cast down reasoning see you must be positive you must stay there until you are positive that there's nothing positive that nothing can turn you can turn you away the greatest Victory the the uh the the greatest Victory is the Walk of Faith yes amen the faith is humility this is a walk of Faith the walk that we walk is a walk of Faith yes amen we must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now had you turn to Romans 81 let's go through this real quick or go through it as the Lord leads I shouldn't say real quick but this uh we'll finish up with this uh Romans 8 chapter uh chapter 8 verse one there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what is the mind the mind is flesh yes amen you don't walk after the mind you don't walk after your ideas your opinions your ways you think are the best ways don't walk by your mind you don't walk by the flesh but you walk after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh again in the likeness of sinful flesh and for our sin condemn sin in the flesh or eradicated if you will amen eradicated done away with sin in the flesh so the things even that have been done contrary to the scripture in the flesh have been put under the blood of Christ amen or shall as I said annihilated by the blood of Christ never to be remembered by God again never held to your account again amen praise the Lord condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us so he didn't do away with the law amen he just brought about by the blood a way for the righteousness of the law the righteousness to be fulfilled in us now who are born of the spirit who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit we follow by the spirit those who are of the Flesh of the Mind follow those things those that of the Spirit Fall by walk by remember it's just the Walk of Faith right amen the Walk of Flesh the Walk of intellect is something normally you can see or smell or hear or something is a walk of the flesh the Walk of the spirit is a walk of Faith amen because a walk of faith is a walk one day at a time one step at a time it's like that story that brother told that man uh after he preached come out said I uh Mr brand I don't believe this uh uh by this Revelation uh uh how do you know that this Revelation exists and he said well he said and he tried to give him some ideals and reason with him he said and finally come down the guy just wasn't believeing then brother BR said well where you going he said I'm going back home and he said uh well where's home he said well it's just over this hill up over here and go over this ride and it's done you down the other side and it's just sitting right there to my house he said well how do you know the house is there he said well I've been there I believe it I I've see he said well what does that mean to you then he means it it's a revelation to you because you know because brother bramon he said well you can't see it he said but I know it's there he said but you can't see it you can't feel it you can't smell it you can't declare any of your five physical senses to that house so how do you know well I know it's there I believe it's there why because you've experienced it praise the lord it's come to you by Revelation faith is a revelation by faith you know it's there he said well uh then brother BR once he got that across the man he said well how now how you going to get there he said well I got a there's a path that goes up over here and goes up over the rice he said well how do you there's no path you can't see the path he said well I got a lantern he said well what is a lantern do it just lights one step at a time amen just one step at a time that's all the light will do the light will light up the light will illuminate the path but it'll only illuminate one step at a time so what is he trying to get to the man it's a walk of faith faith is a revelation just get him to understand no you can't see the house but you know it's there you can't see the path but you know it's there how you going to walk on it got a l i got a light and the light directs me for one step at a time everybody wants to everybody seems to you know brother green always told that story brother BR said everybody wants to know the future yes you well brother per you want me to tell you yours yeah I want said no no no I don't want to know I don't want to know don't tell me acts like they want to know their future what's coming next or something be prepared no I'm not tell you how to be prepared have your life in Christ that'll prepare you for anything that comes amen it's so walk of Faith one step at a time to be carnally minded is death to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is an enemy against God it's enmity against God for it is is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be that's why s like we said last week that's why Satan chose it Body Spirit Soul Satan did not choose the part that he knew could be sealed out from him so he chose the part that he knew he could manipulate even if you're a born again Christian he could manipulate it that's the part he chose amen carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be it's the flesh amen but the righteousness cannot be subject to the law but the righteousness of the law the Holy Spirit can bring that mind like you do to yield your members to righteousness and not unrighteousness your mind cast down reasonings cast down imagination cast down the things that might come contrary to the word and bring them into complete obedience praise the Lord amen the carnal mind is imity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be amen the the the the the mind is flesh and can corrupt so then they that but the soul that is born of God cannot cannot praise the Lord so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but ye are in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his but we belong to God because the spirit of God is in US us the spirit of God is leading us the spirit of God has taken control over every part now what we yield to the B the Bible didn't say that God would bring every one of your thoughts to captive to the word it tells you to bring every thought cap it's whom you yield your members to amen not God God's done God's done his part the rest is up to us that's the whole part of being a free preoral agent living for God serving God loving God not because we have to or because he makes us but because we love him because we want to amen the greatest Victory because we want to 1 Corinthians chapter 1 First Corinthians chap 1 verse 10 Paul sort of like he told he was explaining to the Philippians here he tells to the Corinthian Church 1 Corinthians 1 verse 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment a lot of what he told the Philippian church amen to be of the same mind together don't be divided don't let these things separate you don't let the devil bring some kind of wedge in there Amen to bring some kind of feelings towards somebody that doesn't belong Amen Let There be no divisions be perfectly joined together in the same mine praise the Lord for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you remember we've already talked about the contentions what brings contention Pride that's what I mean David told us that in Psalms I believe it was the Psalms U actually maybe it was I'm trying to remember now if it was Proverbs it be anyway 12th verse now this I say that every one of you sayith I am of Paul and I am of Apollos and I am of cus and I of Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you but christas and gas lest any should say that I have baptized in my my own name he did not Paul didn't want any Glory at all he didn't want people following him he wanted people following Christ all of these that he's talking about sephus Apollos all Christ all the same mind don't follow them follow Christ brother Bram did the same thing don't follow brother brandom follow of Christ he lived a life to be exemplified absolutely but but I don't follow him I follow Jesus Christ I don't follow great ministers that come all over I don't follow them I follow Christ amen praise the Lord I thank God I baptize none of you but Christmas and gas lest any should say that I have baptized in my own name and I baptized also the household of Stephan stephanus besides I know not whether I baptized any other and and he thank God that he didn't baptize any other but what he's telling the same thing be of one mind be of the same mind come together as the same mind as the same people let that mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus if that mind that was in Christ is in you it will do that it will accomplish in you now you yield your members as you are a born again Christian you yield your members to that Spirit to that life to that mind that is now in you to obey the word one I'm going to read one more scripture and I'm going to close here uh Ephesians chapter 2 first three verses Ephesians 2:1 and you hath he Quicken that is to make aive who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time pass ye he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience or still work in the children of Disobedience of one of whom you used to be one of whom I used to be a child of Disobedience that disobedient spirit is still prevalent in the world today amen third verse now among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind so that tells us that there's fleshly lustly desires that come into the mind again the cross that brother brandom put in his car reason for it as a redbled male put in his car reason for it goes for all of us same thing and it's not just a a sexual lust it could be a lust for anything ungodly someone can be so driven for money their whole life is consumed and trying to be a millionaire their life can be so consumed with drugs that they spend their last penny on another fix it can be a lot more lusts that take over their lives than just something like that amen that consume a person's mind consume their mind let Christ consume your mind then he becomes everything fulfilling the desires of the Flesh of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others what does it do it doesn't create anything that's positive that's edifying that's righteous that's holy doesn't create anything in us that is good amen men we want that that's that of Christ that that is good to to be consumed in our members to be consumed in our lives let it take over your mind as the mind of Christ and yield to that as a walk of Faith as a walk of humility in faith amen obedience obedience to Christ the word amen let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen that mind is in you it'll cause you to do the exact same thing not go to Calvary amen or as we would say a physical Calvary to actually be crucified although some people try to emulate that don't know why absolutely contrary to the scripture he's already done it so we didn't have to do do it so why would you choose to do it but the life that he lived the life that he lived was to put others first you don't think Jesus knew that the words he was saying would would agitate the people that wanted him dead you don't think that Jesus the next time he healed a person he knew that it would INF Fury it would just infuriate more the people that wanted him dead but he didn't care because the people were in need and the whole point was to help them not himself even though it would put him in a worse place it would put him in a worse standard he did it anyway because the people needed help amen he did it so that we you and I would have life and life more abundant amen praise the Lord that's that's his goodness that's his grace that's his loving kindness praise the Lord but we have to let that mind be in us which was also in Christ Jesus amen I want to sing This Little Chorus before we're dismissed today we probably all know it I'm going to try to find it in here before I can tell anyway um praise the Lord I I don't remember the number but I know where it is in the book amen let's see 534 amen for he is Lord amen 534 for he is Lord let's sing it to him amen thank you Jesus amen so glad he is not just Lord

Lord he is he is Lord he is my Lord amen praise the Lord sorry uh about the lunch and thing um last Sunday um I talked to Craig and everything seemed to be a go but last Sunday when I was leaving uh out to go uh Jeff the maintenance got here was in the in the place next door and U we've gotten to be acquaintances so I see him I say hello and I saw him in there working I went in there and the whole place is just full of just stuff all the stuff that they had down on the end that one time they moved all that stuff over here now all that stuff's over here just desk chairs dividers uh missan is just all I mean there's barely an aisle to walk down the middle so it's not even remotely feasible uh to do it son's like well can we move the stuff no no we cannot uh don't know where we'd put it if we moved it it's just piled in there uh it's a little more organized than it used to be on the end down there because I saw it what it's down there I saw it what was back here and uh now it's over there the good thing maybe that'll keep him from renting that place so that's probably a good thing but the lunch in there is not going to work so what we're going to plan to do hopefully this week maybe even tomorrow we'll go down the office and uh we're going to give them deposit and everything we're going to try to have it at our church community area so hopefully that'll work they have a problem with that they like to have a couple of weeks notice uh so it may be a couple of weeks away I'll announce that or text you when we have something more firm on a date uh but right now we just it's it's just up the streets not far from here so it's close uh Sonia says she went and looked at it last week while I was work and she said it was uh uh it was a good place it was place to put food and places to sit so uh as long as it's going to work uh semantically physically to have everything then uh then if that is okay then we'll just we'll have that and uh do that probably in a couple weeks we won't do it this coming Sunday uh so maybe the next Sunday I'm not sure next week uh I'll be I will definitely be in Tucson next week because uh next week is my current manager actually they' switched teams over now but what the man that was my manager uh this week is going to be his last week so he's going to be in Tucson we're all going to be in Tucson to see him all so they're not he's not our upper manager is not going to be sending us anywhere else next week so I know I'll be here in Tucson next week so uh the next few Sundays are available uh for us to do something so uh I'll let you all know as soon as we have something firm set and uh that we can do that and and of course you know Sonia can communicate and let everybody know and uh what's bringing and that kind of stuff we have refrigerator to put things in if you need to that kind of thing so uh but just let you know I haven't forgotten it it just u i I just I I assumed this was the way it was when he left it uh before wide open with glass uh shelves so we could just put stuff on anyway so Lord willing in a couple weeks or so we'll try to have that so hopefully that works for everybody I just uh i h i just I have to set a date and I just pray everybody can come um if it's something you can I'm sorry but suay is it oh nice is that a bad time which would be nice for your family but maybe other people's fathers that's just what I'm thinking maybe anybody have a father mine's gone so I'm mine's gone to be with the Lord so she's going to be with me is a father huh is a father yeah um if if that's an issue let me know I know I know it's a congregation we have a very difficult time speaking up in church but if you don't want to speak up in church that's understandable it's okay uh just let me know if that if that day that's the 16th then at the 16th 16th then that would be um then that would constitute a problem if if that day is a problem for everybody if not we'll have to do it two weeks after that because next Sunday I I'll probably will be fing about out now if there's anything else you could always let me know privately text me or something or son you uh of what works best so that we can make sure we get the right Sunday that's going to work for because I as much as I want to need to just set a date and hopefully everybody can make it I I do want to try to make it where everybody can be there so so thank you that that that's pretty much all I had appreciate your prayers um my flights to Idaho were great back was great uh work week was great it was a very light week um just tinkering here and tinkering there and doing a few things here and there but we got everything we had to get done done before Friday we have probably been done a lot sooner if there had been so many things done wrong because we had to fix uh but uh everything went great so I appreciate the Lord's good and appreciate your prayer so so God bless you we'll be dismissed in a word of prayer my heart's mind's clear so just remember if there's something that works better for you just text me let me know or something and we we'll work it out God Jo would you just miss prayer yes thank you Jesus thank you thank you amen thank you Jesus yes Lord thank you Jesus amen amen amen Lord Rich bless you today
