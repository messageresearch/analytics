easter message no that's an everyday message praise the lord hallelujah god bless you today welcome to the house of lord welcome to those who may be streaming appreciate each one of you being here today let's stand to our feet if we could one more time we'll go to the word and read from the word of god now genesis chapter 18. amen is where i want to start reading today genesis chapter 18 just staying in the old testament lord's keeping us there in the old testament uh seems like for a couple months or so now uh but i just i try to go as he as i feel led so amen genesis chapter 18 we'll read a verse of scripture before we let you be seated but before we do let's fire our heads for another word of prayer father god we're indeed grateful again lord for your grace your mercy your blessings your love for all that you do for us and all that you've given to us thank you once again lord for a beautiful thanksgiving week lord and for a time father that we do reflect back and think about how good you've been to us and thank you so much for what you've done for us and lord the blessings that's in our lives lord and god for the grace and the mercy that we enjoy every day father as we come before you as we pray to you as we talk to you as we commune with you and fellowship with you lord on a daily basis lord just giving you glory praise and honor for you're so good to us you never leave or forsake us and god we're so thankful today for this time for this uh place lord and for these people that have come may your hand of mercy once again rest upon us we rebuke every demonic spirit lord that we try to hurt hinder and infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory the honor and the praise for all that is said and done we come lord not to hear from a man i know they didn't come to hear from any human lord nor did i we come to hear from you and expecting your word lord to once again come forth fresh father in power and manifestation of your spirit expecting that holy sweet anointing to come so powerful lord and just sweep through this place god and do supernaturally things god to each one of us here today that there won't be one person leave this building today but what their need has been met yes god we thank you lord for your word we thank you for the revelation of it for the message of the hour lord for all that you do for us god lord just bless these lord that have come today help those who weren't able to make it for whatever reason move upon those that are sick and body and needy father we're just believing today that your hand is upon all the requests and all the needs lord we just give you thanks and praise lord because we can have faith to believe that you said it lord we can't might not can put our finger on it we might not can scientifically or medically prove it but we know by faith god that it is a finished word yes and we just give you the glory for it now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen genesis 18 we'll read one verse and then we'll let you be seated that one verse verse 14 genesis 18 14. it says is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son amen you could be seated if you will amen if you haven't figured it out already by the scripture reading i just titled this today is anything too hard for the lord amen amen is anything too hard for the lord let's go back to uh uh the first verse of genesis 18. i want to read through this story and we'll touch on abraham and sarah for a little bit and background the understanding that we have through the word of god through the message and through the teachings that the lord has given us about this that god is coming to sarah to understand uh why that god would tell her amen god would tell abraham and sarah because these are god's words god said this as we read through this again you'll recognize god's the one that said this god is questioning them is anything too hard for me is anything too hard for the lord amen and that's the question that po is posed to us today because that that reality is the basis upon what our faith is based on if we believe that there's something too hard for the lord then our faith isn't going to rise to the place it needs to be to garner what we need from the lord but if we truly believe and know that god can do anything that god can do all things and that he does do all things and he is more than able to do anything whatever you would say ask abundantly beyond what we could ever think then our faith can rise to that place and that level to receive that amen amen we know god is already able i mean i i know i'm preaching to the choir here today but just something simple to encourage your faith today we know he's able we know he can't do anything but the point of it is our faith needs to reach that level our faith needs to go to where that is into that dimension and receive that for ourselves amen it's already there we know it already exists we know god has already done it we know god's already purchased it he's already done the plan that was needed to bring it to pass it's just us and our faith getting to the level to receive it amen amen just like he was doing to abraham and sarah here because this was going to be quite an outstanding thing that was going to happen to sarah sarah's 90 years old do you imagine thinking about giving getting a promise from god at 90 years old that you're gonna conceive and have a son right i mean even by those days standards that was outstanding uh so to be able to reach the level of faith that that was needed for that to take place it had to be something happened there with abraham and sarah and of course to get to that place where god can make it happen in their lives in the same thing today abraham and sarah weren't facing anything any different than we do today they were facing the same thing they were humans they had a free moral agency they had a soul body spirit they had things in the world going on around them and no doubt the way things are today may uh play more into weakening humans faith but still it needs to be reached to the place that god is because god hasn't changed amen everything around us has changed and humans have changed the people's shakes but god hasn't changed so to reach to that place where they reach to we got to do the same thing yes amen be the same faith reach to that same place now as we go back and read beginning of the first verse and the lord appeared unto him now we know of course let's just background before we start reading again just to refresh your memory uh we know that abraham had married sarah and his name was abram and herz was sarai or however you want to pronounce her name i've heard it pronounced several different ways we'll just say sarai because it ended with an eye so abram and sarah so he married sarah then god came to abram and said if you'll get yourself out from your fathers and your kindred i will make you a great nation and now notice abraham was 75 years old when god's giving him this promise the bible says he was 75 when he left out from his father's house so as he was 75 years old to receive this promise that god said i'm going to make you a great nation well how can you become a great nation if your wife is barren right right pretty hard to become a great nation when you can't have any children right but god promised him at a 75 year old man i'm going to make you abraham a great nation you get up out and leave your father's house and go into a land that i'll show you god didn't even say okay now go to grant and country club and i'll do this at the other no he said just go and i'll tell you where to go i'll show you where to go i'll give you the direction i'll lead you it's the way that you need to go it was a modern day gps right god was a modern day gps for abraham he was the global positioning system that we follow on our phones and everything today sometimes we get i think people be completely lost without them right but god was abraham's gps oh man you just go and i'll tell you where to go i'll tell you where to turn i'll tell you what land to go to i'll tell you where you need to end up i'll tell you where you need to uh occupy and that that that's what god and that was god's promise to abraham and i'll make you a great nation amen i promise you i'll make it this is my covenant to you i'll make you a great nation so abraham leaves he goes out but abraham stays barren all this time abraham or excuse me sarah stays barren this whole time no children they have relation husband and wife no children but god's promise didn't change because sarah didn't have any children you understand the promise of god did not change amen brother branham tells us that abraham's faith got stronger believing that the same god that promises the same god that's delivered and there's the same god that's taken care of is the same god that's going to produce this and make this promise come to pass america same god and the longer it goes the greater miracle it's going to be amen it's a miracle at 65 but what kind of a miracle is it going to be when she's 90. amen hallelujah or 100 or whatever it's going to be at that time abram didn't know right he just believed it he said god i'm just going to trust you but there's times you read through the story there's times you go from genesis 12 to genesis 18 19 20 or there's what we consider as humans to look at a lack in abraham's faith but i challenge you today to the fact that that's not the account that god had about abraham because god's account of abraham he tells us in romans and in hebrews and other places of the scripture that tell us of what god saw in abraham amen and god said he wavered not amen hallelujah that's what god said we look at it and we read the story you you go and read a 16-17 chapter it even says that abraham himself laughed within himself yeah that's right that's what the bible says abraham laughed within himself but god's account of abraham was that he staggered not right amen that's what matters doesn't matter the way we look at it doesn't matter the way we see it matters the way god sees it amen amen how god accounts it to our account how god sees it us and his own eyes that's what we need to think about worry about the most how god sees it so god or abraham even abram even laughed at himself but as the years went on the faith grew stronger as years went on abraham questioned even after god gave him the promise abram question god god what will you give me seeing i go childless well amen abram i've already told you i'm going to make you a great nation you've obeyed my word you followed what i told you i told you what i was going to do you did what i asked you to do now i'm going to do what i told you i would do amen period there is no question about it there is no backing up from it i told you this and it's going to happen but yeah abraham comes to god said well god what will you give me seeing i go childless i've already told someone to make you a great nation right right so he had to take him out and of course you know the thing where god puts asleep on him divides the animals and the birds and all in the the lamp comes down and and then god tells him and and has to change abraham's name or abram's name to abraham and sarah's name to sarah you know it was nice to have the name of of a father as abrams was but it was even greater for him to have the name of the father of many nations all right amen praise the lord it's one thing to be a father it's another thing to be a father of many nations god changed their name before the promised son to come to pass now the 18th chapter says this the lord appeared unto abram now this is after that all the promise god told him i'll do this i give this and of course the uh the the the uh the the what do you call it the the the side act a side shoot of ishmael coming forth sarah goes uh to hagar her handmaiden that they had gotten out of egypt and said now uh you go unto my lord and and have pleasure with him and and you can have a child by him right amen that that will be from his lawns see but i want you to understand something yes you look in the bible and you see where god calls these men to do these specific things and to create these uh these lineages but if you notice god also calls the woman amen god doesn't just call the man god also calls the woman and god did not call hagar that's right god did not call any of his concubines or anybody else right god called sarah for abraham amen god called sarah to be a part of that promise god called her to produce that promise her and her only and it was the production or the producing of abraham and sarah that come together to produce isaac and then nothing else was going to work nothing else was going to do of course the ishmael came forth from from hagar and it was from abraham's laws but it wasn't the promised child amen in fact god said i will make ishmael a great nation because of your asking me abraham but he is not the promised child so much so that when it come time to offer isaac as a sacrifice and type of jesus christ god told abraham to take your son singular your only son is singular god didn't even acknowledge ishmael right right he only acknowledged dicey because that was the promised god that uh the promise of god that was the lineage that god was bringing forth to make of him great nations not just nations but great nations amen not just multitudes of people but multitudes of god-loving god-fearing great nations amen praise the lord that's god's promise god was going to bring that promise to pass god did bring it to pass now after all that god comes into the door of abraham's tent abraham looks up and he sees them coming and he goes running let's just let's just read it see because because see god's getting ready to do something else god's already changed their name to abraham and sarah okay so that that's already been done that's the promise god gave them of what he was going to do now he gives that again as a reassurance to abraham as you'll notice we read but the purpose of course like brother branham said that that that god had to going to abraham here on this occasion was that god in himself was shall i hide what i'm about to do to sodom and gomorrah this great thing that's about to take place shall i hide it from my prophet shall i hide it from my servant the man of god that i have here on earth right now shall i hide this great event from him and of course absolutely not god said no no he can't hide this from his prophet he can't hide this from his man of god so he's going to go down and tell him this is what i'm about to do abraham after everything else that goes through we won't read that part but god is coming to tell abraham what he's about to do to sodom and gomorrah and of course the two angels go down there and get lot and his family out first right because lot and his family had to get out of there first before god could bring down the fire and brimstone but now the lord appeared 18th verse first for 18th chapter first first the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and he said my lord amen singular he wasn't acknowledging the other two he was only acknowledging the elohim whom he had acknowledged and seen before this melchizedek without father and mother that that abraham had paid tithe to that had met him after the victory of the slaughter of the kings amen this was the same one and he said my lord now the other two of course brother brahm talks about gabriel michael a couple angels he blows them dust and they step into and they come forth to abraham but abraham is only acknowledging the one my lord amen my lord if now i have found favor and thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts that ye shall that that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant as they said so do as thou has said now god said that go and do as you said now that that's the way it should be every time god passes our way amen every time god passes our way now you know job said he passes right by me and i perceive him not uh he comes in the lightning he comes in the thunder he comes and the the whirlwinds and all the great things but you know just in the quiet and secret places he just in in the subtle ways that god comes by there should always be a welcoming there should always be the lord let us set out the table before you lord let us get the very best that we've got and give it to you lord may we have everything that we do be exactly perfect so that you will be pleased with our offering that we offer you today and please don't leave right away stay a little bit amen just stay a little bit lord let's just have a little communion let's just have a little fellowship lord let's talk just for a few minutes could you spare a few minutes he lives in eternity friend don't you think he can spare a few minutes to talk to his children amen just a little bit god just just stay a little bit i'll make just welcoming and wash his feet amen make sure he feels welcome don't just invite him there's a lot of places a lot of churches a lot of people invite him but he'll come and they don't make him feel welcome right and they come and he comes he might even come and be there in their event but he sets over in the corner of jesus with dirty feet right they don't make him feel welcome right abraham made him feel welcome he washed his feet and he fed him look how fresh this meal is no look at this abraham hastened to the tiana de tierra and to sarah and said make ready three measures uh quickly ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tendering good and gave it unto the young man and haste to dress it you talk about a fresh meal right i don't know if you've ever gone out to eat or if you go go out after church or something i doubt very seriously that when you set down for your meal there's a guy in the back running out to go get the calf to dressing to give you that meat that that five minutes ago was grazing in the pasture this is some fresh meat friend this is a fresh meal that that abraham has chosen the very best to give to god this is pretty fresh i think we have some uh sometimes a meal we think is very fresh but i tell you it doesn't get any better than this yes amen he ran out and got it gave it to the young man hastened to dress it took butter and milk and the calf and he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said this is he now this is the fellowship god's pleased right god's been made welcomed he's sitting down he's feeling comfortable he's been fed his feet have been washed there's a nice atmosphere amen and that's what that's what we create in church that's that's the whole point we have a song service and we try to create an atmosphere so we try to make him welcome and wash his feet and make him feel welcome and comfortable and and we're here together and we feel comfortable together and we feel that spirit we feel that anointing sweeping through the congregation and and we feel how god's moving upon each soul and upon each heart and he begins to minister to us and speak to us and and individually amen and just and this just begin to talk to us and that's where god is at now with abraham he said where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tenth door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women so people may say well sarah wasn't that old for those days she was only 90 when people were living 200 and 300 years old but once you see what the bible says the bible says she was past that time right he said well 90 wasn't that old for those days but the bible says she was past that time of age right that's what the bible says so if the bible says that that's what i'm going to believe yeah 90 was old even then for someone a woman to conceive and to bear a child right man she was of old stricken in age and it ceased to be with her as the manner of women amen bearing children therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure with my lord being old also now i want you know abraham laughed when god told him that now sarah's laughing both of them in their heart you know the bible says abraham laughed within himself amen and said within himself how could we do this being old people now now sarah's doing the same thing sarah is laughing with her within herself and and she said shall i surely bear a child which am old um there laughs within herself let's go back 12 for saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure with my lord all being also old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i but surely bear a child with him old is anything too hard for the lord amen is anything too hard for the lord so that's the question today that's the question that our faith needs to reach that's the question that we need to find within ourselves to understand no matter what situation you're in no matter what physical condition you're in no matter what's going on in your life no matter what misdirection or misguided or whatever whatever it is is there anything too hard for god amen that's the question you have to answer in your own self right is there anything too hard for god and don't try to put it off to say well maybe it's this or maybe it's that don't god can do anything that our faith can reach to right amen yes anything amen if we can have faith to move a mountain and take mount lemon and put it in the pacific ocean then there's nothing that god would withhold from his children right amen god can do anything amen amen praise the lord is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son no question about it great now i want you to see the difference between abraham and sarah abraham laughed in himself and said how could we do this but acknowledged god after he left right but now what did sarah do sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh sarah lied to god abraham did not rhema they both laughed and they and but abraham acknowledged what he had done and god explained to him what he was going to do sarah lied to god and brother branham said god would have destroyed her right there if she had not been a part of that promise amen if she had not been a part of abraham part of that promise just like eve in the garden of eden just like the woman amen she wasn't eve at the time she didn't become eve until she was pregnant with twins right amen amen because that's when she became the mother of all living right but then she was the woman god would have destroyed her if adam had gone down and take her into himself and became a part of the curse amen just like jesus came down and embraced you and became a part of the curse actually literally going to hell but praise god when he got there he took the keys of the kingdom and emptied out paradise and set it up on high and gave captivity kevin uh led captivity kevin gave give son to men amen amen praise the lord now sits at the right hand with the book in his hand ready to claim that that belongs to him right america praise the lord praise god but now abraham brother man said god would have destroyed sarah for lying in the face of god amen and she was a part of the promise and he couldn't take her without hurting abraham amen without uh uh negating the promise that god had already given abraham because the promise wasn't for any other woman again wasn't for hagar it was for sarah amen amen praise the lord it was only for sarah amen she denied said uh not because she was afraid amen amen i mean that that that's a legitimate human emotion and we shouldn't we shouldn't be afraid but we are sometimes that's right amen whether we want to acknowledge it or not we are at times there's times that we are that we become afraid amen as young children and afraid of the dark as older people whatever things it is it's different for different people a lot of times it's dictated your fear a lot of times is dictated by your upbringing right how you're raised in the home that you grew up in a lot of times because those things carry on in your spirit to your adulthood right and your adulthood and it affects you that way so you know people can say i never get afraid people you know it's a legitimate human emotion she actually was exercising a legitimate human emotion because she was afraid there she said nate but god said but now you d you did laugh you did laugh it was in your heart but you did laugh see god discerning the thoughts in her heart in the tent behind him right that's right amen that's when a prophet of god in this day could turn his back to a congregation and call out this one and that one and say this is what you this is where you're from this is your name this what's wrong with you and all the with in the ten now he said now you see your last sign amen amen before the destruction of sodom and gomorrah god turned his back to the tent amen and discerned what was in sarah's heart right in this last day a prophet of god sent by god turned his back to a congregation and said called out people and said now you're seeing your last sign what is left friend the destruction of this satan's east yes amen we're facing the the the resurrection of our children of our of our families i say children because of our son i guess but it could be any of us or families the resurrection of our families that we'll see before us in a minimum of 30 days we'll be gone amen because there's a body change that's about to take place a body change that's about to happen to a to a group of people around the world there's a body change that's about to take place that this bride is in the moment and twinkling of an eye going to take on the moment and twinkling of an eye you you think what kind of faith that that's going to take but now my question is as we change this here today and let's leave abraham and sarah now uh you go back in hebrews and i had hebrews i was going to read here and how uh um well we got a minute let's just read it real quick uh hebrews 11. and we'll we'll just change this over hebrews 11 11 says through faith even though she laughed god's account in the hebrews 11 11 through faith god calls her faithful praise the lord through faith sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen god taking abraham and sarah and changing them back to a young man and young woman again receiving strength receiving because see her woman dead her milk veins dried up she wasn't she was beyond the place of receiving seed she was beyond the place of having a child she was beyond the place of having uh to be able to be able to feed the child all this had ceased with sarah so sarah had to receive something you say uh brother branham and and i'll just be honest with you i have heard and know people in this message that don't believe it when brother branham said they were turned back to young one young man and young woman again i believe it amen amen i believe it i believe him as a prophet of god i believe him as the vindicated word prophet for this day that i know was wrong a dramatization but i also know it was a type and it was a type of what the bride is facing today it's a bright it's a it's a type of what this bride is about to go through right now i believe very short order this bride is going to be facing the exact same thing yes it says she receives strength but she received so much strength you said well her body was strengthened but she received so much strength that she was a beautiful woman again because when her and abraham went down to the career of benellect the king of guerrero wanted her as a wife oh man hallelujah you mean a 90 year old grandma well she wasn't grandma she had no kids but a 90 year old woman now wanting to be desired of a king that probably could have had any woman in his kingdom he wanted that's right any woman that came into their kingdom he could have had it if he wanted her but he chose sarah a 90 year old woman who was past the age of bearing yeah right no sorry friend that doesn't work that way so what she just received strength no she received a body change right now she received something that made her desirable to the king of the country amen amen and it wasn't just because she uh was uh a female because like i said he could have had any woman he went as the king of the he's the king of grier could i didn't he want anyone amen but he chose sarah right of all the others he had don't tell me people say well i don't believe that well you can believe what you want friend but i believe what the word said right amen and it says that she was so desirable god had changed her body so much she became desirable to that king right right god had to come to abimelech and tonight and say you better not touch that woman oh man that's right well he said she was his sister yeah i know you did this the integrity of heart but if you don't take that woman back to his uh her husband you're gonna die right you and everything that's around you is gonna die if you don't you don't even touch her you take her back so he lied to me it don't matter right your great prophet lied and you're okay with that that's not the point my promise doesn't change because he lied to you right amen my promise doesn't change just because he lied to you praise god you better let that take that woman and bring him back to and have him pray for you you mean that liar is going to pray for me yep you better have him pray for you because if you don't if he doesn't pray for you you're a goner right amen amen that's praise the lord that that that's god's word amen turn back to a man to a a man and woman enough to be able to conceive to bear and to have a child a son and raise isaac to the place that that he would be the lineage of abraham amen receive seed she believed it she had faith he believed it he had faith their faith reached to that place amen their faith reached that place is anything too hard for god their faith reached to that place and they and they conceived and bear a son the promise of god could come forth because of their faith amen they got the they got all hebrews the eleventh chapter the faith chapter all the way from the eighth first down that's the eighth first to the 19th verse it's about abraham and sarah amen the faith to be able to bring the promise to pass and how many other promises of god how many other promises in this bible do we have our faith is what it takes to bring it to pass our faith is where we have to reach to to make it happen in our lives amen our faith just like theirs it had to be the same place at the same time so yeah fear is a real emotion but faith always conquers fear amen i'm in you hear me today faith always conquers fear yes always always has always will amen amen now in that great event the great faith that that that that this bride today has got to have to bring this great event to take place let's go to uh ephesians and i want to transition from genesis to ephesians ephesians chapter 4. there's a word in ephesians 4 that means the same thing as genesis 18 14. it's that time of life the time of life there's that time of life you can say it and believe it in many different ways facets whoever you are this bride for the last time for this last days there's a fulfillment there's a there's a ending of times and it's not necessarily time itself but a specific time element because as god told abraham and sarah according to her time of life according to the time of life that god had predestined god was going to visit them god was going to bring them together she was going to conceive seed there's going to be a time there's got to be a time according to the time of life that they reached this place see amen and a lot of it my opinion a lot of it had to do with the faith that they had that that it reached to that place to produce that seed amen amen you remember brother animals had this girl in the prayer line and she came up and he asked her do you have faith she says oh yes brother brandon i believe and he said just go sit down over here just a little bit watch the prayer line for a little while that's right because he knew she didn't have the face she needed to reach what she was looking for right go sit over there and then come back said oh i believe now he said just just go sit down just a little bit longer amen and eventually as her faith grew and then she began to watch and she began to see god unfold himself before and her faith raised to a place he had her come up prayed for and god gave her what she was looking at amen amen it was that time i mean it may have taken a little more time some people that's just one example with others may take even more time it was 25 years from the time god told abraham that you're going to be a great nation i'm going to make you a great nation it was 25 years before the sun ever came before god ever changed their name from abram to abraham sarah to sarah is 25 years could you imagine the promise to say god's gonna do this yeah but when doesn't matter when amen he didn't say when god didn't say when it doesn't matter when that's not significant all that matters is that you believe that it's going to happen amen god is going to do it period and just hold on to that i mean hold don't let it go hold on to that but there's a promise that god has given us first thessalonians 4 that the dead in christ shall ride first and those which alive and remain will be caught up to meet the lord in the air amen there is going to be a catching away there is going to be a rapture there is going to be a body change for the alive and rain in this last day amen there's going to be a body change the moment twinkling of an eye there's going to be a change that takes place now ephesians 4 i had your turn there let's go to the 10th verse ephesians 4 10. he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now what was the purpose of this five-fold ministry why did god give some upon this earth to be evangelists and pastors and teachers why did god give that what is the point amen because there's a reason we're not just up here to flap our gums we're not up here to build some great kingdoms we don't do this for uh wealth or fame amen we do this because there's a biblical reference and purpose by why god gives men gifts and why he's made some pastors and he's made some evangelists and he's made some teachers and apostles and so forth there's a reason why he did that amen he did it for the perfecting of the saints amen amen he did it for the perfecting of the saints and that word perfecting is the same word if you go back to matthew 5 48 it's the same word where it talks about that perfect is being of full age mature to a place of higher stature higher learning in the spirit of god you're a mature christian you don't let just every little doctrine come along and blow you all over the place you don't let every little thing upset you you don't get down in every little thing that happens in life or what somebody might say to you or how somebody might treat you you don't let those things ruffle your feathers you just move over and press the wave and keep on going in the lord i mean and that's all that matters yes you keep pressing the battle that's a mature christian that's someone that's a full age that's someone that god looks and says that is perfect i mean that's what god's talking about that ministry is to bring the word of god to bring perfection to a bride of christ to bring perfection of maturity to a group of people and we know that romans tells us that faith comes by hearing and hearing what the word of god not the word of man it's not the word of man that does it it's not the hibernation of god's word by god by uh uh the man that makes it it's the word of god that brings the faith amen the word of god only the word of god amen not hybrid not my not my or your opinion or thought about it what does god say amen what does god's word say what does god's message say what did god tell us in this present-day truth amen keep going for the work of the ministry for the edifying the building up of the body of christ we nor anyone now the the ministry is not here to tear down right unfortunately in some cases there's those that take pleasure and tearing down right right and tearing other people's hopes and lives and feelings and faith down that's not why we're here amen when i hear there's correction that goes forth i'm not saying that that's not that's absolutely corrections necessary absolutely but it should not be to the point that it tears someone's spirit or unchristianizes somewhere amen because that's not what we're here for the ministry is here to build up the body of christ to lift you up encourage you to give you the word of god the pure word by faith to bring you to a place of faith that you can receive what god has for you amen your life now in the future to a rapture everything that you need those that are dead in christ they had to have the same faith amen you said well they're dead they're automatically going to raise no not if they weren't there when they died they had to be there first before they went on amen but let me tell you this alive and remain group of this last day god's narrowing her down yeah she's getting smaller and smaller my opinion that enliven remain group that will actually feel that body change it'll take place in the moment twinkling of an eye it's going to be a small group look those that are already gone on they've already received their new body right they've already received a body change they've already experienced that they have it they know what it's about when they raise they'll be in that body but it's us it's those that are alive and remain i say uh says and i believe we'll be partakers of it and there may be some of us that go by the group i don't know that's god's choice yes but i believe there will be a group that will be those that arrive and remain that will receive that body change amen just like abraham and sarah they'll be turned back young man young woman they'll see their loved ones and god will take them home and will all and the dead in christ arise we'll all get together internationally amen internationally not just in tucson or in the united states around the world will be gathered on the auspice of the shed blood of christ this word of god and we'll all go to meet him in the air amen amen but there's got to be something take place first amen amen we're to edify this body is to be edified not torn down not ridiculed made fun of beat down and too many defeated and beat down sheep now as it is this body is to be edified lifted up encouraged strengthened amen the body of christ now why till we all come in the unity of the faith and there it is unity yes a unity of the faith what is this unity it's not just this church this city this state this country around the world god has men and women god has children born again sons and daughters of god all around the world that come together under this exact same scripture the unity of faith a unity of rapturing faith we will all have it i amen we may differ on a little thing here or there but we will all have a unity of the faith amen a unity of the faith that's what will bring us together and that's what will take us out of this world yes a unity of faith we all come together in that unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ of course that perfect that statue of a perfect man brother was talking about in second peter 1 that we henceforth be no more children why we're we're adults amen we've been edified we we've we've grown we've we've come to a place of perfection because so we're not children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cutting craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part may get the increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love bringing a body change what brought a body change to abraham and sarah well according to the scripture it was their faith yes he received god's promise by faith believed it she received strength and received seed to produce the promised son by faith they both believed it by faith they believed that their bodies were going to be able to produce the promise of god now how many of us have the faith to believe that we have the ability by our faith to produce this last day promise of god a body change amen amen you say well it's going to be it's going to be great faith when our loved ones begin to appear well i'm telling you friend if you're not there you're your loved ones aren't because you're not going to see them that's right right you've got to be there first you're saying oh well you know a ranked center sees this and says all of a sudden they're a christian it doesn't work that way right amen it's like saying uh well you know um i don't pray and i don't read my bible and i'm not a christian i don't do the things of god and then and then when the situation comes and arises and they say oh god help me where's god amen right where is he amen well their faith is not there to meet that challenge right right now they blame god for it because they said well i asked god yeah and how did you ask him right where were you at the time you asked him what was your spiritual uh of uh life at at that time amen you don't you don't have the faith to reach that place ah man you gotta have the faith when when the challenge comes you gotta have what it takes to meet the challenge that's right and that meeting the challenge doesn't just happen because you sit around and do nothing it happens because you're pr preparing yourself i i don't i don't know anything about boxing i don't even know who a boxer is anymore i guess back in my day is maybe uh cassius clay or maybe even sugar ray litter but you know back in that day if if he was in his heyday now if i were to just go say hey you know what let's have a boxing match together i can beat you and you just go home and sit down you wait for the time to come around you walk in the you walk in the rink and you get bam and you're gone you haven't done anything to meet the challenge anybody ever done anything to train you never done anything to get yourself prepared to meet this great boxer this man who's the champion of the world in fact you probably we probably anybody that didn't train could go find the weakest boxer there is on the planet and still get your bell wrong that's right you haven't done anything right and people they blame god for it it's not god's fault right amen what are we doing what am i doing what is this that gods give he he's give us everything that we need amen to bring us to a unity of faith a unity of faith to believe nothing is impossible with god amen nothing is impossible god is already produced and made away for us a couple of scriptures here i want to read to you as we finish this because see that that body change is simply a healing right that really is pretty much all it is it's just a healing it's just something that takes place in your body that brings it back from a condition that's lower than what it should be back to a place where it should be amen you know brother graham talked about that 19 20 21 years old was yet to prime a life and uh you know anymore i mean especially as a man you're just as dumb as a bag of rocks you know 21 year old doesn't know nothing 20 years old i mean you know the reasoning part of your brain hasn't even fully developed yet that's why so many 20 20 you know guys especially do stupid stuff right that's right apparently some of it never does change or never does grow together so there are just still stupid but that's beyond the point but the point is that was the problem of life 19 20 21 that's why we're going back to that age again we get on the other side we go back to that age again just like we were in the prom of life just like it was supposed to be in the beginning that's that body change i said healing that's that taking it back well you know brother adam said of course that's the earnest of the resurrection even that body change that's the earnest of the resurrection that divine healing that's the earnest of the resurrection we had a lot of prayer requests today we're looking for divine healing for many people's lives maybe for your life today we may be looking for that divine healing brother graham said if there's no divine healing then there's no resurrection right amen that's the earnest of the resurrection that's what we look to that's what brings this body into subjection to the promise of god's word your faith brings it your faith is what brings that promise down changes that body that's why brother branham said how can we expect a rapture to take place we don't have enough faith to heal a headache tuesday right right amen yes because that's just a stepping stone to what it will take for to bring about the faith for this body change amen comes through hearing and hearing the word of god amen that's why so many people are going to be ill-equipped for this body change because they're listening to the word of man instead of the word of god amen they're listening to hybridism they're taking the scripture but they're adding their own thoughts interpretations dogma to it amen but it's got to be the pure unadulterated word of god amen that brings this promise to pass philippians chapter 3 verse 20 says for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile bodies that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself change these vile bodies amen these vile bodies a man changed praise the lord amen and in a moment the twinkling of an eye am i praise the lord it's going to change and bring and bring to pass the promise of god's word amen one more scripture in jeremiah chapter 32 jeremiah chapter 32 verse 16. now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto barack the son of nera i prayed unto the lord saying all lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee amen amen amen there is nothing too hard for thee great prayer let's drop down i was going to read all the way through but let's just drop down 26th verse then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there anything too hard for me amen amen now my question again today is our faith got to that place is our faith is the place that we can believe we know absolutely we don't guess we don't presume we know that there's nothing too hard for god amen whatever you have need of today amen whatever you're looking for from god what are these prayer requests that brother zach read the things that were upon your heart the unspoken requests the testimonies all that god is doing we know there's nothing too hard from him amen amen if you're listening in today the faith to believe that god has already met the need god has already met that requirement based on your faith yes if we hold up to that and know that god's already done it then what else is there to look to it's the fulfillment of god's promise yes we're looking for a body change abraham and sarah received it by faith this bride shall receive it by unity of faith the faith that comes by hearing the word through a five-fold ministry that god has prepared and brought to us for this last day especially for this last day amen because this is the time we're looking to yes this is the time we've been longing for amen and there's and there's other needs even before that there's there's situations again in our congregation with people we know with us here personally that we're expecting god to do a great mighty word amen amen amen looking for god to do a great mighty work today there's something in your life today something in your heart something maybe unspoken spoken whatever written down that you're looking to god for today a miracle a divine healing whatever it is that you're expecting god is more than able to bring that yes he's gonna do a body change friend that temporary body change to happen right now amen bring it back to a place of perfection with you amen amen with you yes thank you lord i'm gonna do something i very very rarely ever do and you know me in fact i don't know i've ever done it in almost in four and a half years of having the church but if you have a need of prayer today and there's something in your life or something you're looking for from god today i want you come up and we're gonna have prayer whoever you want if you have something so you don't have to it's not obligation but if there's something that you need today i just felt led to do this i was talking to the lord this morning and just felt led that if there's something that you have that you're looking for that you need from god today and you want to come up and have hands laid on and pray for you then i'll be happy to pray for you amen and not just me i will all pray together yes amen may just be my hands or others may come
