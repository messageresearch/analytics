snow amen praise the lord read through red makes it white cleanse clean amen undefiled praise the lord jesus amen we'll go to the lord in prayer now amen and take upon your prayer requests anyone might have i have a couple here that i need to bring to your attention i got a text early this morning from uh brother dennis that um with the weather and all it always uh affects uh his joints mostly his back knees but this morning he's had a lot of pain in his back uh with the weather barometric pressure changes and all it really hurts his back desperately bad so uh he's at home streaming today he also asked prayer for his wife leah she had a difficult week with the depression anxiety but said that the lord touched her towards the end of the week so she is doing better but wanted us to pray for her and uh that situation as well just praying for the lord's complete deliverance for both of them amen there's no reason i understand our bodies get old and they react to things and things of nature and but there's no reason a child of god needs to put up with just because the barometric pressure changes it affects or hurts our bodies amen i believe the lord is more than able to touch and heal and take this from our precious brother also uh brother danny woke up this morning and said that he'd woke up with a bad headache and congestion so he asked us to pray for him as well so let's pray for brother danny the pats brother pat also texted me this morning and then had another water pipe broken so their ops is in the ditch this morning so they're not able to be with us so please pray it seems to be happening fairly prolific prolifically with them now that they're they this is the third or fourth time the pipes of their house have burst so um i don't know if it's older and house is older pipes are older so i don't know if that pressure's just finding the weak spots that it can find and it just springs a leak and then they have a mess under the house so uh just pre please pray for them the lord would just help him to be able to get it fixed cheap or himself if able to and and just share up the rest of them so this doesn't happen anymore like i said this three or four times hasn't kept them out of church until today but they've had this happen three or four times over the past few months so i just pray that the lord would just move on that and they won't have this problem anymore uh got a couple requests from sister norma one she had written down here about sister dorothy we had sis prayer for sister dorothy last week those you may not know um she lives in the white mountains in sholo she's the mother of sister carol carpenter ron and carol up in the white mountains and she's just a precious sister who had contracted cobot but sister norma writes that her potassium level was low and the doctor ordered potassium uh and i guess she had been taking it so she was stronger yesterday she's still weak but sister carol feels the disease is behind her and thanks everyone for praying for her amen so i appreciate the prayers but we do want to continue to remember sister dorothy in prayer also sister norma excuse me i forget some of the details on the other she sent me a text this morning pardon me for reading this but she said please pray for my this is from also from sister norma please pray for my granddaughter's grandpa clark he is 86 and they found he has colon cancer he will have surgery this week to remove it amen so called early enough colon cancer is quite treatable but we'll just pray for clark this morning that the lord would just touch him also she sent a request from sister judy arnold that i guess a lady friend of hers uh malia farlar i hope i'm pronouncing that right if you're watching sister judy i'm sorry the lord knows her though that's the main thing uh malia farlar she will have open heart surgery tuesday amen so let's remember that request also in prayer amen also michael put in a prayer request here um for a co-worker of his over the past few months i've spoken to one of my co-workers tina about how i was raised and that i go to church she makes com positive comments like i wished i had raised my daughters better going to church and believing in god last week they found out her husband chris has been diagnosed with colon cancer another colon cancer and has crohn's disease and has had crohn's disease most of his life so i asked her if she wanted me to bring her husband before the church for prayer today and she said yes i would ask that this event could be used as a witness to the power of the prayer of faith and that tina and her family will turn to god amen his name is chris munten m-u-n-t-o-n uh that's her husband's name amen so remember that request a prayer as well amen satan is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour amen but thank god we god has given us something to overcome the wiles of the enemy amen praise the lord have an unspoken request on your heart today amen the lord knows all our hearts let's stand to our feet if we could appreciate each one being here today lord richly bless you as i said uh not so much in a hurry today anymore my flight was uh delayed to 4 45 so i don't have to be the airport to like 3 30 or so so we're gonna have church either way we'll have church anyway amen so we'll remember these questions of prayer brother angel would

the lord jesus amen anybody have a quick testimony on your heart today sister priscilla um my brother-in-law marcos he went into the hospital a couple of days ago or last week he had another heart attack and um the doctor said he probably wasn't going to make it um through his surgery because he had to have surgery in his heart again i think this is like probably the 10th heart attack he's had and he said that um when you have this heart attack that the lord spoke to him and told him that he that he was going to be going home soon but he wasn't going to go home now and so he woke him up after his surgery so he's been calling and he's like i want to come back to church and he wants to be baptized he's just been really ill but he's home now um he went home last night and they actually moved into a new apartment a better apartment where he doesn't have to go upstairs to use the restroom because he you know his leg is gone so um he's just really like on fire for the murder now and he's um uh the lord has really touched him amen praise the lord wonderful amen praise the lord god is good amen it's good to see him here amen and just trust the lord has his hand on him good to see him back he's able to come yes amen let's all stand to our feet if we could and we're going to turn in the scripture to revelations chapter 12. revelation chapter 12 revelations chapter 12 we're going to read a few verses of scripture here starting with the seventh verse so many times i forget to turn that back on apologies my voice is usually loud enough for you all to hear but it didn't necessarily loud enough to catch on the streaming so um try to make sure everybody can listen even if they weren't able to be here so in revelation chapter 12 we're going to begin reading with verse 7 but before we do let's just just about his forward prayer precious jesus father again it's privileged to be here lord and thank you again for meeting with us father thank you for the songs that were sung lord the spirit we felt so far and knowing lord that you are faithful and just and what you do for us every day god is is more than we could even give you in a thousand lifetimes praise and thanks for but we want to thank you again lord and recognize and let you know how much we thank you for the health and strength and life you've given us lord for watching over us and blessing us and lord your bride internationally and all that you do in every way god we are insufficient to this task but we're thankful god that you always are there with us because greater is he that is in us than he that is in this world we know lord that you lead us and guide us according to the paths that you'd have us to go and whatever your purpose and will is in all of our lives we relinquish ourselves to you lord and for the remaining part of this service trust and pray god that your hand would be upon it as you would speak to us from your word lord may you anoint the speaker these lips today god and every one of our ears to hear and accomplish that that you have sent forth for god because we know your word will not return void the lord accomplish in each one of us what your purpose is what your desire is for it to be and for us today we give ourselves into your hands and ask your blessings upon it move upon those that are here those who may not have been able to make it or may be streaming today lord according to your for your glory and honor god all is done we give you thanks and praise for it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen revelation chapter 12 we're going to begin reading with verse 7 and there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the world the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brother brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they loved not their lives to death unto the dead therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time amen you can be seated if you like and we want to take a text of scripture from here if we could amen god bless james good to see you friends amen glad to have you today to have each one of you and we want to take a text there's so many texts from here that uh that i want to take but the lord gave me something a few weeks ago a couple months ago whatever it was that i wanted to bring to you today and uh it has to deal with and i with let's see which it was uh the tenth verse it says the the accuser of our brethren but i wanted to title this because the thought that came on my mind before i actually got the scripture was the accuser of the innocent amen so that's what the title is going to be today this scripture this message is the accuser of the innocent praise the lord now we know that the scripture says here he is the accuser of the brethren but i want us to put into perspective the thought of the innocence of the ones that he is accusing because the thing to get across today and understand is just because there have been accusations laid does not mean that that person is guilty amen amen just because there are accusations doesn't mean that there is guilt because many times and of course by the spirit of the enemy there can be accusations laid about god's children and about god's people that is not true amen that the devil does now obviously there are things that are right and true and things that should not happen and things that should not be happening but the accuser we understand today is not your brother or sister the accuser today is not the church next door the accuser today is the devil there's only one accuser and that's satan now let's go back to the scripture and look here because there's so many little nuances in the description so many things that uh come out then that stick out to us to to see here especially for this last day that we live now seventh verse there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and uh fought in his angels so we recognize here that satan is not alone satan does not do his bidding by himself he does have what we consider her called or scripture calls fallen angels those that were angels of the creation of god from the beginning that to believe the tale of the devil that believed what he said and followed him and his ways so those not only was satan cast down upon the earth at this time but also all of the angels that he had deceived which was the third of the angels in heaven he deceived of all the angels in heaven that were cast out with him so he's not alone in this bidding satan doesn't do this by himself now of course he is the orchestrator of all of it he is the originator of all of it he is the father and the uh and the beginner of this but all that comes forth isn't just him doing it he has angels he has minions he has demonic spirits that are all around the world that are doing the very thing that he wants them to do and that's to bring destruction into your life now a lot of times the accusations that come as we see here this uh this dragon that has his followers uh these accusations that come are many times things that uh that are that are things that are of the guilty uh because an accuser usually has a motive an accuser i'll just say a false accuser because that's what the scripture says about it and that's basically the point i want to get to is false accusation not real accusation but false accusation and false accusation even based on the blood of jesus christ amen amen you know that the blood of jesus christ will have absolved you from something if you repent god's forgiven you and has been washed in the blood it's in god's seeing forgiveness it never is accounted to you anymore justified as though you've never done it in the first place so when the accuser comes to accuse you of something that christ has put in the sea of forgetfulness you are innocent you didn't do it you're not guilty of it he can accuse you of it he can dig up something from your past he can try to make remind you of something or somebody else but the truth of it is if it's under the blood of jesus christ it does not exist in the mind of god so when the accuser comes before god and tries to accuse you of that he looks down and he says that you're guiltless you're innocent you never did it amen that's the beauty of the blood of christ that's the beauty of the accuser of the innocent the innocent now the innocent may be you never did it it never happened the innocence may be that yeah you did do it but the blood of jesus christ annihilates it you've never done it in the first place in the mind of god either way you're innocent you've never done it because the one that we're more concerned about whether uh we are found guilty of it uh or held accountable to us is not necessarily one another but it's to god i want to be innocent in god's eyes that's the that's the first place the first thing that matters to me is being innocent in god's eyes people can accuse me of all kinds of things and friends as you know as a human mortal i've done all kinds of things wrong i've done all kinds of things the devil can accuse me of i've done all kinds of things probably even this week or said or thought things that the devil could accuse me of but when god put them in the sea of forgetfulness they cannot be held against me i didn't do it i'm innocent of it so when satan comes to try to accuse you god looks and says i don't see anything they're guiltless but that's to those who are of course those that are born again filled with the holy spirit the blood of jesus christ that annihilates all the sin the sin doesn't exist is never there to begin with in the mind of god so satan cannot accuse you of it he can go to your brother he could go to your sister he could go to some a neighbor or somebody else and accuse you all day long and that person may remember that you did that thing and they may be able to forgive you but god didn't just forgive you he forgot it doesn't even exist praise the lord now look satan has his angel satan has those demonic spirits that do his bidding around the world today we know that in any willing subject that any one of these spirits can get into that person can become a willing subject and possess to those spirits now sometimes those spirits are extreme like we have when jesus uh walked out in the in the city of uh uh their desiring or nazareth i forget the name of the city and jesus stepped out and this man here is possessed of many devils devils a legion he called it legion which is many multiple and that demon saw jesus come off the boat and he said jesus son of god what have you to do with us you've come to torment us before our time if you're going to cast us out of this man cast us into those swine and jesus just looked at him and said go that's all he said according to i believe it was matthew's account he just jesus said one two-letter word everything else all the all the pronunciation all the the declaration of their their demise and what was going to happen to them and who they were what they were there for they did it themselves they they proclaimed all of this themselves and they just said jesus if you're gonna cast us out cast us into the swan and jesus just said go that's all he had to do one two letter word send all that leads to the devils out of that man and into that swine this wine course ran down the hill into the sea and they all died but spirits don't die the pigs died but the spirits don't die the spirits just find another willing subject to go to amen and those spirits continue to move around the world today finding willing subjects finding those that are unprotected by the blood of christ those that don't have the holy ghost and he finds those people to work in and one of the first and foremost things that those spirits try to do outside of destroy the world which they're doing a very good job at uh outside of that is to accuse those that belong to god that's that's one of their first and foremost jobs is to accuse those that are innocent to lay accusation at the feet of those that belong to god to try to get you to believe the devil's bidding whoever is saying it or whoever is doing it whoever's become that willing subject or subjects willing to do that and to do the bidding of the devil to try to get you to disbelieve and to try to get you to doubt or disbelieve who you are now if you're a christian and you're born again you have the holy ghost then you belong to god you're his you're a godly person you live according to the scripture and that accusation can only be laid based on your humanity it can't be laid based on the fact that you're a godly person that's your holy ghost field that in your very innermost being your desire is to live for god it's not to live in the world now we do things that are wrong we make mistakes we're human again in our humanity and our our brain our spirit uh but but god allows for the understanding of that of course because jesus himself came as our kinsmen redeemer to go through all that we go through there there's not a temptation that we face that he didn't face a pain an egg an agony a loss of family a death jesus faced it all he knows what it's like when you go through all those things so he knows when you in your humanity get to those places he understands that's how he can intercede on our behalf that's how the blood works because he can intercede based on what he knows and what he already went through and of course his infancy because he's god he knows all things he knows the end from the beginning the devil and his angels now these angels these these these demons well we say angels fallen angels these demons find those willing subjects those demons try to find orchestrated of the devil they try to find people that are that are willing subjects and unfortunately saints uh i hope i'm not speaking out of turn but it seems like today there are a lot of willing subjects for these demons to find themselves in to be able to get in to manipulate and to do what they do in this world and in each person today now 8th first satan prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil satan which just now look at this which deceiveth the whole world amen that's why we can't be a part of the world that's why god has called his bride out of the world because the whole world has been deceived by satan and those demonic spirits the whole world has that's why you cannot be a part of the world you as a child of god cannot be a part of this cosmos of this world order because you're a child of god because the whole world has been deceived by this devil by this by these spirits they've been deceived but that does not include you it does not include those that are that are a blood vault born again filled with the holy ghost god's children it does not include you because you're not a part of the world god has called you as an exodus out of the world just like god has called a bride out of the church amen and made her his own she's been elected she's been predestined she's been called she's been set as god's chosen amen just like a man picks a wife just like a man picks a bride he rejects the billions of other women that are in the world and he takes them to his bosom one specific woman that he loves that he wants to spend the rest of his life with that he wants to take unto himself that's special every every every other woman means nothing in this capacity to this man except that one woman he chose her he picked her he elected her the woman picks the man too but speaking of christ and his bride now he picked her he chose her as a part of him amen so she's not a part of the world so there's no deception because you're not in the world but the world friend the whole world has been deceived and is being deceived by this enemy he deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation strength kingdom of our god the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down the accuser which accused them before our god day and night notice what he did to job notice how he accused job all the time oh he'll curse you to your face oh he'll do this god if you just take a hand off of him and i'll i'll show you what i'll do to him accusing day and night and that's exactly what he still does today sometimes he uses willing subjects to do it sometimes he just accuses you of things and jesus looks and and it may have been again it may have been something that you may have done as a human amen but when you come before the lord and you ask forgiveness you repent and that thing is washed in the blood it never happened doesn't it doesn't exist when god looks at it the awesome power and i don't you know most of you know me i don't even like the word awesome but the awesome power of god to be able to forget can you imagine we think in ourselves god can do anything and he can but the power of god to forget it ever happened amen i'm thankful he has that kind of power praise the lord right to forget any of those so that is annihilated doesn't it it's not held to your account anymore amen because in the garden of eden from the very oh my we can get way back can't we uh satan started this ball rolling when he misrepresented the word to eve he started this ball rolling and from there is where you came you didn't do that but you came as a result of that so you were trapped into this body you came into this world that's why every human ever lived has to have the opportunity to salvation everybody or god's not a just god right now it comes to that individual now whether you're going to accept it or reject it amen if you accept it and you get born again filled with god's spirit and under the blood of christ praise the lord if you don't that's the person's choice but god doesn't hold you responsible to that that's why the grace come in so bountifully and beautifully by the blood of christ that grace came in to take care of the things that you weren't that you didn't do you weren't in the gardev to to do what they did you didn't start this ball rolling you just came into this world as a result of that that's why the grace of god come so bountifully to show that we can have that redemption now that we could come back to him through that blood now satan is there as the accuser the accuser now look at this the accuser is someone who claims i like that's the word that i want to emphasize on to you here now the accuser is someone who claims a person has committed offense or done something wrong that's what an accuser is it's a claim an accusation is a claim is to say that by my authority you've done something wrong and then they go and they tell a judge or they tell somebody else or they tell the police or call the police or something i claim i accuse this person of have done something wrong amen that's what an accuser is has committed an offense or done something wrong but it does not mean just because somebody's laid an accusation at your feet does not mean that you did it does not mean that you're guilty of it even if you did again and your humanity did it in the blood of christ in his mind you never did it so when this accuser is before god day and night trying to accuse you he falls on deaf ears because you never did it he is the accuser of the innocent look he continuously does this over and over and over that's how he tries to defeat you that's how he tries to get you beat down to try to get you to to think that you're less than who you are in christ because if you're a son of god if you're a child of god if you're born of god and god has accepted you and elected you you are as god on this earth god has put himself in you and all the attributes that come as a representation of him come with it because it's his spirit it's his life that he has put in you and now that spirit living in you operates and lives by the spirit of god through his word and that word then speaks through your life it manifests itself it reveals itself it shows itself through you you become accepted in that light so when the accuser comes before god and tries to accuse you of things that never happened and look most of the time you ever been accused of somebody that of something that you didn't do has anybody i just you don't have to raise your hand or anything but has anybody ever accused you of doing something you know you never even did i mean let's just forget about the blood of christ and and forgiveness and but did you just never did it to begin with i have you ever had somebody or somebody's plural try to do everything they can and almost make it their life's mission it seems to find dirt on you to find something wrong with you this there's got to be something going on we've got to find something against this person there must be some kind of some friend if you dig long enough you're going to find plenty because we're all human right but it seems like so many times that the accuser is someone who is the most guilty about what they're accusing the the person for [Music] you ever notice that they accuse somebody of something they're guilty of doing but they but but see they're forgiven that that's gone and done away but then they accuse other people of the exact same thing or something that's along the same lines you say well i i don't do this yeah but you do this right oh well you know and then excuses come but that's what an accuser does that's exactly what the devil does he makes the accused the accused look so guilty that there's no way that they can be forgiven but the blood of jesus christ we know annihilates all sin nothing helps but usually the guilty is the one that's actually the the one that's to blame they're probably the one doing the thing they're claiming the other person has done or is doing because of their because that's the accusation that they they want to find something it's like that uh it's like that attitude i kind of even wrote some of it in my book it's it's kind of like that attitude of sean freud of people certain people now remember we're not accusing any brothers we're not accusing any sisters we're not accusing any churches we're not accusing anybody but the devil that's all the devil the devil is the one to take the hit here not a brother or sister or a church the devil is the accuser now but as he would find a willing subject the willing subject maybe that person that just for some reason again and i'll ask the question is anybody that you've ever met in your life that just you meet them or or you speak to them or for for whatever reason even if it's just for five minutes that person just hates you you don't know why and they may not even be able to tell you why maybe you're just such a good person they hate you so much for it because they feel guilty because they're not maybe you live the kind of life they wish they could live and they feel like they can't and in yourself you can't you have to have the holy spirit to live the kind of life that a born-again child of god does you have to have the holy spirit but they're mad at you for that oh well then we've got to find anything that we can find against this person you go to a job or lived on or worked on a job and and profess you're a christian have you ever gone to a job professor or christian imagine going on and working at a job and professing to be a minister and say you're a preacher a pastor you think people look at you just because you say you're a christian go there as a minister and see how people look at you it's amazing but it's that it's that spirit and then that's the point i'm trying to get to is that spirit that that gets on to people that does this and for some reason that person just hates you or persons or they're going to find something they're going to accuse you somehow they're going to dig and dig and dig and dig they're going to try to find whatever they can dig up to accuse you of something but remember the accuser is the devil amen that's the accuser first peter chapter 5. i just want to read one verse of scripture first peter chapter 5 verse 8. be sober be vigilant sober just means temperate it doesn't mean don't drink alcohol it just means to be don't don't let your temper get the best of you it means stay calm if you will don't get beside yourself be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour that's why we always make sure that we watch and pay attention and that we are that we're walking in the oracles of god's word and that we're living the life as best we can as pleasing to god nothing to cross his word nothing to hurt him nothing that would cause you to be flagged as guilty but soberly vigilantly because satan's going to continue to do this friends that's why we're always watching always protecting always keeping because we don't want to get ourselves to the place that that to give any room of the devil any wedge in that door that satan could use to try to get in to destroy your character some way because again even though it shouldn't be done it is done all the time where people destroy one another's character over whatever right it shouldn't be done but remember there's going to be willing subjects yeah there's going to be willing subjects that these spirits will will infiltrate themselves in and will operate through and those are the kind of people that are going to be uh the accuser if you will now let's go to saint john chapter 8. we know very well we are not the only ones that satan does this to when jesus christ came himself from the very first time that he came forth and was acknowledged by others around him there were men there were organizations there were pharisees sadducees scribes that absolutely hated jesus and i imagine though it does not say if you were to go ask any of them why do you hate this man so bad what did he ever do to you how has this man hurt you he's only spoke good things he's only spoke righteous things he's only he's never brought sickness only healing he's never brought death only light he's only been here to be good to be an example of good to be a holy righteous god why do you hate him so much look we'll get to that in a few minutes but look at saint john uh chapter eight verse four they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou now look these men they already have caught this woman they're already blood thirsty they're ready to bash your head in as quickly as they can with rocks because they're following a law which they by the law were commanded to do they were ready to do this they were they knew what the word was because they told jesus moses in the and the commandment and the law told us this is what we're supposed to do to her then why haven't you done it right why didn't you do it why did you bring her here you caught her in the very act why haven't you already done what you say moses told you to do why didn't you do it well look at this what says thou this they said tempting him amen remember because they hate him they absolutely hate jesus they said this tempting him that they might have to accuse him they're trying to set him up they're trying to put him in a position that they can bring a railing accusation against him that's how much they hated him that's how much they wanted to try to destroy him was to try to bring this accusation against him now we know that was never going to happen until it was time for jesus to offer himself up which he did which he told pilate he said i could have 10 late 12 legions of angels come and take me down right now take me away from here just one word those angels are sitting there flaming swords drawn ready to take over at just a hint of jesus saying something they would have pulled him away from them he would have rescued him but that's not the purpose he came here for amen he came here to die to shed his blood to redeem us but they hated him hated him tempting him they're trying their best to dig up dirt they're trying not just to dig up dirt they're trying to create dirt they're trying to manufacture something they normally would have destroyed this woman they normally would have stoned her to death because they said here they already they knew that that's what moses said to do and not no doubt that's probably what they've done every other time they've done this amen but they wanted to tempt him they wanted to try to find a place to accuse him of something now i'm sure nobody in here has ever had that happen to them lay a trap satan lays a trap be careful amen because those traps will get you if you're not careful amen but they just wanted to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him cast the first stone at her first catholics donut her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground did you imagine what was going through their minds at that time now it's been a great debate never says in the scripture but it's been a great debate on what jesus was writing on the ground what do you think he was writing on the ground you think he was naming every one of those men that were standing there with a stone you think maybe he was putting their names down and the things they were guilty of what do you think that what do you think he was writing i don't know they're probably up for great debate anybody can say well he could have been doing this he could have visited but he could have been but the result is what we're talking about he without sin let you cast the first stone entered stoops down and he starts writing again and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those not accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man lord jesus said to her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more amen you've been rescued you've been declared innocent that that you've done has been done away with now don't go do it again right amen stay pure of that thing don't go do it again don't go and sin no more don't don't don't let this thing come on you now that's the worst thing and he tells one later said the lord or worse thing come upon me amen but her accusers were gone they had no more satan found willing subjects he brought them to this place and their purpose in their mind was to us to accuse him but why what was their motive what was the motive they had i see i i bring all this out to help us understand in our minds in our lives with other people with things that we have faced in life friend what is the motive what's the reason if we desire to try to go to cue somebody why what is your point what is your endgame what are you trying to accomplish does it raise us up to see other people torn down that's shot and freud that is the pleasure of getting uh something out of watching somebody else fall the joy the happiness that is sad yes that is a demonic spirit friend to get joy out of watching somebody else fall now i had someone call me one time because he did something and i told him i said you're wrong you shouldn't do this you're wrong that person called me later and they said oh brother i appreciate if you don't tell so-and-so i said that's not my job that's not my job to tattletail it's god's job if god wants it to be exposed he'll do it not me now that that doesn't happen every single time because there has been times the lord has in uh uh has pushed me to say something but that wasn't that position i wasn't there to tell that tear that person down my motive wasn't to destroy that person's character it wasn't so what is the motive what's the reason when those things come and they come to you and others bring them to you what would be the reason why why are they desiring to destroy you why do they feel like that they get lifted up more just because you get torn down that's that's what happens in government which is probably the most corrupt institution in this country today is government right that sounds like government or corporate business i'll get a promotion if this person gets torn down but how what kind of a place is that in the kingdom of god what kind what kind of situation what does that serve in a body of christ others may be trying to do it to you but look saints god is your protector god is the one that watches over you god is the one that takes care of you not anybody else not somebody down there god does that leave it in his hands let him take care of it you might look and say but i don't understand it's not necessarily meant for you to understand you just got to believe it david even said lord why did the wicked prosper so he didn't get an answer i don't have an answer i can't tell you that all i know is that god has a purpose and everything that god does he serves and i'm his child and everything that he does works out for my good american everything i i might not understand it might not be able to explain it but i know it does sometimes things have happened 20 30 years ago in my life and i might come to a realization someday i'm sure that's never happened to any of you either you come to realization one nation when no wonder that happened over here like that because god was bringing me to this place or this thing or to do this or for this purpose amen and then we fret about it we worry about it we go back and forth and people and things and accusings enough and and what does it actually amount to what does it bring us see what are we trying to accomplish what are we trying to get to satan is continually accusing us day and night day and night and he's deceived the whole world but day and night accusing us of something you did not do accusing the innocent now this woman was guilty she was guilty as convicted she was caught in the very act the law said what her punishment was and those men there as righteous men of the of the torah was there to execute that that moses told them to do they weren't out of bounds look they weren't out of bounds but their motive in bringing the woman to jesus was what was out of bounds if you will because they just wanted to tempt him they just wanted to try to find something to accuse him to try to make him look guilty or try to make him look like a bad person oh with jesus then we can bring him before the council now because he did this he said this and he did walk like this see to try to make him look guilty when they themselves were so guilty that when he told them if you don't have any sin in your life go ahead and throw the stone one by one they had to drop it because they knew what kind of life they lived and who they were friend every one of us has sinned and comes toward the glory of god amen every one of us let's look at this next scripture with jesus over john 18. there should never never be a joy in our heart if we see somebody fall never if there is saints we need to find a place and start praying and asking god lord take the spirit out of me because that's not right you certainly if you were in their place you certainly won't want them doing the same thing we should never get joy from someone else falling john 18. they finally accused him they finally got him to this place now 28th verse john 18 28 then led they jesus from from uh from campus unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall unless they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bringing against this man he's looking at some reason that he's there with jesus what is this accusation and look what they said they answered and said unto him if he were not a male factor we would not have delivered him unto thee that's no evidence that's no reason they didn't tell him why they just said well if he wasn't guilty we wouldn't have brought him here well i mean pilate said i think that's not my job you're supposed to tell me what did he do why is he here why did you bring him to me there's got to be a reason oh well if he wasn't guilty we wouldn't have brought him here that's not a that's not a reason what did he do see they couldn't tell them they had nothing against him oh yeah he's a man and call himself god well they got that absolute backwards because he was god calling himself man or being a man they got that backwards anyway but they couldn't even give pilate a reason why they brought him there just that he's guilty he's a male factor he was the male factor he wouldn't be here nothing nothing of substance then said pilate unto them take he him and judge him according to your law then excuse me added to them the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death so you're telling me that you're wanting to kill this man and you can't even tell me why you can't even give me a reason no evidence no accusation you're telling me you think this man deserves to die for what what did he do but see that wasn't it they just hated him hated him without cause he didn't do anything but good and holy oh sure it made him mad because it crossed every bit of their religious diadem but he didn't do anything wrong he didn't make any mistakes he lived a perfect sinless life they had nothing to accuse him of and they still wanted to kill him or what what did he do you take him and judging them well we can't put a man to death oh what do you want to kill him for he didn't do anything mine see how it is so you ever get in that position saint or we have been before you understand the spirit that drives that amen again it's not it's not the person it's not a brother or sister it's it's the devil it's the devil amen and yes i'm not going to stand here and say the devil doesn't need to be exposed he does amen i'm not saying that the devil should just be left in his own play land no the devil does need to be exposed i mean that's what the opening of the seals was all about was expose the enemy to expose the devil all of his things to the church ages and all that he's done up to this time and going to do see but they had no reason to put him to death 32nd verse that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him sayeth thou this of thyself or did others tell it of thee pilate answered i am i a jew that old nation and chief priests have delivered the unto me what hast thou done see he still doesn't even know what they what he's done he's asking jesus now because they couldn't the accusers could not even tell him what they were there what he was there for what have you done he still doesn't know jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my king were of this world then would my servants fight and i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am the king to this hand was i born for this cause came into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice that's the people that are not of the world because they hear his voice not the voice of the world not the voice of the devil in this demonic spirit but his voice i hear his voice not of the world pilate said unto him those all immortal words what is truth people say it today exactly the thing that people looking for today people of the world people everywhere around the world people in religious denominations and religious uh churches places all around still asking this question what is the truth and dares i say it i don't mean to go out on a limb here but unfortunately it seems like the greater portion of the religious world doesn't even know the answer to this question they still try to find an answer in some phrase or soliloquy or when they can't they they don't see and realize that truth is not a word it's not an answer it's a person the truth is standing before pilate and he doesn't even know it he's telling it he's asking truth what is truth now could jesus just stood there so well you're looking at it because he was true he is true and when he and when he said this he went out again unto the jews and said unto them i find in him no fault at all even judged by the ones they took him to was still guiltless i i'm the judge i judge him righteous he hasn't done anything you can't tell me he's done anything he's not told me i haven't seen anything there's been no evidence this man is guiltless he's done nothing wrong i find no fault in him but you have a custom that i should release unto you one of the passover we therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews then cry they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber they'd rather have the robber they'd rather had the person that really was guilty of something of someone that had actually done wrong and had wronged other people that's who he had in prison they'd rather had jesus who'd done nothing wrong and they could not find any fault against him and pilate could not find any fault against it he was guiltless he had done no wrong my ever been in that situation you think what have i done right what mistake have i made i've had people lay in accusation against me and they look me square in the eye after laying these accusations and say well do you have any accusations for somebody else like are you kidding me are you seriously asking me that as a son a child a child of god you're asking me that question i i i don't know how to answer that you think if i know something against this brother or sister whoever i'm going to tell you or i'm going to expose it or i'm going to broadcast this on the news or a billboard or somewhere are we christians or are we ungodly government whatever who who do we think we are not paraphrasing i didn't say all that i'm like absolutely not i don't do that i think we're somewhat the words i said i don't do that even if i knew something i'm not going to tell you i just don't understand it but i do understand that satan is continuously accusing you before god day and night and he's accusing the innocent because in god's eyes you never did it in the first place amen let me read one more scripture we'll close here romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8. let's start with verse 12 31. what shall we they what shall we then say to those things if god be for us who can be against us my mind he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him so freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect who it is god to justify it and remember we've already talked about justification is it though you've never never done it in the first place it is god that justified so who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect it's god to justify it it's not you that justify it it's not me that justified it's not the devil it's not a church it's not a pastor it's god god does the justifying you can bring all the accusations you can level all the accusations you want against but if god's done the justifying you are innocent never did it in the first place amen not held to your account because god finds no record against you for that no record you know where it goes it goes right back on the head of satan where it lays of the dead judgment because he is the accuser of the brethren he's the one from the very beginning that caused this whole thing this whole this whole ball rolling he started it generated it now as that sin lifts off and is counted against uh not against you it goes back to him now he's guilty of everything that he is accusing you of doing exactly so many times what the devil does he's guilty of something he's accusing somebody else of doing but the bible says who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect amen again that does not mean that the devil stays unexposed because the devil does need to be exposed when when something is prolifically demonically hurting other people then the devil should be exposed amen and god will deal with that right god will deal with that but satan is continuing to accuse you all the time in heaven day and night accusing you all the time but he's accusing the innocent he's guilty of the very thing he's accusing you of doing he's guilty of the very thing that he says that we are guilty of when god and the blood of jesus christ has made us guiltless has set us free has justified us as though you never did it in the first place praise the lord i think it's time we i think it's time we take all our shovels out that we that people keep digging up stuff from people's past and bash the devil's head in with them quit using them to dig up all this other dirt over here but just take it and just whack him one good time amen let him walk away with a few lumps on his head that's not gonna stop him but it might make you feel a little better amen praise the lord you know every time we lift up our voices to worship him every time we pick up this word and read it every time we bow our heads in prayer every time we put a tape on every time we come to church every time that we obey the word and god it's a bash in his head yes amen praise the lord every time that devil tries to come to you and say well you know go do this he said no devil satan get behind me let him leave with a few lumps amen he deserves it he deserves it you know we like to talk in the physical about spiritual elements but it still applies amen praise the lord he deserves it because he's still accusing you and he won't stop and he won't stop praise the lord day and night amen but thank god he's accusing the innocent guiltless praise the lord let's stand if we could satan is guilty he has his demonic spirits out there to try to bring deception to try to destroy you with it but thank god god has already made a way for us amen praise the lord looking for this song that came on my heart here and i know it when i find it but i can't remember the name of it amen i wish i could sister amen but i'll find it i promise you amen praise the lord you love the lord amen i thought it was earlier in the song of finance just came on my heart amen yes the blood will never lose its power i don't know if that's the name of it but that's the song i'm talking about if any of you know where that is the blood that jesus said 3 19. you said 3 19. 3 19. amen there it is amen praise the
