[24:17] available all the time anytime amen
[24:22] praise the Lord Jesus I have a request
[24:24] here from Sister Shelia she had
[24:27] mentioned earlier in this week that we
[24:29] please pray for sister Joy hakami
[24:31] several physical healing needs she has
[24:34] because she's an excruciating pain
[24:37] and so let's say sister Joy's been
[24:39] dealing with this for quite some time
[24:40] now I know that I still keep where I've
[24:43] been meaning to ask you how she was
[24:44] because I pray for all the time and uh
[24:47] regularly and I I just kept every time I
[24:50] pray for her
[24:51] um I kept thinking well I need to ask
[24:53] and see how she's doing and I keep
[24:54] forgetting so thank you for that sister
[24:56] Sheila is we do need to remember Sister
[24:59] joy in prayer if we could amen also
[25:02] brother Danny put a prayer request he
[25:04] said I've been going through the last
[25:05] couple of weeks of tenants washing their
[25:07] clothes at early morning hours four or
[25:09] five A.M
[25:11] and not being courteous or considerate
[25:13] to the people that live by the laundry
[25:14] room prayers that this will stop and
[25:17] manage will start being more involved in
[25:20] incidents reported amen so I certainly
[25:24] understand that brother it's tough
[25:25] you've got as much commotion going on
[25:28] I'm kind of a light sleeper myself but
[25:30] just not always a good thing because
[25:33] when I go on trips and stuff I have a
[25:35] lot of times air conditioners I'll have
[25:38] a constant fan that just run all night
[25:39] but all but all it does is dry me out so
[25:42] it's kind of a catch-22 so you stay away
[25:45] from all the commotion going around or
[25:47] uh because you can't breathe it's one
[25:49] way or the other so
[25:52] brother Danny
[25:53] for that need of prayer this morning
[25:55] also amen sister Norma wrote a praise
[25:59] report here but it also kind of has a
[26:01] prayer request so if it's you're okay
[26:02] with you I'm going to read it
[26:04] um the praise report was thank God for
[26:07] prayers for Kathy who we pray for the
[26:09] other day all went well with her
[26:12] colonoscopy but she says that she has an
[26:15] infection in her stomach so they took a
[26:18] biopsy of that infected so let's
[26:21] remember her sister Kathy still in
[26:23] prayer and amen the Lord would just
[26:25] bless her and touch her so I'm thankful
[26:26] for the prayer for the praise report
[26:28] thankful God was Mindful and blessed her
[26:30] through that colonoscopy but we
[26:33] certainly want to remember that need in
[26:34] prayer for the infection in her stomach
[26:36] as well so amen does anyone have an
[26:39] unspoken request on your heart we all
[26:42] have needs desires and a heartless stand
[26:43] to our feet if we could
[26:45] and then we'll take these thieves to the
[26:47] Lord in prayer brother Dennis if you
[26:49] would fall asleep
[26:50] let's pray together Lord Jesus who comes
[26:53] for you
[26:54] with burdens on our heart and we know we
[26:58] serve a God that's mindful of all our
[27:01] needs and Lord I had it in my heart as
[27:06] our pastor already mentioned there was a
[27:09] lady that had a blood issue for 12 years
[27:12] and Lord she spent all her money to go
[27:15] to the doctor oh my mind they couldn't
[27:17] do anything for her father but then she
[27:21] heard about a man Dr Jesus yes and she
[27:25] heard the testimonies that people were
[27:27] just touching His Garment Hallelujah and
[27:31] Lord she rushed through the crowd cause
[27:33] she heard that Jesus was gonna be there
[27:35] and she ran to Jesus and was able to
[27:40] Touch the Hem of His Garden amen yes and
[27:44] our Lord turned around and said who
[27:47] touched me and the disciples were
[27:49] confused because everybody was touching
[27:51] him but they asked the Lord everyone is
[27:55] touching you he says no but virtue has
[27:59] left me yes and he looked he knew who
[28:02] touched him yes he looked right at her
[28:04] amen sister your faith has made you
[28:09] whole thank you Jesus and father let
[28:12] there be a testimony in our hearts Let
[28:14] It Be Lord today Lord yes our faith in

[29:20] time of your second coming approaches
[29:23] near and near there's less people coming
[29:26] to church there's less people being
[29:29] concerned with their walk with you
[29:31] they're more involved with the things of
[29:33] the world to see what they can get and
[29:36] how they can be more accomplished than
[29:40] to be more dedicated and consecrated in
[29:43] serving you help us fathers and
[29:46] following obedience to your word for we

[31:44] foreign
[31:53] in the days of the flood and that Noah
[31:56] was the only one who was left pure in
[32:00] his generation of the floods
[32:03] and it struck me how
[32:06] how that we
[32:09] that Faith had answered the hearts of
[32:13] eight people not one eight people
[32:19] so think about that
[32:22] and they all gone on the boat
[32:26] and
[32:27] they were all saved
[32:29] and I just realized that people want to
[32:33] look at one another as all they're
[32:34] they're hybrid or this racism and and
[32:37] all this you know
[32:40] difference

[33:02] your heart yes for the dentist yes um
[33:05] this is the Lord once again
[33:08] uh protecting me as one of his children

[33:18] west about to cross uh Harrison and that
[33:21] car let off I thought you know they're
[33:24] going to be turning left but they didn't
[33:27] stop they kept going and I had my little
[33:30] daughter who's going to take him and get
[33:32] his nails trimmed in and I sold the
[33:35] spunky hold on and I swerved my truck
[33:41] and I says Lord just see us through this
[33:44] accident

[33:48] so I parked my truck on Broadway and I
[33:51] got out I didn't see anything
[33:54] Lord your Angels were protecting me but
[33:58] because we are carnal I pulled off on by
[34:02] Sonic and I checked again so from there
[34:06] on as I was taking my dog to get his
[34:08] nails to him I was praising the Lord

[40:20] glad to see each one this morning amen I
[40:23] want to go begin in our in the scripture
[40:26] in Genesis chapter 2.
[40:30] amen I had to given this several years
[40:33] ago
[40:34] and as uh
[40:36] the thought came on my heart the other
[40:38] day uh it reminisced me back to this
[40:42] and I felt like the Lord just impressed
[40:44] me to try to bring this again it's been
[40:47] six seven years ago or so
[40:51] amen but I want to start in Genesis
[40:53] chapter 2 read a couple of verses of
[40:56] scripture there before we let you be
[40:58] seated Genesis chapter 2. we'll begin
[41:00] with the 15th verse

[42:28] put it I mean uh brother Branham said it
[42:31] many times years ago and Satan's eaten
[42:33] but Lord It's just
[42:36] you look around and see they just they

[43:20] try to hurt hinder and filtrate this
[43:22] service in any way in the name of the
[43:23] Lord Jesus Christ Lord that you would
[43:26] have complete control and that all
[43:28] things would be done for your glory and
[43:30] honor now may Lord you God have your
[43:33] preeminence here that whatever your
[43:35] purpose is for this service today would
[43:37] be accomplished as we committed to you
[43:39] asked your blessings on it in the name
[43:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[43:45] amen praise the Lord Genesis chapter 2
[43:48] we're going to begin reading with verse
[43:50] 15.
[43:52] amen
[43:53] I had a rough week this week pretty
[43:55] tired
[43:57] feel good now of course under the
[43:59] anointing God is just always a real
[44:01] blessing but this was I think I've
[44:03] mentioned before we did a week one this
[44:05] week up in Colorado Springs and it was
[44:07] uh been in about 70 hours it was a
[44:10] pretty rough week hard pretty hard work
[44:12] so but thankful God it's blessed us amen
[44:15] and uh thankful for good flights and
[44:17] bringing me back home and being here
[44:19] with you today so I'm very thankful
[44:22] God's blessings now Genesis chapter 2 uh
[44:25] we'll read verses 15 16 and 17 and we'll
[44:28] let you be seated
[44:30] and the Lord God took the man
[44:32] put him into the Garden of Eden to dress
[44:34] it and to keep it the Lord God commanded
[44:37] the man saying of every tree of the
[44:39] garden thou mayest freely eat
[44:42] but of the tree of the the tree of the
[44:44] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[44:47] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[44:50] eat us thereof Thou shalt surely die and
[44:54] you can be seated if you like
[44:57] now we do know and realize and as the
[45:00] scripture has told us and that brother
[45:02] Randolph reminded us many times of that
[45:05] death doesn't necessarily and doesn't uh
[45:08] and our vernacular is a multi
[45:11] multifaceted word it doesn't just mean
[45:14] that breath has left your physical body
[45:16] in fact brother random talked about when
[45:18] it mentions death in the scripture it's
[45:21] talking about a spiritual death
[45:23] amenities you know that when Adam and
[45:26] Eve cross over that line that God told
[45:28] him not to or they would die they did
[45:30] not die physically they still lived
[45:33] after that point in time but the
[45:35] spiritual death so what happened was God
[45:38] that through through the Disobedience of
[45:41] man a great Chasm was thrown between God
[45:45] and man so the fellowship that Adam had
[45:48] that God had with Adam that he came down
[45:51] and cool of the afternoon every day and
[45:54] spoke to Adam was broken the separation
[45:57] happened right there When sin came in
[46:00] the camp and it was no longer the way it
[46:02] used to be God and man were separated
[46:06] supposedly and uh and assumedly forever
[46:12] that God would never man would never be
[46:15] reconciled back to God the same way that
[46:18] it was with Adam when Adam and Eve at
[46:20] that day before the fall now let's read
[46:23] Genesis chapter 3
[46:28] go a page over Genesis chapter 3
[46:32] where we begin reading with verse 17.
[46:35] continue on with this story now Genesis
[46:39] 3 17.
[46:40] and unto Adam he said
[46:43] because thou has hearkened unto the
[46:46] voice of thy wife and has eaten of the
[46:49] tree of which I commanded thee saying
[46:51] thou shall not eat of it now again
[46:53] remember which I have said in the past
[46:56] this was not something that was in
[47:00] the woman's curse this was not something
[47:04] that God said to Eve why because God did
[47:07] not tell Eve what he just said here that
[47:11] you should not eat of the tree of the
[47:13] knowledge of Good and Evil he did not
[47:14] tell you that he told Adam that
[47:17] so it wasn't in Eve's curse it was only
[47:20] in Adams because only to Adam did God
[47:23] give those instructions now Eve's
[47:26] instructions came from her head Adam
[47:29] amen she learned of it she knew of it
[47:33] she knew she shouldn't have done it
[47:34] based on what Adam told her was what
[47:37] which is what God Said So when Adam
[47:40] spoke that word to Eve it was just as
[47:44] God was standing there telling her amen
[47:47] so that I say that because that brings
[47:50] us in light of understanding that just
[47:52] because an individual just because a
[47:55] person a human relays something or speak
[47:58] something it helps us understand how
[48:00] when brother Brown says that this bride
[48:03] becomes the voice of God how does she
[48:05] become the voice of God when she's
[48:07] speaking God's word
[48:09] when she is speaking God's word it is if
[48:13] though God is speaking to that person
[48:16] amen it doesn't water it down now it
[48:20] does if the person doesn't relay God's
[48:22] word the way the word says if they
[48:25] interject their own thoughts or opinions
[48:27] or something into it then it's not God
[48:29] speaking but if it's per a person and
[48:32] I'm not talking about just a minister
[48:34] I'm not talking about just a pastor
[48:36] preacher I'm talking about anybody
[48:38] anybody that's why the bride amen is the
[48:42] final voice to the final age it didn't
[48:45] say brother Branham was the final voice
[48:47] to the final age it didn't say the
[48:50] pastors or preachers it said the bride
[48:53] brother Adam said through God speaking
[48:55] the bride is the final voice to the
[48:57] final age how because she only speaks
[49:00] God's word
[49:02] she speaks when he speaks and she is
[49:05] silent when he is silent praise the Lord
[49:08] and when she speaks she speaks only
[49:10] God's word so when she speaks God's word
[49:14] it is if God is speaking
[49:17] when Adam was speaking to Eve it was God
[49:20] telling Eve through Adam
[49:22] you shall not do this praise the Lord so
[49:26] she knew it but she did it
[49:28] but the curse now was to Adam and being
[49:33] her head it was his responsibility let's
[49:35] follow let's go through now cursed is
[49:38] the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt
[49:41] thou eat of it all the days of thy life
[49:43] thorns and thistle shall it bring forth
[49:45] to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of
[49:47] the field
[49:49] thanks Adam appreciate it had a hard
[49:51] week this week the sweat of my brow
[49:53] appreciate it a lot been nice but it's
[49:55] just still been in that Garden right
[49:58] praise the Lord appreciate it uh uh dad
[50:01] that was as a rough week but anyway
[50:05] um
[50:06] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[50:08] bread
[50:09] till thou return unto the ground for out
[50:12] of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art
[50:16] and unto dust shalt thou return now
[50:19] notice that was never something that God
[50:21] told Adam until the fall
[50:24] even though he was taken from the Dust
[50:27] that was never part of the conversation
[50:29] until after the fall that he would
[50:32] return back to the dust from which he
[50:34] came
[50:35] denoting eternal life
[50:37] helping us know that from the very
[50:40] beginning here in the Garden of Eden
[50:42] when God took from the dust and made
[50:44] Adam
[50:45] it's spoke of eternal life because there
[50:49] was no back to the Dust
[50:51] but now after the curse after the fall
[50:54] there was a falling in of man into the
[50:58] dust again
[51:00] and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[51:02] because she is the mother of all living
[51:04] now now the woman now has a name right
[51:07] amen did not have a name up to this
[51:09] point but now she has a name why because
[51:12] she is the mother of all living not Adam
[51:15] the father of all living but he the
[51:17] mother of all living and aren't you Adam
[51:19] also and to his wife did the Lord God
[51:22] make coats of skin and clothe them and
[51:25] the Lord God said behold the man is
[51:27] become as one of us to know good and
[51:30] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[51:33] and take also of the tree of life and
[51:35] eat and live forever therefore the Lord
[51:37] God sent him forth from the Garden of
[51:39] Eden sent him away to till the ground
[51:43] from when she was taken so he God drove
[51:47] out the man and he placed at the east of
[51:51] the Garden of Eden cherubimes with a
[51:53] flaming sword which turned every way to
[51:56] keep the way of the tree of life now as
[51:58] we see that God has taken and pushed man
[52:02] ejected or uh
[52:05] uh pushed man out of the Garden of Eden
[52:08] took him out of the Garden of Eden and
[52:11] told him that he from from that time
[52:14] that he would return to the dust from
[52:17] that time God would no longer come and
[52:21] meet with them Fellowship speak lip to
[52:25] ear that it would no longer be that way
[52:29] now sin through that great Chasm between
[52:34] God and man
[52:35] sin did it Sin Sin dug a huge Grand
[52:40] Canyon between God and man wider than
[52:43] the Grand Canyon so why it was felt to
[52:46] be un uh untraversed there was no way to
[52:51] get from point A to point B there was no
[52:53] way for a man and God to be reconciled
[52:56] again but God this separation and this
[53:00] Chasm caused her where the access that
[53:03] man had to God was gone God began to
[53:08] speak to man and limit that access to
[53:13] begin to start a little bit of a a way
[53:16] where there could be substitutes made
[53:19] uh substitutes me that that would that
[53:23] would be a point see because when God uh
[53:26] it was never the way it was
[53:29] before the fall but God started right
[53:33] here in the 21st verse by making a way
[53:36] for man and God to have some sort of
[53:39] relationship never like it was there's
[53:41] still there's still chasms that Chasm is
[53:44] still there it's about to make some sort
[53:46] of a Reconciliation some sort of a
[53:49] bringing back together again God took
[53:53] those sheep and slew the Sheep took the
[53:56] lives of innocent animals and through
[53:58] the shinskin and for Adam and Eve to put
[54:00] on so that they could come out from
[54:02] their hiding into God's presence again
[54:05] but they there was a separation
[54:09] before there was no separation
[54:13] before the fall but now there's a
[54:15] separation
[54:16] man now has a covering man now has
[54:21] something that is shielding them from
[54:24] God Amen as much as that Chasm was
[54:28] thrown of sin
[54:30] God started right here to make a way
[54:34] in the slightest way a substitute
[54:37] that would allow man and God to have
[54:40] some sort of a relationship never was
[54:42] again like it was right it couldn't be
[54:45] because God said the day you eat thereof
[54:48] that's the day you're gonna die that's
[54:49] the day that me and you are separated
[54:52] here Adam
[54:53] amen and they still work now notice when
[54:57] when when Adam fell
[55:01] there was a separation brought between
[55:03] God and man
[55:05] so what did Adam do Adam being the
[55:08] amateur god of the Earth being God's
[55:10] spoken word Adam knew
[55:13] so he did what when he heard God
[55:16] he created a buffer between him and God
[55:20] he went into the bushes he hid from God
[55:23] of course he you can't hide from God the
[55:26] Bible says he hid he can't hide you know
[55:28] that uh but that but but Adam knew
[55:32] enough to put a buffer between him and
[55:35] God so he he got in the bushes he hid in
[55:38] the bushy him and he hid in the bushes
[55:40] to create a barrier
[55:42] but then when God came down and he said
[55:46] where are you well God knew exactly
[55:48] where they were but God's talking to
[55:51] Adam saying Adam where are you do you
[55:54] know where you are Adam do you realize
[55:57] what has happened see God people people
[56:01] would have an old Dopey Grandpa like God
[56:05] that's walking around saying where is
[56:08] Adam I can't find Adam
[56:11] God knew exactly where Adam was he's God
[56:15] he's omnipotent he's all-knowing there
[56:18] is no way Adam could get out of a into a
[56:21] place where God God couldn't find him
[56:23] nor can any of you
[56:26] none of us can ever get to a place to
[56:28] worship well I'm gonna hide this from
[56:29] God no you're not you can't it's
[56:32] impossible it was impossible for Adam to
[56:35] hide from him but he got and and Adam
[56:37] knew that and again I'm not trying to
[56:40] change the word Saints but when it when
[56:43] it says hid uh Adam Adam knew he wasn't
[56:46] hiding from God
[56:48] Adam knew there was no way he could hide
[56:50] from the almighty omnipotent all-knowing
[56:53] he knew he couldn't but what he did is
[56:56] he got in the bushes and created a
[56:58] buffer he created a separation a place
[57:01] that that it could not be the way it was
[57:04] before
[57:05] when Adam came down when God used to
[57:08] come before and they came together man
[57:09] they had fellowship and lived to era and
[57:12] talked and enjoyed each other's company
[57:13] in the cool of the day but now it was
[57:16] different
[57:17] and Adam knew it so he he hid in the
[57:21] bushes or he got in the bushes he said
[57:23] God I know I'm here I know what happened
[57:26] I'm so sorry
[57:27] Adam I told you not to do this
[57:30] I know
[57:32] the wife she gave me said this and
[57:34] tempted me with it and and and and I
[57:36] fell by it and he did because he knew if
[57:38] he hadn't God would have destroyed her
[57:40] and he loved her she was bone of his
[57:42] bone flesh of his flesh life of his life
[57:44] right and he didn't want to see her get
[57:46] destroyed so he was willing to become
[57:48] sin so that God would not destroy her
[57:51] because he knew that he wouldn't destroy
[57:53] Adam because he was his son right he
[57:56] wasn't going to destroy Adam but there
[57:57] was a separation there but now since the
[58:00] two had become one Adam and Eve had
[58:03] become one even one flesh amen as it was
[58:06] flesh of Flesh bone of Bones as Adam
[58:08] said
[58:09] when there was one flesh then God
[58:12] couldn't destroy her without destroying
[58:14] him right amen so he they hide in the
[58:17] bushes
[58:19] the curses come
[58:21] he cursed even he cursed at him and he
[58:24] cursed to Cursed the ground excuse me
[58:26] not Adam they cursed the ground
[58:29] and and
[58:31] the whole time there's this buffer
[58:34] between God and man there's this buffer
[58:37] and then all of a sudden God takes it
[58:41] upon himself to take some animal life
[58:43] innocent animal life which was a
[58:46] substitute of what their relationship
[58:48] was Prior
[58:50] their relationship was pure and
[58:52] righteous and holy now sin had entered
[58:54] in so there had to be something that
[58:57] could be a substitute that God would
[59:00] accept
[59:01] so that Adam and Eve could again uh
[59:04] speak to God so that there could still
[59:07] be uh some sort of a relationship
[59:10] nothing like it was because there's that
[59:12] great Chasm no more could he come down
[59:14] did he come down in the cool of the day
[59:16] and all the relationship they had it was
[59:18] all different but God took those sheets
[59:20] in and throw them into the bushes notice
[59:23] Adam and Eve it doesn't say Adam and Eve
[59:26] came out from the bushes into God's
[59:28] presence and put them on no God threw
[59:32] them into the bushes and they put on
[59:34] that barrier before they could come out
[59:36] of the bushes so once the bush separated
[59:39] them now the now the sheepskin separated
[59:42] them amen even though they were right
[59:44] there if there was a separation there
[59:47] was a barrier amen it couldn't be the
[59:49] way it was and God from there of course
[59:51] speaking of Jesus Christ obviously if
[59:54] you can't read the first three chapters
[59:56] of Genesis and see Jesus Christ all over
[59:59] the word then I challenge you to go read
[1:00:01] it again yes and read it until you find
[1:00:04] Jesus in there over and over and over
[1:00:07] and over amen this being one of those
[1:00:10] places yes amen this being one of those
[1:00:12] places and when God did when God ejected
[1:00:16] Adam out of the Garden of Eden God
[1:00:19] continually from that time begin to make
[1:00:22] laws and rules and and and and and
[1:00:25] substitutes and so uh animals became
[1:00:29] change substitutes and and and animal
[1:00:32] life and the sacrifice and the blood and
[1:00:34] all the specifics that God was very very
[1:00:39] specific about now let me interject here
[1:00:41] for just a moment in my humble opinion I
[1:00:45] don't believe that God made each of
[1:00:49] these rules and regulations so strenuous
[1:00:53] that man couldn't do them right no he
[1:00:57] did not he they could follow them and
[1:00:59] they did follow them evangela became a
[1:01:02] stink in God's notes he did not make him
[1:01:04] to where they couldn't follow them but
[1:01:06] God is always continually it's like
[1:01:09] tithe and offering God is always
[1:01:12] challenging us to obedience yeah yes are
[1:01:15] we going to obey his word not just part
[1:01:18] of his word but all of his word and
[1:01:21] everything that God gave them there was
[1:01:23] a purpose and a reason and it spoke
[1:01:26] forward as a type and Shadow to Jesus
[1:01:30] Christ in the New Testament amen it all
[1:01:32] spoke forward but what it was was an
[1:01:35] obedience are you going to do this and
[1:01:37] this and this and leave this off and not
[1:01:41] do this part
[1:01:42] see God didn't do it just uh
[1:01:45] superficially he did it for a reason
[1:01:48] right right everything God does for a
[1:01:51] reason again it's like taught in an
[1:01:53] offering God doesn't need your money
[1:01:54] right God owns it all he doesn't need a
[1:01:59] dime of your money but it's not our
[1:02:01] money it's his yes it's his that he
[1:02:04] gives to us showing that we could be
[1:02:07] good good stewards of what God has
[1:02:09] blessed us with it's just an act of
[1:02:11] obedience that's all it is Saints God
[1:02:14] didn't need this the way it was God
[1:02:16] didn't need it so specific and the high
[1:02:19] Freaks and the garments and the threads
[1:02:21] and the Tabernacle he didn't need it to
[1:02:23] be that way but he's testing their
[1:02:25] obedience all the way
[1:02:27] testing their obedience are they going
[1:02:29] to do what I tell them to do to down to
[1:02:31] the very thread
[1:02:33] are they going to do it the way I tell
[1:02:35] them to do it amen God is continually
[1:02:38] doing that substituting
[1:02:40] trying to see because there's nothing
[1:02:42] that can bring that Chasm remember in
[1:02:45] Revelation chapter 5 John looked around
[1:02:48] down through the animals of history no
[1:02:51] doubt that God revealing by Supernatural
[1:02:55] Vision maybe that he looked down through
[1:02:58] the animals of time even to the Garden
[1:03:00] of Eden with Adam and Eve and said there
[1:03:02] was nobody working
[1:03:04] there was no man worthy to take this
[1:03:07] book and to loose these seals nobody
[1:03:09] could bridge that Chasm
[1:03:11] no m-a-n no human no person had the
[1:03:16] ability
[1:03:17] the right to take that book much less
[1:03:20] open it
[1:03:21] nobody and so John began to web
[1:03:25] he wept because his name was in that
[1:03:27] book and he knew if there wasn't someone
[1:03:30] to come forward that could loose those
[1:03:32] seals to open that book and to reveal
[1:03:35] that Redemption that all of humanity was
[1:03:38] lost
[1:03:39] down to Adam and Eve
[1:03:41] all of humanity would have been lost
[1:03:43] right and he knew it so he began to weep
[1:03:47] there was no way back no way back the
[1:03:50] substitutes that God made the animal
[1:03:52] life the the botany life the the blood
[1:03:56] uh the high priests all that God did and
[1:04:00] going into the holies of holies and and
[1:04:02] and and making that substitution making
[1:04:06] those restitutions from the people it
[1:04:09] was only a substitute there was no way
[1:04:14] John looked down he saw William Branham
[1:04:17] no he's not good enough looked down he
[1:04:20] saw the Great Men of this day and uh
[1:04:24] name whoever you want we can call out
[1:04:26] the ones that brother Ram said The
[1:04:28] Messengers of their day uh like Luther
[1:04:32] and Wesley and and Martin and and all
[1:04:36] down to to even to Paul
[1:04:39] looked down to Paul and say nope he's
[1:04:41] not worthy either
[1:04:43] look down through the animals of time
[1:04:45] into uh to to to Jacob and and Esau and
[1:04:50] and who all the way down all the Great
[1:04:53] Men Moses and and and all the great men
[1:04:56] that God had down to Noah and even to
[1:04:58] the Garden of Eden and there was no man
[1:05:01] nobody was Worthy to be able to take
[1:05:06] finally a lamb stepped forth
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] somebody cried John look the Lamb of God
[1:05:13] to take away this
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] step fourth fourth of bloody lamb to
[1:05:20] take that Redemption amen and was able
[1:05:23] had the ability to be able to redeem men
[1:05:26] back to bridge that Chasm that man Jesus
[1:05:30] Christ
[1:05:32] throw his own blood
[1:05:34] was able to bridge that sin chasm
[1:05:39] do where God and man could come back
[1:05:42] into relation and fellowship like they
[1:05:45] did in the Garden of Eden amen back to
[1:05:48] the place that it once was man's still
[1:05:51] in the Fallen condition now so it's not
[1:05:53] exactly the same
[1:05:55] not physically but the relationship that
[1:05:58] God and man now have
[1:06:00] to be able to speak lip to ear to be
[1:06:03] able to access God at any time to be
[1:06:06] able to speak to him to know that he
[1:06:08] hears you to know that he is always

[1:07:24] airport the bus station she gave me 20
[1:07:26] tip
[1:07:28] I took two lawyers one time from the
[1:07:30] airport to the Ventana Canyon I think
[1:07:32] they gave me a dollar or something

[1:07:36] nothing these people were talking about
[1:07:38] spending 200 for a tea time a piece for
[1:07:42] four of them

[1:07:45] it is you try to get in company of those
[1:07:48] people they don't want to talk to you

[1:07:50] right you're too far down uh on on the
[1:07:54] on the class scale you're not good
[1:07:55] enough to talk to them you know even
[1:07:58] back in the day when people got rich
[1:08:01] and they would get into the company of

[1:08:24] he went through all of that all that he
[1:08:27] went through in life and being despised
[1:08:29] and no Beauty we could look on him to
[1:08:31] desire him and and being scourged and
[1:08:33] beat and dying and uh and hanging on a
[1:08:37] cross and and naked shade
[1:08:40] he had nothing
[1:08:43] so we could have access to him now that
[1:08:47] sand castle that was thrown down has had
[1:08:51] a bloody bridge bridge to cross from God
[1:08:54] to man so that God and man could come
[1:08:56] what did Brother Ram say and embrace one
[1:08:59] another I think he even said it one time
[1:09:01] to kiss one another
[1:09:04] God and man again in Fellowship oh
[1:09:07] praise the Lord amen friend we have that
[1:09:11] ability but and the opportunity but do
[1:09:13] we take it
[1:09:15] do we take advantage of it

[1:09:20] if I'm not in a specific closet or I'm
[1:09:24] not alone or or I don't have hours to
[1:09:27] speak to him then you know I just won't
[1:09:29] just wake up in the morning and talk to
[1:09:32] him for a minute and thank you
[1:09:35] pray over your meal or anything you can
[1:09:39] do just to speak to God yes look at the
[1:09:42] prayers that Jesus had when he was here
[1:09:45] he'll be in the middle of a throne to be
[1:09:47] able to say father I thank you it's been
[1:09:49] a minute and a half talking to the Lord

[1:13:46] but you know by faith that he's
[1:13:49] listening you know by his word that he's
[1:13:52] listening amen because he promised I
[1:13:54] believe it was through uh David
[1:13:56] his ear is turned to The Cry of the
[1:13:59] righteous he's listening he is
[1:14:01] perpetually listening wanting to have

[1:14:10] that's the real communion actually
[1:14:12] amen the bread the wine that's lots of
[1:14:15] representation but our True Fellowship
[1:14:18] our true communion is that that we speak
[1:14:20] to him talking and together amen not
[1:14:24] just a one-way conversation but together
[1:14:25] live to ear for the law of the spirit of
[1:14:28] life in Christ Jesus had made me free
[1:14:31] from the law of sin and death
[1:14:35] praise the Lord
[1:14:37] for what the law could not do and that
[1:14:39] it was weak through the flesh God
[1:14:42] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:14:45] sinful flesh didn't say it was simple
[1:14:47] it was in the likeness of simple
[1:14:50] pleasure
[1:14:51] and for sin condemn sin in the flesh now
[1:14:56] if his flesh had been a sinful flesh he
[1:15:00] could not have accomplished that
[1:15:02] but because he was only and merely in
[1:15:05] the likeness of sinful flesh he could
[1:15:08] take our sin
[1:15:10] amen that the righteousness of the law
[1:15:12] the righteousness of the law amen might
[1:15:16] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[1:15:19] the flesh but after the spirit the life
[1:15:23] amen the light that's there the life of
[1:15:27] God that's always what we're looking for
[1:15:29] amen that life am I without the life
[1:15:33] it's not alive
[1:15:36] you're not care who they say they all
[1:15:37] don't care what denomination preach or
[1:15:39] anything else there's no life there if
[1:15:42] there's no God like it's it's dead
[1:15:45] there's no life
[1:15:47] the only life there is is when the life
[1:15:49] of Jesus Christ comes that's the only
[1:15:51] life that there is life amen the true
[1:15:54] life first John chapter 5 chapter one
[1:16:01] amen first John
[1:16:04] first John chapter one
[1:16:07] uh chapter 1 verse 5. this then is the
[1:16:11] message which we have received which we
[1:16:13] have heard of him
[1:16:15] and declare unto you that God is light
[1:16:18] and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:16:22] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:16:25] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:16:29] not the truth
[1:16:30] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:16:34] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:16:37] another
[1:16:38] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:16:41] cleanses us for all sin sin is what
[1:16:47] unbelief
[1:16:48] it cleanses us from all unbelief which
[1:16:53] tells us what that we by faith believe
[1:16:57] that he's there
[1:16:59] that he is God and that we're speaking
[1:17:02] to him and that he hears us and that
[1:17:04] even if there's not an audible response
[1:17:07] we know he's listening amen amen that's
[1:17:10] why we have prayer requests that's why
[1:17:13] we say the things we say and do and have
[1:17:15] prayer in God's listening
[1:17:18] God's always listening
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:23] cleanses us from all sin if we say that
[1:17:26] we have no sin we deceive ourselves
[1:17:29] untruth it's not in us see that's the
[1:17:31] difference
[1:17:32] even at the same time that that sin can
[1:17:37] be present that bridge is still gapped
[1:17:42] the or that Chasm is still gapped by the
[1:17:44] bridge even at the same time because it
[1:17:48] said if we say we have no sin we deceive
[1:17:50] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[1:17:53] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[1:17:56] just forgive us for our sins and to
[1:17:59] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:18:02] praise the Lord what does that do that
[1:18:04] places Us in his position
[1:18:07] amen well rightfully so because he took
[1:18:10] our position
[1:18:12] if Jesus took our place then we by the
[1:18:16] scripture rightfully are to take his
[1:18:19] place
[1:18:20] that's what he told us when he takes
[1:18:23] away all unrighteousness well if all
[1:18:26] unrighteousness is God what does that
[1:18:28] make you
[1:18:30] righteous
[1:18:31] what's the opposite of unrighteous
[1:18:34] righteous well if he's taken away all
[1:18:37] unrighteousness what does that make you
[1:18:40] righteous in Christ Jesus not of your
[1:18:44] own abilities not of your own doing not
[1:18:46] of your own uh abilities but by Jesus
[1:18:49] Christ is robed you now with his
[1:18:52] righteousness yes praise the Lord
[1:18:54] because he's taken all of that away
[1:18:57] all of the unrighteousness if we say
[1:18:59] that we have not sinned we make him a
[1:19:01] liar and his word is not in US but
[1:19:03] that's that has placed Us in the
[1:19:05] position as he took our place to take
[1:19:08] his that places Us in that position of
[1:19:11] sonship
[1:19:12] amen with Jesus Christ now people want
[1:19:15] to talk about a different operations of
[1:19:18] gifts uh people want to try to elevate
[1:19:21] brother around to a certain place he had
[1:19:23] a different gift friend but in the
[1:19:25] sonship of Jesus Christ we are all the
[1:19:27] same yes
[1:19:29] Amen in the sonship of Jesus Christ we
[1:19:33] are all the same it did not take more
[1:19:37] blood to save me than it did to say
[1:19:39] brother random right it did not take
[1:19:42] more blood to save me than anybody else
[1:19:45] or more blood to save you than anybody
[1:19:48] else
[1:19:48] because we're all the same amen
[1:19:50] unrighteousness
[1:19:54] disbelief sin is it is all the same amen
[1:19:59] now there's different applications just
[1:20:03] like there's different offices brother
[1:20:04] Adam held a different office absolutely
[1:20:07] amen telling a little white lie it's
[1:20:11] still unbelief
[1:20:12] but do we equate it in this life the
[1:20:15] same as a murderer
[1:20:18] well no we don't
[1:20:19] but the same blood
[1:20:22] alleviates it all yes
[1:20:25] Kansas all unrighteousness
[1:20:28] now she has become him
[1:20:31] because he took my place so I could take
[1:20:34] him
[1:20:35] he's rode me in his righteousness now I
[1:20:39] have the ability the the opportunity
[1:20:43] the privilege
[1:20:45] of speaking to him amen amen all the
[1:20:48] time Paul said pray without ceasing well
[1:20:51] what is prayer and people want to make
[1:20:53] prayer of different things to me you you
[1:20:56] prayer can be what you want we went
[1:20:58] through a three or four or five series
[1:20:59] part part series about prayer but it can
[1:21:02] be whatever you want it to mean for him
[1:21:03] because prayer is a very personal thing
[1:21:06] you can make it what you want to I've
[1:21:08] heard people say well you shouldn't pray
[1:21:09] like that if you're talking to the Lord
[1:21:12] Jesus God Of Heaven and Earth and that
[1:21:14] is the way you and him communicate I'm
[1:21:16] not here to judge that right right I'm
[1:21:19] not here to uh to criticize you for that
[1:21:21] if you want to this and thousand days
[1:21:23] that's fine just talk to him that's all
[1:21:26] he's looking for just to talk to him
[1:21:28] just the fellowship communion with him I
[1:21:31] wasn't here to tell anybody this is why
[1:21:33] this is how you do it now someone that's
[1:21:36] just a ranked Center and doesn't know
[1:21:37] how you know it's a or what to say uh
[1:21:40] the sinner's prayer then I understand
[1:21:43] that but after a person you get to the
[1:21:46] place you just talk to God yes you just
[1:21:49] talk to him just like he's your brother
[1:21:51] yeah just like he's your uh your your
[1:21:53] best buddy amen you just talk to him say
[1:21:57] God it doesn't have to be eloquent I
[1:22:00] when I pray sin it Saints I'm not
[1:22:02] looking for your approval I'm not
[1:22:04] looking to get some big trophy that says
[1:22:07] best prayer on Sunday morning
[1:22:09] I'm not looking to get some metal that
[1:22:12] says that you know top-notch prayer we
[1:22:15] we rank this man as the top 10 prayer in
[1:22:18] the world today I don't care anything
[1:22:19] about that as long as I'm talking to him
[1:22:22] yes and we're fellowshipping that's all
[1:22:24] I care about and I'm telling you that's
[1:22:27] all he cares about and then that should
[1:22:29] be all that you care about just to talk
[1:22:31] to him you don't have to pray in service
[1:22:33] to impress one another right amen you're
[1:22:36] not you're not here to try to find the
[1:22:39] right words that other people would
[1:22:41] approve up or something you just talk to
[1:22:43] him yes you know and and it just
[1:22:46] something simple yeah amen something
[1:22:49] simple it doesn't have to be blown out
[1:22:52] but God hears amen God hears and God
[1:22:56] responds amen let's go back over to
[1:22:59] Romans real quick
[1:23:01] Romans chapter 5 this time
[1:23:09] Romans chapter 5 for read uh beginning
[1:23:12] with verse one
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:18] let's look at this man was falling
[1:23:21] man man was in the following conditions
[1:23:24] Saints and we know that and I I reckon I
[1:23:27] guess the whole point of my
[1:23:30] um my message today is that we have full
[1:23:34] access to God full
[1:23:38] unfettered access to God yes we do at
[1:23:43] any time
[1:23:44] any
[1:23:45] millisecond of your life
[1:23:48] at any time of the day in any part of
[1:23:51] the world even if you're on the
[1:23:52] International Space Station
[1:23:54] if you're in the middle of a rocket
[1:23:55] going through space if you're on an
[1:23:58] airplane doesn't matter any millisecond
[1:24:01] of your life you can reach God yes we
[1:24:04] have that kind of unfettered access to
[1:24:06] him yes my whole point is to take
[1:24:09] advantage
[1:24:11] take advantage of
[1:24:13] and don't do it to where like brother
[1:24:15] random said well the boy in the prayer
[1:24:17] book he said I just thought of the
[1:24:18] prayer book in the garbage but or I
[1:24:20] think he said fire actually but but
[1:24:23] it's not that God do this do this do
[1:24:26] this and like we're praying or asking to
[1:24:29] change God's mind
[1:24:31] in fact that's very dangerous yes you
[1:24:34] don't believe me ask Hezekiah yeah
[1:24:37] you can't but one day you will how'd
[1:24:40] that go with you
[1:24:42] we don't want him to change his mind I
[1:24:45] don't want God to change his mind even
[1:24:46] if I could do it I don't want him to
[1:24:48] change his mind yeah because this is
[1:24:50] perfect and everything that he
[1:24:53] that says and does for me is going to be
[1:24:55] the best thing that could ever happen in
[1:24:57] my life and I know that again back to
[1:25:02] Faith back to faith believing so I don't
[1:25:05] want to change his mind but Lord
[1:25:08] let my let my will crumble to where your
[1:25:12] will becomes my will amen praise the
[1:25:16] Lord Romans chapter 5 verse one
[1:25:17] therefore
[1:25:19] being justified by faith and what is
[1:25:22] justification
[1:25:23] as if it would never happen in the first
[1:25:25] place amen beautiful isn't it it's the
[1:25:29] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:31] justify by faith we have we have peace
[1:25:35] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] by whom also we have access amen by
[1:25:42] faith into his grace wherein we stand
[1:25:46] and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God
[1:25:48] and not only so but we glory in
[1:25:52] tribulations also knowing that
[1:25:54] tribulations work as patients and
[1:25:57] patience experience and experience hope
[1:26:00] and hope make it not a shame because the
[1:26:02] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:26:04] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:26:07] for when we were yet without Strength In
[1:26:09] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly
[1:26:12] first scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:26:15] one die for it yet for adventure for a
[1:26:17] good man some would even Dare To Die
[1:26:20] but God oh yes
[1:26:23] but but God commended his love toward us
[1:26:28] in that while we were yet sinners Christ
[1:26:32] died for us praise the lord well it had
[1:26:37] to be that way obviously
[1:26:40] because if he waited for us to no longer
[1:26:43] be Sinners to come and die we wouldn't
[1:26:46] have needed him to come and die
[1:26:48] because we would no longer been Sinners
[1:26:50] right
[1:26:52] right amen
[1:26:54] he came and died so that we would no
[1:26:58] longer be Setters right right the only
[1:27:00] way that he could have come and died is
[1:27:03] if we were still in a sinful condition
[1:27:06] right praise the Lord
[1:27:09] he died for us much more than being now
[1:27:12] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[1:27:15] from the Wrath through him
[1:27:18] for if if when we were enemies we were
[1:27:22] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:27:25] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:27:29] be saved by his life now what is that
[1:27:32] reconciling mean
[1:27:34] that reconciling means that were brought
[1:27:36] back
[1:27:37] amen brought back to him through that
[1:27:40] atonement the atonement is something
[1:27:43] that pays the price for something to
[1:27:46] make an atonement to make a restitution
[1:27:48] for amen which they keep talking about
[1:27:52] today in San Francisco and for slavery
[1:27:55] and stuff they want to they want to give
[1:27:57] millions of dollars for restitution or
[1:28:00] reparations to try to make up for what
[1:28:04] happened 300 200 years ago see
[1:28:07] high five I said well why stop there
[1:28:10] once you go back to anyway that's a
[1:28:12] whole different Summit but that's that's
[1:28:14] making an atonement that's a Tony for
[1:28:17] wrongdoing and what
[1:28:20] price could be paid to atone for my
[1:28:23] wrong doing so that I could come back to
[1:28:27] fellowship with God again
[1:28:29] only way is by God's approved sacrifice
[1:28:34] and that was by his only son Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ
[1:28:37] that was the only way it couldn't be
[1:28:40] through the blood of bulls the goats he
[1:28:41] had done thousands and tens and hundreds
[1:28:43] of thousands of animals died all through
[1:28:45] the Old Testament never one time did it
[1:28:48] ever bring him any closer to God but it
[1:28:50] it was acceptable by them to God because
[1:28:54] it was by obedience
[1:28:56] it was obedience to God that they did it
[1:28:59] amen until it became again Isaiah talked
[1:29:02] about it becoming a stink in God's
[1:29:04] nostrils because then it just became a
[1:29:06] formality and it does the same thing
[1:29:08] today if we come to church just because
[1:29:10] it's Sunday morning 10 30. oh I gotta go
[1:29:13] to church now uh
[1:29:15] that's the wrong attitude Saints yes it
[1:29:18] is amen if you wake up and say praise
[1:29:20] God there's church today that's
[1:29:22] different
[1:29:23] there's that desire that pull that Micah
[1:29:26] started our whole service out today that
[1:29:28] oh that pulls us that desire that pulls
[1:29:33] us that that that motivates us it's God
[1:29:36] it's God's motivating us to him
[1:29:42] praise the Lord
[1:29:46] amen being reconciled now brought back
[1:29:49] now that reconcile the atonement paid
[1:29:52] the price the reconciliation brought us
[1:29:55] back because that what so reconcile
[1:29:58] means when two people were separated and
[1:30:03] argument whatever it is
[1:30:05] spouse children family friends people
[1:30:09] fight people argue there's contention
[1:30:12] but when you reconcile you come back
[1:30:14] together again
[1:30:16] no more chasm
[1:30:18] there's no more disagreement or the
[1:30:20] disagreement has been bridged
[1:30:23] you understand between two people they
[1:30:26] separate because of disagreement because
[1:30:28] of fight or whatever it is
[1:30:31] there's something from between those two
[1:30:33] people that now separates them
[1:30:37] but there's got to be something happen
[1:30:39] that either bridges that Gap
[1:30:41] amen whether it's love or or
[1:30:44] understanding or or forgiveness or
[1:30:47] whatever it is
[1:30:49] something's got to bridge that Gap
[1:30:51] amen I
[1:30:53] best thing I know is forgiveness love
[1:30:55] and forgiveness bridges that Gap
[1:30:57] who love and forgiveness Bridge any Gap
[1:30:59] if it's the right kind of love
[1:31:02] or the gap's just gone you say well you
[1:31:04] know I see it the way you do now brother
[1:31:06] I I understand it I see it I agree
[1:31:08] that's the way it should be that's and
[1:31:10] you're in full agreement then there's no
[1:31:12] more Gap
[1:31:14] amen amen but love and forgiveness even
[1:31:17] if there is a gap between brother and
[1:31:18] sister whatever it is even if there is a
[1:31:20] gap you can bridge that Gap with love
[1:31:23] and understanding forgiveness Amen to
[1:31:25] bring back together again that's how you
[1:31:27] reconcile
[1:31:29] even well that's what Jesus Christ did
[1:31:31] for us Saints amen as long as this world
[1:31:35] is going that that Chasm will continue
[1:31:37] to exist
[1:31:39] because if it no longer existed then
[1:31:41] everybody would be saved
[1:31:43] there would be no gap between God and
[1:31:45] man
[1:31:47] every human would be safe but not every
[1:31:50] human can be saved narrow is the way
[1:31:54] that leads
[1:31:56] that's that bridge
[1:31:57] that's that Bloody bridge that takes you
[1:31:59] from where you are where you were
[1:32:01] hopefully uh to Jesus Christ again
[1:32:05] to me to reconcile to bring it back
[1:32:08] together again I believe in
[1:32:11] and recep God forgive me so love
[1:32:13] forgiveness and understanding bridges
[1:32:15] that gap between God and man
[1:32:18] praise the Lord now we can reconcile
[1:32:20] again to Jesus we can reconcile back
[1:32:23] again to God and have the same
[1:32:25] relationship
[1:32:27] to have the same relationship
[1:32:29] now again it's not going to be exactly
[1:32:31] like Adam because there's sin still here
[1:32:33] we're still in sin trapped in these sin
[1:32:36] bodies but any moment at any time God
[1:32:39] leads you God guides you God directs you
[1:32:41] he said he'd never leave you or forsake
[1:32:43] you he is always with you you speak to
[1:32:46] him you talk to him you fellowship with
[1:32:48] him amen he's always there he's always
[1:32:52] listening that access is full and
[1:32:54] unfettered since
[1:32:55] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[1:32:59] his life and not only so but we also joy
[1:33:02] in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:33:04] whom we now have received the atonement
[1:33:08] amen receive that atonement the price
[1:33:11] has been paid Jesus Christ paid that
[1:33:13] price at Calvary to redeem us back to
[1:33:16] him
[1:33:18] amen Hebrews uh you can go read
[1:33:21] Ephesians chapter 2 I was going to read
[1:33:23] Ephesians chapter 2 we'll skip that amen
[1:33:26] you go back and read this Jesus we are
[1:33:29] once Ephesians chapter 2 is one of my
[1:33:31] favorite chapters in the Bible
[1:33:33] I really enjoy Ephesians one and two for
[1:33:36] two is
[1:33:37] one's how do you pick one or the other I
[1:33:41] like I really enjoy Roman uh Ephesians
[1:33:43] chapter 2. we are once lost in and dead
[1:33:48] in our sin
[1:33:50] but now after the reconciliation through
[1:33:53] the atonement of his blood we've been
[1:33:55] brought back to now we are dead to sin
[1:34:00] amen amen because when we joined
[1:34:03] ourselves back with Jesus Christ the sin
[1:34:06] is now gone
[1:34:08] the death that the unbelief is now gone
[1:34:12] amen from us to God
[1:34:15] remember we're separating the physical
[1:34:17] from the spiritual
[1:34:19] physically you're still alive absolutely
[1:34:21] physically you're not dead no but
[1:34:24] spiritually
[1:34:26] it's been brought back and now in us
[1:34:29] there's no more sin
[1:34:31] there's no more doubt there's no more
[1:34:33] unbelief remember we've went through
[1:34:34] this first John chapter 3
[1:34:37] amen when that seed remaineth in there
[1:34:39] there's no more uh there's no more sin
[1:34:43] can no more be sin
[1:34:46] do we still do things wrong makes sakes
[1:34:48] absolutely but in here there's no more
[1:34:50] sin
[1:34:51] God's living in there God if God were in
[1:34:54] there with sin then God is a sinner
[1:34:56] but he can
[1:34:59] the only reason that we in the can exist
[1:35:01] on this planet is because we're in these
[1:35:04] bodies
[1:35:05] that's the only way that's why when
[1:35:07] these bodies give away our spirit we're
[1:35:10] we're gone our soul is with God Amen
[1:35:12] because it was him to begin with
[1:35:15] that's how we're eternal
[1:35:17] is it's God to begin with it's his
[1:35:20] attribute
[1:35:22] praise God
[1:35:24] once we were dead in sin
[1:35:27] now we're dead too
[1:35:29] sins and trespasses they'd have no more
[1:35:31] relationship with us
[1:35:33] you know when people say oh he's dead to
[1:35:35] me
[1:35:38] sin is dead to me
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] we are separated
[1:35:44] Hebrews four let me close with this
[1:35:47] Hebrews 4 chapter chapter 4 verse 14.
[1:35:53] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:35:55] priest that is passed into the heavens
[1:35:59] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[1:36:02] our profession
[1:36:04] don't wait for them
[1:36:06] hold fast to that profession I profess I
[1:36:09] am a Christian
[1:36:10] I profess I believe Jesus Christ to be
[1:36:13] the Son of God and My Savior My Lord my
[1:36:16] God hold to that profession
[1:36:19] amen don't let Satan take it from you
[1:36:22] for we for we have not an high priest
[1:36:25] which cannot be touched by the feeling
[1:36:27] of our infirmities which again the
[1:36:29] double negative means he is a high
[1:36:31] priest that you can touch right amen I
[1:36:35] like I hear people say I can't do
[1:36:37] nothing
[1:36:38] well you know what that means you can do
[1:36:41] something
[1:36:41] because can't do nothing means well if
[1:36:44] you can't do nothing that means you can
[1:36:45] do something
[1:36:46] right they say I can't do nothing well
[1:36:49] that just means you can do something
[1:36:51] then
[1:36:52] because the double negative cancels
[1:36:53] itself and makes it a positive
[1:36:56] no praise the Lord let's see even when
[1:36:58] Satan tries to do that God turns it
[1:37:00] around makes it for his good amen he can
[1:37:04] be touched by the feeling of our
[1:37:05] infirmities
[1:37:06] but was in all points tempted like as we
[1:37:09] are yet without sin Let Us therefore

[1:38:01] maintain that relationship
[1:38:03] he went through all of that to bridge
[1:38:06] that Gap that Chasm that Bloody bridge
[1:38:09] for that Chasm for man and God to come

[1:38:27] yes full unfettered accidents I've heard
[1:38:31] of places you think one of the most
[1:38:33] infallible things in this country today
[1:38:35] is to pick up now Dom 9-1-1 you're going
[1:38:38] to get some live person there that's
[1:38:40] going to be attending to your need I've
[1:38:42] heard today there's places that they've
[1:38:44] called and they've put you on hold
[1:38:48] it had gotten that bad amen or the
[1:38:51] police just don't show up at all
[1:38:53] sometimes
[1:38:54] sometimes you know
[1:38:56] I I I I need them here well you know
[1:38:58] they're over here because
[1:39:01] 10 people just killed or
[1:39:03] whatever it might be yeah sin has gotten
[1:39:06] to the place used to be when I first
[1:39:08] started driving if your wheels didn't
[1:39:11] come to a complete stop at a stop sign a
[1:39:13] cop saw you he'd give you a ticket yeah
[1:39:15] yeah now people blow through lights and
[1:39:17] signs that goes on it oh you're hardly
[1:39:19] there right

[1:39:24] the road and people just go right
[1:39:25] through the stop sign and do a thing
[1:39:27] about it
[1:39:28] you know
[1:39:30] a person go 10 10 15 miles an hour to
[1:39:33] spend them they let them go why because
[1:39:35] they're looking for the one going 30 and
[1:39:36] 40 over the speed limit
[1:39:39] it's gotten that bad
[1:39:43] God at any time
[1:39:45] remember what brother green taught us I
[1:39:47] think I I asked brother Green's
[1:39:49] permission to put it in my book

[1:39:59] 9119 and 9-1-1
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:03] I I even researched the history of 9-1-1
[1:40:06] and when it first came into being in the
[1:40:09] first 9-1-1 call and all that it's that
[1:40:12] call that we can make any time to go
[1:40:14] right we don't have to worry about
[1:40:16] dotted numbers we don't have to worry
[1:40:18] about a busy signal we don't have to
[1:40:19] worry about call waiting we don't have
[1:40:21] to worry about call forwarding or just
[1:40:23] Direct

[1:44:48] something was said to bless and
[1:44:49] strengthen the Lord today and again if
[1:44:52] there's anything that
[1:44:55] tried to get across today is let us take
[1:44:58] advantage of that amen take advantage of
[1:45:01] that
[1:45:02] opportunity that privilege to be able to
[1:45:05] reach out and touch the Lord Jesus
[1:45:08] I know it sometimes maybe easier when
[1:45:12] you're doing things
[1:45:13] because I know a lot of times at work
[1:45:16] and something's just not going right and
[1:45:18] I said Lord just help me or when
[1:45:22] something gets completed really well I'm
[1:45:24] like thank you Lord I went together so
[1:45:26] good you know it's just those little
[1:45:29] things yes
[1:45:30] yes don't think for a second he doesn't
[1:45:32] hear that yes amen don't that that means
[1:45:37] something
[1:45:38] amen it means something praise the Lord
[1:45:41] God is there we just Reach Out And Touch
[1:45:44] him amen and praise the Lord God bless
[1:45:47] you appreciate each one of you being
[1:45:48] here if you're watching God bless you
[1:45:50] and pray something was said the bless
[1:45:51] and screen to you again today and the
[1:45:54] Lord Jesus take that opportunity that
[1:45:56] privilege that he's given us Amen to
[1:45:58] reach out to him he's here he's always
[1:46:01] with you never leaves or forsakes
[1:46:04] and I haven't had a chance to talk to
[1:46:06] Craig about the place behind here
[1:46:08] hopefully Lord willing I'll get to talk
[1:46:09] to him uh this week about that and I
[1:46:13] have been told
[1:46:15] uh by
[1:46:18] a couple of people that Mother's Day is
[1:46:20] probably not a good time to have the
[1:46:22] lunch which I fully understand makes
[1:46:24] sense just you know
[1:46:26] and I didn't necessarily mean that had
[1:46:29] to be that day I thought well if if it
[1:46:31] was available we could because the
[1:46:33] restaurants were busy but
[1:46:35] um but just around that time in the next
[1:46:38] month or so that's kind of what my
[1:46:40] mindset is and what I'm thinking so if
[1:46:42] anybody has the opinions or feelings uh
[1:46:45] it may change if the facility back here
[1:46:49] is uh open to us and we're able to use
[1:46:52] it and it's uh the configuration I
[1:46:54] haven't seen them so I don't know if the
[1:46:56] configuration inside them I mean they're
[1:46:58] all different some were open like this
[1:47:01] was wide open when I got here and some
[1:47:03] you know like next door was water but
[1:47:06] this one over here had like eight
[1:47:08] offices in it they had to tear all that
[1:47:10] out just to make a room and stuff like I
[1:47:13] don't know what the configuration is but
[1:47:14] if it works with the configuration and
[1:47:17] we can make it work then we might can
[1:47:19] just get some tables and chairs and have
[1:47:20] it over there
[1:47:21] and that would work great if that worked
[1:47:24] that way so we'll just see trust in the
[1:47:26] Lord just tell me what's on my heart and
[1:47:28] uh hopefully the Lord willing we can do
[1:47:31] something figure something out or I
[1:47:34] really enjoy our time together in the
[1:47:36] fellowship with that so I just trust
[1:47:38] that it's a blessing to you too so just
[1:47:41] pray with me on that if you could and I
[1:47:43] know the Lord will make a way amen amen
[1:47:46] I know the Lord will make a way so God
[1:47:49] reaches the bless you appreciate your
[1:47:50] prayers good to be back home amen pray
