Norma's supposed to be on her way she said she would be late I haven't heard from Sister Matisse but even it's good to have each one of us here today thankful that brother Danny's with us and then you notice he looks like a prize fighter just got beat up last night [Music] see a little bit more praise the Lord did you get both of them done I've been asked that question it's hard enough yeah all at the same time that's what I thought I didn't think they ever did two at once and I couldn't stand corrected but I figured they just didn't one at a time but glad to have him with us he had surgery this week as we let you all know but it came through well he's doing good and then she just heard this testimony I thank the Lord blessed him so amen any other prayer request yes for the dentist um the other day I went to Costco to get some new glasses and the young man while he's he's your age the man that waited on me says you know I know you I said you do yeah my name is Jonathan Milano oh okay and um and now if we're talking about his dad and his daddy in fact baptized me at Tucson Tabernacle and um and I could tell as we were talking I says you know brother Milano was the first one to introduced me really sorry teaching me about the message in the Bible and the word of God and I could tell he he was very respectful but just like my children that were raised in the message yes you can tell that they're they're not serving the lord and I'm going to want to remember God said and um like I said he's about to your age yeah and um and my kids and all our our children that are not serving the lord amen because I believe the hour is very late yes sir brother amen yes sir and thank you very much I haven't been called a young man in a while so I appreciate that although some people out they see me and still say that and I'm like how are you oh I'm 53. uh okay I'm 56 I'm almost 57 but thank you anyway I'll take it it comes from clean living that's me and my wife sometimes they'll come and see oh look so clean living just don't smoke don't drink live your life right makes a big difference and the grace of God of course oh remember that request I remember brother Anthony when I first started playing the drums at the Tabernacle back in the early 2000s and back in the back room and Anthony had his trumpet and he he was uh he was never short of words but he always had something good and positive to say yes and it was nice to know brother Anthony a little he passed we were up in the mountains so but it was good to know him that little time I did so remember that family anyone else my assist Patricia to come in with you I just had a praise report we'll do those after okay Mike has got one too so amen oh yeah I'm sorry I thought it was appraise you know uh not yet anyway um just what uh uh was it two weeks ago um I had a migraine here in church and I don't know what's going on other than just Satan hitting me uh some of you all right remember brother or sister Pat and maybe even sister Norma might have been in the service in the mountains when I was in high school and because I had a migraine almost every day and I got paid for it and they stopped for some reason the past five or so weeks every Monday I'll get one just on Monday I don't know why um and then but for some reason that Sunday I also had one that I had on the back I don't know what's Satan's doing or I think he's just not because I I always have the testimony that the lord always heals me enough that I can come to church amen am I post a duty so maybe he's just trying to keep me out of work now so y'all could just remember me in prayer yes praise the Lord remember me too I'll be flying out again this afternoon uh going back to Minneapolis Friday is supposed to be 10 and for a low and 18 for a hot home and snow Monday Tuesday and Wednesday not huge snows but just you know half inch inch at a time or something but it's going to be pretty chilly so I appreciate your prayers of that it's not something we're normally used to here I've got plenty of warm stuff so it's not a huge deal and a lot of what we do is inside it's not necessarily heated but it's inside so it shouldn't be too bad but again I appreciate your prayers safe traveling also thank you for that anyone else real quick even unless I'll stand if we could have been in good seeds one of you that's come here today and been with us just that time of year seems like uh I don't know why it seems like when the weather changes and the temperature changes and uh just people just keep getting getting hit I still had this stuff in my chest I can't seem to get rid of for some reason this deep stuff in there I'm just keep trying to cough out but it just don't want to come out but God has already touched me and healed Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads in unison of the faith and the love that you bestowed upon us yes Lord and we approach your throne of grace and mercy with faith and believing that your word will never fall short knowing that as you the Bible even says that you who cannot lie that whatever you promise to your children you will bring it to pass yes Lord and father we are living in such perilous times and and such uh late hour unless you speak to our hearts we are going to miss it oh we are going to be left behind yes even James who spoke so bluntly and so profoundly said he that keepeth the whole law that he had offended at one point he is guilty of all it is not what we can do even if the sisters grow their hair and they don't wear makeup and don't identify with the world if there's something in the word that they're not obeying father they'll keep keep us out in US Brothers Lord taking our place as leaders in the family if we think that we're doing good coming to church and paying our tithes that's not it it's serving you it's letting you have complete control of Our Lives Lord you said he hasn't begun a good work well completed till that day and father help us to recognize we have one chance father to make it we have one time on this Earth let our lives count at all times for you let us live a life that's worthy of this Gospel of Jesus Christ yes Lord I heard your Prophet a couple of days ago he says some people will refuse to read the Bible but it is up to us to be written Bibles amen that their blood won't be uh in our hands that they'll see that Christ is alive in our lives and father that's even important as we approach your throne of grace yes Mercy with them that need a healing touch you paint it in full at Calvary you said it is finished amenities paid in full and father we call you on the scene now each and every one that's sick that need a healing touch father for you I'm mindful of each request that was spoken even our pastor who's still dealing with this congestion oh Father you are high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed yes you are father we believe by faith a total delivered for each and every one that needs to touch from you yes may that's testimonies wrote forth that you're truly the same yesterday today and forever and with this lateness that is upon us in your Communists knocking at the door we claim our loved ones they are not saved the ones that know better that hurt the gospel refused to line up father um it's like uh Billy Graham used to coach your word so often um that he is often repute reproved is harder to snack to suddenly be destroyed joy and that without remedy and father your spirit won't always strive with man but we have a promise we claim our children yes yes we claim all our friends amen we claim our neighbors we claim everyone father for your kingdom and father bless the remainder of the service use our brother to speak to our hearts and may our hearts be open to receive your word this morning in your name we pray name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen Lord you could be seated if you like amen praise the Lord want to hear Sister Teresa's testimony you got there on the exact month and since then I have not had absolutely no pain on my kids amen amen and also praise the Lord and also I was supposed to have my one of my thyroid glands being moved and the doctor said what did you what did you take did you take something um [Applause] I was like I was so happy that you had the leading of God to call us for those that weren't really good amen and I was so happy I'm like I need prayer I really said I was the Lord I know it was for me amen amen well I don't know if you remember but two three people came up and we had prayer and I kept filling that press on my heart to keep pulling but after I pray for you and Grace that day it went away so God knows not that all of the prayers including myself get touched but amen God's touched God's good isn't he don't tell me Miracles aren't still happening amen just cause brother Brown's not here doesn't mean Miracles stop and I think they were so prominent with brother Brandon because they were all in one individual but now you hear them and and they happen and they happen here and they happen there and how many times in this church have we had Miracles my daughter couldn't carry her child if God had healed her of that autoimmune she wouldn't have the strength to do it God touched and healed her sister Julie each I mean we could just go on and on the Miracles in God and when you do this when you hear the doctor have to say there's nothing wrong with you when you hear a doctor say you've got a new muscle in your foot or new tendon like my wife when the medical field has to acknowledge something supernatural has taken place even though they don't understand it oh praise the Lord God's good amen God is so good amen bless and Lord amen God bless you uh this song was requested um by Sister Norma who's not here and so maybe she'll walk in it um but anyways it's being recorded recorded too so [Music] if you I think most of you know both of the songs appropriate sing along [Music] I have seen some pretty towns I guess you can say but I've been around without no place to settle down there is amen though I'm just a pilgrim here world of fears my time [Music] amen there is [Music] there is [Music] equal just not myself [Music] waiting on that show there is a land and it's not enough [Music] there is nothing noise amen [Music] [Music] there is a man again for our country to which our names before no sad goodbye amen sometimes [Music] and some days [Music] where my voice [Music] please [Music] to where my face is [Music] foreign [Music] God I bought before and some days [Music] before [Music] and someday I'll Stand where our homes [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] someone else have a testimony of mine no wonder it's on that it's just normal um last week I know we all have pressures and stress and anyway that's the way it was last week it seemed like it was coming from different directions so and uh I like to make myself sick or the devil may be sick already and I was driving on the freeway and well um I'll back up a little bit I was driving a Valencia Princess and the song I heard that song it was caused when I think and I'll tell you I was praising the Lord amen that Spirit broke and I had my hand up and I was just screaming hallelujah amen so that song that brother like a song saying just now everybody praise the Lord amen yes thank you Jesus amen praise God we spoke the words and it happened just like that I saw it he spoke the word of God she walked in the door amen show up during this song I thought the same thing yeah I thought the same thing I kept looking at that door knowing that she was going to come in in a second that's exactly what happened the scripture said I'm going to prayer place for you it's a New Jerusalem New World New Heaven new Earth it wasn't so I would tell you amen amen praise the Lord is it yes sir it's the truth it's the truth thank God Amen anybody else I just want to thank the Lord for being able to go with my cousin to Wyoming and visit family up there um my cousin Liz suffered a stroke she's still and she is doing it's just going out a lot better she was so happy that he wanted to visit her she's in a wheelchair her husband takes care everyone who's just um a godly man amen this is wonderful but I just want to thank the Lord church with the senator gosh um for some reason my cousin I told the pastor that we were going to sing because then I haven't sang together for 20 some years it was a blessing um people were very very nice there I just want to thank the Lord for taking medicine amen they all knew about Father Brown is a minister actually my physical Ministry yeah I had asked the sisters to pray for me so that I could be a testimony good and everything was positive that they said and I just thank the Lord for that praise the Lord amen I claim them all wonderful glory to God I don't even know if there's a message Church up I know Idaho my that's wonderful praise the Lord God has children everywhere it doesn't amen praise the Lord anybody else explosion if you do good to be in the house presence amen let's stand to our feet if we're good amen I'm gonna go in the scripture Genesis chapter one we're going to start back Lord will where we left off last time we want to start getting into the Millennium I um uh last time I mentioned that uh one kind of sort of overlaps into the other and this will probably take a couple of services uh just afterward leads but the holidays coming up and everything happening and the you know time frames the way they work out you never know what the Lord's going to do and Thanksgiving and Christmas and so but um we'll just however he leads that's what we want to do but as I looked into continue to look you know as I kind of thought it would but um that it would probably take a couple of services really uh it's strange because um well we'll just we'll read the scripture and let you be seated in and there so uh Genesis chapter 1 verse one and two we're going to read as we do in this uh series we've been doing here on the new beginning this will be the new beginning part 10 so let's just buy our heads for word of prayer if we could word so thankful father again Lord of uh we could just read a scripture and close a book and go home Lord just of what you've done for us Lord the testimonies and the spirit and God just knowing you to be so real with us yes Lord we thank you so much and I I guess sometimes we get in the attitude of the spirit of thinking that there's got to be hundreds or thousands in a service to make a service Lord but as service is me and you yes it is that's a little group here Lord each one of us me and you us and you Lord we're here God to worship you to praise you and thank you God for so many things you've done for us Lord and the Miracles that you've done in our lives the healings the supernatural healings Lord and and miracles God that you've done for us Lord you never cease you're always with us Lord you promise to be you with us and God we give you thanks and praise Lord for this service for this time for each one that have come Lord and again for those who may be streaming just pray that your Holy Spirit would have the remaining power of this service Lord in the palm of your hand and do what you feel necessary speak to our hearts the word should have us to hear and help that word that it would draw us closer to you Lord and more like you more in your image father to become more like that word because that's who you marry Lord you marry the word because you are the word and the bride is the word and the word bride together we make a union of word we thank you Lord that we could be accounted as a part of that group lord it's a part of that uh uh that that Bride for this last day Lord we know the time is imminent we know we can see things around us taking place Lord but more than anything we feel that pulled and recognize there's something within our innermost being that's calling to us pulling us closer to you Lord drawing us into that place it's that image into that that that venue Lord that we're ready to go home to be with you looking for our loved ones our loved ones that have gone on to appear before first at any time Lord we just pray again take control of the remaining part of us or speak through these lips word should have us to hear anointed here as well Lord it'll be all glory honor and praise to you we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you like thank you I mean as I was saying uh the Millennium is a very unusual thing because the actual word Millennium is kind of like the word rapture it does not show in the scripture uh the actual word Millennium is not in the scripture it's taken from a Thousand-Year period is a millennium and when it talks about a thousand year period in the in in Revelation we type that to uh Millennium just like we do when it talks about a catching away or a catch-up we talk about uh a Rapture being raptured or enraptured out of this world out of these bodies into a new life well the Millennium is a lot the same way but even unlike a Rapture uh there's very little spoken of scripturally about the Millennium a lot of things that have derived in the thought of a millennium is either in the scripture or is typed through the scripture in what is going to take place in the Millennium and a lot of what brother Branham talked about when it referred to the Millennium was as such it was something that brother random looked it was scriptural there or it was something that brother random looked as types and shadows and things to recognize to roll over to that place we spoke a little bit about Millennium we went through the feast days of the Jews and the Feast of the Tabernacles the trumpets Tabernacles and even into that eighth day which is actually even beyond the Millennium but include but the Millennium includes or encompasses a period of time uh and in in some ways and I probably will today maybe the next time we speak on this whenever that would be next service or whenever that it would Encompass uh some things that brother random said uh there are some things that brother random said in his early Ministry that he changed in his later Ministry about the Millennium uh and maybe the Lord willing will will get into some of those things maybe not but we can recognize a lot of the things that we see based on what the scripture says and of course an inspired prophet of God through the word of God to speak to us to help us understand what is about to take place now um you know politics and religion a lot of times fall hand in hand you got Kings and the elections and things and I won't get into the election but I will say that to me and what brother Dennis was uh uh was expounding on a little bit uh kind of spoke to me this week um this election it kind of made me believe in looking at it uh just for a minute that uh this country could get to it just about any place that it could get to and the people will still continue to allow the people that got it there to stay in power and it's baffling to me I don't understand it outside of the fact that we know what's going on we know the time we live we know what the scripture says and we know where we're headed uh and I'll just leave it at that but it sure helped me understand because you know it kind of goes back to uh Einstein actually I think it was Einstein uh I actually said this years ago and didn't even know Einstein said it uh just by inspiration Lord put it on my heart that people beat their head against the wall hoping to try to have a change in their life when they don't do anything different with their lives yeah you can't expect your life to change if you don't do anything different with your life if you want to change you got to make a change you got to be the change you got to change yourself so that things change in your life that's the only way change can come is that when a change takes place and uh for people to expect or to Hope but change to take place and do nothing about it or continue as we would say status quo to me is just unfathomable I I don't understand that if you want things to change you got to do something to make a change right if you don't do anything to make a change nothing's going to change uh hence the world that we live in today but I think God even if all this happening God will continue to take care of his children yes God will continue to bless us God will continue to provide for us God will continue to make a way for us even if we have to sit at the dinner table and speak that food into existence right God will still Make A Way always has always does is is righteous never forsaken nor his seed begging bread right he will take care of his own he always says has always will be now the last service that we spoke and I apologize for last week uh I got home and one of the first things I got in the car didn't even get home one of the first things I told my wife I don't think she wanted to hear it but I told her I said if this happens I'm not I'm quitting I'm not going to do that job if it interferes with church right I know the lord gave me that job and it was a fluke um and circumstances the way they worked out uh it'd take a long time to explain everything that happened and how everything devolved in that day but when I was in the middle of of basically scraping the bottom of the barrel to get here on Saturday night Sonia my wife text me uh in the middle of all this and said these people are gone these people aren't feeling well this is going to be just a few people this hadn't yelling I thought okay I'm gonna quit fighting this so hard and I'm just gonna let the Lord do whatever he's doing right and just allow this to happen and I scheduled a flight to come in on Sunday instead of trying to kill myself and do whatever everything to get it every single turn um and you know how subtle the Lord is and how he guides us and leads us he doesn't Force us right but when you get to a certain place you think okay and then the door slammed and you get over to another place and the door slams you think okay these doors aren't slamming by coincidence something's going on here if you're a child of God you recognize something else is going on yes right so but anyway that being said I do I apologize for uh the service last week it it grates on me hard I feel like I hadn't been Church in months uh I hate that feeling but uh I'm glad you're here today the Lord bless you apologize for that the Lord whatever whatever weight of time or eternity proves out why that happened last week I I don't know whatever it is then uh to him be all the glory so but when we hear last time we spoke on Armageddon we basically mostly hit the highlights didn't delve into it too deeply but to move on from uh the Armageddon uh we recognize we enter into the place of the Millennium after Armageddon the Millennium sets in after Armageddon so let's go back to the scripture again and re-reference what we spoke about last time just for a refresher for a few minutes um I'm not so as much pressed for time today I got a little bit more time I don't have to rush out too fast this afternoon but let's go back to Revelation chapter 19. um and let's let's uh let's start back there where we left off as we transitioned from Armageddon to the millennium I want to read a few extra scriptures that we didn't read last time as well so uh that'll help us bring us into that place so Revelation chapter 19 let's just start um let's start with verse five and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his Saints and ye that fear Him both great and small and I heard as it were the voice of great multitude as the voice of many Waters the voice of a mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigning let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready no longer bride but wife has made herself ready amen and to her was because this is another time period this is another time frame we'll talk about this in a minute how the transitions of time and and spaces of time God transitions you see in the scripture and this is one of those transitions uh just like in natural life when a when a a couple uh transition from uh just a mere relationship to an engagement to uh to a wedding to a wedding uh to a a wedding supper uh reception to a marriage uh from being a bride to a wife that's a transition that takes place because this is a different period of time we've moved into and eighth verse now and to her and we'll talk about that in another light even with Christ and just uh Lord will if we have time today and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in Finland and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb praise the Lord the marriage supper of the Lamb we know that's just for the bride amen it's the marriage supper of the lamb now remember Jews are not a part of the marriage supper because it's the marriage supper of the Lamb they are there they were his they were Jehovah's wife we're talking about uh Jesus bride now and the marriage supper of the lamb at this time the Jews have yet to recognize even their Messiah as him being Jesus Christ or the Lamb of God okay so this is just for the Gentile bride the Rapture that takes place for the Gentile goes to that marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God amen and I for maybe I shouldn't say to you I feel checked about that not necessarily not Jews but those who accepted Christ as their savior it could have been Jew but accepted Christ as their savior so uh I hope for some reason I felt checked to say that so it's it's uh it's also it's all those that receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord right so and I fell on his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and I saw heaven open amen now we've gotten toward to the to after the uh after the Rapture after the marriage supper the reception we've gotten to a place now at the end of that remember the end of the end of Armageddon the end of the three and a half years the time that the Jews the the spirit of God goes back to the Jews the time that the Jews recognized their Messiah and that uh that Gathering Place that they've come to they recognize their Messiah all of this accumulates the end of Armageddon the end of tribulation all this accumulates at the end here it all gathers together just as it says from the four corners of the earth it all it all comes together to a head here and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war in contrast to Revelation 6 who who the writer of that white horse is Satan in his deceptive hypocrisy amen which is transitions from White Horse to Red Horse to Black Horse to Pale Horse amen remember say all satan does is to uh impersonate God everything he does he himself transitions see Jesus now this way or truth faithful and true in righteousness he does judgment War his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself remember that name brother brother green talked about that brother Brandon mentioned said that he would never tell him see something that was never that would never be mentioned now and brother greens took that to the Grave with him so brother Brown did amen but we'll know we'll know one day yes amen and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called is called the word of God it isn't the word of God but it's called the word of God and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses that is us out from that marriage supper now following him upon white horses uh the Purity Holiness and power that is behind uh the saints of God behind him and with him remember um and we may have time to get to this today but remember when when uh when Peter spoke up and Jesus exhorted him and said blessed art thou Simon by John for flesh and brothers not revealed but my father in Heaven's room and Upon This Rock the Revelation I'll build my church hello that's you and me the bride of Christ built upon the Revelation who Jesus is and to thee I give the keys to Kingston of Heaven whatever you loose on earth is loot Down in Heaven what is that that is the power and authority that God has given by his uh uh by his word and will to not just Peter but to those that were built upon that Revelation Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ now she has that he comes out on the White Horse what is that that's the Holiness and purity of white on the power the the power of that horse Amen to each one of those horses the horse in the scripture represents a power amen and each one of the Bride now is on one of those horses with that power speak it's a key amen that's what I want to get to a little bit later it's that key amen so let's move on um and he was closed with investor dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean but we can find out who that is because we just read it over here in the eighth verse and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean white and clean amen that's her that's Us Praise the Lord and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treaded The Wine Press of the fiereness fierceness and the wrath of almighty God and he hath on his Vester and on his thigh name written king of kings and Lord of lords now I want to explore just for a moment that as we talked about in Fairly good detail last time about the sword the uh out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword now we know that the sword is the word of God yes amen but and and there's several places that it talks about that um uh Isaiah chapter 1 is one of those places let me see if I can find it real quick Isaiah 1 20 says this but if you refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword amen you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken let's go to another one second Thessalonians 2 8. look at this now second Thessalonians 2 8 says this and then shall that Wicked Satan be revealed which we know he has remember the purpose of the opening of the seals was what amen are one of the purposes there's multi-purposes to the opening of the seals but what was the one what I consider the one main purpose that the seals were ministered preached revealed it was to expose Satan yes you looked through and everything uh that that is in those seals that was contrary to even how brother Brown preached it the first time where he preached the first time the white red black and Pale Horse was Christ you look in Larkin you see they uh you you go talk to the nominational people if they know anything about the the seals they'll tell you that's Jesus Christ simply because it was a white horse right they'll tell they'll believe that's Jesus Christ but it's not and we know it's not it's safe it's safe continuing to follow the trail of the serpent the trail that Jesus God cursed Satan in the beginning when God cursed Satan he said the dust you will eat and your uh you will bruise the heel of the woman's seed Jesus Christ and he continues to do that as Satan continues to stay on the heel of God perverting as much as he can of what God does and trying to duplicate or replicate or uh make a facsimile of what God does he he tricks people by the deception of that and to those who could be deceived will be deceived but he was exposed in this day the wicked has been revealed we know his tricks we know his devices we know what he does we know how he doesn't why he does it we know everything about it Satan has been fully exposed in this last day through a seventh angel messenger Prophet that brought a word of God to a bride to show her where she is and what she's dealing with amen we know who he is now amen he's been fully exposed he's been unveiled now look that Wicked is revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming amen with the spirit of his mouth what is that well that's the word we just spoke about the word of God that come forth does God speak anything other than his word right well that kind of is a paradox because when he speaks it is his word when he speaks it is the word of God when I speak if I speak of my own accord it's the words of Newton it's no disputing it how dumb or ridiculous it may be sometimes is still the word of mutant but God's word is perfect it's Eternal and when he speaks it is the word of God how could he do anything less he can't how can she his bride who has become the word do anything else as well right when he speaks it's the word so what is coming out of his mouth the spirit of his mouth Revelation 19 is the word he destroys he consumes with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy now look at that word destroyed if you go and look at the word destroyed it does not mean annihilate it does not mean to do away with it needs to render idle that's one of the definitions of this when you look destroy not annihilate it means to render one Idol to make that person incapable of moving of of doing what they normally would do they'd become idle based on the power The Authority the that that that is given that is projected towards this individual or the word of God does that to Satan it renders him completely incapable of doing what he always has done he's idle he can't do it anymore we'll look at that in just a second but now as that word that consumes him come out of the mouth of God the shark sword verse 15 Revelation 19 15 out of his mouth that sharp sword a man that comes forward it's smiting the Nations and of course he even talks about over in the new Heavens when he talks about ruling with a rod of iron he goes from the smity from the controlling to bringing them over into ruling with a rod of iron in the new the in the new city outside the city if you will you will so it's a it's even speaking of that time and a later time a time to come we know this scripture does that many times twofold threefold meaning sometimes that the Lord gives us in his scripture that that speaks that to us amen now let's continue on we keep that in mind as we continue verse 17 and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourself together to the supper of the great God that they may eat the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains and the Flesh of Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and of them that set on them and the Flesh of all men though free and bombo small and great and I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that set on the horse and against his army against us even as that word comes out of his mouth they gathered together Satan gathering together their Armageddon all of his to bring them together to make war against him that settled the horse Christ and his army us and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought Miracles before him uh with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His image these boats were cast alive into the Lake of Fire Burning with Brimstone but not yet this is also speaking in reference to something that's going to happen right amen he gathers them together and he brings him to this place and he renders him idle and takes control over them for the purpose of after the white Throne judgment remember God does not send anybody to a fiery hell until first they've gone through a judgment not even Satan right he has to go through this judgment just like everybody else does all the Angels he has to Lucifer he has to be judged just like the rest of them it hasn't come at this point and we'll continue on the reading and as we continue in this um uh this series uh we'll get to that point but what he's talking about now is taking control over the Beast which is an office and we know it's controlled by Satan but the Beast is in office we know Revelation 17 he was was not was was not is is not uh and continues one dies the next takes his place dies takes place retires takes his place and we know what that office is see so that Beast is in office and it was taken with the false prophet that wrought Miracles and deceived many people now let's look to the 21st verse and the remnant uh were slain with the sword of him that set upon the horse those that were left uh which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fouls were filled with their flesh now notice something that when these the the call to the foul to come was to come and to Feast off of the Flesh of all those that had fallen in their death at this time of Armageddon again blood to the horse's bridle it'll be a it will be and for those who feel like they don't mind being a foolish virgin God help you it will be a bloodbath amen it will be a merciless bloodbath amen it won't just be amen it won't just be Christ his bride and them making War but there are Wars with each other yet still to take place remember through this time is also the Gentile that have to be purged the foolish virgin that go through the tribulation that have to be purged they have to give their lives for their testimony and seal their testimony with their own blood they are murdered they are killed the Jews themselves as well amen notice it's not just Christ and the the hymn and the White Horse and those that are armies that come and slaughtered they will also Slaughter each other I mean look look at this nation let's just take this for an example look at this nation real quick this nation is probably as divided as I think I've ever seen in my life and one of the wholesale ideas that is prominent in this mess in this uh country is is a turn towards a hatred to a true Christian now a religion is also under assault the Christian religion is uh I I thought it was uh pointing it the appropriate Tabitha sin or I saw that she had posted something of this girl that said when I was a Buddhist everybody loved me when I was a uh he didn't do everybody loved me when I worshiped rocks everybody loved me when I did this everybody loved me I was miserable but everybody everybody encouraged me and loved me and and I forgot all it's just uh burning candles and worshiping rocks and I forgot all the things that she had listed that she had done to wickery and demonic spirits and devils and everybody encouraged her and and gave her High Hopes And and tried to increase her and bring her through and then all of a sudden she found Jesus Christ she found the way the truth to life she surrendered herself and sold her out self out to it and now they call her a radical oh you're crazy you've lost your mind you're a radical they were okay when she was a Buddhist they were okay when she was doing all this worshiping rocks and burning candles and and and being a witch and they were okay with all that stuff but as soon as she turned to Jesus Christ they hated her for it right it just shows you the attitude and that was actually uh strategy enough that that's not an allegory that's an actual story that is an actual person's life that printed it or put it out for people to read and as soon as she became a Christian oh you're radical now you're a fanatic just because she became a Christian but you see how divided it is I wouldn't say so but I imagine there's probably a good group of people if they could just destroy or wipe out the other group of people that do it they get rid of them in a heartbeat yeah amen you already hear us up there locking people up for what what are they they're imprisoned and what did they do get they were getting a sandwich at Hardee's what did they do wrong it's it's it's become to that place see so it's not just Jesus the bride is going to be a wholesale because see remember the spirit of God is gone when the bride leaves the spirit of God is gone when the spirit of God is gone there's no more love there's no more peace there's no more forgiveness there's nothing of the good attributes of the spirit of God that's left here it'll be nothing but judgment hatred mean angry vile it's getting to that place now but when the bride leaves it'll take full force and you can see what this is going to happen it's going to be a literal bloodbath and an invitation for the fowls to come the Kings the rich men the people in power they are all going to be laid dead in these fouls come and feast off of their bodies now what does that tell you because notice this is just as the Millennium begins to set in because Christ has come and he's brought his bride with him with him and she's there with him amen the Millennium is about to be set up but as this Millennium is about to be set up what has happened in the Earth the Armageddon has killed all those off and has uh carved out a place God has to have his bride and and his 144 000 and the Jew there in the Millennium in the time of a perfect place of a 1 000 year rate now let's go over to let's continue reading in the 20th chapter because I will tell you the the Millennium is not just for the bride the Millennium is for the bride and the 144 000 and for the Jew and we'll get to that in just a minute but let's read here Revelation 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a chain in his hand he has a key now he doesn't have a car key he doesn't have a key like you would have to unlock the door it's not a key like this even though uh you look in our world today look at this country we're getting we're getting further and further away from these um I don't have it on me but my wife probably does now now to unlock or start our car you just got a little mechanism no key you push a button and the car starts you push the thing on the it's called a fob thing on open the trunk open the door snow key but there's something in there that's that makes it a key it's not a physical key that you unlock but it's an ability it's a knowledge it's an authority or power amen this key is an authority it's a power it's not a literal key that you unlock I went uh last time in Minneapolis uh we the last night at the whole at the airport we stayed in the hotel and I didn't want to get in the line of people so I just uh I got the app I checked in online and they give you a digital key yeah I checked in online I went right by the right by the front desk I went up the elevator to my door shook my phone and unlocked my door identity didn't need a key amen didn't need didn't even need a card didn't need anything like that it just transferred that authority to open that door through them to me and I was given the authority through my phone to open that door and to walk in crazy first time I'd ever done it but it's it's getting more and more of that place you don't even need a key but the but the point of the key is it's a point of authority it goes back to the point I tried to make earlier when Jesus gave Peter hence the bride the ability to call the shops if you will whatever you buying on Earth is found in heaven whatever you loose on Earth is loose in heaven see that's an authority that's a key I give to you the key if the key is an authority the angel come down from heaven with the key with the authority amen with control of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand now we know that brother Madam told us that that chain was not a logging chain but it was a chain of circumstance just like the key was not a literal key it was an authority this chain is not a literal chain it is it is a a circumstance it is a it is a linking of abilities to shut one out right or to render them listen if you listen to me earlier to render them idle right if you have a literal chain you can change somebody up handcuffs or zip ties or something or if you have a chain you can wrap you can render somebody physically idle you can render them idle this chain of circumstance renders through the word this man this this serpent this devil Idol he is incapable at this point through the authority given to seal him away to where he has no ability no one to be able to work on he has no way to hinder to buff it or to hurt anyone and at millennial amen he's bound praise God let's read it through and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid a hole on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years he didn't bind him like this he bound him and said uh remember what happened to job amen last service yes what happened to Satan Satan was incapable of getting the joke why because God hadn't bound amen God had him sealed out from being able to touch job or anything he had praise the Lord his family his property his animals his children nobody he couldn't touch him he was sealed yes even when God oh listen this now see even when God is so perfect and why he does things because I'm telling you stuff I didn't even know yesterday but when when God allowed Satan to get to job he stopped Satan by just allowing him to touch the stuff that job had amen even though Satan was allowed to touch his family to touch his his servants to touch his buildings to touch his animals God said don't you lay a hand on job let's see he rendered Satan Idol from being able to do the thing that Satan really wanted to do and that was Destroy job he wanted to get rid of job just as much as he wants to get rid of each of you amen or shall I say he wants to get rid of you as much as he wanted to get rid of job he wanted to destroy him but God said no don't touch him amen praise God so you notice when people and and me as a kid always envisioned that there's this great pit that doesn't have a bottom and this Angel throws Satan and closes the lid and seals this great chain thing and okay you can't come out of there it's not like that at all Satan's still Satan friend even through the millennium the devil's still the Devil he's just been he's just been rendered idle the mouth of the word the of the Lord has spoken it right and that brightness of his coming destroys renders Satan powerless in the Millennium Satan will be powerless now brother random says he'll have no subjects to work in there's something I want to go through the Millennium with you because there's several caveats to it a lot of questions asked one brother Bama really that I could ever find never was able to answer and I can't either but the question came excuse me from several people will there be children born in the millennium because we'll we go back we probably will eventually read in Isaiah and Ezekiel where it talks about the Millennium period and they'll be planning and they'll either the vineyard they'll build a house and they'll live in their house and another won't take it and another one inhabit it and and all the things happen in Millennium and it was asked brother random with children be born in the Millennium he says one place it really looks like they will another place it really doesn't he said to be honest with you all and to let you all know the truth that coming from from me right now he said I don't know and I respect that as much as I respect every perfect scriptural entry every day if you don't know you don't know yeah and the truth is there's a lot of things I don't know and I'll be perfectly honest with you I give you my opinion sometimes on things that may have been sitting out there and my opinion is uh I think there will be not I think they'll be at the original creation but that's just my opinion but brother Brown says he looks like in some places it could now what's he talking about he's talking about scriptural precedent their scriptural precedent that would lead you to believe that in the Millennium there will be children born but there's also other scriptural precedent that would lead you to believe that there won't be children morning he said but I don't know so there's things still there that we just don't know amen there's things that we don't understand we don't know and that's okay we'll take it as it comes I just want to be there that's that's that's what it mainly boils down to I just want to be there but now Satan is Bound for a thousand years how is he bound he's bound because there's no one in the Millennium that period that place that time for him to work in amen but there's got to come something later let's continue to read cast him into the bottomless pit shut him up set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loose for a little season that's getting into the end of what I want to discuss about the millennium because that starts getting us into Gog and Magog and uh something I didn't understand for a long time and that is my understanding of the millennium my understanding originally as a young Christian was the Millennium was going to be like the new Heavens or it's going to be like the the new city it was just uh time and ended and all this and of course is God unfolds that we see what God's done and you know brother Branham said places that the Earth will burn and we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked in the Millennium well that's not true the Earth doesn't burn over till after the millennium amen and if you go in the scripture now I know it says it will burn like an oven but it doesn't say when it doesn't say exactly says a great and Dreadful day of the Lord Malachi that it will burn itself and it will but look at the scriptural reference when it talks about Armageddon it doesn't talk about a burning it talks about fouls coming and consuming people dead people's bodies not burning well if you burn everything often into the atmospheres explode how what is there for the birds to eat so if you look at scripturally amen and and come to what the Bible says about it it really it really opens up to make a lot of sense but you have to I had to lose my old ideas and thoughts of how it was going to be I I had to I had to completely forget because I would be sitting and studying and saying well how's this and this going to happen see but if I just forgot about it and went with a blank slate and said God just show me how it unfolds and read the Scripture it really just makes perfect sense but see when you get something fixed in your mind and you think this is how it's going to be but this but you don't line it up with the scripture you say well then I just need to forget what I thought about it before I just need to forget what my idea was about it before because it was all wrong now what does the Bible say about it amen this is what the word says about it as Christ and his bride come after Armageddon is over the Birds Feast off the foul the fouls Feast off the bodies of the people God set says sets up his Millennium Kingdom right here now as my last thing today it will be a time period of peace be a time period of sanctification it won't it will be a time period that is void of sin there will be no sin in the millennium there will be no sin at the place where God's bride will be resident no sin but there will be sin after the millennium recognize Satan the word says that he has to be loosed for a little season after the Millennium is over amen after the Millennium is over and after the millennium's over at the end of the Millennium when it's over we'll try to cover next time but there's one more thing again before I want that I wanted to get to you before we close here today and that is the fact that this is not just even as Christ and his bride will be here and set that Kingdom up the 144 000 Jews will be in there as well they will be a part of that Millennium now the one thing that really senses it is that when Christ how many knows that Christ came in three three different names three different uh he was Son of God Son of Man son of David amen now when Jesus was here in bodily Corporal bodily form he was son of man prophet when he went away the Holy Spirit came back Son of God but in the Millennium he will be son of David now I know I'm going over that very quickly but uh but my point to get to is that in the Millennium he will be the son of David now let's look at a scripture uh again as I close First Kings chapter one First Kings chapter one there's a promise of God to his people remember the Jew is still his people they're still his people amen he says uh look as high as you can look as far as you can you see the end nope never could I forget my people amen they're always just people there but there had to come a time of uh Gabriel's six-fold Vision that we went through there had to be that time for the Jews that they come to a Reconciliation now First Kings the promise of God chapter 1 verse 30. God said even as I swear unto thee by the Lord God of Israel saying assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so I will certainly do this day now look Solomon did sit on the throne of David right absolutely as the son of David you say that's a fulfillment of that scripture in part but this scripture has a dual purpose as a dual meaning not only is Solomon the son of of David he is the natural son of David but what about the spiritual son of David Jesus Christ is the spiritual son of David let me read you here this is it brother random if he talks about Solomon uh the time of Solomon being basically a millennium time for the Jews in that time no Wars everything was great they had discernment uh Solomon judged well with the people he had God give Solomon favor obviously uh gave him wealth and riches and uh wisdom to judge's people but now he says now we all know that age let me jump down here now how that Hebrews standing there ought to recognize that Solomon had a gift of discernment he could discern the thoughts in their hearts and all rallied around Solomon and yet here stood a greater than Solomon amen a greater than Solomon brother Ram talk about that man that come and uh talk to Jesus or give him the message and didn't realize he's talking to the god of Heaven and Earth amen and went off and left just like he said that Hebrew standard he should have recognized that scene but he said they all rallied around some and yet there stood a greater than Solomon and Solomon was the son of David but he was the Lesser son of David by the flesh Jesus was the son of David by the seed of promise that Royal seed Jesus being the Royal seed of David of Abraham David was was that Royal seed that promised that spiritual see that he would set on the throne of David a word us he said on the throne of David in the Millennium right in the Millennium and we know that those 144 000 Jews will be there and Jesus will be there because they finally recognize their Messiah they finally recognized it with Jesus they finally recognized uh uh him as being their savior and and and they are the ones that make it into that that Millennium that period of time as Jesus sitting on the throne of David as he promised he would as the Royal seed or son of David amen he will be there sitting on that Throne that's the son of David amen now the millennium is a rest period it's a it's a time of breaking the curse of the original sin uh it's a time where we have peace we we don't have the buffeting of Satan and all the spirits and Devils we have to put up with every day amen they will be rendered idle Amen in the Millennium now the next thing I want to get to is when we when we start getting to that end of that thousand year period uh we'll probably get more into the Millennium a little bit like I said we'll probably read a couple of scriptures in Isaiah Ezekiel that talk about uh the Millennium what the Millennium is is is is more or less like and where it goes after that point amen because we get to that point now that we've read through in the scripture where where Satan is loosed for a thousand years now I'll tell you because somebody gave it to me I probably wouldn't have otherwise but um somebody gave me the movie 2012. I think I think I recommend it there's some language in it that uh if you want to bleep it out or something that's up to you but I wouldn't recommend it on the pulpit here but I have seen it and it has two things in it uh and again I'm not I'm not saying you go watch it but I will tell you has two things in it that that actually inspired me one of them was uh it shows the sliding of LA from California into the ocean just like brother Branham said it would slide into the ocean it's actually sliding into the ocean the other thing was I always wondered because after Satan is loosed and we'll talk about this at length next time uh that after the Millennium then Satan's loosed who are these people that come up from the breadth of the earth that surround the city that surround the place the Millennium for us is taking place who are all these people and then I saw that at the end of that movie it gave me an inspiration because in that movie unlike the scripture the world is basically destroyed by water they built these arcs that a few thousand people whatever it was was in those arcs that eight that were able to survive the clanity that went on of as they considered it Armageddon or this flooding of the earth which again is unscriptural but they were able to survive it and live through it and come out on the other side and I thought my you know God is doing this but there's going to be people outside of the millennium that are on the breadths of the Earth this big planet this big rock we live on that are that are there that actually at the end of the Thousand Years and Satan is loosed and able to work his work on those people they start to come up and they want to come and make war again on on those that are in the millennium and of course then God bring fire and brimstone down in in the Earth gets burned over which we'll get into but it it gave some insight to me to to believe that at that point there was a way there there was a way for people to be able to survive Armageddon if you will to live on the breasts of the earth as this time period goes on but Satan is bound remember he can't work and but when he's loosed then it all Breaks Loose again if you will uh but again that's for another service so but I'm I um anxiously awaiting the marriage suffer the Rapture the marriage supper uh the Millennium however we may have or have not got some wrong or right uh through the scripture uh still going to be that wonderful time of peace for the bride amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen God's given us that promise of his word that he's blessed us to be able to be there be at that time yeah to be in in his in his City yes perfect holy righteous A Thousand Years really for the bride just like in the Garden of Eden and you know they had the Garden of Eden there and there was a whole rest of the world that was that was there people in it obviously but there was the Garden of Eden that they lived in for whatever period of time before the fall they lived in that Garden of Eden well that's the bride's going to live in that Millennium whatever it is wherever I believe it'll be in that same place where the city comes up there and Palestine that area but it'll be that time where she lives there a thousand years even plants and builds and but it'll be a time of Peace could you imagine you think I don't want to do any work well just think for a minute how much easier would work be in a theophany body without the without the uh the buffeting of Satan in his head and the Devils all the time coming how much easier is is life going to be yes uh even at that even at that time yes amen is going to be it's going to be uh it's gonna be a wonderful praise the Lord I sing this course Lord prepare me amen it's 3 16. here we go 3 16. [Music] amen Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] tried and true with Thanksgiving [Music] [Applause] [Music] for you let's sing it again to him now yes Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Applause] [Music] tried and true with Thanksgiving [Music] Sanctuary for you amen praise the Lord let your desire Saints Lord help make me more and more a sanctuary for you amen your holy righteous adorned and finely clean and white which is the righteousness of saints which is not our righteousness it's his [Music] name amen God bless you pray something was said today again remember the request the prayer we had amen um my flight leaves about 2 30ish I think it's supposed to so appreciate your prayers for that and through the week also I wanted to ask I know there's just a small contingency of us here this morning but I wanted to ask Christmas Day is on Sunday and I want to see if if uh and you don't have to raise your hand or give input but I would I wanted to put it out if everyone still wanted to have service uh if you're going to be with your families or or what you think you would like to do obviously um service is fine with me of course I have a service that matter if it's Christmas Day or not but if uh if you're gonna if most people are all is going to be with their families or something like that then we could just cancel that service but I wanted to leave it if it's something that uh is a thought to you just give it some thought uh let me know uh if you still want to have service we'll have service uh if everybody's going to be otherwise occupied that's fine too but I just wanted to put it out there and ask so you can let me know when you get a chance and we'll go accordingly there the other thing is came on my heart yesterday I wanted to try and have another dinner uh if we could I'm not exactly sure of any of the parameters or where or when I'd like to do it kind of between Thanksgiving and Christmas if we could which kind of puts it on I think the December 4th maybe and or the 20th something like that uh the Sundays that I'll be home it'll be here after after service is over I think it's December 4th of the 18th fourth and 18th so if you have

people moved out of the place behind us I don't know I don't know if it's even large enough I'm not sure we could all go to a restaurant again if y'all would like to do that that's fine but I'd like to get your thoughts going with that as well so if you have any thoughts towards that any opinions um any thing that comes to mind that you think might work then let me know I'd really like to do it whether whether it's just going to Golden Corral or something again or a different restaurant or whatever that we can do so it's just something that came on my heart again this weekend that I thought about then it's just I think it's actually been almost a year since we've done it we used to do it two or three times a year and I've just been negligent I guess maybe because of the inability to have the space like we used to to have it uh the other thing I wanted to mention is um I was looking at a larger space to maybe move to I'm not sure but just give that some prayer and thought to whatever the Lord's will would be on that it's over on Ruth Roth so I I know a lot of people don't care but I do that I really the thing that itches me about it is being so close to North Side and again I know a lot of people probably don't care anything about that you know those churches don't throw us from each other in the city but that's not the way I like to do so I so anyway but I have been looking so uh not that I necessarily want to move or we have to move from here but uh it's just been something on my heart could have a lot more just twice the size of here twice the money but it's twice the size of here so uh if it's something that works and we can do it then um we'll see so again just something else I like for you to think about pray over and uh we'll just see where the Lord leads itself so Lord bless you think about those things I appreciate everybody's input uh I I'm not the church we are this is our church and your opinion and thoughts and all about it is as important as anybody else's so I want to let you know so let me know I appreciate it and we'll see what we do from there so love the Lord amen God is good to us isn't he so we'll just continue uh see where the Lord leads us from here yeah amen praise the Lord so God rests the fish and again I want to reiterate nothing's changed here I'm not doing that I'm just uh I'm just doing it to see if there's anything else maybe the Lord's trying to do or lead that I don't want to miss anything and if he's opening something changing something moving I want I just want to move with him so he's Craig's not kicking us out there's nothing the rent's not going up there's none of that has changed here so don't worry about that but um uh and so I just wanted to let you know that so amen amen I'd really like to have a little place not a rental uh that we can get and a building actually but anyway so whatever the Lord I you know we're so close to the end may not ever get there but if the Lord's opening something I want to be vigilant to it so so appreciate each one of you God is good amen amen remember to pray for everyone pray for a bride worldwide convicting us to want to also be here to worship you yes thank you Jesus we love you Jesus yes thank you Father we don't know how much uh there was already balancing like you got edge around us already Yes Lord amen thank you Lord Jerome already yes yes blessing
