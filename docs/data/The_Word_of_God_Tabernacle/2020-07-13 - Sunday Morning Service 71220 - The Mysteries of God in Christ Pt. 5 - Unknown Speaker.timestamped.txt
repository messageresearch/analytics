[8:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God
[8:04] richly bless you today amen I want to go
[8:07] into the Bible now on to the scriptures
[8:09] and excuse me I'll start to start our
[8:15] the video recording there so
[8:21] amen and so I want to go to the Bible
[8:23] start with the revelations chapter 10 I
[8:27] want to go back and start back where we
[8:29] had left off before I went back to North
[8:32] Carolina my mother passed away and we
[8:34] had gotten through the mysteries of God
[8:36] in Christ part four I kind of wanted to
[8:39] wait until we were face to face again
[8:42] and then we only had a couple of
[8:44] services of face to face so we're back
[8:47] to here again for right now Lord willing
[8:49] next week we can go back to I hope by
[8:52] the grace of God back to where we're
[8:54] having face-to-face meetings but I want
[8:56] to start back again on the mysteries of
[8:58] God in Christ so this was actually be
[9:00] part 5 and we had laid a good foundation
[9:04] I believe at the beginning for and we
[9:07] kind of touched on highlights of
[9:09] different ones but remember when brother
[9:12] Branham preached amidst the crisis of
[9:14] mystery God revealed he hid three notes
[9:17] that he wanted to get across to the
[9:18] people and remember what those three
[9:20] notes were those three specific things
[9:22] one was that he could reveal himself to
[9:26] his people to that he can have the
[9:28] preeminence in that body of believers
[9:31] and three to restore the kingdom back to
[9:33] its proper position again so as we've
[9:36] hit those highlights when we've gone
[9:37] through the foundation of that as I
[9:40] would say that message and of course
[9:42] others that he hid parts of mainly that
[9:44] one
[9:45] I just titled the mysteries of God in
[9:47] Christ we're going to pick back up again
[9:50] this would be part five but I want to
[9:52] talk today and get more in specific
[9:54] about God revealing himself to his
[9:57] people God revealing himself to his
[10:00] people so if there's going to be a
[10:01] subtitle it will be God revealing
[10:04] himself to his people and remember the
[10:06] last if you can remember the last
[10:09] service the last message we had your
[10:11] part four was about revelation it was
[10:14] about God revealing and the revealing of
[10:16] God in his word to his people and
[10:18] remember brother Ram talked about
[10:21] that we should be praying for revelation
[10:23] in Revelation is more important in our
[10:25] lives and maybe what we realize and
[10:27] those things and going through the
[10:29] scripture and seeing how important it is
[10:31] that revelation come revelation really
[10:35] by the Holy Spirit is what
[10:36] differentiates someone who has the
[10:39] spirit and is getting the spiritual
[10:42] knowledge of the word not a head
[10:45] knowledge of the word versus someone
[10:47] that just has a simple head knowledge we
[10:50] talked about Cain and Abel and and the
[10:52] revelation that Abel had versus Kane
[10:54] wolf the more excellent sacrifice to God
[10:57] God accepted Abel's and rejected Cain's
[11:00] kenya's was a very good fine perfect to
[11:04] the letter sacrifice but it wasn't by
[11:08] revelation and if it wasn't by
[11:10] revelation was according to God's Word
[11:12] that word that Adam spoke I believe to
[11:15] Eve and that hand that story that that
[11:18] trans transferred over to his - to Cain
[11:22] and Abel to one that word to one that
[11:27] message became a revelation to the other
[11:31] it was simple head knowledge it was
[11:34] simple understanding of it not
[11:37] revelation when came at it by revelation
[11:40] he recognized and realized it wasn't
[11:43] just what they had done but it was what
[11:46] good what was acceptable by God as being
[11:50] a revealed truth Cain accepted that word
[11:54] that message from it from Adam as just
[11:58] knowledge just is something as a surface
[12:01] issue a lot of times we look at things
[12:04] and they become surface issues and
[12:06] that's how we learn most of the time
[12:08] that we learn in this country we learn
[12:10] in this world we learn as humans it's
[12:12] all surface issues it's all facts and
[12:16] figures and things like that we look at
[12:18] data and we look at
[12:19] statistics and we look at everything is
[12:21] put in front of us to come up with a
[12:23] conclusion its scientific hypothesis and
[12:28] all those things that we come out we
[12:30] come up with a hypothesis because of
[12:32] facts things that we know information
[12:34] we've been given but that's not the way
[12:36] God operates God created science but God
[12:40] doesn't look to science to prove who he
[12:43] is we don't look to science to
[12:46] understand who he is we look to
[12:49] revelation we look to God revealing that
[12:52] word to us we look to God revealing
[12:54] himself to us once we see that word and
[12:58] once we understand what the revelation
[13:00] is to us then we act upon that
[13:02] revelation and that revelation becomes a
[13:05] part of us that just is that word
[13:07] becomes is that word is revealed and
[13:09] that word becomes revealed or revelation
[13:12] to us and becomes a part of us just like
[13:14] we understand and know who we are as
[13:16] human beings we know who we are in Jesus
[13:19] Christ has got to be by revelation
[13:21] it can't be tangible it's got to be
[13:23] something by faith because faith is a
[13:25] revelation if you just look on surface
[13:28] and say oh Adam and Eve had Botany life
[13:30] and they covered themselves in the fig
[13:32] leaves and okay well then I'll just
[13:33] offer a bottie life sacrifice and
[13:36] that'll be okay but see that's all King
[13:39] had was that surface issue of of
[13:42] knowledge
[13:44] Adam are able heard it and he heard what
[13:48] was acceptable to God was what God did
[13:51] in the Garden of Eden and what it took
[13:54] to be to be pleasing to the Lord and it
[13:57] was revealed to him as a son of God
[13:59] through Adam as he son of God what the
[14:02] truth really was and he offered to God
[14:04] that blood sacrifice that was acceptable
[14:08] to meet the sin that started the halt
[14:11] the whole ball rolling remember it was a
[14:14] sacrifice of a
[14:17] original sin of a blood transfusion or
[14:21] blood transferring of hemoglobin from
[14:23] the serpent to the woman well the only
[14:26] way to meet that sin was by the blood
[14:28] and that blood of a human of that of an
[14:31] animal that blood cell was broke to be
[14:34] able to meet that sacrifice to meet that
[14:37] that sacrifice to meet that sin it had
[14:39] to be this it had to be something that
[14:41] would meet it and body life wasn't
[14:44] enough killing a watermelon killing a
[14:49] cucumber killing a head of lettuce was
[14:53] not sufficient to meet the sin had to be
[14:57] blood because it was a blood transfer of
[15:01] sin I had to be a blood transfer to meet
[15:03] that sin so Abel understood that by
[15:07] revelation we got that revelation we saw
[15:10] that last time now I want to dig into
[15:13] this I know this is going to be a couple
[15:15] services so I'm trying not to rush and
[15:17] just take my time that's why I wanted to
[15:20] lay that well I wasn't intending to do
[15:23] it quite like that but the Lord laying
[15:24] that foundation revelation again of
[15:27] understanding because we are going to go
[15:28] back to the Garden of Eden again and
[15:30] look and go back to that point but I
[15:33] want to go back because we're starting
[15:35] back over with Christ and mystery God
[15:38] revealed all the mysteries of God in
[15:39] Christ part 5 so I want to go back to
[15:41] Revelation chapter 10 and again read
[15:44] that one verse verse 7 you have your
[15:47] Bibles read it with me but in the days
[15:49] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[15:51] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[15:55] God should be finished as he had
[15:57] declared to his servants the prophets
[15:59] notice that again but you know when he
[16:03] began to sound the mystery of God should
[16:08] be finished I remember what we talked
[16:10] about that mystery what is that
[16:12] Street what is the mystery of God that
[16:15] was to be finalized or unfolded to the
[16:18] point of completion for for people to
[16:22] get that revelation for it to cause a
[16:25] body change and for this bride to go in
[16:28] a rapture it was to be a completion see
[16:31] that's all the other ages was never able
[16:33] to reach that they had their time and
[16:36] they lived their understanding of the
[16:37] revelation they live their anointing for
[16:40] their day but this is old this is the
[16:42] last day this is a rapture time so there
[16:45] had to be something come to finish to
[16:49] finish that mystery for that mystery to
[16:53] be revealed to be understood to unfold
[16:56] to a people that we could understand it
[16:59] that it could be something that and on
[17:01] that means spiritual understanding not
[17:02] physical understood that it can be
[17:05] revealed so based on that we know that
[17:08] that mystery so what is that mystery
[17:10] that was to be completed of revelation
[17:14] to a group of people for a body changed
[17:17] to take them in a rapture that mystery
[17:20] is Jesus Christ Christ the mystery of
[17:25] God revealed in Christ is all the
[17:28] mysteries that have been hid from ages
[17:31] and generations but Christ is that
[17:34] mystery singular we go again read it
[17:37] again the mystery singular of God that
[17:41] was to be revealed Jesus Christ who
[17:43] Christ is what he is today who he is to
[17:48] us he's not the second third tenth
[17:50] person of a Trinity He is God Almighty
[17:54] veiled in flesh he is a part of the the
[17:58] father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ
[18:01] the Godhead that makes up the completion
[18:04] of God as he's unfolded himself to us
[18:07] down through ages is to remember we
[18:10] talked about or even read that quote of
[18:12] the up the slowly unfolding mysteries
[18:15] poor of Jesus Christ condescending
[18:19] himself to bring us to this place of
[18:22] going in a rapture that mystery is
[18:26] Christ many people today miss on that
[18:30] mystery they don't have or understand
[18:33] spiritually understand that mystery who
[18:36] Christ really is when he asked his
[18:39] disciples he said thou art the Christ of
[18:42] Peter said thou art the Christ the Son
[18:45] of the Living God and Jesus said blessed
[18:47] art thou for flesh and blood has not
[18:49] revealed it but my father in heaven that
[18:51] has revealed unto you and upon this
[18:53] revelation I will build my church at
[18:57] revelation of who Jesus Christ is he's
[18:59] not a second person at Trinity he's not
[19:02] some subservient God God did not create
[19:05] himself or recreate himself He is God
[19:08] it's that part of God that came out that
[19:13] that has unfolded itself to bring a
[19:16] revelation an understanding to a group
[19:19] of people that we could see that and it
[19:21] be revealed to us so Christ is the
[19:24] mystery so you see again the foundation
[19:26] that we're building off of for this
[19:28] message and for the messages the
[19:31] subsequent messages that come from this
[19:33] and what brother Branham gave in
[19:35] Christ's mystery God reveal because
[19:37] remember again subtitle is God revealing
[19:40] himself to his people the number one
[19:42] thing that that brother Branham put in
[19:44] Christ and mystery God revealed to
[19:46] unfold that to the people God revealing
[19:49] himself to his people now how was God
[19:53] gonna do that when he encompassed all
[19:55] space time and eternity he's a spirit
[19:58] being that encompasses now how is he
[20:00] going to condescend or come to a place
[20:03] to work us and our human frailties and
[20:06] our limited human abilities are little
[20:09] pea brains because you
[20:13] you can't comprehend it like that the
[20:15] great Einstein and the great thinkers of
[20:18] of history great brilliant people of
[20:22] history that you've made inventions and
[20:24] and then all these things couldn't begin
[20:26] to touch what God really is and what God
[20:31] has done and bring us to this place of
[20:32] who we are and who he is to us so let's
[20:36] start on Rev at Revelation chapter 12
[20:39] we'll just go over a pager Revelation
[20:42] chapter 12 and begin with verse 1 now
[20:48] again like I said to you I'm not gonna
[20:50] I'm not going to try to rush I'm not
[20:53] going to try to push all this into a
[20:55] service maybe 2 or 3 we'll see where the
[20:58] Lord brings it or we get it to here so
[21:00] but Revelation chapter 12 let's look at
[21:04] this real quick I just want to read a
[21:05] couple of verses and and and I'm sorry
[21:09] but I will apologize and let you know
[21:11] now they'll probably be some jumping
[21:13] around a little bit because there's so
[21:16] much of this that encompasses into that
[21:18] one focus of Christ that sometimes it's
[21:22] hard to bring it all in exactly
[21:25] chronologically and the way the
[21:27] Scriptures read read sometimes it's hard
[21:30] to bring it all out like that son I
[21:32] trust you indulge me a little bit but
[21:33] now Revelation chapter 12 verse 1 it
[21:37] says and there appeared a great wonder
[21:39] in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun
[21:44] and the moon under her feet and upon her
[21:48] head a crown of twelve stars now let's
[21:52] look at that for a few moments
[21:54] because this scripture brings a great
[21:57] transition this scripture brings a great
[22:00] understanding of that transition time of
[22:04] Jesus Christ let me go ahead read the
[22:05] second verse
[22:06] and she being with child cried
[22:09] travailing in birth and pained to be
[22:12] delivered now that was Jesus Christ this
[22:14] woman bringing forth Jesus Christ now we
[22:18] know that the Jews were have been
[22:21] looking for their Messiah for years
[22:23] hundreds thousands of years they have
[22:25] been looking for their Messiah so let's
[22:28] read this there appeared a great wonder
[22:30] in heaven a woman a woman what does
[22:33] Woman represent we know woman represents
[22:35] church
[22:36] well this church is not Gentile Church
[22:39] this is the old Orthodox Church Israel
[22:43] that represents woman this woman a woman
[22:48] clothed with the Sun now we know what
[22:50] the Sun is that's the gospel that's that
[22:53] that's God Christ is the light that is
[22:56] the Sun the Sun coming forth and she is
[22:59] clothed with this so you understand that
[23:02] this woman now clothed with the Sun has
[23:06] has a transitional period coming because
[23:10] because the Sun on this Orthodox Church
[23:15] to saw this woman is beginning to come
[23:18] forward because she's clothed in it so
[23:21] she's coming forth she's bringing forth
[23:23] this child notice now that now as he
[23:27] came for his people rejected him we know
[23:30] that but it had to come forth to the
[23:32] time that it could go to the Gentile and
[23:34] then now then again back when God
[23:37] finishes that transgression of Daniel
[23:40] that it comes back to the Jews again
[23:43] but this woman now clothed with the Sun
[23:46] and the moon under her feet now what is
[23:49] the moon the moon is a reflector what is
[23:52] it reflector reflects the Sun but the
[23:54] moon here represents the law but look
[23:58] what the law is now it's because
[24:01] remember the law was just a foreshadow
[24:03] of the grace of God and what God Christ
[24:07] was going to bring as he magnified that
[24:10] while he was here but see notice when
[24:13] when the law was there it was dominant
[24:17] over over humanity it over preached over
[24:20] well not Christianity but godliness you
[24:22] it dominated see they had to follow the
[24:25] law the letter of the law exactly the
[24:27] way it was but now as Christ has come
[24:30] close this woman the law where is it now
[24:33] it's under her feet the law is under her
[24:37] feet why because a new dispensation is
[24:40] about to take place the law becomes
[24:43] subservient because the law giver is now
[24:46] their clothing the woman and the and the
[24:50] moon is just a shadow of what of what
[24:53] was to come
[24:54] so now the shadow the shadowy moon is
[24:58] under the feet with with with the woman
[25:00] standing there clothed in the Sun so you
[25:04] see how this transition is taking place
[25:07] now the the moon is under the feet amen
[25:10] not not that it went away notice some
[25:13] people will say there is no law or the
[25:15] law went away no it didn't no it did
[25:17] still there
[25:18] but we know that the law became overcome
[25:24] were taken over by the grace and mercy
[25:26] of Jesus Christ of God so it came
[25:30] subservient now the Bible says Paul said
[25:34] if you want to live by the law you can
[25:37] live up a law if you want to
[25:38] if you want to reject the grace and
[25:40] mercy of Jesus if you don't want to live
[25:42] by His mercy then then you're welcome to
[25:45] do that you can live by the law but you
[25:47] if you're if you live by one of it you
[25:49] got to live all of it if you're guilty
[25:52] of one of it you're guilty of all of it
[25:54] see if you want to choose that's fine
[25:56] but notice the transition it's putting
[25:59] the law under his feet and this woman
[26:02] this Orthodox Church is getting ready to
[26:05] bring forth and a transition is taking
[26:08] place to bring Jesus Christ and they
[26:10] depend and the crown of twelve stars is
[26:12] just the patriarchs you notice that the
[26:15] disciples the twelve disciples hadn't
[26:17] even been chosen yet because Christ
[26:18] hasn't even been born yet see that so
[26:21] that twelve you got the twelve crown of
[26:25] twelve stars was that was the old
[26:27] patriarchs the sons of Jacob see those
[26:32] those are those twelve stars but now
[26:35] notice in this transition in the second
[26:37] verse now she had this woman being with
[26:41] child cried travailing in birth and
[26:43] pained to be delivered so she as they
[26:46] had been crying for the Messiah all that
[26:48] time all those years he had been crying
[26:51] for the Messiah travailing in birth to
[26:54] bring forth this child Jesus Christ
[26:57] Christ being there for for him to come
[27:02] forth because remember Jesus even said
[27:06] in the Bible it does not say that he
[27:08] came for me it didn't say it came for
[27:11] you
[27:11] he told them he came for the lost sheep
[27:15] of the house of Israel now we understand
[27:18] the twofold purpose and the reasons
[27:20] other reasons beside that but Jesus
[27:23] himself said he came for the lost sheep
[27:26] of the house of Israel not the Gentiles
[27:28] now when he left and this message
[27:31] entered in and through Pentecost descent
[27:35] the the Jews to the Gentiles and the
[27:38] Gentiles received this message of course
[27:42] and and of course gave birth to
[27:44] Pentecost gave giving birth to the
[27:46] Gentile dispensation and the seven
[27:49] church ages that we have gone through
[27:50] now but Jesus himself said I come to the
[27:54] lost sheep of the house of Israel so
[27:56] when he came forward closes purpose of
[27:58] coming forth it was coming forth as this
[28:01] woman was travailing they were asking
[28:04] Messiah when the Messiah come forth
[28:07] would that priest do he held Jesus and
[28:09] dedicated and said my eyes have seen his
[28:12] salvation now I can die in peace I
[28:14] believe or something like that you know
[28:15] because that's what they've been waiting
[28:17] for now the Jews of course as a whole
[28:21] rejected him of course a part of the
[28:24] transgression again of Daniel 7 so he so
[28:27] he turns the disciples the message goes
[28:29] to the Jews to the Gentiles but that
[28:33] woman was waiting to deliver to bring
[28:36] deliverance of Jesus Christ now let's go
[28:42] over to Isaiah chapter 9
[28:46] I wanna you know the scripture belt but
[28:49] I want to pick through this and and
[28:51] because remember we're talking about God
[28:55] and we're talking about God bringing
[28:59] himself into a place into a way that he
[29:02] could reveal himself to his people he
[29:06] said what God can do anything
[29:07] he absolutely can but he had to make it
[29:10] in a way that follows his word because
[29:13] he couldn't transgress is on word and I
[29:15] had to be in a way to where we could
[29:18] receive it there's only so much that
[29:22] that the human can take only so much
[29:25] that the human mind can take I mean you
[29:27] go back and listen to brother Graham
[29:28] said there's things that the Lord would
[29:30] give to him it just he just was just
[29:32] even too much for the human body
[29:36] Paul was caught up to the third heaven
[29:39] there's just it had to be in a way where
[29:42] it could actually be revealed and
[29:44] received by the people so as we talk
[29:47] about this God revealing himself because
[29:51] we can see remember about man said now
[29:53] if you can't see Christ in every verse
[29:54] go back and read it again because he's
[29:57] there so Isaiah chapter 9 let's read
[30:01] verse 6 in the context of what we just
[30:04] read now from revelation 12:4 unto us a
[30:09] child is born unto us a son is given and
[30:13] the government shall be upon his
[30:15] shoulder and his name shall be called
[30:17] wonderful counsellor the mighty God the
[30:22] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[30:26] now how does that how does that sound
[30:28] like the second person of a Trinity
[30:31] does that sound like someone a
[30:33] description in the Bible does that sound
[30:36] like a description of someone who is not
[30:38] God when it says he is the mighty God
[30:42] the everlasting father does that sound
[30:45] like somebody that's that's not a part
[30:47] of who he really is and that is God
[30:50] himself well that's exactly what it says
[30:53] a child is born a son is given what is
[30:57] that
[30:58] that's that woman travailing in pain to
[31:01] give birth to that child revelation 12 -
[31:04] we just read see a Sunday now is born in
[31:07] Chosun is given the government upon his
[31:09] shoulders his name is wonderful
[31:11] counselor mighty God everlasting father
[31:13] the Prince of Peace the increase of his
[31:16] government and peace there shall be no
[31:19] end upon the throne of David which which
[31:22] that no one brings us to to which we
[31:26] will get into probably eventually
[31:28] Hebrews where talks about Melchizedek
[31:32] who had no mother no father no beginning
[31:35] and days no ending of life Amen who was
[31:39] that Melchizedek
[31:40] praise the Lord is what became the flesh
[31:44] Jesus the government and peace there
[31:47] should be no end amen
[31:51] remember no kissing no beginning of days
[31:53] no ending of life what is that that's
[31:55] eternal eternal had no beginning has no
[31:57] ending oh who is eternal God oh it's so
[32:02] good I guess when it's revealed to you
[32:04] it becomes a real simple doesn't it you
[32:06] look at you think out them everybody
[32:07] else now see this how does this not make
[32:10] as we would say since for everybody uh
[32:13] you know but when your eyes are
[32:15] enlightened and your eyes are opening
[32:17] you receive the revelation and
[32:19] it just becomes as simple as baptism you
[32:22] know we baptize it's funny because the
[32:24] world of the Christian world they will
[32:27] say that they should do everything in
[32:29] the name of Jesus until they go to
[32:31] baptize people they do everything in the
[32:34] name of Jesus till they go to baptize
[32:35] one of the most important things that
[32:37] you can happen in regeneration to be
[32:39] baptized and they dunk them and they put
[32:41] them in the name of the Father Son the
[32:43] Holy Ghost and that's not even a name
[32:45] father son Holy Ghost sink nation you've
[32:47] been baptized in the name Father Son
[32:49] Holy Ghost you mean been baptized the
[32:51] name of the Lord Jesus promised all you
[32:53] do the word or deed do in the name of
[32:54] the Lord Jesus II but it becomes simple
[32:57] then it's it just you think how can
[33:01] people not see this but they can't
[33:03] because our eyes are blinded they can't
[33:05] see it they and the Bible says the song
[33:08] Ian's 2nd 2nd Thessalonians 2 that their
[33:10] eyes are blinded is blinded to those
[33:11] that are lost amen the god of this world
[33:15] says have blinded their eyes
[33:17] there should be no end upon the throne
[33:19] of David and upon the kingdom to order
[33:21] and establish it with the judgment at
[33:23] justice from henceforth even for ever
[33:25] the zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[33:28] perform this now we notice his child we
[33:31] noticed the son had been given was a
[33:34] fulfillment of what we read seed
[33:37] revelation 12 to this woman the Orthodox
[33:41] Church that was pained to deliver pain
[33:44] to bring forth the son pained to have
[33:49] this son come forth as they know we know
[33:52] as the deliverer Jesus Christ
[33:56] the son coming forth
[33:59] third verse now because notice we're
[34:02] getting to the revelation or a
[34:05] countenance ending see because the
[34:09] culmination of that was in the flesh man
[34:12] called Jesus verse 3 now went back to
[34:16] Revelation 12 verse 3 so we've we've
[34:18] completed that first two verses we've
[34:21] gone and saw in Isaiah where he
[34:22] prophesied almost 800 years before it
[34:25] ever even happened Isaiah prophesied I
[34:28] forgot them seven hundred and seventy
[34:30] some years I believe it is before Christ
[34:32] was born Isaiah's prophecy in it so
[34:36] bringing that fulfillment revelation
[34:39] 12:1 and 2 now looked at 3rd verse and
[34:41] there appeared another wonder in heaven
[34:43] and behold a great red dragon having
[34:47] seven heads and ten horns and seven
[34:50] Crown's upon his head now notice the
[34:53] impersonation of this entity the
[34:57] counterfeit nature of this entity this
[35:00] red dragon as we know is the devil Satan
[35:03] Lucifer tainted evil this red dragon the
[35:10] devil seven heads the number of God the
[35:15] seven is the number ten orders and
[35:18] number seven upon his head notice the
[35:21] numerology there
[35:22] he's counterfeiting impersonating God
[35:26] those are all perfect numbers of God see
[35:29] seven 10 three five he impersonated
[35:34] that's that's the devil and he in his
[35:37] tail drew the third part of the stars of
[35:40] heaven and did cast them to the earth
[35:42] and the dragon stood before the woman
[35:44] which was ready to be delivered for to
[35:48] devour her child as soon as it was born
[35:51] now we see this this red dragon Satan
[35:56] setting there and
[35:58] more than we can read about him I
[36:00] believe this Isaiah 12 we can read about
[36:02] it wanting to exert maybe 14 wanting to
[36:05] exalt himself above God wanted to be
[36:08] worshipped as God wanted to be exalted
[36:10] above God wanted to be exalted above the
[36:13] Most High we see this red dragon this
[36:16] devil Satan wanting to be worshipped as
[36:19] God wanting to be higher than God so he
[36:23] begins to minister his tail drawing
[36:27] these people his charismatic way of
[36:31] delivering his charismatic energy of of
[36:35] getting people getting the angels the
[36:38] third of the stars of the heaven that
[36:40] angels the third of the angels in heaven
[36:42] to be so charismatic and so in drawing
[36:46] of the people of those angels that he
[36:48] actually got them to believe what he was
[36:50] trying to tell them he actually got
[36:53] those angels to believe a part of them
[36:56] what he was telling them but what he was
[36:58] telling them was drawing them away from
[37:01] the truth drawing them away from God
[37:04] bringing them into his fallen condition
[37:07] that he that the hidden he was in
[37:10] barline deception
[37:15] deceiving those angels by his tail by
[37:18] his preaching by his ministry so
[37:21] charismatic
[37:22] so involving so on so engulfing getting
[37:27] the people getting them to believe he
[37:29] does the same thing today not just the
[37:32] Angels he does the same same tactics
[37:34] today such a well well-versed speaker it
[37:41] comes in with great flatteries he gains
[37:44] the confidence of the people forget the
[37:47] word forget the revelation forget the
[37:49] truth of the work he isn't he a
[37:51] magnificent speaker who cares what
[37:55] magnificent speaker they are if they're
[37:57] telling a lie don't listen to it if
[38:00] they're telling a lie it's wrong I don't
[38:03] care how beautiful the speaker they are
[38:05] I don't care how many peoples in the
[38:07] church how big the steeples and
[38:08] stained-glass windows makes no
[38:10] difference that's the devil in the
[38:12] beginning he's so beautiful elegant but
[38:16] you listen to what they say what they
[38:20] say doesn't match this word then you've
[38:22] got a problem get away from it you run
[38:25] from it his tail drew the third of the
[38:28] stars of heaven II he cast in the earth
[38:29] and now the dragon is standing before
[38:32] this woman the burner the woman Orthodox
[38:35] Church delivering Christ bringing forth
[38:38] the Messiah the deliverer and this devil
[38:41] this red dragon right there waiting
[38:45] anticipating this delivery
[38:48] remember Lucifer was God's right-hand
[38:50] man at one time he's anticipating
[38:52] waiting for this delivery standing there
[38:55] waiting for this child to be born so he
[38:58] could devour it him as soon as he is
[39:02] born to try to bring him into himself
[39:05] how did he do that well first thing you
[39:07] try to do is he had Herod
[39:09] Herod was a hateful jealous ungodly man
[39:12] and Satan had gotten any filtrated in
[39:15] Herod and Herod was sitting there
[39:17] waiting to kill that boy so much so and
[39:21] you know the story that made giant then
[39:23] coming and you know they realize that
[39:25] they've been a couple of years that that
[39:27] that he hated it so much he wanted to he
[39:30] wanted to devour this man child so much
[39:33] that he killed every man child from two
[39:37] year old and under every one of them he
[39:41] had of everyone killed just so he could
[39:44] try to get this one Jesus Christ he
[39:48] killed them all fortunately as we know
[39:51] as Christians God leads us and guides us
[39:55] and helps us and shows us you know
[39:57] sometimes it's not doesn't make any
[39:59] sense sometimes it's not understandable
[40:01] or why would I be doing this why would
[40:03] God leave me here why would God tell me
[40:05] this you know maybe Joseph and Mary were
[40:09] there maybe Joseph was thinking the same
[40:11] thing or while we're here now we got to
[40:13] go over here Oh Lord why don't we gotta
[40:16] go over here now why are you taking this
[40:19] over here why are we having to do that
[40:21] but see it's God in control
[40:23] it's God keeping and saving his own
[40:26] taking care of his own people so God
[40:28] sends him away so that they're not there
[40:31] when the slaughter comes Mary Joseph and
[40:33] Jesus are in another country he didn't
[40:35] find him because they're not there to be
[40:37] found God takes care of his own amen but
[40:41] Satan they are ready to devour that
[40:43] child as soon as it's born because he
[40:46] knew exactly what it was going to cost
[40:49] Satan knew exactly what it was going to
[40:51] take and he did everything he could to
[40:53] try to to kill that child as soon as it
[40:56] was born
[40:57] and then of course everything after that
[40:59] he did everything he could try to devour
[41:01] Jesus Christ because that was the
[41:04] Messiah that was
[41:05] deliver that was the child that was to
[41:07] come forth that transition that was to
[41:10] go from the all old law to the new grace
[41:13] from the old way of living to a new life
[41:16] to the blood of Jesus that was not the
[41:20] not the meaning of a sacrifice or
[41:25] meaning of a sin remember the blood
[41:30] sacrifice that was in the Garden of Eden
[41:32] I will read it hopefully we have time
[41:34] today to get to that part to read that
[41:37] to see where that sacrifice was met with
[41:42] the with the that sin was met with the
[41:45] sacrifice able by revelation realized it
[41:48] took blood Jesus our God killing the
[41:52] lambs in the Garden of Eden and throwing
[41:54] the bloody sheet skin into into a Adam
[41:58] and Eve was was indicative of that first
[42:03] sacrifice the first breaking of that
[42:05] blood cell of an animal to meet the
[42:08] hemoglobin blood sin original sin in the
[42:14] garden beating with the serpent but now
[42:15] it's going to take it had to take the
[42:19] blood of God himself dead blood cell of
[42:25] Jesus Christ that broke that released
[42:27] God was not something that just met the
[42:32] sacrifice or the that met the sin
[42:35] it was overtaking of that sin it
[42:38] annihilated that sin
[42:42] it didn't just meet the sin so that we
[42:45] can stand in and be okay with God again
[42:48] it annihilated that sin so we could
[42:51] become him praise the Lord the only way
[42:55] it could be that way they couldn't have
[42:57] done it under that old sacrifice there
[42:59] had to be the transition there had to be
[43:01] that blood not just to meet the sin
[43:04] but to annihilate the scene so that the
[43:07] worshiper then could become as him he
[43:11] became us so that we could become him
[43:13] and now it transitions into a place that
[43:16] this that we by revelation see who we
[43:20] are in him if we see who we are that
[43:24] that's enough to bring a faith to a
[43:27] group of people to go on a rapture
[43:29] there's no body change gonna come any
[43:32] other way
[43:32] faith comes by hearing and hearing the
[43:35] Word of God and not some denomination
[43:37] we're not just some seminaries word or
[43:40] some man-made idea of theology or dogma
[43:42] but the true revealed Word of God that's
[43:45] the only thing is gonna take a bride in
[43:47] a rapture that's the only thing that
[43:49] brings faith it's met right here Satan
[43:54] knew that Satan knew that that's why he
[43:57] did everything he could to destroy that
[43:59] child
[44:00] look now fifth first and she brought
[44:04] forth a man child who is to rule all
[44:07] nations with a rod of iron and her child
[44:09] was caught up unto God and to his throne
[44:12] and the woman fled into the wilderness
[44:14] where she had a place prepared of God
[44:17] that she should feed there that that
[44:20] they should feed her there a thousand
[44:22] two hundred threescore days has three
[44:25] and a half years go back to revelation
[44:26] 11 three you see that three and a half
[44:28] years the tribulation time the time
[44:30] where at the marriage south of Gentiles
[44:33] are at the marriage supper of the Lamb
[44:34] of God comes at the end of that you got
[44:36] the two witnesses Moses and Elijah come
[44:38] down and it reveals himself and that's
[44:40] the Jews revelation 11 and this three
[44:43] and a half years is where she said at
[44:45] the end of that its word Zechariah said
[44:47] he comes and they realize who he was the
[44:50] transgression is removed and they
[44:53] realized who he was and they cry out put
[44:55] on sackcloth and ashes and said where do
[44:58] you get those scars and he said in the
[45:00] house of my friends
[45:02] and they realized as the people that
[45:05] they had crucified their own Messiah and
[45:08] it becomes a revelation to them their
[45:12] eyes are open and they see the message
[45:15] which we receive what is that message
[45:17] that message is Jesus Christ Christ the
[45:20] mystery of God that message has come to
[45:23] us has been revealed we see it by
[45:26] revelation is now coming to them that
[45:30] message what is the message the message
[45:32] is Christ the word is Christ coming to
[45:34] them so that they see the word they
[45:38] receive the word of their day we
[45:41] received the word of our day not awful
[45:43] books and tapes not because of brother
[45:46] Brandon but because God revealing
[45:49] himself who Christ is to us who he is to
[45:53] us and who we are in him amen it becomes
[45:58] a revelation truth
[46:00] it's what trans transitions us from this
[46:05] human natural life into a body changed
[46:09] to a rapture the gentleness you get that
[46:12] there are three and a half years this
[46:14] woman there one thousand two hundred
[46:17] threescore days has three and a half
[46:19] years they see that there was a war in
[46:22] heaven Micah seventh verse now Michael
[46:25] and his angels fought against the dragon
[46:27] the dragon fought and his angels and
[46:28] prevailed not neither was their place
[46:31] found any more in heaven praise the Lord
[46:34] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[46:38] serpent called the devil now we've got
[46:41] him we've identified him Amen just like
[46:43] we've identified God veiled in flesh as
[46:46] Jesus Christ
[46:49] he has a name his name is not father his
[46:52] name is not son his name is not Holy
[46:55] Ghost his name is Lord Jesus Christ
[46:59] we've identified this great red dragon
[47:02] now in the scripture this serpent called
[47:05] the devil and Satan there we are
[47:09] who deceiveth the whole world he was
[47:12] cast out into the earth and his angels
[47:15] were cast out with him course we are to
[47:17] know that because up here revelation in
[47:19] the third verse that says our full force
[47:22] fourth verse his tail drew the third
[47:26] part of the stars of heaven and did cast
[47:27] them to the earth so we already knew
[47:30] that but now those we see that red
[47:33] dragon the devil Satan cast to the earth
[47:36] and his angels cast out with him and I
[47:40] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[47:42] is come salvation strength the kingdom
[47:44] of our God and the power of his Christ
[47:47] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[47:49] down which accused them before our God
[47:51] day and night and they day who is they
[47:55] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[47:59] they me you they overcame him by the
[48:04] blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[48:07] their testimony and they loved not their
[48:09] lives unto death and they did through
[48:11] the dark ages they gave their lives up
[48:14] by the millions therefore rejoice ye
[48:17] heavens and either dwell in them woe to
[48:19] the inhabiters of the earth and of the
[48:21] sea for the devil is come down unto you
[48:24] having great wrath because he knoweth
[48:27] that he has but a short time praise the
[48:29] Lord for that
[48:30] and that time of this last day would be
[48:32] shortened according to Matthew that that
[48:36] Jesus told us but look at this one too
[48:37] the habit of the earth and of the sea
[48:40] inheritors of the earth antiserum ember
[48:42] revelation 10 7 we talked about when he
[48:45] put one foot on land and one foot on sea
[48:47] there it is it's a conquering it's a
[48:50] it's an overcoming of the earth and the
[48:53] sea Jesus Christ conquering the mighty
[48:56] conquer the earth and the sea made us
[48:58] more than conquerors now for the devil's
[49:01] come down having wrath because he know
[49:04] that his time is short so he's a busy
[49:06] guy
[49:07] he's a busy beaver he's working overtime
[49:09] because he knows he doesn't have but
[49:11] just a short time so what does he do he
[49:14] starts out right straight off in the
[49:15] Garden of Eden right when God creates
[49:18] man now he creates he animal life and
[49:21] botany life or botany life and then
[49:23] animal life and human life and the the
[49:27] evolutive if you want to call that of
[49:30] God's creation from Lois more bonding to
[49:34] the animal to the human the human now is
[49:38] is in that creation is is Adam God
[49:44] creates Adam as a spirit man well first
[49:48] of all God God created the heaven and
[49:50] the earth we can look at that I was
[49:51] going to do that next week but we can
[49:54] read your real quick right here because
[49:56] it'll give us that beginning here but we
[49:59] should know it all anyway just 1:1 in
[50:01] the beginning God created the heaven and
[50:04] the earth and the earth was without form
[50:05] and void and darkness upon the face of
[50:07] the deep and the Spirit of God the
[50:10] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[50:13] waters see God spoke the power that
[50:16] spoken word coming forth creating
[50:18] heavens and earth galaxies universes
[50:22] whatever we want to term them or call
[50:24] them
[50:25] God created just by the simple word of
[50:27] his mouth now he had to have faith to
[50:29] believe it
[50:31] Hebrews 11:1 faith frame the everything
[50:35] that we see the worlds that we see God's
[50:37] the word by faith believe that find it
[50:41] but then the Spirit of God came and
[50:42] moved out amen
[50:45] the Spirit of God came and brooded over
[50:48] this earth there had to be that second
[50:50] part um this isn't the third part of the
[50:53] Godhead this isn't the this isn't God
[50:56] saying okay Holy Ghost now I want you to
[50:59] go down there and and and burn over that
[51:01] or no it's a Spirit of God not not a
[51:06] third person the Spirit of God I don't
[51:10] mean to be pointing to myself as God but
[51:12] the Spirit of God he pointed out the
[51:14] Spirit of God went forth out because
[51:20] remember God's a spirit anyway but the
[51:22] Spirit of God moved out and brooded over
[51:25] the earth and God then made man in his
[51:28] own image what was the image of God is a
[51:30] spirit man
[51:31] God's Spirit so he made man a spirit but
[51:35] then God took the clay of the earth and
[51:37] he molded it into a man just like the
[51:40] just like the trees of the ground rooted
[51:44] that man in the Garden of Eden and in
[51:46] the rooting of that man in the Garden of
[51:48] Eden he formed him into man but man
[51:54] didn't become a living soul until God
[51:57] breathed into him the breath of life
[51:58] then he was then he wasn't just spirit
[52:01] but he was also living bond man amen and
[52:05] then and then Adam had that had that
[52:09] that nature in him in the Garden of Eden
[52:11] comes forth as a man to rule over the
[52:16] earth
[52:16] he pulls those roots out of the ground
[52:19] and he starts to walk forth upon the
[52:21] earth as a living soul as a soul of man
[52:25] as a as a spirit man as a body man as a
[52:29] three oh three fold unity of the human
[52:35] element body spirit soul is the same as
[52:38] God flesh God spirit God flesh God Holy
[52:44] Ghost father son Holy Ghost
[52:47] Trinity still the same God not Trinity
[52:50] but it's he's one God just like on one
[52:53] person see that's Adam become that now
[52:56] when Satan was cast out this red dragon
[52:59] on the earth he didn't go and try to
[53:01] convince Adam because Adam was a spoken
[53:05] word of God Adam was the first spoken
[53:09] word of God that God spoke and he came
[53:11] forth remember Jesus was the only
[53:14] begotten Son of God but Adam was the
[53:17] created son of God God created Adam in
[53:21] his own image in his own likeness
[53:23] breathe into him his old life the breath
[53:26] of life so Adam was the living
[53:28] embodiment of God upon this earth he was
[53:31] the a mature god of this earth he could
[53:34] speak you could name he could say you
[53:36] can do whatever he wanted to do this
[53:37] earth because he had complete supreme
[53:39] control animals body life nature
[53:42] everything Adam was in complete control
[53:45] of it because God called him and put him
[53:48] in that place to do that / for that
[53:50] purpose name the animals and what God
[53:53] did through
[53:54] now he was the complete embodiment he
[53:56] was that it may be complete he was that
[54:00] embodiment of God that he that he
[54:02] created that man and he looked and he
[54:05] was happy he was glad in fact he was so
[54:08] happy with that him he came down every
[54:10] day the Bible says and walked in the
[54:13] garden beat and talked without the cool
[54:16] of the evening live to ear that
[54:18] fellowship my or a beautiful picture if
[54:21] you can think of it for a woman talking
[54:23] and fellows shipping together but God
[54:26] recognized that he made an animal life
[54:30] he made which we are mammal humans he
[54:33] made animal life he made the male and
[54:35] the female but in the human life he'd
[54:38] only made the male Adam was the
[54:41] embodiment of God so what God did is we
[54:44] took out a he put Adam into asleep and
[54:47] he took from Adam oh my
[54:50] the beautiful picture of God bringing
[54:56] forth unfolding himself to us by
[55:00] revelation seen the work of God and
[55:04] through into Jesus Christ and the flesh
[55:08] of God being here walking among us he's
[55:11] showing us this by taking the woman out
[55:14] of his side but taking this church this
[55:18] bride out of his side he took Eve the
[55:21] woman not Eve the woman out of his side
[55:24] and turned then took this rib and made
[55:28] the woman out of Adam
[55:32] that's why she's called Wolfman because
[55:36] she's from the man and God formed her
[55:39] and made her to be a helpmate to add and
[55:44] this woman now being a byproduct was in
[55:48] the position just like animal life just
[55:51] like the serpent was subject to
[55:55] deception now he Adam was the created
[56:02] son of God
[56:03] Eve was a byproduct of that creation
[56:08] from his side notice Jesus
[56:14] when you hung at Calvary they pierce
[56:18] decided Comfort blood and water this
[56:23] bride
[56:26] the woman
[56:29] the helpmate the bride coming forth from
[56:33] Jesus Christ just a four figure of God
[56:37] showing the condensation of himself to
[56:41] where we as a people could see it and it
[56:44] be revealed to us that we can that we
[56:46] can know that was God showing himself to
[56:49] us the whole time
[56:50] back from Genesis 1 back from Genesis 2
[56:54] 3 the Garden of Eden God revealing
[56:58] himself showing when he's going to do we
[57:02] can look back now and see that my
[57:05] prophecy those of old who were belong to
[57:10] God could look forward by prophecy just
[57:13] like Isaiah said a son shall be of a
[57:16] child born a son is given he should be
[57:18] called counselor principes he was
[57:21] looking forward to see what was coming
[57:24] what was all therefrom even in the
[57:26] Garden of Eden what was coming forth but
[57:29] now this woman Satan sees not only can
[57:34] he work through the serpent but he can
[57:37] work through another byproduct called
[57:40] the woman and he approached her and
[57:43] began to talk and reason with her so
[57:47] that he could deceive her into causing
[57:50] everything that God had created and all
[57:52] the beauty and splendor that God had
[57:54] done and perverted causing every day to
[57:59] fall and be perverted
[58:03] which was to do what bring about the
[58:07] necessity of God to unfold himself to
[58:11] his people God to come and reveal
[58:15] himself to his people and show himself
[58:18] that he is the Almighty not just a third
[58:23] person saying in person the Almighty God
[58:25] so that that board that issued forth
[58:30] conquered the sin and of course we know
[58:34] in the garden in the Millennium man will
[58:37] live 1,000 years again never did it
[58:40] before
[58:41] but those Allah came to close 969 years
[58:43] but no man ever lived one full day a
[58:46] thousand years but we will in the
[58:48] Millennium because the curse is broken
[58:50] amen the fulfillment of that's going to
[58:53] take place at that time it's already
[58:55] been done but the fulfillment of that is
[58:57] going to be in the garden in the
[59:00] Millennium now let's get to this
[59:03] before I close here we'll have to
[59:04] continue on later but in Genesis chapter
[59:07] three verse one now we know that that
[59:11] Adam now has Eve now has the woman she's
[59:15] not Eva I always keep that remembers I
[59:17] drove that home to you before I want to
[59:20] remember that again she is not even
[59:22] she's just woman and that's how Adam
[59:26] refers to her as woman until after the
[59:29] fall born of his own flesh of his flesh
[59:32] life of his life see but now the serpent
[59:36] was more subtil more cunning crafty
[59:39] sensible then any beast of the field
[59:42] which the Lord God had made and he said
[59:44] unto the woman yea hath God said ye
[59:47] shall not eat of every tree of the
[59:48] garden
[59:49] I remember that deception remember
[59:51] Satan's Trinity of deception first is to
[59:54] bring doubt second is to hybrid the word
[59:58] third is to bring his own gospel
[1:00:00] he does the same thing today this is
[1:00:02] that doubt again
[1:00:03] yeah if God said now remember this is
[1:00:06] that were just in the third chapter of
[1:00:08] Genesis so god well from the first verse
[1:00:12] we just read it the God showing himself
[1:00:15] as the unfolding God and revealing
[1:00:18] himself to his people see but now this
[1:00:21] just in the third verse he said unto the
[1:00:24] woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat
[1:00:26] of every tree of the garden see bringing
[1:00:29] down there's a question it's not a
[1:00:32] statement it's a question a lot of times
[1:00:34] people read that as a statement yeh had
[1:00:37] God said you not yet out of every tree
[1:00:39] of the garden no it's not a statement
[1:00:41] there's a question yeh had God said ye
[1:00:45] shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:00:46] garden question brings question to the
[1:00:50] woman the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:00:52] may eat of the fruits of the tree of the
[1:00:54] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:00:55] which is in the midst middle of the
[1:00:58] garden God has said you shall not eat of
[1:01:00] it neither shall ye touch it lest she
[1:01:03] don't know how does she know this how
[1:01:05] does she know this how does she know
[1:01:07] that's what God said because if you go
[1:01:09] look at the Bible you see that God said
[1:01:12] that before
[1:01:14] the woman was created
[1:01:18] God said that before the woman's
[1:01:21] creative hoody teletoon Adam had an
[1:01:24] evening because Adam her head her
[1:01:27] husband her flesh-and-bone told her
[1:01:31] about it he's the one that relayed the
[1:01:34] message that done you won't find that in
[1:01:36] the scripture but if you look at it
[1:01:38] chronologically it you can see that how
[1:01:41] else was she know the other thing that I
[1:01:44] want to point to is this part here were
[1:01:47] in the 17th verse after the fall now God
[1:01:52] is speaking to the serpent then he spoke
[1:01:55] to Eve and now he's speaking to Adam so
[1:01:58] to solidify this in your mind that that
[1:02:02] this that her understanding had to have
[1:02:05] come from Adam because remember she is
[1:02:08] not a part of the original creation
[1:02:12] animal life is but there without a soul
[1:02:15] amen remember the conscience there the
[1:02:18] the soul of man the free will the the
[1:02:21] understanding they don't have a soul but
[1:02:24] now if this will solidify it look at the
[1:02:28] 17th first still in Genesis 3 he's
[1:02:32] already talked to the serpent and he's
[1:02:33] already talked to the woman and we can
[1:02:36] read it I won't get in to be able to get
[1:02:38] into it today but oh we can look at that
[1:02:41] later or you can look at it when we're
[1:02:43] done here look at the 17th verse and
[1:02:45] unto Adam he said because thou has
[1:02:48] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[1:02:51] has eaten of the tree of which I
[1:02:54] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[1:02:59] of it
[1:03:00] cursed is the ground for thy sake now -
[1:03:03] and very important points here one point
[1:03:06] I just want to hit a highlight of real
[1:03:08] quick
[1:03:08] he didn't curse at him he cursed the
[1:03:10] ground but the main thing I want you to
[1:03:13] see in this verse is that God told Adam
[1:03:19] has thou eaten of the tree of which I
[1:03:24] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[1:03:28] of it now you go back in and we will but
[1:03:31] you go back and you read what he tells
[1:03:34] the serpent and what he tells the woman
[1:03:37] he does not tell either one of them that
[1:03:41] they transgressed his work he doesn't
[1:03:44] tell either one of them that they did
[1:03:47] what he told them not to do you notice
[1:03:51] it's not in their curse it's not in
[1:03:54] God's conversation with them only to
[1:03:57] Adam does God say that you did something
[1:04:01] that I told you not to do only Adam
[1:04:05] because only Adam was the one that
[1:04:08] received the original instruction of not
[1:04:11] to partake of it
[1:04:12] so what didn't even get it from God
[1:04:15] didn't tell me that God didn't say Eve
[1:04:18] you did what I told you not to do where
[1:04:21] did she get it she got it from the one
[1:04:23] that he told not to do
[1:04:27] Adam he said I commanded you not to do
[1:04:30] this and you did it but did you imagine
[1:04:33] and you could just picture that this man
[1:04:38] this perfect man and that has the most
[1:04:42] perfect most beautiful woman in my
[1:04:46] opinion ever to grace the earth outside
[1:04:48] of my wife of course that Adam had as as
[1:04:52] his helpmate as his wife in taking her
[1:04:57] arm and arm strolling through the most
[1:04:59] beautiful place ever existed on this
[1:05:01] planet we're going back to it face up
[1:05:04] Lord I'm so thankful we're going back to
[1:05:07] it but did you imagine him taking her
[1:05:11] and then going arm and arm together
[1:05:13] walking through the garden beam and he's
[1:05:16] tall and he's telling her oh look I not
[1:05:20] it's not Eve so he's not calling her
[1:05:22] Evie says look honey I I mean this I
[1:05:24] made this animal a tiger you're watching
[1:05:27] for a little bit you'll see has natures
[1:05:29] and why I named in that and you see this
[1:05:32] fruits of the tree all this this apples
[1:05:36] good it tasted it it's red and delicious
[1:05:40] sorry for the played on words but and
[1:05:43] eat it now and they're sitting there
[1:05:44] eating apples and and they keep going
[1:05:46] down and they said Oh we'll see this
[1:05:47] this is called a carrot and see this is
[1:05:51] called this tree and look at this
[1:05:53] beautiful flower see this rosebush and
[1:05:56] you can grab the rose because you know
[1:05:58] there's no forms on it yet
[1:06:00] if this beautiful smell this you know
[1:06:04] God took me through and we've walked
[1:06:05] through this garden numerous times honey
[1:06:08] and you know we just enjoyed our time
[1:06:11] together and I want you to enjoy it just
[1:06:13] like we have he'll be down this evening
[1:06:15] again as he always is but you know he
[1:06:19] told us other things that were not to do
[1:06:22] told me and as he begins to relay all
[1:06:25] those things to her he's telling her
[1:06:27] everything letting her know keeping her
[1:06:29] informed giving her the message giving
[1:06:33] her the message of truth giving her the
[1:06:35] message that God had give him and that's
[1:06:39] how she understood and that's how she
[1:06:41] says the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:06:44] may eat of the fruit of the tree of the
[1:06:45] guard but in the fruit of the tree which
[1:06:47] is in the midst of the garden God has
[1:06:48] said you shall not eat of it neither
[1:06:49] shall ye touch it lest she died she
[1:06:51] knows that house because her husband
[1:06:53] told her husband told her now I want us
[1:06:58] to see because I'm gonna pose here
[1:07:00] because I again and I know I man that
[1:07:04] I'm gonna have to break this up so we'll
[1:07:07] just stop it there but I want to
[1:07:10] continue on in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:11] because remember see Satan's kicked out
[1:07:14] of heaven and and look and see how many
[1:07:18] times not we probably pick them all love
[1:07:20] I'm not saying I know them all
[1:07:23] but God slowly unfolding that mystery
[1:07:27] slowly revealing to us what was to
[1:07:31] eventually be the coming of the Son of
[1:07:34] God Jesus Christ put a name on it
[1:07:38] Jesus put flesh on it in Jesus
[1:07:44] that reveals himself to us the
[1:07:47] revelation that God brings to us so that
[1:07:51] we could be able to see it today amen
[1:07:54] praise the Lord god bless you today I
[1:07:57] pray something was said to help you I
[1:07:59] probably need to get as far as I wanted
[1:08:02] to on this today but Lord willing next
[1:08:05] week I'll be able to get it a little bit
[1:08:08] deeper and a little more but I want to
[1:08:11] take my time than just give it as the
[1:08:13] Lord gives to me so I trust it was a
[1:08:16] blessing to you today and the Lord
[1:08:19] helped you with it now anybody I will
[1:08:22] say got a couple announcements to make
[1:08:24] but first of all let me just get this
[1:08:27] out of the way before I forget it but
[1:08:31] the family camp
[1:08:34] the family camp up in the White
[1:08:39] Mountains has been canceled due to so
[1:08:42] much of the kovat and especially in
[1:08:44] Phoenix a lot of the Phoenix people go
[1:08:45] up for that the family camp July 22nd to
[1:08:49] 26 that I've told you about before has
[1:08:51] been cancelled due to the such a wide
[1:08:55] spread of the kovat going on so these
[1:08:57] you remember I don't I hadn't heard he
[1:08:59] freed by if you were gonna go so but if
[1:09:01] you were you did not already know that
[1:09:03] family camp has been cancelled
[1:09:05] I also want to remind you the funeral
[1:09:08] Thursday I'll try to get those details
[1:09:10] to you this week the Lord willing also
[1:09:12] wanted to remind you that if you'd like
[1:09:16] to come today to the baptisms at the
[1:09:19] Sanctus house and their swimming pool
[1:09:21] three people that sister Matisse have
[1:09:24] been talking and witnessing to that
[1:09:26] just that gave a desire to want to be
[1:09:29] baptized so if you'd like to do that 4
[1:09:32] o'clock at their house we don't know
[1:09:34] where it is just let us know if you want
[1:09:36] to come and want to be a part of it just
[1:09:38] let us know that and and then you could
[1:09:43] be a part of that with us if you'd like
[1:09:44] to do that also want to remember my
[1:09:48] precious wife she's a year older than
[1:09:51] she was the last time we were up here
[1:09:53] before you very thank for the Lord's
[1:09:55] blessed her with another year and
[1:09:57] another time to be together with her I
[1:09:59] know it's kind of surreal for her now
[1:10:01] she's as old as I am so
[1:10:04] we're we're equal again in age at least
[1:10:08] for another couple few months anyway so
[1:10:10] happy birthday to my wife love her very
[1:10:12] dearly we had a pretty heavy storm last
[1:10:16] night too that came through we've gone
[1:10:19] out for dinner and we come back and
[1:10:20] radical beds and came back and as
[1:10:22] emergency vehicles all over our complex
[1:10:25] and trees two or three big trees rooted
[1:10:27] up trees down and falling on apartments
[1:10:30] and limbs and stuff that was hitting
[1:10:34] just things everywhere we we had to go
[1:10:37] around the eye to go around the complex
[1:10:39] to get around the corner to come to even
[1:10:40] get to our apartment but we get over
[1:10:43] there's this big huge tree next to us
[1:10:45] and all this vegetation everything and
[1:10:47] we barely had a couple leaves on our
[1:10:48] porch so Lord just protected us and kept
[1:10:52] us and serving to appreciate the Lord
[1:10:54] blessing us with that
[1:10:55] now also next week the Lord willing my
[1:11:00] desire my intention is to have the full
[1:11:04] live in-person service again at the
[1:11:07] Holiday Inn at 11 o'clock so remember
[1:11:10] that if there's anything any different
[1:11:13] I'll let you know but Lord willing next
[1:11:15] week at eleven o'clock we'll start
[1:11:18] having services at the Holiday and again
[1:11:20] their own cartero
[1:11:21] if you don't know where it is just let
[1:11:23] us know several of you have been there
[1:11:25] already anyway so you know where it is
[1:11:27] but Lord willing next week unless you
[1:11:29] hear from me we'll be at the Holiday Inn
[1:11:31] at eleven o'clock next Sunday also it
[1:11:35] looks like the Lord has provided us a
[1:11:38] more permanent place we'll see how it
[1:11:41] goes
[1:11:41] still just trusting him but brother
[1:11:45] Roger and I did a job for brother Nate
[1:11:47] Garcia didn't realize who he didn't
[1:11:50] realize who he was just answer him to
[1:11:52] add off of the an ad in the paper for
[1:11:54] electrician we go do the work and find
[1:11:57] out it's brother Nate in his wife Teresa
[1:11:59] there you may know from the tabernacle
[1:12:01] well he bought building from his mother
[1:12:05] Lucy but they are no Lucy that used to
[1:12:10] be brother Mike Behar's old office his
[1:12:13] old insurance office own grant and taxi
[1:12:15] home country club just south of Grant or
[1:12:17] north of granite would be on the east
[1:12:20] side of the street and it's eleven
[1:12:24] twelve hundred square foot maybe but
[1:12:26] there's there's got to be some stuff
[1:12:28] done to it a couple offices removed
[1:12:31] we went looked at it me and brother
[1:12:33] Roger with him and we're all three very
[1:12:35] excited about the prospect of maybe this
[1:12:37] working out so brother Nate does some
[1:12:41] streaming so he used these streams at
[1:12:43] 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning and then
[1:12:44] brother Rogers talks about moving his
[1:12:47] service up to 9:30 and then us having an
[1:12:50] 11:30 and then we could just all three
[1:12:52] have the building of course brother Nate
[1:12:54] stream for the Roger stream so we would
[1:12:56] be the actual only church people that
[1:13:00] that are that are actually there so it's
[1:13:03] a Grant Country Club I would really
[1:13:06] appreciate your input on next weekend
[1:13:09] and that being is a prospect of a place
[1:13:12] to meet if that works so it looks like

[1:13:18] but I just I want to make sure that's
[1:13:20] true so I don't want to make sure
[1:13:23] everything works out fine with that it
