TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord Saints it's good to be back again on a Sunday and ready to have church again I hope you're ready for the home meeting that we're having here with Micah and my precious wife and looking forward to another time of service today it's a little different I've had a couple of home services but nothing quite like this usually they have people attending but this is a little bit different but I'm glad that we have a place and a time to be able to do it and I was praying this morning is thinking thanking the Lord for the opportunity to be able to do this because you know there's many countries that people wake up and they get secluded and they can't even mention the name of Jesus or have a church to go to or even stream like this so we're very blessed to be able to have this type of opportunity and the time of my having service and being able to mention the name of Jesus and worship Jesus and have it broadcasts literally around the world I guess it is if whoever Tunes in to this YouTube so we unfortunately again as I text you the other day you're not going to have a song service but and y'all probably happy about that if it's up to me singing but what do want to have a service today and get back to where we left off last week but I do want to enter this service with prayer I've gotten a few prayer requests as I had asked a few minutes ago that people would like to be prayed for those that put on the general requests would see the requests but brother Dennis put in a request for his wife again we had prayer with Leah and Dennis the other night over the phone but Leah of course is still working at the doctor's office the doctor's office is keeping their clinic doors open so in the situation like that of course they stay protected but you never know how the devil would want to try to get into her hand Leigha in some ways since remember her in prayer to also remember brother angel and his family I could just read this but you've probably all got the text that you could see that they really wanted to pray for their family he doesn't have on here that their vehicle broke down so we were in discussion last night about his vehicle and what might be wrong with that so just pray for that their vehicle would we just figure out what's wrong with it and the Lord would just touch it and touch our minds or our intellect to know what to do to fix it all so he had on here of course for prayer for his family for the family of God and just to remember these requests in the name of the Lord Jesus also sister Celia had a request for her brother Harlan very very special unspoken requests me and Sonya know a little bit about that just remember they meant prayer God knows and it seemed like a good man I hope to get to meet him someday but he's in Texas and Julia's brother Harlan so remember him in prayer also had a request from sister Norma for her grandson Jonathan she just wrote that he's messing in something and that's probably I guess enough to know but again God knows where Jonathan is and what's going on in his life and what the situation is so let's just remember just to remember them in prayer remember her in prayer and the situation with Jonathan there so we have our unspoken request and we can lift our hands to the Lord if we'd like to whatever we desire in that situation but I know we all have requests we all have desires we just trust the Lord to type so let's bow our heads together and we'll just go to the Lord in prayer for these needs or Jesus father we thank you today for the ability and the opportunity Lord to gather together even if it's in our own homes Lord and through the streaming service and I appreciate the technology Lord to be able to do this and I very much appreciate my son Lord coming and making all of this happen and Lord it just seems so simple you're on the outside of it or you're just turning on your computer to look at it but Lord just watching Michael work now and just there's a way much more than that goes into this and I certainly appreciate him putting forth the effort to make this happen today Lord we just pray God that you'd be with each one move upon them in their separate homes God I believe that we come before you with great expectation of what you'll do for us today the Lord your anointing is an international anointing father it's good to be in one room together in one mind in one Accord but Lord we can't be in one mind in one Accord now even in our separate places because that anointing is International and Lord let it be upon each one of us father speak through these lips the word should have us to hear father and may you bless the years and the ones that are out on the hook up here out in the streaming God as they receive it - God may it be blessed may they be blessed today we pray Lord for every request and every need is made known Lord we know that our country is going through a very traumatic time right now and Lord it's uh it's a time of purging if you will in a time of hopefully maybe some people giving their hearts to you realizing the day in the hour that we live Lord and God would just pray as we have personal requests - Lord for for Dennis's wife Leah Lord and for sister she Leah's brother Harlan and for sister Norma's grandson father Jonathan and Lord for brother angel who wrote for his family and believing for his vehicle Lord there's just so many requests that we have God and I'm sure there's probably many others that weren't mentioned there's many others that weren't sent to me that God we have needs father we lifted up our hands I lifted my hands to you - Lord just expecting you father to move upon these requests and these needs and upon our hearts and lives we're so thankful father as a congregation and I'll stand here Lord as your representative father's the pastor thanking you so much for your blessings upon us and Lord through this time god of what it seems to be isolation but Lord it appears that through talking to them being in communication that Lord that's just not had much of effect Lord on us and Lord through our jobs and things that you're providing for us Lord we're so thankful God that you just are mindful of us and you should watch over us and keep us Lord my mind goes to a friend of mine Johnny green to father I learned last night that he has this covo coronavirus Lord and my brother is in need today and Lord he's not in the grade of health either knowing that for years he's had valley fever father so lord by the medical standards he would might be one of the foremost that would it would affect the most but God I pray that somehow where he is that you would move down upon him touch him and lend to God and keep your hand upon them oh I'm just thankful without being able to call upon your name today Lord and these terror and these troubles sometimes but Lord know that you're always with us in each you never leave us or forsake us lord I pray that you bless us now god help me Lord and speak these words that you have to be heard today for your congregation that each one of us would be blessed by it been committed to you and each one now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Thank You Saints let me get to the Bible now we're going to try to leave off where we are pick back up where we left off last week and I want to go to Romans chapter 8 again as we did last week I just read one verse of scripture I don't have a music stand on I always wished I had a pulpit or a Bible stand or something where we are now I don't have either one so but we have something here to provide so but all we needs a Holy Ghost us that's the number one thing we need but going to Romans chapter 8 and I'm just going to read one verse here though this time verse 33 and verse 33 says who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it amen who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth we talked last week about justification and as I mentioned to you I wanted to get a little deeper into that and I want to get into a understanding kind of where we are with the the body spirit and soul again and and you know maybe a greater understanding hopefully maybe this time on on the streaming you can see it a little better than you did last time although mica pretty one up and put it on the website for us which I appreciate that that's there for for if you want to see it if you want to follow along with us and and see how that justification works in our lives again it may not be something that people in the message especially think a whole lot of but again I think justification in the revelation of what justifications done for us can bring us to a greater understanding of who we are in Christ and and take that stand and take that ground to stand firmly on what God has done for us and who we are in him because knowing who we are you got to realize that God has justified you justification made the way for sanctification sanctification made wait for the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost made the way for the person of Christ to come live in you which is what our third heart over here is of God coming in and taking his abode in your heart so I think in fielded justifications a very important subject today I want to end up and get to the place that I've mentioned to you last week that has been in my many years of ministering and in this message I've had this come up several times especially when I'm pastoring that people would ask me questions based on a specific quote that brother Branham made the quoting made was an invisible union some of you may know what I'm talking about but I want to get to a clearer understanding I don't want to interpret what brother Adam said I don't I don't want to say what I feel brother had a meant but maybe a clearer understanding at least in my opinion of what I believe brother Branham was talking about when he made this specific statement and what he said but do that we're gonna get delve a little deeper into the justification part of it and the justification teaching here now there was some things that I said last week that in prayer when I was praying and got done praying and the Lord and impressed upon me that maybe there was some things I said last week that may have been a little misunderstanding and I want to clear that up because I said last week that the justification takes place in the soul and that's true the justification does take place in the soul that's the place that God is most concerned about the inside of the inside now we read that quote last week brother Graham talked about the inside devil has reign of the body spirit but he can't get on the inside he tries to and he is of course in the inside when were born with the nature of the children of wrath but when we're born again or when that we get justified then that old nature's gone and God wipes away all those sins that justification takes place now we'll read the scripture in a minute to try to clarify this too but I made a statement that the justification takes place in the soul where the soul is burnt out and the Holy Spirit comes and God seals you with the Holy Spirit and and that's that's that's God's justification you stand in your perfect ought to be condition which again is the word justified remember justified was in your ought to be conditioned or righteous the word righteous means that you are in standing here in perfect standing with God if you're in perfect standing with God then you're in the place that God saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world in your ought to be condition and that's where God desires us to be now we draw it out the comparison last week we talked about the body and the spirit and how somebody you make mistakes in your old life and you're dealing drugs or go back to the woman you know the story I told and go back to the woman and say you know I'm the one that Dilts your husband drugs and they killed him and and I'm sorry but I never did it you know yes you did do it see those things of the body justification although it does away with every sin that you ever did every mistake you ever made justifies it doesn't nullify God's biblical law of reaping what you sow you will always reap what you sow regardless of whether you're a child of God not a child of God born again not born again believer taught a believer whatever you are the Bible says you will reap what you sow you can't do away with that that that is the law of God that will always stand and it's always going to be true so when you when you sow to a whirlwind to the wind you weep a whirlwind so if you sow to the things of drugs and that past life you're going to reap that in the flesh but again remember I would rather be guilty in the eyes of man than in the eyes of God so the point I'm trying to make is yes justification is in the soul but God also brings about the justification in the body as well now that again the culmination of that doesn't happen until the body change when God changes this body go from corruption to incorruption and for morally in mortality but the justification we're concerned about is the soul now I bring that up because the quote that I want to get to that that is somewhat controversial on some people is going to involve every element of this it's going to involve every male of the body spirit soul it's going to involve every element so keep that in mind as we talk about this so yes justification isn't the soul that's what God is concerned about because that's God you never did it in the first place remember even in your old life and gods Minds what you did and you weren't even that person I'm not even this person I am who God made me on the inside again brother Graham said if this Bella flesh were to drop off God would be standing in front of you so that's the place that we that we understand between the soul and the body now I want to go over and remember it's God that justify it God that justified no man could lay anything to the charge of God's elect is God's it justifies now people may come and say you did so-and-so and yes you did do that but God has justified you so what else matters for he's the Lord amen I love saying that because it's true and and it's important it's an important thing to keep in mind to understand now in acts I want to go to the 13th chapter and I will eventually put my Bible down but in Acts chapter 13 I wanted to read just two verses here and then I want to go to Romans chapter 3 Romans chapter 3 I have to look at my notes every once in a while because just past 25 woke up the other day so I have quite the memory used to but I try to remember but Acts chapter 13 verse 38 and 39 let's look at this real quick it says be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man Jesus Christ is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins now I'm going to get to something - with with the understanding of the forgiveness of sins the remission of sins because he remember in acts 2:38 it says be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin the word forgiveness the word remit they all coincide with each other there's a slight difference in them just like there is there between forgiveness and justification the difference between being justified and forgiven now it may be a slight difference but the result is astronomical the result is it's a world of difference it is to me anyway but he said be don't be it known unto you therefore men and brothers that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins the forgiveness of sin God does forgive amen now the forgiveness of sin means that you did it right if you did it you can be forgiven which and forgiveness basically means that I'm going to not hold you responsible for what you did there's not going to be a penalty levied against you there's not going to be a judgment come against you I forgive you you did it but I'm forgiving you it I'm not exercising any punishment towards you remit means to be done away with amen you did it but it's being done away with it's kind of maybe the difference between the president pardons someone and commuting a sentence maybe getting off on the wrong foot here but you know the President of the United States can pardon somebody or they can commute a sentence commuting a sentences forgiveness pardon is remitting pardon means that your your record is wiped away now in the memory of man you did it but your record that they have down in some file cabinet or on some computer it's done away with commuting a sentence just means you did it but they're saying you you've you've served enough time and you've paid the price the penalty and it's okay to go free now so you see the two end up in a freedom and their liberation of the individual but it's two different situations if we commute a sentence is still on your record but you've paid the penalty a pardon is it expunges your record didn't do it you understand it - now see that's the forgiveness and the remittance it's two different things but it produces the same product but now the forgiveness of sins see a 39th verse by him Jesus all that believe are justified from all things from which he could not be justified by the law of Moses now that's where we left off last week read a couple of scriptures Galatians again we're going to get to Galatians again understanding that we are not justified by the law remember this is of course Luthor's whole message justification by faith and faith alone it's not by works it's not by anything you can do it's by God's sovereignty and your free will decision to choose and decide this is what I want this is what I choose so the difference is he you see all that God those who believe are justified from all things which he could not be justified by the law so by the law remember the law just covered sin the sin was still there the desire was still there the water was still there but the sin was covered all it was was enough to bring to bring man back into a working relationship with God again not in fellowship not in communion but a working relationship just like e-even with Abraham and David it was a working relationship was a loving relationship the love didn't change but it was a working relationship God said that am I gonna hide this thing for my prophet what I'm about to do to Abraham he's talking about well no no he said no I can't do it so he came in he told Abraham I'm gonna go and send go down and see if it's also wicked as they say it is in Sodom send his too anxious to go check and he told Abraham pay for him what he was doing he had that relationship but it wasn't until Jesus Christ came and the blood of Christ was shed that brought men and gotted man back into perfect fellowship again back to the libman ear they had in the Garden of Eden back to a perfect communion where God and man could become one that one ship is what this bride has looked to today is that invisible Union the bride in Christ uniting together could only happen after that period of time so they had that working relationship see by the law was only a covering so only that covering could not justify a man it can bring him again into a working relationship with God but it could not justify him now it brings into the difference between justification forgiveness remittance justification means you never did it never did it in the first place and the mind of God does not exist it never happened now that's the incredible power God has to forget and has the tremendous powers we know to forgive but what about the power he has to forget forgiveness just means that you remember it I just forgive you for it justification means you didn't do it you never even did it to begin with so it now justification could not be by the law but now through the blood of Jesus Christ every sin that dips into that blood is annihilated even out of the memories of God now in your body spirit you did do it in this world of acknowledgment and of memories and of records that people keep it would say yes you did it but in God's mind you never did it never existed he's the Lord but see now in in God's mind you could not be justified by the law it only covered that sin the blood of Christ annihilates that sin that's what justification completely wipes away your old life completely wipes away everything that you did in that old life amen let me read something I believe I wanted to get to here now this is in the future home now you know in future home brother branham talks about the the the earth receiving its Redemption just like the man receives its Redemption by water baptism fiery baptism and coming in living in it now in future home he talks about this and the steps that it gets to so listen real close because I know we all understand this but there's a couple of points in here I want to get to specifically future home misses in August 1964 now the first step is repentance and ask them well we know repentance is repentance towards God sincere sorrowful Nisour what you did a turning away from your old ways and delving into the new ways in Christ's first step is repentance toward God then follows that is water baptism water baptism repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine to remit amen remit our past sins just like John said or Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission now it's a remission of your past sins what you did here in the past again that's what brings us from here to here remittance brings us from a nature of the children of Wrath an indwelling of the devil to a place of cleanness to a place of being accepted into sanctification where where there is where there is no more defilement and your life begins to get cleaned up again remember that's the most dangerous spot as a person gets the lights all cleaned up and they think they're ready to go and they're a child of God and God hasn't come identified himself with you you're in the worst spot you can be in you think you're there but you're not but now now that that baptism now shows that that repentance was genuine that you're that you truly meant your repentance although people can get baptized still follow through with the emotion of being baptized and still not be right still not being right standing go God still not even have a true repentance even though they could go through the motions of being baptized but that if it's true repentance baptized remits the sin amen remember what our menses was her menses was wiping the wiping away the slate cleaning the slate Amen remitting the past sin the things that you did in the past not future sins not things that are coming but just what happened the past you repented for what you did in the past see can't repent for what you're gonna do you repent for what you did do even today as children of God we repent from what we did do not what we're going to do what we did do now the blood of Jesus Christ came to take care of what you did do and what you're going to do you repent for what we did do now that has nothing look nice in that room it's our past sin but that has nothing to do with future sins it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future just your sin that's been chopped off what you did do you can't repent from what Adam done you never did it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what you done the old nature is still there see but that but when that remittance comes it does away with all of that old sin and gets rid of the things that you did in the past and the things that we've done in the past and God forgives us for amen God God does not hold us responsible for those things but now let me get you a new scripture here probably don't even need my glasses I don't have anybody to look at no offense to my wife and my son but go Romans chapter 3 now let's go to Romans chapter 3 and I want to begin with verse 20 Romans chapter 3 verse 20 because I want to save a little bit of time to read a to read a little bit of the message there at the end of invisible union and get into the really depth of the subject that I really wanted to talk about today but now in Romans chapter 3 verse 20 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified remember notice that says no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin amen that's what brought the law brought the knowledge of and that you were doing wrong we didn't know we were doing wrong until a law came against it but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested the righteousness of the law the righteousness of God without the law Amen because a man could not become righteous with the law so it had to be outside of the law to become righteous which is the righteousness of God and praise the Lord we gotta realize we've become the very righteousness of God the righteousness of God again that's that justification that's that being justified that's in that ought to be condition okay you're in that ought to be condition with God without the law is manifested where's it manifested in me in you and those who believe and those who have been justified and those who live this life that we hold so dearly it's been done in us it's manifested in us we are the manifestation for all the world to see of the righteousness of Jesus Christ the world doesn't understand it they can't comprehend it they might make fun of it but it doesn't matter because it's still the righteousness of God witnessed by the law and the prophets so it doesn't do away with the law but it just magnifies it see even the righteousness of God 22nd verse even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference those that believe if you believe that's it now it's not belief like the devil believes it's beyond belief to getting to the understanding by revelation of what it really is for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is Jesus Christ amen now that brings into the word that brings us to the word Redemption from the justification the justification brings you into by grace brings you into that Redemption which is bringing you from where you were in the mind of God to this fallen condition to go to bypass our theophanies to go through sin to live this life to get into the place of redemption which brings us back through the blood of Christ through justification freely by the blood of Christ to bring us back into that position with God again that full Redemption has taken place the price paid for you has been done at Calvary that price was paid so when that price was paid and you accepted it you have to accept it it's your free will it brings you into that place of redemption you've been redeemed amen now we still live in these sticky fleshes these bodies but you have been redeemed you're as good as their brother Graham said we are as good as their and the mind of God were already there why because we're back in that place again we're back in that position we're no longer the Satan's Satan's pawnshop we're no longer the the millions of the world as he had us to be we were enslaved by the by the whims of the devil God has redeemed us back into our proper position now we are in our ought to be conditioned that justification has taken place that is Jesus that is Christ Jesus who God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God now that perpetuation simply means that that that that blood is still there it means just like this the the issue of justification that we talked about this last Sunday is that perpetual existence that continues to unfold and evolve in your life it's justification just like that perpetuation that blood is there it's a perpetual existence of the blood being there for that sac up of that sacrifice for you that perpetuation does not leave it takes your place it stands in your stand remember we said it's last Sunday that perpetuation is there that blood on the mercy seat is the there so that it's tan in your place it takes your place so you could take his place by the righteousness of Jesus Christ and robed in His righteousness without spot wrinkle or blemish you're justified you never do it in the first place praise the Lord man if we could just get a revelation that this probably gets a revelation of that friend we know who we are we know who we are God we don't belong to this world would I belong to the things of this world sure we hear we read right in that elements but we're not of this world we're children of God we're ready to go home we look at the things in the world that's going on today we look at this coronavirus thing you know brother now I don't think this qualifies because I don't think this is shut in the church doors but but just think about this it's just a preview of what how little it would take to close the church doors see how little it will take just in what they've done here and if you don't close your doors now I gotta be careful the Lord told me to be careful about what I'm saying on here this is out for the whole world to see so we'll talk about this at another time I feel checked because like I said we're gonna have to go the Lord checked me on what on things that I say on this dreaming so I'm going to do that but but you can see what's going on we're looking for a rapture I don't mean to be crass or hard it's not my job to find a cure for coronavirus it's my job to preach the gospel I'm not responsible for for the virus for the cure of the virus I'm responsible for praying for those and for praying for Humanity and praying for God's people but God brings things on this earth that that that is just very well his perfect will and far be it for me or any of us to try to pray against God's perfect will but I love people I love humans I love I don't like to see one per one person dying from this and it's been a very small amount of people really honestly this give their lives to this but one is too many especially if it's your loved one so I don't mean it in that way I want I want you know my heart I want everybody to go and if I can do anything to help or save eating I can't save anyone but help bring it to that point in somebody then I want to do it a man now but this one so we've gone through the understanding that perpetual existence perpetuation perpetual existence the remission the the justification the justification did end with looser it began with Luther it continues on now justification didn't end when you got the Holy Ghost it's still you're still justifying all the time every day completely your slate being wiped clean amen he says to declare 26 verse now to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just you think Christ is just Amen he's just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus now he couldn't be the just fire he himself wasn't just but he is just that that makes him to come to justifier now you think well that's Jesus that that's God of course it is but what did he tell Peter he said I give to you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bound on earth is bound in heaven whatsoever you loose on earth is loosed in heaven whatsoever since you ran it they are remitted think about that that's quite an understanding to believe as a child of God I mean the the Bible says Jesus said do you not do you not know that the Saints shall judge the earth right I mean these great powers and authorities of God's Word are given into our possession God has given these things to us this is our responsibility let's not take it lightly I don't take this lightly some of you think they think Whitey's Manny's still in the cotan time cuz this is Church I don't take this lightly friend this is this is church to me wherefore is boasting them it is it is excluded by what law of works neighbor by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law justified by faith praise the Lord now it's your faith where's the faith come from you said well faith in the body is faith in the spirit the faith come from my feet might my free will the faith come from my free moral agency to believe let's got to it's got to come from your free choice he's if it doesn't come from your free choice or free desire to have faith to believe that where does it come from that's where God dwells in faith amen now I want to transition over backing into a couple quotes I want to read one one here I want to read to begin with from last week but I want I want to try to start to transition now into to give me a little more time transition into what I really wanted to talk about today and get into the specifics of that one quote because that that's going to take me just a little bit of time but we'll get to it here this again why Christ we could read this last week right why Christ feet and Clarksville Tennessee October 59 now God is not going to hold a man responsible because he is a sinner because he was remembered sentient brother Ram said a sinner can't sin that's that's just what he is because he was born a sinner but what God is going to hold a man responsible for is because that he remains a sinner he don't have to remain the center for there is a provision made for his justification through Jesus Christ so we understand what happened in the Garden of Eden and then everybody came into this world shades anybody come to the world speaking lies we were all by nature the children of Wrath our nature our soul commanded us to lie steal cheat steal we talked about that last week little boy come and knock the lamp over you know it's nobody taught him that that was his nature we come into that nature because of the fall in the Garden of Eden but that wasn't your fault it wasn't my fault but it is my fault if I don't choose the way of escape that God has prepared for us through Jesus Christ in his blood that's what God's gonna hold a man responsible for now if we go into the Garden of Eden one look at this real quick and and get into and please part of me I'm not I'm not picking I really want to bring this to a complete understanding and of course you got to understand and draw the difference between a worldly woman and a godly woman a Holy Ghost field respectful lady versus a woman of the world say there's a whole big difference there it's amazing how you see these Hollywood stars are now saying we're all in this together with this coronavirus no we're not we're not all in this together we don't all have hundred acre ranches or 10,000 square foot penthouses we don't all have home theaters and bowling alleys and back to basketball courts and tennis courts and go roaming around wherever we want to many of the people this country don't have how hundreds of thousand dollars pouring into their account every day most those people could not if they didn't get a penny for any work they did for the next 12 months and still be multimillionaires so yeah no we're not in this together there's there's a big difference they're trying to draw and and and and bring together that separation frame the separation between Hollywood and the common man is so far removed this was bigger than the Grand Canyon but the world in half and you might have an idea of the difference of the gulf between those people in the common American citizen but but I do want to talk about this situation and this this Lord will it will be the beginning of what I want to talk about on this let me read a quote first all right let me read a scripture first let's go to first Timothy and I was gonna do this second let's go to first Timothy let's see begin with the twelfth first first Timothy one chapter chapter one verse 12 as Paul of course from the writings of Timothy he says and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who had enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer now what did Jesus say was gonna happen to those that blaspheme the Holy Ghost they would not be forgiven in this world of the world to come see but what did Saul who became Paul do and what was his Proclamation what was the defining line that Paul drew for us to understand where God's grace is and where the law is or were the justification is and were the unforgiveness or non justification is look what he says who was a blasphemer and we know he was and a persecutor and injurious but I obtained mercy obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief now you see where Paul's talking about and and we see where he draws the difference he draws the variance between doing it unknowingly he didn't know now remember and brother man has told us many times by the Greek used to tell us that's not going to hold people responsible for what they don't know now there are those people you can go to believe it's 1st Peter chapter 3 there are those people that are willfully ignorant and there's a difference there's a difference in those that obtain knowledge or or get a small understanding of something but decide to remain willfully ignorant there's a difference in being willfully ignorant in just not knowing see and and and the willfully ignorant is not going to be excused but you see now in the course nowadays no ignorance is going to be excused and God used a weakened ignorance it doesn't we get it anymore because there's so many ways to have a knowledge of it but again if those who don't know they just don't know see and and and and God takes that into consideration if they don't know ignorant Paul said he did it ignorant Lee through unbelief so that ignorant once he obtained the knowledge or once he obtained see if he did it ignorantly and Jesus came and then a pillar of cloud and struck him down and said why persecutest thou me and he got up and continued on to the road to Damascus - to hand those orders and to continue to follow the bidding of the high priests then he would be cut off that of any right but it's sort of like the woman that was caught in the act of adultery we know what the Bible says about being caught in the act of adultery she should be stoned to death she was caught in the very act but when she came to Jesus Jesus said where that accusers she said I have none he says neither do i condemn thee but what did he say first year without sin cast the first stone ye without sin cast the first stone he said where are thy accusers I don't have any they walked away one at a time and he said neither do i condemn thee go and don't do it again sin no more and she's got that knowledge and she received grace by that knowledge now what she did after that was her choice I personally don't believe she went back into that I don't believe God would have gave her the chance if he knew that he she was going to go back into that Paul didn't either Saul became Paul and he didn't go back into that he left that and started met Ananias and started the life of the gospel of Christ so there's there's your there's your variance so let's read this invisible Union now most of what I'm going to be talking about now is going to come from invisible Union if you want a message to listen to this week listen to invisible Union I also got a scripture when once you read another scripture I mentioned last week Psalms 56 11 hope you all read that I will David said I will not fear what man shall do unto me but I want you to read job 3:25 read job 325 this week and then see if those things don't apply to the day that we're living amen but now look what are you saying now taking into account what Paul said did it ignorantly invisible union so listen that message this week when you get a chance there really couldn't be an excuse because pretty much all of your home now you should have the opportunity to be able to listen to it he says now look it look what Hollywood has done to the woman look how it has robbed the sacred virtues of the woman on and on we could go see all this she lost she did she she how did she do it because there was a subtle instrument called the church the church not the bride the church made her feel like she was okay make it look like it's okay you know but it's but it wasn't like there like there was in the Garden of Eden a subtle person the devil walked into the church just like he did in the Garden of Eden and deceived her into it deceived her into it she is deceived the woman thinks she don't mean to be wrong Eve didn't mean to be wrong listen that very close friend Eve didn't mean to do wrong it wasn't wilfully again draw the comparison first Peter 3 willfully ignorant to the point brother Bam's talking to you think about Paul Paul said I did it ignorantly through unbelief not willfully but through unbelief well Graham say she was deceived into it now understand this was 20 days before brother Branham but before his accident one month before brother Brown passed away this message was preached one month November 25th 1965 so he says she was deceived she didn't mean to do it it wasn't willfully so keep that in mind it wasn't willfully the Bible said in 2nd Timothy 3 now I'm sorry I never correct brother branham but I've got it but that's the wrong scripture he says second Timothy three its first Timothy two I went back I knew that's where it was but then I read this and I thought I was wrong so I went back to check my Bible and unless my Bible is printed wrong it is first Timothy - it is not second Timothy three but you know what that just tells me brother Ben was a man brother branham was just a man he was subject to make mistakes just like the rest of us are and I believe comes to the Bible out of the word I should say nobody comes to that anointing or the say at the Lord so we'll just say it this way the Bible said so if you go back can you see this quote you'll know I'm correcting it the Bible said in first Timothy two she was deceived and deceived is not when you willfully do it was deceived is not when you willfully do it amen so you understand that's what he's talking about and he and he and he brings it into a into a today he brings it into a what Hollywood has even done to the woman and how I believe through that quote that he's actually drawing into the way that that that things are today and why they are is because it's come from a certain element it's come from a certain product and that deception has come into humanity and women are that way and brother bam talked about you want to see how the church is watch the way the women are doing and you see how they're doing and you see that's mostly how the church is going to be I mean you go down and you see the churches or you drive down and watch them in ting out on the Sunday you'll see that's exactly the way they are then the fads and fashions of Hollywood is all over them that's that's their influence but but let's move on and and get and but hold on to that because that's the first part of that that I want to say to understand about Eve to understand about Paul to understand about the willfully ignorant lead through a belief okay so we draw that difference here now again staying an invisible Union because I want to hit this before I get to the quote I want to talk about I want to read this is this is very powerful to me so listen real close you can again go home you can read it now if you got it you want to listen to it later do it though invisible Union again when you are separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual Union not your natural life of the things of the world amen remember we're trying to draw understand the the comparison beget the contrast between words of justification is how it takes place what God holds responsible and not hold responsible Amen now because that's very important reborn again not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you there's that little spot you might not even see it on the camera but go printout if you want to if you haven't seen it before go printout it on our website they'll print out that proud that Micah did force you see that little seed right there in the middle of the soul that seed was always there again go read it first John chapter three and you know tell you about that seed and how that seed remaineth in there and when that seed is there that person cannot sin you never have sin again that's I said that last week may sound completely radical may not be something that a lot of people would like to hear but friend you never sinned you never did not if you're over here you didn't aren't you're born again filled with the Spirit of God not if you're one of his not if you're righteous and your ought to be condition is you were in the mind of God you never did you never sinned period old like new life never sinned here you do read put yourself but fortunately as life continues on we start sewing all the good seed so what we reap is from the good seed you're not the bad seed amen now that germ praise the Lord that germ that seed that was he knew at the beginning a germ as a seed amen know in the mail the Germans to see it's the life the hemoglobin to blood see I'm saying that because that's important to what we're getting ready to get to as well see but that seed is in there it found you amen it was always there and just come to life just come to life now your old book is gone with your old union remember the book of life we went through the book of life Lamb's Book of Life that old book of your old union and it's gone now your name is then been transferred do you mean to tell me that old book God has put it in his sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God amen now I hear you shouting I know even Dennis's way out on the east side I hear you praise for you never did it you stand perfectly before God now you are not only you're not only forgiven but you are justified glory justified Romans 5:1 says therefore be justified by faith look up the word brother Mountain challenges even other man challenges look up the word the word don't mean forgiven amen we kind of already went to that forgiving remittance justified now he says look the word don't mean forgiven remember what is forgiven me it means that you did it but we're just not going to hold you accountable to it we're not going to punish you or punish you any further for having done it see that's forgiving I forgive you for it like we have the power to forgive those and we should we should forgive those anything if anybody has done against us that forgiveness should be their friend you don't hold you hold on to that bitterness and you don't let it go that unforgiving that bitterness in your heart will destroy you it'll not destroy you just spiritually a little it'll send you to an early grave you got to let that go but now forgiveness now doesn't mean justify the word the word means just but it don't mean you are forgiven for instance you hear that I got drunk and done some evil things and everything then you come around and say to me you found out that I didn't do that that wasn't me then you come and say well brother round I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it in the first place it wasn't me you see that wasn't me never did it that wasn't me that was something that was somebody else that wasn't me cuz I am this germ that's who I am see a man never did it that wasn't me see I saw you do something no it was somebody else and he met some may I looked old I liked me but that wasn't me that wouldn't mean this is me right here and this again that is the owner of the soul which is the nature of the Spirit which is the life of the body so now all your tastes male feel here see all your recent memory conscious affection imagination are all controlled if we allow it is still our choice is still our choice free will free moral agency is controlled by that seed by that light by that spirit amen I love that praise the Lord now you are not only forgiving you stand perfectly before God you are justified now if I did it I am guilty and you could forgive me and I and I would and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I am not justified because I actually did it but the word justified is this though as if though you've never done it I hope we're getting the understanding of that now see it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead and is not even in the memories of God amen you are justified therefore being justified you are accused but you never did it in the first place hallelujah the old union is in the sea of God's forgiveness you weren't married to it in with bridegroom boy shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestined for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed that germ any man you are that predestinated see Amen I don't know brother Roger if you're watching but this confinements kind of rough on me right now well I'd like to be running back and forth I am feeling pretty good now did you now how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent even is not any fault of your own by your natural birth you come after eat who committed adultery that is the reason you are born an adulteress you were a sinner to begin with that is right you were deceived into it you had no it isn't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world when God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life that is who you are that seed is who you really are that's where God sees you that's where God places you in his mind that perfect place praise the Lord Amen thank you Lord how we can stand perfect before God other people see our faults and mistakes I see my faults and mistakes my wife sure sees them she probably sees more than I do but that's not me Amen that's not me not if you're born again amen but again as that as that spirit has control that is a gift pit doesn't give a person the license to just sin and live any way they want the grace doesn't give a man to the The Amazing Grace doesn't give the man the right to just live anyhow he wants that Amazing Grace comes in to us that we don't make a disgrace out of it because we allow him to move into our spirit into our body and let that let that manifestation that evidence show itself in our lives that we are the children of God it's not it's not much of a manifestation print if it doesn't show through us who he is in us it's not much of a manifestation is only a manifestation if we're living according to his word if we're lit only living according to his ordinances to be obedient to him amen now let's get to this as I'm going to close after this quote brother Branham mates in this same message invisible Union he may be very familiar to some of you maybe not at all to others of you but I'm gonna read it for the beginning of the message again invisible Union this is October 25th 1965 listen close a woman isn't trusted with certain characters that she must not defile a woman is trusted to that there's not a creature on the earth like a woman and that is true there's not Solomon said a good one's a crown his jewel and his crowning of bad ones water in his blood and Solomon should know because that he had some bad ones there is no female dog there's no female of any kind entrusted with a character that a woman is now once you understand what a character is now a person has a character that is a part of their nature it's a part of their spirit I should say it's their upbringing and your characters molded in your spirit of the things you heard or the things you saw or the things that were part of your life that shaped you when you were young shaped you in your spirit and and and all that has an effect through your whole life that chase you into the character person that you are today my son can play the piano like there's no tomorrow I don't think I could play chopsticks my daughter could there's things my wife could paint and draw that just is part of her nature part of her character you see my drawings my drawings become letters that's a hunting trip on I can't draw a dove keep draw snake of snakes how can a person not draw a snake but that's not my character I've just that's not something I can do but I don't know you know how many people have the character to stand up the past hour do what I've been doing it is just God makes us all different for different reasons so that that brings about a person's character but this character brother Graham is talking about we're going to keep reading it so they'll become more enlightened to you but this character is not because because our character that I just discussed is our individual character we each one have our own character or characteristics this brother branham is placing on the entire female population understand human population the entire female human population is entrusted with a character so that brings us to the second definition of what a character is a character is also a physical part of your being like my mind my finger is is is of a certain character this mole I have is a little dot it's a certain character that I have but not everybody has that in fact probably nobody else has it at least not exactly like I do where I have it but that is a character of mine police work use characters all the time scar or birthmark or tattoo or something they use as a character in in if they get a picture or someone sees a crime and they look at that person they say well you had a tattoo that looks like this or he had a big scar on his face or something like that that's a character that that is a part of that person is a physical element that's on the outside and when you talk about a specific character that brother branham is mentioning that the entire one entire gender of the human race has this character that that woman is entrusted with okay so we're all adults I hope we make it a little deeper I don't want to get too specific but maybe we understand what we're talking about the character that every woman every female human as was born with a woman was not even in the beginning of creation because God knew that she would fall all other females see God knew God knew she would fall but the woman did not do it willfully okay all other females could not commit adultery she is the only one that can commit adultery if she had been like the original that would have been discomfiting to God's great wisdom see she was made a byproduct of the man but because she was cast over in that side she has also been given a sacred listening she has this character and she has also so this is in addition that brother Graham's making she has also been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption think about that a sacred charge of God was given to them when you get to understand that's just powerful that people want to say I'm a woman can't do this woman can't do this can't have a gift can't prophesy whatever look friends look at what look how God felt about the helpmate that he gave to Adam the helpmate that he gives each of us the the the female race the the gender of our race look she's been given a sacred from God for reduction now we already talked about what we're doing she was right it was a bring from one place to the next this woman from the beginning of Eve she was the mother of all living from the beginning and Eve was given by God from the beginning of creation and I remember she was a byproduct cuz he knew she would fall he knew she would fall so he'd give her that character and he entrusted her with that sacred charge for redemption what is that of bringing life into the world do you think about that breaking like the woman God entrusted the woman that's powerful with the ability the only one that could bring life into this world that's incredible God entrusted it with a woman Lorna's life come from life comes from God he said what the blood comes from the mouth the hemoglobin she has that yeah but she's the one that brings that male force she's the one that holds that baby under her heart for nine months she's the one that's entrusted to bring that life forth into the world yeah the Bible says it was with Genesis and the curse and you know what I'm talking about and in I forgot the exact words but you know what he talks about the curse the Garden of Eden she'll suffer in all of bringing forth life but she's entrusted with that life with life youth with why friend think about it life I mean that's what this whole thing is bound I mean in this same message by the man I'm talking to talked about how it may actually be am I writing here in the might thing you said life is sacred to God every life is sacred to God and is written in a book my and the woman is entrusted with that so she's given that character and she's entrusted with the sacred charge of redemption that redemption to bring humanity back to the place that it was hey that's what we're all going to people fussing fight about going back to Pentecost not worry about going back to Pentecost I want to go back to the Garden of Eden I want to go back to that place was perfect I want to make it to that pyramid-shaped mountain that's that new city Jerusalem that we're looking for though everything every wrong is made right all the life has brought together that full place of redemption what she's given that charge it's a beautiful thing to me she has got characters though listen now that she must not defy her she must not defile I was going to read this a character of Mark the definition the character is a mark brand or stamp a sign placed on an object amen now it can't be her virginity pardon me I'm getting language but it couldn't be that because that also applies to the male this is only for the female only for the woman see so it can't be that it's got to be a physical mark a physical stamp that you must not defile if she would Mar or do physical injury not this not spiritual amen this has nothing to do with the soul or spirit this is a physical marring this is a physical injury if she were to Mar them she is defiled what for lifetime for lifetime in this life so this line has got to be something physical because it's only lasting for this lifetime amen she's defiled for a lifetime no matter how much she is forgiven she can't be justified there's the quote a lot of people so many people just take that she can be forgiven but not justified and they'll just go to seat on it and say see there the woman can't be justified that would be absolutely contrary to God's Bible and this message to think that if a woman made a mistake like that and unknowingly doing it I mean what was Jesus doing with the woman caught the act of adultery then and said neither do i condemn you what is he doing if this holds true to what a lot of people believe why would Jesus and tell that woman that I don't continue just don't go don't go do it again what's her character defiled yes it was was it marred beyond replacing yes now I've heard people they talk about the doctor can do a physical operation or something and make it back the way it was no that's not what he's talking about amen once that seal is broken it's broken and he's broken for life for life it will never go back to the place that it was it can't if his broken is broken for lifetime no matter what she does she can be forgiven because of the act that she did but not justified how can she not be justified not in here but in this body not in the spirit not in the soul in the body because it's a lifetime who what is the one thing that does not exist beyond this lifetime this body that's the one thing that does not last beyond a lifetime well of course she can't be justified she can't ever go back and physically make that right it's not possible I don't care what doctors can do operations I'm not worried about I'm talking about what he's talking about once that seal is broke is broke and that's what he's talking about he's not talking about a woman not being able to be justified he's not talking about a woman not being able to go back or be kids born out of wedlock or anything that's not what he's talking about all that justification is still there free and clear for anybody who accepts it and wants it anybody who's made that mistake can go back and make it right any God's eyes they never did it no they can't be justified in this body absolutely not remember you reap what you sow there's always going to be the repercussions no matter who you are to reap what you sow that sowing was done in the body there's no way to justify that no way physically for her to go back other brands are talking about he's not talking about a woman not being able to be justified in the eyes of God as completely this complementary to everything that we know of God in his Bible in God's message it's everything against it so what's he talking about he's talking about that physical character that a woman is entrusted with him when that seals broke it's broke it's broke for lifetime she cannot go back justified it can't be fixed it's always that way she can be forgiven for her defilement that she cannot be justified that's a physical thing it has nothing to do with God's justifying of the person in their life in their heart and their soul because even was that act was taking place that scene was still there you can't tell me that scene is there that even though they'd done something wrong in their body or strung themselves out on drugs or whatever it is this defilement is no different than that has the difference in the sacred trust that God give but it has nothing to do with the justification Amen nothing to do with the justification a woman can be just as justified in that situation as anybody but she can't go physically back and be justified in her flesh for that specific thing that specific character once it's marred once that physical injury has been done or that that character has been marred it cannot go back listen I hope that makes sense she cannot be justified where I'm reading again now she cannot be justified in this life in this life physical I think I made that point clear so I'm gonna move on she cannot be justified in this life it is always with her okay so I hope that makes it abundantly clear what we're talking about there's big question on that a man has nothing to do with God looking at you in your ought to be conditioned as being justified amen yeah your body's still the same it's like I said the other day I've got a I've got a cut right here I got when I was working at leaner stuff across the street over here with a knife I cut and sliced my hand right there and Gallus into my pink ear and the scarves are still there you know what those cars I'll never be justified in this lifetime of those scars never they'll always be there I'll always be able to see them I'll always know they're there I've got other parts that have had scars like that never it will never be justified until the body change it'll never be justified it'll always be like that amen now if I did it against somebody I could be forgiven I forgive myself I guess for being stupid but that's what costs the cut but I can never be justified in this life it'll always be that way amen now her body is given to her a sacred trust from God no female dog and a bird no animal no with a creature like that she is the only one by this is the reason it is sacred is she is to bring forth life into the earth her body is a bedding grounds of life therefore that is the reason that she has given that sacred trust praise the Lord think about that how beautiful that is it's it's it just to me it that entrustment that God gave whatever people want to say and think about it that that God gives for that justification for for that entrustment that he gave to be able to be justified to bring life into the world it is incredible it's no wonder it's the way it is now again I hope that float makes more sense in this life it can't be justified in this life it's always with her this can't be justified it's always with me always gonna miss gonna be a reminder over on them it's going to be a reminder of how how you don't try to separate two pieces of chicken frozen together with a butcher knife between your hand don't do it and it's reminder I'll never do that again but it's always with me can never leave it's always with her it can never leave but in here she's justified she never did it praise the Lord she never did it now we know this is Palm Sunday we know next week next sunday is Easter Sunday doesn't look like and that concludes what I wanted to talk today and it it doesn't look like we're gonna be able to have a regular Sunday service I don't know people doing for sunrise services or whatever but Lord willing I guess we'll just if nothing changes between now and next Sunday we'll try to do this again and I had something from this that that I wanted to lead into an Easter message and pray it be a blessing but that that that Easter part that I wanted to talk about there's a couple of I think valuable little nuggets in there that so that I trust to be a blessing to you but anyway just remember keep that into mind that and then that's why I tried to explain earlier the difference of the body and the soul and the justification the part that God looks that part that God cares about the the part that God's most concerned with amen and and realize if you read that quote or somebody tries to bring you that quote to think that a woman cannot be justified is absolutely irresponsible scripturally it's in her lifetime that physical mark amen so I hope that made sense and I hope it was a blessing to you today there's so much more actually to justification but don't have time to go into it but we'll go ahead and close the service today like I said next week I want to talk about a little bit more but we'll talk about you have an Easter message and we'll see if the Lord goes from there and see where this coronavirus takes us and what happens friends but God is in control amen and we trust him and fatica ly for everything and believe that everything's working together for our good I miss you all love you so very much appreciate you amen Sonja's been able to go out and visit a couple of you be
