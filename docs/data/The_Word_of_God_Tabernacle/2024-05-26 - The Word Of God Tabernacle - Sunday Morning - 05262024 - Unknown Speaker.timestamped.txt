[34:01] recognition how the devil's fighting us
[34:04] oh Jesus we know that enticing Spirits
[34:08] are challenging the word daily it's like
[34:11] the prophet said it's not the big things
[34:14] we do for God it's the little things we
[34:16] leave undone am it just takes one little
[34:21] thing in our lives that we fail or
[34:24] refuse to line up with your word and
[34:27] that'll keep keep us out of your kingdom
[34:29] father it's just that sobering and Lord

[35:21] one thing that'll keep us away from you
[35:24] father Jesus yes Lord and Lord It's the
[35:27] little things the um inability and the

[35:40] of God J that we refuse to come to your
[35:45] house of worship Lord I heard your
[35:48] Prophet said if Christ is truly in your

[47:18] and mercy that you give to us that you

[47:22] unmar favor God that you give us Lord in

[47:30] God in your spirit and what you have for
[47:32] us do for us give to us every day Lord
[47:36] lead guide and direct us into all your
[47:38] word into all your truths to do that God
[47:41] that would be pleasing only to you Lord
[47:44] may you just bless this service Lord may
[47:46] you continue upon the remaining part of
[47:48] it to speak to us from your word Lord
[47:51] show us in here what you'd have us to
[47:53] see and know whatever it might be God to
[47:55] encourage us Lord to strengthen us Lord
[47:57] to correct us to Lord to bring us to a
[48:00] place of Greater understanding whatever
[48:02] it may be God lord we don't have
[48:04] anything new there's no new message
[48:06] there's as Solomon said there's new
[48:08] nothing new Under the Sun yes Lord we
[48:11] had no no new message Lord but just to
[48:14] bring about and reiterate those things
[48:16] God that we go through in life every day
[48:18] that exemplifies your word and Lord just
[48:21] to let it illuminate in our hearts in
[48:24] our lives God every day we re every
[48:27] demonic spirit that would try to hurt
[48:28] hinder or infiltrate this service in any
[48:31] way that you get the glory honor and
[48:33] praise for all that is said and done
[48:35] accomplish in this service now Lord that
[48:37] that you set it forth for God in your
[48:40] mind before the foundation of this the
[48:42] world this this service took place
[48:45] accomplish now in us what you would have
[48:47] it to be done we'll thank you and praise
[48:49] you for all of it Lord and give you
[48:51] glory and honor in the name of the Lord
[48:53] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen 2
[48:57] Corinthians chapter 10 1 verse verse 5
[49:00] amen casting down
[49:03] imaginations and every High thing that
[49:05] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[49:08] God and bringing into captivity every
[49:11] thought to The Obedience of Christ amen
[49:15] you can be seated if you
[49:18] like Christ the
[49:21] word bringing everything into obedience
[49:24] to Christ the word now we know that uh
[49:27] as we go back and and bring back some
[49:29] parts that we had to mention before the
[49:31] last couple of times that we talked on
[49:33] this uh this will be the Gateway part
[49:36] three the mind uh I want to reiterate
[49:39] and go back to understanding that uh
[49:42] that in in the Garden of Eden brother
[49:44] brandom expressed to us that uh that the
[49:48] choice was made there uh of what part of
[49:50] the person what part of the human uh
[49:53] that the devil would choose Satan chose
[49:55] the mind uh I believe there's a very
[49:57] good reason why he chose the mind
[49:58] because he recognized him being God's
[50:01] right hand man at one time that U if he
[50:03] chose any other part that at some point
[50:06] he would have no gate to get into so you
[50:09] understand what I mean by that is that
[50:11] him knowing what God's plan was that he
[50:15] knew that we would be at this place to
[50:17] be born again yes if we and when we
[50:20] reach the place of of a new birth he
[50:23] knew that at that point he would be
[50:25] sealed out of any part that he could get
[50:28] to us he chose the mind because even
[50:32] though he would be sealed out of the
[50:34] Soul by the new birth of those that
[50:36] received the new birth in their soul he
[50:38] knew that that being uh that being shut
[50:40] out from that that he had still have
[50:43] access to you through your mind through
[50:45] your mental faculties so he chose the
[50:48] place that he knew that he could try to
[50:50] get to to bring defilement now he knows
[50:53] the greatest defilement of course would
[50:54] be the defiling of the Soul we're going
[50:56] to we're going to read a little bit
[50:57] about that in a minute but uh but he
[50:59] could not do that uh it when it came to
[51:03] the time that those that were to be born
[51:05] again by the spirit of God received the
[51:08] spirit of God to become like Jesus
[51:10] Christ and for Jesus to be sealed in the
[51:15] soul and for the devil to be sealed out
[51:17] right if the devil had chose that part
[51:20] and God sealed him out of that part he
[51:22] would have absolutely no access to you
[51:25] whatsoever now none period no way to get
[51:29] to you at all amen but God chose the
[51:33] heart God chose the soul God chose the
[51:36] place of Faith Now understand we talked
[51:38] about of course the body the seed taste
[51:40] F smell here we talk about we understand
[51:43] the spirit the imagination conscience
[51:45] infection reason memory and those five
[51:47] senses Outlets that enter into the
[51:49] spirit but we recognize that the soul is
[51:52] the place of faith brother bam calls it
[51:55] the sixth sins the six sin is the place
[51:59] of faith and that's the place that that
[52:01] that God chose understanding that the
[52:04] only way to be able to come to God the
[52:07] only way to believe God the only way to
[52:10] know that God exists is by faith amen
[52:14] amen we must have faith and that faith
[52:16] comes from the soul now if that soul is
[52:19] not born again if that soul is not
[52:21] sealed by the Holy Spirit then uh that
[52:24] faith is a perverted faith amen cuz that
[52:27] faith will only reach out to the things
[52:29] that it could then uh imagine or see or
[52:32] feel or something that that is attached
[52:34] to the body or spirit amen that Faith
[52:37] would be a perverted faith that reason
[52:39] that faith is a pure faith in the soul
[52:41] of of a person is by the spirit of God
[52:44] dwelling in there that's why God chose
[52:47] that because it's that place of Faith
[52:49] understanding you don't under you don't
[52:51] you don't know God with your mind you
[52:54] don't believe God with your mind you
[52:56] don't understand god with your mind it
[52:59] comes from the soul it comes from the
[53:01] heart it comes from that place of faith
[53:03] and believing that God is amen the new
[53:07] birth is the place that makes the soul
[53:10] off limits to the devil amen that place
[53:15] uh that new birth makes the soul off
[53:17] limits to the devil now let's go uh read
[53:20] a story here real quick and and just
[53:22] delve into the point that I wanted to
[53:23] get to this morning St Mark chapter 5
[53:29] Mark chapter 5 I'm going to begin with
[53:31] the first
[53:33] verse three of the gospels record this
[53:36] story and from what I know of the
[53:38] scripture this is probably the one
[53:41] story uh outside maybe even the Rich
[53:44] Young Ruler that is very different book
[53:47] to book uh if you read this same story
[53:52] uh in each of the three books that it's
[53:54] recorded in it's uh
[53:57] without Revelation without understanding
[53:59] without faith faith is a revelation
[54:01] without faith to know where God is
[54:03] bringing us in the scripture people say
[54:06] oh well it just contradicts itself amen
[54:09] because as it talks about here a man
[54:13] actually in Matthew it says two men two
[54:16] people so without understanding without
[54:19] revelation of what the scripture and of
[54:21] course the point of views and the things
[54:23] that are brought by each by each man
[54:25] that wrote that gopel
[54:27] uh a person would say well why would I
[54:29] want to believe this it doesn't even
[54:31] agree with itself right amen but this is
[54:34] now there's other stories that's
[54:36] recorded in a gospel two or three
[54:38] gospels but this is one that I found
[54:41] that's probably the most different as it
[54:43] is written from different points of view
[54:45] that is that is different so uh keep
[54:48] that in mind as we read through this
[54:50] because it'll be a story that'll come
[54:51] back to your mind I though you've read
[54:53] it heard it preached on before but as it
[54:55] comes back your mind that that'll elicit
[54:58] that part of your brain chapter 5 Mark 5
[55:02] I usually take this story out of Matthew
[55:04] Matthew's actually Matthews is kind of
[55:07] my favorite depiction of this story but
[55:09] uh for particular reasons I picked the
[55:11] one out of Mark this time and they came
[55:13] over look now fifth verse of St Mark uh
[55:17] uh fifth chapter first verse and they
[55:19] came over unto the other side of the sea
[55:21] into the country of the gines and when
[55:24] he had come out of the ship
[55:26] immediately there met him out of the
[55:29] tombs a man with an unclean Spirit a man
[55:33] now again if you go back into Matthew it
[55:36] says two here it says a man with an
[55:40] unclean Spirit but look what it
[55:41] continues to as the story continues to
[55:45] unfold a a a man with an unclean Spirit
[55:49] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[55:53] no man could bind him no not not with
[55:56] chains not with chains this man could
[55:59] not be bound with chains could not be
[56:02] fettered with
[56:04] chains because that he had been often
[56:07] bound with feeds and
[56:10] chains and the chains had been plucked
[56:13] aunder by him and the feeds broken in
[56:17] pieces neither could any man tame or
[56:20] that is to subdue him this man was that
[56:24] the spirit that was in this man
[56:26] gave him Supernatural strength to be
[56:29] able when a chain come on him or a Fed
[56:31] come on him or a dozen men try to come
[56:33] on him he would break them all and beat
[56:35] them all amen so he just dwelt in the
[56:38] tombs trying to find anything in anybody
[56:42] that he could deceive but this man was
[56:45] bound amen Bound by this Spirit not
[56:48] bound by the feds not bound by the
[56:50] chains but Bound by the spirit that
[56:53] demonic spirit that had gotten a hold of
[56:55] this man's mind
[56:56] had gotten a hold of this man's even
[56:58] into his Spirit had gotten a hold of
[57:00] this man to where this man didn't wasn't
[57:04] even himself now and always night and
[57:07] day he was in the mountains and in the
[57:09] tombs crying and cutting himself with
[57:12] stones now uh you see how that in itself
[57:15] is a very demonic trait amen The Cutting
[57:20] of oneself is a demonic trait amen let's
[57:25] let's we'll come back to this but let's
[57:27] go to one another scripture uh because
[57:29] this isn't the only place that is
[57:31] referred to that the cutting of oneself
[57:35] as a demonic act right as as a as an
[57:38] evil spirit that causes people to do
[57:41] that uh that causes people to defile
[57:44] their bodies uh by The Cutting of their
[57:47] skin and putting ink in there uh it's a
[57:50] demonic act I I see people that think I
[57:54] guess they think they're doing a great
[57:56] thing with crosses and pictures of Jesus
[57:59] and big black and all on their arms and
[58:01] all but that's a defilement of of the of
[58:04] the the temple that is supposed to house
[58:07] God himself it's a defilement of their
[58:10] bodies it's a cutting of their bodies
[58:12] you have to cut your skin it's not all
[58:15] the way down to where you bleed but is a
[58:17] cutting of the skin to inject ink into
[58:20] your body right but look that's not the
[58:23] only place that is referred to First
[58:25] Kings uh chapter
[58:28] 18 verse 25 this is Mount Carmel
[58:31] Showdown uh with
[58:33] Elijah uh First Kings 18 verse 25 and
[58:38] Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal of
[58:41] Baal the prophets of ba and we talked
[58:43] about Baal a couple months ago we know
[58:46] the evilness of that Spirit choose you
[58:49] one Bullock for yourselves and dress it
[58:52] first for ye are for ye are many and
[58:56] call on the name of your God's
[59:00] plural but put no fire under and they
[59:03] took the bulock which was given them and
[59:06] they dressed it and called on the name
[59:08] of Bale from morning even until noon
[59:11] saying oh Bale hear us but there was no
[59:15] voice nor any that answered and they
[59:19] leaped upon the altar which was made now
[59:22] again these are evil spirits these are
[59:24] evil people of false prophets uh being
[59:28] influenced by evil spirits right it came
[59:31] to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them
[59:35] and said cry aloud for he is a God
[59:38] either he is uh talking or he is
[59:41] pursuing or he is in a journey or maybe
[59:44] he's
[59:46] asleep amen Elijah's making fun of them
[59:50] oh he's God he's a God but you know he
[59:54] could be asleep uh maybe he's gone on a
[59:57] trip and he can't hear you maybe he's on
[59:59] the phone maybe he's in conversation
[1:00:02] with somebody else maybe he's gone and
[1:00:04] take a siesta who knows maybe your God
[1:00:07] just ain't reachable right now did you
[1:00:10] imagine or pervent pervent he sleepeth
[1:00:14] and must be awake and they cried aloud
[1:00:17] and cut
[1:00:20] themselves after their manner now notice
[1:00:23] how this cutting is after their manner
[1:00:26] what is their manner evil devil satanic
[1:00:30] right cutting themselves after their
[1:00:33] manner with lives uh uh knives and
[1:00:36] latches till the blood gust out upon
[1:00:40] them that in itself helps you understand
[1:00:43] these were the worshippers of the false
[1:00:46] god baale they were evil demonic spirits
[1:00:50] and their custom was to cut theirselves
[1:00:53] now if you don't tell me that that is
[1:00:55] not evil trait in the scripture I don't
[1:00:58] know I don't know how else to Define it
[1:01:01] that's perfectly clear this is it it
[1:01:03] even States after their manner to do
[1:01:07] this helps you understand this is a
[1:01:10] demonic trait amen it's a demonic spirit
[1:01:15] that has people do that I've gone to
[1:01:17] grocery stores before and seen um nice
[1:01:21] nice uh one particular I can remember
[1:01:24] nice girl uh she's very polite and she
[1:01:28] reached out to grab my groceries and she
[1:01:30] was sliced all up her arms and I you
[1:01:33] know you know they're they're scarred
[1:01:35] they're they're healed but you see the
[1:01:37] scars lining all up straight up you know
[1:01:40] what they did you know what happened to
[1:01:43] that person that demonic Spirit got a
[1:01:44] hold of them that that demonic Spirit
[1:01:47] got a hold of their mind and persuaded
[1:01:50] them to do something that was wrong that
[1:01:52] was contrary to normal thinking much
[1:01:56] less the scripture normal thinking
[1:01:58] doesn't say hey let me take a knife and
[1:02:01] stab myself with it that's not normal
[1:02:04] thinking a demonic Spirit has to get a
[1:02:07] hold of a person and control their minds
[1:02:09] to the place that they are that that
[1:02:11] they are convinced to do this to to be
[1:02:14] able to do this I remember another
[1:02:16] sister one time um she had done the same
[1:02:19] thing on her body arms I forgot where
[1:02:21] all it was and she had all these
[1:02:23] horrible scars she came to the lord gave
[1:02:25] her heart to the Lord was born again and
[1:02:27] she came up to a prayer line I remember
[1:02:30] forgot where this was or how it unfolded
[1:02:32] but I just remember the story uh she
[1:02:35] came up for prayer one time and she
[1:02:37] asked that that they would pray that the
[1:02:39] Lord would remove all the evidence and
[1:02:42] scars that you remember was this okay
[1:02:44] Monica remembers in must have been North
[1:02:47] Carolina then or somebody we knew and
[1:02:50] she had these cars she asked the Lord to
[1:02:52] take these off of her cuz they were just
[1:02:54] a constant reminder
[1:02:56] of that old life and the Lord actually
[1:02:58] took all those words off her body amen
[1:03:01] that's the God we serve erased
[1:03:04] everything about all that that the devil
[1:03:06] had done to her praise God God is able
[1:03:09] to do it to the body he's able to do it
[1:03:11] to the mind he's able to do it to the
[1:03:13] spirit he obviously we know he does it
[1:03:15] to the soul when we come receive a new
[1:03:17] birth yes praise the Lord delivered her
[1:03:21] and brought her and restored her back to
[1:03:23] her normal place
[1:03:26] but we see this is a demonic trait a
[1:03:30] demonic spirit that causes people to do
[1:03:33] those things amen even sometimes maybe
[1:03:36] even being uh um
[1:03:39] uh uh they have a mind to do something
[1:03:43] good or have a mind to do something
[1:03:45] right like I said have Plastering a big
[1:03:47] tattoo of crosses or Jesus on there
[1:03:49] something thinking that want to do
[1:03:51] something good but this conscious like
[1:03:55] it's like
[1:03:56] it's like Saul uh trying to save the the
[1:04:02] violent Refuge animals that God said
[1:04:05] destroy right oh they're violent refus
[1:04:08] according to God but you know I'm going
[1:04:10] to save some of them to sacrifice to God
[1:04:12] no why would you do that God didn't ask
[1:04:14] you to sacrifice your body to slap a big
[1:04:18] picture of himself on you or crosses on
[1:04:21] you or scripture he didn't ask you to do
[1:04:23] that amen he didn't ask asked Saul to
[1:04:26] save these animals to sacrifice he said
[1:04:29] kill them they're vile and refused get
[1:04:32] rid of
[1:04:33] them his mind may have had a a good
[1:04:37] thought of something to do for God but
[1:04:39] that's the the thing that we do for God
[1:04:41] is to obey his word yes amen and his
[1:04:44] word says not to do this right they
[1:04:48] after the manner of themselves cut
[1:04:50] themselves this evil spirit that's on
[1:04:53] this
[1:04:54] man look again
[1:04:57] he cried with a loud
[1:04:59] voice and say where do we end up here
[1:05:01] there's u a day and night let's go back
[1:05:04] to the fifth verse and always night and
[1:05:06] day he was in the mountains in the tombs
[1:05:08] crying and cutting himself with stones
[1:05:11] so we know that that's an evil spirit
[1:05:13] you can identify that right away right
[1:05:16] amen but when he saw Jesus a far off he
[1:05:19] ran and worshiped him or he ran and fell
[1:05:22] down before him but look what he did now
[1:05:25] I don't know how that got translated to
[1:05:26] worship but he ran and fell down before
[1:05:29] Jesus and he cried with a loud voice and
[1:05:31] said what have I to do with thee Jesus
[1:05:35] thou son of the most high God I adure
[1:05:39] you I adure Thee by God this evil spirit
[1:05:44] is speaking unto God himself saying I
[1:05:47] adure You by God that thou torment me
[1:05:52] not now what what is it that this that
[1:05:55] this evil spirit saw that caused him to
[1:05:59] first run up to Jesus and second to beg
[1:06:03] Jesus and adure him by the Living God
[1:06:07] that he not torment him now what did he
[1:06:09] see in Jesus that would have caused him
[1:06:11] to do
[1:06:13] that amen it wasn't the way he was
[1:06:15] dressed right wasn't because he had his
[1:06:18] beard shaped just right it wasn't cause
[1:06:20] he had just gotten a nice haircut wasn't
[1:06:22] caus the clothes he was wearing wasn't
[1:06:24] cause the way he was walking wasn't the
[1:06:26] company he kept it was something that
[1:06:29] Spirit recognized in Jesus and what was
[1:06:31] it it was the spirit the spirit
[1:06:33] recognized the spirit the Demonic spirit
[1:06:35] in this man recognized the holy spirit
[1:06:38] in Jesus Christ and he ran up to him and
[1:06:41] said now now Matthew says why have you
[1:06:43] come to torment us before the time but
[1:06:45] here it says iure thee by God that thou
[1:06:48] torment me
[1:06:50] not for he had said unto him come out of
[1:06:53] the man thou unclean spirit
[1:06:56] but then Jesus asked him and he he asked
[1:06:58] him what is thy name and he answered
[1:07:01] saying my name is Legion for we are many
[1:07:05] amen now you're talking more than one we
[1:07:07] are
[1:07:09] many
[1:07:11] uh possessed of this demonic spirits
[1:07:16] that was on this
[1:07:18] person and he Bes saw him much that he
[1:07:21] would not send them away out of the
[1:07:24] country and can you
[1:07:26] Imagine The Devils that so many people
[1:07:29] fear the demonic spirits that so many
[1:07:32] people are afraid of we asking begging
[1:07:37] Jesus please don't torment us please
[1:07:42] don't send us out of the country now
[1:07:44] who's got control a lot of times I'm
[1:07:46] sorry Saints but sometimes a lot of
[1:07:48] times we act like he's in charge right
[1:07:52] the devil's not in charge I'm in charge
[1:07:55] amen you're in charge God is in charge
[1:07:58] of this situation and the God and me is
[1:08:00] in charge of this not the devil the
[1:08:03] devil's not in charge of whether you are
[1:08:05] well or sick the devil is not in charge
[1:08:07] of whether you're happy or sad the
[1:08:09] devil's not in charge of whether you
[1:08:10] have peace Joy or happiness the devil's
[1:08:13] not in charge of any of that he is a
[1:08:15] loser and he's lost every battle he's
[1:08:17] ever fought against God and he's still a
[1:08:19] loser because he comes to us oh please
[1:08:23] please those Devils beg
[1:08:26] please don't cast us out please don't
[1:08:29] torment us please don't send us out of
[1:08:31] the country because Jesus had already
[1:08:34] said come out of him so he knew he had
[1:08:36] no choice he was going to have to come
[1:08:39] out but look Saints the devil's not in
[1:08:42] charge you
[1:08:44] are amen stand up and claim take what
[1:08:47] belongs to you it's yours don't belong
[1:08:49] to him amen I don't care if it's on you
[1:08:53] I don't care if it's on your family your
[1:08:54] children your home I don't care where it
[1:08:56] is he has no Authority right Satan has
[1:09:00] where the where the power of God is
[1:09:02] Satan has no Authority right he has
[1:09:06] every Authority in the world to set on
[1:09:08] the in the white house he has every
[1:09:10] Authority in the world to be behind some
[1:09:11] pulpits across the country across the
[1:09:13] world but he has no Authority where the
[1:09:15] spirit of God Is Right none absolutely
[1:09:19] and that's you praise the Lord that is
[1:09:21] you has no authority over you remember
[1:09:24] that Satan has no authority over you he
[1:09:27] besought him much 10th verse again that
[1:09:30] he would not send them away out of the
[1:09:32] country Satan begging to Jesus
[1:09:37] amen now there was there nigh unto the
[1:09:40] mountains a great herd of WI a swine
[1:09:44] feeding and all the Devils besought him
[1:09:46] saying send us into the
[1:09:49] swine that we may enter into them
[1:09:52] because though the as we preached
[1:09:55] several times it's been a long time but
[1:09:57] those Spirits don't die right Spirits
[1:10:00] don't die amen they're always here amen
[1:10:03] when a person dies their Spirit doesn't
[1:10:05] die amen their Spirit goes somewhere
[1:10:08] amen when these evil spirits these evil
[1:10:11] spirits aren't just cast out of
[1:10:14] existence right they're just cast from
[1:10:16] one to the other remember when brother
[1:10:18] randam um uh had the prayer line and he
[1:10:22] then he was Discerning people in the
[1:10:24] congregation and there's a couple down
[1:10:26] here that uh that was uh making out and
[1:10:30] and very disrespectful and God call and
[1:10:33] brother ramam called him out said you

[1:10:37] respectful and so and they laughed
[1:10:39] scoffed at him or whatever he said okay
[1:10:41] I am not responsible for what happens
[1:10:43] here tonight right amen and and those
[1:10:47] evil spirits uh come out and he uh
[1:10:51] brother random would call that evil
[1:10:52] spirit out that one time that evil
[1:10:54] spirit came out and got them and they
[1:10:55] fell on the floor with Le uh uh
[1:10:57] epilepsy both of them cuz the spirit
[1:11:00] didn't die right the spirit didn't just
[1:11:03] go to hell that Spirit went into those
[1:11:06] people and they fell on the floor with
[1:11:07] epilepsy that Spirit just came out
[1:11:10] trying to find another place to go right
[1:11:12] amen that's all it did right and when it
[1:11:14] found a place it could enter it went
[1:11:16] into them and they fell out with with
[1:11:19] epilepsy I remember another story he's
[1:11:21] Tau brother R was preaching uh the the
[1:11:25] these two people across the the
[1:11:26] congregation here had had the same type
[1:11:29] devil on them and he said uh and and and
[1:11:32] and the Lord's taken over the the
[1:11:34] service and and and he said this uh
[1:11:37] brother Ram's calling out this one call
[1:11:39] out this one those he said those demons
[1:11:41] are crying out to each other for
[1:11:44] Mercy because they're getting ready to
[1:11:46] have to be to leave they they they could
[1:11:49] not stay in the places they were right
[1:11:52] and there those Spirits were crying out
[1:11:54] to each other like Spirits crying out to
[1:11:57] each other amen where are we going to go
[1:12:00] because those Spirits are going to go
[1:12:01] somewhere yeah these Spirits are looking
[1:12:04] and saw this herd of swine feeding on
[1:12:07] this mountains over here and forth with
[1:12:10] 13 first forth with Jesus gave them Le
[1:12:15] now in Matthew the only thing Jesus ever
[1:12:19] says according to the account that
[1:12:21] Matthew gave is one two-letter word go
[1:12:25] right that's all he said he didn't talk
[1:12:28] to him according to Matthew now there
[1:12:29] was no conversation there was no who you
[1:12:31] are there was none of this uh I cast you
[1:12:34] out or any he just said if you're going
[1:12:36] to cast us out cast us now hurt us why
[1:12:39] Jesus just said
[1:12:40] go
[1:12:42] amen praise the Lord that's the
[1:12:45] authority amen you know it's been often
[1:12:48] said boo devil Boo get smaller Boo get
[1:12:52] smaller amen be something as simple go
[1:12:56] yeah that's it
[1:12:59] amen that Jesus didn't cast them into
[1:13:02] the swine they cast themselves there if
[1:13:05] you're going to cast us out cast us into
[1:13:07] the swine okay go there they went amen
[1:13:11] and forth with Jesus gave them leave and
[1:13:14] the unclean spirits went out praise the
[1:13:18] Lord and entered into the swine and the
[1:13:21] herd ran violently down a steep Place
[1:13:24] into the sea they were about 2,000 and
[1:13:27] were choked in the sea and they that
[1:13:30] fled uh they that fed the swine fled and
[1:13:33] told it in the city and in the country
[1:13:35] and they went out to see what it was
[1:13:37] that was done and they came to and and
[1:13:39] they come to Jesus and see him that was
[1:13:42] possessed with the Devil the one that
[1:13:44] was possessed with the devil and had the
[1:13:48] legion sitting and clothed and in his
[1:13:52] right
[1:13:53] mind praise the Lord amen this was a man
[1:13:58] that broke chains feathers dozen men
[1:14:01] couldn't handle him and he's sitting
[1:14:04] there sitting clothed and in his right
[1:14:08] mind amen was that scripture and brother
[1:14:11] Dennis quotes that sometimes in his
[1:14:13] prayer God has not given us a spirit of
[1:14:15] fear right amen amen but of love and of
[1:14:19] a sound mind praise the Lord sitting
[1:14:23] cloth in his right mind and they were
[1:14:25] afraid they were afraid they were a now
[1:14:28] it doesn't they didn't go around him
[1:14:30] before so I'm guessing they were afraid
[1:14:32] before when he was when he was possessed
[1:14:34] of that demon but now he's a normal
[1:14:38] functioning human in his right mind and
[1:14:40] now they're
[1:14:43] afraid now they he finally got delivered
[1:14:46] he's finally healed he's finally a
[1:14:48] normal operating human in his right mind
[1:14:50] and now they're
[1:14:53] afraid oh human humans we're just we're
[1:14:58] something else aren't we yes amen we're
[1:15:00] just humans are so complex now they're
[1:15:04] afraid and they that saw it told them
[1:15:07] how it befell to him that was possessed
[1:15:09] with the devil and also concerning the
[1:15:12] swine and they began to pray him to
[1:15:15] depart out of their Coast he delivered
[1:15:17] them of the evil spirits Legion that was
[1:15:20] on this man that none of them could
[1:15:22] handle they were scared of him he dwelt
[1:15:24] around the and he's finally delivered
[1:15:26] and now they're scared and want to get
[1:15:27] rid of the guy that healed
[1:15:30] him
[1:15:32] uh humans
[1:15:34] are oh that that's just that's
[1:15:38] amazing uh I I just it's hard to Fathom
[1:15:42] that you would think that in a situation
[1:15:45] like that where the Deliverance took
[1:15:48] place the healing in this man and the
[1:15:50] evidence is right there that they would
[1:15:51] want him to stay around
[1:15:55] they wanted him to leave to depart out
[1:15:57] of their coast and when he was com into
[1:15:59] the ship he that had been possessed with
[1:16:01] the devil prayed him that he might be
[1:16:04] with him how be it Jesus suffer him not
[1:16:07] but saith unto him go home to thy
[1:16:09] friends and tell them how great things
[1:16:12] the Lord has done for thee and had and
[1:16:15] ha had compassion on thee and he
[1:16:19] departed and began to publish and
[1:16:21] decopolis how great things Jesus had
[1:16:24] done for him and all men did Marvel
[1:16:27] praise the Lord the casting out of that
[1:16:30] evil spirit now those evil
[1:16:33] spirits this Legion had control over
[1:16:37] him this Legion had control over this
[1:16:40] man no way that a normal human I don't
[1:16:44] care how strong he is can break chains
[1:16:47] like that and feds and defeat a dozen
[1:16:51] men to where they could not handle him
[1:16:54] no normal man man can do that it has to
[1:16:57] be a possession of a demonic spirit that
[1:17:00] had full control over him but look what
[1:17:03] brother brandom said I want you to see
[1:17:06] this a lot of people a lot of people
[1:17:08] will write that off uh and think how
[1:17:12] could that person be a a seed how could
[1:17:16] that person be a child of God and be so
[1:17:19] possessed let me read demonic uh and
[1:17:23] demonology Physical Realm
[1:17:27] 1953 now for a few minutes we're going
[1:17:29] to talk about demonology you you hear so
[1:17:31] much about demons he goes on talking
[1:17:34] about tomorrow in the service and when
[1:17:36] he's going to try to finish now the
[1:17:37] first thing what a demon is you hear so
[1:17:42] many people talk about a demon well now
[1:17:44] a demon a devil all comes from one word
[1:17:48] and in the English it is called
[1:17:51] Tormentor if a person's being tormented
[1:17:54] it's a devil if it's spiritual if it's
[1:17:58] physical if it's Financial if it's
[1:18:00] mental it's a devil Tormentor is a
[1:18:04] devil a fellow that torments is a devil
[1:18:08] an evil one now the Bible today most
[1:18:12] people think old black book that Grandpa
[1:18:14] Grandma read something like that there's
[1:18:17] not much to it for the old folks go and
[1:18:19] so forth but that is wrong it is for
[1:18:22] everybody demons are t tormentors that
[1:18:25] torment us now look now there is demons
[1:18:29] that come into the soul of man obviously
[1:18:32] that is before the man the person is
[1:18:35] converted before a new birth right amen
[1:18:38] because after that part after that point
[1:18:41] Satan cannot enter into that Soul when
[1:18:45] God seals himself in as we've said many
[1:18:48] times he seals the devil out yes Amen
[1:18:51] brother Brandon makes that very clear to
[1:18:53] understand the devil is sealed out of
[1:18:55] the soul but before that time the devil
[1:18:58] can come into the soul of man he's
[1:19:01] talking about phraseology said it would
[1:19:03] be I'd say this though that uh the demon
[1:19:08] that comes into the soul is something
[1:19:10] that torments the
[1:19:12] soul even being born with a wrong with
[1:19:15] with the with a fallen nature amen doing
[1:19:19] things that are wrong but look that is
[1:19:22] something that torments the soul many
[1:19:25] times you can see a person maybe of
[1:19:27] insanity a person that's insane a person
[1:19:31] that's been taken over their mental
[1:19:33] capacities by an evil spirit just like
[1:19:35] Legion
[1:19:36] here now they may uh now they may be yet
[1:19:40] a converted person filled with the Holy
[1:19:44] Ghost and yet be totally
[1:19:48] insane they could be totally insane but
[1:19:51] still be a converted person totally
[1:19:54] insane and still be born again totally
[1:19:57] insane and still have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:00] still be a child of God and be totally
[1:20:03] insane M see a lot of people don't think
[1:20:06] in those in those uh in that way how
[1:20:10] could a person totally insane totally
[1:20:12] captivated take it over by these evil
[1:20:15] spirits but yet be a child of God but
[1:20:17] brother R said M makes it very clear a
[1:20:20] person a converted person filled with
[1:20:22] the Holy Ghost can be uh can still be
[1:20:25] totally
[1:20:26] insanee amen that brings to light to
[1:20:30] understand that God
[1:20:32] God's that that that
[1:20:36] mind that part of the place that Satan
[1:20:40] chose has nothing to do with the
[1:20:43] soul amen that even though they're
[1:20:47] possessed here that has nothing to do
[1:20:50] with the
[1:20:50] soul the soul if if if they've been born
[1:20:53] again filled the Holy Ghost that that
[1:20:55] soul is is is converted is fil it's it's
[1:20:59] uh filled with the Holy
[1:21:01] Spirit the devil sealed Out the Devil
[1:21:04] can still get to the mind he can still
[1:21:07] get to the body he can still get to the
[1:21:09] spirit but he cannot get to the soul so
[1:21:11] one has nothing to do with the other
[1:21:13] right in that in that regard yes even a
[1:21:17] person that Satan has been able to
[1:21:19] overtake in their mind through some
[1:21:21] weakness of theirs somehow I'm going to
[1:21:24] read this story in just a minute that it
[1:21:26] shows how weakness in a person can bring
[1:21:29] about that spirit in their mind and yet
[1:21:32] still be born again because the mind
[1:21:34] doesn't have anything to do with the
[1:21:35] soul they could be touched in the mind
[1:21:38] the Soul's still born of
[1:21:41] God Amen one doesn't have anything to do
[1:21:44] with the other you look out here
[1:21:45] sometimes you see people that may look
[1:21:47] totally insane they they may be born
[1:21:49] again we don't know right we don't know
[1:21:51] their history I don't know where they
[1:21:52] come from we don't know who they are
[1:21:54] amen they could absolutely be a child of
[1:21:55] God we don't know that amen that's why
[1:21:58] we're to that's why we're try to we are
[1:22:00] to try to do to be directed by God in
[1:22:04] what we do to anybody wherever we go
[1:22:07] whoever we
[1:22:08] see if God leads us to do something to
[1:22:11] help that person or whatever might be
[1:22:12] then we should do that amen I wouldn't
[1:22:15] do it unless the Lord directed me to do
[1:22:17] it necessarily but if the Lord directed
[1:22:20] absolutely 100% do it you never know
[1:22:23] maybe entertain the angels unawares you
[1:22:25] don't know but that person out here on
[1:22:27] the street and say look and say could
[1:22:30] absolutely be a child of God born again
[1:22:31] we don't know amen because one doesn't
[1:22:34] have anything to do with the other now
[1:22:36] look I'm going to read this very
[1:22:39] familiar story see how even just a
[1:22:43] simple weakness or something that had
[1:22:45] come on a person allowed the spirit
[1:22:48] entry a way to be able to get in to
[1:22:50] torment this person diseases and
[1:22:53] afflictions January
[1:22:55] 1950 now this I I got this Mr Brown to
[1:22:59] be a
[1:23:01] minister if I'm wrong then I'm I'm wrong
[1:23:04] but uh brother Brandon refers to this
[1:23:06] man as Mr Brown but Mr Brown that's a
[1:23:09] little lengthy story so and I won't be
[1:23:12] much longer when I get done with this
[1:23:14] because remember remember brother
[1:23:16] brandham predicted brother brandham said
[1:23:19] uh he said I predict that this world in
[1:23:22] so many years I forgot what it was will
[1:23:24] be totally insane this world will go
[1:23:26] totally

[1:27:11] feel any vibrations he said brother
[1:27:13] brandom don't you go out
[1:27:16] there said she will kill you I said oh I
[1:27:20] think not just like that I walked out
[1:27:22] she was lying there looking at me kind
[1:27:24] of batting her eyes
[1:27:26] staring and I said good evening she
[1:27:29] never said a word took a hold of her
[1:27:31] hand I said good
[1:27:33] evening said she don't even know her own
[1:27:36] name brother brandom she hasn't known
[1:27:38] for two years I took a hold of her hand
[1:27:41] and just by God's blessings I happened
[1:27:43] to be on my guard she just gave me a
[1:27:46] jerk with both hands like that and she
[1:27:48] would have probably broke the bones of
[1:27:50] my body I threw my foot out and caught
[1:27:53] her right across the bosom uh she just
[1:27:56] pulled me way down I jerked away from
[1:27:58] her and then when I run from her listen
[1:28:01] to this now when I run from her to get
[1:28:05] on the steps I seen a sight that I'd
[1:28:08] never seen before that woman with her
[1:28:12] two limbs sticking up in the air like
[1:28:15] this come chasing me on her back like a
[1:28:20] snake you could hear her crawling like
[1:28:23] that on the floor crawling across the
[1:28:26] floor on her back with her legs sticking
[1:28:29] straight up in the air chasing brother
[1:28:30] randam as he went to the
[1:28:32] stairs on her back like a
[1:28:36] snake on the floor he said now that's
[1:28:40] the devil
[1:28:43] amen sounds a lot like Legion maybe not
[1:28:46] quite the detail a lot of the same type
[1:28:49] story this is a man this is a woman who
[1:28:51] knows what would cause it with that man
[1:28:54] we don't know brother bam identifies
[1:28:56] this with this woman we don't know what
[1:28:58] might to happen to that man just like we
[1:29:00] don't know so many times in life amen I
[1:29:03] had an uncle he was he was never right
[1:29:06] in his head and I asked my dad he he had
[1:29:08] a hard time with life he was he was
[1:29:10] subtle he wasn't a very we just had a
[1:29:13] rough time and I asked my dad one time
[1:29:16] he said was Uncle Clyde he said uh that
[1:29:19] my uncle had been in some of the worst
[1:29:21] battles of World War II you would and
[1:29:25] Battle of the Bulge he had been in two
[1:29:26] or three of like the
[1:29:28] worst battles that they that us fought
[1:29:32] and that I forgot all he on a Battle of
[1:29:35] the Bulge eima ones that were very very
[1:29:38] I mean men American soldiers died by the
[1:29:42] thousands in those bullets you hear
[1:29:46] screaming by your ear and it my my uncle
[1:29:49] was never the same after that and
[1:29:52] honestly friend how can you blame him
[1:29:54] yes amen how can you blame him but look
[1:29:57] this devil now this woman got in hear
[1:29:59] that premature changes said now that's
[1:30:01] the devil you can say of it what you
[1:30:04] desire but that woman was bound by the
[1:30:06] devil she came to me on her back like a
[1:30:09] serpent and she got up there and she hit
[1:30:12] against the side of the floor like that
[1:30:14] with the stairs banged up against the
[1:30:17] stairs she turned around put her big
[1:30:19] Strong Limbs up against and kicked it
[1:30:21] like that he said there was a bent
[1:30:24] sitting there and she hit it with she
[1:30:26] hit the bench with her head and the
[1:30:28] blood flew out of the side of her head
[1:30:30] and she knocked a a a big piece Off the
[1:30:34] Bench she grabbed it with her hand and
[1:30:37] threw it at her husband and struck the
[1:30:40] wall so hard that the plastering fell
[1:30:43] from the walls where she had hid
[1:30:45] it Maniac 20 times her strength probably
[1:30:49] there was that great she was a
[1:30:51] good-sized woman anyhow and she started
[1:30:54] making a real funny noise
[1:30:56] like like that I looked at her I thought
[1:31:00] why my I've never seen nothing God have
[1:31:03] mercy on a poor human being bound like
[1:31:07] that and a man Comm and the man commits
[1:31:10] to commenced to cry he walked over put
[1:31:13] his hand his arms around me said brother
[1:31:15] bam now you say there's no vibration
[1:31:18] said I don't know what I'm going to do
[1:31:20] he just broke down crying he said she's
[1:31:22] got five little children at home she's
[1:31:24] been a good woman she's uh hard over
[1:31:28] these old clots to help me raise cotton
[1:31:30] crops when she had taken six said I've
[1:31:33] done everything I could to help her I
[1:31:34] sold the farm in order to get here
[1:31:37] brother R I had one thing left a pair of
[1:31:39] mules I sold them just to get to the
[1:31:42] brother
[1:31:43] here 200 miles to bring her down and now
[1:31:47] she's kicking the glass out of the car
[1:31:49] that's why her limbs were bleeding she
[1:31:51] had been off her she had been she hasn't
[1:31:54] been off her back in two years and don't
[1:31:58] even she doesn't even know her own name
[1:32:00] I said well brother sure God can heal
[1:32:02] her yes and about that time she turned
[1:32:05] around she said William brandom you have
[1:32:07] nothing to do with
[1:32:10] me I brought her
[1:32:13] here he said why I said that's not her
[1:32:17] that's the devil speaking out of her
[1:32:18] that's right they recognize they know he
[1:32:21] said why brother brandom that's the
[1:32:23] first word she spoken in two years but
[1:32:25] that's not her I said the devil is just
[1:32:28] using her lips like that one case of
[1:32:31] Legion that we had just read she came
[1:32:33] crawling over that way said you ain't
[1:32:36] got nothing to do with me crawling like
[1:32:38] that brother he said do you believe that
[1:32:41] story The Angel he's talking to that man
[1:32:44] of the angs of the Lord coming a lot
[1:32:46] more to the story bottom line
[1:32:50] is brother R prays for the woman cast
[1:32:54] that Spirit out and he said brother
[1:32:57] brother vam what do I do with her now he
[1:32:59] said take her back to the end s of do
[1:33:01] you believe with all my heart he asked
[1:33:03] him two or three times do you believe
[1:33:05] man says with all my heart he said now
[1:33:07] what do I do he said take her back to
[1:33:08] the insane asylum and let her there and
[1:33:11] believe don't doubt but believe it has
[1:33:15] been it has been happening remember
[1:33:17] doesn't always God doesn't always work
[1:33:19] right that second we always expect a
[1:33:21] miracle we always expect instance aneous
[1:33:24] it's said it's done it's finished
[1:33:28] no healing is a process of time and and
[1:33:32] sometimes different uh things play into
[1:33:35] that and he ask the man do you believe
[1:33:39] yes take her back to insan Sol keep
[1:33:42] believeing he said he was over in
[1:33:43] Jonesboro Arkansas a while later he said
[1:33:46] and while he was there had Services some
[1:33:49] lady kept looking at him and and and and
[1:33:52] calling him out waving to him and all he
[1:33:55] talked to her he said she said you don't
[1:33:57] remember me do you or something like
[1:33:59] that he says uh who are you that was
[1:34:02] that woman she had her five children and
[1:34:04] her husband sitting right there in her
[1:34:06] right mind sitting there worshiping the
[1:34:09] Lord amen amen you look at the woman in
[1:34:12] the basement think there is no way that
[1:34:13] could be a that could be a Christian

[1:34:17] woman but it absolutely was yes amen
[1:34:20] praise him when she came when that
[1:34:22] Spirit was cast out and she came came in
[1:34:23] her right mind there she was back with
[1:34:25] her family again in church being the
[1:34:28] person she was Holy Ghost filled
[1:34:30] Christian amen because it's of the mind
[1:34:33] that thing of the mind has nothing to do

[1:34:40] uh have that control taken over them
[1:34:43] their mind in a in in a weakened
[1:34:45] condition and bring a person to be like
[1:34:49] that can bring a person to be like
[1:34:52] Legion can bring a person person to be
[1:34:54] like this woman amen but again the point
[1:34:59] they can be totally insane and still be
[1:35:01] a child of God still be born again and
[1:35:04] be totally insane because the mind that
[1:35:08] is corruptible amen has nothing to do

[1:35:27] woman's soul but he could get a hold of
[1:35:28] her mind amen he could get a hold of her
[1:35:31] mind there's no way amen that the devil
[1:35:36] finds that inroad that he can get to
[1:35:39] somehow some way to bring
