abortions is going to be uh taken off again um he stands for the mlim nation they're going to be served you know better than our own uh service people that you know dedicated their lies you know for the service of this country uh so so much that it's it's almost mindboggling and I believe it's a test for us as Believers there's going to be some dark times but we must press on more harder more diligent than ever before and um true I I I I I'm almost baffled I'm I I I can't believe that uh he's going to raise taxes he's going to do do everything that's contrary to what us Believers you know

standard and your word says Lord if God be with us who can be against us and Lord let us not waver when the seas are roaring and the waves are higher and rougher than ever we know that you control the Seas you control everything that's around us and Lord there are needs that have been expressed today you know each and everyone father we call you onto scene we plead the blood of Jesus Christ over

commit it to you and ask your blessings once again now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen The Book of Ruth now uh chapter 3 we'll just begin reading with verse at verse one then then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz of our Kindred who uh with whose maidens thou was behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy rment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he have uh shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie Thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do amen and she went down unto the floor and did according to all her mother-in-law B her when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou she uh she answered I am Ruth thy handmade spread thou for thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed great kind uh has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou uh follow us not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman you can be seated if you'd like stop there story of Ruth is a great story um we say story again you know my thoughts about saying story but uh the the truth of Ruth and the life that she lived uh is is quite a story it's only uh four chapters but it's uh it's outstanding there's many things type shadows and many different messages that no doubt have been preached could be preached probably will be preached but I just want to take a simple thought today of rest amen just a just a simple four-letter word of rest uh we know that brother randam preached about um the kinsman redeemer and that is a huge part of what Ruth is about of course and and identifying Jesus Christ as the kinsman redeemer to come and to redeem all man uh we know though that Ruth also was uh the story of Ruth was also a uh a a a foretelling of the Gentile church because Ruth was a gentile uh Ruth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi who was a limex wife and they had two sons and there was a famine in in in the land so they uh IMC got Naomi and his sons and they went to the land of Moab uh now the land of Moab of course we know was not a good place it was a it was a wicked place it was evil place it was a place that was born out of uh of uh of adultery and um um if I should say that well Moab came about because uh lot had relation with his daughter and lot was and and Moab was born as a relationship of an incestuous relation relationship between lot and his daughter uh that's how Moab came about and of course Moab was also used by the prophet balum to deceive the children of Israel into marrying into Moab so that all of them would intermingle together the righteous with the unrighteous saying that they were all one and all a part of one big great family when in truth they were right because lot was a part of Abraham Abraham was his uncle so they were family but they weren't family in the sense that they were family spiritually they only had a blood trail that they could follow and uh and so balam tricked Israel into marrying into Moab and when they did that they committed fornication against God when they committed fornication against God God put them away but the rest part that I want to get to is the Gentile part that Ruth is now when when uh Naomi and imim Sons uh when they went to Moab they found two women and married them uh one was orpa uh I like to call her Oprah that's probably not a good thing to do but you just switch two letters and it becomes Oprah but anyway her name is orpa o r p ah I believe is how it's spelled but anyway uh uh that was one daughter-in-law and Ruth was the other daughter-in-law well Ruth was uh uh well when when uh orpa and Ruth's Sons passed away when uh Naomi and imc's sons died uh they were left uh together with just Naomi because Naomi's immc died and their two sons died so it just left the three women so when the three women were there uh they had a choice to make the famine that Naomi had heard was was gone in Bethlehem and so Naomi decided to go back home to her people where she should have stayed to begin with you see uh when the children of Israel in their Homeland that's when they're blessed and when you leave the Homeland that's when you're not blessed blessed right so when they left the Homeland they weren't blessed andc died and their two sons died but Naomi saw that the famine was gone uh and so she took uh her two daughter-in-laws was one and was going to go but as but before she went because they were women of Moab she gave them leave to go back to their uh to or to stay actually in their Homeland and to uh marry other men but uh they both cling to na meat but Ora finally uh got to the places she's like okay I'm sorry she was crying and but she went ahead and left and went back into the world so orpa orpa Oprah left God and went back into the world so when orpa went into the world Ruth had a decision to make uh orpa made her decision and she decided to go back in the world Ruth had her decision to make and she decided to cling to Naomi and she told naom me where you Lodge I'll Lodge where you live I'll live where you are I'll your people be my people where you die die and so Ruth made that decision as a gentile moabit as a gentile made that decision that she was going to stay with Naomi and go into the Homeland where Ruth would be blessed right and so that decision part and of course you know as brother brandham did and if you have a Scofield bible he did the same thing uh brother Bram probably maybe got it from Scofield's notes here but you can see the first part of uh of the Book of Ruth is Ruth's decision Ruth deciding because Ruth had a decision to make and just like the Gentile Church the Gentile bride had a decision to make amen every one of us even if you're a Christian if you feel like you're a born again Christian today you had a decision to make cuz we're free moral agents that decision that Ruth had to make was either if she was going to go back into the world again back to the moabites or if she was going to claing to Naomi if she was going to cling to that uh that Jewish church that she was going to cling to and be blessed by that because that's where they were blessed so that was her decision after that then they go back together and they're in Bethlehem and Ruth begins to serve second chapter you can read Ruth begins to serve she goes out of the field and she starts to glean all of the uh the the stubble and and all of the field to bring back for her and Naomi to eat and and to be blessed by and she met Boaz and uh and Boaz told his men to throw more stuff out for Naomi or for uh Ruth to gather together and and uh and they became very close and so when Ruth did this she served and she served moaz and she served Naomi and she was in she was in the life of service to Naomi and to those that were around her because Naomi's people became her people amen so that was Ruth serving well then we get to the third part where Ruth enters into a rest first she's decided then she's serving and then she's at rest and brother random we know he types it into a part of uh into a place of the new birth the justification the sanctification and the being born again Having the Holy Ghost the justification is the decision that you make the decision you make for Jesus Christ and accepting Christ as your savior puts you into a place of justification because the blood of Jesus Christ by your testimony annihilates the sin that was in your life it justifies you as though you had never done it in the first place so that was the the the decision that you make that brought you to that place that's not the end result however because there's a time that we serve that serving is that we do for the Lord and we serve the Lord and we work there's a work to be done when you decide to accept Jesus Christ there's a work to be done there's something that you do there you you uh accept Jesus you you you need to go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost and there's there's work to be done there's a service to be done but once that Holy Spirit comes in your life and you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've receive the indwelling presence of Jesus in your soul you become to a place of rest amen where you're resting in Christ you're resting in his word you're resting in his promises and that rest has put us not just in the presence of God but at ease in the presence of God at rest in the presence of God Amen now I want you to know something before the election before all the stuff happened this week before any the Lord put this on my heart long before any the stuff that's been going on this week but then all this had began to unfold this week made my heart glad because I begin to see why the Lord put this on my heart however long ago it was a month or more so or go so uh to understand this just didn't come about because of brother Dennis's testimony or because of all the turmoil and stuff that's going on in their country today the lord gave this to me a while back but I believe it was purposely designed for today amen what greater time do we need to have or to feel that we're at in resting today in the promises of God there's ever a time that we need to rest it's right now rest in what rest in the fact that we know who we are we know Christ has paid the price we know we're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost we know that God has G us the promised land and in that Holy Ghost is where God promised his children to be blessed amen so if God has blessed us even in the worst times then how could anything change that amen praise God but Ruth now as she's laced notice this last verse Boaz tells Ruth now fear uh and now my daughter fear not amen what does that do what is it when when when somebody comes and says fear not what is it do to you when you read in the word Jesus said fear not when he says fear not little flock is my father's a good pleasure to give you the kingdom when the word tells us now when this happens it it should bring a rest to our hearts it should being rest to our soul of Peace amen remember the service a few weeks ago God is not give us the spirit of fear he's G us the spirit of Love of power and of a sound mind not the spirit of fear that rest is what God gives us that we can stand upon all the things that's going on and still know and have TR uh faith that God is there with us praise God Amen now Ruth uh uh Boaz was the near Kinsman to Naomi but we know of course there was a near Kinsman to Naomi and that that near Kinsman that boas was talking about uh we didn't read if you want to finish reading that just for sake of time there's that near Kinsman that had a greater claims on Naomi now I don't want to get into the Kinsman so much because I want to really focus on the rest part but uh just to highlight real quick that that kinsman redeemer had to be somebody that was Kinfolk right now I know that might be strange in Tucson Arizona but in Charlotte North Carolina or in the mountains North Carolina kin folk is a common word right it's used to denote people that are related to you people that are the closest to you I had family I had mom dad brothers sisters those were my closest family then I had uh cousins and uh uncles and aunts and and they were the next tier and then I had second cousins and things like that and and that's all in your family but see your brother is closer to you than your second cousin amen you understand that so that that brother is a nearer Kinsman to you he's a closer Kinfolk to you than what your second cousin might be or what or first cousin or whatever it might be they're closer to you the bloodline is pure amen do you understand so if the bloodline is pure that makes you a closer kin person to that individual well there was a closer kin person that could lay claims on a lic's property which was Nam Naomi and then Ruth then what Boaz was it was a pure bloodline it was a closer kinfo amen amen now there was a nearer Kinsman to uh uh uh uh to you there was a nearer Kinsman to me and to Christians than Jesus Christ was do you know who that nearer Kinsman is that near Kinsman was the devil because the devil had first claims on you right the devil had first rights to you because in the beginning when the fall took place when when all of creation fell all of humanity fell every human since then has been born in sin shap iniquity come the world speaking lies that devil had first claims on you yes amen and if a person doesn't become born again and filled with the spirit of God that devil will hold that claim amen but to a Christian the devil had no right to that claim and so he had to let loose cuz he could not perform the duty of the near Kinsman amen and you go read it the uh he had to take off his shoe and beat the table and all and of course goes in the cruffin anyway we won't talk about that but but that near kinum he could not perform the duty to redeem Naomi right and because he couldn't perform that duty to redeem Naomi he could not get Ruth amen he was in he was incapable of doing it he was unable to do it amen now we can go into a lot of detail but I don't I don't again we want to focus on the rest part but Boaz in his position though he was not the nearer Kinsman he was a Kinsman who was able to perform the act of Redemption on Naomi or IMC which was Naomi and Naomi and when he got Naomi got Ruth Ruth came with the claim that Boaz made on IMC and his family so Ruth was a part of that Redemption he not only redeemed now look when Jesus Christ came CU remember the devil could not lay claim on you he had no right and no ability to to exercise his claim on you so Jesus Christ came and he shed his blood and he took claim over the property that belonged rightfully to God in the beginning Hallelujah now not everybody rightfully belongs to God but I believe that I'm looking at a group of them that belong to God and if you belong to God from before the foundation of the world he's the one that had right to be able to come and claim you as his own amen and he not only claimed the Jew Naomi and Israel but he claimed the Gentile bride at the same time Lord so when he got her Naomi he got Ruth right when he got the Jew when he got his people he got the genti the cross was made it went from the older uh uh uh uh inheritance to the younger right it went from the tamame olive tree to the Wild Olive Tree it went from through the cross to the Bride of Jesus Christ the Gentile bride right now that Kinsman work has been done today amen we belong to him if we belong to him if we're born again filled with the Holy Ghost that is our rest amen amen we already talked about Israel's rest is their Homeland God gave them a place that they could go and he told them when you go there it'll be a place to rest you can go and you can set your swords down you've been fighting and there's been infighting and there's been uh all this all the time you can lay down your swords and you can just rest it's a land full with milk and honey you can just go to the land that I promis you don't matter who's there you hear me today don't matter who's there don't matter who's inhabiting that land right now it's yours amen I gave it to you Hallelujah so today friend it don't matter who's there it don't matter what part of it anybody's inhabiting that land belongs to God's people Amen period amen it's it belongs to the Jew it's theirs it's their place of rest and as long as they're in their Homeland they're blessed God blesses them that's why they had to all fly from all over the world to come back from everything that's going to be the 144,000 all back from all over the world cuz they have to be there to be blessed they have to be there to receive that uh uh uh that Messiah that's going to come and they're going to realize that they had crucified the very Messiah they claimed to serve right they say where you get those scars he said in the house of my friends they realize that they put on sackcloth and Ashes They Mourn but it doesn't matter the morning because they already know that is their Messiah he come and when he did the Redemptive work at Calvary he did it for them too but he come to get this Bri this Gentile bride and that's why we're about to leave this world Amen now this is so outstanding that that Boaz through Ruth became the what became the great grandfather of King David amen amen boas was the great grandfather of David King David Ruth the moabitas who received Redemptive value through boaz's Kinsman relationship became the the the grandmother the great grandmother excuse me great grandmother of King David amen praise the Lord that's wonderful friend amen amen working the work of God being at rest in the truth of God's word now it is very easy and if you watch much news at all or hear much news at all or see it in the newspaper much it's it's very easy to get yourself in a in a in a tussle it's very easy for your spirit to get all tore up with with events that's going on right it's it's really easy for that to happen and and there's nothing wrong with your civic duty there's nothing wrong with being concerned there's nothing wrong with praying there's nothing wrong with with putting action to your prayers there's nothing wrong with that but don't let your spirit become so tore up that you become uh uh less than what God wants you to be for him for you to be an instrument in his hand amen amen we can become so tore up that we become useless to the Lord people become so fixated on it yes that that it just it tears them apart and and they can't rest I I hear people sometimes say I won't rest night and day until so and so and such and such right oh friend don't let that don't let that Spirit Get On Us yes amen amen let's be at rest night and day regardless of what else takes place amen cuz we've already heard and we know God's in control of all anyway amen God's in control of it all then he's going to make it work together the way he wants to now I'm going to tell you something and I was going to type it to my next uh story but this nation is at a serious Crossroads it's in a Crossroads of a place that that that I want to say one way or the other is I is it's gonna it's going to be rough yes uh I if Biden stays president and Camala Harris the second president which become first president anyway um we already see what's going on in the world mhm right uh there's three or four countries right now completely shut down for a whole month and that's the purpose remember what I told you I did it off camera but remember what I told you five or six months ago of what this was the Lord told me in prayer of what was going on and the control and and and the uh uh trying to get people in in obedience see uh what they want to do now I I've heard people say and I agree that if if the government shuts down you say well brother not supposed to be talking politics I looked up what brother brandham talked about politics friend and I'm not going to go on about politics because this is rest but uh but he mentioned it hundreds of times right so especially when it come to Kennedy and Nixon he talked about it a lot he talked about how uh Kennedy stole the election 1960 the FBI proved it and they still did nothing about it brother Roger showed me a a a um wellow I can show you show me a picture of um of the globe now that's not not the globe's not the most reputable magazine your paper of course who are now everybody's biased and uh but on this paper I showed it to my wife if you want to see it that paper came out November's issue November this month's issue top headline Kennedy stole 1960 presidential election Nixon was the real winner right told us that in 1960 right after it happened yes he did he told us that 60 years ago that that had happened and they proved it by the ballot booze that it was stolen now that now this month they're now running this how coincidental is that I I mean I don't know but look at it now people people scream and yell uh Trump Trump trump I think Trump did a great job for this nation I I'll be honest he made this country more prosperous than probably any present maybe since Reagan uh Clinton did good with the balancing budget and stuff but that was a whole different scenario but it it was blessed and prosperous uh so I I'll tell you uh now one way or the other uh like Zach said one way or the other uh I'm gonna tell you friend try to hold on to what you got uh because there's a very good good chance that some really uh hard times are about to hit amen now and you say well you know Trump a man well he may be and if he is that's fine if that's because but it'll take a miracle to put him in office now and if it does then it'll just be a miracle I thought it was a miracle if Biden wins so whatever Supernatural event or cheating whatever going on uh God sets them up and God puts them down right that's what the Bible says so he sets the Kings up and he takes the Kings down so whatever he does there but what I see here what I see here is even if he were to you think about for a moment with all this has happened and declaration for Biden getting the presidency think about this for a minute what if through recounts and litigation Trump gets the White House back again can you imagine you think they've been rioting and looting and killing and burning buildings down now if that happened this country would be so divided more divided it's been since the Civil War right amen amen it'll rip it completely apart you won't you haven't seen riding and looting and burning down unless something like that happens right the other way uh everything's probably just going to be shut down country will just be shut down you'll probably we you'll probably be required to wear a mask in your shower country will be shut down I'm telling you you see countries are already doing it I read an article this week from a certain news organization not Fox but a different news organization paper that talked about that this um this priest now you talk about well brother new you talking about politics no I'm talking about I'm talking about prophecy I'm talking about the word is sometimes it's hard because the two intermingle so much amen but I read this article and it talked about this Archbishop had sent a letter to Trump and a lot of people believed that he was the last Garrison to hold back this globalism to where these great people that are in power and countries around the world are already giving to it because you see them they they are setting down he he said they will shut down those countries again and that was six months ago and just this month two or three countries started doing that so he was right they are starting to shut it down what do they doing just like I told you the warning the lord gave me it's control they're trying to take over the people they're trying to take over the ones that have no voice you think you do but you don't to take over the people that don't have money only the people that have money and popularity and power those are the ones that want to take over the whole system why are they going to do that because Revelation 17 tells us there's a beast that's going to rise up and take over this whole thing amen amen it's going to be in that same venue and some people well if the government shuts it down then they have a right to pay the people so they can stay alive I agree with that to a point because understand something the more the government pays you the more they own you right right amen you go to communist countries North Korea China and Russia ask them if that's not true right just recently few months ago China went through homes Christian homes homes with the Bible homes with the pictures of Christ up and they said take that picture down and put up Shan pay that's right if you want any assistance from our government you're going to take that down you're going to get rid of that Bible and you're going to claim allegiance to the to the uh to Jay Jen ping it's exactly what they did no more than a couple months ago because they control those people you say oh well they pay us that's wonderful that's great that's fine but the more they pay you the more they own you right because if you become Reliant and dependent on them all they have to do is snap a finger take it away and then what do you do right right you have no jobs you have nothing you can do or it it it's down to that point it's down to that point I'm not saying this is it and I don't know if it will be or not but brother bandham said several times one here from that time 19 July 1960 he said I won't have time the meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's Nation it's number 13 Pier's 13th chapter Revelation 13 star 13 stripes everything 13 everything's a woman remember thus sayith the Lord amen there will be a woman ruled before the end time before the end time amen she'll either be president or vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus sayth the Lord write it down find out young people that it doesn't happen I'm a false prophet now there was all the turmoil about Hillary Clinton right woman president everybody thought she was going to be the woman president people I know told me that they knew people that quit this message when she lost the election because she was surely the one yeah now she was a great powerful woman she was wicked at heart which brother Bram said it' be evil a wicked at heart but I couldn't get past the beautiful part uh I I I'm sorry I'm sure maybe you know to some people she probably was an attractive woman I don't know to me I looked and I thought a wholesale beauty that brother bam talked about she wasn't it she just wasn't it but look at the woman now that's right my wife doesn't think she's attractive I think she's attractive yeah I think she's an attractive woman Wicked at heart oh my the woman she had she started a uh or helped start a fund with money in it to bail out the people that were rooting and Li and riding and burning down buildings yeah she believes in partial birth abortion that the baby's head come out cut it off done Wicked at heart beautiful is that the one I don't know a lot of people might claim this that and the other I don't know right B's Catholic could be Catholic church and the woman they're combin together I mean we don't know we do know as Zach said as uh brother Denis has said God's in control of it amen our job is to rest amen is to rest in the promise that God give us now that being said I want to read one quote about Ruth and I want to enter into the next part of this and when Ruth was resting it was a type of the church resting in the promises of God Amen resting in the promises of God is that okay you rest in the promises of God today can we get past all the other and everything going on no matter you can be in the middle of a whirlwind friend and you can still be at peace amen you can still be at rest cuz you know who your maker is yes you know it's God in control of it and if God is allowing this to happen and and whether it's by uh deceit or vote change or whatever now we know that that happened with Biden because or Biden excuse me Kennedy because it proved it but then maybe it wasn't time so to and a half years later he's done I hate to say it that way he was murdered uh Kennedy was killed 2 and 1/2 years later so I don't know maybe that maybe he needed to be elected what time I don't know uh because sometimes this we just Prospect about it we're not absolutely sure right but in the middle of all that we know that we can be at rest amen whether an election stolen people say it's stolen I don't know if it was stolen could have been maybe not everything's so crooked now it doesn't I mean and people scream on one side of the other the reason I always identify with moderates and Republicans is because I I feel they have a lot more values than I share uh like not anti-abortion so anyway um but at rest at rest either way I'm at rest either way amen doesn't matter uh one way or the other uh whichever way it goes is still not going uphill it's going down heel resting in the promises of God how many promises of God do we have we have the earnest now of our Salvation what's the earnest that's the Holy Ghost holy spirit's the earnest so if you have the Holy Spirit you're born again you now have that Earnest that's in you we're not worried whether we're going over or not we're going amen amen praise the Lord amen we're not worried of whether or not we're going we're going amen because God said so God promised it and we have the promise we have the earnest done been received Christ has accepted us no way to get away from it now we are there amen amen amen all we have to do he's uh writing down the kidsman Redeemer we have the earnest of it right now waiting let's go to uh another scripture in Psalms Psalms chapter 95 all the things I felt the Lord had put on my heart I wasn't sure if I was going to say so now I know amen and now you know those are things that's just been on my heart now there been other things beyond that and you can and I have my personal opinion and if you want to I'm not going to give my personal opinion as far as that goes and you can ask me later if you want to know what it is that's fine but in my personal opinion I don't want to add to effect what the word is here amen the word word is the word regardless of our personal opinion word's a word amen uh Psalms chapter 95 let's begin with verse 7even for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand amen a't that beautiful today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocations and as in the days of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do error in their heart and they have uh and they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest now what's David talking about David of course we see when he talks about the Wilderness he's talking about the children of Israel children of Israel being in Egypt for 400 years in bondage in bondage enslaved to their enemy which became their enemy they were enslaved by the Egyptians and for 400 years were slaves enslaved by the Egyptians God comes to deliver them God sends Moses to deliver to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians out of the land of Egypt God comes and delivers them now before God delivers them what does he do he sends plagues he sends uh pestilence and plagues upon the land of Egypt right well who is in the land of Egypt Egyptians and Israel they're all there in Egypt they're all a part of the same land Egyptians were in one place of course uh Israel was in Goan which they were was not their promised land they were in Goan but it was still Egypt so understand all of them all of God's children all the Israelites were in Egypt while the plagues were hitting Egypt right they were in the plagues but they weren't affected by the plagues amen they were in the middle of all of the plagues that was going on in that country but they weren't affected by the plagues God continued to bless them and prosper them and be with them every step even though they were in the middle of all that was going on around them right yes now when God went to deliver them because you know the story when God went to deliver them the provocation came when some of them many of them begin to murmur and complain against Moses and when they murmured and complained against Moses they were actually murmuring and complaining against God cuz God was the one leading Moses and God told Moses that they rejected you they rejected me amen they murmured and complained oh we should have just been back how many times did they tell Moses how many times they tell the a group of people around we should have just stayed in Egypt we had the flesh pots in Egypt we had this in Egypt we had that in Egypt we were uh they took care of us in Egypt yeah until you looked at the mirror and you saw the back and the stripes so they beat you your hands so GED you oh but they were so good to us they took care of us and we should have just stayed in Egypt some of those people even in the middle of Egypt even though they were exempt from all the the the the pestilence and the plagues and and judgments that God was sending down even though they were there they were in Egypt so many of those people so many of Egypt or or or Israel became so affected by Egypt and they had so much Egypt in their hearts that when they actually were delivered from Egypt they wanted to go back right right they would preferred staying in the world than being delivered by God to a Promised Land amen some of them because they were in Satan's Eden because they were in leoda and the effects of leod DEA press on everyone friend if you're in a flesh body the effects of leod deia press on you every day amen you can deny it all you want but it's a fact because it's the anointing is that Spirit yes same thing happened to them but that became so pressed it does the same thing today friend amen it becomes so pressed down on on on many of those people they they had they had gotten so much of Egypt in their heart to where when God delivered them they wanted to go back to Egypt right they wanted to go back to bondage amen they wanted to go back to slavery because so much of it was in their heart now they looked theart they played the part but in their heart too many people friend had their heart in Satan's Eden that's right don't let Satan's Eden have your heart there's nothing here but misery death pestilence judgment friend in 1956 brother random said this nation rejected God's mercy and when you reject God's mercy there's nothing left but judgment amen right and that's what's happening around today amen it's judgment the pestilence and the judgment is everywhere yes we are exempt from it but you cannot let your heart get captivated by what's going on in this world Amen by layout to by this uh uh uh uh my rights by this by this world that's going on you can't let your heart get in this world let God have your heart God's Got to Be The prominent predominant number one well if he's in your heart he's got to have your heart amen don't let Satan have the heart amen amen that that heart remains in God that that provocation that took place was those people rejecting God those people provoking God saying all kind of evil and wicked things against Moses and against God because their heart was back in Egypt right their body had been delivered but their heart was still in Egypt I'm afraid today friend this this Rapture that's about to take place amen is going to take a people out of this planet it's going to take a people out of this world there going to be a body change with see loved ones appear body change we're going to go out of this place but you will not go out of this place if your heart is still he if your heart is in Le de sea if your heart is in Satan's Eden you will stay here when the Rapture takes place amen the bride goes home and there'll be a lot and my wife were talking about it this morning there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be disappointed on that side you know brother said that right yeah he said the the the the Harlot the the The Prostitute the drunker they're not going to be surprised they're not going to be disappointed it's going to be the one that thought he was right that's right amen but his heart was not with God his heart was in the world right but now as God is about to deliver us as God is about to take his children home if this is another prophecy being fulfilled right if I knew look I'm going to say something very bold here if I knew that this is up because it won't be up until go all of God's chosen are in right we know that but if that last seat is in and I knew that this was to be the thing to Usher that in I would have voted for Biden I just told you who I voted for I wasn't supposed to do that but could it be I don't know I don't know if it is or not might be possible because no matter what roadblocks there are to stop it nothing's going to stop the work of God Amen nothing's going to stop it amen no matter what has to take place or what's going on you say wellow they lied they cheated they stole okay that's fine but when God had to accomplish something with Ahab what did he do he sent a lying Spirit down to go deceive those 400 prophets amen that's what the Bible says right God did that well if God did it then could he not do it now amen amen Satan friend listen Satan is simply a tool in the hand of God that's all he is right that's all he is all the destruction all the things going on yeah that's up the devil yeah it is but who do you think's allowing it right amen amen right God has to be the one allowing it maybe even orchestrating it but he's using the devil to do it right he's just a tool in the hand of God that's all he is let's go to another scripture here Hebrews chapter 4 hopefully it's getting us to the place to understand friend it's just it's just a rest when you get to a point in your relationship with Jesus Christ trusting and believing we all have a relationship with Jesus Christ you get to that place that's a place of rest amen you get to a certain place in there you're rest now you're not complacent I don't mean that you're not just sitting on the seat of do nothing and just complacent no no you're just you're just at rest it doesn't and rest doesn't mean that you don't go to work and earn a living right rest doesn't mean this kind of rest doesn't mean that you don't put food on your table and clothes on your back roof over your head that's not that I'm not talking about that amen it's the rest in knowing that the promise of God's word applies to you yes and we're not as brother Adam said worried about whether we're going there because we're going amen God's already made that loud and clear he told us we're going now a little more as I finish up on the rest Hebrews 4:1 let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it and I I I talk to people sometime and they been in the uh uh the the word a long time they've been Christians a long time they've been in the message a long time they they they have a relationship they say with the Lord and and and yet they seem to somehow be be short of that rest they just can't seem to enter into that rest they enter into that place of of of of knowing that God is taking care of it it it's all okay I know those are strange words to say in today's Dynamic but it's all okay amen it really is as much as I look at it and it Grieves me it it's all okay amen amen remember the Bible says even lot the person he was e even the sin of Sodom grieved his V uh righteous Soul daily the Bible said right so yeah it's hard of that but that doesn't mean that I'm unrested about it it's okay God's going to take care of it yes it's going to work out fine God's going to make it work and and not only that but all of that's going to work together for our good anyway because we love him amen amen we love him but some come short of that rest if you're missing that rest today if it doesn't seem like you're able to get into that rest you have to trust the Lord amen and fir first you must be born again you have the Holy Ghost because that is the rest the Holy Ghost is our rest the promised land for Israel that was their rest the Holy Ghost is our rest amen we're in that rest that's the Lord's given us don't fall short of that rest no that the promised word of God is going to come to pass in our life God has come to redeem us back to himself and there won't be one God cannot lose one amen cannot you say well someone some's going to be left behind I'm fear for my family and my children not one can be left behind am not one right amen are you resting in that on the streaming are you resting in that you you are you believing and trusting God's word and promises amen amen amen for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hurt it now that brings Faith brings a rest see for we which uh for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he SP uh spake in a certain place the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest amen there's a difference in the rest of the world rest in the world and the rest in Christ see his rest yes he works six days rest the seventh there's a great fight that people have had about the Sabbath day which is the Sabbath day you had uh sabbatarians believe Saturday uh they believe that the Saturday is the Sabbath well that was that was the seventh day that was the end of the week yeah we we celebrate that and and we meet together as we consider a Sabbath Day on Sunday but the Sabbath day is neither Saturday nor Sunday the rest is neither Saturday nor Sunday it's a Perpetual existence it's a Perpetual being in the presence of God always not just on Saturday or Sunday right we don't come to just meet with God here we do come to meet with him here but not just here our whole lives should be engulfed with the presence and the rest of God every day not one day not Saturday not Sunday Saturday's the end of the week yeah that's when God rested but the but the first day is a type of the eighth day which is a rolling over into eternity right well what that's a brand new day when Jesus Christ died that was a day but when he rose again that was a new day amen that's started a new life it started a new everything started a new then cuz it was a new day The Eighth Day rolls over into eternity it'll do it again amen we go through the seven Church ages in the Millennium it'll roll over again amen praise the Lord and in and in this time it ERS into eternity that last day time will cease and will enter into eternity amen that's the Eternal rest but we're already partakers of that rest right now amen for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise God did rest the seventh day all his Works in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they do whom uh and they do and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief again he limith a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today is if you will hear the his voice Harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore there remaineth amen remaineth what is remaineth mean remaineth means it was there and it stays there right remaineth doesn't mean that it just came it me it means it was already there and it remains there it doesn't leave praise the Lord there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God now do you consider yourself a people of God Amen a person of God Amen do you consider yourself a child of God well that could be a further question that you need to answer for yourself I can't do that right you have to do that for yourself whether you're streaming whether you're going to watch this archive whether you're here today you've got to answer that for yourself if you're a child of God then this pertains to you amen remains a rest for the people of God it continues it's not just on a Saturday or a Sunday or any day of the week it's here and it continues for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor now again that doesn't he's not talking about not going to the job not earning money and that's not what he's talking about he's talking about laboring over whether you're born again whether you're a Christian whether you uh uh belong to God or not whether your name was in The Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life he's talking about all that laborous things of of of of of indecision and and and decisiveness uh that that Satan wants to try to bring doubt into you all the time and that doubt he brings into you is by fear see that's the work he's talking about cease from my own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest let us labor to enter into rest amen that sounds contradictory doesn't but it's absolute truth well read a scripture here because he goes on in the sixth chapter but um let's see we'll we'll just stop here uh lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing ther of Soul and Spirit and is and of the joint and marrows anderer of thoughts intents the heart that's the Holy Spirit the word but now if you go down to the sixth chapter first verse it says therefore leaving the principles the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection let us go on unto Perfection what does the Perfection produce it's not a Perfection of saying that I am a sinless human it's a Perfection of knowing that you are mature in Christ in the body of Christ in his word go on into perfection in that Perfection is rest amen if it's probably impossible but let's just say that somebody let's just say an artist crafted the perfect painting and they and they in their eyes because they're the master they're the uh ones the painter they're the artist that's making it in their eyes they see it this this is a complete painting it's perfect amen I appreciate Angel and both both angels and um his brother painting this but let just say it's a painting of a of of a landscape well the artist looks at it he says oh I'm I'm done with that painting he signs his name on it he puts his name on the painting right that's right I haven't seen any in the corners there so I guess y'all didn't sign but he signs it in the bottom right hand corner that's his painting her painting whoever that's their painting phito done finished it's perfect amen it's exactly the way I saw it it's exactly the way I wanted it to be there's not one more brush stroke needs to hit that canvas cuz it's perfect the way it is amen he can look at it and he's said that's it amen perfect amen he's not laboring over another leaf or Another Hill whether certain colors right he's rest he's done it's complete it's finished I'm resting it's perfect when you enter into that place of perfection what what do it mean it just means you're in that place of of where God saw you from before the foundation of the world Amen nothing added nothing taken away is is perfection Amen in these bodies yes we still get sick we still have needs and things that happen and we do things that are wrong or say something's wrong or things like that that's the stickiness of this flesh still but the Perfection of that is still entered in into that uh uh entering into that rest and when he says here let us go on unto Perfection what he's saying again is we're not going to take this painting and we G to say oh I hate that part or I hate this part no God's already signed his name he's already amen by placing his life in you he signed his name to you you are exactly the way he saw it before the foundation of the world there's not another bre breast uh uh breast stroke needs to hit you you're finished Hallelujah and he signs it with the Holy Ghost and places his own life in you not another brush stroke needs to hit it so when he says this we're not laying again the foundation repentance of dead works and Faith towards uh Faith towards God that's what you're resting from amen you're not struggling to come back and say oh man that that needs to be changed and this is changed and I need to add a color here to another painting is finished right is perfect it's the way you saw it you signed your name to it it's done amen and people just don't trust God enough sometimes to believe that God has put his spirit in them and has finished the work amen they want to go back and they want to they they want to lay another Foundation uh repentance uh I got to get baptized again I I got to do this work again I I got to do this uh thing that whatever ever it is this work has got to be done and people are just constantly laboring over their own salvation when it wasn't Theirs to labor over to begin with amen God finished your salvation at Calvary all you have to do is it's perfect it's finished when Jesus was hanging on the cross he said it is finished amen yes God signed his name on that scene amen God signed his name on that scene cuz it pleased the father to bruise him amen he he signed his name on it it's finished and now we look to that cross we look to that cross is a finished work in our lives we don't have to go back and worry about laying other foundations oh I got to do this again and I got to oh I made a mistake so I better go get baptized again no no no no no you're at rest amen now you might go to the father and say Lord forgive me I made a mistake Lord and you repent and you ask forgiveness and you pray the Lord that's perfectly fine amen but that doesn't take away your rest amen your rest is still there in the work of Christ not in your work in his work so many people are worried about their work and getting to uh uh getting to heaven on their work you don't get to heaven on your work get to heaven on his work just trust him believe it rest in it when you get to that place you just you rest in the Lord amen you rest in his word of the doctrines of baptisms and the laying on of hands resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment uh all those things they labor after we're not laboring over those things friend we're at rest amen we're at rest we we' we've obeyed the word we fulfilled the part of the word that God give to us now we rest in that we stand upon that word God has give us to rest let me read this I got a couple more scriptures but I'm going to close time is up here the uh seven Church ages in the patmas vision it's a little lengthy but I'll try to cut it off a little bit let's see the Bible teaches us about this sabbath rest for he that is entered into his rest this entering in is not only entering in but remaining in rest not just entering in remaining in that rest am amen it is an eternal rest of which the seventh day is simply a type seven is completion eight is the first day again we talked about that Jesus resurrection was on the first day of the week what recalling bringing forth a new day amen a new week A New Beginning first day of the week giving us eternal life and eternal Sabbath rest thus with because if Christ had not resurrected there would be no rest there' be no Holy Ghost there be no rest amen if there's no rest then we continue to labor but as that eternity broke forth through the resurrection of Jesus Christ as that eternity broke forth it broke us forth into that into Christ and into that rest amen which Israel could not do having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy we go uh why we go back to a shadow when we have the reality of it now how we receive this rest or continuing Sabbath is at the invitation of Jesus he said in Matthew 11: 28:29 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest amen take my yoke upon you and learn of me and you shall find rest or keeping of the Sabbath not a day but an eternal life Sabbath unto your souls a rest unto your souls amen this body may get tired it may uh fight and struggle with with a sickness or with uh laboring on a job or something but our souls have entered into that rest no matter how long you have been laboring under the load of sin whether it's 10 years 30 years 50 years no longer or or longer come with your tired weary life and you will find rest in this true Sabbath yes Jesus will give you rest now exactly what is that rest Jesus will give Isaiah 28 8-12 for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand doctr to them wean from the milk drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little for with stammering lips and other tongue will I speak to this people the Holy Ghost amen Pentecost will I speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest amen this is the rest not something to continue uh uh else to come but a rest a settlement a refreshing this is the rest Sabbath wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest or keeping of his Sabbath and this is the refreshing yet you would not hear here it is prophesied again here in Isaiah and it came to pass about 700 years later at Pentecost when they're all filled with the Holy Ghost exactly as it was and that said that it would be this is the true Sabbath that was promised thus when they were filled with the whole Holy Ghost they cease from their worldly Works they're laboring in sin their worldly doings their evil ways the Holy Ghost took charge of their lives they entered into rest there is your rest there is your Sabbath it is not a day nor a year but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the holy spirit amen it it is you ceasing and God doing amen praise the Lord resting in the promise of his word resting in in the uh in the holy spirit that God has given us that rest amen amen in the rest in the middle of a storm in the rest in the middle of chaos I'm going to give you this story just came to my mind as I close we lived in St Augustin Florida and for three and a half years and uh I had gotten to the place the other day I thought I'm I am embarrassed to say I'm from North Carolina because it look like North Carolina was going blue and I was embarrassed to be in Arizona so I said I'm just going to tell everybody I'm from Florida now I'm from St Augustine I'm lived there three and a half years I'm from Florida anyway I'm just kidding but Florida we lived there three and a half years and a big hurricane was coming Floyd was coming C Category 5 huge you see pictures of it if you put hurricane Floyd on top of Florida it hung out on each side like 200 miles it was that big and the eye and it was supposed to come and almost hit St Augustine and me and my wife prid about it and you know I just talked to the Lord about it and I I felt no urgency everybody was everybody was evacuating everybody was leaving and I looked at I said I don't I don't feel urgent I don't I don't I don't feel there's this uh that the Lord's pulling us to go anywhere uh I I I feel like there's a peace I feel at rest I I don't feel scared I'm not afraid I I don't feel like the Lord's urging me to go somewhere and I you listen to the radio and the interstate was so piled up anyway we couldn't have got anywhere anyway uh people were going uh uh uh it was taking them two mile two hours to go one mile and it's so backed up and I saidwell I said I told my wife I said I don't nothing I don't feel I'm at rest I I've got a pieace about this I don't think there's and it turns out that the hurricane ended up stopping and then going north instead of continuing West it stopped and it went North so it ended up a 100 miles offshore now you know it it we we had some winds and knocked down a limb in the yard and flooded the yard but that was it that was all that happened and then the water went away and all these people came back home I guess and it was just at rest now if God had said something different or get out or something like that then I would have gone right but when you're at peace and when you're at rest you don't struggle over that when something like that comes in life it's it's not a struggle it's it's not a a fight it there's a rest to it there's a peace you feel at rest because God's in control of it if you're one of his then he'll take care of you amen if if you need to get out he'll tell you Hallelujah if it's okay you stay God's going to take care you stay right there amen you you could be in the middle of a tornado and one house in the middle of 10 that were destroyed and one house will be perfect it'll be your house amen praise God yes amen God will take a tornado knock four of out here go up over yours come back down and go across y yes you that's crazy well I you know what I remember brother Jeff Smith's testimony when they come up and he had his his shop on 22nd Street and people come down the street shooting into the shop and all he said they were shooting right in there and and nothing was disturbed no glass was broke no bullet holes in the glass but places behind the building was shot up so you tell me if the bullet didn't go through the glass and through the black wall to hit the places behind them how did it get back there right oh oh amen amen you don't think God can do that hallelujah amen bullets went by the by the dozens bullets went oh oh oh down hit the places behind this building didn't even break a piece of glass right yes amen that's the God I serve that's the god that we rest in friend we trust and believe that's he takes care of us amen amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could that rest I believe is about to become permanent amen I'll just be honest I mean we've said that for years we've talked about the coming of the Lord for years but there'll be a time where we won't talk about it anymore because it'll be a reality amen amen and I'm believing that reality is here if that if that woman is that woman that he saw he said I saw her that's right then where are we I'll just ask you that if she is that one where are we I mean it cuz it won't be a year this man he probably won't be able to carry on a coherent sentence so who's going to take over right we're there it I I don't mean to be derogatory for him if he's if he's going to be the president for I'm going have the respects for him as president like I would any president like the Bible dictates in the office but if that is a fulfillment of that Vision where are we that's right where are we friend we're right here amen amen but that but that should give us more rest than anything amen praise the Lord amen let's sing his chorus uh 650 in your book if you want to look it up amen all is well my good friend lenal r lenal y wrote this
