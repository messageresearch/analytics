[12:12] we're going to go to the lord in prayer
[12:13] now we have a couple of prayer requests
[12:15] i got a text this morning from roger
[12:18] collins he
[12:19] is trying to
[12:20] keep me mostly updated with brother
[12:22] steve buckles
[12:26] he says please pray for brother stephen
[12:27] i know you all are he had a really rough
[12:30] night his oxygen levels
[12:33] with his oxygen levels and wasn't able
[12:34] to stay on the bipap
[12:36] machine due to feeling too
[12:38] claustrophobic
[12:40] uh he was on it for a total of two and a
[12:42] half hours that's been his problem with
[12:44] the bipap is a claustrophobia his oxygen
[12:47] levels are finally at 86 by god's
[12:49] precious grace when he got up on the
[12:52] bedside potty it dropped to 60 and i had
[12:55] a really hard time getting up
[12:57] so the doctor said yesterday that we're
[13:00] going to wait to see how his lungs heal
[13:03] so brother steve wants uh every one of
[13:05] us to pray to god that
[13:07] we heal his lungs
[13:09] amen praise the lord so let's pray as
[13:12] such
[13:13] amen for brother steve buckles the lord
[13:15] would touch and heal his lungs
[13:17] it appeared
[13:19] thursday
[13:21] and into friday
[13:22] the
[13:23] doctors were
[13:25] the hospital wanted to put them on a
[13:26] ventilator i said wednesday night here
[13:28] that they couldn't get his oxygen level
[13:30] up above 80
[13:32] but they finally got it thursday up in
[13:35] the 90s but they still wanted to put him
[13:37] on a on a ventilator so sister
[13:41] hope
[13:42] steve's wife
[13:43] texting good friends with monica collins
[13:46] texting and letting her know what was
[13:47] going on and sister monica because of
[13:50] all the
[13:51] things it just didn't seem or feel or
[13:54] look right she started looking up some
[13:56] of the medicines that they were giving
[13:57] stephen it was stuff that had nothing to
[13:59] do with coping
[14:00] it was just it basically was stuff that
[14:02] was killing him
[14:04] uh
[14:05] and then of course
[14:06] once you go on the ventilator what five
[14:09] percent of people come off of them uh
[14:11] it's almost a death sentence
[14:13] so
[14:15] we just prayed that the lord would
[14:16] intervene and
[14:18] uh help him say you know
[14:21] and and if i and steve did he said i'm
[14:23] not going on the ventilator don't put me
[14:24] i'm not doing it
[14:26] so anyway he didn't go on that this was
[14:28] the latest report today so we're just
[14:31] trusting the lord get all that gunk out
[14:33] of his lungs and clear them lungs up
[14:34] perfect like they should be and just
[14:36] trust the lord touch and heal it
[14:38] completely
[14:40] amen i had a uh again a couple of prayer
[14:42] requests written down joel i didn't see
[14:44] any over there so

[31:00] telling my youngest son that he wanted
[31:02] to see me sometime soon

[33:21] i said there's a randy katie work there
[33:23] and she said yes so she called her for
[33:25] me

[33:29] daughter didn't show up and i prayed
[33:31] lawyer for sure will i really like to

[45:00] glory and the praise for all of it in
[45:01] the name of the lord jesus christ amen
[45:05] amen first thessalonians
[45:08] first thessalonians chapter
[45:11] four
[45:13] start my recording here first
[45:14] thessalonians 4 13.
[45:17] [Music]
[45:18] amen but i would not have you to be
[45:19] ignorant brother concerning them which
[45:21] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[45:23] others which have no hope
[45:26] for if we believe that jesus died and
[45:28] rose again even so them also which sleep
[45:31] in jesus will god bring with him
[45:33] for this we say unto you by the word of
[45:35] the lord that we which are alive and
[45:37] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[45:38] not prevent them which are asleep
[45:41] the lord himself shall descend from
[45:43] heaven with a shout the voice of the
[45:45] archangel with the trump of god the dead
[45:47] in christ shall rise first then we which
[45:50] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[45:52] together with them in the clouds to meet
[45:54] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[45:56] be with the lord wherefore comfort ye
[45:58] one another with these words yes you can
[46:01] be seated if you will
[46:02] as i said we'll just continue on with
[46:04] where we left off from last week uh
[46:08] so much so uh we'll background a little
[46:10] bit of course but more or less we're
[46:12] continuing on where we left off last
[46:14] week and of course that was on the
[46:16] thought that we had or that we took from
[46:18] brother branham that from the scripture
[46:20] that there are six
[46:22] uh scriptural raptures three in the old
[46:25] testament three in the new testament we
[46:28] quantified the first two which was very
[46:31] easy i think we pretty much almost
[46:33] anybody that knows anything about bible
[46:34] christianity knows that enoch was the
[46:37] first one to ever rapture and of course
[46:39] then elijah uh enoch was the man that uh
[46:42] walked with god
[46:44] you can't please you can't walk with god
[46:46] unless you're pleasing to the god yeah
[46:48] man god's not gonna walk with a wolf
[46:50] he's only gonna walk with a with a lamb
[46:52] amen and that dove and that lamb is only
[46:54] gonna
[46:55] come together that that dove will only
[46:57] come to a lamb it won't come to a wolf
[46:59] so if you if if he was walking with the
[47:01] lord then that means he was pleasing to
[47:03] the lord and i believe that would be the
[47:05] same again like we said as today if
[47:07] we're pleasing to the lord the lord will
[47:09] walk with you the lord will speak to you
[47:12] the lord will
[47:13] show you and and reveal things to you
[47:15] and and be a friend to you and be a
[47:17] companion to you amen
[47:19] that's the part of walking with the lord
[47:21] elijah was the second one and of course
[47:24] we know he was taken up in a whirlwind
[47:26] into a chariot of fire
[47:28] and the lord took him home and notice
[47:31] now uh i'm not going to go back to the
[47:33] scripture but if
[47:35] i fail to point out a thing that the
[47:37] lord showed me to point out and that was
[47:39] the fact that both these men according
[47:42] to the scripture the verbiage that was
[47:45] used that they were taken
[47:48] they were taken that was in both
[47:50] instances in both raptures they both
[47:53] were scripturally according were taken
[47:56] amen so both of these men and they were
[47:59] both single men they were both just
[48:01] individual people i don't mean single as
[48:04] did not married although i don't think
[48:06] they were but uh i mean single as then
[48:08] they were it was just one person it
[48:10] wasn't multiple peoples it was just one
[48:13] person amen now if we go back again and
[48:17] sort of pick off pick up where we left
[48:19] off and i had some questions afterwards
[48:21] so i want to try to address those as
[48:23] well
[48:23] and i want to say this too if you're
[48:26] listening to me now
[48:27] um i i it came on my heart to to
[48:31] yesterday or today yesterday
[48:33] that uh if anybody has any questions
[48:36] that you want to try to have answered uh
[48:39] if by the grace of god we can do it if
[48:42] you have questions that you that you're
[48:44] looking to the lord or looking for
[48:46] scriptural answer or something somehow i
[48:48] get people that
[48:50] ask me from time to time questions or
[48:52] text me things or email me things
[48:54] so uh yesterday came on my heart if
[48:56] that's something that you'd like to do
[48:58] if you want to write the question down
[49:00] put it in the box and maybe the lord
[49:03] willing
[49:04] i may just answer that individually to
[49:06] that person or if we get enough maybe
[49:08] we'll just have the questions and
[49:10] answers again
[49:11] just however the lord leads and however
[49:13] it is upon your heart but the lord just
[49:15] put that on my heart so if it's there
[49:17] that's fine if it's not that's fine but
[49:19] it was something that i felt the lord
[49:20] put on my heart to ask if you have
[49:22] questions and answers that you would
[49:24] like to put in the box and we can try to
[49:26] address those but i did have a little
[49:28] bit of question maybe misunderstanding
[49:31] from the scriptural point of view last
[49:33] week uh
[49:35] of this particular point because we got
[49:37] to the third rapture and remember we put
[49:40] jesus as being the third old testament
[49:44] rapture y'all remember why i put jesus
[49:47] as the third old testament rapture
[49:51] anybody remember why i did that
[49:55] because that's what brother branham did
[49:58] brother branham did that uh if you
[50:01] listen to the rapture message brother
[50:03] random made the rat uh the rapture of
[50:06] jesus the third rapture of the old
[50:08] testament so if he made it in the third
[50:11] row even though it's in the new
[50:12] testament if he made it the third
[50:14] rapture of the old testament then i'm
[50:17] not going to question his authority uh
[50:19] how about you i don't think i want to
[50:21] question his authority on that he made
[50:24] jesus rapture the third old testament
[50:27] rapture now i want to go back to matthew
[50:30] as we read last time matthew 27
[50:34] and read these few verses of scripture
[50:36] again matthew 27 46
[50:39] and read these few verses of scripture
[50:41] again because this is kind of where some
[50:43] of the misunderstanding came from
[50:45] because
[50:47] uh
[50:48] you have to follow through complete with
[50:51] the scripture you have to read the
[50:53] scripture exactly the way it is written
[50:56] there's not an interpretation of this
[50:59] this is this is what it says
[51:01] and
[51:02] and it it can
[51:04] sound confusing because
[51:07] we get so used to reading a book
[51:10] and a book
[51:12] follows a thought usually in in
[51:16] congruently or chronologically
[51:19] uh so
[51:20] b follows a and c follows b and d
[51:24] follows c
[51:25] but the bible isn't entirely written
[51:28] that way
[51:29] so
[51:31] when you read the scripture you can't
[51:33] just say oh okay well this is this so
[51:36] this comes this and this comes this it
[51:38] isn't always that way that's right amen
[51:40] scripturally it's not always that way
[51:44] uh i believe personally and i may cross
[51:47] some doctrine here but i believe the
[51:50] seals are that way
[51:51] not the first five
[51:53] but uh
[51:55] uh the last couple anyway but
[51:58] that that's that's my opinion that's my
[52:00] feeling brother ram never says that
[52:01] because she never says it the other way
[52:03] either
[52:04] but i i do know scripturally it's it's
[52:08] not always
[52:09] uh if you read it you and you and you
[52:12] you place this to this it doesn't always
[52:15] work that way
[52:16] i'll just give example as we read
[52:18] through this okay
[52:20] 40 verse 46
[52:22] saint matthew 27 verse 46
[52:25] and about the ninth hour
[52:27] jesus cried with a loud voice saying
[52:30] eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say
[52:34] my god my god why is thou forsaken me
[52:38] some of them that stood there when they
[52:40] heard that said this man called for
[52:42] elias
[52:44] straightway one of them ran took a
[52:46] sponge filled with vinegar put it read
[52:48] gave it to him to drink the rest said
[52:50] let be
[52:51] let us see whether elias will come and
[52:54] save him
[52:55] jesus when he had cried again
[52:58] listen to this now when he had cried
[53:00] again with a loud voice yielded up the
[53:03] ghost
[53:04] amen so he he passed on the life left
[53:08] his body
[53:10] and behold the veil of the temple was
[53:12] rent and twain from the top to the
[53:14] bottom
[53:15] the earth did quake the rocks did rent
[53:18] and the graves were open
[53:21] and many bodies of the saints which
[53:23] slept arose now
[53:26] if you take that just for what it says
[53:29] right now now right there now listen
[53:31] close if you take it just for what it
[53:33] says right there
[53:35] you would think that as soon as jesus
[53:39] yielded up the ghost that all the dead
[53:42] saints rose
[53:44] if you just take that
[53:46] what it just says right there
[53:48] amen because again what he said the
[53:51] graves were open meaning the bodies say
[53:54] of the saints which slept arose
[53:56] you think when he shouted
[53:59] they arose and there they were
[54:02] but if you don't read the rest of the
[54:04] scripture that explains when they rose
[54:09] you will you will take every everything
[54:11] will be thrown out of context
[54:13] and the whole scripture will and the
[54:16] whole point of christ
[54:17] will lose its meaning
[54:19] now i'll get to that if you listen close
[54:21] now
[54:23] but the next verse let's read on
[54:27] and came out of the graves
[54:29] after his resurrection
[54:32] so we noticed that when he cried with a
[54:35] loud voice
[54:36] many of the seats which were sleeping
[54:39] rose
[54:41] but they did not come out of the graves
[54:45] until after his resurrection amen amen
[54:48] when he resurrected they resurrected so
[54:52] there was another three days
[54:54] there was another three days from the
[54:57] time that jesus gave a loud voice
[55:01] and those dead bodies arose
[55:04] from the time that they actually came
[55:06] out of the graves it was three days
[55:09] now if you read it like i said like just
[55:12] a book
[55:13] you would say okay he's crowded a loud
[55:16] voice they rose and there they were a b
[55:19] follows a c follows b d follow c
[55:23] but it doesn't always happen that way in
[55:25] the scripture because the scripture was
[55:27] written by inspiration men filled with
[55:30] the holy ghost god wrote the bible amen
[55:33] so if it is him from the wise and
[55:36] prudent and it's revealed to make such a
[55:38] such as would learn now if you take the
[55:41] old testament saints coming out of the
[55:44] graves and appearing before many
[55:47] before jesus resurrection then what was
[55:51] the point of christ dying in the first
[55:54] place amen that's right
[55:56] because the only way
[55:58] that those old testament saints could
[56:01] have resurrected and come out of the
[56:04] graves and appear unto many was because
[56:07] jesus went to hell he conquered death
[56:11] and hell so they could rise amen amen
[56:15] that was only accomplished
[56:18] at the moment
[56:19] that or completed completely
[56:22] accomplished at the moment that jesus
[56:25] rose from the dead
[56:27] when jesus rose from the dead that was a
[56:30] conquering of death and hell and the
[56:33] grave
[56:35] and at that time
[56:37] is when the old testament saints could
[56:39] come out of the grave themselves right
[56:42] they arose at his voice from their sleep
[56:46] but paradise was not emptied out until
[56:49] he took those keys right
[56:51] and ascended up on high when well
[56:53] resurrected look
[56:56] jesus said in in
[56:58] uh first in revelation chapter 1 verse
[57:00] 18
[57:02] jesus said i am he that liveth and was
[57:05] dead
[57:06] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[57:09] and have the keys of hell
[57:13] and of death
[57:15] well what is the purpose of having a key
[57:18] a key allows you access
[57:22] a key gives you a certain gives you a a
[57:25] level
[57:26] a measure or
[57:28] it gives you complete authority
[57:32] over the entrance way
[57:34] of something
[57:35] that's what a key does
[57:38] they gave me a key to this place because
[57:40] we paid the rent
[57:42] and as long as i pay the rent we have
[57:45] access to this facility
[57:48] amen
[57:49] unfettered access he can't tell me i
[57:52] can't come in if i paid the bill
[57:55] right when jesus paid the bill in full
[57:58] he took the keys and now
[58:00] he is the possessor of those keys now
[58:03] who does he give those keys to today
[58:06] they belong to us yes amen god give
[58:09] jesus give those keys to us
[58:12] amen whatever you bind on earth found in
[58:15] heaven whatever you lose on earth loose
[58:16] in heaven you have that power you have
[58:19] that authority that god gave you with
[58:22] those keys to death and hell when did he
[58:25] get them well he took them from from the
[58:27] devil i guess the plainest dramatization
[58:30] you can give us
[58:33] i like my dads my dad said jesus walked
[58:35] in there he slapped the devil up against
[58:37] the wall snatched those keys open
[58:39] paradise and he ascended up on high.
[58:43] that's a good explanation as any i know
[58:45] of
[58:46] amen
[58:47] he just said move out of my way devil
[58:49] i'm coming through
[58:50] and he did
[58:52] and he emptied paradise as a result
[58:54] and all of them raised at his
[58:57] resurrection
[58:59] not when he died at his resurrection
[59:03] they could only have done that because
[59:06] he rose first
[59:08] praise the lord he had to conquer death
[59:11] and hell before any of us could have had
[59:14] any hope of conquering death in hell
[59:15] ourselves
[59:17] or the great would hold us like it used
[59:18] to hold them
[59:20] hell had claims on us that that hell had
[59:23] claims on them
[59:25] but now because heroes hell has no claim
[59:28] on us anymore
[59:30] death cannot hold us anymore
[59:32] we're we're sons and daughters of god we
[59:34] belong to him death has no hold on us
[59:37] satan has no claim on you hell has no
[59:40] claims to you
[59:42] because he rose
[59:45] amen when heroes they arrows
[59:48] and what did they do as we said the
[59:50] other day they came out of the graves
[59:52] after his resurrection went into the
[59:54] holy series and appeared unto me and
[59:56] there's our type as we said last week
[59:59] same thing they'll do today in this last
[1:00:02] day those that have fallen asleep in the
[1:00:04] lord as we've read so many times first
[1:00:06] thessalonians 4
[1:00:07] as they have fallen asleep in the lord
[1:00:09] they will come forth
[1:00:11] amen because that voice will shout once
[1:00:15] again
[1:00:16] and it will raise the dead amen you know
[1:00:18] that song we sang
[1:00:21] that song actually says the trumpet's
[1:00:23] going to sound so loud but i had it
[1:00:25] changed to i'd like could change it for
[1:00:27] us so the voice is going to shout so
[1:00:29] loud it'll resurrect the dead praise the
[1:00:32] lord
[1:00:32] because that voice will shout and it
[1:00:35] will raise the dead amen amen now
[1:00:39] the only way that they could do that is
[1:00:41] jesus rose is that three day period that
[1:00:44] three day period because remember of
[1:00:46] course we know david said and and and in
[1:00:48] the new testament it says that i'll not
[1:00:51] leave his soul in hell neither will i
[1:00:53] suffer my holy one to see corruption so
[1:00:55] it had to jesus had to raise before that
[1:00:58] corruption set into that body you say
[1:01:01] what was so important about that body
[1:01:02] what's so important about your body
[1:01:05] his filthy past house it wasn't intended
[1:01:08] to be that way those things amen it's so
[1:01:11] as to be in a glorified condition and
[1:01:13] that's why jesus came in a glorified
[1:01:15] condition and that's exactly how we're
[1:01:17] going to come forth that's exactly how
[1:01:19] we're going to see our loved ones come
[1:01:21] for forth in a glorified condition
[1:01:24] amen
[1:01:25] on the third day so there's that three
[1:01:27] day that three-day period from the time
[1:01:29] that they actually rose
[1:01:31] until they actually came out of the
[1:01:33] graves
[1:01:34] now
[1:01:36] we may talk about this more when we get
[1:01:38] to the shout the voice of the trump but
[1:01:40] could you imagine today
[1:01:42] that a voice shout to to wake them
[1:01:47] to arise them
[1:01:49] but yet haven't appeared yet
[1:01:52] before us the graves opened or they they
[1:01:55] they come and appear unto many
[1:01:58] there's a period of time
[1:02:00] i'm trying to help us understand there's
[1:02:01] a period of time there
[1:02:04] the scriptural precedent is there's a
[1:02:06] period of time three days
[1:02:08] between the time that they arose
[1:02:11] and the time that they
[1:02:13] came forth out of the graves
[1:02:15] amen there's those three days
[1:02:18] so if that scriptural press that he hits
[1:02:21] us today then then
[1:02:26] they could already be a rose that's
[1:02:28] right that's right
[1:02:30] we don't know we know we just know
[1:02:32] brother brown said they're as far away
[1:02:33] as you put them right amen they're here
[1:02:36] with us our loved ones
[1:02:38] praise the lord i'm going to read this
[1:02:40] quote again uh to tie this together
[1:02:43] because i wasn't intending on spending a
[1:02:44] lot of time on that but i wanted to i
[1:02:47] wanted to validify this point i wanted
[1:02:49] us to understand that
[1:02:51] if i ran over a little quickly last week
[1:02:53] i apologized
[1:02:54] i i
[1:02:55] i shouldn't but i probably did feel a
[1:02:57] little time constraint on me with uh
[1:03:00] leaving and coming back and that and i
[1:03:02] shouldn't do that but i may have ran
[1:03:04] over a little bit if i did forgive me
[1:03:06] but hopefully this little more thorough
[1:03:09] explanation helps us see uh how that
[1:03:12] uh those events unfolded as they came
[1:03:16] forth rapture brother adam says now
[1:03:20] in the rapture message the old testament
[1:03:22] saints gone into his presence paradise
[1:03:25] done away the old testament saints
[1:03:27] ascended up at his loud voice when he
[1:03:29] screamed and gave up the ghost because
[1:03:32] why this the sacrifice the perpetuation
[1:03:35] of their sins they had waited on listen
[1:03:39] now the perpetuation of their sins that
[1:03:42] they had waited on believing that
[1:03:44] perfect lamb was coming see they were
[1:03:46] looking for that lamb they were looking
[1:03:48] for that messiah to come and pay that
[1:03:50] price to bail them out of hell
[1:03:52] amen they were waiting on it he finally
[1:03:55] came
[1:03:56] they had offered the sacrifice the lamb
[1:03:58] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:04:00] ghosts he screamed the loud voice the
[1:04:01] old testament saints awoke
[1:04:04] watch this shout at the boy and the
[1:04:06] voice over here doing the same thing
[1:04:07] he's talking about first thessalonians 4
[1:04:10] and his coming see he yielded up the
[1:04:12] ghost
[1:04:13] and when he did the sacrifice was
[1:04:15] perfect paradise emptied out the old
[1:04:18] testament saints
[1:04:20] came to the earth again
[1:04:23] walked around on earth and entered in
[1:04:26] him entered in with him at his rapture
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:32] he entered in with him at his rapture
[1:04:35] so as he screamed and yielded up the
[1:04:38] ghost they arose
[1:04:40] when he resurrected they resurrected
[1:04:43] with him
[1:04:44] and all of them appeared now we have
[1:04:47] record in in our bible i know there's
[1:04:50] other ancillary books that have been
[1:04:52] written um
[1:04:54] about this
[1:04:56] uh period of time and
[1:04:59] i've heard different things people talk
[1:05:01] about uh people recognizing or not
[1:05:04] recognizing certain ones of the uh of
[1:05:06] the old testament that came forth but
[1:05:09] just from the bible's sake the the
[1:05:11] recordation we have in this bible is
[1:05:14] that jesus came and appeared unto
[1:05:17] several of his disciples all of them
[1:05:19] actually he came down when they were out
[1:05:22] fishing and he put fish on the farm was
[1:05:24] cooking for him put fish on the fire and
[1:05:26] he was cooking for him uh he came in one
[1:05:30] time through a wall
[1:05:32] he came in and and and
[1:05:34] and thomas wasn't there and they told
[1:05:36] thomas about it thomas said i don't
[1:05:38] believe until i put my hand on my uh my
[1:05:41] uh finger and his hand and my flesh my
[1:05:44] hand and his side and so forth and and
[1:05:46] and jesus come the next time and thomas
[1:05:48] was there and he said here thomas here i
[1:05:50] am
[1:05:51] here put your finger in here put put
[1:05:53] your hand in my side go ahead do it now
[1:05:56] it doesn't say he did it
[1:05:58] amen then that i remember it doesn't say
[1:06:01] that he actually did that but it does
[1:06:04] say that he believed after that amen
[1:06:07] right amen
[1:06:08] so it wasn't necessarily that he had to
[1:06:12] do that but the fact that he was just
[1:06:14] there
[1:06:15] oh and you think how many times people
[1:06:16] think all kinds of things
[1:06:18] right you always think all kinds of why
[1:06:20] do this and i think this and and well if
[1:06:23] i could just do this or something but
[1:06:24] then when you're in his presence all
[1:06:26] that just goes away you're like who care
[1:06:28] i don't want to i don't need to put my
[1:06:30] finger in your hand or my hand in your
[1:06:32] side
[1:06:33] that that all that disappears just
[1:06:35] getting in his presence when you get in
[1:06:37] his presence and all those plans you had
[1:06:40] and all those thoughts you had and all
[1:06:42] those things that you all that just goes
[1:06:44] away and you just melt in his presence
[1:06:46] and it just becomes something it just
[1:06:48] all becomes about him amen it's just
[1:06:51] about i believe that's probably what
[1:06:52] thomas was feeling he got in his
[1:06:54] presence he said oh forget about all
[1:06:56] that and jesus
[1:06:58] amen and he just fell down lord i'm here
[1:07:02] praise the lord i that happens a lot of
[1:07:03] times with us too we get all those
[1:07:06] things in our mind and all those things
[1:07:08] happen
[1:07:09] amen and then it just all goes away so
[1:07:11] jesus appeared
[1:07:13] but it doesn't that i found scripturally
[1:07:16] it doesn't say brother brown uh doesn't
[1:07:18] mention it where
[1:07:20] the old testament saints appeared unto
[1:07:22] me like i said there are other books
[1:07:24] that are written of uh
[1:07:27] that i've heard about like the book of
[1:07:29] the book of mary or the belief of mary
[1:07:31] or those books like that and i've heard
[1:07:33] there's different ones brother green
[1:07:34] talked about them uh i think brother
[1:07:36] green probably read some of them i think
[1:07:38] brother brown probably read some of them
[1:07:40] um but i i think even in mary there's uh
[1:07:44] there's a little thing there about uh uh
[1:07:47] blind bartimaeus and his seeing eye lamb
[1:07:50] well you know that's not the bible right
[1:07:52] but it is in that book
[1:07:54] it's in the prince of the house of david
[1:07:55] too so you know brother brown speaks on
[1:07:58] these things you think well you know did
[1:08:00] he have insight or did he just read it
[1:08:03] in that book and it sounded like a good
[1:08:05] allegory or a good a good dramatization
[1:08:09] so we don't know but we do know
[1:08:11] scripturally that's where i take it from
[1:08:13] genesis to revelation
[1:08:15] jesus appeared unto unto his disciples
[1:08:18] it's not a record of the others except
[1:08:20] that the bible says they did they
[1:08:22] appeared unto many now it doesn't say
[1:08:25] that they appeared unto one it says they
[1:08:28] appeared unto many it doesn't say they
[1:08:30] appeared unto everybody right it just
[1:08:32] says they appeared unto many and those
[1:08:35] are the many of people that i believe
[1:08:37] are the ones that were the believers of
[1:08:40] that time so if you ask me those that
[1:08:43] are about to resurrect from the dead our
[1:08:45] loved ones that have gone on before and
[1:08:47] the ones that have gone on in the other
[1:08:49] church ages from paul on those will also
[1:08:53] be in that position amen amen i i i
[1:08:57] believe they will be now i might not
[1:08:59] know them right off but i believe that
[1:09:01] they will now they're only going to
[1:09:03] appear my opinion now they're only going
[1:09:06] to appear to the believers that's right
[1:09:08] yes
[1:09:10] i
[1:09:10] i say it's not my opinion but
[1:09:13] it's common sense to me why would they
[1:09:14] appear into under believers right right
[1:09:16] i mean the unbeliever is getting its
[1:09:18] message now
[1:09:20] we
[1:09:21] we are the message to the unbeliever
[1:09:24] not the dead that are raising yeah the
[1:09:26] the last the last voice of the last age
[1:09:29] is in the bride
[1:09:30] and the the preaching to the souls that
[1:09:33] are in prison that's happening right now
[1:09:35] is coming from the believer
[1:09:37] from the bride that's not going to come
[1:09:39] from the dead that have gone on before
[1:09:41] that's our job
[1:09:43] our job is to preach to the total lost
[1:09:46] our job is for our lives to manifest
[1:09:48] christ so that people see jesus in us
[1:09:51] and it becomes a uh
[1:09:53] a condemnation to them
[1:09:55] to those who don't change
[1:09:57] so it's not gonna be for the unbeliever
[1:10:00] it's gonna be for the believer yes it's
[1:10:02] going to be for those that are alive and
[1:10:03] remain that are that are going to go in
[1:10:06] the rapture themselves that will see
[1:10:08] these that had gone on before that's my
[1:10:10] opinion now you're talking about
[1:10:14] multiple millions of people amen that
[1:10:17] brother branham talked to
[1:10:19] that have gone on now not not the alive
[1:10:21] and remain group but those that have
[1:10:23] gone on i mean when brother branham went
[1:10:25] over there and he then he looked and he
[1:10:27] saw throngs of people millions of people
[1:10:30] and he said who are all these people and
[1:10:32] they said and the voice came and said
[1:10:34] those are your converts
[1:10:36] brother brown's converts yeah amen
[1:10:39] now i believe i was standing there yeah
[1:10:41] but because i believe uh brother brown
[1:10:44] never personally witnessed to me but the
[1:10:46] message is what spoke to my heart god
[1:10:48] threw that message that brought me to
[1:10:50] him
[1:10:51] but millions so if there was millions
[1:10:55] there that were brother randoms
[1:10:56] cumbersome how about from the first
[1:10:58] church age
[1:10:59] from the time that jesus
[1:11:01] raised
[1:11:02] from that time till today how many
[1:11:05] millions multi millions have gone on
[1:11:08] died in christ
[1:11:10] martyr
[1:11:11] 50 what was it the the catholic martyr
[1:11:14] book said 53 million
[1:11:17] that the catholic church martyred during
[1:11:19] the dark ages
[1:11:21] just during the dark ages 53 million
[1:11:24] they have recorded so there's going to
[1:11:26] be millions and millions that are going
[1:11:29] to actually raise from the debt at this
[1:11:31] last day and appear unto
[1:11:34] a few thousand
[1:11:36] i mean i dare says a million i don't
[1:11:38] know how many it's going to be alive and
[1:11:40] remain i know it's going to be a few
[1:11:41] it's going to be a small number right
[1:11:43] but
[1:11:44] a million is a small number compared to
[1:11:46] 7 billion
[1:11:48] i mean it's supposed to be 7 billion 7.5
[1:11:50] billion people on the earth now so a
[1:11:52] million really is a small number to
[1:11:54] seven and a half billion but however
[1:11:56] many it's going to be you're talking
[1:11:58] about multi multi millions of people
[1:12:02] that are going to raise and come out of
[1:12:03] their graves and appear unto many
[1:12:06] which is going to be
[1:12:09] 100 million appearing to 1 million
[1:12:12] 200 million appearing to 2 million
[1:12:16] don't know
[1:12:17] but i know one thing the statistics and
[1:12:19] the numbers are going to be skewed
[1:12:21] greatly
[1:12:22] but i know personally myself i know

[1:12:32] come up and i'm looking for them
[1:12:35] all of them for my mom dad son brother
[1:12:37] sister i'm looking for them yes so
[1:12:40] there's multiples of people gonna come i
[1:12:43] believe to me
[1:12:44] personally
[1:12:45] but they're gonna appear unto many
[1:12:48] millions and millions and millions are
[1:12:50] going to appear to us
[1:12:52] praise the lord
[1:12:54] how god's going to orchestrate that
[1:12:56] and how that's going to the logistics of
[1:12:58] that
[1:12:59] i have no idea
[1:13:01] i'm just looking forward to it
[1:13:03] amen i'm just looking forward to it now
[1:13:06] acts chapter 1 let's read this again
[1:13:09] we read this last week this is jesus
[1:13:11] rapture acts chapter 1
[1:13:14] verse 9.
[1:13:20] acts chapter one verse nine
[1:13:32] chapter 1 verse 9 and when he had spoken
[1:13:34] these things
[1:13:35] while they beheld he was
[1:13:38] taken there's that word again
[1:13:40] he was taken just like it mentioned with
[1:13:43] enoch
[1:13:44] just like it mentioned with elijah
[1:13:47] just like it mentioned with jesus all
[1:13:49] three
[1:13:51] old testament
[1:13:53] single men one person
[1:13:55] all three taken
[1:13:58] taken jesus said i laid my life down
[1:14:03] and i picked my life back up again
[1:14:06] nobody else has authority over that
[1:14:09] right that is mine and mine alone
[1:14:13] if my life is taken i
[1:14:15] freely lay it down
[1:14:18] amen and he laid it down for us
[1:14:21] he said but then i also take my life
[1:14:23] back up again and he ascended up on high
[1:14:27] so when he did this him
[1:14:30] jesus again being that third old
[1:14:33] testament the single
[1:14:35] person taken it says he was taken up
[1:14:40] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:14:43] sight
[1:14:44] he was taken now remember jesus was that
[1:14:47] cornerstone jesus was the keystone that
[1:14:51] connected the old and the new testaments
[1:14:54] people want to get rid of the old
[1:14:55] testament friend sorry it's a part of
[1:14:57] the bible has been since the beginning
[1:14:59] of time always will be it's god as much
[1:15:03] as the new testament is god right
[1:15:05] you can't get rid of it you don't
[1:15:08] i don't want to get rid of it i mean you
[1:15:10] want to chop the bottom half of god off
[1:15:12] and say well god i only want the top
[1:15:14] half of you or chop the top half holes
[1:15:16] together i only want the bottom half or
[1:15:18] cut off his arms and legs and say god i
[1:15:20] just want your torso
[1:15:22] no it's like last week you take all or
[1:15:24] nothing
[1:15:25] it's every bit of it or it's none at all
[1:15:28] right so the old testament is just as
[1:15:30] important just as much god as the new
[1:15:32] testament and jesus is the one that came
[1:15:35] and brought them together
[1:15:38] because jesus
[1:15:41] died
[1:15:43] then resurrected
[1:15:45] then raptured
[1:15:48] bringing them to bringing the both
[1:15:50] together the old testament and the new
[1:15:52] testament because he died first old
[1:15:54] testament
[1:15:56] resurrected the two together and then he
[1:15:58] raised like we're looking for in the
[1:16:00] gentile rapture his last day
[1:16:03] that keystone quarter stone he's the one
[1:16:06] that brought it all together so again
[1:16:09] everything listen we know this as
[1:16:12] christians as godly people we know this
[1:16:14] but every bit of everything to us comes
[1:16:18] right to that pinnacle and that is
[1:16:20] calvary amen amen that is calvary
[1:16:23] calvary is the pinnacle of all of it
[1:16:27] that's the that that is the place that
[1:16:29] they look to
[1:16:31] and that's the place that we look back
[1:16:33] to america there's where it is at that
[1:16:36] point
[1:16:37] amen not for jesus none of this would
[1:16:40] happen if it weren't for calvary none of
[1:16:42] this would happen
[1:16:44] none of this would exist if it weren't
[1:16:46] for him so every bit of it goes right
[1:16:48] back there again i mean you can't get
[1:16:50] rid of it for when people want to try to
[1:16:51] get rid of the blood they probably want
[1:16:53] to try to get quit singing about the
[1:16:55] cross and and get rid of calvary friend
[1:16:57] you can't get rid of it every bit of
[1:16:59] everything we believe goes right back
[1:17:01] there that's the foundation of it all
[1:17:04] yes if you take that away you have no
[1:17:07] foundation right you're building on
[1:17:09] sinking sins
[1:17:11] have people try to in this message
[1:17:13] try to do that
[1:17:15] oh friend you can't do it
[1:17:17] amen it everything back
[1:17:18] it everybody goes back there that's
[1:17:21] that's that pinnacle that's that
[1:17:22] keystone that's that cornerstone part
[1:17:25] amen that holds this building this body
[1:17:27] together
[1:17:28] praise the lord jesus he's the one who
[1:17:31] did it
[1:17:32] while they stood look uh looks dead
[1:17:35] fastly toward heaven
[1:17:36] as he went up behold two men stood by
[1:17:39] them in white apparel
[1:17:41] amen as jesus was taken up out of their
[1:17:43] sight now
[1:17:45] a
[1:17:46] a scripture
[1:17:48] that we didn't get to last week first
[1:17:50] the first corinthians
[1:17:58] first corinthians chapter 15
[1:18:01] because we know the next rapture is what
[1:18:05] us
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:08] that's us
[1:18:09] all that we've talked about that time
[1:18:11] from from from the resurrection of jesus
[1:18:14] till today all those who died in christ
[1:18:17] will be in this rapture
[1:18:19] all those that have gone asleep will
[1:18:22] raise from their grace and they'll
[1:18:24] appear unto many and those that alive
[1:18:26] and remain will be caught up together to
[1:18:27] meet him in the air
[1:18:28] amen that's that's the rapture we're
[1:18:31] talking about so that so the you've got
[1:18:33] enoch
[1:18:34] elijah and jesus the three old testament
[1:18:37] raptures all three single people
[1:18:40] taken
[1:18:41] taken up
[1:18:43] amen not calling it doesn't say none of
[1:18:45] them say caught up or called away or
[1:18:47] rapture that does not come until the
[1:18:50] fifth rapture which is us true amen
[1:18:52] where it says call away now there is
[1:18:56] there is nowhere in the bible if if you
[1:18:58] know of it you let me know i'll stand
[1:19:00] corrected
[1:19:02] i can't find anywhere in the bible i
[1:19:03] haven't heard anything brother branham
[1:19:05] said that there's any place that that we
[1:19:09] know of except the ephesian scripture i
[1:19:11] read last week for the old testament
[1:19:14] saints raptured
[1:19:16] it does not say in the scripture
[1:19:19] specifically about the old testament
[1:19:21] saints rapturing now it does say the the
[1:19:25] ephesian scripture i read last week
[1:19:26] where he lived captivity cabinet gave
[1:19:28] his son to men and they went up and
[1:19:30] ascended on high with him and i can show
[1:19:32] you again i can read what brother
[1:19:34] branham said and they walked around on
[1:19:36] the earth and entered in with christ at
[1:19:39] his rapture
[1:19:41] we just read that right amen
[1:19:43] fourth so jesus the third now the fourth
[1:19:46] was the old testament saints now the old
[1:19:48] testament saints was not a single
[1:19:50] individual right it was a
[1:19:53] huge large group of people we don't know
[1:19:55] how many the bible doesn't say but
[1:19:57] there's a there was a large amount of
[1:20:00] people that raptured the old testament
[1:20:02] saints that rapture contained a group of
[1:20:05] people
[1:20:06] amen which became our type now they're
[1:20:09] all our types of course we go back to
[1:20:11] enoch with enoch being the seventh from
[1:20:13] adam and so forth and we also can see
[1:20:16] now look at this we also can see that
[1:20:19] the spirit of elijah had a significant
[1:20:22] part in every one of these except for
[1:20:25] enoch
[1:20:27] because the spirit elijah had not been
[1:20:29] introduced until elijah came and of
[1:20:32] course we know that elijah's rapture was
[1:20:35] influenced by the elijah spirit because
[1:20:37] he was elijah
[1:20:38] right this the so that's the second
[1:20:41] rapture third rapture was jesus
[1:20:43] well jesus was what he was introduced by
[1:20:46] john the baptist with the spirit of
[1:20:49] elijah
[1:20:51] amen that he introduced jesus to the
[1:20:53] people
[1:20:54] and of course then subsequently the old
[1:20:56] testament saints well now we're looking
[1:20:58] at this fifth rapture where we're
[1:21:00] talking about the the uh the the current
[1:21:03] gentile new testament gentiles and our
[1:21:06] rapture that we're looking to was
[1:21:09] influenced by who
[1:21:12] the elijah's spirit again
[1:21:14] amen the same elijah spirit that was
[1:21:17] back there and came through and
[1:21:19] introduced jesus same spirit today
[1:21:22] same spirit of elijah on a prophet of
[1:21:25] god for this day to bring a message a
[1:21:28] shout to a people to get her together
[1:21:31] praise the lord now first uh first
[1:21:34] corinthians
[1:21:35] chapter 15 verse 51
[1:21:39] he said behold i show you a mystery
[1:21:43] we shall not all sleep
[1:21:45] but we shall be
[1:21:47] changed
[1:21:49] changed it doesn't say here that we're
[1:21:52] going to be caught up that's first
[1:21:54] thessalonians 4.
[1:21:55] it doesn't say called away it doesn't
[1:21:57] say rapture it doesn't say taken it says
[1:22:00] we're going to be changed
[1:22:03] now i want to bring another aspect of
[1:22:05] this to us today is i got a few more
[1:22:06] minutes please bear with me um
[1:22:09] i want to change the aspect of it a
[1:22:11] little bit because that word change
[1:22:14] brings about the same word
[1:22:17] as
[1:22:18] romans 12.
[1:22:22] let me get to that real quick
[1:22:24] romans 12.
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:31] romans chapter 12 verse 1
[1:22:35] he says i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:22:37] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:22:39] your bodies
[1:22:41] your bodies these things that we're
[1:22:43] living in
[1:22:44] amen so
[1:22:46] when people say that they can't live the
[1:22:48] word they're wrong
[1:22:50] because the bible says that these bodies
[1:22:52] could come under subjection to that
[1:22:54] spirit
[1:22:56] present your bodies
[1:22:58] amen
[1:22:59] a living sacrifice
[1:23:03] holy
[1:23:04] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:23:07] reasonable service amen so our bodies
[1:23:10] are supposed to be presented we present
[1:23:13] them
[1:23:14] amen not brother branham
[1:23:16] not not a minister not a pope not a
[1:23:18] church
[1:23:19] we
[1:23:20] are to present our bodies
[1:23:23] as a living sacrifice
[1:23:27] holy
[1:23:28] and acceptable to god
[1:23:31] well if it's a living sacrifice it's
[1:23:34] going to be holy and if it's holy it's
[1:23:36] going to be acceptable to god
[1:23:38] but those are the three things that
[1:23:40] god's asking for from our from us in our
[1:23:43] mortal flesh our mortal bodies
[1:23:47] and be not conformed
[1:23:49] to this world
[1:23:51] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:23:54] your mind that ye may prove what is that
[1:23:58] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:24:01] god
[1:24:02] good acceptable imperfect
[1:24:06] which is a reasonable service
[1:24:08] which is pleasing to god amen now that
[1:24:12] word
[1:24:13] transformed
[1:24:15] is the same word as
[1:24:17] changed
[1:24:18] we are to be changed
[1:24:21] not just conformed not just forcing
[1:24:24] ourselves into some mole or some pattern
[1:24:27] but we're to be transformed
[1:24:30] like the transformation of jesus in
[1:24:32] matthew 17
[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:35] transformed
[1:24:36] by the renewing of our minds
[1:24:39] now the greek of that is
[1:24:41] morpha
[1:24:42] in morpha or morphu
[1:24:45] is the greek word which we know in
[1:24:46] morpha just means changing from one form
[1:24:49] to another like a caterpillar to a
[1:24:51] butterfly
[1:24:52] we've seen these millions and millions
[1:24:54] and millions and millions of butterflies
[1:24:56] all over tucson the past three or four
[1:24:58] months
[1:24:59] well they were caterpillars they came
[1:25:00] from caterpillars they had to morph the
[1:25:03] size themselves to get in from being a
[1:25:06] caterpillar to being a butterfly
[1:25:09] just like jesus who took upon himself
[1:25:12] the form of a servant
[1:25:15] that word form is the same greek word
[1:25:17] morpho
[1:25:18] changed from one form to another brother
[1:25:21] random talks about an act like a like a
[1:25:23] play
[1:25:24] where a person might make uh might be
[1:25:27] one person but play three different
[1:25:28] parts
[1:25:30] they'll play one part they'll go back
[1:25:32] behind the c and they'll change their
[1:25:33] clothes and they might change and alter
[1:25:35] their voice they'll come back out and
[1:25:36] they'll play another part
[1:25:38] they morph it themselves they were this
[1:25:40] character one minute they came back and
[1:25:42] then they were this character
[1:25:44] same person
[1:25:45] three different characters
[1:25:48] well look friend when when the bible
[1:25:50] says that we are to be changed we are to
[1:25:54] be changed that means that we're going
[1:25:56] to transform
[1:25:59] amen from one form to another that's
[1:26:01] right right now i i i want to challenge
[1:26:05] us today
[1:26:06] that our bodies
[1:26:08] are being presented to god
[1:26:11] perfect
[1:26:13] holy acceptable to god
[1:26:17] our bodies
[1:26:19] you think god doesn't care about our
[1:26:20] bodies yes he does this is the place
[1:26:23] where he is housed
[1:26:26] this is his tabernacle this is his
[1:26:29] temple of course he cares about this
[1:26:32] yes amen
[1:26:34] you look at the old testament where they
[1:26:36] said don't cut themselves and tattoo
[1:26:38] themselves
[1:26:39] you know that cutting themselves like
[1:26:41] that was a heathen trait
[1:26:45] it was the custom of the unbelieving
[1:26:48] heathen to cut themselves
[1:26:52] you think that's okay by god
[1:26:54] no
[1:26:58] our bodies
[1:26:59] are to be a living sacrifice
[1:27:04] dares i say we're
[1:27:06] morphizing
[1:27:08] if that's the word
[1:27:10] we're being in morphine
[1:27:12] we're changing
[1:27:14] what's changing us the word
[1:27:17] what is it changing to the word
[1:27:20] who is it becoming the word
[1:27:23] christ is the word so what's doing the
[1:27:24] changing god's doing the changes
[1:27:28] what is it changing us to something
[1:27:30] that's pleasing and acceptable by god
[1:27:32] amen
[1:27:34] and that's the reasonable service
[1:27:37] yes god cares about our bodies yes he
[1:27:40] does
[1:27:41] he cares about your soul of course your
[1:27:42] soul is the eternal part of you but god
[1:27:45] cares about your bodies
[1:27:47] we are to present our bodies living
[1:27:50] sacrifice holy
[1:27:53] holy acceptable by god amen
[1:27:56] because we're going
[1:27:58] because paul said we are to be changed
[1:28:04] and i'm not changing the word but friend
[1:28:06] i believe we're being changed now
[1:28:11] we are changing now
[1:28:13] are you the same person you were when
[1:28:15] you first accepted christ
[1:28:18] i hope not unless you accepted him
[1:28:20] yesterday right
[1:28:22] i hope you're not the same person we're
[1:28:24] not the same people we were we're
[1:28:25] changing
[1:28:28] how dare i use this devil word
[1:28:31] evolve
[1:28:34] we're changing we're evolving we're
[1:28:35] growing closer into his image we're
[1:28:38] being changed
[1:28:40] we're being changed the rapture change
[1:28:44] is the culmination that's the finish of
[1:28:47] the changing of our bodies that's the
[1:28:49] completion part
[1:28:51] but our bodies are being changed all the
[1:28:54] time more and more into his image more
[1:28:57] and more into his likeness by the word
[1:29:00] that's why the bible says that you are
[1:29:02] written epistle
[1:29:04] read of all men yes written epistle
[1:29:07] where is that writing at in your soul
[1:29:10] well it's already there the writing is
[1:29:12] here where people can read it
[1:29:16] that's the point so people can read it
[1:29:19] it's here so people can read it
[1:29:22] amen let me finish this
[1:29:26] while i show you a mystery we shall not
[1:29:28] all sleep but we shall be all be changed
[1:29:30] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:29:32] then i'll tell you now we understand
[1:29:35] and a moment is a period of time
[1:29:39] a twinkle is a period of time it's a
[1:29:42] very very very short period but it is a
[1:29:44] period of time
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:47] and the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:29:49] sound the dead in christ the dead shall
[1:29:51] be raised incorruptible we shall be
[1:29:54] changed
[1:29:55] same changed
[1:29:57] for this corruptible must put on
[1:29:59] incorruption this mortal must put on
[1:30:00] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:30:03] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:30:06] moral shall have put on immortality then
[1:30:08] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[1:30:10] is written
[1:30:11] death is swallowed up in victory what
[1:30:14] was that victory the resurrection of
[1:30:15] christ
[1:30:18] possessors of the keys of hell and death
[1:30:22] praise the lord oh yes whereas i see o
[1:30:25] brave worst by victory
[1:30:28] the seeing of death is sin and the
[1:30:30] strength of the sin is the law but
[1:30:32] thanks be to god which giveth us the
[1:30:34] victory through our lord jesus christ
[1:30:36] therefore my beloved brethren be you
[1:30:38] steadfastly move always abounding in the
[1:30:40] work of the lord
[1:30:42] for as much as ye know your labor is not
[1:30:44] in vain in the lord now that's the same
[1:30:46] that's
[1:30:47] basically a replica of of of romans 12
[1:30:50] 1-2
[1:30:52] amen always abounding in the work of the
[1:30:54] lord always abounding and obeying his
[1:30:57] word
[1:30:58] being obedient amen for the bad always
[1:31:01] being obedient
[1:31:02] you know the thing that struck me about
[1:31:04] the brother pat's testimony wasn't that
[1:31:06] the lord tested him but it was that he
[1:31:08] put on the radio an announcement that
[1:31:10] was the record silver bells uh are at
[1:31:13] the centerio and anthony that didn't
[1:31:15] exist
[1:31:17] there's nothing when he got there so i'm
[1:31:20] anyway
[1:31:22] sounds strange but god works in
[1:31:24] mysterious ways doesn't he
[1:31:26] amen now let's get to this last one real
[1:31:28] quick uh
[1:31:30] revelation

[1:32:49] elijah
[1:32:50] amen i told you these
[1:32:53] elijah had a significant
[1:32:55] impact on every rapture except for hina
[1:32:58] moses and elijah and they're they they
[1:33:01] witness for three and a half years
[1:33:02] they're finally killed

[1:33:06] leave them laying in the streets
[1:33:08] for three and a half days they leave
[1:33:10] them laying in the streets
[1:33:12] and after three and a half uh
[1:33:15] three days and a half the spirit of life
[1:33:17] came from god entered into them and they
[1:33:20] stood upon their feet and great fear
[1:33:23] fell upon all them which saw them
[1:33:26] and they heard a great voice from heaven
[1:33:28] saying unto them come up hither another
[1:33:31] come up
[1:33:32] catching away caught up amen
[1:33:37] a voice from it saying come up hither
[1:33:39] and they ascended up to heaven in a
[1:33:42] cloud where there were their enemies
[1:33:44] beheld them and of course fear then fell
[1:33:46] on everybody
[1:33:48] because these dead men are laying there
[1:33:50] for three and a half days had corruption
[1:33:52] set in three days 72 hour corruption
[1:33:54] sets in
[1:33:56] amen they were there three and a half
[1:33:57] days dead on the street but their bodies
[1:33:59] rose and they came up and they stood and
[1:34:01] looked and people saw them standing
[1:34:03] there again alive yeah and all of a
[1:34:05] sudden they go up and caught up into in
[1:34:08] a cloud in the air god takes them the
[1:34:10] raptures them home
[1:34:11] amen praise the lord
[1:34:14] those are the two the the
[1:34:16] two jews of that time again moses and
[1:34:18] elijah at that time that actually went
[1:34:20] in the rapture
[1:34:22] amen the other jews did not they they
[1:34:25] the rest of the dead lived not for a
[1:34:27] thousand years they came up in the white
[1:34:28] throne judgment amen but those two were
[1:34:31] the last rapture they died rose and
[1:34:34] wrath amen the last two the last rapture
[1:34:38] that happened scripturally were those
[1:34:40] two so god takes care
[1:34:42] of
[1:34:43] of every one of his jew gentile
[1:34:47] amen
[1:34:49] he takes care of his children he takes
[1:34:52] care of those that belong to him
[1:34:54] and he has
[1:34:55] his scriptural patterns and his ways of
[1:34:58] doing things
[1:34:59] and he and he
[1:35:01] shows those patterns and and reveals
[1:35:04] them and helps us see what is going on
[1:35:07] now
[1:35:08] and what he's doing for us now and
[1:35:10] what's about to take place
[1:35:12] with this changing of our bodies
[1:35:15] amen and in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:35:17] an eye the culmination of change will
[1:35:19] happen and we'll go to meet the lord in
[1:35:21] the air but what do we do first
[1:35:24] we see our loved ones amen amen we see
[1:35:27] our loved ones appear that's the that's
[1:35:29] the literal
[1:35:31] if if we are alive to see that happen
[1:35:33] that is literally the next thing that we
[1:35:35] will notice yeah significant difference
[1:35:38] that we'll notice is our loved ones will
[1:35:40] begin to appear before us yeah and and
[1:35:42] possibly others we always say loved ones
[1:35:44] but there could be
[1:35:46] any any and all of any old testament
[1:35:48] saint that writes that could come and
[1:35:50] appear that you can see and and notice
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] we don't know
[1:35:57] but it could be
[1:35:58] always talk about loved ones because you
[1:35:59] know those are the most dear to you but
[1:36:02] it could be any of the old testament
[1:36:03] saying they'll appear before us
[1:36:06] and we'll be here a minimum of 30 days
[1:36:08] after that and we'll go be the lord

[1:46:28] i said a simple prayer to the lord just
[1:46:30] give a desire for heart and two hours
[1:46:32] after that text she said praise the lord
[1:46:34] it's supposed to be here friday

[1:46:54] we we think of those as little things

[1:46:58] amen they're not god just that's just
[1:47:00] another one of those things like brother
[1:47:02] pat's testimony others that god is
[1:47:04] mindful of you
[1:47:05] amen
[1:47:06] praise the lord

[1:47:14] but when there's nothing there it's just
[1:47:16] between you and god right well and
[1:47:18] that's what i was thinking the whole
[1:47:19] time you're telling the story i'm
[1:47:20] thinking the lord had something for you
[1:47:21] to do with the rack yeah right it didn't
[1:47:23] even exist apparently
[1:47:27] maybe that called a radio station to get
[1:47:29] that dj card
[1:47:33] just kidding that's god amen amen i
[1:47:36] believe that that's god working with you
[1:47:38] you're not working with his children
[1:47:40] i believe that's just as real as any of
[1:47:42] it so
[1:47:43] amen angel would you dismiss us in
[1:47:45] prayer brother
