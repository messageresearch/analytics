[22:06] morning but
[22:06] joel is set to have surgery to get his
[22:09] tonsils removed
[22:10] so we just asked that the congregation
[22:12] would remember to
[22:13] keep them in prayer during that time
[22:15] please and then the surgery would go
[22:17] um just fine and that he will recover uh
[22:20] quickly from it
[22:22] uh let's just stand as we uh lift our
[22:24] hands if you haven't have an unspoken

[25:31] here so over two years ago
[25:32] while correcting his teenage daughter
[25:35] our son lee was brought before
[25:37] a harsh judge that gave him a year's
[25:39] probation
[25:40] in order to stay away from the daughter
[25:43] for the year
[25:44] because he was working a high security
[25:46] job he then lost his job
[25:48] his wife and uh other two children had
[25:50] to see him outside the home
[25:51] just to spend any time together he had
[25:54] to spend money for rent plus you would
[25:56] be without a car for that whole time
[25:58] this has been a hard trial for them all
[26:00] and they have learned some hard lessons
[26:01] lee has grown to trust god more than
[26:03] ever at times it was almost more than he
[26:05] could bear not being able to get a job
[26:06] to support his family two weeks ago he
[26:09] got a job better than the one he had
[26:11] before all the trouble he's back home
[26:13] with his family and they are all doing
[26:14] well
[26:14] praise the lord hey man thank you for
[26:17] that amen

[48:18] we commit ourselves to you now in the
[48:20] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[48:22] amen saint john chapter 18 verse 33
[48:27] then pilate entered into the judgment
[48:29] hall
[48:30] again and called jesus and said unto him
[48:33] art thou the king of the jews
[48:35] jesus answered him sayest thou this
[48:38] thing of thyself or did others tell it
[48:40] thee of me
[48:42] pilate answered i am a jew am i a jew
[48:45] thine own nation and the chief priests
[48:47] have delivered thee
[48:48] unto me what hast thou done
[48:51] jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[48:55] world
[48:56] if my kingdom were of this world then my
[48:58] servants would fight
[48:59] that i should not be delivered to the
[49:01] jews but now
[49:02] is my kingdom not from hence pilate
[49:05] therefore said unto him art thou a king
[49:08] then
[49:09] jesus answered thou sayeth that i am a
[49:11] king to this end was i born and for this
[49:13] cause came i into the world that i
[49:15] should bear
[49:16] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[49:18] of the truth heareth my voice
[49:21] isla said unto him what is truth and
[49:24] when he had said this he went out again
[49:26] unto the jews and said unto them i find
[49:28] in him no fault at all
[49:31] but ye have a custom that i should
[49:33] release unto you one at the passover
[49:36] will ye therefore that i release unto
[49:38] you the king of the jews
[49:40] then cried there all again saying not
[49:42] this man but barabbas
[49:44] now barabbas was a robber you could be
[49:46] seated if you like
[49:48] i want to look at and focus on that 37th
[49:52] verse today
[49:54] although i really liked it there when
[49:57] pilate said i find no fault
[49:59] at in him at all i find in him no fault
[50:02] at all because that lets me know that if
[50:05] i'm in him and there's no fault in him
[50:09] amen amen if there's no fault in him and
[50:12] i'm in him
[50:13] hallelujah if you're in him and there's
[50:15] no fault in him
[50:16] there's no fault in you amen amen praise
[50:19] the lord
[50:20] you got to believe that live that way
[50:22] but my main focus today i want to look
[50:24] at
[50:24] is the 37th verse or 36th verse excuse
[50:28] me
[50:29] jesus said my kingdom is not of this
[50:32] world now i want to focus on that today
[50:35] i had someone ask me this weekend if i
[50:37] would go and listen to a certain message
[50:40] at brother branham priests on the
[50:41] oncoming storm and i did i went to
[50:44] listen to it i read some of it i read
[50:46] through it as i listened to it
[50:47] and the lord gave me a text and gave me
[50:50] something that i want to speak on today
[50:52] and in not in contrast but in complement
[50:56] of what brother branham priest on the
[50:58] uncommon oncoming storm
[51:00] i want to title this today the present
[51:03] storm
[51:04] right the present storm because the
[51:06] storm friend that brother branham was
[51:07] talking about
[51:08] is no longer an oncoming storm it is a
[51:11] present storm
[51:12] amen it is current it is here it is now
[51:15] amen
[51:16] and i i want to talk about the way of
[51:18] provision but i also want to talk about
[51:20] what jesus said here now although we
[51:22] know that we're in the middle of this
[51:24] storm that's going on all around us and
[51:26] all the things of the world and
[51:27] we talked about last week i thought as
[51:29] this person had recommended i really
[51:31] listened to this and as the lord gave me
[51:33] this text i thought well lord that fits
[51:35] perfect what we talked about last week
[51:37] on the on the darkness across the land
[51:39] and gross darkness the people
[51:41] because that storm is exactly what it is
[51:44] in the middle of that darkness
[51:46] uh the only time that i've ever seen a
[51:49] real storm now i've seen rain with its
[51:52] sun shining especially in florida and
[51:53] tucson
[51:54] but i've never seen a real storm i mean
[51:57] a serious storm going on
[51:59] where the sun is out where there's light
[52:01] now it might be bright outside because
[52:03] the
[52:04] cloud because the clouds can't
[52:05] completely hide out
[52:07] the sun but it's dark around and in the
[52:10] middle of storms
[52:11] it's darkness it's dreariness we talked
[52:13] about seattle and how people used to be
[52:15] a
[52:16] suicide capital and all and because it
[52:18] was so dreary and dark and 80 90
[52:21] of their days have no sunlight at all
[52:23] and people just get depressed
[52:25] and they get down because of the
[52:26] darkness because of the dreary because
[52:29] of all the
[52:30] clouds and everything that are always
[52:31] around well that's what a storm is
[52:33] a storm is cloudiness the storm is uh a
[52:36] harmful winds
[52:37] thunder lightning and and damaging
[52:40] products behind a storm usually
[52:42] a real storm now you have little degrees
[52:45] of storms but a real storm like
[52:47] a hurricane tornado something like that
[52:50] um
[52:50] and and we have lived through a couple
[52:52] hurricanes my family has anyway
[52:55] we went through a couple of hurricanes
[52:56] one we were living in north carolina
[52:58] while we were living in florida and
[52:59] uh trust me there they can be pretty
[53:01] violent uh
[53:03] but that storm that we're talking about
[53:04] but i want to focus on
[53:06] this part that jesus talks about i don't
[53:09] want us to get our eyes on the storm
[53:11] micah sent me a thing the other day it
[53:13] just came in my mind actually
[53:15] i didn't even think of this at all when
[53:16] i was putting this together yesterday
[53:18] but mike has sent uh us a thing of jesus
[53:21] and a storm behind him and he says
[53:23] uh don't focus on the storm but keep
[53:26] your eyes on me
[53:27] hallelujah that was jesus see he was it
[53:29] was him talking with the storm behind
[53:31] him saying
[53:32] if you got your eyes on the storm you're
[53:34] not looking at me but don't have your
[53:36] eyes on the storm have your eyes on me
[53:38] am i so that's what my focus is today
[53:40] man to look at that because jesus said
[53:43] my kingdom is not of this world amen now
[53:46] what he said he said now
[53:48] if this kingdom was if my kingdom was of
[53:50] this world this world is cosmos not this
[53:53] earth
[53:54] this ball of dirt of course we know
[53:55] we're going to come live here but this
[53:57] world
[53:57] order this cosmos that we live in jesus
[54:00] said this is not my kingdom
[54:02] my kingdom is not of this world if my
[54:05] kingdom
[54:05] was of this world now listen to this if
[54:08] my kingdom was
[54:09] of this world my servants would fight
[54:12] right
[54:13] my people would take care of me my
[54:15] people would watch after
[54:17] my uh me and all that's going on here my
[54:20] servants would fight for me we would
[54:22] take care of ourselves
[54:23] and the lord would fight for us amen
[54:26] amen but see jesus said this is not my
[54:29] world
[54:30] so what is the fight that we take up
[54:33] the fight that we take up isn't the
[54:35] fight to try to make
[54:37] this cosmos a better place
[54:40] our fight that we take up is the fight
[54:42] that we have
[54:43] that uh we get as many as we can into
[54:45] the kingdom of god and ourselves be
[54:47] ready for when god calls us to go home
[54:49] amen that's our fight that's what we're
[54:52] looking to
[54:52] we fight for the gospel not for all the
[54:55] things that's out here in the world
[54:57] we're not looking to be
[54:58] fighting on that you know the election
[55:00] just happened and everything that's gone
[55:02] on with that and
[55:03] and we know the results and what's
[55:05] happened and all that's behind us
[55:07] so what we're looking at now and what's
[55:09] coming up now what's taking place right
[55:11] now what's going on
[55:13] what are we looking to what's happening
[55:15] in the world this
[55:16] storm that we see swirling around us and
[55:18] all the things that's taking
[55:20] place jesus said to keep our eyes on him
[55:22] because we're not of this world
[55:24] amen his kingdom is not of this world if
[55:27] his kingdom is not of this world
[55:29] then our kingdom is not of this world
[55:31] right if this was not
[55:33] his place to come and rule and reign
[55:35] then it's not our place to come and rule
[55:38] and reign
[55:38] right we're a part of his kingdom and if
[55:41] we're a part of his kingdom
[55:42] then this is not our home amen
[55:46] this cosmos is not our home
[55:49] i'm not looking for perpetual existence
[55:52] friend
[55:52] i'm not looking for a home to make my
[55:54] home uh
[55:56] this world so much better i'm looking to
[55:58] try to get as many people
[55:59] i'm looking to go to heaven amen and i'm
[56:02] looking to try to take as many people
[56:04] with me as i can
[56:05] amen and i trust you do the same yeah
[56:08] that's your desire your desires to make
[56:10] heaven your home
[56:11] and to take as many people as you can
[56:13] with you
[56:14] that's the focus not to make all this
[56:16] the governments and the politics and the
[56:18] monies and the banks and
[56:20] big business and all not not to make
[56:22] we're not here to buy
[56:23] build big kingdoms and have big houses
[56:25] and and and worry about
[56:26] that that's not our this is a different
[56:30] time friend this is a different period
[56:32] there was a time for that
[56:34] but that time is not now right the time
[56:37] now is this bride is focused to go home
[56:40] this brightest focus to to make a
[56:42] rapture and to have our hearts and souls
[56:44] right before the lord
[56:46] amen to have such a faith amen that it
[56:49] changes these bodies into a and to his
[56:52] own glorious body yes that we leave here
[56:56] god is he he's coming waiting for us
[57:00] as he calls us to come to be home with
[57:02] him that's what
[57:04] he wants that's what we want this world
[57:06] is not his home
[57:08] his kingdom was not of this world our
[57:10] kingdom is his kingdom and if his
[57:12] kingdom wasn't of this world our kingdom
[57:13] is not of this world
[57:15] this is not our home friend amen if it
[57:18] was
[57:18] his servants would fight if it was
[57:22] we would fight if it was we would do
[57:25] what we
[57:26] should have to do to be able to keep it
[57:28] going
[57:30] but that's not what that's what the
[57:32] that's not what the anointing of the day
[57:34] is
[57:35] it's not what the word teaches us it's
[57:38] not what the message teaches us
[57:40] it teaches us now that it's time for us
[57:43] to be ready to go home to meet the lord
[57:45] amen let me read you i got several
[57:48] quotes i want to read to you today if
[57:50] that's okay
[57:51] amen yeah
[57:55] some from the oncoming storm this one
[57:58] is from the oddball uh one of my
[58:02] uh one of my favorites i guess you say
[58:05] not doctrinally but one of my favorites
[58:07] when it comes to
[58:10] truth messages i guess it's not
[58:12] doctrinal it's just uh
[58:15] well we're just oddball so that's just
[58:17] the way it is but god's always made his
[58:19] people eyeballs
[58:20] look at all the things that god did for
[58:22] the jewish people the jewish people when
[58:24] they come to
[58:25] when the when the jews went into egypt
[58:28] when joseph went into egypt and his
[58:30] father and all this whole family came
[58:31] they look like
[58:33] they look like crazy people compared to
[58:35] the egyptians
[58:36] they didn't fit in but they weren't
[58:38] supposed to fit in
[58:39] right god's children today we don't fit
[58:42] into this world
[58:43] but we're not supposed to fit in right
[58:46] the
[58:47] god's bride is not supposed to fit in
[58:49] with satan's bride right that's right
[58:52] we're not supposed to fit in we're
[58:53] supposed to be different god's called us
[58:55] to be that way
[58:56] people say well why are you like this
[58:58] and why do you do that because the bible
[58:59] says
[59:00] yes amen that's the plain and simple
[59:03] answer to it because the word says so
[59:06] well but why would he do that i don't
[59:07] think god cares if i do this this
[59:09] well if he didn't why would he put it in
[59:11] his bible right
[59:13] i don't care i don't believe god cares
[59:15] if i go here if i do this or drink a
[59:17] little here or
[59:18] uh uh cut my hair a little bit here or
[59:19] wear this certain garment or what i
[59:21] don't think god would care if he didn't
[59:23] care why he put in his word
[59:26] he does care yes he is he wants you to
[59:29] be called out he wants you to be
[59:31] separated
[59:32] he wants you to be a totally different
[59:34] group of people
[59:36] called out for this last day right
[59:38] you're not supposed to fit in
[59:40] right you're not supposed to look like
[59:41] the rest of them
[59:43] it's always in a person's nature to want
[59:45] to fit in right
[59:46] but we're not supposed to even the
[59:48] kitties at school
[59:49] you're not supposed to fit in in school
[59:52] i i mean you always want to
[59:54] you always want to have buddies and
[59:56] friends and things and
[59:57] you want to kind of fit in and have
[59:59] people to play with and stuff there's
[1:00:01] nothing abnormal about that but you're
[1:00:02] just not ever going to really fit in
[1:00:04] that's right people say that they have
[1:00:06] friends
[1:00:07] what are your friends the friends of
[1:00:09] people that that are with you
[1:00:11] and support you for what you do in your
[1:00:13] life
[1:00:14] not make fun of you don't talk about you
[1:00:16] don't put you down
[1:00:18] but they're there with you and help
[1:00:20] support you that's a friend
[1:00:22] amen and trust me there are very few
[1:00:24] really true friends in life today
[1:00:27] people we use the to me we use the word
[1:00:29] friend kind of loosely yes
[1:00:31] uh we say so and so is a friend they're
[1:00:32] really not a friend they might be an
[1:00:34] acquaintance
[1:00:35] they might even be a close acquaintance
[1:00:36] but they're very
[1:00:38] if you in retrospect look in your life
[1:00:41] and realize i've really only had a
[1:00:43] very few friends in my life right
[1:00:46] i have anyway maybe i'm just maybe i'm
[1:00:49] the oddball
[1:00:50] maybe i'm the only one that's only had
[1:00:52] maybe less than a handful of friends in
[1:00:54] my life but anyway the oddball
[1:00:56] brother branham tells now i've i've had
[1:00:58] this story before but
[1:01:00] when i saw this i wanted to read it
[1:01:02] again
[1:01:04] brother brown tells this story a couple
[1:01:05] times he says a little story and then
[1:01:08] i'm closing sorry i've kept you here
[1:01:09] about 45 minutes now
[1:01:11] there's a home christian home there's
[1:01:13] i've told you this critic
[1:01:14] and in this home there was they believed
[1:01:17] in god in this home
[1:01:18] they had a little boy there and he was
[1:01:20] scared to death in a storm
[1:01:22] lightning oh he was just scared to death
[1:01:25] scared to death
[1:01:26] see notice that amen scared to death
[1:01:30] there's a lot of that going on today uh
[1:01:33] in the storm in the middle of the storm
[1:01:35] a lot of people are scared to death in
[1:01:37] the middle of the storm going on out
[1:01:38] here today
[1:01:39] right a lot of people are yeah and a lot
[1:01:41] of people are
[1:01:42] are worried uh jobs dropping off like
[1:01:45] flies 20 30 40 000 jobs gone to this
[1:01:49] point now but
[1:01:50] people are worried but there's people
[1:01:52] that are genuinely scared they're afraid
[1:01:55] they're afraid and any time that you
[1:01:58] as a christian that you operate in fear
[1:02:00] or that you
[1:02:01] operate by by being scared or or worried
[1:02:05] you're operating in the wrong venue
[1:02:07] you're operating in the wrong emotion
[1:02:10] we shouldn't operate any motion we
[1:02:12] should operate by the moving of the
[1:02:14] spirit in your life
[1:02:15] you should move by what god tells you to
[1:02:18] do amen
[1:02:19] you should do what god is witnessing to
[1:02:21] you what god is speaking to you
[1:02:23] personally
[1:02:24] amen that that's how and not be scared
[1:02:27] scared is not a way to operate
[1:02:29] right scared is not a way to make
[1:02:31] decisions and do things
[1:02:33] you do things and operate and make
[1:02:35] decisions
[1:02:36] based on being scared then they're going
[1:02:38] to end up being the wrong decision
[1:02:40] trust me you're right but see he was
[1:02:43] scared
[1:02:44] in the middle of this storm brother
[1:02:45] ramsey scared to death he would run
[1:02:47] under tables anywhere when it would be
[1:02:49] lightning
[1:02:50] so one night had come a big storm out on
[1:02:52] the farm and they uh where they lived
[1:02:53] the trees was blowing lightning is
[1:02:55] flashing
[1:02:56] getting late in the night the mother
[1:02:57] said junior said now junior you go
[1:02:59] upstairs go to bed
[1:03:01] said now don't be scared go up there so
[1:03:03] the little junior with his pajamas home
[1:03:05] went up the steps
[1:03:07] looking back half crying laid down tried
[1:03:10] to go to sleep covered his head
[1:03:11] he wouldn't go to sleep the lightning
[1:03:13] flashing around the window so he said
[1:03:15] mama mama
[1:03:16] come up here and sleep with me well she
[1:03:19] said junior nothing is going to bother
[1:03:21] you the lightning can't hurt you
[1:03:24] he said but mama come up here please and
[1:03:26] sleep with me
[1:03:27] so the mother went up the steps laid
[1:03:29] down across the bed with junior
[1:03:31] said junior my little son mother wants
[1:03:33] to tell you something
[1:03:34] and i believe he wants to tell us
[1:03:36] something today in the middle of this
[1:03:37] storm
[1:03:39] she said junior we are a christian
[1:03:41] family we believe in god and we believe
[1:03:44] that god protects us in storms
[1:03:47] how many believes that yeah amen god
[1:03:49] protects us
[1:03:50] in the storm we believe that and we
[1:03:53] believe that god
[1:03:54] takes care of his own do you believe
[1:03:56] that believe god takes care of his own
[1:03:58] amen
[1:03:59] and said i want you to believe that
[1:04:01] junior that don't be scared god is with
[1:04:04] us and he'll protect us
[1:04:05] junior snubbed a few more times said
[1:04:07] mama i believe that too
[1:04:09] i said but when that lightning is so
[1:04:11] close to the window i like to feel a god
[1:04:13] that's got skin on it
[1:04:15] amen we took a mother's day on that one
[1:04:18] time remember that a mom with skin on it
[1:04:20] god with skin i like to feel a god
[1:04:22] that's got skin
[1:04:23] on it so i think that's a whole lot he
[1:04:24] said about the the adults today
[1:04:27] in this oncoming storm a god that's got
[1:04:30] skin on it
[1:04:31] but we believe that god takes care of us
[1:04:33] all we believe that god takes care of
[1:04:36] his children in the middle of the storm
[1:04:37] remember who are the ones god's
[1:04:39] responsible to his
[1:04:41] right those are the ones god according
[1:04:43] to the bible those are the ones god is
[1:04:45] responsible to
[1:04:46] are his if we belong to him then we have
[1:04:49] nothing to fear
[1:04:51] amen he takes care of us in the middle
[1:04:53] of the storm
[1:04:55] god takes care of his own now i want to
[1:04:57] get into a couple of different scenarios
[1:04:59] a couple of different stories in the
[1:05:01] scripture here
[1:05:03] one of them begins in genesis chapter 5.
[1:05:09] and i'm going to read them both together
[1:05:12] and talk about them synonymously
[1:05:15] genesis chapter 5 verse 21.
[1:05:28] hey man good to see everybody here on
[1:05:30] time today everybody okay with the 11
[1:05:31] o'clock did that work okay
[1:05:33] everybody like that if you don't then
[1:05:35] you can
[1:05:36] feel feel free to speak up amen
[1:05:40] genesis chapter 5 verse 21 and enoch
[1:05:43] lived
[1:05:44] 60 and five years and begot methuselah
[1:05:47] enoch walked with god after he begot
[1:05:49] methuselah
[1:05:50] 300 years and begot sons and daughters
[1:05:53] all the days of enoch were 360 and five
[1:05:56] years
[1:05:56] and enoch walked with god and he was
[1:06:00] not for god took him boy that's a
[1:06:03] very simple one uh verse
[1:06:07] uh way to describe a rapture amen a
[1:06:10] catching away
[1:06:12] enoch walked with god and as he walked
[1:06:15] with god
[1:06:15] he was not because god took him amen
[1:06:18] that's a that that's a very brief very
[1:06:21] concise
[1:06:22] exact explanation of a catching away or
[1:06:26] rapture which is exactly what we're
[1:06:28] looking to
[1:06:29] to happen for us in this day amen to
[1:06:31] walk with god
[1:06:32] walking with god amen well i trust we're
[1:06:35] all walking with god
[1:06:36] as you walk with god and we're trusting
[1:06:39] and believing having faith in god
[1:06:41] there'll be a time as we walk with god
[1:06:44] that we will not be
[1:06:45] amen not here because god will catch us
[1:06:48] to go home now we'll have a warning amen
[1:06:52] we know that we're living in that season
[1:06:54] already but we will have a time because
[1:06:56] brother branham tells us
[1:06:58] that the loved ones that have gone
[1:06:59] before will resurrect from the dead
[1:07:02] and be with us for a minimum of 30 days
[1:07:04] right
[1:07:05] amen so we know we begin to see our
[1:07:07] loved ones we know what's happening
[1:07:10] and what the time frame is but we also
[1:07:12] know that when that
[1:07:14] happens christians we don't wait for
[1:07:17] that time to happen
[1:07:18] i said well i'll just wait for my loved
[1:07:20] one to appear and then i'll get ready
[1:07:21] well then you won't be ready
[1:07:23] right right and you probably won't see
[1:07:24] them anyway
[1:07:26] because if you're not ready you're
[1:07:27] probably not going to see them
[1:07:29] so we walk with god and we walk with god
[1:07:31] now and as we walk with god there'll be
[1:07:33] a time
[1:07:34] where we will not be because god will
[1:07:36] catch us away
[1:07:37] amen enoch a type of
[1:07:41] the bride amen thank you type of the
[1:07:43] bride
[1:07:44] now go over to genesis chapter 7.
[1:07:48] one page over for me 11 7 and 11.
[1:07:55] genesis 7 11.
[1:08:00] let's read the second story not read the
[1:08:02] whole story but
[1:08:03] in the sixth uh in the 600th year of
[1:08:06] noah's life
[1:08:08] in the second month the 17th day of the
[1:08:10] month
[1:08:11] the same day were all the foundations of
[1:08:14] the great deep broken up
[1:08:15] and the windows of heaven were opened
[1:08:18] and the rain was upon the earth 40 days
[1:08:21] and 40 nights
[1:08:22] in the self same day entered noah and
[1:08:25] shem and ham and japheth and the sons of
[1:08:27] noah the noah's wives and the three
[1:08:29] wives
[1:08:30] uh noah's wife and the three wives of
[1:08:32] his sons
[1:08:33] with them into the ark they
[1:08:37] and every beast after his kind and all
[1:08:39] the cattle after their kind and every
[1:08:41] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:08:43] earth after his kind
[1:08:44] every fowl after his kind every bird of
[1:08:47] every sword
[1:08:48] and they went in unto noah into the ark
[1:08:51] two and two of all flesh wherein the
[1:08:54] breath of life
[1:08:55] uh where is wherein is the breath of
[1:08:58] life and they that went in went in male
[1:09:00] and female
[1:09:01] of all flesh as god had commanded them
[1:09:04] and the lord
[1:09:05] shut him in the lord
[1:09:08] shut noah in the well all of them
[1:09:11] all they go in they are his family all
[1:09:13] the animals
[1:09:14] god closed the door brother branham was
[1:09:16] very explicit to help us understand
[1:09:18] god shut the door even if people came
[1:09:21] and banged on the door
[1:09:22] even after the judgment started and the
[1:09:24] rain was falling
[1:09:26] and they come and knocked on the door
[1:09:27] noah could not open the door because god
[1:09:29] shut the door when god shut the door
[1:09:32] that's the end of it no matter what
[1:09:34] anybody says no matter what anybody
[1:09:35] desires are
[1:09:37] imagine maybe noah's family was out
[1:09:39] there saying noah we believe you now
[1:09:40] open the door
[1:09:42] there's nothing noah could do about it
[1:09:44] right noah couldn't even let his own
[1:09:45] family in
[1:09:46] noah couldn't let his best friends in
[1:09:49] noah couldn't let
[1:09:50] anybody in nobody from his church
[1:09:52] couldn't let his pastor in
[1:09:53] nobody else could come in right it was
[1:09:56] him and his family and those animals
[1:09:57] that was it god shut the door
[1:10:00] it's only up to god whether god shut the
[1:10:02] door god opened the door
[1:10:03] that's god doing it amen now uh
[1:10:06] real briefly brother pat made this uh
[1:10:10] chart one time and we had several of
[1:10:13] them that
[1:10:13] we had the church and if any of you did
[1:10:16] not get a chart of this this is a chart
[1:10:18] of
[1:10:18] like from adam down to uh noah and his
[1:10:21] children
[1:10:21] to the flood if you want one of these
[1:10:24] i'm sure brother pat would be happy to
[1:10:25] make you more i can make you copies of
[1:10:27] this one
[1:10:28] uh can't do it today but if you don't
[1:10:29] have one you'd like one just let me know
[1:10:31] it shows the birth years and
[1:10:34] scripturally
[1:10:34] uh pat took the time to go through the
[1:10:36] book birth years and the
[1:10:38] birth of sons when they died and the
[1:10:40] flood and the scripture and everything
[1:10:42] on it so if you haven't got one of those
[1:10:43] charts you'd like to see it then
[1:10:45] uh uh you know feel free to ask me or
[1:10:48] brother pat
[1:10:48] i'm sure but uh but now we got the two
[1:10:51] stories we got
[1:10:52] enoch who is raptured which is the type
[1:10:55] of the bride
[1:10:56] and we've got noah who was shut in the
[1:10:58] ark by god
[1:11:00] which is a type of the church
[1:11:03] amen noah was a type of the church
[1:11:07] enoch was a type of the bride you
[1:11:09] understand
[1:11:10] noah went through the tribulation noah
[1:11:13] went through the storm
[1:11:15] but the bride enoch raptured before the
[1:11:18] tribulation could set
[1:11:19] in right so you understand the type here
[1:11:23] now
[1:11:24] and we see that noah of course what our
[1:11:26] uh uh
[1:11:27] noah was enoch's great great grandson
[1:11:30] i believe that's great great enoch had
[1:11:32] methuselah
[1:11:33] lamech and then noah is that great great
[1:11:35] or great great
[1:11:37] so a very quick descendant anyway
[1:11:40] which kind of reminds me of grandpa joe
[1:11:42] uh it really hit me this week they had
[1:11:44] grandpa joe's funeral this friday
[1:11:46] i called him grandpa joe as kind of an
[1:11:48] affectionate thing if he was
[1:11:50] if i was in his lineage he'd been about
[1:11:52] my grandfather so
[1:11:53] i always called him grandpa joe anyway i
[1:11:55] just realized this week he was
[1:11:57] my grandchildren's great great
[1:11:59] grandfather he was a double grade
[1:12:01] that doesn't happen a lot he was a
[1:12:03] double great to uh to my grandchildren
[1:12:05] so
[1:12:06] anyway enoch was the type of the bride
[1:12:10] noah the type of the church but enoch
[1:12:13] went in the rapture which is what the
[1:12:15] bride is going to do
[1:12:16] but noah went through the tribulation
[1:12:19] right and as noah went through that
[1:12:21] tribulation
[1:12:22] yeah he was saved god helped him and
[1:12:24] brought him through that
[1:12:25] but it but but enoch never even was here
[1:12:28] when the tribulation
[1:12:29] fell so if that's a type of what we're
[1:12:31] looking for today friend if that's the
[1:12:33] type of what's about to take place
[1:12:35] then this bride is getting herself ready
[1:12:38] to go on a rapture
[1:12:39] while the church is preparing itself to
[1:12:42] go through a tribulation
[1:12:44] look i'm not here to preach you through
[1:12:46] a tribulation
[1:12:47] i'm not here to preach you into a
[1:12:49] tribulation i'm here to try to get us
[1:12:51] ready by faith to go into a rapture
[1:12:54] for a bride of jesus christ now there's
[1:12:57] there's people there that's preparing
[1:12:58] themselves to go into a tribulation
[1:13:01] and that's fine if that's where they are
[1:13:03] in life and that's what their faith
[1:13:05] attributes them to
[1:13:06] then that there's not a thing in the
[1:13:07] world wrong with that but that's not
[1:13:09] what god sent me here to do
[1:13:11] right god didn't send me here to give
[1:13:13] you people to this congregation
[1:13:15] for me to talk you into how you're going
[1:13:17] in and through a tribulation
[1:13:18] right the bride doesn't go through the
[1:13:20] tribulation
[1:13:21] this bride leaves before the tribulation
[1:13:24] yes that's what the brought that's what
[1:13:26] the type that god is give us
[1:13:28] through a current day of present day
[1:13:30] message to help us
[1:13:32] understand where we're at for this day
[1:13:35] we're looking to go home
[1:13:37] we're looking for god to take us home in
[1:13:39] the middle of this
[1:13:40] present storm it's a time to have faith
[1:13:43] it's a time to believe god regardless of
[1:13:46] what we see
[1:13:47] taste phil smell here regardless of what
[1:13:49] the government's doing
[1:13:51] i had people send me stuff and i read
[1:13:52] stuff and i and in my head i
[1:13:55] i like oh my goodness what what's going
[1:13:58] on now
[1:13:59] and i look at something else i think my
[1:14:01] this uh
[1:14:03] this destruction over here and uh the
[1:14:05] the riots over there and
[1:14:08] and all the things that's happening and
[1:14:09] people losing their jobs i'm thinking
[1:14:11] what's going to be next and then god
[1:14:13] reminds me
[1:14:15] that is not your anointing right that is
[1:14:18] not what i called you to do
[1:14:20] i did not call you to fret and to worry
[1:14:23] over all the things that they're doing
[1:14:25] out there because
[1:14:26] i my kingdom is not of this world right
[1:14:29] right
[1:14:30] my kingdom your kingdom is not of this
[1:14:34] world
[1:14:35] god has called us to a different calling
[1:14:37] god has called us to a different
[1:14:38] anointing
[1:14:39] god has blessed us beyond that because
[1:14:42] we're the type of enoch
[1:14:44] and before that real tribulation hits
[1:14:46] this world
[1:14:48] we're going to be gone now i i feel the
[1:14:51] same way
[1:14:53] and sonja tells me all the time don't
[1:14:56] let it get to you
[1:14:57] it's so hard
[1:15:00] i was born in a time i told you before
[1:15:04] i was born in a time you might not have
[1:15:06] the same experience
[1:15:08] i was born at a time where i lived the
[1:15:10] life of a beaver cleaver
[1:15:13] people were decent people were honest
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:17] people i mean you know you couldn't
[1:15:19] completely believe people just by
[1:15:20] handshake but where i grew up and where
[1:15:22] i lived and my friends
[1:15:24] if if you were making a cake and you
[1:15:26] were lacking an egg you just walked next
[1:15:28] door and your neighbor gave you an egg
[1:15:29] and came over and helped you make the
[1:15:30] cake
[1:15:31] right i live within 15 feet of my
[1:15:35] neighbor now
[1:15:36] never hardly even talk to them or see
[1:15:38] them
[1:15:39] must let's buy an egg or a cup of milk
[1:15:42] or or something like that but it used to
[1:15:45] be that way all the time
[1:15:47] neighborhood kids we all played together
[1:15:49] it was nothing for me to get on my bike
[1:15:51] and run down this
[1:15:52] uh ride down a two-lane street four or
[1:15:55] five miles to go get a
[1:15:56] candy bar there's nothing to that
[1:15:59] now he's not my son but do you think if
[1:16:02] joel was in our care
[1:16:03] i would let him do that no way
[1:16:07] not even where i was born or grew up
[1:16:10] definitely not in tucson but not even
[1:16:12] where i was born or
[1:16:13] i wouldn't no way would i do that today
[1:16:16] i i
[1:16:17] we we sent our children to school but i
[1:16:19] don't know if i do that anymore
[1:16:21] right it has gotten so bad right
[1:16:24] and it's hard for me not to take it
[1:16:26] personally
[1:16:28] i try not to because i know where it's
[1:16:29] going i know where we're getting to
[1:16:32] i know what the storm is about and it's
[1:16:35] hard to find
[1:16:36] actually almost hard to find a decent
[1:16:38] honest
[1:16:39] person anymore i know they're out there
[1:16:42] i'm not saying there's not
[1:16:43] there's plenty of them out there i'm not
[1:16:45] trying to
[1:16:46] paint it like that with a broad brush
[1:16:49] but
[1:16:50] but it's the more you look it seems like
[1:16:52] the worse it gets
[1:16:53] right and and but it's supposed to get
[1:16:55] that way and it's hard for me not to
[1:16:57] take it personally
[1:16:58] it's hard for me not to get a little
[1:17:00] cynical when there's so much hypocrisy
[1:17:03] i think they say something here and they
[1:17:05] do it different over here
[1:17:06] right and and it's just it's just
[1:17:09] sometimes i'll be honest it gets the
[1:17:11] best of me
[1:17:12] it overtakes me even then god has to
[1:17:14] calm me down and remind me look that is
[1:17:16] not your anointing
[1:17:18] that is not what i set you here for i
[1:17:20] think it's good that you have a heart
[1:17:22] for people
[1:17:23] and i'm talking to you now a heart for
[1:17:26] people a love for people a desire to see
[1:17:28] the things that's right and
[1:17:30] like brother branham said that i read
[1:17:32] the quote he said but i know what's
[1:17:33] right and what's right and what's wrong
[1:17:36] see and when you see so much wrong it's
[1:17:38] hard not to speak out or say
[1:17:40] something but my voice the voice that
[1:17:44] god has given us
[1:17:45] is for his kingdom not this kingdom
[1:17:48] right we're
[1:17:49] we are not servants to fight for this
[1:17:52] kingdom
[1:17:52] right we are servants to fight for his
[1:17:55] kingdom
[1:17:56] that's what our anointing is that's what
[1:17:58] we're looking for today
[1:18:00] for his kingdom not this kingdom amen
[1:18:04] so our focus can't be on that our focus
[1:18:06] could has to be
[1:18:07] on his kingdom and where god is taking
[1:18:10] us with that
[1:18:11] where we're headed in that look at this
[1:18:14] the oncoming storm
[1:18:15] keeping in mind enoch and and noah here
[1:18:20] the scriptural type that we have for
[1:18:21] this last day
[1:18:24] they were finns uh finnish brother
[1:18:26] brandon was in the scandinavian
[1:18:29] country and they were having mixed
[1:18:30] bathing and all this and and uh
[1:18:33] couldn't understand why they were doing
[1:18:35] stuff like that and the women were
[1:18:37] uh touching the men and stuff anyway
[1:18:39] they said they were finns
[1:18:41] wonderful people but it's a spirit of
[1:18:44] the nation
[1:18:44] listen to this now spirit of the nation
[1:18:48] wherever you go you find the spirit of a
[1:18:50] nation
[1:18:51] and america has one too yes your brother
[1:18:54] brother brown said our
[1:18:55] our our spirit of this nation is frolic
[1:18:58] yes yes frolic that's what he said the
[1:19:00] spirit of america is
[1:19:02] frolic yeah entertainment is we just
[1:19:05] want to be entertained all the time
[1:19:06] right amen always joking
[1:19:10] i i it reminds me of uh and kind of puts
[1:19:13] it in perspective of the boy that's
[1:19:15] going through the graveyard at night
[1:19:16] whistling looking up was
[1:19:20] trying to convince himself he's not
[1:19:21] scared when he knows well he's scared
[1:19:24] walking through the graveyard the little
[1:19:25] boy he does he's i'm not scared no i'm
[1:19:28] not scared there's no ghosts around him
[1:19:29] okay
[1:19:30] you know he's scared and it's the same
[1:19:32] thing people do today
[1:19:34] they don't want to face reality they
[1:19:35] want to face truth
[1:19:37] and so what they do they just engulf
[1:19:39] themselves with all the entertainment
[1:19:40] they can find they're going to have one
[1:19:41] of the biggest entertainment events this
[1:19:43] country has in a whole year
[1:19:46] super bowl's taking place today that is
[1:19:48] nothing wrong super bowl that's all fine

[1:19:53] conditions they put 100 000 people in
[1:19:55] that stadium and however many millions
[1:19:57] are going to be watching it

[1:20:18] billion dollars into building a stadium
[1:20:20] a place just to house them yep i mean
[1:20:23] we're blessed that god blessed us with
[1:20:24] this little humble place here on
[1:20:26] country club that god give us here don't

[1:20:29] millions and millions even a billion
[1:20:31] dollars a huge stadium out here just
[1:20:33] watching people bump into each other
[1:20:38] so what does that show you it's that
[1:20:40] spirit that brother brown was talking
[1:20:41] about
[1:20:42] that's the spirit of america he said
[1:20:44] every nation has a spirit
[1:20:46] you come to america you've really got it
[1:20:49] then that's the worst of all
[1:20:51] and my wife said to me why these people
[1:20:53] go to church and i've often wondered why
[1:20:55] it didn't
[1:20:56] uh condemn their conscience i said my
[1:20:59] dear wife i'll let you know
[1:21:00] they're americans she said well aren't
[1:21:03] we
[1:21:04] he said oh no brother said oh no no i i
[1:21:08] he said no i said we just live here but
[1:21:11] we've been born from above
[1:21:14] amen amen the holy spirit comes upon
[1:21:17] us therefore we are pilgrims and
[1:21:20] strangers here this
[1:21:21] is not our abiding place but we are
[1:21:24] seeking a city to come whose builder and
[1:21:26] maker is gone
[1:21:27] amen amen so we're americans oh we live
[1:21:31] here
[1:21:31] yeah it's just like the spirit of the
[1:21:33] age this lail to see a church age
[1:21:36] well the church age is fine for the
[1:21:38] church
[1:21:39] but the bride has been called out of
[1:21:41] that church into a bright age
[1:21:43] she's living at a different time she's
[1:21:45] living in a different age
[1:21:46] she's been called out of that yes noah
[1:21:49] the church goes right through the
[1:21:50] tribulation
[1:21:51] but the bride goes home in a rapture
[1:21:55] she's been called out she's meant to be
[1:21:57] different she's meant to look different
[1:21:59] she's meant to walk different
[1:22:01] she's a higher walk than all the rest
[1:22:04] because god's calling her home right
[1:22:07] that's the whole point
[1:22:09] we're pilgrims strangers we're seeking a
[1:22:12] city that
[1:22:13] uh seeking a city to come whose builder
[1:22:15] maker is god
[1:22:16] therefore you are born of above you have
[1:22:19] the holy spirit coming down from god
[1:22:21] that changes your nature
[1:22:23] no matter your sister your mother your
[1:22:25] best friend can be dressed that way
[1:22:27] but the christian that's born of the
[1:22:29] spirit of god is born from above
[1:22:32] their spirit is of another kingdom
[1:22:35] amen now what jesus said
[1:22:39] of another kingdom right not of this
[1:22:41] kingdom
[1:22:42] of his kingdom our spirit is of their
[1:22:45] of his kingdom oh i'm so glad of that
[1:22:48] the simpleness of the holy spirit
[1:22:50] to follow it to watch it how it behaves
[1:22:52] makes you behave
[1:22:54] that's the way it was in the days of
[1:22:56] noah and god
[1:22:57] uh god got so filled up with it but
[1:23:00] before he sent a storm listen this now
[1:23:04] the anointing of the day is where we're
[1:23:06] living
[1:23:07] but before he sent a storm to destroy
[1:23:10] the entire world
[1:23:12] god made preparations for those who
[1:23:14] wanted to stay out of it
[1:23:17] amen god has already made preparations
[1:23:20] you believe that amen god has made
[1:23:22] preparations yes for the bride to stay
[1:23:24] out of it
[1:23:25] amen look friend when destruction was
[1:23:28] coming to sodom what did god do was life
[1:23:32] god went and sent two angels to go down
[1:23:34] and remember
[1:23:35] lot was not a type of the bride law was
[1:23:38] the type of the church
[1:23:40] because he went down into the world
[1:23:41] flirted with the world become the
[1:23:43] mayor's brother graham said call him the
[1:23:44] mayor
[1:23:45] of the city become a part of the city
[1:23:47] his wife became so engulfed in it that
[1:23:49] she couldn't even leave it
[1:23:51] when she walked out of it her heart was
[1:23:53] so much still in that world she turned
[1:23:55] around and god cursed her
[1:23:57] turn a pillar of saul but even when lot
[1:23:59] was calling lot came
[1:24:01] out of that city and of course you see
[1:24:04] the effects of lot
[1:24:05] even after god saved them that came out
[1:24:07] of the city and
[1:24:08] from him king moab and all that but
[1:24:11] even when even when the storm was coming
[1:24:13] god sent lot
[1:24:15] abraham's nephew to go down and
[1:24:18] call lot out of sodom
[1:24:22] before the destruction hit right
[1:24:25] now they had a choice they could state
[1:24:27] if they wanted
[1:24:28] but lot and his daughters left of course
[1:24:30] his wife did too but again she turned
[1:24:32] and
[1:24:33] she was in her heart that was the whole
[1:24:36] thing
[1:24:36] it was still in her heart so this was in
[1:24:38] her heart she turned and looked and she
[1:24:39] turned a pillar of salt
[1:24:41] the instruction was like brother dennis
[1:24:43] prayed obedience is better than
[1:24:44] sacrifice
[1:24:46] obedience is best period obey what it
[1:24:49] says it says don't turn around
[1:24:50] very much but it was too much in her
[1:24:52] heart she had to turn around and look
[1:24:54] we should turn around and look god
[1:24:56] cursed her she turned to a pillar of
[1:24:58] salt but
[1:24:58] even lot came out of that came out of
[1:25:01] the world
[1:25:03] but he was a type of the church but look
[1:25:05] at abraham
[1:25:06] who is a type of the bride
[1:25:09] yes he never was in the world to start
[1:25:12] with right
[1:25:13] he never even went down there he was out
[1:25:16] of it
[1:25:17] all together oh praise the lord you see
[1:25:20] where the bride is today
[1:25:22] you see where she is she's not even
[1:25:24] worried so much about that storm
[1:25:27] because she's not a part of the world
[1:25:29] amen amen
[1:25:31] the storm is going on in the world it's
[1:25:32] not going on in
[1:25:34] in in god's uh people right the storms
[1:25:37] going on in the world
[1:25:39] the storm isn't here with us the storm
[1:25:41] is in the world
[1:25:43] that's why we don't worry about that oh
[1:25:46] abraham was never even in the world
[1:25:50] he was never even a part of that he
[1:25:52] wasn't concerned about solomon being
[1:25:54] destroyed because he never was a part of
[1:25:56] sodom
[1:25:58] praise the lord amen i'm not worried
[1:26:00] about solomon being destroyed because
[1:26:02] i'm not a part of sodom amen
[1:26:04] amen glory to god god's called you out
[1:26:09] he sent a storm to destroy before he
[1:26:12] sends a storm to destroy the
[1:26:14] the entire world god made preparations
[1:26:18] for those she wanted out of it
[1:26:20] and i can see noah standing at the door
[1:26:22] of the ark preaching
[1:26:24] righteousness oh there wasn't many that
[1:26:26] would listen to him
[1:26:27] actually it's just his sons and
[1:26:29] daughter-in-laws
[1:26:31] and a few animals actually probably a
[1:26:33] lot of animals
[1:26:35] more animals and there were people right
[1:26:37] yeah my mind what does that tell you
[1:26:39] they were something like that today they
[1:26:42] want entertainment
[1:26:43] not the gospel woe unto these hollywood
[1:26:46] evangelists who is afraid to call sin
[1:26:49] sin right we need some of those
[1:26:51] old-fashioned backwoods preachers got
[1:26:53] the holy spirit that's not afraid to
[1:26:55] preach the gospel with their bare hands
[1:26:57] not covered up with some kind of rubber
[1:26:59] gloves but preach the coming of the lord
[1:27:01] jesus
[1:27:02] judgment for the wicked and heaven for
[1:27:05] the righteousness amen
[1:27:06] praise the lord trust those who live
[1:27:09] godly in christ jesus
[1:27:11] those are the ones that god is calling
[1:27:13] yes
[1:27:14] heaven for judgment for the wicked
[1:27:16] heaven for the righteous
[1:27:18] and they're near approaching what season
[1:27:21] i don't know
[1:27:21] no one else knows but i will warn my
[1:27:25] generation
[1:27:26] brother graham says i don't know he says
[1:27:28] but i will warn
[1:27:30] my generation amen praise the lord god
[1:27:33] now that's the anointing that god's
[1:27:35] given
[1:27:36] i will warn my generation amen seek
[1:27:39] higher ground whether it's higher ground
[1:27:41] yet to be found
[1:27:43] seek on an escape while there's an
[1:27:45] escape yet to be found
[1:27:47] right amen jesus christ is that only way
[1:27:49] of escape
[1:27:51] jesus christ is that only way out of
[1:27:53] that amen
[1:27:55] when moses was we talked about moses
[1:27:57] last week
[1:27:58] and remember the gross darkness that
[1:28:00] came
[1:28:01] at that time of that last judgment all
[1:28:04] those judgments that was on
[1:28:06] egypt israel wasn't part of that
[1:28:08] judgment right
[1:28:09] israel egypt was a part of that judgment
[1:28:11] not israel
[1:28:12] amen they were the ones in the world
[1:28:15] israel was god's people
[1:28:17] they were in egypt but they were called
[1:28:19] out of egypt
[1:28:20] because when the plagues hit god
[1:28:22] protected them
[1:28:23] yes and when the death angel came
[1:28:26] through that land
[1:28:27] it got grossly dark but right at the
[1:28:30] time
[1:28:31] of the darkest gross darkness hour
[1:28:34] came life this day
[1:28:39] the best sign that we have of the
[1:28:42] oncoming rapture
[1:28:44] is how dark it is outside because it's
[1:28:47] always the darkest before the light hits
[1:28:49] right we know that i mean that's every
[1:28:51] day the sun rises
[1:28:52] it's always darker before the sun hits
[1:28:55] in egypt
[1:28:56] it was at its gross darkness when that
[1:28:58] ain't death angel comes sweeping through
[1:29:00] the land
[1:29:01] but what did god do for his children
[1:29:04] he gave them a way of escape yes amen he
[1:29:07] got
[1:29:07] he gave them a way out yes what is our
[1:29:10] way out friend what is god called for us
[1:29:13] not a perpetual existence like like uh
[1:29:17] moses had moses had to have a perpetual
[1:29:20] existence
[1:29:21] even after they left egypt they continue
[1:29:24] to go
[1:29:25] on and on and on that's not the day that
[1:29:27] we live
[1:29:28] brother branham said you can't take
[1:29:31] moses
[1:29:32] noah couldn't take moses message or
[1:29:33] moses knows
[1:29:36] we can't take uh uh elijah's message uh
[1:29:40] it's a different time that we're living
[1:29:42] in today yes uh
[1:29:43] the the message that he had for that day
[1:29:46] what would it
[1:29:47] do for us to go outside and build an ark
[1:29:49] in the back parking lot
[1:29:52] build a big huge boat get all the
[1:29:54] animals come in
[1:29:56] that's not that's not for us today right
[1:29:59] we're not going through a tribulation
[1:30:01] this bride does not go through the
[1:30:02] tribulation
[1:30:05] this day is a going home time yes
[1:30:08] this day is the time that god's calling
[1:30:10] his bride home to be with him
[1:30:13] moses yes god made provision
[1:30:16] when when elijah was running from
[1:30:20] running from jezebel
[1:30:23] and ahab mainly jezebel she's the one
[1:30:26] that threatened his life
[1:30:28] when elijah was running he had no
[1:30:31] strength
[1:30:32] god did what god fed him
[1:30:36] he went down and said under the juniper
[1:30:38] tree and said god just kill me

[1:31:19] anointing that we have for today

[1:31:24] elijah was in strength but god
[1:31:26] blessed him god took care of him god
[1:31:29] took care of moses
[1:31:30] god took care of abraham a lot amen
[1:31:33] and he'll take care of you he always
[1:31:36] does yes
[1:31:37] amen look now
[1:31:41] taking sides with jesus
[1:31:45] he says you remember what that dream
[1:31:48] that i got the interpretation was
[1:31:51] he says the interpretation of the dream
[1:31:54] that brother branham got

[1:32:38] so it's anywhere you go right out in
[1:32:42] denominational creeds you'll go right
[1:32:44] away from the name of the lord jesus
[1:32:46] you'll go right away from these other
[1:32:48] things see and
[1:32:49] here is where the food has been stored
[1:32:52] up well one message
[1:32:55] uh one message that i preach here look
[1:32:58] i've been preaching from one to six
[1:33:00] hours on a message
[1:33:02] well if i had the use of one of those
[1:33:04] message i'd take a week
[1:33:08] to take it to preach it uh just a little
[1:33:10] bit here just a little bit there see
[1:33:12] because it's been being stored up here
[1:33:16] amen the food of the vision
[1:33:19] that god gave brother branham was to
[1:33:22] store the food at the brown
[1:33:23] tabernacle what was the food
[1:33:26] it's on the tapes it'll go worldwide on
[1:33:30] the tapes where people are in their
[1:33:32] houses
[1:33:33] then tapes will fall right into the
[1:33:35] hands of the predestinated of god
[1:33:38] amen praise the lord lord and will feed
[1:33:41] us
[1:33:42] and continues to feed us the food that
[1:33:45] was stored up
[1:33:46] according to the vision god gave brother
[1:33:48] branham amen amen
[1:33:50] in the hands of a predestinated god he
[1:33:53] can direct the word
[1:33:55] he'll direct everything just exactly to
[1:33:58] its course
[1:33:58] that's the reason he sent me back to do
[1:34:01] this was to store
[1:34:02] up that food that food the spiritual
[1:34:06] food what did we talk about the other
[1:34:08] day this is not a natural
[1:34:10] battle he is not biden
[1:34:13] he is not trump he is not kamala harris
[1:34:16] he is not the leader of russia china
[1:34:19] iran
[1:34:20] uh north korea he is a spiritual
[1:34:24] being amen it is in
[1:34:28] incarnating itself in an office
[1:34:33] and this mark of the beast that we've
[1:34:35] been so talking about
[1:34:37] that's causing to bring upon the people
[1:34:40] total control
[1:34:42] and you see that control you see things
[1:34:44] i've seen
[1:34:45] i've seen people do things i never would
[1:34:47] imagine they would do just because of
[1:34:49] the control of the government
[1:34:50] right i i'm serious and people
[1:34:54] and the way they talk and will shame you
[1:34:56] if you don't do it exactly the way they
[1:34:58] think it should be done
[1:35:00] will make you look like a fool or idiot
[1:35:02] or even put you in jail
[1:35:05] poor women poor woman went to watch her
[1:35:07] son play football and they arrested her
[1:35:10] standing in the stands all by herself no
[1:35:12] more than 10 15 feet of her
[1:35:14] didn't have a mask they arrested her put
[1:35:16] her in jail
[1:35:17] because she wanted to watch her son play
[1:35:19] football
[1:35:21] what's he gotten to that's just one very
[1:35:24] mild example
[1:35:25] of a lot of the things that's going on
[1:35:26] today amen that happened four or five
[1:35:28] months ago
[1:35:29] you say oh that's by no it wasn't that
[1:35:31] was when trump was still president
[1:35:33] amen but the clamping down of the states
[1:35:36] is
[1:35:36] especially certain ones uh that's where
[1:35:39] it really came from it was the state and
[1:35:42] the governor that was doing it
[1:35:43] you look at the total control the
[1:35:46] president doesn't have the right to do a
[1:35:47] lot of the things he's doing now
[1:35:49] right bush didn't have the right obama
[1:35:51] didn't trump didn't
[1:35:53] and biden doesn't had the right to do a
[1:35:55] lot of the things they're doing today
[1:35:57] they write hundreds of executive orders
[1:35:59] forget congress
[1:36:00] why do we even need a legislative branch
[1:36:02] anymore why do we even need a
[1:36:04] constitution
[1:36:05] well they'll tell you that democrats
[1:36:07] don't believe in any they don't want it
[1:36:08] anymore
[1:36:09] most people young people in their 20s
[1:36:11] don't believe in the first amendment so
[1:36:13] what's the point in having it
[1:36:17] there was a republican brought up an
[1:36:18] example in congress
[1:36:21] i believe was the house of
[1:36:21] representatives and he said we should
[1:36:24] say the
[1:36:24] pledge of allegiance before we start our
[1:36:26] sessions and the democrats laughed at
[1:36:28] him
[1:36:32] where has he gotten to control
[1:36:35] to keep control over you to try to
[1:36:39] control
[1:36:39] people because that's what the
[1:36:42] revelation 13 is all about
[1:36:43] right controlling the people amen
[1:36:46] controlling the people but remember
[1:36:48] that mark of the beast is a spiritual
[1:36:50] mark and before
[1:36:52] that thing comes on you friend this

[1:44:12] strike the nations and every nation will
[1:44:14] break to pieces
[1:44:16] now a couple more here i'm closing
[1:44:19] to finish this up there's only one
[1:44:22] provided way by god for anything
[1:44:24] there won't be one building setting by
[1:44:26] another one in chicago one of these days
[1:44:29] or nowhere else god is fixing to reign
[1:44:32] out
[1:44:34] fixing to rain out that sixth seal upon
[1:44:36] the earth which we know is tribulation
[1:44:39] about to rain out that sick seal upon
[1:44:42] the earth
[1:44:42] break that seal and turn loose the wrath
[1:44:45] of god upon the earth
[1:44:47] but before he does that the church will
[1:44:50] be gone
[1:44:51] amen amen the church will be gone the
[1:44:54] bride will be gone
[1:44:55] the church the bride will be gone the
[1:44:58] church
[1:44:59] won't she'll go through the tribulation
[1:45:02] church will go through the tribulation
[1:45:03] but the bride will go in the rapture
[1:45:06] his little wife won't go through that
[1:45:10] amen one more feast of the trumpets
[1:45:15] he said what has it done in the
[1:45:18] cunningness
[1:45:19] he said he come in like flatteries
[1:45:20] that's what he had done he's bringing
[1:45:22] the
[1:45:22] he's bringing the protestant ecumenical
[1:45:25] council of the world churches the spirit
[1:45:27] of antichrist upon both of them
[1:45:29] bringing them to the slaughter just like
[1:45:31] they did the other
[1:45:32] in the hour to call the bride how loose
[1:45:36] in the ecclesiastical church spirit
[1:45:38] loosed upon what not the denominations
[1:45:40] but upon the bride
[1:45:43] amen but here now they're loosed upon
[1:45:46] the bride
[1:45:47] 200 000 000 demons or 200 million demons
[1:45:51] loosed upon the bride
[1:45:53] but now what does brother branham say
[1:45:54] but here you get it
[1:45:56] the bride will not go through that time
[1:46:00] the bible says not the church will
[1:46:04] but the bride will not amen she can't
[1:46:09] so you see the different anointings in
[1:46:11] the world today
[1:46:12] you see the different things that's
[1:46:14] going on there's a group of people
[1:46:16] that are readying themselves to go into
[1:46:19] and through a tribulation
[1:46:21] but there's a smaller group of people
[1:46:23] that are ready
[1:46:24] and preparing themselves to go in a
[1:46:27] rapture
[1:46:29] i'm a part of that group yes i believe
[1:46:31] you're a part of that group
[1:46:32] every one of you here may be watching
[1:46:35] you're a part of that group going into
[1:46:38] rapture of course now
[1:46:39] all the others a lot of them think
[1:46:41] they're going into rapture too
[1:46:43] but they're preparing themselves for a
[1:46:45] tribulation
[1:46:46] oh we're going in the rapture but
[1:46:48] preparing for tribulation
[1:46:49] brother graham says the bible says we
[1:46:52] will not go through that time
[1:46:54] amen people say ministers say he says
[1:46:57] he said the bride the church has to go
[1:46:59] through the persecution for the
[1:47:01] perfection of it
[1:47:02] reverend says the blood of the blood of
[1:47:04] jesus christ perfects the bride of
[1:47:06] christ
[1:47:07] have to be purified to go through some
[1:47:10] uh a tribulation to be purified god the
[1:47:12] blood of christ has already purified her
[1:47:15] amen
[1:47:18] a man who chooses a wife look now i like
[1:47:21] this quote
[1:47:23] i use this a lot when people talk about
[1:47:25] the squeeze but he said a man who
[1:47:27] chooses a wife
[1:47:29] don't put her through a lot of
[1:47:30] punishment he's already found grace in
[1:47:34] her
[1:47:36] are with her she's found grace with him
[1:47:40] if he's found grace with her why does he
[1:47:42] marry her just to beat her up
[1:47:45] oh i love you honey wait till we get
[1:47:46] home
[1:47:48] i'll carry you across the threshold but
[1:47:50] as soon as i get
[1:47:52] that that's just silliness right that's
[1:47:54] foolishness
[1:47:55] but there's people that believe that
[1:47:57] spiritually about god and his pride
[1:48:00] oh i love you brian and i made all these
[1:48:02] provisions for you and i love you but
[1:48:04] i'm going to
[1:48:05] pound you into the ground oh there's
[1:48:08] going to be a rapture but i'm going to
[1:48:10] beat the tar out of you before then
[1:48:13] that that doesn't even make any common
[1:48:15] sense that's scriptural sense
[1:48:18] god doesn't do that i'm going to make
[1:48:20] you suffer before you have to come home
[1:48:22] why does the bride have to suffer when
[1:48:23] jesus has already suffered for her
[1:48:25] yes why does she have to go through that
[1:48:28] when god's already gone through it for
[1:48:29] her
[1:48:31] why does she have to experience that
[1:48:33] when he already experienced it on her
[1:48:35] behalf
[1:48:37] he took my place so i could take his
[1:48:40] amen that's the only way i could be
[1:48:43] robed in his righteousness
[1:48:45] and not have a spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:48:48] because of his blood because of what
[1:48:50] he's done
[1:48:52] well if he's done it then why do i have
[1:48:53] to go through it right
[1:48:55] the bride's not going through it friend
[1:48:56] no matter what people might say no
[1:48:58] matter what others might teach
[1:49:00] the bible says the bride does not go
[1:49:02] through that time

[1:49:06] authority of the word the bride does not
