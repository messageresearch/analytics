for him yes amen anyone else this morning and special tennis remember my wife leah she's going back to work starting tomorrow full-time wow and that's a testimony it sounds good she's nervous and she does get tired so the lord gave her strength uh to make it through the week all right yes your will let's just stand as we take these knees to the lord if you have the unspoken prayer requests uh just making known to the lord with it uplifting hands for the goodness lord jesus we come together as a group of believers standing under promises standing on your word sitting together in heavenly places because we're here for one purpose as to meet with you to just draw closer to you to be better prepared for a soon coming rapture and lord there are needs you says there's two shall agree it's touching one thing it shall come to pass and there are more than two believers here today and there should be victory as these requests are made known that you have come on the scene and met our needs according to your riches and glory lord my wife going back to work she does get tired still easily and she's just concerned um just give her the strength that she needs to make it through the week and father above all and i know there's hearts empire raised their hands i want to include my wife that she'll truly see the light of your message of your revealed word has been sent to give the wedding garment to your bride to get her ready for a rapture father make their eyes come open may the revelation of your word become real in their life father and of our request with brother pat in the glaucoma lord we know that you're mindful of this need may you come into scene and touch my brother even now for your honor for your glory and father i read in ecclesiastes just a few minutes ago how solomon said there's a time to live there's a time to die there's a time to plan there's a time to reap but father what speaks to my heart if there's a time to be serious and i walk with you it's right now lord help us not to compromise with the things of the world but to put you first to be a written epistle read and known of all men bless our pastor father as he labors and he brings forth your word may our hearts be open to receive it father to our bread of life father they'll help us to draw closer to you as we eat bread in the natural it gives us strength as we feast uh on your bread of the word of the truth of the uh of the life that is in it lord it gives us spiritual strength to become overcomers granted lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen all right we'll go over any testimonies none of them were written down um but if you could just send in some uh brother bennett or to myself before service or if you want to write them down but i'll give an opportunity at this time if anyone has a testimony yes i actually have three so we heard this week about the lawsuit and um the her lawyer called our lawyer and said that she was going to get financed in that and then he received an email from the banker that he the word he used was wishy-washy and i just don't think that she's going to get financed so the lord is i'm just continuing to thank him and that we'll get our money back for what we gave the other one is that my dad went to get um his hearing checked and he was 48 hearing in one ear and 60 something in the other and i was praying really hard and he was financed for his hearing needs and so i just thank the lord for that and then i am stepping out in faith because i was told that i need to have a root canal and i am claiming it that i do not have to have it like sister sonia and her foot so she didn't have to have foot surgery and i don't have to worry about so thank the lord for that yes praise the lord anyone else thank you lord yes um my wife was at that age she is able to apply for medicare and everything with the pandemic got to do online or go on the phone and she finally got it done and you know the card you can't even apply for any medicare insurance unless you have the card so they finally sent her the card and then she lost it so we prayed and i said it was such a hassle to get the card so i said let's go to the recycle bin so we went through the recycle bin i gave up she says then we look a little bit further and then she pulls it out oh amen yes this morning i when mother's day comes around because i had such a painful time starting many years ago even before i left my home in washington that i wondered if my children were going to call me um for mother's day and if they were going to text me or anything because i i'm always the one that has to initiate it you know to remind them here and i wish them a happy mother's day they have families now and so this morning i was deeply safe i don't dream anymore um um i i started to just just recently a little here and there i realized but um it had been my prayer many years when i came here i didn't have time to sleep i just had to sleep and so for me to have this dream this morning was of god i i heard sounds behind the door and i've dreamt that i was in bed and it was sounds that like from my childhood when we were young and we um were planning something from my mother and i heard whispering behind the doors are supposed to be a big secret and and there was excitement and then also the door opens and then comes my darla and she sits on the bed at the head of the bed and just release and so i i kind of rubbed my eyes and just kind of trying to come too and i saw these numbers flash six seven six and they go back six seven i finally rubbed my eyes and i finally got up in real life i looked at the clock and it was 701 or 702 and so i text her and i told her my dream she says i was thinking about you this morning because i was cleaning and everything doing some you know chores earlier in the morning and she said i was thinking of you but i didn't want to text you too early so i know all the rest of them is behind that door and sure enough the next one came along about two hours later and text me so about an hour and a half later so i am so blessed this morning thank you god has blessed me and let me know that the other ones haven't come through yet but they're back there circumstances that we've got four generations here this morning [Music] amen yes sister i want to give praise that the lord kept my son safe once again with the race and he said it was rough so i'm grateful that the lord kept his hand on him and he didn't get hurt i'm grateful that my little baby girl was here with me today thank you sister anyone else all right we have a few song specials so if you want to go first god bless you i had a really good chance to practice this on the piano but it's relatively easy if you know it it's dedicated to my grandmother i am going to that city where the streets of gold are laid where the tree of life is [Music] [Applause] [Music] in this world [Music] [Music] temptations where the roses never fade here they bloom but for a season [Music] where the roses never fails [Music] [Applause] [Music] waiting [Music] where the roses never fade here they bloom but for a season soon their beauty is [Applause] satan snares we must [Music] cause [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but i am going [Music] [Applause] and [Music] [Applause] my wife also has a song special she'd like to share right now too uh [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] please [Music] [Music] so [Music] yes [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] raised [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] 498 we've sung at once here before [Applause] [Music] all righteousness things every year [Music] is [Music] is [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] my brother [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] one more time [Music] is [Music] is [Music] let's just sing one more song what a day that will be his brother when it comes to bring the words [Music] is [Music] is [Music] that is land glorious day that will be listen now there will be no [Music] no more sickness [Music] with the one who died for me what a a day day that will be one more time now but again that will be with my jesus i shall see when i look upon his [Music] by face hand and he leads me through that promised land amen hallelujah oh friend today aren't you glad of that aren't you looking forward to that i'm so thankful the promise of god amen the promises of god that he gives to us his children amen what would we ever be without it saints what would we ever do without the precious promise of god's word the grace that he gives and the blessings he promises and delivers every day amen i'm so looking forward to that time amen i'm so thankful that uh and appreciative mike is saying that song i can't even begin to tell you i or count how many times my mom and my sister sang that song from the time i can remember probably not much older than joel i was i remember hearing them sing that song amen they're singing it together today and enjoying their time together and i told you all and uh here probably a year or so ago when my mom was going that night i told her i said don't y'all have too great of a party now without me i'll be there pretty soon so enjoy your time together and he then come together again the family reunion but they got one left and i'm i'm ready to go amen i can't remember a time friend that people live in such fear and and i used to think it was just pure out fear and to a level it is but i've just never seen a generation so afraid to die don't get me wrong we're all human we want to live and i appreciate god's goodness and the life that he gives every single day because we're not promised tomorrow but to see people that are so scared to die it makes you realize what a godless society we've become used to didn't be that way friend you know to die was to gain of course that's the scripture people don't know that today people are scared they're afraid i saw a video this week of a lady walking around the supermarket in a bubble she actually created a field around her of pvc and plastic all the way around her and she's still wearing a mask in the middle surrounded by all this plastic and she's going and pushing her little cart in the shop in the shopping center in the grocery store and she's got a mask on she's surrounded i think people are just scared right they've gotten so afraid that that they're just besides themselves now and i understand the precaution i understand wanting to preserve life and the loss of one is is horrible but you know what what greater love is there that that uh that a person laid down their life for their brother but people are so scared today they wouldn't even think to do something like that uh it just it just makes me understand it seems like that that this has just become such a godless society people are just scared of that right they don't know what's going on they don't know where they're gonna go they don't know where they're gonna know they don't know what death entails so they're they're just they're afraid they're scared and they know and and it's sad it's sad that way but i thank god that he's made a provision for us to understand that we've had a prophet that's gone beyond the curtain of time and realize it's just changing of our dwelling place yes amen just from here to there you know to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord that's the scripture so we just stand upon god the promise of god's word and thank him for his blessings and his grace to us so amen happy mother's day to all the mothers happy mother's day to all the potential mothers we kind of at this church turn mother's day into a happy sister's day not to belittle motherhood because in no way would we do that right because it's quite a honor to be a mother but you know we like to honor all of our sisters we like to honor sister sheila said they have four generations her and then her daughter julie and then her daughter shariah and they're all three mothers and little alice is not a mother yet but she's a potential mother and time with terry and there's a very good chance that she'll be a mother one day right you just that's just that's just where we stand and that's where we hold it and that's how that's what regard we hold it in so happy mother's day to you happy mother's day to those who may be streaming or watch this later whatever it is god bless you there's nothing greater in the world and as most of you know i usually try to take a little thought on mother's day so that's what we're going to try to do today and just trust it be a blessing to you so let's just stand to our feet if we could and [Music] give you know a chair or not amen let's turn our bibles over to saint matthew chapter 15. we'll begin our scripture reading there standing room only praise the lord thankful for that god's blessings amen saint matthew chapter 15 we're going to begin reading with verse 21 but before we do let's uh just bow our heads for a word of prayer if we could precious lord jesus it is indeed a privilege lord to be here today thank you for your mercy your love your grace thank you lord for being with us god for never leaving or forsake us thank you for the promise of your word we are two of you are gathered in your name you would be there lord and there's no doubt god there's no doubt in my mind my spirit my heart lord that you are here with us today as you are so presently so real so many times god and it seems to be coming more richer and greater lord that the presence of god is so thick in our congregation our services lord today and the miracles the things you do for us lord we just thank you so much god we just if we could just sit down and begin to write that book of acts lord i believe every one of us could come up with things that you do for us and done for us and lord just the miracles and the healings and god we're just such a blessed people today god i pray that you would continue to strengthen and bless us in your perfect will watch over us and keep this service lord according to your will lord today we rebuke every demonic spirit that we're trying to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way god that you lord jesus we get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done lord i thank you god that we can stand here and give you praise with the with our lips with the fruit of our lips lord and thank you god for uh for these people that have come here today for those who may be streaming lord may you just keep us in your protective care we give you glory honor and praise thank you for all things lord god bless the mothers today thank you for them lord as brother tom prayed lord would none of us be here if we didn't have a mother and it's the reality lord that there is according to your word the medicine or science of this world wouldn't want to change that but the fact of it is that without mothers we would none of us be here god bless them exceedingly lord and god bless each one we thank you lord for all that you do because you you fulfill that part of mother to us lord and we thank you for that god we just commit this service to you may everything we do be pleasing to you to glorify honor praise and worship you for it's in the lovely name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen amen amen saint matthew chapter 15 verse 21 uh let's begin reading here then jesus went thence and departed into the coast of tyre and sidon the old woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying lord are saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said unto her old woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour i mean you could be seated if you like how we could probably just uh take that for a moment and and fold our bibles and go home uh i i believe the story there kind of speaks for itself doesn't it right but there's a few things that i want to mention today that the lord had put on my heart and as i was thinking about mother's day and a couple of weeks ago and it came on my heart and it was sort of fresh in my mind again i guess because we had our prayer meeting a couple of weeks ago on a wednesday and in that prayer meeting this woman came up and her story and her story of faith because our study was on faith and the study that we had kind of i guess brought it back to my remembrance that wasn't what did it but as i was praying the lord put this woman on my heart in this story and then when i started dwelling on it and looking at i thought how powerful it really was and and what an inspiration it should be to all of us not just the fact of the mother although uh i would believe and say that uh the prayers of a the the the love and prayers of a real godly mother prevail before god as much or more than anything amen because you can read the bible yeah you can see through the scriptures how that god has honored the prayers of mothers to the point that people have been blessed and healed and children and and this is just one example of it but this is a tremendous example because think of this for a moment this woman who really had no claims to jesus i mean he really reiterates that to her and says i'm not sent to this woman i'm not sent i'm not here for her i'm here for the lost sheep of the house of israel she's not in that kingdom she's not a part of that group i'm not here to help her and when she cried out to him she cried son of david which she had no claims to him for yeah she was not a jew she did not know him or have claims to him the son of david but he ignored her in her first cry to him he ignored her could you imagine what would happen today if you went and asked somebody of some authoritative position and they just flat out ignored you a man is supposed to be a man of great compassion and love and and healing and blessing and the beatitudes and all that jesus laid out to the people and this great man that i want to implore to and believe that he's going to touch my daughter completely ignores me you imagine what most women today would do oh they'd puff up like a bullfrog eating bug shot and they'd walk oh dare him ignore me i'll go someplace else we've got plenty of doctors that can help my daughter wasn't a doctor in the land can help her but jesus christ but you imagine what the attitude would be but this was a godly mother it doesn't matter if she wasn't a jew it doesn't matter if she was the part of the household of the kingdom of god with the being a jew that is it didn't matter to her she knew where she could get help and she was going to get it and she wasn't going to leave there until she got it and it didn't matter what came on her it didn't matter what he said to her or did to her or didn't do to her she was not going to leave until she got what she came for that is the love of a mother yes and that is my title today emma a mother's love a mother's love again it's strange because uh that that's i guess the title for it that hit me today was a mother's love because that in itself stands alone those of you or mothers here today would understand that you would understand the love that you have as a godly mother now of course there's people out here that just birth babies and they're not really mothers uh even though it's inherent in them to want to be a mother they'd rather drown their kid and go spend ten thousand dollars by dogs right they'd rather go dump their kid in the garbage can and go out and spend five grand for a dog to mother than an actual baby but anyway that that's out in the world but i'm talking about real godly mothers godly mothers those that uh that have that love of god in them for their children and that a mother's love came to my heart and i wrote that down and that was going to be the title for today's message now i woke up this morning which i do a lot of times actually every morning i wake up but i got my subjects backwards there many times i'll open up the app and see what the temperature is supposed to be for the day or the weather or something like that and i looked and there's a little headline underneath the temperature and it said a mother's love is boundless and i thought wow that's just confirmed to me the lord just put that on there for me to see and it actually does say a mother's love which is actually my title today a mother's love is without bounds i think is what it says or boundless something like that a mother's love is boundless and that's exactly the description of what i saw in this in this story here this story doesn't encompass but about seven verses in the bible seven verses out of 66 books and all the uh the verses in this bible this only encompasses about seven but look at the power that's contained in those seven verses amen and that mother's love for her daughter she knew where she could get help she knew where she could get what she needed for her daughter and she just wasn't going to lead till she gave until she got it now god jesus ignored her and put her way in and then she cried after the disciples so much that the disciples came to jesus said jesus please get rid of this woman do something to her because she's just she's driving us crazy and she she's wearing us what can we do about this woman we we need to get rid of her somehow and finally she breaks through and gets to jesus and says oh god have mercy on me amen lord jesus and worshiped him jesus have mercy on me and she said i'm not here for the dogs you imagine if she didn't leave after getting ignored the first time she gone now most women anyway right but not godly women they know where they're standing they know where they're standing and they know how to stand because they have god's word standing with them on their behalf and this woman knew where she was standing and she knew what she wanted right she wasn't leaving but how many after being ignored with the lift how many now after being called a dog what have you look you square in the eye and called you a dog how many would have hung around right right how many would get puffed up there and went away and let their pride get bruised and went off you know what she'd have gone off and she'd have buried her dog but she stood right there she stirred firm and true and she looked at him and she said true master but even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's tape amen she humbled herself right and then she become contrite because she was there needing something and wanting something you know how many times people come to god demanding god do something for them asking god on the on the premise of their pride and basically demanding god do something for them right god i got this down this is written and and basically saying god if you don't do this i won't believe you anymore what what is that to god right your loss but that's the way a lot of times people will approach you it's an ultimatum god i know you can do it you better do it now they might not say it exactly like that but that's or their feeling is and if you don't do it i'm not going to serve you anymore but this woman came with a contrite heart she was humble she wasn't worried about what he was calling her she had a love in her heart for her daughter and she knew the one that could heal her and she stayed there until she got it god looked at this and he wasn't sent for her he told her i'm sent to the outlaw sheep of the house of israel he wasn't sent for her but she still got what she wanted amen and i want you to know what's what the scripture says he said great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou will right jesus didn't proclaim his daughter's heel you see anywhere that there were in that scripture reading where jesus said thy daughter is healed great i heal her in the name of me or whatever he didn't do that right he just said as you go and you believe you'll find it to be so amen so what did it it was her it was her faith it was what was in her heart for her daughter that moved the heart of jesus he didn't proclaim her and uh uh uh healed her mother had done that just through her heart her faith and her actions her faith is what reads god friend and we gotta understand that's what reaches god all the time is our faith amen you can have the most beautiful words the most swelling words you can stand before uh thrones and kingdoms and tens of thousands of people with your beautiful elegancy and and people want a beautiful orchard today but you want to have somebody that can talk to god who can reach god it doesn't matter if they know their adverbs and their adjectives and their nouns or whatever right somebody that can reach god somebody that can contact god and the only way you can do that is by your faith and that's what this woman did she touched god by her faith and she received healing for her daughter because she touched god with that faith he wasn't sent for her but she didn't care her faith reached god amen and jesus said go you'll find it as you believe as you say that's exactly how it will be being unto thee as thou wilt and her daughter was healed from that very hour amen it was her faith again it was her faith that would believe it was her faith that moved the hand of god and she was going to do what she had to do to get it amen and she got it and her daughter was healed reminds me of a story that brother branham told one time um let me see here got it printed out you probably remember this story i got a couple stories i want to read today that's okay good examples of a mother's love look at this when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes its place 1957 and then a little mother was screaming when i called for the prayer line and billy come to me and said daddy you're going to have to do something sounds a little familiar doesn't it the disciples came to jesus and said jesus you're going to have to do something we can't hold her back anymore billy comes to his dead he says daddy you got to do something a mother's baby died at three o'clock this afternoon the little captain woman her baby is dead and she's uh got it all covered up said when brother espinosa gave out the prayer card she didn't get one but there isn't enough ushers to hold that woman from this platform anymore right one woman holding a little baby swallowing clothes and there wasn't enough men ushers to hold her back right that's the heart of a mother that's a mother's love wanting to get something for her baby yes and she knew where she could get it and she knew where she stood and she knew how she could get it and she was going to the right place right not necessarily brother branham but to jesus christ she knew how to get it amen there wasn't enough ushers to keep her from that platform hey man she got that baby screaming to the top of her voice padre padre which means father a look down through that long streak of life and that woman frantically beautiful little lady tears streaming down her cheeks watering her arms screaming to the top of her voice i said to brother moore standing on the platform one of the managers i said go down and pray for the baby maybe that will console her little mother's love for that baby i turned to the audience to minister again i looked over at the audience i've seen the little spanish baby now this is a vision now brother branham's having he turns to the congregation there the audience since he calls it and he as he's looking on the audience he sees a vision when he sees this vision he sees this little spanish baby setting up going amen there you go brother moore was trying to quieten her but he didn't satisfy her little heart a mother's love was being projected to god there you go a mother's love being projected to god this mother's love sin and i want to tell you friend because this just hit me the only reason i'm here today is because my mother's love that's the only reason i'm here today is because of my mother's love amen when i was worthless and in sin and wasn't worth saving my mother prayed for me right yeah my mother's love and my mother's prayer prayer prevailed before god and brought me to this to the place that i was to me right amen and i'm here today because of her yeah i miss her a lot this is a day i would be spending time talking to her on the phone right and i miss her greatly but i'm here because of her amen you look at these and as we read those stories and think about that i'm sorry if you do it maybe some of you didn't have a godly mother i don't know and and i'm sorry that you didn't but i'm so thankful i did amen maybe god knew that you would be able to come in even without the godly mother but god knew that i didn't have a chance unless i had a mother a godly mother praying for me amen amen i i've seen my mother prostrate before the lord i've seen her speak in tongues i've seen her raise and praise the lord i've i've seen her i've seen her sing songs till her she went hoarse my mother wrote over to 300 songs she one was her favorite the token but uh she sang and sang until she just couldn't sing anymore she loved to sing couldn't sing a lick she was like brother brandon just i mean you put a ten buckle on her head and it wouldn't sound any better but she loved to sing and i guarantee you one thing she might not have been able to touch hollywood but she touched the heart of god amen her voice might not have been something you'd put on records for to be sold by catholic or whatever but i guarantee you it's played today in the in the end of heaven yes praise the lord amen because of the godly mother i had i'll brag on her a little bit i love her she's here amen so i'm very thankful if you didn't maybe again maybe that was just god knew you'd be able to come in without one but he knew i wouldn't so he gave me a good godly mother and that's the reason i'm here today but a mother's love oh praise the lord a mother's love being projected to god and think about that i said just a moment brother moore i went down the baby was wadded up in some blankets i couldn't speak spanish to her neither could i understand hers but i just laid my hands on that little blanket that was wet because she'd been outside standing in the rain all day holding that baby her baby had died at 3 o'clock that day she went to the doctors and standing out in the rain for the service it was eight or nine o'clock that night she'd been standing there waiting with that dead baby in her arms blanket was wet now they tell me the baby had died about three o'clock i don't know couldn't say the dead people that i have written in my book is authentic that was raised by the lord from the dead the doctors would have to say so or the undertaker but laying hands on the baby something of course the baby let out a big kick under that cover and a scream that like you've never heard in your life what was it divine love had projected to the heart of god the love of god and sovereign grace sent back the vision for the healing for the child amen the woman got what she wanted she was persevering she stayed before the lord just like this woman that that jesus called a dog and wasn't enough ushers could hold that woman back the supernatural strength of this mother with her heart this dead baby wanting her wanted grace from god desiring and needing grace from god looking for god to have mercy on her child and a gift that was in a prophet to be able to show a vision and lay hands on that little baby to bring it back to life amen reminds me one time of uh uh of that story where this woman's out there and uh and and the congregation and and the lord speaks to her about this uh about this person that was uh in the prayer line to get healed by brother branham you thought well and god spoke to her and said go pray for her and and you know if you're standing and you know what we know and you're standing in line for the prophet of god to come pray for you or you come in the prayer line you're going to get prayed for by me and god speaks to you go pray for you probably think well uh why uh she's getting ready to be prayed by brother branham she's getting prayed to be praised by the prophet of god so why why should i go pray for god said pray for her and so she obeyed that voice and she went up lay hands on that lady said may i pray for you she said certainly sister she lay hands on her prayed for nothing happened it was the sky didn't open the the moon didn't fall uh there was no fireworks or nothing that's great things exploding all around she just went and sat back down this woman finally gets around she comes up to brother brown and brother branham holds her hand and she says sister you've already been healed she said there's no he said there's no need in prayer for you me because you're already healed she said god put on a heart of that sister sitting right back there and prayed for you right there you're healed right there go home and be well amen that was the end of it right because she had obeyed god to lay hands on her that that that and that's what moved the hand of god that healed that woman that that faith that brought her up and and surely she came all the way through but this gift on a man could tell that she was already prayed for that she was already healed because of the obedience of someone being able to stand before god and have the faith to believe that god was going to do what he promised he'd do amen now that's the same to any of us today friend he's the same god now as he was then he he didn't change his uh his god just because brother brown went off the scene he didn't die or go to sleep just because brother branham was saying we know that friend we've seen god move so powerfully here that that uh it's hard to describe sometimes right just the miracles the things that god's been doing for us and feeling his presence and knowing that he's real he's still the same today he's still a healer he's still a savior he's still a deliverer he still answers questions he still gives you deliverance and strength he still watches over you and leads you and guides you yes he's still the same right now as he has always been amen we just got to believe that now these mothers and that heart of my mother now that that faith shouldn't be exclusive to mothers but there's something special about it there's something special about that love and those prayers that go before god there's nobody can pray for a child that will equal right the prayer of a mother won't do it dad can pray for him absolutely we can come close sometimes but there's nothing that can touch that prayer of a mother it just can't do it right when it prevails before god and the true heart of that mother reaching to god it's not how good you can pray about it it's not how many times necessary you can pray but when your heart reaches to god for that child there's nothing prevails more than that does amen nothing it's just it's just the power of god that god put in her to be able to do president is something that god gave and that's that that spirit of female of woman now the world tries to muddle it all up of course with their what they call biology or whatever and men can be women and women can be men and men can even they're even talking about changing mother's day to birth person day birth people day because it's not just a woman you know you you know a man can give birth right didn't you know that oh it's silly anyway i don't want to get in that's just garbage but but still every day should be a mother's day but that mother this god put in her something special see and i think that's the reason the world combats it so hard it's because it's something that's godly something that's inherent and given to a mother that that no one else has and can't have won't have that baby lives under the mother's heart for nine months and that connection that grows and they're not just physically connected by the umbilical cord they're become spiritually connected together and there's nothing that can change that think about that think about that prayer think about that heart of a mother that stopped the jumbo jet in mid-flight and set it down in memphis tennessee you ever thought of that the prayer of a mother woman who probably couldn't even say her abc's little wash woman prayed to god and brought down a jumbo jet in the middle of its flight he meant safely of course it didn't crash we all know what i'm talking about yeah that time that brother brown was on that plane and that that colored woman was praying to god she considered herself in the scripture like that chinamite woman and she prayed to god and as she was praying to god a prophet of god was flying overhead and god said it's time for him to go across her path and he brought that plane down and they had to they had to land halfway in their trip he had to land that plane i believe it's memphis tennessee wasn't it land that plane there and everybody had to get off and brother brennan doesn't know what's going on you know people a lot of times today i'll say oh brother ralph knew everything no he didn't right he absolutely did not he was the prophet of god but he only knew what god showed him yes and sometimes it was only a step at a time because this prophet with his own testimony gets off the plane and god says walk with me he takes him down this road turn left he toads hurts left and god i'm gonna miss my plane i gotta get back on that plane to go where i'm supposed to be walk with me yes turns him this way turns him that way and he comes across that color woman standing at her gate the story picks up led by the spirit i was going along humming to myself and i noticed this old lady she looked across the gate great big smile across her face she got a great big smile across her face when her baby boys lay in the bed dying now i say baby boy he was six foot tall 180 pounds but that was her baby boy right always will be your baby boy amen regardless he could be 10 foot tall 400 pounds be her baby boy always amen sometimes that's a tough that's a tough thing too because the mother uh and i don't say this in a derogatory way but a mother's always a mother even when the children grow up and they leave home that mother's always the mother it don't matter how old they get it don't matter if they have a family of their own that mother is always a mother and it's hard sometimes for that mother to quit being mother amen sometimes it's hard for that mother to quit being mother because they're always going to be mother right but it comes a time when their mother that they're the ones that's to take care of their families and not the mother mother and it's hard to do sometimes yeah because she's always going to be a mother so maybe that's something for the mothers to understand grandmothers to understand maybe the daughters don't understand the fact is that sometimes it comes a time when the daughter's got to be the daughter and she's and then she's got to be the mother and she's got to be the mother of her family she's got to be the matriarch of her family amen and and and sometimes it's hard to let go right yeah amen but i mean the truth of it is uh as much as the as much as the dollars become like the mothers the sons become like the deaths but the dollars become like the the others the daughter's different than the mother that's right they're gonna do some things differently than the mother she's gonna do some things worse than the mother she's gonna do some things better than the mother but she's now the mother right amen sometimes i tell my wife here none of our business they're the mother it's their kids they're they're the parents see right and but i understand because that's the heart of that's the heart of a mother that's crying out it's still there we'll always be there so again daughters if you have mothers understand it's always going to be there right the heart of that mother is always good but she bugs me it drives me crazy but the heart is always going to be there be thankful of that be thankful but this woman now brother bam says she had a great big smile across her face i stopped humming and i started on by she said good morning parse i said how do you know auntie she just started grinding the great big tears rolling off those cheeks i said how did you know i was a parson now parson means minister she said i know you was coming now see god had showed her what was going to happen but god hadn't shown it to brother brown he showed he showed the woman praying that he was going to send her her elijah but he didn't show elijah he didn't show brother brown that he was going to send him over there all he knows is the plane had problems i had to land in memphis and god said go with me walk with me for a while he walks right in front of this woman's house and she sees him and said hello how did you know i was a person i knew you was coming i said how auntie how did you know i was coming she said well i'll tell you it was like this person she said did you ever read that story in the bible about the shunammite woman who the lord gave a baby by the promise of elijah the prophet gave her and i said oh sure i'm well acquainted with her story i just preached on it a few weeks ago well she said i was that kind of woman and i didn't have any children and and uh and the husband and i wanted a baby so bad and i prayed and the lord gave me this baby i told him i'd dedicate that baby to him and said i just wish i i was washed over the washboard person she said i was a wash woman in this district said i raised that boy the best of my knowledge to the love of the lord and sometimes that that's that's what you do right or not sometimes that's what you do raise it to the best of your ability because sometimes the love of a mother looks confusing sometimes the mother the love of a mother can look strict sometimes sometimes the love of a mother is corrected many times the love of a mother is misunderstood sometimes it's affectionate sometimes it's uh uh loving and compassionate but sometimes it's corrective because that mother has the responsibility of raising that child and the nurturing admonition of god right and that child starts straying off that path it's the mother's responsibility to get it back on that path yeah amen yes and if that and and and the bible says that there to train that child the way that you go that's her responsibility it's not her responsibility to plop that child down in front of a tv and expect that tv to raise them right it's that mother's responsibility to do it it's not the not the responsibility of all the rest of the world hollywood and everybody else to try to raise your child it's your responsibility to raise that child and that's the problem we have a lot of times today is they don't want to raise their children they'd rather have a dog or a cat or something raise them because the dog the cat well they're just going to do whatever whatever i tell them to do they won't fuss and fight back well if they don't then you don't have a child you don't have a baby you don't have a human with a soul with a free will right right right and then what have you got a bunch of mush a lot of times parents today just think their child should raise themselves yeah oh i'll when they're 10 or 12 they'll tell me if they're a boy or a girl i'll hogwash oh they'll tell me this no that that's that is so ungodly so demonic friends oh i want them to be whatever they want to be and do whatever they want to do oh that is wrong and a godly mother won't let that happen a godly mother will put that child on the right path and show them the way they're supposed to go by the scripture and how they're supposed to live that's a godly mother yes a godly mother is not going to say oh just go and do whatever you want to and live however you want no it doesn't work that way that's a mother that doesn't love that child right a mother that loves their child who will teach him right give him a little protoplasm stimulation once in a while even amen i still believe it's scripture yes it's very unpopular in the world today but it's still what the bible says amen you try to do it any other way friend it does not work that's right i prayed the lord gave me this baby i told him i dedicated to him said i want i'm a wash woman i'm a washed woman in this district i raised that boy the best knowledge the love is and the love of the lord she said he got out with the wrong company and taken a social disease and we and we didn't know nothing about no social disease and our boy got sicker and sicker finally we take him to the doctor he said there's no hope for him he's gone the venereal disease had got into his bloodstream and eaten up parts of his heart the venereal disease had eaten up parts of this boy's heart you imagine the stuff that's going on out there today the diseases and the afflictions well i like that song that zach saying he is our he is our shield amen i like that a lot of times we forget uh that he's our shield that he protects us right that he keeps us yes amen that's why i told you several times i pray god keep his heads around you right you may keep it from all the germs diseases the cove but all that mess he's a shield yes amen amen i believe that yes sir this neural disease had gotten eaten up parts of his heart and when the blood would pump up so much of it would drop back through the vows in his heart was eaten off by the disease dr uh doctor said there was no no chance for him he said he's lying there on the bed he's been unconscious for two days i can't stand to see my baby die like that and i prayed all last night lord you give me this baby where is my elijah amen again she considered herself like this unified woman lord you gave me the baby now where's my elijah right my baby's laying here dying where's my elijah and you notice friend and hasn't read that part yet and i don't remember if it's in this you know he tells a story 40 times and i don't know if it's even in this part of the story but this woman wasn't even necessarily caring that the lord would uh would take him right her concern wasn't that he was dying she was her concern was that he was dying a center and going to hell right that was her concern she wanted him saved yes yeah she wanted her voice saved to where she was where if he did go he would go to be with the lord that was her concern that's the greatest concern too right because that's what matters the most amen she said i prayed all night lord you gave me this baby now where's my elijah you can imagine how i felt brother brown says i thought lord is this it i never said a word to her about being led over there i said my name is branham did you ever hear of me said no sir i've never heard of you you didn't brother adam could have been an international minister which he was pray for the sick which he did many miracles and things happened which did she even care about that right that wasn't her concern she was just asking god for elijah god sent him and god showed her that who who was going to come and pray for her baby that he would be saved amen she no i never heard of you i said well how do you know how did you know i was coming she said i went to sleep about three o'clock this morning and i dreamed that i saw a man coming wearing a little tan suit with a little western hat struck over on one side of his head he had uh and had some letters in his hand and i said uh the lord said go out and wait for him at three o'clock in the morning the lord told her go out and wait for him so she went out to wait for him she said i've been standing here ever since brother vance says i patted her on the back and her back was wet with the dew that fell that's how long she'd been standing there waiting on her elijah kind of reminds you of the woman in here kind of reminds you the the mexican lady there wasn't enough deacons to hold her back amen she stood there from three o'clock in the morning he never says that i can remember may him in a different story what time it was that day but she had been standing there so long her clothes were wet from the from the dew that had been following us my it was true and i said well uh my ministry is praying for the sick hunting she wasn't interested in that she said won't you come in she opened up a little gate plow point hanging on the chain i walked into that little old hut that morning two little two room hut no no rug on the floor nor nothing little old poster bed cracks in the floor big enough the wind just swept through it he said i've been in king's palaces i've been i've had the privilege of being in some of the nicest homes i guess in the world but i never felt any more at home in all my life than i did in that little hut that morning amen god's not concerned about all the grandeur of life friends right a lot of times we hold it so close and dear and think about he wasn't concerned about that god's not concerned about that amen but the presence that was there the welcome that was there right he said greater than anything he's ever been in a look on the wall there was no pinups little model on the wall that said god bless our home little chunk stove set in the corner post bed leg fine looking big man laid there on that bed about 170 pounds six foot tall had a blanket in his hand it was going on oh oh it's dark he said i said what what's he saying she said parson he's been talking like that the past two days been unconscious said in his unconsciousness he thinks he's in a great sea somewhere lost in the dark he's pulling a boat trying to find land and i can't stand to see my baby die like that she went over and stroked his head kissed him on the cheek said god bless mommy's baby great big fellow like fellow like that dying in the shame of sin yet that that mother's love went to her baby praise the lord no matter how much disgrace he was how he had disgraced the family it was still the love of that mother that went out for her baby i think of that sometimes seeing a mother ever forget her suckling baby but god said how can i forget you your names are engraved in the palm of my hand so backslider tonight brother brandon says remember you can't get away from it he still loves you that's why you're here tonight he's trying to give you another chance knocking at your door i got down on the floor to pray she got down by my side uh uh got down by the side of his head and i got down to his feet i touched his feet and it seemed like it was cold sticky certainly death was on the boy i said auntie being that you are the mother of the boy won't you pray first she said certainly parson she bowed her head you talk about a prayer you could tell it wasn't learned in some school it come from the bottom of her heart speaking to god you could tell she had talked to him before amen she knew what she was speaking about and when she got through praying she wiped the tears from her eyes with her old apron looked over at me and said and he said i will pray now auntie i put my hands on his feet i said lord i don't know what to say is this why you made me miss my airplane to come down here to pray for this woman's boy if it is lord let it be let it be known that your god and your respect her prayers you'll respect her prayers and her sincerity and about that time that big fella said oh mama it's getting light in the room praise the lord the darkness gone away in a few minutes he was sitting on the side of the bed talking to us i rushed out quickly said get a cab to go the airport because you know he's worried about catching his flight right because the airplane had landed and he knew the plane was going to take off before he got back over there and he said so he got out of there quick and got an air a a cab to the airport i got to the gate and the last call for the plane was being made god had held that plane on the ground by faith by an ill uh a illiterate woman that probably don't know her abc's some poor colored woman ignorant as she would as we would call it and god grounded that plane and held it until her prayer was in the eye amen held that plane there now you think it's a big thing with a woman can't be held back by a bunch of ushers think about him holding back a how many times how much planes weigh how many tons does a plane weigh and yet this woman's prayer wasn't just a few deacons held a 10 ton 20 ton i don't know how much a plane weighs on the ground for a prophet to come and pray for her boy yes and her prayers he said kept that plane on the ground till he could get back on it and finish on the rest of his journey oh if we could just recognize him today that the power of the faith and of course tap into it if we can just as little bit as we can as briefly as we can to the power of that faith to the power of that uh of that humility and that love you remember the bible says in galatians that faith operates by love right amen so you can say you have all the faith in the world but if you don't have the love to operate it doesn't mean anything right you got to have the dynamics and the mechanics it's got to be the mechanics of faith but the diamond dynamics to love has got to work with it to make it work to make it accomplish what you're desiring for it to do you look at the love of that mother here who who didn't care that she was called a dog the love of a mother didn't care that there was a dozen ushers trying to hold her back i want love of a mother who didn't care if a plane was going through the air or that the man's name was william branham right she didn't care about that right she wanted her boy saved am i hey man brother brown said he went through memphis here not long after that and he ran across that boy he didn't recognize him but that man that boy recognized him said you make him you remember me parson he said no so i'm afraid i don't he said i was that boy that you prayed for in that bed he became a minister or a deacon or something the lord saved him and filled him with the holy spirit and amen the prayer of a mother amen friend if there's any doubt if there's any concern understand that that same god today is listening right it might not happen in the exact same way it might not have the time frame that you're thinking about it might happen not happening in the way that you hope it would but god will do it america this promise you do it it's the promise of his word amen it's the promise of his word hold to it i've had people that i've had tell me now don't get me wrong i i don't mean this bad and it's not from anybody that's in here so but oh well i hope they're at least foolish virgin i thought how could you say that about your child amen they may be adults they may be living in sin but how could you say that about your child not foolish virgin believe and pray and let that heart of that mother reach to god to bring that child to his deliverance to its to its liberty to his salvation right yeah true amen i i just believe that friend amen you just gotta hold on and have that kind of faith or just let it go and i know maybe that got to the point they just let it go but friend there's still breath there's still life there's still opportunity there's still chance god can do anything yes he can bring down a jumbo jet friend out of the sky harder on the ground yes what what can god not do right now don't ever think like that don't ever take that segue to go out and take them out to where they're not christians anymore or or or not bribe or or saved believe and hold on and let it happen amen it's believing it's true god can bring it to pass yes he can do anything he wants amen amen you know the story of solomon even the story of solomon that woman loved her child so much she was willing to let some other liar woman raise that child then have it cut into pieces remember the two women came to solomon this woman didn't have a baby come to solomon solomon judge probably one of the greatest stories the wisest man and people he still talk about today he said well i tell you what just cut the baby in half and give half to this woman and half of that woman and that one woman says yeah cut him in half i'll take half of him the other one says no no no no no don't cut him don't hurt him let her raise him it's okay and solomon says okay she's the real mother she's the real mother of that baby give the baby to her amen what wisdom friend but understanding is the heart of that mother that brought it to that point right it was just the wisdom of solomon using that love in that mother's heart to get that situation solved to realize who really was the mother of the child even even jocklebed she was she was willing to send her child out maybe to never see him again moses she was willing to let moses go out in the in the bull rush in the nile river and and no telling what might have happened to him she'd rather have it out there than know that the soldiers of pharaoh was coming to kill every one of them she was willing to live without him for the rest of her life if she could just know that her boy was okay right she stood there watched the daughter of pharaoh draw him out of the water she probably thought wow he's going to have a good life now going to be raised in the hollow halls of egypt by the by the daughter of the great pharaoh himself he'll have a good life now little did she know that they were going to bring find her and bring moses back to be nursed by her i mean that was just the best of both worlds then wasn't it but she didn't know that she just in her heart would rather live without her baby than to see him killed right right and that's what you have now of course the inspiration of god in in bringing that to pass and letting that happen the way it happened is a huge inspiration it's part of the story too but that mother she wanted her child to live she wanted her child happy and she'd rather even see him happy than dead right and so she took him and maybe didn't know she'd ever see him again but then god took him and brought him up of course we know the rest of the story but you see the example even into the animal kingdom right i'll close here shortly even into the animal kingdom i i wanted to read these couple of stories that brother branham told him and we'll close here but even in the animal kingdom yeah an animal who ha who doesn't have a soul but has a spirit but has something in it that god given to be mother to to to the female animals to be a mother amen and brother graham talked about the that you know in nature he would go hunting and uh he'd see the bears uh have babies the the babies would be born while the mother's hibernating and she'd wake up and they'd nurse on her and she'd wake up and then when the babies got old enough she'd run them off she brought them off time for you to go be your own bearer in your own life and she brought them off right he said but then if her birth the next year didn't take she'd go get up one or two of those clubs from last year she'd try to get them and scour them out and bring it back to herself and mother them again because it was just in her to be a mother right that's just what she did but you notice how when when they got old enough she'd run up she'd just go screw them off run them off time for you to go have your own families and be your own bears and then she'd go back and and become mother again he said he'd see then sometimes that their birthday their the consummation the uh didn't take effect and so she didn't have any babies and she'd go find the last year babies and start mothering them again amen remember about the possum that that that came up to brother brown's front door that woman that woman that that possum female possum drove herself all the way down that lane and all the way up to his door the woods is right across the street you've ever been there you said brother i'm sure brother cat probably been to on ewing lane brother brown's old house on ewing lane out of the woods is right across the street all that possibly thing that possum dragging it's her leg down gangrene or whatever's eating itself up the maggots and stuff drug that possum all the way down the street and those little nine babies sitting in her pouch protecting those babies the whole time yeah he said he and i believe it was uh leo and jean was standing there he's talking to him and he said now look leo gee that's the real mother right there protecting those babies in her dying condition yeah of course brother brown god sent her over there and brother barron eventually prayed for her and then possum got well and got up and left and ran on into the woods across the street where it was supposed to go but she is protecting her babies the whole time watching over them keeping them he tells about a story of this woman and threw a baby's baby into the river or something here not long before that he said that that that female possum was more of a mother than that woman that fit that a human woman throwing her baby in the river like that right that possum was more of a mother but one of my favorite stories one of my probably greatest that i enjoy the most was brother brown talking about uh his own hut and partner burt bert and i've told this story and read it several times over the years berg was brother branham's friend hunting partner brother brown talked about bert like he was just the low downing scoundrel lizard eye person everyone i mean deceiver uh cruel caught he called him cruel at heart yet brother brown went hunting with him right amen you know i don't know friends sometimes we just don't give people a chance that's right amen sometimes we just kick him to the curb before we actually try to witness to him or try to help him in some way but brother aaron tried to witness the birth over and over and over again tried to help lead burke to jesus christ but he wouldn't take it but look what happened and and and you talk about all this is brother randall oh this is the prophet of god this is all the miracles and all the souls that came in everything that happened his ministry and life and all but what brought bert to jesus christ behold the greater solomon uh greater than all of them is here in 1962. he said i thought we're fixing to separate they're out hunting because we getting up pretty high there's not much above the timberline so we sit down there and reach back like this and he brought out a little whistle i said oh bert don't do that he said them lizard eyes looking up at me just grin like i don't know what he put a little whistle in his mouth blew it and sounded just like a baby fawn you know how he kind of bugles for his mama when he did that just across the opening a great big doe stood up a dozen mother deer stood up i could see those big brown eyes looking around them a great big ear sticking up what was it she was a mother yes she was a mother and her baby had called he was in trouble she raised up daytime or no daytime danger or no danger she was a mother she was born a mother there's something in her like even a little girl playing with a little baby doll when she's a little girl what is it she's born to be a mother see it's in her it's by birth she wasn't a hypocrite she wasn't putting something on she was a mother bird looked at me with them lizard eyes looked up again i said don't do it bert he got down like that he blowed it real easy that mother deer walked right out into the clearing right out into the opening he said now that's very unusual especially for that time of day a white teal tail deer certainly been a lot of shooting going on they wouldn't do that i never seen anything like it in my life she walked out there right out in that opening he said we never carry a shell in the barrel you know until you're ready to shoot so i seen him take this 30 off 6 bullet put it in a big 108 grain mushroom up there he was a dead shot i've seen him level down like that and then lizard eyes looking through that scope do the crosshair when that bolt went down the deer heard the bolt and she turns and bolt makes a click when that bolt clicks in that bullet clicks in she heard that bolt come down and she turned them big ears pointed looking at us standing there behind the brush she saw the hunter but she was a mother her baby was in trouble death or no death she wanted to get her baby i seen that gun level down them quiet nerves of that fella i thought old bert how can you do it one minute from now you'll blow that loyal mother's heart right through her other side so close to he wasn't but about 30 yards away i thought oh my how could you do it bloomer uh blow her heart out like that distance to that big bullet i thought how can you kill that mother looking for her baby playing the part of a hypocrite didn't get her out in the open like that it was her displaying that she was a real mother die or not her child was in trouble i couldn't look at it i turned my head looked this way i said oh heavenly father don't let him do it don't let him do it lord oh how can he do it how can there be such uh how can he be so cruel as to cure that kill that deer like that how could he do that that poor mother there displaying that loyalty and love for her baby then he's going to kill her like that why don't let him do it lord i was just praying within my heart waiting to hear the gunfire at any time i thought as soon as it fires it's all over i was standing two or three feet from him when he knelt down by that snow drift bank right over the top of some brush there was a brush there was an opening in there last time i seen him he was holding his gun before he brother van turned his head he was holding his gun like that right at that deer quietness i never heard the gunfire i thought what's the matter i had my back turned like this because i just couldn't watch it i turned around and looked and the gun barrel was shaking like this he looked around tears rolling down his cheeks he took the gun and thrown it on the snow bank grabbed me by the pant leg and said billy i've had enough of it lead me to that jesus that you've been talking to me about amen amen there on that snow bank knelt down by the side there i took by took him by the hand led him to jesus he's a deacon in the church now what is it he saw something real something that wasn't put on a real mother's love that was calling for her baby a real mother's love that didn't care whether she live or died it was her baby she was concerned about it was her baby that she was thinking about amen and right there that lizard eyed bird with all the preaching all the witnessing with all that brother adam can ever do to help bert get to jesus christ it was done by here amen a deer that lizard i'd burp to jesus christ because he saw something that was real he didn't see something put on hypocrite you mean a lot of times that happens you go and i've had people tell me before i don't go to church called the hypocrites i said you're gonna let hypocrites send you to hell that doesn't sound like a good bargain to me amen but that's what people's had that just full of hypocrites well you know in some way we probably all are right in some maybe small my new way have you ever done said one thing and done something else that's hypocrite but it wasn't hypocrite she was just a mother it was just a mother's heart an animal someone that doesn't have a soul but a spirit an animal that was a mother and once so concerned about her baby she was willing to die for them amen this possum willing to die now can we just take a lesson can't wouldn't it be wonderful the world took lessons just from the animal kingdom right to have a little morals to have a little respect to have a little humility amen oh friend nothing like that that love of a mother that reaches out that touches the heart of god to understand we can take a lesson men the fathers all of us of the faith that can that that will reach and touch the heart of god nothing or do it like a mother's love amen nothing can do it like a mother's love as much as i could pray hold my kids before the lord which i do still do and all of you nothing like a mother's life there isn't and never will be because they're built that way that's the way god made it amen and there's something that goes out and and reaches god in a way that nothing else can i'm thankful for my godly mother amen if you've had a godly mother if you got an opportunity to thank her verbally today please do it if you have an opportunity to call her please do it if you have a a mother that isn't that wasn't necessarily a godly mother call her anyway yes and thank her for being your mother yes amen said well she wasn't much of a mother maybe she was maybe she did the best she could we don't know amen but thank him today amen i believe my mother's here and i thank her i wish i could call her i wish i could go see her talk to her verbally again but not on this side right i'll see her again amen but i thank god for and they seem to be becoming fewer and fewer but a good godly mother that'll raise their children in the nurture and admonition of god she won't let the world raise them she won't let some tv or some video game raise them she'll raise them herself yeah she'll bring in his heart friend if you're a mother i'm i'm i'm uh i'm out of place here but there's there's probably no harder job in the world and none with any greater responsibility than what a mother's shoulders just you said well it doesn't look like fixed and physically demanding there's so much pressure so much spiritual uh responsibility that falls on that mother because she really desires to see her children grow and and be raised in the nurture and admonition of god and wants to do what's right that's always there hardest job i thank god for my wife amen who raised our children and was a godly mother to them yes we were talking the other day and we said you know our children didn't always do everything right but i didn't ever always do everything right either neither did my wife i don't know that anybody always does everything right but we said we we took them to church when the doors were open our children were in church that's right we were there with them camp meetings tent meetings special revivals services virginia west virginia south carolina georgia florida north carolina wherever it was they were in church indoor outdoors amen indoor outdoor wherever it was sometimes we had service and there was no tent it was just in the middle of a field but they were there they were in church amen raised them that way amen church don't save them we know that amen but when you train a child the way that you go it will not depart from them right amen praise the lord god bless you mother love you all right before you leave today a

it's big it's clean and tables chairs and he said sure he didn't even charge us anything for it either thank you so much god bless you for that he said we all being good customers said you just have it and enjoy your time together so i appreciate him doing that and thank you for doing that for us so next sunday i'm catering in a meal that we're going to have next door uh we'll probably text

the the silverware and the plates and all those things uh i have people that are i plan to have them they're gonna come and set it up but then they're not going to serve so for us um so just calm as
