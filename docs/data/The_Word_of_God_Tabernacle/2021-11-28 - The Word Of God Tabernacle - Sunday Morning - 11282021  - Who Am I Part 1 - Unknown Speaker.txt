everything this vortex is swirling around us we can anchor ourselves in him amen knowing that we belong to him praise the lord amen listening this next course here amen it's number 621 amen if you're looking in the songbook or following along at home amen welcome streamer 621 he knew me and that's what they have in the book i think the actual name of it is when he was on the cross i was on his mind amen but 6 21 you know we'll just sing the chorus part this has verses to it but we'll just sing the chorus here that's in the book amen and worship the lord here aren't you thankfully knew you yes amen before the foundation of the world amen [Music] whose glory makes the heavens shine so unworthy [Music] of such [Music] when he was on the cross i was on his mind [Music] yes [Music] he whose

had hanging there amen in despair praise the lord we were on his mind amen listen one more before we go to the lord in prayer this morning number 591 amen song number 591 in the book if you'd like to get it out of the book amen i think i'll start with chorus here i don't sing this very often and it's a little different kind of a song to sing so he then helped me out this morning i know we all know it amen praise the lord who i who i am for who i am [Music] [Music] i can see now just it's a revelation of who i am o glorious speaking to me that day he set me free [Music] my life is [Music] and now i need [Music] to praise his name yes who i am who i am [Music] [Music] gave his laws the king of kings became my savior [Music] that christ and god might be made for hallelujah [Music] i can see [Music] his word it's a revelation it's predestination of who i am yes who i am lord who i am [Music] his words [Music] who i am amen hallelujah revelation praise the lord you know who you are this morning by his grace by his mercy by his blood yeah because i was on his mind amen if i was on his mind before the foundation of the world if i was part of him before the foundation of the world that didn't change because he went to calvary that didn't change because the flesh part of god died in calvary and shed his blood it's still the same today yes amen same then it's the same now praise hold it but it's a revelation amen it's predestination is a revelation praise the lord of who we are in him amen thank you jesus praise the lord we go to the lord in prayer now amen take prayer requests if anybody has any i have a couple i want to mention um remember the this morning brother shariah had texted me said art woke up early this morning and um about three o'clock and was throwing up so you want to remember art and prayer and also she said gaber wasn't feeling well so let's remember uh art and gabriel this morning the viastero's family also um i got a call kind of a surprise call but i got a call friday morning from brother dan suthert if anybody knows brother dan souther i don't really know him very well but i talked to him a couple years ago when we're over on cortero and um we talked for a while and he just had some struggles and some things he wanted to talk over i don't think he ever actually came to the church but talking to him on the phone he's a precious brother used to go to the tabernacle so so you remember brother dan okay praise the lord um well his son passed away friday morning oh snow he was in his 40s he was a police officer on the on the tpd a police force for 17 15 or 17 years i forget what it was now um he'd gone through the whole thing of being a police officer and being a first responder and uh you know servicing our community and uh here just recently caught cobit and uh they took him to that place on cortero and they didn't have any beds in any other hospitals and uh i don't know for him but it just didn't sound like they treated the man very well especially for someone who had given basically his life to service in this community in this uh this city uh they never put him in a regular hospital um but anyway the resulting uh fact is that he passed away friday morning so please remember brother dan and his wife in prayer if you would the passing of their son i just it kind of it's kind of getting on me again i'm trying not to let it but it kind of got all over me friday when i was talking to him and found out the whole details and everything it just it really bothered me uh there really should have been been no reason for this man to have passed away in my opinion but again as i say i'm not gonna i'm not gonna give credence to the devil i'm not gonna give place to the devil if he was a man of god and he was a son of god and it was his time to go i'm just believing the lord took him for a reason whatever that might be but the natural circumstances kind of make me upset uh i think they should treat you say i i i'm not showing respect for a person here friend and you know he deserved a better bet over someone else but you know when someone gives 15 17 years of their life uh protecting our community and servicing our community and first responder and uh you know they should find him a bed a hospital bed in tucson arizona for him to go to and get some treatment but uh sometimes their treatments aren't all that great anyway so but uh please the whole point though is please remember brother dan i know all of us except for maybe brother pat doesn't know him uh to know him but uh please pray for him his wife um uh he just called me said i don't know what i'm gonna do now and i said well brother we're here if you need anything at all if there's anything at all we can do please let us know he lives about two blocks from me and that son right there we went to school with my son lee and they graduated together and uh his wife is sister pat and she sat right in front of us at tucson tabernacle every week sometimes on the same road my mind two sister passed together but anyway he has a breathing problem and he can't go to church brother dan and he can't go to church va told me he had some issues and incontinence and things like that but his wife sister pat was always there in tucson tabernacle my mind let's please remember to make a wooden prayer i don't know if we'll see him here he asked where we were now so but uh just trust the lord would visit with them most of all amen he said they're supposed to have an honor guard for him and uh he's supposed to be interned at east lawn so uh if i get any details i'll certainly let you know about that i also got a prayer request from sister julie sees please continue to remember my sister in prayer may god give her the faith to fully receive her healing amen so christian's in need of prayer most of us know christian sister uh julie's sister let's remember her and pray the lord we just touch her give her a deliverance anyone else have a special request something on your heart this morning sister lady um we just found out that my mother-in-law has schoolwide she's 91 years old and she has been hospitalized basically the reason was because they have my sister-in-law has down syndrome they live in the same household so my sister-in-law that takes care of them decided to put my mother along or have them put her in the hospital away from the household and also my jennifer's almost sister-in-law has called it also her name is vanessa amen and my mother last name yes praise the lord let's remember that in prayer that devil's not going to quit but her parents had it and um yes sister judy's oxygen keeps dropping to lower levels so please remember her in prayer she's recovered from the coconut but just that lingering effects just remember her in prayer and also sister norma's great-granddaughter she had mentioned i'm not sure if you got it on streaming everybody heard that so uh her parents her great-granddaughter's parents had coveted uh now the the three-year-old daughter her great-granddaughter is feeling ill so let's just remember them in prayer of course if we would anyone else yes my daughter-in-law colette she has a culvert and she's pretty sick right amen but she's finally starting to accept some treatment though i heard correct and her parents brought her for her an oxygen tank because she couldn't breathe but she's at home amen okay praise the lord um her daughter-in-law colette had gotten coveted and that she didn't want to take anything or do anything so it got worse and worse but i i from what i know now she's starting to take hydroxychloroquine something for it she's taking it okay praise the lord so that's good uh sister matisse has sent me a long list of things yesterday but i'm like what i knew yesterday was she wasn't accepting any treatment so but thankful that she is but but on top of that we know what medicine does and god moves on doctors but uh he is our great physician so he is our apothecary he is our great physician he's our doctor he's our god he's our everything so amen we'll believe colette uh in prayer for colette amen anyone else the lord that's been a coveted morning i guess has a new variant out too or something the devil's changed his name again but uh i hear it's not as severe though and the symptoms aren't as severe but i'm still not worth it doesn't worry me amen god's i'm in his hands whatever his perfect will is i'm here amen god's going to take care of us you have an unspoken request on your heart amen god bless you good to be here today let's stand if we could and then ask brother dennis if you would take these needs to to the lord for us lord jesus we bow our hearts and heads together against jesus and of the faith knowing father that you're concerned of the needs of your own children and lord there has been a lot that's been expressed concerning different ones that are sick with covet we know that all sickness is of the devil yes of god yes and lord let us stand on your promises thank you let us stand on your word there's no reason why any of us should be defeated we are more than conquerors in the name of jesus christ for we know father there are several that really need a touch from you and father may you come on this scene as their great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and by your stripes we are healed it's a finished work you acquired for your children at calvary amen and we claim we stand on your word we stand on your promises thank you we are i'm not a defeated group of people but lord it's your life in us that gives us ability to be overcomers to be victorious in our walk with you lord you have come with a message to turn the hearts of your

wanted to let you know about that also sister the frajos sister genevieve i guess maybe priscilla passed them out but last week they passed out the cards for brother angel jr but she gave me a card

with such loving people god bless you sister genevieve frappo and the entire proposal so so give you those to let you know about that today amen praise the lord this thing is this uh song here that came on my heart yesterday uh i don't know if anybody in here knows it i'll stand for jesus it's kind of a kind of a a special congregation joining song it's kind of a song you sing more it's a special type but uh if you know what it's really easy the melodies most of the time i sing a song like this the melody's easy because i couldn't sing it normally otherwise so it kind of has to be an easy melody for me to catch on to it and sing it so it's kind of easy melody if you don't know it um we got the word so i'll start with the course here and we'll just go from there so i'll stand for jesus is [Music] [Music] the more that we have here on earth [Music] let the world go [Music] he [Music] just [Music] the only thing that's lasting comes from [Music] i'll stand for jesus to let the

less and less every day amen praise the lord anyone have a song now or testimony on your part amen yes sister teresa yes i have a son that's got away from the lord to the point where he wasn't even believing in the lord and um a couple of days ago he called he was crying and he got suicidal first and then that in those few days um he said he's now reading the bible and that's a big thing for me because honestly you know as a mother we pray and pray and pray yes and sometimes we feel like our prayers just get this evening yeah just hit the ceiling and come back amen and anyways for me it's a big deal and like at least that's a start yes amen praise the lord that's wonderful man well that just puts chills on me and hear that that's wonderful praise the lord amen amen i will put the words up for you mike it's got a song he wants to sing are you gonna use the soundtrack i'll be using that okay do you want this then yeah amen bless bless you this song was on my i lord heart last week i wasn't sure if it was what i was going to sing but it was just too strong in my heart this morning that i felt that i should sing so anyway i hope it's a blessing to you and if you know it feel free to sing along the words are always [Music] [Music] one day we gathered a handful of stones where the soldiers had fallen he waited alone with a prayer in a little rock the giant fell right on the spot yes well that's what david prayed for and that's what david got no you can't assume lodge of my god no you can't have too much of [Music] she had so many regrets so often she fell well jesus knew where she had been still he forgave her of her sins and her life began to flow living water for the soul no you can't ask too [Music] [Applause] when you're and you cannot find a peace of mind that

praise the lord seems to be the the theme of the hour amen praise the lord he's still the same yesterday today and forever yes praise the lord anyone else and then before we change your of the service now praise the lord last night i was at sprouts and i was got in my water and i wasn't ready to get in line i was just standing there and the checker was helping other people and and i was like 20 feet from her and all of a sudden she she says oh you need something and i said well i just got water and she said and and she was it's it's very she said well you have to get in line and it just didn't settle with me and i got angry and i just flared out and i said no i don't have to stand in line i mean there was an anger that came out and i and i went man i don't get angry i just don't and and that just flared out and i thought you know and it bothered me all night long and everything i woke up this morning and i i was still bothering me i was still angry and and i said lord what you know this is you know help me through this this this doesn't feel right and um the lord showed me you know uh that i you know we we don't always see people's intentions i felt that she was officious and and many other things and um and talking down to me and and so forth you know and you know i realized that's just the devil trying to upset my peace that's in the lord because i'm looking at things god's way and he's trying to get me to look at it satan's way and trying to get me to put thoughts that she might be thinking that she might be feeling and which is just a whole lot of nonsense and god just showed me you know that because i was making it all up i could for you know that i was accepting the devil's thoughts i could forgive her and i just you know and so i wrote her a letter because i complained to the head cashier and everything i mean i was i was wrong i was wrong and i just you know this song just really brought it out that you know he's you know that we you know we have to you know i'm just going to leave it at that we're just not all that we're we if we're not walking with god we're wrong and we're not walking in that peace in that peace we're wrong amen amen and we're still in these sticky flesh right yes and make mistakes and things we shouldn't do and say emotions flare up sometimes amen it's good when they calm down and they'll recognize it and the lord touches you amen you make it right did you just worship me or did you have to oh no i i just i have a testimony of what you said quite a while ago about you worked 117 degrees and you were with a pig outside and you said i did this in the name of the lord amen you don't know how much i changed my life sometimes i start complaining you know i'm doing housework i'm doing this and i'm running and i start thanking god and i said no i'm not going to complain thank you jesus i do this in the name of the lord jesus christ well that changes your attitude praise the lord changed mine at which i needed it but i give see sometimes god you all understand is it was a lesson to me first and then it turned into a message so uh a lot of times it comes to me first and corrects my spirit a lot of times and then it goes from there so trust me i understand it's it's easy i guess to have that when you're but i thank god i have the strength to do it yes amen thank god he gives me the ability and the strength and uh to be able to do it so praise the lord so in jesus name praise the lord amen we uh tried something a little bit different uh before we get to the word hero i meant to mention that we tried a little something a little different uh me and micah and zach had a little brainstorm last sunday night about trying to fix this uh streaming issue and uh because the the router is way over in the two-story building i'm sure i didn't ask where it is so uh for the signal even even though it was a better signal for it to go from the camera to the router back to his computer and then back up through the router to stream it out was just it just too far it's just too much and it just comes to the reality unless there's a router right here it just wasn't going to work like that so zach bought up a usb cable that we could run so when you see the cable here we just try to hardwire it so that way only his computer has to be attached to the router or has to have internet because then it comes from the the camera hardwired into there and then up so we don't have to we cut out one length of that and we tested it yesterday and it seemed to be doing better stride text me said there's a little static in the live feed so i'm not sure what that is but i'm going to get a an addition to that chord because that's not quite long enough to make it look a little bit better but so if you see the chord you understand we're just trying to hardwire it so we don't have hopefully correcting that issue so uh just pray for us we keep seeing whatever the lord shows us and helps us with to be able to do and fix it to make it work right and for those for some reason aren't able to come and need to stream or something uh the abilities there so i guess it's worked okay this morning loud audio is for making static so hopefully the stream is good so and and not hit copy and not that thing that was going through it i don't know if you ever watched or watched the re-watch the services and so we're just trying to get rid of all that so it's good and so when you see that you understand that's what we're doing that's what's going on so trusting this is going to work this works and praise the lord it'll be good amen so let's stand to our feet if we could uh we'll go into the scriptures now saint john chapter three and then saint john chapter 3 where we're going to begin our scripture reading miss brother tom sister karen you know i like seeing brother tom and with us and tommy and elizabeth in your family so remember thankful you've been thankful to have each one here this uh this morning i'm sure hopefully one day brother charlie will be able to come join us come praise the lord wonderful that'd be great amen first uh saint john excuse me saint john chapter three uh we'll begin reading with verse 13 but before we do can we just bow our heads for another word of prayer gracious heavenly father our precious lord jesus and we love and adore and worship and praise to give you thanks lord for all that you do for us and for being in our midst lord for watching over us every day for giving us the stability and the peace and the reassurance lord that you're always with us that you never leave us or forsake us yes and god you've called us lord once again today to this place expecting to meet with you once again father meet with you in the in the way god that you meet with us in this worship this place is this place of worship father it's been dedicated to you this your house lord yes god i pray that you would be pleased to be in here lord and with us today for the spirits is lord uh come and the songs sung and the worship lord we just pray that you receive it unto yourself lord as a sweet smelling savior yes and pray god that your holy spirit again lord will come and sweep through this place lord even as you did on the day of pentecost father will you fill all the house refill lord and anoint us lord with that fresh anointing once again and lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way as you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done take your word lord now and bring it forth fresh to us reveal it to us and help us see and hear what you'd have us to know to be encouragement and help to us along the way we thank you for those that have come those who are streaming today bless them exceedingly lord god bless remaining part of this service lord and speak to us now once again through these lips hear through the ears of your people as we give you glory and praise honor for all that is uh for all that is said and done in jesus christ's name amen amen amen saint john chapter 3 verse 13. and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god you could be seated if you like amen i want to take a little subject uh maybe for the next few services of who am i amen kind of goes along with the song that we had there who i am uh who am i it's something that people of the world christians even people who call themselves godly people people that say they're in the message people that say they're born again hop for on a daily basis to try to find who they are where they fit where they belong what their placement is why god put them here what is the reason for my existence and i i believe as a child of god that we come to the understanding of the point why we are here why god put us here the whole point of why god called us in this flesh and why god put us in this place uh it's uh it's a great question that that i think plagues a lot of people but i think for a christian there's a very simple explanation and that is that we are predestinated by god to be here god foreknew us here god predestinated that plan for us because he foreknew us that we would be in this place this time and the purpose that we would serve and the reason that we would have us here and what all any of us would do i've had several people uh come to me and tell me you know brother you i don't really know what i'm supposed to be doing i i don't really know why i'm here i don't really know what my calling is i don't really know uh what what gifts i might possess or what gifts fall uh in my purview or or that god has given me i i don't understand i just don't know i'm just not sure michael will you turn the hair down or not i see a lot of sweaters going on uh i just don't know and i've had a lot of people ask me that i've had a lot of people uh not sure and and misunderstood and misunderstanding and i think a lot of times the problem comes from people who don't know who they are to start with you've got to first know who you are before you can even start getting to the place that you're in that position of adoption if you will or that placement or your understanding of that placement who you are why you're here what purpose you're supposed to serve and what and what gift you have and it's amazing because sometimes the and of course a lot of the visions clouded by the devil and uh the devil's easy uh very good at being able to cloud all the vision of people that they don't realize and see in themselves what others sometimes see in them uh i've had people come and and ask me well you know i don't i don't know what what one of those gifts of the spirit that i that i possess that i'm supposed to manifest i've never spoken tongues or prophesied so on so forth and i said well brother i know that's real easy not calling a person's name or even the gift i said but from my perspective and knowing you like i have this is what god's called you to do this is exactly in the scripture but see he couldn't see it he didn't see it for himself he just thought well they just does this that the other and whatever along and it's just part of life no it's not it's a part of life because that's what god's called you to do it's a part of your life because that's what god's put in your life to do it's your life and that's who god is working himself through you to to fulfill this gift to operate this gift now it may not be something that's out in front or something that people notice or see or or something like that but it that's irrelevant in the economy of god it's irrelevant of the stature of the gift or the position of the gift or or if it's done in private or if it's done just in a secluded way or if it's out for the whole congregation to be a part of doesn't matter in the economy of god every bit of it is as important as the rest yes amen and i said you've got to take it at that yes and he started thinking about it and he started well you know that's i see that now if that makes sense i can understand that that that that would be a part of the gift and but he just threw it off as just just a way of life it's just it's just what i do well you do it because that's the holy ghost and you working through here to do it yes but it took that for him to understand that's what god was doing for him that was god the spirit of god working in his life and a lot of people miss that how easy it is the devil clouds the vision to work you just don't recognize it other people look and say well my i see that plane as dave but they can't see it themselves maybe i don't know humility modesty i don't know but they can't see it themselves but there's there's there's nothing that that comes in a person of christian's life that that that you say well you know i'm just i'm just humble about this gift or you know i'm just contrite about about this thing and the acknowledgement of it and uh you know i i this is the third church i've pastored i've been ministering over 33 years and it's still every time i hear the word pastor referencing to me is still strange it is uh it just is i but when god calls you to do something you do it right but it's something that's that that's out there to the point that it's understandable it's acknowledged it's recognized but it's still to me it's like it's just strange to hear sometimes i appreciate it and i thank god for it uh but it's all him yeah everybody it's all humans it's that none of us could do anything or be anything if it wasn't for him so that's the whole point but we acknowledge that and we thank god for it so the part of understanding who i am uh who am i lord who am i uh first of all we start with the fundamental foundation here in this scripture we find one of the most simple scriptures i probably is a as a good baptist growing up this is the first scripture i ever learned that i could pull from for from heart for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son the whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life that's the first scripture i can quote verbatim uh as a good baptist boy be able to uh quote that scripture but that scripture has now uh as an ornament has a lot of value to it that sometimes maybe me as a little baptist boy didn't understand and of course the scripture before that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life now there's a lot of messages you can get to about the condemnation and the darkness and the light of course and concerning with what's going on in the world today and people who would rather be in the darkness rather than the light you see most of the time when people go out to quote unquote party it's after it gets dark there's a reason for that people would rather be in the dark because their their evil deeds are exposed when they're in the light you know and sometimes that light to some people that light shines so bright they still can't see what's on the other side they still can't see because the light is so bright to them right but so they'd rather have the darkness the darkness the light exposes them but let's take uh uh for for sake of our our subject here the 15th verse whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life now let's start there eternal life what does it mean to have eternal life what is eternal life who has eternal life amen uh newton bennett does not have eternal life who does have eternal life who is eternal because there's only one that is eternal that is god me and you are not eternal not in ourselves you look at this this begotten son i i am not eternal but there's a part of me that's down on the inside that is eternal and that's the part of me who he is amen so to break down and understand the eternal part and to recognize there's a part of you forget about your flesh even your spirit down into the soul where there's an eternal part that never had a beginning and will never have an end that part that's of you is really who you are this is just a shell that we've been housed in to live upon this earth to fulfill the purpose of whatever god's called us to do in this life that's just all this shells for the spirit comes with it to give the body life and of course we got imagination constant affection reason memory that's the part of the spirit but the spirit's there to get the body of life so the thing that really matters is that part that's on the inside the eternal part to recognize what that eternal part is amen and that and that it is eternal that it never had a beginning and it never will have an end amen let's go to galatians now chapter four as we work on and examining that that eternal eternity being eternal a lot of a lot of tiny people get a misconception that they say i'm eternal but there's only one eternal that's god so the only way that you i'll just say you in reference because we're digging down deep into the soul of man now not your flesh spirit the only part that's eternal is that is is god's if you came from god and you're going back to god that's who you really are amen yes yes this is just a house amen put a name on it put a spirit in it it's just a house but that part that's really you came from god came out of god it's a part of god you can chop my pinky off and stick it on somebody else but it's still my pinky a person can get a heart transplant and take the heart out of a person who's dying and put it in someone who can use it but that heart's still mine it was my heart it becomes theirs they can use it for the time and period that's allotted for them but it was my heart amen this pinky will always be mine you can take it off and put it on somebody else but it's always mine right that that came from god is always god's god didn't take part of himself out of himself to be dismissed and done away with no it's if it's a part of him then it's a part of him now it will always be a part of him that's why we use the phrase came from god going back to god we don't go back to god just as a fellowship we go back to god because we're a part of god that part of god who we are amen not this begotten part but that part that was predestined before the foundation of the world galatians chapter 4 verse one now i'm i'm i'm gonna try to get to something a little bit later that a lot of people consider kind of controversial but uh it's a quote that brother branham made but uh i believe if you examine in the scripture which we're going to do and you place it properly where it belongs in the scripture it's absolutely the gospel of truth but now galatians 4 we're working to that point galatians 4 verse 1 now i say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed or that dispensation of the time that was set by the father amen even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world we were in bondage which means and the word were means that we are no longer under the bondage of the elements of the world you understand that what does that mean to you then when you talk about sickness or disease or afflictions or coping what does that mean it means i'm no longer bound under those elements those elements don't hold me captive no matter what it is those things of the world do no longer hold me captive they were things that held me in bondage they were things that kept me captive but no longer but when the time but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that he might receive the adoption of sons be placed put in the placement as a son now remember we went through well a whole year on adoption uh forgot how many parts over 30 parts a whole year on adoption we went through that adoption and the fundamental foundation of that adoption was to understand the adoption is not so much relationship as it is placement when we think of adoption in this world we think of relationship that person was somebody else's they died or gave up their child and so i accept that child's as an adoptive process to become my child thus it becomes relationship they're now my son or daughter they no longer are their son or daughter they're my son or daughter that's relationship amen now there's a placement to it because of the placement of them used to be uh a jones and now they're a smith now that's a placement that's not relationship that's placement now because you were this but now you're that you were smith now you're jones that's placement but your jones as in relationship to son or daughter or sister or brother or niece or nephew whatever it is that's relationship but in the economy of god it's about placement not relationship there's not a question to whether or not you are a son or daughter of god that's not the question never was the question because if you ever are or ever going to be a son or daughter of god you always work right now you never we're not it's just like the prodigal son when the prodigal son came back and the father threw a feast and the other brother got mad because the other brother's like well wait dad i've been here this whole time i've served you faithfully i've done this i've done that and he said why are you so mad the half of your my kingdom is yours my kingdom belongs to you what are you mad about but you gotta understand son that your brother has come home he was lost he was out in the world he was dying with no hope but now he's come back home and i received him into my home why because he's my son when he left me when he was in the world when his face was smacked down in the middle of the pig trough he was still my son he was never not a son pardon the double negative but he was never not a son he was always a son he didn't stop being a son at any point in time from birth till now he's always been always will be amen amen he's the son that's the same thing for us if we're a son if we're a daughter we always work we never became we just always work but when we're children we sit under tutors governors you know we go about our lives and do our things and live our lives but when the time came when the fullness of that dispensation of your life came and that fullness reached this ebb it came to a place to where you recognized who you really were and that word and that voice spoke to you and you recognized it and you received it and you accepted it as your own amen amen that's your recognition that hey i i belong to this family you know there was a time when you're born you don't realize i didn't realize when i was born i was a bennett how did you know that i had no idea i was just a baby goo gaga give me some more milk that's all i knew you know when you're a little child that's that's all they do they they drink milk and they poop that's that's their whole kid's life they eat poop eat that's all they do yeah i didn't know it was a bennett but there came a time in my relationship with my family that i recognized who my mama and daddy were right i knew it on the inside because of the nurturing that they gave me but i didn't realize i belonged to the bennett family i didn't know that but when it came a time when that dispensation reached its end its fullness i recognized i'm abundant i recognize that when the spirit world friend you reach the same place you come to the place you walk out the world you do all these things but there finally comes to that place i mean it's almost like a child having a woman having a child you're going along and everything's okay and all of a sudden bam i've never had a child but i have a wife who's had three and i know what that time is like well we only had two times like that where it comes bam you just you're laying in bed or you're eating dinner you're you're just living your life and all of a sudden baby it's here got to go to the hospital are you sure we're going to the hospital okay well let me take a shower no we're going now we're going to the hospital it's like that yeah understand it it hits it's just like that you think you've hit your life and you've gone along and you might have even had an alcoholic beverage in your hand or or in the you might have been pulling on the uh that one armed devil but it come to you and you pulling yourself wait i don't belong here amen this is not who i am this is not what i've put on this earth for right and you recognize who you are i don't belong here i don't belong to this one i don't belong to that one you even come to realization even though i am abundant i'm a child of god first i belong in the economy in the family of god first that's my true inheritance my real true inheritance was i am a a part of the family of god that's who i am that's who my that's what my life is and it comes to that realization bam now you might not have said well i got to go to the hospital right this second sometimes people might start reading their bible again amen they might go to church again or something or they might just just some little thing a lot of times it was because of someone how someone was raised but maybe not but it it it hits you in a way where you know there's just at that point there's no turning back there there's there's no going back and from that point you know and and there's and that's what you are and who you are from that point forward and then you just get deeper and deeper and more and more and you grow and you grow you get into the lord and you realize that there's so much more to this amen than just just uh coming to church or or filling up the seat on a on a pew or something you you recognize who you are who god has made you why he put you here and what the real meaning behind you is the real meaning i mean brother brother said god would bankrupt heaven for one of his children you ever think of that right you think of the fact that banker how could you bankrupt heaven first of all you couldn't so that just puts the magnitude of it he talked about the soul being more 10 million worlds what's the value of 10 million worlds how could you even invite you that right i imagine somebody was smart other than me uh or outside of me could probably figure that out on what the wealth of the world is today and do 10 million of them i don't know but could you imagine just that to recognize one person you you amen are that one that god promised that god that god chose that god said i would do this for you all right you're my son you're my daughter you belong to me now i want you to understand the relationship of son and daughter is our relationship with god here just like our relationship as bride and feminist spirit is our relationship to christ here here amen and it will be uh as time goes on and and as time even ends through the white throne judgment that but there will be a time frame where because the the real relationship of you to god is the fact that you are god that's the real relationship because that's who you really are the son and daughter part is just because of this i'm a begotten son well the son that's begotten had a beginning well if a son has begotten had a beginning a son this begotten will have an end right amen amen well then what's the real relationship we have to god we are god yes that that's that part of us who we are now again we're living in the sticky flesh and the relationship we have the sons and daughters and this flesh spirit and that we live in life that's all a part of what we go through here as god had commissioned and called for us to do from the time that he spoke adam into existence and we're here at this time and would have been gone through that as as as spoken word beings if there hadn't been a fall in the garden of eden that's how we would have been as god spoke that and put man in flesh to have fellowship like that amen god just took part of himself and put it in adam just like god took a part of himself and put it in you right now that part of god who you are is the real relationship you have to god and and that eternal part of who god is is who you are praise the lord amen that's who i am well no wonder if god said a brother and said god would bankrupt heaven for one of you that's himself and paul said no man hateth his own flesh right well no god god has never hated himself amen and that's who he's put in each one of us right himself let me finish this when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman and made it in law to redeem them that were under the law that he might receive the adoption of sons now that placement to receive that placement as a son even jesus the flesh of god said okay the flesh of god jesus amen was a begotten son amen it's what the bible says he was the only begotten son but he received a position of placement when he got older he grew up amen when he was 12 years old he was in the in the temple confounding the professors and the smart ones and the ones that knew the torah better than anybody he was compounding them at twelve but he got to the place that he reached his his place of maturity in the word which sounds strange because he was the word and when he reached that place and his ministry began and his his real ministry began that's when people started hating him they marveled at him as a 12 year old boy they didn't hate him but when he started getting up and driving them out of the temple with the ropes and all that's when they unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you they they hated it they didn't want him but because he he came contrary not to the word but to their traditions and they hated it not because he came contrary to the word even though they accused him of that he came contrary to their traditions and that's why they hated it but when he came to that place as an adoptive son his position and he took that position right he lived in that position when they hung him on on the cross at calvary he could have called 12 legions of angels to come and rescue him and pull him off of that cross he could have stopped it at any time he could have foiled it he could have told pilate he could there was you read through the story of the passion and you'll see how many times or watch that movie you can if you in your mind envision the power of god how many times he could have circumvented this crucifixion he could have stopped it or ended it right there right even to where him saying that could call 12 legions of angels and they would come right now and rescue me and pull me away from this but he had a position he had a placement he had a a job he had to fulfill he was an adoptive son and as his adoption his placement it put him on calvary and he knew it but he and and accepted it when his sweat became his drops of blood when he cried lord if this cup could pass for me but he said not not my will but i will be done what was he talking about he was talking about the adopted sun part but the placement the adoption press forward through his life to fulfill the purpose that he was here for right amen amen even if it meant putting him in the most cruel depth on the most cruel place which is a tree the cross the most cruel death agonizing shame pain all he went through he did that because of that placement that was a part of his adoption was to fulfill that purpose right just like a part of our adoption is to fulfill the purpose that god has called us to whatever it is you have to know what yours is we all do yes that that he received we receive as sons and daughters we receive it as sons and daughters because remember only the son and daughter is the one that's adopted that the one that shows their placement i mean i when i was when i was well i was going to say when i was growing up but uh when i was growing up neighbors did with other parents kids with their permission by the way if they did something wrong can't do that now goodness you can't even hardly anyway we'll we'll get past that but i don't go to uh my neighbor and say okay i think your son should do this this and this this is what it should be this is how he should act this is where he should go this is that's not my business it's not my job because he's not my son but if we're his son it's his place for our position to be adopted in what way he wants us to go yes whatever that is as sons and daughters you don't adoptives and not sons and daughters you don't place a niece or nephew amen you don't place grandchildren it's not my position to place those two children it's his parents amen not mine it's theirs right just like it's god's for us it's his position it's his place to do that so you have to be a son or daughter to be placed to be adopted you must already be a son or daughter that's what jesus was when he reached that fullness of that dispensation that fullness of time he was made to redeem them that were under the law how did he do it through his adoption process which included going to calvary shedding his blood sixth verse now i like this now sixth verse and because ye are sons and i stop past tense that's not future tense that is present tense you are sons amen because you are a son because you are a daughter can you believe that this morning i am a son of god amos amen i i love this song the gaither scene i'm just a sinner saved by grace you know that song i'm just a sinner saved by grace you ever heard that song yes i really i enjoyed the song i like it has a good melody to it i always like the melody songs right but i like the song but it really is not scripturally accurate when you dig it out because actually i'm way more than just a sinner say my grace the song and this and it's accuracy i'm just a oh not really i'm i'm way more actually than just a sinner saved by grace what's in me possesses all of heaven and earth because it's god right but because you are sons because you are i am you are right now sons will say of course that that includes humanity god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying father father have thy father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ praise the lord now we're heirs family family you know i'm a son to my parents but i'm a i'm a brother to my sister i'm not a son to my sister i'm a brother i i'm a nephew to my to my uncle even if even if by marriage i'm not a son to robert my my uncle i'm a nephew do you understand or brother-in-law excuse me my brother-in-law i but i'm not a son see the placement has to be true and it's just a natural typing the spiritual because it's the same thing where god put us here we're no more servants but we're a son if we're something where a son we're heirs of god through christ we're family heirs of god through christ because christ he had to come to his place of adoption as well just like all the rest of us when jesus came to his adoption on the on the mount transfiguration well let's just read it man let's go to matthew 17. matthew chapter 17. i told you it's gonna be two or three parts whatever anyway so i'll never finish this today but matthew 17 verse 1 oh my you know there's there's a lot of power in in understanding in in the revelation of who you are you understand it takes knowing who you are i mean who you really are it takes away all the doubt yes it takes away all the fear it takes away any disillusionment or any worry you don't worry and doubt about the human part of us the spirit part of us our imagination and our reasoning those things they bring doubt and worry but the real part of that we recognize who we are there's no doubt about that there's no worry over it because we are that part of god who we placed in us and if we understand that and who we are in that how can we worry what is there to worry about who is there to worry for understand that they're mine they belong to me they're they're part of my inheritance they don't belong to the devil they don't belong to the world they belong to me now i mean i might have had a squatter right on them for a little bit but they belong to me amen they belong to god yes so what's there to worry about we don't can't worry because we belong to him yeah matthew 17 1 after six days jesus uh taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth him up into a high mountain apart was transfigured before them his face did shine as the sun as raiment was white as the light behold there appeared unto mo unto them moses and elijah talking to with them then answered peter said unto uh unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee one for moses one for alliance now notice peter was a big mouth was not converted yet god used that wonderful big mouth after he was converted to save thousands of souls but he wasn't at this point so he i say he spoke out of turn he said why why would you say that peter spoke out of turn here brother you that i mean that's good it was i'm sure they felt yeah it was good for us to be here that's wonderful but i i would say he spoke out of turn during this unbelievably momentous occasion which he did not understand obviously peter james and john didn't know what was going on right even after it was over after it was converted i believe so i didn't understand what was going on here see but he made this acknowledgment oh lord it's good for us to be here let's make a tabernacle for each of the three of them but the reason i say he spoke out of turn when he really should have been quiet was that jesus never acknowledged him now you read the story of it jesus never acknowledges peter about this he never answers him he never gives any credence to anything peter just said it was just as though it was it was his it kept the end the entire adoption process kept flowing forward as if peter had never said that you read it let's let's read it moses won for life while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him it was this if though peter didn't you say anything it wasn't even acknowledged at all ignored so that that's my premise of that in this sacred situation that we're going through here but but jesus but but god is is coming down in that great light and and speaking out to the witnesses that were there remember that establishing two or three witnesses three of course being perfection peter james and john there witnessing the adoption of jesus and the voice of god crying out this is my beloved son hear ye him amen that's a transfer that's like a man who built and owns a company coming before his board of uh uh of of investors or advisors or whoever they are coming before his board and saying this is my son he has done everything he was required to do he is more than adequate and able to take over this company hear him in other words not me him go to him now this ain't mary mary's not the media tricks here god didn't god didn't say go to mary he said go to christ jesus this is my son hear him amen oh yeah the company's still intact the company's gonna run just like he had been running but now he's running it all that power all that authority is now in him that was his position that was his place that's why we go to him yet today for that very reason because he is our intermediate he is our intercessor like we said he is our our physician he's our uh alpha omega he's everything jesus all that all that was in god he poured into christ amen and he and in the adoption process he says now hear him he's reached that fullness of that place the fullness of that dispensation of him learning the business learning the company learning the people learning everything he needs to know to run this company exactly the way i did is now his place amen hear him yes praise the lord that was his place the position that god gave hear him now he is in that place that we are to listen that we are to follow that we are to obey because he was the one that was given as the only begotten son to take away the sin of the world to take away our sin to take our sin upon himself and annihilate it with the blood he shed at california that was his position that was his placement as an eternal son amen now let's get to one part before we close one other part i wanted to get to first john chapter 3. first john chapter 3 verse 1. praise the lord god it's revelation amen who i am this predestination of who i am why because it was well in our human language we can only speak on beginnings we use the word eternity a lot or never had a beginning but in our in our vernacular so many times we say in the beginning but in god there was no beginning he just always was and i i'll as i've told you before i'd be just as perfectly blunt and honest with you i still can't fathom that i i still can't because my insufficient little p brain can absolutely not reach back beyond where there was ever a beginning i told you when i was when i was a young boy i used to ask my god my dad i said where did god come from well he said the bible says god come from team i said what's timo where was it how did it begin how was there a start there and of course you can't answer that question nobody can answer that question all you can say is he's the great elohim always was always will be he's the self-existing god he just always was everything we deal with and everything we look at and everything in our human life it had a beginning it has a start to it but they had to start it's going to have an end so you got to reach eternity somewhere and how can you do it because of him he's eternal only way to do it now chapter 3 first john chapter 3 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called amen the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not now notice how this adopted process is playing out through this scripture that john wrote here he said we should be called the sons of god acknowledged as a son of god therefore what the world knoweth us not because it knew him not who him christ what was the reference now the reference was our sonship is relative to this world just like christ sonship was relative to this world he said because therefore the world knoweth us not so the sonship of being called the son of god is relative to the world and our relationship amen of him here in that adoptive process is is here now in this world i've heard people say well they they look to be adopted when they when they go on the other side friend you're missing the whole point what what would be the point of finding a place of adoption over there right the whole point is finding our place here yeah and knowing what god wants us to do here and now right it's no wonder it's no wonder that people come so many times my it just it just seems to get more rampant all the time that people come to the place that they feel like the unknown is a better solution than what they have in this life because most people don't know they kill themselves they don't know what they're doing where they're going what's going to happen but they'd rather take their chances with the unknown through suicide than what they have here right that's that that's just so sad especially in relation to what we're talking about in that placement what's the point of being placed over there the point of the sonship that we are in relation to god is now our adoption is now what god wants to use us for and do for us and through us is now not over there so this world our son our our placement as sons of god is known to the world but they don't know you as that the world doesn't the cosmos doesn't beloved now i like this it goes with galatians 4 again see now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear or that word is manifest or made known to uncover appear it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that had this hope in him purified himself even as he is pure wherefore uh whosoever committed sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin now you know me i don't i'm not somebody to change the word but to make it a little better perspective for you let's read it like this and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins because there is no sin in him amen amen and in him is no sin the conjunction and just doesn't do it for me there it should be because he is sinless he could take away my sin yes if he was not sinless he could not take my sin away if he had not been sinless he could not have taken the book he could not have been the one that john was whipping and looked and said behold the line of the tribe of judah he couldn't have done it he couldn't take our sin unless he himself was sinless that's the only way he could do it that's why we can't take away sin i can't take your sin away right because i have sins of my own i'm a sinner too that's why john couldn't even touch or love from the book it was forbidden for john to look on the book you think might and jesus said no greater man is born of a woman than john but yet he couldn't even look on the book oh no wonder there was a lot of crying going on you figured humanity is lost at that point because if john greatest man this jesus said more to a woman couldn't even look at the book then what hope did any of us have that's why christ had to step forth as the sinless one a bloody lamb amen step forth to take that book because he was worthy because he was sinless yes amen oh thank god for that whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you that he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil that's pretty rough he that committed sin is of the devil you gotta understand what he's talking about here for the devil said it from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil which is what sin which is what unbelief amen to destroy unbelief right well that just goes right back to our saint john chapter 3 reading the whosoever believeth in him should not perish now it takes more than let's service too because people say oh i believe in jesus others atheists say well i believe jesus existed sure i believe he was born and muslims will tell you that hebrews will tell you oh yeah there was a jesus oh yeah i believe there was a jesus the devil believes in jesus but is he saved no no no no believeth in is a revelation that you've accepted into your heart that says this is who he is not just that he existed not just that he was on this planet at some point in time i believe and know who he is the process of of him being god built in flesh and i receive him to myself that believeth has to be a reception if it's just simply all i believe he existed the devil does too but the satan doesn't receive him unto himself as his savior as his lord he that come eighth verse he committed sin is of the devil the devil sentenced from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because why he's born of god where's the birth take place the birth doesn't take place out here i've already been born out here i mean nicodemus even came and asked jesus how could i enter my mother's womb the second time because he had he lacked revelation of what it meant to be born again but what does it mean to be born again born in spirit praise the lord it's got to be something that takes coun that takes place on the inside of the inside of you yes amen because the spirit's not the one that gets reborn the flesh is not the one that gets reborn so where does the birth take place it has to take place in the soul amen now i i i've decided whether or not to because it's getting so late to go ahead and do this but i'll leave this because this is something that you all know that i do uh fairly often but you see the body the tron being spirit and the soul is is the triunity of our being so what of it what is this that gets born because see when he says here because he is born of god i wasn't it it doesn't say because he was born of george and jared bennett that's this guy he said he was born of god that has to be this guy yes a rebirth a renewing or a part of god which was that seed that recognized and came to life and now the resident of your soul is god your soul is god from this seed because that seed had to come forth to life that's why it said whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed whose seed the seed of god amen remaining now that remains doesn't mean god put it there when you recognize i i uh micah's got a song on his phone he puts micah's got a lot of songs on his phone but there's the one where this is uh this black sister she's she's uh uh quite happy and she's singing this song about you ought to have been there when he saved my soul y'all have been there when he put my name on the roll well friend if your name is on the roll it was put on there before the foundation of the world not when you come to the altar not when you danced in the spirit not when you manifested a gift of tongues or prophecy or something but before the foundation of the world your soul was there amen that's where you were put on there that's where you were born because that's who you really are that's who we really are from before the foundation of the world and god put that seed in there and the bible says that seed remaineth it's still there but what does that seed do that seed just come to life it come to recognize look at this i was gonna read a couple quotes but i'm gonna i'm gonna skip them for maybe next time but look the seed this this word seed this is in first john 3 9 this c says from which a plant germinates the grain listen this close this is i i enjoyed this the grain or kernel which contains within itself contains within itself the germ of the future plant so when god put this seed in you by four knowledge predestination when god put that seed in you oh that time i came forth i was issued out of jeretta bennett that seeds there amen breath of life the seed is there predestinated part of god that's why people say what where what happens to babies were they predestinated if they're predestinated of god they're part of god they'll be there they're god of course all babies go to heaven we know that but as far as the rapture and predestination but that seed was always there there he comes there's that seed it remains there because that's who you really are when you are in the mind of god that's who you really are god just took from himself figure how you want to i mean it's the penny or the pinkie or the harder so figure out how you want to but god took a part of himself and put it in you and took that seed and put it in you now that scene you could take a male and you could uh you could go do an operation you could take seed out of a male and you could take a seat and you could put that and they do it um what do they call it in vitro in vitro fertilization that's what they call it i don't know how many getting that terminology wrong but they take the end of the woman in the seat of the mouth they put them together in a little dish or something they make a baby right well that's a seed well that seed has in itself the germ of the future plant of the future what you were going to be you were born in this body in this spirit as as son and daughter as brother brown said a son or daughter of uh charles and elle branham i was born a son or daughter a son i was born a son of a of george and jeretta bennett but that seed that was in there was who i am not this guy amen amen i believe that's probably why we get a new name on the other side too amen not that i'm not fond of newton it's okay george is fine too i like those it'll work for me amen but in that is the germ it's the germ of what the future you is going to be or is not going to be is now it stays dormant until that time of dispensation when you recognize that's when that spirit comes that's why the new birth takes place because the spirit comes in there and gives life to that seed and then the seed begins to germinate and grow what does it produce it doesn't produce an apple tree it doesn't produce another human earthly being it produces what the seed came from my seed produced another little mutant we call it mica but that's what it produced what does god see going to produce god she's going to produce another do i have to say it amen what is god seeing going to produce god that's why god is in you to live through this spirit through this body to show this world that he's still the same today as he has always been yes because he's living through you to do it yes that seed come to life through the new birth now now this body and this spirit are still sticky they're they're still get a little rowed sometimes or say something they shouldn't or a little anger a little spirit or something of this world and and and the layout all the seeing things that's going on around us but then it won't take long in that spirit that that that life that's in there comes forth to that spirit said no no you're not supposed to do that don't act that way don't talk that way don't be like that don't look at that don't listen to that and then it affects that body and that body says amen that's right i belong to god i don't belong to this world those things don't attract me anymore amen and then and then you and then you are who you are see but where does that take place it takes place here that mistake that failure that fault that that that shortcoming that that you might manifest it's not down in here it's here it's in this spirit it's in this body that's where it happens through your imagination and reason memory oh my goodness memory i i when i was a kid i listened to rock and roll loved rock and roll of course now it's called classic man you want to think you're old the music used to list you and your kid are now called classic i saw a car tag the other day that said classic on it and it was like from the 80s oh man if that doesn't make a person feel old 1980 that's not classic well it is now might not used to be but it is now but i used to listen and that and you go in a restaurant or somewhere and a song comes on you used to love or something oh that that that memory come back in your spirit and your toe be tapping and your lips will be moving before you realize it because it's that memory is affecting that body that body's starting to react but then you got to allow that freeway of that that that holy spirit that life that's in there to come forth to to break that up amen and to dismiss that even if the song's over you say you know and then you come but where does that take place the point is it doesn't take place here that's why the bible says whosoever is born of god does not commit sin right he said well i just made a mistake this morning i just did something wrong this morning i just but it's not here it's over here right it's in your body that made a mistake it wasn't something that came forth from your soul remember ephesians 2 said that we had the desire to sin amen when we were in the world our desire was to sin our desire from our heart from our soul was to sin was to do things wrong because of the darkness that we were born in satan was the original the uh uh original resident darkness but then when that when that seed came to life and the holy spirit come and burn that old nature out and that and then fertilize that seed now he that is born of god born of god cannot sin where here there's no more desire for sin there's no more wanting it there's no more desire for it all the desires have been taken away because you've been born again what happens here is just the things that come in your c tasteful smell here your imagination concentration affection memory that comes into these two elements that's when that then that's when a mistake can be made because you uh your reasoning is that shouldn't have been that way and then your conscience comes and says that's right and then your affection which affection isn't just loving affection is uh um your emotions which contains anger which makes you mad and then your affection comes and says that's right that makes me mad and then maybe based on that uh when they're that spirit bristles up then you do something you shouldn't do amen but the sin didn't commit the sin didn't come from here can no longer if you're born of god you can no longer sin amen you you've lost the consciousness of sin the desire of sin once we were dead in our sins now we're dead to our sins praise the lord because that nature has been burned out and all that all that all that lives there now remember brother brown i know i'm getting laid brother branham typed that to that old railroad car remember bella ram said when on on the railroad car when you pack those real low cars right you have to close that door and if it's done right the inspector comes by and he puts a seal on that door and that door cannot be opened until it gets to his final destination now brother branham reference that to to you receiving the holy ghost and the new birth the word when thy spirit comes in there and that life is dermatized that door is shut satan has no more right to that soul he can no longer get in there yes amen and then that is the nature of the spirits the nature of the body that affects all of you and who you are amen let's stand if we could praise the lord i didn't even get a chance to get to the quote i wanted to read amen lord willing uh lord willing terry's maybe next week we'll see amen but lord knows whatever his will is we'll just do the best we can for him amen praise the lord realize who am i who am i then it becomes who i am the question to start with is who am i the question afterwards becomes or the statement afterwards becomes who i am that's not a question anymore amen that's a statement who i am who i am who am i i'm a child of god amen who am i really i'm the attribute of his seed not in this flesh the part you can't see brother said if the flesh would fall off this body right now all you'd see is god standing in front of you well he didn't exclude that to himself because it wasn't just him he was a child of god just like the rest of us born again filled with the spirit of god just like the rest of us germantis see the soul of god as just just like the rest of us the whole point he was trying to make is that look if that's the same thing as the statement i'm making it's the same thing for you we just got to believe it you know the thing that bothers us the most is this sticky flesh amen it gets us the devil uses it all the time you know he does he uses against us all the time you know you don't belong there you know you're not one of them you know you're not you know you're not you know just say that devil just like you do the other get behind me satan amen that's contrary to the word you know say jesus told peter that not because peter was a devil but because the statement he just made was against the word you know that's why peter jesus told peter that get thee behind me satan because what he was saying was contrary to the scripture that devil that was influencing that statement was contrary to the word you know why he drove them out of the temple with the with the platted ropes because it was contrary to the word that's why he did it he wasn't mean amen the bible says he looked on them with anger well what part of him looked on him with anger his body his flesh but it was the righteous anger of god contrary to the word uh that they were doing contrary to the word that drove them out of there because what they were doing was against the word right amen amen praise the lord let's stand on that word amen praise the lord stand on what he's given us done for us yes praise the lord in this hour amen i'm so thankful that god's given it to us amen i want to sing this song again sometimes you know why i do kind of like brother branham says and i see lord in my spirit i'm thinking lord what do you want us to sing what is what
