[30:46] together in unity Lord I can recall h a
[30:51] time that I just read in in your word

[31:01] and says uh Jesus come and heal my my
[31:06] sick servant yes and and Lord you said
[31:10] to him that okay I'll come shortly but
[31:14] he mentioned with a man of faith that
[31:18] you don't have to come to my house I'm
[31:21] not worthy that you should walk into the
[31:24] doors of my home but just speak the word
[31:27] and I know my servant will be healed
[31:30] amen and you mentioned such great faith
[31:33] I have not found in Israel and Lord
[31:37] that's what it takes for us as Believers
[31:39] yes Lord for us to stand on your word
[31:43] you claim you paid for our healing

[32:25] know father I won't say you can
[32:28] work a miracle but too many times many
[32:32] Believers are are expecting one but
[32:35] maybe it'll take a a little time but
[32:38] it's time to hold hold on to your
[32:42] unchanging hand Lord Hold On To You by
[32:46] faith knowing without faith it's
[32:49] impossible to please God yes Lord and
[32:52] father it's time to truly search our
[32:55] hearts where do we stand with you Lord

[45:09] God whatever this purpose whatever the
[45:11] purpose this service Lord this is not a
[45:13] coincidence we didn't come just because
[45:14] it's Sunday morning we come because
[45:16] there's a purpose there's a purpose here

[45:29] let you accomplish what that purpose is
[45:32] now through us as we committed all to
[45:35] your hands ask your blessings upon it
[45:37] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:39] we pray amen amen numbers 24 8 and
[45:45] N amen God brought him forth out of
[45:48] Egypt God the scripture talking about
[45:51] Israel now this is balum going through
[45:54] this situation with Israel this is God
[45:56] speaking of is Israel God brought him
[45:58] forth out of Egypt he hath as it were
[46:01] the strength of a unicorn he shall eat
[46:04] up the Nations his enemies and shall
[46:07] break their bones and Pierce them
[46:09] through with uh with his arrows he
[46:12] couched he laid down as a lion and as a
[46:16] great lion who shall stir him up blessed
[46:21] listen now blessed is he that blesseth
[46:23] thee and cursed is he that curseth thee
[46:28] you could be seated if you'd
[46:30] like amen this very poignant scripture
[46:33] many times we look to we've read we've
[46:35] heard brother brother Brown refer to
[46:37] many many
[46:40] times and it becomes something of a uh
[46:43] of a cry for me uh even even more so in
[46:46] this day I've U uh it's become apparent
[46:51] that it's very possible uh that this
[46:55] that well first of all we read this
[46:56] scripture the scripture is very uh uh uh
[47:01] correct it's it's very up todate uh it's
[47:05] it we we know it to be very true that
[47:09] the the the
[47:10] scripture is plain to say that whoever
[47:13] curses Israel is cursed right and
[47:15] whoever blesses Israel is blessed that
[47:17] prophecy we know came through balam that
[47:19] God gave to balum was the only thing he
[47:21] could do was prophesy uh Bam's way
[47:25] turned into Israel's m akake but we'll
[47:27] get to that in a little bit but I wanted
[47:29] to talk more right now about that
[47:31] situation and we recognize scripturally
[47:34] that whosoever curses Israel is cursed
[47:36] and whoever blesses Israel is blessed uh
[47:40] that scripture holds true yet today you
[47:42] know this nation according to a prophet
[47:45] of God brother brandham a the prophet of
[47:47] God 1956 said that uh America would
[47:51] either accept or reject God and we say
[47:55] well did he accept it or re rejected
[47:57] well in
[47:58] 1957 he said they rejected God so that
[48:01] kind of settles that question uh in 1956
[48:05] 1957 you say well how has this nation
[48:08] been so prosperous how has it been so
[48:10] good how has it gone forth the way it's
[48:12] been able to go under a curse but or
[48:16] after actually having rejected God but
[48:18] you have to understand that even even
[48:21] back then and even up till the recent
[48:24] time Israel uh uh America the United
[48:27] States of America has been very good
[48:29] friends with Israel they have been our
[48:32] number one partner in the Middle East uh
[48:35] we have been uh shared uh uh democracy
[48:39] and and many many things together but it
[48:42] but America has always helped Israel
[48:45] America's usually at least always taken
[48:47] care of Israel been there for Israel
[48:50] right when others have raised up against
[48:53] Israel America's been there with them
[48:55] America's been there for them amen and
[48:58] America's helped to take care of them
[49:00] because they've been uh our Ally they've
[49:03] been our friend we've been their friend
[49:05] so to understand that a lot of and now
[49:09] this in my opinion a lot of what America
[49:12] has been able to uh overcome even though
[49:15] she's turned her back on God is that the
[49:18] scripture says that whoever blesses
[49:21] Israel is blessed that's what the Bible
[49:24] says that's what Bam's prophecy was that
[49:27] still holds true that brother R said
[49:29] that still holds true today so if
[49:32] whoever blesses Israel is blessed if
[49:35] America has blessed Israel over the
[49:37] years even after that time then we
[49:40] understand that Israel is yet still or
[49:43] or America is yet still going to be
[49:45] blessed right amen because she has
[49:48] blessed Israel right she's been a friend
[49:50] to Israel she's helped Israel now we're
[49:53] getting to a place now look I've seen a
[49:56] lot lot going on friend and as you can
[49:58] see it and I'm not a uh brother Brown
[50:02] preached modern events made clear about
[50:04] prophecy but he did not preach prophecy
[50:07] made clear by modern events so I do not
[50:09] preach prophecies becoming clear by
[50:12] modern events not doing that but a
[50:15] understanding or a wakening up of of
[50:18] understanding of where we're at today
[50:19] and what's going on if you see very
[50:22] subtle un under the radar even in a lot
[50:25] of ways because the lot of people keep
[50:27] talking about this that and the other
[50:29] and and of course the presidential race
[50:31] in this country and that kind of thing
[50:33] but the underlying theme of a lot of
[50:35] things that's going on in the world and
[50:37] in our nation now in our nation it's
[50:41] becoming very much an anti-israel Nation
[50:45] again now I know it's been a small
[50:47] amount but it seems to be growing all
[50:49] the time right uh you see these very
[50:54] anti-israel uh uh
[50:59] uh protest thank you protest coming at
[51:03] at schools and very little done about
[51:06] them very little done about them I mean
[51:09] they gone on for months and months
[51:11] Define school policy defying schools
[51:14] rules defying the things that that the
[51:17] schools have set up have set forth
[51:19] defying all that and the and and the
[51:21] school does nothing right now they
[51:25] finally started to a couple of
[51:27] presidents have resigned and stuff but
[51:29] but the underlying theme of it is the
[51:33] overall uh acceptance of anti-israel
[51:37] fervor today and we know that's going to
[51:40] happen we know that according to
[51:41] Zachariah all the all the nations all
[51:44] around Israel is going to come against
[51:45] them amen but what would Israel be if
[51:49] America turns its back on Israel now
[51:52] let's leave the protest and look at the
[51:55] foundation of our government
[51:57] we have helped Israel through this war
[52:00] now how could you not I mean really it
[52:03] it through a terrorist organization to
[52:07] fly in and Slaughter thousands of of
[52:10] innocent Jews for basically no reason
[52:13] just because they're terrorists kill
[52:15] them rape them murder to the women and
[52:18] the babies and the
[52:20] children who can blame them right but
[52:23] there's also been another sentiment that
[52:26] kind kind of still a little bit under
[52:28] the radar but you keep your ear to the
[52:30] ground long enough you understand you
[52:32] can see the things that's happening and
[52:34] then and and and what's being said even
[52:36] in uh our government uh the foundation
[52:40] of our country whether we support Israel
[52:42] or not see there can be thousands or
[52:45] tens or hundreds or millions of uh
[52:47] citizens that still support Israel but
[52:49] if the foundation of our federal
[52:51] government doesn't that's the
[52:53] representation of who we are as people
[52:56] brother random said it whether I like it
[52:59] or not I'm an American and whether I
[53:01] like it or not my government represents
[53:03] me amen and unfortunately in too many
[53:07] ways I don't like it uh at all
[53:12] but understanding that that that
[53:15] Foundation there
[53:18] has has had some inklings against Israel
[53:23] to speak against them to withhold
[53:27] uh uh weaponry and things like that uh
[53:31] to come against him and say Israel
[53:33] should not be doing this who is who are
[53:36] they that's over there to say we
[53:37] shouldn't be doing it they're defending
[53:40] their citizens and I don't blame a I
[53:44] don't blame a mama a bear for defending
[53:46] her clubs at all much less would I come
[53:51] against a nation who's trying to take
[53:52] care of their own people I I wish our
[53:55] nation did that yeah uh it's come to the
[53:58] place that our nation doesn't seem to
[54:00] care about its people uh murders rapes
[54:04] crimes whatever it is that just hardly
[54:07] don't seem to care you hardly hear much
[54:09] about it amen but the point of it is
[54:12] whoever blesses Israel's bless whoever
[54:14] curses Israel's curse now what's coming
[54:17] next now we don't know what's coming
[54:19] next God knows amen God knows what's
[54:22] coming next but I know that uh there's a
[54:26] very real possibility that this nation
[54:31] after the election could take a very
[54:33] very hard turn against Israel right amen
[54:39] amen a very hard turn against Israel by
[54:42] a person who has
[54:44] supported a lot of the protest that's
[54:47] been going on against Israel yes did you
[54:50] imagine now if that happens where's this
[54:53] nation going to be if what this nation
[54:55] has been hanging on really since it was
[54:59] uh had rejected God uh 70 years ago what
[55:04] almost 70 years ago if if it's been
[55:07] going
[55:08] along since that
[55:11] time because she's been a friend to
[55:14] Israel because she's blessed Israel
[55:17] what's going to happen if she turns her
[55:19] back on Israel and basically curses
[55:24] Israel what's going to happen to this
[55:26] country if that's the thing that's been
[55:27] holding this country together what's
[55:29] going to happen if that goes away right
[55:32] where is this country going to be right
[55:34] what's going to happen if the fervor
[55:36] around the world is becoming to that
[55:39] place as well what is going to happen to
[55:41] the what is going to happen to this
[55:42] world friend I'm not again I'm not
[55:45] trying to make a prophecy come real just
[55:48] by preaching something but I also
[55:51] understand we're living in real times
[55:53] we're living in times and again uh uh uh
[55:57] I'll make this statement I heard brother
[55:59] randam when he was uh mentioning that 60
[56:02] almost 60 years
[56:03] ago about how late it was and about how
[56:07] the things were shaping up and how I
[56:10] couldn't believe that by the way things
[56:11] were shaping up that we could last that
[56:14] much longer well how much more now 60
[56:16] years later do we see these things
[56:18] happening and not only that but all of
[56:20] the other Wicked evil things that's
[56:23] taking place in the in the world and in
[56:25] our country
[56:28] the literal legalization of things that
[56:31] are absolutely antis scripture right
[56:35] anti- word anti- god what happens to a
[56:39] nation when it turns its back on God
[56:41] well now what happens to a nation when
[56:43] it not only has turned its back on God
[56:45] but turned its back on God's friend
[56:47] Israel right what's going to happen to
[56:51] us and now amen now that's going to take
[56:56] place now amen let's go back over to
[57:00] Numbers chapter
[57:03] 22 let's get into the story a little
[57:06] [Music]
[57:09] bit there's good nuances in the
[57:13] story bam was a prophet of God he was a
[57:18] true prophet of God he had according to
[57:20] brother R he had the same Spirit on him
[57:24] to prophesy as Moses had on him as the
[57:29] prophet of God Amen the things that baam
[57:33] prophesy I.E whoever blesses Israel is
[57:37] blessed whoever curses Israel is cursed
[57:40] are still true today absolutely true
[57:43] today
[57:44] amen but the error that balam made
[57:49] wasn't his prophecies because he did
[57:52] even though he really kind of didn't
[57:55] want to he
[57:57] did say what God told him to say amen
[58:01] that's why he said that that's the only
[58:03] reason it was able to stay that way now
[58:05] look let's go Numbers chapter
[58:08] 22 uh we'll just start with verse one
[58:11] and the children of Israel set forward
[58:14] and pitched in the plains of Moab on
[58:16] this side of Jordan by Jericho and bailo
[58:19] the son of zapor saw all that Israel had
[58:22] done to the amorites now Bao was the
[58:24] king at that time and Moab was sore
[58:27] afraid of the people because uh they
[58:29] were many and Moab was distressed
[58:31] because of the children of Israel Moab
[58:33] said unto the Elders of Midian now shall
[58:36] this company lick up all that are around
[58:39] about us as a ox lith up the grassp the
[58:42] field Bao the son of zor was King of the
[58:46] moabites at that
[58:48] time he sent Messengers therefore unto
[58:52] balam now look at the wickedness of Moab
[58:56] he sent Messengers therefore unto balum
[58:59] the son of uh beor to pathor which is by
[59:03] the river of the land of the children of
[59:05] his people to uh to call him saying
[59:08] behold there is a people come out of
[59:10] Egypt behold they cover the face of the
[59:12] Earth and they abide over against me
[59:15] come now therefore I pray thee curse me
[59:17] this people and this is of course uh
[59:20] Bao's desire for them for for balam to
[59:24] come and curse the people so
[59:26] so just like this comes forth a lot of
[59:32] things you hear
[59:33] today
[59:35] uh I is this to be a prophecy from
[59:40] God or is this just something that a man
[59:45] or a person or a group has said or
[59:47] thought or
[59:49] believed he's trying to put this king of
[59:52] Moab bam is trying to before balam even
[59:56] comes put words in his
[59:59] mouth thus prophesy such well that's
[1:00:04] just a hirling prophet that's just like
[1:00:06] that's just like the uh uh the the 400
[1:00:11] prophets that uh that Ahab
[1:00:14] had it's the same thing just hiring
[1:00:17] prophets right let's call as Joe Jose
[1:00:20] came up with Ahab he said let let me
[1:00:22] call my 400 prophets and see if this is
[1:00:25] of the Lord
[1:00:26] well if every one of the 400 prophets is
[1:00:28] some hireling Prophet they're not going
[1:00:30] to say what God says they're going to
[1:00:32] say what the man wants to hear well this
[1:00:36] is what bailo is trying to set balum up
[1:00:38] for to say only what I say prophesy it
[1:00:43] the way I want it to be prophesied which
[1:00:45] was what come I pray thee and curse me
[1:00:48] this people that's what he wanted BM to
[1:00:50] do just come and curse these people now
[1:00:54] obviously jat had just enough God in him
[1:00:57] to say isn't there one more I mean was
[1:00:59] 400 not good enough for you you want one
[1:01:03] more well there's one more his name is
[1:01:05] Michael but I hate him he's always
[1:01:07] speaking against me oh don't let the
[1:01:09] king say so bring him out here and they
[1:01:12] went and got him and they did the exact
[1:01:14] same thing to Micah they said now Micah
[1:01:17] four all these 400 prophets have been in
[1:01:19] unison together to speak good for the
[1:01:22] king to speak good of Ahab to speak good
[1:01:24] of their desire to go up with
[1:01:26] Jehoshaphat it's all been good now if
[1:01:28] you can just come see putting that seat
[1:01:30] trying to get him Ju Ju Just say what he
[1:01:33] want you to hear amen oh that's not a
[1:01:37] prophet right amen a prophet doesn't
[1:01:40] would just say what the people want to
[1:01:42] hear or say what you think they want to
[1:01:44] hear say what they no but see they he
[1:01:47] they come to him and say now now this is
[1:01:49] all been in unison they've all spoke
[1:01:52] together in one mind said everybody's in
[1:01:55] agreement for Ahab to go up and of
[1:01:58] course like a true man of God will one
[1:02:01] out of a million however many one in 400
[1:02:03] this time I guess he said I'll say only
[1:02:06] what God tells me to say can you imagine
[1:02:09] the eye rolling you could probably heard
[1:02:11] their eyes roll oh here we go again
[1:02:14] we're going to get in
[1:02:15] trouble but that's what Ahab said we'll
[1:02:18] bring him out here anyway God gave it
[1:02:21] God gave Micah a dream and says I see
[1:02:23] Israel on the hill scattered Like Chief
[1:02:26] having no Shepherd in other words if you
[1:02:28] go up you're going to
[1:02:30] die amen praise the Lord and what
[1:02:34] happened exactly what Micah said what
[1:02:36] happened to the 400
[1:02:38] Prophets You know what happens to a
[1:02:41] hireling Prophet this is the same
[1:02:44] situation bot's trying to get trying to
[1:02:47] already plant a seed to have balum come
[1:02:50] and just all I want you to do bam is
[1:02:52] just come and say what you're going to
[1:02:53] say they already know he's a prophet
[1:02:56] amen but he's a prophet of Moab so he's
[1:02:58] a prophet
[1:03:00] of along the same lines as a hireling
[1:03:03] prophet but he had enough God at least
[1:03:05] at this time to say only what God put in
[1:03:08] his heart but look now I pray thee curse
[1:03:10] me this
[1:03:12] people for they too uh uh for they are
[1:03:16] too Mighty for me per Adventure I shall
[1:03:20] Prevail that we may Smite them and that
[1:03:23] I may drive them out of the land for I
[1:03:25] was
[1:03:26] that uh that he whom thou blesses is
[1:03:29] blessed and he whom thou curses is
[1:03:32] cursed so we know BM you're a prophet we
[1:03:35] know that what you say from God is true
[1:03:38] amen we know that your prophecy whoever
[1:03:40] you curse is cursed and whoever is
[1:03:42] blessed is blessed we know that so come
[1:03:45] here now and curse him for
[1:03:47] me we know you say what God says well
[1:03:51] then okay then I'm going to say what God
[1:03:53] says not what you're telling me to say
[1:03:56] right amen but at least bam had that
[1:03:59] much and the Elders of of Moab the
[1:04:02] Elders of Midian departed with the now
[1:04:04] look this is how wicked and evil Moab
[1:04:07] was now we know where Moab come now Moab
[1:04:10] obvious we know was the family uh was
[1:04:13] the son of lot and his oldest daughter
[1:04:16] and his oldest daughter actually his
[1:04:18] oldest and youngest daughter got got a
[1:04:21] lot drunk and laid with him the oldest
[1:04:24] daughter had had Moab as a
[1:04:27] result and how Wicked it of course
[1:04:30] devolved from there seventh verse the
[1:04:32] elders the Elders of Moab and the Elders
[1:04:36] of Midian departed with the rewards of
[1:04:40] divination or
[1:04:42] witchcraft you can see how how demonic
[1:04:46] they already had gotten because they
[1:04:49] were going to take the rewards of
[1:04:51] Witchcraft to Bam as a reward we're
[1:04:55] going to reward you with witchcraft thou
[1:04:58] man of
[1:05:00] God how Wicked evil see and understand
[1:05:05] and and me and my wife's gotten these
[1:05:07] conversations before a lot of people
[1:05:11] doing these things they're they're under
[1:05:13] an anointing friend understand they're
[1:05:16] under an anointing they're they're
[1:05:19] they're doing what they believe is the
[1:05:21] correct thing to do and they don't see
[1:05:24] anything wrong with
[1:05:26] taking witchcraft as a reward to a man
[1:05:30] of God right they don't see anything
[1:05:33] wrong with that and people in the world
[1:05:36] is the same way today they don't see any
[1:05:39] they don't say anything wrong with that
[1:05:41] I had a guy a couple weeks ago asked me
[1:05:43] we had worked with this uh with this
[1:05:46] other team before we worked with them
[1:05:48] when we were uh in Spokane I believe I
[1:05:51] can't remember now anyway um and he came
[1:05:54] up to me and I was out in the work
[1:05:55] trailer he said uh are you still
[1:05:57] preaching I said yeah I still so Pastor
[1:06:00] have church and all and the next words
[1:06:03] out of his mouth was cussing yeah I
[1:06:06] think something that you would think is
[1:06:09] a somewhat civilized conversation of of
[1:06:12] asking about God and Ministry and church
[1:06:15] and the next thing but they don't think
[1:06:16] anything about it right it doesn't mean
[1:06:19] anything to them amen right it it goes
[1:06:23] they're under that anointing they're
[1:06:24] under that spirit
[1:06:26] that that's where they live that's who
[1:06:28] they are we look at it and
[1:06:31] think why would you think to a man of
[1:06:34] God that you consider him a prophet of
[1:06:36] God why would you think a reward of
[1:06:38] Witchcraft would be a proper uh
[1:06:42] reward but that it's the same Spirit
[1:06:45] today it doesn't mean anything to them
[1:06:48] but that's how bad that's how far moah
[1:06:51] had gotten the rewards of of Divination
[1:06:53] in their hand and they came to bear and
[1:06:55] SP balam and spake unto him the words of
[1:06:58] baalam and he said unto them Lodge here
[1:07:01] this night and I will bring you word
[1:07:04] again as the Lord shall speak unto me
[1:07:07] and the princes of Moab Abode with balam
[1:07:10] now fortunately again bam had enough
[1:07:13] that his prophecy was going to be
[1:07:15] correct according to what God
[1:07:18] Said and God came unto Baum and said
[1:07:21] what men are these with thee now God
[1:07:24] knows what men those are
[1:07:26] God knows everything there's nothing God
[1:07:28] doesn't know but what's he doing just
[1:07:30] like in the Garden of Eden God's testing
[1:07:33] BM amen because God look God knows balam
[1:07:36] he knows who balam is Right amen he
[1:07:39] knows the gift this gift is on bam
[1:07:42] because remember gifts and callings are
[1:07:44] without repentance he knows his gifts
[1:07:47] there so he's testing bam do you know
[1:07:51] who these people are do you know who
[1:07:53] you're giving uh your time and energy
[1:07:56] and effort do you know who you're you're
[1:07:59] conversing with do you know these
[1:08:02] people cuz God knows them this isn't a
[1:08:05] question like it's like God coming in
[1:08:07] the Garden of Eden uh like a a blind man
[1:08:11] in a black dark room with no light
[1:08:13] looking for a black cat that's not
[1:08:16] there where are you Adam where are you
[1:08:20] but God knows exactly where Adam was
[1:08:23] right he's testing Adam Adam do you know
[1:08:26] where you are do you know what you've
[1:08:27] done do you know what's happened now
[1:08:30] he's doing the same thing to b b do you
[1:08:32] know who these people
[1:08:33] are do you know they have brought
[1:08:36] rewards of
[1:08:38] Witchcraft demonic evil stuff to reward
[1:08:42] you for your
[1:08:45] prophecy do you know who these people
[1:08:47] are bam said to God bailo the son of
[1:08:50] zippor King of Moab has sent unto me
[1:08:53] saying behold there is a people come out
[1:08:56] of Egypt which covers the face of the
[1:08:57] Earth come now curse me them per
[1:09:00] Adventure I shall be able to overcome
[1:09:02] them and drive them out now that's that
[1:09:05] and honestly I believe that was balam's
[1:09:09] desire this hirling Prophet really
[1:09:12] wanted to find a nice place of stature
[1:09:16] unfortunately that's the same spirit
[1:09:18] that happens today too amen so many
[1:09:21] people whether they actually have a gift
[1:09:23] of Prophecy or they're just making
[1:09:25] things up uh and give Prophecies of
[1:09:28] things that you can't even prove you
[1:09:30] will never be tested because they can't
[1:09:32] be time can't test some prophecies
[1:09:35] because it's so generic there's nothing
[1:09:38] to it right but that's people believe
[1:09:41] them uh maybe maybe they're real had
[1:09:44] that gift of Prophecy maybe don't I
[1:09:47] don't know but we'll get to the bottom
[1:09:49] line of who you can trust with it and
[1:09:50] who you can't just a little
[1:09:53] bit but
[1:09:55] balam wouldn't be going through all this
[1:09:57] if his desire wasn't for God to do this
[1:09:59] because he just like balo's doing to
[1:10:02] balum balam's trying to do to God well
[1:10:04] God if you just let you know this is
[1:10:06] what he wants this is what he wants you
[1:10:08] know and God said unto bam Thou shalt
[1:10:11] not go with them Thou shalt not curse
[1:10:15] the people for they are blessed why do
[1:10:18] you think I'm sending them forth to lick
[1:10:20] up all the like The Oxen with the grass
[1:10:23] why do you think that they're winning
[1:10:25] every Victory every battle why do you
[1:10:27] think that they're everything they do is
[1:10:29] blessed why do you think that they cover
[1:10:31] the whole world they do that because I'm
[1:10:33] with them yeah amen do not curse them
[1:10:38] for they are blessed do not go with
[1:10:40] those men do not give bail the time of
[1:10:43] day and when God says it he means it God
[1:10:47] does not need to repeat himself right
[1:10:50] God does not need to rethink it God does
[1:10:53] not need to put it in different words he
[1:10:55] said said no that means no Amen period
[1:10:58] that's the end of it no more discussion
[1:11:01] no more begging no more asking no more
[1:11:03] pleading no more coming to say well
[1:11:06] maybe he will have changed his mind by
[1:11:08] now no God does not change his mind he
[1:11:10] said no and he meant no and what no
[1:11:14] means no no is from God bam rose up in
[1:11:19] the morning said unto the princes of baa
[1:11:21] get you into your land for the Lord
[1:11:23] refuseth to give me Le to leave to go
[1:11:26] with you now he didn't tell him the
[1:11:27] other part he just said God is just not
[1:11:29] going to let me go with you to do what
[1:11:31] Bao
[1:11:32] wants the prince of Mo uh of Moab rose
[1:11:36] up went unto Bao and uh and said balam
[1:11:40] refuseth to come with us God said no
[1:11:44] When God says no he means it amen so bam
[1:11:48] goes to them and says I can't go with
[1:11:50] you God says I can't go uh I can't come
[1:11:53] out and play today
[1:11:55] no tell them the truth that people's
[1:11:58] blessed God told me they are blessed and
[1:12:01] if you want any hope of survival you
[1:12:04] should probably follow along with what
[1:12:06] they believe and say no no he just said
[1:12:09] that God's just not going to let me go
[1:12:10] with you today he goes to God
[1:12:13] again Moab I'm G stop my reading there
[1:12:17] Moab uh sends bot uh sends him again and
[1:12:21] even even more important people in his
[1:12:24] cabinet and sends him down and says bam
[1:12:27] uh are you sure can we just convince you
[1:12:31] uh we'll give you anything we'll do
[1:12:33] anything am and Bam says even if B give
[1:12:37] me his whole house full of silver and
[1:12:39] gold I can only say what God tells me
[1:12:42] but then what does he
[1:12:44] do he then turns around says but hold on
[1:12:47] a second spend another night here with
[1:12:50] me and I'll go ask him again
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:55] that tells you right there even though
[1:12:57] balam said though he give me a house
[1:12:59] full of silver and gold I can only say
[1:13:01] what God Said but he's still he's still
[1:13:04] hoping maybe God just might let him go
[1:13:07] and get that house of silver gold or
[1:13:10] divinations or whatever B's trying to
[1:13:12] offer him whatever it might be I just
[1:13:16] all that being said just just give me
[1:13:18] another minute hold on here stay another
[1:13:21] night I'm going go ask God again God
[1:13:25] said
[1:13:26] no God meant no amen and Bam comes and
[1:13:30] say and and God says okay go ahead go
[1:13:32] with them going do it anyway that's what
[1:13:35] he says a lot of time
[1:13:37] amen people come say well God told me
[1:13:40] well how many times you ask him you know
[1:13:43] sometimes God tests us God's just
[1:13:45] testing bam again I already told you no
[1:13:49] what are you going to do
[1:13:50] now okay go ahead go so bam goes in the
[1:13:55] test that God gives him God still goes
[1:13:58] God didn't say you could go God said
[1:14:00] No period that was God's answer okay go
[1:14:05] ahead and go bam you're going to do it
[1:14:06] anyway so bam goes over and the guy said
[1:14:09] hey God God told me I could go with
[1:14:13] you uh yeah not quite balum but God said
[1:14:18] I can go with you and and one of the
[1:14:19] most Sublime stories in the whole
[1:14:22] scripture starts to shape up uh I I want
[1:14:25] to read this uh I think it's let's see
[1:14:28] here it's still in Numbers 22 because
[1:14:31] balum is now
[1:14:33] going he Saddles up now there's a
[1:14:35] there's a word in here I'm going to
[1:14:36] replace with mule so if you forgive me
[1:14:38] because it said a lot children here I
[1:14:40] don't really want to say that word
[1:14:41] because the way the word has gotten to
[1:14:43] be today right scripturally it should be
[1:14:46] fine but you understand what I'm saying
[1:14:48] I'll replace it with mule but 22 uh
[1:14:53] verse 22
[1:14:55] so bam decides to go up and when he he
[1:14:59] decides he he Saddles up his mule and he
[1:15:02] goes with the princes of Moab and God's
[1:15:05] anger was kindled because he went
[1:15:08] because I told you no well but then you
[1:15:10] told me yeah no but God doesn't change
[1:15:12] his mind see sometimes God tests us yes
[1:15:15] to see what we're going to do what is
[1:15:17] really in my heart is is it really in my
[1:15:21] heart to obey God or is it really in my
[1:15:24] heart to want to go do this right or
[1:15:28] obain this or whatever it is amen and
[1:15:31] God will test us okay you can go ahead
[1:15:34] see what happens go ahead how many times
[1:15:37] do we end up in God's permissive will
[1:15:39] even right and I can just imagine God
[1:15:41] said sure go ahead see what happens did
[1:15:43] you go ahead I'll let you go amen but
[1:15:47] you'll find out later that was not a
[1:15:49] good decision God's anger was kindled
[1:15:52] because he went and the angel of the
[1:15:54] Lord and the Angel of the Lord stood in
[1:15:56] the way now this is a funny one too for
[1:15:58] the kids um know if they're listening
[1:16:00] but the children here angel of the
[1:16:04] Lord uh the angel of the Lord stood in
[1:16:06] the way for an adversary against bam
[1:16:10] against him now he was riding upon his
[1:16:13] mule and his two servants were with him
[1:16:17] and the mule saw the angel the Lord
[1:16:19] standing in the way and his sword drawn
[1:16:22] in his hand and the mule turned aside
[1:16:25] out of the way and went into the field
[1:16:27] and B him smoke the mule to turn her
[1:16:30] into the way
[1:16:32] now there's an angel of God standing
[1:16:36] there and this dumb brute animal is more
[1:16:40] cogniz it of the Angel of the Lord than
[1:16:43] the prophet of God right
[1:16:47] amen help us
[1:16:49] Lord a a dumb a brute mule is more aware
[1:16:55] of the angel of God than the prophet of
[1:16:58] God is that shows you exactly where
[1:17:00] Bam's at but God said go ahead you'll
[1:17:03] find out
[1:17:05] amen thankfully bam had this mual that
[1:17:08] he was riding the angel Lord stood in
[1:17:11] the path of The Vineyards a wall being
[1:17:14] on this side and a wall on that side now
[1:17:16] he's trapped he's in between two walls
[1:17:19] and an angel of the Lord is blocking
[1:17:21] their
[1:17:22] way and when the mule saw the angel of
[1:17:25] the Lord she thrust herself unto the
[1:17:28] wall and crushed balam's foot against
[1:17:30] the wall and he smote her
[1:17:33] again the angel of the Lord went further
[1:17:35] and stood in a narrow place there was no
[1:17:38] way to turn either to the right hand or
[1:17:41] to the left and when the mule saw the
[1:17:43] Ang of the Lord she fell down under
[1:17:45] balum and balam's anger was kindled and
[1:17:48] he smoked the mule with a staff he
[1:17:51] continued to beat her and beat her
[1:17:54] because first she crushed him against
[1:17:56] the wall now she's just going to fight
[1:17:58] down to the ground I am not going any
[1:18:01] further you can go if you want but I'm
[1:18:04] not going I am not going to I am not
[1:18:07] going to face that angel of God with
[1:18:09] that sword drawn in their hand I'm not
[1:18:12] going to do it she falls flat down and
[1:18:14] he keeps beating
[1:18:16] her and again one of the most Sublime
[1:18:20] parts of the scripture kind of gets up
[1:18:22] there with iron floating you know
[1:18:25] the Lord opened the mouth of the mule
[1:18:28] and she said unto bam what have I done
[1:18:31] unto thee that thou H has smitten me
[1:18:34] these three times now can you imagine
[1:18:36] the man of God the the the prophet of
[1:18:38] God standing there does not recognize
[1:18:41] the angel of the Lord is there mule
[1:18:43] Falls straight to the ground he keeps
[1:18:44] beating her and she turns around and
[1:18:46] looks at him and says what are you
[1:18:48] beating me for amen I've been a good mu
[1:18:50] to
[1:18:51] you i' I've I've taken you everywhere
[1:18:54] You' wanted to go I've done everything
[1:18:56] you've asked of me why are you beating
[1:18:58] me so
[1:18:59] bad these three
[1:19:01] times you
[1:19:04] imagine Not only was the mule speaking
[1:19:06] to him bam said unto the mule because
[1:19:11] thou has mocked me I would there were a
[1:19:14] sword in sword in mine hand for now
[1:19:18] would I kill thee now the man's having a
[1:19:20] conversation with his
[1:19:22] mule now that's straight jacket
[1:19:25] territory there that's rubber room land
[1:19:28] that that's you start talking to a mule
[1:19:30] hearing the mule talk back CU in my
[1:19:33] opinion there's probably if there were
[1:19:35] anybody else around nobody would else
[1:19:37] nobody else would hear this meal talking
[1:19:40] if this was only for B they might hear
[1:19:42] hear or something but they wouldn't hear
[1:19:44] the mule talking this was for BB they
[1:19:46] think the man's crazy because he's
[1:19:47] sitting there talking to her and he says
[1:19:50] if I had a sword I'd kill you right now
[1:19:52] and that mule saved the man's
[1:19:56] life and the mule said unto balam am I
[1:19:59] not thy mule upon which thou has ridden
[1:20:02] ever since uh I was thine unto this day
[1:20:06] was I ever wrought to do so unto thee
[1:20:09] and he said nay in
[1:20:12] the I I just love that part amen I've
[1:20:16] been a good mule done everything you ask
[1:20:19] and now You' Bea me to death why would
[1:20:21] you do that I've done everything you've
[1:20:23] wanted me to do I've been a good
[1:20:26] haven't I done all of this since since I
[1:20:28] was with you youve rode me everywhere
[1:20:30] yeah yeah then the Lord opened the eyes
[1:20:33] of bam and he saw the angel of the Lord
[1:20:36] standing in the way and his sword drawn
[1:20:39] in his hand and he bowed down his head
[1:20:42] and fell flat on his face the angel of
[1:20:45] the Lord said unto here wherefore hast
[1:20:47] thou smitten thy mule these three times
[1:20:50] behold I went out to withand thee
[1:20:53] because thy way is per verse before
[1:20:56] me why are you beating your mule she's
[1:20:58] the one that saved your life if you had
[1:21:00] kept going on this way you'd be dead she
[1:21:04] saved
[1:21:06] you and the mule saw me and turned for
[1:21:09] me these three these three times unless
[1:21:12] she had turned from me surely now also I
[1:21:16] had slain thee and saved her
[1:21:21] alive
[1:21:22] amen bam said to the Ang of the Lord I
[1:21:25] have sinned for I knew not that thou
[1:21:27] stood Us in the way against me now
[1:21:30] therefore it if it displease Thee I will
[1:21:33] get back me again well that's what I
[1:21:36] told you to begin with but and the angel
[1:21:38] of the Lord said unto bam go with the
[1:21:40] men but only the word that I shall speak
[1:21:43] unto thee that shall thou uh Thou shalt
[1:21:47] speak so bam went with the princes of
[1:21:49] Bao for the purpose of for the purpose
[1:21:53] of he
[1:21:55] giving
[1:21:57] that
[1:21:59] appropriate prophecy for today
[1:22:02] Amen in that came the prophecy that we
[1:22:06] read starting this
[1:22:08] message whoever blesses Israel is
[1:22:11] blessed whoever curses Israel is cursed
[1:22:13] you are like a unicorn strong and mighty
[1:22:16] nation you are a blessed Nation God is
[1:22:19] with you God is still with them saints

[1:22:30] still with them and they are still a
[1:22:31] blessed people amen and whoever blesses
[1:22:34] them and is blessed whoever curses them

[1:22:42] Bless the people bless Israel he can
[1:22:45] only bless them he could do nothing else
[1:22:48] but bless them and of course after that
[1:22:51] warning of the Angel of the Lord
[1:22:53] standing there that would have killed
[1:22:55] him if he had continued on he was only
[1:22:58] going to say what God told him to say to
[1:23:00] the displeasure of Bao who clapped his
[1:23:03] hands and got mad and and riled up
[1:23:06] against Bao and but but the more the
[1:23:09] more and even with
[1:23:12] that Bao went three times and Bor went
[1:23:17] with him every time okay I I'll take you
[1:23:21] here and here's will your curse them and
[1:23:24] he takes in there and Bam says okay set
[1:23:27] up seven altars seven Rams seven bullog

[1:23:32] amen same thing that God had done with
[1:23:34] through Moses bam had enough he knew
[1:23:36] that that was the way to do it he said
[1:23:38] set up seven altars and and he came
[1:23:40] forth and all he did was bless Israel Ba
[1:23:43] got mad goes to another spot okay here's
[1:23:45] where you curse them okay set up seven
[1:23:47] off and B went with him every single
[1:23:49] time all three times not only did he go
[1:23:52] to God twice
[1:23:54] when God the first time told him
[1:23:56] no now he goes on to three places one a
[1:24:00] high place of course and says now curse
[1:24:03] Israel but all that could come out of
[1:24:05] his mouth was blessings amen even when
[1:24:08] he said it all up that way so balum
[1:24:11] could not curse God so what or Israel so
[1:24:14] what did he
[1:24:15] do he couldn't curse her so she so he
[1:24:19] taught her to commit
[1:24:21] fornication he taught her to leave and
[1:24:25] disobey the word of God that was the
[1:24:29] thing that guided yes he was a prophet
[1:24:31] his prophecy was true but the same thing
[1:24:34] that it is today you say you want a test
[1:24:36] I give you a test are the trinitarians
[1:24:39] do they believe in three gods did he
[1:24:41] baptize in the father son the Holy Ghost

[1:25:05] saying that there aren't people out
[1:25:06] there that don't have gifts of Prophecy

[1:25:13] right where do they stand if they
[1:25:15] believe in three
[1:25:17] Gods I'm sorry they it might be their
[1:25:22] prophecy might be right but I'm I'm not
[1:25:24] going to listen to it right
[1:25:28] amen I believe in the message of the
[1:25:30] hour amen and I know it's the truth and
[1:25:33] there's nobody or anything that's going
[1:25:35] to get me off of that period period And
[1:25:38] I will say it again big
[1:25:42] period yeah and in that message that
[1:25:46] Vindicated

[1:25:52] in this message right
[1:25:55] well if rapturing if if I want to go in
[1:25:57] a Rapture and I and and I'm anxious if

[1:26:05] Rapture take place Lord in any
[1:26:08] moment and there's rapturing faith in
[1:26:11] here why do I why would I want to listen
[1:26:13] to anybody
[1:26:14] else I don't mean that derogatory I
[1:26:17] don't mean that me and I'm not saying
[1:26:19] that the things that some are preaching
[1:26:21] maybe they may be from the word it may
[1:26:23] be good lessons but if I want rapturing
[1:26:27] Faith that's more than just a good
[1:26:29] lesson that is something that's going to
[1:26:30] take me out of this
[1:26:33] world if rapturing face in the message
[1:26:36] why don't I listen to anybody else amen

[1:27:10] right track no she's doomed she's done

[1:27:16] her border border Coast to Coast amen
[1:27:19] I'm not looking for that what am I
[1:27:21] looking for I'm looking for a rapture am
[1:27:25] that's the day and the hour that we're
[1:27:26] living that's the anointing that's the
[1:27:29] message amen that this bride this last
[1:27:32] day bride is preparing herself to go
[1:27:35] meet her Lord in a Rapture yes praise
[1:27:39] God that's what my anointing is that's
[1:27:42] what my focus is that's the pro point
[1:27:44] and purpose behind all of our existence
[1:27:47] today yes amen amen I'm ready to go in a
[1:27:51] Rapture amen amen praise the Lord you
[1:27:53] want to see God face to face one that's
[1:27:55] the best way I know of to do it yes amen
[1:27:59] but he but what bam did then was teach
[1:28:02] the people against the
[1:28:05] word he gave them he could not prophesy
[1:28:08] against them so what did he do he taught
[1:28:11] them to commit whoredoms with the with
[1:28:12] the people of Moab he came in as we've
[1:28:15] said this uh several forgot when it was
[1:28:18] it's been a while back but we're all one
[1:28:21] we're all the same people let's just all
[1:28:23] come together and Nar in together and
[1:28:26] all these and just become one and that
[1:28:29] absolutely was aive God look at what
[1:28:32] brother brandom said
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:36] here look at he said what happened the
[1:28:39] church has got started out of Egypt on
[1:28:42] its feet a few days and what happened
[1:28:44] Satan come along with his discrepancy in
[1:28:46] the person the second came which was
[1:28:49] balum so discrepancy among them we know
[1:28:53] that's right that balam the teaching of
[1:28:55] balum that we all the same we serve the
[1:28:59] same God you do fundamentally he was
[1:29:01] right they were all family remember Moab
[1:29:06] was the was the son of lot lot was
[1:29:09] Abraham's nephew yes they were family
[1:29:12] but they weren't one they weren't the
[1:29:15] same one followed God and one followed
[1:29:19] the devil right one believed in God and
[1:29:22] and and and and the word that he gave
[1:29:25] them and the others brought
[1:29:27] witchcraft no they were not the same
[1:29:30] right yes they were family yes he had
[1:29:33] the seven altars and all the Pomp and
[1:29:35] Circumstance and all the things yeah
[1:29:37] people build the churches and they got
[1:29:38] their Bibles and they they go this way
[1:29:41] they do the the the rituals and the
[1:29:43] things and all that yeah that's all the
[1:29:44] same but spiritually they're light night
[1:29:47] and day not even the close to the same
[1:29:51] but bam taught them they were the same
[1:29:55] amen we're all one look now
[1:29:58] fundamentally he was right he offered
[1:30:01] the same sacrifice that God offered
[1:30:03] seven Rams seven Bullocks seven altars
[1:30:05] prayed the same God just as perfect to
[1:30:07] Moses did down in the wilderness just
[1:30:09] exactly the same but they were not the
[1:30:13] same foreshadowing to us what would come
[1:30:17] to pass there was again Cain manifested
[1:30:21] in the person of bam and there was God
[1:30:24] manifested in the person of Moses
[1:30:26] interpreting his word through a human
[1:30:28] being making himself known his promise
[1:30:31] through a human being and the
[1:30:33] discrepancy raised up so did it at the
[1:30:36] time of Judas there came with a
[1:30:38] discrepancy and remember remember
[1:30:41] brother Ram said this is that those
[1:30:45] people believe that they were all the
[1:30:47] same we worship the same God we should
[1:30:50] all belong to the same church we should
[1:30:52] all be the same people that sin never
[1:30:56] was forgiven
[1:30:59] Israel Jesus said himself there are all
[1:31:03] dead choosing law over Grace right amen
[1:31:08] that sin was never forgiven you can find
[1:31:11] it over in second Peter you can find it
[1:31:14] over in Revelation even in the Third
[1:31:17] Church age even in the pamus church age
[1:31:20] that was something that God held against
[1:31:22] the Third Church age
[1:31:24] was that they believ that doctrine of
[1:31:27] balum not the prophecy of balum the
[1:31:30] doctrine the
[1:31:32] teaching that's where it meets friend
[1:31:35] that's where your unpardonable sin is
[1:31:38] amen it's not mistakes and false
[1:31:40] failures things that you do no it's in
[1:31:43] rejecting of the pure True Word of God
[1:31:47] amen amen that sin was never forgiven
[1:31:50] them they perished all but three of them
[1:31:54] amen now numbers 25 I'll close with this
[1:31:59] the
[1:32:01] Israel numbers 251 in Israel Abode in
[1:32:04] shittum the people began to commit
[1:32:06] whoredoms with the daughters of Moab how
[1:32:10] was that so because they were unequally
[1:32:13] Yol right amen they called the people
[1:32:17] unto the sacrifices of their gods and
[1:32:19] the people did eat and bow down to their
[1:32:22] gods
[1:32:24] bowed down to their gods a people the
[1:32:28] New Testament says that were once
[1:32:31] enlightened oh my where is it at today
[1:32:34] friend a people that were once
[1:32:36] enlightened where are they
[1:32:38] now they bowed down to their gods and
[1:32:41] Israel joined himself unto
[1:32:44] bpor the the uh
[1:32:49] God uh of the devil
[1:32:54] I forgot the word I'm trying to say but
[1:32:57] deity and uh and and wickedness or evil
[1:33:02] B
[1:33:05] peor they joined themselves un B peor
[1:33:09] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:33:10] against
[1:33:12] Israel and the Lord said unto Moses take
[1:33:14] all the heads of the people hang them up
[1:33:17] before the Lord against the Son and the
[1:33:18] fierce anger of the Lord may be turned
[1:33:20] away from Israel Moses said unto the
[1:33:23] judges of Israel slay ye every one of
[1:33:25] his men that were born joined unto belor
[1:33:28] now a man of God a true man of God with
[1:33:31] the word of God is now coming to correct
[1:33:32] the mistake to make it right God is
[1:33:35] giving him the way and behold one of the
[1:33:37] children of Israel came and brought unto
[1:33:40] his brethen a Brethren a menish woman
[1:33:42] into the sight of Moses and the sight of
[1:33:44] all the congregation of the children of
[1:33:46] Israel who are Weeping before the door
[1:33:48] of the Tabernacle the congregation and
[1:33:50] when Phineas the son of el elazar the
[1:33:53] son son of Aaron the priest saw it he
[1:33:56] rose up from among the congregation and
[1:33:58] took a javelin in his hand went in after
[1:34:01] the man of Israel into the tent and
[1:34:03] thrust both of them through the man of
[1:34:05] Israel and the woman through their be
[1:34:07] through her belly so the plague was
[1:34:10] saved from the children of Israel and
[1:34:12] those that died in the plague were 20
[1:34:13] and 4,000 the plague why a plague
[1:34:16] remember a sin that was never forgiven
[1:34:19] not because of a prophecy but because of
[1:34:23] a
[1:34:24] word a false word of being off the word
[1:34:29] of bringing word that was not inspired
[1:34:32] by God he said well it is true
[1:34:35] well so is so is what Satan so is what
[1:34:39] the serpent told Eve in the Garden of
[1:34:42] Eden what Eve told Garden uh what the
[1:34:45] serpent told Eve in the Garden of Eden
[1:34:47] was
[1:34:48] true your eyes will be open did their
[1:34:50] eyes open yes did you know that you were
[1:34:54] naked in yes is what he told her right
[1:34:58] yes but it's not according to God's
[1:35:02] word amen God said don't touch it that's
[1:35:05] his word yes that's the end of it
[1:35:08] there's no discussion so but God maybe
[1:35:11] could I just possibly have done no that
[1:35:13] was his word it period end of the
[1:35:16] discussion praise the Lord let me read
[1:35:18] this as I close here
[1:35:21] now amen he talks about the same
[1:35:24] anointing on balam's on Moses balum
[1:35:27] false anointed ones at the end time or
[1:35:29] anointed ones at the end time balum
[1:35:31] Anointed with the same spirit that was
[1:35:33] upon
[1:35:34] Moses what was the difference the
[1:35:36] teaching the teaching of Moses was
[1:35:40] perfect the Bible said here in second
[1:35:43] Peter that it was the teaching of balam
[1:35:46] that Israel received that God never did
[1:35:48] forgive unpardonable sin not one of them
[1:35:52] got saved though they had come out of
[1:35:54] the blessings of God and seen the hand
[1:35:55] of God moving with his mighty Prophet
[1:35:58] seen it exactly Vindicated by God and
[1:36:00] because another Prophet come in with a
[1:36:02] teaching contrary disputed with Moses
[1:36:04] and tried to prove to the people that
[1:36:06] Moses was wrong Dayan and cor and many
[1:36:09] of them agreed with him and taught the
[1:36:11] children of Israel to commit fornication
[1:36:14] to go after uh to go after his
[1:36:16] organization that were all the
[1:36:20] same whether we're methus Baptist
[1:36:23] president prian Pentecostals what more
[1:36:25] we're all the same we are not he says we
[1:36:30] are not the same amen so oh they worship
[1:36:34] the same God yeah we go to church we go
[1:36:37] to church on Sunday too yeah our

[1:36:40] message you know his message comes from
[1:36:42] the Bible yeah our does too you can so
[1:36:46] on so forth oh yeah well we we must all
[1:36:50] just be the same then no not the same
[1:36:54] amen there's a stark difference between
[1:36:56] the two groups there is a huge remember
[1:37:00] it would be so close that it would
[1:37:03] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:37:06] possible praise God it's not possible
[1:37:09] but elect be deceived and thank you Lord
[1:37:12] Jesus for making me
[1:37:14] elect amen they cannot be
[1:37:17] deceived they are not the same we are
[1:37:19] not the same you are a separated people

[1:37:28] his promise for this day you are not of
[1:37:32] them the church and the bride is two
[1:37:34] separate groups amen amen your bride not
[1:37:39] of them yes amen I know that's awful
[1:37:43] strong but that's the truth just to
[1:37:45] saying dedicated to the service in this

[1:37:52] come out of her my people and be not
[1:37:55] partakers of her witchcraft yes of her
[1:37:58] sin what is witchcraft anything that's
[1:38:01] against God's

[1:38:29] denying Jesus Christ denying the word is
[1:38:32] denying Jesus Christ amen and anybody
[1:38:35] that does that is not a part of
[1:38:37] you trying to teach you into believing
[1:38:41] that there's three gods that is demonic
[1:38:44] yes trying to teach you into believing
[1:38:46] that the correct baptism is Jesus's way
[1:38:49] of baptism is the father name of the
[1:38:52] father son the holy ghost when Father
[1:38:54] Son and Holy Ghost aren't even named

[1:38:59] they are and I'm sorry again as brother
[1:39:01] R said that might be awful strong but
[1:39:03] that's the truth
[1:39:05] friend that's where it
[1:39:07] is and we know that that's where God the
[1:39:12] separation amen it's not that prophecies
[1:39:15] right wrong okay that's fine and good
[1:39:18] but what do you
[1:39:20] teach what's your word what you bringing
[1:39:23] me see bam was right in his prophecy it
[1:39:26] was his teaching that was wrong it was
[1:39:28] his teaching that caused Israel Israel's
[1:39:31] fatal mistake causing them to commit
[1:39:33] fornication against God by through or
[1:39:37] rejecting of the word right amen yeah
[1:39:41] they accepted and worshiped other idols
[1:39:43] and stuff but that wasn't it it was the
[1:39:46] rejection of his word is what did it
[1:39:50] amen God help us we believe that word
[1:39:53] it's the truth amen his word is true
[1:39:56] forever settled in heaven we don't dare
[1:40:00] God help us come against it or contrary
[1:40:02] to it or Lord just help me to be
[1:40:05] obedient to it amen praise the Lord
[1:40:07] let's stand if we
[1:40:10] could God help this nation if we get to
[1:40:13] that place I mean I say that but I I say
[1:40:17] that in the same life that I say she's
[1:40:19] doomed but we're still here there's a
[1:40:22] little bit of Grace that can be had
[1:40:24] friend then I want it yeah I'm ready to
[1:40:27] go home yes I'm ready for Rapture but if
[1:40:29] God wants to give a little more grace
[1:40:31] maybe one more Soul come in right one
[1:40:33] Soul's worth 10 million worlds and I say
[1:40:36] praise the Lord yes that that's great uh
[1:40:41] Let It Be Lord amen but then conversely
[1:40:44] if it's God's time and if it's our time
[1:40:47] to go and if God is moving us out of
[1:40:49] this place and because we're becoming
[1:40:52] less and less this world world's this
[1:40:54] world is we're looking less and less
[1:40:57] like anything that resembles godliness
[1:41:00] today then I say then I say
[1:41:03] Lord if it's that time and that person
[1:41:06] and that place and whatever then let it
[1:41:09] be amen I'm not going to try to talk God
[1:41:12] out of it it's up to him what his
[1:41:16] decision is and remember as far as the
[1:41:19] presidency goes of this country now the
[1:41:21] Bible says God puts them in right and
[1:41:24] takes them down so that's up to him what
[1:41:27] he does Amen he's the one that does it
[1:41:30] so whichever way uh it's up to him I
[1:41:34] know which way I want and my way is I
[1:41:36] want our country to get back at at least
[1:41:39] a semblance of what it once was it'll
[1:41:42] never get back to what it once was but
[1:41:45] at least in some way amen then praise
[1:41:48] the Lord I know that's what I desire but
[1:41:51] if that's not the will of the Lord then
[1:41:53] whatever his will is and that's what I
[1:41:55] want to do amen praise the Lord Jesus
