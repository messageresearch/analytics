there cause we're going to your house today I'm going to your house to amen Zacchaeus Was a wee little man and a wee little man was he he climbed up in a sycamore tree the Lord he wanted to see the

house today yes I'm going to your house today amen what a great song of the scripture amen praise the Lord little Zacchaeus he had so much going against him but he wanted to make sure that no matter what he would see the Lord Jesus and he did amen and got more than he asked for even praise the Lord amen thank the Lord Jesus what changed you are the service now we have a couple prayer requests to mention to you amen as I mentioned earlier uh Zach tapath aren't with us and children are sick they text yesterday last night said Joel and Emma are still not feeling good they've been down almost all week uh and Ruth had a runny nose so please remember them in prayer if you would also brother Pat having to stay home today uh had an eventful week but he's having it uh his monitor his heart monitor fell off and uh he needed to be back on it for another day today so and when he's on it he's supposed to kind of stay still and not be out and too uh too much uh exercise or anything so they're home today watching so God bless you brother sister Pat to where his heart monitored today I guess he has an appointment next week so uh he's doing better with his surgery he was able to go out eat lunch with us this week so we're thankful for that and he's doing a lot better but he said he still bruised down his leg and uh you know you get the middle 70s and that and it's just the healing just doesn't come as quickly so and what they did is uh fairly serious so please remember uh brother and sister Pat Uh this is of course especially brother Pat and prayer with that discontinued to heal normally and right the Lord touch him sister Norma texted me earlier and said that her son and friends are going to Mexico leaving Thursday as you know we've had here pray many times traveling mercies for Richard that his friends are going and Mexico is not necessarily the most friendly place to go nowadays so she asked that we would pray for him and friends though it would just bless them and bring them back safe also just to try it Soraya text me a little earlier and said that art needs strength today Art's having to work today he hasn't had a day off in over a week so please remember art and prayer the Lord would strengthen and touch and help him as well amen so I also had a prayer request of course remember me I'm supposed to leave today at five o'clock flying back to Salt Lake again

bibles if you would with me and as I said I'm gonna start on a new series today the Lord willing I felt a few weeks ago honestly um probably of maybe a month or two ago I felt on my heart to start this uh when uh when we finished the last series on the Holy Spirit um to maybe probably a month and a half ago when I was finishing up then mentioned to you that we had a few parts left of the holy spirit that the Lord wanted me to start bringing this today so I just trusted to be a blessing to you it's God in simplicity God and simplicity I expect several parts from it but we'll just start here part one God in Simplicity amen God is simple amen he's a simple God Saint Matthew chapter 11. we'll read one verse verse 25. to 11 25 amen praise the Lord before we wreak we just fire our heads for another word of Prayer precious Lord Jesus father we are so thankful today God to be in your house Lord to be in those with company of light precious faith and know God that you promise that we're two or three together in your name you would be in the midst yes Lord we didn't come in the name of a denomination we didn't come in the name of a Preacher a pastor or some special person or special event Lord we come because we expect to meet with you here in this place God it's been dedicated and consecrated to your service to come here Lord from out of the world and expect you to meet with us Lord to speak with us for your word to have its preeminence in our lives for you to reveal yourself to us Lord for us to get closer to you Lord and become more like you in this last day that we live father we know God that you've given us the strength to continue to press this battle and all that we have has been laid before us God some young some old Lord but God yet we feel in our hearts God that whole that that that pull or this bringing us drawing us closer to you Lord that's revealing to us and showing to us you're coming and how much closer it is God and Lord that changes in every one of our Lives Lord to to be in your uh economy Lord to be in your home to be a part of your family father it's such a privilege today God we thank you Lord for all that is that have come those who may be watching today streaming Lord may your hand be upon them to strengthen and bless and move upon every request every need every every prayer every sick body Lord we just know that you are faithful you are here God you do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think Lord You Are the Healer and by your stripes we are all healed Lord yes and may your Holy Spirit brood over this congregation and move through this place today with power and demonstration once again showing yourself to be real showing yourself to be the same yesterday today and forever Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and honor and praise for all that is said and done and now God may you on our hearts Lord you draw us to this place you've brought us here for a reason this service is for a reason this service is for a purpose Lord and God is preordained before the foundation of the world to be so God and in our hearts Lord just help us Lord speaker and hero like the god what you would have to be accomplished in this service would be done today help us Lord now as we commit it to you and Trust You Lord in all things and expect you Lord again to speak to us and to strengthen us and reveal to us this precious word we ask it in the precious holy lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen in Saint Matthew chapter 11 1 verse verse 25. and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and pruned and has revealed them unto babes amen you can be seated if you like amen Jesus another place said unless you come as this little child amen can't enter into the Kingdom of Heaven unless you come as this little child I can't think of anything more simple than a little infant a little child someone innocent that Jesus would take upon his lap and make a demonstration out of to make an example out of to show that it's it really is more simple than most people especially today even in the message try to make it it's so simple a lot of times we Overlook it we miss it you know I think there's a there's something too and I've said this before I think there's something significant about the fact that before brother Branham preached the greatest series of messages that he ever preached in his ministry the seals that before he preached the seals he preached a message called God hidden and revealed in Simplicity but you know a lot of people all of us probably know that but the one thing that maybe we haven't uh seen that the Lord brought to my attention one day is that the next service the next sermon after brother random left Jeffersonville and the next thing I wasn't in the same place that he preached the seals but the next message that brother Branham preached was God in simplicity he bookended literally two different venues but he literally bookended the seals and the breach and and all with both front and back with God in Simplicity we can't we we can't and all the things that God revealed to us and had shown to us through that uh seal message and the messages and what God showed to us through that that we can't we can't negate and miss the the the first part the first message before that and the message just after that that was God in simplicity so it's God uh hides and reveals himself in Simplicity he's still the same God that encompasses all space-time and Eternity he's still the same God that created heaven and the Earth he's still the same God that made himself so simple and so plain and so little that he would come down and live in each one of that's still the same God encompasses all space-time and Eternity but yet come into a little heart like mine a little Heart Like Yours a soul like yours so that he can have preeminence in your life amen that's the almighty God we're talking about brother Brown says this about him I am Resurrection in life this is 1963 Campbellsville Kentucky and this obviously is after the seals I am the resurrection he said what a symbol what do we see there the same as we see the flower the Life Death burial resurrection and even God makes puts flowers out that the leaves turn brown we're about to experience that time we don't get maybe to experience quite as much here in the desert as it's starting to turn fall and cool with the leaves changing and everything going down into the ground the light we don't see that as much here but I know of course on the mountains or back East we uh I used to enjoy the fall a lot the fall weather and squirrel hunting time and the leaves started changing and brother Ram's talking about that great bouquet he says make a bouquet god making a bouquet upon the breast of the earth as soon as them flowers die the red green colors uh just like that there he's talking about as he would do as this was in November this afternoon he says amen we see how beautiful God's bouquet is now he says God is not complicated God is not complicated people sometimes want to make him complicated and that Spurs the question I'm going to finish the quote but that's first a question to me brother Adam says people sometimes want to make him complicated but he God is known in Simplicity hides in it and reveals himself in it we'll read a scripture a little bit later that I believe Paul encapsulates this very idea of the heat of the hiding and revealing of himself in the same mechanism simplicity but he God is known in Simplicity we look over the top of him trying to find him he's so simple makes himself that God makes himself that way that's what makes him so great what makes God so great is that he can make himself simple the question that spurs in my heart here or this little reading is people sometimes want to make him complicated now my question then would be why would anybody want to make God more complicated why would any Minister why would any laity why would anybody want to try to make God more complicated than he really is amen I think a lot of it is the fact that uh people in certain positions don't want others to find them as easily and know him as well as they do they want people to come to them because they have the gift and they are the one on the pedestal they are the pastor they are the prophet they are the ones that you're supposed to come do you're not supposed to know it no that's the same old nicolaitan's spirit that came from the Catholic Church you can't have the Bible you're not supposed to know this you've got to come to us to get this it's the same Spirit friend that hasn't died it's the same old devil same old tactics but it's the same thing that shows to me that why God why people would want to make God complicated is so that they can try to project the people that they're the only ones that can figure them out and you've got to listen to me to be able to figure it out for yourself well Saints I'm here to tell you this morning you can't number one figure God out and number two it's not just for the priests or the minister or the pastor he is for everybody peace for all of us God hides and reveals himself not to the pastor but to everybody amen he is God to all not God to one you don't have to come to me to find God in fact I discourage you from doing that you go straight to him how many times have I told you your relationship with Jesus Christ isn't with me and Jesus Christ it's not what brother Branham and Jesus Christ it's you and him alone it's you and Jesus Christ alone that's the only relationship that God expects and that we should have is to have direct communication with him and him alone amen that's the that that to me Rings true to why some people want to complicate him to make it other people hard to find him but Saints he is so easy to see is so easy to find how many times have you probably even in yourself said how do these people not see this how do these people not uh uh understand this amen because that's just our human vernacular say understand but how how can others not see what we see amen how could other churches or denominations or or whoever it might be I look at these things and I look at the things of God and I think how easy that is how how clear it is how simple it is I think how does the whole world not understand or see this right amen when I read it and look at it it's just like baptism and baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll look at the scripture and I think how could someone baptize anybody other than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I just don't understand it it's like serpency I read and look at it and I think how can anybody not I see or believe that it was some kind of a fruit or some kind of a a what else they say I don't know what anybody says today or a different kind of fruit or some kind of fruit or apple or orange or whatever it is how when you look is seeing so simple when you look at it and think well that just makes perfect sense I told you guys the other day I was I was even witness to the guys that I work with and and we were at lunch and I was telling about somehow creation came up and I was telling about Adam and Eve and and the things that took place and uh the manager of the of our uh group looked over and said well that makes perfect sense to me not nice I just got this cement doesn't claim anything he I think his background is Catholicism maybe he doesn't believe in anything he doesn't have any kind of religious background as you go to church he doesn't claim anything he doesn't know the Bible but when you look at him you explain just in the Simplicity of what it is just someone who does have some kind of a religious covering over them or some kind of a haughty Spirit to say I already know this you can't tell me he didn't have that he said well that just makes perfect sense to me everybody said the guy's sitting at the table said that makes perfect sense amen and I look at things how does everybody how does everyone not see that yeah amen but see God's greatness to me now I just read here brother Brown said that's what makes him so great to me God's greatness is personified in the fact that he can make himself so simple that he can become so simple he can become so uh easy amen he hides and reveals himself in that Simplicity and so easy to find just as we said for a little child to be able to see Jesus we try to explain things so much so many times and I'm probably guilty of it Saints and we get into the depth of the word and there's nothing wrong with that but the common salvation of Jesus Christ and his word should be so simple that the smallest child should be able to understand amen or at least to a degree maybe not the smallest child but to a certain degree I mean if God is going to if God is going to bring a child to the age of accountability at 12 years old then a 12 year old should be able to understand the common Plan of Salvation in Jesus Christ right amen amen he's that simple shouldn't be hard to find shouldn't be complicated and if you look at it and and as and and the thing that makes it so so common simple is the fact that God reveals it to you amen just as Jesus said I thank thee father of Heaven and Earth because you hid these things from the wise and prudent but you've revealed them unto babes now what is revelation I've told you many times Revelation is just something that's just lost its covering the covering has been pulled off of it it's been made manifest it's something that you can see in front of you amen if something is hid you don't know what it is but when it's 10 it's hands to the wide the Y is imprudent and it's hid just like when the the Israelites crucified Jesus the very Messiah that they had been looking for for hundreds and even thousands of years that very Messiah is the one that they uh would not accept and crucified why because he was hid how is he him he was hid because they were looking for him in some other way they had their mindset that Jesus was going to come like this and that Jesus is going to be like this and he was going to come down to heaven and he was going to Smite all those people and he was going to divide them out and just like the threshing floor but that's not what Jesus did that's not how God operates God operates in Simplicity and if you would just look at the Simplicity of God today as God reveals it to you amen it's easy and simple when you know what it is when God opens your eyes when God reveals it to you and pulls back to cover then you can look and see but it's hid to the wise and prudent not yet to those that would be that would receive it but to those who would disbelieve it God does not cast his Pro Before Swine amen no and he asked us not to do the same so those were when it's hid if the scripture is hit it is hid from who those that are lost amen through predestination we went through a whole thing of predestination and and that predestinated uh action of God proves that God in his mind already knew you would believe it I would believe it as we as we accept it from God God reveals it to us it becomes very simple it's no longer ahead if it's irritated to them that are lost amen it is not hit to those that will believe to those that would receive it let's go to First Corinthians chapter 2. First Corinthians chapter 2 now I've subtitled this the uh uh a simple God if you will [Music] or simply simplicity God in simplicity First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 1. now I told you the Lord had put this on my heart to bring a couple of months ago amen so uh I wonder I want to continue with what I feel he put on my heart amen and look here and I brethren Paul speaking now Corinthians I Came To You Came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God and he could have done it Paul's smart man Paul is a brilliant man learned at the feet of gamelia he's very smart man he could have came to them with great swelling words of wisdom but he chose not to why for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified amen amen how much simpler can you get to that yeah amen you don't have to come with great swelling words of wisdom and put any kind of special vernacular on it that only a a tenth of a percent of the human population can understand amen it's for commonality it's for everyone it's for whosoever will I determined not to know anything among you save Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech am I preaching was not with enticing words of man wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power now it seems like that's kind of the way a lot of churches are going today they're they're either going off to uh uh uh trying to tickle people's uh emotions with a lot of and there's nothing wrong with that of the gifts and the gifts are absolutely as pertinent today as they always have been you just like we've said you just see the spirit of God moving off the Gentile bride going to the Jews amen it's just it's just as simple as that but that doesn't negate the gifts of God that God has put in in all of our lives amen every one of us have a gift of some kind that that we can locate in the scripture but see that or they've gone to the other side uh to the intellectual side to where there has to be some kind of great Revelation every time you go to church every time you have a service there's got to be something new something different there's got to be some great something that's that's come forth in the past six days that was unknown to humanity for the past seven thousand years uh it's just it at the end and and it Bruins itself from the intellect not from the spirit and that's the scary part about it because you can't figure God out you're not going to figure God out the more you think you got it figured out the more you realize you have nothing figured out you don't know God at all amen that's the scripture so it it sort of even going the one way or the other but thank God there is there is a group of people internationally around the world many in this city by the grace of God that are staying on that Middle Road that is staying down I had one time I had a brother tell me he said uh uh uh because I I preached middle of the road message my whole life really most of my life and uh back in Florida and I was preaching something along that line of in the middle of the road because brother Branham talked about that remember I preached the series here several years ago where we have to find where scripture meets scripture isn't that what brother Ram said they said the Armenians take one they go way off this way the Calvinists they take one they go way off that way but he said we want to find what we're scripture means scripture or is that to me that's middle of the road amen I had a brother tell me in Florida one time he said if you stay in the middle of the road brother you're gonna get run over I said no I'm not he said how come I said cause we're all going the same direction amen if we're all going the same direction we're not going to get run over because we're all going the same place at the same time in the same way we're going down the same road I don't have to worry about oncoming traffic I don't have to worry about getting run over because we're going the same way amen but you see the intellectual mentality the mentality of you've got to have this greater Revelation which a lot of times comes from just they think they figured something out it's not Revelation it's the figuring out of something well Paul's basically saying the same thing my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom amen enticing words of man's Wisdom and that's what draws a lot of people those that may not be pure Believers or make Believers that that draws them there's something there that draws people see there's always see there's a reason each one of you are here this morning there's a reason you're sitting there watching on a screen uh there's a reason why different churches have people all over this city all over the state all over the world I mean there's different reasons there's something that Drew them and see the one thing that I want to under that that we understand the thing that draws the bride is the word that's what the bride is concerned about that's what she feasts on that's her Manna is the word of God we are led by the spirit but we Feast off the word and as that word comes and feeds us then that's the thing that helps us want more yeah amen um you know there's all of us probably have a certain favorite food that we like or a favorite restaurant whether we like we see the glidewells I think our last six meetings have been at BJ's because it seems like they're going when we're coming but uh there's certain places people like to go you go and a lot of times if I go to a certain place if I like a certain restaurant most of the time I get the same thing because I like that I've had it one time and I want more of it and I want to keep going back because I want more of it see that's what the draw is to the bride it's the word it's not something that's Outsider or or or or contrary or it's not something to worry about tickle the emotional the Motions it's fine it's not something to tickle the intellect oh that's fine too but it's the word in the pure Simplicity and the revelation of it that draws the bride to him that makes us want more of it to make make us want more of a more more of Christ Paul knows that my speech my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of its power praise the Lord thank God for that that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men or him himself he didn't want people looking at himself just like brother random Amen brother random how many times you hear although people in the world will be contrary to this and brother random tried his very best to keep people from looking at him amen but in the power of God that's where it lays how be it we speak wisdom among them listen now now this is the place where I believe where Paul takes both sides of this this uh this message that brother Branham brought to us God hid and revealed in Simplicity it's brought to a uh to a head here as Paul draws both of these points here in one simple a couple of verses how be it six verse now how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect and Perfect Isn't sinless again if he fed said many times it's the same word that Jesus used over and he said be therefore perfect he's in my Father in Heaven is it perfect it just means full age mature amen it doesn't mean perfect and sinless but be mature be grown-ups grow in Grace and become mature Christians so when that word is brought to you you receive it as a mature Christian amen be uh how be it we speak wisdom among them that are a full age are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that that come to not so it's not of the wisdom of the world but it's the wisdom of the word in Revelation from God amen amen to those that are of full age you made any long way you can get to a full age is through a new birth amen growing grace only comes after you've received a new birth yes amen now you can grow before that I've seen that of course obviously but your real growth comes after you've received the Holy Spirit after you've been born again you grow in Grace uh seventh verse but we speak the wisdom of God how do you speak it in a mystery in a mystery how you read Paul's writings doesn't sound that mysterious to me why because it's something that now there's things look I've said this many times there's things in the scripture there's things that brother Brown has said that that I would say doesn't make sense to me and since it's probably not the right word but I don't know what else we're to use does it make sense to me it doesn't it doesn't uh uh flow with with my where I'm at at the time just put it that way so what do I do I put it on the Shelf I'll leave it there yes and I'll wait I don't go trying to dig to search to try to figure it out that's right now that's just me I I'm not saying everybody's like this or everybody does this this is just me I'm giving you my confession I put it on the Shelf I don't go digging for any kind of something on that I just leave it there because I know that this scripture is so perfect and that message is so perfect that in there in the right time God is going to show and reveal to me exactly where this place is so I can take it off the shelf and plug it where it goes amen now that being said that doesn't mean that what Paul said is a mystery to us it just is something that God remember brother random said God will reveal to you and let made known to you what you need when you need to know it you know I said that yes when you have need of knowing it right yes raise the lord well it's not always even Minister pastor we don't separate ourselves that God would reveal to us when the time is when the time is right whenever God wants to show it remember the timing is as much as important as the as the what and the how it's the win it's the win a lot of times that we miss sometimes we get remember we talked about last week and brother bran would have a vision and he would see something and and when that that Vision struck us time to pray for that little girl and she's well amen but now this Vision happens and brother Brown I'm sitting there and he's looking but there's one thing out of place there's a hat not where it's supposed to be amen and the Hat's got to be words where it's supposed to be in brother branham's Vision or it's not a valid it's not a valid time for him to do it and he can sit there for hours on end lamenting over this sick girl but until that Vision strikes exactly like brother Branham saw it it's not going to do any good and brother Branham can't be the one to go pick the Hat up and put it where he saw it in the vision right it's got to be done somebody else some other way and if it levitates off the chair it goes on the Hat Racks whatever happened it's got to be exactly the way he saw it in its time and then he sat there for hours and hours and hours all of a sudden somebody moves the Hat there's division's perfect he goes and prays the little girl and God heals her raise her up amen this is the the win is as important as the how and the why or where it it's just as important as when it takes place amen and sometimes I have to put stuff on a Shelf thank God most of my shelf is empty there are still things there but there's a lot of things over the years that the Lord's allowed me to take off that shelf and plug in and sometimes some of the confusion hasn't come necessarily from the scripture or even from the message it's from some things that I've heard preached in my past by other ministers that I try to plug in and say now where does that fit and I look and say it just doesn't fit say Lord I got to put it over here but then when God brings it down and shows it then that's just it amen hid and revealed praise the Lord Paul said we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained God ordained this before the world unto our Glory he ordained it to be hid that's why he said it is hid from the wise and prudent that's why Jesus stopped in the middle of all this going on and said I thank you Lord Jesus I thank you God that you've hid these things from the wise Improvement reveal them unto babes amen amen I'm a babe praise God such as would learn so I'm not worried about anything else I'm not worried about all the things what others say even I I'll say what others preach denominations whatever I don't worry about that it's just what the Lord puts on me what the Lord reveals to me what God shows me in here that's what matters to me amen should be what matters to each one of us praise the Lord God is ordained this from the foundation of the world they speak the wisdom that they speak the wisdom of Paul the wisdom of God and a mystery a hidden Mystery that means it comes forth with a veil remember when brother Brown was getting ready to uh uh it was talking to others about the seals and they come to brother random and said brother random this has got to be God's something revealed God brings and reveals to you that's outside the scripture that some great thing in brother Graham said absolutely not what it is is something that's already in the scripture that God has to reveal remember that cover of the seals was on for brother Branham even to the point that brother Branham admits back in his younger Ministry he preached the seals incorrectly he took the book of Larson uh Larkin Larkin I believe it was the dimensions the book on Dimension he took and he preached a lot out of that book to try to preach on the seals and it's absolutely wrong and he said that he was going to preach it wrong again until the angel come and showed him praise the Lord one at a time one each day to reveal to him and as each come and the cover was taken off there it was right amen praise the Lord to allow him to be able to preach the truth of the Gospel that was hid in this scripture Reverend said it can't be outside the Scripture it has to be absolutely contained Genesis 1 to revelation 22 cannot be outside the scripture something that God has kept hid for all the ages generations of time he told Daniel he told John the Revelator seal it up it's not time for it but when it came time and the cover was taken off there it was praise the Lord for him to reveal no that's it that's different for an individual I've said this before I I I'm not saying they should change it but I have a little contention with the the revelation of the Seven Seals the book should not be titled that in my opinion because it's the truth of the Seven Seals brother Branham cannot give you a revelation I cannot give you a revelation no Pastor Minister can give you a revelation if God if a revelation from the scripture comes to you it must come from God himself amen not me not you when they say the Revelation it is a revelation to brother brown but it is in Revelation to you yes amen being a revelation to brother Adam is one thing being a revelation to you is something else because it's a person remember it's a personal relationship yeah that Revelation has got to come directly from God to you yes the Revelation now the truth of the Seven Seals absolutely I believe that 100 that's absolutely the scriptural truth of the Seven Seals But as God reveals it to you then you then the cover's taken off you get it then it's it's something that God has given to you personally praise the Lord no longer hid no longer hid so when Paul says it come with the with the hidden wisdom the the the the hidden wisdom which God ordained from the glory from uh uh before the world unto our Glory then that just shows of course that it's hid to those who don't see it can't see it to those that are lost Jesus said the Bible says watch for what should I eat first which which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would hop they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory right it was hid to them right amen but and they were blood the Bible says they were blinded but again a just God maybe I should get back into that again um to to purposely blind children it's like uh it's like uh of people being blind to something um well I've said that okay I've made this analogy before all of you have all of you seen the sign that has Jesus written in it and the situations on the on the off part that's cut out is the first time you saw that now I'm not I'm this is rhetorical so not looking for an answer but the first time you saw that did you see Jesus I didn't when I saw that for the first time somebody showed it to me they said what do you see I just saw a bunch of jumble I didn't see Jesus at all but Jesus was sitting right there I just couldn't see him others around me that were encouraged me look again they could see Jesus I couldn't you understand this is the same analysis same situation I'm talking about that God reveals to us now once I kept looking at it looking at it once I finally saw Jesus in there I said I got it I see it now and every time I look at one of those cutouts the only thing I ever see anymore is Jesus I never see the inside part anymore I've tried to just look at the inside part again can't do it when I look at it now all I see is Jesus praise the Lord that's God revealing himself to you when God reveals it to you it's uncovered and you can't see it any other way if somebody the greatest Theologian on this planet come through that door and try to teach you the Trinity and baptism to follow us on the Holy Ghost what would you believe you've probably scoring that man out the door there's not a single proof there's not a scripture he can read there's not one single thing he can say to you to convince you any other than what we know to be the truth because God's revealed it to you you cannot see it any other way Amen to him it's a mystery to you it's something that God has made known to you praise the Lord and the Jews were looking at it in a certain way so much so that Jesus was hid to them they were blinded to him being the Messiah because they were looking in the wrong way they were looking at the sign and the inside parts and they weren't seeing Jesus they weren't seeing the Messiah and they were blinded to it that's why it was hit to them amen not because God purposely come down and said okay I'll Smite you with blindness I wouldn't be a just God but their eyes were blind because they were looking in the wrong way right amen they were blinded because they were looking in the wrong way they couldn't see the Messiah standing right in front of them because all they could see was the in between the letters yes amen the Saints when God reveals himself to you and all you can and you see it Jesus right there that's all you can see yes amen that's all you see then praise the Lord ninth verse but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither is entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit praise the Lord for the spirit searches all things yayed the Deep things of God God reveal it God makes known to us now look scripture hey let's go to Exodus there's of course many many places in the scripture that we go to but let's go to Exodus chapter 12. Exodus chapter 12 we'll start with verse 21 we went through Exodus 12 a couple of times with this last series that we did uh but we did get quite this far with it because it wasn't pertaining to our subject at the time uh and now it is Exodus 12 21 of course this is about the Paschal Lamb the Passover Lamb uh that that God gave them instruction through Moses Aaron to be able to sacrifice so that their household would be saved and that the firstborn and those through the blood would be saved from the death angel and all the specifics that God gave and everything had to be exactly the way God said it to be amen just like we talked about when the priest went to the holies of holies every stitch on that garment had to be exactly Perfect by God's word or or when that man stepped behind there he was dead the Rope around him and he fell dead they'd just pull him out because anybody else stepped behind there was just as dead as he was right Amanda had to be just exactly the way God said it to be amen it's the same way praise the Lord but now look at a part of that was we'll start with verse 21. I just want to read a couple of verses of this to draw my point here Exodus 12 21 then Moses called for the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in uh in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the in the Basin and none of you shall go out at uh out at the door of this house until the morning for the Lord will pass through will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he when he seeth the blood upon the lentil and on the two side posts uh the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come in unto your houses to Smite you now look this something very simple now hissa hyssop there was is a very common simple weed that grew everywhere now I'll there's a point I want to make in this because I've heard it pre-stone before and talked about how common and simple and all that this was with the with the commonality and the Simplicity that we talk about the gospel is but I want us to understand today that the hyssop was something that was so common there wasn't anybody that couldn't go child or adult that couldn't go and grab a handful of history and bring it back home anybody could get it it was for everybody it was very it was a very common Bush that was readily available my point being God will never ask anything of you or anybody a child or or an unbeliever he'll never ask anybody anything that is unattainable through their means he never will if God asks something of you and and we'll just say even the common salvation through Jesus Christ has to be attainable to every single person or God's not a just God right it has to be readily available it has to be simple enough that a that an eight-year-old that Jesus would take on his lap that could understand believe it has to be simple enough that anybody could attain it could get to it it has to be something that that God is not going to make something so hard and so difficult and so complicated that only a handful of people can understand he's not gonna make it that way I told you before back it was kind of a big thing back in the uh early 90s late 80s early 90s go to uh uh meetings uh back when we were raising our children there was meetings all the time we me and my wife were in church almost all the time uh I was usually either at work or in a meeting sometimes we were at home but most of the time we were out we were at church or I was at work one or the other and we'd go to meetings a lot and hear a lot of different ministers and enjoyed a lot of the ministers and and but I I had a few that my wife and I part way through it would just look at each other and I just shake my head maybe I can't remember for sure it's been you're challenged an old man's mind but 35 years ago 40 years ago look and say I don't know preacher I'm sorry I still don't know but come outside the service and I and I just came on my heart I asked people say they're shouting and they're celebrating they're enjoying the the Lord and and we're spinning I said man that was a great service yeah that was a great service and what did he say I don't know but it was so good I literally had people tell me that you know trying to find maybe I there's something wrong with me maybe I need more of God or something I I'm missing a revelation something somewhere and I go outside and say yeah that was a great that was a great message what did he say I don't know but it was tremendous literally that is I know it sounds funny but that's the truth amen the people they they just were so called so caught up in the emotion and the intellect of of this deepness that they were diving and talking about it it was so confusing I thought if there's if I'm confused a minister of how do these people how are these children it just it's just lost God is not going to make it to where it's not attainable for anybody right right amen no many many people refuse it but he's not going to make it to where they couldn't get it if they wanted to it's attainable for everybody just like they hit some hyssop was there it was a common weed it was a simple weed it was all over the place anybody anytime could go get Hessa God didn't say go use this bush that you got to climb up this mountain and take a 10-day journey to come back to to try to use to put this Blood it's a specific certain no no it's just all over the place just take a bunch of it and dip it in the blood there it is it's that simple it wasn't complicated and it was something that children could understand which was important because a lot of those children in there were first born and they would have been struck with death but it was so simple that they could understand now you might say well why is God doing that well not a lot of times I can't explain that I don't know why God does the way he does a lot of times but it's not my it's not me to have to understand or explain why all I know is he does it I believe it and that's done it for me amen I just accepted because he's God he can do and say whatever he wants amen salvation deliverance and it's going to be something it is that that any common person can understand that's God hiding Amen in the wisdom of man and revealing in the wisdom of the word to those who would believe to those who would receive it he had won revealed to the other praise the Lord now I got one more scripture I want to read uh before we uh close the service today uh revelation let's go over Revelations chapter 12 for a moment amen listen this why are you going Revelation while you're going to Revelation chapter 12. let um let me read this to you they put the god hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same this was the one in Jeffersonville not the one in Albuquerque the one that brother Branham preached after the seals he preached in Albuquerque New Mexico not Jeffersonville uh this one though however comes from the one in Jeffersonville before the seals now excuse me now they thought they thought that now this is the Simplicity of God God revealing himself in Simplicity maybe I sure read this other scripture first but uh this little cracked up child and he's talking about Jesus of course as they as the world looked Upon Jesus this as this little cracked up child any illegitimate child is kind of an odd Curious Thing anyhow and there you are and he's again he's talking about Jesus see but God and we know dear we know that's not true but that's the way the world looked upon Him amen that's what brother Rams referring to is the way the world would have looked Upon Jesus uh but God hiding himself listen God hiding himself in what was thought of the world as filth the world Christ they considered filth God hiding hid himself in that praise the Lord hiding himself in what the world called filth corruption illegitimate God hides himself in the corruption of the of a dead seed and brings forth life Corruption of a dead sea the Bible Luke chapter 2. now this is what I want to pull out of Revelation 12 today Luke 2 now 7. God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself Luke 2 7 and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end now does that sound like almighty God coming to Earth to rescue all of his people because that's who he came to yeah yeah that's who he told his disciples he said you go to the he said I've been sent for the lost sheep of the House of Israel amen he told that woman called her a dog he called her a doctor and she said well at least the dogs eat the crumbs off their master's table that woman had such Faith Jesus gave she got what she wanted amen Jesus just told her you're going to go home and find your your daughter well look at this Faith he didn't pronounce her well he just said you're gonna go find her well when you get home praise the Lord amen but he made it clear he wasn't sent to the Gentile he was sent to the wall sheep of the house Israel that Jesus himself became so simple God himself so simple that he brought himself on this planet so insignificant woman in an insignificant family to be wrapped in swaddling cloths probably as brother Brown said to a cloth off the back of a sweaty old oxen that they wrapped him in and sat in there on a manure Pile in the middle of a Manger God almighty and yet we want to make it just this great no wonder the Jews missed it amen and we're looking for it in a completely different way But as God called each one they saw it just like this just like we read the other day the story the uh of the woman at the well she came up and all added this a couple of things she said I you this is the man she she went told the whole city this is the man we've been looking for amen come see him this is Jesus revealing himself a god revealing himself in such a simple way the world people can't see it it do it the same today amen look Revelation 12 verse 1. and I'll finish with this and there appeared a great wonder I just wanted to begin at the first verse so their appear there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman who we know is the Orthodox Church Israel a woman called with the son which basically represents the gospel church coming into existence the Sun the light because This Woman's about to give birth and she's about to give birth to God Amen the Sun and the Moon under her feet which the moon represents the Law so is she standing on the law the law is fading away the law is going away because the Son of God is about to come forth amen amen the law under her feet she's clothed with the sun now the gospel forth the Gospel Church coming forth the moon under her feet the Old Law passing away and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars which represents the Twelve Apostles of course again coming forth as Jesus comes forth on the earth it's a preparing of and a bringing forth of the Son of God Jesus Christ and she and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads ten horns seven crowns upon his head that's the devil we went through this earlier that's Satan the devil the great red dragon and his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven his preaching his ministry his message drew a third part of the Stars the angels fallen angels as brother Adam called Fallen Angels drew the third part of the stars of heaven and then cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before this woman which was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as it was born that Satan getting in Harry now remember this kind of goes into the next message but remember Satan will always look for someone that he can work in yeah yeah he's always continually he's got his minions out his deceived Angels out to try to do his work to find someone in any way that he could work in and work through especially people of of influence he's trying especially to get people to have any influence over another group of people or over a large group of people or something like that that's why you see in here all this stuff out in the world today amen all the great people all the all the people that they look up to sports stars and movie stars and and all these people that I think is really kind of ironic that they call the movie stars but anyway because we're talking about the stars that were deceived but movie stars and sports are all this that has influenced other other people amen you know I'm saying this this sin this degradation this this evil spirit that's gotten on people to think that things are okay the way they do them today amen that is seeing influence over other people and that's what the Satan Satan is looking continually to try to find somebody he can work in obviously here he found Herod he was able to work in and through Herod and it is working through Herod Herod made a decree that all those child two and under would be killed murdered I believe it was two and under well sometimes I get this one in the story with Moses mixed together uh to be murdered to be killed to be slaughtered amen but God told these major Amen to tell Herod because they were warned God warned them amen tell them a lie and that's basically what it was just tell them a mistruth but amen so that he would know he wouldn't be able and in no way see now as Herod was there Satan through Herod they're trying to kill Jesus the moment he's born just like it says here ready to Devour the child as soon as it was born Aaron was there to try to destroy Jesus the minute he was born amen but God again just like he does his children continue to protect and to keep Jesus all along Amen to where he was able to as you'd say slipped through the cracks through Supernatural means that we could go on and on about Magi is just part of it that God used to be able to help Jesus as again we'd say slipped through the cracks so that Hera was unable to give to him Herod could not get to him and he moved Joseph here and he moved him here and well was he from Nazareth was he from Bethlehem was he God moving them were Herod could not get to him and Herod was unable to kill him but you know here in the scripture see because remember sin did not start on the earth in the Garden of Eden no sin started in heaven right right this message right here that Satan preached we go over to uh Isaiah again we find where Satan desired to be exalted just like God to be lifted up above the stars above the heavens Amen to be like the most hot not realizing that God is going to have a children that's like him on this Earth right now amen no wonder brother Adam said that all the Adam possess God's gift to this bride he could speak he could name he could say oh praise the Lord but she does it based on the authority of God not on her will but on his will we read that last week it's according to his good pleasure not mine so he we do that have that Authority but but the power without the character is satanic but God gives it's not given the power to someone who doesn't have the character to be able to use it amen use it properly Herod is there ready to devour this child Herod through the devil through Herod is trying to take this child and you know when Satan got to Earth he found someone he could work in amen I'm bleeding into the next service again I'm sorry but he found somebody he could work in that was the serpent so the serpent could go and tell a mistruth to Eve he took everything got her to doubt the word as first thing he does thanks is to get you to doubt the word he's got to get you to doubt if there's ever any kind of an inkling of Doubt of God's word Satan can use that Satan used that doubt in Eve to get her to do what she did right amen done the same here he found Herod and he was going to use Herod to kill Jesus as soon as he was born [Music] but she brought forth a manshaw who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron now if you don't have any doubt that that was Jesus this tells it the only one scripturally who we know the rule with the rod of iron and her child was called up unto God into his throne and the woman fled let me just read through this again I'll be done and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she had a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score day now you know that's three and a half years amen typing perfectly back over to revelation 11. it's beautiful but I'm going to move on gets into the 70 weeks of Daniel as well and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragonfall in his angels and prevailed not neither was there found Place anymore in heaven a place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan would deceive it the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice sing in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of God and and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brothers cast down which accused him before our God day and night they do the exact same thing today Saints and they overcame him praise the Lord which is it overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the Dead praise the Lord how to be overcome him today that's that exact same way by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony I have overcome that's why it's so very important that we watch what we say and we watch what we talk about amen have obviously a lot of that and those of you who have read my book the words that we State say how powerful they are amen that's why we always try to stay as positive speak as positive amen now God is simply now this is the god in Simplicity in Albuquerque this God makes you act funny even if you look like a Weathervane standing on the top of a building but as long as it's God doing it why it's all right what difference does it make it might take some of the well he says it Baptist Theological training out of you but as long as God is doing it he reveals himself in simplicity that preacher knows more about uh that preacher know more about God coming off the top of that house than learning all the years he went to school amen God reveals himself in Simplicity and shows himself in power hiding himself then showing himself the same mechanism want to see how simple you can get not how smart you can get but how simple you can get amen amen one more go away Jesus the Bible said just before the Andalusian destruction Jesus said so will it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of Noah there were giants in the earth they were giants great statue of men and today there is intellectual Giants but it's all say I didn't come with great swelling words of man's Wisdom there is men who are old Great Men great powerful men they know they know the Greek just like in the Hebrew and everything can set it all together so intellectual but where is that Revival where is the god that's burning on the heart of the human being not how intellectual it is it takes Simplicity to bring the power of God Amen humility amen the power of God is in humility yeah us the revelation of God is in humility God's Not Looking for the smart the haughty the the educated he's looking for those that are the simple not that you can't have an education obviously there's nothing wrong with that amen but if your education takes you further away from God then you ditch that education and you take God yes amen that's where the problem comes in but God is still revealing himself to his people brother Brown said he'll be revealing things to us down through eternity so how could we even begin to think that we know everything now right amen amen there's no way to know what bring the god the god truth to the Next Generation if the generation is coming if there is one uh that's up to the Lord I was going to say I hope there isn't but that's up to him amen whatever his will is that that's what we all want is the will of the Lord then he's still going to continue to hide himself and reveal himself in Simplicity in the same Simplicity that he's always done amen amen God does it for us to be able to see and thank God he doesn't because friend I'd be out a long time ago if I had to be some great intellect to be able to see it I had to be some great intellect to be able to preach this word I'd be long gone I'd have been gone years ago amen thank God it doesn't take that amen faith believing trusting God revealing living believing that word God continues to reveal it because it's still simple today as he's always been yes amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could it's the same way God always does to bring back what I said earlier is the reason that so many people can't see it today amen it's hid and revealed I look at it and I see the reveal part I thank God that God reveals it but it's also the hid part God doesn't just reveal it but he hides it too amen and in that Simplicity is where God shows it and reveals it to us amen I'm so thankful he does just something is simple as as the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ that people even look on I've even heard in the message friends I I hate to say it that way but it's just truth that people try to do away with the blood I think how could you the very fundamental Foundation of our belief and and the blood that Jesus shed for us for this for our salvation for the Forgiveness of sins amen the stripes he took for our healing that people could do away with that oh amen I I'm I'm thankful that through that simple Act amen that God that we talked about for several weeks God showed us in Genesis amen Genesis 3 21. when he's when he took the Lambs and he slew them threw them in the same thing God's showing us it was the blood of an innocent one it's so simple people don't want to receive it there was I was talking with a couple guys that worked last week and and and this thing came up about about I don't know wasn't really Cults but just this the crazy things that people believe today and the crazy things like religion-ish type things that people hold on to and and I just looked and I said why why would someone what is so great about this that they would cling to instead of something as so simple as believing Jesus Christ and they looked and agreed with me and said I I said I don't understand it either one guy said yeah just believing in Christ and accepting Jesus as your savior I said exactly right and again these are people look these are men that don't even go to church that I know of now what I'm I told you the ones quit drinking I told you I was talking about his head the other day he wants to get back in church now but um it just when I look at it it baffles me why everyone would want to believe anything all this other stuff out here in the world today they're so quick to grab a hold and believe crystals and whatever I don't want to point one out but and and and negate the Simplicity of just Jesus Christ and his blood amen amen I think it's just sometimes I think it's just too simple for some people to receive right to believe they think it's just got to be something greater or more higher revelated something it's got to be something else that people um won't believe amen but it is just that simple Saints and again I'm glad it's that simple praise the Lord let's sing This Little Chorus before we go today 4 24 so glad I'm Yours Lord amen so glad I'm Yours Lord praise the Lord Michael probably find it for us here we probably all know it though amen praise the Lord Jesus are you glad you belong to him yes amen

glad I'm Yours today [Music] the devil in the world seems to have so much to offer Saints but I'm so glad I belong to him yes amen the world may not know it but what God has to offer is far beyond anything that the devil could even try to offer amen praise the Lord Jesus so thankful for that so thankfully he's made it so simple that I could that I could receive it and it would become a part of who I am in my life amen now it's just now it's not just a part of my life it is my life amen it is all who I am praise the Lord Jesus God bless you today pray something was said to bless and

be able to go and do again things have changed up there the transit chains prices Chains It's uh it's kind of a little bit of different experience but all the things we went and saw was we enjoyed
