[32:12] arm
[32:12] to
[32:14] mail up the street and I was just just a
[32:17] short walk
[32:18] and when I got there I only had one on
[32:21] one letter
[32:23] so I looked all I went all the way back
[32:26] home and looked all along the way and I
[32:28] told people if they saw them when they
[32:30] placed you know let me know you know
[32:33] I don't know how they would do that
[32:35] because I'm a pedestrian and I'm walking
[32:37] up and down the street as all those bus
[32:38] stops I get home there's nothing there
[32:41] I've come I walk back
[32:44] and I get to the bus stop and this is
[32:48] where the post office at least mail the
[32:50] one envelope that I have
[32:52] and there's money in them well there's
[32:54] money in one there's an IOU for the 28th
[32:58] to my stepson in prison and and when I
[33:03] got to the bus stop this young man is
[33:05] home in all of them
[33:06] well one of them is opened it's the one
[33:09] to Enoch
[33:10] and I said I'll send you some money on
[33:13] the 28th
[33:15] and he figured since there was no money
[33:18] in it I guess he really figured he
[33:20] wasn't going to open any of the rest of
[33:21] them
[33:23] ten dollars in one of them
[33:27] and so I went in and I rewarded him for
[33:30] with five dollars and I mailed my stuff
[33:33] at the post office and when I got when I
[33:37] got back to doing my step later in the
[33:40] evening
[33:42] I found a dollar in the street and this
[33:46] when I was in the store getting money to
[33:49] put the ten dollars in my for my
[33:52] granddaughter I wanted a new bill
[33:54] and the man turned around and he said
[33:58] well obviously I gotta get some change
[34:00] because the cashier didn't have a new
[34:02] dollar ten dollar bill
[34:04] so he got changed and they turned around
[34:07] and he gave me the 10 Bill and so I
[34:09] handed him he wouldn't take it and so
[34:12] the lord gave me ten eleven dollars that
[34:16] came with this so I just want to thank
[34:19] him and then I got twenty dollars at the
[34:22] um for missing core batteries at
[34:26] O'Reilly's that they couldn't account
[34:29] for and they gave me a gift card for

[44:26] you may have eventually come to find it
[44:28] out but what a powerful what a powerful
[44:31] message praise the Lord amen let's down
[44:34] to our feet if we could
[44:35] and I'm going to turn into the scripture
[44:37] to Saint John today
[44:39] Saint John chapter 1.
[44:44] I mean sometimes I don't mind saying
[44:46] that sometimes when you go year after
[44:48] year you uh I get to the place you get
[44:52] to the place where Lord what would be a
[44:55] good Christmas message
[44:58] um
[44:59] we know the word is eternal we know that
[45:02] God is eternal and
[45:04] you keep
[45:07] finding out or looking long enough or
[45:09] expecting the Lord to speak to you and
[45:10] to usually
[45:12] give something to your heart to to let
[45:15] you know but you get into it you think
[45:17] well it's Christmas and I've spoke on
[45:20] that and I spoke on that and I've spoke
[45:21] on that we've gone that way and we've
[45:24] gone that way we've used that scripture
[45:25] and we've used that scripture amen but
[45:28] the Lord showed me something a little
[45:29] bit different today so it won't be
[45:32] different in so much that it won't be
[45:34] something that you haven't heard before
[45:35] but just different I guess as far as
[45:38] Christmas message is concerned but Saint
[45:40] John chapter 1 uh we'll redefer a few
[45:43] verses of scripture here but before we
[45:45] do let's just buy our heads for another
[45:47] word of Prayer
[45:49] and Lord Jesus we're so thankful father
[45:51] again for another beautiful day thank
[45:53] you for life and health and strength and
[45:55] thank you for this word Lord thank you
[45:58] God for sending your only begotten son
[46:00] thank you Jesus for coming into this
[46:02] world and giving your life shedding your
[46:04] blood and uh and redeeming your people
[46:07] back to yourself
[46:09] thank you Lord that we know that if you
[46:11] had not uh born you could not have lived
[46:14] if you had not lived you could not have
[46:16] died if you had not died you couldn't
[46:18] come back and give us the Holy Spirit
[46:20] and now live in us that it could be
[46:23] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[46:25] and forever in our mortal bodies in our
[46:28] life Lord and this time that we live and
[46:31] Lord just shine that light that
[46:33] continues to shine up our pathway let it
[46:35] continue to grow greater and greater
[46:38] Lord as the world is growing darker and
[46:40] darker Lord let the blessings of the
[46:43] Lord shine upon this congregation upon
[46:46] this service today right now father and
[46:48] anoint these lips anoint our ears and
[46:51] let you establish and accomplish
[46:52] whatever you'd have to be done Lord for
[46:55] this time we committed to you Lord and
[46:57] ask your blessings upon it now and we
[47:00] give you glory honor and praise for all
[47:02] that is said and done in the name of the
[47:03] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[47:08] I'll read one verse in to let you be
[47:10] seated really the verse that I'm going
[47:12] to draw the tech context from for our
[47:14] text today the word was made flesh and
[47:17] dwelt among us we beheld his glory the
[47:19] glory is of the only begotten of the
[47:21] father full of grace and truth you can
[47:25] be seated if you'd like
[47:28] I mean I I did have a testimony that
[47:31] came back on my heart that I did want to
[47:33] mention I told you that the trip was
[47:35] good and everything went real well and
[47:37] it did and the Lord blessed and uh of
[47:40] course it's very old again got a lot of
[47:42] snow I sent pictures to the family I
[47:44] guess we were going to lunch on
[47:46] Wednesday Thursday we were stepping in
[47:48] our feet were going down about that deep
[47:51] so we got a good amount of snow but it
[47:53] stayed a little warmish so the roads
[47:55] stayed okay and of course we're used to
[47:57] that kind of thing but going back uh
[47:59] we're about an hour and a half drive
[48:01] from the airport where the job was so in
[48:05] going back on Friday night
[48:08] um you know we had to take the the
[48:10] interstate to get back to the hotel to
[48:12] get back to the hotel by the airport to
[48:14] leave out the next morning well most of
[48:17] the road coming down one Interstate was
[48:19] good I passed a uh
[48:22] a plow truck and he was just cooking
[48:26] along because there wasn't really
[48:27] anything to scrape and the road was
[48:28] pretty nice and I was moving along about
[48:30] the speed limit but then you have to get
[48:33] a transition onto this other what is a
[48:35] loop really around Minneapolis uh it's
[48:38] 494 I think
[48:40] and once I got on that and it goes and
[48:43] comes to a press and it kind of goes
[48:45] down the hill and after I got on that I
[48:46] was clipping along about the same and
[48:48] the car just started moving around if
[48:51] you've ever tried to driven on Ice you
[48:53] know what it feels like when you're
[48:55] going so fast that the friction of the
[48:57] tire is not hitting the road you just
[49:00] kind of not in danger but you can just
[49:02] feel uh you're you're not in control
[49:05] anymore as long as you're going straight
[49:07] you're okay so of course I let off the
[49:09] gas about that time I come over the hill
[49:11] and I started backing awful there was a
[49:14] a semi that had he was going 80 miles an
[49:18] hour I mean he was
[49:19] blasting and he was coming so fast I was
[49:22] looking around rearview mirror and I
[49:23] looked up ahead of me and it went down
[49:25] the hill up a little bit and up ahead
[49:27] there was a bunch of cars there was
[49:29] nobody around me which I was thankful
[49:32] for but I was going down the hill I
[49:34] looked up and there was red lights just
[49:37] coming on everywhere and I saw this
[49:39] white car and it was fishtailing and it
[49:41] was turning sideways and I thought oh my
[49:43] he's just getting ready to buy this old
[49:46] line of cars and uh I don't and I'm
[49:50] watching that while I'm watching this
[49:51] semi come barreling down in the lane
[49:53] next to me at 80. another car ahead of
[49:56] me gets over to try to avoid that he's
[49:58] only going 50 maybe I thought this this
[50:02] this semi is going to kill somebody
[50:04] because he was and I absolutely to this
[50:07] day I said Lord help them the white car
[50:10] straightened up and everything kept
[50:12] going the truck was able to slow down
[50:14] without killing all those people up
[50:16] there and we just kept right on going
[50:18] yeah everything thing just kind of
[50:20] slowed down a lot but everything just
[50:23] started flowing right after that point
[50:25] everything just started flowing and it
[50:27] flowed all that way to the hotel so I
[50:30] wanted to give God thanks for that
[50:32] because a million things could go wrong
[50:34] in this situation like that because
[50:36] every car was on the same situation I
[50:38] was under and if my car was floating
[50:41] around on the ice I knew everybody else
[50:43] was including that semi so it doesn't
[50:46] matter you got four wheel 10 wheel
[50:48] 12-wheel drive if you don't have a tank
[50:50] or a bulldozer or pipe spikes on your
[50:53] wheels you don't control a car on Ice
[50:56] you just don't so but the Lord
[50:59] controlled them this car one minute he
[51:02] was I literally he was like this and the
[51:05] next minute he was straight and
[51:07] yeah all the brake lights went away and
[51:10] everything just kept going and
[51:12] everything was in there and it was all
[51:13] smooth from there on they hit a few more
[51:15] it was a few more icy spots around but
[51:18] everything flowed good from there and I
[51:21] thank the Lord all of us of our crew uh
[51:23] we had three or four different Vehicles
[51:26] everybody made it to the hotel safe and
[51:28] everything was good so I wanted to give
[51:30] God thanks and praise for that amen so
[51:34] um the the message I wanted to speak on
[51:36] today of course the Christmas message
[51:38] was the word made flesh or the word was
[51:41] made flesh uh Jesus Christ that flesh
[51:45] body coming forth through as Micah just
[51:48] sang the instrument that God chose whose
[51:51] name was Mary but let's go back to the
[51:53] first verse and let's read the beginning
[51:55] at the first verse I want to read
[51:56] through to the 14th verse again but of
[51:58] course again my context for the text is
[52:01] taken out of the 14th verse the word was
[52:04] made flesh amen the word was made flesh
[52:07] which is the time title of our message
[52:09] today
[52:10] but verse 1 says in the beginning was
[52:13] the word the word was with God we don't
[52:16] know that word word is the logos that
[52:19] word that came that that came out of God
[52:21] uh the word was uh was with God and the
[52:25] Word was God a lot of people try to make
[52:28] a trinity out of this scripture as they
[52:30] do a couple of others but this is simply
[52:32] saying that God Elohim is the almighty
[52:35] God and from him issued forth everything
[52:38] that God had thought spoke imagined came
[52:41] forth that he desired to come forth in
[52:44] this logos from that logos going forth
[52:47] came the Earth came the sun came the
[52:49] moon came the uh the the night and day
[52:52] all of creation uh came Melchizedek that
[52:56] logos in that word became flesh in Jesus
[52:59] Christ who we know became Our Savior
[53:02] amen as the Kinsmen Redeemer
[53:05] that word was uh and the Word was uh the
[53:08] Word was God
[53:10] the same so that just that just makes
[53:12] him the Elohim God the same was in the
[53:15] beginning the same was in the beginning
[53:17] with God
[53:18] all things were made by him and without
[53:21] him was not anything made that was made
[53:24] in him was life
[53:27] and the life was the light of men the
[53:29] light the life was the light of men and
[53:32] the light that shines forth is that
[53:34] truth of the logos that light is the
[53:38] truth that shines forth that light
[53:40] brings Revelation that light brings life
[53:44] it's the ability to see is what it is if
[53:47] it's pretty that it's really very simple
[53:49] when you think even from the spiritual
[53:51] to the Natural aspect that if you walk
[53:54] into a dark building you can't see
[53:56] unless you turn on the light the light
[53:58] gives the ability to see Jesus Christ
[54:02] came God Almighty in the form of of
[54:05] human flesh to bring light so that
[54:08] humans could see by Revelation who he is
[54:11] who the word is amen he came forth to do
[54:15] that that's why that he asked his
[54:17] disciples who do uh men say that I am
[54:21] they ask him who what are they see and
[54:24] then he asked them what are you seeing
[54:26] what light is shining to you because the
[54:29] light Jesus Christ was shining right
[54:32] there the truth was there amen just like
[54:35] he told a pilot and pilate said what is
[54:39] truth you're looking truth in the eye
[54:42] the truth is not a statement the truth
[54:45] is not even presenting something in a
[54:47] correct a posture truth is a person and
[54:50] that person is Jesus Christ who was the
[54:53] light that brought life that brought
[54:55] Revelation for the ability to be able to
[54:58] see amen and that's very important to
[55:01] understand because of what the rest of
[55:03] it is and I thank God for the ability to
[55:06] be able to see right not just with these
[55:08] eyes but with the spiritual life through
[55:10] the I said that God give to be able to
[55:12] see who he is through the revelation of
[55:16] his word amen but
[55:19] um there was it's not all that for
[55:23] everybody in him was like the life was
[55:26] the light of men
[55:28] and the light shineth in darkness and
[55:31] the Darkness comprehended it not the
[55:34] darkness comprehended it not there was a
[55:36] man sent from God whose name was John
[55:38] the same came for a witness to Bear
[55:40] witness of the light that all men
[55:42] through him might believe now William
[55:45] Branham John the Baptist were not that
[55:47] light but they came to bear witness of
[55:50] that life so that through them there
[55:52] might be a a word spoken that God would
[55:56] use in those human flesh to bring forth
[55:59] a revelation of light to men amen that
[56:02] others through them might believe he was
[56:05] not that light John the Baptist was not
[56:08] that light William Branham was not that
[56:11] light he was not Jesus Christ right but
[56:14] he was sent by God to Bear witness of
[56:16] that life amen amen that others through
[56:19] that witness might believe amen praise
[56:22] the Lord
[56:23] to Bear witness of that like that was
[56:25] that was the True Light which lighteth
[56:29] every man that cometh into the world he
[56:31] was in the world and the world was made
[56:33] by him and the world knew him not
[56:36] he came in unto his own and his own
[56:38] received him not but as many as received
[56:41] him to them gave he power to become the
[56:44] sons of God even to them that believe on
[56:47] his name which were born not of blood
[56:49] nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will
[56:51] of man but of God we are of God Little
[56:54] Children amen and the Word was made
[56:57] flesh praise the Lord It's Made flesh in
[57:00] the body of Jesus Christ dwelled Among
[57:03] Us and we beheld his glory the Glorious
[57:06] of the only begotten of the father full
[57:08] of grace and truth but not everybody is
[57:11] of that truth look in Saint John 3 16
[57:14] for God so loved the world he gave his
[57:16] only begotten son the whosoever should
[57:18] believeth in him should not perish but
[57:19] have everlasting life right because of
[57:22] that light they believed the light amen
[57:26] but the darkness could not comprehend
[57:28] the light now if you're not if you drop
[57:31] down to uh well let's just keep reading
[57:33] for God sent not his son into the world
[57:36] to condemn the world but through that
[57:38] but that the world through him might be
[57:39] saved he that believeth on him is not
[57:42] condemned but he that believeth not is
[57:44] condemned already because he hath not
[57:46] believed in the name of the only
[57:48] begotten a Son of God and this is the
[57:51] condemnation that light is coming to the
[57:54] world Jesus and Men loved Darkness
[57:57] rather than light the men loved the
[58:00] darkness because the darkness
[58:02] comprehended not the light they rejected
[58:05] the light because they light the
[58:07] darkness better why would that why would
[58:10] anybody like Darkness better than light
[58:13] you look at the world today and you see
[58:15] the darkness going on around in the
[58:17] world today you look at how everybody
[58:19] seems to enjoy your life the darkness
[58:21] more than the light
[58:23] uh
[58:25] it was it was strange to me when you
[58:27] look around and you see how prevalent
[58:30] it's becoming that uh through cartoons
[58:34] and and uh science fiction and things
[58:38] like that that people are starting to
[58:41] celebrate more the villain than they are
[58:44] the good guy right he used to be back in
[58:46] my day or back in the western day and
[58:48] the bad guy wore a black hat
[58:51] white the the good guy wore a white hat
[58:53] and the bad guy wore black hat I don't
[58:55] know is that stereotypical is that
[58:56] racist but
[58:59] people can say what they want about it
[59:01] but the truth is the light is Jesus it
[59:05] brings forth light the darkness is black
[59:07] is is something that the men could not
[59:10] comprehend because they like the
[59:12] darkness better than the line and even
[59:14] more now you see again the the bad
[59:18] things or the the evil things are
[59:21] celebrated as much or more now than the
[59:23] guy is right
[59:24] I it's just crazy to understand but it's
[59:27] true uh the even like Disney and stuff
[59:30] they have they have something I I
[59:32] believe uh that that kind of
[59:36] encapsulates all the villains that have
[59:39] been uh made up of all these characters
[59:42] in these cartoons
[59:44] and you celebrate the villain really I
[59:47] don't I don't want to celebrate a
[59:49] villain I don't want to celebrate
[59:50] Darkness right I want to celebrate life
[59:54] so it makes me wonder why do people like
[59:56] Darkness more than light well it tells
[59:59] us
[1:00:01] the world uh this is kind of light is
[1:00:04] coming to the world men love Darkness
[1:00:05] rather than light because their deeds
[1:00:08] were evil
[1:00:10] their deeds were evil that's why they
[1:00:12] like Darkness more than lion because
[1:00:14] their deeds are evil if your Deeds are
[1:00:16] evil you want your deed your evil Deeds
[1:00:19] to stay hidden you want them to stay
[1:00:21] under a cover you want them to stay in
[1:00:23] darkness you want to stay in anonymity
[1:00:25] because you don't want to become known
[1:00:27] as that that's that that is evil or have
[1:00:31] evil works or evil Deeds so what do you
[1:00:34] want you want it to stay covered you
[1:00:36] want it to stay in darkness you don't
[1:00:37] want anybody to know about it you want
[1:00:39] anybody to talk about it you don't want
[1:00:41] anybody to bring it up you want it to
[1:00:42] stay in the darkness see and that's the
[1:00:45] same thing that that world because
[1:00:47] people men love Darkness rather than
[1:00:50] light because they're Deeds are evil and
[1:00:52] they want the Deeds to stay in the dark
[1:00:54] they don't want people to know that your
[1:00:57] that their deeds are evil amen and thus
[1:01:00] they like Darkness rather than light for
[1:01:03] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:01:05] light neither cometh to the light lest
[1:01:08] his deeds should be reproved if people
[1:01:10] say what an evil person they really are
[1:01:13] what an evil system it really is so they
[1:01:16] try to everything they can to keep it in
[1:01:19] the dark amen and I don't mean to get
[1:01:22] political this is a Christmas message
[1:01:24] but I believe that's one thing that the
[1:01:26] Lord allowed for Donald Trump to come
[1:01:29] become president
[1:01:30] uh whatever you think of them whatever
[1:01:32] kind of prayers he was or whatever we
[1:01:34] got now that doesn't matter that it is
[1:01:36] what it is the Lord's letting whatever
[1:01:37] happened he raised them up and he puts
[1:01:39] them down right but there's one thing I
[1:01:41] do know he shot a lot of light on a lot
[1:01:43] of Darkness
[1:01:45] amen that just the Lord allows them to
[1:01:47] do what they do and they do what they do
[1:01:49] and and we we all knew how corrupt it
[1:01:53] all was and how the system was how
[1:01:54] corrupt and evil it was but it's become
[1:01:57] more exposed nowadays and actually they
[1:01:59] don't even seem to care
[1:02:03] they're complicit in the whole thing
[1:02:05] they love Darkness amen I'm not talking
[1:02:07] about any specific person
[1:02:10] system
[1:02:11] the system is of the devil and the devil
[1:02:14] is evil amen praise the Lord and you can
[1:02:17] say that even about the church world you
[1:02:19] could say that about the nominational
[1:02:20] world and the religious system it's it's
[1:02:23] the religious system is of the devil
[1:02:25] the system came from Satan and his
[1:02:29] Darkness
[1:02:30] but people people don't mind being in a
[1:02:34] system of Darkness because they can live
[1:02:37] any way they want
[1:02:39] they can live and operate in their evil
[1:02:41] Deeds because the system doesn't expose
[1:02:44] it the system doesn't preach about Sin
[1:02:47] this system doesn't expose sinful acts
[1:02:51] and evil evil works so they like it they
[1:02:55] like Darkness rather than life
[1:02:57] people gone this morning and they're
[1:02:59] filling them up by the tens of thousands
[1:03:01] amen but Jesus Christ is light
[1:03:04] amen Jesus Christ is light to bring
[1:03:07] light to bring Revelation to bring life
[1:03:09] to men praise the Lord
[1:03:12] but he didn't do it the truth cometh to
[1:03:15] the light praise the Lord
[1:03:17] that his deeds may be made manifest that
[1:03:20] they are wrought in God
[1:03:22] amen that's the godliness that's God's
[1:03:25] people now why we see here Jesus came in
[1:03:29] flesh he came to bring light but there
[1:03:32] was a greater purpose even than or or or
[1:03:35] or or another purpose I'll say greater
[1:03:38] or lesser
[1:03:40] for the word becoming flesh
[1:03:43] God had already given us something to
[1:03:47] help us understand
[1:03:48] uh as a type or shadow of what his plan
[1:03:52] was to bring Redemption to men
[1:03:54] and it was called the Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:03:57] Jesus had to be born
[1:04:00] to come as a kinsman redeemer to become
[1:04:04] Kinfolk to us he could not come and
[1:04:06] redeem us in the state that he was in
[1:04:09] amen he could not come to redeem us in
[1:04:12] the almighty God encompassing all space
[1:04:15] Time and Eternity because we're all
[1:04:17] inhuman flesh he himself had to become
[1:04:21] in human flesh to redeem our human flesh
[1:04:24] and flesh thus Jesus had to be born to
[1:04:27] become a a a a kid's memory gamer to us
[1:04:32] praise the Lord let's go to Ruth chapter
[1:04:35] three we'll look at this just for a few
[1:04:37] moments that kinsman redeemer that he
[1:04:40] become flesh he had to be born there had
[1:04:44] to be a
[1:04:45] well I'll just say there had to be a
[1:04:48] Christmas
[1:04:49] there had to be a day
[1:04:51] amen most people celebrate December 25th
[1:04:55] we know that it wasn't December 25th
[1:04:57] that Jesus was born we celebrated as
[1:05:00] such we also know that again I'll say
[1:05:03] this as I've done the past few
[1:05:04] Christmases we also know that you look
[1:05:06] out go down the road and you see all
[1:05:08] these nativity scenes with the three
[1:05:10] wise men and their gifts giving Jesus
[1:05:12] gifts in a Manger
[1:05:14] there's no such thing happen in the
[1:05:16] scripture amen No Such Thing Shepherds
[1:05:19] came and found him in a Manger but the
[1:05:22] three wise men with the gift came Jesus
[1:05:25] was over two years old right yeah
[1:05:28] so by their Traditions they make the
[1:05:31] word of none effect right right amen
[1:05:33] because those those are incorrect if
[1:05:36] they have three wise men bringing gifts
[1:05:38] in a Manger uh in this nativity scene of
[1:05:42] them coming and giving because it's
[1:05:44] absolutely not scriptural
[1:05:46] amen right so we were we do remember
[1:05:49] that it's the tradition it's the system
[1:05:52] again
[1:05:54] but now Jesus again had to be born he
[1:05:58] had to be born Unfortunately today
[1:06:01] a lot of people a lot of people have
[1:06:04] Jesus in one or two places if at all
[1:06:07] they either have him still as a little
[1:06:09] baby in a Manger
[1:06:10] and that's what he is to them or he's
[1:06:12] some great mystical being that's out in
[1:06:15] the stratosphere somewhere that you
[1:06:17] can't feel or touch or know anything
[1:06:19] about
[1:06:20] there's some uh uh Untouchable
[1:06:23] unreachable beingness out there
[1:06:26] somewhere some mystical something see
[1:06:28] the god in in different so they can't
[1:06:31] bring Jesus into the humanity that he is
[1:06:34] that's my point into the humanities God
[1:06:37] in flesh that he was that he is and that
[1:06:40] he is in us still today it's still Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ and flesh just in you and me
[1:06:46] right but now this kinsman redeemer had
[1:06:49] to come Ruth uh chapter 3
[1:06:53] read a few verses of scripture here for
[1:06:55] beginning with the eighth verse now we
[1:06:57] all know the story I guess we know or
[1:06:59] familiarize ourselves somewhat to the
[1:07:01] story of Ruth
[1:07:03] um where Naomi had her her husband and
[1:07:06] two sons two sons married two daughters
[1:07:09] and uh they went to Moab and the sons
[1:07:12] the husband died the the sons died
[1:07:15] excuse me and and uh it came Naomi and
[1:07:19] uh Ruth and the other daughter-in-law I
[1:07:22] forget her name now and Oprah and they
[1:07:26] were so they came to a choice because
[1:07:28] Naomi said I I have nothing here left
[1:07:31] I'm going back to my homeland and she
[1:07:34] told them that they should just go and
[1:07:36] Ruth said no I'm gonna follow you Oprah
[1:07:39] just left she just stayed Moab but Ruth
[1:07:42] said I'm gonna stay with you wherever
[1:07:43] you go I'm gonna go whatever you do I'm
[1:07:46] gonna do whoever your God is is my God
[1:07:48] Amen and she went with her and she
[1:07:50] stayed with her and it come a time where
[1:07:54] Naomi taught Ruth the lesson of the
[1:07:58] kinsman redeemer because Kinsman act the
[1:08:00] Kinsmen Redeemer actually uh I forget
[1:08:03] which part it's in but it's in Exodus I
[1:08:05] believe it's before Ruth now the kinsman
[1:08:08] redeemer was set in place even before
[1:08:10] this was just a lesson of that kinsman
[1:08:12] redeemer and she began to teach truth
[1:08:14] about what the kinsman redeemer was and
[1:08:16] the process that it went through and she
[1:08:19] told that Ruth what she was to do
[1:08:21] because this man Boaz was a nearer
[1:08:24] Kinsman if he was a good man he was a
[1:08:27] rich man he was part of the family he
[1:08:28] was a part of the uh in relation to
[1:08:31] Naomi's husband and he was a near
[1:08:34] Kinsman to them and so he she gave her
[1:08:37] instruction to go and and make yourself
[1:08:39] known to this Boaz
[1:08:41] so she does it in the fields and uh the
[1:08:45] the young man of the fields kind of take
[1:08:47] a liking to her but she she shies away
[1:08:49] from all that and uh she does exactly
[1:08:52] what Naomi tells her to do and she stays
[1:08:55] right on the the path of redemption that
[1:08:58] Naomi had described to her and we get to
[1:09:01] the eighth verse now
[1:09:03] and it came to pass at midnight that the
[1:09:07] man was afraid Boaz was afraid and
[1:09:10] turned himself and behold a womanly at
[1:09:12] his feet that was Ruth and he said who
[1:09:16] art thou and she's answered I am Ruth
[1:09:18] thine handmade
[1:09:20] spread therefore thy skirt over thy
[1:09:22] handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and
[1:09:26] he said blessed be thou of the Lord my
[1:09:29] daughter for thou has showed the more
[1:09:32] kindness in the latter end than at the
[1:09:34] beginning in so much as thou followest
[1:09:36] not young men whether poor or Rich and
[1:09:40] now my daughter fear not
[1:09:42] I will do now look what Boaz is telling
[1:09:45] Ruth I will do to thee all that thou
[1:09:49] requires for all the city of my people
[1:09:52] doth know that thou art a virtuous woman
[1:09:56] and now it is true that I am a near
[1:09:58] Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman
[1:10:02] nearer than I do you know that there was
[1:10:05] a Kinsman to them nearer than Boaz
[1:10:09] amen Terry this night and it shall be in
[1:10:14] the morning that if he will perform unto
[1:10:16] thee the part of a Kinsmen well let him
[1:10:19] do the Kinsman part but if he will not
[1:10:22] do the Kinsmen uh the part of a Kinsmen
[1:10:25] to thee then will I do the part of a
[1:10:28] Kinsmen to thee as the Lord liveth lie
[1:10:31] down until the morning now Boaz has
[1:10:34] given her this instruction and this
[1:10:36] promise I am going to uh redeem you I am
[1:10:42] going to play that part of Kinsmen to
[1:10:46] redeem that part that I am the Kinsman
[1:10:48] of from the lineage of Naomi's husband
[1:10:51] I'm going to play that part and I'm
[1:10:55] going to redeem all that was his
[1:10:58] and and in redeeming all that was his he
[1:11:01] got also Ruth
[1:11:03] amen she came uh with the Redemption of
[1:11:09] what belonged to Naomi's husband and
[1:11:12] Naomi of course too she he was to play
[1:11:15] that near Kinsman Park but as Boaz said
[1:11:19] there was a near Kinsman two Boaz and so
[1:11:24] Boaz goes out in the next morning and in
[1:11:27] front of everybody he tells this man
[1:11:30] uh now I I am near Kinsmen and I'm ready
[1:11:34] to do the near Kinsmen work but you are
[1:11:37] a near Kinsman than I am listen now uh I
[1:11:42] I know it gets a little confusing when
[1:11:44] you're uh jumping from uh this point to
[1:11:47] this point but listen real close because
[1:11:49] we're we're getting to this point before
[1:11:52] I uh before I finish this up Boaz goes
[1:11:56] and talks to this near Kinsman
[1:12:00] and he tells us near Kinsmen now I will
[1:12:03] play the part of Kinsmen and redeem all
[1:12:06] that was his and all that was his will
[1:12:09] become mine because I am the near
[1:12:11] Kinsman to him and redeemed that
[1:12:14] inheritance to myself
[1:12:16] and the man said I will redeem that
[1:12:19] inheritance I will take control over
[1:12:22] that inheritance and that inheritance
[1:12:24] will become mine and Boaz said that's
[1:12:27] fine but you must understand that when
[1:12:30] you redeem all that is his all that is
[1:12:33] his comes with Ruth and Naomi you've got
[1:12:36] to redo you have to redeem Ruth as well
[1:12:39] and the man said I cannot do that
[1:12:43] I cannot redeem Ruth I cannot uh it
[1:12:48] would Mar my inheritance if I were to
[1:12:51] take this woman unto myself I cannot do
[1:12:54] that I can't do it without uh without
[1:12:57] affecting my own inheritance without
[1:12:59] affecting my own life and my own home I
[1:13:02] cannot do this
[1:13:04] and Boaz says well let it be known today
[1:13:07] and of course as you know then that day
[1:13:09] they would take off their shoe and beat
[1:13:11] it on the table and say let it be known
[1:13:13] right now in front of all the
[1:13:15] townspeople that I relinquish my rights
[1:13:17] to this inheritance and to Ruth
[1:13:21] I relinquish it now listen there was in
[1:13:26] that Kinsmen work that Jesus Paid For Us
[1:13:28] you realize that when Jesus came and was
[1:13:31] born into this Earth there was a near
[1:13:33] Kinsman that had rights over us first
[1:13:38] that was the devil yes right the devil
[1:13:42] had rights to us first how why would the
[1:13:45] devil have first rights or first divs on
[1:13:49] us because it was sold out to him in the
[1:13:52] Garden of Eden right remember when Adam
[1:13:55] fell he lost his inheritance in life he
[1:13:58] lost his inheritance to the Earth and he
[1:14:00] lost his inheritance in The Book of Life
[1:14:03] now we know it could not keep the book
[1:14:05] of life it had his dirty hands could not
[1:14:08] take it
[1:14:09] it had to go back in the hands of God
[1:14:12] again marring the devil's inheritance
[1:14:16] amen it would have marred his
[1:14:18] inheritance to take that book of life
[1:14:20] unto himself because that was the book
[1:14:23] of redemption right and Satan could not
[1:14:26] redeem anything right Satan could not
[1:14:29] come and die he could not take your sin
[1:14:32] upon himself because he was sin yes amen
[1:14:35] anything that is sin cannot take sin
[1:14:38] because he is sin so he could not take
[1:14:42] on that sin without marring his
[1:14:45] inheritance so he couldn't take the book
[1:14:48] of Redemption how could he redeem well
[1:14:51] this man is the same way this near
[1:14:53] Kinsman he could not take Ruth to
[1:14:56] himself because it would have marked his
[1:14:58] inheritance
[1:14:59] it would have marred the devil's
[1:15:01] inheritance to take you unto himself
[1:15:03] because there's no way Satan could
[1:15:07] redeem Humanity without Morgan himself
[1:15:10] but when he but but when when he got
[1:15:14] controlled this Earth when he took
[1:15:17] control that's why we
[1:15:18] were born in sin shaped iniquity common
[1:15:21] World speaking lies when he took control
[1:15:23] over the world he took control of
[1:15:25] everything about the world he took
[1:15:27] control over everything that came from
[1:15:29] the earth us
[1:15:31] our bodies were not redeemed amen they
[1:15:34] could not be because we belong to our
[1:15:37] near Kinsmen right
[1:15:39] right the world and all that is therein
[1:15:41] is still in the possession of that near
[1:15:45] Kinsmen the devil right it still is to
[1:15:49] this day
[1:15:50] and he could not take inheritance to
[1:15:53] redeem that that book of life remember
[1:15:55] now brother Graham said he couldn't take
[1:15:57] it because uh his Filthy Hands couldn't
[1:16:00] take control of her and that is true he
[1:16:03] also could not take it because it was a
[1:16:05] book of redemption and what was in that
[1:16:07] book was scheduled to be redeemed back
[1:16:10] from its Fallen condition he could not
[1:16:13] do that he was following himself right
[1:16:16] amen sin cannot become sin
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] sin cannot become sin because it's
[1:16:24] already sin
[1:16:25] amen this wall can't become blue
[1:16:29] it's already blue
[1:16:32] it can become a different Shadow blue
[1:16:34] but that's just Humanity fleshy
[1:16:36] worldliness but it's already blue
[1:16:40] this this uh Bible stand can't become
[1:16:44] wood
[1:16:46] it's already wood
[1:16:48] amen Satan could not become sin he
[1:16:52] already was sin
[1:16:54] and then you notice my brother random
[1:16:56] talked about a sinner can't sin right
[1:16:58] because he's already sin he is just
[1:17:01] doing what he is
[1:17:02] amen this this Bible stand can't become
[1:17:06] what it's already wood right he could
[1:17:08] not redeem because he was already sin
[1:17:12] and that's what he wanted
[1:17:14] that that was who he was so he lost the
[1:17:17] book but he gained the world
[1:17:20] he gained control over the world in all
[1:17:22] the world systems and everything that
[1:17:24] came from the world again including our
[1:17:25] bodies including us that needed
[1:17:28] Redemption we needed that Redemption we
[1:17:32] needed to have someone that could come
[1:17:34] forth to play that kinsman redeemer part
[1:17:37] to redeem this world back to himself and
[1:17:42] at the same time redeem us yes thus we
[1:17:46] have been redeemed by the love of God we
[1:17:49] have been redeemed by the blood of God
[1:17:52] now that light has come to shine its
[1:17:54] light in our pathway so that we can know
[1:17:57] who he is and what that light does
[1:18:00] foreign to us
[1:18:02] because we are because we have become
[1:18:04] him
[1:18:05] he took our place
[1:18:08] so that we could take his he became us
[1:18:11] so that we could become him that part of
[1:18:14] the near Kinsmen he played so Satan had
[1:18:18] to back away
[1:18:19] Satan had to take his hands off that's
[1:18:22] why you hear Brother banham uh sometimes
[1:18:25] on tape or something when he's standing
[1:18:27] there and he's praying for people or
[1:18:30] he's standing in front of a congregation
[1:18:31] and he says Satan take your hands off of
[1:18:34] God's Property
[1:18:36] how does he have a right to do that
[1:18:39] because of the Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:18:42] is my redeemer came and had the keys of
[1:18:45] death and hell and the keys of of heaven
[1:18:48] and he gave it to the bride
[1:18:52] amen it was of course in the scriptures
[1:18:54] to Peter but that's Peter was just a
[1:18:57] part of us
[1:18:58] the bride could be redeemed and that
[1:19:01] Redemption brought us back into life
[1:19:03] again Jesus had to come in human flesh
[1:19:06] to play the part of that kinsman
[1:19:08] redeemer Satan could not do it amen
[1:19:12] amen God became flesh
[1:19:16] to redeem his inheritance
[1:19:19] what was his inheritance
[1:19:21] we are yes we are the ones whose names
[1:19:25] were in that book of life from before
[1:19:26] the foundation of the world that was his
[1:19:29] possession that was his inheritance
[1:19:31] we're a part of that inheritance God has
[1:19:34] blessed us to know that that inheritance
[1:19:36] belongs to us now we the children of God
[1:19:39] like light more than Darkness
[1:19:42] why because we've been redeemed
[1:19:46] we've been changed Jesus Christ came and
[1:19:49] redeemed us back to him so that we can
[1:19:52] enjoy the light the life of God through
[1:19:55] the revelation of the word to bring us
[1:19:57] into his presence again amen
[1:20:00] amen Satan could not do it
[1:20:03] and Satan tries to redeem us friend
[1:20:06] it would have marked his inheritance and
[1:20:09] what is his Satan's inheritance the
[1:20:11] darkness yes the darkness is his
[1:20:14] inheritance the light is our inheritance
[1:20:16] and God has redeemed us and brought us
[1:20:19] back to himself
[1:20:21] made us like him
[1:20:23] so that we now can stand in that light
[1:20:26] we can stand in the place that God has
[1:20:28] given us by the Redemption of of of the
[1:20:31] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:33] he had to come
[1:20:34] we think about it and sometimes you
[1:20:37] wonder why would God have to have done
[1:20:39] this
[1:20:40] we had to do it because that was by his
[1:20:43] word see God can't do anything outside
[1:20:45] of his word God can't do anything
[1:20:48] separate you think well God just come
[1:20:50] down and snap his finger and the devil
[1:20:52] would despair yeah but that wouldn't be
[1:20:54] according to his word that wouldn't be
[1:20:56] just you think it wouldn't be just for
[1:20:59] God to just snap the devil out of
[1:21:01] existence no no he gives everybody
[1:21:05] amen Angel beings humans every God is a
[1:21:10] just God God is a fair God
[1:21:14] you say well God's a god of judgment yes
[1:21:16] he is but he's a god a fair judgment
[1:21:20] he's a fair God when he judges he
[1:21:22] doesn't judge on emotion
[1:21:25] you know so many times decisions we make
[1:21:27] and snap things that we do it's already
[1:21:29] a lot of it's on emotion right we see
[1:21:32] something or a snap decision or or or or
[1:21:36] knee-jerk reaction as they would call it
[1:21:38] that that's Humanity that's how people
[1:21:40] are God doesn't do that God is a
[1:21:43] righteous God God is a holy God and
[1:21:46] everything he does is righteous and holy
[1:21:48] even his judgments
[1:21:50] so yeah he's a god of judgment but he
[1:21:53] judges righteously and Satan will be
[1:21:56] judged Lucifer the devil the red dragon
[1:22:00] will be judged and he'll be just
[1:22:02] according to his deeds yes by the
[1:22:06] scripture
[1:22:07] amen just like everybody will so no God
[1:22:10] would not be a just God if he just
[1:22:11] snapped his finger in the devil went out
[1:22:13] of existence he would not
[1:22:15] but he has to go through and play his
[1:22:17] part just like everybody does yes amen
[1:22:20] just like that sermon I preached what
[1:22:23] maybe a couple years ago and people keep
[1:22:24] coming up and I still hear people say
[1:22:27] that people who don't know and people
[1:22:28] out in the world say oh that person's in
[1:22:31] hell that's that's how you know that
[1:22:33] well it was just a horrible person was
[1:22:35] that based on your judgment or on God's
[1:22:37] judgment right well they were just a
[1:22:39] horrible person what might what makes
[1:22:41] you such a good person
[1:22:43] well they they were just they were so
[1:22:46] much worse than I am I said what is
[1:22:48] worse
[1:22:49] is it in your eyes that something is
[1:22:51] worse or is it in God's eyes that
[1:22:53] something is worse well I just know that
[1:22:55] person's in Hell well let me tell you
[1:22:57] there's nobody in hell right now right
[1:22:59] right amen God doesn't send us anybody
[1:23:01] to Hell Without first being judged
[1:23:03] because he's a righteous God nobody's in
[1:23:06] hell right now there will be there are
[1:23:08] people in the regions of the Lost amen
[1:23:11] there are people in the regions of the
[1:23:13] blessed and people in regions of the
[1:23:14] lost but I'm not in hell right they will
[1:23:17] be one day uh many will be but they're
[1:23:21] not right now because that would be an
[1:23:23] unjust God
[1:23:24] has to bring them before the Judgment
[1:23:27] seat before they before there is a
[1:23:31] sentence
[1:23:32] it's supposed to be that way today
[1:23:34] amen and and I and the fathers the
[1:23:38] founding fathers that's where they
[1:23:40] brought that from the scripture
[1:23:43] innocent till proven guilty now in a lot
[1:23:46] of cases in the world today it's not
[1:23:48] that way you're guilty as Sin regardless
[1:23:50] but that's a person's opinion that's why
[1:23:53] I'd say it I'd ask somebody uh how do
[1:23:57] you know that person's in the hill is it
[1:23:58] based on your judgment are you the one
[1:24:00] that's in control that's in control of
[1:24:02] Health you open up the carpets of hell
[1:24:04] and you throw somebody in there is that
[1:24:06] your is that your job is that what
[1:24:08] you're supposed to do is that why you're
[1:24:10] in charge of well you know and but uh it
[1:24:15] just gets people to thinking
[1:24:17] to understand because we becomes a
[1:24:20] judgmental we put somebody in hell to
[1:24:22] drop a hat
[1:24:23] you look at it and think well
[1:24:26] I don't I've done worse you know
[1:24:31] um
[1:24:32] something was told to me yesterday that
[1:24:35] uh and I don't want to call him names or
[1:24:38] anything I don't want to embarrass
[1:24:39] anybody but it was uh it was about uh
[1:24:43] one of the children messing up a floor
[1:24:45] and I thought about that I thought wow
[1:24:48] that's man that's just terrible at all
[1:24:50] and I thought you know when I was a kid
[1:24:52] and I'll I can tell you my name and I'll
[1:24:55] be honest with you about me but when I
[1:24:57] was a kid my dad worked for a company
[1:24:59] called eh Jacobs and they gave these
[1:25:01] little Knives Out uh it's just a little
[1:25:04] fold thing and plastic in in it but it
[1:25:06] was a very sharp razor blade there's you
[1:25:08] know that was in the 70s who wouldn't do
[1:25:11] that today uh but uh that just razor
[1:25:15] blades are all over the place and I got
[1:25:17] a hold of one and you know I was
[1:25:20] just having fun with it and I started
[1:25:22] carving into the linoleum in the den of
[1:25:24] our men of our house carving my initials
[1:25:27] and
[1:25:29] so I look at that and think well
[1:25:32] kid may have done something wrong but I
[1:25:34] can't condemn him for it I did the same
[1:25:36] thing
[1:25:36] Bobby maybe even worse so when you look
[1:25:40] at it but you understand my point my
[1:25:42] point is we look and say well that's so
[1:25:44] horrible that person deserves this well
[1:25:46] you
[1:25:49] will it might not include chopping off
[1:25:51] the floor but it's probably something
[1:25:53] else maybe as bad or just or as bad or
[1:25:56] worse if we're just thinking but when we
[1:25:59] but we've got to be careful because the
[1:26:01] Judgment that we're laying on other
[1:26:03] people we got to understand that
[1:26:05] judgment will come right back to us
[1:26:06] again yeah amen if I want to be met on
[1:26:09] that standard then that's the standard
[1:26:10] I'm going to have to be met on that's
[1:26:12] why I like what Jesus said blessed are
[1:26:15] the merciful or they shall obtain mercy
[1:26:18] so if you want Mercy give it yeah if you
[1:26:22] want God to extend his Mercy to you you
[1:26:25] extend Mercy to others that's how you
[1:26:28] get it not judgment not sending them to
[1:26:30] hell not condemning somebody at the drop
[1:26:32] of a hat no but see God doesn't do that
[1:26:35] God is a righteous God he's a just God
[1:26:37] he doesn't do that even to the devil so
[1:26:40] today we know and live and thankful how
[1:26:44] God has given us this uh this ability
[1:26:47] through sending his own son Jesus Christ
[1:26:50] as a human in in flesh body it's way
[1:26:53] more than just presence it's way more
[1:26:55] than a tree and you know how I feel
[1:26:58] about that but there it's way more than
[1:27:00] likes it's way more than parades it's
[1:27:02] way more than uh uh all the Pomp and
[1:27:06] Circumstances surrounds it I'll be
[1:27:09] honest with you uh you know when when
[1:27:11] November hits I become a Happy Fella
[1:27:15] because I enjoyed Thanksgiving very much
[1:27:18] I enjoy the holiday season even
[1:27:21] um
[1:27:22] and a lot of things that go with it
[1:27:24] there's a lot of stuff I don't enjoy
[1:27:26] about it but my wife was telling me
[1:27:27] yesterday I'm so getting tired of
[1:27:29] Christmas music and I said well I
[1:27:30] haven't even heard any
[1:27:32] I when you're on the job in the tunnel
[1:27:34] at the car wash it was there's no
[1:27:36] Christmas music you might go to a
[1:27:39] restaurant for a few minutes and go back
[1:27:41] to your room and door Dash something or
[1:27:43] before you can pass out in bed there's
[1:27:46] not a whole lot of listening to
[1:27:48] Christmas music there is but I enjoy it
[1:27:50] I do honestly I do uh
[1:27:53] stuff about it I wish didn't exist but I
[1:27:56] enjoy the time
[1:27:57] especially in Tucson because the
[1:27:59] temperature drops about 20 degrees 30
[1:28:01] degrees but I enjoy it I do and I enjoy
[1:28:05] the opportunity to be able to celebrate
[1:28:07] and celebrate with you and to celebrate
[1:28:09] with my family and

[1:29:10] remember when John saw it John started
[1:29:13] crying John started weeping because he
[1:29:15] thought all of humanity was lost because
[1:29:16] he looked at that book of redemption
[1:29:18] knowing that his name was in there
[1:29:21] amen a lot of people thought that he was
[1:29:23] crying because he didn't see his name no
[1:29:24] he knew his name was in there he was
[1:29:26] crying because he was afraid that it was
[1:29:28] nobody that was going to be worthy to
[1:29:30] take that book and to redeem all the
[1:29:32] names that were in there and step forth
