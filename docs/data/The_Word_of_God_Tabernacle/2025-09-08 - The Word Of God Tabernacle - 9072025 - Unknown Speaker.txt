So I just pray the Lord touch Art. We also want to continue to remember brother Sister Pat in prayer. Uh, as we read last week, uh, Brother Pat's going to have uh, eye surgery, uh, cataract surgery. Seeing things kind of fuzzy, so please remember him. And also, Sister Pat supposed to have hip replacement um, in about another week. So, I don't have an exact date. Uh, maybe I'm trusting the Lord. Uh, Brother Pat will send me some dates or something to uh, we can be more specific on these prayers, but we definitely want to remember brother Sister Pat in prayer. Uh, these bodies just start to out and uh you know, things just happen and medicine's got to the place that they can rip things out of your eyes and replace stuff in your hips and uh knees and everything else. So, uh keep these old bodies keep on going. Um sometimes I wonder if that's a good thing. Uh but uh but we're very thankful because we want to have brother and sister Patis with us as long as the Lord allows. Amen. Amen. as long as the Lord will have here with us. Amen. Sister Sheiley also had a bad accident this week. Uh she uh hit her head very very uh hard on a tree or tree limb branch, not exactly sure. Uh she picked the one tree that there is in Tucson to hit because we don't have very many of those. But when I was back east, I had hit a lot on a tree, but we got trees back there. But, uh, she hit her head real hard, got a bad concussion. She went to the ER, found out she had a bad concussion. Uh, she's been out of work, uh, dizzy and nauseous. Uh, but just pray the Lord continue to bless her, touch her. She is feeling better. Uh, and she does give thanks and praise to the Lord for, uh, feeling that this week one that she's going through this, uh, the Lord's really touching her. feels like the Lord's blessed her and uh healing is coming AC along very swiftly. So very thankful to the Lord for that. Uh but please continue to remember Sister Sheily in prayer. Uh she does of course want to continues to need that touch from the Lord.

I guess that's Denver. Uh it says deeper. I'm assuming that's Denver since going to I'm guessing that's not a doctor's name. That's uh I guess she has to go to Denver for that. Uh so please she forgot the end. That's my goodness. I'm glad a lot of people my text. I probably do that all the time. Um, but please remember Amanda in prayer for colon special MR on the 25th going to Denver.

Wonderful. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Mine. Wonderful. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's wonderful. Let's all stand to our feet then. Go to the Lord to the scripture. Going to go over to uh back to Romans chapter 8. Those few verses of scripture 14-17 as we start in on uh adoption part 26. Amen. Adoption part 26. Going to speak on our inheritance today. Amen. We kind of delved into it just a smidge maybe last couple services, especially last service, but um I want to speak on our inheritance today that comes to us through this adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:14. Before we read the word though, let's bow our heads for a word of prayer if we could. Lord Jesus, so thankful again, Lord, as your for your word. Thank you for this time, Lord. Thank you for your blessings bringing us through the week, Lord. Yes. Lord, just a couple of the testimonies and so thankful, God, to know that you're ever present with us, Lord. You never leave us or forsake us. And knowing, God, that your hand is upon us, Lord, to lead us and guide us into your truths, into your words, into your pathways, Lord. We're just mere mortals, God. Expecting you, Lord, to continue to strengthen and help us along the way. We don't know the way. We don't know the journey, Lord. We don't know what's ahead of us, God, but we know who holds our hands. We know who has the the journey in hand, Lord, and is leading us and showing us every step at a way, every step at a time, God, along the way. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you, God, for uh for your uh word and for your people, Lord, for all that you've given and done for us. We're just so thankful for health and strength and life. Thankful for our brothers and sisters. Thankful, Lord, for the bride internationally. Lord, wherever they may be, whoever they are, God, we're all a part of the same family. We're all a part of the same body, Lord. And we just pray you'd bless each one, God. Keep us in your protective care. Watch over us. Take complete control now of the remaining part of this service as we commit it to you and minister to us from your word what you'd have us to see and know in that word today, God, knowing it'll not return void, but accomplish that in there, what you had sent it forth for today. Open my mouth to speak that thought liberally to that which you will want to be said, God, and close it to anything that would be your will not to be said, Father. &gt;&gt; We just want to be here to do according to whatever you would have for us to do. Let it be God unto us according to your will. That we ask these blessings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba, father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and children than heirs. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, heirs are the people that get the inheritance, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to be an heir to get an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then heirs. Heirs of God. Joint hes with Christ. So that means that we're a joint with Christ. That what his inheritance is is our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Just gets better and better, doesn't it? If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. on the inheritance. I want to go back and uh speak a little bit more uh back in Joshua and then uh back into Romans where we just read and Ephesians and tie some of that back together again. So, if we could go to Joshua, read from chapter 1. Just going to read a few verses of scripture so we understand and recognize the inheritance that they received. Uh the promise of God. Amen. The promise of God is the inheritance. what God promised us that is our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the promise that God promised them, that he gave them from hundreds of years before, God was going to bring it to pass, recognizing that they had to fight and go through everything that we they went through from Abraham through Moses up to Joshua now and all the fighting and all the everything and the opposition and the battles that were won and the sea was crossed and the river that was crossed and everything that God done to bring them to the point of actually finally receiving their inheritance. Uh a lot of times it seems like that some Christians just want to receive this great inheritance and do nothing for it. Uh but there's a battle to be won. There's a life to be lived. There's an inheritance to inherit. Amen. To be an heir of God. It doesn't just come. Now, I know in normal life, if you're just a son, uh you're just born into the family. Of course, uh, a parent, even if you're a son or a daughter, a parent can write you out of their will. They don't have to leave you anything. &gt;&gt; You don't, even if you are an heir, they don't have to leave you anything as far as our normal uh, nominal human life goes. A parent doesn't have to leave a child anything if he doesn't want to, or just leave him a dollar, a porcelain figurine or something. They can leave them anything. Doesn't matter. They don't have to leave them anything, though. But when God promises something, that promise is our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every promise that God give us. Now, we are fortunately able to be able to obtain some of our inheritance now. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be able to get through this life because without the inheritance that we enjoy now, it would be nearly I I would say impossible for human flesh. That's why Jesus Christ came because human flesh couldn't live the law. &gt;&gt; Right? So there would be no way without having received some of that inheritance now or as we'll read in a minute the earnest of our inheritance which we read last week I believe it was uh the earnest if without receiving some of that inheritance that God give us now how would a human ever make it through even to be a part of the body of Christ it would be impossible without God's help today saints none of us would make it &gt;&gt; there would be no way to make it amen without Jesus Christ coming and dying and shedding his blood and bringing these promises to life for us because he is the mediator. Amen. Without that, then none of us would have any hope. Uh even even back to where Adam and Eve uh when Adam and Eve fell all the way through. The only way they were even able to make it was because Jesus died uh went to hell, empty paradise, and brought him up with him. That's the only way they made it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if they're the only way they make it, then what is How's how are we going to make it in any other way? &gt;&gt; They came from back forward and went up and we're coming here and going up and we all go up together and be uh uh live eternally in the same place. &gt;&gt; But it's that inheritance that God gave us that promise that God gave us. Well, after all the fighting, after all the struggle, after all the battle, after all the fighting and struggling and and and uh all that the they had to go through to get to that place, they finally make that place. Even with God's help, even with God's help, they fought. Every inch of ground that they got, &gt;&gt; they still fought. Even with God's help, they fought through it. And they got to this place. We'll read here and then go back over uh to Romans, Ephesians, uh Joshua 1. We'll just read a couple verses 6-8. Be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an divide for an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God gave them that inheritance. That was their promised land, their inheritance. Thou shalt divide. Now, see, it wasn't Joshua's responsibility to give them the inheritance. God had already done that. &gt;&gt; It was Joshua's responsibility to take that inheritance and divide it out to the people. &gt;&gt; So you, he says, be strong and of good courage. Unto this people, thou shalt divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. So God had already done it. It was just Joshua's job to divide it out to them. Only be thou strong and very courageous. For thou mayest observe uh uh that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest, which also is an inheritance, which which is also a promise. The prospering in God is a part of the promise of God that we are that we receive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fact that we can be overcomers and claim to be overcomers is simply a promise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's nothing we did &gt;&gt; is simply the promise of God. We only overcome. We're only overcomers because of God's promise. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because of some of that now inheritance that we enjoy. Praise the Lord. As overcomers that and prospering whereversoever thou goest, this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night. God help us, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou ha shalt have good success. Praise the Lord. How? Why? We receive, we have good success based on the promise of God. We are able to continue to press forward because of the promise of God. We're only able again, like I said, to overcome because of the promise of God, because of the enjoyment that we have of that inheritance, being heirs of God. Praise the Lord. We enjoy that now because God because of what God has done for us, for what God has given us. Now, let's go over to Ephesians. See if we can't look at this, of course, and uh and bring it through from uh from that point in Romans that we just read. And look at this for again for a little bit on our inheritance. Uh our inheritance is a beautiful thing, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful to God that he gives us this inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Notice not earned, given. It's been given to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Now, Ephesians chapter 1, we'll read verse 10, beginning with verse 10. Ephesians Ephesians 1:10. Amen. That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ. All things. Again, we just talked about that coming from back forward. Everything, all is going to be in Christ. Everything around the world, every every believer around the world is going to be in under one oice. Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I talked about that at Sister Lydia's funeral. I hit on it a little bit last week. Amen. Where God's promise to those that have gone on before and those that are alive and remain, they're all going to be gathered together. And that and this message, this word that the Lord has brought us to. Amen. There can only be that one thing that we're under that we're a part of that we are uh uh gathering under that opus and that's that word that's that revealed word of the hour. It's that that God that promise that God has given us that we are that we are a part of today that we gather together under uh the Lord's even given us special language if you will that we speak that the world doesn't know. You could go to a nominal church and talk about a lot of the things and use some of the vernacular that we use uh in this message and those people probably would have no idea what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't understand that. I remember reading a little article. I I wasn't I was I had a little interest but not very much in all this uh uh uh what do they call it? this uh uh investigation into the bride, into the message, excuse me, into the message and into people that propagate the message or claim to be in the message and uh ministers that have probably not done exactly like maybe they should have or get in trouble with the law or something. Anyway, read an article about that. No calling any names. You probably all know it anyway. Uh but I read a little a little portion of an article that somebody had written about it. The headline was like, you know, uh uh the message and had a picture, I think even of Brother Brandham in it. And uh the the the verbiage started on like and they use verbiage like uh rapture and bride and uh uh seals and I forgot all the words that he used in there, but things that we that that you that become very a normal vernacular we use in the message that you don't hear anywhere else in the world. &gt;&gt; Right. in in Christian anywhere. You don't hear anywhere any denominations, charismatic churches, any Calvaries, you don't hear the verbiage spoke the way that this bride speaks. &gt;&gt; But but it's nothing unusual. &gt;&gt; Uh because I'd sure like to have taken that uh that renegade unbeliever and showed him, well, this is why we say this. It's in the scripture. &gt;&gt; This is why we talk like this because it's Bible. We believe what the word says because the word is Christ. But the problem is people don't know the word. Yes. &gt;&gt; But God's even given us that special vernacular even that we use that a lot of the world just doesn't use. We're gathered together under that one oppos. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The word. Amen. This message, this truth. Amen. That was sent by a prophet in this day that we believe. Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know that God sent. Amen. People can put all kind of false, failures, whatever they want to say, but that word is perfect. Amen. I've never found me myself never found a fault at all. I found plenty of faults in my interpretations of it. Sometimes I found plenty of faults in that. But when it comes down to the revelation of God showing the word the message, I've never found a fault there and it won't be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As a perfect dovetail exactly because this message came from this word and this word is Christ. So God give us something that that that we are together under. No matter what language you speak, no matter what nationality, no matter what color, creed, uh uh uh uh uh continent, nation, all together around the world, the bride, &gt;&gt; that's who she is. All together, come together as one. Amen. We come together as one. &gt;&gt; So, we're at that time. We're at this scriptural time of a dispensation of the fullness of times. A dispensation is just a time period. Well, a time period where you reach a fullness brings an end to something. And we're at that end. Amen. We're not just at the end of an age or end of an era. We are we are at the uh or at end of the age to to go over into another age. Yes, we're at the end of an age, but we're at the end of an age of everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not at the end of the first age, second age, third age. We're at the end of the end of it. This is the this is the finishing. So, the dispensation of the fullness of times of fullness of times, fulfillment of that time period, that he might gather together in one all things in Christ. So all together in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in Christ, even in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In him or excuse me, in whom also we have obained. Now the word doesn't say that we are going to. It doesn't say uh obtaining. Amen. It says obtained, which is past tense, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Which it which means that we have already received. &gt;&gt; If you have obtained something, it's yours. It belongs to you. Amen. You have gotten it. You have obtained it. You're not obtaining. You're not in a process. You're not looking to the future. You have obtained it. right now belongs to you obtained an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't have to worry about a will cuz he already wrote me in his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Obtained. We have obtained in Christ. We have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. Praise the Lord. And I'm glad he does. So, we were predestined to this. God saw this from before the foundation of the world that we were predestined to obtain in Christ the inheritance. Now we have obtained that inheritance that 12th verse we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted we me I you also trusted that after ye after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise. Now what do we talk about the holy spirit we understand is it's an earnest amen which you let's just finish 14 verse which is the earnest it is the earnest or the down payment or the beginning of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. We've received that earnest again. We've received that. We've obtained that it belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we understand now it's just that earnest is just a promise that God has given us that it belongs to us. Understanding and recognizing that there is more to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what we look for. We talk about that going home time is that unto is that part that we're still looking to be fulfilled. But now, now, right now, we have obtained an inheritance, the earnest, the Holy Spirit in us that brings with it all those precious promises of God. Amen. Healing, deliverance, salvation, and guidance and leadership. Amen. And all the blessings, everything that God obtains is a part of him. We have obtained. It belongs to us. It come with the earnest. It's like we said last week, when you put down earnest money, you buy a house, they give you the keys, you can walk into that house. The bank cannot tell you not to go in that room. &gt;&gt; You cannot use the garage. You cannot go into the backyard. No, they can't do that. When they hand you the keys, because of the promise of the inheritance of the earnest down payment, you own every bit of that whole property. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do whatever you want to. It belongs to you. Amen. Now, of course, uh here in the natural, there's things you can't do out because it's outside the law. You can't bury a dead body in your backyard or something like that. you you kind of have to follow along with the laws that we have in the land, but the property belongs to you. &gt;&gt; You can go in every room. You can occupy every part of it. You can change the shingles. You can change the cabinets. You can completely overhaul the bathrooms. You can sew seed in the backyard. You can put a pool in the backyard. You can put up a big fence according to whatever the ordinance of that community is. You can you can do any because it belongs to you. Now, the bank may still hold a note, but that's just more of a promise. It says that there's more yet still to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the good part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every bit of God's that we en every bit of God that we enjoy today is still just the earnest. What that ought to do to us. Am I &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Just to recognize what God has given us, what God's done for us, what belongs to us now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How what a privilege it is and how how overwhelmingly spiritually it is to know that you belong to be a part of that body. If that's what we feel here, what is it going to be on the other side? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Eyes. No wonder Paul said eyes not hear, ears not eyes not seen, ears not hear. Neither even ever even consider in the heart of man what what God's got in store for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's way beyond anything that we would just I was listening to a message when I was uh working Thursday uh just putting up a ladder rack listening to brother Brandham and he was talking about uh the the uh song uh the love of God and how the second verse of that song was written on the wall of an insane asylum drive a man crazy just to try to contemplate it just to try to think of what we've got in store for us friend I can just tell you it's going to be far beyond anything we can imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Far beyond anything we can imagine. You look and say, "Why? Why would anyone want to turn that down? Why would anyone want to pass that up?" I I I read I I read a little snippet thing where where this rock and roll guy um uh one of his band members have had had died and and and he had a dream about him. came to him in his dream and he talked about how wonderful hell was in his dream. And he told him, he said, "Well, make sure and save me a seat." &gt;&gt; I thought, "Boy, you have no clue what you're talking about." &gt;&gt; Reminds you It reminds you of the the uh the rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Reminds you of the rich young ruler had everything. Turned down God and got even more. But when he died, he turned up lifted up his eyes in hell. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he had four brothers that were still left. You imagine what that rich young ruler if he could have just come back for five minutes and told them what he would have told them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was four more that were headed in the same direction. What was going to happen to them? They were going the same way &gt;&gt; down that same hole to that same hell. And I thought to say, save me a seat in hell. Oh, &gt;&gt; a person just knows what I'm talking about. Just blind. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're just blind. &gt;&gt; If the gospel is hid and is hid those that are lost. It's like brother Dennis said in his prayer, they're just blind. They cannot see it. Amen. When you're blind to something and and sometimes so many times we probably uh uh blame somebody for something and say, "How can you blame someone for not seeing? How can you blame uh uh how can you blame a blind man for walking into the wall? &gt;&gt; He can't see it. He's blind. And I thank God have mercy. &gt;&gt; Cuz without the mercy of God, that seat will be filled. And it won't be a seed either. It'll be pure torment for etern for not eternity but forever. &gt;&gt; Pure torment. It's a horrible thing to think, saints. But the bride has received this inher this inheritance. We've received the earnest of our inheritance now that God's given us to be able to live the life that we live. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be able to enjoy the benefits that we enjoy. To be able to have the blessings that we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not have to depending on on medicine or or replacements that God heals. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a healer. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God heals us. &gt;&gt; God delivers us. God strengthens us. &gt;&gt; So many times, friend, we have to draw on that strength because, you know, every single second of every single day, the devil's going to be after you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To try to rip you apart and tear you apart and get your eye going the wrong way, get your attention on the wrong thing, to get your focus on something else other than him, the devil's going to be there to draw you away from him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you got to stay focused. You got to keep on that word. You got to stay in that spirit. You got to let God continue to let let that uh spirit saturate you with that anointing so you can overcome these things of the world. &gt;&gt; Get past the things of the devil to overcome. Praise the Lord. Now, let's continue reading this. Amen. Uh 15th, we're in the 15th chapter uh verse now of Ephesians 1. Still, still Ephesians 1 15. Wherefore, now listen to this and think about this. U let me just go back and read. You don't have to turn with me, but I'm just going to read this again and listen to this as I read this with what we're about to read. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry above. What have you not received, saints? What have you not received? &gt;&gt; A bondage of fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you have not received. There should be no fear in a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; None. God's protecting you. God's taking care of you. The angels got encamped around about those that fear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we have not received a bondage of fear. Praise God. But you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry father. The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are we are the children of God. And if children then hes of God and joint hes with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. Now back to Ephesians 1:15. Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in uh in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of the Lord of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, not bondage, not fear, amen, but of liberty, of wisdom, revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling. Of his calling, not your calling. &gt;&gt; It's not up to us. It's up to him. We belong to him. We give our lives to him. It's his calling to you, not mine. Amen. Not my call. It's his call. Praise the Lord. I just want to obey it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Live in it. Let the Lord show me in that call daily what the Lord wants from me. What he wants me to do that call. It's the hope of that calling. And what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Where are we sitting? &gt;&gt; Heavenly places. Praise. Did we just read that over here? Heavenly places. Amen. That's your position in Christ. Remember we talked about brother Ram said that's your position in Christ. That heavenly place is your position in Christ. When Christ took his position where was he and the in in the power and authority position of God. The power and authority or they the scripture says at his right hand or Bible says at on his right hand. That right hand position of power. What does he do? Just taking that right hand of power in heavenly places. Just taking his place. That's his placement. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think, well, he just got adopted there on Mount Transfiguration. Yeah. But again, as we're adopted into the body, that's just the beginning of our adoption. Then there's work to do. &gt;&gt; There's a life to live. &gt;&gt; There's things to accomplish. There's a spirit to be led by. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, he did. He was led by the spirit. Again, we talked the story about Mary going and trying to find him. They gone a few days and looked around and he was gone. &gt;&gt; And they went and looked for him, looked for him, looked for him, and they finally found him. He says,"Woman, don't you know that I must be about my father's business?" &gt;&gt; Amen. That wasn't building cabinets and chairs and c uh uh woodworking. It was God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Debating the scholars in the temple. I must be about my father's business. &gt;&gt; And he called her woman. Notice the scripture says, "Woman, don't you know?" He didn't say, "Oh, hey, mommy." No. Woman, you must you must know that I have to be about my father's business. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We all have to. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I've had I' I've had to do things in my life I believe and feel by the leading of the Lord that other people didn't understand, &gt;&gt; that didn't make any sense. And if I were to be honest to you and look in the mirror of my life, I didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; But I knew it was God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you know it's God, it doesn't have to make sense. &gt;&gt; Amen. It just has to be according to his word, according to his uh spirit. Amen. To be led of God. See, Christ was just taking that place. A he was just taking his placement, his placement there at the right hand. All power. That's why God said, "This is my beloved son. Hear him." All power, all authority given into his hands. Now, he's just in that position sitting in heavenly places. That's our placement in heavenly places. Far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that world which is to come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And hath put all things under his feet. Well, if we're joint hes with Christ, let's look at this for a sec. If we're joints with Christ and everything that we he is an heir of, we're hes of with him and everything, look at this word says, everything was put under his feet. Where are they to you? &gt;&gt; They're under your feet, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, let's act like it. Help me, Lord, to live like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's under his feet, it's under your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're a joint air with him. That's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer, saints. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are not to be defeated. &gt;&gt; We cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; We are the bride. &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Over his all things under his feet. and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that fillth all in all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me read you this quote. Reach message read from the other day. Breach means church ages. Now when Adam sinned by eating heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word, that's what made Adam sin. Now think think of Adam's position for a moment. He was the spoken word son of God. He was put in a place with no sin. Uh uh everything perfect uh everything righteous, no sickness, uh no death. Uh he was in a perfect place. He was given the inheritance of the world. God gave him all this the world. He had in his his possession the book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had in his possession the was the spoken word son. I if Adam if it had never happened the way it did and thank God it did. But if it had not happened, look what look what would have brought to pass. If if this if the fall had not taken place, there would have been no purpose for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There would have been no reason for him to come and shed his blood and die. And there would have been no reason for all those things to happen if if Adam hadn't fallen. of his humanity had come through from the spoken word and brought onto this earth in in in uh according to God's spoken word and brought to life and occupied this planet that be I don't know a few million people or something maybe I I I would begin to guess how many I don't know uh I would imagine it probably be far less than the seven billion that there are here today or eight whatever it is now but uh they would have all come into fruition. Each one would have come forth in his decreed time and we would have come forth with per perfection and life and amen. But because of the fall because of this inheritance all this that because Adam had control over that he had this inheritance his inheritance he had control over. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He would say, "Why why would brother Brandham say that that Adam could speak and name and say?" And I I'm probably getting ahead of myself in the quote here, but uh why why would all this h because it was in it was his inheritance. This all this was his inheritance. This world was his inheritance. &gt;&gt; He had the book of life. It was his. &gt;&gt; He was to be the quote unquote father of each one that came forth as it was to be spoken into existence. &gt;&gt; Right? That was his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; of course he could speak names say. No wonder he could name the animals. No wonder he could move mountains. No wonder he could move a shade tree over. Do what he wanted to do. It was his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I know your children are fine. Saints, &gt;&gt; your grandchildren are fine. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz they're your inheritance. They belong to you. &gt;&gt; They don't belong to the devil. &gt;&gt; They don't belong to the world. I don't care where they are. Care what they look like, sound like, talk like, act like. I don't care. They belong to you. They're yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam could do whatever he wanted to because they belong to him. &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name and say it. That's it. Is period. Doesn't matter. I don't care what else hell says. I don't care what the devil says. Has nothing to do with me. What the devil says does. Has nothing to do with me. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That doesn't change my promise one bit. That doesn't change my inheritance one bit. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it still belongs to me. It's still mine. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was listening to this song. I I have earbuds and I work to songs and music and uh uh sometimes message and uh I was listening to this song that uh Micah had done had put out. I I took his playlist. So I play it. I listen and this song I believe was in Jimmy Swagger's church if I remember right. Brother's gone on now. But uh I remember them singing it says I'm going to take back from the devil what belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a little repetitive and it's a little worldly like you know with the I'm not necessarily an enjoyer of that but it just it some reason this week it just struck me so strong and say I'm taking back what the devil has stole from me. You know, the devil is only here to kill, to uh to kill and destroy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to help put him on notice. I'm taking back what's mine. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's my inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not his. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That God didn't give me my children for the devil to take them away from me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't give me my grandchildren for the devil to take them away from me. &gt;&gt; They belong to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're my inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever think anything different, saints? &gt;&gt; Because they're ours. &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name. He could say because it was his. You can go and fry an egg in your kitchen because it belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let me finish this quote. His wife reasoned with Satan and then produced the product to Adam. And Adam turned loose to the word and sold out. That's the only way you can is turn loose to the word. You have to turn loose to the word. You have to turn your back on the word before you can go forward in sin. Turn loose to the word and sold out. He lost also what? His inheritance. Oh my. Praise the Lord. Now maybe not his internal his eternal inheritance that he lost his inheritance that God gave him here. He lost his inheritance to the world and the book of life. He lost his inheritance there because he turned loose of the word. Sold out to Satan. Lost his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life. Remember God said the day you eat thereof, that day you die. &gt;&gt; My it's the truth. &gt;&gt; He didn't die physically. He didn't just drop dead with his heart stop beating. No, he lost that inheritance. He lost that fellowship. He lost that connection. He lost that live to ear when God would come down in the cool of the day and fellowship with him. Live to ear. He lost that. He lost his book of life. He had lost the inheritance in the earth. He lost it to the one he lost it to, Satan. Amen. But he lost these things because God said, "The day you eat thereof, that day you will die." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when he lost his life, he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely supreme control of the earth. But he lost control of it. &gt;&gt; He lost his inheritance in it. That's why after that time our bodies started decaying and going back to the dust because of sin. It never was that way to to begin with. Won't be that way on the other side. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But when sin entered in and he lost that inheritance, the body started decaying and going back to the dust. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So thanks Adam. uh appreciate the hip surgery and the knee surgery and the eye surgery and uh the all these things. Uh not a very good steward there if I must say Adam. But that's when everything started going back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because in the because in the earth was was God's create the earth was God's creation, not Satan. Satan can't create. It didn't belong to Satan. belonged to God. David, God gave it in the hands of Adam. Adam lost it to the one he lost it to, Satan. But Satan did not realize that Jesus Christ was going to come one day and shed his blood on this earth. The chemistry of the blood on this earth and buy this earth back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just like he bought us back. &gt;&gt; Just like he bought those that have gone on and in the grave. Just like those have gone on before, they've been purchased. They've been purchased with his blood. Now, the the the life of the blood come back into the believer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the Holy Ghost. The chemistry of the blood went into the earth and redeemed this earth back. So, everyone that had ever fallen and gone gone back into that dust, God will bring back again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those that belong to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There would never have been anybody that didn't belong to him until the fall. &gt;&gt; And when lust came in and sin came in and men and women could just procreate and start making kids all over the place, that's when all these people started showing up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because men and women could just procreate, bring another kid into the world. And anymore it seems like they just bring them into the world and just cut them loose. Don't care. &gt;&gt; They don't care what they do. They don't want to raise them. They don't want the responsibility. They don't want the burden of having to raise that child. Some some parents are so crazy in their thinking that they don't think they should even teach that child. Oh, the child will learn. Whichever way it wants to go. If it wants to be a boy or a girl, it can be whatever it wants. Just let him decide that. Excuse me. I believe God decided that when he gave when he brought that baby forth into this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a boy. You're a girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not an in between. You're a boy, you're a girl. But see, he lost his inheritance. When he lost that inheritance, he lost supreme supreme complete supreme control over this earth. But remember, as we've preached before, God has restored all that back to the inheritance that we now possess. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That now belongs to us. That's when after right immediately after Christ's adoption on Mount Transfiguration, right after that when God said, "Hear ye him." Jesus come forth a few verses later and said, "Now you speak." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say, "Whatever you say to this mountain be removed to yonder place." It has to do it. Why now? help us. That inheritance has been brought back. That inheritance, the earnest of that inheritance has been fully restored back to us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it's you that has that inheritance. It's you that has that authority. You speak, you name, you say. &gt;&gt; All of heaven backs you up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember though, power without character is satanic. Great name. &gt;&gt; You can't just say a Rolls-Royce is going to be sitting in the parking lot for me when we get done with church. I'm going to drive that Rolls-Royce to a $20 million mansion up in the foothills after after we get done eating. Now, see, is that character? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. God's not God's not going to acknowledge that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's just selfish. That's just Amen. That's just greedy. That's not the plan of God. It's like Moses. Moses could have stayed in the hallowed halls of Egypt, but what he did, right? &gt;&gt; He fell to the lowest place and became a a mudber in the mud with them and stomping around in the mud with his with his own people with the inheritance that God had given them. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That inheritance belongs to us, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. sup complete supreme control of the earth. Let me finish this quote. He was a god of the earth. God is the god of the universe everywhere. But his son had this earth under his own control. He could speak. He could name. He could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted to. See, but when he did that, he lost his inheritance. Now Adam could say, "Let this mountain here be moved over there." And it would do it. Adam could say, "Let this tree here be plucked up and planted over here," and it would do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he had complete supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a son of God. Because he was a son of God. Amen. Uh what are we? I consider myself a son of God. &gt;&gt; You consider yourself a son or a daughter of God, &gt;&gt; a child of God. &gt;&gt; Well, if that's been fully restored or at least the earnest, then where where does that place us, &gt;&gt; saints? I'm just afraid that this bride lives so far below her privileges today. &gt;&gt; I I'm afraid that we live so far below our privileges today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. of what belongs to us, what authority we have, the inheritances God has given us. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we're looking forward and we talk all the time and I do and I will keep doing it. Looking forward to what God's got in store for us, friend. But let's not forget what God's got for us here. what God's doing for us. Now, &gt;&gt; this part of that inheritance that God's given us, that we have control over, that God's given us authority over, it's a part of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Belongs to us. Glory to God. He had complete supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a son of God. Now, Brother Brown says, "Now," this is what he said. I'm reading the quote. "Now, couldn't we stop here just a minute and get our real sermon?" &gt;&gt; What do you think he's thinking? He's thinking the same thing I just said. You're a son or daughter of God now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You belong to God now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This inheritance has been fully restored to the bride for this day that brought forth this word and the truth and the power of it. We're at the end of this. It belongs to us right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's mine. It's yours. Now, couldn't we stop here a minute and just get our real sermon? See? Oh, then if the blood has cleansed it back, what about now? See, look what the son of God, the second Adam did, and said, "The works that I do shall you do also." See, Adam lost his inheritance, the earth. Now, it passed from the hands of the one he sold it out to, Satan. He sold his faith to God to Satan's uh faith in God to Satan's reasoning. Therefore, his eternal life, his right to life, the right to the tree of life, earth, earth, he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan, passed it from the hand of Satan. But now now now it has been returned and has been uh to us his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The inheritance the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seed of Adam's great it says amen. That that was destroyed brought back belongs to the bride now belongs to us. That no wonder brother Ram said what you saw temporarily in my ministry temporarily in his ministry will be done in the fullness through the bride in this last day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God help us. It won't be no great big show. It won't be no great big display or anything like that, but it just be a little little something here, little something there or whatever as God does it and you speak it and it comes to pass. You just claim that that belongs to you saints belongs to us. Doesn't belong to the devil. We belong to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our inheritance belongs to us through Jesus Christ. Amen. that great inheritance Adam lost. Let's go um to Hebrews. I'm going to read a couple more scriptures and I'll close here in just a minute. Hebrews 9. Hebrews 9 11 Hebrews 9:11. But Christ being come uh being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building. Neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us. Eternal redemption. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; An eternal redemption means it is finished. It's unto it's done. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh eternal means it well eternal means it didn't begin and it won't end. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Why? Because we were as we just read in Ephesians predestined to this eternal predestined. He obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an hepher, sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit, altered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. purged our conscience from dead works to serve a living God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not a dead God. A living God. &gt;&gt; A living God who proves and works and manifests in our own lives today. Not a history God. Not a God just of the Bible, but a God in your life. A God that lives through you. A God that speaks and acts and works through you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A living God. for this cause. He is the mediator of the New Testament. Praise the Lord. Know what a mediator is? It's a liaison. Person that works in between. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; An an intervention between two parties. Amen. To try to bring back or restore peace or fellowship or communion. &gt;&gt; Right. uh to bring some kind of formal uh pact, amen, between uh uh two groups. And as we especially Gentiles were lost and had no hope and were headed to hell as fast as we could, had no relation with God, humanity and God had come completely apart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus came that mediator and as brother Bradom said, heaven and earth embraced one another. Heaven and earth, human humanity and God. Communion again, fellowship again. Union again, together again, one again. Praise the Lord. That mediator brought that pack together. Amen. To arbitrate between the two of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brought grace. The grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The grace of God been said, it's been spoke. What it means to us saints, the mediator. He is the mediator of the New Testament. That by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament that they which are called might receive those that were are called. There we are with that calling again. Amen. I wonder we started I think the first week calling. Make your calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For that called which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. An eternal inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank God for what we're looking to, what we're going to. But what do we have now? What has God given to us now? What are we looking for? What do we have? What belongs to us right now? the promises that God has shown us. The Easter Seal, he that understandeth, he that knoweth his place in this hour, knoweth his place in this hour. He that heareth my word and believeth on him that has sent me, past tense, hath sent me, everlasting life, shall not come into the judgment, but is already passed from death unto life. Then when this new eternal life dwells in you, it is the potential or the earnestness of you being quickened from from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Holy Spirit earnest the promise. Amen. Remember that's our promised land. Brother Aaron said just like Joshua went and divided out the land to them, their promised land. This the Holy Spirit is our promised land. Amen. that we've received. It's the promise of God that he's given us. Amen. Then then when this eternal life dwells in you is the potential or earnestness of you being quickened but from mortal to immortality in eternal inheritance. Let me say that again. When this spirit has formed you, the individual has come unto upon you. It is the potential of your eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we just got to live up to who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just got to live up to what God has made us. &gt;&gt; We got to live up to Look, if if you were if you were I I don't know. I don't want to call any names today. Used to be all these rich. If if you were the son of an Elon Musk or a a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett or one of these 500 billion dollars they got if you were the son of of someone like that would you legitimately now I may somebody mentally exhausted but and anyway I almost said a word you're probably not politically correct supposed to say today but you're not mentally right. You would go up and and and you would have no qualms of telling somebody that you are a a a son of Elon Musk or a daughter of Bill Gates. You'd have you'd have no problem, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I I I I am the granddaughter of Donald Trump, the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; You would say it proudly. &gt;&gt; You would say it wi with great exuberance and want everybody to hear you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Most people would. Amen. Or or let's just say, okay, if you're on the left, this I I am the granddaughter of Joe Biden, the president, the former president of the United States. I don't care. Democrat, Republican, I don't care. Amen. And and be proud of it. Although there's one granddaughter, they won't even acknowledge it half. But anyway, that's a whole another story. You would say it proudly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You would be happy to let the world know and you wouldn't back down from anything that anybody tried to do or say. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you could write a check for as much money as you wanted basically. I mean a half a billion dollars. A lot of these guys are 400500 billion dollars. You can just write a check for whatever you want. Would you be ashamed of that? I'm I dare to say most people wouldn't. Amen. But how many people are ashamed to call Christ their father &gt;&gt; and and and let the world know that you are a son or daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I have more than 500 billion dollars. &gt;&gt; They come out every year with this statistic that says this is the richest person in the world. And I thought look at that and I say you're a liar. Because that man is not the richest man in the world. &gt;&gt; I am. They just don't know it. But it all belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I share with you though. No, it's ours. It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are the richest in the world. Not that monetary uh value means anything to us, but every bit of it belongs to us. the potential of your eternal inheritance before the foundation of the world. He said that is your potential. Like if you asked me for an oak tree and I gave you an acorn, now the life in the oak tree is in the acorn now, but you have to wait till it grows up. So we did. So uh so do we. When we when you receive the Holy Spirit of God, it's God's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you. Praise the Lord. It's his life in you. that precious inheritance that God's given you. First Peter, I got to read this scripture. 1 Peter 1:3-5. Let me read it real quick. First Peter, I'll close. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible. Now, it's not only just an eternal inheritance, and it's incorruptible inheritance. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. No sickness, no pain, no hospitals, no death. Amen. There's no no little eight and 10 year olds getting shot up because some guy that's crazy in the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People, they Anyway, we'll go on. and an an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. And that's where we are, friend. We are at the last time, the last day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said in blasphemous names we are God has predestined us unto the adoption of sons. Praise the Lord. We that son we have a right as a son. But if but if he was the right son the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally. He became heir. Heir to whatever the father had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Heirs and joint hes with Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Belongs to us. And how could we ever live a a life of be a life of being defeated? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can we ever live a life of defeat &gt;&gt; when our inheritance belongs to us? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's our eternal inheritance. It is our inheritance incorruptible &gt;&gt; with the nature with the character of Jesus Christ. We live that inheritance. Live in that word. Praise the Lord. We claim what is ours. &gt;&gt; Belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand if we could. A lot of people have families, have parents, they have maybe a little something, maybe a car, maybe a house. Amen. Children just can't wait for the parents to die. I want to get a hold of that money. You hear all the You hear sometimes kids kill their own parents just to try to get a hold of that inheritance quicker. They just can't wait, you know, get those millions of dollars or billions of dollars, whatever it is, clamoring for that. They got two or three kids and the kids are fighting and scratching and killing each other to get a little piece of that $200,000 house just just a little just a little bit of that money just because they they they just greedy want to have that money so bad. And Jesus Christ has already died and become the mediator for us. Amen. Because a testament's not in forced until the testator dies. Amen. But the mediator of the New Testament testament Jesus Christ has already died. But not only did he die to bring the testament in forced, he is the one that enforces it. He's the one that come back to bring that enforcement to light for us. And then and then God broke that spirit up and so that every one of us could have a portion. Every one of us could be a part of that body. Amen. Every one of us could have a portion of that inheritance. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I belong to him. I'm so glad that we belong as we're a part of that a part of that inheritance, that word, that spirit that God has put in us. Amen. Let me see if I can find this.
