and done accomplish here now today God the purpose you have this service set aside for and be to your glory and honors we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen 2 Corinthians 10 one now I Paul myself beseech you by the mer uh by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bo that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walk according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen casting down imaginations casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the word amen you could be seated if you'd like amen I felt uh few months ago to start on a little series uh about the Mind amen we're going to do that today Lord willing start on uh series about the mind uh I'm tiing it the Gateway amen the Gateway the mind being the gateway to the soul with mind being the gateway to the spirit being the gateway to the soul because remember the soul is the nature of the spirit the spirit is the life of the body the body is flesh which is mind is flesh is a part of our body which is the Gateway the entrance way the C taste F smell here that we have that are inless to our human body go into the mind everything we feel everything we touch everything we hear everything we see uh all these everything we taste and smell all these things go straight to our minds straight to our brains amen and our minds and uh and that's the Gateway if you will that's the place of of decision that's the place that's the battle amen that's the battle that gets fought so many times in all of our Lives I don't care who you are I don't care how old you are how young you are uh I don't care how long you've been a Christian I don't care uh what faith you have what belief you have if you're a human being you have this battle every one of us do in mind that thing that comes all the time that bombardment of things and things that we probably a lot of times should not have we have good thoughts of course and we have thoughts that come in that we uh that we entertain that we like that are that are pleasurable thoughts that are good thoughts that uh we entertain those there are other thoughts that aren't so much A lot of times we have decisions to make we have things that we have to decide to do which way we're going to go which way we're going to turn some things are very nominal they don't mean much you know if you come to a a fork in the road and you're like well I want to go to this certain place but I'm not sure which Fork to take you got to make a decision you're GNA go to the right or you're gonna go to the left uh well if you go to the right and it's not down there you can always turn around come back and go to the left so some decisions that aren't as catastrophic but there are some decisions that are very important in our life one of the biggest decisions any of us made was to accept the Lord as our savior amen that's the biggest decision anybody could ever make is to receive the Lord as their Savior and and that that is a very important decision amen but always these things that Contin to come in our minds is the Battleground it's the place of the Battleground now remember the first Battleground there ever was the first battle that ever took place according to the scripture was in heaven Revelation 12 first battle that ever took place was in heaven and Satan and his followers were cast out into the Earth and and that battle didn't end when they were cast out on Earth that battle continued it just continued in a different venue and it continues today in each one of us that battle for that Gateway amen the battle for that gateway to come in to the the from the Mind into the heart into the soul of man is continually that same battle that's going on today just because it happened there or took or started there it continues in us today you can see the continuation of it when you get to the Garden of Eden you can see the continu continuation of it through all through through our lives you can see the continuation of it in your life yes amen that battle that Gateway that continues to to press on but the thing I want to get to now is uh I want to read this Adam Covenant confirmed uh 1961 list this now going back in that in that Garden at that time that that introduction on the earth now I didn't I didn't dwell delve into it as much as maybe I proba would like to have today but but this is going to be several parts so uh much of what I probably would say to introduce this subject to you uh is going to be said all throughout uh the time that we that we carry this through so sermon after sermon uh those introductory thoughts will continue to be brought into uh what we speak on today next Sunday so on so forth so but this I want to get to today uh I didn't want to I I don't want to feel rushed I didn't want to feel pushed I left the service at 10:30 knowing it would probably be close but cut the song service a little shorter and uh but I do want to deliver what's on my heart today so am um if he can keep an airplane for brother random he can keep an airplane for me so uh I plan on using wisdom and I plan on being there all time but the Lord willing uh I I want to deliver what's on my heart now look at this says and as I said the other night in the guard of Eden the devil chose his part of a man and God chose His part amen the devil chose his part of the man and God chose His part of the man uh God chose the man's heart the devil chose the man's intellect his mind amen now you you begin to realize or to haven't already realize why that is such a great battle that's the place that the devil chose and God allowed him to take that as his place as his place of battle amen remember he said he's got that punch coming at you and brother Ram said he has a right to that punch yes you know we hear it all the time when people say that punch is coming but you know brother brandom said that he has a right to that punch amen amen he chose the mind so where do you think the punch is going to come to it's not going to come to your heart especially if you're born again it's not going to come to the heart cuz that's the place God chose it's going to come to the mind that's right it's going to come to that Battleground that place where he thinks he can gain some ground on you to try to convince you you're not a child of God to try to convince you you are not who God says that you are to try to convince you you're less or lower to try to convince you oh you'll never be a child of God you'll never make it there's no way you can get there look at how horrible you are look at the things you've done that's a devil that's a that's a battleground of the devil trying to defeat you that's why he chose the mind to try to defeat you out of that to try to get you thinking something thinking something that is not true how many times does the devil put a thought in your mind and we entertain that thought and before long you thinking that that thought was yours it wasn't yours to begin with that's why the Bible says to cast down imagination yes cast down down reasonings and bring captive Captivate every thought every thought now that's that's a strange I the one thing I didn't look up is how many thoughts we have in a minute but it's a lot I know the number's High I don't remember the number but I know the number's High I forgot to look that up but it's a lot a lot of thought but the Bible says to bring every thought into captivity amen I I've used this analogy for years ago I started though when I was preaching the Lord just inspired me brought it it's like a computer when a computer virus comes into there the computer starts acting up and saying wait there's something wrong here something foreign has entered here that's not supposed to be there I didn't do it is what the computer is saying the computer is saying I'm not the one that generated this this came from an outside Source but it's trying to infiltrate my mind which is the hard drive it's trying to infiltrate my intelligence that's what the computer's trying to tell you now what do you want me to do do you want me to take that and bring it and what I and the computer will tell you uh I know I'm being very Elementary about this but it's kind of the bottom line of it the computer asks you then do you want me to take that form material that's come in that doesn't belong here that's trying to make you think that it's a part of this computer when it's really not do you want me to take that material and isolate it and put it into uh trash bin or whatever Captivate it and not let it hurt your computer you got a choice do we say yes or no well you know who's going to say no no I want to I want my computer corrupted with a virus so please send it Forward who's going to do that but yet we do that how many times we do that with our actual thoughts in our mind yes that we do that it's a foreign object a foreign substance that's coming to your mind your computer and it comes in there and and you have the choice a science says science says you have 17 seconds to make a decision are you going to entertain that thought are you going to reject that thought or are you going to replace that thought you have 17 seconds that's what they say Amen if you you can replace that thought then that thing goes away amen so who is going to press no and say Yes I want my mind my body my being corrupted with this thought the devil just put in my mind sure bring it on devil I I don't I don't mind who's going to do that but we do how many times do we do that though yes you wouldn't do that with your computer your computer comes and says do you want this virus or not how he's gonna say yes please bring on the virus I I have an extra $33,000 I need to spend on a new computer so please yeah just tear that one up I mean nobody does that but what you're doing is you're telling your computer to take that for material Captivate it and put it over to the side or get rid of it delete it annihilate it amen that's what you do with your brain bring every thought captive to what The Obedience of Christ who's Christ Christ is the word bring every thought to obedience to the word amen in obedience to the word obedience is better than sacrifice right amen every thought I know it's a lot I know we have a lot of thoughts but that's what the word says every thought to The Obedience captive bring it captive and if it's a form material that's from an outside source that doesn't belong there get rid of it replace it with something something else reject it amen and start I don't know sing A Hymn yeah uh quote uh scripture uh whatever you can do to change that you're in the room with your spouse turn around and say I love you honey that'll change it in heartbeat amen sure it will or your children or grandchildren turn and say I love you give him a hug or thought or something that'll change it just like that whatever it is amen amen the the the idol you ever heard this I'm sure you probably heard the idle mind is the devil's workshop yeah it gives him something that he can work in gives him something he can work on praise the Lord and and and he's entitled to that punch he's entitled to that because that's the part he chose here he chose the mind he chose that Battleground because he knew that that would be the place that he could work on the most to get to you the best knowing is God God's right-and man knowing that at at at some point if you become born again when individuals become born again he has no access to your heart at all anymore anyway Hallelujah why would he if you knew this and knowing this choose your heart when he knew that he would be shut out from that anyway no he chose the Gateway he chose the Battleground gateway to get to your heart amen but thank God it was God who chose the heart amen and God chose a way so that you could seal that devil out so that even when that comes in there it just remains a thought you cast it down amen cast that thought down to The Obedience of Christ the devil chose the intellect now today the church the church nominal Church depends on everything upon their intellect never thinking of the heart and that's the only only thing you can see see he says well a man says well I just can't see it that way brother said well you don't see with your eyes anyway yeah most people think you see with your eyes no you don't see with your eyes look you look with your eyes you look with your eyes but you see with your heart because the heart's the seat of understanding the the heart is the place where it's received acted upon received and and and and brought to life amen that's why the Bible says a man who looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already in his heart right amen where did it start well it start because he looked on he saw and entertained and when he entertained the ACT literally there took place they never touched them but the man that looks on her to lust after her has committed that act in his heart amen and that's where it matters in the heart praise the Lord in the heart is where it matters because that's the place that God chose you look with your eyes you see with your heart it's the place of understanding you look at anything I don't see it you're looking at it but you don't see it means you don't understand it amen to say I don't see it means I don't understand it your understanding comes from your heart now that's where it is now he does doesn't understand it with his mind how is that uh how how is he going to do it his intellects would tell him that's his reasoning but the Bible said we cast down reasonings cast them away from us amen says how are you going to do uh how well are you going to do when the doctor says I've done all that I can do see a point of a point of battleground a point of decision do we believe what the doctor says or do we believe what God's word says amen and I'm not negating doctors you know me better than that I'm not I'm not saying the doctors do a great thing they do a great job in intelligent smart people uh that that are mostly I would say there probably some that aren't so much but mostly good at their jobs I believe most are honest I believe most adhere to the hypocritic oath and uh they're good people and want to just help other people there's some that aren't but uh but but that but God transcends that amen God God goes beyond that he's our great position and if the doctor says that you're dying and there's no hope for you and I've done all I can do what does the word say Amen what does God say that's what we care about that's what means the most amen I could have gone to the doctor said said your knees are all torn apart but God said no just have this boy your grandson come and lay hands on you he did praise the Lord x-ray is negative God's good I mean how how can you compare to that doctor can say one thing but what does God say it's like that story I've told about that uh that girl that that little daughter that was in the hospital dying and doctors come in and nurses come in and the doctor last time he come in he said I've I've done all I can do for your daugh your daughter's on her deathbed and you might as well go in and say your goodbyes the nurse comes in and uh and and they look and they start them plug in equipment say well your daughter's gone there's no hope for her and then someone comes in prophet of God and lays hands on her and prays for her and proclaims her as well which is what the scripture does amen amen the scripture proclaims us well that's right and he proclaims her well and the parents start celebrating and they start worshiping and they start thanking God for the health of their daughter and the nurse comes back in and said what is going on in here what is wrong with you people you act so happy and your daughter's laying on her deathbed said don't you see these instruments I'm about to unplug these instruments are telling us that your daughter's life is failing these instruments are telling us that she's going away that she's about to die but you're rejoicing why are you so happy and the and the dad takes the nurse by the shoulder and says let me tell you something said the doctor come in and said this and this he said but my doctor God says that she's going to be well and we trust and believe that she's going to be well am amen was long after that she come up out of that bed and was well amen what do the doctor say about that that's if he's a good doctor he'll say the same thing we do God is good amen amen God is the Healer used to be doctors would say that amen you could have a broke arm and go to a doctor and uh the doctor would set it but the doctor can't heal it the doctor can set the arm back the way it's supposed to go but there has to be a Healer beyond that doctor the doctor can't heal that my barber is retiring he's quitting basically he was going to retire last year uh but he decided not to and uh and now he's being forced to quit CU three or four years ago had a bad bicycle he's a he's a bike rider he actually rides in the tour to Tucson and uh coming down Mount Lemon uh I forgot what happened anyway he hit a guardrail and flung over the side and uh broke bones and bruised parts of his body broke his humorous right here and they said it they did everything that they were supposed to do and but it just it's pained him ever since and it's and it's getting worse because he does this all day with with cutting hair and this thing it just so he went back to the doctor and the doctor said well your Bone's not growing back together you know grown bone is supposed to grow and grow back and join back together and and and be one again and the doctor said it's not growing back together you still just got two piece of Bones sitting next to each other with a plate or something on it whatever it is it's not growing back together see but the doctor did all he could do right all the doctor could do was was was uh put it together and put plates on it or something and and and and sew it up and wait for it to get healed but it took it takes God to heal it that's right amen I gave him the testimony about my knees while we were sitting there brother John yor gave him the testimony about his shoulder he his shoulder was hurting real bad he went to a prayer line and and he come out of the prayer line didn't think anything about it but he went and sat down and he felt the same thing which is which was just out just made me so happy which was exact EXA same thing I felt and I told every one of you sitting here what I felt after I got prayed for amen that my knees that was like heating blankets around my knees he had the exact same thing happen and he said it before I did he said when I sat down it was like a warmth came over my shoulder he said it was just like hot and I could move it and there was no more pain amen praise the lord it's the same thing it's the same God he's the same healer doctors can do what they can do and thank God for them but it takes God to bring the healing that's right so who we going to believe who are we going to trust it takes God we have to bring now every thought in the Captivity to The Obedience of Jesus Christ amen the acceptance or rejecting belongs in our minds the Battleground the Gateway belongs in our minds are we going to accept it are we going to rejected how many times have you heard the phrase how many times have you said the phrase I've made up my mind or tell somebody make up your mind right amen what are they they're in a place of contention they're in a Battle Ground they're in a place of of acceptance or rejecting what are they going to believe what are they going to accept which way are they going to go what are they going to do amen and there's so many different outside influences that would uh that would cause the decision to be one way or the other amen how many things happen to decide well if I if I do this or if I do it this way this is going to happen uh I I know I have that on my job a lot I know probably brother Pat maybe some of you others do uh in putting his car together uh if I do this this is going to happen if I don't do this this is going to happen or this won't happen or decisions this is going to make and how many times you heard his testimony how many times you heard my testimony how many testimonies have you had personally where you said that God came on the scene and said well this is the way you do this this how you do that and this is how amen reminds me uh too of what brother Pat gave his testimony about when he was working on his job and uh fixing Machinery I think at Hughes and uh something would break down on the machine he go up to the machine I have a clue I I know the machine but I don't know what's wrong with it I don't know how to fix it I don't know what to do about it but then God comes on and he says do this and this and whatever have it work to him and and he goes does what the Lord puts on his mind on his heart he does it machine fixed praise the Lord amen I I I've done that before and just pray over it and and it just start working that's right not not a machine or you know uh whatever the circumstance was and it just happened am and well it just happened so praise the Lord I don't know what I did but it works amen well see a lot of people put that off I don't put things like that off see I serve a living God I serve a real God I serve a God that's alive I serve a God who who uh wants to do for me most times more than I want him to do right and he's sitting there just waiting just ask amen just ask just come before me just talk to me amen that's all he's looking for we though bring every thought into captivity amen we can't be allow those things to continue to pulsate in us before we recognize now let's go over to First Peter amen first Peter I I I will tell you I plan on delivering all is on my heart today uh the main point I wanted to make to us today was the understanding that uh that that brother Rand made that Satan chose the intellects amen God chose the heart Satan chose the intellect and the intellect is that Gateway the intellect is that Battleground the intellect is that place that we fight all the time amen all the time that's where Satan comes to you that's where Satan tries to deceive you that's where Satan tries to talk to you and make you think that you're something that you're not or or vice versa or uh put things in your mind and thoughts he'll have you Satan will have you apologizing repenting for thoughts he put there that weren't even your thoughts to begin with they were his that's right and he saying I'm sorry Lord sorry for what it's his thought not yours yes that's right but we have the responsibility to cast that thought down we have the responsibility to bring that thought captive Amen to The Obedience of Christ the word not act upon it but bring it captive praise the Lord first Peter now chapter uh chapter 1 verse 13 but as I said I was going to I wanted to deliver what was on my heart today I I did more or less cut out a song in the song service and uh maybe shorten this a little bit and it was a little easier because uh we'll pick up next week where we left off today if there is a next week so First Peter chapter 1 Let's uh let's begin with verse 13 uh 1 Peter 13 wherefore now listen to this wherefore gir up your loin G up the loins of your mind G up the loins and now we don't talk like that today right that's not the kind of bacular we use normally in our everyday conversation so what is he talking about let's let's move on or continue to read we'll come back wherefore gir up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which has called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation how do we do that by bringing every thought captive right amen bringing every thought captive it's easy too especially if you're out in the world or have a secular job like I do that the thoughts will come you you work I I work with with for lack of better phraseology sinners I I I I work with guys that don't know what we know aren't aren't born again um that say things and do things and and and the devil always especially bring back from maybe your old life and something is said you got to bring that thing captive amen because our manner of life is a holy life our manner of conversation is a holy conversation hallelujah amen because it is written be holy for I am Holy what is that now bring every thought captive look at this let's go back to the 13th verse wherefore gird up that is the Cinch that is like a belt uh to keep my pants from falling down I gird them up with my belt amen it's also good for a microphone holder but I GD them up amen and it says G up CCH up uh that means M maintain control control over uh keep in uh in contact together uh don't lose control over which I would lose control of my pants if my belt was on don't lose control over gir up amen wherefore gird up the loins the loins is the place of reproduction amen your loin area is the place of reproduction the Bible speaks of it many times about the protection you go back to Ephesians 6 talks about the protection of the loins there's a reason for that it's the reproductive part naturally the reproductive part of a physical being is in the loin area amen the loin area of your mind is the reproductive area so we are to gir up or cinch or control keep control over gir up the loins of your mind the reproductive part of your mind what does that do that that helps us be able to control what we do yes and how we act and how we speak and what we look at amen all the things the sea taste feel smell here even amen um one of the guys last week they we were uh at a restaurant eating and the rest it was a very good food and I had a root beer and of course they drink but uh they had uh they had uh shots of tequila I think after anyway and and the one guy kept picking on me here you know I I it'd be something to see him I said well um it'd be something to see a pig fly over this restaurant too but that's not going to happen either so you you can think or wish or whatever all you want but it's not going to happen and it does see the tastes even part of it see uh so many those things those endless come into play that's why the Bible says to grow but where does it start starts in the mind doesn't start with your nose I mean that's where it comes in or with your eyes that's that's an inlet that's how we look but but it starts with your mind the battle doesn't start with your eyes it starts with your mind because the mind is processing what it's seeing and if it's seeing something that's to the lust of the flesh it becomes a desirable thing to the mind but then with the heart but when your heart takes over and and you as a as a as a Christian you as a as a Godly person decide that is not what you want to entertain uh or to become a part of your your your intellect you're a part of your being you reject that now it's easy sometimes maybe if you're looking at something all you got to do is close your eyes and turn away that's why brother Brandon put a cross in his car Amen brother green talked about that lady just stared at it going across the street said now see that's what we have to we have to be careful of Amen put a cross in his car so when something like that happens he looks to the Cross amen simple seems like all those things those are those that that is a process of girting up your loin the reaper so when it hits the mind it doesn't replicate itself Hallelujah because see that's what a virus on a computer will do uh it'll put a virus in there and it'll start replicating itself and as it does that it starts eating away at the good stuff in your computer right amen and replicating and replicating uh that's the thing we want to avoid it to be replicated that's why it says G up the reproductive take control over the reproductive part of your mind so it doesn't come out as an act in your flesh or so it doesn't come out as a word in your through your mouth or or something that you entertain you get rid of it you control it you take uh uh you take control over it so it doesn't become a part of what you do or what you say or how you act that's why we control it that's why the the spirit of God is in us to keep control over that but see that is our responsibility too because we are free moral agents we are free moral agents to the point of acceptance or rejecting we can do it if we want to if you want to accept it you can accept it right if you want to reject it you can reject it amen and that many times that boils down to how much Victory you got in life right how close you living to the Lord yes amen that boils down to am am I in the position am I in that place that I receive that or do I reject that because we all have the decision to make if we're going to or not amen amen if we're going to if we're going to receive it then it's something that becomes a part of us amen obviously something you can repent for but we don't even want to entertain it we don't even want that to be a part of us amen we want to reject that and get rid of that not let that be a part of our Lives that's why it says G up I know it's not language we used today but G up that reproductive part of your mind amen that that reproductive part of your mind so that it does not reproduce something that's ungodly amen we want our lives to be lived as holy that's why it goes on to talk about controlling our conversation letting our conversation be holy letting Our Lives be holy be ye therefore holy as he is Holy amen amen everything about it being according to Christ and the word yes now I want to go over uh to Proverbs I want to finish here read just read one verse of scripture one verse of scripture amen Proverbs chapter 3 we'll read one verse of scripture and then we'll close Proverbs 3:5 they must have hit something up there they had that fixed Proverbs 3:5 trust in the Lord with all thine heart amen a mind heart trust in the Lord with all thine heart the place God chose the man's heart trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding we don't lean on our own understanding we lean on his amen we don't lean on our own words we lean on his we don't lean on our own ways we lean on his amen everything about it is Godly everything about our lives is Godly but when the devil if I leave you with this today the Devil comes to try to bring that thought something you know it's a foreign matter doesn't belong there it's not your thought amen cast it down that's right something comes Temptation see or smell cast it down don't have anything to do with it bring it captive to The Obedience of Christ the word and when it's in obedience to Christ the word it will be holy because he is Holy it will be righteous because he is righteous the conversation will be according to the word not according to your flesh right not according to something that's uh uh uh uh that's deplorable it's something that's righteous something that's holy we maintain ourselves and that's not that's not self-help Saints that's just us understanding the point that we are free moral agents to decide and make decisions and that is our choice to make to to uh to decide what is our what is my choice going to be starts in the mind the Battleground and that's where the devil's going to continue to battle you with yes amen it affects not only your SE taste SP smell here but it also affects the inlet to the spirit the imagination conscience affection reason memory affects those five inlets to your spirit too because those things will bring about things of your memory or things of the spirit em motion a lust or something of that matter amen it'll it'll bring those things into light to the humanity of your of your physical being amen but this physical being is to be cast down we don't live by this physical being we live by the spirit remember we read we don't walk by the flesh our Warfare is not of the flesh the things that we have that we fight the battles are not a Warfare of the flesh they're a Warfare of the spirit amen and that's the thing that comes there remember the mind is flesh it can corrupt that's why we are to make sure we maintain control GTH them up maintain control over the thoughts of your mind over the the things that the foreign matter that would try to come in the things that Satan would try to bring against you amen keep control of those cast down those imaginations amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could that's just the introductory I wanted to make to this subject and Lord willing try to delve into it much deeper next week amen bring some more script scripture references and see how the Lord will take it from there amen so praise the Lord let's go back to this this song and sing This Little Chorus again quick amen lean not into th own understanding learning to lean on Jesus we're Learning to

how much she Lov God and you know and why everybody doesn't love God so well God doesn't make people love him God wants us to love him because we want to yes amen I mean what kind of a marriage it would have been with my wife if I had forced her at 16 years old to love me you're going to love me woman and you're going to say I do I mean what kind of a marriage what kind of a life would that what kind of a relationship is that amen amen I want her to love me because she loves me as I do her God wants us to love him he wants us to choose to love him amen be our choice not out of force
