[37:00] i want to greet you all in the name of
[37:01] the lord jesus christ
[37:03] my privilege to be amongst you this
[37:05] morning amen um while you're standing if
[37:08] you open your bibles to romans the fifth
[37:10] chapter read verses one and two
[37:14] and i'd like to com the topic is faith
[37:17] comes as a result of trust
[37:19] amen and that'll make some sense i think
[37:21] as we get we get into the service
[37:24] the romans the fifth chapter will read
[37:26] verses one and two amen
[37:31] so therefore being justified by faith we
[37:33] have peace with god so our lord jesus
[37:35] christ
[37:36] by whom we have also access by faith
[37:39] unto this grace wherein we stand
[37:41] and rejoice in the hope of the glory of
[37:43] god amen let's just pray
[37:47] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[37:49] father it is always our privilege
[37:51] to gather ourselves together around your
[37:53] word and then lord to sit at your feet
[37:56] and receive what you have for us amen
[37:58] follow my law lord to stand before the
[38:00] purpose of your blood lord i realize the
[38:03] responsibility
[38:05] but lord they haven't come to hear me
[38:06] lord but they've come to hear from you
[38:08] yes yes lord take me as your servant
[38:10] this morning move me aside
[38:13] guide my thoughts lord in the words
[38:14] which are spoken yes the lord the people
[38:16] might be blessed through your word
[38:18] i ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[38:21] amen amen you can be seated
[38:26] the bath have prefaced a little bit of
[38:28] this
[38:30] a couple of years ago i did a study in
[38:32] habakkuk africa it's only three chapters
[38:34] in length
[38:35] but havoc changed my whole concept of
[38:38] faith
[38:39] what is faith how does it operate
[38:41] and and then just just the workings
[38:43] within our lives
[38:45] we read here in romans it talks about
[38:47] being justified by faith
[38:49] and the reference here when you in my
[38:52] bible anyway it references back into
[38:53] havoc and so it took in this and began
[38:56] to study habakkuk but it we have we have
[38:58] to begin to understand faith is not
[39:00] believing in
[39:02] believing for something
[39:04] but it's being able to believe in
[39:06] someone amen because we have the faith
[39:08] to believe in god
[39:10] i mean really truly believe in him and
[39:12] who he is and what he is yes then that
[39:15] changes our whole concept because if you
[39:17] actually believe him and you believe his
[39:19] words
[39:20] then whatever you request from him
[39:23] because of your faith in him you expect
[39:25] him to fulfill his word amen so it says
[39:27] being justified by faith brother branham
[39:29] says justified is as if you never sinned
[39:32] right
[39:32] right and most of the the christians
[39:35] that i talk with there's a struggle that
[39:37] we have because we're still living in
[39:38] temples of clay
[39:40] and we always make mistakes we have we
[39:42] struggled i mean that that's
[39:44] maybe you don't but i do yeah but we've
[39:47] been good we have to come to the concert
[39:50] we have to come to the understanding of
[39:52] how god views us right because if we can
[39:54] understand that god views us as if we
[39:56] had never sinned
[39:58] we are as righteous as god himself is
[40:00] righteous we are as pure and holy as god
[40:02] himself as holy because that's how god
[40:04] views us
[40:06] it doesn't matter what you think about
[40:07] yourself it doesn't matter how you view
[40:09] yourself amen it matters how god views
[40:11] you right because if god views you as
[40:13] righteous if god views you as totally
[40:15] justified if god views you as as pure as
[40:18] he is pure he said then the stroke then
[40:20] then the struggle with for believing in
[40:23] god
[40:24] becomes less
[40:26] yes amen amen um
[40:29] it talks about you therefore being
[40:31] justified by faith that says we have
[40:33] peace
[40:34] it talks about arrest
[40:36] it talks about being able to enter into
[40:38] a relationship with god
[40:40] where we rest in him amen where we no
[40:43] longer struggle within ourselves and yet
[40:45] we all make mistakes you're getting one
[40:47] guy he was praying in the morning he
[40:49] said lord he says i haven't said a bad
[40:50] word i haven't had a bad thought he says
[40:52] i haven't i haven't done anything to any
[40:55] evil to anybody else but i'm going to
[40:56] get out of bed in a couple of minutes i
[40:58] need all the help i can get yes
[41:00] because this is our struggle
[41:02] as long as we live in temples of clay
[41:04] but there should be a
[41:06] we should become
[41:07] we should come to a relationship with
[41:10] god
[41:10] where we rest in him amen well we rest
[41:14] in how he views us he views us as
[41:16] sinless because what does he do he's
[41:18] looking at the sacrifice what did god do
[41:20] in the garden of eden he took adam and
[41:21] eve they had sinned
[41:23] and he said the day you eat thereof the
[41:24] day you died amen okay and so that's
[41:26] what they were expecting all of a sudden
[41:28] they would be spoken out of existence or
[41:30] whatever the thing was so what did god
[41:32] do he went and he performed the
[41:33] sacrifice he took an animal he killed
[41:35] the animals he took the skins and he
[41:36] gave it to adam and eve whenever god
[41:39] looked at adam and eve what did he do he
[41:41] looked at the sacrifice amen whenever
[41:43] god looks at us he looks at the
[41:44] sacrifice right it's the sacrifices
[41:47] because of what god did for us at
[41:48] calvary that is what makes us pure in
[41:51] his sight amen because brother madam
[41:52] says he hears our voice speaking through
[41:54] the blood amen he doesn't view you he
[41:57] views himself amen amen
[42:00] so if we can come to this understanding
[42:02] it it
[42:04] i know for myself all of a sudden it
[42:06] makes it so i i do not struggle in my
[42:08] relationship with god i struggle with
[42:10] myself i struggle with my flesh i
[42:12] struggle with my shortcomings sure but
[42:14] when i go to before god i know how he
[42:16] views me amen and therefore i know i
[42:19] have an audience with him whenever i
[42:20] whenever i bow my head
[42:22] talk to him yes yes praise the lord but
[42:25] in havoc of two and four it talks about
[42:28] that which where this reference comes
[42:30] back to he says behold the soul which is
[42:32] lifted up is not upright in him but the
[42:34] just
[42:35] shall live by his faith
[42:37] and so i studied that because i was
[42:39] curious with how you know the wording
[42:42] in some ways it didn't make a whole lot
[42:43] of sense but it talks about in the first
[42:45] part of me says he's he says the soul
[42:47] who's lifted up
[42:49] behold his soul which is lifted up is
[42:50] not upright
[42:52] in other words the way that it talks
[42:53] about there the man who relies upon
[42:55] himself right he says god will not even
[42:58] view him
[42:59] in fact it talks about that he said
[43:03] in referencing and the studies that i've
[43:04] done he says the man who relies totally
[43:06] upon themselves is god i don't need your
[43:08] help
[43:09] god i don't i don't need to take care of
[43:11] me i don't need to watch over elf for me
[43:13] i don't need i don't need your
[43:14] assistance at all amen i can handle this
[43:16] by myself yeah
[43:17] well god says you think you can
[43:20] go for it i'll leave you alone
[43:23] and too many people
[43:24] too often that's how we approach things
[43:26] right yes true it really is we're living
[43:28] in a time now where judgments is
[43:30] striking this world yes yes our nation
[43:33] is under judgment i mean if you don't
[43:35] believe it look at the east coast look
[43:36] at the west coast look at the hurricanes
[43:37] look at the tornado look at our
[43:39] government right yeah that should do it
[43:41] yeah but i mean
[43:43] we have to come to the realization
[43:45] the judgment has started yes
[43:48] we will not be in we will not go through
[43:50] the tribulation period brother ramsey
[43:52] the bride will get out of here amen but
[43:53] we are seeing all the preliminary steps
[43:55] to this we are saying to god's judgment
[43:57] upon this nation
[43:59] why do we have the the government do we
[44:01] have
[44:02] god allowed it sure right god puts in
[44:05] who he wants god takes out who he
[44:07] doesn't want and so he has placed our
[44:09] government to have and they have
[44:11] something to fulfill brother brown says
[44:12] this nation must fall right they're
[44:14] doing an excellent job at accomplishing
[44:16] what god has has has said
[44:20] but it comes to the it's something let's
[44:21] see often when it talks about the person
[44:24] who relies upon himself too often we
[44:26] apply this to our relationship with god
[44:30] well lord you know i make mistakes
[44:32] and we look at our mistakes we look at
[44:34] our shortcomings and that hinders our
[44:36] faith into to believe god for the thing
[44:38] brother branham says if you go to god in
[44:40] prayer and you have doubt in your heart
[44:42] he says he says that hinders your your
[44:45] prayers your prayers approaching god yes
[44:47] right and but often we look at ourselves
[44:49] and we try to well i have to do this i
[44:52] remember my mother uh many many years
[44:54] ago obviously
[44:56] and she said oh yeah she did something
[44:57] wrong she didn't tell me what it was
[44:59] so after one week of just being
[45:01] miserable she said well now i basically
[45:03] i've done my penance and so now i can go
[45:05] back to god
[45:07] well you don't earn it right
[45:10] you do not earn a relationship with god
[45:12] if you don't earn salvation you there in
[45:14] fact there's nothing that you can do to
[45:16] ever earn anything from god amen amen
[45:18] amen
[45:21] um jesus christ in a parable in luke
[45:25] he says about two people went into the
[45:26] temple to pray he said one was
[45:28] republican one was a pharisee
[45:30] pharisee pharisees were the righteous of
[45:32] the righteous they they lived the law so
[45:34] to speak
[45:35] and and the republican on the other hand
[45:37] he was the tax collector
[45:39] he was a man who had sold himself to the
[45:41] roman government he collected tax money
[45:43] from his own people lived off of the
[45:45] excess that he accumulated and basically
[45:48] he was a traitor to his own nation
[45:50] and so the jewish people had no respect
[45:52] for them for the public simply because
[45:55] they viewed him as a traitor
[45:57] but in the parable that jesus christ
[45:59] goes on there he says the pharisee uh
[46:01] the pharisees stood up and prayed within
[46:03] himself oh i thank you that i'm not as
[46:05] other people extortioners unjust
[46:06] adulterers and even as this republican
[46:08] over here
[46:09] i fast twice in a week you're tired of
[46:10] all that i possess that i imagine the
[46:13] list kept going on and on and on and on
[46:15] and on
[46:16] because see in the jewish religion
[46:18] justification came by keeping law yeah
[46:21] that's right that is how they viewed it
[46:24] but the public and he going to go in
[46:25] there and he and the public and standing
[46:28] a far off would not lift up so much as
[46:29] his eyes to heaven but smote upon his
[46:32] breath saying god be merciful to me a
[46:34] sinner
[46:35] remember jesus said i tell you
[46:37] i tell you this man went down to his
[46:38] justified
[46:40] rather than the other for everyone that
[46:41] exalts themselves should be a bit in in
[46:43] the schofield bible it has a footnote
[46:46] down there
[46:47] and the publicans prayer could be the
[46:48] lord be toward me as that as
[46:51] when you look us upon the atoning blood
[46:54] don't look on me because i have nothing
[46:56] to offer you amen don't look upon me
[46:58] because i i be because i i'm a sinner
[47:01] amen but he says look at me as you look
[47:03] upon the blood that's sitting on the
[47:04] mercy seat amen because that's the only
[47:07] hope that he had amen but see in reality
[47:10] that's the only hope we have sure
[47:12] i cannot rely upon myself yeah we've
[47:14] gone to india for last 15 years with
[47:17] missionaries we've done things you know
[47:19] to help build the kingdom of god and
[47:20] stuff
[47:22] but that doesn't mean anything
[47:24] i did
[47:25] you people that work um what do you do
[47:28] you go to work because you perform so
[47:30] many hours of labor or something like
[47:32] that then okay you're expecting be paid
[47:35] well i go to
[47:37] my going to india was god's calling
[47:40] so that's my obligation that's my quote
[47:43] unquote that was my job right so that
[47:45] doesn't earn me any brownie points i was
[47:47] just doing what i was obligated felt
[47:49] obligated to do right and so whenever i
[47:52] whenever i approach god i always go
[47:54] through the blood amen i always head for
[47:56] the cross yes i said lord is because of
[47:59] what you have done there at the cross
[48:00] you have made you have justified me
[48:02] because of what you had did at the cross
[48:04] now you have covered my sins amen forced
[48:07] them all away and it's in that that i
[48:09] rest praise the lord it's in that and
[48:11] i've come to the place where it says
[48:12] lord i have nothing to offer you brother
[48:15] branham even himself when you listen to
[48:17] his prayer third he said i'm you know
[48:18] i'm just i'm just a miserable sinner and
[48:20] stuff like that and i'm just standing
[48:21] here in need of you and yes it's just i
[48:23] don't approach you on my own merits i
[48:25] don't approach you because i'm a prophet
[48:27] no i approach you because of the shed
[48:29] blood i approach it to you because of
[48:30] what you have done for me at calgary yes
[48:34] and we can rest in calvary
[48:37] if we can learn to come to the
[48:38] realization that it's in christ in
[48:40] christ alone yes that's all of our
[48:43] salvation amen if you have need of
[48:45] healing he already paid for it at the
[48:46] cross if you can believe it
[48:49] the stripes on his back have already
[48:51] healed you amen but you have to believe
[48:53] that praise the lord if you have need of
[48:55] peace he already paid for our peace you
[48:58] know if you need salvation he's already
[48:59] paid for your salvation but it all goes
[49:01] back to the cross and all goes back to
[49:03] what god did for us at calvary man
[49:06] but we have to learn to rest in that yes
[49:08] amen faith is not believing an
[49:10] intellectual thing faith is not all of
[49:12] us said oh yeah you know i got this
[49:14] marvelous revelation or this
[49:16] intellectual knowledge about faith no
[49:18] faith is a relationship right
[49:21] like i said i studied in havoc
[49:24] faith is a relationship between between
[49:26] the creature and the creator yes where
[49:28] the creature has total reliance upon god
[49:31] literally for everything amen amen how
[49:34] many got up this morning amen amen i was
[49:36] a few minutes okay that's good yeah
[49:39] why did you get up
[49:41] because god woke you
[49:42] up he didn't have to wake you up right
[49:45] there's a lot of people today didn't
[49:47] wake up
[49:48] a lot of people would go with this
[49:50] pandemic and all this stuff yeah they
[49:52] went to bed last night figuring they'd
[49:53] be they would wake up and in the morning
[49:55] all they never did right a lot of people
[49:59] i mean i i minister to andy and i keep
[50:01] track of what's going on there
[50:03] there are days they don't have any food
[50:06] but god provided you food yes you've all
[50:09] eaten amen you all have houses to live
[50:11] in you all you're you know are taken
[50:13] care of in that regard but then who
[50:15] provided it right you say well i got i
[50:17] have a job i i work for a living i make
[50:20] money
[50:21] fine who gave you the job
[50:24] who gave you the job amen who gave you
[50:26] the job that you presently have if you
[50:29] if you uh if you think you did it on
[50:30] your own merits no you didn't
[50:33] it's god who did that amen amen it's god
[50:35] who blessed you with the dog it's god
[50:37] who blessed you with your home it's god
[50:38] who blessed you with the cards you drive
[50:40] and it all comes from god god is the
[50:42] source
[50:42] yes i mean i can live back in my life
[50:45] and yeah well there were times that my
[50:46] wife and i yeah we struggled right we
[50:48] had time to there wasn't any i didn't
[50:51] have a job there was times when we were
[50:53] short on cash
[50:55] one incident came to mind we we lived in
[50:57] switzerland for a year
[50:59] i i was working for the university of
[51:01] lausanne doing microbiology
[51:03] they pay you in the middle of the month
[51:05] assuming you're going to finish the
[51:06] whole month that's that's how they do it
[51:09] well shirley and i when we landed in
[51:11] switzerland didn't come with a whole lot
[51:13] of cash
[51:14] and all we were down to
[51:16] not enough to buy anything really
[51:19] and so and i didn't tell francois i
[51:21] didn't bother i didn't want to burden
[51:23] him with you know if you're well lord
[51:24] you'll provide somehow right and during
[51:26] after service a couple of brothers came
[51:28] up and here god bled this upon my heart
[51:30] to give you this amen amen another
[51:32] brother came by here god laid up my
[51:33] heart to give you this right they
[51:35] provide just enough money to get us to
[51:37] why got paid
[51:38] amen right wasn't that excess but it was
[51:41] just enough
[51:42] god god directed us god led us and god
[51:45] supplied it amen it wasn't me going to
[51:47] the pastor and demanding him i got a
[51:49] prayer request i'm broke i need some
[51:51] cash no no but see god himself came and
[51:55] laid it on other people's hearts to go
[51:57] and to give me what we had made up
[51:59] because we felt we were in his will
[52:01] doing what we were doing amen and here
[52:03] again it comes to the place do you rely
[52:05] upon god
[52:06] if it's like there's a book that um
[52:09] reads how the intercessor
[52:12] um god says i want you to go to a
[52:13] certain city he said well i don't have
[52:15] any money well if you had money what
[52:17] would you do well i'd get in line to go
[52:19] buy my ticket he said well
[52:21] okay so he gets in line and he still
[52:23] didn't have any money finally as he
[52:25] steps up to the window to go ahead and
[52:27] buy the ticket
[52:28] um he says i need a ticket to go here
[52:30] you know and all of a sudden somebody go
[52:32] here oh i'm sorry i'm a little late here
[52:33] god told me to give you this amen
[52:36] it was just enough for him to pay for
[52:37] this ticket to go where god was
[52:39] directing him to go amen so you have to
[52:41] begin to understand it's all god's doing
[52:43] amen
[52:44] it's all god's leading but so you have
[52:46] to have the faith to believe that what
[52:48] god has said god would perform yes
[52:50] absolutely amen brother
[52:56] and ministry explained brother ramsey
[52:58] seven says said how did divine healing
[53:00] is
[53:01] does it last all the time he says it
[53:03] lasts just as long as faith laughs
[53:06] and salvation lasts the same way just as
[53:08] long as faith left in other words as
[53:10] long as you believe you're saved
[53:12] when you doubt your salvation when all
[53:14] of us and you say no i'm a miserable
[53:15] wretched i can't make it and i'm you
[53:17] know i'm i'm i'm you know i no longer
[53:19] say brother says at that point then you
[53:21] no longer are that's right amen
[53:24] it's learning to rest yes
[53:27] it's learning to look beyond yourself
[53:29] it's learning to look beyond your
[53:30] shortcoming look beyond your fault and
[53:32] says why am i safe brother brad i'm in
[53:34] another place he said i'm not safe today
[53:36] because i can shout i'm not saying
[53:38] because i feel like i'm saved i'm saved
[53:40] because i met god's condition of the
[53:42] bible jesus says he that heareth my
[53:43] words and believeth on him that sent me
[53:45] has everlasting life and shall not come
[53:47] into condemnation with fasting he says i
[53:49] believe that that's right and on them
[53:51] conditions i am saved because god said
[53:53] so amen amen brother branson let me like
[53:56] with my feelings i don't rely upon my
[53:58] office i don't realize on anything else
[54:00] i rely upon the fact that i have
[54:02] accepted god's provision for me and on
[54:04] the basis of the word and the word only
[54:06] he said that is the basis of my
[54:08] salvation
[54:09] but here again so often we begin to look
[54:11] at ourselves we begin to think i have to
[54:13] earn something we begin to think that i
[54:15] have to do something in order in order
[54:17] to merit god's grace or god's mercy no
[54:20] you don't no right god's mercy and god's
[54:23] god's love and
[54:25] god loved you before you ever came into
[54:28] into existence
[54:29] amen he knew what you would be like as a
[54:31] child
[54:32] he knew all the mistakes you'd make of
[54:34] as you're a teenager right he knew all
[54:36] the mistakes in all your shortcomings
[54:37] and everything all the things that you
[54:39] would do wrong but he loved you anyway
[54:41] amen
[54:42] and then and then the gospel came by
[54:44] your path you accepted it as you
[54:46] accepted him as your savior and then you
[54:48] began a walk in your life it'd be a
[54:50] change in your in your life but see god
[54:52] also knows what you're going to do
[54:54] tomorrow right amen he knows every
[54:56] mistake that you're that you've made in
[54:58] the past he knows every mistake you'll
[54:59] make from here until the rapture that's
[55:01] right but he loved you
[55:02] and that's why he died on the cross for
[55:04] you amen and if you can accept this
[55:07] it gives you up of the ability to rest
[55:10] amen gives you the ability to go and say
[55:12] well lord i'm not perfect you're myself
[55:14] i'm relying upon what you have done for
[55:16] me at the cross and because of that he
[55:18] says i rest in my relationship with you
[55:20] i i rest because you have said that you
[55:23] love me for god so loved the world he
[55:25] gave his only son amen right yes
[55:27] why so he could redeem you that's right
[55:31] he could take it
[55:33] the bible is the story of of of of of
[55:36] of redemption
[55:38] redemption is restoring back into its
[55:40] original condition yes
[55:43] amen we were sons and daughters of god
[55:45] from the beginning
[55:46] yes sir when you were born you were son
[55:48] and daughter of god you just didn't know
[55:50] it yes right but in the process of time
[55:52] the gospel came across you you accepted
[55:54] it and so and so you've gone from a
[55:56] sinner saved by grace and when i was in
[55:58] the baptist church the emphasis was
[56:00] always on sinner
[56:02] you're a sinner
[56:03] say my grace
[56:04] but say in the message it tells me
[56:06] something different than that right it
[56:08] tells me i am a son of god that has been
[56:10] fully restored to my rightful position
[56:13] with my father
[56:14] i can go to my father and i because i am
[56:16] his son i can go to my father and
[56:18] brother branham says god would would
[56:20] rather hear you talk to him than he
[56:22] would the archangels that's right you
[56:24] have more power and authority with god
[56:25] than the archangels right because you're
[56:27] his son you're a part of him you were a
[56:29] part of him from the beginning amen and
[56:31] it's coming to this realization
[56:33] you know we look in the
[56:36] we we go through the church ages
[56:38] the church ages is talking about two
[56:40] different groups the true vine and the
[56:42] false vine
[56:43] but when you get into when you get into
[56:45] the ladies in church age
[56:47] it just talks about the false fire
[56:49] because they're lukewarm have need of
[56:51] nothing and all this other stuff
[56:53] and so god had to send a prophet to us
[56:56] to tell you no you are the pure virtuous
[56:58] sinless bride of jesus christ amen that
[57:01] is who you are yes you are not lady osea
[57:04] you are not lukewarm you are not you
[57:05] know you're not
[57:07] although it tends to affect our
[57:09] attitudes and some of the things we do
[57:11] but we god views us as the pure virtuous
[57:14] bride of jesus christ that is what we
[57:16] are in his sight praise the lord and he
[57:19] wants that relationship yes
[57:22] it's like i talked to the people when i
[57:24] was when i was in india um and that they
[57:27] have
[57:28] their marriages are arranged which has
[57:30] good points bad points
[57:32] um it would never go in the states i
[57:34] know that but anyway
[57:36] so somebody gets married
[57:38] and uh
[57:39] so one lives in delhi and one lives in
[57:41] in
[57:42] in chennai
[57:44] and uh so that you know they call each
[57:47] other up once a week say hi how are you
[57:49] doing i'm doing fine good okay i'll call
[57:51] you next week
[57:53] and too often that's our relationship
[57:55] with god yes oh yeah we come to church
[57:57] sunday oh hey god i'm here oh thank you
[57:59] for your blessings i'll call you next
[58:01] week when i when i have time you know
[58:03] but see if that's not a relationship
[58:05] amen no the relationship is when they
[58:07] move into the same house and they live
[58:08] in the same and they go to the bedroom
[58:10] and they they feast together they talk
[58:12] together um yeah you know we
[58:15] every married couple has
[58:18] adjustment time adjustment periods okay
[58:21] i'm she bends your way you bend her away
[58:25] hopefully
[58:26] and then you know things but anyway the
[58:28] relationship has been it's a mutual
[58:30] thing but see with us in jesus christ
[58:33] what is it all of a sudden he comes and
[58:35] lives inside of us amen and when he
[58:37] lives inside of us he's beginning to
[58:39] change us from the inside out right he's
[58:41] trying to mold us into the character
[58:43] that he wants us to be yes the bible
[58:45] says
[58:46] god has predestinated us to be into the
[58:48] adoption of children where he has
[58:50] predestined us to be conformed in the
[58:51] image of his son amen that is our
[58:54] destiny right we will come into the very
[58:57] image of jesus christ because god is
[58:58] already predetermined amen well how is
[59:01] that going to happen he says god's going
[59:02] to work in you to willing to do of his
[59:04] good pleasure
[59:05] it's god taking you and molding you from
[59:07] the inside out brother brown says when
[59:09] you accept jesus christ as your savior
[59:11] and the holy spirit comes in he says it
[59:13] comes in about the size of a button or
[59:14] your fingernail whatever
[59:17] but as you feed on the word
[59:19] he says it pushes out all the unbelief
[59:21] it pushes all the sin it pushes out all
[59:23] the corruption and puts out all the
[59:24] things of the world until eventually
[59:26] slowly and slowly slowly over time you
[59:29] begin to come into that very image you
[59:31] begin to think like you like jesus
[59:32] christ you begin to act like jesus
[59:34] christ
[59:36] the attributes of jesus christ but see
[59:38] it's all coming from the inside right
[59:40] under the law of men tried to adjust
[59:43] men tried by themselves to save
[59:45] themselves well the law says i can't
[59:47] well therefore i can't but i sure would
[59:48] like to but
[59:50] i can't do that because if i do that
[59:51] then you know the priest is going to
[59:52] come by and read me the riot act then i
[59:54] got to take a lamb i got to take it to
[59:56] him oh you know it's a bloody mess and i
[59:58] really want to go through all of that
[1:00:00] yeah but it's them trying by themselves
[1:00:02] yes
[1:00:03] but see with christ he says he takes his
[1:00:05] law and write it in our hearts and in
[1:00:06] our mind where literally it becomes a
[1:00:08] part of us
[1:00:09] yes we live the law because now it's our
[1:00:12] nature to live that law
[1:00:14] it's our nature to love our brothers
[1:00:16] because because the nature of god dwells
[1:00:18] in us amen
[1:00:20] my initially you know that all mine by
[1:00:22] this shall only know you are my
[1:00:24] disciples because you love each other
[1:00:26] amen right yeah well there's some people
[1:00:28] i
[1:00:28] i didn't but i'm learning too
[1:00:31] um you don't have that problem i i know
[1:00:33] that you know
[1:00:34] right but here but it's a change of a
[1:00:37] nature
[1:00:38] it's something inside of you that all of
[1:00:40] a sudden goes and and begins to conform
[1:00:43] you to the very image of jesus christ
[1:00:45] amen amen
[1:00:49] i i have eight daughters
[1:00:51] and one of my daughters brought this
[1:00:53] thing home
[1:00:55] and uh
[1:00:58] i mean he he took a bath maybe once a
[1:01:00] month
[1:01:01] he was a redneck he go out and shoot
[1:01:03] something and bled all over him and just
[1:01:05] nasty him drug addict at all
[1:01:08] and i figured
[1:01:10] i mean i treated the guy like trash
[1:01:14] and then god spoke to me and said you
[1:01:15] have to love him
[1:01:17] i says that's not an option
[1:01:19] i said there's no
[1:01:21] me love him and and him trying to have a
[1:01:23] relationship with my daughter and no
[1:01:26] that is not an option
[1:01:28] and he so god spoke to me says will you
[1:01:31] let me love him through you amen amen
[1:01:34] and i debated that
[1:01:37] and i finally said well
[1:01:39] well lord okay i will let you do that
[1:01:42] i was shocked at how i treated that guy
[1:01:46] next few times he came
[1:01:48] eventually he got tired of me and i
[1:01:50] could
[1:01:51] anyway he never came back and my opinion
[1:01:53] of him never changed
[1:01:56] but yet i learned something there that
[1:01:57] if i can yield myself to god yes
[1:02:00] god can do something through me that i
[1:02:02] and myself cannot do
[1:02:04] amen hallelujah and so i've had i've
[1:02:06] learned that down through other other
[1:02:08] resources and relationships i've had
[1:02:10] with other people yes
[1:02:14] but it comes out you know when we look
[1:02:16] at the people that
[1:02:17] in the bible that talks about the people
[1:02:19] that have faith from hebrew 11 chapter
[1:02:22] it talks an awful lot about abraham
[1:02:25] but you see if you study the life of
[1:02:27] abraham you'll find out that god
[1:02:29] appeared to abraham and we don't know in
[1:02:31] what form told him you leave your land
[1:02:33] of your nativity and all your friends
[1:02:35] and all your relations and stuff and go
[1:02:37] to a land i'm going to
[1:02:38] direct you to
[1:02:39] god didn't tell him where he was going
[1:02:41] abraham just had to follow
[1:02:44] so his dad moved up to heron and uh so
[1:02:47] abraham moved along with him
[1:02:49] and then god had to take abraham's
[1:02:52] father so abraham would actually go
[1:02:54] where god was sending him
[1:02:57] so then he goes down there's a migration
[1:02:59] from what i understand from heron down
[1:03:00] into palestine
[1:03:03] and there
[1:03:06] as they entered palestine god says this
[1:03:07] is the land i'm giving you
[1:03:09] but it was in it was time of a drought
[1:03:12] well
[1:03:13] this isn't much to brag about
[1:03:15] so he continued on down into egypt well
[1:03:18] egypt talks about self-reliance egypt is
[1:03:20] the world he i mean it talks it talks
[1:03:23] about us relying upon ourselves amen so
[1:03:25] god created circumstances to force
[1:03:27] abraham to go back into the land
[1:03:30] and over the period of time in abraham's
[1:03:32] life
[1:03:33] god began to mold him and get in and
[1:03:36] develop a relationship between abraham
[1:03:38] and god where abraham would believe god
[1:03:41] amen yes and finally i mean god told
[1:03:44] abraham he says you're going to have a
[1:03:45] have a son by your wife sarah
[1:03:48] and at 75 i mean that would have been
[1:03:51] difficult at 100 it's even more
[1:03:53] difficult right
[1:03:54] but yet it tells us in
[1:03:56] romans romans 4 says in being not weak
[1:03:59] in faith he considered not his own body
[1:04:01] no dead when he was about a hundred
[1:04:03] years old neither yet the deadness or
[1:04:04] sarah's will he's tagging out the
[1:04:06] promise of god through unbelief what was
[1:04:08] strong in faith giving glory to god
[1:04:10] having and and being fully persuaded
[1:04:14] that what he had promised he was able to
[1:04:16] perform amen
[1:04:18] right he believed that the god had given
[1:04:20] him the promise god had the ability to
[1:04:23] bring it to pass yes
[1:04:24] amen but see that's what comes in our
[1:04:27] lives
[1:04:28] by his rights you are healed amen
[1:04:31] do you do you believe that god has the
[1:04:33] ability to bring that promise to pass
[1:04:35] amen yes yes sir if you believe that god
[1:04:38] has the ability to heal you
[1:04:41] if you believe that god has the ability
[1:04:42] to bring to pass that which he promised
[1:04:44] unto you then at that point you just say
[1:04:46] well lord i thank you for my healing and
[1:04:48] you walk on
[1:04:49] amen well the symptoms are still there
[1:04:51] well
[1:04:52] are you looking at the symptoms are you
[1:04:54] looking at the promise amen because see
[1:04:56] this is where this is the battle that we
[1:04:58] have in our mind
[1:04:59] well but i still have the symptoms well
[1:05:00] i still don't feel good well i still
[1:05:02] well abraham didn't look he looked at
[1:05:04] his in his body and he looked at the
[1:05:06] body of his wife in 25 for 25 years he
[1:05:09] had to wait
[1:05:11] well
[1:05:12] so maybe you have to wait a week maybe
[1:05:13] you have to wait a month
[1:05:15] right
[1:05:16] right but see god made a promise right
[1:05:19] and so it's in the promise you learn how
[1:05:20] to rest amen lord you promised it thank
[1:05:23] you i cannot heal it i cannot bring it
[1:05:25] to path but since you made the promise
[1:05:27] to me i am accepting that promise even
[1:05:30] you know we say oh the lord heals well
[1:05:32] that's good
[1:05:33] but until you make it a personal thing
[1:05:35] to a personal promise to you it really
[1:05:37] doesn't take effect right you say lord
[1:05:40] you have you you say by his stripes i am
[1:05:42] healed
[1:05:44] well if you say i am healed then i am
[1:05:46] healed yes and now i'm waiting for you
[1:05:48] to manifest it in my body it doesn't
[1:05:50] matter if it takes a week a month a year
[1:05:52] whatever it takes no you have promised
[1:05:54] and therefore i might you have obligated
[1:05:56] yourself by your word to heal me amen
[1:05:59] amen and then you rest in that amen
[1:06:02] this wouldn't be the struggle anymore
[1:06:04] you just rest in that amen
[1:06:06] thank you lord it's like brother branham
[1:06:08] gives the example he said there was a
[1:06:10] lady that came by a lady i think in her
[1:06:12] neighbor they were in prayer line
[1:06:14] and so they came by and brother branham
[1:06:16] says the lady had a stomach ailment i
[1:06:18] think the other lady had a goiter or
[1:06:19] something on her neck
[1:06:21] and so they went home and uh the lady
[1:06:24] was climbing it
[1:06:25] and her husband kept after a while he
[1:06:27] says he said how are you making a
[1:06:28] reproach you know
[1:06:30] everybody looks at you like you're crazy
[1:06:32] you still can't eat
[1:06:34] there's no there's nothing in your body
[1:06:36] that nothing has changed
[1:06:39] but she said i stood before a man who
[1:06:41] did not know who i was he told me my
[1:06:44] name he told me the address where i was
[1:06:46] living he told me the condition i had
[1:06:48] if god could through him speak to me and
[1:06:50] tell me those things i have faith in
[1:06:52] that god that god will bring it to the
[1:06:54] past amen
[1:06:56] and i don't know a week or a month or
[1:06:58] whatever the time framing was went by
[1:06:59] and all of a sudden god visited that
[1:07:01] neighborhood right
[1:07:03] and then she sat down and had a cup of
[1:07:04] coffee and burnt toast or toast anyway
[1:07:07] or something like that
[1:07:08] and she was waiting you know for her
[1:07:10] stomach to all of a sudden give it all
[1:07:12] back out
[1:07:13] and all of a sudden she said well no
[1:07:16] god's healed me amen
[1:07:18] because even our pastor was was giving
[1:07:20] you know reading of the right what are
[1:07:22] you doing with this i mean you're you're
[1:07:24] testifying you're healing and look at
[1:07:25] you you can't even eat yet thank you she
[1:07:28] said but she had faith in the god that
[1:07:30] had made the promise amen
[1:07:32] if she had begun to doubt no it wouldn't
[1:07:35] he would never would have had her
[1:07:36] healing right but yes he continued to
[1:07:38] confess it
[1:07:40] god honored that and god brought it to
[1:07:42] pass yes amen we look at another man
[1:07:45] named david
[1:07:46] david was a man he was out there minding
[1:07:48] his own business or and taking care of
[1:07:50] his dead sheep a lion came in
[1:07:53] and he had to go to he had to go out and
[1:07:55] take and kill the lion to rescue the
[1:07:57] lamb yeah a little while later a bear
[1:07:59] came in he had to go and he had to
[1:08:01] rescue that lamb
[1:08:03] god was training him yes
[1:08:06] because there was a day he was going to
[1:08:07] have to face goliath amen right
[1:08:10] and so what did he do he said when all
[1:08:12] of a sudden uh
[1:08:13] when when he stood before saul because
[1:08:15] goliath had made the challenge
[1:08:17] and david related to saul says as god
[1:08:19] delivered the lion and the bear into my
[1:08:21] hands he's going to deliver that man
[1:08:22] into my hand yes he had faith amen
[1:08:25] and so he went out believing that god
[1:08:27] was going to deliver goliath into his
[1:08:29] hand if he did if he went like the other
[1:08:32] soldiers well i don't know if i can you
[1:08:33] know if this is wrong or this will work
[1:08:36] no but he had faith to believe because
[1:08:37] he had a relationship with god praise
[1:08:39] the lord but there was a time david was
[1:08:42] out there minding his own business and
[1:08:44] and his father sent a runner out to
[1:08:46] where he was at
[1:08:48] and and he said hey your dad wants to
[1:08:50] see you
[1:08:51] so he goes walking back into the house
[1:08:53] and there's this crazy old man had a
[1:08:55] horn with some oil in it
[1:08:57] and and and
[1:08:59] and anyway i think it was samuel anyway
[1:09:01] and he looked at david he said ah you're
[1:09:03] the next king of israel yes pops the
[1:09:05] cork on the horn of oil and dumps it all
[1:09:07] over david's head
[1:09:08] so david's standing there dripping with
[1:09:09] his oil
[1:09:12] i'm going to be what
[1:09:14] you're the next king of israel
[1:09:16] oh yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh
[1:09:18] so what did david do did he run to saul
[1:09:20] say hey i'm going to be the next king to
[1:09:22] teach me how to be a king
[1:09:24] no he went back to the sheep
[1:09:26] but then god brought circumstances to
[1:09:28] pass in his life where he would sit in
[1:09:30] saul's court and he would see how
[1:09:32] how it worked yeah he would see how the
[1:09:34] governing worked amen but then saul
[1:09:35] became mad at him and so saul tried to
[1:09:38] kill him yeah
[1:09:39] but see all the time that david was
[1:09:41] running for his life
[1:09:43] there was something in his head that
[1:09:45] says i god has told me i will be the
[1:09:47] next king
[1:09:49] so god will have to sustain me god will
[1:09:51] have to watch over me god will have to
[1:09:53] protect me right but god is going to
[1:09:54] have to make the way he said i'm not
[1:09:56] going to kill king saul no god has to
[1:09:58] bring it to the right amen amen
[1:10:00] but here again but the constant
[1:10:03] knowledge that god himself had promised
[1:10:05] that he was to be the next king it is on
[1:10:07] that promise that he relied
[1:10:10] god was going to bring it to pass yes
[1:10:12] but see it comes in all of our lives
[1:10:14] with the things which we do sure we have
[1:10:16] no guarantee for tomorrow
[1:10:19] i mean our illustrious president can sit
[1:10:21] there and drive oh yeah we're having
[1:10:22] this pandemic we're going to sit the
[1:10:23] whole country down for the next six
[1:10:25] months
[1:10:26] and everything would shut down
[1:10:28] your businesses and everything would go
[1:10:31] your bank accounts would go everything
[1:10:33] would go
[1:10:35] what do we rely on
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] we have to rely on the promise god has
[1:10:41] given us yes right amen amen
[1:10:45] we go and i i look at brother brown's i
[1:10:47] studied a couple of years back i i
[1:10:49] studied his life i i've managed to read
[1:10:52] all the sermons i didn't listen to all
[1:10:53] of them but i managed to read them
[1:10:55] because i was interesting how did god
[1:10:57] deal with brother branham over time
[1:11:00] brother branham when he was born he was
[1:11:02] a prophet
[1:11:03] when he was born he was born to be the
[1:11:05] prophet to this generation and he was to
[1:11:07] be the mouthpiece of god to this
[1:11:09] generation amen
[1:11:14] i mean the angel visited him a couple
[1:11:15] times you know when you be a whirlwind
[1:11:18] in a tree you know don't eat or drink
[1:11:19] and defy your body there's a work for
[1:11:21] you when you get older
[1:11:22] but he had to get saved first
[1:11:26] he was a renegade he was he was a rough
[1:11:28] character
[1:11:30] um
[1:11:31] he refused to he refused to accept
[1:11:33] christ until god got him down to his
[1:11:35] deathbed
[1:11:37] and finally got
[1:11:38] brother brown healed he said okay if you
[1:11:40] if you will let me live he says that
[1:11:42] i'll serve you
[1:11:44] after that then he then god began to
[1:11:46] deal with him more in the visions and
[1:11:47] stuff like that and he had faith in the
[1:11:49] visions because every vision he had
[1:11:51] always came to pass
[1:11:53] amen later on in his life he began to go
[1:11:56] through the scriptures and he look at
[1:11:58] how god was dealing with him through
[1:12:00] visions and stuff he says well this is
[1:12:01] how god deals with with with prophets
[1:12:05] then he acknowledged he was the pr he
[1:12:07] was a prophet
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:09] and then when the discernments began to
[1:12:11] come then all of a sudden he really he
[1:12:12] went to the script the scripture was
[1:12:15] brother
[1:12:16] absolute amen hallelujah it wasn't
[1:12:18] something he conjured up in his mind
[1:12:20] this revelation or that no everything
[1:12:22] had to go back to the word everything
[1:12:24] had to be found in the pages of this
[1:12:26] book yes that's right so when all of a
[1:12:28] sudden the discernment came he said oh
[1:12:30] well this is how god dealt with with
[1:12:32] abraham and sarah then he would turn his
[1:12:34] back to the people so you see see that
[1:12:36] god is here
[1:12:38] and he's doing the same thing through me
[1:12:40] that he did through that angel that
[1:12:41] visited abraham and sarah
[1:12:43] and so he he began to acknowledge he
[1:12:46] began to to to relate to that
[1:12:49] he always believed that
[1:12:52] billy graham was the messenger to this
[1:12:54] age
[1:12:55] he did that until 63.
[1:12:57] because in 62
[1:12:59] we had
[1:13:01] nixon you know kennedy got elected
[1:13:03] president
[1:13:04] and then he looked at his visions book
[1:13:06] and said well he says
[1:13:07] you know the women's vote he said put
[1:13:09] this man in
[1:13:11] he said
[1:13:12] so where where are we at in time that's
[1:13:14] when he preached the church ages
[1:13:16] and after he preached the church ages
[1:13:18] then the angel spoke to him now you go
[1:13:20] read malachi 4.
[1:13:22] and then became the awareness no i'm the
[1:13:25] messenger to this age
[1:13:27] and that changed
[1:13:29] but then it wasn't until the opening of
[1:13:31] the seals
[1:13:32] he said because he texted about you know
[1:13:34] when
[1:13:35] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:13:36] angel and he shall begin to sound the
[1:13:38] mystery of god should be finished
[1:13:40] he said he said the angel didn't begin
[1:13:42] to sound until the opening of the seals
[1:13:45] and then he says there has been a
[1:13:46] message committed to me i have to be
[1:13:48] obedient to amen amen so there was a
[1:13:50] progression in all of his life
[1:13:53] he had he had to go from just being a
[1:13:55] baptist preacher and he had to go
[1:13:57] through acknowledging he was a prophet
[1:13:59] he had to acknowledge that god was
[1:14:00] working in him the same way he appeared
[1:14:02] in the neighborhood to
[1:14:03] abraham and sarah
[1:14:06] but see when you were born
[1:14:08] you were sons and daughters of god
[1:14:11] we are to be the final voice of the
[1:14:13] final age
[1:14:14] amen brother brown talks about that
[1:14:18] but it takes more than just a mental
[1:14:20] conception it takes a relationship amen
[1:14:23] brother brown over his time he developed
[1:14:25] a relationship with god
[1:14:27] it was that relationship with god that
[1:14:29] sustained him through all the trials and
[1:14:31] troubles that he went through in his
[1:14:32] ministry
[1:14:34] and you know their brother branham
[1:14:35] relates one story
[1:14:38] he said he was
[1:14:40] he was flying i think he was flying home
[1:14:42] and all of a sudden either there was a
[1:14:44] weather pattern something or the engine
[1:14:46] car that the plane developed the problem
[1:14:48] anyway it had to land in nashville
[1:14:51] and they put him in a hotel and the next
[1:14:52] day they will come get you and you know
[1:14:54] we'll get you home
[1:14:56] so he gets down he was going to go out
[1:14:58] there and mail a letter i think it was
[1:14:59] or something like that and god just told
[1:15:01] him keep walking
[1:15:02] right
[1:15:03] he says but they're gonna he says no
[1:15:05] walk where am i going no
[1:15:08] walk
[1:15:09] so he walked he did not know where he
[1:15:11] was going he had no clue what what god
[1:15:13] was intending for him to do but he knew
[1:15:15] to be obedient because of the
[1:15:17] relationship he had with amen
[1:15:19] so he's walking down into the poor
[1:15:22] section of town
[1:15:24] and there's this lady sitting there
[1:15:25] colored woman
[1:15:27] and uh she said morning parson
[1:15:30] he said well how do you know i was a
[1:15:32] person
[1:15:33] well god showed me you were coming amen
[1:15:36] i've been here you know since what
[1:15:38] however early in the morning it was
[1:15:41] oh by the way where's i think is this
[1:15:43] hat or very briefcase one of the other
[1:15:45] my memory doesn't serve me
[1:15:47] that well all the time
[1:15:49] but see she had a relationship with god
[1:15:52] amen she did not know he was a prophet
[1:15:55] she did not know the mystery of the
[1:15:56] seven seals he didn't know the mystery
[1:15:58] of the church age right right she did
[1:16:00] not know any she didn't know anything
[1:16:01] about him his ministry or anything that
[1:16:03] he was doing she was interested in the
[1:16:05] salvation of her son amen but she had a
[1:16:07] relationship such that she could pray
[1:16:10] and god would stop that plane bring it
[1:16:12] unto them brother branham could go
[1:16:14] minister to right but see when i look at
[1:16:16] people in in the message i keep
[1:16:19] wondering what is our relationship like
[1:16:21] come on do we have the same relationship
[1:16:23] that sister had right do we have the
[1:16:25] same relationship where we could pray
[1:16:27] and all of a sudden god would ground the
[1:16:28] plane so some minister can come by and
[1:16:30] minister to our needs amen do we have
[1:16:32] the same relationship that she had
[1:16:35] because it's going to take that in our
[1:16:37] lives in order to be able to sustain
[1:16:38] what's coming yes sir amen
[1:16:46] it's interesting when i look going back
[1:16:48] to looking at habakkuk
[1:16:50] habitat had to come to a relationship
[1:16:52] with god where he trusted god literally
[1:16:54] for everything amen
[1:16:57] in in havoc 3 and 16 it says when i
[1:17:00] heard my belly trembled my lips quivered
[1:17:02] at the voice rottnest entered into my
[1:17:04] bones and i trembled in myself that i
[1:17:06] might rest in the day of trouble when he
[1:17:08] when he cometh up unto the people he
[1:17:10] will invade them with his troops
[1:17:13] this man was scared
[1:17:15] because he did not know that when when
[1:17:17] the assyrians came if he would survive
[1:17:21] when they when the syrians would go in
[1:17:23] there they would they they killed
[1:17:25] because they like to kill yeah they like
[1:17:27] to torture
[1:17:28] people and havoc in my opinion he was
[1:17:31] scared for his own life
[1:17:33] but yet he goes on and because
[1:17:36] his relationship with god he goes
[1:17:38] although the fig tree shall not blossom
[1:17:41] neither shall the fruit be in the vines
[1:17:43] the labor of the olives will fade on the
[1:17:45] fields shall you'll know me right the
[1:17:47] flocks will be cut off from the foal and
[1:17:48] there shall be no no hurt in the stalls
[1:17:51] there will be total utter devastation
[1:17:54] he says yet i will rejoice in the lord i
[1:17:57] will joy
[1:17:58] and the god of my salvation
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:01] when the pandemic hit i this was the
[1:18:04] first sermon or part of them like this i
[1:18:06] preached to those in india
[1:18:08] i says you have to come to a place in
[1:18:10] your relationship with god that havoca
[1:18:13] came in his relationship with his god
[1:18:15] that if you have nothing
[1:18:17] it will not change your relationship
[1:18:19] with you amen right you will still
[1:18:21] worship him yes and the wording here in
[1:18:24] in heaven
[1:18:25] it's not just like you know i will
[1:18:26] rejoice in the door no i will shout i
[1:18:28] will dance i will rejoice i will i will
[1:18:31] i will uh i will do all the all the
[1:18:33] emotions and all the other things that
[1:18:35] you can possibly imagine yes with his
[1:18:37] whole body he would rejoice and he will
[1:18:39] praise his brother amen
[1:18:41] even though he had nothing
[1:18:43] amen that's right and that was the thing
[1:18:45] i try to tell him in india even though
[1:18:47] you have nothing
[1:18:48] even though you come down to the place
[1:18:50] there's no food for your plate even
[1:18:51] though they're you know you have total
[1:18:54] devastation i said you have to develop
[1:18:56] the relationship with god that habakkuk
[1:18:58] has yes because that is the only thing
[1:19:00] that will sustain you amen and i look at
[1:19:03] what's going on in our country
[1:19:05] the only thing that's going to sustain
[1:19:07] us and what's coming
[1:19:08] we have to have this kind of a
[1:19:10] relationship amen we have to come to the
[1:19:12] place where we have so much faith in god
[1:19:15] that it doesn't matter if there's
[1:19:16] anything on the table or or whatever
[1:19:18] there happens to be and he will still
[1:19:20] believe and trust god yes going back and
[1:19:22] and the result of the intercessor
[1:19:25] the guy had an orphanage
[1:19:27] and uh
[1:19:29] people would bring food by and stuff
[1:19:30] like that you know to feed the orphan
[1:19:33] and that that morning there was nothing
[1:19:36] i mean the cupboard was bare and
[1:19:37] literally there was nothing to put
[1:19:38] before the kids
[1:19:40] and god spoken and says well if you had
[1:19:42] the food what would you do
[1:19:44] well we'd bless it
[1:19:46] well
[1:19:48] so they began to pray and thank god for
[1:19:50] the food that they're about to partake
[1:19:52] of and there was nothing on the table
[1:19:54] and thank god for the for the food
[1:19:55] that's on the table and all the other
[1:19:57] types of stuff and he said amen about
[1:19:59] that time there was a knock on the door
[1:20:01] a bread truck had just broke down in
[1:20:02] front of his of his of the orphanage
[1:20:06] yeah and the guy had to unload all the
[1:20:07] bread because he couldn't deliver it
[1:20:10] because they only had fresh bed back
[1:20:12] then yeah and so all of a sudden all the
[1:20:14] bread that was in that truck all of a
[1:20:15] sudden got given to the orphanage and
[1:20:17] that was the food for the people
[1:20:19] right but god already knew what was
[1:20:21] going to happen and god says well he
[1:20:23] says why don't you
[1:20:24] you know there's nothing on the table
[1:20:26] fine why don't you bless the food why
[1:20:27] don't you pray for it why don't you give
[1:20:28] thanks for it amen so they did and they
[1:20:30] said amen and all of a sudden god opened
[1:20:32] you know provided
[1:20:33] but it has to come in our life what is
[1:20:36] god going to do for us
[1:20:39] we live in troubled times
[1:20:41] we live in times where there's
[1:20:42] absolutely no guarantee for tomorrow
[1:20:44] amen we don't know about our jobs we
[1:20:46] don't know about our income we don't
[1:20:47] know about our government we don't have
[1:20:49] no idea what's coming yes but yet if we
[1:20:51] we have to have this relationship
[1:20:54] we have to come to the place where we
[1:20:56] have such a faith in god that regardless
[1:20:58] of what comes it we will still rejoice
[1:21:01] in our god we will steal joy and the god
[1:21:03] of ours amen
[1:21:04] praise the lord
[1:21:06] brother branham says
[1:21:07] says in the fundamental
[1:21:10] fundamental foundations of faith he says
[1:21:13] faith with you actually it's something
[1:21:14] that's unconscious
[1:21:16] it's something you don't really know
[1:21:19] that you have
[1:21:21] he talks about in another swear by
[1:21:23] himself he talks about jesus christ
[1:21:27] he says but faith is unconscious you've
[1:21:29] got faith and don't even know it that's
[1:21:30] why she's jesus christ no matter if he
[1:21:32] was in the storm and the gale's knocking
[1:21:34] the boat from one side to the other or
[1:21:36] it was standing the face of a mass of
[1:21:37] demons or if he was hanging anywhere it
[1:21:39] never moved him he walked right along
[1:21:42] just as calm and quiet as he could be
[1:21:44] wife he was simply unconscious of fear
[1:21:46] of anything that was around him amen
[1:21:48] because he knew god was in control yes
[1:21:52] amen praise the lord do we understand
[1:21:54] god is in control yes amen because if we
[1:21:57] can put if we if we can transition
[1:22:00] ourselves to the place where we actually
[1:22:02] believe that god is in control then we
[1:22:04] don't know what tomorrow will bring

[1:23:47] faith he said you you just walked well
[1:23:50] i'm going home i'm going to go out and
[1:23:52] start the car he said that's all an act
[1:23:54] of faith tomorrow i meet you there at a
[1:23:55] certain place he says that's all an act
[1:23:57] of faith you've just done it so much
[1:23:58] it's just a regular routine right amen
[1:24:01] so i mean
[1:24:03] you go out you take a car
[1:24:05] you're assuming it's going to start
[1:24:07] there's no question
[1:24:08] put the key in the ignition or now you
[1:24:10] push the button or however they work it
[1:24:13] but it's happening all the time and so
[1:24:16] yeah it's going to start it always
[1:24:17] starts
[1:24:18] you know right you walk into a dark room
[1:24:21] the first thing you reach for is the
[1:24:22] light switch you flip the switch you
[1:24:23] expect light yeah right
[1:24:25] because there's no question amen but see
[1:24:27] that's supreme faith
[1:24:29] but see that has to come to our
[1:24:30] relationship with god what is supreme
[1:24:32] faith well god has always done it god's
[1:24:34] healed me in the past i expect him to
[1:24:36] heal me and amen so you just walk on
[1:24:38] believing yes if you believe it god will
[1:24:40] bring it to pass right i mean it talks
[1:24:42] of a relationship abraham had to come to
[1:24:45] the belief in the fact that god had made
[1:24:47] a promise and he believed in the god
[1:24:49] that had made the promise that god had
[1:24:51] the ability to bring it to pass amen but
[1:24:53] see we have to come down to the same
[1:24:55] relationship we have to come down to
[1:24:57] having the same faith that abraham had
[1:24:59] to believe that whatever god had
[1:25:01] promised us god will perform it because
[1:25:03] he promised it praise the lord it's not
[1:25:05] it's not we promised it ourselves no god
[1:25:07] himself promises yes
[1:25:10] and he said that's the way the things of
[1:25:11] god are after you have trusted him and
[1:25:13] watched him do so many things till it
[1:25:15] becomes just a regular routine
[1:25:18] and that's the condition i think the
[1:25:19] church will be in just before the coming
[1:25:21] of the lord so the rapture will just go
[1:25:23] right on that way it'll just be a
[1:25:25] regular routine of following the
[1:25:26] scriptures and the plan of god amen in
[1:25:28] other words you will develop such a
[1:25:30] relationship between you and your god
[1:25:33] that you have absolute faith and trust
[1:25:35] in him
[1:25:36] and
[1:25:37] and all of a sudden it will come time
[1:25:39] for the rapture and because you have
[1:25:41] walked with him and trusted him yes oh
[1:25:43] yeah now it's the time for the changing
[1:25:45] of my body
[1:25:46] for it
[1:25:48] and all of a sudden i'm looking for that
[1:25:50] i'm looking for amen i'm losing about
[1:25:53] 60 pounds in about 60 years all at once
[1:25:56] you know
[1:25:58] amen but i mean but
[1:26:02] i believe god will do it yes
[1:26:04] i have no question i cannot perform it
[1:26:07] i cannot change my body believe me if i
[1:26:09] could i would yeah but i cannot do it
[1:26:12] but i believe in the god that has made
[1:26:14] the promise yeah he changed mine amen
[1:26:16] because he told me he was right amen why
[1:26:19] did god send the prophet to give us the
[1:26:21] faith to believe in the god that and the
[1:26:22] god that had made the promises right why
[1:26:25] did god have why did god had to send
[1:26:26] moses in to end egypt
[1:26:29] because god to them was a god of history
[1:26:32] the god of abraham isaac and jacob fine
[1:26:34] that was 400 years ago
[1:26:36] well what is this god what is the god of
[1:26:38] my fathers what does he do what can you
[1:26:40] what can he do we're in slavery
[1:26:43] so god sent moses they performed
[1:26:45] miracles
[1:26:46] they came to mount horeb and what did
[1:26:48] they do all of a sudden lightnings and
[1:26:50] thunderings and earthquake they became
[1:26:52] aware that this god that had called them
[1:26:54] and chosen them and delivered them from
[1:26:56] egypt this god had power and almighty to
[1:26:58] be able to do anything yes
[1:27:02] but they never were able to grasp hold
[1:27:04] of the fact that that god
[1:27:06] would do it for them right hmm
[1:27:09] but see too many christians it's the
[1:27:11] same
[1:27:12] oh yeah we saw it in brother branham oh
[1:27:14] yeah we saw god do this we saw god do
[1:27:16] that but will he do it through me
[1:27:19] will he do it through you
[1:27:22] um i don't think my wife would mind this
[1:27:24] she worked in labor and delivery for a
[1:27:25] while
[1:27:27] and uh
[1:27:28] i don't know how many births she was
[1:27:29] involved in but
[1:27:31] but all of a sudden a woman would come
[1:27:33] in and she would be having difficulties
[1:27:35] maybe not the one she was with but there
[1:27:37] was another one because you're hearing
[1:27:39] the nurses talk
[1:27:41] and so she heard about the problem this
[1:27:42] lady was having
[1:27:44] and all of a sudden things changed
[1:27:48] my wife began to pray
[1:27:50] and there is to combine you've been
[1:27:52] praying haven't you
[1:27:55] yeah yeah right and everything changed
[1:27:57] amen
[1:27:59] she was acting as an intercessor
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] okay
[1:28:04] can you
[1:28:05] amen
[1:28:07] do you have the faith to believe that if
[1:28:08] you pray to god god will hear you yes
[1:28:10] yes amen if you believe god will hear
[1:28:11] your prayer then don't you expect to
[1:28:13] have a response don't you expect the
[1:28:14] answer amen i mean it's that simple we
[1:28:16] make we make christianity so difficult
[1:28:19] but it's not right right right it's
[1:28:21] simple the whole gospel is simple yes
[1:28:23] believe in the lord jesus christ and
[1:28:25] your house will be saved
[1:28:26] you have to believe that yes okay
[1:28:28] by his rights i'm healed okay amen you
[1:28:31] say i am therefore i am now i just wait
[1:28:33] for the manifestation
[1:28:35] it's that simple yes
[1:28:37] the problem we have is what we dwell in
[1:28:39] right and satan keeps telling you oh no
[1:28:41] you're not oh no you're not symptoms are
[1:28:43] still there see you're not healed yeah i
[1:28:45] am because god said i was that's right
[1:28:47] okay amen
[1:28:49] true
[1:28:56] who's rich in mercy brother brown goes
[1:28:57] on and says i'm not only saying this not
[1:28:59] to mix up doctrine but to strain it out
[1:29:01] that we might get away from this fear
[1:29:02] and the scare
[1:29:04] you don't know who you are
[1:29:07] in other words you're afraid to
[1:29:08] acknowledge the fact that you are a son
[1:29:11] and a daughter of god
[1:29:12] amen you're afraid to step into the
[1:29:14] office or the position that god has
[1:29:16] called you to be in yes you always were
[1:29:19] sons and daughters amen but it's time
[1:29:22] for us to not just look at our flesh and
[1:29:24] look at our shortcomings and look at our
[1:29:25] fault but it's time to believe no god
[1:29:27] said i am a son of god amen i was a son
[1:29:30] of god when i was born i have come into
[1:29:32] i've accepted christ as my savior god
[1:29:34] has sent a prophet to me and that
[1:29:35] prophet to me told me
[1:29:37] am the virtue of sin was bride of jesus
[1:29:39] christ and because i am that he says now
[1:29:41] i'm i want i'm i i need to step into the
[1:29:44] position god has called me to be amen
[1:29:46] brother brown had to do that down
[1:29:48] through his ministry he had to step into
[1:29:50] the office of a prophet he had to step
[1:29:51] into the discernment he had to step in
[1:29:53] to be acknowledging he was the messenger
[1:29:55] he had to step into being the seventh
[1:29:57] amen he had to step into those offices
[1:30:00] and and once he stepped into him then
[1:30:02] god could use him in that capacity yes
[1:30:04] but until you are willing to acknowledge
[1:30:06] you are sons and daughters of god and
[1:30:08] and quit looking looking past yourself
[1:30:10] and your shortcomings and your faults
[1:30:11] and your failures and begin to say no
[1:30:13] god said this is what i am because he
[1:30:15] said this is what i am now i'm supposed
[1:30:17] to step into that because i am to
[1:30:19] manifest jesus christ that's exciting i
[1:30:21] have to be the final voice of the final
[1:30:23] age i read the final manifestation of
[1:30:24] god to this world before god takes me
[1:30:26] home amen true and true amen and that's
[1:30:28] what we have to step into thank you lord
[1:30:30] to acknowledge that and accept it
[1:30:33] right
[1:30:35] you are not going to be
[1:30:37] see you are not going to be but now you
[1:30:40] are the sons of god so you always were
[1:30:41] sons of god when god had you in his
[1:30:43] thinking in the beginning
[1:30:46] and brother in the seven church ages he
[1:30:48] knows that the people can get a true
[1:30:50] revelation of the true church
[1:30:52] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:30:54] she can do the greater works she will be
[1:30:56] an invincible army amen
[1:31:00] so we are
[1:31:02] but you have to believe it right
[1:31:05] you have to believe in the god that has
[1:31:07] called you amen yes it's not you
[1:31:10] overcoming it's god overcoming through
[1:31:12] you amen it's not you performing
[1:31:14] miracles it's god performing miracles
[1:31:16] through you that's right amen jesus
[1:31:17] christ never performed a miracle
[1:31:19] he says it's not it's not me it's just
[1:31:21] the father that dwells in me he does
[1:31:22] them right brother branham says i always
[1:31:24] just happened to be in the water when
[1:31:26] all of a sudden the angel came down in
[1:31:27] 30 right yeah i was just standing there
[1:31:30] when all of a sudden god used my voice
[1:31:31] to speak to somebody yes i was just
[1:31:33] standing there when this happened i was
[1:31:34] just happy to be standing there when
[1:31:36] this happened
[1:31:37] he never took it to himself right he
[1:31:39] never said i did this and i did this no
[1:31:42] he said i just happened to be there and
[1:31:43] god did this and god did this and god
[1:31:45] did that amen but see we but we have to
[1:31:47] begin we have to come to the place where
[1:31:49] god can lead us and guide us to the
[1:31:51] place that's no longer us and it's no
[1:31:53] longer us struggling and striving to
[1:31:54] produce something but it's us dying out
[1:31:56] to ourselves something god could live
[1:31:58] his life through god yes amen that is
[1:32:00] christianity right he does not expect
[1:32:03] you to live a christian life
[1:32:05] he expects you to die to yourself so he
[1:32:07] can live his life through you amen right
[1:32:09] amen yes lord and that's the secret of
[1:32:12] being a christian hallelujah it's not
[1:32:14] you striving to obtain
[1:32:17] it's you're dying out so he can live his
[1:32:19] life through you amen
[1:32:21] right
[1:32:23] one last thought in here my wife and i
[1:32:25] when we went to india
[1:32:27] in 2020 i think it was yeah
[1:32:30] before this government hit
[1:32:33] i was just sitting in a week or i don't
[1:32:35] know maybe a month before that i was
[1:32:37] just opening my bible you know be quiet
[1:32:39] in church and settle your subtle mind
[1:32:41] down getting ready for the word amen i
[1:32:43] turn isaiah 31
[1:32:45] i said where are them to go down to
[1:32:47] egypt for help and stay on horses and
[1:32:48] trust in chariots because they are many
[1:32:50] and horsemen because they are very
[1:32:52] strong but they look not unto the holy
[1:32:54] one of israel and neither seek the lord
[1:32:57] i read that in another in verse three it
[1:32:59] says now the egyptians are men and not
[1:33:01] god
[1:33:02] the horses are flesh and not spirit
[1:33:06] and i i got to thinking about that yeah
[1:33:08] that that
[1:33:09] why do i always go back to myself
[1:33:12] why do i always rely upon myself why do
[1:33:15] i always rely upon my abilities
[1:33:18] and then we were flying into into india
[1:33:21] we left
[1:33:23] london
[1:33:24] and we're flying into hyderabad which i
[1:33:27] think is about 10 or 12 hour flight
[1:33:29] and the food's not what it used to be in
[1:33:31] the airlines but food is food
[1:33:34] and
[1:33:35] so i was eating mine and i noticed
[1:33:37] shirley wasn't eating any of hers and i
[1:33:39] figured well what's wrong so i asked her
[1:33:41] she's i got this severe headache
[1:33:43] oh
[1:33:44] okay
[1:33:45] so i figured well okay four or five
[1:33:47] hours we'll land in hyder bed we got
[1:33:49] pills and they're you know checked in in
[1:33:52] the belly of the beast so to speak
[1:33:54] and uh yeah then you'll go to bed and
[1:33:57] sleep and you know a couple days you'll
[1:33:58] feel fine
[1:34:00] and then god reminded me of this verse
[1:34:04] why do you always go to egypt
[1:34:06] right why do you always turn to yourself
[1:34:08] right why do you always turn to your
[1:34:10] abilities why do you always think you
[1:34:12] can handle it right yeah
[1:34:15] oh
[1:34:16] so
[1:34:16] i repented and
[1:34:19] says lord we're going here because we
[1:34:21] feel led to go we here we believe we are
[1:34:25] we were going because of of your
[1:34:27] leadership and your guidance believing
[1:34:29] and trying to fulfill your will
[1:34:31] but satan has harassed my wife and she
[1:34:33] has such a severe headache really she
[1:34:35] can't she can't eat
[1:34:38] and so i says lord i want
[1:34:40] i ask you to heal her
[1:34:42] and a couple hours later
[1:34:44] headache was gone
[1:34:47] amen god was trying me
[1:34:49] and there's a couple things happening in
[1:34:51] india
[1:34:53] where god here again
[1:34:55] took me to this
[1:34:57] i mean
[1:35:02] we we hit a dip in the road and they
[1:35:03] were going too fast
[1:35:05] and uh her head hit this even with the
[1:35:08] seat belt on her head hit the ceiling of
[1:35:10] the car and gave her a
[1:35:12] concussion i figured lord i need you now
[1:35:16] right because i mean we were out in the
[1:35:18] boonies yeah
[1:35:20] so i said lord please undertake
[1:35:23] the lord did amen
[1:35:25] and since that time and like even
[1:35:27] getting home it says well lord
[1:35:30] i'm not going to rely upon me to do what
[1:35:32] i'm doing i i need your guidance amen we
[1:35:35] have a guy like orders you know him he
[1:35:38] worked for duke power
[1:35:40] and uh he would he was in charge of his
[1:35:42] son he worked for 40 years i think some
[1:35:44] ridiculous number of years
[1:35:46] anyway he was in charge of a substation
[1:35:50] they called him and says we have a
[1:35:51] problem with the power or something like
[1:35:52] that and he went into the well i don't
[1:35:54] know if they have dials or switches or
[1:35:55] what they've got in there
[1:35:57] but he said lord you have to show me
[1:35:58] where the problem is because nothing
[1:36:00] here makes
[1:36:01] everything looks fine right and god
[1:36:03] directed him to an area ah that's where
[1:36:06] the problem is then he called up the
[1:36:09] whoever does switching
[1:36:11] power grids
[1:36:13] yeah you got to turn off this this power
[1:36:15] grid
[1:36:16] that'll affect 5 000 people he says i
[1:36:18] don't care shut it off no i can't fix it
[1:36:20] until you do
[1:36:22] so she's the lady or whatever through
[1:36:23] the sweat he went in there fixed the
[1:36:25] thing in 10 minutes later power was
[1:36:27] restored but here again he didn't be he
[1:36:30] had been working for there for
[1:36:31] 30 years probably by that point
[1:36:34] he did not rely upon his knowledge as an
[1:36:37] electrician
[1:36:38] he relied upon god to show him what was
[1:36:41] wrong amen amen but see too often in
[1:36:44] myself yeah i trust in myself i mean i
[1:36:48] you know i'm old enough to learn a few
[1:36:50] things in my life
[1:36:52] but i've come to the place to realize no
[1:36:54] it's not about me and what i can do
[1:36:57] you know it's about god and what he can
[1:36:58] do yes yes
[1:37:00] because we're coming to i believe in my
[1:37:02] opinion i believe we're coming to a time
[1:37:04] where we have to rely on god amen
[1:37:08] relying on yourself relying upon your
[1:37:10] job relying upon the government relying
[1:37:12] upon other sources won't work amen
[1:37:14] we have to come to the place where we
[1:37:16] have a relationship with god yes where
[1:37:19] we literally trust him
[1:37:21] for everything
[1:37:22] that's just how we're right there
[1:37:25] heavenly father we're our heads and we
[1:37:28] thank the lord you've given us this time
[1:37:29] together
[1:37:31] even though the words have been kind of
[1:37:32] choppy lord and maybe not make fully
[1:37:34] sense
[1:37:35] but lord you can put it together and
[1:37:37] help us to understand we have to come to
[1:37:39] a relationship with you that's second to
[1:37:41] none
[1:37:42] where lord you literally become supreme
[1:37:44] in our lives
[1:37:46] and we have total reliance upon you
[1:37:48] literally for everything that we do
[1:37:50] it's coming to that time i believe lord
[1:37:52] and soon
[1:37:54] the lord we're going to have to come to
[1:37:55] that relationship like that yes the
[1:37:57] sister had there
[1:37:59] in in in
[1:38:00] knoxville you know i think in nashville
[1:38:04] so lord help us today help us to grasp
[1:38:06] hold of what is what what faith is
[1:38:09] and help us realize faith is a
[1:38:10] relationship in you
[1:38:12] with you where literally we trust you
[1:38:14] for all things yes grant this lord for i
[1:38:17] ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen
[1:38:33] amen say amen to that amen praise the
[1:38:36] lord jesus
[1:38:37] so thankful the lord knows exactly what
[1:38:39] to put on a person's heart time that we
[1:38:40] need it the most yes amen i just read
[1:38:43] that scripture it's been on the rapture
[1:38:45] for about
[1:38:46] three or four months i don't remember
[1:38:48] how long and
[1:38:50] i read that scripture last week about
[1:38:52] saint luke 17 26 through 30
[1:38:56] where the
[1:38:58] the days of
[1:38:59] lot they builded and sold and planted
[1:39:02] and all that and i always baffled me
[1:39:05] because i thought well we we build we
[1:39:07] buy we sell we trade we live our lives
[1:39:10] but it doesn't mean that and dig into it
[1:39:12] a little deeper like brother noah was
[1:39:14] talking about with with habakkuk
[1:39:17] it means that they became self-reliant
[1:39:19] they became reliant on themselves they
[1:39:22] did everything themselves were like the
[1:39:23] rich young ruler right it was all him it
[1:39:25] was all them it was all what they could
[1:39:27] do and that's exactly the world that
[1:39:29] we're living in today it's exactly the
[1:39:30] country we're living in today they don't
[1:39:32] want god don't need god put god outside
[1:39:35] and the only thing they care about is
[1:39:37] they can do it and they're gonna do it
[1:39:38] they're gonna do it the way they want
[1:39:39] when they want how they want they don't
[1:39:41] care what you think about it anymore
[1:39:42] right as corrupt as it is
[1:39:45] they're in your face with it and they
[1:39:46] just don't care right but that's the
[1:39:48] world that we live in today amen it's
[1:39:51] all self-reliant but friend i want to
[1:39:52] tell you i am not in any way
[1:39:55] self-reliant
[1:39:57] my whole faith trust confidence is in
[1:39:59] the lord jesus christ
[1:40:01] that's all i have
[1:40:02] i've said this many times i've put all
[1:40:05] of my eggs in the proverbial basket and
[1:40:07] that basket is jesus christ
[1:40:10] uh if this turns out to be a failure
[1:40:12] which it's not of course uh i'm done
[1:40:15] because that's all i've got
[1:40:17] that's all i know amen amen you know you

[1:40:29] have some over here in this industry in
[1:40:31] that industry and this company and that
[1:40:33] company because if this one goes down
[1:40:35] they still got all this

[1:40:38] nothing i'm done because that's all i
[1:40:40] he's all i got
[1:40:42] amen
[1:40:43] the good part is he's all i want amen

[1:42:23] when he comes to speak for us
[1:42:26] i appreciate brother nolan and sister
[1:42:27] shirley's commitment to india
[1:42:29] and the and the missionary work they do
[1:42:31] over there and just pray the lord bless
[1:42:33] them as they continue that that's one
[1:42:36] big reason i enjoy having brother noel
[1:42:38] but it seems like every time brother
[1:42:40] knowles come and ministered for us ever
[1:42:42] since we've
[1:42:43] had the church open on cortero here
[1:42:46] he's always had
[1:42:48] the lord has always worked through him
[1:42:50] in the channels of things that we've
[1:42:51] already been talking about amen and it
[1:42:53] just
[1:42:55] it just always is such a confirmation to
[1:42:58] me
[1:42:59] that the holy spirit is moving in his
[1:43:01] bride
[1:43:02] and his people and he's doing it exactly
[1:43:05] the way he wants to do it
[1:43:07] and i i appreciate that so much brother
[1:43:09] noel of having you know it's something
[1:43:12] that
[1:43:13] preaching on a rapture like i said
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:18] you won't have rapturing faith unless
[1:43:20] you exercise what he preached today
[1:43:23] amen unless we live and practice what
[1:43:26] brother noel preached today from the
[1:43:28] scripture
[1:43:29] we will not go in a rapture
[1:43:31] amen there will be a rapture
[1:43:34] but if you're not practicing that you
[1:43:35] won't be in it but by the grace of god
[1:43:38] amen i believe that every one of us got
[1:43:40] to give us that capacity amen if again
[1:43:43] he could like he said if we just get
[1:43:45] ourselves out of the way
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:47] praise the lord
[1:43:49] and i
[1:43:50] i could be wrong but i think it was
[1:43:52] memphis
[1:43:53] that could be i could
[1:43:55] sister shirley's nodding so we're
[1:43:56] getting it wrong
[1:44:01] and
[1:44:02] i really like your secret on the giving
[1:44:04] part back and forth in the relationship
[1:44:06] i really like the secret on that one
[1:44:08] there i know sister shirley's got a
[1:44:10] great heart in my mind
[1:44:12] give a little more maybe than i have but
[1:44:15] i'm thankful that god's caused us to
[1:44:17] have that relationship with him
[1:44:20] because that's what it's all about
[1:44:22] amen it's not a relationship with a
[1:44:24] denomination it's not a relationship
[1:44:26] with brother branham it's a relationship
[1:44:28] with jesus christ
[1:44:30] amen it's not you brother branham and
[1:44:32] him it's you and him right amen nor was
[1:44:34] it brother branham you and him it was
[1:44:36] brother random and him it's you and him
[1:44:38] it's not you and him then something's

[1:46:12] lot we got one car that's a nice good
[1:46:15] car and the engine light stays off but
[1:46:17] we always have
[1:46:19] well we seem to have one that
[1:46:22] is on the other side of the fence there
[1:46:24] and uh then i always have to lay hands
[1:46:27] on that vehicle to get it through
[1:46:28] emissions i had to do the same thing
[1:46:30] yesterday uh the maxima we have is that
[1:46:33] the engine light's been on for two years
[1:46:36] and i knew what it was so it wasn't like
[1:46:38] well brother knew you're going up on the
[1:46:40] side of the road now i knew what the
[1:46:41] issue was so it wasn't something that
[1:46:42] was going to keep me on the side of the
[1:46:43] road but it was something that would
[1:46:45] keep you from going through emissions
[1:46:47] so i put some cataclean through it uh
[1:46:50] didn't turn the
[1:46:52] thing off but i reset the codes and i
[1:46:54] just laid hands on it and i said jesus

[1:47:21] what it was again it wasn't going to fix
[1:47:23] itself
[1:47:24] but i got the engine light off
[1:47:27] and i drove it and got it down there and
[1:47:29] the guy looked at the car
[1:47:31] because you have to you had to turn it
[1:47:33] off and you had to turn it on and prove
[1:47:34] so the light was still off
[1:47:36] when i got there and he looked at it and
[1:47:38] he said okay the engine light is off so
[1:47:41] he said now turn it off and make sure
