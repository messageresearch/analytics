[16:26] is from sister sheila
[16:27] and the bell stereo so they asked that
[16:30] we remember
[16:30] brother art and prayer he is having
[16:32] stomach cramps this morning so
[16:35] definitely ask the lord to touch them
[16:37] and also remember sister shelia in
[16:39] prayer she got very
[16:40] little sleep last night and is very
[16:42] tired so ask that the lord will give her
[16:44] strength
[16:45] and rest uh this one is from sister
[16:49] olivia please pray for my brother danny
[16:52] he remains in the hospital due to his
[16:54] setback and his recovery from a stroke
[16:57] also my nephew gabriel via needs a
[17:00] healing touch
[17:01] amen you may have to remember those this
[17:04] morning jesus
[17:05] this one's from uh brother patricia
[17:07] echol here
[17:10] our grandson is in the uh a gay marriage
[17:13] and i don't know how to tell him about
[17:14] what god thinks about his situation
[17:17] she asked that we pray that god would
[17:19] show her the way to approach him without
[17:21] offending him and cause him uh not to
[17:23] talk to her anymore
[17:25] she says that every time she approaches
[17:27] him about it he gets offended
[17:28] and says he prays to god and he and his
[17:31] partner both pray
[17:32] so definitely want to remember that
[17:34] situation as well
[17:35] amen amen uh let's just stand as we take
[17:38] these needs to lord and if you have
[17:39] unspoken prayer requests just

[17:52] i'm not sure if it's still from what
[17:54] happened friday yeah
[17:56] on the way home on friday she got
[17:59] really car sick uh and she uh we had to
[18:02] stop a few times but uh she was feeling
[18:04] better i think yesterday from what she
[18:06] told us but i guess today just came back
[18:08] so
[18:08] i'm still feeling better just you know
[18:11] getting in the car right now is not
[18:14] wisdom okay definitely ask that the lord
[18:17] touch her and
[18:18] completely hillary this morning i mean
[18:20] anyone else just
[18:21] quit mentions all right
[18:26] brother would you mind just praying all
[18:27] over the scenes this morning
[18:29] lord jesus we power our hearts and
[18:33] unison believing that we serve a living
[18:37] god
[18:38] god is mindful of all our needs we know
[18:41] father in these trying times it's
[18:44] obvious the enemy is fighting us harder
[18:47] than ever
[18:48] but when you say when he comes in like a
[18:50] flood you'll always
[18:51] raise that standard amen and father
[18:54] without you
[18:55] will surely fail without you we are
[18:58] nothing
[18:58] and lord give us the revelation the
[19:02] understanding
[19:03] that it has to be you in its entirety
[19:06] father get us out of the way that we may
[19:10] as paul says i die daily how much more
[19:13] does that reflect on us as believers
[19:16] father we must
[19:17] die to ourselves let you be able to
[19:20] express
[19:21] yourself fully in his father for we are
[19:24] needy people father
[19:26] we know that the battle is not ours the
[19:30] fight is not ours
[19:31] father it's yours greater he it's in us
[19:34] than he that's in the world
[19:36] and there's many that need a healing
[19:39] touch
[19:39] from you sister sonia and um
[19:43] uh sister lydia's brother and nephew
[19:46] and and all the other ones
[19:50] that are relying from from the great
[19:53] physician who come on the scene
[19:55] for thou art a high priest that can be
[19:58] touched
[19:59] by the feelings of our infirmities and
[20:02] with your stripes we are
[20:03] healed it's a finished work and calvary
[20:07] that you accomplished for us when he
[20:09] said
[20:10] it is finished that means it was paid
[20:13] fully
[20:13] that the bill has been paid in full
[20:16] and we believe father and the situation
[20:20] lord with our sister pat and and their
[20:24] nephew or where whatever the person is
[20:27] father it's a age where
[20:31] sin is taking prevalence it's sin
[20:34] is just trying to fit in as a norm
[20:38] but as believers give us the faith to
[20:41] stand on your word
[20:42] no matter what and this is a heart
[20:45] situation gift
[20:46] our sister and our brother wisdom to be
[20:49] able
[20:50] to share your truth and um knowing as
[20:53] brother braham
[20:54] said if the word offends then let the
[20:57] people
[20:58] be offended but father give them grace
[21:01] and wisdom how to approach this
[21:03] situation
[21:04] and lord i'm seeing it all in
[21:06] advertisements and commercials
[21:09] they're trying to put that homosexuality
[21:12] is
[21:12] normal it's not father we are believers
[21:16] let us
[21:18] stay with your word to the end father
[21:21] grant and lord grant each and every
[21:24] heart that raised their hand

[23:02] x-ray reading was all i had to go by
[23:04] not seeing doctor as of yet i looked on
[23:07] youtube for hip pain
[23:08] on there i found some stretching
[23:10] exercises for hip pain and after doing
[23:12] these stretches i now
[23:13] do not have the pain when i get up and
[23:15] walk uh get up and down
[23:17] and walk amen amen the lord works in our
[23:20] lives with many

[23:25] for god showing me the way to deal with
[23:26] my cane i appreciate your prayers and
[23:28] please know i pray for each of you
[23:30] and found these often taking time to
[23:32] pray for others is one way we love one
[23:34] another

[23:45] been helping derrick because he has so

[23:51] a home business
[23:52] and growing microgreens and trying to
[23:54] help him because he can't work he's
[23:55] meant he
[23:56] he's a he's been so whacked out by all
[23:59] the drugs since he's been taking since
[24:01] he was four
[24:02] that he has trouble focusing and things
[24:04] like that and he wants the work
[24:06] and he wants to be a part of the world

[24:32] i can do and um and and i got a call
[24:35] this morning it was eight o'clock i was

[37:32] forsakes us
[37:33] amen and i'm so thankful to be back here
[37:35] again today god bless you we certainly
[37:37] do
[37:37] miss you all so very much i appreciate
[37:39] brother roger and brother john taking
[37:42] uh the service for us last sunday and uh
[37:44] trust it was a blessing to you to help
[37:46] and
[37:47] of course brother dennis taking the bags
[37:48] and of course if you didn't come none of
[37:50] that would be
[37:51] needed so but i'm very so god bless you
[37:54] thank you amen for being here i had some
[37:57] requests and those that aren't here
[37:59] today so please continue to remember
[38:01] them in prayer
[38:02] um as you know my wife usually um
[38:06] when she travels has elevation changes
[38:09] and things she can get kind of
[38:11] ill and of course nobody knows that
[38:13] probably better than sister norma
[38:15] myself she experienced it firsthand one
[38:17] time
[38:18] but she she felt
[38:22] more normal yesterday and she was fine
[38:24] this morning
[38:25] she just her head was just so swimming
[38:27] to the point that she just didn't feel
[38:29] like she could get back in the car again
[38:31] so please continue to remember her in
[38:33] prayer i know the lord's already touched
[38:35] her
[38:36] and she's going to be fine we've been
[38:38] through this
[38:39] well ever since i've known her really
[38:42] so just appreciate your prayers she had
[38:45] this when she was a kid
[38:46] her parents were both teachers and they
[38:49] owned an rv
[38:50] so when school ended they all hopped in
[38:53] their rv and took off
[38:55] and that's all they did they were on the
[38:56] road all summer and
[38:58] she would get so sick and her mother
[39:01] thought she was just trying to get
[39:02] attention and
[39:03] stuff and tried
[39:07] offered no help no sympathy in fact just
[39:10] the opposite i'd
[39:11] tell you something that would gross you
[39:12] out but i'm not gonna do that but
[39:14] uh just she was just very uh obstinate
[39:19] and it was hard on sonia because she
[39:21] lived her whole life that way basically
[39:22] growing up so
[39:24] so i know what it's about and she's done
[39:27] better at trying to take care of it and
[39:29] and cut it off and not let it happen
[39:32] but you know just didn't realize the
[39:35] change in elevation
[39:36] stuff and the trip and the curvy roads
[39:38] going into san diego going out if you've
[39:40] ever been there
[39:41] you know when you get past el centro it
[39:43] goes up the hill and
[39:44] you know you get up to 4 200 feet
[39:47] so you know things like that it's just
[39:50] it's just
[39:51] uh it just affects her body her brain
[39:54] her head whatever
[39:55] in ways but she wanted to be here and
[39:58] told me to tell y'all hello and she
[40:00] loves you and
[40:02] hate that we weren't here today last
[40:04] sunday we spent the
[40:05] service with brother david zavala was
[40:07] real good we sang
[40:08] every week i forgot how it was when i've
[40:11] been there before
[40:12] several times but they sing every song
[40:14] twice
[40:15] uh at least twice because he sang every
[40:18] er
[40:18] every verse in in spanish and then every
[40:21] verse in english
[40:22] he sang it twice and then the uh
[40:26] the the chorus too so uh but it was
[40:29] it was a real blessing uh a brother
[40:31] that's there at his church
[40:33] ministered uh so it was good to see
[40:35] brother david and his wife again and
[40:38] those there like precious faith and
[40:41] had a good trip and appreciate each one
[40:43] of your prayers and thankful to be home
[40:45] amen enjoyed it and got a rest now from
[40:49] the vacation
[40:51] didn't even leave the apartment
[40:52] yesterday just trying to get some rest
[40:54] but
[40:55] um we're thankful that god blessed us
[40:57] and had a good trip and a safe trip and
[41:00] uh and glad to be back with you all so
[41:02] amen appreciate you love you
[41:04] last sunday i i left my suit my i left
[41:07] my suit hanging on my
[41:09] uh dresser usually i pack it in my bag
[41:11] so
[41:12] when i pack stuff it goes out of my mind
[41:15] and
[41:15] but i decided to just hang it in the van
[41:18] instead of packing it in my suitcase and
[41:20] i forgot all about it so last week out
[41:22] last week for the first time
[41:24] maybe ever i went to church with
[41:27] blue jeans and tennis shoes on but but
[41:31] i did i did hold true to a principle
[41:35] that i try to follow
[41:36] and that principle is i try to go to
[41:38] church wearing the best that i have
[41:40] that's exactly and i went to church last
[41:42] sunday with the best that i had at that
[41:45] time
[41:46] so i still held that principle even
[41:48] though i
[41:49] felt kind of like a bump no offense
[41:53] but that's you know some people it's
[41:54] just it's just different for me it just
[41:56] feels different for me that's awesome
[41:58] right i got up that morning and i took a
[42:00] shower and i looked in the mirror and i
[42:02] decided not to shave
[42:03] i started looking like dennis and danny
[42:05] over there i didn't shave again till
[42:07] this morning
[42:08] i had the first time i think ever in my
[42:10] life again this is a
[42:12] thing for first times i guess i hadn't
[42:14] shaved for two weeks
[42:16] um so it was very different very strange
[42:20] i looked very strange and was very happy
[42:22] no offense but i was very happy to get
[42:24] it off
[42:25] uh this morning so uh but again
[42:28] it's an honor to be here uh remember the
[42:31] request there's again
[42:33] those that are having some issues
[42:34] struggling and sickness and things but
[42:37] god is with us appreciate brother josh's
[42:38] family being here and
[42:40] sister kathy of course and i surely
[42:42] appreciate that testimony i was just
[42:43] wonderful because i've been
[42:45] around ducks and canadian geese and they
[42:47] don't come to you like that unless
[42:48] you're feeding them or something
[42:49] and then if you're feeding them and you
[42:51] quit feeding them they get aggressive
[42:53] uh so but they come that that was that
[42:55] was beautiful
[42:56] i i would agree with you i would just
[42:58] consider that to be the hand of the lord
[43:00] amen so i appreciate each one of you
[43:03] love you
[43:03] let's stand if we could now we're going
[43:06] to go to the scripture saint john

[44:33] saint john chapter 7. we'll uh read
[44:36] verse 17
[44:37] before we let you be seated but before
[44:39] we do that let's just fire our heads for
[44:41] another word of prayer
[44:42] lord jesus it's certainly a privilege
[44:45] lord to be
[44:46] to be here again today i'm so thankful
[44:48] lord to have
[44:49] been able to meet with friends and be
[44:50] together with those of like precious
[44:52] faith last sunday but
[44:54] god there's just absolutely no place
[44:56] like being home
[44:58] these people here and i listened to
[45:00] brother branham say that about his
[45:01] tabernacle and
[45:03] when he lived in arizona and he would go
[45:05] back and he could be with his family and
[45:06] with this
[45:07] home church like that again it meant so
[45:09] much to him lord he said there's just
[45:11] nothing like you people and god i feel
[45:13] that way here and feel that way about
[45:15] these people and
[45:16] being here today god is such an honor
[45:18] and a privilege and
[45:19] i'm so thankful that you give us the
[45:21] health and strength and life to
[45:23] be able to serve you again for one more
[45:25] day lord we not promise tomorrow lord
[45:28] but this one day you've given us just
[45:29] this one more
[45:30] we don't know how many more we'll have
[45:32] if any but we just serve you in this day
[45:35] that you've given us
[45:36] thank you for blessing us for watching
[45:38] over for keeping us
[45:40] thank you for your holy spirit lord to
[45:42] come and sweeping through this place god
[45:44] with a prayer requests the testimonies
[45:46] the prayers and
[45:47] lord we just know that you love us god
[45:49] and lord
[45:51] we know because you love us you love
[45:53] those who we love
[45:55] because you love us and those that we
[45:57] have prayer requests and
[45:59] our family and friends and people we
[46:01] know and
[46:02] request that we hold up before you lord
[46:04] we know you love them because you love
[46:06] us and we love them
[46:07] we thank you god for that precious love
[46:10] that you give us
[46:11] thank you for the ability to be able to
[46:13] stand here today and open up the pages
[46:15] of this beautiful word
[46:17] may pray pray god that you may reveal it
[46:19] to us once again today
[46:21] just a simple thought you give to me
[46:23] maybe from the sunday before last
[46:25] god to follow up with but god would just
[46:28] pray that you would just sink it into
[46:30] our hearts and
[46:31] help it become real to us lord and
[46:33] become a life lesson
[46:34] that you would show us through this yes
[46:36] we'll dedicate and commit the remainder
[46:38] of this service as we have thus far
[46:41] in your hands and pray once again that
[46:44] everything we do and say be pleasing to
[46:46] you
[46:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[46:48] pray amen amen
[46:51] saint john chapter 7 verse 17.
[46:56] saint john 7 17 if any man
[46:59] will do his will he shall know of the
[47:02] doctrine whether it be of god or whether
[47:04] i speak of myself
[47:06] you could be seated if you'd like the
[47:09] dividing line
[47:10] that jesus drew as the pharisees
[47:12] sadducees
[47:13] as they often did tried to tempt jesus
[47:16] right jesus drawing a dividing line with
[47:18] them to help them understand it
[47:20] to help them get to a place of uh of
[47:23] reasoning to
[47:24] to see who they are and where they stand
[47:26] and that dividing line
[47:28] here is although he's had many dividing
[47:30] lines of jesus put
[47:31] forth for them over the time that he was
[47:34] there
[47:35] this dividing line said if any man will
[47:37] do his will
[47:39] so what he's saying is if anyone will do
[47:42] the will of god
[47:44] okay so if anybody doing the will of god
[47:46] or
[47:47] has the will to do god's will you know
[47:50] sometimes
[47:51] we end up falling into god's permissive
[47:53] will because we actually don't go into
[47:55] his perfect will
[47:57] so we fall and i've told you how i feel
[47:59] about that and that's failure in my life
[48:01] if i'm in his permissive will but
[48:03] but the fact that i want to do
[48:06] my will and purpose in life is to do his
[48:09] will and he knows your heart
[48:11] and he knows whether you really want to
[48:13] do the will of god in your life
[48:15] or not he knows that and if he knows
[48:18] that and knows your heart that dividing
[48:19] line jesus is giving is
[48:21] if your will is to do the will of god if
[48:24] you will do the will of god
[48:26] then you will know whether it's his word
[48:29] or not
[48:29] right god will reveal it to you god will
[48:32] show it to you
[48:32] so that you know that it's him there
[48:35] won't be a question
[48:36] because people a lot of times will say
[48:38] well how do you know well they read the
[48:39] bible and
[48:40] this church reads the bible and they
[48:42] pray all the time and they have prayer
[48:43] meetings and
[48:45] different people they they have their
[48:46] ways of expressing their
[48:48] uh thoughts and ways and their desires
[48:50] to the lord jesus and
[48:52] and and with the bible or with their
[48:54] church or whatever it is
[48:56] but the bottom line of all of that is
[48:58] every denomination
[48:59] every religious belief every book that's
[49:02] out there about godliness or holiness or
[49:05] christianity or muslim or hindu whatever
[49:07] it is
[49:08] the bottom line of the whole thing is if
[49:10] we'll do the will of god we'll
[49:12] know what the truth is god will reveal
[49:15] to you what the truth is and that's what
[49:17] jesus
[49:17] is telling them if you have the will to
[49:19] do the will of god and you will do the
[49:21] will of god
[49:22] you will know of the doctrine you will
[49:25] know whether it's of god or not
[49:27] amen you'll know whether it's god or not
[49:29] or if it's just some man
[49:30] popping off or just somebody speaking on
[49:33] behalf of themselves or some other
[49:35] entity or some other deity
[49:37] you'll know whether it's of god or not
[49:39] and that's the point that jesus is
[49:40] trying to make
[49:42] do his will how do we know that we do
[49:44] the will of the lord
[49:45] be born again it comes down to having
[49:47] the holy ghost again
[49:48] you have the holy ghost your desire is
[49:50] to do the will of the lord god will
[49:52] reveal to you
[49:53] what his truth is what his word is see
[49:56] look there's so many different
[50:01] i guess i'll call them doctrines there's
[50:04] so many different beliefs there's so
[50:05] many different doctrines there's so many
[50:07] different
[50:08] offshoots even in this message i mean i
[50:11] wrote down a dozen or so
[50:13] without even hardly thinking about it
[50:15] right and some of them
[50:16] may be more than there were then
[50:20] we know brother green talked about the
[50:22] nine that he talked about brother bran i
[50:24] told him
[50:24] you'll find there's nine different
[50:26] interpretations of my message and
[50:28] brother greene seemed to find out that
[50:29] he thought that the ninth one was his
[50:31] own
[50:32] uh but they said your brother brown told
[50:34] him you'll find nine
[50:35] i counted about 12 or so without even
[50:38] thinking about it today now
[50:39] how many more maybe that i don't even
[50:42] know about
[50:43] i i don't travel in a lot of the
[50:46] well-known message circles so there may
[50:48] be some things that
[50:49] i don't even know about you hear about
[50:51] things
[50:52] but the bottom line of all that again if
[50:55] you desire
[50:55] and you do the will of god god will make
[50:57] sure and put you
[50:58] in the place where you the word of god
[51:01] is being ministered
[51:02] where the word of god is being brought
[51:04] forth yes it will
[51:06] alleviate and it will it will
[51:08] disseminate
[51:09] everything that god gives you in his
[51:11] word and
[51:12] show you what the truth really is and
[51:15] put you in a place
[51:16] where the ministering of the word is
[51:18] happening and the truth of the word is
[51:20] being preached amen
[51:22] and when he does that then you continue
[51:24] to do the will of the lord as he
[51:26] continues to feed you his word
[51:28] and that that relationship just
[51:30] continues to grow
[51:31] right that relationship gets stronger
[51:34] and stronger
[51:35] now the subject i want to talk about
[51:37] today is misunderstood
[51:40] now it had been on my heart for weeks
[51:44] and i almost wasn't going to do it today
[51:46] uh
[51:47] yesterday you know most of you know i
[51:50] spend most of my saturday trying to get
[51:52] spend more time with the lord for today
[51:55] and
[51:56] uh and as i was praying about it
[51:59] uh a different thought came to me but
[52:03] within the context of what i'm talking
[52:05] about today
[52:06] so i felt that was the confirmation of
[52:08] the lord for this
[52:10] and and also a follow-up kind of
[52:13] for two weeks ago our fifth anniversary
[52:16] we had
[52:17] the service that we had here when i
[52:18] talked about the body and the family of
[52:20] god
[52:21] and that and this goes right along with
[52:23] it the subject here is
[52:25] misunderstood or misunderstanding or
[52:27] someone that is misunderstood
[52:29] i like to give grace and i i just
[52:33] i i don't i've just always been that way
[52:36] my whole life i tried to anyway and i
[52:38] still try to
[52:39] as best as i can i know the dividing
[52:42] line that
[52:43] that jesus brought that brother branham
[52:45] brought what
[52:46] is the word and i still hold a hard and
[52:50] fast
[52:51] to the word period but that doesn't mean
[52:55] that i disfellowship or disassociate
[52:57] with somebody who disagrees with me or
[53:00] that i might disagree with
[53:01] right i'm not going to disassociate with
[53:03] that brother look
[53:05] if i do really believe that i'm right if
[53:07] i do really feel that he's wrong
[53:10] then it's my duty to try to fellowship
[53:12] that person and to help them
[53:14] not to counsel them not to degrade them
[53:17] or put them down or make them feel like
[53:19] they're less than i am
[53:20] but just be a brother right just show
[53:23] kindness just
[53:24] show love just be a a part of the body
[53:29] to bring it all together that that's how
[53:31] people are won
[53:32] people aren't one because it's you you
[53:35] feel like you're this
[53:36] outstanding orator or this this great
[53:39] doctor of divinity or something or you
[53:41] have
[53:41] everything figured out and all the
[53:43] scripture and the message right right
[53:45] it doesn't come like that it comes with
[53:47] love and compassion
[53:48] and showing somebody you really care
[53:51] amen you really do love them and you
[53:53] really do
[53:53] care and yes i do believe i wouldn't be
[53:57] up here as a hypocrite
[53:58] i really do believe that what i feel the
[54:01] lord has revealed to me in this word in
[54:02] this message
[54:03] is the truth i do believe that
[54:07] and i do believe that brother greene
[54:08] gave a balance to that message as well
[54:11] i absolutely do i believe that's why god
[54:14] put me there in that position
[54:15] because i wouldn't have stayed there if
[54:17] i hadn't been right
[54:19] but all that being said i like to show
[54:22] grace
[54:23] right and mercy even if i feel someone
[54:26] is
[54:26] grossly wrong now i might
[54:30] i might warn somebody if i know
[54:32] somebody's preaching an error and
[54:34] somebody asked me i said well
[54:36] you know you do what you feel led to do
[54:38] that's the first thing
[54:39] i would always tell you to do that's the
[54:41] first thing i'd always tell anybody to
[54:43] do
[54:43] you do what you feel led to do right i
[54:45] mean brother
[54:46] zavala he didn't this time but he's
[54:49] asked me in the past
[54:50] years ago when i've gone to visit
[54:52] whether he should leave san diego or not
[54:54] i said brother
[54:54] you've got to do what you feel like to
[54:56] do because people say oh you got to get
[54:58] out of california as quick as you can
[55:00] well maybe that's true
[55:01] but you better obey the lord first
[55:05] because if you obey the lord i don't
[55:07] care where you are
[55:08] god's going to take care of you that's
[55:10] right amen god's going to bless you
[55:12] and increase you and help you with
[55:14] wherever you are
[55:15] so first and foremost do what you feel
[55:18] led to do
[55:19] second though i would say you might want
[55:23] to watch
[55:24] some of the doctrine because
[55:27] you you want to make sure that people
[55:29] don't go off in
[55:30] error because they can't happen
[55:34] that's the protection that that the
[55:36] shepherd gives to the sheep right
[55:38] god's the same way that's why jesus was
[55:41] telling them
[55:42] if you do the will of god god will show
[55:44] you whether it's the truth or not
[55:46] i've been in meetings i i told you all
[55:48] the other day
[55:49] uh me and my wife we've you know since
[55:53] we've come to the lord and we're
[55:54] baptized filled with the holy ghost
[55:56] uh gone to church all the time
[55:59] uh there was times in our life in our
[56:02] young life and with our children that
[56:04] we were in church three or four or five
[56:06] times a week sometimes
[56:07] we would attend 20 20 church services in
[56:10] a month
[56:11] uh because in the south you know this
[56:14] they're having special meetings and
[56:15] they're having
[56:16] tip meetings and we'd drive to virginia
[56:18] then we'd drive to florida and then we'd
[56:19] drive
[56:19] here and we and we would go to meetings
[56:21] and go to happy valley and we
[56:23] were all over the place just to be in
[56:26] church
[56:26] we were there to go fellowship uh with
[56:29] those of like precious faith and be in
[56:31] church
[56:32] and that was our desire that's what we
[56:34] wanted to do and
[56:35] and that's how we lived our lives and
[56:37] that's how we raised our children
[56:39] and that's how uh uh that the lord
[56:43] blesses it
[56:44] see but i've been in many services
[56:47] where uh where there's
[56:50] things that were said and i don't
[56:54] forgive me because i'm trying to make
[56:55] sure i choose my words properly
[56:58] that i that i did not agree with that i
[57:02] personally didn't see in the message or
[57:03] in the word that i didn't see
[57:06] maybe this person had a further
[57:08] revelation something i don't know
[57:10] i would afford them that opportunity
[57:13] right
[57:14] because we're all brothers right and if
[57:17] i disagree doesn't matter
[57:18] maybe i'm the one that needs a little
[57:20] more light on that scripture or a little
[57:23] more light on that
[57:24] subject maybe i'm the one that needs
[57:26] that lord help me
[57:27] right reveal it to me let me know if i
[57:29] need to be where that is
[57:31] then that's fine but when when something
[57:33] is said
[57:35] and and you sat there and i would sit
[57:38] there
[57:38] and even my wife too a lot of times
[57:41] something would be said and me and my
[57:43] wife in unison would look at each other
[57:46] because he hit both of us at the same
[57:47] time the same way
[57:49] because that i always called it a bell
[57:52] brother brown
[57:53] brother green told me don't call it a
[57:54] bell that's god in your life amen
[57:56] i said i agree with that that's just how
[57:58] i denoted it
[58:00] something would go off the holy spirit
[58:03] what
[58:03] that that was in me would say there's no
[58:06] that's
[58:06] there's and
[58:10] people all around are up and screaming
[58:12] and yelling clapping and
[58:13] carrying on and uh can't hardly think
[58:17] nothing nothing wrong with uh
[58:20] exuberance and emotion and praising the
[58:23] lord and worshiping at the truth of the
[58:24] word and
[58:25] nothing wrong with that i encourage that
[58:27] 100 percent
[58:28] but what the variance there was that
[58:33] i'm me and my wife are sitting here
[58:35] looking at each other thinking
[58:37] that's not right that's not scriptural
[58:40] and people all around us are are
[58:43] worshiping about it and i and i'm
[58:46] thinking lord am i missing something
[58:48] is there something but the point of my
[58:51] subject or the point of my
[58:52] that that story is if we'll do the will
[58:56] of god
[58:56] god will show you you can even be
[58:58] setting in a place
[59:01] that something that is not true is
[59:03] spoken
[59:04] and god will speak to your heart and let
[59:07] you know
[59:08] that's not right amen that's the holy
[59:11] spirit in your life
[59:12] that's god speaking to you that's a
[59:15] fulfillment of jesus word
[59:17] that says you do the will of god in your
[59:19] life and
[59:20] god will let you know what his word is
[59:23] he will reveal to you that doctrine of
[59:26] his word
[59:27] that he wants you to know it's that
[59:30] simple
[59:31] amen so there will be no
[59:33] misunderstanding
[59:35] but there are plenty of them plenty of
[59:38] them friend
[59:39] and we'll go into a few of it a few of
[59:41] it today
[59:42] but i want to derive the topic for today
[59:45] from
[59:46] this next scripture in saint john
[59:48] chapter 21.
[59:54] saint john chapter 21 the very thing
[59:57] that i'm talking about
[59:59] is scriptural it happened in the bible
[1:00:04] saint john chapter 21 and how easy it is
[1:00:07] how easy it is to to to be misunderstood
[1:00:10] or to misunderstand
[1:00:12] amen it's very important
[1:00:17] that and i've i've done it
[1:00:20] many many times i'm sure but it's very
[1:00:23] important that we try to shoot choose
[1:00:26] our word
[1:00:27] speak properly speak as the lord would
[1:00:30] give it in
[1:00:31] in sentences now i found that
[1:00:36] it was a complication
[1:00:39] in life years ago
[1:00:42] but i've found it's become much more
[1:00:45] prevalent
[1:00:46] now that texting has become so prevalent
[1:00:50] because everybody when you're texting
[1:00:52] you you shut your
[1:00:53] text down to as short as you can a lot
[1:00:55] of times
[1:00:56] and you'll you'll leave out certain
[1:00:58] words because you know what you're
[1:01:00] talking about
[1:01:02] but the person you're texting may not
[1:01:04] get the context of your text
[1:01:07] because you're leaving those words out
[1:01:10] and i've had it happen to me so many
[1:01:12] times even between me and sonia
[1:01:15] she'll text back and say what are you
[1:01:17] talking about
[1:01:19] i said well this and this and this well
[1:01:22] why didn't you say that
[1:01:25] you know you leave a word out out here
[1:01:27] the word and misunderstandings happen
[1:01:30] because of that
[1:01:31] right now those are simple
[1:01:33] misunderstandings but
[1:01:34] when when those things hit a different
[1:01:37] level between
[1:01:38] two different other people or something
[1:01:39] as subject that's more important
[1:01:42] then it can become an issue
[1:01:45] that people become misunderstood so it's
[1:01:48] very important to make sure that
[1:01:49] that when we're trying to communicate
[1:01:51] that we can that we communicate
[1:01:53] properly and and in a way that it
[1:01:56] doesn't allow for misunderstanding
[1:01:58] remember the schism from last week
[1:02:01] or not last week before last the schism
[1:02:04] that we talked about that
[1:02:06] that shim the end of it is so
[1:02:09] tiny it doesn't take but just the
[1:02:11] slightest
[1:02:12] tiniest itty-bittiest little
[1:02:14] misunderstanding
[1:02:16] to start off a doctrine or to start off
[1:02:19] a disagreement
[1:02:20] or to start off a division that'll
[1:02:23] divide a church and divide people
[1:02:26] it doesn't take but just that little bit
[1:02:28] of misunderstanding
[1:02:29] somebody will come away from that and
[1:02:31] they won't say anything
[1:02:33] but they'll say you know what brother
[1:02:35] so-and-so said
[1:02:36] right well that might have been what
[1:02:38] brother bro
[1:02:39] so and so said maybe but it certainly
[1:02:42] wasn't the context of what they were
[1:02:44] saying
[1:02:45] the problem was they didn't say it with
[1:02:48] the full context
[1:02:50] to disallow this in any misunderstanding
[1:02:52] right
[1:02:53] and i hope i'm making myself understood
[1:02:56] you understand and that and that happens
[1:02:59] so much
[1:03:00] in texting but it happens in
[1:03:02] communication
[1:03:03] and it's it's a tool that the devil can
[1:03:06] use to drive a wedge
[1:03:07] right to to bring a disagreement or a
[1:03:11] misunderstanding
[1:03:12] when that wasn't the intention at all
[1:03:17] relationships uh friendships
[1:03:20] can be broken and divided for that very
[1:03:23] thing
[1:03:25] not only that but mis interpretations
[1:03:30] now you see where this comes along
[1:03:33] and how this happens because remember
[1:03:35] the three things brother branham said
[1:03:37] never to do with the word of god
[1:03:39] misplace misinterpret or dislocate
[1:03:43] right now there's a there's a thing that
[1:03:45] goes with each of those but that's not
[1:03:47] our subject for today
[1:03:48] but we're not to misinterpret misplace
[1:03:51] or dislocate the word in any way
[1:03:53] and see that's happens a lot of times
[1:03:56] people will misrepresent
[1:03:58] something and take it to another person
[1:04:02] and it may be about the word it may be
[1:04:04] about a church it may be about something
[1:04:06] else
[1:04:07] then a misunderstanding happens the
[1:04:10] person is misunderstood
[1:04:11] because of misrepresentation or it's
[1:04:15] misrepresented
[1:04:16] it wasn't said and how many times have
[1:04:19] you
[1:04:20] anybody ever said gone camping or set
[1:04:22] the gossip circle
[1:04:24] you got 15 20 people in a circle and you
[1:04:26] start out a subject and you just
[1:04:28] just a simple sentence uh
[1:04:31] joel likes to eat popcorn well by the
[1:04:34] time it goes all the way around here
[1:04:38] he his name's not even joel anymore it's
[1:04:41] somebody else so the king of the world
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:43] uh they've uh popped off at somebody
[1:04:46] else and it just
[1:04:47] you know you ever been in the gospel you
[1:04:49] just go from one to the next
[1:04:50] and and the initial story
[1:04:53] what isn't even close to what comes back
[1:04:56] around
[1:04:57] because each person it goes through
[1:05:00] misrepresents
[1:05:02] what actually was said oh well that
[1:05:05] sounded like what they said
[1:05:08] well then where do you go that's why we
[1:05:11] always
[1:05:12] try to make sure that our desire is to
[1:05:15] do the will of god
[1:05:17] because the will of god in our life will
[1:05:19] always bring us
[1:05:20] back around to the place that it's
[1:05:22] supposed to be and god will reveal to
[1:05:24] you the truth of what you're supposed to
[1:05:26] know
[1:05:27] and what your life is now no now notice
[1:05:31] there are things that others may know
[1:05:34] that you don't know
[1:05:36] or others may know that i don't know
[1:05:40] the lord reveals to us in different ways
[1:05:43] we're not cookie cutter christians
[1:05:45] we weren't put out on a conveyor belt
[1:05:48] with a stamp
[1:05:50] stamping each one of us out and we all
[1:05:52] came along
[1:05:53] and god said there's one there's one
[1:05:55] there's one and we walk around as robots
[1:05:59] we're not cookie cutter christians right
[1:06:01] we all had different lives we all had
[1:06:03] different upbringings
[1:06:04] and god reveals things to us brother
[1:06:07] branham said
[1:06:08] as we have need of knowing it
[1:06:12] so sometimes there's things you may not
[1:06:14] know that somebody else might know
[1:06:16] well don't discount that person and that
[1:06:19] person should not discount you
[1:06:21] right god hasn't revealed that to you
[1:06:25] yet
[1:06:25] right maybe it's just a simple
[1:06:28] misunderstanding
[1:06:30] just like this let's read this saint
[1:06:32] john chapter 21
[1:06:34] now again this is building on that body
[1:06:37] the body of christ to help
[1:06:39] to help understanding that we understand
[1:06:43] one another better
[1:06:44] amen the devil loves confrontation
[1:06:48] the devil loves confusion the devil
[1:06:51] loves it when he has each one of us
[1:06:53] fighting against each other he loves it
[1:06:56] yeah he does but that's not what we're
[1:06:58] supposed to do that's not what we as
[1:07:00] christians are supposed to do amen look
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:03] saint john 21 20 then peter turning
[1:07:06] about
[1:07:07] seeth the disciple whom jesus loves
[1:07:10] following
[1:07:11] which also leaned on his breasts at
[1:07:13] suffering said lord
[1:07:14] which is he that betrayeth thee peter
[1:07:18] seeing him
[1:07:19] say unto jesus lord and what shall
[1:07:22] this man do amen they already talked
[1:07:26] about
[1:07:26] judas's carrot he's already gone and
[1:07:28] done what he did
[1:07:29] but now peter sees this same disciple
[1:07:32] that was leaning on jesus breast
[1:07:33] following jesus and so peter goes to
[1:07:37] jesus and says
[1:07:38] lord what shall this man do the one
[1:07:41] that's following him what shall he do
[1:07:44] well first of all peter it's none of
[1:07:46] your business but this is what jesus
[1:07:49] said
[1:07:50] jesus sent unto him if i will
[1:07:54] that he tarried till i come what is that
[1:07:57] to thee
[1:07:58] follow thou me in other words that's a
[1:08:01] different way of saying peter
[1:08:03] it's none of your business you just
[1:08:06] follow me
[1:08:07] right you just keep your focus on me
[1:08:10] don't worry about what this man's doing
[1:08:12] don't worry about what this woman is
[1:08:14] doing don't worry about this person's
[1:08:16] walk with the lord of that person
[1:08:17] you just make sure your walk is right
[1:08:20] and that's the hardest thing that
[1:08:22] people seem to be able to do in this
[1:08:24] message they always want to fix somebody
[1:08:26] else right they always want to take
[1:08:28] control of somebody else's life
[1:08:30] their life is not your business
[1:08:33] their life is not your concern their
[1:08:36] life
[1:08:36] is not what god has put you in charge of
[1:08:39] right
[1:08:40] and that's what jesus is telling peter
[1:08:42] peter what is that to thee
[1:08:44] right amen what is it to thee if he
[1:08:46] tarry till i come
[1:08:48] and from that very same look what
[1:08:51] happened
[1:08:52] and then with this saying 23rd verse
[1:08:56] then with this saying abroad among the
[1:08:58] gen among the brethren
[1:08:59] that the disciples should not die
[1:09:03] yet jesus said not unto him he shall not
[1:09:06] die but if i will that he tear until i
[1:09:09] come
[1:09:10] what is that to thee so you see how it
[1:09:12] was misunderstood
[1:09:13] right you see how even what jesus said
[1:09:17] was misunderstood by the people
[1:09:19] listening to him
[1:09:20] and that statement went abroad
[1:09:24] it says that this disciple
[1:09:27] is not going to die
[1:09:30] but that is not what jesus said right
[1:09:33] that's not what jesus said what is it to
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:36] if he tarries till i come right
[1:09:40] all jesus is saying peter's done your
[1:09:42] business
[1:09:43] just tend to what you're supposed to be
[1:09:45] doing and that is following me amen
[1:09:48] amen the rest don't worry about it what
[1:09:52] is it to you
[1:09:52] so this but this saying went abroad the
[1:09:55] bible says
[1:09:57] that this disciple would not die could
[1:09:59] you imagine the churches ministering
[1:10:01] back then if that were to happen
[1:10:03] in a day like today oh brother so-and-so
[1:10:05] is not going to die
[1:10:06] did you hear brother so-and-so's dog of
[1:10:08] the night did you hear what jesus this
[1:10:10] this brother man said he's not going to
[1:10:12] die wow
[1:10:14] that's not what he said right and how
[1:10:16] many times do people
[1:10:18] see those things and read those things
[1:10:20] look
[1:10:21] the the we cannot figure it out with our
[1:10:26] natural minds
[1:10:28] brother adam said in the first seal you
[1:10:30] will never
[1:10:31] figure it out with your mind amen
[1:10:34] the the ministry is not is not to
[1:10:37] interpret the word but to rightly divide
[1:10:40] the word
[1:10:42] we as christians aren't to interpret the
[1:10:44] word
[1:10:45] we are to rightly divide the word
[1:10:47] there's a big difference
[1:10:49] yeah is to take the word and disseminate
[1:10:52] it
[1:10:53] properly according to the moving of the
[1:10:55] holy spirit
[1:10:56] yes by the will of god right
[1:11:00] so how easy is it then that things
[1:11:03] become misunderstood
[1:11:06] see a denomination starts
[1:11:09] a denomination starts when a man
[1:11:12] believes or a group of men
[1:11:14] believe that they can improve on what
[1:11:16] god has already done
[1:11:18] that's how you start a denomination they
[1:11:21] think they can
[1:11:22] improve on what god has already done
[1:11:24] what god has already brought
[1:11:26] we can make it better you can make it
[1:11:28] better than god
[1:11:29] you gotta you better stay in the channel
[1:11:31] that god's moving in
[1:11:32] or you're gonna get away from god and
[1:11:34] then you're out on your own yeah right
[1:11:36] amen you better stay in that channel
[1:11:38] friend you better stay on that channel
[1:11:40] brother or you're gonna get out from
[1:11:42] that channel if we're out in the channel
[1:11:43] the moving of god
[1:11:44] then you're in trouble there's a lot of
[1:11:47] voices in the land today friend
[1:11:49] but there's only one voice and that's
[1:11:51] the voice of jesus
[1:11:53] that is speaking through a many member
[1:11:55] body called the bride
[1:11:56] that is speaking to bring this bribe to
[1:11:59] a place of rapturing faith
[1:12:01] that we can leave this place that's the
[1:12:03] biggest and only doctrine i'm really
[1:12:05] concerned about amen
[1:12:07] amen i believe in the word i believe in
[1:12:10] the doctrine of the word
[1:12:11] the truth of the word and the revelation
[1:12:13] coming to us
[1:12:14] to bring us to that position because
[1:12:16] it's the word that changes us
[1:12:18] yeah it's not a gift it's not an
[1:12:20] interpretation it's not tongues and any
[1:12:21] of that
[1:12:22] is the word that brings you to a chain
[1:12:26] and if the word is not dressing you if
[1:12:28] the word is not changing you
[1:12:29] then something's wrong you're out of the
[1:12:31] channel of god amen
[1:12:33] people go home and i've heard it many
[1:12:35] times i've told you many of the meetings
[1:12:36] you've gone through
[1:12:37] man that wasn't that a great service man
[1:12:40] what he said was outstanding i said what
[1:12:42] was your favorite part
[1:12:44] well it was just all good i'm serious
[1:12:48] that that i'm not that's not something
[1:12:50] i'm giving off the cuff
[1:12:52] i've heard that yeah well what was your
[1:12:54] favorite part
[1:12:55] because i sat there and heard things i
[1:12:57] didn't agree with
[1:12:58] i said what did you like about it what
[1:13:00] did you hear him say
[1:13:02] what did you come out for well it was
[1:13:03] just all good
[1:13:06] that that was the common phrase oh it's
[1:13:08] just all good
[1:13:09] and i think these people are going home
[1:13:11] what are they going home with
[1:13:13] yeah what do they have that came across
[1:13:16] a pulpit of substance
[1:13:17] that they can apply to their lives that
[1:13:20] they can take home with them
[1:13:22] that they can live that they can let
[1:13:24] that word
[1:13:26] live through them through that next week
[1:13:27] or whatever
[1:13:29] what is it oh it was just good
[1:13:33] you can't tell me specifically what you
[1:13:36] really liked about the message
[1:13:38] amen coming down the road i asked my
[1:13:40] grandchildren what did you like
[1:13:42] the most about the trip they had
[1:13:45] specific answers
[1:13:46] right amen it's just that simple
[1:13:50] little children they have specific
[1:13:52] answers you go and ask a room full of
[1:13:54] adult what did you like oh it was just
[1:13:56] all good
[1:13:57] well we know that the whole trip was
[1:14:00] good we know that but what was your
[1:14:02] favorite part
[1:14:04] you know then that there's something
[1:14:06] askew there's something not the way it's
[1:14:08] supposed to be
[1:14:10] because that's not but that's but that's
[1:14:12] how people build their own kingdoms
[1:14:14] that's how denominations start amen
[1:14:18] misplace misrepresent dislocate the word
[1:14:21] amen and and it
[1:14:24] and it almost always brings a
[1:14:27] misunderstanding like this
[1:14:30] people misunderstand because of that and
[1:14:32] it gets
[1:14:33] broad it gets uh brought out all around
[1:14:36] the world broadcast everywhere
[1:14:39] brother so-and-so's not gonna die jesus
[1:14:42] said so
[1:14:43] that's not what he said look at some of
[1:14:46] these examples
[1:14:48] i got several i don't know if i'm gonna
[1:14:49] have time to read them all because you
[1:14:50] know me the time gets by so fast
[1:14:55] especially in the seals oh my around the
[1:14:57] seal time
[1:14:58] things that brother branham preached
[1:15:00] before and of course even in the seals
[1:15:02] and
[1:15:03] questions and answers on the seals i've
[1:15:05] got some here
[1:15:06] brother branham himself said in the
[1:15:07] field all it was was to reveal
[1:15:10] what had been what was now and what was
[1:15:11] coming right it was just
[1:15:13] opening up to those who could receive
[1:15:15] the revelation of it
[1:15:17] those who could receive the revelation
[1:15:19] of it would be revealed to them
[1:15:21] what it was what happened all the
[1:15:24] history of it bringing up
[1:15:26] into the day that we're living now even
[1:15:28] into the tribulation and
[1:15:30] into the new kingdom all of that it was
[1:15:34] all a part of it it was
[1:15:35] it was contained in those seals but look
[1:15:38] at
[1:15:39] the misunderstanding the
[1:15:40] misrepresentation
[1:15:42] now this is one of the most common ones
[1:15:44] and it is being propagated
[1:15:51] by people that should not be propagating
[1:15:53] is is being
[1:15:54] put forth by people it should not be
[1:15:58] put forth by i'll just put it that way
[1:16:00] i'm not calling names
[1:16:01] and then it's nobody in tucson or
[1:16:04] arizona
[1:16:04] but anyway so don't get that in your
[1:16:07] mind either
[1:16:09] i'll just say it's coming out of
[1:16:10] jeffersonville
[1:16:12] brother branham should evangelist
[1:16:14] continue on the field
[1:16:17] well there's a place in this country out
[1:16:20] of jeffersonville that says no
[1:16:23] no you should knock you shouldn't be any
[1:16:26] you should all be just listening to
[1:16:27] tapes
[1:16:28] that's all we should be doing listening
[1:16:30] to tapes well praise god
[1:16:31] you know what i do listen to him
[1:16:35] and i hope all of you do amen but when i
[1:16:37] go to church
[1:16:38] i want some live manna not that god
[1:16:41] can't bring what's on the tapes live to
[1:16:42] because he does
[1:16:44] but god put ministers in the pulpit
[1:16:47] to preach the gospel of the word amen it
[1:16:50] wasn't just on brother branham and
[1:16:51] brother branham let us know that
[1:16:53] hundreds of times right it wasn't just
[1:16:56] put on him
[1:16:57] amen but the question came forth in
[1:17:00] questions and answers on the seals
[1:17:02] should evangelists continue on the field
[1:17:05] in this
[1:17:05] hour of course he says what do they mean
[1:17:09] by that
[1:17:10] in other words brother brandon said what
[1:17:12] do you even mean by asking that question
[1:17:13] should people keep
[1:17:14] should the evangelists keep preaching
[1:17:17] why would you even ask that
[1:17:19] right what do they even mean certainly
[1:17:21] by all means
[1:17:22] don't change a thing yeah amen amen
[1:17:27] if jesus is coming in the morning preach
[1:17:30] today like it was going to be 10 years
[1:17:32] from today
[1:17:33] but live like it's going to be at this
[1:17:35] very hour
[1:17:37] don't get all scrupled up now that's why
[1:17:39] i'm trying to warn you about just don't
[1:17:41] be odd peculiar don't change
[1:17:43] nothing be if you're doing something
[1:17:46] wrong or evil now repent of that
[1:17:48] and get right with god but continue on
[1:17:51] with your evangelistic
[1:17:52] service just as you've always done amen
[1:17:56] well that's enough for me
[1:17:58] amen if the question came to me well
[1:18:00] brother do you believe you should
[1:18:02] just play tapes in your church service
[1:18:04] that's enough for me right there that
[1:18:06] answers my question
[1:18:07] amen if you're building a house
[1:18:12] put it up if jesus comes tomorrow
[1:18:15] you'd be found faithful at the duty
[1:18:18] listen this is
[1:18:19] i love this it's gold to me because
[1:18:21] people get so misunderstood about this
[1:18:24] you could ask group people christians
[1:18:26] what if you knew
[1:18:27] jesus was coming tomorrow what would you
[1:18:29] do oh i'd do this super spiritual thing
[1:18:31] and i'd
[1:18:32] climb to the mountains or whatever i'd
[1:18:34] do this that and the other
[1:18:35] then you're wrong yeah you're wrong
[1:18:39] oh i hit the streets i'd do this well if
[1:18:42] that's what god's called you to do why
[1:18:43] aren't you doing it now
[1:18:44] right if that's what god's called you to
[1:18:48] do you should be doing that every day
[1:18:50] not just because you know jesus is
[1:18:51] coming tomorrow
[1:18:53] i believe that's one reason he said no
[1:18:55] man i know the day or the hour right
[1:18:57] amen he just wants to find those that
[1:19:00] are faithful to their post
[1:19:02] what's the post that god gave you what's
[1:19:04] the purpose god established in your life
[1:19:07] that's all god's looking for being
[1:19:10] faithful
[1:19:10] to that post being faithful to that
[1:19:13] responsibility
[1:19:15] he said if you're building a house and i
[1:19:17] knew jesus was coming tomorrow
[1:19:18] i'd build it anyway amen amen
[1:19:22] you'd be found faithful at the duty if
[1:19:25] you're building your church
[1:19:26] go on and put it up i'd rather be
[1:19:29] putting my money in something like that
[1:19:30] to be found within my pocket
[1:19:34] keep on continue as you are he said
[1:19:37] everybody understand continue on just as
[1:19:39] you are
[1:19:40] just don't stop nothing just keep going
[1:19:42] serve the lord
[1:19:44] now for instance if i was working for a
[1:19:47] man
[1:19:47] and you noted it was 15 minutes till
[1:19:50] quitting time you'd say well
[1:19:51] it's just 15 more minutes i'll just go
[1:19:53] over here and sit down
[1:19:55] say he is going to dock you for that 15
[1:19:57] minutes
[1:19:58] because you didn't work you sit down
[1:20:00] doing nothing
[1:20:02] he said he's gonna dock you for that 15
[1:20:04] minutes
[1:20:05] so uh if you're uh planting wheat plant
[1:20:10] your wheat
[1:20:10] you're digging potatoes go on and dig
[1:20:12] them out say well nobody will eat them
[1:20:14] but don't make a difference
[1:20:17] it's just like peter what about this guy
[1:20:21] don't worry about that it's not your
[1:20:23] business
[1:20:25] well nobody will eat them doesn't matter
[1:20:28] you just be found faithful at your post
[1:20:31] you
[1:20:32] just be found faithful working at what
[1:20:34] god has put in your life to do
[1:20:36] amen amen don't make no difference dig
[1:20:40] them out anyhow just continue as you are
[1:20:42] i got a letter from somebody the other
[1:20:44] day somebody told them said well the
[1:20:46] time's at hand
[1:20:47] sell the farm now you don't need no food
[1:20:49] to live off the farm
[1:20:51] because the millennium is going to start
[1:20:53] you won't need it so
[1:20:54] just go ahead while the tribulation is
[1:20:56] going on your children not saved let the
[1:20:58] children have the farm
[1:21:00] uh where they can eat off of it uh
[1:21:04] i said oh my if i if i know these coming
[1:21:06] tomorrow
[1:21:07] i was a farmer i put my crop in today
[1:21:11] if he would if he made me a farmer i was
[1:21:13] going to stay right
[1:21:14] at that duty he said now he gives a
[1:21:16] little joke he said somebody told me the
[1:21:18] other day he said i just bought a new
[1:21:20] car
[1:21:20] and i get the second set of keys to the
[1:21:22] pastor and told the pastor the rapture
[1:21:24] is about to happen so if i go into
[1:21:26] rapture here's the other set of keys you
[1:21:28] can have my card
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:34] sorry but that he wouldn't be my pastor
[1:21:36] if i'll go that way
[1:21:39] but that's a little levity that brother
[1:21:41] brandon put in the story see
[1:21:43] um he said you say brother madam if he
[1:21:46] comes in the morning shouldn't you be
[1:21:48] out there
[1:21:48] no sir this is my post of duty i'll be
[1:21:51] standing
[1:21:52] right here preaching when he comes yeah
[1:21:54] saying the same things i
[1:21:56] am i'll just move on right out with them
[1:21:58] i hope if i'm holding potatoes i'll just
[1:22:00] keep holding
[1:22:01] amen look at this
[1:22:05] so you can see the misunderstanding
[1:22:08] people already thinking
[1:22:09] well should we quit evangelism no no no
[1:22:12] that that don't quit evangelism i'm so
[1:22:15] glad
[1:22:16] that we you know it was so it was so
[1:22:18] scrupled up before brother branham came
[1:22:21] and it's gotten so scrupled up again
[1:22:23] today yeah it's so many different
[1:22:25] doctrines that people just
[1:22:27] still believe brother adam was god
[1:22:31] two souls two gods uh christ came in 63
[1:22:35] there's no more kind of the tent vision
[1:22:38] people say they
[1:22:38] preach and know what the tent vision is
[1:22:40] and we know for a fact brother
[1:22:42] brother greene told us in august of 65
[1:22:45] brother branham still didn't even know
[1:22:46] what it meant
[1:22:47] right right three months before brother
[1:22:50] brown was taken off the scene
[1:22:51] he didn't know what it meant but every
[1:22:53] people i hear they seem to know
[1:22:57] where do you go with that you build
[1:22:59] another kingdom
[1:23:01] build another church build another
[1:23:02] masterpiece whatever whatever they've
[1:23:04] got just
[1:23:05] to to build something around a calling
[1:23:08] or or or uh some kind of a reputation
[1:23:12] see denomination that's all it is yes
[1:23:14] sir it's just people building
[1:23:16] denominations
[1:23:17] yeah you got no more blood on the mercy
[1:23:20] seat and
[1:23:21] and and i i just don't want to keep
[1:23:24] going
[1:23:25] it's just so many of them i got them all
[1:23:26] written down here i don't you know
[1:23:29] i could read them the ones that came to
[1:23:30] me off to you uh polygamy and uh
[1:23:35] joseph branham is god people have alters
[1:23:38] i've heard built in their brother
[1:23:40] brother green told me people have altars
[1:23:42] built in their homes to worship joseph
[1:23:43] brown
[1:23:45] just things that are just i i mean
[1:23:49] i know the the the text of this is
[1:23:51] misunderstood
[1:23:52] but that's gotten a bit beyond
[1:23:54] misunderstood i think it's sometimes
[1:23:56] right you start worshiping another man
[1:23:58] as god friend now you're
[1:23:59] you're treading on horrible you're
[1:24:01] you're treading on thin ice now
[1:24:03] jesus christ is god almighty and he is
[1:24:06] my savior and lord
[1:24:08] and that's it he used a man to bring a
[1:24:12] message
[1:24:12] to put that message on a tape so that i
[1:24:15] today could still listen
[1:24:17] and be fed by god amen from that word
[1:24:22] thank god it's on tape yes it is it's
[1:24:25] scrupled up bad enough the way it is
[1:24:26] could you imagine if the things he said
[1:24:28] wasn't on tape that we could listen to
[1:24:29] it for ourselves
[1:24:31] you imagine how scrupled up it really
[1:24:33] would be
[1:24:35] we got this to look at and say well
[1:24:37] people thought that you were supposed to
[1:24:38] quit preaching
[1:24:39] they still think that right brother
[1:24:41] branham's old son
[1:24:42] propagates that yeah it's not true
[1:24:47] misunderstood look at this another
[1:24:49] question is answers on the seals
[1:24:51] he said brother brown after you open the
[1:24:54] seals which brother adam did not open
[1:24:56] the seals
[1:24:58] jesus christ opened the seals right yes
[1:25:00] brother
[1:25:01] was just the man there at the time that
[1:25:02] god did it
[1:25:04] he says that himself you know that
[1:25:07] brother says i was just the one here
[1:25:09] when he decided to do it right
[1:25:11] yeah amen right i praise the lord i love
[1:25:14] it when it puts it in perspective right
[1:25:17] will this dispensation uh be of grace be
[1:25:21] over after you open the seals well
[1:25:24] brother brown says i hope not
[1:25:25] but he says no no friends don't you ever
[1:25:28] get that in your mind hallelujah don't
[1:25:31] ever get that in your mind
[1:25:32] and people have that in their minds
[1:25:35] today
[1:25:36] and you can listen on tape when brother
[1:25:38] random says don't
[1:25:39] ever think that i've heard ministers
[1:25:43] preach that the mercy of god was
[1:25:45] over yeah i've heard
[1:25:48] personally say that and i'm sure they
[1:25:51] probably do
[1:25:52] still say that brother brown says right
[1:25:55] here
[1:25:56] don't you ever do that right
[1:26:02] it just baffles me sometimes yes
[1:26:06] it's like and i hate to keep going back
[1:26:08] to this but it's like people sitting
[1:26:10] there in churches
[1:26:11] only playing tapes and if they would
[1:26:14] just play the right tape they could hear
[1:26:15] the man on the tape tell them to preach
[1:26:18] the gospel
[1:26:18] right am i right he'd tell him if you'd
[1:26:22] listen to the tapes
[1:26:23] that mechanical devices were not
[1:26:25] ordained to preach the gospel
[1:26:27] right yes men were ordained to preach
[1:26:30] the gospel amen
[1:26:35] again it's almost like a paradox
[1:26:39] it's we say we believe this but then you
[1:26:42] don't do what it says
[1:26:44] your actions are contrary to what he
[1:26:46] says right here
[1:26:48] people say oh i believe the message oh
[1:26:50] i'm deep into it i got these great
[1:26:52] revelations and you don't even obey this
[1:26:54] very statement right here
[1:26:55] right well brother brown says don't you
[1:26:58] ever think there's no mercy left
[1:27:00] now there will be a day when there's not
[1:27:03] right but the bride will be gone
[1:27:04] yes mine anyway that's what he says no
[1:27:08] no friends don't ever get that in your
[1:27:10] mind
[1:27:11] just go right on he says digging your
[1:27:13] potatoes again don't take that idea
[1:27:15] he said i ran across a man from north
[1:27:17] carolina here just the other day
[1:27:19] came up to me said glory to god can you
[1:27:21] tell me where some great somebody was
[1:27:23] i said no he said oh sir yes said this
[1:27:27] guy
[1:27:27] said it and it's the way today it maybe
[1:27:30] not in the message but charismatic
[1:27:32] realms
[1:27:33] uh they're always anyway uh
[1:27:36] let me just keep reading that he said no
[1:27:39] sir he said oh yes said this guy's got
[1:27:42] it
[1:27:42] he said he's this guy is the president
[1:27:44] of the auto mission
[1:27:47] what is the auto mission reven says
[1:27:50] the what the man says the auto mission
[1:27:54] brave man says i don't understand and he
[1:27:56] said all said
[1:27:57] this guy's the president i said what'd
[1:28:00] you say his name was he said
[1:28:02] branham i believe or something brown or
[1:28:04] branham he said well my name is brana
[1:28:06] he said are you the president of the
[1:28:07] auto mission he said no sir
[1:28:10] he said well where's the millennium at
[1:28:16] it's pardon me for laughing i shouldn't
[1:28:18] laugh because this is serious
[1:28:20] right but it really is the
[1:28:22] misunderstandings that people have
[1:28:23] sometimes
[1:28:24] we look at it and i've picked out some
[1:28:26] that probably seem a little
[1:28:28] silly to us but these people are sincere
[1:28:30] right
[1:28:31] they really believe this they really
[1:28:33] mean this they're sincere about this
[1:28:36] and he said well where's the millennium

[1:29:22] that
[1:29:23] yeah i don't know somebody must have
[1:29:25] said it
[1:29:26] but that wasn't brother branham's
[1:29:28] intention he said
[1:29:29] the brother graham says what she said

[1:29:42] if you you
[1:29:43] you want to see brother adam you got to
[1:29:45] wait at least a month
[1:29:48] but that's not brother branham's
[1:29:49] intention that wasn't what he meant
[1:29:51] probably wasn't what he said right but
[1:29:53] he gets broadcast
[1:29:55] all around right that this is the way
[1:29:58] it's gonna be
[1:30:00] well let me tell you friend god
[1:30:02] completely smashes and obliterates
[1:30:05] every one of our rules and traditions
[1:30:07] and regulations
[1:30:08] he does it the way he wants to whether
[1:30:10] we like it or not
[1:30:12] and he gets his point across in his time
[1:30:15] by his methods and i just want to be
[1:30:19] here as a mouthpiece to help be a part
[1:30:22] of it
[1:30:23] amen he said bring him on
[1:30:27] guy's standing in the lookout and says
[1:30:28] do you pray for the sick too he said yes
[1:30:30] sir
[1:30:31] he said what do you say your name was
[1:30:33] branham
[1:30:34] i said uh and you don't know nothing
[1:30:37] about the millennium
[1:30:38] well i now i don't understand it's just
[1:30:41] in the
[1:30:42] it's in the bible it says no it's
[1:30:45] it's right now people's come from
[1:30:47] everywhere i said where is it at
[1:30:50] he said jeffersonville indiana right
[1:30:51] under the bridge over here
[1:30:57] a bridge the underneath of a bridge in
[1:31:00] jeffersonville indiana
[1:31:02] is going to contain the millennium
[1:31:07] how many thousands tens of thousands
[1:31:08] hundreds of thousands millions of people
[1:31:10] are going to be in the millennium
[1:31:12] and yet it can be contained under pc
[1:31:16] you see how even the common natural mind
[1:31:20] and people can get caught up in so much
[1:31:22] of this stuff that it overtakes them
[1:31:25] it overcomes them yes amen and become
[1:31:28] very
[1:31:29] gullible about those things under a
[1:31:31] bridge in jeffersonville
[1:31:34] how could the millennium even be
[1:31:36] contained actually
[1:31:37] if you're under a bridge in indiana
[1:31:40] jeffersonville
[1:31:41] you're in the middle of the river
[1:31:46] and a millennium is going to take place
[1:31:48] under the bridge
[1:31:50] you've got the ends of the bridge where
[1:31:51] there's a little bit of land but that's
[1:31:53] it
[1:31:54] but this brother literally i mean he was
[1:31:56] excited the way brother branham tells
[1:31:58] the story
[1:31:59] he's oh he quit his job he
[1:32:02] quit his job and drove to indiana from
[1:32:04] north carolina so fast
[1:32:05] he didn't even change his work clothes
[1:32:07] wow
[1:32:09] met brother branham and said where is
[1:32:11] this irons in jeffersonville under a
[1:32:13] bridge
[1:32:14] i don't know brother i'm sorry
[1:32:18] but you see how people can be
[1:32:19] misunderstood right
[1:32:21] even from things that brother brown said
[1:32:24] so many times
[1:32:25] brother brown will make it so clear of
[1:32:27] things that he said
[1:32:29] i think a lot of times a lot of these
[1:32:30] things they either come from people who
[1:32:32] just want to be deceptive
[1:32:34] to build their own denomination or
[1:32:35] kingdom or they come from what they
[1:32:38] heard years ago without going back and
[1:32:40] bringing it to the
[1:32:41] to the tapes into the word and figuring
[1:32:43] out that that that's what
[1:32:45] to me that's what happened to the sunset
[1:32:48] mountain
[1:32:49] all the misunderstandings surrounding
[1:32:51] sunset now all the hundreds thousands
[1:32:52] whatever people
[1:32:53] has left a message because of the
[1:32:55] misunderstanding of the cloud and sunset
[1:32:57] mountains
[1:32:58] they just don't understand the facts if
[1:33:00] you take what he said on tape
[1:33:02] and you bring it out to understand what
[1:33:04] the truth of it is
[1:33:05] it's very simple it's not complicated
[1:33:09] yeah it really is and i don't have time
[1:33:12] to go into it today but if you have any
[1:33:13] question on that
[1:33:14] you can ask me his people there's people
[1:33:17] today
[1:33:17] still leaving this message because they
[1:33:19] think that cloud was created by rocket
[1:33:22] vandenberg air force base right and dr
[1:33:24] mcdonald the guy that brother greene
[1:33:26] personally talked to said that is
[1:33:28] impossible that that could have happened
[1:33:30] yeah
[1:33:31] he an atheist scientifically
[1:33:35] that that cloud could not have come from
[1:33:37] a rocket but yet people lead by the
[1:33:39] hunters from this message today because
[1:33:40] they think it was created
[1:33:42] right brother branham lied about it
[1:33:45] it's true he said brother there's
[1:33:48] another brother grandma i have some
[1:33:50] questions i'm gonna close here
[1:33:51] my i i've got two or three more i i
[1:33:54] better close
[1:33:58] i've heard people say now this is just
[1:34:00] questions and answers in 1964. i've
[1:34:03] heard people say
[1:34:04] that you have advised people well first
[1:34:07] of all the worst part of this statement
[1:34:08] is i have heard
[1:34:10] yes right right i've heard all kinds of
[1:34:13] things written but most of it's not true
[1:34:15] yeah in all facets of life work
[1:34:18] business home church i've heard all
[1:34:21] kinds of things
[1:34:22] i've heard people tell me all kinds of
[1:34:23] stuff a lot of us never even come
[1:34:26] to place uh to pass or never was even
[1:34:28] true
[1:34:29] right so the first part about it
[1:34:32] i have heard that's that's a tough one
[1:34:38] i have heard people say that you have
[1:34:41] advised them to sell all their homes
[1:34:44] and to follow you to arizona or they
[1:34:47] would not be in the rapture
[1:34:50] amen is this true amen he said
[1:34:53] that's a lie yeah
[1:34:57] or should we sell our houses or did you
[1:34:59] even say this
[1:35:00] no sir i did not say it if
[1:35:03] anything i've advised people not to do
[1:35:07] it
[1:35:08] he talked about the dream that junior
[1:35:10] jackson had
[1:35:11] where he had the mountain and and
[1:35:13] brother branham
[1:35:14] uh expressed everything that was on his
[1:35:16] heart to him and he cut the top of that
[1:35:18] mountain off took a crowbar looking
[1:35:20] thing
[1:35:20] and pried the top off the mountain and
[1:35:22] looked down in it was just white rock
[1:35:24] nothing written on him just white rock
[1:35:26] just pure white
[1:35:28] and brother and said you oh look on this
[1:35:31] while i go out and yonder
[1:35:33] and yet they all followed him well i
[1:35:35] shouldn't say all
[1:35:36] but many followed him but the vision
[1:35:39] that he interpreted
[1:35:40] said stay here and look on this well i i
[1:35:44] don't mean to interpret a dream brother
[1:35:45] brown
[1:35:46] didn't but i think it was the word
[1:35:48] purity of the word the message
[1:35:50] if you take it with the understanding
[1:35:52] that that god told him to store up the
[1:35:54] food
[1:35:55] at that place that that food would be
[1:35:58] stored up for the spiritual welfare of
[1:36:00] the coming generations
[1:36:03] then you'd understand that this this
[1:36:06] mountain would contain what what the
[1:36:09] truth was
[1:36:11] the revelation of the message the word
[1:36:13] for people to look on
[1:36:15] to listen to for god to reveal it to
[1:36:18] amen he said
[1:36:22] anything i've told people not to listen
[1:36:24] this now
[1:36:25] some understood you to say in your
[1:36:27] message future home of the bride and
[1:36:29] bridegroom
[1:36:30] and after have you heard that i've heard
[1:36:32] that i've heard that tape several times
[1:36:34] yes it's about four hours long but it's
[1:36:38] outstanding
[1:36:39] he said some saying the message that you
[1:36:41] said in the message future home of the
[1:36:43] bride
[1:36:44] bridegroom earthly bride
[1:36:48] there was to be 1500 miles from the
[1:36:50] tabernacle square
[1:36:52] 700 miles each way in other words the
[1:36:55] tabernacle sitting right in the middle
[1:36:58] would be 700 miles each way 1500 miles
[1:37:01] around is this true
[1:37:02] because i live outside of this area and
[1:37:05] should i
[1:37:06] move into that area
[1:37:09] misunderstanding no honey you don't
[1:37:13] he said you don't understand and if
[1:37:15] you've heard if you've heard of the tape
[1:37:16] that's not what brother brown is saying
[1:37:18] in fact brother later in the message
[1:37:20] goes on to say he believes it's going to
[1:37:22] be set over in palestine
[1:37:23] where abraham had had communion with
[1:37:26] melchizedek
[1:37:28] he said he believes that's going to be
[1:37:29] the con for lack of better phraseology
[1:37:31] the epicenter
[1:37:32] of where the mountain pyramid shaped
[1:37:34] mountain is going to press up out of the
[1:37:36] earth
[1:37:36] and the city's going to come down on
[1:37:38] it's over there
[1:37:39] not here he was just giving dimensions
[1:37:42] so that people could get
[1:37:44] and see how confusing how it's easily
[1:37:46] misunderstood
[1:37:48] he was simply giving dimensions so that
[1:37:50] people could visualize
[1:37:52] how big it was from maine to florida
[1:37:55] from the east coast to 700 miles i think
[1:37:58] it was west of mississippi
[1:37:59] something like that and he was just
[1:38:01] giving that as
[1:38:03] a dimensional view that people could
[1:38:05] mentally picture
[1:38:06] how big it's going to be or the bottom
[1:38:08] of it that's all he was doing
[1:38:10] but you see how misunderstandings come
[1:38:14] amen brother brown you have made
[1:38:18] statements recently concerning the
[1:38:20] church age has ended laodicea he said no
[1:38:22] i never said it's hindu amen
[1:38:26] he said did if if i did you
[1:38:29] misunderstood or i
[1:38:31] said it wrong this is the last church
[1:38:34] age
[1:38:35] is the end of the church ages of
[1:38:37] laodicea but laodicea has not ended
[1:38:41] in fact he says in several places at
[1:38:43] least
[1:38:44] a couple i know that that this layout to
[1:38:47] see an age will go into perdition
[1:38:49] yeah in fact even after the bride is
[1:38:51] gone it will still be a continuation
[1:38:54] of laodicea church yeah amen
[1:38:59] another one the church age ending and
[1:39:02] has blacked out
[1:39:03] the bride is called we have already
[1:39:06] entered into the tribulation period
[1:39:08] no no no
[1:39:12] and i've met people that believe that no
[1:39:14] no no
[1:39:15] i wish that i could have more time on
[1:39:18] that he says
[1:39:19] but people still believe it but you see
[1:39:22] how easily those things can be
[1:39:24] misunderstood
[1:39:26] in in saint john chapter four
[1:39:29] jesus has all these disciples all these
[1:39:32] men following him they saw the loaves
[1:39:34] and the fishes and
[1:39:35] and they went across the sea and they
[1:39:36] followed jesus right
[1:39:39] and they came up to jesus and he tried
[1:39:41] to explain to them
[1:39:43] who it was that he came for and the
[1:39:45] truth of the word
[1:39:47] and and and and and what god was doing
[1:39:50] for that day
[1:39:52] and and they they always reverted back
[1:39:55] to
[1:39:56] tradition and finally jesus just said
[1:40:01] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:40:03] blood you have no life in me you have no
[1:40:05] life in you
[1:40:06] you have no part with me
[1:40:10] i mean and that's just a very
[1:40:13] descriptive
[1:40:14] hard saying and they said this is a hard
[1:40:17] thing who can take it
[1:40:18] and they left from him right because
[1:40:21] they had no revelation
[1:40:22] they had no understanding they followed
[1:40:25] him around
[1:40:26] but their desire in their heart was not
[1:40:28] the will of god
[1:40:30] right if it was god would have made
[1:40:33] known to them
[1:40:34] the truth of the world yes because he
[1:40:36] went to the others
[1:40:37] and said are you going to go also and
[1:40:40] they said where are we going to go
[1:40:42] you have the words of eternal life right
[1:40:45] that ended that what was that there was
[1:40:48] something different in them
[1:40:50] to want to continue on right and one of
[1:40:52] them was a devil
[1:40:57] amen amen it's the truth judas
[1:41:01] ended up selling selling jesus out right
[1:41:04] for the truth
[1:41:11] amen keep our balance
[1:41:14] keep your balance in the scripture
[1:41:18] loving your heart keep grace for one
[1:41:21] another
[1:41:23] so easy to try to put somebody out just
[1:41:25] because they disagree with us
[1:41:27] just because they disagree with you
[1:41:28] disagree with me discount them as a
[1:41:30] brother or sister we talked about this a
[1:41:32] little bit a couple of weeks ago
[1:41:34] discount as a brother or sister it seems
[1:41:36] so ironic that we try so hard to get
[1:41:38] people into the fold and into christ and
[1:41:40] into the truth
[1:41:41] when the truth of it is a lot of times
[1:41:43] people just want to get them in their
[1:41:44] church
[1:41:45] right because if you're not in if
[1:41:48] they're not in your
[1:41:49] church then they're not going right
[1:41:51] they're not worthy they're not my friend
[1:41:53] they're not my brother
[1:41:55] instead of thinking of getting them to
[1:41:57] jesus
[1:41:58] the thing is to give them to christ if
[1:42:00] you really desire to get them to christ
[1:42:02] that's all that matters
[1:42:04] amen and look if their doctrine is a
[1:42:06] little skewed friend
[1:42:07] if they are a child of god god will take
[1:42:09] care of that
[1:42:11] that's why jesus told peter what is that
[1:42:13] to you right
[1:42:14] amen love that person show them some
[1:42:17] mercy
[1:42:18] show them some grace expect
[1:42:22] even if they don't extend it to you
[1:42:24] right even if they don't extend that
[1:42:26] same mercy and grace
[1:42:28] that's not your responsibility right
[1:42:31] your responsibility is not what they do
[1:42:33] your responsibility is what you do
[1:42:36] what i do that's my responsibility if
[1:42:39] it's not reciprocated
[1:42:41] that's not my fault but that doesn't
[1:42:43] change who i am
[1:42:44] amen that doesn't change what i do or
[1:42:46] how i treat them
[1:42:48] you understand that body
[1:42:52] to try to be a help and a blessing
[1:42:54] that's what jesus did
[1:42:56] the only time jesus got angry in that
[1:42:58] context
[1:42:59] is when they were defiling the holy
[1:43:01] place right
[1:43:02] when they were defiling the temple he he
[1:43:06] ran he beat him out
[1:43:07] and that in that case amen and you say
[1:43:10] well they
[1:43:11] that probably offended them well you
[1:43:12] know and in that case they probably
[1:43:14] needed to be offended yes sir
[1:43:17] sometimes maybe that rattled their cage
[1:43:19] enough to come back to see the truth
[1:43:20] don't know right but the truth but
[1:43:24] but our position our responsibility
[1:43:28] is to be led of the spirit
[1:43:31] and as god leads you he will make known
[1:43:34] to you what the truth is what his word
[1:43:36] is
[1:43:36] and the truth of his word amen praise
[1:43:40] the lord
[1:43:40] i'm thankful i've known people i know
[1:43:43] one particular brother i'm closing here
[1:43:45] i know one particular brother and i
[1:43:47] still call him brother
[1:43:49] who left a certain doctor and he came
[1:43:52] and seemed like he was real centered
[1:43:54] he's really dug into the mess the truth
[1:43:58] and the word and and now i've heard he's
[1:44:01] just left the message all together
[1:44:04] just gone back into the nomination world
[1:44:05] i still he's still my brother
[1:44:08] but uh and this is on the east coast
[1:44:13] but it i thought it was
[1:44:17] important that i meet that brother at
[1:44:19] the time that i met it i don't i didn't
[1:44:20] know that at the time i know it now
[1:44:22] this is how i feel about it to
[1:44:24] understand
[1:44:26] the complexities of of all those things
[1:44:29] that come into a person's life
[1:44:32] and what they believe and what they
[1:44:33] don't believe and what they accept and
[1:44:35] don't accept and what they hear
[1:44:37] and what they the things that they hear
[1:44:39] that they accept and
[1:44:41] you know there's a lot of voices out
[1:44:43] there friend you can't believe
[1:44:44] everything you hear
[1:44:45] amen but i tell you what i know one
[1:44:48] thing
[1:44:49] god vindicated sent and vindicated
[1:44:53] a word prophet for this last day
[1:44:57] to bring a message to clothe a bride to
[1:44:59] get her
[1:45:00] ready for rapture amen that i do know
[1:45:03] yes
[1:45:03] amen yes and that word which is christ
[1:45:07] i stand behind and with 100 amen
[1:45:10] amen praise the lord let's stand if we
[1:45:14] could
[1:45:22] some of these misunderstandings may have
[1:45:24] sound silly
[1:45:26] they may have sound like how could a
[1:45:27] person ever get caught up in something
[1:45:29] like that
