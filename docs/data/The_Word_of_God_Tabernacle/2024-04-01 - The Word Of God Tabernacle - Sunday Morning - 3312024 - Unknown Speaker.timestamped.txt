[30:07] verse1 the end of the Sabbath as it
[30:10] began to draw toward the first day of
[30:12] the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[30:14] other Mary to see the supper behold
[30:16] there was a great earthquake for the
[30:18] angel of the Lord descended from heaven
[30:20] and came and rolled back the Stone from
[30:21] the door and sat upon it his countenance
[30:24] was like lightning and his rainment
[30:26] white as snow and for for fear of him
[30:29] the keepers did shake and become as dead
[30:31] men the angel answered and said unto the
[30:33] women fear not ye for I know uh that you
[30:37] seek Jesus who was crucified he is not
[30:40] here for He Is Risen amen as he said
[30:44] come see the place where the Lord lay go
[30:47] quickly and tell his disciples that he
[30:48] is risen from the dead and behold he
[30:51] goeth before you into Galilee there
[30:53] shall ye see him lo I have told you they
[30:56] departed quickly from the SE ER with
[30:58] fear and great joy and did run to bring
[31:01] his disciples word and as they went to
[31:03] tell his disciples behold Jesus met them
[31:06] saying all hell and they came and held
[31:09] him by his feet by the feet and
[31:12] worshiped him then said Jesus unto them
[31:15] Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that
[31:18] they go uh that they go into Galilee and
[31:20] there shall they see me amen you could
[31:23] be seated if you'd
[31:25] like
[31:26] amen
[31:29] Easter I have an Easter message here of
[31:32] course obviously honoring the
[31:34] resurrection of the Lord Jesus I just
[31:36] want to take a simple topic something
[31:37] that was on my heart uh a little bit
[31:40] this week was about the about the
[31:42] quickening power and um I got in here
[31:46] yesterday and started looking a little
[31:48] deeper and uh and this thought came on
[31:50] my heart the angel of the Lord these
[31:53] women came to the SRE to try to dress
[31:56] Jesus body and to honor his uh his life
[32:00] by his burial uh and not knowing
[32:03] obviously that he was going to raise
[32:05] although uh he was rebuked by Jesus and
[32:07] the angel to say look he told you this
[32:10] was going to happen amen Jesus even told
[32:13] them later ye of uh actually we'll
[32:16] probably read that uh ye of ye are slow
[32:18] of heart ye fools and slow of heart to
[32:21] believe the word all the word says that
[32:23] this is going to happen I told you that
[32:25] when this happened that I would raise
[32:26] again uh so when it comes to pass
[32:30] sometimes when things happen that we
[32:32] that we ask the Lord about we trust the
[32:35] Lord is going to do what he said he
[32:36] would do a lot of sometimes when it
[32:38] happens it's so miraculous that we we
[32:41] we're we're
[32:42] dumbfounded how did this happen well he
[32:44] told you it was going to happen how did
[32:46] this happen well you asked for it you
[32:48] asked the Lord to do something and the
[32:50] Lord did it amen so why would that be so
[32:54] uh uh so unusual for us when we expect
[32:57] it to happen we believe the Lord is
[32:58] going to do what he said he would do but
[33:00] the angel answered now this is the point
[33:01] I want to get into the sixth
[33:03] verse the sixth verse says the angel
[33:06] told them they came down from heaven
[33:08] remember this great earthquake took
[33:10] place sounds kind of familiar doesn't it
[33:12] yes amen earthquake takes place and an
[33:14] angel's there with a message amen how
[33:17] how how familiar we as message Believers
[33:19] know that yes amen an earthquake takes
[33:21] place and the prophets there to and
[33:23] Angels there to tell us uh the the give
[33:25] us the message sixth verse now though he
[33:28] said he is not here for He Is Risen as
[33:32] he said amen he is risen now I want to
[33:35] turn to a different uh Proclamation here
[33:38] today uh it's nothing that's unusual but
[33:41] it's an Easter message just something to
[33:43] uh help us with today's Journey that we
[33:46] live in but the proclamation here was
[33:49] that he is risen amen that's what the
[33:52] angel of the Lord told them he is risen
[33:54] and that is a wonderful Proclamation and
[33:57] uh and you see all over the place or
[33:58] some places used to be all over the
[34:00] place not so much anymore but used to
[34:02] see uh decorations and things around he
[34:05] is risen and that and that became the
[34:08] the the cry that we have that that angel
[34:11] gave them that he is risen but I want us
[34:13] to understand and the proclamation that
[34:15] I want to make today is not just he is
[34:17] risen but he is here yes amen he's here
[34:21] not just risen which is important
[34:23] because he couldn't be here if he had
[34:25] not Rose but he is here here amen that's
[34:29] the main thing that we want to know to
[34:31] understand is that he is here to make
[34:33] every one of those promises that he gave
[34:36] us all through the scripture all the
[34:38] foretelling in the Old Testament New
[34:40] Testament things that Jesus said the
[34:42] things that Jesus told them there that
[34:44] we have recorded everyone came to pass
[34:47] understand that he now is here amen he's
[34:50] here to make every one of those promises
[34:53] come to pass yes it's amazing that
[34:55] someone usually when someone one writes
[34:58] a a uh a last willing Testament the that
[35:02] Testament doesn't come into effect until
[35:05] after the person's dead that's the same
[35:07] uh all around that The Testament doesn't
[35:10] come into effect until that person's
[35:11] dead but Jesus is the only one who
[35:14] brought the testimony he wrote The
[35:17] Testament and he died to bring It full
[35:20] effect but he rose again to make sure
[35:22] that every object every item that's on
[35:26] that last will and Tes gets fulfilled
[35:28] amen amen he is usually we have to go to
[35:33] a judge or an Arbiter or uh an executive
[35:36] of a will or something like that to find
[35:38] out who got what uh how much money did I
[35:41] get did I get the house on the beach did
[35:42] I get this fancy car whatever it is they
[35:45] want to go and a lot of times they fight
[35:46] over that but Jesus is the only one that
[35:49] rose again from the dead to make every
[35:52] one of the things that's in his will
[35:54] come to pass you know why cuz he's the
[35:56] only one that could do it it amen I
[35:59] couldn't make all the promises that
[36:00] Jesus put in here come to pass right
[36:03] amen if he had died and stayed in the
[36:04] grave never not not one of them would
[36:07] have come to pass but because he rose
[36:09] again he can make every single one of
[36:11] the items on his will come to pass yes
[36:14] amen what he gave you he could only do
[36:17] because he came back again what he
[36:19] promised us he can only do because he
[36:21] came back again these promises he can
[36:25] only fulfill in our lives now because
[36:27] he's here now yes praise the lord it's
[36:29] the only way it could happen St John
[36:32] Chapter 2 let's go over to St John
[36:34] Chapter 2 now I won't be too long today
[36:38] amen a lot of times we have big plans on
[36:41] Easter Sunday I got to catch ples so
[36:44] that's not the reason I'm shortening
[36:46] this as you all have found out in the
[36:47] past but uh my flight leaves today at
[36:50] 154 so uh there will be no Easter of
[36:54] that uh happening for me but uh
[36:58] maybe I'll go to Cracker Barrel when we
[36:59] get to
[37:00] [Music]
[37:02] California they don't have grumpies
[37:04] there Josh so I gotta go some place
[37:06] different right it works yeah it works
[37:08] amen St John Chapter 2 amen verse uh
[37:12] let's begin with verse
[37:14] 13 St John 2:13 and the Jews Passover
[37:19] was at hand and Jesus went up to
[37:21] Jerusalem and found in the temple those
[37:24] that sold ox and sheep Dov and changers
[37:27] of money
[37:28] sitting and when he had made a scorge of
[37:31] small cords he drove them all out of the
[37:33] temple and the sheep and The Oxen and
[37:36] poured out the Changers money and
[37:37] overthrew the tables now does that sound
[37:40] like a wonderful Meek quiet
[37:44] humble uh person to you oh they come in
[37:47] and just say oh it's all okay
[37:49] everything's going to be just fine don't
[37:52] worry about it it's you know you can
[37:54] desecrate the most holy place that's
[37:56] been put on this planet it's okay no no
[37:59] no there was a there was a a
[38:02] righteousness to this that Jesus was to
[38:05] bring forth to not desecrate the holy
[38:09] place that uh that was that was set for
[38:12] God not for merchandising it was it was
[38:15] established for God not for
[38:16] merchandising that's why we come that's
[38:18] why when we come in here we don't have a
[38:20] great party right uh we don't carry on
[38:23] and and talk about the basketball scores
[38:25] last night or uh who had the best dinner
[38:28] or uh who who got the new rais on their
[38:31] job or something we we don't do that
[38:33] there's plenty other places to do that
[38:35] there's there's a fellowship there's
[38:37] outside there's restaurants there's
[38:39] homes we can go anywhere and do those we
[38:41] come in here to meet the holies of
[38:43] holies we don't come here to to to
[38:46] merchandise and for changing and for no
[38:48] we come here to meet with God Almighty
[38:51] amen and and to honor that and Jesus was
[38:55] honoring that when he overthrew the
[38:57] table 16th verse he said unto them that
[38:59] sold doves take these things hence make
[39:03] not my father's house and House of
[39:06] merchandise praise the Lord and his
[39:09] disciples remembered that it was written
[39:11] the Zeal of thine house uh ha eaten me
[39:13] up that's Psalm 69 if you will if you
[39:16] wanted to go back and look at it then
[39:18] answer the Jews and we get to this point
[39:20] now that uh of jesus' proclamation see
[39:24] because the angel told them he is risen
[39:27] as he said he would I know I added a few
[39:30] words to that but that's the gist of it
[39:32] he said that he would raise again he has
[39:35] risen like he said he would now we get
[39:38] to that point then answered the Jews
[39:40] said unto him what sign showest thou
[39:42] unto us seeing that thou doest these
[39:44] things Jesus answered and said unto them
[39:47] destroy this Temple and in three days I
[39:50] will raise it up and that is exactly
[39:52] what he did amen amen that is exactly
[39:56] what he did and without spiritual
[39:58] Revelation you don't understand what
[40:00] he's talking about look at them then
[40:02] said the Jews 4 and6 years was this
[40:05] Temple and building and wil thou rear it
[40:06] up rear it up in three days but he spake
[40:10] of the Temple of his body when therefore
[40:13] he was risen from the dead his disciples
[40:16] remembered amen his disciples remembered
[40:20] and a lot of what we do we do in
[40:22] remembrance amen just like the communion
[40:24] we take next week we do in remembrance
[40:27] praise the lord it's not something
[40:29] that's new to us but it's brought to us
[40:31] in remembrance we're all human uh a lot
[40:34] of the you ever heard the phrase the
[40:36] squeaky will gets the grease well that
[40:39] just simply means that the thing that's
[40:41] the most prominent or the thing that's
[40:42] the noisiest gets the most attention
[40:45] well the things that gets the most
[40:46] attention a lot of times in life is just
[40:49] all the stuff that happens in life and
[40:51] all the other things usually the more
[40:53] important things get shoved into the
[40:55] back right and get some times forgotten
[40:58] or at least forgotten for a period of
[40:59] time until it's brought to our
[41:01] remembrance until it's brought forth
[41:04] again of the importance of it see and
[41:06] there in this place it was it was
[41:08] remembrance see therefore he was risen
[41:10] from the dead the disciples remembered
[41:14] praise the Lord that he had said unto
[41:16] them that they would believe the
[41:18] scripture and the word uh Jesus uh that
[41:21] Jesus had said what was it that he had
[41:24] said you destroyed this Temple amen
[41:27] and I will raise it up in three days and
[41:29] that's exactly what Jesus did it was
[41:32] raised up in three days it could not
[41:34] stay in a grave because the grave could
[41:36] not hold God right amen death could not
[41:38] hold God hell could not hold God right
[41:42] all of the things of the of the enemy
[41:44] could not hold God right so he raised
[41:47] again in three days that raising brought
[41:50] about the promises that he had promised
[41:52] see and he told them that but now
[41:54] without spiritual Revelation you can't
[41:57] can't understand it doesn't come as a
[41:59] reality to you because they're still now
[42:02] the disciples looked at that and it come
[42:03] to their remembrance of what he said but
[42:06] all the rest of them look and say well
[42:07] the temple still up they they think
[42:09] about some great buildings and uh these
[42:12] temples that were reared up in so so
[42:14] many years and uh and all this that had
[42:16] taken place that that's all that they
[42:18] got from it it reminds me I was reading
[42:21] uh I was reading in in the last part of
[42:24] Matthew 28 and you know and I have a
[42:26] scope pH Study Bible Scofield was a
[42:28] brilliant man a doctor of divinity um
[42:31] knew the Bible inside and out but if you
[42:34] go back to it's just something as simple
[42:36] as we know as baptism and he goes into
[42:39] Matthew 28 where he's talking about it
[42:42] Jesus said go forth into all the world
[42:44] teaching them and baptizing in the name
[42:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ he actually had
[42:49] of course this is a trinitarian he
[42:51] actually had enough gumption to put in
[42:53] there a brilliant man a man that you
[42:57] probably couldn't touch him for his
[42:59] knowledge of the scripture uh so
[43:02] brilliant would put in there that father
[43:05] son Holy Ghost is the name singular of
[43:09] Jesus Christ amen and I thought how how
[43:13] could such a brilliant man first of all
[43:17] even think even intimate that father is
[43:21] a name that son is a name that Holy
[43:25] Spirit is a name they're not names but
[43:28] yet he puts forth this idea holding to
[43:31] that trinitarian doctrine of three gods
[43:34] that Father Son and Holy Ghost is the
[43:36] singular name of Jesus Christ I thought
[43:39] without Revelation you don't see it
[43:42] right without God revealing it to you
[43:44] just like them looking here and thinking
[43:46] that Jesus is talking about a uh uh this
[43:49] building when Nicodemus came to him
[43:51] Jesus said you must be born again he
[43:52] said how can I enter my mother's womb
[43:54] again the second time
[43:58] with without without spiritual
[43:59] Revelation the carnal cannot see uh the
[44:03] the things of God yes uh the things of
[44:06] God remember we just went through what
[44:08] 15 16 17 Parts God in Simplicity amen
[44:12] God hides it to those that the wise and
[44:15] prudent reveals to those that will learn
[44:18] those that want to know those that have
[44:20] it in their heart to want to be uh uh
[44:23] close to him want to know the things of
[44:25] God now Jesus is here Jesus is here
[44:29] living the same life here that he was
[44:32] living when he was here in the flesh cuz
[44:35] he's still God remember God does not
[44:37] change people look and say that well
[44:39] Jesus did this when he was here but what
[44:42] about today was going to do the exact
[44:44] same thing today or he's not God the
[44:46] difference is the way God is working
[44:49] today is through his through his
[44:51] children God is working his work through
[44:54] us today not here in a Corporal body
[44:56] that we call Jesus Christ but here in
[44:59] Corporal bodies that he has in a many
[45:02] membered body Around The World God is
[45:05] working his work still today doing the
[45:07] same thing as as times change God does
[45:11] not change amen and it's the power of
[45:14] that resurrection that brought it to us
[45:17] it's the power of that resurrection that
[45:19] brought it to us to the place that he
[45:21] could pour himself into us now and that
[45:25] he could live through us yes amen Jesus
[45:29] can live through us because he is alive
[45:32] because he has risen he's the same here
[45:35] today now let's go to St Luke chapter
[45:39] 24 St Luke chapter
[45:45] 24 amen because he's in
[45:48] us the power of the Resurrection was in
[45:51] Jesus yes when they took the life from
[45:53] his body and they could not have done it
[45:56] unless he laid down his life amen they
[45:59] say they took it but he laid it down he
[46:02] laid down his life the power of the
[46:05] Resurrection was already the quickening
[46:07] power was already in Jesus because he's
[46:10] God Almighty the resurrection power the
[46:13] quickening power that quickening just
[46:15] means to make it alive yes that
[46:17] quickening power was already in him now
[46:20] if Jesus through that quickening power
[46:23] raised again from death and Hell
[46:26] conquered death hell in the grave and
[46:28] Rose to ascend upon high at the
[46:30] authority of God people want to say the
[46:33] right hand I know excuse me the Bible
[46:35] says right hand but that simply means
[46:37] the authority and power God's a spirit
[46:39] he doesn't have a right hand like we
[46:41] have amen and if it is he's sitting on
[46:45] the right hand then God's there with his
[46:47] hand underneath Jesus because he's
[46:49] sitting on it no it's the power amen
[46:52] it's the authority that was given if
[46:54] that quickening power now was in Jesus
[46:57] to raise him from the dead and to bring
[46:59] him forth like it did so that he could
[47:02] come back on the day of Pentecost and
[47:04] live his life as he's doing now through
[47:07] every one of us that means that in him
[47:10] being that quickening power through us
[47:12] is now in us the quickening power now is
[47:16] in us the Resurrection The ability of
[47:19] Resurrection is in each one of us that's
[47:22] why we don't fret over those that have
[47:24] passed on we don't worry about the loved
[47:26] ones that have gone on before in Christ
[47:28] because we know that that same
[47:30] quickening power that was in them is
[47:33] going to do the same thing for them that
[47:35] it did for Jesus Christ that it would do
[47:37] for us if we went by the way of the
[47:39] Grave that it will still do for us when
[47:42] the changing of the body and a Rapture
[47:44] takes place amen the dead in Christ
[47:46] shall rise first those who alive and
[47:48] remain shall be caught up together with
[47:50] him to meet the Lord in the air that is
[47:52] the quickening power of God that's to
[47:55] make alive all that that that was dead
[47:58] bring to life that life is now within
[48:02] each and every believer yeah because
[48:04] Jesus is if Christ is there then that
[48:08] quickening power is there the power The
[48:10] Authority that you need to be able to
[48:13] raise if you came if you go by the way
[48:15] of the Grave or if a Rapture to when we
[48:19] are a part of the live and remain group
[48:20] when the Rapture takes place that that
[48:24] quickening power is already there yes
[48:27] amen amen that quickening power that
[48:29] raised Jesus is the same quickening
[48:31] power that will raise
[48:33] you ma uh excuse me Luke chapter 24
[48:36] let's start with verse
[48:38] one I want to read almost the whole
[48:41] chapter I was debating on this whether
[48:43] or not but we' still got some time so
[48:45] let's read the whole thing we'll get to
[48:47] the part that I mentioned earlier too
[48:51] and
[48:52] still the Jews eyes were
[48:55] Holden look at these two here as we read
[48:58] now upon the first uh first day of the
[49:01] week very early in the morning they came
[49:04] unto the SRE bringing the spices which
[49:07] they had prepared and certain others
[49:09] with them and they found the stone
[49:11] rolled away from the Seer and they
[49:13] entered in and found not the body of the
[49:15] Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they
[49:18] were much perplexed thereabout behold
[49:21] two men stood by them in shining
[49:23] garments and as they were afraid and
[49:26] bowed down their their faces to the
[49:27] Earth they said unto them why seek ye
[49:29] the living among the dead praise the
[49:32] Lord did he not tell you he was going to
[49:34] raise again amen he's not here it's been
[49:38] three days that's exactly what he said
[49:40] he's not here why seek ye the living
[49:43] among the dead he is not here but he is
[49:45] risen remember remember how he spoke
[49:50] unto you when he was yet in Galilee
[49:53] saying the son of man must be delivered
[49:55] into the hands of sinful men crucified
[49:57] and the third day Rise Again praise the
[50:00] Lord it has happened amen sir why are
[50:02] you
[50:04] perplexed why are you so confused why
[50:06] are you afraid amen those are all
[50:09] natural normal human uh emotions but the
[50:13] point of it is Faith conquers those when
[50:16] we know what Jesus said amen that
[50:20] because that's what we believe amen
[50:23] humans were taught to believe everything
[50:25] we can see taste Bill Smell or here amen
[50:28] but when we become Christians we're
[50:29] taught to understand that Faith
[50:31] overrides all of those senses and we
[50:34] believe him first yes even if it's
[50:36] things that don't make sense to our eyes
[50:38] or don't make sense to our touch or
[50:40] smell we believe that first because we
[50:43] know that he is the creator of that yes
[50:46] amen The Giver of every good gift praise
[50:49] the Lord seventh verse now saying the
[50:52] son of man must be delivered into the
[50:54] hands of sinful men be crucified the
[50:56] third day they rise again and they
[50:58] remembered again they remembered his
[51:00] words and returned from the SRE and told
[51:03] all those things unto the 11 and to all
[51:06] the rest it was Mary Magdalene and
[51:08] Joanna and Mary the mother of James the
[51:10] other woman that were uh that were with
[51:13] them which told them these things uh
[51:15] told these things unto the discip uh
[51:18] Apostles and their words seemed to uh to
[51:21] them as Idle tales and they believe them
[51:24] not even though they're preaching the
[51:26] word word
[51:27] right they're telling them the truth
[51:31] they're giving them scripture if you
[51:33] will amen they're giving them the word
[51:36] of Jesus we're telling you Jesus said he
[51:40] would do this Jesus did this now we're
[51:43] telling you that it's happened and they
[51:45] still don't believe them my help us Lord
[51:49] help thou our unbelief am then arose
[51:52] Peter and ran into the SRE and stooping
[51:54] down he uh he beheld the linen claws
[51:57] laid by themselves and departing
[51:59] wondering in himself at that which was
[52:02] come to pass behold two of them went the
[52:05] same day to the Village called emus now
[52:07] here we go two men went uh the same day
[52:10] the village called EMAs which was from
[52:12] Jerusalem about three Square for long
[52:14] fur long which is a little over 1700
[52:17] ft and they talked together which is
[52:20] about a quart of a mile and they talked
[52:22] together of all these things which had
[52:24] happened and it came to pass that that
[52:26] while they communed together and reason
[52:29] Jesus himself Drew near and went with
[52:32] them you think that would be great
[52:34] celebration when Jesus draws near amen
[52:38] isn't there great celebration I mean we
[52:41] celebrate here and then bring the the
[52:43] presence of the Lord is here in this
[52:44] great celebration when Jesus draws near
[52:47] when Jesus is in your presence whether
[52:49] you're in your bedroom or closet or
[52:51] where your in your car wherever you are
[52:53] when the presence of Jesus comes there's
[52:55] great celebration but
[52:57] look they went near and went with them
[53:00] but their eyes were Holden that they
[53:02] should not know him amen now were they
[53:06] holding through unbelief were they
[53:08] holding because they of a lack of
[53:11] expectation a lack of faith why were
[53:13] their eyes Holden it doesn't tell us
[53:16] that it could be any number of reasons
[53:17] why their eyes were Holden that they
[53:19] didn't see that that was Jesus normally
[53:22] when Jesus comes around amen we always
[53:26] recog recogniz his
[53:27] presence they see that's the sad part
[53:30] sometimes we don't always recognize
[53:32] God's presence when it comes around we
[53:34] usually in church uh is probably more so
[53:38] but uh sometimes we don't always
[53:40] recognize it's Jesus when Jesus is there
[53:44] Their Eyes Were hold and they didn't
[53:45] know him and he said unto them what
[53:47] manner of communication are these that
[53:49] ye have one with another as you walk and
[53:51] our
[53:52] sad and and the one of them whose name
[53:55] was cleopas answered and said unto him
[53:57] art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem
[53:59] and has not known these things which are
[54:01] come to pass there in these days and
[54:03] he's talking to the one with whom they
[54:05] happen to
[54:06] amen my I I I just think it's just
[54:10] outstanding but you know I I don't look
[54:12] at I don't I try not to look at the
[54:14] Bible as like a book of History I try to
[54:17] look at it to understand what we go
[54:19] through today and how we live and how we
[54:21] feel and the same circumstances that
[54:23] arise and uh and and and what means to
[54:26] us see cuz it's fine that that happened
[54:29] to Copus and his buddy there but how
[54:31] about us amen what about happen in our
[54:34] lives with us today that that's more
[54:37] important to that's actually more
[54:38] important to me because it's me and you
[54:44] amen 19th verse and he said unto them
[54:47] what things and they said unto him
[54:49] concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a
[54:52] prophet Mighty indeed and word before
[54:55] God and all the people and how the chief
[54:57] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[55:00] be condemned to death and have crucified
[55:03] him now you can see on one hand where
[55:06] when when they saw him they fell at his
[55:08] feet they grabbed his feet in worship
[55:11] the others are sitting over
[55:13] there thankful celebrating that they
[55:17] crucified him they finally got rid of
[55:19] him though so they thought they finally
[55:22] got rid of it this men to our religion
[55:25] we talked about religion last week don't
[55:28] like religion that that solidifies our
[55:31] religion we finally got rid of him well
[55:33] they didn't get rid of them all they did
[55:35] was remember that remember the story I
[55:37] told you maybe some here had hadn't
[55:40] heard the story I told you about when we
[55:43] used to when me and my family used to
[55:44] live in Florida they had these big brown
[55:46] spiders they weren't dangerous or
[55:49] poisonous necessarily but they were they
[55:51] were big I mean literally legs and all
[55:54] could get that big and I'm not exag am I
[55:56] exaggerating no no I'm they would get
[55:59] that big well one time there was a woman
[56:02] that I heard the story about that and
[56:04] they're hard to get rid of because
[56:05] they're they fall off the trees you
[56:07] can't exterminate them you can
[56:09] exterminate but they would fall off the
[56:11] trees and just get in your house so to
[56:14] exterminate them in the in the corners
[56:16] and all it didn't work they just come
[56:18] fall for tree come in and one time a a
[56:21] woman had one on the side of her wall in
[56:24] her kitchen and it's one of the big
[56:27] and she and she said well I'll just kill
[56:29] this thing so she grabs I believe she
[56:31] waded up some newspaper uh which is
[56:34] usually my weapon of choice uh with a
[56:36] spider or something she wed up a
[56:38] newspaper and she went in I believe it's
[56:39] in the kitchen and she whacked that
[56:41] spider as hard as she could and smashed
[56:43] it flat little did she know that
[56:46] underneath that spider was a egg sack oh
[56:50] and as soon as she killed that spider
[56:52] that egg sack went poof and hundreds of
[56:55] spiders went all all over her
[56:58] house that's exactly what the devil did
[57:01] he thought I'll take I'll roll up a
[57:03] newspaper and I'll smack Jesus one good
[57:05] time and I'll kill him and be done with
[57:07] him and all he did was when he put Jesus
[57:10] in the grave was that his life came back
[57:13] and now he's got to deal with all of us
[57:15] instead of one person now he's got
[57:17] millions to deal with they had to tent
[57:19] that woman's house and fumigated for a
[57:22] week or two to get rid of all those
[57:23] little bitty spiders all over that house
[57:26] amen Satan can fumigate all he wants say
[57:28] but he ain't going to get rid of us yes
[57:30] amen he thought he smashed he thought he
[57:33] smashed Jesus Christ all he did was
[57:35] create multi-millions of people that
[57:38] believe today right who's who his life
[57:41] is
[57:42] in Praise the Lord don't think it worked
[57:45] out quite like he was hoping amen but
[57:49] anyway it happened so that we now could
[57:52] testify of the things of God the things
[57:56] he does
[57:59] Amen Mighty now word uh a word before
[58:04] God to all the people 21st and how the
[58:06] chief priests and our rulers delivered
[58:09] him to be condemned to death and have
[58:11] crucified him but we trusted that it had
[58:14] been he which should have redeemed
[58:17] Israel and beside all this today is the
[58:19] third day since these things were done
[58:22] which should have already triggered in
[58:23] their mind what he said about the third
[58:25] day right
[58:27] amen and yay uh certain women also of
[58:30] their of our company made us astonished
[58:33] which were early at the seler when they
[58:35] found not his body they came saying uh
[58:38] that they had also seen a vision of
[58:40] angels uh which said that he was alive
[58:43] and it really wasn't a vision the Angels
[58:45] were just there amen it doesn't say if
[58:47] there if it's present it doesn't need a
[58:49] vision vision is of something that is
[58:52] not present there amen these were the
[58:55] angel was l Lally there but considering
[58:58] the spiritual aspect they considered it
[59:00] a vision which said he was alive and ser
[59:04] of them which were with uh were with us
[59:06] went to the SRE and found it even so as
[59:08] the women said but him they saw not he
[59:12] said unto them oh fools here we go we
[59:15] saw about earlier oh fools and slow of
[59:17] heart to believe all that the prophets
[59:20] have spoken and we could have taken all
[59:22] the dozens of scriptures that all
[59:24] through the Old Testament was written
[59:26] about Jesus birth death Resurrection
[59:29] amen
[59:30] amen uh old fools slow of heart to
[59:33] believe all that the prophets have
[59:34] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[59:37] these things entered into his glory
[59:40] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[59:42] he expounded unto them in the scripture
[59:44] the things concerning himself and they
[59:46] drew n to the Village whether they went
[59:48] and he made as though it were he would
[59:49] have gone further but they constrained
[59:52] him saying abide with us for it is
[59:54] toward evening and the day is
[1:00:56] like to uh look at it as much a
[1:01:00] spiritual aspect as a natural aspect in
[1:01:03] the spiritual aspect of it the natural
[1:01:05] aspect sure the hands taking them
[1:01:08] breaking it but the spiritual aspect to
[1:01:11] me says volumes because what he did was
[1:01:16] he took bread amen he took bread now
[1:01:21] Jesus was the bread of
[1:01:24] life and he took bread bread which we
[1:01:26] consider as food as the word of God this
[1:01:30] is the meat this is the bread this is
[1:01:32] the food of God he he took the bread and
[1:01:35] he broke it to them he took the truth he
[1:01:38] took the word and he broke it to them
[1:01:40] the scripture says he started at Moses
[1:01:43] and he expounded to them through Moses
[1:01:45] and all the prophets and began to
[1:01:47] expound to them all the scriptures that
[1:01:49] talking about Jesus and spiritually as
[1:01:53] he broke the bread there eyes came open
[1:01:57] amen what what what would take the
[1:02:02] scales Open the Eyes uh of of of us of
[1:02:07] of the spirit of of of uh of our
[1:02:11] unbelief is when Jesus broke the bread
[1:02:14] it's the breaking of the bread that
[1:02:16] helps us be able to see who he is amen
[1:02:19] recognized by Revelation who Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ is comes through the breaking of
[1:02:24] the bread when he breaks the bread forth
[1:02:27] to us and it comes a realization and a
[1:02:30] revelation to our hearts it comes fresh
[1:02:33] something opens to us amen Revelation
[1:02:37] something that opens to us um I've used
[1:02:41] the analogy many times about Revelation
[1:02:45] is like the Jesus sign you ever seen the
[1:02:48] Jesus sign that that uh the accentuated
[1:02:52] parts of the Jesus sign is on the parts
[1:02:54] that don't say Jesus you look at it uh
[1:02:57] you ever seen one of these signs you and
[1:03:00] and you look at it and it could be
[1:03:02] anything but it it was it was to me it
[1:03:05] became popular years ago uh that Jesus
[1:03:08] was in the sign yes
[1:03:10] and I had someone that I believe the
[1:03:13] first time I saw it had a sign up and
[1:03:15] said what do you
[1:03:17] see all I see is a bunch of wooden
[1:03:20] scribbly uh
[1:03:22] scribbles uh well look at it I look at
[1:03:25] it have any of you ever seen these
[1:03:28] yes that the hidden message if you will
[1:03:31] that's inside yes the the accentuated
[1:03:34] parts are the outside parts and all you
[1:03:37] look at and all you see is you see that
[1:03:40] the accentuated parts and you look and
[1:03:42] said well that doesn't make any sense at
[1:03:43] all there's just a a piece of wood that
[1:03:45] goes up like that and a piece of wood
[1:03:46] that goes down like this and that
[1:03:48] doesn't make any sense to me look at it
[1:03:50] harder and it took and I'll be honest
[1:03:53] with you
[1:03:54] uh
[1:03:56] I'm not the brightest bulb in the
[1:03:58] chandelier but uh I like to think I can
[1:04:01] see stuff sometimes when it comes like
[1:04:03] riddles and things and I looked and I it
[1:04:06] took me a while to be able to see it it
[1:04:08] really did but once I saw it it finally
[1:04:12] dawned on me with nobody whoever was
[1:04:15] doing it was mean uh they wouldn't show
[1:04:19] me the Jes you they nope it was up to me
[1:04:23] you were either going to see it or you
[1:04:25] weren't going to see it
[1:04:26] finally I mean drove me crazy it's like
[1:04:30] things like that just I I my wife will
[1:04:32] tell you I just I can't stuff like that
[1:04:35] just drives I got to figure it out or
[1:04:37] find it out or remember something or it
[1:04:40] just I it will stay with me day and
[1:04:42] night till I figure out that person or
[1:04:45] that place or whatever it was uh I've
[1:04:47] seen that person before I know I've seen
[1:04:49] that person before where I don't know
[1:04:52] and it drive me crazy till I find out
[1:04:54] till I remember drive me crazy looking
[1:04:57] at that thing and what does that
[1:04:59] say or or are they just playing a trick
[1:05:02] on me now this is like I said the first
[1:05:05] time I'd ever seen that are they playing
[1:05:06] a trick on me but finally finally took
[1:05:10] me a while but finally I was looking at
[1:05:12] it and I said there it is j s u
[1:05:16] s it came so
[1:05:19] clear that when I look at it I said
[1:05:22] there it is it's that simple all the all
[1:05:25] all the accentuated parts that are the
[1:05:27] outside parts of the letters went away
[1:05:31] cuz all I could see was Jesus amen when
[1:05:34] something becomes real to you by the
[1:05:37] word by the spirit revealing the word to
[1:05:39] you when it becomes real to you you
[1:05:41] don't see the outside parts anymore all
[1:05:44] you see is Jesus amen that's all you can
[1:05:47] see anymore I can look at however many
[1:05:49] of those signs all different colors all
[1:05:52] different shades and all I ever see now
[1:05:55] is Jesus I don't see the other part
[1:05:56] anymore I can look at it all I've tried
[1:05:59] I've actually tried to take one of those
[1:06:02] signs it's been a long time ago but I've
[1:06:04] actually tried to take one of those
[1:06:06] signs and look only at the inside part I
[1:06:09] cannot do it all I see is Jesus amen
[1:06:13] amen well when God reveals himself to
[1:06:16] you friend that's all you see yes amen
[1:06:19] that's all you see is Jesus you don't
[1:06:21] see all the other stuff all the other
[1:06:23] stuff Fades away all the all the other
[1:06:25] stuff goes away all the things that
[1:06:27] people may believe or may say to you or
[1:06:29] try to convince you of this that or the
[1:06:30] other no all you see is Jesus from that
[1:06:34] time forward you can look at that sign a
[1:06:35] thousand times and it'll say Jesus every
[1:06:38] time amen you can look at like baptism
[1:06:40] we talked about earlier somebody can try
[1:06:42] to come along and convince you that it's
[1:06:44] this way because Jesus said amen but
[1:06:49] when you look at it all you see is Jesus
[1:06:52] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen that's all
[1:06:56] you can see praise the Lord no matter
[1:06:58] how what great argument anybody could
[1:07:00] come up with I had somebody come and
[1:07:02] tell me one time at work I was talking
[1:07:04] to when I was in business in Charlotte
[1:07:06] said well but Jesus said see it's here
[1:07:10] Jesus is this is Jesus own words I said
[1:07:13] yeah and Jesus own words were also that
[1:07:17] here Peter I give you the keys to the
[1:07:20] kingdom of heaven whatever you bound on
[1:07:22] Earth is bound in heaven and right after
[1:07:25] after that Jesus said father son the
[1:07:28] Holy Ghost Peter comes out the day of
[1:07:31] Pentecost fresh from receiving the
[1:07:32] presence in the holy spirit of God and
[1:07:35] says baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:07:37] Jesus Christ you tell me which is which
[1:07:41] was Peter wrong or was Jesus
[1:07:44] wrong that's
[1:07:46] quiet but the pro truth of it is neither
[1:07:49] one's wrong amen praise the Lord cuz
[1:07:54] Jesus said in the name of Father Son and
[1:07:56] the Holy Ghost and Peter came forth and
[1:07:58] told what that name was the Lord Jesus
[1:08:01] Christ now when you see that it don't
[1:08:03] matter how many people come around and
[1:08:05] try to tell you that it's the father Son
[1:08:07] and the Holy Ghost you don't see
[1:08:08] anything but Jesus yes you don't see all
[1:08:11] the other stuff right amen cuz God's
[1:08:14] revealed it that these when they saw
[1:08:16] this breaking of the bread that's all
[1:08:18] they could see when their eyes came open
[1:08:21] when Jesus broke the bread forth and and
[1:08:24] their eyes came open all they saw was
[1:08:26] Jesus yes amen now he disappeared from
[1:08:29] their sight he he left as it said they
[1:08:32] he vanished out of their sight but all
[1:08:34] they saw them was Jesus praise the Lord
[1:08:38] they said one to another our hearts
[1:08:40] burned within us while he talked to us
[1:08:43] by the way while he opened to us the
[1:08:47] scripture they rose up the same hour
[1:08:49] returned to Jerusalem and found the 11
[1:08:51] gathered together to them that were
[1:08:53] there uh uh that were there with them
[1:08:55] saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath
[1:08:58] appeared to Simon and they told what
[1:09:01] things were done in the way and how he
[1:09:04] was known of them in the breaking of the
[1:09:07] bread praise the Lord I get the physical
[1:09:09] aspect of but to me that spiritual
[1:09:12] aspect of him breaking the word the
[1:09:15] bread of life breaking it to them amen
[1:09:18] help their eyes to come open because
[1:09:21] their eyes weren't physically blind they
[1:09:23] weren't physically blind they were
[1:09:25] spiritually blind they could see they
[1:09:28] could see just like me and you can see
[1:09:31] with their eyes they were spiritually
[1:09:33] blind so what needed restoring not their
[1:09:36] physical sight their spiritual sight
[1:09:39] when their spiritual sight was was
[1:09:41] restored they saw who he was amen they
[1:09:44] said our hearts burnt amen and it became
[1:09:48] known to us as he broke the bread to us
[1:09:51] and thus they uh uh uh and as they thus
[1:09:54] spake Jesus himself stood in the midst
[1:09:56] of them and said unto them peace be unto
[1:10:00] you but they were but they were
[1:10:02] terrified and a frighten and supposed
[1:10:04] that they had seen a spirit and he said
[1:10:07] unto them why are you troubled and why
[1:10:09] do your uh why do thoughts arise in your
[1:10:12] hearts behold my hands my feet that it
[1:10:16] is not I myself handle me see for us uh
[1:10:20] uh and see for a spirit hath not flesh
[1:10:23] and bone as you see me
[1:10:25] have praise the Lord he's letting them
[1:10:28] know when he had thus spoken he showed
[1:10:30] them his hands his feet while they were
[1:10:33] yet believe uh and while they yet
[1:10:35] believed not for joy and wondered he
[1:10:37] said unto them have ye any meat they
[1:10:40] gave him a piece of Broad Fish and a
[1:10:41] honeycomb he took it he didn't eat
[1:10:43] before them he said unto them these are
[1:10:46] the words which I spake unto you while I
[1:10:49] was with you that all things must be
[1:10:52] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:10:54] of Moses in the prophets in the Psalms
[1:10:57] concerning me then opened he their
[1:11:01] understanding that they might understand
[1:11:03] the scripture that's understand we say
[1:11:05] understand uh do we have a do we have a
[1:11:09] spiritual understanding do we have a
[1:11:11] have we been educated into it uh what is
[1:11:14] the understanding the understanding came
[1:11:16] from the spirit of God that brought the
[1:11:19] word life to them just as he had done
[1:11:22] the road those in the road to him he
[1:11:25] brought that Revelation that
[1:11:27] understanding that they would know what
[1:11:29] he W who he was and what he was talking
[1:11:31] about right this is that in other words
[1:11:36] amen praise the Lord or this day yall
[1:11:42] know why this day this scripture is
[1:11:45] fulfilled amen before you
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:51] wonderful then open NE understand they
[1:11:53] might understand the scripture said unto
[1:11:55] them thus it is written and thus it
[1:11:57] behoove Christ to suffer and to rise
[1:11:59] from the dead the third day and that and
[1:12:02] that repentance and remission of sins
[1:12:04] should be preached in the name uh among
[1:12:07] all nations beginning at Jerusalem ye
[1:12:09] are witnesses of these things praise the

[1:12:13] read and we'll close here St John again
[1:12:17] chapter
[1:12:21] 14 now they failed to recognize the
[1:12:24] presence of God what was the reason they
[1:12:26] fail to recognize it because they did
[1:12:27] not believe what he had told them
[1:12:31] right was it that all the things of Life
[1:12:35] had taken over them at that time and
[1:12:37] obviously the first thing on their mind
[1:12:39] was the crucifixion of of him uh and and
[1:12:43] his crucifixion that obviously would
[1:12:45] have been the first thing on his mind on
[1:12:47] their on the people's mind was the
[1:12:49] crucifixion they forget about these
[1:12:52] other the the things that needed to be
[1:12:54] brought to their remembrance
[1:12:56] amen now when it's brought to
[1:12:57] remembrance that now the unbeliever just
[1:13:00] doesn't believe but the believer sees

[1:20:36] headed down a bad path not a good one at
[1:20:40] all and Jesus came although I found
[1:20:44] there was a reason it was a little bit
[1:20:46] of a reason of course I was born in sin
[1:20:49] shap iniquity come the world speaking

[1:22:30] have communion in foot washing however I
[1:22:33] was unable to get a hold of Craig um I
[1:22:37] maybe he was out for Easter I don't know
[1:22:39] uh what was going on so I wasn't able to
[1:22:41] talk to him this week so I can't plan
[1:22:43] anything for next Sunday uh for uh
[1:22:47] getting the room next door uh my wife
[1:22:50] mentioned uh if it was something
[1:22:52] everyone still would be up to trying we
[1:22:55] could go to like the sweet tomatoes that
[1:22:56] just opened back up on Broadway uh and
[1:22:59] have a meal together it was I guess it's
[1:23:02] the same uh big dining area so I don't
[1:23:06] think there'd be any problem having
[1:23:08] being able to sit together uh if that's
[1:23:10] something that is interested to you just
[1:23:12] let me know um otherwise we'll try to
[1:23:15] postpone and just make we don't have to
[1:23:17] have the dinner with the community foot
[1:23:18] wash and we can do it anytime as soon as
[1:23:21] I can get a hold of Craig and get
[1:23:22] permission we'll have something next so
