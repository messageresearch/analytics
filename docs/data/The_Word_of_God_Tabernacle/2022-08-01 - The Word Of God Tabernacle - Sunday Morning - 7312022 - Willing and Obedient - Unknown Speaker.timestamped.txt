[24:23] want to write it down um but we are
[24:26] actually dealing with somebody smoking
[24:28] in our building
[24:29] um it's really bad and i was talking to
[24:32] sister norma and she said sister judy
[24:34] arnold deals with
[24:36] loud music
[24:38] and so you know those i just feel like
[24:40] those
[24:41] demons are getting more and more rampant
[24:43] and um
[24:45] legality-wise
[24:46] it's on our side because we are in a
[24:50] designated non-smoking building so um if
[24:53] you can just please pray those
[24:56] just to rebuke those and give us some
[24:58] peace i my heart just goes out to sister
[25:02] judy and
[25:03] yes this is just it's just awful it's
[25:05] awful
[25:07] and and more brazen too yes those demons
[25:10] are getting more worries
[25:11] than they used to be
[25:13] you used to kind of lurk around the
[25:14] shadows and the corners and stuff but
[25:16] they're just those demons are right in
[25:18] your face anymore and they really don't
[25:20] care
[25:21] uh you
[25:23] you might even find the smoker and tell
[25:25] them to quit and they'll
[25:27] who knows what they would do they just
[25:29] don't care anymore uh but
[25:31] greater is he that's in us
[25:33] in the world i mean we serve a living
[25:35] god it can handle and take care of any
[25:37] of those situations so remember that
[25:39] prayer sister norma's not here because
[25:42] her car's uh acting up and she's got a
[25:45] mechanic they're working on it hopefully
[25:46] she said they'll have it done

[29:14] last week i can't remember the exact day
[29:16] i was walking on the river walk and i
[29:18] had to step off the path
[29:20] get out of the way of people i stood
[29:22] there and just looked at the desert
[29:24] then i looked down and about three feet
[29:26] to my left was a fairly large
[29:28] diamondback rattlesnake
[29:30] curled up sleeping i want to thank the
[29:33] lord that i didn't get much closer and
[29:35] he kept the snake asleep protecting me
[29:38] amen
[29:41] and we kind of had that we went there
[29:43] last year
[29:44] went over by la canada where when the
[29:47] river was flowing so heavy and the snake
[29:50] just come right by in front of us

[43:31] pray for us but uh kind of excited about
[43:34] that thankful the lord put it on his
[43:35] heart for one to be baptized yes so amen
[43:39] kind of almost goes to the service here
[43:42] amen we want to talk this morning about
[43:44] someone who is uh
[43:46] that the lord has who's uh willing to
[43:49] allow
[43:50] him
[43:51] to use them
[43:54] people someone anyone who is willing to
[43:57] relinquish their rights
[44:00] their thoughts everything about
[44:01] themselves to the lord jesus that he may
[44:03] use them because that's who god's
[44:06] looking for god's looking for someone
[44:08] who is not only able to do something but
[44:11] willing to do something and if you look
[44:13] at this the scripture says here in
[44:15] isaiah if ye be willing and obedient
[44:18] amen willing and obedient
[44:21] ye shall eat of the good of that lamb
[44:23] but if you refuse and rebel which of
[44:25] course is the just the opposite of of
[44:28] willing and obedient if you refuse and
[44:31] rebel you should shall be devoured with
[44:33] the sword we know the sword is the word
[44:35] for the mouth of the lord has spoken it
[44:37] and if you go and look at several places
[44:39] in the scripture we find out that the
[44:42] sword that comes forth is
[44:44] out of the mouth of god is the word of
[44:46] god the sword is the word is a sharp
[44:49] powerful sword
[44:51] that sword will devour the enemy those
[44:53] who are unwilling
[44:55] to relinquish themselves to the lord
[44:57] unwilling to allow god to use them
[44:59] unwilling for god to move them and shape
[45:02] them and and whatever his desire and
[45:04] perfect will for any of us is and i
[45:06] trust and believe that
[45:08] we we in ourselves
[45:10] want the lord's perfect will in our
[45:12] lives and are willing to allow god to
[45:14] move us in the capacity that he would so
[45:17] that we he could accomplish through us
[45:20] what what that perfect will is
[45:22] we are the ones that god uses we are the
[45:25] subjects that god uses uh to accomplish
[45:28] whatever he wants done in this world
[45:30] today and he's looking for people who
[45:32] want to do it not obligated not that you
[45:35] have to do it he wants people that want
[45:38] to do it people that are willing to do
[45:39] it people that have a desire of god
[45:42] whatever it is and wherever it is lord
[45:44] send me i mean that's
[45:46] with isaiah's cry there uh in isaiah he
[45:49] said you know when when the coal of fire
[45:52] touched the prophet he said lord send me
[45:56] what can i do
[45:58] what how can i uh be of service to you
[46:02] what how can you use me to accomplish
[46:05] what you want done lord you send me
[46:07] whatever it is send me
[46:09] uh you look in the scripture many places
[46:11] people of god like that just like mary
[46:14] uh
[46:15] when the angel come to marion where she
[46:17] had a couple of questions to him and but
[46:20] the angel of the lord finally said you
[46:22] were the chosen one and she said be it
[46:23] unto me
[46:25] according to your will
[46:26] she was willing to take her approach
[46:29] she was willing to take the suffering
[46:31] she was willing to go through everything
[46:33] the ridicule she had to go through now
[46:35] today
[46:38] if it were to happen today there's
[46:39] probably not a lot of ridicule that goes
[46:41] on because it probably happens all the
[46:43] time but
[46:44] back at that time there was a huge
[46:46] ridicule you were ostracized you were
[46:49] stoned you were put out if you were
[46:51] unmarried and found with child
[46:54] so
[46:55] for her to say that was a big deal it
[46:57] meant something for her to say
[46:59] i am willing to do whatever you want me
[47:02] to do be it unto me according to your
[47:04] will and that should be this subject
[47:06] that should be the
[47:08] the anthem the theme of every one of us
[47:11] every christian be it unto me according
[47:13] to your will and she was willing to do
[47:15] it regardless of what it cost her
[47:18] regardless of what it took even joseph
[47:20] was going to put her away
[47:22] and mind if he put her away privately
[47:24] until an angel came to him and says no
[47:26] no no you take you take her she's your
[47:28] wife you take her to yourself what's in
[47:31] her is of the holy ghost
[47:33] he'll come forth the son of god you'll
[47:35] call his name jesus
[47:37] amen and he did just that but if it
[47:39] weren't for god
[47:40] he was still even willing to to
[47:44] take the reproach whatever it costs now
[47:46] god is always
[47:48] he's always looking for someone who is
[47:50] willing always in fact god may choose
[47:53] somebody
[47:54] uh
[47:56] a lot of times you hear criticisms of of
[47:58] people saying things about somebody
[48:00] doing something for the lord remember
[48:02] the disciples even came to jesus one
[48:04] time and said jesus this man is out here
[48:07] praying he doesn't know anything about
[48:09] you
[48:10] jesus said leave him alone he said if
[48:11] he's not against us he's for us
[48:14] amen so if he's for us and uh leave him
[48:17] alone let him do what he's doing because
[48:18] he's if he's doing the work of the lord
[48:20] let him alone if he's going out and
[48:22] praying for people and people are being
[48:24] healed and things are being done leave
[48:25] him alone see but there's always seems
[48:28] like there's always people who want to
[48:30] be critical
[48:31] of others and say well he shouldn't be
[48:33] doing that or she shouldn't be over
[48:34] there or she shouldn't mirror he
[48:35] shouldn't and always critical but you
[48:37] know god god may allow someone to do so
[48:41] god may call somebody to do something
[48:44] that uh that maybe they're not as
[48:46] qualified as somebody else to do but
[48:48] they're willing to do it
[48:50] the person who may be the utmost
[48:53] qualified the person who may be in the
[48:55] best position to do it the person who
[48:57] may know the most about it and have the
[48:59] most gift in this capacity are but
[49:02] they're unwilling to do what god wants
[49:04] them to do well god's not going to use
[49:06] somebody he doesn't care how
[49:09] trained they are or how
[49:11] able they are to do so how much
[49:12] knowledge they have
[49:14] he wants somebody willing he wants
[49:16] somebody that is willing to allow god to
[49:19] move upon that person to do whatever it
[49:22] is he called them to do because if that
[49:25] person is winged every other obstacle
[49:28] can be overcome if a person's willing
[49:32] if a person is willing to learn if a
[49:34] person is willing to submit themselves
[49:36] if a person is willing to
[49:38] relinquish their rights and their
[49:40] abilities their thoughts into the hands
[49:43] of the master god can absolutely
[49:46] annihilate any other obstacle
[49:48] anything else he can teach he can bring
[49:51] along
[49:53] a willing subject is a teachable subject
[49:56] it's somebody that god can teach that
[49:58] god can show that god can use yes god
[50:02] can't use somebody who's
[50:04] they may be fully qualified but they
[50:06] just don't want to do it
[50:09] they're just unwilling to do it god well
[50:11] you know i'm fully capable lord i'm
[50:13] probably more capable anybody but i
[50:15] don't want to go there
[50:17] i don't want to go over there i don't
[50:18] want to do that i don't want to be put
[50:20] in that situation i don't want to be
[50:22] found ridiculed
[50:24] god's looking for somebody willing
[50:27] amen i remember
[50:28] when we went to florida when i moved to
[50:30] florida friend
[50:32] the ridicule i got
[50:34] the people that came against me the
[50:36] things that were said about me
[50:38] my life was threatened
[50:41] a lot of people may not know that and i
[50:43] probably may have never said that out
[50:44] loud and i'm not really sure why i said
[50:46] it just then
[50:47] uh but it came out and it's the truth
[50:50] i mean i had a a an elder minister
[50:54] pastor this message says there are men
[50:56] in their graves today that tried to come
[50:58] against this work
[51:00] i mean
[51:01] i consider that a threat
[51:03] it was
[51:05] and and i was probably the least
[51:07] qualified
[51:08] i was probably the least able i was
[51:10] probably the least one in that situation
[51:13] but when god said go i was willing to go
[51:16] hallelujah
[51:17] when god wanted something to be done and
[51:20] i was willing to do it god sent me to go
[51:22] do it
[51:23] it wasn't easy but god always took care
[51:27] god always blessed you because you asked
[51:29] my wife
[51:30] i laid the bed for two or three days
[51:31] because i was so depressed i couldn't
[51:33] even get out it's the only time i've
[51:34] ever been in a situation like that
[51:37] i've never been in that situation but i
[51:39] had it had just come down so hard and so
[51:42] heavy on me i just couldn't handle it
[51:44] anymore she knelt by my bed and prayed
[51:47] for me
[51:48] because it just i just couldn't do it
[51:51] but after those prayers and the strength
[51:53] of the lord
[51:54] god i believe accomplished whatever he
[51:57] sent me there to do and when that was
[51:59] done god sent me back here to tucson to
[52:02] be with brother greene
[52:03] i pray and assume that whatever that was
[52:06] and
[52:06] whatever the lord's doing we just want
[52:09] to be willing to do it
[52:10] whether
[52:12] we are the top-notch able or in the
[52:14] position
[52:15] god can
[52:17] god can completely obliterate all other
[52:20] obstacles if you're willing to do it
[52:23] but he just wants somebody who's willing
[52:25] to do it
[52:27] and that flies in the face
[52:30] of so much of the world's
[52:33] spirit anymore
[52:35] because the world spirit is
[52:38] or somebody else will do it
[52:40] oh somebody else will take care of it i
[52:43] mean if you don't believe that go
[52:45] our beautiful tucson city
[52:48] you go walk and look around the city go
[52:50] down the interstates and walk in and see
[52:52] just the filth and the trash and stuff
[52:54] everywhere
[52:56] i was driving down the street going back
[52:58] uh uh the other day in florida
[53:01] and
[53:02] there's this young couple man and woman
[53:05] there and she had this walmart bag in
[53:08] her hand and she was flinging it up and
[53:10] i didn't know what the world they were
[53:11] doing they were in a convertible and she
[53:13] just threw the bag out just to go out in
[53:15] the middle of well somebody else will
[53:17] pick it up it's not my problem anymore
[53:19] it's a spirit
[53:21] and it's a prevalent spirit today
[53:23] because you see it everywhere
[53:25] they're not concerned with those things
[53:27] somebody else will do it
[53:29] somebody it's somebody else's problem i
[53:31] don't have to deal with it anymore
[53:33] it's sad
[53:35] but that falls in the face flies in the
[53:37] face of the spirit of god who's looking
[53:39] for someone who's willing to do it
[53:42] someone who wants to do it don't let it
[53:44] become somebody else's issue don't let
[53:46] it become somebody else's problem if the
[53:48] lord leads you to do something if the
[53:50] lord speaks to you to do something if
[53:52] god's calling you he's just looking for
[53:54] someone who's willing to say okay lord
[53:56] i'll do it
[53:58] i'll go
[53:59] i'll i'll be put in that situation i'll
[54:02] be put lord just
[54:04] whatever it is i know you'll take care
[54:06] of me i know you'll bless it whatever it
[54:08] is look at first chronicles let's go
[54:10] over to the 28th verse
[54:13] first chronicles 28.
[54:22] amen first chronicles chapter 28 verse
[54:25] 9.
[54:29] look at the exhortation given to solomon
[54:31] here
[54:35] first chronicles 28 9 and thou solomon
[54:38] my son
[54:39] know thou the god of thy father and
[54:41] serve him with a perfect heart and with
[54:44] a willing mind
[54:46] don't close yourself down
[54:48] don't shut yourself down to say well
[54:50] i'll never do that i'll never go there
[54:53] or i'll i'll never speak to this person
[54:55] all right you know
[54:57] and a lot of times
[54:59] if you really are willing
[55:01] god will call you to do something you
[55:02] really don't want to do i mean look at
[55:04] jonah god called jonah now jonah was
[55:08] willing you think jonah wasn't willing
[55:10] that's why he went to
[55:11] tarshish
[55:13] he wasn't willing but
[55:15] but
[55:16] if you if you boil down to the man's
[55:18] heart i believe he was willing because
[55:20] that's how that's why he ended up doing
[55:21] it anyway
[55:23] but he wanted somebody that was willing
[55:25] and god called this man for that purpose
[55:28] god called him for that purpose and he
[55:30] tried to run
[55:31] but of course when god arrested he was
[55:33] like yeah okay god i'll i'll go at that
[55:36] word whatever you want me to do i'll do
[55:38] it and he was the perfect person for the
[55:41] perfect place
[55:42] all that happened for the for the
[55:44] fulfillment of god's will in his life so
[55:46] that it would happen a willing mind he
[55:48] had a willing mind
[55:50] a lot of times god will call you to do
[55:52] something you don't want to do
[55:54] he may send you to a place you don't
[55:56] want to go he'll have you living
[55:57] somewhere you don't want to live
[56:00] but if he wants you to do it if it's his
[56:02] will for some reason
[56:04] he's just want somebody who's willing to
[56:06] do it
[56:07] amen if you're willing to do it now
[56:10] sometimes it's the hard stuff that makes
[56:12] the
[56:13] that's the hardest part too
[56:15] amen god that god doesn't just god
[56:17] doesn't just have jobs that are just
[56:19] nice little easy flowery jobs so a lot
[56:22] of the things that god assigns us to do
[56:24] are hard things they're things that
[56:26] great against our flesh there are things
[56:28] we don't want to do there are things
[56:30] that come against what we would desire
[56:33] but
[56:34] but he wants the person that's with a
[56:37] willing mind
[56:39] that is that wants to do it amen whether
[56:42] you're able to do it or not let god take
[56:44] care of the able part
[56:45] amen he'll take care of the abel park if
[56:47] you're just willing to do it
[56:49] a perfect heart with a willing mind for
[56:52] the lord searches all hearts and
[56:54] understandeth all the imaginations of
[56:57] the thoughts if thou seek him he will be
[57:00] found of thee but if thou forsake him he
[57:02] will cast thee all forever
[57:05] willy
[57:06] have a willing mind god just needs
[57:08] somebody to work through that has a
[57:10] willing mind that's able to do it now
[57:12] look at this
[57:15] uh i've probably read this quote before
[57:17] i think it's
[57:18] a
[57:19] very fairly powerful quote but
[57:23] and he says it more places than one but
[57:25] look at this from that time spokane
[57:27] washington 1962 he says
[57:29] god only wants one man
[57:32] and i will say one woman
[57:35] amen one man one person
[57:39] god wants one man that he can fully get
[57:42] in his complete control
[57:45] that's right one man that'll fully
[57:48] surrender to him
[57:50] just like he did moses
[57:52] just like he's talked about moses he was
[57:54] talking about moses i'm going down there
[57:56] to take over what a ridiculous thing an
[57:58] army like in those days he had the whole
[58:01] world conquered a bigger army than it
[58:03] would be today than to meet like to meet
[58:05] russia
[58:06] he had an old crooked stick in his hand
[58:09] talking about moses
[58:11] uh the stick the power of god he's going
[58:13] whiskers blowing back and forth 80 years
[58:15] old why didn't he do it when he was a
[58:18] young warrior see god had to knock all
[58:21] that intellectual out of him he had to
[58:24] take him on the backside of the desert
[58:26] mash him down crash him down
[58:29] and bring him back and appear him
[58:32] and appear to him and show him what he
[58:34] was to do
[58:37] one person
[58:39] one man
[58:40] if he could get that one person
[58:42] if god
[58:44] that one person in his complete control
[58:48] understand now complete control total
[58:51] dying out to ourselves
[58:53] complete control
[58:55] he said he would but the man said
[58:57] god could turn this world upside down
[59:01] one person
[59:03] in his complete control
[59:05] why could you just imagine but you want
[59:07] to be that one person
[59:09] makes you wonder lord what is
[59:11] what would it take
[59:12] to be that one person what would it take
[59:15] to be that one that's willing
[59:17] you know they had this
[59:19] this
[59:20] gambling lottery stuff here this week
[59:22] with all the billions of dollars that
[59:24] was out
[59:25] of for people to
[59:27] to gamble on and and to try to
[59:30] become rich overnight you got one point
[59:32] something billion i forgot what it was a
[59:34] mind-boggling amount of money an amount
[59:37] of money that would be a struggle for
[59:38] anybody to spend in a lifetime
[59:41] but these people are going crazy buying
[59:43] tickets everywhere by the hundreds by
[59:46] the thousands trying to win this this
[59:49] little bit of money
[59:51] i thought my if
[59:54] if people could get so sold out to
[59:57] christ
[59:58] like they were to try to win this little
[1:00:00] bit of money that's going to rust and
[1:00:02] grow tomorrow
[1:00:03] what would this world be like
[1:00:06] what would this country be like
[1:00:08] if the people if they took every dollar
[1:00:12] they put into that
[1:00:13] and put it towards christ what would it
[1:00:15] be
[1:00:16] and they worry about all the other
[1:00:18] things going and they said well we need
[1:00:19] to fix that we need to fix this
[1:00:23] and yet they got people sold out to that
[1:00:27] willing
[1:00:28] to sell themselves out to that thing
[1:00:30] just to win a little bit of money
[1:00:32] why it just made me think what a what a
[1:00:35] crazy thing it is
[1:00:36] to be willing
[1:00:38] someone willing to do it
[1:00:40] moses oh he had objections sure moses
[1:00:44] had objections
[1:00:45] but he was willing to do it jonah had
[1:00:48] objections but he was willing to do it
[1:00:50] mary had objections but she was willing
[1:00:53] to do it jeremiah had objections but he
[1:00:56] was willing
[1:00:58] elijah had tons of
[1:01:00] of objections but he was willing to do
[1:01:03] it
[1:01:04] brother branham had objections
[1:01:06] do you know that
[1:01:07] you know his life story i'm sure most of
[1:01:09] you do you know his life story he had
[1:01:12] plenty of objections but he was willing
[1:01:14] to do it
[1:01:15] amen now
[1:01:18] it cost him some things like his wife
[1:01:20] his baby
[1:01:22] to mold him into that position just like
[1:01:25] brother graham talked about moses he had
[1:01:27] to crush him and smush him and crash him
[1:01:30] out well
[1:01:32] jesus went through the same thing
[1:01:34] so he
[1:01:36] he didn't expect anything of us if he
[1:01:38] didn't do himself
[1:01:41] amen but he was willing to do it amen
[1:01:44] willing to do it that's the main thing
[1:01:46] he was willing to do it james let's go
[1:01:48] over to james chapter one
[1:01:58] james chapter 1.
[1:02:00] now the whole point of this now this
[1:02:02] morning is
[1:02:03] to help us
[1:02:04] understand are are we
[1:02:07] so in love with christ
[1:02:10] so in love with him that we're willing
[1:02:13] to do whatever he asks of us
[1:02:16] whatever he wants us to do in life
[1:02:19] whatever he calls for us to do
[1:02:22] whether it's
[1:02:23] moving around the world or maybe it's
[1:02:25] something simple as going and talking to
[1:02:27] someone that you really don't want to
[1:02:29] talk to
[1:02:31] sitting down next to somebody who is
[1:02:35] somebody you really don't want to
[1:02:36] associate with or be seen with or you
[1:02:39] never know
[1:02:40] i mean i'll just be honest with you
[1:02:42] i i don't i don't entirely know
[1:02:46] why the lord has me on this job but i
[1:02:48] think about it a lot
[1:02:50] and i think maybe
[1:02:51] that one of my chris somebody i'm
[1:02:53] supposed to witness to
[1:02:55] and then you hear somebody that says oh
[1:02:56] i go to a non-denomination church and i
[1:02:59] love it you think oh maybe that's the
[1:03:01] guy
[1:03:02] and then you steer clear of the
[1:03:05] the other older curmudgeon
[1:03:08] guy
[1:03:09] uh
[1:03:10] surely it's not him
[1:03:12] but you don't know
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:14] because that was my attitude i didn't
[1:03:16] actively think that but that was my
[1:03:18] attitude i kind of you know
[1:03:23] and then the lord reminded me
[1:03:25] it could be this
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:29] lord
[1:03:30] so the question then to me was are you
[1:03:32] willing to do it
[1:03:34] are you willing to sit down with him are
[1:03:36] you willing to talk to him are you
[1:03:37] willing to open a conversation are you
[1:03:39] willing to engage him to the point that
[1:03:41] there will be a conversation about me
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] that's you gotta you
[1:03:48] you gotta die to yourself at that point
[1:03:50] and say lord i i'm willing to do it
[1:03:53] whatever it is lord you just help me you
[1:03:55] just show me and then somebody that uh
[1:03:59] you know that
[1:04:01] uh that you wouldn't typically normally
[1:04:03] go to a friendly open conversation kind
[1:04:06] of thing you can stand there and ask a
[1:04:08] question you know like he basically
[1:04:09] ignored you
[1:04:11] didn't hear
[1:04:12] and and my wife said maybe he didn't
[1:04:15] i know he did
[1:04:17] but it's just that kind of guy it's not
[1:04:20] it's not personal but that's just the
[1:04:22] way it is you think you know
[1:04:24] why
[1:04:24] talk but there's a reason
[1:04:27] there's always a reason
[1:04:30] we just got to find what that reason is
[1:04:31] and be willing to do it whatever it is
[1:04:34] amen may not be easy but if god sent you
[1:04:37] to do something he's going to be with
[1:04:39] you
[1:04:41] amen james chapter 1 uh verse 22
[1:04:46] be
[1:04:48] doers
[1:04:49] of the word
[1:04:51] not just hearers only deceiving your own
[1:04:53] selves for if any man be a hearer of the
[1:04:56] word and not a doer he is likened to a
[1:04:58] man but holding his natural face in a
[1:05:00] glass
[1:05:01] for he beholdeth himself in other words
[1:05:03] he's it's just a facade
[1:05:05] and that's all it is it's a reflection
[1:05:07] of facade
[1:05:08] there's nothing real to it you're just
[1:05:10] looking at a mirror
[1:05:12] you see to look in the mirror in the
[1:05:13] face for he beholdeth himself and he
[1:05:16] goeth his way and straightway forgetteth
[1:05:18] what manner of man he was
[1:05:20] but who so looketh into the perfect law
[1:05:22] of liberty and continueth therein
[1:05:25] he being not a forgivable hearer but a
[1:05:28] doer of the work this man shall be
[1:05:31] blessed
[1:05:32] blessed in his deed
[1:05:34] amen so a person that is willing to do
[1:05:39] not just here
[1:05:41] which it seems like a lot of
[1:05:43] christianity has come to go to church
[1:05:46] and do my penance or whatever it is that
[1:05:48] they consider that that makes them a
[1:05:51] christian and they and they then they
[1:05:53] become basically hearers and not doers
[1:05:55] of the word
[1:05:57] they're not here in their in their human
[1:06:00] capacity to fulfill the word of god
[1:06:02] which is whatever the purpose of god is
[1:06:04] in your life that's the fulfilling of
[1:06:06] the word of god it's just being here
[1:06:09] it's just doing all i'll just do this
[1:06:11] and i'll just do that or
[1:06:12] and or i'll just come to church i'll sit
[1:06:15] there i'll be faithful and but but if
[1:06:19] serving god is outside of this room amen
[1:06:23] serving god takes us outside of this
[1:06:26] room and puts us in life that makes us
[1:06:29] doers
[1:06:30] that makes us fulfill the word of god to
[1:06:34] live the word of god
[1:06:35] not just let the word live through you
[1:06:38] but live the word
[1:06:40] amen let that word
[1:06:42] be who you are so that it is living
[1:06:45] through you
[1:06:46] amen i know sometimes in the scripture
[1:06:49] says that the spirit is willing but the
[1:06:51] flesh is weak
[1:06:53] but sometimes we just got to overcome
[1:06:54] the flesh
[1:06:56] get past the flesh
[1:07:00] stronger than the flesh
[1:07:03] amen that takes prayer and fasting
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:08] fasting will help you overcome your
[1:07:10] flesh quicker and better than anything
[1:07:12] that i know of personally and i just
[1:07:14] tell you that from practical experience
[1:07:16] in my own life
[1:07:18] and then people sometimes even my wife
[1:07:20] looks i don't know how you can go so
[1:07:22] long without eating i conditioned my
[1:07:24] body
[1:07:25] i told my body you're not going to have
[1:07:27] food until i tell you
[1:07:29] that's right
[1:07:30] and my body learned that it didn't have
[1:07:33] to have
[1:07:34] so much food at such a certain time
[1:07:38] and it's trained to say and some people
[1:07:40] say well that's why you stay so skinny
[1:07:42] though that's not the point of it the
[1:07:44] point is not to not eat the point is to
[1:07:46] obey the lord
[1:07:48] the point is to allow even your flesh to
[1:07:51] be subject to christ in his word and the
[1:07:54] movement of the spirit
[1:07:56] when you've got your flesh obeying
[1:07:59] everything else including food
[1:08:01] when you got your flesh obeying
[1:08:03] everything else then how does it obey
[1:08:05] god
[1:08:07] no god has to be first amen god has to
[1:08:11] be first god is first in your life
[1:08:13] before food or water
[1:08:16] amen yes amen
[1:08:19] could not god created this could he not
[1:08:22] do with his he will
[1:08:24] amen i mean he's brought
[1:08:27] friend god has brought water to a man
[1:08:30] out of the dried up jawbone of a of an
[1:08:33] ass
[1:08:36] well if he can do that then can't he
[1:08:38] give you whatever you need
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:41] oh my
[1:08:43] praise the lord
[1:08:45] he's give a prophets in the bible
[1:08:49] cakes for angels
[1:08:51] yes
[1:08:52] he
[1:08:53] he's he's
[1:08:54] fed men in the bible uh
[1:08:58] food from animals that would bring them
[1:09:00] food
[1:09:03] god can do anything he wants
[1:09:06] he can drive up or he can bring it forth
[1:09:09] whatever your desire is
[1:09:12] but it comes a time where
[1:09:14] our lives have to obey that word
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:19] and be willing to allow god to to use it
[1:09:22] in a way that
[1:09:24] in in the things that we are to do
[1:09:26] come by prayer and fasting
[1:09:29] prayer talking to the lord and fasting
[1:09:31] not praying fast
[1:09:33] but prayer and fasting
[1:09:36] amen you probably all know
[1:09:39] this is just a commitment i made many
[1:09:41] many years ago to the lord i never eat
[1:09:43] on sunday morning whether i'm preaching
[1:09:45] or not
[1:09:46] whether i'm going to church or not which
[1:09:49] i we may one sunday a year maybe we're
[1:09:52] not in church uh but that's extremely
[1:09:55] rare i i don't i don't that's my
[1:09:58] commitment to the lord
[1:10:02] everybody's different you can do what
[1:10:04] you want but it's an important part of
[1:10:05] your life
[1:10:07] it's an important part of your spiritual
[1:10:08] life let's put it that way amen now
[1:10:11] let's go over to a couple more
[1:10:13] scriptures i've got we'll close here in
[1:10:15] a minute first peter chapter 5
[1:10:20] first peter chapter 5
[1:10:22] while you're turning there i'll just
[1:10:23] read this to you
[1:10:26] another quote of god acts of the holy of
[1:10:29] the holy spirit 1954
[1:10:32] uh when a man's ever born truly listen
[1:10:35] to this now
[1:10:36] this this this transcends a confession
[1:10:40] this transcends a repentance this
[1:10:42] transcends a baptism
[1:10:45] this is a person truly born born again
[1:10:49] of the spirit of god
[1:10:51] okay so
[1:10:52] now that that groundwork has been laid
[1:10:54] truly born of the spirit of god and from
[1:10:57] the crown of his head to the ends of his
[1:11:00] toenails
[1:11:01] he's been changed by the resurrection
[1:11:03] power of the lord jesus christ
[1:11:06] and his own selfish ideas have faded
[1:11:09] away
[1:11:10] god has got complete control of that man
[1:11:15] person individual
[1:11:17] humanity
[1:11:18] amen god has got complete control at
[1:11:22] that point relinquished from the crown
[1:11:25] of his head
[1:11:26] to the point of his toenails god has got
[1:11:29] complete control over that man he will
[1:11:32] believe every written word of the lord
[1:11:34] jesus christ and practice
[1:11:37] practice not just years but doers of the
[1:11:41] word practice that word
[1:11:44] put that word to life
[1:11:46] let that word walk in shoe leather again
[1:11:49] today
[1:11:50] through you
[1:11:52] amen not just words but deeds
[1:11:56] the word of christ
[1:11:58] practice that the same the word of
[1:12:00] christ upon this rock i will build my
[1:12:03] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:12:05] prevail against it amen that would make
[1:12:07] you feel uh that would make you feel
[1:12:10] religious wouldn't
[1:12:12] this is the stone that was said at night
[1:12:14] of you builders neither is there
[1:12:16] salvation in any other name than the
[1:12:18] name of the lord jesus and the bible
[1:12:20] said here that they those disciples
[1:12:24] they perceived that they were ignorant
[1:12:27] and unlearned
[1:12:29] but there was one thing they did have
[1:12:32] they might have been ignorant they might
[1:12:34] have been unlearned
[1:12:35] but there was one thing that those
[1:12:38] disciples that god chose had
[1:12:41] one thing in common
[1:12:44] every one of them when he called
[1:12:46] was willing to follow him
[1:12:48] they were willing to go that's the one
[1:12:50] thing they had may have been ignored and
[1:12:52] unlearned they may not know nothing
[1:12:55] outside of fishing
[1:12:57] but they were willing
[1:12:59] they were willing to leave father mother
[1:13:01] they were willing to whatever it cost
[1:13:03] them they were willing to do it that's
[1:13:05] the one thing they had you might not
[1:13:07] have had an education they might not
[1:13:08] have had degrees plastered their wall
[1:13:10] they might have had a doctor of divinity
[1:13:12] of any kind but they were willing to go
[1:13:15] and look what god did through their
[1:13:17] lives
[1:13:18] they didn't have they didn't go to
[1:13:19] seminaries
[1:13:21] they didn't have any great degrees of
[1:13:23] taught by uh
[1:13:25] uh theologians the scripture
[1:13:29] they were they just followed with christ
[1:13:31] they learned the lessons from him
[1:13:34] they got filled with the holy spirit and
[1:13:36] they wrote a book of acts
[1:13:39] praise the lord
[1:13:40] simply because they were willing
[1:13:44] they were willing
[1:13:45] willing subjects willing for god to use
[1:13:48] them
[1:13:49] praise the lord first peter now
[1:13:53] chapter five verse one and two
[1:13:55] the elders which are among you i exhort
[1:13:58] whom i'm also an elder and a witness of
[1:14:00] the sufferings of christ also a partaker
[1:14:02] of the glory that shall be revealed
[1:14:04] feed the flock of god which is among you
[1:14:06] taking the oversight thereof not by
[1:14:09] constraint i think we read this
[1:14:10] scripture here a few weeks ago we're
[1:14:12] talking about willing amen
[1:14:15] feed the flock of god which is among you
[1:14:17] taking the oversight thereof not by
[1:14:19] constraint
[1:14:21] but willingly not for filthy lucr but
[1:14:23] for a ready mind
[1:14:25] be willing not by constraint in other
[1:14:28] words again god is not looking for
[1:14:31] someone who he has to force to do
[1:14:33] something
[1:14:34] he's not looking for someone he's having
[1:14:36] to make do it he wants someone who is
[1:14:39] willing to do it with a willing heart
[1:14:41] with a willing mind
[1:14:43] that's the person that god's looking for
[1:14:45] are you willing to do it
[1:14:48] if you're willing to do it that doesn't
[1:14:50] mean god's going to call you to do it
[1:14:52] but if you're willing to do it he's got
[1:14:54] someone he can use he's got someone he
[1:14:57] can mold he can shape
[1:14:59] he can do something with
[1:15:01] he can get something accomplished
[1:15:03] it's hard to get some it's hard to get
[1:15:06] just think of this naturally
[1:15:08] if you're going on like sort of like a
[1:15:10] like with brother roger or a job i'm
[1:15:12] doing now or something like that or just
[1:15:15] an office worker
[1:15:17] or or whatever
[1:15:19] if you're going to a job
[1:15:22] and and you walk in and you say
[1:15:24] and and the job calls for you to do this
[1:15:26] this and this and you're like well i'm
[1:15:28] not going to do that i'm going to do
[1:15:29] this this and this
[1:15:31] well you're no good to those people
[1:15:34] they want you to do it the way they tell
[1:15:36] you to do it
[1:15:37] they want you to do it according to
[1:15:39] whatever their blueprint or whatever
[1:15:41] their uh uh
[1:15:44] order procedure is
[1:15:47] they want you to do it like that
[1:15:50] and so many people today
[1:15:52] god might call a person that they want
[1:15:54] to do things their own way god's not
[1:15:56] looking for somebody who wants to do
[1:15:58] their own way he's looking for somebody
[1:16:00] who wants to do it his way
[1:16:03] and to do that you have to die to
[1:16:05] yourself
[1:16:06] right you have to die to your thoughts
[1:16:08] you have to die of your opinions you
[1:16:09] have to die to your knowledge you have
[1:16:11] to die
[1:16:12] that that's like brother branham talked
[1:16:14] about it he said
[1:16:16] i i i have i have no gift but one gift
[1:16:20] and that's to yield myself to him
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:24] you watch videos and listen to tapes and
[1:16:27] he stands up and says i take control
[1:16:30] over authority over every spirit in here
[1:16:32] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:16:34] glory of god right
[1:16:35] brother branham has no authority to
[1:16:37] speak like that
[1:16:40] but the god that was speaking through
[1:16:41] him does
[1:16:43] the person that was willing to stand
[1:16:45] there as a subject of jesus christ and
[1:16:48] speak the authority of god right there
[1:16:51] and i guarantee you every demon in that
[1:16:53] place was shaken in their boots
[1:16:55] they had to obey that voice because they
[1:16:58] saw something other than just a man a
[1:17:00] little five foot nine bald man standing
[1:17:02] there and saying well i think i'll just
[1:17:04] say this no no no he said it because he
[1:17:06] was willing and god backed him up and
[1:17:08] spoke through him those words
[1:17:11] and when that authority came through
[1:17:13] those demons had to go
[1:17:15] they had to obey
[1:17:17] and they did
[1:17:18] amen they did
[1:17:20] praise the lord one more
[1:17:22] scripture
[1:17:23] i'll read to you here
[1:17:26] ii corinthians chapter 8.
[1:17:30] second corinthians chapter eight i'll
[1:17:32] turn here we'll close in just a minute
[1:17:39] you must have faith in what you're doing
[1:17:42] if you don't have faith in what you're
[1:17:43] doing and then you're not going to do a
[1:17:45] good job
[1:17:47] you're not going to be able to fulfill
[1:17:48] that purpose
[1:17:50] correctly appropriately unless you have
[1:17:52] faith in what you're doing
[1:17:55] i i know i've
[1:17:57] you know when somebody has their own
[1:17:59] thought or idea of something
[1:18:01] um
[1:18:02] in the natural
[1:18:04] maybe you do have a better way of doing
[1:18:05] something
[1:18:06] um
[1:18:08] it just came to my mind this this past
[1:18:11] week uh
[1:18:13] stuff was there was a lot of stuff done
[1:18:15] wrong there was a lot of stuff that
[1:18:16] wasn't done uh done at all
[1:18:19] and we had to go in and fix everything
[1:18:21] and then do all the other stuff that
[1:18:23] needed to be done
[1:18:24] and nobody had made provision for this
[1:18:28] horn outside to to go off there was no
[1:18:31] power to it the thing was just sitting
[1:18:33] on the wall and nobody no other group no
[1:18:36] none of the other crews come in and made
[1:18:38] provision to get power to that thing and
[1:18:41] that and it has to go off if you've ever
[1:18:42] gone into mr carwash and makes this big
[1:18:45] loud horn sound
[1:18:48] has to be wired up
[1:18:50] so then it has to be uh
[1:18:52] it has to be
[1:18:54] fixed to where it can work and work
[1:18:56] properly there's got to be power go to
[1:18:58] it or it's not going to work
[1:19:00] so he figured out a way to get it from
[1:19:02] this box go up the wall go around this
[1:19:04] way go out the hole and go into the
[1:19:06] thing so the
[1:19:08] head of the crew came to me and says i
[1:19:11] got a project for you i want you to do
[1:19:12] this
[1:19:13] i said okay
[1:19:14] and the guy that had
[1:19:17] been electrician for years and been on
[1:19:19] that job for years and or a while anyway
[1:19:22] i don't know if it's years but
[1:19:24] the older fellow he came and said well
[1:19:26] we do this this this and this i said
[1:19:30] no i said you know why do you want to do
[1:19:33] all this just cut that right there and
[1:19:35] pull this over here and then attach it
[1:19:38] well what do you do here and here and
[1:19:39] that's it
[1:19:40] don't worry about it he just told me to
[1:19:42] do it so i did it and fixed it and
[1:19:43] worked it during something i've done
[1:19:46] roger showed me the trick years ago of
[1:19:48] how you can do something and fix it
[1:19:49] right so there is in the natural uh
[1:19:54] sometimes better ideas
[1:19:56] the ways of doing things
[1:19:58] and but with god
[1:20:00] his idea is perfect
[1:20:02] his idea is right
[1:20:04] his idea cannot fail and we subject
[1:20:07] ourselves to that idea if we come to god
[1:20:10] with that same attitude that i came to
[1:20:12] him and he was kind of mad at me for
[1:20:14] that but i i mean what could i do i
[1:20:16] wasn't i wasn't going to do it his way
[1:20:18] that was going to create such a problem
[1:20:21] and i just wasn't going to do it like
[1:20:22] that
[1:20:23] but if we do that with god it doesn't we
[1:20:27] can't it doesn't work
[1:20:29] because
[1:20:30] there is no better way there is no
[1:20:33] better idea than what his is so when he
[1:20:35] has to do something we just say yes yes
[1:20:38] lord yes
[1:20:40] i'll do that
[1:20:42] amen i'll do it but you've got to have
[1:20:44] faith in what you're doing see if i had
[1:20:46] done it the way that man had told me if
[1:20:48] i didn't know better from working with
[1:20:50] brother roger i hadn't just done it this
[1:20:52] way i
[1:20:53] but if i had tried to do that knowing
[1:20:55] there was a better way of doing it i
[1:20:57] would have not had faith in doing it
[1:20:58] that way i'd have probably messed
[1:21:00] everything up because i would had no
[1:21:02] faith in doing it like that because i
[1:21:04] knew there's a better way of doing it
[1:21:06] but when you know what god shows you to
[1:21:09] do there's not a better way of doing it
[1:21:11] than what god has told you to do you can
[1:21:13] have faith in it
[1:21:15] and believe that it's gonna work out
[1:21:17] exactly perfect the way it's supposed to
[1:21:20] because it's his way not my way his way
[1:21:23] amen you gotta you must have faith in
[1:21:26] what you're doing
[1:21:27] praise the lord now
[1:21:29] uh i just turned second corinthians
[1:21:31] chapter eight verse one
[1:21:34] it says moreover brother
[1:21:37] we do you
[1:21:39] to the wit of the grace of god bestowed
[1:21:41] on the churches of macedonia
[1:21:43] how that in a great trial of affliction
[1:21:46] the abundance of their joys and their
[1:21:48] deep poverty abounded in unto the riches
[1:21:51] of their liberality
[1:21:53] liberality
[1:21:55] for to their power i bear record yea and
[1:21:58] beyond their power that they were
[1:22:00] willing of themselves willing of
[1:22:02] themselves you know
[1:22:04] praying us
[1:22:06] uh with much entreaty that we would
[1:22:08] receive the gift and take upon us the
[1:22:10] fellowship of the ministering to the
[1:22:13] saints and this they did not as we hoped
[1:22:17] but first gave their own selves to the
[1:22:19] lord and unto us by the will of god
[1:22:23] because they were willing
[1:22:25] see that instruments that we desire
[1:22:27] titus
[1:22:28] that has he begun so he would also
[1:22:31] finish in the same uh in you the same
[1:22:34] grace also therefore as ye abound in
[1:22:38] everything in faith and utterance
[1:22:40] knowledge and in all diligence in your
[1:22:42] love to us see that ye abound in this
[1:22:44] grace also i speak not by commandment
[1:22:47] but by occasion of the forwardness of
[1:22:50] others and to prove the sincerity of
[1:22:52] their love for ye know the grace of your
[1:22:55] lord jesus christ that through that
[1:22:57] though he was rich yet for your sakes he
[1:23:00] became poor that ye might
[1:23:03] that ye through his poverty might be
[1:23:05] rich
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:08] herein i give my advice
[1:23:10] for this is expedient for you who had
[1:23:13] begun before not only to do but also to
[1:23:15] be
[1:23:16] forward a year ago now
[1:23:18] therefore perform the doing of it and as
[1:23:22] there was a readiness to will so there
[1:23:25] may be a performance also
[1:23:28] out of that which ye have
[1:23:30] for if uh if there be a willing mind it
[1:23:34] is accepted according to that man hath
[1:23:37] and not according to he hath none
[1:23:40] for i mean not but
[1:23:42] that other men be erased and ye burdened
[1:23:45] or eased and ye burned
[1:23:47] but
[1:23:48] by an equality that now at this time
[1:23:51] your abundance may be a supply for their
[1:23:54] one that their abundance also may be a
[1:23:58] supply for your want that there may be
[1:24:01] equality as it is written he that had
[1:24:04] gathered much have nothing over he that
[1:24:08] had gathered little has no lack but it
[1:24:11] doesn't work unless you have people that
[1:24:14] are willing they have to desire and be
[1:24:18] willing to allow themselves to become
[1:24:22] one together
[1:24:23] and we become one together as we become
[1:24:26] one with him
[1:24:28] and this
[1:24:29] works in the mind of god in the
[1:24:31] operation of god as we come together as
[1:24:34] one in him
[1:24:36] and we see each other that way and then
[1:24:38] god's entire family is taken care of
[1:24:43] his entire family all of us everybody's
[1:24:46] taken care of god's give different gifts
[1:24:48] to different people he's give different
[1:24:51] uh abilities to different people and
[1:24:54] some
[1:24:55] have more than others
[1:24:58] some have abundance
[1:24:59] some have very little
[1:25:02] but when god allows to move upon our
[1:25:04] hearts
[1:25:06] has god ever moved you to
[1:25:07] to just give something to somebody just
[1:25:10] for no reason
[1:25:11] you don't even know why
[1:25:14] maybe
[1:25:15] a hundred dollar bill or
[1:25:16] uh take them something they might need
[1:25:18] or uh some food or something
[1:25:22] i know i've heard stories have had the
[1:25:23] lord move on me before but i've heard
[1:25:26] stories too
[1:25:27] that
[1:25:28] that people are just out of food
[1:25:30] and somebody come and say the lord just
[1:25:32] told me to
[1:25:33] to bring you this food
[1:25:36] well thank you because we had nothing
[1:25:39] but he had to find somebody willing to
[1:25:41] do it right
[1:25:43] somebody willing to take food off their
[1:25:46] own table and give it to somebody else
[1:25:49] take a little money out of their pocket
[1:25:51] and give it to somebody else
[1:25:53] god's just looking for the person that's
[1:25:55] willing that's what this whole system
[1:25:57] was about and how it was supposed to
[1:25:59] work
[1:26:01] you saw the days of ananias and sapphira
[1:26:04] i mean and
[1:26:07] he held back a portion of what they had
[1:26:09] sold oh we we're selling all this out
[1:26:12] and but you know we got to keep a little
[1:26:14] bit of it back
[1:26:16] well that was so displeasing but the
[1:26:18] holy ghost when they came and lied to
[1:26:20] the spirit of god through peter the man
[1:26:23] dropped dead then the woman dropped dead
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:29] god's trying to find somebody who is
[1:26:31] willing to
[1:26:33] want to do it have the faith in doing it
[1:26:36] that's my point
[1:26:38] and i said fire did not have the faith
[1:26:41] in doing what this was that was called
[1:26:44] of them to do
[1:26:45] and because they didn't have the faith
[1:26:47] in it to do it
[1:26:49] they didn't do it
[1:26:50] they secretly or they tried to secretly
[1:26:52] you don't have people trying to secretly
[1:26:54] do stuff knowing that you can do nothing
[1:26:57] secretly with god
[1:26:58] right you do know that right
[1:27:00] you can't do anything in secret
[1:27:03] you know well i can say this or i can
[1:27:04] lie about that or i can do you can't do
[1:27:07] anything that god doesn't know
[1:27:09] so you know there's nothing in secret so
[1:27:11] they're secretly trying to hold back
[1:27:13] that just shows a lack of faith right
[1:27:15] there but they didn't have faith in the
[1:27:16] system they tried to subvert the system
[1:27:18] and hold some back and they were
[1:27:20] accountable to god for it
[1:27:22] came before peter the man dropped dead
[1:27:25] they wound him up took him out his wife
[1:27:26] came in and she conspired the same thing
[1:27:28] and the same ones that took her out and
[1:27:30] took him out took her out
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] unwilling to do it
[1:27:37] this quote god's only provided place of
[1:27:39] worship
[1:27:41] listen now because this is where this is
[1:27:43] what it comes down to
[1:27:45] because we know
[1:27:47] before this quote we know that
[1:27:50] the scriptures
[1:27:52] in
[1:27:54] corinthians
[1:27:57] gives us all the gifts of the spirit
[1:28:00] and
[1:28:01] of all the gifts of the spirit everybody
[1:28:03] seems to enjoy the
[1:28:05] prophecy or the speaking in tongues or
[1:28:08] the things that's kind of the outward
[1:28:10] things that everybody sees and marvels
[1:28:13] at and acknowledges oh what great gifts
[1:28:15] and the miracles and the healings and
[1:28:18] and those things
[1:28:20] even like in brother branham's ministry
[1:28:22] how many times you hear the majoring of
[1:28:24] those things and the healings and the
[1:28:26] miracles and a lot of the things that
[1:28:28] brother branham did for people that went
[1:28:30] under the radar that a lot of people
[1:28:31] never heard of or knew about
[1:28:34] just
[1:28:35] helping
[1:28:37] just being there
[1:28:39] just giving a little something
[1:28:41] there's a gift
[1:28:43] there there is a gift of the spirit that
[1:28:45] a lot of people forget first corinthians
[1:28:47] 12
[1:28:48] that's a gift of helps
[1:28:51] yes i don't i i would say there's
[1:28:53] probably a large amount of people
[1:28:55] in christian life that don't even know
[1:28:58] that right that don't even know there's
[1:29:00] a gift of helps
[1:29:02] of just being a help
[1:29:04] just being there for people
[1:29:06] just being given a bed to sleep in give
[1:29:10] him a meal
[1:29:11] give him a ride
[1:29:13] give him a few bucks whatever it is
[1:29:15] help just be there to help somebody just
[1:29:18] be there to help people
[1:29:20] amen
[1:29:22] a lot of people forget that
[1:29:24] i believe brother branham had that very
[1:29:27] uh
[1:29:28] abundantly
[1:29:30] but you always hear about all the other
[1:29:32] stuff
[1:29:33] and the things of just the helps of the
[1:29:35] things that we're doing you hardly ever
[1:29:37] hear anything about those things but
[1:29:38] it's just as important
[1:29:40] yes it's just as important to god the
[1:29:42] gift the gifts of helps is just as
[1:29:45] important as the gift of healing
[1:29:47] or the gifted discernment or the gift of
[1:29:50] prophecy or whatever the gift of helps
[1:29:52] is just as important
[1:29:54] look
[1:29:55] now this is the placing of it as i close
[1:29:57] here only god's only provided place of
[1:30:00] worship he said it's your love
[1:30:03] to god
[1:30:05] amen
[1:30:06] it's your love
[1:30:08] to god
[1:30:10] praise the lord what is our love to the
[1:30:12] lord
