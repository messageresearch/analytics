because this is our Thanksgiving season amen praise the Lord time of testimony and Thanksgiving to God I just want to thank God for um I'm 76 this year and somewhere around the time I was six or seven my parents were driving my father was a salesperson and he was on the road and it was late at night far between the cities of the Midwest and there was we were hungry and tired with two little kids and um and must about six six or S and um all of a sudden um they find a place to eat in as little as I was it sticks in my mind it was about 9:30 at night and my father we all went in and it was um there was pasta and that kind of thing you could order some some for some reason I remember the spaghetti I had a spaghetti dinner and I was so tired I slumped over I couldn't eat I couldn't sit up in my chair hardly and my father looked over at me and he said honey he's so hurt in he didn't plan this he didn't he realized I was so tired that I and I was just too tired to eat and he just looked at me and he said honey I pleas e and something inside just rose up and I didn't want to um I didn't want to U uh let his will overtake mine it just felt like an invasion I was tired I was and I slumped over and I've been slumped over since then well it's been about 50 years and I was thinking wow I'll I'll get to that this week the Lord showed me the secret to standing up straight muscles that I have found from time to time that I forget they're there and the Lord has shown me where they are and how to use them and I have been just jubilating because now it it's been it goes it's affected me clear down into my legs and I realize that that I had to stretch out my legs too whole of my body has been just all shriveled up and so I've had to walk and stretch those out and God is showing me and I just walking and it's getting easier and easier every day as those muscles get stronger and stronger and get stretched out and I am just on cloud nine amen and this is and I think this is the 50th year which that's a jubilee year amen so um and I have some more but I want to pass you know if anybody else has I want to praise the Lord for my help amen I what God has done for me my love amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus I am allergic to my new dog but I'm going to claim victory over the AL amen not yet he can make new LS he can make a new he can take away this simple all the praise and all the glory yes amen prise Lord amen thank goodness raise this praise the Lord um just like our pastor just said it's the grace of God God has allowed us and open our hearts and our eyes to the revelation of his word for this day and um we got a lot to be thankful for yes um you know I I mentioned to some of the Brethren uh earlier this week as the Lord should carry the enem is going to fight us it seems like uh I'm young compared to some of you I'm 71 it seems like you know physically some ways I'm falling apart but by the grace of God I trust him yes my knees feeling better almost sliced my thumb off it's it's healing up fine um just you know you we need to trust the Lord and for someone like my brother that last song We sang it was messages of the Prophet yes the spoken word recognizing your day and it's a Honor by the grace of God that he chose us we we know now before the foundation of the world Amen that we were always a part of him yes amen praise the Lord amen yes I'm thankful especially last week I was going to the laundry room and all of a sudden um I don't know what happened but I lost my footing and I was on the ground before I knew it and um I realized I really hurt my left shoulder and my I was happy I at least I didn't hit the ground with my face M but U I'm grateful to God because it could been a lot worse amen and I couldn't even lift my arm last Saturday now that amen praise the Lord but uh it does hurt but I am so grateful that it wasn't even much worse amen yes praise the Lord amen I just want to say how thankful I am great family for how God cares about me so much all the blessings everything it's just amaz see pered amen my life amen praise the Lord anybody else I have my own mic so just quick always thankful for the many gifts that God has given me throughout my life and that I can use it for him and for others and in and at the church and just be a witness and anyone ask you how long you can take be lesson never um and it it always opens doors that otherwise probably wouldn't have been able to be open right amen and just to Echo what everyone else has said just keeping keeping me safe keeping me healthy um I mean flu cold Co it's all been around for years and years and years and the Lord's protected me even when I've been around people who contracted it amen on airplanes and whatever yes keeping me safe driving there's been two fatal accidents on my street this week somehow um and one happened shortly before I arrived there's just so many things that we don't even know or see that the Lord overse just thankful for everything amen praise the Lord so very true never really thought about that I know I've we've always known that's his parents and son that you know it's and him he knows now it's the Lord in his life give that gift to be able to dis playay um but never even thought about that as that being such a witness to people come and say well you know did you take lessons no how'd you learn well the Lord taught me that opens up doors to be able to talk to people about the Lord and uh that you might not normally have except for that so uh I never even saw it that way so amen I I look at this as uh a lot of people a lot of times take a a new year to make New Year's resolutions and that kind of thing but to me uh the Reckoning to to me is this this time of year right now because this is the time as a Christian most nominal people would think you know the year's up January 1 is here and you know it's time to turn over a new leaf and but to me Thanksgiving is that time Thanksgiving is that time that we thank God for what God has done for us and where he's brought us from and what he's brought us through and the thanksgivings of everything that the Lord has done for us for the year that's what this holiday is really supposed to be about brother bam said this is only this is the only true holiday America has left is Thanksgiving and and I believe it's because it goes back to the foundation of our nation and how we were founded and how we were how we how those that came here and started this country were thankful for what the Lord had given them from where they came from to where they were and the the the freedom to worship God the freedom to serve God and live for God and it used to be a time where you could have uh prayer meetings and bible studies in schools uh because people were so thankful it's changed a lot now because it's become more of a freedom from religion than freedom of religion but um I I don't mind being freedom from religion though because it's Jesus Christ not religion that saved me that's right but um it's but this is that time of year for me amen that that time of Reckoning that time of of resolution that time of thankfulness to thank God uh I know we got another little over a month left in our calendar year but again to me this is the time of thankfulness that we have and that's why it means a lot to me um to have uh my family and my friends and people that I know around and and just the warmth of it all to me just creates a whole different type spirit I was listen to a message listening to something brother BR was saying the other day he said uh he was sending greetings and holiday greetings Christmas greetings uh God exactly said he really enjoys that time of year uh where everybody says God bless you and Merry Christmas and uh they're all thankful and they're all happy and they're all uh they're all putting the Lord Jesus in the Forefront uh he said I wish it was that way all year long unfortunately is not but uh that to me is this time of year this this time of thankfulness to to be thankful and to thank God for it amen the things that may have like brother Danny said something that was very immediate uh or something that that has the Lord has done all through the years like uh uh Opening Our Eyes to this truth yes the revelation of God's word bringing us along in him helping us to grow in the Lord and uh all the the healings and the strengthenings and the comforting and the blessings that God's give us um it just uh it just accumulates to the point that it just becomes more uh uh more than a person can handle sometimes or even verbalized uh but we try to do it the best we can fortunately God knows our hearts and as he knows our hearts he knows what's in our hearts and how we feel towards him amen so praise the Lord I uh as as far as giving testimony I can't even begin to think I I I'll have to have a new language before I can start thanking God appropriately uh for what he's done for me so um thank you Lord Jesus biggest thing I can say Amen I'm I'm so thankful uh you know there's this uh article going around this writer uh that is trying to put put a shade on the message try to make it look bad and make it look like a some kind of cult which on the video we are truth of the matter is if you go along the lines of what the government determines as a cult we are a cult uh but so is pretty much every other organization type like it right me if you follow along the guidelines of what they call a cult and you read the Bible you realize Jesus was a cult too uh so I don't necessarily see that uh as the government as the world I guess is painted that as a bad word uh but if you look at the definition it's really just us of likeminded people coming together and worshiping together and and like Precious Faith together Worship the Lord Jesus but in the in the day that we live we can see um uh H how people look at things and when they look at things like this some people read that AR it's like that book that Billy Paul gave that testimony uh of the man who was trying to share the message to another man and he gave him a book and he brought read the book brought the book back and said don't you ever give me anything by that man again he said well what's wrong with he said well that man in that book called me a buzzard and the guy took the book back from me and said well that's funny because the same guy in the same book called me an eagle so some people are going to read those articles and they're going to see oh how horrible and how terrible and and all when I when I look at it uh I say well praise the Lord amen uh because we know all hell is against this teaching right we know that and one of the greatest affirmations I know of that this message is the truth is all the hell that comes against it yes that's one of the best ways you can know if it's of the Devil he's not going to do anything about it he's just going to let it go on I mean you look at the the things that they talk about uh the dress and the the scripture hair and uh how we live our lives and how we conduct ourselves and how we're modest in things and uh and and they put a shadow on that like like that's just that's not that's not right you you you shouldn't live like that and there's religions in this world that uh women can't show any more than their balls they'll get stoned right but yet they come you know why cuz all Hells against this teaching yes and the best one of the greatest uh affirmations I know of is how hard the Devil Comes against this yes that that as much as anything uh almost as much as anything proves to me this is the truth or he wouldn't come against it so hard amen and who knows somebody might read those articles and get curious and come to a church or look it up and say wow I don't know what he's talking about this is the best thing I've ever seen this is wonderful fill the spirit and hear the word and amen cuz if that seed is in there it may be what gets that one last seed praise the Lord anyway that's my thing let's go could we stand to our feet let's go to First Chronicles I do have a little message I want to uh to bring today amen I want to start in 1 Chronicles uh chapter 15 I want to title it being thankful being thankful 1 Chronicles chapter 15 I want to I'm going to read one verse of scripture there um amen 1 Chronicles 15 verse 29 the last verse in the 15th chapter and then we'll go on into the 16th chapter was just going to start with 161 but 29 really paints a picture so but before we read this we just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're very thankful again thankful that is the word Lord yes in our hearts we're thankful to you God we want want to raise our voices we've worshiped you we've praised you we sang the beautiful songs of Zion Lord in worship to you we sang the songs of how thankful we are to you God for what you've done for us what you've given us what you mean to us lord it's beyond comprehension in our human capacity to to begin to approach how much we love you thank you and appreciate what you've done for us Lord the couple of songs that we sang Lord and God just a few samplings of blessings the roof and the shoes and the family and God the blessings you give us Lord God there so many times that people could say that they would go uh one way or the other Lord but I I I prefer to choose to believe the positive yes I don't want to dwell on the negative I don't want to entertain a thought Lord that any of my family would be lost God my thought my belief my faith rests in the truth that Lord you've already saved them before the foundation of the world I believe that I'm going to hold to that positively Lord in the faith that you've given us thank you Lord for the blessings of this place Lord of these people Lord those may be watching today and Lord just all that you've given and done for us we we could go on and on Lord of the things that we could think of uh each one of us Lord probably take a year of the things if we detailed every one of them out of the things that you've done for us and given to us God we thank you Lord today of this word this message of this truth that you've revealed to us opening our eyes to see God this truth the revelation of that truth Lord continue to shine it upon our pathway Lord as we continue to thank you for granting it to us may your Holy Spirit now have complete preeminence in remaining part of this service speak through these lips words you to have us to hear bring encouragement and help to us Lord as we continue to share our thankfulness Lord for you we commit it to you Lord now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen 1 Chronicles chap 15 verse 29 it came to pass as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came to the city of David that Mel the daughter of Saul looking out at a window out of a window saw King David dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart so they brought the Ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God and then David had made an end of and when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the Lord and He dealt to everyone of Israel both man and woman to everyone of uh everyone a loaf of bread a good piece of Flesh and a flagen of wine he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark of the Lord and to record and to thank and to praise the Lord God of Israel Asaf the chief and next to him Zachariah J and shimo moth and jahel and mathani and leab and beniah and OED Edom and JL with salt trees and with Harps but ASF made a sound with symbols sound like a great Revival amen banah also and Je uh jeziel the priests uh with trumpets continually with trumpets continually before the Ark of the Covenant of God then on that day David delivered first this PSAL to thank the Lord into the hand of EZ uh ASF and his Brethren give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye all of his wondrous Works Glory ye in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord and his strength seek his face continually remember His Marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth oh ye seed of Israel Israel his servant ye children of Jacob his chosen ones he he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth be mindful always of his Covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like all this worship all of this praise coming from the Israelites thankful thankful of what God had done it had been the the Ark of the Covenant had been captured by the enemy God gave David leave to go take that uh Ark back it ended up in the house of OED Edom and the house of OED Edom was blessed but now the ark was being returned back to the city of David to its rightful position amen so when David and and the Israelites were worshiping when they were celebrating they were doing it because the the word of God was being restored back to its rightful position to its rightful place David danced before the Lord with all of his might in worship and In Praise because of the thankfulness he had of God bringing that word back god making the way because it's always God Amen God uses us but it's always God that does it amen it's never us we are just the instruments that God uses to bring these things to about but it's God that does it God's Le leadership God's guidance God's provision God's Health God's strength God's blessings are always what is put in place for the things that God wants done to be done and the blessings that God had given them to be able to bring the ark back to where it was supposed to be to bring and restore the word back to its rightful position oh my to think about uh the word being restored to his rightful position how ought we to be a people of C celebration how we ought to be a people of thankfulness of God restoring back to order the word back in its rightful position again they poked at it they proded at it that uh God give a little light here and a little light there down Through the Ages amen and and each reformer that came uh that came up had a little bit of light had a little bit more to shed had a little bit more to share had a little bit more to bring as God revealed it we come up through a state of justification into a state of sanctification into a place of the gifts of the Spirit the Holy Ghost being released upon the people again we come through an Open Door through Philadelphia we come into a place of missionary we came to a time where the word was being spread abroad across the world internationally we came into a time where it came over into this land which at one time wasn't even a land if you notice you see the old Maps back from years ago uh America didn't exist the map was just a map of Israel and what was around it that's all there was that's all men knew but there was a time that came that God unfolded to bring about a time where people would come to this country where men would come with the word of God where they would go up and down Coast to uh uh along the coast uh preaching uh the word of God bringing the good writings of God it was said I think it was um U oh boy I knew I was going to forget his name that that that preached so forcefully he was in Philadelphia one time that he preached so forcefully that people blocks away could hear the message as it was being preached you think the amplification I'm a loud person but I can't imagine my voice amplifying to the place of being able to heard blocks away see that's God bringing that about I got the statistics one time of Charles uh um all the the the reformer uh Charles Charles finny was it Charles finny anyway Road Road his motor Transportation was a horse and I if I remember right the statistics of how many sermons he preached would be the equivalent of like 30 mess mesages a week that he preached in his life over a 50-year period riding on the back of a horse right uh the numbers of times that he spoke and that he preached uh to bring about the the the word to people up and down the country up up and down the coast to bring to people the word of God see it it took that that God God made the way it wasn't those men it was God giving strength it was God giving ability it was God giving away Provisions God is the one that always takes care of it amen God is always if he's got something he wants to get done he brings it about and God made a way to be able to bring this Arc this word back to where it was supposed to be right and all through that time as they poked and proded and brought this word it had to take in this last day that's what makes us understand know as much as anything that this is the last day friend that the last man was not a reformer a prophet a word Prophet Amen to bring a truth of this message of this word to a people we call the message a truth of this word to a people to that that she might take that word and that that word would would clothe her yes and would uh speak to her and reform her and bring her to a place of rapturing faith if rapturing faith is in this message amen then that's what we need yes praise the Lord that's what we need if we're looking to go in a Rapture yes that's what they needed that's what they were looking for David set them aside and he set different men in different positions they played instruments they danced before the Lord they worshiped God they celebrated they praised and gave thanks to the Lord even to the point that David said he delivered his Psalm and he said unto these men write these down Amen to record is what it says to record to make sure that they understand through posterity through years and years thousands of years now that this story will still be told yes of what God did yes and recognize what God still does amen and restoring that word he was thankful they were thankful for the restoration of the word what ought we to be Saints amen we should be thankful for the restoration of the word that God has brought that word back to us amen being thankful sometimes Lord help us we go through life and life hits Us in the face and gives us a broken arm broken leg black eye many times but God always is there with us to help us along nurse back and to bring us along and but through those times sometimes uh we can't lose sight of uh of of the thankfulness that we have towards God for the blessings that he's give us right amen always being thankful never let the thankfulness go away let's go over to St Luke like I said I I I plan on this not being very long today but St Luke chapter 17 St Luke 17:1 story brother Dennis probably I think he mentions this story many times and uh in his prayers he didn't today but he has mentioned this many times and as I was looking things I thought this was this this would be a perfect story let's go over it uh uh St Luke 17:1 it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers which stood AAR off they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show thy so show yourselves unto the priest and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed now that's a kind of an unusual uh way of doing it but God knows exactly how to do it and when to do it and who to do it to and um he didn't tell him to come here he didn't say let me lay hands on you uh he just said just go show yourself to the priest amen amen but as they were walking to go show themselves to the priest that's when they received their healing they received their healing on the journey on the road as they were traveling as they put feet uh footsteps to their to their uh to the to the truth to the to the message to the uh what Jesus told them they put it they put themselves in action amen go and do this now that seems odd some people would probably think that well it's crazy why would I go do that uh I I I want to be relieved of this but they were obedient and they did what he said and as they were going to go show themselves that's when they were cleansed praise the Lord in their Journey on their walk is when they got healed amen yes didn't have to lay hands on didn't have to say thus sayith the Lord didn't say of course it wasn't at a time for it yet but no by your stripes or it it was just go show yourselves to the priest and on their Journey they were healed healing at healing is that simple Saints yes yes you see so many different manifestations of healings in the scripture probably even in our lives that we've seen and have been a part of you look at in the scripture say well why did he do one this way why did he do them this way why did he say this to them why did he take the dirt and put it on his eyes why did some he lay hands on why did one woman get just because she touched the Hem of His G right why did some lay hands why is some walked all around everybody else and went to one person right why did he just tell one your faith has healed you why there it's it's a it's a myriad of of different ways that people gain healing in the scripture it's not God the healing is already there God has already performed it for us now of course after the death burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ We Know by his stripes we are healed it's different when Jesus walked around he was healing amen but now we know see we know that God doesn't changed the healing is already there whatever you have need of is already there it depends on us amen what do we need what does it what does it take for us to be able to get to a place that we're going to believe yes does it take go show the priest does does it take a laying on of hands does it take a a proclamation of a prayer does it take uh a minister does it take a pastor does it take anybody Ley family member anybody coming up and saying I feel inspired to pray for you what does it take whatever it takes to bring that spark of faith for you to receive what you're looking for that's what God instructs us brings us along to do God knew Jesus knew obviously these 10 as they come up and were lepers what he gave them instruction they would do but now the rest of the story is kind of confusing because they were cleansed but only one of them come back to thank him right 15th verse and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God now where were the rest of them right where were the other nine was there a discussion I'm assuming if the 10 were together the 10 were walking together to go to the priest that was Jesus instruction go show yourselves to the priest well if the 10 were together here don't you figure I figured that the 10 were walking together was there a discussion did they all look at each other and they said your leprosy is gone did they look at their hands did they look at their bodies did they look at each other's faces and say wow you're healed you don't have leprosy on your face anymore you don't have oh look at my hands my hands I'm heal we're all healed imagine all 10 of them I would think that all 10 of them were standing there as they got healing glorified was was was was standing there together uh saying we're all healed but only one of them turned around and went back I I did the other nine say hey where you going Bob where you headed that's not a very Jewish name but anyway he was a Samaritan but uh where you going I'm I'm going back to thank the one that we got healing from yeah amen amen did they think it was just a coincidence did they think it was just uh uh something that happened maybe something they ate or drank you know people say well I did go to the doctor the other day they gave me this medicine now I feel better I and dandy but who healed you wasn't the doctorine it wasn't a medicine yeah amen it was God now God may have give does so many times move on men people women like that doctors to have the expertise to be able to help people to be able to prescribe things that uh that may be a a help but God's the Healer great God's the one that has to bring the healing not the medicine not the doctor right was it a coincidence I mean what were they thinking only one of them apparently was thankful for what Jesus had just done for them right only one I mean did the maybe there was an a sour apple in there that saidwell all he did was tell us to go show ourselves to the priest how do we know that's the reason why we got healed I mean we don't we don't know right I do know that it was apparently only one person only one of the men was thankful right because he went back and with a loud voice he glorified God right with a loud voice he praised God and gave God thanks he fell down on his face at Jesus feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan wow where's the other guys amen being thankful right amen sometimes I wonder Saints are we really thankful right every day I know Thanksgiving and I'm up here and the lord gave me songs of thankfulness and Michael was singing playing songs of Thanksgiving and kind of elicit some uh testimonies and things of Thanksgiving and kind of builds up in that mode of being thankful but how about every day right every week all the time of being thankful for God and what God's done amen how many times a day do we thank do we thank God every day right do how many times a day do we thank him do we thank him every week do we thank him every month how often how thankful are we really yes amen see because it can be so easy to slide us back into that that first scripture I read talking about tithe and offering and money in the church that's that first scripture that I read this is it is my strength that got me this wealth it is my ability that got me this wealth it is it is my knowledge it is my expertise it is it is me who got me this we does it go back to that amen I I I can imagine in our human flesh it would be easy to go out and say well yeah wow look what I did no look what God helped achieve through me amen I I I say that several times um uh at work and from from the guys if different things happen say Well thank the Lord amen they're like oh man you were lucky I said no I was blessed yeah yeah amen there's a difference right I've told y'all before I don't even believe in luck I don't think there any such thing as love when you have a god that is orchestrating that is in control of every single facet of everything of everybody's lives animals uh botney life animal life human life inex when God when we know that there's a God that knows it all it's in control of it all How can there be any such thing as luck right right to me there can't be that can't even exist but that's that's what a lot of people say um in in in the in the natural working of Life uh this happened no it didn't that was God right and we should be understanding enough to acknowledge that regularly amen amen especially when you get over 50 you're like thank you Lord for waking me up thank you God that I I see daylight again amen now I know we're all looking to go to a better place but God the the the blessing of life is a great blessing and to be able to have life and to live Our Lives is a great blessing that God gives us amen even sometimes when we do feel like we're breaking down and uh I know brother Dennis got many several years on me but man when my knees were bad and I was just in constant chronic pain from the knees down I felt like I was just falling apart and it's amazing how good you feel when it doesn't feel that way but I'm thankful to God amen amen thankful cuz it's his Blessing is his healing only one came why that's my question why why was there only one Jesus said were there not kin cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger because he was a Samaritan and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith has made thee whole yeah amen now did the other nine lose their healing no I would say that I wouldn't say they lost their healing no Jesus didn't give them their healing just for them to be ungrateful and then not and then lose it God didn't heal them so that they would come and worship him or be thankful right he he he gave them their healing because it's who he is the the worship could come should come as a result of Amen praise the lord it's like is it's like God taking care of of things for us and and the positive that comes from it is a natural result God healing this these men he did because he's God yeah them coming back to thank him would just been a natural result he didn't do it for that but that should have happened the thankfulness that they had amen how about the Lord's blessings on us amen amen how thankful we amen we as humans so many times we focus on the negative and the things that go wrong and the things that are bad instead of focusing on the good things that's another reason I like Thanksgiving Thanksgiving should elicit in us the desire to think on those good things to be thankful for those good things those positive things amen amen like I said uh in my prayer the things that are the things that are positive amen amen um you know I I I choose to believe in the positive yeah amen rather than the negative you say well you know my family could all be lost they could all be saved right you'd rather believe they're all lost or would you'd rather believe they're all saved right i' rather believe I'm going to believe I'm going to have faith to believe in prayer that they're all Sav amen and to me there's no other option that's the way I see it let's go over to Romans chapter 14 I got a couple more scriptures I want to read just the things that of thankfulness Romans 14 let's begin with the sixth verse Romans 14:6 he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and He that regardeth U regardeth not the day to the Lord he doth not regarded he that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks that's why we well not why that's one reason we ask God to bless our food amen and give him thanks not just to ask blessing on it but give him thanks for it yes for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and H and and giveth God thanks praise the Lord see the whole bottom line of it all and giveth God thanks and giveth God thanks he eat it eats to the Lord he doesn't eat it eat it he doesn't eat it to the Lord either way he gives God thanks amen praise the Lord he regardeth the day don't regard a day either way you do it as unto the Lord and give God thanks praise the Lord for none of us live to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords yeah for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living and to God we give thanks irregardless we give God thanks Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians 5:19 Ephesians 5:9 5:19 speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving all things all that we do all that we do we do in word or In Deed we do in the name of Jesus Christ giving him thanks amen giving him thanks all that we do yes we do in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus we do in the name of Jesus but we also as we G as we do we give thanks give thanks giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ first Thessalonians chapter 5 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 being thankful amen being thankful amen 1 Thessalonians 5:116 Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks Amen in everything you know that means the bad things too or what we consider the bad things right you know that also means the bad kinds amen it means like Danny in the situation that he just faced when he fell and got hurt it was a bad situation but he gave thanks to God now people of the world probably don't understand that right they would say why are you giving God thanks for falling and hurting yourself because like he said it could have been so much worse right amen it could have been so much worse wor the things that could have happened here could have put me in the hospital right or or in a splint or cost more money or busted my face or amen it could have been so much worse yeah I'm thankful to God people have asked me of my wife before why do you the Lord took your first son why are you thanking God for that because he knows better than I do right amen I don't understand it may never understand it although we've seen some things that have come from it as a result of it testimonies and such uh because that's like Micah has his music sometimes that happens to me right I don't know about Sonia but I know it happens to me how many children you got well that starts a conversation of talking about the Lord right to me because of that situation now normally if Georgie were here uh i' just well three but since he's gone since he passed uh passed on it opens up a door for me to be able to witness and talk to people about the Lord amen and people look say well how can you give God thanks for that because he gave him to me for a day and a half and I know I'll see him on the other side right amen he's still my son son regardless amen he's still Micah and Tabitha's brother regardless right he's still uh he still Joel Emma and Ruth's Uncle regardless amen amen praise the Lord people look say why you give God glory for that the Bible says in everything in everything we give thanks praise the Lord amen for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you the will of God to give him thanks for everything amen that's the will of God Colossians one more I'm going to close here Colossians chapter 3:1 17 Colossians 317 get the picture here now amen that's the scriptures in all things in everything for every reason for all that he does for in every situation we give thanks to God Amen amen we give thanks we give praise to God Amen our praise is our thanks Colossians 3:17 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus that includes baptism by the way amen those trinitarians or those who don't think that we should baptize in the name of Jesus Amen do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him giving thanks we do all in his name giving thanks yes hopefully that makes a little more sense to understand maybe uh Joel Emma understand why do we why do we pray over our food why do we give God thanks for our food because we do everything in the name of Jesus Christ when we eat we wake up we go to work we come to church whatever we do we do in the name of the Lord Jesus we praise him and give him glory yes because it's only his strength it's only his ability in us that allows us to even wake up or get up amen amen I don't know why my wife this morning uh she said her blood pressure was going up and down and the dizziness and stuff don't know amen but I know who's in control of it right I know who's in charge of it I know who can he is yes praise the Lord amen and I'm thankful for that praise the Lord I was able first time in a long time I was able to play kind of Joel's ball anyway uh we got to play a little ball the other day I could hit and run a little ran little bit I didn't run like I normally would run because they're not 100% healed yet but before I couldn't even have attempted it to move back and forth or or LA or do something like this no way couldn't do it every day healing amen every day thankful yes because every day is a new day of God's blessings praise the lord it's like sister matis said amen one thing and I am thankful for it that the the the rehab place the especially that one that one lady her whole thing was posture make make sure you stand up amen you hunch over you put more pressure on your knees you stand upright you use different muscles more amen amen praise the Lord it all plays it plays its part but regardless of that God has already God healed me and I know right every day amen we give God thanks yes praise the Lord Thanksgiving it's a beautiful time of year I love it gets to the point scripturally where you kind of uh get to a place where it's just like we're thankful what other more scriptures are there to talk about of being thankful there's the whole the whole word is we're thankful for uh but this is the best time I love this time that we're thankful to the Lord and give him thanks being thankful remember to be thankful to the Lord don't be one of the nine amen be that one come back I thank you Lord Jesus amen Dr brother Dennis's doctor appointment Sonia's doctor appointment sister Lydia had her last test this this last week I believe amen the blessings of the Lord yes amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet if we could I enjoyed the testimonies thankfulness yes the praise to the Lord the acknowledgement that it's God that God does it God makes the way for us amen amen from the saving of our souls to showing us his word amen yes praise the Lord so very thankful thank you amen I was going to try to sing a different one but amen want to sing maybe a course of this song a verse of this song again amen before before we sing it God gave me another scripture that um we enter his gates with Thanksgiving and praise in his courts with praise and that to me is my daily reason for giving thanks and praise amen because what can we not do in the presence of God Amen praise the Lord yeah I have read that scripture several times in my Thanksgiving messages I didn't put it in today's message but I have read that scripture many times in my Thanksgiving message and it is very true amen and it is a daily occurrence praise the Lord a lot of people think
