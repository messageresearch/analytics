[38:10] believe god had us here for a purpose
[38:12] right here for a purpose that's right
[38:14] let's find out what god
[38:19] be able to fulfill what god promised
[38:22] yes sir if you have your bibles let's
[38:25] turn to the book of
[38:30] judges and you will be familiar
[38:33] with the judges chapter 16 and then
[38:38] praise god amen
[38:40] and verse
[38:44] 28.
[38:46] he says and samson called unto the lord
[38:49] and said oh lord god
[38:51] remember me
[38:53] i pray thee strengthen me i pray thee
[38:56] only this once oh god that i may be
[38:59] at once revenge of the philistine for my
[39:02] two eyes
[39:04] and
[39:05] if you have
[39:08] uh uh
[39:09] once more
[39:10] brother brahma says here
[39:12] he says but notice samson thought there
[39:16] must be a possibility he caught the idea
[39:20] but
[39:21] the sad part is today the church don't
[39:25] catch that come on they don't realize
[39:27] that there is a possibility of a revival
[39:30] they don't realize the possibility they
[39:33] hadn't caught the vision yet yes they
[39:36] just said
[39:37] let's buy his amen heavenly father we
[39:40] thank you
[39:41] lord god for all the
[39:43] great things that you have done yes yes
[39:45] i pray god that you will move us out the
[39:47] way yes that the holy spirit will have
[39:49] the prayer amen lord we're here tonight

[40:15] service who was that the holy spirit
[40:17] would have the preeminence amen amen
[40:20] amen
[40:21] that testimony years ago and y'all maybe
[40:23] seen it when it was uh i think what the
[40:26] sister joyce was sister fleming was
[40:28] driving anyway and uh y'all know they
[40:30] had the head on accident i'm pretty sure
[40:32] that you i know since the gwen was there
[40:36] in the church the scandal was there in
[40:38] the church what happened and but the
[40:40] testimony was that what what got
[40:43] offered me was
[40:45] they when the police officer came he
[40:47] interviewed a 200 pound man that was in
[40:50] the in the car yeah and there was no men
[40:52] in the car there wasn't nobody but with
[40:55] ladies in the car and the officer
[40:57] interviewed the man and and and talked
[40:59] to him and when he got at the hospital
[41:01] he was
[41:02] interviewing everybody trying to he said
[41:05] that was a 250 pound man i talked to him
[41:08] i wrote it down i got it man and but
[41:10] that man wasn't there you know why
[41:30] let nothing take my fire that god put in
[41:33] me
[41:34] and don't you let nobody take the fire
[41:36] that god put in you samson had a gift to
[41:39] glory and god gave him a gift and that
[41:42] given how many know you have a gift
[41:44] you have to give to the holy ghost amen
[41:46] that the holy ghost is in you and grieve
[41:48] not the holy spirit whereby you're
[41:50] sealed until the day of your redemption
[41:54] amen
[41:55] had a divine gift that was given to him
[41:57] by god and you have the holy ghost that
[41:59] was given to you by god right what that
[42:02] same power the same life the same thing
[42:04] that was in jesus christ as he said a
[42:07] little while the world won't see me but
[42:08] you shall see me for i will be with you
[42:12] even in you know that i think today
[42:14] people in the message has got to a place
[42:16] come on that they so laid back come on
[42:19] back instead of realizing that you have
[42:22] the plan of god a redemption see if it
[42:25] was possible you could write another
[42:27] book of acts
[42:30] [Applause]
[42:39] what they really need and that's god
[42:42] living and
[42:59] [Applause]
[43:11] look at the people i'm getting ahead of
[43:12] myself
[43:13] you know this little pandemic we had
[43:15] come on man
[43:17] it's like if the church is like samson
[43:19] come on don't get quiet
[43:22] with samson i knew god that he had a
[43:25] divine gift that's right everybody knew
[43:27] that god he was a nazi right now i knew
[43:30] that his gift that god gave him no
[43:32] overcomer
[43:33] amen glory but when it happened the
