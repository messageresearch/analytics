TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well welcome back sorry about that anyway continuing on I wanted to monitor our conversation again I've been told by different brothers years ago that unless you pass the plate in church that people wouldn't give and always was against that not necessarily because and not against passing the plate but against that thought process because I always felt like that God's children were there and they were led of God that that they would do what the Bible says and and that's I believe what the Bible does say I tried it and it worked in Florida and I've tried it and it worked here and that being said I appreciate very much you precious Saints there's not a basket or a box or a plate to push around er or pass around or to put anything in but you've driven by our place and we've gone by yours and the mail and different things just to try to make sure that the time is an offering that you have to the Lord that you bring for us and it's rinna it's been a tremendous tremendous blessing and I want to punish you for that that you don't get that just everywhere and it's not something that we talk about it's not something that we push you to or that you have to pledge to you do it up your own free will and then from your heart and that's what the Bible says God rewards you and bless you I told I asked the Lord the other day to return a hundredfold to you for the blessings that you do now it's not your money it's not my money it's God's we just happen to be the stewards that God's Word commands us to be and but I won't admonish you precious godly people you obey the word and God bless you for it so let's just remember these requests now and we'll go to the Lord in prayer pray for the the service now and for these requests as we bow our heads together Lord Jesus father we are indeed grateful today father of your grace and mercy to us for watching over blessing us bringing us to another beautiful Sunday another beautiful resurrection morning Lord where the sson of God has risen in

faith and we thank you God for the faith from the Son of God to deliver us and bring us into your presence god I pray that you would speak to us Lord now and may you minister through your word God into our hearts reveal your word to us once again rich true today as we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen well praise the Lord let's go to our Bibles now we're going to go back over to Romans chapter eight and I want to speak today more along the lines of the process of new birth but I'm going to title it again justification so it's gonna be justification part three but you see it got the board back up here and and all that it goes through but look at the scripture and I believe I had you last week to maybe if you had the time which I'm imagining most of us are a home and I had a little bit of time to listen to the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride if you haven't do I'm gonna go into that a little bit today a little bit more than I did last week so if you want to listen that feel free to do so amen but Romans chapter 8 we just want to read this one verse of scripture again verse 33 it says who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified amen it's God to justify sin so that's the subject we would want to give into today although we're going to go again into more of a whole love of the new birth and and the difference that it makes in our lives of the new birth and the sin and the things that we have in our lives and the things that happen in our lives and and and the process that it goes through and why things are they are when you're born and remember born again or born in sin shaped and equity come in the world speaking lies or being born again of the Spirit of God amen so let's go over to first Peter and I want to begin reading there again read a couple of verses of Scripture from first Peter chapter 1 beginning with verse 22 as a couple of particular points I want to make here today and so we'll get to those and maybe when we get to those particular things I want to point out the other things we just kind of bring along the line to bring us to those points that hopefully would be a help and a blessing to you today first Peter chapter 1 verse 22 says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth so obeying the truth is pure pure ofin to the soul how does that purification come when the Holy Spirit comes in when you obey the word Peter said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the promise that we have obeying that word brings us in personal contact with the Holy Spirit brings that Holy Spirit promise into our lives because we obeyed the word purifying our souls remember our souls first of all were born of a sin nature we're born with a snake nature of the devil in there that the nature the children of Wrath but it purified us when we obeyed the word obeying the word repentance baptism coming into the fulfilling of the Holy Spirit in our lives through the spirit unto unfeigned love now peter mitching of course love or the love without hypocrisy this love is that is the gap a love that's without unfeigned means without hypocrisy it means a true love of this of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently and bourbon is burning with passionate 23rd verse being born again again like I said that's what I want to talk about in the wholeness of this is a new birth being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed remember our first birth was a corrupt seed our new birth is an incorruptible seed the first birth was with the wrong nature the new birth is with the nature of God that seed of God that God planted in there predestined then there before the foundation of the world so not of that incorruptible seed but of in by the Word of God amen remember John 1 says in the beginning was the word the word logos that word logos is the completion of God is the completion of his word is the completion of who he is that logos came out of God and began to create that logos condon send it down into Melchizedek and and and the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud and and come eventually into Jesus Christ and that same one is in us today it's the same it's the word Christ is the word God is the word the man in that word now as we see is uncorruptible is the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever live it than if I because once it's in there it's sealed remember we read Ephesians 1 sealed into your destination right so when you're sealed in there by the Holy Spirit promise of God then you're still there to your eternal destination it abideth forever incorruptible now look how the word puts this well Peter says here Peter says the incorruptible seed a seed what is the seed a seed is a beginning of life seed is is the is the holder of life any seed that come as God had created in the beginning come regardless of what seed it is I'm watching the beautiful birds flying around to help in my backyard and the trees and and the grass and all of those things came from seeds humans we all come from seed there's a seed that comes from somewhere that is predestined foreordained to come to life man talked about that brothers should care and I believe that took him and showed him how the Bulls reproduced and cows and animals reproduced and the eggs and the the sperm and the the reproduction process and but that's it that's that seed that's predestined brother Branham used it it's like a one-in-a-million scenario a thousand a million seeds come out but only one is or day to life there's there's a seed of a tree out there it's if it's put in the right ground in the right atmosphere and given water that seed will will obey the law of God that law of God is it and will reproduce it will come to life so if it's talking about an incorruptible seed is talking about something that has life in it something that is the arbiter the beginning of life it is life itself where did that life come from well if it's incorruptible there's only one place it could come from everything we have in the world everything we look at in our today is corruptible so world would end corruption come from its God so it's a seed of God the incorruptible seed of God that comes and lives with us we're so that new birth now again it says being born again Jesus told Nicodemus lest you be born again you can't even see the kingdom of heaven so beautifu again of incorruptible seed behind the word of God amen that's the word of God now some people believe that you that you don't receive that seed until the word comes in you I am contrary to that a lot of thoughts going through my mind right now I'm not going to say of other things that I've heard that people believe that I just don't see how it works with the word nor do I see how that works with the I know it says here by the Word of God but the truth of it is if that seed wasn't already there for the Spirit to come and strike it then whatever word comes whatever word a person hears is is going to be null and void is that word is going to be no effect it can be the same word that we're reading right now but it's not going to mean anything to those people unless that was already there the predestinated seat of God has always been there the word of God through the Spirit of God just brings life the washing of the water of the word the word through water washing brings life to that scene just like if you water a scene of grass in our apartment's here we got sprinklers out here that's watering the grass out here and it's starting to turn green the sprinklers out in front of our apartment aren't working and all the city all the grass is dying because there's no water so when the water comes in his the seed the seed comes to life not the other way around it's like some people believe you got to get all the attributes of the statue of a perfect man before you get the Holy Ghost well I contend you can't get to those statues unless you have the Holy Ghost it's a new birth Peter didn't say repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission of sin and then establish each one of these steps that you have to follow then you can get the Holy Ghost no no that's not what the Bible says so we got to follow what the Bible says we can't go by Manas ideas or opinions what does the Bible say the Bible says an incorruptible seed by the word I know the word is the seed it's the washing of the water that brings life to that seed to that word amen so listen to this now for all flesh the flesh now is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away just like the flesh just like the man just from the fall of the Garden of Eden each one of us from dust thou art told us that we'll return it's like the grass of the flower of the grass follows the way but the word of the Lord now that word is Rhema that word is not low Goss Rhema is a specific word that's spoken for a specific time specific purpose that is a part of the the logos it came from the logos but it was a specific something spoken of a word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word again that's Rhema which by the gospel is preached to you amen now I can't understand the the preaching why God used the preaching of the word to save souls that's that's God's choice but that word endureth that word of of the gospel that word the Lord which was preached endureth because it reaches a place in you that brings life and and you know what that line comes people say well can you prove it you get it and you won't need proof it once it happens to you you'll know you know you don't have to prove it then people say well how do you know you'll know that then there's hardly any better way to say it well can you scientifically prove it no but what can and can't science prove today there's a lot of things science proof twenty fifteen hundred years ago that they can't prove today or that's contrary today than what they did since can you say it's better than this it's it comes by personal experience so when you know it you have it you don't have to ask that question anymore because you know what's in you you know what you know that it has already been done so that word of the Lord endureth forever and the word of the Lord which by the gospel is preached unto you now I want to read a particular a specific quote here and again like I said from future home if you want to again try to try to if you did in this week listen to future home I believe it would be a blessing to you it's a place where the Brown talks about an eighth day that we got into last week talked about eternity and time rolling over into eternity into the Millennium but it also talks about this which we get into just a little bit here now listen this is from future home look them hands design this for his beloved bride God's hands designed this earth this place for his beloved and bride debt designed in tenderly love for his bride remember that the Holy Ghost the sin descended on Jesus which Jesus was a part of the earth was flesh come and likeness of sinful place he was a part of the earth why'd the German God the life of God was designed in the womb of a woman is that right he says now which it which was the earth she was the earth he was from the earth that flesh was from the earth all right then and the life of God came in so he was the beginning of the creation of God again revelation 3 see and then that blood that blood of God that was there by the germ when it was shed at Calvary dropped back upon the earth for what to redeem the earth now he's talking about and we're entering into this quote reading in the process of the redemption of the earth and when he talks about Christ dying at Calvary and the blood dropping on the earth to redeem the earth he's talking about the the redemption process of the earth that God played just like he does us so the dropping of the blood from Calvary on the earth redeemed the earth it purchased the earth back to himself now now it's justified it's been sanctified called claimed and now it's to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for Jesus now listen that real close we'll get back to that in just a minute cleanse for Jesus and his bride and you are those other parts that's drawn out of this earth you are listen now you are a part of the earth your body do we just talked about flesh we just read the first Peter flesh you are part of the earth your body your soul is part of God an attribute of God displayed here on earth in a body the now that soul that soul is God amen that soul that seed that come forth to bring life and then that belongs to God that is God it doesn't just belong to God it is God that seat is God that seat is just that part of you who he is that he placed in you see because if you were an attribute of thought of God you always were a part of God just like the thought that I might have right now is part of me you can actually see that even in our copyright laws in this country if I have a unique thought and I can pin that unique thought the book and I can copyright that book and if anybody else tries to steal that Fogg and claim it as their own they can get sued by me because that was my thought it's like it's a part of me it's my intelligent or intellectual property it's a part of me see I just happened to put it on a book and for everybody to read and enjoy what my thought was and if somebody tries to steal that then they're a thief because that's me that's part of me well that thought is God and what God expressed that fall down in here in the earth he he put it on these books he put it in these earthen vessels these human beans us so that it can be read ball man we read the pistols read of all been so weird that intellectual property of God that God put down there now if anybody tries to steal from it or take any claim that is your own there a thief and a robber but we belong to God so that part of him that is him it's just that fault that he put out here that's expressed to us that's who we are where it gives intellectual property in the world in the United States at least you can be sued for trying to steal somebody's intellectual property but we are that part of God see your soul is that part of God that's that part of God an attribute of God displayed on earth in a body the body is the bodies listed as them the bodies to be redeemed amen now the souls been redeemed because it was in sin was in sin so remember this is the process that we're talking about we'll get to the justification sanctification Holy Ghost so just like you remember the glass in the chicken yard you know you take the glass out of the chicken yard that's justification it's it's no longer in the chicken yard you take it you wash it you clean it up that sanctification and it's nice beautiful pristine glass but it's still not doing anything but until it's filled with something a beverage water or something to be put into use that's the filling of the Holy Ghost and that's that simplicity of that of that birth the justification was taken out of the cheek it's no longer there anymore amen it's it's it's not a part of that life anymore now see that that soul that's redeemed see for the ground spring is to the point of redemption it has been redeemed if you're in that place of a person in the part of new birth as we just read born again of incorruptible seed you've been born again that your soul has been redeemed your body is to be redeemed amen but listen to the process you say oh well then then our bodies are just here in the world of course or stinky flesh sweet it's just the body I was born with other than getting older and a few more wrinkles and aches and pains and a couple of haircuts in my life I'm saying God what I was born same flesh but it's in the process listen it was the soul was in sin so God the soul was in sin amen I want to bring that down to us in a few minutes we get to our next scripture reading but the soul was in sin so God come down by process of justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul you be part of the earth is redeemed by it you're in the process now it's going on the process of what the redemption of these bodies you go read Romans eight we'll read Romans eight but we won't get to this part of Romans eight but that that new birth or redemption the completion of the redemption ends and I believe it's Romans 8:23 to wit that is to say the redemption of our bodies it's already a process now because the soul has been redeemed which brings the spirit into subjection which brings the body under subjection to the word it's already in process but hasn't received its full Redemption yet so it still lives in sin it still lives in a sinful world it still has sinful thoughts it still has things it comes up from our memories and conscience reason there's still those things that affect us in our body and in our spirit but not in our soul because our soul has been changed it is God now it's not of this old nature it's of God's nature so it's a different it's a different place of of sitting if you will or or disbelief but hold on to that because we'll get back to that in just a moment but he's talking about now we've been through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know makes a way they baptism simply an anointing but that baptism makes a way for the person of Christ this seed to live in you amen that baptism is a cleansing it's an anointing that a-19 of this the anointing of this body Spirit allows that Holy Spirit to bring life to that seed so now God is in there that's God living but that anointing comes to allow a process for that to happen that's a baptism a lot of people say well you have the baptism of Holy Ghost well brother Graham said in modern events you can have the baptism dump needing your going in because the baptism is just an anointing a baptism is just a covering you can get the absolute genuine Holy Spirit of God anointed of your body and spirit and die and go to hell it's the soul that matters it's the inside of the inside that matters you can't live based on some gifts or some anointing you've got to live based on the fact that God has changed your soul and made you a new creature not just some going to church or being a pious person it's not about that it's about being born again having God Christ living in you that at baptism makes your way for the person of Christ to come you will get up you see what I'm talking about that person of Christ to come living you God living in you the baptism just makes a way for that Amen that Holy Spirit now he says though the baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul praise the Lord redeemed the past tense your soul and you've been part of the earth this body you be part of the earth it's redeemed by the process of the redemption that led to the new birth amen so when God took and and brought in a new birth to redeem the soul he got the body in the spirit at the same time amen look now you can't you you you can have justification without having sanctification you can have justification of sanctity about home the Holy Ghost but you can't have just case you Saints case the Holy Ghost without being Saints fighter justify you can't have the Holy Ghost without having the first two so if you've been born again it God's cleanse your soul he's redeemed his intellectual property then your body and your spirit come with it it's it's a package deal you can have the you can have an anointing on the body and not be born again truth but if you're born again the body's been redeemed look now he said it's redeemed by gift by what by the souls Redemption it's being a part of the earth is redeemed by it you're in the process amen a process the process is something that has a beginning has a time period and has an end well that process is going on right now there was a time when we were bored again and brought our bodies under subjection to that spirit but there's good and that processes going on now but when this body change hits and we go in a rapture that's going to be the combination of it it's going to be the end of that process the process is now going on but there's going to be an end to that process when this body takes a change when this corruptible put some in corruption not just the soul incorruptible seed but the body the body puts on the in corruption that's the fullness of the redemption that's why Paul said and Romans 8:23 to wit the redemption of our bodies of our bodies what is that the completion of what God paid for they did the earth the same way this earth that God remember back in the Garden of Eden when when when Adam lost his inheritance he lost his inheritance in life he lost his inheritance to the to the book of life he lost his inheritance to the world he had to he was a mature god of this world he could speak namesake do whatever he wanted in this world because involved in him God put Adam as as as his son as an immature God he put Adam in charge complete charge of this earth because he had the mind of God he had the Spirit of God he had the will of God he had the purpose of God everything about animals God so God had confidence in his son to know that what decisions he was going to make would be exactly what he would have made in him and that sings and that's what his trust and he puts in I believe he puts trust in his children again today it's just like a natural parent in her and her natural children there comes a time where you've turned that child and you've raised that child and you got to bring that child of the place that that they make their own decisions and they can make their own decisions we might not always agree with them as parents but they're going to make their own decisions and a lot of times those decisions are going to be based on what how they were raised and what mom and daddy thought and how what we instilled in them as parents that becomes a lot of the decision-making that they make now they do their own decisions and they do their own thing because we're humans but God Adam was that God child that God son they got had 100% confidence in and we get grown up enough as children of God God suss to make the decisions that are right for us to be led of God and for us to fulfill the perfect will of God for our lives he entrusts us with that that's a part of that three will we're free won't agents because God trusts us as children now there's others that are free moral agents to have a free will to do whatever they want live whatever life they want and people do that the God still did not take away our free moral agency he did not even though what stole we've been born again did not take away our free will because God wants us and allows us to make our own decisions and and go our own way and do her own things and he has confidence enough with his Spirit in there that is we are grown and we continue to move by the Spirit of God that we're going to make the decisions in life and we try to look now we try to we don't always do it perfect but we try to do it exactly the way God would do it if God were standing here in my mind and my body and my flesh God would do it like this and not believe God trusts us that way well it was it was a one hundred percent with Adam because he was there was no sin he was the spoken word of God Adam was but when he lost this earth he lost his inheritance in this earth the he lost his inheritance in life well this earth belonged to God see God's got a big just like we belong to God so dogs got to bring this earth back into his possession because it was rightfully lost to Satan it was rightfully lost it was out of his hands and if it was rightfully lost to Satan and Satan had control of it and Satan still does this is still Satan's Eden you see the coronavirus is a very good example of that and everything else is going on and and all but it still belongs to God this is where we're going to live friends this is where the Millennium is going to be set up this is where the new city the New Jerusalem is going to be said of us right here on this earth so this belongs to God don't belong it didn't Satan's possession but it no longer belongs to him but why he rightfully lost it Adam rightfully lost it to Satan so Satan is in control of it but God had to bring well how did he bring it back you had to bring it back into his possession exactly the same way that he brings us back into his possession first there was a baptism of this earth by Noah and the flood that was the justification that the blood come and the sanctified it cleanse it by his blood that we just read here his blood dripped upon the earth to redeem this earth back by his own blood now this earth listen this now you think whoa if God's brought this back and he's justified he cleansed it and and he's and he put it in the pan the position for us to possess it once again now we know there's going to come a fiery baptism the the Bible says the elements are going to melt with fervent heat so we know that that's going to happen but the place that it's at now and you think well yeah but it's still in such a horrible condition it's still Satan's Eden it absolutely is why because this earth just like so many people is caught right now it's in the place of between sanctification and Bethan and Holy Ghost this earth is in that place that's why it's still the way it is we can operate here and live here as children of God as born-again sons and daughters of God but this earth itself and we've been redeemed but remember these bodies are still here still a part of the earth still a part of the ground still the sticky flesh still the same guy that's born in this this flesh you looking at you said well you haven't changed much well you look down on the inside the inside you'll see I've changed a whole lot but you look at this guy on the flesh you say why you your picture looks like this and you look like this and you look like your mom you look like your dad or you look like when you were 10 or whatever it is you'd say well yeah because that's I'm still in this place you look at the earth you say while the earth is the way it is but this earth is still in the position still in Satan's eatin because it's in between the sanctification we've had the dropping of God's blood on the earth but we haven't had our fiery baptism yet on this earth so when that comes that will be the to wit the redemption of the earth that will be the completion of that Redemption just like we've been redeemed but the completion of our Redemption doesn't take place until these bodies are redeemed to wit the redemption of our bodies that Earth is in the same place you're in the process now see the Earth's in the process we're in the process we live in Satan's even because Satan's Eden because this earth is between sanctification and receiving it's fiery baptism and it will and when it does then it be fit for God and His brighter for us to come and live here the Millennium is going to take place and and then the white throne judgment and the new City God's gonna bring all into possession into his position at that time but it's in the process now it's in the process your body was justified under Noah's baptism why because we're part of the earth if we're part of the earth and being a part of the earth our bodies were justified then amen and your flesh when it dropped upon there it was justified at that moment at that time let's look at some scripture reading again go over to first John what am i one of my favorites I guess I could say I bring this scripture up on many occasion other sermons because it brings such a clear view and a total synopsis of of what's going on in our lives now I've had people say well you know when when you know you sin willfully or you don't to try to put somebody into place even though they've had a new birth that they'll never ever make another mistake or never ever have a sin as will say again puts that person in the place of of angelic or godly perfection in their flesh when our flesh has not been redeemed yet our soul has been redeemed but our body has not so we'll keep that in mind as we continue or go into this read first John chapter 3 I want to begin in verse 1 again I read this I've read this several times but just for the sake of bringing this together now first John 1 first john one says if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us that's first desk first john 1 but now look at first john 3 first john 3 says behold what manner of love that's agape love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god we're still even in this sticky flesh called the sons of god because that's the love of god that he has for us it's his sovereignty therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not so the world doesn't know us this world what world war cosmos this world order doesn't know us because it didn't know him and rejected him and rejects us because were a part of him beloved now are we the sons of God amen and it does not yet appear or manifest to to the world what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that had this hope in him purifies himself even as he pure so we do what we do of our free will to live a godly life we live the godly life from our decision we live a godly life from our own free will because we decide to do that when we decide that we want to do and live the way God wants us to live then that's of our own free will God didn't force us to do it we do it because we love him everyman pure define himself even as God is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law I remember what sin is sin is unbelief sin comes because a person does not believe you can say and you know that he was manifested Jesus Christ was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin now I've said this before and I don't want to change the word but you could look at this word and say that he took away our sins because there was no sin in him the only way he could take our sins was because he was sinless the reason others holding him good godly man could not take away our sins or be our sacrifice is because they were born in sins shaped innate when he come the world speaking lies Jesus Christ was not he was the created blood of God that seed that was placed in Mary that God that thought attribute put in Mary became Jesus Christ the logos come in the fullness of the godhead dwell in him well that was nothing more than God himself well God there is a sinless God than if he's sinless and he can take our sins from us so he took away our sins he was manifested to take away our sin and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him listen now whosoever invited in him sinneth not ok now we're getting somewhere whosoever abideth in Christ sin if not so if you're abiding in Christ you cannot sin understand that whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither known him or transgress the law remember John just laid it out the sin is the transgression of the law you have transgressed the law than you've sinned but the Bible says John said that whosoever abideth in Christ cannot sin sinneth not I'm how in the world can you have it both ways I can you be a sinner and not us and not sin how can you not send it be a sinner how can you live in Christ and not sin yet a disbeliever or have sin in your life I mean it can't be John it can't be both ladies I say this is one of those things that people get stuck in the gutter don't understand they avoid it because it doesn't make any common sense you can't teach it in an innocent in a seminary somewhere this has to come by revelation and has to come by revelation to me to you to those who are gods so that we can understand where we stand and who we are on this earth today you can't have it both ways so has it gonna be well listen because remember we already read about the new birth Peter talked about the new birth well what is abiding in him what does that mean we're for abiding in him that means we had a birth that means something else has taken place because when I was born I wasn't like that I was and I was born with the nature of Wrath I was born with a snake nature I wasn't born that way so something had to take place well John gets to it let's keep reading let's go back to the six verse whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you good advice he that does righteousness is righteous even as is righteous those who do rightly those who are just remember what just is righteous ought to be condition he that committeth sin is of the devil now that's pretty hard but it's true especially after what John just told us what did John just tell us that we abide in him we cannot sin so when he said those he that committeth sin is of the devil he's saying that you still have that old nature you still are in that same condition that you're born in there has to be a new birth so if you haven't received a new birth if you're not abiding in him then you're a sinner you robbed the devil that's that's just the bottom line you belong to the devil until you give your heart to God and God comes in and lives in you then you become his and that's a very simplistic way of putting it that's God's approval of you by putting his spirit in you but if you haven't done that you're still in this snake nature you are of the devil that's just plain and simple you commit sin you're of the devil and of course we all were born unbelievers we all were born without the capacity at that time to to believe that's why again I had the little thing children go to heaven amen they may not go on the rapture but they all go into heaven because they yet have the capacity to do so but he that committeth sin is of the devil so so when we're born of this nature all of us sin your very desire came from your soul the scene of free will to sin the scene of free will caused you to sin that nature reflected in your spirit and then into your body because it came from your soul that's incoming from your soul free moral agent as a free will come from your soul to your spirit then to your body that that is who you were you were a sinner period now we're not as born-again sons and daughters of God we are not sinners although we're the only ones that can sin make a mistake it's like saying it's well I don't seen you think like it but let's just say how much how much of this Bible covers black well it's all black it's not a sinner it's just not it's not pretending to be black it's just black this is what it is sinners just do what they are they're not sitting there just living their lives they're just doing what they are the believers sins so we're not called sinners anymore because we're born in the seed of God so look now originally your sin come from your soldier nature your free will to sin to live it up to do whatever but look at the process he the committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose for this purpose the sin the unbelief for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now what's the works of the devil now there's an S at the end of that what is those words what are the works of the devil well there's one work that I know of but let's go over to the Galatians real quick read these couple of verses of future Galatians chapter 5 let's begin with verse 19 it says now the works of the flesh are manifest works of the flesh or what are the works of the flesh the works of the flesh are the works of the devil because that's where the devil works remember even when you're born again even when you're filled with the Holy Spirit the only places that Satan can access is your body in your spirit because he can no longer access your soul so it's still these still parts of your body your body or your your being your body your spirit still access by the devil so the works of the flesh hence the works of the devil or manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like that's the work of the flesh now one in here like people I don't do this this this but how about that hatred part how much hatred do people have for other people how about hatred do you have for your enemy you better not hate your enemy you better love your enemy you better do good here enemy you better pray for them and if you love them unconditionally I don't see how they can be an enemy anyway but they might treat you as an enemy but you're not there that they're not your enemy because they're they're not that's your brother that's your sister when we identify the spirit and what happens in the spirit of what takes place in the spirit those are the that that is the works of the flesh so what John is saying here for this purpose is some of those manifest he might destroy the works of the devil so now if you're born again word of the works of the devil take place here the works of the flesh are right here in the body and even in the spirit because the spirit would try to bring things back up from your life or pervert your affection or try to bring back into memory things you used to live in your old life but and affect your body but but the body is the things that we look at is the works of the flesh are the works of the devil and Jesus Christ was man tested to destroy the works plural but what is that work what is it that brings each one of those attributes into being I believe you do those things because you don't believe you do those things because you have in your free will you still have the wrong nature and you desire your very desire is to do that is to live that way to be that kind of person and that's why you do it that's why people out here do it we judge people that we condemn people we do all these other things to people out of the world today it's hard to see things in in your mind and it hurts your hearts about this you you know they could be that's a soul that's where 10 million worlds that you'd like to reward to bring back to Jesus Christ but that's all based on God's predestination of God man as you go witness to that person whatever you do it but otherwise that's that that that's in God's hands that's up to God it hurts to see but we condemn it all but they're just doing what they are they condemn and look down on us as Christians as born-again sons and daughters of God they look down on us they think say all kinds of things against us but we can't help but do what's in us to do we just live who we are that's all we can do weren't God God's children were sons and daughters were born of the Spirit were led of his Spirit so we lived a life because that's what we are that's what we do Jesus was manifested he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever listen now ix first whosoever is born of God does not commit sin now up here in the what was it the six in the sixth verse he said whosoever abideth in him sin and not but now in the night first he said whoever is born of God does not commit sin so if you're born of God you do not commit sin for his seed his seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he is born of God so what's John talking about what is it that God is accounting or not accounting to us what is it that we think well if I made a mistake or I've done something wrong or I'm transgressed God's work we go and apologize we repent and we ask God to forgive us you think oh well have I crossed over the line have I done it to where God won't forgive me anymore don't ever think like that because in the beginning your soul your free will dictated to you to sin it was your nature to want to sin but after you were born again the mistakes that we make the slip-ups the the the shortcomings come from here come from your body in their spirit you see cuz John is making a very stark difference between the sin that we had in the flesh the sin that we had when we were not born again the sin that people still live when they're not born again a stark contrast between those that are born again so what's John st. John saying over here that you can sin if you said you haven't sinned that you're you're a liar man over here he's saying that if you are born of God you cannot sin so so the balance of understanding what John is talking about is realizing one of without the new birth and the person with the new birth a person without the new birth sins from there because what is God concerned with what is what is it God's looking at he's looking at the soul he's looking at the innermost inside beam that's what he's concerned about that's what God looks for his Bloods got the blood ran around the earth that's taking care of the things in the body in the spirit we accept him that's done away with remember blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now you go read the end of chapter 7 and in chapter 8 verse 1 and see were the turmoil that John that Paul was heading between being born again and living in this flesh and still having the stickiness of this flesh he said the things I don't want to do if I'm myself doing the things I want to do is the things I don't do so what do I find he says when I do good evil is always present he always in himself explaining an understanding the battle that every one of us go through between the new birth and being born again and still making mistakes still doing still slipping up still sinning still things that we know we should do now when the Spirit of God come remember every man that had this hope in him purifies himself now there's the difference if you make a mistake here it's a mistake slip-up you caught the trap or something but it's not from the soul he's talking about a new birth a seed that seed that remaineth that's another reason that I believe it's it's this that it didn't just drop in there when you heard the word the seed that remains well if it remains that mean it was already there wolf is already there it stays there it just continues on that seed just eventually comes to life so when that seed remains there in him he can not see him why because he's born of God now does that make your flesh perfect no it's still in the process remember it still it's it's been potentially redeemed yes we're going on or in the process just like the air of this we're still in the process but the fullness of that redemption of the body's not going to happen till we get a body change going to rapture so yeah the stickiness of this flesh still happens there's still things that we do but you're no longer now now on the conversely now if you if you if in your soul you have a desire to just go light up the bars and and live that kind of life then that shows there hasn't been a change but if you make the mistake her slip-up or something to do something wrong and in your heart in your soul there's something there conviction says you know you should have done that you know that wasn't you make it right you make it right quickly that shows there's something in you the same that's not right you know it's not and then you do and then you move forward from there because that's been justified that's in God see if forgive when she never did that never existed you don't used to make the statement as as far as darkness is for light frame but that's wrong it's not even as far as darkness is from light because this doesn't exist at all it's not even in darkness because it's not there doesn't exist crazy in the mind of God doesn't exist no wonder you can't send no wonder blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin there is therefore now no condemnation do them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what's that spirit not to human spirits but the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit that now is the permanent resident of your soul we don't walk by the flesh we walk by the spirit that soul influences the spirit that spirit influence is the body and the times get the way but I wanted to read this to you here and now this isn't who is this Melchizedek February 1965 my man said he that he that's born of God does not commit sin and I actually didn't even read that quote that scripture in the tenth verse in this the new birth the children of God are manifest and the children of devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother Amen so in this the children of God are born cannot sin he that is born of God does not commit sin he can not sin again what's the operative word there birth born amen born of God new birth go back to Peter the new birth of incorruptible seed seed that remaineth their incorruptible seed a new birth even is born of God that not commit sin he cannot see in Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just quit smoking no just get into Christ and it's all gone it's like we're saying earlier you said well how do you know get it and you'll know that's that's easiest thing I'm going to tell you if people say well how do you know get it and you'll know if you don't know I doubt you have it because your body is subject to the spirit your body is subject to the spirit it is no more subject to the things of the world although it is influenced by the things of the world it's not subject to the things of the world to do the things of the world although it is influenced by the things of the world they are dead they are dead your sins are buried in Baptism and you are a new creature in Christ and your body is becoming subject to the spirit listen now this amen we're not we're not perfect beings jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect as a mature Christian amen even a mature Christian say that brother branham still made mistakes still did things wrong I bring up the example of him having his wife lied to the RS agent all the time it's a mistake God even called demony when he went to pray for the girl take your hands off that baby you're not fit to pray for her see had his own little girl say picked up the phone said daddy let me tell them they're not here you see doesn't mean your perfect sinless perfect but mature but even mature Christians in this sticky flesh make mistakes your body but your body is becoming subject to the spirit to try to live a right kind of life and there you go if there's not a desire to want to or try to live a right kind of life then I doubt very seriously you have the right kind of spirit I doubt very seriously you've been born again but if you have the desire to what to and you try to and you press forward into that not not just to say well you know I somebody tried and tried and couldn't get it well how did they try I mean I cried and prayed and went to the altar 100 times well if you went the first time you shouldn't have gone the second time I mean not not for that purpose anyway he's nothing wrong with going to an altar but the altars your heart if you've got em you trust God of gods clenched chin then he's done his part if there's a hiccup in there don't belong to God it belongs to you but but I'm saying that there's a desire there and God has taken control of that soul and and that desire of your soul now is to do what's right and to do the things you know godly in them by the scripture and that and that spirit is taking you and changing you and making you more into his image that we're growing into that see this body is getting to that place this body is coming to that place to where it will eventually get to the place to where just like it did with Enoch it was so much like God that God took him home we're going to get to the same place at the right time at the right place amen by faith God is bringing us to that place but you don't look at it based on the flesh based on the deception of the flesh you look at it based on the new birth and what God's done for you well we're going to continue to make mistakes and do things wrong but the closer we get to God the less of those we do the more we become like God the less of those things happen the more the more in His image we get through that new birth the new birth there's no sin you cannot sin we're here because this is you know always has been but we just come to the acknowledgement other than understanding of it this has always been us I always been me but we just come to that understanding but it throws all this into subjection then amen it brings us all into the place to say well I used to stand yeah well we used to sin because your desire was for the things of the world your soul commanded you your your nature commanded you to sin but when you were born again then the things of God take over then the only way that you sin you make mistake trip fall stumble is because of the body it's in the flesh those things are accounted to God that's already done that's already the blood of Jesus Christ covers that the Bible says he first he so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son we loved the world where do we come from we came from the world we came from this earth we should say we came from this earth we did come from cause mom's we come from this this earth God so loved he gave His only begotten Son the who should I believe in him the NEM shall not perish but have everlasting like that that blood man is still there and that's that that's been taken care of God son that's not the concern the concern is in this soul we're not here to make church members we're not here to amplify some kind of a gift we're not here to try to get people to have big numbers we're here to be sons and daughters of God born again get people to Christ not just to justification not just to sanctification not just to a baptism or an anointing but through the indwelling presence of Christ in their life and that predestinated seed is there it remains there it's still there it stays there it just comes to life it's not a scene anymore and those that are mature Christian is just not a scene anymore it's now putting forth fruit it's a full grown tree if you will that's putting forth fruit that's living the life of godly life because that's the nature of the sea amen do we make mistakes sure we do do we fall and get tripped up sure we do but the closer we get to God and the more we get like God the less of those things happen amen because we are sons and daughters of God I can go back real quick beloved now are we the sons of God now are we the sons of God and it's not something anything that I've done it's what he did and I just accepted it I just accepted and received it on on his behalf but he did it and he did it for us that we meet the children of God it leads us from that justification from the chicken yard the sanctification to the cleansing up to filling it amen to the filling it of the Holy Spirit doesn't do any good didn't just have water on the outside of the glass doesn't do any good just to anoint the glass on the outside that comes to the baptism matter that comes with the process of sanctification but when you fill it there's the difference that's when that glass is in operation now when it's being cleansed or it's under that anointing oh it can look and act just like the genuine just like the real but it won't and can't live that word word by word amen there's a difference in sinning making mistakes fall and willfully sinning a person who looks at and said well I don't care I'm gonna do it anyway well I doubt your desire has changed amen praise the Lord well god bless you again appreciate each one of you being here with us today I pray something was said to bless and strengthen you in some way and then we miss you all love you very much in the Lord and hopefully again as we say I think every week or every time I have a recording that I hope this is over real soon I think it will be looks like the things are calming down but you know friend to me it's kind of just it's kind of just a little sign of a beginning things that's happening maybe this year maybe 10 years maybe 15 years we don't know maybe tomorrow but always be ready amen always be ready regardless of how long it is always be ready keep your hearts and minds pure take this time that you're at home to read more pray study seek the Lord more get closer to him amen and the Bible says he draws not.we drawn out of him he'll draw nigh to us amen so we love you on the Lord pray the Lord reach to the Blessed you we're here for you if you need anything from me my wife call text email and again like I said if you had meet something from Micah support at word about Tabernacle comm you'd be happy to answer questions how to do the website and app or if you have any prayer requests or anything like that you can give to me give to him or send them that way and we'll put them on the website for those to hear and to be a part of so amen appreciate you all love you in the Lord God richly bless you
