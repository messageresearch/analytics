[0:00] welcome to our living room once again
[0:02] hopefully for the last time it's going
[0:04] to be the last living room stream we're
[0:07] going to do as I mentioned last week me
[0:09] and sooner you're gonna go planning on
[0:11] trying to have an anniversary trip next
[0:13] week next Sunday will be our 35th
[0:16] anniversary so we're gonna try to be out
[0:19] of town I've been thinking about maybe
[0:20] if I have some time during the week
[0:22] doing an extra message short like I
[0:27] normally do during the week and maybe
[0:29] for Sunday but also remember that
[0:32] brother Roger has his streaming at 10
[0:33] o'clock on Sunday mornings as well
[0:35] something that you could attend or be a
[0:37] part of but me and son are going to be
[0:40] gone Lord willing next Sunday we won't
[0:43] be here so then the following Sunday
[0:45] we're gonna try to meet the holiday in
[0:49] conference room the two other places
[0:51] that I had that we're hopeful for more
[0:52] permanent places for us to be fell
[0:55] through so at least as of right now I'm
[0:59] using one of those just going to work so
[1:02] again as of right now next next week me
[1:06] and sone you're going to be gone the
[1:07] following week we're gonna be trying to
[1:09] start meeting at the Holiday Inn
[1:10] conference room there on kotero Cracker
[1:13] Barrel Drive right there off court arrow
[1:15] half a mile or so from where we used to
[1:18] have church so that's kind of the plan
[1:21] right now anything changes I'll let you
[1:23] know but as as I said before it looks
[1:26] like this would be our last string here
[1:28] in our living room
[1:29] but it's glad to have each one of you
[1:32] don't know how much it means to me to
[1:34] know that you're on the other end of
[1:36] this and watching it's it's a little
[1:39] different when I do the midweek and with
[1:41] my phone and just by myself it's a
[1:43] little different than standing here live
[1:45] and knowing that you're sitting there
[1:47] listening really makes a big difference
[1:48] to me so I appreciate you being there I
[1:51] appreciate you listening and being part
[1:52] of the service today and we'll all be a
[1:54] part of it together even though we're
[1:56] separate but we're one spirit amen
[1:59] or in one spirit and that's what matters
[2:02] the most just help us come to realize
[2:04] how much we need each other and how much
[2:07] we
[2:07] pinned on each other but also the
[2:10] preparation of understanding that we
[2:12] need him for the kneading thing so with
[2:15] him in our lives and in leading and
[2:17] guiding us that's what matters the most
[2:19] and no matter where we are we're still
[2:21] together so God's going to be calling us
[2:23] from all Kindred's tongue people nation
[2:26] we're going to be coming from all over
[2:27] the world to come together and rapture
[2:30] is going to take place to go home and
[2:32] we're all going to come together that
[2:34] one unified place someday so looking
[2:36] forward to that time amen so god bless
[2:39] you today welcome to our service we want
[2:42] to open our service and word of Prayer
[2:43] now I had one person sister she had sent
[2:47] me prayer requests her behalf
[2:50] first of all she said that she had a
[2:52] serious unspoken family and requests
[2:55] that she wants us to remember in prayer
[2:58] also continue remember her brother
[2:59] Harlan which we've mentioned here
[3:01] several times you've been praying for I
[3:03] trust for sister she Leah's brother
[3:05] Harlan in Texas teen you remember him in
[3:07] prayer as she reiterated the fact that
[3:10] he has mentioned to her that he feels
[3:13] when the people are praying for him so
[3:15] this made sure and keep that up and pray
[3:18] for her pray for our pray for him pray
[3:20] for the other requests we had her
[3:22] brother Jenna's wife Leah of course
[3:25] she's a nurse there with all that's
[3:27] going on with the Cova thing and it
[3:29] seems like we're getting back to a
[3:31] little semblance of normal in the nation
[3:33] I heard that every country every state
[3:36] now has loosened some regulations at
[3:38] some point to some degree in the entire
[3:41] country so we're thankful for that and
[3:44] get back to I guess what's considered
[3:46] normal in this world today what's normal
[3:50] is not normal to us but normal according
[3:51] to our country normal according to the
[3:53] world and sister Sheila also asked for
[3:57] requests she had fallen earlier in the
[3:59] week on a concrete or asphalt street
[4:03] trying to swerve startled by an
[4:05] aggressive dog and she felt she was
[4:07] thankful she didn't hurt anything or
[4:09] didn't break anything I should say just
[4:12] some recovery and getting back to normal
[4:15] also
[4:17] to make known that you know I've been
[4:20] working me and brother Rogers been
[4:21] working doing electrical work together
[4:23] and we were out Wednesday I believe it
[4:27] was believed it was wins anyway and got
[4:31] into some behind some bushes and brother
[4:33] Roger was drilling holes in the wall and
[4:35] B started stinging him and so we worked
[4:40] on another part of the job and had to
[4:43] come back over to that part and he
[4:45] started drilling to that wall again and
[4:47] the Beast has come piling over the back
[4:49] of that wall and they were by the dozens
[4:52] I saw 3040 of them probably I told the
[4:55] rupture get out of there she had been
[4:57] allergic to bees before I don't know if
[5:00] you've heard the story but he got stung
[5:02] as a young boy brother branham pray for
[5:04] him and healed got healed but his airway
[5:08] restrict so I said you better get out of
[5:11] there well the guy at the owner of the
[5:12] house had some people some exterminators
[5:15] go over and found out that there were
[5:17] thousands of bees living in the back
[5:20] side of that wall so we still haven't
[5:23] been able to finish that job and
[5:25] exterminate or come out but we got a few
[5:28] stings brother Roger got about five of
[5:30] them I have I think three couple owned
[5:32] one of each arm my head so thankful the
[5:35] Lord's blessed us and it wasn't any
[5:38] worse than that so God's been good to us
[5:41] but just remember those remember the
[5:43] Bride of Christ worldwide in prayer

[5:47] you had one of course you signified to
[5:49] the Lord in your heart that you have a
[5:51] need that you expect and believe the him

[8:41] time for this fellowship and pray your
[8:44] Holy Spirit would have its preeminence
[8:46] now as we committed to you and they're
[8:48] mainly part of this service I ask it and
[8:50] ask it on behalf of our congregation in
[8:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[8:54] pray amen amen
[8:58] so come to you today and had a couple
[9:02] thoughts of my heart this is something
[9:05] last week was something that I told you
[9:07] mentioned and we've gone over before
[9:09] today's the same thing something that
[9:12] came on my heart that I thought was very
[9:14] appropriate for today and for us and for
[9:17] what we're going through and for the
[9:19] things that's happening in this country
[9:21] in the world today to understand that as
[9:24] we've gone through the different things
[9:26] it's it's as I looked back and reflected
[9:29] upon it it's kind of a progression
[9:30] almost a little bit how the Lord has
[9:33] brought each one of these sermons during
[9:35] this period of time to the place that
[9:37] it's at now thinking about this world is
[9:40] not our home and and were exempt from
[9:43] the things of the world and God has
[9:45] called us and raised us up into heavenly
[9:47] places in a bride age and to a place
[9:50] where all these things that we look at
[9:53] the diseases afflictions all those
[9:55] things I'm not saying that we're
[9:57] completely exempt from those friends but
[9:59] I do understand that in this life that
[10:01] God has already given us and blessed us
[10:04] today so titled this just divine healing
[10:07] but it's going back into numbers chapter
[10:10] 21 sermon they would preached before
[10:13] about the brass serpent and thought a
[10:15] very appropriate for for what we're
[10:18] going through today and what I believe
[10:20] the Lord put on my heart to say today so
[10:22] let's go in the scripture to numbers
[10:24] chapter 21 and read a few verses of
[10:28] Scripture here
[10:29] beginning with the fifth verse numbers
[10:31] 21 5 now before we read this we see that
[10:36] the Canaanites had taken some of the
[10:39] children of Israel and the chart
[10:41] and pledge to God God if you'll
[10:44] delivered them into our hands we vowed
[10:46] to destroy the cities and God did that
[10:49] God liberated them those people that
[10:51] have been captive into their hands and
[10:53] led them into a way of destroying the
[10:56] enemy but then just after that I mean
[11:00] simply the next verse of course that
[11:03] ends at the the third verse then you got
[11:05] the fourth verse of their journey so
[11:07] we're starting with the fifth verse
[11:08] numbers 21 five and this is just after
[11:13] the victory that God had so mightily
[11:15] wrought to them and delivered those that
[11:18] were captive into their hands again the
[11:21] fifth verse now this just really shows
[11:24] the humanistic value of of who we are
[11:27] who they were who we are today listening
[11:29] and the people spake against God and
[11:32] against Moses wherefore have you brought
[11:35] us up out of Egypt to die in the
[11:37] wilderness die in the woods after what
[11:41] God had just done for them for there is
[11:44] no bread neither is there eating water
[11:47] and our soul lovest this liked bread now
[11:51] that white bread the bread means the
[11:53] same thing they just said we have no
[11:56] bread light bread just means the word
[11:59] light which we would think means less
[12:01] calories does not mean that the
[12:03] scripture what it means in the scripture
[12:05] is is contemptible and worthless so what
[12:09] they're saying is the bread that God
[12:11] provided from the supernatural bread God
[12:14] given to them and provided for them
[12:16] there now
[12:17] got so complacent they had gotten so
[12:21] used to it and it becomes so common to
[12:24] them that they kind of complacent about
[12:27] God's provision to them that they began
[12:29] to call God's providing provided way
[12:32] God's provision contemptible and
[12:34] worthless man it's a sad place to be but
[12:38] that's what we're reading that's what
[12:39] we're talking about and hopefully in
[12:41] examining our own lives that we don't
[12:44] get to that place here in our own mind
[12:46] so we get then it becomes so common and
[12:48] becomes so easy
[12:51] to us and and things like that that it's
[12:54] just too common we don't want to let it
[12:57] ever become common see that even goes
[12:59] back to last week scripture on that
[13:00] pressurization we don't want it to
[13:02] become pronto common that pressure comes
[13:05] in to keep it from getting that way see
[13:07] we don't ever want it to become common
[13:10] to us so don't let it become common as
[13:11] it did to them they called it
[13:14] contemptible and worthless God's
[13:17] provided bread was contemptible and
[13:20] worthless and the Lord now this was very
[13:23] displeasing to the Lord so the Lord sent
[13:25] fiery serpents fiery mean poisonous
[13:28] deadly serpents the fiery part come from
[13:32] of course when they win them when the
[13:34] snake bit them it felt like burning fire
[13:37] in their bodies as the poison pulls
[13:39] through their veins
[13:40] it felt fiery and burning
[13:44] thus the fiery serpents said fiery
[13:47] serpents among the people and they bit
[13:50] the people and much people of Israel
[13:52] died now that's the judgment the
[13:56] judgment on their sin their sin of
[14:00] complacency their sin of talking against
[14:03] God to talking against Moses talking
[14:06] against God's provided way their sin
[14:09] their unbelief we know sin is unbelie--
[14:11] their unbelief of bringing this in
[14:14] bringing this plague upon them God sent
[14:17] those fiery serpents as judgment on
[14:20] those people now understand there
[14:23] there's brother Branham preached three
[14:26] kind of believers we know there's three
[14:28] kind of believers he talked about three
[14:29] kind of believers and let every local
[14:30] assembly would you say what he said I
[14:33] trust believe they're not in our
[14:35] assembly but I trusted for good pastors
[14:38] a real good godly pastor he feels the
[14:40] same way about his congregation as I do
[14:42] but brother Graham said there regardless
[14:44] three kind of believers - believer
[14:46] make-believe or
[14:47] unbeliever we can't negate the fact that
[14:49] in
[14:50] Old Testament that it would have been
[14:51] the same way there are those that were
[14:53] the real true believer there were those
[14:56] that were kind of in the middle you know
[14:59] they would they would kind of go with
[15:01] Moses sometimes and then they kind of go
[15:03] with Nathan and Korah sometimes and then
[15:05] you have the bases and quarter group to
[15:07] flat-out unbelievers they weren't made
[15:09] believing at all they weren't a part of
[15:11] it nor were they going to be a part of
[15:13] it didn't want to be a part of it so
[15:14] they were the unbeliever and you had
[15:16] those that were in the middle that kind
[15:18] of went with faith in the quarter
[15:19] sometimes and and and then with Moses
[15:21] sometimes so and then the miracles came
[15:23] and all the the things that God was
[15:26] doing through Moses begin to manifest
[15:28] itself they would go with Moses and they
[15:31] was celebrating them with shout and say
[15:33] praise the Lord and then when it came
[15:34] outside of church when they came out of
[15:37] Moses presence and they heard Nathan and
[15:39] cor over here yelling and screaming
[15:40] about whatever negative or wrong thing
[15:43] that they could they're right there with
[15:45] him saying oh yes yes this then why did
[15:47] you lead us here to die the wilderness
[15:49] blah blah blah so there's that group of
[15:52] people too they were going with Moses
[15:54] son well they were in church they were
[15:55] just as religious as they could be but
[15:57] when they came out of church and all the
[15:59] negativity and all the dissension was
[16:01] happening they were with that too and
[16:04] they go back to church then getting
[16:05] rejuvenate and then they go back out and
[16:07] see you had both groups you had one
[16:09] group regardless of what happened
[16:11] regardless of what was said or took
[16:13] place regardless of how hard the way was
[16:15] they were going to stay with God and
[16:17] Moses period the believer so you can see
[16:21] how even in that day that they would
[16:23] have the same so so these unbelievers
[16:27] began to scream out now they were one
[16:31] group and remember that Israel the Jews
[16:33] are wandering God deals with them as the
[16:37] group the Jews he deals with the
[16:39] Gentiles as individuals we know that so
[16:41] as one of them was beginning to move
[16:44] forward now he deals with the bride to
[16:46] in that way as a body but as Israel was
[16:50] was beginning to speak forth even though
[16:52] it was the make-believe or the
[16:54] unbeliever God deals with him as a groom
[16:56] so that we're all a part of a part of
[16:59] that same group so when when the
[17:02] negative began to come out God reflected
[17:05] on that as Israel that was Israel being
[17:09] rebellious disobedient so as Israel
[17:14] began to do that God sent the judgment
[17:16] on all of them the judgment came down on
[17:21] all of them the fiery serpents were with
[17:23] the believers the fiery serpents was
[17:25] with the Mait believers the fiery
[17:27] serpents were with the unbelievers the
[17:29] fiery serpents were there as a judgment
[17:31] on all of Israel every one of them was
[17:34] subject to that judgment now think about
[17:37] that and think about that and think
[17:39] about that in terms of what's going on
[17:41] today and the things is happening in
[17:43] this world
[17:44] think about coronavirus and what's
[17:46] happening in this world and I hate to
[17:48] think that almost every time we talk now
[17:50] that that word coronavirus happens to be
[17:54] a part of our natural everyday verbage
[17:56] but it's true and it's something that we
[17:59] can relate to because it's happening now
[18:01] but we can relate to it also with
[18:04] recognizing that things like this have
[18:06] happened before and when you look at
[18:08] this and you see this happening to them
[18:11] the judgment was on all of them it was
[18:14] on the believer it was on the make
[18:16] believer and the unbeliever judgment but
[18:19] now let's continue to read now as the
[18:22] serpents begin to bite much of Israel
[18:24] the people of Israel died much of them
[18:26] died seventh verse now therefore the
[18:29] people came to Moses and said we have
[18:31] sinned but we have spoken against the
[18:34] Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord
[18:37] that he take away the Serpent's from us
[18:39] and Moses prayed for the people now it's
[18:42] just kind of common that when people
[18:44] make mistakes or do things wrong they
[18:46] don't issue repent until they're caught
[18:49] people don't usually say they're sorry
[18:52] or contrite or contentious or apologetic
[18:58] until until they're caught now this has
[19:01] come down and God has judged them and
[19:03] now recognizes now wait a minute we've
[19:05] done done something
[19:06] wrong and that seems to be human nature
[19:08] the way people he's due and and so when
[19:12] this happened then they begin to realize
[19:14] oh my we got to stop this somehow we got
[19:16] to repent we got to make things right
[19:18] and that's okay because that's the way
[19:21] God set it up God made a way for us to
[19:23] repent for us to repent today made a way
[19:26] for them to repent and and then Moses
[19:29] went and prayed for the people as he did
[19:32] incessantly Moses made intercession for
[19:35] his people there and the Lord said unto
[19:38] Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set
[19:41] it upon a pole and he shall come to pass
[19:44] that every one that is bitten when he
[19:46] looketh upon it shall live now God's
[19:50] instruction take a serpent of this fiery
[19:53] serpent is a serpent of brass that is
[19:55] formed in the fire form this brass
[19:59] serpent in the form of brass fire it and
[20:04] put it on a stick so that the whole
[20:07] congregation of Israel can see this this
[20:10] fiery serpent now we know that the
[20:12] serpent represented sin and go back to
[20:15] the Garden of Eden and see in the Garden
[20:17] of Eden that the serpent was came forth
[20:20] was sin and that sin in the Garden of
[20:23] Eden was judged so the serpent
[20:26] represented sin judged that sin being
[20:30] judged is what they is what God showed
[20:34] to the children of Israel they could
[20:36] recognize that they can see that sin
[20:39] knowing what happened in the garden
[20:40] eating that sin being judged
[20:43] so what it was was that atonement what
[20:47] it was was a representation of the in
[20:49] sign that that atonement the standard
[20:54] you know the inside just means a
[20:56] standard it's a standard that was set it
[20:59] was something that God brought as a
[21:00] representation as a standard now you
[21:04] know what a standard a standard is
[21:05] something that everything comes off of a
[21:08] standard is is the absolute it's the
[21:11] place of a typos it's the finalization
[21:14] and all for that comes everything else
[21:17] that's the state
[21:19] that's what you go by you got a real
[21:21] dollar bill and you got those that come
[21:23] off of it it's good you got to have the
[21:25] first the standard that's what it is
[21:27] that in son was the standard that
[21:29] standard here being sin already judged
[21:33] that serpent showing the brass serpent
[21:36] of course the brass the brass
[21:38] represented divine judgment but that sin
[21:41] already judged was that was that brass
[21:44] serpent so they looked at it now the
[21:48] people asked Moses to ask God to take
[21:51] away the fiery serpents but God didn't
[21:55] take away the fiery serpents look friend
[21:57] God did not take it away you look at
[22:00] today I I don't see God taking away
[22:05] coronavirus but what did he do for them
[22:08] he made a way of asking for them even
[22:12] though they were still there even though
[22:15] they were still in the midst of the
[22:17] judgment the fiery serpents were still
[22:19] there God was not going to take away the
[22:21] fiery serpents every time that come it
[22:24] was a reminder to those people what they
[22:27] had done it God had taken away those
[22:29] fiery serpents that reminder would not
[22:31] have been there and and eventually as
[22:35] humans are the further time goes by the
[22:38] more you forget those things the more
[22:41] you don't remember how it was back at
[22:44] that day so those fiery serpents were
[22:47] still there God left them there as an
[22:51] example as a reminder to those people
[22:54] that this is what happens when you cross
[22:56] God when you disobey God when you
[22:59] unbelief God now there's also another
[23:03] little caveat to this because as that
[23:06] brass serpent was on the pole
[23:09] representing sin already judged and
[23:12] divine judgment that when they looked
[23:15] upon it what have we just read here when
[23:17] they looked upon it anyone that was
[23:19] bitten when they looked upon it they
[23:21] would live but the other part of this is
[23:24] that
[23:26] they had to believe what the
[23:29] representation was of that inside they
[23:33] had to believe and accept that atonement
[23:36] if they didn't it meant nothing to them
[23:39] it was just an idol see that's the
[23:42] difference in seeing what an idol is to
[23:45] people and what something is as an
[23:47] inside people sometimes think a cross is
[23:49] an idol or a crucifix ISM I don't know
[23:52] it's not it's an enzyme it's an
[23:55] acknowledgment of the atonement that
[23:57] Jesus made for us that brass serpent on
[24:01] that stick still is represented today in
[24:04] our medical community what do you think
[24:07] that stick with the snakes wrapped
[24:09] around it means that shows in our
[24:11] medical community goes right back to the
[24:14] Bible whether they want to believe it or
[24:16] tonight or what it doesn't matter that
[24:19] right there is identifying the scripture
[24:21] in our country to our medical community
[24:24] as as as it has gotten today it
[24:29] represents this in the Bible sin already
[24:33] judged there it is
[24:35] it brought healing it brought salvation
[24:38] because it's the same thing that Tolman
[24:40] it has to be sis not Idol C it has to be
[24:44] looked upon and believed it has to be
[24:48] looked upon as the atonement as the way
[24:51] of escape if it was looked at just as a
[24:54] simple Idol of some kind they still died
[24:56] it not nothing to that person it had to
[25:00] mean to that person the purpose for what
[25:03] God sent it and if it wasn't then it
[25:06] didn't mean anything to them she
[25:08] understand had to be believed if it's
[25:10] not believed it still means nothing it's
[25:13] just like Jesus we're going to get into
[25:15] in just a minute if it's not believed
[25:18] you can look at a crucifix you can look
[25:20] at a cross you can look at Jesus or go
[25:22] back and reflect and even if you don't
[25:25] see the
[25:25] as the atonement as the standard and is
[25:29] the basis for forgiveness of sin for the
[25:32] absolution by the blood of Christ of our
[25:35] sin that atonement that torment means
[25:39] that a price has been paid the price
[25:42] that was paid for your salvation if you
[25:45] don't believe that that it means nothing
[25:47] Jesus means nothing to you the cross
[25:50] means nothing to you
[25:51] if you don't believe it you have to
[25:53] believe this by faith and not just some
[25:55] nominal belief it's got to be something
[25:57] that becomes a part of you becomes a
[26:00] part of you ix first and Moses made the
[26:02] serpent of brass put it upon a pole and
[26:04] it came to pass that if a serpent had
[26:07] bitten any man when he beheld the
[26:09] serpent of brass he lived but he lived
[26:13] by faith he lived because the word
[26:17] became a part of that it became a part
[26:21] of what they believed what they trusted
[26:23] in what they had faith in it became a
[26:26] part of them but it has to be by faith
[26:29] the life that they lived had to be by a
[26:32] life of faith the life that we live
[26:34] today has to be a life of faith now we
[26:38] live in this world we live in the midst
[26:41] of all the germs diseases afflictions
[26:43] people don't worry about that most of
[26:45] the time they're not scared of them
[26:47] I mean people things like cancer and
[26:49] stuff like that people get afraid of and
[26:51] scared and all these so that you don't
[26:54] see the type of reaction like you seen
[26:57] with this coronavirus today I personally
[27:00] think one of the reasons is we've just
[27:02] we've just gotten so far removed from
[27:04] godliness and holiness and faith that it
[27:07] just we've just live in a godless
[27:09] society that's I mean that's pretty
[27:12] blunt but that's just the way I see it
[27:14] you're just looking at a godless society
[27:16] but but nothing wrong with you know
[27:20] people using wisdom but then you got to
[27:23] go back to that that message
[27:25] wisdom versus faith which one do we
[27:29] choose which one do we live by our faith
[27:32] all our faith does is enhance our wisdom
[27:35] amen
[27:36] our faith enhances our wisdom it
[27:38] shouldn't be contradicted to each other
[27:40] they should be complementary to each
[27:42] other but we live in this world today
[27:44] and this virus is out there
[27:47] friends it's out there it's all over the
[27:49] world I I'm sure there's some countries
[27:52] don't have it but of me basically it's
[27:54] all over the world this thing is
[27:55] everywhere so what makes you exempt from
[27:59] it what makes you or anybody else exempt
[28:03] from getting it it's just a matter of
[28:06] fact that that we know that we could be
[28:09] susceptible to it
[28:11] but we also know and believe that God
[28:13] has already made the atonement for it
[28:15] God has already made a way for divine
[28:18] healing to bring us from that point from
[28:21] from the sickness to the health amen you
[28:25] know but even my cancer I mean if God
[28:28] decides for some reason and he wants to
[28:31] take me by cancer or or you or whoever
[28:35] we just praise the Lord if we're not
[28:39] here to be absent from the body is to be
[28:41] present with the Lord so even if we
[28:44] leave from here to go there praise the
[28:47] Lord we're in a much better place anyway
[28:49] but the point I'm trying to make here is
[28:51] to show even even in the midst of that
[28:54] judgment God makes a way of escape and
[28:57] even in the midst of judgment God made a
[28:59] way of escape for the believer they can
[29:02] believe and when they got bit by the
[29:04] fiery serpent they didn't die they lived
[29:07] the judgment was still there the
[29:10] Serpent's were still there but God made
[29:13] in the way of escape God introduced and
[29:16] brought in divine healing if you will
[29:18] for those people that when they were
[29:20] bent they didn't die reminds me of when
[29:23] Paul when Paul coming he was preaching
[29:27] and Dudus his Apostleship and his
[29:30] missionary working and he was standing
[29:33] there with barbarians and had his hand
[29:35] out and a snake and ass have come up and
[29:38] bit his hand and he looked at it and of
[29:40] course they all thought the man was the
[29:42] devil and I want to kill him but when
[29:46] they saw that snake bite his hand he
[29:48] looked at it he just shook it off into
[29:50] the fire and just kept preaching to him
[29:52] and they were waiting for him to die
[29:53] knowing how poisonous that snake was he
[29:56] was gonna die in any minute
[29:57] seeing that no effect of all happened
[30:00] whatsoever
[30:01] fiery serpents truckin and no effect to
[30:04] him whatsoever he shakes off in the fire
[30:06] then from then they started calling God
[30:09] at first he were calling the devil and
[30:12] then when the Lord showed a miracle in
[30:14] their presence and him being just shake
[30:16] it off and just keep preaching they
[30:18] begin to think he was gone she see the
[30:21] difference and the effect that it has
[30:23] what's different today it's the effect
[30:26] it's the same effect with us God has
[30:28] already given us a way of escape he's
[30:30] already give us an inoculation we still
[30:32] have divine healing we still have a way
[30:36] of escape now we go to st. John chapter
[30:40] 3 we go to st. John chapter 3 let me let
[30:45] me read a couple of folks to you before
[30:48] we go to the first John chapter 3 look
[30:49] here sort of reiterating what I had said
[30:54] but in look 1963 in Phoenix he said if
[30:59] men come out there just as an idol to
[31:01] look upon that serpent they received
[31:03] nothing but when the true believer amen
[31:08] remember the true belief of the
[31:10] make-believe or unbeliever the true
[31:12] believer now the make believer can have
[31:14] some of that make believer can can
[31:16] muster up sometimes enough faith to be
[31:18] able to enter into that place as well
[31:20] amen not all of them she kind of got
[31:23] almost two groups really because the the
[31:26] make believers kind of get split in half
[31:28] some of them do can actually believe
[31:31] enough to receive what they need and the
[31:33] others just don't but the true believer
[31:36] as well as talking about
[31:38] what I believe you are you a true
[31:40] believer today that that's the dividing
[31:43] line you've got to be a true believer
[31:44] not a make believer not a not a fair
[31:48] weathered believer not a in church
[31:50] believer but a true believer true
[31:53] believer when that true believer come
[31:55] out there and looked upon that serpent
[31:57] with a spiritual revealed truth big man
[32:00] that serpent itself being that it was in
[32:03] the form of a serpent represented sin
[32:05] already judged I'm said in the garden
[32:07] being that sin was judged by God there
[32:10] they seemed sin their unbelief already
[32:14] under judgment from the serpent in the
[32:16] Garden of Eden and the serpent was made
[32:18] out of brass which means divine judgment
[32:21] see the altar was made at a brass brazen
[32:23] altar which the sacrifice was put on and
[32:25] offered upon as divine judgment that
[32:29] sacrifice was made in divine judgment so
[32:33] that it would it would take away or a
[32:36] toll for pay the price for the
[32:39] worshippers wrongdoing or sin and that's
[32:43] what the brass serpent did that's what
[32:45] the brazen altar was for that's what
[32:47] Jesus quiet Christ was raised for when
[32:51] he was lifted up it was for the same
[32:54] purpose it became judgment he took that
[32:58] on our behalf
[32:59] we'll read that here just a minute now
[33:01] but one more rich in mercy also in
[33:03] Phoenix 1965 the man that looked upon
[33:07] the brass serpent just as a priest piece
[33:09] of brass he never would be healed
[33:12] because he didn't have understanding or
[33:14] revelation of what it was not a
[33:18] revelation of what it was you can't have
[33:20] true faith without a revelation because
[33:22] Reb faith is a revelation by faith Abel
[33:25] offered unto God a more excellent
[33:26] sacrifice
[33:27] what was that faith that faith was a
[33:29] revelation Abel knew what it took to be
[33:31] able to be pleasing to God he knew the
[33:34] kind of sacrifice that it took to please
[33:37] the Lord and by faith he offered that
[33:39] was revelation that revelation brought
[33:42] about his faith
[33:43] his faith believed in his revelation
[33:45] said this is it his faith believed it
[33:48] Speight not only believed it but lived
[33:51] it now Saint John chapter 3 verse 14 st.
[33:58] John 3:14
[33:59] and as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[34:01] the wilderness even so must the Son of
[34:04] Man be lifted up that whosoever
[34:07] believeth in him believeth in him should
[34:10] not perish but have ever have eternal
[34:13] life for God so loved the world that He
[34:16] gave His only begotten Son that
[34:17] whosoever believeth in him should not
[34:19] perish but have everlasting life
[34:21] for God sent not his son into the world
[34:23] to condemn the world but that the world
[34:25] through him might be saved so jesus
[34:29] being lifted up as the brass serpent was
[34:31] was that sin already judged it was that
[34:35] atonement that was made it was that
[34:37] price that was paid that when he was
[34:40] lifted up we could look at that and
[34:43] believe see that doesn't make the
[34:46] crucifix the cross Jesus it doesn't make
[34:48] it an idol it makes it an atonement it
[34:52] makes it a way of life it makes it the
[34:55] in Sun the standard by which we believe
[34:57] see Galatians 3 I believe is Galatians
[35:01] recent of course going back to
[35:03] Deuteronomy 21 that that everything that
[35:07] anyone that hangs on a tree whatsoever
[35:09] hangs on a tree is cursed
[35:11] during Deuteronomy says accursed
[35:13] Galatians cursed is every one that hangs
[35:16] on a tree so he was cursed
[35:18] Jesus was cursed I went to hell was who
[35:21] took our sins Jesus was cursed being
[35:24] that atonement the price that he could
[35:26] pay to be able to bring our salvation to
[35:30] us he took our place so we could take
[35:34] his so that he would take our sin so
[35:38] that we could become sinless that was
[35:41] the standard that was the lifting up
[35:44] that was the curse that he
[35:46] on our behalf what that atonement is it
[35:50] means that it took my place then
[35:52] atonement that that sacrifice that
[35:55] insight meant that that was judged for
[36:00] me he was judged for me he took my place
[36:05] so I could become him so when he was
[36:08] lifted up it was the same thing it was
[36:11] Jesus it was that sin whose sin now any
[36:15] men you look in the Garden of Eden and
[36:17] the serpent and the brass serpent but
[36:19] whose sin was being judged here my sin
[36:23] my sin was being judged in Christ
[36:25] because he had no sin he was sinless he
[36:28] was the perfect sinless son of God he
[36:30] had no sin so what sin was being judged
[36:33] at Calvary it was mine because he took
[36:36] my sin on him and thus was judged by it
[36:40] and became a curse for me so I cannot be
[36:45] cursed I'm not cursed today blessed is
[36:47] the man to whom God will not impute sin
[36:50] because because he took that sins for us
[36:55] now here again we have to look at this
[36:58] because this is the very most paramount
[37:01] point to understand as Moses lifted up
[37:05] 15th verse doubtless it's still st. John
[37:08] 3:15 that whosoever believeth in him
[37:12] should not perish but have everlasting
[37:14] or eternal life believeth in him there's
[37:19] got to be that measure of faith just
[37:21] like there was with the serpent of the
[37:22] wilderness there's got to be that
[37:24] measure of faith there's got to be that
[37:26] belief if that belief is gone if it's
[37:29] just a matter of saying oh it's a
[37:31] religion oh it's some kind of covering
[37:33] oh it's just a social group we can
[37:35] belong to or it's just the way they do
[37:38] things or and then just go about your
[37:41] normal life and just live however you
[37:43] want this worldly and ungodly as you
[37:44] want to and see there's nothing there
[37:46] there's nothing there there has to be a
[37:49] faith there has to be a belief if
[37:51] there's a faith and a belief and you
[37:54] truly believe
[37:55] then that belief is gonna bring action
[37:58] to your life to want to obey God and
[38:00] obey his word if there's no obedience to
[38:03] God in his word there's no faith you
[38:05] don't believe he is who you say he is if
[38:08] you believe he you believe he is who he
[38:11] you say he is then you're gonna be
[38:13] obedient there's gonna be obedience to
[38:15] the word you're gonna live the life
[38:17] that's according to God's Word not
[38:19] according to your denomination not
[38:21] according to your unbelief seminary or
[38:23] it's what somebody said on a television
[38:26] or televangelists or something no
[38:28] according to this word God's Holy Bible
[38:31] this is the standard this is the
[38:34] standard by which every one of them has
[38:37] to live every one of us have to live but
[38:40] this standard Jesus made that standard
[38:43] he made this standard live he made it
[38:46] right it's true everything from it has
[38:50] to come by it if it doesn't is not a
[38:53] part of this product it's not a part of
[38:56] God if you're not a part of God then
[38:59] what does that make you you're not a
[39:01] believer you can look upon it all you
[39:04] want
[39:05] churches can defy coronavirus all they
[39:07] want print but if you don't have the
[39:09] goods you just bring a reproach I heard
[39:13] the other day that some people churches
[39:16] now and then I'm not you do what you
[39:20] feel led to do of God I would I would
[39:23] never I would never try to question the
[39:27] Holy Ghost leaving in your life that you
[39:29] feel that - do you do that I'm just here
[39:31] to preach the gospel and tell you what
[39:33] the Bible says in 1 the Lord is good on
[39:35] my heart but if you feel whatever the
[39:37] Holy Spirit telling you you do that but
[39:40] when you go back and think about and I
[39:43] heard again this week some people that
[39:45] had defied the orders to stay home head
[39:47] church and that's fine I probably
[39:50] wouldn't have shut down my church doors
[39:51] either
[39:52] toys but they defied that and now the
[39:57] reproach is that a pastor or two and
[40:01] congregation members have now come down
[40:03] and tested positive coronavirus now if
[40:06] you're not a believer in you do this
[40:08] what kind of reproach does that bring on
[40:10] the gospel if you mentor those church
[40:14] doors you believe you have faith you you
[40:17] obey God's Word you're standing on that
[40:20] standard that standard will stand for
[40:22] you it won't it won't bring a reproach
[40:26] it won't show that there's that there's
[40:29] a hypocrite there it'll stir oh that
[40:32] Jesus or daughter or anything that we
[40:35] follow and believe is wrong it'll hold
[40:38] that standard true friend and you'll be
[40:40] its representative and you'll be its
[40:42] standard bearer today you are the
[40:45] standard bearer of this word going on
[40:47] into the world to show that doesn't mean
[40:50] that we don't get sick and things like
[40:52] that I'm not talking about that but we
[40:54] don't want to go and do things that's
[40:56] contrary to say all we we defy this and
[40:59] we defy that and you come down with it
[41:01] come on at this if if the Holy Spirit's
[41:04] moving is God in your life and you got
[41:06] faith there that I'm sorry I just don't
[41:08] believe that's going to happen I believe
[41:10] God's been God will take care of me if
[41:12] you stand upon him his word he'll always
[41:15] do it it's divine healing but now we've
[41:17] got down to the part of faith believe he
[41:20] that believe it it's not just saying oh
[41:23] I believe it's not just saying you know
[41:28] Jesus is God and then that's fine that's
[41:32] good but there's got to be a standard to
[41:35] that and that's the obedience to the
[41:38] word when he says I believe it's got to
[41:40] be more than just your lips that are
[41:42] saying it if you believe you're gonna
[41:45] live it you're gonna act upon it there's
[41:47] got to be a
[41:48] there there's got to be something that
[41:50] backs it up
[41:51] you know isaiah 53:1 says he was wounded
[41:54] for our transgressions bruised for our
[41:57] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[42:00] is upon him and by His stripes we are
[42:02] healed if you think about that and you
[42:06] look at what that compounding scripture
[42:10] does for us as individuals today what it
[42:14] reminds me of a scripture I'll get to in
[42:17] in James we can turn to the James
[42:21] chapter 5 probably all know it very well
[42:23] but let's go to James chapter 5 James
[42:28] chapter 5 let's begin with verse 13
[42:30] James 5:13 look at this now James says
[42:36] if any man if if is any among you
[42:39] afflicted let him pray is any merry let
[42:43] him sing psalms is any sick among you
[42:47] let him call for the elders of the
[42:49] church and let them pray over him
[42:51] anointing him with oil in the name of
[42:54] the Lord amen now that's a great
[42:56] scripture a great prescription to go by
[42:59] but look at the compounding of what
[43:02] James is in in my opinion repeating what
[43:06] Isaiah said in chapter 53 look and the
[43:09] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[43:13] the Lord shall raise him up and if he
[43:17] have committed sins they shall be
[43:20] forgiven him what was the compounding
[43:24] that Jesus did he was wounded for what
[43:27] transgressions well that's not physical
[43:30] healing that spiritual healing our
[43:33] transgressions are our sins our unbelief
[43:36] our transgressing God's Word he was
[43:41] wounded for those sins he was bruised
[43:45] for our iniquities our wrongdoings
[43:48] doing things we
[43:50] we shouldn't are not doing what we
[43:51] should see bruised for our iniquities
[43:54] the chastisement our peace upon and by
[43:57] His stripes now we are what healed
[44:00] healed so it follows along with James
[44:03] reading that the prayer of the faith
[44:06] shall save the sick the prayer of faith
[44:08] now prayer faith can't just be a regular
[44:10] old just bow your head and say some
[44:12] words it's got to be a prayer of faith
[44:14] it's got to be a prayer of revelation of
[44:17] God's Word when we read that quote here
[44:20] see when that when that one looked upon
[44:23] that serpent would spiritually revealed
[44:26] truth revelation of what it meant of
[44:30] what it was who Jesus is they did by the
[44:34] brass serpent we do by what we look to
[44:37] Jesus for now we don't look at a brass
[44:39] serpent we look to Jesus we see in our
[44:42] medical field the pole of the Serpent's
[44:44] on it that's just a recognition
[44:45] recognize a recognition of divine
[44:49] healing back in the scripture
[44:52] supernatural healing one person it would
[44:56] bite they die next person you bite
[44:58] they'd live you explain to this God but
[45:04] it's gotta be by faith the prayer of
[45:05] faith shall save the sick and the Lord
[45:10] shall raise them up the city amen
[45:13] that's healing and if he committed sin
[45:16] they shot the sins shall be forgiven
[45:18] young the prayer of faith think about
[45:21] the power of prayer and the power of
[45:24] your prayers if you have the prayer of
[45:28] faith that save the sick and forgive sin
[45:35] 16th verse this is the hardest part
[45:37] probably one of the hardest outside of
[45:39] maybe tithes and offerings when it comes
[45:41] to finances and a lot of times not
[45:44] everybody but
[45:47] in a lot of ways this is one of the
[45:48] hardest scriptures people have confess
[45:51] your faults one to another and pray one
[45:54] for another that ye may be healed the
[45:58] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[46:00] man availeth much now it says confess
[46:02] your faults doesn't say confess your
[46:04] sins
[46:05] it says confess your faults say brothers
[46:08] just try have a I have a hard time with
[46:10] the spirit would you pray for me not I
[46:13] killed someone I buried him in the
[46:15] desert or I'm not talking we're not
[46:16] talking about sins we're talking about
[46:18] falls shortcomings the struggles people
[46:23] have with with certain sins and certain
[46:26] demons Devils of certain kinds that come
[46:30] into our lives if we all have them I
[46:32] mean everybody has a weak spot you know
[46:34] some people have problems with alcohol
[46:36] some people have problems with blonds
[46:38] some people have problems gambling
[46:40] obesity there's all kinds of things
[46:43] that's out there they say help me to
[46:46] keep from struggling on this is a fault
[46:49] I have pray for me that I overcome this
[46:51] devil amen
[46:53] right so and then at the end it says the
[46:56] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[46:59] man availeth lunch before God now that
[47:01] man is humanity of course doesn't have
[47:03] to be a male/female to as we talked
[47:06] about on mother's day I don't believe
[47:08] there's any other prayer that avails to
[47:10] God any more than a mother's prayer for
[47:12] children that's my opinion you know
[47:15] can't be just scripture on that one but
[47:17] that's my opinion but the effectual
[47:19] fervent prayer the effectual that is a
[47:24] powerful prayer one that is has a lot of
[47:29] faith behind it
[47:30] fervent is passionate and and and
[47:34] burning prayer means you have a desire
[47:37] see so it's a burning desire that has
[47:41] faith and and and power behind it
[47:44] available before God of a righteous man
[47:49] a holy man a person with a faith see in
[47:54] availeth months before God because the
[47:56] lights Elias was a man subject to like
[48:00] passions as we are we know the things
[48:03] that Elijah did in his life from the
[48:05] power and the things that happened in
[48:06] alliances life thinking he was a man
[48:08] subject to like passions just as we are
[48:10] I mean my goodness you meant come off a
[48:15] Mount Carmel with winning the Mount
[48:18] Carmel showdown he goes and runs from
[48:21] one woman he goes and hides under a tree
[48:23] and that begs got to kill him it's just
[48:26] God I'm all these are dead around me and
[48:31] I'm the only one left I got seven
[48:33] thousand and having Beldon about the
[48:35] need to bail yet you don't know nothing
[48:37] about get up mountain of that tree go go
[48:40] about your business but God took care of
[48:42] him see but he was a man of subject to
[48:44] like passions just as we are but he
[48:47] prayed earnestly that might not rain and
[48:48] rain not on the earth by the space of
[48:50] three years and six months my goodness
[48:53] you get 40 days around in Tucson without
[48:55] rain and I started getting antsy myself
[48:57] but anyway and he prayed again and the
[49:00] heavens gave rain and the earth brought
[49:01] forth forth her fruit brethren if if any
[49:05] of you do err from the truth and one
[49:08] convert and let him know that he which
[49:10] converteth the sinner from the error of
[49:11] his way shall save the soul from death
[49:13] and the soul and shall hide a multitude
[49:16] of sanim amen
[49:19] that's what prevails before God she look
[49:22] at today well close your just a minute
[49:24] you look at today what we're dealing
[49:26] with you look at the scripture see what
[49:30] they were dealing with they begin to
[49:32] murmur complain so God sent judgment
[49:34] down and then they repented and God
[49:38] didn't take away the judgment but he
[49:40] made a way of escape what is our way of
[49:43] escape today we're living in a world of
[49:44] judgment we've talked about that the
[49:47] warning has come I believe there's still
[49:49] warnings because we're still here
[49:51] there's still warnings but judgment is
[49:53] also falling upon this wicked and
[49:56] adulterous layout
[49:57] in age and we know that we're in the
[49:59] middle of judgment so if we're in the
[50:01] middle of judgment that judgment that
[50:03] sin has to be judged we're in the middle
[50:06] of a sinful war that sin has to be
[50:07] judged
[50:08] well who's judged it's still here even
[50:11] though we're here even though the bride
[50:13] is here I say we in reference to God's
[50:15] children I don't mean me or my family
[50:18] but I mean God's children international
[50:20] old wide you're watching this when you
[50:22] consider yourself one of them then
[50:23] praise the Lord you're one of them so
[50:26] awesome time we as in believer we're
[50:29] still here in the middle of the judgment
[50:31] God's not taking it from us he's just
[50:35] giving us the way of escape he's just
[50:37] give us through the atonement of Jesus
[50:39] Christ that we looked to that cross we
[50:42] look to Calvary now when I had to
[50:44] physically look to a crucifix or cross
[50:46] nothing wrong with that you can do that
[50:49] if you'd like but it's the faith that
[50:51] you have when you're all alone and
[50:53] there's no one around when you don't
[50:55] have church when you don't have this one
[50:58] or that one he's still there it's still
[51:03] there he's still with us he's still the
[51:05] atonement
[51:06] so regardless of any of that we can
[51:08] still look to him and believe for
[51:11] healing divine healing now if they if
[51:15] they come up with a vaccination or a
[51:20] cure for this or whatever fine and dandy
[51:23] if they do that's fine as they go
[51:25] I believe they probably will I don't
[51:29] think this is the end-all to everything
[51:30] I've told you that mentioned that again
[51:32] last week I don't think this is the end
[51:33] of everything everybody so many people
[51:35] keep talking about how this coronavirus
[51:37] and the end and all this we don't need a
[51:39] coronavirus tell us we're living in the
[51:41] end times
[51:42] you're a bride members Saints you know
[51:43] you're living in the end times we know
[51:45] we're at the end it's just just part of
[51:48] it
[51:48] I think it's more control thing anything
[51:50] but again watching myself that's what I
[51:54] say
[51:54] but anyway it's not any different to me
[51:58] then what they did if even if that thing
[52:02] were to come and bite you even if that
[52:05] thing were to come and bite me we
[52:07] to have the faith to believe God's gonna
[52:10] in the work of the Lord doing God's
[52:13] bidding in your life being led by his
[52:15] Spirit God is obligated to take care of
[52:18] you if something does happen or come
[52:21] about I believe I believe divine healing
[52:25] still in place friend God will take care
[52:28] of us amen
[52:30] God will take care of us now in look the
[52:33] way to Jesus my last quote today and
[52:36] look away to Jesus
[52:37] December 1963 Israel looked at the brass
[52:40] serpent that Moses made and saw the
[52:43] suffering of Christ for the judgment for
[52:47] the sick amen
[52:48] that's what we're looking at today but
[52:51] again that that atonement played two
[52:54] parts it was for the healing of the body
[52:57] but also the healing of the soul it was
[53:00] for the salvation of the soul as well as
[53:03] it was for the healing of the body that
[53:05] atonement saw the suffering of Christ
[53:08] for the judgement for the sick for we
[53:10] know that the serpent spoke of the
[53:12] atonement Jesus was that atonement he
[53:15] was that price paid to redeem us back to
[53:20] him as Moses lifted up the brass serpent
[53:23] the wilderness so must the Son of Man be
[53:25] lifted up for the same purpose why they
[53:29] had sinned and had got sick that was for
[53:32] the taking away of their sins and for
[53:35] their sickness praise the Lord
[53:37] there is your atonement does the same
[53:40] thing today it is for our soul and it is
[53:44] for physical sickness God makes a way of
[53:48] escape I hope you can see that the
[53:50] parallel that I did when the Lord showed
[53:52] this to me even though I had gone
[53:54] through this brass serpent before when
[53:57] you showed me this in comparison of
[53:59] what's going on today I thought of mine
[54:01] that's that's just it's just perfect to
[54:05] me and it's just right on and it
[54:07] enhances by today's world and the way
[54:13] things going the fact that we are at the
[54:14] end was the taking away of their sins
[54:19] for their sickness and that is what
[54:21] Jesus was wounded for our transgressions
[54:23] with His stripes we were healed
[54:26] they divine healing away from Christ you
[54:28] cut the atonement in half but we don't
[54:31] take it away from Christ because he it
[54:34] is him it is a part of who he is
[54:36] but when you see the comparison look at
[54:40] the faith that there has to be we talked
[54:43] about James we just read the prayer of
[54:45] faith can look over in Matthew you can
[54:52] see how mark 16 and laid hands on the
[54:55] sick they shall recover and all those
[54:57] are outstanding scriptures that we have
[55:01] but you know the best example of faith
[55:04] for Gentile faith not Jew faith not
[55:07] Jewish faith faith as the people here as
[55:09] God had them the atonement but the faith
[55:12] of the Gentile you look at this interior
[55:13] and in Matthew 8 I've spoken on it many
[55:16] times but brother Branham pointed to it
[55:19] many times as the Gentile faith what is
[55:22] the Gentile faith the Gentile faith is I
[55:24] don't need you and I'm not worthy that
[55:26] you come under my roof you just speak
[55:29] the word Jesus you speak the word cause
[55:32] Jesus was willing to come to the man's
[55:34] house and the Centurion said no I'm not
[55:36] worthy I bet you come under my roof you
[55:40] have subjects to come and go I have
[55:42] subjects they come and go but you just
[55:44] speak the word and by the authority on
[55:47] this the ones that I have that I speak
[55:50] to that they have to obey my voice that
[55:52] they come and go they got to do what I
[55:54] tell them well your subjects Jesus when
[55:57] you speak to them they've got to come
[55:59] they've got to go they've got to do
[56:00] whatever you say so you just speak the
[56:02] word and my servant will be well because
[56:05] the ones that's made him sick they're
[56:08] subject to you in all just think about
[56:12] the demons and demonic spirits that are
[56:15] subject to the bride of Jesus Christ for
[56:18] today
[56:19] you speak the word you have the faith to
[56:24] say it is it is fit
[56:26] in Jesus name it's it's done it's a
[56:30] finished work
[56:30] you are the standard bearer for today by
[56:34] your faith in believing that Centurion
[56:37] said you speakin and those that make my
[56:40] servants sick will have to obey what you
[56:42] say because there are subjects of yours
[56:44] are under your subjection anyway Jesus
[56:48] spoke the word actually Jesus spending
[56:50] his faith word he just told the center
[56:52] he said I've never seen faith like this
[56:54] no I'm not in anywhere not in Israel
[56:56] anywhere I've never seen this kind of
[56:58] thing you go home and find your servant
[57:00] well your servant owe me well when you
[57:02] get home hey how simple how simple but
[57:08] it's not for everybody you know it's for
[57:10] the believer it's only for the believer
[57:13] when the believer looked at it he was
[57:17] healed because he recognized the
[57:19] atonement he recognized the price that
[57:21] was paid for him even Jesus disciples in
[57:25] Matthew 17 and they were going about
[57:27] twist you God Jesus gave them power in
[57:29] Matthew 10 to go heal the sick and raise
[57:31] the dead and do all these great miracles
[57:33] and things and sent to the children
[57:35] house visceral and they come back
[57:37] rejoicing all the the Devils are subject
[57:40] unto us unto your name and things and he
[57:42] said don't rejoice at that but rejoice
[57:45] because your name is written in heaven
[57:46] cuz of course Jesus was there and his
[57:48] name wasn't there and he was out praying
[57:50] for them and getting healed and all
[57:51] those like the rest of them Judas was
[57:53] remember he was justified and sanctified
[57:55] so all these works were working in his
[57:58] life but when he come to being able to
[57:59] go and receive the Holy Ghost and the
[58:01] furtherance of Christ he hung himself so
[58:04] Christ out hung himself so he couldn't
[58:05] go but then when Jesus said that Matthew
[58:09] 17 they run across a lunatic boy and
[58:12] they couldn't heal him and the man of
[58:15] the boy comes and said and come to Jesus
[58:17] said I asked your disciples and they
[58:20] prayed and prayed they can't do anything
[58:21] for him could you please help my son
[58:23] because somebody's falls in the fire he
[58:25] falls in the water and I'm scared he's
[58:27] gonna kill himself Jesus looked at his
[58:30] own disciples and said o faithless and
[58:32] perverse generation how long
[58:35] to be with you how long are you gonna
[58:37] live like this and add this lack of
[58:39] faith
[58:40] oh but sometimes I think Saints a duck
[58:43] looks and says sometimes the same things
[58:46] does how long it's just simple faith
[58:51] it's just simple simply believing you
[58:55] know brother Roger does the mark 16
[58:57] prayer line lay hands on the sick and
[58:59] they shall recover you come through the
[59:00] prayer line don't say a word
[59:02] necessarily this lay hands them don't
[59:05] pray for me let me go through how many
[59:07] healings have have manifested what was
[59:09] its faith its faith believe me the hands
[59:12] is just a point of contact but if you
[59:15] can have faith to believe that's all it
[59:16] takes faith to believe that's what if
[59:19] they needed in the wilderness when they
[59:21] looked at the brass serpent that's what
[59:24] we need today when we look at our
[59:25] torment when we look at our torment
[59:27] Jesus Christ
[59:28] it just takes pure unadulterated
[59:31] unfettered faith what he's done already
[59:35] for us because a God early God's already
[59:39] guilty God save me God's already saved
[59:41] you you just come to the reckon
[59:43] recognition that God is already built
[59:46] God has already saved you everything he
[59:48] needs to do for you is already done so
[59:50] we believe even though we're living in
[59:53] the middle of judgment God has already
[59:55] sent an atonement garden God has already
[59:58] sent the way of escape amen
[1:00:00] we just believe it just believe it Amen
[1:00:04] praise the lord god bless you today pray
[1:00:08] something was said to bless and
[1:00:09] strengthen you amen just trust the lord
[1:00:12] hold true to it and we'll just believe
[1:00:15] in being contact through the week and
[1:00:18] maybe again next week i'll see you about
[1:00:22] during the week we got a couple jobs
[1:00:23] coming up and things we'll see during
[1:00:26] the week if I have a little message I
[1:00:28] can't do too long of a message on my
[1:00:30] phone because it takes so long to upload
[1:00:32] doing a doing 18 20 minute little a
[1:00:36] sermon end that that I upload to the
[1:00:39] drive for Micah to put on the website
[1:00:40] takes over an hour hour and a half just
[1:00:43] to get it off my phone onto the
[1:00:45] drive so it'd take probably four hours
[1:00:48] if I did a message like this on there so
