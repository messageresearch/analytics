[39:27] keep singing it so I did amen I can
[39:30] trust in him amen I'm thankful to know
[39:33] he can trust in me yes but you know it's
[39:37] just his way of telling me he loves me
[39:38] that I trust him
[39:40] praise the Lord so if that seems strange
[39:43] to you wasn't me
[39:45] uh the words just came out
[39:48] and I'm saying that song a hundred times
[39:49] but I'm so thankful that we can trust in
[39:52] him amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm so
[39:56] thankful God is so good is he amen let's
[40:00] stand to our feet if we could amen go
[40:03] ahead and change the world the service
[40:04] open up our Bibles
[40:07] [Music]
[40:09] amen
[40:11] praise the Lord
[40:13] God is so mindful of us yes he loves us
[40:16] so much Saints it's something that the
[40:19] world just can't understand
[40:21] you know sometimes it's something that
[40:24] even Christians don't understand
[40:27] sometimes I don't understand it but I
[40:31] don't recall the Lord ever asking me if
[40:34] I understood it
[40:36] amen I don't recall him ever asking me
[40:38] do you understand this
[40:41] but he has asked me repeatedly do you
[40:45] believe this amen praise the Lord not to
[40:49] say yes Lord I do believe it thank you
[40:52] I do believe it amen and that's still
[40:55] the rallying cry today do we believe it
[40:57] do we have the faith to know and believe
[41:00] that what he's doing with our lives is
[41:02] for the best for us
[41:04] amen sometimes we create our own issues
[41:07] sometimes we create our own problems the
[41:10] lord always makes everything work out
[41:12] together for our good amen because we
[41:15] love him amen and that's just his way of
[41:18] telling me he loves me yes praise the
[41:21] Lord every day so let's turn in our
[41:23] Bibles now to First Peter chapter one
[41:28] amen
[41:29] I know some things were happening and I
[41:33] want you to know that the lord gave me
[41:35] this message when I was in North
[41:36] Carolina we went to a different Church a
[41:39] brother I'd never been to before went to
[41:41] hear a brother I'd heard before brother
[41:42] Mike actually Mike Holloway came and
[41:45] preached for us over on Cortaro we were
[41:47] over there black brother uh very I
[41:50] enjoyed precious brother he did the
[41:53] cover for my book for free uh precious
[41:57] brother a good Minister I enjoy his
[41:58] ministry very much I've been trying to
[42:00] get him out here ever since uh we keep
[42:02] talking about it but he had some heart
[42:04] problems lately and I thought he was
[42:06] going to have to have a
[42:08] a valve replacement but they wanted to
[42:12] cut him open instead of going through a
[42:14] vein to do it and he's like no and he
[42:16] found out somewhere he could change his
[42:18] diet and it would help him and so he
[42:20] went to basically I guess what you call
[42:22] a vegan diet and that's changed his
[42:25] heart
[42:26] that's gone back to the doctor and
[42:28] doctor said your heart's fine now and
[42:31] then he said and then he said well his
[42:33] heart's fine so he went back to kind of
[42:36] eating the way he was went back to the
[42:38] doctor doctor says come back so he's
[42:40] kind of committed himself to that diet
[42:42] that's keeping his heart in that
[42:44] condition so I say that because uh we
[42:48] kind of had some plans we hadn't put
[42:49] anything out but uh plans for him to
[42:52] come and he had this issue and so
[42:54] hopefully we're going to try and tell
[42:57] them look if you don't come this month
[42:58] or at least by April don't come till
[43:01] November uh I try to tell people that
[43:05] um people can do whatever they want and
[43:08] it falls within their schedule to do
[43:09] however they want but I remember the
[43:11] Tabernacle I had people coming from the
[43:13] Congo every year and they would come in
[43:15] July every year and it would come with a
[43:17] half a bottle of water the little
[43:19] Heights Sabino Canyon in July okay so I
[43:21] had to bring a whole case almost to make
[43:24] sure everybody had water but it was
[43:26] always in July everybody wanted I said
[43:28] why is everybody want to come in July to
[43:30] go hiking in the desert I don't know but
[43:33] um he's going to try to come
[43:36] uh but I went to this church to hear
[43:38] while I was sitting there I started
[43:40] reading the scripture and the Lord put
[43:42] this thought on my heart uh so I trust
[43:45] it's a blessing to you today First Peter
[43:47] chapter one we're going to read a few
[43:49] verses of scripture here but before we
[43:51] do let's just fire heads for word of
[43:53] Prayer

[44:10] my thinking and my mental capacity
[44:13] everything that I can attain to

[44:16] claim to be or brag about Lord is
[44:18] nothing but you in my life and I'm
[44:20] thanking you for it we all thank you
[44:22] Father for those blessings that you give
[44:24] us every day we know Lord that your hand

[44:33] and sometimes it's on our posterior but
[44:36] Lord either way we're thankful for it
[44:38] wherever it is Lord whether we need some
[44:41] correction or whether we need a pat on
[44:44] the back or whether we need picking up
[44:46] or whether we need a trial or whatever
[44:48] we need Lord we need it because we know
[44:50] that you know that is best for us yes we
[44:52] trust in you Lord
[44:54] there's got to be a theme there there's
[44:57] got to be a reason why you change that
[44:59] verse for us here today I don't know uh
[45:02] but Lord we just want to let you know
[45:04] God in our hearts today we trust you we
[45:07] believe you and all that you do for us

[46:14] Peter chapter 1 to begin reading let's
[46:16] just start with verse one I was going to
[46:18] start a little later in here but let's
[46:20] just start with verse one
[46:22] got to reading it again this morning and
[46:24] I felt inspired so let's just uh Peter
[46:26] an apostle of Jesus Christ and the
[46:28] strangers scattered throughout pontus
[46:31] gate Glacier Cappadocia Asia and bit
[46:35] Nina Nia elect according to the
[46:38] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[46:41] sanctification of the spirit unto
[46:43] obedience's sprinkling of the blood of
[46:45] Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be
[46:48] multiplied
[46:49] blessed be the God and father of our
[46:51] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[46:54] abundant Mercy hath begotten us again
[46:57] unto a lively Hope by the resurrection
[47:00] of Jesus Christ from the dead
[47:03] to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[47:06] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[47:09] reserved in heaven for you oh praise God
[47:13] Amen
[47:17] who are kept
[47:19] by the power of God through faith under
[47:22] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[47:25] last time
[47:26] wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now
[47:30] for a season if need be ye are in
[47:33] heaviness through manifold temptations
[47:36] that the trial of your faith being much
[47:39] more precious than of gold that
[47:41] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[47:44] might be found unto praise and honor and
[47:47] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[47:50] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[47:53] though now ye see him not yet believing
[47:56] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[47:59] full of Glory receiving the end of your
[48:02] faith even the salvation of your souls
[48:06] you can be seated if you'd like
[48:09] this is
[48:16] amen
[48:17] an inheritance incorruptible
[48:19] undefiled and Faded not away has been
[48:23] reserved in heaven for you
[48:27] praise God
[48:29] that's probably a nice little uh cap on
[48:32] the end of our last 22 Services amen of
[48:35] a new beginning praise the Lord has been
[48:38] reserved in heaven for you but I want to
[48:39] go to the sixth verse uh I want to we
[48:42] want to concentrate now on kind of the
[48:44] uh the sixth and seventh verse wherein
[48:47] ye greatly Rejoice thank God Amen it's
[48:51] reserved in heaven for us why would we
[48:53] not rejoice
[48:54] we greatly Rejoice though now for a
[48:57] season if need be
[48:59] if need be you are in heaviness through
[49:03] manifold temptations that the trial of
[49:06] your faith being much more precious than
[49:08] of gold that is that perish it though it
[49:11] be tried with fire might be found unto
[49:13] praise and honor and Glory at the
[49:15] peering of Jesus Christ so I'm going to
[49:17] title this today the trials of our faith
[49:20] the trials of our faith as we read it
[49:23] here and how many of us know of course
[49:25] through the scripture that is it is it
[49:28] is expedient for us it has expounded us
[49:31] it has told us through the scripture of
[49:33] how important these things are to our
[49:35] lives but the the issue of faith is what
[49:39] had been mulling around in my heart and
[49:41] in my mind for for several weeks now to
[49:44] to speak on something of faith and I
[49:47] kind of had uh went back and something
[49:49] I'd spoke on before about continuing for
[49:52] the faith and we may yet at some point
[49:54] get to that again I'm not sure because
[49:56] it's still something that's in my mind
[49:57] but when I started reading this the Lord
[50:00] took the faith in a different direction
[50:01] uh as I said to you the other Wednesday
[50:04] night I was sitting in North Carolina at
[50:05] that church and was listening uh but
[50:08] when I sat there it didn't his message
[50:10] didn't Inspire this uh but it was the
[50:13] Lord
[50:15] the thing I did not tell you earlier is
[50:17] that after I read those scriptures and
[50:19] the Lord spoke to me through them about
[50:22] bringing this forth once I got back here
[50:24] that the brother spoke on on basically
[50:27] the same subject
[50:29] uh and he had no idea uh neither one of
[50:32] us had he died of course how could we
[50:34] the Lord just showed it to me when I was
[50:35] sitting there on the seat waiting for
[50:37] him to come out to preach and when he
[50:39] came out he actually read from first
[50:42] Peter but it was a different scripture
[50:43] but basically took the same line of
[50:45] thought amen it was it just spoke
[50:48] volumes to me that it was something that
[50:50] the Lord was speaking not just to me but
[50:52] to him as well it's something that we
[50:55] need to prepare ourselves for and
[50:57] understand we as Christians sometimes we
[51:00] think well God is so good yes he is but
[51:02] God is a just God and God is a righteous
[51:05] God and God is a faithful God and and in
[51:08] all these things that God is sometimes
[51:10] the uh the the the road isn't paved with
[51:14] a flowery bed of ease sometimes that
[51:16] road is a difficult Road sometimes that
[51:19] Road's a challenging Road sometimes that
[51:21] uh road is a trying road but as Peter
[51:24] tells us here the trial of our faith
[51:27] amen it's a trial of our faith that's
[51:31] where the Lord moved this over to in
[51:34] being a trial of our faith now we know
[51:36] what faith is faith is something that is
[51:38] of the Unseen that we just have faith to
[51:41] believe that something exists or that
[51:43] something is I have faith that when I
[51:45] get in my car and I crank it it's going
[51:47] to get me to where I want to go I have
[51:49] faith when I walk out the door and I
[51:50] flip the light switch the lights are
[51:52] going to go off I have faith that when I
[51:53] wake up in the morning my heart's still
[51:55] going to be beating and my brain's still
[51:56] going to be moving and my lungs are
[51:58] still going to be breathing I have faith
[52:00] every day to believe what we believe as
[52:02] we walk in this wall that the Lord's
[52:04] give us but there's a there's another
[52:06] step of faith that we reach that we
[52:09] believe and trust in the god fully trust
[52:12] in The God Who we have never seen except
[52:15] for one another that we've never seen
[52:18] that we in most of us at least have
[52:20] never audibly spoken with
[52:23] amen live to ear audibly I mean we speak
[52:26] to him all the time he speaks to us all
[52:28] the time but audibly lift the ear to to
[52:32] tickle the uh senses that can contacts
[52:36] our flesh our hearing amen our our
[52:39] speaking or seeing those things are
[52:42] denied but it was it's for the purpose
[52:44] that we have faith in who God is it's
[52:48] it's it's more than just a simple faith
[52:51] of trusting again like the light switch
[52:54] uh more than just a simple faith of a
[52:57] car or or your your door at home or
[53:00] something like that to uh a faith that
[53:03] that builds us let me ask you has
[53:06] anybody ever woke up in the morning and
[53:10] not expected the sun to rise or even
[53:12] give it a second thought
[53:15] anybody
[53:16] you ever wake up in the morning and say
[53:19] oh the sun's not gonna come up today
[53:21] anybody
[53:22] I don't know if there's anybody ever
[53:24] through the history of humanity this
[53:26] ever woke up and said all the sun's not
[53:27] gonna come up today
[53:29] no you know the sun's gonna come up why
[53:33] the world knows the sun's going to come
[53:35] up why unbelievers atheists agnostics
[53:39] people who worship all kinds of
[53:41] different gods they know the sun's gonna
[53:43] come up why
[53:45] because it's come up every single day of
[53:49] their life without fail without struggle
[53:52] without worry without calling for it it
[53:56] comes up every day most people probably
[53:59] all of us at least at some point or so
[54:01] many days in a year don't even give it a
[54:04] second thought that the sun came up
[54:06] today
[54:07] amen you know there'll be a day where
[54:09] the sun won't come up
[54:11] but every day we think about it that
[54:14] that it does it comes up and we don't
[54:17] even think about it right
[54:19] right it just does well that's just
[54:21] faith
[54:22] and God does the same thing
[54:25] at the Deep you get in the Lord and the
[54:28] more you trust the Lord and the more you
[54:30] become like him and the more he speaks
[54:33] to you and the more you become to know
[54:35] him and through his word it's just like
[54:38] the exercise of the sun coming up every
[54:41] day my god without fail has always been
[54:45] there for me without fail he has always
[54:49] blessed me he has always helped me he is
[54:51] always you say Well it may not have
[54:54] always been the way I expected it it may
[54:56] not have always been the way I wanted it
[54:58] but he always has
[55:00] that's why
[55:02] there's a test on that Faith there's got
[55:06] to be a trial of our faith now let's go
[55:09] back and look in the sixth verse see
[55:11] what it says here because this is one
[55:13] thing
[55:14] as I read this it struck me that kind of
[55:17] is blanketing the world today I mean
[55:20] literally blankening the world to people
[55:24] look at this wherein you greatly Rejoice
[55:27] amen yes we do because we know and we're
[55:29] thankful for that though now for a
[55:30] season
[55:31] if need be ye are in heaviness
[55:36] through manifold Temptations why because
[55:39] of the trials of our faith amen this
[55:42] walk's not an easy walk and people look
[55:45] and say well why would God do that why
[55:47] would God allow that why would God see
[55:49] you believe in God and he took your
[55:51] firstborn
[55:53] there's a reason for that my faith kicks
[55:56] in and says God
[55:58] the lord giveth the lord taketh away
[56:01] blessed be the name of the Lord right
[56:03] people say how can you how can you
[56:04] believe a god like that how can you
[56:06] trust a God Like That that's just one
[56:09] small instance in an entire lifetime of
[56:12] trusting God in everything I do yeah
[56:14] amen not to mention the fact and I
[56:17] honestly now don't get me wrong I I
[56:19] don't mean this in a bad way but anytime
[56:22] anymore I start hearing about children
[56:25] that are killed murdered died before the
[56:27] age of 12. I'm sorrowful in my heart but
[56:30] I start rejoicing
[56:32] honestly do you ask my wife she may have
[56:35] seen me in time uh when when we're
[56:38] talking about a little kid that's gotten
[56:40] killed or something and I said yes but
[56:42] they're with the Lord Jesus right that's
[56:44] right they're going to be there yeah
[56:46] yeah they may not be bride they may not
[56:49] be in that City amen they may not go
[56:51] into Rapture but they will be in heaven
[56:53] they will be granted eternal life I said
[56:56] then what better thing could you ask for
[56:59] he's gone it's horrible you think about
[57:01] the children if they die or sick or
[57:04] murdered whatever it might be but if
[57:07] they've not come to the age of
[57:08] accountability since they're going to be
[57:10] with God right that they're they are
[57:12] going to be granted lives
[57:14] then what you could you say oh I want
[57:17] him to grow up that's fine but what if
[57:19] they growed up to be ahead uh he's an
[57:21] unbeliever and you end up going to hell
[57:23] wasn't it better for them to have gone
[57:26] then
[57:27] yes amen well to me it is oh yeah yeah
[57:30] you know you think about those things
[57:32] that
[57:33] that molds over in my mind because of
[57:37] how important it is that we understand
[57:38] the end result is more important than
[57:41] what we're going through right now
[57:43] the end result of what see our son is
[57:46] with the Lord Jesus
[57:48] and and we will see him again that's the
[57:51] promise we know that yes amen I do I
[57:53] miss the pleasure of having him here
[57:55] with us absolutely but the Lord blessed
[57:58] us with two beautiful other children and
[58:00] now some beautiful grandchildren and and
[58:02] uh well I mean what else could the God's
[58:06] just been so good you still trust him
[58:09] but look
[58:11] at no time going through this trial is
[58:15] it pleasurable
[58:17] there aren't very many Smiles happening
[58:20] when you're in the middle of a heavy
[58:22] trial
[58:23] and what does it do hear what he says
[58:25] Peter says though ye are in heaviness
[58:30] through manifold Temptation if you look
[58:32] that word up look what heaven is
[58:33] heaviness is grief
[58:36] despair
[58:38] sorrow
[58:40] depression
[58:41] a heaviness is a type of depression
[58:44] that's a blanket that seems to be
[58:46] blanketing the world today
[58:48] amen I don't know how many trillions of
[58:51] dollars the the uh medicine companies
[58:55] make off of prescribing things for
[58:58] depression yeah yeah but it's it is it
[59:01] is an overwhelming uh all-consuming
[59:05] around the world Spirit that's consuming
[59:09] people and it happens it happens even to
[59:12] Christians heaviness though what it's
[59:14] called Speeders not talking to the world
[59:16] he's talking to the Christian heaviness
[59:19] depression sorrow grief
[59:23] amen that's a natural human emotion but
[59:27] with that grief comes faith
[59:30] amen because that's just the trial of
[59:32] our faith through manifold Temptation
[59:34] that's just manifold is various and
[59:37] numerous
[59:39] uh trials various trials numerous trials
[59:43] things that will test us things that
[59:45] will test our faith
[59:47] do you really believe what you say you
[59:50] believe
[59:51] see God knows because there's nothing he
[59:55] doesn't know but sometimes we may not
[59:58] know for sure we think we do sometimes
[1:00:00] but do we really and it only is exposed
[1:00:04] through the firing trials that God sends
[1:00:07] our way through the trials of our faith
[1:00:09] is this trial it's going through this
[1:00:11] trial is my faith gonna hold up through
[1:00:14] this trial
[1:00:15] this trial may be so uh Grievous that we
[1:00:20] feel like that our lives are going to be
[1:00:21] taken from us
[1:00:23] but is God testing us yes are we going
[1:00:26] to leave him are we going to trust him
[1:00:28] we all go through it every one of us
[1:00:31] amen some may be worse than others some
[1:00:35] may be not quite as bad some may be more
[1:00:37] numerous than others maybe some not so
[1:00:40] much but everybody's different but God's
[1:00:43] trying to bring all of us to the same
[1:00:46] place yeah amen the same place to
[1:00:50] believe in a Rapture a body change
[1:00:52] that's going to take us out of this
[1:00:54] place because that's the ultimate end of
[1:00:56] our faith right amen because once that's
[1:00:59] over what will be the need of Faith
[1:01:01] right when we get over there we're not
[1:01:03] going to need faith
[1:01:05] everything that faith is hoping for and
[1:01:08] believing for is going to be there yeah
[1:01:10] yeah praise God so the capping ending of
[1:01:13] our faith those trials are bringing us
[1:01:16] to that place
[1:01:17] every morning your tribe you don't know
[1:01:20] it we don't recognize it don't even give
[1:01:22] it a second thought most of the time or
[1:01:24] try it every morning as to whether the
[1:01:26] sun's going to come up or not
[1:01:28] because we don't know
[1:01:30] nobody knows for absolute positively
[1:01:33] that the sun's gonna come up in the
[1:01:35] morning nobody does
[1:01:36] scientists will tell you and
[1:01:38] scientifically prove it well there's
[1:01:40] probably a
[1:01:44] 99.9999999999 chance it's going to
[1:01:48] because it has for how many years now
[1:01:51] but there's no guarantee
[1:01:53] and there's no guarantee for any of us
[1:01:55] that the sun's going to come up for us
[1:01:57] tomorrow
[1:01:58] none of us are promised tomorrow
[1:02:01] but we are promised that by faith we can
[1:02:04] believe that whatever he's doing these
[1:02:06] trials are working to our faith to bring
[1:02:10] our faith to the place where we believe
[1:02:12] what do we need God do I really believe
[1:02:15] what I what I think I believe
[1:02:18] I believe it I'm telling you here I
[1:02:20] believe it and then when a trial hits
[1:02:22] how many people have you heard of that
[1:02:25] when they get a fiery trial when
[1:02:26] something comes in and it's a hard trial
[1:02:30] and and all of a sudden next thing you
[1:02:31] know off they go
[1:02:34] where are they
[1:02:36] they quit coming to church I don't know
[1:02:38] that they quit reading their Bibles they
[1:02:40] quit praying do they just quit God where
[1:02:43] do they go what happened
[1:02:45] just a trial that comes because God
[1:02:48] wants to know or you need to know
[1:02:49] actually you need to know where you are
[1:02:52] with God God is this is this trial
[1:02:55] that's so rough is it gonna
[1:02:56] be away from you or is it going to draw
[1:02:59] me closer to you like the song says
[1:03:01] that's right like the song says I won't
[1:03:03] question trials that bring me to my
[1:03:06] knees
[1:03:07] amen because in all my needs is where I
[1:03:10] find the Solace that I need and the
[1:03:13] faith that raises to meet that challenge
[1:03:15] to believe that God this is just this is
[1:03:18] just a bump of the road amen a bump in
[1:03:21] the road that's going to take me
[1:03:22] continue me down the correct path that
[1:03:25] I'm supposed to go for you when you go
[1:03:27] down the road or you go through your
[1:03:28] neighborhood when you come to a speed
[1:03:30] bump you don't stop turn around and go
[1:03:32] back out
[1:03:33] you just go over it
[1:03:35] amen it may be a low speed bump it may
[1:03:38] be a big speed bump but either way you
[1:03:40] go over it you just keep going
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:43] I mean who in their right mind stops to
[1:03:45] the speed bump turns around and goes
[1:03:47] back home or goes back wherever they
[1:03:49] came from
[1:03:50] that doesn't make any sense
[1:03:52] but a lot of people do it when it comes
[1:03:54] to Christianity oh they believe God when
[1:03:56] everything's going
[1:03:57] great and this is you know everything's
[1:03:59] just wonderful and I'm in great health
[1:04:01] and everything's going fine and oh I'm
[1:04:04] just a great powerful I'm a Christian
[1:04:06] filled with faith and then that trial
[1:04:08] hits you know go golfing what's
[1:04:10] happening
[1:04:12] God's trying your faith yes are you who
[1:04:15] you say you are do you really believe
[1:04:17] what you say you believe are you going
[1:04:19] to continue to stand or are you going to
[1:04:21] leave are you continue to hold true to
[1:04:24] God and His words and the virtues of his
[1:04:26] word are you just gonna give up are you
[1:04:28] going to come to the speed bump turn
[1:04:30] around and go back
[1:04:35] keep going forward
[1:04:36] though it may cost me my life whatever
[1:04:40] am I going to keep going it's the trials
[1:04:43] of faith it brings a grief sure it does
[1:04:45] that's a natural human emotion of course
[1:04:48] it brings a grief it can bring a
[1:04:50] depression but that faith that faith
[1:04:53] that that trial has raised our faith up
[1:04:55] again you know brother Graham talked
[1:04:57] about faith having muscles yes right
[1:04:59] brother Madam said Faith had muscles and
[1:05:01] hair on his chest yeah yeah now I know
[1:05:03] how it works for some of you sisters but
[1:05:05] uh that's what he said so I'm just
[1:05:08] repeating what he said but you know what
[1:05:10] he says it's just something of strength
[1:05:12] faith has muscle
[1:05:14] Faith doesn't just lay down and give up
[1:05:16] Faith punches back and says I know that
[1:05:20] my redeemer liveth though the skin worms
[1:05:22] destroy my flesh I will stand and I will
[1:05:25] declare that he is my God Amen and I
[1:05:28] believe him regardless
[1:05:30] faith that's standing up that's trusting
[1:05:33] in God and anybody I know of has gone
[1:05:36] through anything worse than what job did
[1:05:38] but in the last in the worst part of his
[1:05:42] entire life and he lost everything he
[1:05:44] had he sits there on the ash pile of his
[1:05:47] own flesh and he said and his wife asked
[1:05:51] him why don't you just Curse God and die
[1:05:52] and you know that's a lot of what that's
[1:05:55] a lot of what some people do
[1:05:57] amen the trial comes hard and heavy
[1:06:00] God's trying to test them why is he
[1:06:02] doing it he's trying to get your faith
[1:06:03] strengthened so the next trial that's
[1:06:06] even harder you have the strength to
[1:06:08] Bear it and the next trial that's even
[1:06:11] harder you're able to Bear it yeah and
[1:06:13] then you start getting to the place that
[1:06:15] your faith raises up to where the Devil
[1:06:17] Comes God allowed it and you say Buddha
[1:06:21] and you just Crest that wave in every
[1:06:23] wave that comes along you don't care
[1:06:25] about their circumstances look like you
[1:06:28] don't care what anybody else's says you
[1:06:30] don't care what it looks like because
[1:06:31] your faith has crested that way amen it
[1:06:36] doesn't matter what the rest of the
[1:06:37] world says because God is your Redeemer
[1:06:39] God is your portion and when that Faith
[1:06:42] Rises up to that next level God just
[1:06:45] brings another trial hey it gets you
[1:06:47] back to the next level and that each
[1:06:49] trial that happens just brings us that
[1:06:51] much closer that much stronger Amen to
[1:06:54] where when it comes to the end of it
[1:06:55] you're just you're so built with faith
[1:06:59] muscles that would just lead this world
[1:07:02] just leave this planet amen but just
[1:07:05] have a a body change and God take us
[1:07:08] home yes it's trying us First Peter
[1:07:11] chapter four
[1:07:16] Peter chapter 4 verse 12.
[1:07:21] beloved think it not strange listen the
[1:07:24] way Peter puts it they can not strange
[1:07:28] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:07:31] try you
[1:07:33] why it's called a trial
[1:07:35] because it tries you
[1:07:37] but he says thinking not strange
[1:07:40] concerning that fiery trial which has
[1:07:44] tried you or we're just trying you or it
[1:07:46] is to try you
[1:07:48] as though some strange thing has
[1:07:51] happened to you
[1:07:54] he says don't don't think it's strange
[1:07:56] that you're going through a trial
[1:08:00] there's nothing strange about a
[1:08:01] Christian going through a trial
[1:08:04] a trial is a normal part of a
[1:08:06] Christian's experience
[1:08:08] a trial is what strengthens us and
[1:08:12] brings us closer to God Amen a trial is
[1:08:15] supposed to disconnect us from all the
[1:08:19] other dependencies that we have in the
[1:08:21] world all the other things that we trust
[1:08:23] in and believe in and rely on it and I'm
[1:08:26] not saying there's anything wrong with a
[1:08:28] medicine or a doctor I'm not saying that
[1:08:31] but what I am saying is that our bottom
[1:08:34] line number one trial is that we believe
[1:08:37] and trust God Amen amen God Is detaching
[1:08:41] Us from all the dependency of everything
[1:08:43] else amen when all the other rest of the
[1:08:47] world the country at least is becoming
[1:08:50] more and more dependent on exterior uh
[1:08:54] uh gratification
[1:08:56] this bride is getting to the place that
[1:09:00] what she believes and is trusting and
[1:09:02] relying in it is Jesus Christ and Christ
[1:09:05] Alone amen nothing else no one else it's
[1:09:10] all in him amen amen if I don't get a
[1:09:13] social security check from the
[1:09:14] government don't matter to me God Will
[1:09:17] Supply money
[1:09:18] if I don't get one more aspirin or Advil
[1:09:21] doesn't matter to me God knows how to
[1:09:23] heal a headache right if I don't give
[1:09:25] one more doctor's appointment one more
[1:09:27] x-ray or one more test I don't care
[1:09:30] cause God knows how to take care of me
[1:09:33] ganji God's getting rid of all that
[1:09:35] external reliability that we have on
[1:09:38] everything else so that we trust in him
[1:09:39] right amen God is the one that's taking
[1:09:43] care of us not the world not the
[1:09:45] government don't think it's something
[1:09:46] strange that a trial has come in your
[1:09:50] life
[1:09:50] don't think it says something out of the
[1:09:53] ordinary it is not
[1:09:55] it's very ordinary for a child of God to
[1:09:58] go through many trials in their life
[1:10:01] again some are harder some not so much
[1:10:04] some may seem to go through harder
[1:10:07] trials some people may seem to take a
[1:10:09] trial harder than another person doesn't
[1:10:11] make that person an unbeliever
[1:10:13] that same person just continues to get
[1:10:16] back up and dust themselves off and say
[1:10:19] my God is the god and in him alone will
[1:10:21] I believe Amen period that's the end of
[1:10:25] it
[1:10:26] he is the one that takes care of us
[1:10:28] thinking not strange that the fiery
[1:10:31] trial just like that fiery trial just
[1:10:33] like the gold
[1:10:34] you are more precious than the gold that
[1:10:38] goes through fiery trials and the
[1:10:40] beatings and the and the removing of the
[1:10:42] draws out of that gold you are more
[1:10:44] important more valuable than that goal
[1:10:47] because that gold is going to perish
[1:10:49] but God is doing what he is doing for
[1:10:52] you so you don't perish
[1:10:54] so that we don't go to hell so that we
[1:10:58] don't lose our lives he's he's bringing
[1:11:01] us this place that we believe in him and
[1:11:03] him alone by faith so that we don't get
[1:11:06] destroyed with the devil in all of his
[1:11:08] uh his
[1:11:10] angels and is is minions we don't get
[1:11:14] destroyed with them
[1:11:15] God is sending that Faith fiery trial
[1:11:20] which drives us
[1:11:22] as though some same things happen unto
[1:11:24] you but Rejoice now I know that's hard
[1:11:28] i i people I've heard people get up and
[1:11:30] I've heard ministers even preached and
[1:11:33] said oh you should be happy
[1:11:35] I don't know anybody that's gone through
[1:11:37] a trial like that that was happy about
[1:11:39] it amen
[1:11:41] I don't know of anybody in the middle of
[1:11:44] a trial like that that I when when the
[1:11:47] Lord I'm sorry to keep going back to
[1:11:48] this but this is probably the hardest
[1:11:50] trial I've ever personally gone through
[1:11:52] in my life and and maybe probably my
[1:11:54] wife too but when our son passed away
[1:11:56] and people come up I said yeah praise
[1:11:59] God our son is dead
[1:12:02] do that you're unhappy and smiling we
[1:12:05] were Grievous we were sad we were
[1:12:08] depressed amen it hurts it wasn't
[1:12:12] pleasurable
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:15] but God is the one that took care and of
[1:12:18] course over time you say do you get over
[1:12:20] it no you don't right
[1:12:22] 30 of nine years 30 no I forget forget
[1:12:27] my math
[1:12:28] over 30 years ago
[1:12:30] Mike is about to be 32 and 30
[1:12:33] 33.
[1:12:36] I always try to remember because Joel's
[1:12:38] nine and he was born on George's 25th
[1:12:41] birthday birthday so I have to remember
[1:12:43] 25 and 9.
[1:12:45] thank you there's math
[1:12:47] 34 34 years ago you don't get over it
[1:12:52] amen you don't get over it it's not
[1:12:53] something I I still don't smile and I'm
[1:12:56] happy about you about am I thankful that
[1:12:58] my son is with the Lord of course am I
[1:13:00] thankful we'll get to see him again
[1:13:01] absolutely am I thankful that that trial
[1:13:05] may be stronger with God am I thankful
[1:13:08] that that trial brought me closer to God
[1:13:10] am I thankful that trial brought me and
[1:13:12] my wife closer to God and closer
[1:13:14] together of course I am but there's
[1:13:17] nothing happy about it amen and I've had
[1:13:20] people say rejoice
[1:13:23] oh we Rejoice absolutely in the fact
[1:13:25] that we know that God is working
[1:13:28] everything together for our good right
[1:13:30] amen because we love him
[1:13:33] we love him if you don't love him now it
[1:13:37] doesn't work I've said this to you many
[1:13:38] times because it seems to me I see this
[1:13:41] happen repeatedly with Christians and
[1:13:43] people I've talked to and people that
[1:13:45] know and ministers I've heard preach you
[1:13:47] have to love God unconditionally or this
[1:13:50] does not work right if you don't love
[1:13:53] God unconditionally with his love not
[1:13:57] Ophelia love not not human love but
[1:14:02] God's unconditional gospel love if you
[1:14:04] don't love him unconditionally the
[1:14:06] contract is broken right there that it
[1:14:08] does not work right
[1:14:10] but if you love God with the same love
[1:14:13] that he loves you with man that's
[1:14:15] unconditional and you love him back that
[1:14:18] unconditional love this contract is is
[1:14:20] valid amen and he will make all things
[1:14:24] work together for you so when the trial
[1:14:26] comes you say Lord
[1:14:28] no matter I love you anyway
[1:14:30] when it gets hard and Grievous no matter
[1:14:32] Lord
[1:14:33] though these skin Norms destroy my flesh
[1:14:36] in his body I shall see God for I know
[1:14:38] my redeemer liveth amen
[1:14:41] and he gets harder and harder never than
[1:14:44] mine God will take care of it he always
[1:14:47] does he's making this work because
[1:14:49] somewhere somehow I need this my wife
[1:14:52] went through a lot of Trials when she
[1:14:54] was just a little girl from basically
[1:14:56] from birth yeah
[1:14:58] yeah but as hard as that was and as hard
[1:15:01] as her life basically was until she was
[1:15:03] 18.
[1:15:04] as hard as that was she's been able to
[1:15:07] bless so many people with her testimony
[1:15:09] and things that she's told people and
[1:15:11] how she's helped people when I first
[1:15:13] started preaching she got up everywhere
[1:15:15] I went and gave her testimony 10-15
[1:15:17] minutes worth I talked to the pastor a
[1:15:19] little bit and they said oh my yeah that
[1:15:21] would really bless our
[1:15:23] and I can't tell you how many people
[1:15:24] come up to her and say how much that was
[1:15:26] a blessing to them how much that helped
[1:15:28] them and how much that meant to them see
[1:15:30] you never know
[1:15:32] even with what God has done in this it
[1:15:35] isn't always just for us
[1:15:38] now sometimes we go through things and
[1:15:42] yes the Lord brings it it is our benefit
[1:15:44] but the Lord uses it so that we can help
[1:15:47] others as well
[1:15:49] that we can be a blessing to other
[1:15:51] people and you say Lord do I have to
[1:15:54] suffer this so that I can help so and so
[1:15:56] would you do it
[1:15:58] Lord I don't deserve this trial no you
[1:16:02] don't but you're going to need it to
[1:16:03] help somebody else down the road are you
[1:16:04] willing to take it right how many is
[1:16:07] going to volunteer for that
[1:16:09] amen you don't have to raise your hand
[1:16:10] I'm being serious though how many of you
[1:16:12] would take that
[1:16:13] would willing to go through this hard
[1:16:15] trial just so you can help and influence
[1:16:18] somebody else in a good way in a
[1:16:20] positive way to help that person make
[1:16:23] would you be willing to do it
[1:16:25] well let me ask you a question are you a
[1:16:27] Christian
[1:16:28] okay did Jesus Christ who is the
[1:16:31] foundation of Christianity obviously to
[1:16:33] be Christ's life is to be a Christian
[1:16:35] when he died at Calvary was he a sinner
[1:16:39] had he done anything wrong had he made
[1:16:42] any mistakes did he deserve being
[1:16:45] whipped beat ridiculed and hung on a
[1:16:48] cross and die the most cruel death that
[1:16:51] humans ever died did he deserve it
[1:16:53] no why did he do it because it benefited
[1:16:57] you right yeah because it benefits us he
[1:17:00] did it because he loved us so much he
[1:17:03] was willing to go through that horrible
[1:17:05] death so that we could have Redemption
[1:17:07] so that we can have life so that he
[1:17:11] could come back and live in each and
[1:17:13] every one of us so that we so that he
[1:17:16] would not be alone remember we read the
[1:17:18] other day this is for himself
[1:17:21] that he would not be alone but we his
[1:17:23] bride would be there with him
[1:17:26] praise the Lord
[1:17:27] he deserve it
[1:17:29] it was no way that Jesus deserved
[1:17:32] beating like that and crucifying but he
[1:17:35] did it because he loved you now would
[1:17:36] you be willing to do that for somebody
[1:17:37] else right so that they were helped so
[1:17:40] that they are blessed so that they find
[1:17:42] Christ so that they make it to heaven
[1:17:45] that's a tough question for him but
[1:17:47] sometimes God tries Us in ways that are
[1:17:50] just unexplainable and we just and we
[1:17:53] may not realize it and honestly it
[1:17:55] doesn't matter because there's one thing
[1:17:58] that Faith does not do
[1:18:00] there's several things it doesn't do but
[1:18:02] but there's one major thing that Faith
[1:18:05] does not do it does not question right
[1:18:07] right your faith does not question now
[1:18:10] I'm not saying that you having questions
[1:18:11] sometimes Lord why me or why this or
[1:18:14] amen even brother Brown did that he
[1:18:16] admits saying Lord you know I mean could
[1:18:19] you imagine God his wife dying and then
[1:18:23] his daughter dying and brother random
[1:18:25] cries out to God and a black sheep comes
[1:18:27] and falls
[1:18:34] the prophet the prophet of God
[1:18:37] who was the example of of what this age
[1:18:40] this bride was to bring forth in this
[1:18:43] last day to to make a rapture
[1:18:47] through the word and what was sacrifice
[1:18:49] and given and he goes before God and God
[1:18:52] drops a black sheep
[1:18:54] how many of us would think oh well I
[1:18:56] must not be a Christian God's not
[1:18:57] listening to me God doesn't care about
[1:18:59] me I must have crossed that line no no
[1:19:02] he had not crossed that line Saints amen
[1:19:07] he had not but he learned a lesson yeah
[1:19:09] could have been possibly hardest trial
[1:19:12] of his life but he learned a lesson amen
[1:19:14] God called in something and from that
[1:19:16] day on he never made that same mistake
[1:19:19] again I've said many times that when I'm
[1:19:21] at a job or doing doing something I
[1:19:24] learn almost as much what not to do is
[1:19:26] what to do
[1:19:27] amen I I I do because
[1:19:31] when mistakes are made or you see
[1:19:33] somebody make a mistake or you make a
[1:19:34] mistake and you you think well I made
[1:19:36] that mistake that mistake won't happen
[1:19:38] again
[1:19:39] now some people are hard-headed and they
[1:19:42] do it again but I try not to I try you
[1:19:46] don't make the same mistake again
[1:19:48] because you learn from it you learn from
[1:19:50] your trials the Lord has Us in this
[1:19:53] fiery trial so that we learn
[1:19:55] amen that we grow look
[1:19:59] but rejoice in as much in as much as ye
[1:20:03] are partakers of Christ's sufferings
[1:20:06] that when his glory shall be revealed
[1:20:09] you may be glad also with exceeding Joy
[1:20:13] amen are we going to trust him yes
[1:20:16] that's the number one question are we
[1:20:19] going to trust him let's go over to
[1:20:20] James I got a couple more scriptures I
[1:20:23] want to read
[1:20:26] are we going to give up
[1:20:28] are we going to walk away
[1:20:29] are we going to trust him
[1:20:31] amen look friends are we still in our
[1:20:35] human flesh
[1:20:36] then the trials aren't over right
[1:20:40] amen the trials are going to get
[1:20:43] dares I say more frequent and harder
[1:20:47] especially the closer we get to this end
[1:20:49] time and we are we are here we know that
[1:20:51] and everybody keeps talking about it
[1:20:54] here even people across the country and
[1:20:55] sometimes even people that don't claim
[1:20:57] to be Christian talk about how how bad
[1:21:00] it is and how close it must be to the
[1:21:03] end of course A lot of times people just
[1:21:04] use the word Armageddon or something
[1:21:06] because they just don't know any better
[1:21:08] which is I mean it will it then we'll
[1:21:11] get to that point but that's what they
[1:21:13] know but don't realize what it's going
[1:21:16] to take to put us in the position the
[1:21:18] shape spiritually by faith to be able to
[1:21:22] Crest each one of those ways
[1:21:24] when the Devil comes in like a standard
[1:21:26] God like a flood God raise the standard
[1:21:29] against them every week uh crashed each
[1:21:34] one of those waves as they come before
[1:21:36] us
[1:21:37] even how high or how more frequent they
[1:21:39] come we Crest every way
[1:21:42] because we rely on God yes God we trust
[1:21:47] in the Lord he helps us in every way
[1:21:49] James chapter 1 verse 1.
[1:21:52] James a servant of God and of the Lord
[1:21:54] Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are
[1:21:57] scattered abroad greedy my brethren
[1:22:00] count it all joy when ye fall into
[1:22:03] diverse Temptations now that doesn't
[1:22:05] mean that you have been tempted to the
[1:22:08] point that you fall to the Temptation it
[1:22:11] could but this means that the Temptation
[1:22:14] has befallen you
[1:22:16] understand it doesn't mean that you fell
[1:22:20] it just means that the Temptation is
[1:22:22] befallen you a Temptation has come on
[1:22:25] you not that you have quit and give up
[1:22:27] and have gone away and fall into that
[1:22:30] trial but it's befallen you you now are
[1:22:33] in the midst of a trial
[1:22:35] counted all joy when you fall into
[1:22:38] diverse Temptations knowing this that
[1:22:42] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:22:44] patience
[1:22:45] amen now I got to be honest the lord
[1:22:49] gave me this because I don't like
[1:22:50] reading this scripture
[1:22:52] because for new minute that means more
[1:22:55] trials
[1:22:56] cause I know I need help with my
[1:22:58] patients
[1:22:59] amen I know I do
[1:23:01] I'm gonna buy the rest of yeah I got one
[1:23:03] or two knotted heads but I don't know
[1:23:05] about the rest of you but I mean I need
[1:23:07] more trial of my faith uh to to uh to
[1:23:11] bring patience because
[1:23:13] I I need more patience God help me to be
[1:23:16] more patient
[1:23:18] and and we say that God helping me more
[1:23:20] patient what does that mean
[1:23:22] more trials amen it's like I heard
[1:23:26] brother Mike I was listening to him like
[1:23:28] I said he preached along the same type
[1:23:30] of subject and you know he said each
[1:23:32] time the Lord sends sends a trial then
[1:23:35] you fail
[1:23:36] he sends it again you fail he sends it
[1:23:40] again you keep failing he sends it again
[1:23:43] amen I was thinking to myself
[1:23:45] it's like it's like coming you have a
[1:23:48] little patience in traffic which I do
[1:23:50] have very little patience in traffic I'm
[1:23:53] sorry just confessing my fault to you
[1:23:55] pray for me
[1:23:57] um but it's like coming to a stoplight
[1:23:59] you just can't wait for that light it's
[1:24:00] probably not more than 35 seconds but
[1:24:02] you just can't wait for that light to
[1:24:04] change and then you go flying and you
[1:24:06] think oh I failed that test you know
[1:24:08] what's going to happen the next life's
[1:24:09] gonna be red
[1:24:10] okay I'm gonna try you again
[1:24:14] just makes it you either get more angry
[1:24:16] and frustrated or you say Okay God I
[1:24:19] give up
[1:24:21] I'm just gonna go at whatever you're
[1:24:24] giving me and at that pace and it just
[1:24:27] is going to be what it is amen the next
[1:24:30] thing you know every light's green
[1:24:32] amen that's our hands
[1:24:34] you failed the test so the next flight's
[1:24:36] going to be read you fail that test next
[1:24:39] light's going to be red you fail that
[1:24:41] test guess what
[1:24:42] the next life is going to be red
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:46] God's trying to teach us help us learn
[1:24:49] yeah yeah amen the trials of our
[1:24:52] patience of our faith is to work
[1:24:54] patience God help us
[1:24:56] but let but let patience have her
[1:25:00] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:25:03] entire wanting nothing
[1:25:06] amen isn't that where every one of us
[1:25:08] are trying to get to the mature
[1:25:10] Christian and of course that's what the
[1:25:12] power means entire just means complete
[1:25:14] or mature it means you're wanting
[1:25:17] nothing you've grown up spiritually to
[1:25:19] the point that that you've reached an
[1:25:22] apex of uh of of a mature Christian
[1:25:26] when things come your way you don't get
[1:25:28] rattled yeah it may bring a manifold uh
[1:25:32] uh uh a heaviness a grievousness or
[1:25:37] something like that but you just you
[1:25:39] just brush it off and you just keep
[1:25:40] going
[1:25:41] I mean it just depends on what kind of
[1:25:43] Faith you have in the Lord is it going
[1:25:45] to be something that's going to drag you
[1:25:46] down or is it something you just say
[1:25:48] well Lord you know how many times have
[1:25:50] you gone through this
[1:25:52] how many times have I had to put up with
[1:25:54] this how many times has the Lord tempted
[1:25:56] me or tried me with this or allowed this
[1:25:58] to be tried in my life how many times
[1:26:01] and then what Lord what am I going how
[1:26:03] have I developed grown to the point that
[1:26:06] I've gotten to um a place of perfection
[1:26:09] which is mature anyway an entire
[1:26:12] complete wanting nothing
[1:26:15] amen wanting nothing God help us it's
[1:26:20] all to bring us to that point
[1:26:22] and there's none of us exempt from it do
[1:26:25] we like the flowery bed of eats
[1:26:26] absolutely do we enjoy the comfort and
[1:26:30] the flowing along and the going
[1:26:32] absolutely but that's exactly the time
[1:26:34] that Mama Eagle comes and peels out
[1:26:37] another layer of that rabbit skin
[1:26:39] and the next thing you know when that
[1:26:41] eaglet has gotten so comfortable in that
[1:26:43] nest and Mama's come along behind his
[1:26:45] back and ripped out some of that rabbit
[1:26:47] skin he sits back down he hits the thorn
[1:26:49] he's a oh no well that wasn't there
[1:26:52] before
[1:26:54] it's not fun but it's to get him to the
[1:26:57] place that he's not comfortable in that
[1:26:59] nest and he's ready to leave the nest
[1:27:01] and go out and live his own life amen
[1:27:04] God doesn't want us to get comfortable
[1:27:06] here amen he doesn't want us to get
[1:27:08] eased in Zion he doesn't want us to get
[1:27:10] to them they said when it comes to that
[1:27:13] time that we I don't want to go anywhere
[1:27:15] I enjoy it too much here
[1:27:17] my there's nothing about this place I
[1:27:20] desire amen
[1:27:23] about the world we'll just say Cosmos I
[1:27:27] enjoy my life I enjoy all of you and my
[1:27:29] church and my family and the blessings
[1:27:31] the Lord gives oh absolutely but this
[1:27:34] Cosmos this world
[1:27:36] the best thing that we can believe and
[1:27:38] know is that none of this Cosmos as we
[1:27:41] read the other a couple weeks ago is
[1:27:43] going to be a part of that world
[1:27:45] amen it will be done away with scripture
[1:27:48] Luke chapter 22.
[1:27:52] let's look uh I'm gonna close here in
[1:27:54] just a minute
[1:27:57] we'll start in our open
[1:27:59] get our community service here
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:06] Luke chapter 22
[1:28:08] verse 31.
[1:28:15] Luke 22 31 and the Lord said Simon Simon
[1:28:19] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[1:28:23] that he may sift you as weak they did
[1:28:27] the same thing with job you know what he
[1:28:30] does same thing about you
[1:28:31] amen Satan would desire to have you
[1:28:35] each and every one of you Satan would
[1:28:37] desire to have you this just happens to
[1:28:38] be a Biblical lesson that that God was
[1:28:40] speaking to Peter about that we can
[1:28:42] relate to
[1:28:44] Satan has desired to have you that he
[1:28:48] may sift you as wheat do you know what
[1:28:51] that word sift means
[1:28:53] sift means to try one's Faith to the
[1:28:57] point that you're going to want to quit
[1:29:00] Satan desires to have you
[1:29:05] to try you
[1:29:07] that he may try your faith
[1:29:11] to the point that you're going to want
[1:29:13] to quit
[1:29:15] now that's a pretty thin margin
[1:29:19] amen between getting to the point of
[1:29:23] willingly quitting
[1:29:26] or saying God though the skin worms
[1:29:28] destroyed though all is against me
[1:29:31] though I lose everything though
[1:29:33] everything is against me I'm still going
[1:29:36] to believe you
[1:29:37] I'm still going to love you and I'm
[1:29:39] still going to trust you
[1:29:42] but now look what Jesus told Peter
[1:29:45] that he may sift you as we or try your
[1:29:48] faith
[1:29:50] a Jeep but but what Jesus said oh but
[1:29:53] I'm not going to let him have you
[1:29:57] oh but I'm gonna keep this trial from
[1:30:00] coming your way Peter
[1:30:02] he didn't tell him that what did Jesus
[1:30:04] tell him he said but I have prayed for
[1:30:06] thee
[1:30:08] that thy faith fell not
[1:30:11] and when thou art converted strengthen
[1:30:13] the brothers and Jesus didn't say but
[1:30:15] Peter I'm not going to let this happen
[1:30:17] to you Peter I'm not going to let this
[1:30:19] come your way Peter I'm gonna stop the
[1:30:22] devil from allowing that to happen
[1:30:24] didn't say any of that
[1:30:26] he just said I pray for you for you yes
[1:30:28] that when he tries you now pardon me if
[1:30:32] I don't mean to be adding to the word
[1:30:33] but paraphrasing a little if you'd
[1:30:36] indulge me
[1:30:37] that when Satan does try you
[1:30:40] when Satan does get you to the point
[1:30:43] that he is shaking you so badly you're
[1:30:46] going to want to quit
[1:30:47] and give up and walk away
[1:30:49] I have prayed for you that you're saved
[1:30:53] will hold out amen amen praise the Lord
[1:30:57] that's your faith now let's
[1:30:59] start you knew
[1:31:02] Satan has desire to have you shift you
[1:31:05] as we but I prayed for you I know you
[1:31:07] have them
[1:31:09] praise the Lord that your faith will
[1:31:11] hold when you're in
[1:31:13] a rugged shaking that you're going to
[1:31:15] want to quit I pray for you that your
[1:31:18] faith will stand yes amen and that you
[1:31:21] will be able to hold out through
[1:31:23] whatever comes your way and the only
[1:31:25] thing that Satan that Jesus will allow
[1:31:28] that God allows to happen to us uh that
[1:31:32] that Satan brings to us God had to allow
[1:31:35] it yes amen if you're a child of God if
[1:31:38] your heads by God Amen the only way that
[1:31:41] Satan can get to you is if God lets down
[1:31:44] the Hedge
[1:31:45] and if God lets down the Hedge again
[1:31:47] there's there's a reason
[1:31:48] amen Lord the trials of our faith the
[1:31:53] fiery Trials of our faith but Jesus here
[1:31:56] I have prayed for you just put your name
[1:31:59] there amen I pray for you that your
[1:32:01] faith will hold out that you'll be able
[1:32:04] to stand the test that when it's all
[1:32:06] said and done and Satan has done
[1:32:08] everything he could to shake you to your
[1:32:10] very core that you'll stand up and say I
[1:32:14] know my redeemer am I amen my God is God
[1:32:19] yes praise the Lord one more it's First
[1:32:22] Corinthians
[1:32:24] First Corinthians 10 13.
[1:32:29] Amen in First Corinthians 10 13.
[1:32:32] there hath no temptation taken you
[1:32:35] but such as is common to man
[1:32:39] common to man nothing has happened that
[1:32:41] hasn't been common to man but God is
[1:32:44] faithful
[1:32:46] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:32:49] above that ER able
[1:32:52] but will with the Temptation also make a
[1:32:55] way to escape that ye may be able to
[1:32:58] bear it
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:01] my tires on my car out there are
[1:33:05] P.S I would I don't know what they are
[1:33:07] actually but we'll just say PSL PSI 40
[1:33:10] pounds per square inch 40. if I go and
[1:33:13] try to put 100 pounds per square inch in
[1:33:14] that tire you know what's going to
[1:33:15] happen
[1:33:16] it's gonna blow up
[1:33:18] but you know what I'm gonna do when I
[1:33:20] get to 40 I'm going to stop
[1:33:23] I'm not going to allow that tire get to
[1:33:25] the point that it's going to explode
[1:33:27] that it's going to blow up
[1:33:29] God knows every one of us and what we
[1:33:33] are made of
[1:33:34] he knows what every one of us can endure
[1:33:37] he knows what every one of us uh are are
[1:33:40] able to stand
[1:33:42] and he said that he would make a way of
[1:33:45] Escape
[1:33:46] that need that he may be able to bury
[1:33:49] God always makes a way
[1:33:51] praise the Lord in whatever way it is
[1:33:53] God makes that way
[1:33:56] and God does it it's all for that
[1:33:59] purpose amen
[1:34:03] amen
[1:34:05] he always has
[1:34:07] and he always will he makes the way of
[1:34:09] Escape
[1:34:12] he puts us in the place that we're able
[1:34:14] to bear it that we're able to withstand
[1:34:16] it that we're able to go through it by
[1:34:19] his grace praise the Lord
[1:34:22] a friend let's don't think it's strange
[1:34:25] it's not Grievous amen it hurts
[1:34:28] sometimes it's hard to go through
[1:34:30] sometimes yes we do get discouraged but
[1:34:32] it's always for a reason
[1:34:35] amen I've known
[1:34:37] several times I wouldn't necessarily
[1:34:39] identify them now and I think maybe in
[1:34:42] part why God took brother around him
[1:34:44] when he did
[1:34:45] people
[1:34:47] have a tendency to start relying on
[1:34:50] others and other things rather than him
[1:34:54] God if you're a child of God God's not
[1:34:56] going to allow anyone or anything take
[1:34:59] his place yes yes he's not going to
[1:35:01] allow it even if he has to remove that
[1:35:04] person from your life or remove that
[1:35:07] crutch or whatever it is from your life
[1:35:09] he'll do it so that you don't become
[1:35:13] more dependent on that or that person
[1:35:15] than him amen
[1:35:18] God is going to be first
[1:35:21] and we want him to be amen but as humans
[1:35:24] we can so easily slip into that mode
[1:35:28] because it's used the easy way
[1:35:31] it's like the little boy I preached on
[1:35:33] Mother's Day that time it's like a
[1:35:34] little boy who uh who is crying and
[1:35:38] scaring and uh scared because of the
[1:35:40] thunderstorm and all and the mother goes
[1:35:42] upstairs and says what's the matter son
[1:35:44] well I'm scared mom the the Thunder and
[1:35:47] the lightning is flashing and it's
[1:35:48] rumbling the house and she said but yeah
[1:35:51] uh son but you know we believe in God we
[1:35:53] trust in God he's going to take care of
[1:35:55] us he says I know that Mommy but
[1:35:57] sometimes I just need a god with skin on
[1:36:00] amen sometimes I just leave it God with
[1:36:02] someone and then a lot of times we fall
[1:36:04] into that because it's easier
[1:36:07] it's easier
[1:36:08] to believe in something that you can see
[1:36:12] tasteful small here that you can't see
[1:36:15] tastes a little smaller here
[1:36:16] it's just easier to believe that
[1:36:19] we all do that
[1:36:20] but God is going to remove and has
[1:36:23] removed everything
[1:36:25] that would hinder us
[1:36:27] in that capacity that we don't trust and
[1:36:30] believe in him first and foremost
[1:36:33] amen he is number one always will be if
[1:36:37] that trial has to bring us to that place
[1:36:39] that's what he'll do yes amen
[1:36:42] amen but praise the Lord
[1:36:44] through it all
[1:36:46] he'll still make all things work
[1:36:48] together for our good yes
[1:36:50] amen he knows best
[1:36:54] that's why I sang that song I like that
[1:36:56] song
[1:36:57] very much I don't sing it very often
[1:37:00] because I I don't I don't want to get to
[1:37:05] the place that we major upon the trial
[1:37:08] because that's a small little facet of
[1:37:11] our lives but it's an important one
[1:37:13] I haven't spoke on it a long time and I
[1:37:16] think maybe that's why the Lord wanted
[1:37:17] to bring that back because the topic the
[1:37:19] topic of Faith was on my heart strong
[1:37:21] and then the Lord bringing that to help
[1:37:24] us
[1:37:25] with whatever we're going through I
[1:37:27] don't know there's timing behind
[1:37:29] everything yes but as long as God's in
[1:37:32] control of it and I believe he is then
[1:37:34] it's all working according to his
[1:37:36] perfect plan and that's all I care about
[1:37:39] amen his perfect plan I don't know if
[1:37:42] it's something that helps you now maybe
[1:37:44] you're going through something maybe
[1:37:45] you're not I don't know some of you I do
[1:37:48] some of them uh I kind of mostly know
[1:37:52] but sometimes people are kind of private
[1:37:55] about those things they don't want to
[1:37:57] express them or or talk to anybody about
[1:38:00] that and and I respect the person in
[1:38:04] that capacity but you know there's
[1:38:06] something to be said for strength in
[1:38:08] numbers as well and when you got people
[1:38:10] praying for you you got people holding
[1:38:12] you up and bringing you before the Lord
[1:38:15] and giving words of encouragement or
[1:38:17] something it helps yes it helps it helps
[1:38:20] it helps bring us to the place that we
[1:38:23] can endure again it's like the moping
[1:38:26] Eagle you know when the eagle gets into
[1:38:28] his moping stage
[1:38:30] that eagle is done for if he doesn't
[1:38:32] have some of his buddies coming along
[1:38:34] and dropping him some food to help him
[1:38:36] eat that eat that food get your strength
[1:38:39] right amen I love you don't don't get
[1:38:42] down there to where you're not able to
[1:38:44] get back up
[1:38:45] you know and send something to help that
[1:38:48] person
[1:38:49] and bring them back to the strength that
[1:38:51] they're supposed to be in life and it
[1:38:53] helps all of us we all do yes amen
[1:38:56] especially me I was going to say even me
[1:38:58] but especially me
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:01] it's it's a it's a trial it's difficult
[1:39:04] sometimes
[1:39:06] I don't
[1:39:08] I don't bear my burdens alone
[1:39:11] amen but every one of yours is mine
[1:39:15] every everyone here not just sitting
[1:39:18] here now but a part of this church your
[1:39:20] burdens are my burdens
[1:39:22] they all are
[1:39:23] and then and and my wife as well and it
[1:39:27] makes you huge again I've I've pinned
[1:39:30] roses on you before but it makes a huge
[1:39:32] difference
[1:39:33] when you sisters stay in such contact
[1:39:35] with each other and have this prayer
[1:39:37] group and and encourage one another and
[1:39:40] pray it it makes such a it makes I can't
[1:39:43] explain
[1:39:44] what a joy that is to me yes uh what a
[1:39:47] blessing it is to know that y'all do
[1:39:49] that and you did it without instruction
[1:39:51] from a pastor you just did it cause
[1:39:54] Jesus is in your heart and you love one
[1:39:56] another
[1:39:57] that's that's it but that's all it takes
[1:40:01] and then you see the results
[1:40:03] amen God's still working God's still
[1:40:06] moving
[1:40:07] still here working and moving in this
[1:40:09] congregation believe that yeah amen I do
[1:40:13] amen whatever he's got down the road
[1:40:16] whatever he's going to do tomorrow I
[1:40:17] don't know
[1:40:18] it's in his hands yes praise the Lord
[1:40:21] I'm thankful for that and then let's
[1:40:23] stand to our feet if we could
[1:40:33] as you know we
[1:40:36] usually uh
[1:40:38] sing a specific song or preparing our
[1:40:40] hearts and Minds for the communion here
[1:40:42] from the Lord's Supper
[1:40:53] but we probably all know it I think it's
[1:40:55] Psalm 15 of the book 16 excuse me
[1:40:59] cleanse me
[1:41:01] I like to see this before we enter into
[1:41:03] the Lord's Supper
[1:41:05] because you all know how very sacred
[1:41:07] time this is so the dentist mentioned it
[1:41:13] I find it odd as brother Dennis
[1:41:15] mentioned that people would be unwilling
[1:41:18] to take it I guess I can understand why
[1:41:22] I would want to I think change my life
[1:41:24] to the point that I felt like I was in
[1:41:27] the position to take it rather than not
[1:41:29] take it
[1:41:30] because Jesus said if you don't you have
[1:41:32] no part with me
[1:41:34] if you don't take the Lord's Supper
[1:41:37] I mean basically say you're not even a
[1:41:38] Christian you have no part with the Lord
[1:41:41] Jesus if you don't do it right
[1:41:43] so it is
[1:41:45] baffling sometimes but it's also a
[1:41:49] showdown that brother Brown called you
[1:41:52] know the last message he ever preached
[1:41:54] will say message she got up after Tucson
[1:41:57] Tabernacle will say message the
[1:42:00] communion message 12 12 65 was the last
[1:42:03] thing brother Adam
[1:42:05] spoke publicly like this that's recorded
[1:42:08] it was communion
[1:42:10] and that
[1:42:12] itself helps us to understand the
[1:42:15] importance of this and call it a
[1:42:17] showdown
[1:42:18] to where it brings us to the place in
[1:42:20] our lives that we we want to make sure
[1:42:23] that there's no impediments there's no
[1:42:26] struggle nothing in our heart that's
[1:42:28] against God or anyone else we don't want
[1:42:31] anything in our heart against anybody
[1:42:34] hearts and minds are clear to God to our
[1:42:38] fellow man to one another amen we have
[1:42:41] no animosity
[1:42:46] nothing that would cause anything other
[1:42:48] than edifying
[1:42:50] to be a blessing and a hope to someone
[1:42:52] else so we sing this song this is I've
[1:42:55] done this I think ever since I've
[1:42:56] pastored the first church ever pastored
[1:42:59] to sing this song to help us at least
[1:43:02] the first verse of it to help us as we
[1:43:05] go through this moment in time and
[1:43:06] search our hearts to make sure there's
[1:43:08] nothing there
[1:43:09] amen make sure there's nothing in our
[1:43:12] hearts towards God or anybody
[1:43:15] make it right if we can
[1:43:17] before the Lord and before we take this
[1:43:19] communion
[1:43:20] and so let's sing it search our hearts
[1:43:22] don't just sing it let's really search
[1:43:25] our hearts amen
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:49] try me
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:59] know my thoughts
[1:44:01] I pray
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:13] [Applause]

[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:44:51] oh God
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:06] try
[1:45:08] me
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:14] no no my
[1:45:21] I pray
[1:45:27] [Music]

[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:40] in me
[1:45:46] and please
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:46:07] search US Lord Jesus
[1:46:10] show us reveal to us Lord
[1:46:13] if there is anything God
[1:46:15] anything in my heart anything in our
[1:46:17] lives
[1:46:19] that would be an impediment of some kind
[1:46:21] Lord
[1:46:23] of all Jesus
[1:46:26] thank you
[1:46:29] thank you Jesus
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:38] do you want to read the communion
[1:46:40] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:46:47] in verse 23
[1:46:51] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:46:53] which also I delivered unto you
[1:46:55] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:46:58] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[1:47:01] had given thanks he'd break it and said
[1:47:03] take eat take eat this is my body which
[1:47:07] is broken for you
[1:47:09] this do in remembrance of me
[1:47:12] after the same manner also he took the
[1:47:14] cup when he had something
[1:47:16] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:47:19] blood
[1:47:19] this Duty as often as you drink it in
[1:47:22] remembrance of me
[1:47:24] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:47:27] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:47:29] death till he come
[1:47:32] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:47:34] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:47:36] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:47:39] and blood of the Lord
[1:47:42] but let a man examine himself
[1:47:44] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:47:47] drink of that cup
[1:47:49] for either eateth and drinketh
[1:47:51] unworthily he
[1:47:53] Ed his judgment to him self not
[1:47:56] Discerning the Lord's body
[1:47:58] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:48:01] among you and many sleep for if we would
[1:48:04] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:48:08] that when we are judged we are chastened
[1:48:11] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:48:14] condemned with the world
[1:48:16] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:48:18] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:48:20] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:48:23] home that ye come not together unto
[1:48:26] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:48:29] order when I come
[1:48:31] amen
[1:48:36] praise the Lord the Lord said that
[1:48:41] he blessed the bread
[1:48:44] and you bless the wine
[1:48:47] so we're going to do the same thing
[1:48:49] amends with you right now
[1:48:53] amen so let's just start our heads if we
[1:48:55] could
[1:48:57] Lord Jesus
[1:49:00] father this wine in these little cups
[1:49:03] father is
[1:49:05] nothing but a representation of your
[1:49:07] blood
[1:49:09] but Lord we take it in remembrance of
[1:49:11] you we know it's not your lips or blood
[1:49:13] we know this is not your literal body
[1:49:15] but we take it in remembrance of you
[1:49:18] father for the body that was broke and
[1:49:21] for the blood that was shed Lord we
[1:49:23] partake of this as we call Lord's Supper
[1:49:27] in remembrance of you and you gave it to
[1:49:30] us as an ordinance to do until you come
[1:49:32] to take us home
[1:49:34] so as we observe this today Father we
[1:49:37] pray that you blessed this bread that
[1:49:39] you bless this wine that you bless it to
[1:49:42] the nourishing and strengthening of our
[1:49:45] bodies
[1:49:46] we recognize Lord
[1:49:48] how your body was ripped and torn into
[1:49:51] pieces
[1:49:53] unrecognizable the flesh hanging off of
[1:49:55] your body
[1:49:57] and the blood flowing so thick
[1:50:00] flowing so uh so much down through the
[1:50:04] channels there God that Lord your body
[1:50:06] must have just become pale
[1:50:09] just no blood left
[1:50:12] how you and your physical capabilities
[1:50:16] was able to drag that cross up to a Gog
[1:50:20] off this hill Lord is just
[1:50:22] it's just un understandable by human
[1:50:26] but just believing by faith God as your
[1:50:28] body ripped to shreds and
[1:50:31] more blood in the drain that was still
[1:50:34] in your body God is
[1:50:35] is just unimaginable but you did it for
[1:50:38] us
[1:50:40] you did it for our Redemption
[1:50:42] you did it because you loved us nothing
[1:50:45] that you needed nothing that you learned
[1:50:48] nothing that you overcame or deserved
[1:50:51] nothing you earned
[1:50:53] Lord you did it because you loved us yes
[1:50:57] and Lord we take this today in
[1:50:59] remembrance of you
[1:51:01] because we love you and we thank you
[1:51:03] Lord for doing this for us father
[1:51:07] now again we pray that you bless this
[1:51:09] bread bless this one as we receive it
[1:51:12] unto ourselves now in the name of the
[1:51:15] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[1:51:19] praise the Lord would take this bread
[1:51:21] baked by our precious sister Holy Ghost
[1:51:25] amen
[1:51:26] I've said so many times I appreciate her
[1:51:29] faith and the growth of our church
[1:51:32] for the bread the amount of bread that
[1:51:35] she makes for us
[1:51:36] amen amen
[1:51:39] I know
[1:51:41] we take this in fate
[1:51:44] and be believing
[1:51:45] and when his body was busted when it was
[1:51:49] broken
[1:51:50] amen
[1:51:52] he did it because he loved us
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:56] amen
[1:51:57] I've watched I've tried to watch that
[1:52:00] movie The Passion before
[1:52:02] and I honestly
[1:52:06] I watched it one time with brother Joel
[1:52:08] Forney in the in the
[1:52:10] theater
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:12] up in the mountains
[1:52:15] and I bought the video
[1:52:18] and to be honest with you I've never
[1:52:19] watched it again
[1:52:21] I'm still having the video sitting there
[1:52:23] sitting down to watch it one time and it
[1:52:25] got to the scorching part I turned it
[1:52:27] off and never turned it back on had to
[1:52:29] try to watch it again just couldn't do
[1:52:31] it
[1:52:32] it just just something about it I just
[1:52:37] I just couldn't watch it again
[1:52:39] I know he did it for us I know he did it
[1:52:42] because he loves us
[1:52:44] it's just
[1:52:46] it's just something that I just
[1:52:48] I couldn't overcome maybe you have and
[1:52:52] there's nothing wrong with that it just
[1:52:54] his body was
[1:52:56] busted so bad I believe it brother round
[1:52:59] was alive today he would have watched it
[1:53:00] and I believe he had made some of the
[1:53:02] same comments
[1:53:04] event because based on the description
[1:53:06] that I remember him telling
[1:53:09] that video probably comes the closest to
[1:53:12] what actually happened
[1:53:15] the glorified stuff you know only
[1:53:17] Hollywood stuff you know
[1:53:20] I'm thankful for that the Lord did this
[1:53:22] for us so I'm trying to think in my mind
[1:53:25] if we all could come up at one time
[1:53:27] maybe this side brothers and sisters can
[1:53:30] come line up over here maybe decide to
[1:53:33] come line up over here if we could all
[1:53:34] fit and we'd be good if we could do it
[1:53:36] all at once
[1:53:39] as uh
[1:53:43] his brother yeah go ahead and come on up
[1:53:46] just come around here
[1:53:50] as was mentioned I think brother Dennis
[1:53:52] mentioned his prayers there's healing in
[1:53:54] this cup thanks
[1:53:56] you have a need of something you may be
[1:53:59] sick in body or something yeah
[1:54:03] there's healing in here amen amen praise
[1:54:05] the Lord so take that in faith and
[1:54:07] believe
[1:54:09] and maybe sister Karen
[1:54:12] you just a little bit more of a Down
[1:54:14] Below the path
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:24] hey
[1:55:04] foreign
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:56:11] thank you
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:21] foreign
[1:57:26] foreign
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:31] yes
[1:58:43] pictures
[1:58:45] oh that's wonderful things what he did
[1:58:48] for us is what he went through for us
[1:59:23] is our custom will have
[1:59:25] brother and sister Pat taking burn the
[1:59:28] bread for us
[1:59:42] I should not deserve it
[1:59:50] but it's his love
[1:59:53] that would just get just a little plan
[1:59:55] to see that look
[1:59:57] would change our lives so drastically
[2:00:02] so less self-centered
[2:00:06] means everything about Jesus love is for
[2:00:09] others
[2:00:14] Say Amen
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:36] and as with goes with communion goes
[2:00:39] foot washing
[2:00:41] the second ordinance
[2:00:44] or two of the three so in Saint John
[2:00:48] Chapter 13 we read from
[2:00:54] the example that we get from the
[2:00:55] scripture that Jesus left with us
[2:00:58] Saint John 13 start with verse 2.
[2:01:04] and suffer being ended
[2:01:07] the devil having now put in the heart of
[2:01:09] judas's carry it
[2:01:11] Simon's son to betray him
[2:01:14] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:01:16] all things into his hands and that he
[2:01:18] had was come from God and went to God he
[2:01:22] rises from supper and laid aside his
[2:01:24] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:01:26] himself
[2:01:27] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:01:31] and began to watch the disciples feet
[2:01:33] and to wipe them with the turtle towel
[2:01:35] wherewith he was girded
[2:01:37] then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[2:01:40] said unto him Lord thus thou wash my
[2:01:43] feet
[2:01:44] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[2:01:46] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:01:49] know hereafter
[2:01:52] Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never
[2:01:54] wash my feet
[2:01:56] Jesus answered him if I watch thee not
[2:01:59] thou has no part with me
[2:02:01] so Jesus says that for the Lord's supper
[2:02:04] and foot washing
[2:02:07] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[2:02:10] feet only but also my head and my hands
[2:02:13] and my head
[2:02:14] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[2:02:16] needed not saved to wash his feet but is
[2:02:19] clean every width and ye are clean but
[2:02:22] not all
[2:02:23] for he knew who should betray him
[2:02:25] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[2:02:28] so after he had washed their feet
[2:02:30] and had taken his garments and was set
[2:02:33] down again he said unto them know ye
[2:02:35] what I have done to you
[2:02:37] you call me master and Lord and you say
[2:02:40] well for so I am
[2:02:42] and if I then your Lord and Master have
[2:02:44] washed your feet he also ought to wash
[2:02:47] one another's feet for I have given you
[2:02:50] an example that ye should do as I have
[2:02:52] done to you
[2:02:54] very rarely I say unto you the servant
[2:02:56] is not greater than his Lord neither is
[2:02:58] he that is sick greater than he that is
[2:03:00] sin
[2:03:00] if you do if you know these things happy
[2:03:04] arguing if
[2:03:09] and as we do the sisters will be here
[2:03:11] but watching and the brothers will be in
[2:03:14] the front room so we will reconvene back
[2:03:18] in here after the football field so God
[2:03:21] bless you
[2:03:25] foreign
