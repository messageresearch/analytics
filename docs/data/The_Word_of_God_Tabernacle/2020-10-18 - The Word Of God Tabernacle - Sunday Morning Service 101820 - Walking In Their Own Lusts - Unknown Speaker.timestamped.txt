[39:42] we're just going to read uh i'll tell
[39:43] you what we'll just read one verse and
[39:45] i'll let you be seated because i want to
[39:46] read most of the chapter but
[39:48] we'll just let you be seated after uh we
[39:51] read the um
[39:52] let's see the 16th verse just read the
[39:54] 16th verse kind of catches jude in the
[39:56] middle of a thought here but
[39:58] uh we'll go back and and pick it up here
[40:00] after we let you be seated but the 16th
[40:02] verse says
[40:03] these are murmurs complainers walking
[40:07] after their own
[40:08] lusts and their mouth speaking great
[40:10] swelling words having
[40:12] man's uh persons in admiration
[40:15] because of advantage you could be seated
[40:17] if you'd like now
[40:23] i just read that verse uh to draw the
[40:26] text from today because i just want to
[40:27] title this if we could walking in their
[40:29] own lust
[40:30] uh walking in their own lust kind of
[40:33] came to
[40:33] uh something yesterday and thinking
[40:35] about the times that we live and
[40:38] you know uh minister and of course
[40:40] pastor
[40:41] um you know there's there's quite a
[40:45] uh a buffet if you will of of things
[40:48] that the lord has given us in the word
[40:50] the message and uh subjects and things
[40:53] today and
[40:54] you know if if a person with an anointed
[40:56] gift
[40:57] and look at what's going on in the world
[40:59] today in our lives and in churches and
[41:01] take the scripture
[41:03] uh we can preach another 10 000 years
[41:06] you can take every god called minister
[41:09] take the bible
[41:09] circumstances the things going on and
[41:11] preach another each one
[41:13] preach another 10 000 years not not
[41:16] accumulative
[41:17] but all together another 10 000 years
[41:20] just
[41:20] on this little bit so uh there's there's
[41:23] much to cover but
[41:24] this is just something that came on my
[41:26] heart and and as i
[41:28] read through this and what jude said
[41:30] about this it really struck me as how
[41:33] prominent what he said here really
[41:35] speaks to in my opinion
[41:37] and i hope maybe to yours after today
[41:39] what's going on today
[41:41] and of course the great deal of the
[41:43] bible does but it's almost like
[41:45] jude uh gave a six o'clock news report
[41:49] last night of what's going on in the
[41:51] events of the world today
[41:52] very much uh so let's just go back to
[41:54] the third verse and we'll start there
[41:56] and uh we'll end up going back through
[41:58] 16th verse again remember
[42:00] the topic today of the subject the title
[42:03] is
[42:03] walking in their own lusts walking in
[42:06] their own lusts and think about that
[42:08] want to make sure that we in our lives
[42:11] that we don't do that that that's not
[42:13] something that we fall in micah
[42:16] check that camera it doesn't look like
[42:18] it's quite pointing this way is it okay
[42:21] yeah okay
[42:21] all right it looks like it's pointing
[42:23] down there i mean god bless you amen
[42:25] welcome to the streaming today
[42:27] jude the third verse let's begin reading
[42:30] here
[42:34] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[42:37] write unto you
[42:38] of the common salvation it was needful
[42:41] for me to write unto you and exhorts you
[42:44] that ye should earnestly contend for the
[42:46] faith which was once delivered unto the
[42:49] saints now of course
[42:50] we we one time tackled this uh
[42:53] um this subject of earnestly contending
[42:56] for the faith but that third verse
[42:58] uh is is quite outstanding considering
[43:01] that jude is putting
[43:03] so much descriptive adjectives in this
[43:06] verse
[43:07] if you look at it he says diligence
[43:10] common salvation
[43:12] needful for me to write exhorts you that
[43:14] you
[43:15] earnestly contend what was delivered
[43:18] i mean he's being very uh very poignant
[43:21] about what he's trying to get across to
[43:24] us and very descriptive about his
[43:26] adjectives and helping us understand
[43:28] what he's saying
[43:29] in his heart and why the holy spirit is
[43:31] moving him
[43:32] is very important and it's very
[43:35] important that we look at it and take
[43:37] heart to what is being said as a
[43:38] christian as a bible believer
[43:41] uh and a literal bible believer and what
[43:44] the bible teaches us
[43:46] that this is quite an outstanding thing
[43:47] that he's trying to tell us to make sure
[43:50] that we earnestly content our earnest
[43:53] we should be there and our contention
[43:55] should be there
[43:56] for that faith for the faith that was
[43:59] once delivered to the saints now that of
[44:01] course we know
[44:02] is falling into of malachi 4 5
[44:05] 6 and the turning of the hearts of the
[44:07] children back to the fathers again
[44:09] of that faith that was once delivered to
[44:12] the saints which that same
[44:14] faith today delivered to a bride takes
[44:17] her into a place
[44:18] not just where they were but into a body
[44:21] change
[44:21] into a rapture amen for there are
[44:25] certain men crept in
[44:26] unawares as we've said before uh i
[44:29] believe that those
[44:30] men came in crept in unawares because
[44:33] they blended right in with the group
[44:35] they they weren't recognized as an
[44:37] outsider or a
[44:39] demonic spirit coming and filtrating in
[44:41] a church or in a service because they
[44:43] looked and acted just like the rest
[44:46] of those that were there so those that
[44:48] come in that crept in they crept in
[44:50] unaware you didn't recognize it or
[44:52] unders or see it
[44:54] because they they looked and sounded and
[44:56] acted just like the rest of
[44:58] of of the group there who were before of
[45:01] old ordained to this condemnation
[45:04] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[45:07] into lasciviousness which is uh
[45:11] an unbridled lust is what lasciviousness
[45:14] is
[45:15] it is an unbridled lust or filth
[45:19] and these are ordained or preordained
[45:23] to this condemnation ungodly
[45:27] turning the grace of god now look what
[45:29] they turn
[45:30] into unbridled filth
[45:33] they turn the grace of god into
[45:36] unbridled
[45:37] filth that's how they walk in their own
[45:40] lusts
[45:41] they're walking in their own lusts not
[45:44] just an act
[45:45] understand this uh title that we take
[45:49] and when we get back to the 16th verse
[45:51] it's not just an act it's not just
[45:53] something that takes place
[45:55] these are literally walking this is
[45:58] the value of their lives is walking
[46:02] talking continually every day
[46:05] perpetually
[46:06] walking in their own lust not just
[46:09] caught up in a trap or a mistake or
[46:11] something like that
[46:12] these people literally are living
[46:15] this life of unbridled filth
[46:19] amen understand unbridled filth
[46:22] think of that keep all these things
[46:24] please in your mind
[46:25] and you think about what's going on in
[46:27] the world today and not just in the
[46:28] world
[46:30] think about even the christian as we
[46:32] call it today
[46:33] christian world or the church world the
[46:36] unbridled
[46:37] filth that continues to walk in amongst
[46:40] people completely
[46:42] devoid of conscience completely devoid
[46:45] of any christian or biblical value
[46:48] amen that's why it's so important if you
[46:51] look at this friend
[46:54] uh if you look at this
[46:57] to recognize how important it is
[47:01] can i just use a quote i just use the
[47:03] quote brother branham said
[47:06] if you don't get your children to god
[47:08] first
[47:09] rock and roll will get them every time
[47:12] now of course rock and roll is devolved
[47:14] in
[47:14] and i say devolved you'd think when it
[47:17] rocked right brother angel
[47:18] you didn't think you'd get any worse
[47:19] right well it did it's de-evolved down
[47:22] into hip hop and rap
[47:24] and all this other just filthy ungodly
[47:28] unbridled lust just filth
[47:31] disgusting horrible music
[47:35] well they call it music so i guess i'll
[47:36] have to team it that way too
[47:39] but the point being is when uh when a
[47:42] child is born when we are born
[47:45] we're born with the nature
[47:49] to continue to live by what the flesh
[47:52] affords us
[47:53] by the desires of the flesh because look
[47:55] friend we all know
[47:57] even the young people here you know it's
[47:59] easier to
[48:00] follow the whims and the lusts of the
[48:03] flesh than it is to obey god in his
[48:05] words
[48:06] right because obeying god in his word
[48:09] is harder and greats against your flesh
[48:13] more than if you just give in and just
[48:15] do whatever the desire of the flesh
[48:17] tells you to do
[48:18] right it's harder it is more of a
[48:21] struggle
[48:22] it's a fight that's why that's why he
[48:24] said we must contend
[48:26] contending is a fight contending is
[48:29] something that you have to struggle that
[48:31] you have to
[48:32] battle your way through and and and it's
[48:35] probably
[48:36] harder and i and there's i'll say
[48:37] probably i'll say it is
[48:39] harder today for young people than it
[48:41] was when i was a young person or when
[48:43] sister norma says
[48:44] lydia brother dennis or danny it's
[48:47] harder now than it was when we were kids
[48:49] that's right
[48:50] it's harder than when tabitha and
[48:52] zachary micah were kids
[48:54] it's going to be if the lord would tarry
[48:56] it's going to be harder for emma
[48:57] and and joel than is for you
[49:01] because of the unbridled filth that's
[49:03] going on in the world today right
[49:05] and the the desires that's out there to
[49:08] try to draw you
[49:10] and it's and it's going to draw because
[49:13] it's easier
[49:14] right right it's easier to give in to
[49:16] the temptation of the flesh
[49:18] it's easier to give in to just do what
[49:20] you feel like you want to do
[49:22] one of the most ungodly advertisements
[49:26] in my opinion
[49:27] in the entire world
[49:30] was when nike and in my opinion you can
[49:34] like nike or not i hate them but
[49:36] uh hate's a strong word but they they
[49:39] seem to stand for everything i stand
[49:41] against so
[49:42] but they came out with a slogan just do
[49:44] it
[49:46] oh that's about one of the most ungodly
[49:49] things
[49:50] that that that is ever just in three
[49:53] words
[49:54] has conjured up to deceive people
[49:58] into in into following along with that
[50:01] what does that mean
[50:02] that means if you feel like it just do
[50:04] it
[50:05] if you're if the lust of the flesh
[50:08] compels you
[50:09] just do it just give in doesn't matter
[50:11] it's okay
[50:12] just do it how how
[50:15] ungodly that is because it it
[50:18] it comes against everything that god is
[50:21] moving in our lives to bring us
[50:23] to to just do it no we don't just do it
[50:26] we do what god
[50:28] calls us what his word commands for us
[50:31] what his spirit is moving
[50:32] us to do not just what we think we
[50:35] should do or not what we're just what we
[50:37] feel like we should do
[50:39] but that's how much easier it is and if
[50:41] you don't have the holy ghost and if
[50:43] you're not born again friend
[50:45] you cave into that lust of the flesh
[50:47] every time
[50:48] amen every time let's continue to move
[50:51] on though
[50:53] that word lasciviousness you think about
[50:56] it it hits hard
[50:57] they turn the grace of god into
[51:01] lasciviousness
[51:02] they turn god's grace god's unmerited
[51:05] favor
[51:07] this is so sad his unmerited grace
[51:11] favor they turn into an unbridled
[51:14] filth because they make it like
[51:17] well you just do okay and you know just
[51:20] just live like you want to live and be
[51:22] like you want to be
[51:23] and and god will forgive you it's okay
[51:26] the grace of god will take care of it
[51:28] the blood of jesus christ will take care
[51:30] of it just live however you want it's
[51:31] okay
[51:32] and that's what a lot of the christian
[51:34] world does today
[51:35] they don't understand or see the value
[51:38] or the biblical reference or or
[51:40] truth of living a holy life right a lot
[51:43] of people call it
[51:44] uh legalism legalism is thinking that
[51:49] being living that way is going to get
[51:51] you to heaven we don't believe that
[51:54] but we do believe in living a holy life
[51:56] we do believe in living a biblical
[51:58] godly holy life so that god is pleased
[52:01] with our lives so that when our life is
[52:03] over we go
[52:04] to be with him amen but people have
[52:06] turned that
[52:07] grace into lucifer until unbridled
[52:11] filth that's horrible the grace of god
[52:15] but praise the lord there's a group of
[52:17] people that know how
[52:18] what the value of god's grace really is
[52:21] they know what the grace of god means to
[52:23] them
[52:23] and they know that they do everything
[52:25] they can as they obtain that grace of
[52:28] god
[52:28] to live according to god's word so that
[52:31] we are not displeasing to him
[52:35] they turn the grace of god into
[52:37] lasciviousness and denying
[52:39] the only lord god in our lord jesus
[52:41] christ so how do they deny him by
[52:43] denying his word
[52:44] right how do they deny his word by
[52:46] disobeying it
[52:48] you disobey god's word you deny god's
[52:50] word
[52:51] if you live however you want you're
[52:52] basically saying you don't believe what
[52:54] god's word says
[52:55] right if you if you preach some dogma
[52:58] that a church or a
[53:00] school taught you you're denying jesus
[53:02] christ because you're denying the word
[53:04] oh but he's standing up there talking
[53:06] about jesus but if he's talking about
[53:08] him in contrast to his own word
[53:10] he's denying the very god he claims to
[53:12] serve right right
[53:15] they're denying jesus by denying the
[53:18] word
[53:18] when you deny the word you deny the the
[53:22] the un the the undefiled
[53:26] uh uh uh word of god the the the
[53:29] present-day truth the message
[53:32] you deny that you deny jesus that's just
[53:35] that's just
[53:36] truth right um if a person decides to
[53:39] live
[53:40] an unbridled uh lust filth
[53:43] if they decide to turn the grace of god
[53:45] into lasciviousness
[53:47] if they decide that they you know just
[53:48] do it and you know you go into some
[53:50] booth and you pay repentance or whatever
[53:53] you get absolved by some priest and they
[53:55] cross you and stuff and that's okay you
[53:57] you're good you can go on filth
[54:00] they deny jesus christ
[54:03] they hold a cross around their neck with
[54:05] the crucifix on it
[54:07] and not just catholics but
[54:10] uh uh but others i don't mean to
[54:12] necessarily call
[54:13] out catholics but it's uh you know one
[54:16] of the more hypocritical
[54:18] ones around but anyway uh it's
[54:20] everywhere
[54:21] it's laden all over uh christendom
[54:25] it's late with it because if you deny
[54:27] god's word
[54:28] if you deny to obey god's word if you
[54:31] deny to live according to god's word you
[54:33] are denying jesus christ
[54:36] i will therefore fifth verse
[54:40] i had a feeling when i was going through
[54:41] this yesterday i'll just be perfectly
[54:43] honest with you saints i was when i was
[54:44] going through this yesterday
[54:46] and i read through uh jude i thought i
[54:48] don't know if i'll ever get through
[54:49] anything because i got a lot of notes
[54:51] and other scriptures here that i'll ever
[54:53] get to i
[54:54] i think it's going to take the whole
[54:55] time just to get through jude but anyway
[54:58] you pray for me amen uh i will therefore
[55:01] put you in remembrance though you once
[55:05] knew this how that the lord having
[55:08] spared the people out of the land of
[55:10] egypt afterward destroyed them that
[55:13] believes not
[55:15] so he destroyed the unbeliever so if god
[55:18] destroyed the unbeliever then
[55:20] what's going to happen to the unbeliever
[55:22] today
[55:23] exact same thing god doesn't change his
[55:26] pattern
[55:26] god doesn't change anything god is god
[55:29] amen
[55:30] amen he doesn't change his ways he
[55:32] doesn't change his
[55:33] uh tactics he doesn't change his uh uh
[55:36] ideas thoughts the way he did it one
[55:38] time he does it all the way so if he
[55:39] destroyed the unbeliever then he'd do
[55:41] the same thing today
[55:42] right same thing's gonna happen the
[55:44] thing that we
[55:45] pray for and and work towards is they
[55:48] help to try to make as many people
[55:50] believe
[55:50] as possible right and and by believing i
[55:53] mean
[55:54] they they don't just uh uh come to this
[55:57] church but they believe and live by the
[55:58] word
[55:59] yes jesus christ the word
[56:03] sixth verse and the angels look now the
[56:06] angels
[56:08] which kept not their first estate but
[56:11] left their own habitation
[56:13] revelation 12. you go back and read it
[56:16] kept not their first estate but left
[56:18] their own habitations
[56:20] he hath reserved in everlasting chains
[56:23] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[56:26] great day
[56:27] you know brother adam talked about those
[56:28] fallen angels right
[56:30] uh being like luther wesley not
[56:33] the people the men themselves but those
[56:36] that came after them
[56:38] they brought forth the truth that truth
[56:40] then became denominated by what
[56:43] the church denominated under it the
[56:45] truth can't be denominated
[56:47] but the words that they took to
[56:48] denominate based on
[56:50] someone's opinion of what was said and
[56:53] they denominated that
[56:54] and when they denominated that it died
[56:57] and all
[56:58] those that were there under there fallen
[57:00] angels
[57:01] amen just like revelation 12 those
[57:04] fallen angels
[57:06] they were there in heaven had their
[57:07] first estate as angels unto god
[57:10] they believed the devil's lie and they
[57:12] fell down with him
[57:13] now the bible says jude says they kept
[57:16] not that estate
[57:17] they received everlasting change in
[57:19] darkness to the day of judgment that
[57:21] great day
[57:22] well if he did that to those angels
[57:24] which he created in that condition at
[57:26] that state
[57:27] what will he do to the unbeliever you
[57:30] know the bible says
[57:31] if if uh
[57:35] if if the righteous scarcely be saved
[57:40] where do the sinner and the ungodly
[57:42] appear that's right
[57:43] amen if the righteous are scarcely we'll
[57:47] just say barely
[57:48] we squeak in praise the lord i don't
[57:51] care if i squeak in as long as i'm in
[57:52] that's right and that's
[57:54] i mean i want to get in with blazes
[57:55] that's fine but if i squeak in as long
[57:57] as i'm in i'm fine
[57:59] i can be the bottom of the totem pole i
[58:01] can i could be the dirt
[58:02] of which the pole is on as long as i'm
[58:04] there the thing that matters the most
[58:07] but it says if the righteous scarcely be
[58:09] saved
[58:10] and scarce is just you know one out of a
[58:12] million or
[58:13] not very many see but at the righteous
[58:16] scarcity where did the sin
[58:17] and ungodly appear even as sodom and
[58:20] gomorrah
[58:21] and the cities about them and like
[58:24] manner giving themselves over to
[58:26] fornication
[58:27] going after strange flesh are set
[58:30] forth for an example suffering the
[58:33] vengeance of
[58:34] eternal fire the judgment comes
[58:37] now we all know that sodom and gomorrah
[58:40] suffered a judgment of fire and
[58:43] brimstone
[58:44] pouring down on that city and completely
[58:47] destroying it
[58:48] right then it sunk beneath the sea
[58:50] that's right
[58:51] so we know that that fire there
[58:54] eventually quenched itself it's not deal
[58:56] burning today
[58:58] but what what jude is talking about
[59:01] is the individuals that live the lives
[59:04] that he's talking about
[59:05] giving themselves over to fornication
[59:08] going after strange flesh
[59:10] were set forth as an example and people
[59:13] want to get rid of that example today
[59:15] the sodom and gomorrah is as good of
[59:17] example today
[59:19] in what's going on in this world and
[59:20] what i know of scripturally amen
[59:23] and god destroyed it then what do you
[59:25] think god's doing now
[59:26] right god is destroying it now amen
[59:33] of the vengeance of an eternal fire so
[59:36] what's going on
[59:38] the city sodom and gomorrah the the fire
[59:42] of the city has been quenched
[59:44] what fire has yet to be quenched
[59:48] jude says the vengeance of eternal fire
[59:52] those that were living ungodly those
[59:54] that were living in
[59:56] unbridled lust and filth
[59:59] and i'm just not i'm not talking about
[1:00:01] just the filth of the flesh i'm talking
[1:00:02] about
[1:00:03] uh a a desire of flesh i'm talking about
[1:00:05] the filth of the disobedience of god's
[1:00:08] word
[1:00:09] that's as big of filth as there is the
[1:00:12] other is just a result of that
[1:00:14] unclean living is just a result of
[1:00:16] fornication
[1:00:18] fornication is just unclean living it's
[1:00:20] just a result
[1:00:22] you remember brother adam said only sin
[1:00:24] is unbelief
[1:00:25] right there's a lot of sins we consider
[1:00:28] but there's only one sin
[1:00:29] that's unbelief you do these things
[1:00:31] they're attributes of
[1:00:33] unbelief right right so one just it
[1:00:36] follows in
[1:00:36] in in the other so it's the same thing
[1:00:39] the vengeance of eternal fires the fact
[1:00:41] that those that were there
[1:00:43] living those kinds of life are still
[1:00:45] going to suffer
[1:00:47] that same vengeance that same
[1:00:50] suffering of eternal fire
[1:00:54] if he did it then he's still doing it
[1:00:57] today
[1:00:59] but it's a sad place
[1:01:02] my mind just gets filled with so many
[1:01:04] things let's go to the eighth verse
[1:01:07] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:01:11] defile the flesh despise dominion
[1:01:15] and speak evil of dignities maya that's
[1:01:18] not
[1:01:19] that could have been that could have
[1:01:21] been the headline of the six o'clock
[1:01:22] news last night
[1:01:24] that could probably be the headline of
[1:01:26] the six o'clock news tonight
[1:01:28] it could have been a headline of the
[1:01:29] newspaper they printed this morning or
[1:01:31] on facebook or
[1:01:32] or what other other social media there
[1:01:34] is that could have been the headline
[1:01:37] almost every day what is it
[1:01:41] filthy dreamers defiling their flesh
[1:01:45] despising dominion people who don't like
[1:01:49] to be told what to do
[1:01:50] people who don't like laws people who
[1:01:53] don't like rules
[1:01:54] right speaking evil of dignities they
[1:01:57] don't they don't want a ruler
[1:01:59] they're anarchists they're burning down
[1:02:02] cities in this country
[1:02:03] they're looting buildings they're
[1:02:05] destroying lives they're killing people
[1:02:07] because they don't like authority they
[1:02:10] don't want to be told what to do
[1:02:11] they want to just do it they don't want
[1:02:14] to be
[1:02:14] they want to continue to live in the
[1:02:17] unbridled lasciviousness
[1:02:19] filth that they've been living in they
[1:02:22] want it to continue to stay that way
[1:02:24] and if you speak out against that they
[1:02:27] will hurt you
[1:02:29] or kill you or destroy your home or
[1:02:32] destroy your family
[1:02:34] or or or uh vandalize your home or
[1:02:37] business
[1:02:39] that's why so many people are quiet
[1:02:41] today because they don't want to be
[1:02:42] victims of that
[1:02:45] and our country's gotten so bad that if
[1:02:48] you try to defend yourself against that
[1:02:50] you'll go to jail right
[1:02:53] it's sad what it has gotten to but it's
[1:02:56] exactly according to the scriptures
[1:02:59] anarchists they don't want to be told
[1:03:02] what to do
[1:03:03] they don't want to have a law they don't
[1:03:05] want to have a rule they want to just
[1:03:07] live however they want they want to get
[1:03:08] rid of the police
[1:03:10] they want to be able to police
[1:03:11] themselves so you see how good that
[1:03:13] happens
[1:03:14] you know everybody talks about getting
[1:03:16] out of the wild west where there was a
[1:03:17] lot of policing of your own selves and
[1:03:19] you see how that turned out
[1:03:20] right and look what's happening today
[1:03:25] people just want to live do whatever
[1:03:26] they want to do live however they want
[1:03:28] to live
[1:03:29] and if you say anything about it or
[1:03:31] against it
[1:03:32] you are considered an enemy you are
[1:03:34] considered someone to be destroyed
[1:03:37] your life to be destroyed i read an
[1:03:40] article i'll just say this i read an
[1:03:41] article yesterday i believe it was
[1:03:43] yesterday
[1:03:44] where a dozen people or so
[1:03:47] was protesting in a city because they
[1:03:50] wanted
[1:03:50] freedom of speech they wanted the first
[1:03:53] amendment of our constitution
[1:03:55] to be exercised in every corner of this
[1:03:58] country
[1:03:59] and 200 people come and beat them to a
[1:04:02] pulp
[1:04:03] just because they were exercising their
[1:04:05] first amendment right
[1:04:07] to freedom to speak 200 of them come
[1:04:11] knocked a man's tooth or two out beat
[1:04:13] them up
[1:04:14] now of course they were outnumbered if
[1:04:16] they weren't if they'd done something
[1:04:17] they'd they would have gone to jail
[1:04:19] beat them up because they did not agree
[1:04:22] with freedom of speech
[1:04:24] right that's how sad it has gotten
[1:04:28] yes yes despising dominion
[1:04:32] and speaking evil of dignity
[1:04:36] he said well if trump wins be a great
[1:04:38] place deal
[1:04:39] oh if five wins you'll change everything
[1:04:41] and be a great place
[1:04:43] friend this place has been reserved
[1:04:46] for fire this place
[1:04:50] is reserved unto judgment right
[1:04:53] amen now one over the other may give us
[1:04:56] a little more time of grace
[1:04:58] but this whole place is set to be burned
[1:05:01] that's right
[1:05:02] because of this and it doesn't matter
[1:05:06] if one or the other gets in these people
[1:05:09] will still exist
[1:05:12] they will still hate the dignities they
[1:05:14] will still hate the dominion
[1:05:15] they will still want to continue to live
[1:05:18] in their unbridled lusts my mind
[1:05:22] yet michael look now michael the
[1:05:25] archangel
[1:05:26] when contending with the devil he
[1:05:28] disputed about the body of moses
[1:05:30] durst not bring against him a railing
[1:05:32] accusation
[1:05:34] but said the lord rebuked thee amen
[1:05:38] that's about what it's got to today
[1:05:39] right and in the world that we live
[1:05:42] today
[1:05:43] it does not bring out railing
[1:05:45] accusations i guess they'll
[1:05:46] shoot you if you do but we just say lord
[1:05:49] it's in your hands
[1:05:50] yes amen you take care of it amen and he
[1:05:53] is
[1:05:53] and he will well if there's just one
[1:05:56] more
[1:05:58] god and all that's going on lord if
[1:05:59] there's just one more seed if there's
[1:06:01] just one more person i can help some way
[1:06:03] help me to help them help me to help
[1:06:06] them somehow if i can
[1:06:10] but these speak evil of those things
[1:06:12] which they know
[1:06:13] not there you go ignorant
[1:06:17] ignorance is not knowing amen stupidity
[1:06:20] is knowing and just not giving value to
[1:06:22] it
[1:06:23] ignorance is just not knowing they just
[1:06:25] don't know
[1:06:26] and that's the problem they speak evil
[1:06:28] of those things because they don't know
[1:06:30] right they just don't know and do they
[1:06:32] not know because nobody told them
[1:06:35] did they not know because they don't
[1:06:37] hear it anyplace else
[1:06:39] i mean you know
[1:06:46] some things i just don't want to say um
[1:06:49] they speak evil of things that they
[1:06:51] don't know about
[1:06:53] who is supposed to teach them how are
[1:06:56] they supposed to learn
[1:07:00] well there's a time or a man and a woman
[1:07:04] not two women not two men
[1:07:06] but a man and a woman come together and
[1:07:09] they procreate
[1:07:11] a child is born whose responsibilities
[1:07:14] that child born to
[1:07:16] not just the mother not just the father
[1:07:19] but
[1:07:19] the parents the parent is then
[1:07:24] by god's rule required to
[1:07:27] raise that child in the nurture and
[1:07:29] admonition of god
[1:07:31] and train that child and the way it is
[1:07:33] supposed to go
[1:07:34] right you're supposed to know this
[1:07:38] you don't know it why because you
[1:07:40] haven't been taught
[1:07:41] right you haven't been told and of
[1:07:44] course
[1:07:45] if all they listen to is something that
[1:07:47] sends them in one direction
[1:07:49] that's all they're going to listen to
[1:07:50] that's all they're going to know they're
[1:07:51] not going to know the other side
[1:07:53] and who's ever heard the phrase there's
[1:07:55] two sides to every argument
[1:07:58] pretty much everybody in here except
[1:07:59] maybe emma i've heard there's two sides
[1:08:02] to every argument right
[1:08:03] two sides to every argument but if you
[1:08:05] only hear one side you don't even know
[1:08:07] anything else
[1:08:08] right you don't even know they're
[1:08:10] ignorant of it they speak evil of it
[1:08:12] because they don't know
[1:08:14] right if they haven't been raised right
[1:08:17] if they haven't been taught right
[1:08:19] if they don't know jesus saints that's
[1:08:21] our responsibility to try to help them
[1:08:23] to come to know
[1:08:25] there is a better way
[1:08:28] there is a god there is a lord jesus
[1:08:31] that loves you
[1:08:33] and wants to take you into his bosom
[1:08:36] and make you his own and make your life
[1:08:39] beautiful and give you a life beyond
[1:08:41] this life
[1:08:43] i will have to give kudos to a lady that
[1:08:46] we saw i'll call her a lady
[1:08:48] and and coming from my lips that is a
[1:08:51] you
[1:08:51] take it from me that comes from my lips
[1:08:54] that is
[1:08:54] the best compliment a woman can get from
[1:08:56] you right that you're a lady
[1:08:59] and you have to be a lady and act like a
[1:09:01] lady amen otherwise you're just a woman
[1:09:04] i remember one time i was
[1:09:08] working at my purchasing manager job in
[1:09:11] north carolina and i went to the
[1:09:12] warehouse to do something i came out and
[1:09:14] we were doing having some construction
[1:09:16] done outside and
[1:09:18] and there was a woman out there and she
[1:09:21] was working she had her jeans on and she
[1:09:23] was just
[1:09:24] going at it you know just like a man and
[1:09:27] that couple guys came around me and i
[1:09:30] knew everybody and they're like
[1:09:31] man that's quite a lady out there i said
[1:09:32] that's not an old lady
[1:09:34] that's a woman but that's not a lady a
[1:09:36] lady wouldn't be out there doing that
[1:09:37] right anyway this lady she was standing
[1:09:41] on the corner out there at the
[1:09:44] campbell and prince we couldn't see her
[1:09:46] sign and sonia looked at it for a second
[1:09:48] she said that's in spanish i don't even
[1:09:50] know what it says
[1:09:50] but as soon as we started getting past
[1:09:52] it it looked like
[1:09:54] by the best we could see it said uh
[1:09:57] god loves you or jesus loves you or
[1:10:00] christ loves you christo
[1:10:02] uh i couldn't see it but whatever it was
[1:10:05] i thought well good for her she's
[1:10:07] actually out doing at least somebody
[1:10:09] might read her sign who didn't know that
[1:10:11] they might know now
[1:10:12] right they might not believe it but at
[1:10:15] least they might know
[1:10:16] it amen at least they know that's our
[1:10:20] job
[1:10:21] help us lord to spread the word to let
[1:10:23] them know so they know
[1:10:24] they speak evil of things they don't
[1:10:26] know but what they know
[1:10:28] naturally as brute beasts in those
[1:10:31] things they corrupt themselves
[1:10:33] the flesh woe unto them for they have
[1:10:36] gone in the way of
[1:10:37] cain and ran greedily after the heir of
[1:10:40] balaam
[1:10:41] for reward and perished in the game
[1:10:44] saying of core
[1:10:45] now there's a process that takes place
[1:10:47] there we'll go through that maybe
[1:10:49] the lord willing we'll go through that
[1:10:50] process in a minute there's a scripture
[1:10:53] and james that gives us that process
[1:10:55] it's it's incredible but
[1:10:56] it's true they go the way of cain
[1:10:59] we know how cain went killed his own
[1:11:02] brother
[1:11:03] they become greedy for filthy luker just
[1:11:06] like balaam did
[1:11:07] you know brother brown called balaam a
[1:11:08] hireling prophet called him a prophet
[1:11:10] now he was a prophet
[1:11:12] but he was a hireling prophet he was a
[1:11:13] man for sale his prophetic gifts were
[1:11:16] for sale
[1:11:17] unfortunately there's probably a lot of
[1:11:19] people
[1:11:20] god help us i got to be careful and say
[1:11:23] this but
[1:11:24] are you just for the money right they do
[1:11:27] this just for money
[1:11:28] they want money they want praise they
[1:11:30] want fame they want a hand clap they
[1:11:32] want to paddle in the back
[1:11:33] but they want the money they're looking
[1:11:35] to become
[1:11:36] rich at 12 million mansions
[1:11:40] right yes that does exist yes there's
[1:11:43] preachers that call themselves in this
[1:11:45] country that own five and six
[1:11:47] airplanes 12 million dollar mansions
[1:11:50] right so they go the way of cain
[1:11:54] they fall into the the the filth of
[1:11:57] balaam
[1:11:58] which balaam taught the taught the
[1:12:00] people
[1:12:02] now and balaam really was the epitome
[1:12:05] of the lasciviousness taking the grace
[1:12:08] of god which they lived under the law
[1:12:10] then
[1:12:11] but god still favored them god gave them
[1:12:14] a way
[1:12:14] see to be able to still be under the
[1:12:17] blood it wasn't the blood of christ but
[1:12:19] the blood of bulls and goats but it was
[1:12:20] sufficient
[1:12:21] that god made for them right but balaam
[1:12:24] come and hired a prophet
[1:12:26] and convinced those people that they
[1:12:28] were all family
[1:12:29] that they were all one and they were all
[1:12:32] together
[1:12:33] and that they should all come and be one
[1:12:35] big great sweet group friend it's not
[1:12:36] supposed to be that way
[1:12:38] that's not the way it was then that's
[1:12:40] not the way it is now
[1:12:41] right now there's a bride that's around
[1:12:44] the world and
[1:12:45] and and there's different pockets around
[1:12:47] and that's fine that's great
[1:12:49] it should be that way i mean
[1:12:53] if they were that way in the bible how
[1:12:55] do you think it's going to be any
[1:12:56] different today
[1:12:58] even paul and barnabas became so
[1:13:00] contentious with each other
[1:13:02] that they had to separate go two
[1:13:03] different ways right
[1:13:05] they created can i say this i don't mean
[1:13:08] this scripturally but
[1:13:10] metaphorically they created two
[1:13:11] different churches
[1:13:13] right they became two different pastors
[1:13:15] of two different groups
[1:13:17] paul went one way and barnabas went the
[1:13:19] other who did that
[1:13:22] god did that because with
[1:13:25] instead of two people going to the same
[1:13:27] group he sent two people to go to two
[1:13:29] different groups
[1:13:30] right so this gospel got spread twice as
[1:13:32] quick as if paul and barnabas says stay
[1:13:34] together that's right friends god knows
[1:13:36] what he's doing
[1:13:37] yes yeah amen i'm gonna preach on that
[1:13:39] here pretty soon lord willing
[1:13:41] i got a couple other things in my heart
[1:13:43] really burning maybe for the next couple
[1:13:45] of weeks but we'll just see
[1:13:46] how the lord does with that but now a
[1:13:48] balaam he goes after the way of cain
[1:13:50] with no cain
[1:13:51] balaam taught the people to commit
[1:13:53] fornication against god's word
[1:13:56] to go against god by saying we're all
[1:13:58] family we're all here
[1:13:59] we're just one falling off the money
[1:14:02] that baal gave him
[1:14:03] amen ungodliness and then
[1:14:07] perished in the gang saying of course
[1:14:09] right
[1:14:11] these are spots in your feast of charity
[1:14:14] in other words uh you can live an
[1:14:17] ungodly
[1:14:18] a lot of people i mean be careful
[1:14:21] there's people today that think that
[1:14:24] their
[1:14:25] good deeds are going to get them into
[1:14:26] heaven right they live like a devil but
[1:14:29] they do
[1:14:29] good things so they think the good
[1:14:32] things are going to outweigh the
[1:14:33] devilish life that they're living
[1:14:35] when a lot of people you understand the
[1:14:37] next phrase i'm going to say
[1:14:38] people will believe what you do more
[1:14:40] than they believe what you say
[1:14:42] right and i may have butchered that a
[1:14:43] little bit but that's basically the gist
[1:14:45] of it right
[1:14:45] people will believe you more of what you
[1:14:48] do than what you say
[1:14:49] amen so they might say one thing or they
[1:14:52] might
[1:14:52] be giving charitable things but over
[1:14:54] here they're living the life of the
[1:14:56] devil completely against the word
[1:14:57] well jude is just saying that all of
[1:15:00] this
[1:15:00] ungodly living is spots in their
[1:15:04] charity in all their good deeds
[1:15:07] their good deeds are spotted cankered
[1:15:10] rotten filled good deeds are good
[1:15:14] i'm not going to say anything of a good
[1:15:16] good news if somebody's given to a good
[1:15:18] charity that's that's doing good things
[1:15:20] for people that's wonderful and fine
[1:15:23] but that work that life that they live
[1:15:26] is the spot and the canker and the rot
[1:15:29] in all the good that they're doing
[1:15:34] when they feast with you feeding
[1:15:35] themselves without fear clout listen
[1:15:38] he gets pretty hard now you think i've
[1:15:41] been hard listen to what jude says here
[1:15:43] clouds they are without water
[1:15:47] clouds without water carried about of
[1:15:51] winds trees whose fruit withereth
[1:15:55] and what good is a fruit tree if it's
[1:15:56] not giving good fruit right
[1:15:59] go sit in it for shade maybe but you
[1:16:02] said are any tree for a shade
[1:16:03] what's a fruit tree good for if it's not
[1:16:05] giving good fruit right
[1:16:07] their fruits withered without fruit
[1:16:10] twice dead and plucked up by the roots
[1:16:14] that means they're finished twice dead
[1:16:17] yes separated but then plucked up from
[1:16:21] the root
[1:16:22] twice dead and plucked up from the roof
[1:16:24] someone plucked from the roof friend has
[1:16:26] no hope
[1:16:27] a plant that you plug from the root is
[1:16:29] dead
[1:16:30] it's gone it's not gonna live because
[1:16:33] the root is the life
[1:16:35] the root is where it gets the water the
[1:16:37] nutrients to feed the plant
[1:16:39] if the roots are plugged up it's dead
[1:16:41] it's gone it is
[1:16:42] worthless it is fodder
[1:16:46] for the fire right that's all it is and
[1:16:49] that's what he's calling these people
[1:16:53] raging waves of the sea foaming out of
[1:16:56] their own shame
[1:16:57] wandering stars to whom is reserved the
[1:17:00] blackness of darkness
[1:17:02] forever mercy
[1:17:06] and friend if you're like me that hits
[1:17:08] you hard because you don't want to see
[1:17:09] anybody go to hell
[1:17:10] right you don't want to see anybody go
[1:17:12] to this place i know i've been preaching
[1:17:14] hard about this friend but
[1:17:15] not that doesn't mean i want anybody to
[1:17:17] do it that doesn't
[1:17:18] mean i want anybody to go there
[1:17:20] experience that
[1:17:22] i want everybody to hear this see this
[1:17:24] and turn their lives to christ
[1:17:26] amen forever
[1:17:30] and enoch also the seventh from adam
[1:17:33] prophesied of these saying behold the
[1:17:36] lord cometh with ten
[1:17:37] thousands of his saints to execute
[1:17:41] judgment upon all and to convince all
[1:17:44] that are ungodly among them
[1:17:46] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[1:17:48] have ungodly committed of
[1:17:50] all their hard speeches
[1:17:53] which ungodly sinners have spoken
[1:17:56] against him
[1:17:58] these are murmurs 16th verse again now
[1:18:01] these are murmurers complainers walking
[1:18:04] after their own lusts
[1:18:07] walking after their own lusts they're
[1:18:10] not to be told what to do
[1:18:12] they're not taught to be told how to
[1:18:14] live
[1:18:16] they're not to be told where to go
[1:18:18] they're not to be told
[1:18:19] how they're supposed to speak and do and
[1:18:22] live and say they're not to be told
[1:18:23] these things
[1:18:25] they live after their own lusts they
[1:18:28] live
[1:18:28] after their own dictates they live after
[1:18:30] their own purpose and their own will
[1:18:33] they're not giving over to the to to the
[1:18:36] uh
[1:18:36] life of a that gives life they're not
[1:18:39] they're not
[1:18:40] they're giving themselves to a god that
[1:18:42] wants to lead them and guide them into
[1:18:44] truth
[1:18:46] they're living their own lives they're
[1:18:48] murders
[1:18:49] walking after their own lusts their
[1:18:53] their mouths speaking great swelling
[1:18:55] words
[1:18:57] having men's persons in admiration
[1:18:59] because of
[1:19:00] advantage they've been advantaged
[1:19:03] money usually in today's life society
[1:19:07] money rules everything today right uh i
[1:19:10] mean
[1:19:11] the bible was certainly right on and
[1:19:13] jesus said it's easier to
[1:19:14] camel to go through the eye of the
[1:19:16] needle the rich man to enter the kingdom
[1:19:17] of heaven
[1:19:18] uh the the love of money is the root of
[1:19:21] all evil
[1:19:22] the love of money right you could have
[1:19:24] this room full of hundred dollar bills
[1:19:26] nobody know anything about it wouldn't
[1:19:27] hurt a soul
[1:19:29] but as soon as the first person found
[1:19:30] out about it told the second person and
[1:19:32] more
[1:19:33] people find out they'll be shooting and
[1:19:34] killing each and running over people out
[1:19:36] here and
[1:19:36] destroying people and killing them just
[1:19:38] to get in here to get a couple hundred
[1:19:39] dollars
[1:19:40] right yeah they would yeah to try to get
[1:19:43] much in here because of the love of
[1:19:45] money
[1:19:46] if you look at it government politics
[1:19:51] media everything
[1:19:54] everything is run by the greed of money
[1:19:58] everything right you say well it's for
[1:20:00] this purpose but what's behind that
[1:20:02] purpose
[1:20:02] it's usually going to be the love of
[1:20:04] money right usually going to be the love
[1:20:06] of money
[1:20:09] that's why brother branham said that uh
[1:20:12] and and i love america
[1:20:13] i love the united states best country of
[1:20:15] the world best country ever been
[1:20:17] or ever will be because we're about to
[1:20:18] finish this up but uh outside of god's
[1:20:20] kingdom of course but
[1:20:22] in this world but brother and said
[1:20:24] democracy is never going to work
[1:20:27] as good as it's done and as well as it's
[1:20:29] been for this country democracy doesn't
[1:20:30] work
[1:20:32] the only kingdom that works the only
[1:20:35] government that works is is a monarchy
[1:20:39] is a kingdom is the kingdom with a king
[1:20:42] that has the heart of the people
[1:20:44] if a king rules over his kingdom with
[1:20:47] the heart of the people
[1:20:49] as his royal ship as his rulership
[1:20:53] that that works right i think well
[1:20:56] that's perfect because that's exactly
[1:20:58] what god is
[1:21:00] god god is the king who has the heart of
[1:21:04] his people
[1:21:05] amen and everything that god does he
[1:21:08] does
[1:21:08] because and for his people right
[1:21:11] that's why everything works to our good
[1:21:15] because he loves us yes and if he loves
[1:21:18] us
[1:21:18] then it's going to work and that's what
[1:21:21] works
[1:21:22] amen and we're and we're going to that
[1:21:24] place we're going to that place
[1:21:26] amen while we're here i'll i'll because
[1:21:29] of the serpent's seat i'll stick with
[1:21:31] the democracy
[1:21:33] and the and the free uh the uh free
[1:21:36] market and the
[1:21:37] uh or the way our economy i'll stick
[1:21:40] with what we got now because of serpency
[1:21:43] you get rid of serpentine you got a
[1:21:44] whole different uh
[1:21:46] accountability then amen amen
[1:21:51] murmurs complainers walking after all us
[1:21:54] and they're now speaking great swelling
[1:21:56] words having
[1:21:56] men's persons and admiration because of
[1:21:59] advantage
[1:22:00] but beloved remember ye the words which
[1:22:02] we which were spoken before the apostles
[1:22:05] of our lord jesus christ
[1:22:06] now that they told you there should be
[1:22:09] mockers in the last time
[1:22:11] who should walk after their own ungodly
[1:22:15] lusts
[1:22:16] these be they who separate themselves
[1:22:19] sensual having not the spirit
[1:22:24] they are not born again they don't have
[1:22:26] the spirit of god
[1:22:27] amen they might have a mere anointing
[1:22:30] but that anointing when it goes away or
[1:22:33] rubs off
[1:22:34] or lifts off of them they're simply a
[1:22:37] brute beast like the 10th first says
[1:22:39] in the natural as a brute beast they
[1:22:42] corrupt themselves
[1:22:44] right that's how they are corrupted
[1:22:49] let's find we'll see what jude is
[1:22:51] speaking of here
[1:22:52] second peter chapter three
[1:22:56] second peter chapter three santa ate
[1:22:58] about three fourths of my time
[1:23:00] second peter chapter three verse one
[1:23:03] this second epistle beloved i now write
[1:23:06] unto you in both which i stir up your
[1:23:08] pure minds by the way of remembrance
[1:23:10] which is the exact same thing jude said
[1:23:12] really he said
[1:23:13] you would know these things uh peter
[1:23:16] also said um i think it's in the first
[1:23:19] chapter here
[1:23:21] that though that uh first peter 1
[1:23:24] 2 peter 1 12 where where i will not be
[1:23:28] neglige puts you always in remembrance
[1:23:30] of these things though you know them
[1:23:32] and be established in the present truth
[1:23:35] here he says in both which i stir
[1:23:37] up your mind your pure minds by the way
[1:23:39] of remembrance
[1:23:42] again we're back to second peter 3 2 now
[1:23:44] that ye may be
[1:23:45] mindful of the words which were spoken
[1:23:48] before by the holy prophets and of the
[1:23:50] commandment of us
[1:23:51] the apostles of our lord and savior
[1:23:53] knowing this first
[1:23:55] first first and foremost
[1:23:58] that there shall come in the last days
[1:24:02] what days are we living we're living in
[1:24:05] the last days the
[1:24:06] these are the last days i don't know how
[1:24:09] many more
[1:24:10] days we have but of course the last days
[1:24:13] uh that we're living in we can uh we
[1:24:16] could say
[1:24:17] church ages or church days or
[1:24:20] into or out of the laodicean age into
[1:24:23] the bright age
[1:24:25] a day in which the bride lives that
[1:24:28] she's called
[1:24:28] out of a church because she's his bride
[1:24:32] the bride called out of the church amen
[1:24:34] okay
[1:24:35] in this last days it's that last day the
[1:24:38] bright age
[1:24:40] scoffers walking after their own lusts
[1:24:44] scoffers people that even if you show
[1:24:47] them sometimes
[1:24:48] now this is not to dissuage anybody from
[1:24:51] showing the right way
[1:24:52] but showing them the right way laugh
[1:24:55] scorn make fun of make light of
[1:24:58] say that you're old-fashioned say you're
[1:25:01] a holy role whatever name or adjective
[1:25:03] you know
[1:25:04] it's it's common today it seems like uh
[1:25:07] in the world or
[1:25:07] politics or whatever to call somebody a
[1:25:09] xenophobe or an
[1:25:11] islamic phobe or a homophobe or some
[1:25:13] kind of foe but everybody's a foe
[1:25:15] today you know and none of it's good you
[1:25:18] know except them
[1:25:19] they're not folks they don't have a
[1:25:21] phobia
[1:25:22] that you know you just have the phobia
[1:25:24] see all the people have the phobia so
[1:25:26] you're going to be labeled something and
[1:25:28] it's probably not going to be good
[1:25:30] because you follow god
[1:25:32] and most of the time with most people
[1:25:34] this is my honest opinion
[1:25:36] with most people their heart is
[1:25:39] and they have a soul that's worth 10
[1:25:42] million worlds
[1:25:43] and that soul cries out for something
[1:25:46] and because they can't obtain it
[1:25:49] when they see someone that has it
[1:25:52] creates an
[1:25:52] anger and a hatred in that person
[1:25:56] because they see you and they recognize
[1:25:58] and
[1:25:59] i think they realize that there's people
[1:26:03] there
[1:26:04] that are good honest godly holy ghost
[1:26:07] filled the
[1:26:08] people that live according to the
[1:26:09] dictates of god's word
[1:26:12] and they can't somehow attain to that
[1:26:15] and they hate you for it right they're
[1:26:18] scoffers
[1:26:19] yes they scoff anything about it so
[1:26:22] what's the first thing someone does
[1:26:25] most people do it's human nature most
[1:26:27] people
[1:26:28] first thing they do when they reach a
[1:26:30] place that they realize
[1:26:32] they have they don't have something they
[1:26:34] probably need
[1:26:36] they put it down they make fun of it
[1:26:39] oh that's nothing that's no big deal
[1:26:42] oh there's nothing to that well they
[1:26:45] know there is
[1:26:46] they just can't get there they don't
[1:26:49] probably even
[1:26:50] want to get there but they know there's
[1:26:51] something to it
[1:26:53] they know there's something to the way
[1:26:55] that you live
[1:26:56] they know there's something to the way
[1:26:58] you dressed they know
[1:27:00] that you're that you're conservative god
[1:27:03] loving you live the way you talk the way
[1:27:05] you dress the way you do
[1:27:06] they know there's something to that
[1:27:09] that's my heart
[1:27:10] i could be wrong and there could be some
[1:27:12] out there that's just that just
[1:27:13] pure satan incarnate that don't but
[1:27:16] i believe i know every human born has a
[1:27:19] soul
[1:27:20] right and that soul to god is precious
[1:27:22] and we're 10 million worlds
[1:27:24] so if that's the case and god puts
[1:27:26] everybody on the same basis
[1:27:28] i just i just can't help believe that
[1:27:30] there's just something there they know
[1:27:32] that's right they can't attain to it so
[1:27:34] what do they do
[1:27:36] someone's deficient in an area what do
[1:27:38] they do
[1:27:40] the area they're deficient in they try
[1:27:42] to be little
[1:27:43] right they try to put down or say oh
[1:27:46] that's not important
[1:27:47] oh that that that doesn't mean anything
[1:27:49] oh you don't have to live like that
[1:27:51] a lot of churches will tell you that
[1:27:54] right you try to live and you find the
[1:27:56] dictates of god's word is for holiness
[1:27:58] and you live a holy standard oh you
[1:28:00] don't have to live like that
[1:28:02] you're under bondage that's what they'll
[1:28:04] do
[1:28:05] right because they themselves fail to
[1:28:08] attain to the place that they see
[1:28:10] and know there's something about your
[1:28:12] life it ain't just the way you dress
[1:28:14] it ain't just the way you talk it's not
[1:28:16] just the way you look or act
[1:28:18] it's not because there's places you
[1:28:19] won't go it's not because that you're
[1:28:21] faithful to christ
[1:28:22] his word and prayer and church it's not
[1:28:25] that
[1:28:26] it's that they know there's something
[1:28:28] there beyond all that
[1:28:30] right and they know that it's good it's
[1:28:33] honest it's pure it's holy it's
[1:28:35] righteous
[1:28:36] they know that but all they can do is
[1:28:40] attack
[1:28:41] oh you don't have to live like that you
[1:28:43] don't have to dress like that
[1:28:45] jesus loves you anyway
[1:28:48] right jesus loves you he just is
[1:28:51] concerned with what's on the inside
[1:28:53] yeah but if what's on the inside is
[1:28:56] going to manifest what's on the outside
[1:28:58] it proves what's on the inside and if
[1:29:01] what's on the outside is not reflecting
[1:29:03] jesus christ in the word then you can
[1:29:05] pretty well assume what's on the inside
[1:29:08] isn't jesus christ or the word amen
[1:29:10] that's right
[1:29:12] but all they can do is put it down
[1:29:15] scoffers
[1:29:16] they're walking after their own lust and
[1:29:18] they try to convince you
[1:29:20] to walk this way walk after your own
[1:29:23] lusts
[1:29:24] and you'll be happy just like i am
[1:29:26] they're not happy
[1:29:28] i'm sorry friend those people aren't
[1:29:29] happy it don't matter how much money
[1:29:32] they got those people are plum miserable
[1:29:35] and they know it but they try to hide it
[1:29:38] by detracting
[1:29:40] by deflecting by putting you down
[1:29:44] by trying to make you look like that you
[1:29:46] aren't what you say you are
[1:29:48] when you know god has called you to a
[1:29:51] higher walk
[1:29:52] you know god has called you to a higher
[1:29:54] calling god has called you to be his
[1:29:56] child and to live according to his word
[1:29:58] and they know that
[1:30:00] right they're mad because they can't do
[1:30:02] it right
[1:30:03] and they're scoffers because of it
[1:30:07] they make fun of you that's right talk
[1:30:09] about you
[1:30:10] put you down because of that
[1:30:14] oh you look silly you look foolish why
[1:30:16] don't you cut off that nasty hair
[1:30:17] you ever heard that anybody ever sisters
[1:30:21] you ever heard that
[1:30:22] i've had my family members told that
[1:30:26] i've had my mother told why don't you
[1:30:28] cut that nasty hair off by her own
[1:30:30] family
[1:30:31] right but what are they doing they're
[1:30:34] just lashing out
[1:30:36] because they don't live that way they
[1:30:38] know there's something to it
[1:30:40] because they see a life behind the hair
[1:30:44] amen they see a life behind the dress
[1:30:48] they see a life behind the godliness and
[1:30:50] holiness
[1:30:51] they see the life they know you're
[1:30:53] different
[1:30:54] right amen james i i do want to get to
[1:30:59] this
[1:31:00] i got four or five more scriptures
[1:31:04] and i'm about out of time but let's go
[1:31:05] to james
[1:31:10] james chapter one
[1:31:17] praise the lord amen
[1:31:24] i don't know how many times probably not
[1:31:26] micah so much but tabitha got asked in
[1:31:28] school
[1:31:29] why do you look like that why do you
[1:31:30] dress like that
[1:31:32] why is your hair like that you know is
[1:31:35] it your religion
[1:31:36] you know of course in pine top you they
[1:31:38] think you're mormons
[1:31:40] me and roger did a job the other day and
[1:31:42] the guy asked us are you mormons
[1:31:44] you know because mormons have a
[1:31:45] reputation of living being decent
[1:31:47] moral people and you know not being
[1:31:49] pierced and tatted everywhere so you
[1:31:51] know they're
[1:31:51] kind of kind of look like that clean and
[1:31:55] whatever you'd say
[1:31:56] and are you mormons not mormons just
[1:31:59] just godly bible-believing
[1:32:01] ministers christians you know but
[1:32:05] i can't tell you how many times she
[1:32:06] probably got asked that question just
[1:32:08] tell them
[1:32:10] i live my life according to the bible
[1:32:13] amen what the bible says that's how i
[1:32:15] try to live my life amen
[1:32:17] does that sound good amen or do your
[1:32:19] parents make you do that
[1:32:21] no my parents don't have to make me i
[1:32:23] want to
[1:32:25] that's where you need to be oh no my
[1:32:27] parents don't make me i live this way
[1:32:29] because i want to live this way
[1:32:30] i dress like this because i want to be
[1:32:32] pleasing to my lord i love the lord
[1:32:34] jesus
[1:32:35] he is my life and i want to be pleasing
[1:32:37] to it
[1:32:38] that's simple amen james 1 13
[1:32:41] let no man say when he is tempted i am
[1:32:44] tempted of god look at this
[1:32:45] right this is something a lot of people
[1:32:47] now of course message people mostly
[1:32:50] understand this but there's people out
[1:32:52] in the world that they
[1:32:53] actually literally think that god tempts
[1:32:55] them
[1:32:56] god may allow the devil to do something
[1:32:59] right god doesn't tempt a person
[1:33:02] that's what the bible says let no man
[1:33:04] say when he is tempted i'm tempted of
[1:33:06] god for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:33:09] neither tempteth any man amen god
[1:33:12] doesn't do that
[1:33:12] right he might allow the devil to do
[1:33:14] something to you or attempt your test
[1:33:16] or whatever their tests come but they
[1:33:18] don't god doesn't directly do that see
[1:33:20] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:33:24] drawn away of his
[1:33:25] own lust and enticed so look at this
[1:33:28] progression here because i'll probably
[1:33:30] end with this
[1:33:34] maybe i have one more scripture anyway
[1:33:37] follow this progression here
[1:33:44] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[1:33:47] away of his
[1:33:48] own lust and enticed right
[1:33:51] so the temptation comes when he is drawn
[1:33:55] away
[1:33:55] by his own lusts right
[1:33:59] he is tempted when he is taken away by
[1:34:01] his
[1:34:02] own lust and when you're taken away and
[1:34:05] drawn
[1:34:06] out of we'll say away from god the word
[1:34:10] the blood of christ then
[1:34:13] you become tempted and when you become
[1:34:16] tempted of your own lust through your
[1:34:19] own mind through your own spirit
[1:34:21] imagination affection reason memory
[1:34:24] then you become enticed that's the
[1:34:27] enticement the temptation
[1:34:29] is the enticement but you're not tempted
[1:34:32] or enticed
[1:34:33] until you allow yourself to be drawn
[1:34:36] away
[1:34:37] in your own lust right hide yourselves
[1:34:40] in the word
[1:34:41] friend and the temptation's not there
[1:34:43] right your own
[1:34:44] lust does not exist when you are hiding
[1:34:47] your life
[1:34:48] in the word amen temptation is not there
[1:34:52] the enticement is not there keep
[1:34:55] yourself
[1:34:56] in christ in the word
[1:34:59] and the temptation's not there even when
[1:35:02] the desire
[1:35:03] to strike back at somebody who has
[1:35:06] struck at you
[1:35:08] and trust me we're all in flesh we're
[1:35:10] all humans
[1:35:14] don't think that any of us are exempt
[1:35:15] from that because we're all in the flesh
[1:35:17] and human
[1:35:18] right you must resist that devil and
[1:35:20] flee from him
[1:35:21] right amen resist that devil get thee
[1:35:24] behind me satan
[1:35:26] and if somebody lashes out then you just
[1:35:28] you know you just stay godly and calm
[1:35:31] and just be the christian you are that
[1:35:33] way you're not
[1:35:35] tempted you're not enticed amen
[1:35:38] right you don't follow with your own
[1:35:40] lust that's the first step
[1:35:42] see if you don't allow yourself to get
[1:35:44] into that position
[1:35:46] you won't be enticed right then when
[1:35:49] lost but not the progression continues
[1:35:52] let's just say someone's been pulled out
[1:35:53] into their own lust
[1:35:55] then when lust has conceived now what is
[1:35:58] conception
[1:36:00] conception is when a seed has been
[1:36:02] planted right
[1:36:03] amen a seed is planted is conception
[1:36:06] whether with a child with a human when
[1:36:08] the seed is planted that's conception
[1:36:11] not bird conception so when the
[1:36:13] conception takes place
[1:36:16] after that lust the seed has been
[1:36:18] dropped
[1:36:19] well the seed is something that is
[1:36:22] planted that comes
[1:36:23] and and will come forth but it it that
[1:36:26] seed has life in it
[1:36:29] event that it's given life
[1:36:32] first it did not have life to it but
[1:36:34] when the seed drops in
[1:36:36] there's life now the life is going to be
[1:36:39] a representative
[1:36:40] of what the seed is and if the seed is a
[1:36:44] seed of enticement or temptation or lust
[1:36:47] then what is going to branch from that
[1:36:49] seed
[1:36:51] filth unbridled filth
[1:36:54] amen so the next progression after the
[1:36:57] temptation
[1:36:58] enticement is the conception
[1:37:02] then at lust brings conception a seed
[1:37:05] has been dropped a seed has been planted
[1:37:08] then it bringeth forth what that seed
[1:37:12] brings forth
[1:37:13] is sin unbelief
[1:37:16] brings forth sin and sin when it is
[1:37:18] finished
[1:37:19] brings forth death best thing to do
[1:37:23] don't re let yourself get into the place
[1:37:25] of the enticement
[1:37:26] the temptation but even in that point
[1:37:30] that lust because that lust will
[1:37:32] generate conception a seed will get
[1:37:34] dropped usually the seed will drop into
[1:37:35] your mind
[1:37:36] reach into your heart amen as a man
[1:37:39] think within his heart so
[1:37:40] is he would would drop down into a
[1:37:42] person's heart because that's where the
[1:37:44] sin
[1:37:44] uh comes from it can be conceived in the
[1:37:46] mind but it
[1:37:48] drops into the womb then it brings forth
[1:37:50] the life that whatever it is in it
[1:37:52] amen it doesn't understand it can be
[1:37:55] conceived in the mind but it doesn't
[1:37:57] bring forth life in the mind it brings
[1:37:59] forth life from the heart
[1:38:01] the life comes from the heart the bible
[1:38:04] doesn't say as a man thinketh he is
[1:38:06] no uh or in his mind think it in his
[1:38:08] heart
[1:38:10] so it can be conceived up here because
[1:38:12] you know these endless we have these big
[1:38:14] old ears and eyes and things and
[1:38:16] you know those things can bring forth
[1:38:17] lust and thoughts and stuff and it might
[1:38:19] be a seed dropped and conceived
[1:38:21] but then when that thing drops down into
[1:38:23] your heart then that seed starts
[1:38:25] bringing forth life
[1:38:27] because from the heart you begin to do
[1:38:30] and live
[1:38:31] and act and talk and it could be as
[1:38:34] quickly
[1:38:35] as let's just take the example i said
[1:38:38] someone
[1:38:38] is berating you or speaking angrily
[1:38:42] towards you
[1:38:43] it can be you've left by your own lust
[1:38:46] the seed is dropped and you're speaking
[1:38:48] something negative or saying
[1:38:50] foul words or being horrible to somebody
[1:38:52] before you hardly even know what's going
[1:38:54] on
[1:38:55] it can be that fast it can be just like
[1:38:58] this
[1:38:58] you say with this three-step process you
[1:39:00] know first i do it and it's a while and
[1:39:02] this happens and this happens no
[1:39:05] it can be just like this it can be that
[1:39:08] fast
[1:39:09] yes first thing stay guarded by the word
[1:39:12] amen don't let that come into your life
[1:39:14] into your heart
[1:39:15] and then stand forth because when it
[1:39:17] does that sin
[1:39:19] that's that that seed that's conceived
[1:39:21] that drops into the heart
[1:39:23] that brings forth life that life leads
[1:39:26] you to death
[1:39:27] right that life that seed
[1:39:31] that sin that is conceived brings death
[1:39:34] that's his progression the finish of it
[1:39:38] he says is when it bringeth forth death
[1:39:41] god help us i don't want to be dead what
[1:39:44] is death
[1:39:45] death is eternal separation from god
[1:39:49] i dares believe any of us in here none
[1:39:52] of us want to be eternally separated
[1:39:54] from god
[1:39:55] period amen regardless circumstances or
[1:39:58] where it goes comes
[1:40:00] nobody wants to be separated from god
[1:40:03] do not air my beloved brother
[1:40:07] do not err do not fall by the by this
[1:40:11] by the the desire of that sin
[1:40:15] the desire the lust that lust that lust
[1:40:18] is an
[1:40:19] inordinate sinful pleasure desire
[1:40:22] inordinate inordinate means unnatural
[1:40:25] right
[1:40:26] it's not a natural desire our natural
[1:40:29] desires are for jesus christ for god the
[1:40:31] word that's our natural desire really
[1:40:34] because of what our soul is see our our
[1:40:37] desire
[1:40:37] and when you're born in sin shaped naked
[1:40:39] economy world speaking lines
[1:40:40] all that we have is what's filthy of the
[1:40:42] world
[1:40:44] but then god has a a way of
[1:40:48] molding and shaping us from that point
[1:40:51] using our parents to mold in shape and
[1:40:54] bring us to that place that's why
[1:40:57] that's why so many times that's why
[1:41:00] that's why so many people are
[1:41:01] millionaires today
[1:41:03] offer writing millions of books on how
[1:41:06] to raise a child
[1:41:07] right and i'm sorry friend but ain't one
[1:41:11] of them right
[1:41:13] except this one right this is the only
[1:41:17] one that's right
[1:41:18] this is the only and best book on how to
[1:41:21] rear children
[1:41:22] yes all the others come from a seat of
[1:41:24] education and some
[1:41:26] man's thinking they're not
[1:41:29] all i'm right but they're all
[1:41:30] millionaires because they sold all kinds
[1:41:31] of books on how to raise children
[1:41:33] how to raise your child when
[1:41:36] priscilla and angel got all y'all set in
[1:41:39] here
[1:41:40] could stand up right now and tell you
[1:41:41] every one of you is different
[1:41:43] and ain't one book written except this
[1:41:45] one this holy bible
[1:41:46] that would actually orchestrate them and
[1:41:49] reason
[1:41:50] you properly none of them right
[1:41:53] ain't one because you're different than
[1:41:55] you and you
[1:41:56] and you and you joel emma me micah
[1:41:59] tabitha
[1:42:00] all different right you so people take a
[1:42:03] book and say
[1:42:04] oh i'm gonna raise my children buy this
[1:42:06] book and that those children might not
[1:42:08] even fit that book not even one iota
[1:42:12] and even if it did a little bit it's not
[1:42:14] probably not going to be for the next
[1:42:16] child
[1:42:17] the only one that works is this holy
[1:42:18] bible yes it's only when it works
[1:42:21] if you go outside the pages of this
[1:42:23] bible or you try to do anything
[1:42:25] different than what this bible says
[1:42:27] then you're going to have consequences
[1:42:28] right because you're continually
[1:42:30] fighting
[1:42:32] continually fighting against a child
[1:42:35] who has been born in sin right
[1:42:38] shaped in iniquity their nature is to
[1:42:41] lie to you
[1:42:42] yes and you're teaching them to be right
[1:42:45] you're trying to teach them what is the
[1:42:47] correct and right way
[1:42:49] the constant battle is going to be but
[1:42:51] my flesh wants to do this
[1:42:53] right my desire wants to do this the
[1:42:56] lost in my flesh is to be like this
[1:42:59] and the parents are like if you go that
[1:43:01] way you're going to be a horrible person
[1:43:03] and you're going to go to hell that's
[1:43:06] why we're trying to
[1:43:08] teach you so that you know and by god's
[1:43:11] grace if they finally do get to the asia
[1:43:14] they understand all that they're like i
[1:43:16] understand that
[1:43:17] right i get it it makes sense
[1:43:20] sometimes it comes a little earlier to
[1:43:22] some sometimes a little later
[1:43:24] but most of the time if it's done right
[1:43:26] they'll eventually get it
[1:43:28] and they'll eventually understand now
[1:43:30] parents aren't always perfect either so
[1:43:33] there's some things that probably never
[1:43:35] get understood because
[1:43:37] it probably wasn't correctly done to
[1:43:39] begin with but we do the best we can
[1:43:41] with
[1:43:42] i mean how many times with me and my
[1:43:43] wife like honey
[1:43:45] we did the best we could with what god
[1:43:48] gave us at the time and the information
[1:43:49] we had and everything we did the best we
[1:43:51] could
[1:43:52] in prayer and uh and then we just had
[1:43:54] you had to leave the rest of the lord
[1:43:56] yes amen i do want to read one more
[1:43:58] scripture though
[1:43:59] my times got away but galatians chapter
[1:44:04] 5.
[1:44:08] galatians chapter 5
[1:44:11] i want to begin reading with verse 16.
[1:44:21] amen unfortunately it seems like a lot
[1:44:23] of times and
[1:44:25] and and i'll just say in the christian
[1:44:26] world a lot of people like to use the
[1:44:29] grace of god as a crutch
[1:44:31] for their lustful desires their lust
[1:44:34] lustly fleshly desires and how they want
[1:44:37] to live and be
[1:44:38] and do and act they use the grace of god
[1:44:41] as a crutch
[1:44:42] that helps them justify that
[1:44:47] galatians chapter 5 verse 16
[1:44:51] this i say then listen very closely
[1:44:55] listen very closely this i say then
[1:44:58] walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[1:45:02] fulfill
[1:45:03] the lust of the flesh amen amen
[1:45:06] best advice now i mean i want to read
[1:45:08] some more here but
[1:45:10] that scripture basically sums it up what
[1:45:12] did he say
[1:45:14] what did paul tell the galatians walk in
[1:45:16] the spirit
[1:45:17] not walking in the lust see that's our
[1:45:20] title today
[1:45:21] walking in lust walk in the spirit
[1:45:24] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:45:26] flesh
[1:45:29] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:45:32] and the spirit against the flesh
[1:45:36] if you get a revelation of that
[1:45:37] especially young people it will help you
[1:45:40] out in your life as much as anything
[1:45:41] amen the flesh
[1:45:45] listen very closely the flesh lusteth
[1:45:49] against the spirit that's right s that's
[1:45:52] capital s
[1:45:53] spirit of god not your own human spirit
[1:45:56] right the flesh lust against the spirit
[1:45:59] of god
[1:45:59] and the spirit of god against the flesh
[1:46:02] right amen and these are contrary to one
[1:46:06] to the other
[1:46:07] so that ye cannot do the things that you
[1:46:09] would but if you would be led of the
[1:46:11] spirit you are not
[1:46:13] under the law now the works of the flesh
[1:46:17] are manifest which are these adultery
[1:46:20] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[1:46:22] there's that word again
[1:46:24] idolatry witchcraft hatred variants
[1:46:26] emulations wrath strife seditions
[1:46:28] heresies
[1:46:29] endings murders drunkenness revelings
[1:46:31] and such like
[1:46:32] of the which i tell you before as i have
[1:46:34] told you in the time past
[1:46:36] that they which do such things shall not
[1:46:39] inherit the kingdom of god
[1:46:41] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:46:44] amen brother but the fruit of the spirit
[1:46:49] is love not human love people out here
[1:46:52] think they love
[1:46:55] they don't they might have a little
[1:46:57] filio for someone who's washed their
[1:46:59] back or something
[1:47:00] but they don't have love the only way
[1:47:02] you can have
[1:47:03] love this love is to be born again only
[1:47:06] way you can have this love is to be born
[1:47:08] again
[1:47:08] right because this love is god's love
[1:47:11] the only way you get it is from him
[1:47:13] when his indwelling presence comes in
[1:47:15] you
[1:47:17] through the spirit is love joy peace
[1:47:19] long suffering
[1:47:20] gentleness goodness faith how many of
[1:47:22] these attributes you see most people
[1:47:24] living today
[1:47:27] i hurt somebody
[1:47:31] yeah pretty hard to find right meekness
[1:47:33] temperance against such there is no law
[1:47:36] and they that are christ have crucified
[1:47:38] the flesh
[1:47:39] with the afflict with the affections and
[1:47:41] lusts if we live in the spirit let us
[1:47:44] also
[1:47:44] walk in the spirit let us not be
[1:47:46] desirous of vain glory provoking one
[1:47:48] another
[1:47:49] or envying one another amen
[1:47:53] we walk in the spirit not in the flesh
[1:47:56] walk by the word not by our own lust
[1:47:59] we walk by the dictates of god's word
[1:48:02] not by what somebody told us
[1:48:04] in some school or seminary or
[1:48:08] government amen walk according to god's
[1:48:11] word
[1:48:12] and let god be our let god be our
[1:48:15] portion
[1:48:17] this is satan's evening all of
[1:48:20] civilization
[1:48:21] excuse me friend but all of civilization
[1:48:23] has fallen under this lust
[1:48:28] science education
[1:48:32] nothing wrong with having an education
[1:48:34] we need it to survive and live in this
[1:48:36] world

[1:48:44] give of themselves
[1:48:46] yes some of them make you know they make
[1:48:48] a decent living too but they give of
[1:48:50] themselves
[1:48:51] that's wonderful police are military
[1:48:56] wonderful people love them they do some
[1:48:59] of the most difficult
[1:49:00] jobs that exist on this planet policing
[1:49:03] other humans lostful desires
[1:49:06] right policing others lustful desires
[1:49:10] is not a desirable job but they do it
[1:49:14] and most of them don't get paid a lot of
[1:49:16] money either right
[1:49:17] this is not a huge compensation
[1:49:20] but all that's of the devil education
[1:49:24] schools now you go to school i'm not
[1:49:28] saying don't go to school don't learn
[1:49:30] schools education doctor's medicine
[1:49:32] hospitals police
[1:49:34] military it's all the devil
[1:49:38] amen all the devil this whole
[1:49:40] civilization
[1:49:41] has fallen into that lust because this
[1:49:43] is satan's evil
[1:49:44] right we are the minority this bride
[1:49:48] is the minority this bride is the
[1:49:52] is the small little flock
[1:49:55] that jesus said for us not to fear right
[1:49:58] little flock
[1:49:58] for it's god's good pleasure to give us
[1:50:01] the kingdom right
[1:50:02] amen the kingdom that we talked about
[1:50:04] all this time down from eve
[1:50:06] cain uh uh israel under balaam
[1:50:11] saul uh samson down to
[1:50:14] judas judas iscariot fell under this
[1:50:18] lust
[1:50:19] and became servants to it
[1:50:23] and live that life amen
[1:50:27] but god has called this bride this last
[1:50:29] day to live a higher life
[1:50:30] amen he's called us to live a higher
[1:50:32] plane
[1:50:33] he's called us to live the word that god
[1:50:35] has put in his word
[1:50:37] gentleness meekness temperance patience
[1:50:42] what is that those are foreign words

[1:50:50] patience temperance loving one another
[1:50:52] joy peace
[1:50:54] having temperance patience endeavoring
[1:50:57] to have unity that's that's a tough one

[1:51:04] all those things lust against your flesh
[1:51:08] spirit lust against the flesh amen

[1:51:25] praise the lord god help us
[1:51:28] to be more like him yes more like
[1:51:32] he calls us and his word to be hema
[1:51:37] that's one reason we read the bible we
[1:51:40] read the bible because that's what tells
[1:51:42] us what's pleasing to the lord
[1:51:43] yes that's what tells us what what uh
[1:51:46] how he lived
[1:51:48] how he did it what did he do when
[1:51:51] he was approached with people like that
[1:51:54] he faced scoffers
[1:51:55] not like this last day jesus had plenty
[1:51:58] of scholars
[1:52:01] the pharisees and sadducees hated jesus
[1:52:04] absolutely despised jesus but that was
[1:52:07] because he would have
[1:52:09] he was living a plain a level of
[1:52:12] righteousness that they
[1:52:13] could not do so what they do they just
[1:52:16] put it down
[1:52:18] they dismiss it by putting you down
[1:52:21] putting it down they put him down if
[1:52:24] they put him down and talked about him
[1:52:25] like that what do you think they're
[1:52:26] going to do to you if you love him and
[1:52:28] want to live like him and
[1:52:29] believe pleasing to him what do you
[1:52:30] think they're going to do to you right
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:41] [Applause]
[1:52:42] amen

[1:54:16] your heart that's
[1:54:19] filled with your love
[1:54:23] and make me
[1:54:26] more likely
[1:54:32] now won't you live
[1:54:36] the way jesus
[1:54:39] wants me to live
[1:54:43] i want to give
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:47] until there's just no
[1:54:51] more to give
[1:54:54] i want to love
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:54:57] love till there's just no more
[1:55:12] let's sing it this way now i'm going to
[1:55:16] live the way
[1:55:20] jesus wants me
[1:55:23] to live i'm going to
[1:55:26] give until
[1:55:29] there's just no more to
[1:55:33] give i'm going to love
[1:55:38] love till there's just
[1:55:42] no more love
[1:55:54] hallelujah is that your determination
[1:55:57] today
[1:55:58] yeah amen you know friend it
[1:56:01] sure seems to give us a lot of insight
[1:56:03] if we just look at the scripture and we
[1:56:05] can
[1:56:06] identify and see what's going on in the
[1:56:08] world today
[1:56:10] get an idea of it but it becomes so
[1:56:12] clear when you see it in the word and
[1:56:14] you think lord
[1:56:15] keep me from that lord i don't want to
[1:56:18] be that way
[1:56:19] amen and the problem so many people fall
[1:56:22] into
[1:56:23] is that they think in their righteous
[1:56:25] indignation
[1:56:26] that they're going to meet that
[1:56:28] challenge on the same
[1:56:30] level that those people brought
[1:56:33] you don't meet people's challenges in
[1:56:36] the same way that they brought it
[1:56:38] because that makes you just like them
[1:56:42] you meet the challenge by the way of the
[1:56:44] word
[1:56:45] and christ and the way that god brings
[1:56:48] and meets that challenge not the way
[1:56:50] they do don't stoop to their level
[1:56:54] but rise above that amen and meet the
[1:56:58] challenge based on
[1:56:59] christ and his word and his spirit in
[1:57:01] your life
[1:57:03] and that's the best way to think about
[1:57:04] it it's the best way to deal with it
[1:57:07] i like the rest of you get so
[1:57:10] frustrated i guess is the best word to
[1:57:12] say
[1:57:13] with some of the stuff that goes on in
[1:57:15] this country i love today
[1:57:18] it's just it's hard horrible and
[1:57:20] disheartening
[1:57:22] but i can't get myself
[1:57:26] like they are because that makes me just
[1:57:29] like them
[1:57:30] i'm just on this side i'm just on a
[1:57:33] different side
[1:57:34] i don't want to be on a different side i
[1:57:36] want to be on god's side
[1:57:37] yes i want to be on his side
[1:57:41] amen meet the challenge not on your side
[1:57:44] but on
[1:57:44] god's side amen amen because lord knows
[1:57:48] people out in the world today are
[1:57:49] drawing their sides
[1:57:51] they're creating their sides and i've
[1:57:54] told you before i believe that division
[1:57:56] is
[1:57:57] is going to get worse i really do i
[1:57:59] think it's going to get worse
[1:58:01] it's got to get to the place that the
[1:58:03] american people are willing to submit
[1:58:06] everything of their rights and
[1:58:08] everything
[1:58:09] to a one entity and that in the bible we
[1:58:13] know of
[1:58:14] is the beast that's it and it's getting
[1:58:16] there
[1:58:17] yes it's getting there very quickly amen
[1:58:20] it's become so divided it's become so
[1:58:23] divided
[1:58:24] it's in the position that it's ready to
[1:58:26] be united
[1:58:28] amen and it's going to take that one
[1:58:30] person he's going to come through and
[1:58:32] he's going to say how wonderful how
[1:58:33] beautiful and how great
[1:58:35] and just give me everything not just all
[1:58:37] your money they've already garnered all
[1:58:39] the money in the world but give me now
[1:58:40] all of your rights
[1:58:42] give me all of your freedom he's already
[1:58:43] been out speaking against america
[1:58:46] he spoke against our voting rights he
[1:58:49] spoke against our
[1:58:50] our form of government he spoke against
[1:58:52] our form of economy
[1:58:55] what's he doing he's come he's ready to
[1:58:58] take it over
[1:58:59] that's right amen that's where we're at
[1:59:02] that's where we're living amen but don't
[1:59:04] be on north side
[1:59:05] be on god's side don't take either side
[1:59:08] take god's side
[1:59:09] amen god will fight your battles yes
