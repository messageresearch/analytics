you may as well give it up god hasn't called you he hasn't chosen you that's not true lord god that's just the part where satan can dally around in and discourage us in lord the flesh the works of the flesh the works the laborers of the flesh but as you showed me this morning lord i'm sure you've showed us all but the fruit that stood out to me this morning the fruit of the spirit i said wait a minute the works of the flesh thank you doing something you're putting forth the toil and effort such as keeping the law trying to work it out yourself but he said the that's the works of the best but the fruit of the spirit in that word stood out this is fruit fruit can be plucked from the trees it's something that's chosen even like a catching away when god catches his children while he's plucking that fruit out from the earth there's no work it's a fruit people want to eat from that tree yes oh my there's such a difference lord god and you bring forth that fruit lord god in your time in your own way no works works of the holy spirit but it's your fruit lord it's your life that does that yes not us lord we appreciate you father thank you for showing yourself to us lord yes for

each every one of you um my dad's memorial was yesterday but today i was saying something just for our church family and my mom really wanted to speak out give thanks to each and every one of you because during this time um you i like like i told her and she saw it firsthand that the lord is so amazing she saw the love and the generosity and uh the helping hands that came forward to help her during his time from my dad and um it really amazes me to know that god is that he's so mindful of us for every little detail just anything and i'm each and every one of us have something to do to to lift each other up and it's just amazing amen and you know there's so many tests but so many things that could i could see that have happened um during this time and uh i know i didn't share a lot really yesterday and um i do have a quick little story that i wanted to share about my dad and i shared yesterday but um it was basically my dad because one of it he really loved to make people laugh and smile and and um feel good you know come on come on he's okay i'm good right here okay sorry [Music] my mom and my dad one day were at walmart and uh um this little girl she kept looking at my dad and uh he had his long white beard his white hair they were walking around and he kept noticing her and finally you know she said in spanish or her brother was older he said uh she said that's santa claus and he looked at her you know being the boy he's like that's not sad there's no such thing and blah blah blah blah i said no no she kept looking and looking well it sat upon my dad that he wanted to say something but he didn't know what to say it just amazes me though because even though he knows little girl's name he said he looked at her and he told her that it's okay my dear and that she's been a really good girl and her eyes got like 10 times as big and she's like and she said in spanish oh my god he knows my name that's santa claus i told you and she looked to her brother and told him basically you know that he was he was bad all year so he wasn't getting them and made my dad just feel really good you know and it's just amazing because even the little mindful things even though we know the truth of that you know he made that little girl's day and it's how my dad was and he was always he loved music he loved songs i told the brothers he loved guitar the town he loved the music he loved being here he loved you just seeing the love that flow through here and and and my mom has seen it and you know and i praise god because she's now sitting here with us and you know she's making plans to you know get more involved and it's amazing and so saints you just keep my brother in mind as well because he's battling yeah but other than that i mean you guys were amazing every one of you if i had a billion dollars i'd give you all of it right now because what you guys have shown is beyond it's not worldly and this world will never understand it that's right and i

strength [Music] both in body and in mind to the peak is a distance on my own i cannot so this journey of a thousand steps begins right here on my knees [Music] i never [Music] amen i may face things tomorrow that i can't comprehend today certain stances so uncertain make it hard to find the strength to pray [Music] but i'm living in his promise i'll never leave you hallelujah [Music] oh [Music]

mountains [Music] grace [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] yes thank you lord starting to hear the words of these songs not just the good melody but the what they're telling us amen

dine amen we have a pastor come amen amen you do not see it there we go [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] yesterday was having lunch with frios and uh about him putting that fish on the fire yes amen exactly right we're talking about sushi remember jesus putting a vision on the fire cook fish amen this morning amen um amen amen let's sing that song as our pastor comes come holy spirit amen amen yes come the holy spirit [Music] come the holy spirit i pray yes [Music] um [Music] yes [Music] amen you know without him all of this is in vain without him coming and taking control of this service and having his will and weight in it none of this matters amen we just might as well go back to longhorn again and have a little fellowship because without him amen even without him and our fellowship what good is our fellowship amen but we're thankful that the god promised that he would be where two or three are gathered in his name amen and friend we didn't come in the name of a church a denomination or a pastor we come in the name of the lord jesus christ and name that's above every name amen praise the lord jesus god bless you appreciate each one of you coming being here today in the house of the lord amen thank the lord for his goodness to us enjoy this memorial service yesterday believe it was uh of the lord i believe it was a a blessing to the family and i know what helped me and it's just has to do with a lot of settling in your spirit you realize some things you don't understand or realize that's going on it's the time we we understand all the things that affect our flesh all the time but you know the things that affect our spirit a lot of times we don't it doesn't register real true or right away but you realize maybe later on that you know an event something like that yesterday just kind of gives a little closure right it helps you be able to move on it helps you be able to go forward and realize that the lord has me here for a purpose and fulfilling whatever that purpose is is what the lord called in my life so in our lives and what we do and that's why a lot of times we do what we do amen it's obviously to commemorate someone like brother angel and his life and what he meant to so many people and but it also has everything to do with with the alive and remain the people that are still here and still living through this life and day to day making it to the glory of the lord the best of our abilities amen praise the lord like mike is saying a lot of may sound look like huge mountains when you approach them amen but once you look at it from god's point of view actually uh i like the words on this on the song because uh it's it you know it's it's very energizing and it helps you but actually if you go to if you've ever gone to google earth and you looked at it from straight down it doesn't even look like a hill it's just flat it's not even a hill from heaven's point of view it means nothing from heaven's point of view amen it's just straight and solid and flat and narrow and amen the place and the way that god provides for us so amen appreciate those of you who came yesterday i was part of the memorial service if you didn't see it you didn't stream it uh it is archived on youtube and on our webpage so if you do want to see this on our website and youtube if you'd like to view that in at a future time so amen so god bless you i enjoyed uh the songs and um we're gonna have our communion service this afternoon so we'll just get right into the word here uh if you'd stand to your feet if you could one more time we look in our bibles first thessalonians chapter four first thessalonians chapter four sorry about that i'm like got to get used to that amen we're going to keep using the mic i got to get used to turning it on kind of i've been preaching so long without a microphone and you forget that the microphone actually has to be on before it amplifies the only way it works right so i just i got to get used to doing that so my apologies i know you've probably all heard me well enough but um but it's it's for amplification now but it's also for the camera uh sound goes in the camera for the streaming so that uh it it can hopefully be heard a little bit better when it's streamed and when it's archived and by the way i would i would like to say how much i appreciate brother roger collins for loaning us the equipment the sound equipment for we can have for this memorial service yesterday so it really made a huge difference in a lot of cases to be able to have uh voices amplified and we actually got to hear the precious sisters sing yesterday because they amplified and you could hear their voices so i appreciate brother roger loaning us the equipment it's not ours so um shall i say don't get used to it maybe but uh i appreciate brother roger loaning that to us before we could have and so we added up for memorial service yesterday so we'll just keep it up for today and uh see where it goes from there but i appreciate brother roger loaning that to us so amen before we read the word we just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could precious lord jesus we are so very thankful father of your blessings and your love and your mercy and the grace that you give every day lord expecting and believing you to be with us once again lord for your holy spirit to have preeminence and for you to get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done here today truly lord every one of us here lord are insufficient to the task ahead the lord were believing god that you would come and speak that you would come and listen that you would come and take complete control of every facet of this service and every person that is here in every way speaker here that lord whatever you have to be accomplished in this service today it will be done for your glory and honor yes thank you lord for those that have come father thank you for your hand of mercy upon their lives and bringing them here those who may be streaming today lord we just thank you god for each one of them we thank you for you most of all lord in your prayer there's blood that you shed god to redeem our souls back to you lord that was lost there in the garden of eden but lord to you god for this service we give you thanks and praise lord and pray again that you'd have complete control and use us lord for your glory and honor speak once again in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent with them which are asleep the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel the trump of god the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you can be seated if you'd like amen we uh also like to mention we had a really good time of service here wednesday night uh felt the presence of the lord really strong and enjoyed brother benny perry and his ministry what he had to say to us a very challenging wednesday night and encouraging and blessing and of course the group that you brought with them and the songs they sing and just uh just felt a little more a little at home there uh like because they're from south carolina so uh just felt like uh one of the old revivals i used to go to a little bit but enjoyed the service here wednesday night enjoyed brother vinnie coming and we again that just was the first wednesday night we're gonna continue to have wednesday night services seven o'clock so you can make it now we just had the same scripture reading i i won't uh be too long today since we're going to go out get a bite come back uh around three o'clock today so we'll just see we maybe cut this short around 12 inches so just having the lord leads but trusting his uh uh his leadership in this but uh i want to speak on today the fact that um the catching away or the rapture is not a unique concept it's nothing new uh we talk about it often and again like we've said before we talk about it in the context that this uh great supernatural event that's going to take place i believe is taking place but it's going to culminate with the changing of our bodies is is is going on now but it's not something that's new it's not something that's different uh there's been uh several raptures if you know that's already taken place in the bible you know there's four raptures that we know of scripturally precedent that that has happened in the in the bible already we've mentioned them a few times as we've gone along through this uh study this is the rapture part 16 by the way but we've talked about some of those and we've kind of hit some of the highlights but i want to explore some of them a little bit deeper if we will and kind of take some of what brother branham mentioned in the rapture message if you ever listen to the rapture message or maybe at least since we started this series uh that you've listened to the rapture message and uh it's kind of been 17 parts to something brother branham condensed into like an hour hour and a half but uh a lot of a lot of other things that brother branham is is is like those mountain peaks you know that uh spell out his name brother branham just kind of hit this top here and he skipped and hit this top here and he kind of skipped and hit this top here but there are so many other underlying things in the scripture that could go with every one of the points that brother branham made in that period of time and i trust and pray that's kind of what we've tried to do is go into a little more depth into each one of those subjects and each one of those points and parts and things i'm sure brother branham would have liked to have said about the rapture but just didn't have the time right you know brother branham uh in that uh in yuma there when they had that banquet room like 30 minutes into his message a woman was coming through apparently telling him to leave uh you hear brother branham on tape saying oh they want the room they want us to leave we need to hurry and he spends another 45 minutes preaching uh it was not nothing was going to stop that not even a woman back there pointing at her watch and say hurry up we got to get the room for somebody else he kept going but i'm sure there's probably other things maybe that we've explored that he may have had even in his notes or something because you know after that he went to california and he spoke some on the rapture over there and hit some of the highlights there too so but we like to just try to since we a pastor and we have the opportunity and the the services to do it we uh just like to try to take and take it maybe a little bit deeper and maybe even read the scripture about each one of those the very first rapture that we know of recorded than the bible was does anybody know enoch enoch's the very first rapture that was recorded in the scripture so if we go back to genesis chapter 5 we've talked about enoch because of the days of noah and we've talked about the script and we have read this verse of scripture but i want to read it again noah uh uh enoch being that that we find the scriptural precedent of rapture i think it's very important uh to reiterate to read over again because of the significance of that one verse it is genesis chapter 5 of verse 24 genesis 5 24 and enoch walked with god that's the significant part to remember again a few weeks ago we talked about that and the significance of and what that testimony was that enoch had that he pleased god because when god recorded enoch's rapture in in hebrews it was recorded as that enoch had a testimony that he pleased the lord amen so we acquainted and understood that uh a testimony that was pleasing with the lord is somebody that was in the old testament that walked with god the only way to walk with god is to be pleasing to god yeah if god is in a is in a place and there's a holy spirit you know brother adam said when that dove tries to come down and a wolf nature tries to take over that dove will take his flight right yeah that double leaf it's not going to walk or dwell with anything that is not according to the spirit of god in his word so for someone to have the uh a testimony that they walked with god that meant that their life was pleasing to the lord yeah and that is a great testimony to happen and that testimony is going to be something that's going to ring true in heaven it's going to read true with god and of course it's going to find its effects on the earth every christian and every christian today should be in the place in their heart life where they want to desire to walk with the lord and have a walk with the lord because as enoch walked with the lord now it didn't happen with everybody else that walked with the lord as we found out the bible also said that noah walked with god right he got and noah found favor so with god but god had a plan for enoch and god had a different plan for noah right you understand they were both children of god as we'll say but one god took home in a rapture to bring a type and one god took over a tribulation period as a type but both men walked with god right but we know as him being the seventh from adam according to the scripture that the seventh church age that type of the seventh church age who was to walk with god would also be the ones who take that rapture now this was just one man you know it was just one man but it was the it was the the types and the shadows of the old testament showing us what was going to do in the new testament now a lot of times unfortunately especially in the christian world especially when people don't understand it or can't explain it or teach it they try to do away with the old testament oh well not in the old testament anymore friend we don't live the law anymore saints what we do is we live by the dictates of the spirit that is within us if we don't live by the law anymore we might as well go kill and steal and all the other ten commandments do we not still obey them yes we absolutely live them but it's not a law it's a life there's a difference in obeying a law and living a life when you get the holy ghost living by the dictates of god's word becomes a life not a law so it's not a law to us anymore people say oh that was the law we don't live by the law yeah but you live by the holy spirit that is in you that is going to cause you to live by all the word of god you don't get to pick and choose amen you don't get to say oh well we don't do this and we don't do that or well this is okay well this doesn't really matter anymore now obviously some things have have evolved if you will because jesus said that god didn't come to do away with the law he come to magnify the law how many knows that that jesus came to magnify the law he said uh the old the old testament says thou shalt not commit adultery but jesus said i say unto you he that is looked upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already in his heart that is a magnification of the ten commandments so it's magnified itself i had somebody asked and even challenged brother dennis one time well we don't we don't live by the old testament uh do you still sacrifice you do i said i don't raise animals and go slit their throat on on an altar somewhere but i am continually offering up spiritual sacrifices to the lord jesus with the praise of my lips sacrifices all the time spiritual sacrifices they just god just it just magnified itself to us amen made it more real i mean it it became to their sacrifice so uh so uh uh common to them that they're just okay it was time to grab their lamb and they go down they slit his throat they said okay i've done my deed for the day and that's what christian religion has to be called i live whatever life i want to and just say your repentance do your prayers no venus whatever they are and you just pay the priest or you just do whatever and it's going to be okay and if you do end up we'll pray you out of purgatory as long as you got enough money right we'll get you out of purgatory even if you die and you're not right with the lord we'll get you out of there anyway all right how what filth becomes so common to people the sincerity of it was completely lost a lot of times the sincerity of people's worship's completely lost again today amen but it means something to have a walk with god it means something to walk with god god's not gonna walk with something that's not right with him by the way did you notice something different when you came in the parking lot today now i'm going to brag on this because i'm bragging on jesus and i'm bragging on us as a congregation but you just know something that noticed something different when you came in today anybody i already told you notice something different what'd you notice different joel [Music] everybody hear that numbers are gone tattoo shops closing down [Music] i said i said i was sorry for them but then they didn't have a chance right they didn't have a choice and they didn't have a chance day one they moved in we've been praying and i've been laying my hands on that wall praying those people away i said god if there's no spiritual significance for them being here get rid of them right yes wednesday night during church they shut the doors changed the lock and they hadn't been back there's a noticeable there's a notice of default on the window [Music] don't tell me god's not real amen god knows exactly what he's doing and praise god for it amen amen thank god for that enoch walk with god now let's continue on enoch walked with god after he begot methuselah 300 years begot sons and daughters so it was that walk that caused him and and it wasn't just that but it was the placement of that it was that time for it to be that way there was it was not time for there to be a rapture in the first church age second third fourth fifth sixth it was supposed to be by the type of completion 7 that this last church age that was going to have a alive and remain group that was going to go in the rapture now all those that died in christ from that time from the time of the death of christ from that time till now that died in christ are going to raise we know that amen they're going to resurrect and we are all going to go together amen amen enoch was the first one the old testament scripture to to rapture now the second one will go to second kings you probably remember knowing your mind the second rapture second rapture would happen to be a man named elijah right his story is in second kings chapter two amen second kings chapter 2 verse 9. [Music] look at this now and it came to pass let's see i'm trying to hold i don't want to read too much of the story if you want to get more of the story background now with enoch there's not much story background there's not actually a lot recorded about enoch but if you want to go and read a lot of the background of the stories of that please you know feel free for sake of time i just picked a couple of the scriptures of the significant parts that recorded the actual catching away of this individual so there's a there's a lot of background story here we won't go to but uh but just reading the rapture part look now uh second kings 2 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of my spirit be upon me now i i i want to say something here because i've had i've had i've heard a child just say nominal christians say well elisha cut himself short he should have asked for a tenfold portion he should ask for a hundred but i want you to understand that the prophet of god when when god spoke to him about sister hattie god said give her whatever she asked sister hattie could have asked for a billion dollars she could have asked to be the president united states she could have asked for almost anything she wanted to right but god knew what she was going to ask when he gave the prophet permission to get to give her whatever she wanted right he knew what she was going to say yeah she wanted the salvation of her voice she said well why didn't she ask for the salvation of her whole family why didn't she ask for the salvation the whole world why didn't she ask for this that you know because god knew what she was gonna ask right amen god knew what elisha was gonna say and it and it and it wasn't to the point yeah would god have done it sure it would have because that was that was his promise but that's not the point when you've got the spirit of god and you're led by god you sometimes speak and say things in a way or context that may not even be understandable to you but it's god doing it and it's the spirit of god speaking out and the spirit of god in this man only allowed him to say what he said not not a not tenfold not a hundredfold right but double right and that's what he wanted and that's what the spirit in him asked for amen and god blessed him with that god granted that when you read the scripture we see god granted that to him now 10th verse and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be now notice this elijah already knows he's going to be you already know now to what capacity maybe he didn't know we don't know that's not recorded scripturally but he knew right now i i'll challenge you to listen to some of brother branham's last uh uh year or two especially the last ones and listen to the way that brother random talks if you really listen and get the undertone of what brother random is getting especially when he preaches wings of a snow white duck yes you just know now in retrospect it's pretty easy because hindsight is 20 20. and look back and say well i listen and i can i can see that now but he listened in the inflection in his voice something's going on something was about to change brother bannon was about to leave us now elijah is doing that with elisha he knows something's going on he knows the spirit is moving and bringing it to the point that he wasn't going to be with elisha much longer so he tells elisha elisha uh uh i'm going away now after i'm gone what would you like from the lord what would you like the lord to give you elijah says double portion he said that's a hard thing but if you see me when i leave then it will be granted to you when he goes amen now did brother random know he was going to have a car crash yes yeah well on wings of a snow white dove everything that he mentioned the dove had wrong with him is the same thing brother branham had in the rag amen he doesn't say it on tape i didn't ask him personally so i don't know but the fact that he preached that would would lend you to believe that something was going on in the spirit at least anyway right elijah knew now what did he know was going to be a chair of fire whirlwind it doesn't say i very possibly did i don't know but he knew something was going on and he knew a change was coming so he asked us why he asked the question he said if you see me when i'm taken that it shall be so it came to pass 11th verse it came to pass as they still went on and taught that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven amen elisha rancher god taking him didn't taste death body change in a whirlwind took him into a chair now where's the scriptural precedent well the bible says that enoch enoch was and was not god took him for he was walked with god that's all it says now we've got an event of a chariot of fire and horses and a whirlwind that takes elijah up into heaven but the point of it is elisha is being raptured yes elijah was taken from this earth another type now was elisha raptured no he got a double portion of the spirit of god but god did rapture him right different type different purpose you understand see i i don't like so many times that christians even in the message they try to box everybody that they believe is a christian or born again or in the message hey try to box everybody into these little boxes and say you've got to be this you got to do that and you got to say this and god did not make cocky cookie cutter christians god did not have an assembly up in heaven with a with a cookie cutter in hand saying there's this one there's that one there's the next one and sent them down on earth here they go down on earth everybody's going to be the same do the same live the same doesn't work that way god has a separate purpose for every single person that he uh brings upon this earth yes now the process of being born again obviously is the same for everyone but god has a different purpose for everyone and elijah's purpose for god typing was to go in the rapture yeah it wasn't for elisha but it was for elijah amen as we can find out later in the scripture right amen and you would think now did moses go over the promised land god wouldn't allow him to but we don't even know what happened right the the devils the satan and the angels of god fighting over his body we we don't know you think well there was a man that was i mean wrote most the new testament of the old testament that he would have gone into rapture but you can't make you can't make natural human common sense out of the things that god does right amen yeah there's very little recorded about enoch and god just said he was not because god took him there's a lot more about elijah's life but then the chariot that took him up but then he didn't take elisha why not because there's there's a tight there there's a fulfillment of scripture that was to come along through the ages that was to help us understand wine yes but two raptures now yes two catching aways that have happened in the scriptures so far now we get to uh i won't say a little fuzzy area but uh we get to an area that uh people would question more the third rapture the third rapture in the scripture now the third and fourth rapture are are basically synonymous let's just go over and read excuse me uh over in acts chapter one you know i i just feel led let's go to matthew i was going to put acts first let's go to matthew chapter 28. something's telling me here we need let's let's go to matthew chapter 28 or 27 excuse me saint matthew chapter 27 because the third and fourth raptures which there are four like i said started there are four raptures that have happened scripturally already we know that no we're going to saw the first two already hold them out scripture but the next two are are synonymous uh they run and congruent to each other happen at the same time uh matthew chapter 27 let's read uh beginning with verse uh let's see where we'll start 45 let's start with verse 45 matthew 27 45 now from the sixth hour there was darkness all over the land until the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus christ the loud voice eli ilama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why is thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man called for elias straight way one of them ran took a sponge filled it with vinegar put it on a reed and gave him the drink the rest said let it let be let us see whether elias will come and save him jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice with a loud voice voice now we've read uh thessalonians chapter 4 how many times amen what's the voice the voice the voice is the second part it is the voice that rings out in the in resurrecting the dead which i want to lord willing to take those three things and break them down more as well uh but understand that that that voice is synonymous with the voice in first thessalonians 4 the voice of god that rings out that cries out jesus cried out with a loud voice yielding up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from top to bottom the earth did quake the rocks did rent you know brother brahms told brother uh green that's how those big rocks got up sabino yeah he said those big rocks big sizeable mobile homes that he got there at the time of the scripture when the uh earthquake and the rocks rent amen now you go up in their little tram and they'll tell you a whole different story this that and the other but i think i'm going to take what brother branham said amen amen anybody with me yeah rather i'll take what program said amen those were put in place when the earthquake rocks rent that's the scripture and the graves were open amen many of the bodies of the saints which slept arose amen the dead that had gone past on now i try to keep myself from saying in christ because they weren't in christ this is pre-jesus but those who died uh with their testimony of god yes they like like like an enoch or noah walked with god amen had that testimony that they pleased god those graves were opened all that had gone on that were in god all the predestined before now predestination didn't start just with the new testament you know that it didn't just start with this time right it just just didn't start with this day that we're living predestination has been the mind of god since god said let there be that that's the predestination started there that's all it means people don't want to believe it but predestination is just the mind of god it's just the predetermined of god that he already knew is him being god the beginning from the inning what there would be and not be pre-german predetermined predestined amen that doesn't throw us out because we're still free moral agents right amen but the predestination of there all those die from out of months amen then you go look at brother pat's chart he wrote up there from the first person to ever die and we'll say well well that that would be able then right amen that would be able not adam the first person able whose blood cried out to god from that time till the time of jesus being here let's say till the time of of this time when jesus himself died amen i hate saying the word died he didn't die do you know what i'm saying right but this time every one of them their graves opened up and they rose up out of the grave amen amen what did they do after they rose up out of the grave now this is the type that we have remember when the voice of jesus cried out and the voice of christ cries out in 1st thessalonians 4 and that voice cries out to do what to raise the dead when his voice cried out here to raise the dead it was simply a type of god showing us what he's going to do in this last day for us in this last time rapture amen which is actually only rapture five right we got six of them but our rapture here it doesn't end the raptures there's a rapture after hours yeah but what do they do those graves opened up and all those testament old testament saints rose they come up from the dead and then what did they do and they came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and did what appeared unto many yes amen people want to become popular today i see dead people but this rapture this excuse me resurrection for this last day is going to be for them to appear before many not just one person the people that raised in this last day aren't just going to go to one person right they're not just going to be there for one person to see they're going to appear unto many and that's exactly what the old testament saints did they walked around it and they appeared unto many now there's debate as to whether those people standing there at their time knew whether that was uh adam or not knew whether that was enoch or not knew whether that was abraham or not amen you can debate it all you want that's your choice right doesn't tell us brother brown never says that i know of amen but we can type into the understanding that when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and his little baby girl was a was a grown 19 20 year old girl he did not know her amen he she had to introduce herself to him and said i was your little sharon rose on earth amen right so we can understand by that precedent i know it's not scripture right but i i believe it happened and i believe that's exactly what's going to happen as brother branham tells it that he did not know her yeah amen but there was an introduction that took place right i often think what is it going to be when our son comes and appears before me and my wife he was just a little baby he got his picture on my phone just he's just a little innocent baby that he was a day and a half old what's he going to look like because he's not going to look hardly anything probably like he looked when he was a little baby clap clipped lip and palate and all that he's not gonna look like that he's gonna be strong and healthy and 19 20 year old perfect specimen of a male and he's going to come and look at us i i don't know i i i know i know sharon rose had to introduce yourself brother brandon but i just some reason get the feeling i'm gonna know him i just when when that young man walks up or comes into our uh uh church or living room or whatever i i i just think i'm gonna know him and if i don't it's okay because he'll tell me amen but you know the spirit of god is just going to be moving so at that time and and and the dead in christ will have just raised and and god moving on his gentile bride shaking her getting her ready like that little dew drop getting ready to go back to heaven again and that spirit moving in that anointing so strong i just feel like i'm gonna know him amen but it's okay again it's okay if i don't because i will know him anyway even if he has to say i was so and so and such and such amen but when the graves of the old testament saints opened they walked around people thousands of years never saw them didn't know them they read in the bible or in the torah about about their lives and who they were and can you imagine what it what it was like because that's the type and the precedent set for this last day rapture for the gentiles that as those that slept in christ through the through the from the first chase till today after the death of jesus from that time till now are going to raise up and i mean you know saint martin if he came through the door irenaeus or martin luther or any of those saints back in the 800s uh the thousand year through the dark ages no they're going to come up and they're going to resurrect i don't i don't i don't know how i would know those people right no but somehow god works it out to where they're going to visit us for a minimum brother brown said brother green a minimum 30 days if people want to fight over the 30 40 45 whatever it is don't argue about trivial stuff and i i know what the bible says i understand the scriptural precedent i know brother brown said at least brother greece's testimony to him is a minimum 30 days yeah so i i'm just going to leave it at that if you want it to be 40 that's fine i have no confidence i have no uh uh problem with that you wanted to be 45 i don't have any problem with that just as long as we're here and a part of it isn't that what matters that's what matters the most amen is that we're here and that we're a part of it and they're going to appear before us get to see angel jr i told you he's gonna be like that picture you married him he's gonna be like when you marry him you're gonna be like when you're married graceful amen who wouldn't look forward to that right i talked last week about the handwriting in the wall and how how it's such a struggle to see what's happening in the world in our country today but friend who would not want that exactly right amen right praise the lord amen i'm so thankful and see i don't know my dad and angel jr they didn't know each other on this earth but you know they might have found an acquaintance once they've gotten up there they might know each other now and that'd be all right praise the lord they're all coming together yes because it's all coming together thank god it's coming to that place it's becoming more and more real all the time yes it is amen the graves of me were opened many of the bodies of saints which slept arose and they came out of the graves after his resurrection after his resurrection now notice that right it it it says when he when he gave the loud voice is when it happened but the what it says here was after his resurrection after resurrection of christ is when they rose you understand that was synonymous because christ had to go to hell and take the keys and empty out paradise to bring him with him right that's the way he had to do that to to to bring them forth and so they came forth there after he emptied out paradise all the graves opened at his resurrection and they all came and appeared unto many now you read about jesus going around and spending time with his disciples and having fish on the brother john's amen uh having fish on the fire you know we had that sushi discussion yesterday is asking me what i didn't like for food and i said i don't like sushi and john's like well i like that bible says jesus put fish on the fire nothing knocking anybody that likes sushi it seems to his own that's all right it's just not my thing but anyway feet fish put fish on the fire and commune with them fellowship with them and had to convince thomas it was him here thomas put your hand in me you know uh because he had not been glorified but see that that recordation structurally helps us to probably get a a fair idea of what the others were doing maybe exactly what the others that that had raised with christ what were they doing they were doing probably the same thing i don't think that an abel rose and people not knowing him maybe that he'd have introduced her or say you know i don't what am i supposed to do now i don't know any of these people i don't think it was like that at all i believe it was it was to the point that he was able to introduce himself and to talk to those people and to fellowship with those people and and encourage those people and and just such a spirit of god moving there right see because we can't imagine it like it's imagined here we can't think of it like like what we feel and see and know for for this present time and on the anointing anointing friends it's all going to be so different right take the best anointing you've ever felt and the spirit of god in the service or something and just multiply it times a billion maybe i don't know it it's just going to be a i believe it was a time and will be a time of of such an anointing flowing around it that that it would just be a jubilee the only difference is that when jesus went they went with him that's the difference when and but today when they go be alive and remain go with them yes amen right the alive and remain did not go with them at this time right but if this day today the alive and remain will go with the dead in christ after they raised and appear unto many we will all rapture we will all go see jesus yes amen gentile anyway the jews still get dealt with by god after it goes down after the of course the the wedding sup for the lamb goes down and reveals himself to his people then amen and you get 144 000 sealed but those graves were opened many of the bodies and they appeared unto many amen amen that's a resurrection it's not a rapture um my time's caught up with me but i want to read two things real quick and then i'm going to close and i will probably have to come back to the rest of this first uh chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and all judea and the samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight a cloud received jesus out of their sight jesus was raptured right he was taken up caught away from them now ephesians chapter 4 verse 8 says wherefore let's start with verse 7. ephesians 4 7 but unto everyone that has given grace according to the ministry of the gifts of christ wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men he did what he led the captivity captive and he released them he emptied out paradise and he took them with him when he ascended now he that ascended what is it that but he descended first into the lower parts of the earth which we just said he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might feel all things but when he led the captivity that was captive and the graves opened and they came forth after his resurrection they walked around and talked and fellowshipped and went in the rapture with jesus jesus took him took them with him amen jesus took them with him now jesus my last thought here real quick jesus was that cornerstone rapture jesus being the cornerstone rapture was was the first one to die resurrect and then rapture jesus was enoch didn't die elijah didn't die right now these raptures are synonymous because jesus and he took the old testament saints with him but brother brown puts jesus rapture as the third one yes brother branham did yes you looked at it and said well they they came together went together but brother branham put jesus as the third and final old testament rapture yes right so that's what i'm gonna do put the jesus rapture as the third one and of course in the old testament saints which the first rapture he calls of the new testament was the old testament saints that rose with him that raptured with him but jesus being that cornerstone one was the one that changed it to understand this last day type of not just the alive and remained at rapture but a death resurrection and then a rapture yeah jesus represented both groups in his one rapture yes he represented the dead that were raised and the alive and remain that rapture yes amen the cornerstone of the rapture yes that jesus did yes when he changed everything let me read this i'll close after this in the rapture message abraham said the old testament saints has gone into his presence paradise done away and the old testament saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and give up the ghost because why this sacrifice the perpetuation of their sins they had waited on believing that the perfect lamb was coming they had offered the sacrifice the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice old testament saints a wolf watched the shout over here he says the same thing yielded up the ghost and when he did that sacrifice was perfect and paradise emptied out the old testament saints came to the earth again walked around on earth and entered in with him at his rapture amen that's the four that we know of that have taken place to this day the four raptures of the six in the scripture three old testament three new testaments that everything will be established the mouth of two or three witnesses three is perfection amen three in the old testament three in the new testament one new testament already gone amen what's left what's next amen that's what we've been trying to get to yeah right amen the time of the call or let's stand if we could amen i'm so thankful that god has made that provision made that way caused it to be in tight now if we were in a different age it would be okay right because we're going anyway that's true even though there's been different saints brothers and sisters has passed on by the way i forgot to mention please remember uh the behar and garcia family in prayer uh as you all know sister lucy behar of my ex-widow passed away a few weeks ago and they had her memorial service yesterday at phoenix tabernacle i would have gone but we had our own service here so uh but please remember the garcia but beijar family sister lucy they had her memorial yesterday too amen so but and she she didn't dive colder but again all of the different ones that have passed and gone on to be with the lord well we talked about that this i think a very spiritual significance that's happening it's going on with a lot of those things it doesn't matter they just sleep for a little bit then when the voice cries out they grapes will open again amen they'll come and pick up their bodies and they'll appear before many that's right amen and we'll see them we'll get to spend time with them again won't be but a short time but old can you imagine yeah oh if you just if you saw brother pat you see your mother come walking into your house or or or brother green shows up at church or your loved one whoever it is brother angel whoever it is comes and shows up oh my what do you think you're gonna feel wow amen i know i that's probably good explicit brother john but i don't think that does it does what would do it justice though i think we'll probably just start speaking in tongues because i have enough english language to do it amen praise the lord jesus oh my i'm looking forward to it saints i believe it's in process we're here it's working on us now from glory to glory he's changing us amen praise the lord jesus amen let's sing this it's a psalm but we'll just sing the chorus part of it we'll close here amen and give a little give us some time to get to the get a bite to eat be back number 604 let's just sing the chorus a couple times soon amen see you in the rapture amen see you in the rapture 604. [Music] oh yes i'll see you in the rapture [Music] amen one more time now oh [Music] in [Applause] [Music] i'll [Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord jesus amen i'm so thankful that that promise belongs to us right if god made a way for the shedding of his blood redeem us back and place us in the position that we could walk with god that we can have a testimony pleasing to god and that soon and probably very soon we're going to go in a rapture to see him amen you love him yes praise the lord god bless you you can make it back we welcome you hope you can't three o'clock we'll reconvene here and uh and uh trust that uh trust you're able to make it so we love you appreciate you amen remember the prayer requests we had and um each one is very serious situations and needs there amen so we're just believing that god's hand upon them amen god bless you love you amen may the lord jesus go with you amen appreciate god bless each one of you brother dennis would you dismiss us forever lord jesus it's been a privilege and it's been a blessing to be in your presence this day to know that the bride is the only one that has a revelation of that rapture oh jesus and father as our brothers have said already in ourselves we are failures we'll fall short we cannot do anything of our own accord amen father i heard your prophets say earlier this week we have to be able to empty ourselves yes ourselves and let your holy spirit have the preeminence lord give us that understanding greater and deeper and more real than ever before it's christ in us our hope of glory and lord i feel glad like david said one time to be in your house to be in your presence to know that we didn't come to be seen or to seal one another but we came to meet with you and we know that you were here you blessed us your word has given us victory it's given us healing it's giving us deliverance it's giving us honor it's given us a promise thank you lord blame each and every one as we go our separate way lord may you grant all of us traveling mercies and put it in our hearts to come back lord knowing his brother taught that the communist communion service was the showdown it was i uh it's an honor to the true believer to partake in the lord's suffering fill us with your love in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen god richly bless you today [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] so [Music]
