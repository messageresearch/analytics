[23:15] himself all the good works he had done

[30:25] that's lives matter in this room uh so
[30:28] Micah had mentioned and I had thought
[30:31] it'd been on my heart to maybe ask in
[30:34] whatever few minutes we have here now if
[30:37] anyone has something they'd like to say
[30:39] about sister green I don't know you know
[30:41] I sent the I sent the thing out uh the
[30:44] obituary that the funeral is Tuesday at
[30:48] noon I plan to go I don't know if
[30:50] anybody else does but my intention
[30:53] absolutely is to be there
[30:56] unless you just really I
[30:59] I'm not telling you what to do but it's
[31:02] supposed to be at Eastlawn unless you
[31:05] just really feel impressed to go I
[31:07] probably wouldn't maybe stream it uh
[31:10] Eastland does not have a very large
[31:12] facility and there's probably going to
[31:15] be a lot of people there now I could be
[31:18] wrong about that maybe people are still
[31:19] scared of covet or something I don't
[31:21] know but that's what I'm thinking but
[31:24] I'm going to go so I planted my wife is
[31:27] not but I do plan to go so and be there
[31:30] it's at noon on Tuesday so if you would
[31:34] like to go and be a part of that at
[31:36] Salon of course by the grain about all
[31:39] the barrel plots and of course he bought
[31:41] the mausoleum spots there for his family
[31:44] so I'm assuming sister green will be in
[31:47] the mausoleum there that's adjacent to
[31:49] the plots that brother green had
[31:51] purchased there kind of the Tucson
[31:53] Tabernacle section so I'm assuming
[31:56] she'll be in there but that I imagine
[31:59] that'll probably be private like it was
[32:01] with brother green but if you'd like to
[32:03] go Tuesday at noon at Eastland uh to pay
[32:06] your respects if you'd like to do that
[32:08] but
[32:10] you have a forum here so if you'd like
[32:13] to if you have something you'd like to
[32:14] say about Sister Green
[32:17] feel free
[32:25] she always had a smile for everybody
[32:28] she always paid attention listened yes
[32:31] she is interested in anything you said
[32:33] amen
[32:35] amen you could play the piano but never
[32:37] have enough
[32:39] music lesson yeah
[32:42] like our piano player yeah yeah amen
[32:47] see she was a sweet person she was and
[32:52] she was always a
[32:54] on some kind of diet
[32:57] but it didn't seem to
[33:00] she was always trying to
[33:03] pushing on to her husband but he just
[33:06] was too busy to do that yeah
[33:10] okay through God bless sister
[33:14] anybody else
[33:16] [Music]
[33:21] sister green was a lady of Lindy's yes
[33:24] wonderful woman amen
[33:27] um I wrote her a little note and I asked
[33:30] her could she give me the words to a
[33:33] certain song songs
[33:36] and instead of giving it to me she's
[33:39] saying every one of the songs you know
[33:42] so maybe another Sunday or whatever
[33:44] and and then brother Queen over the
[33:47] pulpit gave me some advice not and
[33:50] nobody knowing it though
[33:52] just I miss him and they're wonderful
[33:54] people amen and I know we will see her
[33:57] again me too there amen
[34:01] amen
[34:05] sister green was really an inspiration
[34:08] to all of us that knew her I knew her
[34:12] since 1974 when I became a part of
[34:15] Tucson Tabernacle she was always a
[34:18] delight had a smile like a brother said
[34:21] and she had a beautiful voice a lot of
[34:25] y'all weren't there brother Greene told
[34:28] her to rest her voice when she was 50
[34:30] years old and he was afraid she was
[34:34] going to lose it her voice she never
[34:36] lost it she was a blessing could sing
[34:39] like an angel at any time that she was
[34:42] called upon and I'm going to give
[34:45] testimony in this respect in 2009 I had
[34:50] my knee replaced and she heard about it
[34:53] and she was giving me vitamins and like
[34:56] a brother said she knew a lot about
[34:58] eating right and giving me special stuff
[35:01] and out of her own kindness of her heart
[35:03] she was you know helping me to get ready
[35:06] for my surgery and that was a hard
[35:08] surgery and yes I'm we all gonna miss
[35:12] her we missed brother green and um it's
[35:15] going to be a reunion like we can
[35:17] imagine when we see all our loved ones
[35:21] in the other side yeah God bless you
[35:23] praise the Lord amen that's getting
[35:24] closer so true so much closer anybody
[35:28] else
[35:34] amen
[35:35] she could absolutely sing
[35:38] she had one of the most beautiful voices
[35:43] two of my favorite singers probably
[35:45] she's probably my number one but
[35:47] I enjoy sister Sally do too she has a
[35:49] pretty voice but sister green just had
[35:51] that elegant her voice felt her
[35:54] personality her
[35:55] her voice was that elegant uh voice that
[36:01] was indicative of her personality and
[36:04] who she was but I wrote a little
[36:07] something I put a little something
[36:09] in the uh
[36:12] the website of Eastlawn I put a little
[36:15] thought that had come to me right there
[36:18] to write for her but uh
[36:21] I I probably am sure I will get a
[36:23] platform or a forum to say my feelings
[36:26] about sister green so I'm going to use
[36:28] this platform in this forum and it will
[36:31] be streamed to my thoughts about Sister
[36:34] Green
[36:36] is it on
[36:39] sorry I thought I had it on
[36:43] this is this would be if if I was able
[36:47] to speak this would be uh at least
[36:49] there's so much you can say but uh on
[36:52] November 17 1934 the world was blessed
[36:56] with a jewel
[36:57] Sister Janice green not only sang like
[36:59] an angel but she lived the life of a
[37:01] child of God the consummate pastor's
[37:05] wife that fulfilled her calling with
[37:07] humility dignity and Grace
[37:09] for nearly 50 years she stood by her
[37:12] husband's brother Perry greenside and
[37:14] together their International Ministry
[37:16] touched the lives of millions you would
[37:19] be challenged to find someone who spake
[37:22] ill of her and you would be even more
[37:25] challenged to find someone that she
[37:28] spoke ill about
[37:30] she loved the Lord Jesus in this message
[37:32] with all her heart she fought the good
[37:35] fight she kept the faith and now she is
[37:37] gained her reward may the Lord Jesus
[37:41] rest her Gallant salt till we meet again
[37:43] in peace
[37:44] amen that's the little thought that I
[37:47] had about sister green and she will be
[37:50] sorely sorely missed
[37:53] precious sister yes I'm assuming that
[37:57] they will that she will sing at her
[38:00] funeral because the last few funerals
[38:02] that she sang at everybody kept
[38:04] requesting and the last one I was at
[38:06] that I heard Sister Green sing with
[38:08] sister Sammy that was the last time she
[38:11] said the same thing she said everybody
[38:12] always asked me to sing for their
[38:14] funeral she said who's going to sing for
[38:16] my funeral and where and all of us are
[38:18] like you are
[38:20] so I hope they allow sister green
[38:24] through tape CD whatever to sing her own
[38:28] funeral yeah I I personally think that
[38:30] would be tremendously appropriate and I
[38:34] would guarantee you pretty much not that
[38:36] we scale this that in that way she would
[38:39] probably be absolutely by far the best
[38:43] person that could do it so
[38:46] um I I
[38:48] I'll miss her I love sister green very
[38:51] much
[38:52] she was so precious
[38:54] and she was so faithful
[38:57] and she was I mean we're all human
[39:01] but you know in times where you pin
[39:04] roses uh it's that time so
[39:09] the world has become worse but Heaven
[39:12] has gotten better amen from Sister
[39:14] Green's past
[39:17] I have one more song I want to sing
[39:19] we'll go ahead and sing it um
[39:21] uh song number 354.

[48:52] verse 21.
[48:54] amen unto the unto Adam also unto his
[48:57] wife did the Lord God make coats of
[48:59] skins and and clothe them you could be
[49:01] seated if you'd like uh we're going to
[49:03] start back and continue on with the
[49:05] thought that we've left the last couple
[49:06] of weeks
[49:09] speaking on the holy spirit amen of
[49:11] course as I've told you uh many times I
[49:15] I major on the Holy Spirit my Ministry
[49:18] my desire for that and recognizing the
[49:20] importance of it and how vital it is
[49:22] into in in all of our lives and not just
[49:25] the token that takes us home but the
[49:28] Holy Spirit that's in us to lead us and
[49:29] guide us in all his truth to lead us in
[49:32] guide us into all righteousness it's the
[49:33] only thing that can do that is the Holy
[49:35] Spirit the only thing that can live the
[49:37] life through us is the holy spirit amen
[49:40] so uh it's that it that utmost vital
[49:44] importance Amen to understand and and
[49:47] and bringing into recognition of a lot
[49:51] that people Miss skew from the holy
[49:55] spirit thank God for a prophet thank the
[49:58] Lord that brother Branham came and
[49:59] brought a truth to us to understand a
[50:02] lot of stuff that you hear today is so
[50:04] far removed from what we know the
[50:06] scriptural truth of it is that uh that
[50:09] they move away from it in fact a lot of
[50:11] the Christian a lot of the world today
[50:13] just have the Holy Spirit as the third
[50:15] person in the godhead and thank God we
[50:18] know better than that that's probably
[50:20] the most Foundation of our faith and
[50:22] belief is understanding that there's one
[50:24] God yes there's one Lord there's one
[50:27] Faith there's one baptism amen praise
[50:30] the Lord his brother green used to say
[50:31] you can't feed three Gods to a Jew amen
[50:35] but to a Believer you can't do it either
[50:38] amen they know that there's one God he
[50:40] is the living Risen Savior amen that
[50:42] Holy Spirit that came out from God back
[50:44] on the believer now let's go to Saint
[50:46] Matthew chapter 27.
[50:49] we'll read a verse of scripture here
[50:52] continue where we left off last week we
[50:55] left off with the Paschal Lamb uh we'll
[50:58] go back to that for just a brief moment
[51:00] because I've mentioned to you there was
[51:01] something in there that I wanted to get
[51:03] to but just didn't have the time to
[51:05] finish it up last week uh that we want
[51:07] to get into today that is coming from
[51:10] that position but notice remember last
[51:12] week we spoke and read the scripture
[51:15] several places uh that the Paschal Lamb
[51:18] was supposed to be an innocent lamb it
[51:21] was supposed to be held up for four days
[51:23] to test its Purity uh to check to test
[51:27] for no floss there were to be no flaws
[51:29] no blemishes it had to be scripturally
[51:32] precedented to be able to fulfill the
[51:36] purpose that God had called for amen if
[51:39] there was a lamb that did not meet those
[51:41] qualifications then it was not suited to
[51:44] to meet the the uh the the sacrifice
[51:47] that God had called for and if Jesus
[51:50] Christ had not met that qualification it
[51:53] would not have been uh good either so we
[51:56] we understand that that land that was to
[51:59] be held up for four days to make sure it
[52:02] was out without blemish without fault
[52:04] without mistake Jesus Christ of course
[52:07] was tested and his life tempted above
[52:10] all temptation and through his ministry
[52:12] three and a half years going on the
[52:14] fourth year that his life was tested and
[52:17] his life was brought before the public
[52:19] and he was looked at and found Flawless
[52:22] and how many scriptures does it talk
[52:25] about not just his disciples but
[52:28] remember we read about judas's carrier
[52:30] and talking about innocent blood we read
[52:33] about pilate's wife uh Heathen
[52:37] unbeliever and his innocent life and his
[52:40] Purity we read about Pilate and his uh
[52:44] proclamation to all of Israel that this
[52:48] man was innocent and he would add
[52:51] innocent blood and of course then we
[52:53] read the scripture where the Centurion
[52:55] Soldier looked up at him and all the
[52:56] things going on around him at his
[52:58] crucifixion and said surely this was the
[53:01] son of God Amen passing that test
[53:05] making that uh a scriptural precedent to
[53:10] understand that Jesus Christ fulfilled
[53:12] every
[53:14] scriptural precedent to meet the the
[53:18] requirement to be our sacrifice amen
[53:21] amen
[53:22] again we'll read back uh Matthew chapter
[53:25] 27 we'll just read the one from pilate
[53:28] here the 24th verse when pilate saw that
[53:31] he could Prevail nothing
[53:33] but that rather a torment was made an
[53:36] uproar you see the same thing happened
[53:38] today I mean it doesn't have to be a
[53:40] majority of people it just has to be a
[53:43] little group of people that's loud
[53:44] enough
[53:45] that they shout down everybody else
[53:48] that happens today well this was
[53:51] happening here pilate gave up they got
[53:53] in such an uproar amen they were in such
[53:56] a you can imagine how many people just
[53:59] Jesus life touched how many people were
[54:03] blessed and helped and ministered to and
[54:05] healed because of Jesus ministry you
[54:08] imagine if the commoner would come up
[54:10] there and try to give their voice over
[54:12] to the few that were in charge and tell
[54:15] them this man is innocent and give
[54:17] testimony of all the things he had done
[54:19] well they do just like Pilots trying to
[54:22] set Jesus free and they're shouting him
[54:24] down
[54:25] they're saying this man is innocent he
[54:28] is Guiltless he should be the one that I
[54:30] let set free and they're like No And
[54:33] they shall count it down
[54:35] to the point that pilate just gave up
[54:38] pilate said I give up
[54:40] when pilate saw that he could Prevail
[54:42] nothing he gave up but the rather of the
[54:46] torment uproar was made he took water
[54:48] washed his hands before the multitude
[54:50] saying I am innocent of the blood of
[54:52] this just person
[54:54] CE to it but he is not innocent because
[54:57] he's the one that had the power
[54:59] he's the one that had the authority he's
[55:02] the one that could have said yes or no
[55:04] regardless of what the Uproar was right
[55:06] pilot was the one in charge he could
[55:09] wash his hands to the couch come home
[55:10] and he'll never get that blood off of
[55:13] his hand because he was the one that had
[55:15] the authority and the power to set Jesus
[55:18] free or to crucify
[55:19] it was all in his hands regardless of
[55:22] what everybody else said amen it was on
[55:25] him
[55:26] it was his decision he could have done
[55:28] it one way or the other but thank God
[55:32] there was a reason why our savior had to
[55:35] go to Calvary there was a reason why
[55:38] they had to make a torment there was a
[55:40] reason why those Jews had to have their
[55:42] eyes blinded they had to have their
[55:45] theirselves blinded to who Jesus was so
[55:48] that they would have him crucified
[55:50] because it was only then that that blood
[55:53] could be shed that we could have
[55:55] Redemption and the shedding of that
[55:57] blood not only moved into the into the
[56:00] Gentile having their day of redemption
[56:03] we know those from from now the past
[56:06] 2000 years ish that we've had our time
[56:09] but that it will go back to the Jews
[56:11] eventually
[56:12] so we look at it and I uh we think what
[56:16] a horrible thing it is but if it hadn't
[56:18] been for that where would any of us be
[56:21] none of us would have a chance if that
[56:23] innocent lamb a lot of people come and
[56:26] say well that's just cruel to offer
[56:27] these Lambs to offer these goats and
[56:29] Bulls whatever they offer that's just
[56:32] cruel to kill these animals but what
[56:33] about the man Jesus Christ innocence of
[56:37] any charge of any crime that was ever
[56:39] laid to his door he was innocent of it
[56:42] and they killed
[56:43] [Music]
[56:45] had not been for that precious blood
[56:47] that come out of his his veins if it had
[56:50] not been for the blood cell of Jesus
[56:52] Christ almighty God being broke then
[56:56] that then that day of that Holy Spirit
[56:58] would have never been able to come back
[57:00] on the worshiper again
[57:02] yes amen praise the Lord remember the
[57:05] blood the blood cell of the animal with
[57:07] no soul was only able to cover the
[57:09] people at the time but the blood cell of
[57:12] God that was broke was able to bring
[57:15] back a life into
[57:17] the life from the blood that came back
[57:20] into the believer that change that made
[57:22] them new creatures amen praise the Lord
[57:25] let's go to let's go to Acts
[57:29] amen chapter 2.
[57:32] we'll get to this last
[57:34] this last part I wanted to say from
[57:36] Exodus and before we close today
[57:41] but let's go to Acts chapter two let's
[57:44] read about that blood cell that was
[57:46] broken that light that left that blood
[57:49] because remember the chemistry of the
[57:51] blood of Jesus dropped onto the Earth
[57:53] and redeemed the Earth back
[57:55] amen amen that was lost in the Garden of
[57:57] Eden lost in the hands of who Satan that
[58:00] chemistry of that blood dropped upon the
[58:02] Earth to redeem this Earth back but the
[58:04] life that was in that blood went back
[58:06] before almighty God and then came back
[58:09] in the form of the holy spirit amen just
[58:11] like Jesus said it would yes
[58:14] Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day
[58:16] of Pentecost was fully come now
[58:19] I the Lord's inspired me on that
[58:24] to understand and some of what was
[58:26] actually said today
[58:28] has been an influence to that because
[58:31] when you when you use the phrase fully
[58:34] come that means that something has been
[58:37] in progress
[58:38] it just hasn't reached its full it's
[58:41] foolish yet
[58:43] amen
[58:45] but when this was fully come so that
[58:48] means that something had already been in
[58:51] progress
[58:52] amen whether they knew it or not
[58:55] The Works had already been moving God
[58:57] had already been working God had already
[59:00] been moving and doing these things and
[59:02] moving this along but it took this one
[59:05] place and this one time with this 120
[59:07] people that that was fully come
[59:11] it reached its consummation it reached
[59:14] his end it fully came and they were all
[59:18] with one Accord in one place and
[59:19] suddenly
[59:21] there came a sound from Heaven as a
[59:23] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[59:26] the house where they were sitting
[59:28] Saints I want to tell you every week I
[59:30] pray for us in this place in our service
[59:32] that's one of my go-to scriptures Lord
[59:36] fill all this house where
[59:40] amen it filled all the house where they
[59:43] were
[59:44] they were and they appeared unto them
[59:46] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[59:50] upon each of them amen so this Pillar of
[59:53] Fire came down and it lit upon each one
[59:57] of them as it clothed itself as it
[1:00:00] separated itself it separated itself in
[1:00:03] a way that each one got a lick a fire
[1:00:06] amen each one got a liquor fire as it
[1:00:10] close it as it claved itself and and
[1:00:13] broke itself apart onto everyone
[1:00:15] remember at one time it was just on one
[1:00:19] person Jesus Christ amen but when Jesus
[1:00:23] died I told you the story about the
[1:00:26] spiders in Florida remember uh were like
[1:00:30] Satan thought he had he was going to
[1:00:32] kill Jesus and it's gonna all be over I
[1:00:35] told you the story of the woman killed
[1:00:36] that big spider in Florida she didn't
[1:00:39] see the egg sacked underneath him when
[1:00:40] she smacked it in 200 eggs when all the
[1:00:43] spiders went all over the place she had
[1:00:45] a mess amen when when Jesus died when he
[1:00:49] moved upon them to crucify Jesus Christ
[1:00:52] all he did was cause that blood cell to
[1:00:55] be broke and come and then break himself
[1:00:57] on millions of people then
[1:01:00] amen now I not only had one man Jesus
[1:01:03] Christ he has millions around the world
[1:01:05] that he's got to deal with yes he's
[1:01:07] probably Satan's probably thinking at
[1:01:09] this point my I should have tried to
[1:01:11] deceive more Angels than a third I had
[1:01:13] thirds not even enough anymore but we'll
[1:01:16] read a little bit when you get down to
[1:01:18] the True Believer amen what the Bible
[1:01:21] says about this day amen what we deal
[1:01:24] with in fighting those enemies
[1:01:26] but that that that that pillar fire amen
[1:01:29] that low cost came down upon that
[1:01:32] Congregation of people and it broke out
[1:01:35] upon them now notice this is in
[1:01:38] semblance of the day of the Paschal Lamb
[1:01:42] when it was 120 people in that one room
[1:01:45] they were in one place one Accord 120 of
[1:01:49] them
[1:01:50] that's hard to believe the 120 people
[1:01:52] can come in one Accord but it does
[1:01:54] happen it can't happen yes amen and it
[1:01:57] can happen again today yes where
[1:02:00] thousands or Millions however many is
[1:02:02] going in a Rapture that that they will
[1:02:04] all come together in one place at one
[1:02:07] time and that place is the shed blood of
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ it's not Tucson unlike a
[1:02:12] lot of people used to think when brother
[1:02:13] Branham was preaching or Jeffersonville
[1:02:16] or whatever it's around the world the
[1:02:19] bride is around the world but she is in
[1:02:21] one place because that one place is
[1:02:24] Jesus
[1:02:25] amen she's in Christ
[1:02:27] that is her one place what is her one a
[1:02:30] quarter or one Accord is the word
[1:02:33] or one according she agrees on the word
[1:02:35] of God the message of the hour that's
[1:02:38] her Accord so she's in one place in one
[1:02:40] according Fred listen friends Saints God
[1:02:44] is going to call this bride home just
[1:02:46] like he did there
[1:02:48] amen one place one Accord at this time
[1:02:52] it was just a breaking forth of uh uh
[1:02:55] the holy spirit that that fire that low
[1:02:57] gloss that came down in and then broke
[1:02:59] out on each one but that's not our day
[1:03:01] today our day is brother Madam said it's
[1:03:04] not a day of looking for Great Waves of
[1:03:07] revivals our day is the day that you are
[1:03:10] the Revival and it's time to go home yes
[1:03:13] that's our day praise God that's the day
[1:03:17] that we're living now this cloven tongue
[1:03:19] or this a fire that came down like like
[1:03:22] a tongue that clove amongst each one
[1:03:24] that broke itself apart amen and lit
[1:03:27] upon each one of them let's look at this
[1:03:28] because this will probably bring us into
[1:03:31] our next uh subject next week
[1:03:34] came a rushing Mighty Wind filled all
[1:03:37] the house where they were sitting there
[1:03:38] appeared unto them
[1:03:40] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[1:03:43] upon each of them now that's an
[1:03:46] anointing
[1:03:47] an anointing of the holy spirit is when
[1:03:50] it comes and falls on you you feel it on
[1:03:54] your flesh even in your spirit maybe
[1:03:56] there's a A tingle in your spine or the
[1:03:59] hair on your neck stands up or or a tear
[1:04:02] comes out of your eye or there's there's
[1:04:04] a shaking or something or or or whatever
[1:04:07] it might be I've seen people roll on the
[1:04:09] floor I've seen people scream I've seen
[1:04:11] people singing tongues speaking tongues
[1:04:14] I've seen people raise their hands and
[1:04:16] dance in the spirit I've seen women have
[1:04:18] Caravans around a church to where bobby
[1:04:20] pins laid all over the floor when they
[1:04:22] got done
[1:04:23] I've seen all kinds of them but it's the
[1:04:25] spirit that moves on them to brings them
[1:04:28] to that place it's that spirit that
[1:04:31] moves it that that that causes them to
[1:04:34] to act in that way amen it's an
[1:04:37] anointing
[1:04:38] amen that's the anointing it's on them I
[1:04:42] feel that anointing on me and I thank
[1:04:44] God that anointing is still fresh today
[1:04:47] it still falls on us when you talk about
[1:04:50] now I want to clarify this and we'll
[1:04:53] maybe get into it more next week but I
[1:04:55] want to clarify this when people talk
[1:04:57] about and when brother Anna mentioned a
[1:05:00] a refilling
[1:05:02] now I know the word filling means to
[1:05:04] fill but look at the difference between
[1:05:06] the rich virgin and the foolish virgin
[1:05:10] you say feeling what does a feeling mean
[1:05:12] well there's a difference between being
[1:05:14] anointed of the Holy Spirit and having
[1:05:16] it on your flesh or even in your spirit
[1:05:18] and being born again with the person of
[1:05:22] Jesus Christ Living in your soul
[1:05:25] there's a difference
[1:05:27] at the day of Pentecost
[1:05:30] the Spirit came and set upon each of
[1:05:33] them as an anointing
[1:05:36] and is a conjunction for first
[1:05:40] and as a conjunction which joins the two
[1:05:43] parts together
[1:05:45] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:05:49] Ghost they were all filled so it wasn't
[1:05:52] just something that came on them it was
[1:05:54] something that went in them and that is
[1:05:57] what separates the True Believer from
[1:06:00] the rest of the world that's what's
[1:06:02] separate the the born-again experiences
[1:06:05] what separates a true Christian from the
[1:06:09] lake believes or the unbelies
[1:06:12] that's what separates the presence of
[1:06:14] God so when you ask God for a refilling
[1:06:17] you're not asking God to put his life in
[1:06:20] you anymore because that's done that's
[1:06:22] finished right the the Ephesians said
[1:06:25] you are sealed until your day of the
[1:06:29] Eternal destination
[1:06:30] when the Holy Spirit comes and you are
[1:06:32] born again you are sealed the god
[1:06:36] brother Adam said God seals the holy
[1:06:38] spirit in you and seals the devil out
[1:06:41] amen nothing gets in and nothing gets
[1:06:45] out until you get to your destination
[1:06:47] yes and for him we are not there yet
[1:06:49] right yes God did not seal you to rip
[1:06:52] the seal off and say I'm taking my Holy
[1:06:54] Spirit back no when you have reached his
[1:06:57] approval then you are sealed and it's
[1:07:00] done in Spanish so when you ask for a
[1:07:03] refilling you're not talking about your
[1:07:04] soul right you're saying God pour on me
[1:07:07] that Holy Spirit again that anointing
[1:07:10] fresh
[1:07:12] that's what a baptism is a lot of people
[1:07:15] use the phrase baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:18] well a baptism is simply an immersing
[1:07:21] amen we'll get to it another time uh as
[1:07:25] we go through this but a baptism is
[1:07:26] simply an immersing
[1:07:28] it's not a baptism is not a born-again
[1:07:32] experience right baptism is just an
[1:07:35] immersion if you get baptized literally
[1:07:38] in water that water goes over you it
[1:07:41] doesn't go in you
[1:07:44] amen it doesn't go in you it just it
[1:07:47] just immerses you in it well that's what
[1:07:50] the on part of this holy spirit is it's
[1:07:53] a baptism it's an immersing in them to
[1:07:56] work to where when they got this spirit
[1:07:59] they begin to speak with other tongues
[1:08:02] as the spirit gave them utterance
[1:08:04] they begin to act in crazy ways and
[1:08:07] knocking out the walls to where people
[1:08:09] looked at them and thought they were
[1:08:10] drunk
[1:08:11] they weren't just speaking in tongues
[1:08:13] they were acting like they were drunk to
[1:08:16] where everybody thought outside thought
[1:08:19] they were drunk
[1:08:21] so what are these what is going on with
[1:08:23] these people and of course is the
[1:08:24] spokesman Peter that comes out and says
[1:08:26] they are not drunk like you think
[1:08:28] they're drunk on the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:31] this is just the third hour of the day
[1:08:33] but this is that that Joel said then in
[1:08:36] the last day he would pour out his
[1:08:38] Spirit on
[1:08:40] All Flesh
[1:08:43] not in All Flesh
[1:08:45] but on All Flesh so as the anointing
[1:08:48] covers All Flesh that doesn't mean
[1:08:51] everybody is born of that Spirit they
[1:08:54] just have that anointing so they're able
[1:08:57] to operate the exact same way I'm
[1:08:59] starting to get into the next service so
[1:09:00] I got to quit that uh they're able to
[1:09:03] operate that way just because of an
[1:09:04] anointing
[1:09:06] the anointing falls on them and that's
[1:09:09] but that's the difference you have the
[1:09:11] anointing just like it was in the day of
[1:09:13] Pentecost an anointing that fell and
[1:09:15] came on them
[1:09:16] and then you had that same anointing
[1:09:18] that same spirit it's not a different
[1:09:21] spirit it's not a different Holy Ghost
[1:09:22] it's the same Holy Ghost different uh uh
[1:09:26] uh applications
[1:09:29] one
[1:09:30] it can come on and go in they were all
[1:09:35] it came on them and they were all filled
[1:09:39] with the holy spirit so you got the on
[1:09:42] and in not just the on
[1:09:44] unfortunately a lot of people probably
[1:09:47] most people just have the on
[1:09:50] they don't have the end right yes that's
[1:09:53] why
[1:09:54] you had the situation that you had with
[1:09:56] and and people talk about I believe it
[1:09:59] was Luther that could still smoke and
[1:10:03] and drink and whatever how he lived his
[1:10:06] life he he wasn't the minister of
[1:10:09] sanctification right he was only the
[1:10:11] minister the restoration prophet of uh
[1:10:15] of justification that just shall live by
[1:10:19] faith that was his ministry he
[1:10:21] ministered and he nailed it down and he
[1:10:24] he knelt it to the thesis to the to the
[1:10:27] to the door in Wittenberg Germany
[1:10:31] amen for the whole world to see this was
[1:10:34] his stand
[1:10:35] amen like brother bam said
[1:10:38] how
[1:10:39] it was a miracle how he could protest
[1:10:42] the Catholic Church brother and said
[1:10:44] that that's one thing he said but how
[1:10:47] the man could keep his head above all
[1:10:49] the fanaticism that followed his message
[1:10:51] that was the that was the thing and
[1:10:54] that's and I believe brother Brown
[1:10:56] obviously was speaking of himself
[1:10:58] not that he could come against the the
[1:11:00] normal intelligency of the of the of
[1:11:03] Christianity or Christian Dome itself
[1:11:05] but that he could rise his head above
[1:11:07] all the fanaticism of the followed his
[1:11:09] message calling him God baptizing in his
[1:11:12] name the imitations and things of FBI
[1:11:16] coming to his services and trying to uh
[1:11:18] uh show him as a fraud and people coming
[1:11:21] up on the platform and saying they had
[1:11:23] stuff they didn't have and you know all
[1:11:25] the fanaticism and things that went
[1:11:27] around him people acting like they were
[1:11:29] prophets and and praying for people and
[1:11:32] staggering around like brother Branham
[1:11:33] did and all these things oh friend look
[1:11:36] it's just it's just an imitation of the
[1:11:40] real
[1:11:41] yeah but brother Ram was talking about
[1:11:43] keeping above all that fanaticism right
[1:11:47] oh what would it be today
[1:11:49] I mean we have to know who we are to
[1:11:52] make sure we stay above all that
[1:11:53] fanaticism amen and people claim to be
[1:11:57] say they are and so forth and so on so
[1:11:59] forth but we know that by the indwelling
[1:12:03] presence of the Holy Spirit God
[1:12:04] revealing himself to you because
[1:12:06] remember we've said this before brother
[1:12:08] Adam said if you have the Holy Ghost not
[1:12:11] an anointing but you are born again you
[1:12:15] have a level of discernment
[1:12:17] amen it may not be your your uh a
[1:12:21] prolific gift but you have a level of
[1:12:25] discernment to know what is right and
[1:12:27] wrong and what is God and what is not
[1:12:30] and what is what is even 99.9 God but
[1:12:35] one tenth of a percent the devil
[1:12:38] but one tenth of a percent leavens the
[1:12:41] whole loan
[1:12:42] praise the Lord
[1:12:44] but we had the discernment to know
[1:12:46] Amen in whom we believe whom we follow
[1:12:50] what we stand for what it means to us
[1:12:53] that's the importance of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:55] living in you not just an anointing an
[1:12:57] anointing will take you to your flesh
[1:12:59] brother Ram said don't don't jump any
[1:13:01] higher than you can live
[1:13:03] amen you can jump and dance and scream
[1:13:06] and shout to the anointing but when the
[1:13:08] when the rubber meets the road when your
[1:13:10] feet Hit the Floor are you a born-again
[1:13:12] Christian who lives a Godly life out in
[1:13:15] everything else that's going on around
[1:13:16] here or do you just fall right in with
[1:13:19] all the rest of everybody and everything
[1:13:21] else going on amen notice
[1:13:23] Luther he could do that because it was
[1:13:27] it was that time yet let me read a
[1:13:30] scripture
[1:13:31] and we'll get back to this because
[1:13:33] that's that's kind of where I want this
[1:13:36] next part of this message to go so let's
[1:13:39] read this before I get past it Saint
[1:13:42] John chapter 14.
[1:13:45] uh verse 17 just to solidify what we had
[1:13:49] just talked about Jesus himself now
[1:13:52] uh Saint John 14 17.
[1:13:56] let's just start with 16.
[1:13:59] and I will pray the father and he shall
[1:14:01] give you another comforter that he may
[1:14:04] abide with you forever okay abide with
[1:14:08] you now look Jesus was with them was he
[1:14:12] not he wasn't on them but he was with
[1:14:15] them now you notice now you've got Jesus
[1:14:19] Christ in human flesh was with them
[1:14:22] then when he was crucified his life came
[1:14:25] back and was on them and in them that
[1:14:29] covers every Jesus covered every aspect
[1:14:33] of human life amen with on end
[1:14:38] Jesus Christ
[1:14:39] he will abide with you forever even the
[1:14:43] spirit of Truth which is the word
[1:14:46] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:14:49] seeth him not neither knoweth him
[1:14:52] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[1:14:56] and conjunction
[1:14:59] shall be in you
[1:15:02] praise God the and conjunction once
[1:15:06] again is joining these two parts
[1:15:08] together of on and in
[1:15:11] Jesus telling them this is what's going
[1:15:14] to happen
[1:15:15] then when that then when that day fully
[1:15:18] came
[1:15:19] it was already in operation
[1:15:22] praise God it was already working God
[1:15:25] was already doing it of course he had
[1:15:28] been doing it since he since Genesis 3
[1:15:30] 21 when he took the sheepskins and
[1:15:32] sleuths in his mind he was already
[1:15:34] working the work but when it fully came
[1:15:37] on that day of Pentecost that's when the
[1:15:40] Fulfillment of Jesus words here became
[1:15:43] fulfilled amen they came they came to
[1:15:47] pass
[1:15:48] they came to to
[1:15:50] fruitions the words of Jesus Christ now
[1:15:53] let's go back before we get back to
[1:15:57] and I'll probably use that to jump start
[1:15:59] next week but let's go back to Exodus
[1:16:02] let me finish this
[1:16:08] Exodus chapter 12. back to the Paschal
[1:16:11] Lamb again the Passover Lamb
[1:16:14] and I want to talk about something
[1:16:16] that's been a sort of a source of
[1:16:19] misunderstanding in the message and I'll
[1:16:22] be perfectly honest I'll be blunt with
[1:16:25] you uh there have been times that it it
[1:16:28] uh I didn't understand it but as I've
[1:16:31] told you before all of you should know
[1:16:34] what does brother Newton do when he hits
[1:16:36] something he doesn't understand
[1:16:41] he puts it on the Shelf yeah right amen
[1:16:45] God I I don't I can't reconcile this I
[1:16:49] don't understand it
[1:16:51] um
[1:16:52] whatever I know Lord that that whatever
[1:16:56] time you'll do you show it to me amen
[1:16:59] and when that time comes and most of the
[1:17:03] time that might work this way for you
[1:17:05] too I don't know but when that time
[1:17:07] comes for me I'm reading or I'm praying
[1:17:09] or something a lot of times it's just
[1:17:11] been praying right there
[1:17:13] um that that the Lord will just drop it
[1:17:15] to me you know what I do then I go over
[1:17:17] to that shelf and I take it off and I
[1:17:19] plug it right where it goes in the word
[1:17:21] amen and the message and then I'm like
[1:17:24] how beautiful that picture then becomes
[1:17:28] amen how beautiful that picture looks
[1:17:31] then when you can plug that in there and
[1:17:33] say yes now I get it
[1:17:35] it's just the Lord revealing it it's not
[1:17:38] an understanding you're not learning I'm
[1:17:39] not learning anything new as far as uh
[1:17:42] intellect but it's God revealing it
[1:17:45] because I'm not looking for it most of
[1:17:49] the time in fact I can't remember one
[1:17:51] time I'm not looking for it I don't go
[1:17:54] over and take it off the shelf and try
[1:17:55] to say okay and try to figure it out
[1:17:58] I don't normally do that I'll leave it
[1:18:00] up there until the Lord just dropped
[1:18:02] something I said There It Is
[1:18:04] that's it praise God
[1:18:06] that's that's what had been been on my
[1:18:09] heart thinking about looking at praying
[1:18:11] about and there it comes amen when you
[1:18:14] least expect it the Lord brings it down
[1:18:17] the 12th chapter Exodus chapter 12.
[1:18:19] let's go back to this
[1:18:21] the Passover Lamb
[1:18:23] because again I want to get to something
[1:18:26] that is has been somewhat controversial
[1:18:29] if you will
[1:18:31] the Lord's speaking to Moses and Aaron
[1:18:33] in the land of Egypt saying this month
[1:18:35] shall be unto you the beginning of
[1:18:36] months it shall be the first of the
[1:18:38] month of you of the Year to you and
[1:18:40] again we know that's April uh speaking
[1:18:43] unto all the congregation of Israel
[1:18:44] saying in the tenth day of this month
[1:18:46] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[1:18:49] according to the house of their fathers
[1:18:51] a lamb for it house now you take it on
[1:18:53] the 10th day not the first day amen
[1:18:57] which means that they killed it on the
[1:18:59] 14th left up for four days I know
[1:19:02] brother random at one place or so he
[1:19:04] said 14 because it says kill him on the
[1:19:07] 14th day but they didn't take it until
[1:19:10] the 10th amen so it's only four days
[1:19:14] a lamb for a house we went all that last
[1:19:17] week and if the household be too little
[1:19:19] for the lamb let him take his neighbor
[1:19:20] Nixon to his house take it according to
[1:19:22] the number of the souls every man
[1:19:23] according to his eating shall make
[1:19:25] account for the lamb we went over that
[1:19:27] last week your lamb shall be without
[1:19:29] blemish a male of the first year ye
[1:19:32] shall take it out of the sheep for from
[1:19:34] the goats and ye shall keep it up until
[1:19:36] the 14th day of the same month and the
[1:19:39] whole assembly of the congregation of
[1:19:40] Israel shall kill it in the evening amen
[1:19:44] shall kill it in the evening now that's
[1:19:47] a that's the scripture part we went
[1:19:49] through the innocent we went through and
[1:19:52] talked about found the scripture we
[1:19:54] recognize Jesus fulfilling each
[1:19:57] scriptural precedent now not just here
[1:20:00] that's this is all we'll probably get
[1:20:02] into with this but through the Old
[1:20:04] Testament many places David how many
[1:20:06] scriptures how many times did David
[1:20:08] crying out in the inspiration of the
[1:20:10] Holy Spirit or the inspiration of God uh
[1:20:13] not the Holy Spirit speaking through him
[1:20:16] of what was going to happen at the
[1:20:18] crucifixion and Jesus Christ in his life
[1:20:21] and his ministry how many times through
[1:20:23] there but we know that Jesus fulfilled
[1:20:26] those Jesus fulfilled every scriptural
[1:20:30] precedent that was set out for him to
[1:20:32] fulfill amen the testing the trying amen
[1:20:35] the the pure the Innocence Hunter uh the
[1:20:39] the four days
[1:20:40] now it says to take in the 14th day of
[1:20:44] April
[1:20:45] the whole congregate the holistic of the
[1:20:48] congregation of Israel shall kill it
[1:20:49] when
[1:20:51] in the evening time what did we talk
[1:20:53] about last week what is the evening time
[1:20:56] when are the evening time start
[1:20:58] now it could be subjective if you look
[1:21:01] at it in nominal terms if you go outside
[1:21:04] and look at it you say well I think the
[1:21:07] evening starts at six
[1:21:09] well let's start from six in the summer
[1:21:11] or in the winter
[1:21:13] amen amen amen does it start when the
[1:21:16] Sun is setting officially there's
[1:21:18] supposed to be an official sunset to me
[1:21:21] Sunset is when the sun the crest of the
[1:21:25] the end of the sun is past the Tucson
[1:21:27] mountains that to me Sunset that's
[1:21:29] evening time but that's subjective
[1:21:32] because it never fits what the official
[1:21:35] sunset time is supposed to be so what it
[1:21:37] some people think the evening time is
[1:21:39] nine o'clock
[1:21:40] 10 o'clock that's evening it's pitch
[1:21:43] dark and now it's evening time so what
[1:21:45] is it it's subjective to almost
[1:21:48] everybody but we know by scripture
[1:21:52] spiritually not normally now but
[1:21:55] spiritually we know scripture what the
[1:21:57] evening time is because Peter told us on
[1:22:00] the day of Pentecost Peter's filled with
[1:22:03] the Holy Ghost and he said this is what
[1:22:06] we read about Joel that in the last days
[1:22:11] amen this would be poured out on All
[1:22:13] Flesh now there is a difference look now
[1:22:16] there's a difference in the evening time
[1:22:19] which we've been living in and the
[1:22:22] evening time light they are synonymous
[1:22:24] but they are different
[1:22:26] amen because they lived in an evening
[1:22:29] time they lived in the last days as
[1:22:32] Peter said as Joel said the last days we
[1:22:36] know that this is the last stage this is
[1:22:38] the end of it being as subjective as it
[1:22:41] is but we know scripturally that we are
[1:22:43] living in the last days in fact we know
[1:22:46] now we are not just living in the
[1:22:48] evening time weed because of a message
[1:22:51] that God brought to us through a prophet
[1:22:53] we are living in an evening time light
[1:22:56] amen praise God because light is what
[1:22:59] shed upon the upon things we don't know
[1:23:03] and brings light to it to bring it
[1:23:05] manifest they didn't have that they had
[1:23:08] the they had Christ they had the holy
[1:23:11] ghost at the day of Pentecost they were
[1:23:13] speaking in tongues the spirit was
[1:23:14] moving they had the Holy Ghost in them
[1:23:17] on them and they were moving about but
[1:23:19] they did not have
[1:23:21] listened closely now they did not have
[1:23:24] the evening time light
[1:23:27] because there were still many things in
[1:23:29] this word that had not been made light
[1:23:32] yet that had not been made manifest and
[1:23:36] the only way you can bring something to
[1:23:38] manifestation is to shine light on it
[1:23:42] that's the purpose of the evening time
[1:23:45] light amen so we're not friends today
[1:23:49] just living in the evening time
[1:23:51] we are living in evening time light
[1:23:54] praise God yes they've been in the
[1:23:57] evening time because this has always
[1:23:59] been progressing yes amen when the
[1:24:03] fullness came
[1:24:05] what is that fullness going to be for us
[1:24:07] amen well God sent a prophet to bring a
[1:24:11] message yes to unveil when this when the
[1:24:14] seals were preached friends there wasn't
[1:24:16] one thing in the scripture that was left
[1:24:18] unknown
[1:24:19] now there'll be things that God unfails
[1:24:21] to us through eternity but things that
[1:24:23] God put in here for us to know the
[1:24:26] reasons that God has for us to see it
[1:24:29] through the evening time light has all
[1:24:31] been manifested
[1:24:33] praise God God has done that so we could
[1:24:36] see it so we could know it amen that's
[1:24:40] why we're leaving they didn't have it in
[1:24:42] in Paul's day in Luther's day in
[1:24:45] Wesley's they didn't have it through
[1:24:46] Martin's day
[1:24:48] that light came to manifest all truth
[1:24:52] now it started to break itself out with
[1:24:55] loser
[1:24:56] now through the Dark Ages uh we'll talk
[1:24:59] about in a minute that that Spirit was
[1:25:01] bound that wasn't able to move
[1:25:04] but when the restoration prophets came
[1:25:06] along these reformers I should say came
[1:25:09] along Luther a little light was shed
[1:25:13] and a little bit was manifested to show
[1:25:16] wow this is this is what the scripture
[1:25:19] says not necessarily what it means
[1:25:21] because that's what a lot of churches
[1:25:24] want to preach to people is what they
[1:25:26] think the message or the scripture means
[1:25:29] uh we really want to know what the
[1:25:31] scripture says and when Luther read it
[1:25:34] and said the just shall live by faith
[1:25:36] that was it
[1:25:37] amen justification found its place
[1:25:40] because a little light would shine upon
[1:25:43] it it opened itself up and he could see
[1:25:46] it and he preached it and we can see it
[1:25:48] the same today amen amen justification
[1:25:51] just shall live by faith when Wesley
[1:25:54] came along a little bit more like with
[1:25:56] Sean
[1:25:57] it brought out a light of sanctification
[1:25:59] a life that should be lived that is in
[1:26:02] the place of being Sanctified to where
[1:26:05] you're you are proud of the life you
[1:26:08] live to call yourself a Christian
[1:26:10] Amen to be to live a Sanctified life now
[1:26:14] most methodists probably don't even have
[1:26:16] a clue what that even means but
[1:26:19] but
[1:26:20] sanctification is just the second work
[1:26:23] of Grace from justification they Shone a
[1:26:27] little more light to help us understand
[1:26:29] there's more to it than just
[1:26:31] justification
[1:26:32] and now we see that in this last time
[1:26:36] when when it promised again to pour out
[1:26:39] the spirit in this last time and this
[1:26:42] evening time when the light was
[1:26:44] beginning to shine itself brother random
[1:26:46] was born God was bringing forth the
[1:26:48] truth of his word a little bit of light
[1:26:50] continued to shine forth
[1:26:52] amen and in brother Brown's Ministry
[1:26:55] light was shining forth
[1:26:58] so then when that word came and it began
[1:27:00] to understand it wasn't just
[1:27:01] justification it wasn't just
[1:27:03] sanctification although we have to have
[1:27:06] both you don't forget about either one
[1:27:09] of them you don't discount either one of
[1:27:11] them we need both of them to get to the
[1:27:14] third part and that's the Holy Spirit
[1:27:15] yes when that light was shot and that
[1:27:19] that Veil came off
[1:27:21] and it manifests in itself we could see
[1:27:24] this light
[1:27:25] this truth
[1:27:27] and then when the uh to me the the
[1:27:32] consummation of that when brother random
[1:27:35] went was about to come out and preach
[1:27:38] the seals wrong again which he preached
[1:27:42] it wrong the first time say brother
[1:27:44] Newton how do you say brother ran
[1:27:45] preached wrong because he said he did
[1:27:47] right yeah
[1:27:49] and people want to worship him as God I
[1:27:51] don't know how you're going to reconcile
[1:27:52] that but that's your choice brother
[1:27:54] Branham said he was wrong yes now if
[1:27:57] brother Adam's your God you got a God
[1:27:59] that can be wrong
[1:28:01] amen you're watching listing that's the
[1:28:04] truth
[1:28:06] if you believe brother Brown is your God
[1:28:08] then you've got a God that can be wrong
[1:28:10] because brother Brown said he was wrong
[1:28:12] but then when the Holy Spirit came
[1:28:16] or he could come out the first day
[1:28:18] and showed him the truth praise the Lord
[1:28:22] that changed everything
[1:28:24] amen when the light came and it opened
[1:28:28] itself up and you could see it oh praise
[1:28:31] the Lord it makes everything it
[1:28:33] illuminates everything it makes
[1:28:35] everything so much greater and brighter
[1:28:38] and different anybody ever had problems
[1:28:40] with your eyes
[1:28:43] I know I see several eyeglasses
[1:28:45] obviously I'll look at you right now you
[1:28:48] just look like a bunch of blurry blobs
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:53] the first time I went and I checked out
[1:28:55] and and the doctors flipping those
[1:28:57] things has this better this better this
[1:28:58] better and I'm like wow
[1:29:01] that's how that looks
[1:29:03] amen isn't this so much better than this
[1:29:08] when life Shone on something
[1:29:12] ah I know even in the job we do now
[1:29:14] sometimes before the electricity gets in
[1:29:16] there we don't have lights you got
[1:29:17] temporary lights or something it's real
[1:29:18] dark when the Sun goes down in the
[1:29:20] winter time the sun went down early it
[1:29:22] got dark and you're trying to work on
[1:29:24] something I can't even see this and I go
[1:29:26] get a little light I put it on my head
[1:29:28] and I seriously oh okay now I know what
[1:29:30] I'm doing
[1:29:31] it changes everything yeah and it
[1:29:34] working on the car you're Pat saying
[1:29:36] right now you shot a little light on you
[1:29:38] like yes okay I see
[1:29:41] that's what the word is that's what can
[1:29:43] you imagine brother Adam in that little
[1:29:45] room when God revealed the Holy Spirit
[1:29:47] came and showed that to him yeah bye I
[1:29:51] just I I'm surprised there's still walls
[1:29:53] on that house
[1:29:54] I'm surprised there's still a roof he
[1:29:56] didn't just blow it right off hey man
[1:29:58] you think when God does that and that
[1:30:02] Light of Christ illuminates something
[1:30:04] and makes it real to you it just changes
[1:30:07] everything
[1:30:08] amen praise the Lord that's what the
[1:30:11] evening time light does and the evening
[1:30:14] time light shines brighter than any
[1:30:17] other time
[1:30:19] because the evening time the light is
[1:30:21] brightest
[1:30:22] when it's the darkest light shines the
[1:30:25] brightest in the evening time now let me
[1:30:28] read you a quote
[1:30:30] that again
[1:30:33] a little bit of the confusion because
[1:30:36] people well let me just read it first
[1:30:39] and the token message in Jeffersonville
[1:30:41] he preached like four of them but this
[1:30:43] is the one in Jeffersonville
[1:30:45] the lamb was killed in the evening time
[1:30:47] after being kept up for 14 days here he
[1:30:50] goes he says 14 days it's only four
[1:30:52] on the 10th day to the fourth day
[1:30:55] again
[1:30:56] if you're if God if brother Brahms your
[1:30:59] God your God can make mistakes
[1:31:01] that's it's it's four days scripturally
[1:31:04] then the lamb was killed and the blood
[1:31:07] was applied in the evening time he says
[1:31:10] you get it
[1:31:11] the token now here
[1:31:13] it is the token never came into
[1:31:16] existence until the evening time
[1:31:19] and this is the evening time of the age
[1:31:22] that we live in
[1:31:24] this is the evening time for the church
[1:31:26] this is the evening time for me it's the
[1:31:28] evening time my message I'm dying I'm
[1:31:29] going moving out the evening time of the
[1:31:32] gospel and we've come up through
[1:31:34] justification so forth but this is that
[1:31:37] kind the token has to be applied I told
[1:31:41] you last Sunday uh it's something to
[1:31:43] speak to you about it's got to be done
[1:31:46] if we're going if we're ever going to be
[1:31:49] done it's got to be done now because we
[1:31:51] see the Wrath is already it's about
[1:31:54] ready to pass through the land and if it
[1:31:57] was then in 1963 what in the world you
[1:31:59] think would see when we go out and look
[1:32:01] at this world today yeah
[1:32:03] mine everything from under that token of
[1:32:08] that's not under the token he says from
[1:32:10] under the token but not under that token
[1:32:12] will perish that blood now the statement
[1:32:15] that brother Bradham made I again I use
[1:32:19] in in the South I hear ministers
[1:32:22] preaching about the token not even being
[1:32:24] in existence the holy spirit being in
[1:32:27] existence until the evening time because
[1:32:29] theoretically that's exactly what he
[1:32:31] said the token never come in existence
[1:32:33] until the evening time
[1:32:35] but that's not
[1:32:38] how do I put this without sounding wrong
[1:32:40] the pure interpretation that is not what
[1:32:43] brother Branham was and I hate to say
[1:32:46] the word meaning but that's not the
[1:32:48] point brother Brown was trying to make
[1:32:51] he wasn't trying to make a point that
[1:32:54] now is the only time that the Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit was in existence
[1:32:58] amen because we know and that's the
[1:33:00] thing about for me when I hear these
[1:33:02] brothers saying oh now is the only time
[1:33:04] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:05] it baffled me
[1:33:07] because I look at the scripture which is
[1:33:10] where I go I don't try to battle
[1:33:12] somebody with the message uh brother Ram
[1:33:15] said brother Ram says you can say
[1:33:16] brother random said until the cows come
[1:33:18] home it's one here one there but if we
[1:33:20] got to go back to the scripture because
[1:33:22] that's where he went yes what does the
[1:33:24] scripture say and the scripture says
[1:33:26] that on the day of Pentecost the Holy
[1:33:28] Ghost came down and came on them and in
[1:33:30] them so how do we say that right now he
[1:33:34] said the evening time and the evening
[1:33:35] time is the time that the only time the
[1:33:38] Holy Spirit would be working or the only
[1:33:40] time it would be in existence
[1:33:42] now I just kind of gave it away didn't I
[1:33:45] uh that would be in existence let's go
[1:33:48] look at a scripture here
[1:33:50] which helped me a lot when you look at
[1:33:53] Revelation chapter 9.
[1:33:58] because remember the Paschal Lamb was
[1:34:01] killed in the evening time
[1:34:03] but what did y'all but what did Peter
[1:34:05] say about Joel this is the evening time
[1:34:08] this is the last days amen that or you
[1:34:13] will say the evening time of humanity
[1:34:17] what's the evening time for the Gentiles
[1:34:19] but it was the evening time of humanity
[1:34:22] it was the world was coming to a close
[1:34:24] yes
[1:34:26] he say these are the last days
[1:34:30] that's what we look at not last days for
[1:34:33] Gentiles not last days for Jews but last
[1:34:37] days for Humanity
[1:34:39] amen all the way through these are the
[1:34:41] last days because he's speaking both you
[1:34:43] and Gentile so it couldn't have been one
[1:34:45] or the other and knowing scripturally it
[1:34:48] couldn't have been one or the other
[1:34:49] it had to be the evening time of
[1:34:52] humanity
[1:34:53] the last couple of days
[1:34:56] so when that when when the lamb was
[1:34:58] killed and that Paschal Lamb was killed
[1:35:00] in the evening time when Jesus Christ
[1:35:02] was crucified in the evening time
[1:35:04] because that's when he was killed
[1:35:07] Jesus Christ was killed in the evening
[1:35:09] time of the day
[1:35:11] and in the evening time of humanity with
[1:35:13] a couple of days left a thousand years
[1:35:15] is one day amen one day it's a thousand
[1:35:18] years at the end of this after his death
[1:35:21] burial and Resurrection
[1:35:24] was when the day of Pentecost struck now
[1:35:26] we've got an understanding scripturally
[1:35:29] of the last days
[1:35:32] amen the last days frankly too
[1:35:37] one day is a thousand years
[1:35:39] amen twos now those last days bring us
[1:35:45] to understand that in the in in the
[1:35:48] evening time of humanity that's that
[1:35:51] that was the beginning of it that was
[1:35:54] that evening time as it continued to
[1:35:56] roll on that evening time was was coming
[1:35:59] forth now with a destination time
[1:36:03] last days
[1:36:05] because the the lamb was killed in the
[1:36:09] evening time
[1:36:10] this is the evening time light message
[1:36:14] as brother Ram said but the evening time
[1:36:17] started there so how do we say
[1:36:20] that the that the Holy Spirit never
[1:36:23] never come into existence the token
[1:36:25] never come into existence until now
[1:36:28] when we can look in the scripture and
[1:36:30] see what God did back even on the day of
[1:36:32] Pentecost we just read it
[1:36:34] amen now Revelation chapter 9.
[1:36:39] let's read a couple of scriptures here
[1:36:41] we'll get hopefully get a little better
[1:36:45] revelation of it
[1:36:47] uh as it as it helped me amen Revelation
[1:36:51] chapter 9 verse 13. and the sixth Angel
[1:36:55] sounded
[1:36:56] and Heard a Voice from the four horns of
[1:36:58] the golden altar which is before God
[1:37:00] same to the sixth Angel which had the
[1:37:04] trumpet loose the Four Angels which are
[1:37:07] bound in the great river Euphrates
[1:37:11] and the Four Angels were loosed
[1:37:14] and they which were prepared they were
[1:37:18] there prepared just means they were
[1:37:20] there there was a reason why they were
[1:37:21] there
[1:37:23] they were there they were prepared for a
[1:37:26] specific hour day month and year for to
[1:37:29] slay the third part of men
[1:37:32] amen purpose and the number of the army
[1:37:35] of the horsemen were two hundred
[1:37:38] thousand thousand and I heard the number
[1:37:41] of them two hundred thousand thousand I
[1:37:44] think I've mentioned to you before if
[1:37:45] you do the math of two hundred thousand
[1:37:47] thousand is 200 million
[1:37:50] 200 million demons
[1:37:54] 200 million that were purposed
[1:37:58] to destroy that was their whole point to
[1:38:01] bring destruction to bring death
[1:38:05] now these two hundred thousand thousand
[1:38:09] demons were bound at one time
[1:38:13] and the instruction came to the sixth
[1:38:16] Angel to go and loose them
[1:38:19] and let them go it talked about the four
[1:38:22] angels and the army that was there was
[1:38:24] 200 million amen Horseman it says demons
[1:38:29] to cause death destruction were there
[1:38:31] that we're loose now look what brother
[1:38:34] Brown says here
[1:38:37] in the Feast of the trumpets he said
[1:38:39] while this group down here has got 200
[1:38:43] uh has got has got 2 000 now again he he
[1:38:48] means two hundred thousand thousand
[1:38:51] has got 2 000 bound at the river
[1:38:54] Euphrates and has been bound for 2 000
[1:38:57] years
[1:38:58] been bound for two thousand years
[1:39:01] also
[1:39:03] also
[1:39:05] that church has bound the Holy Ghost for
[1:39:09] nearly 2 000 years under martyrmont back
[1:39:12] there and under the church ages
[1:39:16] it has been found the Holy Spirit
[1:39:20] has been bound
[1:39:22] not at the river Euphrates but that the
[1:39:24] doors of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy
[1:39:28] Spirit can't work in the church because
[1:39:32] of man-made systems
[1:39:35] now if you reconcile this and the
[1:39:38] Scripture it helps you understand when
[1:39:41] brother Graham says it did come in
[1:39:43] existence until the evening time what
[1:39:45] he's talking about is they were bound
[1:39:49] remember you so how could that be well
[1:39:51] think about Daniel for a minute
[1:39:54] how much did Daniel pray and not got an
[1:39:57] answer
[1:39:59] okay
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:02] 23 days
[1:40:04] 22 days what was it
[1:40:06] 21 days prayed prayed prayed prayed no
[1:40:09] answer God where are you now I know it's
[1:40:11] a shorter time frame but he didn't get
[1:40:13] an answer but when the answer finally
[1:40:16] came and that angel broke through to
[1:40:18] Daniel what did he tell him
[1:40:20] he said it was resistance right right
[1:40:22] there was these demonic spirits that
[1:40:25] were keeping me from getting to you
[1:40:28] amen not paraphrasing of course amen so
[1:40:32] when people say well how could that be
[1:40:34] bound well that's exact same way the
[1:40:37] Satan had had such control over the
[1:40:41] church and Christendom that the Holy
[1:40:44] Spirit could not move right it was bound
[1:40:47] at where the Holy Spirit was bound at
[1:40:51] the door of Creeds and dogmas yes it
[1:40:54] could not move now were there little
[1:40:56] were there little uh groups that came
[1:40:59] out of there that had the Holy Spirit
[1:41:01] absolutely out of every age but the
[1:41:04] spirit could not move like it moves
[1:41:07] today amen because the evening time
[1:41:10] light it could not moved in because it
[1:41:13] was bound now when brother Adam said it
[1:41:15] didn't come into existence
[1:41:17] pardon me but that's not exactly what
[1:41:20] he's trying to get across he's trying to
[1:41:22] help us understand the Holy Spirit came
[1:41:25] on Pentecost and it moved among the
[1:41:28] people and through the first church age
[1:41:30] but there was a little blackening out
[1:41:32] and in the second Church age it was even
[1:41:34] blacker third fourth Church age he was
[1:41:37] completely black almost completely black
[1:41:40] to the point that that Spirit could not
[1:41:43] move
[1:41:44] it was bound
[1:41:46] that's what he's talking about now in
[1:41:49] this last time
[1:41:50] when there was a loosening to take place
[1:41:53] and the light was to come upon the bride
[1:41:55] for this last day
[1:41:57] that Spirit came and poured out once
[1:42:00] again
[1:42:01] on Azusa Street and continues to do so
[1:42:04] today now unfortunately
[1:42:08] or fortunately through that time God has
[1:42:11] pulled out bride
[1:42:13] many have gone on many have passed on
[1:42:16] like a preciousness degree
[1:42:18] have passed on but there's many of us
[1:42:20] left yes some of us may yet still taste
[1:42:23] yet but there are going to be a group
[1:42:26] regardless of where this place goes
[1:42:28] friend regardless of what happens in the
[1:42:30] rest of humanity or to the consummation
[1:42:32] there's going to be a group that is
[1:42:35] going to be caught away amen there's
[1:42:37] going to be a group of people that's
[1:42:38] going to make a Rapture yes that's not
[1:42:40] going to taste their human bodies
[1:42:42] they're not going to taste dead
[1:42:44] amen
[1:42:45] that spirit
[1:42:47] that was
[1:42:48] so prevalent back in Pentecost
[1:42:51] that got drowned out down through the
[1:42:53] church ages and we know there was a
[1:42:55] purpose for that
[1:42:56] it was bound it didn't just come into
[1:42:59] existence now it was let loose again
[1:43:03] praise the Lord there was a move of
[1:43:06] spirit and it didn't start overnight
[1:43:10] it started back in the Dark Ages
[1:43:13] and then when the Reformation took place
[1:43:16] and then they started printing they
[1:43:18] started building Gutenberg started
[1:43:20] building a printing press where they
[1:43:22] could take the Bible that was forbidden
[1:43:24] by the common man to read
[1:43:26] they could take the Bible and they could
[1:43:28] Mass produce it and get us to the hands
[1:43:31] of the people
[1:43:32] and then a Wesley would come and then a
[1:43:34] Luther would come along with the
[1:43:35] justification and protest in the
[1:43:38] Catholic Church the West he would come
[1:43:39] along and protest the whole thing the
[1:43:42] Bible started getting into the hands of
[1:43:43] the Common Man and a and a restoration
[1:43:46] started taking place to where it hit on
[1:43:48] the day of uh uh on the Zuzu Street on
[1:43:51] that day and the spirit was loosed again
[1:43:54] not because
[1:43:57] because
[1:43:58] of the because of the people the spirit
[1:44:01] of God it was found but it started to
[1:44:04] loosen itself it didn't happen at once
[1:44:08] but a little bit of light was Sean
[1:44:10] and in a little bit more like
[1:44:12] and now he's living in a daytime friend
[1:44:14] a a date where that evening time light
[1:44:18] is shining brighter than ever am I now
[1:44:21] what I see
[1:44:22] is starting to Wing back again
[1:44:25] we've had what they've called the Jesus
[1:44:28] movements and and
[1:44:30] uh denominations being taking a back
[1:44:34] seat a little bit when charismatic
[1:44:36] churches started coming forth again and
[1:44:38] rising and people with all kinds of
[1:44:40] gifts and stuff and these the anointings
[1:44:43] and and
[1:44:44] but it's all starting but the focal
[1:44:47] point
[1:44:48] is not the gift
[1:44:50] the focal point is not the on the focal
[1:44:54] point is the in the word the revelation
[1:44:57] of the word because he is the word and
[1:45:00] we are to become the word his bride will
[1:45:03] be a word bride because that's the only
[1:45:05] thing he can marry is the word bride
[1:45:08] because he is the word I can't marry a
[1:45:10] turtle because I'm not a turtle
[1:45:12] amen although some people are doing that
[1:45:15] today
[1:45:16] but some people are even marrying
[1:45:18] themselves
[1:45:19] I'm like knock yourself out I mean good
[1:45:22] luck trying to procreate with yourself
[1:45:24] but
[1:45:25] people want to marry themselves that
[1:45:27] that's their choice amen I'm some people
[1:45:31] Mary
[1:45:34] a garment
[1:45:36] or an animal
[1:45:38] I mean Scott's so perverted but in God's
[1:45:42] terms I can't marry a turtle because I'm
[1:45:44] a human
[1:45:45] God can't marry anything but the word
[1:45:47] because he is the word amen that's it
[1:45:50] and that's what she is going to be so in
[1:45:53] the midst of all this it is waning back
[1:45:55] to where the focus of the of the purity
[1:45:59] of the uh the unhybrid word of God has
[1:46:03] been taken off again
[1:46:05] the focus has come off the word they're
[1:46:08] still a bride
[1:46:10] that it's going to hold to this word
[1:46:11] that's going to hold to this truth it's
[1:46:14] going to hold to this message it's going
[1:46:16] to believe with everything that's in
[1:46:17] them regardless of what happens out in
[1:46:19] the world regardless of what all of the
[1:46:22] nominations now they're not denomination
[1:46:24] anymore but they have a denominational
[1:46:25] spirit and charismatic churches and what
[1:46:28] all that's I have nothing against any of
[1:46:30] them if they can try to help somebody or
[1:46:32] bring somebody in or give them just as
[1:46:33] much as they know then let it get let
[1:46:36] them give it to them
[1:46:37] but there will be abroad
[1:46:39] that'll be born again and they'll have
[1:46:41] the spirit of God living in them and the
[1:46:43] word will be the thing that's there that
[1:46:45] is their meat
[1:46:46] that's what they care about that's their
[1:46:48] Paramount that's their that's everything
[1:46:51] yeah because this is Jesus Christ yes
[1:46:54] this is what's Christ but the word in
[1:46:57] word form
[1:46:58] amen the word of God so as it's waning
[1:47:02] back away again and we knew it would I
[1:47:05] mean
[1:47:06] brother Brown quoted Paul when he said
[1:47:08] Grievous wolves would come in upon my
[1:47:10] party and they've done exactly that upon
[1:47:12] brother Brown is the party Grievous
[1:47:14] wolves come in and they say this that
[1:47:15] and the other even in the message yes
[1:47:17] all kinds of things are said and done
[1:47:19] and under the auspice of of the message
[1:47:22] under the auspice of Christianity it's
[1:47:25] amazing the stuff that people will bring
[1:47:27] under that auspice of Christianity Today
[1:47:29] and say I'm a Christian and then
[1:47:34] they live like a devil I just
[1:47:39] they live like a devil but they say
[1:47:41] they're Christians they go to church
[1:47:43] probably faithful to church
[1:47:45] a lot I'm probably very faithful to
[1:47:47] church
[1:47:48] and go and say they aren't but that's
[1:47:52] not where it's at this is where it's at
[1:47:54] everybody
[1:47:56] this is where it's at
[1:47:58] that's why
[1:48:00] if this church never existed again if we
[1:48:03] never had another service here if I was
[1:48:06] never able to see any of you or you see
[1:48:08] anyone in here ever again it's you and
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:14] you take that away from so many people
[1:48:16] you take the message away from people or
[1:48:19] or you take all these crutches that
[1:48:22] people have away from them they have
[1:48:24] nothing
[1:48:26] but if everything's taken away from you
[1:48:28] you know what you've got yes
[1:48:31] you've got him
[1:48:33] because that's what your relationship is
[1:48:35] now
[1:48:36] your relationship isn't Church you and
[1:48:39] God or the message you and God or your
[1:48:42] spouse or your pastor you and God it's
[1:48:44] you and God Amen
[1:48:46] you and God Alone amen amen this evening
[1:48:49] timeline has come to shine light on this
[1:48:52] word so that it can be revealed to us so
[1:48:56] that we can see things that God opens
[1:48:58] our eyes to see things that many people
[1:49:01] probably maybe even want to see but
[1:49:03] can't see
[1:49:05] I can't see blind
[1:49:09] God help us
[1:49:12] in that we are in that place right now
[1:49:14] yes we're we're really what 57 going on
[1:49:19] 58 years since brother Brown passed away
[1:49:21] and we're we're right at that crossroads
[1:49:23] to me
[1:49:25] amen
[1:49:26] where it goes from here is up to the
[1:49:29] person
[1:49:30] to the world
[1:49:32] or to Christ
[1:49:34] the world's going to stay down and go
[1:49:36] their way but we're going up
[1:49:39] the bride's going up
[1:49:41] amen let's stand if we could
[1:49:53] so when people say the Holy Spirit
[1:49:55] didn't come into existence until the
[1:49:57] till the evening time and that's a pure
[1:49:59] quote
[1:50:00] absolutely exactly what he said
[1:50:03] check to make sure what they they know
[1:50:05] what they're talking about
[1:50:08] the Holy Spirit was absolutely in
[1:50:11] existence from the day of Pentecost till
[1:50:14] today
[1:50:15] but it got bound
[1:50:17] it couldn't move like we feel it like we
[1:50:20] know it to move today it was bound
[1:50:23] because of the Creeds and dogmas the
[1:50:25] teachings of what were their teaching
[1:50:27] were the Creeds and dogmas come from it
[1:50:29] wasn't the anointing
[1:50:31] it's the word
[1:50:33] Creeds and dogmas don't come from an
[1:50:35] anointing it comes from the word
[1:50:37] Satan's not worried about you feeling a
[1:50:39] tingling on your flesh he doesn't want
[1:50:41] you to get the revelation of the word
[1:50:43] amen
[1:50:45] the Crete and dogmas comes from a
[1:50:48] hibernation of the word and that's how
[1:50:51] the spirit gets bound because the word
[1:50:53] is not free
[1:50:55] it couldn't move
[1:50:56] they didn't know wasn't not wasn't their
[1:51:00] fault to say necessarily we of course
[1:51:02] went through the Dark Ages went through
[1:51:03] the fox book of Martyrs and those things
[1:51:06] you meant they couldn't they didn't know
[1:51:08] that those those brothers and sisters
[1:51:10] didn't have this bible to read
[1:51:13] all they had was what the priest told
[1:51:15] them
[1:51:15] and the priest told them believe what we
[1:51:18] tell you
[1:51:19] and then when they started getting the
[1:51:21] Bible in their hands for themselves they
[1:51:22] started to find out that the priests
[1:51:24] were lying
[1:51:25] and all this money and all this Penance
[1:51:27] and all his Indulgence not even
[1:51:30] scriptural
[1:51:32] amen my mind but praise God for an
[1:51:35] evening time life amen amen praise God
[1:51:39] for an evening timeline
[1:51:41] amen
[1:51:43] I wanted to sing a song that sister
[1:51:45] green sang
