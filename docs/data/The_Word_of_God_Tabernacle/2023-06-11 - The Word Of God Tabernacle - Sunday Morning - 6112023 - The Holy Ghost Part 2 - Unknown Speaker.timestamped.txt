[32:06] we
[32:07] it's a Sunday occurrence for your pastor
[32:10] so it happens every Sunday
[32:13] always thoughts and I just be honest
[32:16] thoughts come in why do you do this why
[32:18] are you still here or why you know all
[32:21] those things all the time and then of
[32:22] course amen you get in prayer here and
[32:25] the Lord just moves and then you get
[32:27] into service he sweeps through and you
[32:29] like cutting my praise God Amen there's
[32:32] nothing like it amen no substitute I
[32:34] heard somebody said the other day said
[32:37] uh it was a question he was asking back
[32:39] and forth they said where where would
[32:41] you like to be when you pass away and
[32:45] you know and you die where where would
[32:47] you want to be now different people is
[32:49] states or cities or whatever I said
[32:53] personally you know outside of maybe
[32:55] your sleep I guess that's maybe one of
[32:57] the more people peaceful things but
[33:00] um
[33:01] right here
[33:02] I guess if I was if I was if this was
[33:05] man was never taste death I'd want to be
[33:08] right in the whole pit preaching the
[33:10] department preaching the gospel as in
[33:12] best answer I can think of anyway praise
[33:14] the Lord said it might be traumatic for
[33:16] those standing here sitting there but
[33:18] for me personally there's there's just
[33:21] nothing like uh being here Amen to me
[33:26] praise the Lord amen let's stand to our
[33:28] feet if we could and we'll turn the
[33:30] scripture again today

[36:46] Genesis chapter 3 verse 21.
[36:49] unto Adam also unto his wife did the
[36:52] Lord God make coats and skins and
[36:55] clothed him you could be seated if you'd
[36:57] like
[36:58] amen we notice beginning just just a few
[37:01] moments of uh going back from last week
[37:04] we noticed that uh it was God's decision
[37:07] that it took blood we understand why
[37:11] that it took blood because the original
[37:13] sin was a blood act it was a transfer of
[37:17] hemoglobin and blood so the the
[37:19] sacrifice had to meet the sin so Jesus
[37:23] coming but we also recognize of course
[37:25] through what God did here and helping
[37:28] Adam and Eve understand that they had to
[37:30] become a part of their sacrifice and had
[37:32] to be clothed in their sacrifice
[37:34] identified with their sacrifice that uh
[37:37] Cain and Abel had to be along the same
[37:39] uh the song along the same lines they
[37:42] had to be the exact same way they had to
[37:44] become identified with their sacrifice
[37:46] and the fact that Cain's sacrifice
[37:49] failed in in the most important part and
[37:54] that was the life the blood identifying
[37:57] with their sac sacrifice
[37:59] able sacrifice was more excellent
[38:02] because of Revelation because of Faith
[38:04] he offered to God a more excellent
[38:05] sacrifice identified himself with his
[38:08] sacrifice and recognizing that it took
[38:11] the blood it was the blood that was that
[38:13] was God's decision a lot of people try
[38:16] to get away from the blood a lot of
[38:17] people in modern religion want to do
[38:19] away with the blood don't want to sing
[38:21] songs about the blood but friend without
[38:23] that blood where would any of us be they
[38:26] want to look at the carnal part of it in
[38:28] the chemistry of the blood but the
[38:30] chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ
[38:32] merely fell on the earth to redeem the
[38:34] Earth back it's the light that's in the
[38:36] blood that come back on the worshiper
[38:38] that is the holy spirit that we know of
[38:40] it was the light that was in the blood
[38:42] that God recognized when he killed the
[38:45] Lambs and gave Adam and Eve the
[38:47] sheepskin it was the life in the blood
[38:49] that God identified with able sacrifice
[38:52] as being more excellent than Cain
[38:54] sacrifice it's the life within the blood
[38:56] that God recognized that makes the
[38:59] difference between God and man and it's
[39:02] that light that's in that blood is what
[39:04] changes the whole thing the breaking of
[39:07] that blood cell is what makes before God
[39:09] a a sacrifice that he receives unto
[39:13] himself amen that blood in your heart
[39:16] amen had to be uh identified there had
[39:20] to be the sacrifice there had to be the
[39:22] the life that that brought back amen now
[39:26] of course the animal didn't have a soul
[39:28] there was no way that life could
[39:30] identify back as far as the soul is
[39:33] concerned like when Jesus Christ the
[39:35] Supreme sacrifice the soul came the Holy
[39:39] Spirit back into man to identify with
[39:42] each one of us today not just the
[39:44] chemistry of the blood but recognizing
[39:47] that our sacrifice died for us and that
[39:50] we become identified with our sacrifice
[39:52] because of his life in US amen now
[39:57] all of us
[39:59] all of us live on dead substance all of
[40:03] us live on dead substance whether it's
[40:05] naturally or spiritually we all live on
[40:08] dead substance naturally and spiritually
[40:10] something had to die spiritually for us
[40:13] to live before God Almighty spiritually
[40:16] in his presence something has to die
[40:19] naturally for you to live naturally
[40:22] um you have vegans you have uh uh
[40:27] uh I don't even know a vegetarians uh
[40:30] they don't believe in eating meat and
[40:32] and some for good reason and that's okay
[40:35] that's their choice but you know those
[40:37] who don't believe in uh killing an
[40:40] animal uh don't recognize that
[40:43] whatever you eat it had to die for you
[40:46] to be able to live
[40:48] if you chopped off a lead ahead of us
[40:51] ahead of lettuce that lettuce had to die
[40:53] for you to be able to live if you cut
[40:56] down asparagus brussels sprouts green
[40:58] beans whatever it is that fruit a
[41:00] vegetable it had to die for you to be
[41:03] able to live the problem is in the
[41:06] carnal line they don't see the depth of
[41:08] Botany life the way they see the death
[41:10] of animals because let's face it a peach
[41:13] doesn't usually look back at you
[41:15] an apple doesn't usually uh uh lick you
[41:20] or or befriend you uh when you cut an
[41:25] apple blood doesn't come out so and
[41:28] identifying it as such uh even if a
[41:32] person simply eats botany like they
[41:35] steal the body in life has to die before
[41:37] they can live so something has to die
[41:40] naturally for us to be able to sustain
[41:43] natural life then obviously something
[41:45] has to die spiritually for us to live in
[41:49] a spiritual life for our lives to live
[41:51] spiritually now it's the life that's in
[41:55] that blood that's what makes a
[41:57] difference let's go over to Genesis uh
[41:59] chapter 4 just right over Genesis 4 1.
[42:05] I'm not going to background anymore on
[42:08] Cain and Abel sacrifice than I already
[42:10] had but I wanted to read beginning with
[42:13] the first verse for this subject to gain
[42:17] the entirety of totality of the
[42:19] scripture reading up to this point
[42:22] so we'll start with the first verse
[42:24] Genesis chapter 4 verse 1.
[42:27] and Adam knew Eve his wife and she
[42:30] conceived in Bear Cain and said I have
[42:32] gotten a man from the Lord again of
[42:34] course all life comes from God
[42:37] amen all life comes from God so even if
[42:41] it's a even if it's a wrong kind of life
[42:43] even if from people that are uh atheists
[42:47] or people that are uh drug addicts or
[42:50] drunkards whatever uh they could be the
[42:53] two most low life people on the planet
[42:55] that life has to come from God Amen we
[42:59] talked about that in the Book of Life
[43:01] Lamb's Book of Life all life is sacred
[43:03] to God Amen remember that no brother Ram
[43:06] said we know all life is sacred to God
[43:09] Amen no matter what comes so when she
[43:12] said I've gotten a man from the Lord
[43:14] obviously she got a man from the Lord
[43:15] because all life comes from God so that
[43:18] doesn't someone tries to argue that with
[43:20] the serpent seed uh that doesn't carry
[43:23] much water because the fact is all life
[43:25] comes from God and she again bear his
[43:28] brother Abel and Abel is The Keeper of
[43:30] the sheep and Cain was a jeweler of the
[43:31] ground in the process of time it came to
[43:34] pass they came brought to the fruit of
[43:36] the ground and offering unto the Lord
[43:37] and Abel he also brought up the first
[43:39] things of his flock and of the fat
[43:41] thereof and the Lord had respect him to
[43:43] Abel and to his offering but unto Canaan
[43:47] to his offering he had not respect and
[43:49] Cain was very rough in his accountants
[43:52] fell
[43:53] the Lord said unto Cain why art thou
[43:56] wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen
[43:59] if thou know to me I've said this before
[44:04] and I'll say it again to me this is one
[44:07] of the greatest acts of the grace of God
[44:10] that I that you'll ever see in the Bible
[44:12] in my opinion one of the greatest acts
[44:15] of the grace of God even though the
[44:19] grace of God hadn't reached the
[44:20] magnification that we know it today by
[44:23] the blood of Jesus Christ still God a
[44:26] merciful god
[44:28] who would that all would repent amen
[44:32] that merciful god speaking live to ear
[44:35] if you will to the serpent seat himself
[44:39] and told him this if thou doest well
[44:43] shalt thou not be accepted
[44:47] mine God is saved if you just do right I
[44:52] will accept you being the serpent seed
[44:56] God was willing to accept Cain
[44:59] being the serpent scene if he would just
[45:02] do right
[45:03] that's why we know as brother Graham
[45:05] said many times that if Satan came
[45:08] through the blood he would be your
[45:10] brother
[45:11] but said he can't do it because it's not
[45:14] in him to do he it wasn't for him in him
[45:17] to be able to do amen
[45:19] Satan can quote every word of this Bible
[45:22] every word of this message letter for
[45:25] letter A word by word way better than
[45:28] any human
[45:30] brother random even himself
[45:32] but he can't live it
[45:34] he can't obey it
[45:36] that's the difference in in someone who
[45:40] believes they've got the Holy Ghost and
[45:42] someone who has the Holy Ghost
[45:44] someone who has the Holy Ghost
[45:46] receives the word and the only way you
[45:49] can receive the word is to become the
[45:51] word he can't do that
[45:53] if he were to do that again he would be
[45:56] your brother if Cain had done that God
[45:59] said I will receive you if you'll just
[46:01] do that but he wouldn't do it couldn't
[46:03] do it
[46:05] and if doubts again
[46:08] to me if that's not the grace of God I
[46:10] don't know I don't know where you find
[46:11] it
[46:13] offering offering the serpent seed an
[46:16] opportunity to repent
[46:19] mine that's a just God there that's a
[46:22] fair and righteous and just God
[46:25] amen and if thou doest uh and if thou
[46:28] doest not well sin lieth at the door and
[46:32] unto thee shall be his desire and thou
[46:34] shalt rule over him Cain talked with
[46:36] Abel now his brother and he came to pass
[46:39] when they were in the field that Cain
[46:40] rose up against Abel his brother and
[46:42] slew him again had not in him the
[46:46] capacity to do right he was of the wrong
[46:49] seed
[46:50] amen
[46:52] you can beg all day long for a tree to
[46:56] bring forth oranges but if you put an
[46:58] apple seed in the ground you're going to
[47:00] get apples
[47:02] they don't count how hard you try I
[47:04] don't know how much you water and I
[47:05] don't care how much fertilizer you may
[47:07] put a uh some magically chemistry
[47:11] generated by science something that will
[47:15] change the seed it will not happen
[47:18] if what was in that seed was planted
[47:20] comes forth it's going to be an apple
[47:22] not oranges don't matter how hard you
[47:25] try
[47:26] and this cane was of the serpent seat
[47:28] and no matter how much God offered it to
[47:30] him in fact it doesn't say but could you
[47:33] imagine I mean a lot of people do this
[47:35] so I I can only kind of Garner what I
[47:39] have learned out of life to apply it to
[47:41] the scripture and a lot of people when
[47:44] you offer it to them oh they're gung-ho
[47:46] they like the thought of it they want to
[47:48] do that they they they their desires
[47:50] they they want to go that way but they
[47:53] can't do it when it comes right down to
[47:55] the rubber meeting the road they just
[47:58] don't have it in them to do they just
[48:01] they just won't do it they turn and walk
[48:03] away sometimes they may come to church
[48:04] for a little while sometimes they may
[48:06] play the part a little while but the
[48:08] truth of it is it's just not in them to
[48:10] do it wasn't then came to do I can
[48:12] imagine King's probably sitting there
[48:14] talking to God thinking okay yeah man
[48:16] I'll I'll do what's right uh that he may
[48:19] have even said I promise I'll do I'll do
[48:22] what's right but then when it came down
[48:24] to to enacting or living remember when
[48:28] John when God said eat the book and it
[48:31] was sweetest honey in his mouth became
[48:33] bitter in his belly well when someone
[48:36] receives the word it's something that
[48:37] comes to Sweden say oh that's wonderful
[48:39] yes I like hearing that yes that sounds
[48:41] good oh I enjoy being around those
[48:43] people oh I like feeling that Spirit but
[48:45] when it comes to living it amen when it
[48:48] comes to digesting it it became bitter
[48:51] yeah amen now to those that have the
[48:54] Holy Ghost they have something to take
[48:57] over and to control them to the point
[48:59] control is probably not the right word
[49:01] but allow them to to in obedience by
[49:05] love to Christ to do the work to live
[49:07] the word
[49:09] but others don't when it when it gets
[49:12] down to that point they can't live it
[49:15] when it comes to actually oh yes God
[49:18] that sounds great I love that that
[49:20] sounds wonderful but when it comes down
[49:22] to actually meeting your life needing
[49:25] those expectations it will fail
[49:28] miserably you know why because it's you
[49:31] doing it
[49:32] is the person doing it you can't do it
[49:37] we cannot live this life without him
[49:40] that's why we love him so much
[49:42] amen that's why we love him so that's
[49:45] why we live in an act and do the way we
[49:47] do because we love him amen
[49:50] praise the lord we love him see but when
[49:54] it come down I can imagine Kane probably
[49:56] thought that was a great deal that
[49:57] sounds good God but when it come right
[49:59] down to it he meets his brother amen
[50:02] whom he was still already mad at
[50:05] are still mad at amen and when he met
[50:09] him and talked to him he ended up
[50:10] killing him
[50:12] and the Lord said unto Caine where is
[50:14] Abel thy brother and he said I know not
[50:16] am I My Brother's Keeper now that's
[50:18] exactly the Arrogant smug attitude amen
[50:22] a lot of people have it today
[50:24] amen am I My Brother's Keeper you manage
[50:27] talking
[50:29] amen but God's a just God now God's a
[50:32] fair God he understands we as humans we
[50:35] we probably get beside ourselves
[50:37] sometimes say things maybe we shouldn't
[50:39] say Amen but uh but he said but then God
[50:43] said what hath thou done now again
[50:49] I liken this to what we sp Let me just
[50:53] finish it and then we'll go from there
[50:56] because I sometimes I want you to
[50:58] understand
[50:59] when the Lord enlightens me on things
[51:01] and shows me things
[51:03] and sometimes gives me the words even
[51:05] just because my mouth's open
[51:08] he puts things in my mouth I don't even
[51:10] know right until after it's said yeah
[51:12] and he did that in prayer for me this
[51:13] morning I was talking to him and
[51:15] something came out of my mouth I said
[51:16] why did I even say that
[51:18] but then it brought it brought to me
[51:21] something that enlightened it was just
[51:23] it was just beautiful I said that that's
[51:25] a question I had been in my heart
[51:27] looking for
[51:28] anyway
[51:29] so we don't know but to help you
[51:32] understand scripturally now so let's
[51:34] finish he said I know not am I My
[51:38] Brother's Keeper
[51:39] and he said what hast thou done the
[51:42] voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto
[51:45] me from the ground now
[51:48] we'll get to the voice of the blood in a
[51:50] minute the life and the blood which was
[51:52] the point of the scripture reading here
[51:53] but I want you to understand where I
[51:56] come from when I talk about or or I feel
[52:00] like the Lord's give me something that
[52:02] that may look like it's not in the
[52:04] scripture
[52:05] but if you look
[52:08] peoples have never met Jesus I don't
[52:11] know Jesus but if you if you read the
[52:14] scripture first of all you have a spirit
[52:16] and you read the scripture and you get
[52:19] his characteristics
[52:21] um
[52:22] my wife knows
[52:25] now I don't have to tell her but she
[52:28] knows that if we were to go to a sushi
[52:31] restaurant I would not eat
[52:34] she knows that I'm giving something
[52:36] simple
[52:37] okay she knows that I don't have to tell
[52:40] her that because she knows me
[52:43] you understand
[52:46] a lot of times people say well it
[52:48] doesn't exactly say that but when you
[52:50] know God and you know the
[52:53] characteristics of Jesus Christ through
[52:55] his spirit in you and what his word says
[52:58] about him you don't have to have
[53:00] something necessarily in black and white
[53:03] because you know what is characteristics
[53:05] are yeah
[53:06] and the fact that I mentioned the other
[53:09] day uh that may have looked contrary to
[53:12] the scripture when it says that Adam hid
[53:16] from God and God come down and said
[53:18] where are you Adam remember
[53:20] what we talked about
[53:23] God knows everything that ever happens
[53:27] ever in the universe
[53:29] to every millisecond to the smallest bug
[53:35] bird whatever it is on the Earth
[53:39] everything about everybody and
[53:41] everything everything you've said
[53:43] everything you've thought there's not
[53:46] one thing God doesn't know about that's
[53:48] the almighty God I'm talking about so if
[53:51] you have that God coming down and asking
[53:54] where are you
[53:56] you take the omnipotence of God away
[53:59] when you take that scripture at face
[54:02] value that God didn't actually know
[54:04] where Adam was
[54:07] you can't take for face value that God
[54:10] because God is the God of all time space
[54:14] and Eternity
[54:15] nothing can happen to us know about you
[54:18] can't go anywhere he doesn't know where
[54:20] you are so how could that Almighty
[54:23] omnipotent God all knowing
[54:26] Universal
[54:28] I'm the present God not know where Adam
[54:31] was
[54:33] now look at this scripture this
[54:35] scripture
[54:37] God is coming to Cain
[54:40] and he has Cain where is your brother
[54:43] Abel again as if though God doesn't know
[54:47] where Abel is
[54:49] see if you take that scripture face
[54:51] value you say well this God doesn't even
[54:53] know where Abel is because he's asking
[54:55] cable world no he's not asking Cain
[54:58] where's your brother
[55:00] he's asking Cain where is your brother
[55:03] like he didn't ask Adam where are you
[55:07] Adam do you know where you are Adam
[55:10] where are you in the sense do you know
[55:12] what you did do you know where you are
[55:13] God is asking Cain the same thing God
[55:16] knows exactly where Abel is
[55:18] but he's asking Cain cane what have you
[55:21] done
[55:22] what have you done to your brother Abel
[55:24] where is your brother Abel that you've
[55:26] done this and Katie's like well I don't
[55:28] know I'm Not My Brother's Keeper and God
[55:30] says what his blood is crying to me
[55:33] so what God is now telling Cain is
[55:37] I know where he is Cain
[55:39] and his blood's crying out to me the
[55:43] light that was in the blood that you
[55:45] just took from him is calling out God
[55:48] knows exactly where he is she
[55:51] understands he he's not asking King
[55:54] where Abel is in the sense of I don't
[55:56] know where Abel is he's asking him in
[55:59] the sense of Cain do you know what
[56:01] you've done you know where he is it is
[56:04] because then God comes along and tells
[56:06] Cain I know exactly where he is because
[56:08] his blood's crying out to me amen
[56:11] so when you when you when you check the
[56:14] context and uh and the characteristic in
[56:18] the scripture you can know
[56:21] that I wasn't off my rocker when I was
[56:24] talking about God in the scripture
[56:26] saying Where Art Thou Adam
[56:29] he knew exactly where Adam was
[56:31] he knew exactly where Abel was now
[56:34] Abel's blood so hopefully
[56:36] by the scripture you can clarify and
[56:39] understand if someone
[56:42] gets up and tries to bring that
[56:45] administrate face value that God doesn't
[56:47] know where Abel is like God didn't know
[56:49] where Adam and Eve were
[56:51] God knew exactly where they were because
[56:53] he's God
[56:54] you make God less than what he really is
[56:58] he's the omnipresent Almighty omnipotent
[57:01] all-knowing God amen amen you make him
[57:05] in to believe that in that context you
[57:08] make him less than what he is
[57:10] amen God knows exactly he does the same
[57:14] thing to us
[57:15] and God speaks to us in that way maybe
[57:18] not live to hear audibly but he speaks
[57:21] to us in that context too amen
[57:24] because it's uh it's the test for us
[57:28] what is God testing us about what is God
[57:31] proving us
[57:33] so that we know amen I I want to know
[57:37] and God tests us so that we know he
[57:41] knows
[57:43] amen there's no doubt about that he
[57:45] knows but he wants to know and make sure
[57:47] we know
[57:49] amen now this Blood the blood of Abel
[57:53] the blood of Abel the light that was in
[57:56] the blood when the blood cell was broke
[57:59] the life released
[58:01] when before almighty God
[58:04] and that blood was speaking
[58:07] that blood was speaking to God
[58:10] amen the Life In The Blood now it can
[58:13] bring in a better light to understand
[58:15] why God would accept that as a sacrifice
[58:18] even if it was just a bull's goats
[58:21] sheeps Lambs even if it was just a
[58:24] animal life that was a covering for them
[58:26] in that day even if it was something
[58:28] simple as that that life in that blood
[58:31] spoke to God now there was no soul in
[58:34] the animal so it doesn't speak per se in
[58:37] the context that Abel's blood does
[58:40] but that blood before God signifies a
[58:44] life was sacrificed for their life
[58:48] to cover their wrongdoings
[58:52] amen because there's no way the law
[58:56] could make anybody perfect
[58:58] there's no way that the law could
[59:01] justify anybody there's no way that the
[59:04] law could take you back to being clean
[59:07] and pure without spot wrinkle or blemish
[59:10] there's no way the lock
[59:13] amen even the blood of the bulls and
[59:16] goats wasn't sufficient it just covered
[59:19] amen it's just like uh it's just like
[59:22] this bottle of water now it didn't cover
[59:24] it very good but you know if this was
[59:26] big enough you wouldn't be able to see
[59:28] this bottle of water you wouldn't even
[59:29] know it was here because it covered it
[59:31] but see it's still there
[59:33] but it's covered that's all those that's
[59:36] all those Bloods of the bulls and ghosts
[59:38] the animals that's all it did was cover
[59:40] that amen so they were able to to
[59:43] operate in God's presence because that
[59:46] was acceptable to God at that time
[59:48] knowing that Genesis 3 21 was to be
[59:52] fulfilled in its completeness through
[59:54] Jesus Christ
[59:55] knowing that the scripture we're about
[59:57] to read was going to be fulfilled in
[1:00:00] this fullness through Jesus Christ
[1:00:01] knowing that we see this as the blood
[1:00:04] speaking
[1:00:06] amen gave a more excellent uh voice
[1:00:10] before God
[1:00:12] just like that voice speaking let's look
[1:00:15] in Hebrews
[1:00:18] all the way back over in Hebrews now the
[1:00:21] 12th chapter
[1:00:26] Hebrews 12 24.
[1:00:31] amen would skip ahead just a little bit
[1:00:33] but we'll go back
[1:00:36] and to Hebrews 12 24 now and to Jesus to
[1:00:42] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:00:45] and to the blood of sprinkling amen back
[1:00:49] in Moses time and
[1:00:52] and that spit that speaketh better
[1:00:55] things than that of Abel
[1:00:58] as Abel's voice was speaking through the
[1:01:02] blood
[1:01:03] it spoke through the sprinkling of the
[1:01:06] blood of the of the animals and Moses
[1:01:08] and it spoke
[1:01:10] before God not to the same capacity
[1:01:13] because again it just spoke as animal
[1:01:17] life not human life
[1:01:19] but it was it was laid before God
[1:01:22] because God required that and it was
[1:01:25] accepted by God
[1:01:27] that the animal once it sacrifice that
[1:01:30] that life and that that innocent life in
[1:01:32] that blood once that qualification was
[1:01:34] met was to God
[1:01:37] acceptable it made it acceptable to God
[1:01:40] but now
[1:01:41] notice even in Hebrews it speaks of the
[1:01:45] blood of Abel speaking but that the
[1:01:48] blood of Jesus Christ spoke better
[1:01:51] things even than that let's go over to
[1:01:54] Exodus now
[1:01:58] Exodus chapter 12.
[1:02:02] continuing on with the foreshadowing
[1:02:08] and we'll we'll probably finish with
[1:02:10] this
[1:02:13] Exodus 12 we all know the Paschal Lamb
[1:02:17] Passover Lamb
[1:02:18] Exodus 12 1 and the Lord spake unto
[1:02:21] Moses
[1:02:22] and Aaron in the land of Egypt now
[1:02:25] notice of course this was the time that
[1:02:27] all the plagues were happening and
[1:02:30] Pharaoh's hardened heart would not let
[1:02:31] his children go and God wants to set
[1:02:35] apart
[1:02:36] now remember
[1:02:38] this last play the killing off of the
[1:02:41] firstborn death
[1:02:42] death
[1:02:43] when the death angel was to come through
[1:02:47] there was a purpose behind it
[1:02:50] people would look you'd see people today
[1:02:52] they would they would completely throw
[1:02:55] this away because that's just cruel
[1:02:58] why would an almighty God
[1:03:01] take all the firstborn of Egypt and kill
[1:03:03] them
[1:03:06] people can't because they don't
[1:03:07] understand the revelations
[1:03:09] they don't get the truth behind Christ
[1:03:12] the the word to be able to realize who
[1:03:16] he is
[1:03:17] amen by the revelation of the word the
[1:03:20] spirit speaks to us to understand what
[1:03:23] what God was doing
[1:03:25] amen see God life is precious to God
[1:03:29] but God knows there's like a lot of
[1:03:32] people don't know or forget about that
[1:03:35] there's far greater Beyond this realm
[1:03:38] that we have that we don't know
[1:03:41] this is this life is just a temporal
[1:03:43] life it's just a this our human life is
[1:03:46] just a temporal life it it's here today
[1:03:48] gone tomorrow the Bible tells our human
[1:03:50] life was like a vapor
[1:03:52] you ever watched a vapor come up I used
[1:03:55] to when I was a kid I level up my mom's
[1:03:57] stove and I can remember Vapors coming
[1:03:59] off of stuff she was cooking it would
[1:04:01] just come up and poof and it's gone it
[1:04:03] was it was just not much more than a
[1:04:05] couple of seconds at most now that's
[1:04:07] what the Bible Likens Our Lives to like
[1:04:09] a vapor God knows there's way far more
[1:04:12] than what this life gives
[1:04:14] so they would throw it out all together
[1:04:16] but but it wasn't simply that
[1:04:21] God was I actually was going to show his
[1:04:25] glory
[1:04:26] but he was going to once and for all
[1:04:28] prove to the Egyptians and those that
[1:04:32] heard around
[1:04:33] that God set apart
[1:04:36] the difference between the Egyptians and
[1:04:39] the Israelites
[1:04:41] God's making sure that they know there's
[1:04:44] a difference between you and them
[1:04:47] and see that's what a lot of Christian
[1:04:49] World wants you to think today that
[1:04:51] we're just all the same friend we're not
[1:04:53] all the same
[1:04:55] and that's not arrogance that's just
[1:04:57] truth
[1:04:58] God sets his people aside from the rest
[1:05:01] of the world
[1:05:03] that's why you look different sound
[1:05:05] different act different that's why we're
[1:05:07] different all together because we're
[1:05:09] separate from the world
[1:05:11] amen we're not ashamed of Our Testimony
[1:05:14] we're not ashamed of Jesus Christ we
[1:05:17] want the world to know who we are
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:22] I speaking to the Lord this morning I
[1:05:24] said God
[1:05:25] I just want to be able to work for you
[1:05:29] I said I want I want those guys on my
[1:05:32] crew to understand why I am the way I am
[1:05:35] yeah why I talk the way I talk why I
[1:05:38] don't do some things that they do why I
[1:05:41] work the way that I work because it's
[1:05:43] not for them it's for you
[1:05:46] I'm not like them
[1:05:48] I want them to become like me but I'm
[1:05:51] not like we're not like the world we're
[1:05:53] not a part of the world God purposely
[1:05:57] caused this to separate the Hebrews from
[1:06:01] the Israelites or the Egyptians from the
[1:06:04] Israelites once and for all
[1:06:07] and that's what this is about
[1:06:09] amen this sets them apart from the world
[1:06:13] it set them apart from everyone else
[1:06:16] that they belong to God
[1:06:20] your life sets you apart from everything
[1:06:24] else from everybody else
[1:06:26] because you're different
[1:06:28] because you belong to him you're part of
[1:06:31] his family
[1:06:33] and he wants the world to know it
[1:06:35] amen and they might not understand it
[1:06:38] but they know that there's something
[1:06:39] different
[1:06:41] and as long as you have time like I have
[1:06:44] to let people know well this is why I do
[1:06:47] this
[1:06:48] this is why I don't do this this is why
[1:06:51] I act this this why uh I'm like this
[1:06:54] because this is who I am
[1:06:56] I'm here to honor and to represent my
[1:06:59] Lord and Savior I want my life to rest
[1:07:02] to reflect him
[1:07:04] that sets you apart
[1:07:06] and more so every day that this that
[1:07:08] that clock ticks every second that clock
[1:07:11] ticks back you are more
[1:07:14] dislike unlike the world every day yeah
[1:07:18] yeah amen every day every second that
[1:07:21] ticks on that clock you're more
[1:07:23] different now than you were when you
[1:07:25] walked in this building this morning
[1:07:26] from the world that's how vastly quickly
[1:07:29] the world's changing and devolving
[1:07:33] amen not evolving devolving amen but
[1:07:37] this this is setting them apart amen and
[1:07:41] God tells them you go read the rest of
[1:07:43] the story God tells them this is going
[1:07:45] to be that that sets you apart
[1:07:47] this is the time that they'll know amen
[1:07:50] that you have been called you're not a
[1:07:52] part of them see because they lived
[1:07:54] there for 400 years
[1:07:56] they let the the Israelites say the
[1:07:58] Hebrews they lived in Egypt for over 400
[1:08:01] years
[1:08:02] our friend you live in a place 400 years
[1:08:04] it's easy to to
[1:08:07] start doing their customs and things
[1:08:09] like that become a part of their economy
[1:08:11] and such
[1:08:13] but God wanted them to know you are not
[1:08:15] like them you're not all parts and we're
[1:08:18] in this world we're just not of this
[1:08:20] world
[1:08:22] amen we we account we uh
[1:08:29] assimilate to the world
[1:08:31] and the fact that we operate here we go
[1:08:35] to restaurants and supermarkets and have
[1:08:36] jobs and we trade money for goods and
[1:08:39] things like that we assimilate but we're
[1:08:41] not of the world
[1:08:42] we're not like the world amen
[1:08:45] this is God separating them setting them
[1:08:48] apart amen again go read you consume for
[1:08:51] yourself and the Lord's speaking to
[1:08:53] Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[1:08:55] saying this month shall be unto you the
[1:08:57] beginning of months it was April which
[1:08:59] we know April was the beginning of their
[1:09:01] calendar
[1:09:02] the beginning of months it shall be the
[1:09:04] first month of the year to you
[1:09:08] speak ye unto all the congregation of
[1:09:11] Israel saying in the tenth day of this
[1:09:14] month they shall take of them every man
[1:09:17] a lamb according to the house of their
[1:09:20] fathers a lamb for a house
[1:09:24] amen which signify
[1:09:27] now we can go and it says and if the
[1:09:29] household be too little for the lamb let
[1:09:31] him and his neighbor next unto his house
[1:09:33] take it according to the number of Souls
[1:09:36] every man according to his eating shall
[1:09:40] make your account for the lamb now each
[1:09:44] each home each family even with the
[1:09:48] neighbors
[1:09:50] one lamb was sufficient for the whole
[1:09:53] family
[1:09:54] one lamb
[1:09:56] you didn't have to kill a bunch
[1:09:58] but one lamb was sufficient for the
[1:10:00] whole family
[1:10:01] and says let me tell you one sacrificial
[1:10:05] innocent lamb Jesus Christ was
[1:10:07] sufficient for the entire family of God
[1:10:11] it only took one
[1:10:13] you don't have to have more people try
[1:10:15] to
[1:10:16] go crucify themselves or people crucify
[1:10:19] them it only took one one lamb for the
[1:10:22] entire family of God is all it took amen
[1:10:25] and they took it now let's keep reading
[1:10:28] your lamb shall be without blemish a
[1:10:32] male of the first year ye shall take it
[1:10:34] out from the sheep or the goats and ye
[1:10:37] shall keep it up until the 14th day of
[1:10:39] the same month and the whole assembly of
[1:10:42] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[1:10:44] in the evening time now
[1:10:47] notice it was taken out on the 10th day
[1:10:50] and it was kept up till the 14th day
[1:10:54] that gives four days for this lamb to be
[1:10:58] tested
[1:10:59] to make ensure that there's no
[1:11:01] impediments that there's that there's no
[1:11:04] scars there's nothing wrong with this
[1:11:07] lamb that was about to be sacrificed it
[1:11:09] had to be without blemish had to be pure
[1:11:12] for four days they made sure that that
[1:11:15] lamb was sufficient to meet the
[1:11:17] requirements for the sacrifice that's
[1:11:20] God's requirements under the law that
[1:11:23] was God's requirements now Jesus Christ
[1:11:26] Ministry was three and a half years
[1:11:29] almost four years that Jesus Christ was
[1:11:33] before the public
[1:11:34] his life being tested people ridiculing
[1:11:38] him making fun of him wanting to kill
[1:11:41] him everything they did to Jesus he was
[1:11:44] tested he was tried he was tempted above
[1:11:47] every temptation to make sure that they
[1:11:50] found that this ultimate sacrifice of
[1:11:53] ours was pure
[1:11:55] was without blemish
[1:11:58] was holy
[1:11:59] and Jesus Christ meant that criteria
[1:12:02] he met the criteria even being bombarded
[1:12:05] with every Temptation that a human could
[1:12:07] face
[1:12:08] whatever Jesus went through in life he
[1:12:11] overcame and the three and a half years
[1:12:14] almost four years of his ministry proved
[1:12:17] that this lamb was sufficient for the
[1:12:20] sacrifice he was able to meet that
[1:12:23] sacrifice amen and that sacrifice now
[1:12:27] was to be killed in the evening time
[1:12:31] just like Christ was
[1:12:33] amen and remember
[1:12:35] the evening time light
[1:12:38] is the light that we live in today amen
[1:12:41] the evening time light
[1:12:44] excuse me
[1:12:46] but the evening time light began at
[1:12:50] Jesus death
[1:12:52] because remember when Peter came
[1:12:56] out on the day of Pentecost he said this
[1:13:00] what you have witnessed is that that was
[1:13:02] prophesied by Joel that in the
[1:13:06] last days
[1:13:09] what is the last days that's the evening
[1:13:11] time that's the end of it
[1:13:14] in the last days you will see my spirit
[1:13:17] poured out upon All Flesh and what
[1:13:20] you're witnessing is that fulfillment of
[1:13:22] that scripture in the last days that
[1:13:26] evening time light now for the Gentile
[1:13:30] that began the Gentiles birth right
[1:13:32] there amen and now as the Gentiles go we
[1:13:36] are living in an end time light our
[1:13:38] income light is right now for the
[1:13:41] Gentile the time at hand was at the
[1:13:44] evening time in the last days remember a
[1:13:47] thousand years is one day with the Lord
[1:13:49] So when you say that Peter said in the
[1:13:52] last days of quoting Joel that's exactly
[1:13:55] right yeah
[1:13:56] yeah one day is a thousand years two
[1:13:58] days two thousand years and what's it
[1:14:00] been approximately two thousand years
[1:14:02] days plural
[1:14:04] these last days amen now that Spirit was
[1:14:08] bound it was loosed on the day of
[1:14:10] Pentecost and the spirit moved among the
[1:14:14] people and began to cause people to come
[1:14:16] to Christ and to become Christians
[1:14:19] but you'll notice something happened
[1:14:20] we'll get to in just a minute
[1:14:22] but let me read let me read some more of
[1:14:24] this and then we'll we'll go to that
[1:14:26] because I want to change over scriptures
[1:14:27] but I want to do it after we have
[1:14:30] finished this amen so keep in your mind
[1:14:32] that evening time light there was to be
[1:14:35] killed in the evening time
[1:14:37] look and they shall take of the blood
[1:14:40] and strike it on the two side posts on
[1:14:43] the upper door post of the house wherein
[1:14:45] they shall eat it notice they were not
[1:14:48] only to take the lamb and kill it but
[1:14:51] they were to ingest it
[1:14:54] they were to eat it
[1:14:56] they were they were to allow this
[1:14:59] sacrifice
[1:15:01] to come in them
[1:15:03] so that that sacrifice became a part of
[1:15:06] them we all know you are what you eat
[1:15:09] I mean I've heard that all my life
[1:15:11] every time I put a ding dong in my mouth
[1:15:16] you are what you eat so
[1:15:18] it actually is true you you become what
[1:15:22] you ingest
[1:15:24] God told them in just this
[1:15:29] eat it just like he told John eat the
[1:15:34] book
[1:15:35] amen foreshadowing
[1:15:37] praise God you see
[1:15:39] foreshadowing what God was going to go
[1:15:42] was going to do down the road as God
[1:15:45] continued to uphold himself oh it's so
[1:15:47] beautiful thanks we just see God told
[1:15:50] him to eat now before he never told them
[1:15:53] that
[1:15:54] when when it doesn't say anything about
[1:15:56] Abel eating his sacrifice doesn't say
[1:15:59] anything about Adam when they offer
[1:16:01] doesn't say anything about Jesus he just
[1:16:03] gave them the sheepskin but here he
[1:16:07] tells them the Passover the Paschal Lamb
[1:16:10] Passover our communion
[1:16:12] to eat it praise God that's why we are
[1:16:16] taking a representation at the communion
[1:16:19] table a representation of the body of
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ to take it into ourselves
[1:16:25] as a symbol that we've taken on his word
[1:16:28] we've ingested we've taken in Christ
[1:16:31] he's become our life he is who we are
[1:16:36] now amen
[1:16:37] it's just simple Saints look
[1:16:41] they were to eat it
[1:16:43] ingest this lamb become a part of it
[1:16:46] they were to put the blood on the
[1:16:49] doorposts The Little Disciples the top
[1:16:51] post what did that do for them
[1:16:54] anybody that walked by the house and saw
[1:16:57] that blood knew who they were
[1:17:00] they were identified by the Sacrifice by
[1:17:03] the blood the blood identified that that
[1:17:05] house stood for God
[1:17:08] that they were Hebrews that they were
[1:17:10] Believers that blood stood for behind
[1:17:13] that door belongs God's Property
[1:17:17] and anybody that walked by could see it
[1:17:20] they could recognize it oh that's blood
[1:17:22] that'd probably make fun of it laugh at
[1:17:25] it put it down a bunch of idiots or
[1:17:27] Hypocrites whatever they want to call
[1:17:28] and do the same thing today they look at
[1:17:31] you how silly how stupid why would you
[1:17:33] look like that why would you dress like
[1:17:34] that amen and do the same thing today
[1:17:37] you identified it's identifying because
[1:17:40] see your token today must be on display
[1:17:42] just as their token was on display
[1:17:45] their token was on display I identified
[1:17:48] whoever's behind that door now if you
[1:17:50] aren't behind that door you were you
[1:17:52] were a pro a product of the curse what
[1:17:55] was the curse death
[1:17:57] the only place death did not strike was
[1:18:01] behind the blood
[1:18:03] as the only place death did not touch
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:06] the only place death that could not
[1:18:09] reach was behind that token
[1:18:11] it's the only place he couldn't get to
[1:18:14] everybody behind that token was safe
[1:18:18] praise the Lord everybody that was that
[1:18:21] had the identification of that blood was
[1:18:24] saved even the firstborn
[1:18:27] because notice the firstborn
[1:18:30] the firstborn curse wasn't just for the
[1:18:33] Egyptians it was just a curse
[1:18:36] yes amen
[1:18:39] it was just a curse look at it today's
[1:18:41] things look at the curses that's hitting
[1:18:44] the world today are you a part of them
[1:18:47] absolutely not why because you had the
[1:18:49] inoculation
[1:18:51] you're behind the blood you have the
[1:18:53] Holy Spirit you have the life of God
[1:18:55] Christ Living in you you've been
[1:18:57] inoculated from whatever going to happen
[1:18:59] in this world well they were too the
[1:19:02] curse was for all of them but God
[1:19:05] separated them by putting them behind
[1:19:08] the token
[1:19:09] by putting them behind the blood
[1:19:12] amen now the rest of them can make fun
[1:19:15] and laugh at them but that's the only
[1:19:17] place where the death did not strike
[1:19:19] amen oh praise God Saint you see it
[1:19:23] that's where God that's no wonder
[1:19:25] Brothers could say if you've been
[1:19:26] inoculated you don't have to worry about
[1:19:28] these things that the father hit this
[1:19:29] Earth
[1:19:30] people word to death about this that and
[1:19:32] the other friends if you are inoculated
[1:19:34] the Holy Ghost you've been born again
[1:19:36] you are exempt from the things it's
[1:19:38] about to hit this world
[1:19:40] amen God has set you aside he has
[1:19:43] brought you out and showed that you are
[1:19:46] different that you belong to him that
[1:19:49] you are a part of the family of God and
[1:19:51] your token is on display and people may
[1:19:54] laugh at you make fun of you think how
[1:19:56] silly you are
[1:19:58] but that's the only place that death
[1:20:00] won't strike
[1:20:02] amen now physical death May strike your
[1:20:05] body oh absolutely but we're talking
[1:20:08] about a spiritual death
[1:20:10] amen because when you enter from the
[1:20:13] physical into the spiritual that
[1:20:15] identifies Who You Are
[1:20:17] because you are not spiritually dead you
[1:20:21] are where Spirit lives
[1:20:22] you are the world's looking for Revival
[1:20:25] I steer here today after that school and
[1:20:28] and that's wonderful I'm glad it will
[1:20:30] happen at that school that was just
[1:20:32] tremendous uh it ended and I I see
[1:20:35] there's a new Jesus movie and whatever
[1:20:38] there's been several of them that's
[1:20:39] wonderful anybody that can learn about
[1:20:42] Jesus that is great uh
[1:20:45] but there's there's only one thing that
[1:20:48] sets God's family apart from the rest of
[1:20:51] the world
[1:20:52] and that's the blood
[1:20:54] that's the life that's the spirit that
[1:20:58] Holy Spirit that has come back and live
[1:21:01] in you amen it's the only thing that
[1:21:02] separates you remember the only thing
[1:21:05] that separated the wise version from the
[1:21:07] foolish virgin
[1:21:09] was oil
[1:21:11] amen the oil in their lamps that kept
[1:21:15] them burning was the only thing that
[1:21:17] differentiated the two of them
[1:21:20] God's setting them apart again here
[1:21:23] saving them apart helping them to see
[1:21:26] they're separate from the rest of the
[1:21:27] world
[1:21:29] Age first they shall eat in the flesh
[1:21:31] that uh that night they shall eat at the
[1:21:34] eat of the Flesh in that night roast
[1:21:36] with fire unleavened bread with bitter
[1:21:38] herbs they shall eat it eat not of it
[1:21:40] raw nor sought it all with water but
[1:21:42] roast with fire his head with his legs
[1:21:45] and with his pertinence thereof in fact
[1:21:47] nothing goes to waste
[1:21:49] nothing was to be wasted head legs
[1:21:52] pertinence everything in the middle the
[1:21:54] hand the legs and everything in the
[1:21:55] middle faces what it's saying
[1:21:58] and ye shall let nothing of it remain
[1:22:00] until the morning and that which remain
[1:22:02] into the morning ye shall burn with fire
[1:22:04] this while we have the
[1:22:07] remaining of the communion bread burned
[1:22:09] Amen brother Pat unfortunately it has
[1:22:11] that big fire pit that he has he takes
[1:22:14] and does that for us praise the Lord and
[1:22:16] thankful for it uh to burn amen and thus
[1:22:20] shall ye eat in it with your loins
[1:22:22] girded your shoes on your feet and
[1:22:24] you're stabbed in your hand and ye shall
[1:22:25] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[1:22:27] Passover always ready Always In Action
[1:22:30] always eat it ready to move
[1:22:33] partake of it ready to be in action for
[1:22:36] the Lord ready to do for the Lord what
[1:22:38] he would have us do now notice they ate
[1:22:41] this before I go to this last one uh
[1:22:44] because oh boy there's two more points I
[1:22:47] want to make
[1:22:48] before we get to that
[1:22:49] they ate
[1:22:52] one lamb was sufficient for the whole
[1:22:54] house but there was to be no waste
[1:22:57] noticed there was to be no waste
[1:23:00] anything that happened to be left over
[1:23:03] because it was supposed to take a lamb
[1:23:05] according to the number of people and
[1:23:07] that person's appetite
[1:23:09] you notice what they said when he read
[1:23:11] it according to each person's eating
[1:23:14] see every man according to his eating
[1:23:17] shall you make account for the lamb
[1:23:21] amen I I know a lot of times when I'm in
[1:23:24] big big group of people we order a pizza
[1:23:26] with so how many pieces will you eat
[1:23:27] I'll eat one oh I'll eat five oh I'll
[1:23:30] eat two and what do you do you say five
[1:23:33] four two one you add it up so okay it
[1:23:35] should take two pizzas
[1:23:37] it's that simple each man according to
[1:23:39] their appetite or eating so that there
[1:23:41] was to be no waste
[1:23:43] amen there was to be no waste and every
[1:23:46] bit of that sacrifice was to be was to
[1:23:49] be consumed now if there was any of it
[1:23:51] that was left over it was to be burned
[1:23:54] by fire remember now notice as we get to
[1:23:58] this it had to be an innocent lamb I'm
[1:24:00] going to do the uh we'll do the evening
[1:24:03] time in just a minute
[1:24:06] um
[1:24:07] actually I may just have to do that next
[1:24:08] time
[1:24:10] um well let's go over to uh
[1:24:13] uh
[1:24:15] Matthew
[1:24:17] let's go to the Book of Matthew
[1:24:26] and notice
[1:24:29] the sacrifice was kept up this would be
[1:24:31] the last part I get to today
[1:24:33] the sacrifice had to be kept up for four
[1:24:35] days
[1:24:36] you may remember Jesus Christ his
[1:24:39] ministry three and a half years
[1:24:41] tested tried
[1:24:44] proven
[1:24:45] the Bible says tempted above all
[1:24:47] temptation does it not say that
[1:24:49] amen Jesus tested that lamb that perfect
[1:24:53] sacrifice was tested and tried
[1:24:57] and at the end of his life
[1:25:00] we have Matthew 27.
[1:25:03] let's look at the witnesses
[1:25:06] at the end of his life now I am not
[1:25:09] going to give you a witness of any of
[1:25:13] the 11 just leftover disciples
[1:25:16] but a people that weren't even Jews
[1:25:19] really except for one believers
[1:25:22] his disciples look at the witnesses
[1:25:25] let's go Matthew 27
[1:25:28] uh let's start with verses three or four
[1:25:31] all of them are in Matthew 27. all of
[1:25:34] the things I want to witness to you here
[1:25:36] about Jesus Christ in Matthew 27 3 and 4
[1:25:40] Judas is carry it
[1:25:42] then Judas which had betrayed him when
[1:25:46] he saw that he was condemned repented
[1:25:49] himself
[1:25:50] and brought again the 30 pieces of
[1:25:53] silver to the chief priests and elders
[1:25:56] saying I have sinned and that I have
[1:25:59] betrayed the innocent blood
[1:26:04] innocent blood
[1:26:06] and they said what is that to us see
[1:26:09] thou to it now he was at one time of
[1:26:12] course one of the Twelve Disciples he
[1:26:14] was there with them justification
[1:26:16] sanctification he was there when they
[1:26:19] went forth to heal the sick and to raise
[1:26:21] the dead and and the Miracles that took
[1:26:23] place he was he was the one when God
[1:26:25] Matthew 10 God gave him power to go
[1:26:27] forth and do he was one right there but
[1:26:30] we know he sold his he sold Christ out
[1:26:33] and what did he identify now
[1:26:36] to them of course they couldn't care
[1:26:38] less it didn't mean anything to them
[1:26:42] that that he was innocent or not because
[1:26:44] they had already judged him and
[1:26:46] according to their judgment he was
[1:26:48] guilty
[1:26:49] but Judas last judgment of Jesus Christ
[1:26:53] was innocent blood
[1:26:56] I have
[1:26:58] betrayed innocent blood
[1:27:02] now let's look on down in Saint 27 19.
[1:27:08] Matthew 27 19.
[1:27:12] when he was set down on the on the
[1:27:15] Judgment seat Pilate his wife sent unto
[1:27:18] him saying have nothing to do with that
[1:27:22] just man
[1:27:24] and this woman didn't even know him
[1:27:27] but she was warned in a dream
[1:27:30] God spoke to it in a dream
[1:27:32] she went to her husband and said pilate
[1:27:34] don't you dare have anything to do with
[1:27:36] this just man
[1:27:39] notice where's the testimony coming from
[1:27:41] it's not coming from the high priest
[1:27:44] it's not even coming from Peter or or
[1:27:47] Bartholomew it's not even coming from
[1:27:49] his disciples
[1:27:51] it's coming from the life of the man
[1:27:53] that was about to sentence him to death
[1:27:56] have nothing to do with this innocent
[1:27:59] man again the testimony this man is an
[1:28:03] innocent man
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:06] have nothing to do with this just man
[1:28:08] I've suffered many things this day in a
[1:28:10] dream because of now look what pilate
[1:28:12] said verse 24.
[1:28:14] when pilate saw that he could Prevail
[1:28:17] nothing
[1:28:18] but that rather a torment or a uproar uh
[1:28:22] sort of like or peaceful protests are
[1:28:25] today an uproar
[1:28:27] uh uh was made he took water and washed
[1:28:32] his hands before the multitude saying I
[1:28:35] am innocent of the blood of this
[1:28:38] just person
[1:28:40] see you do it now not only from
[1:28:46] Judas
[1:28:48] then Pilot's Wife
[1:28:50] now Pilate is calling this a this man a
[1:28:54] just person
[1:28:55] what are they doing with their own
[1:28:58] voices
[1:29:00] they're justifying
[1:29:04] Jesus Christ
[1:29:06] the innocent lamb the Paschal Lamb as
[1:29:09] the sacrifice that he was about to
[1:29:11] become
[1:29:13] this man's innocent
[1:29:15] this man is just this man had done
[1:29:17] nothing wrong
[1:29:19] amen just like he was supposed to be
[1:29:22] four years now the land was kept up
[1:29:24] three and a half years Jesus with his
[1:29:27] ministry before the people
[1:29:29] made sure he was in a
[1:29:32] minute I got one more
[1:29:34] amen and these aren't the other ones but
[1:29:36] these are the ones that are in Matthew
[1:29:37] 27 54.
[1:29:40] Matthew chapter uh word 27 verse 54.
[1:29:45] now when the Centurion
[1:29:47] and they that were with him watching
[1:29:49] Jesus saw the earthquake and those
[1:29:52] things that were done they feared
[1:29:54] greatly saved truly this was the the Son
[1:29:58] of God right
[1:30:00] amen truly this was the son of God
[1:30:03] identifying him as to who he was
[1:30:06] as to who he is amen innocent
[1:30:11] Jesus Christ just
[1:30:13] Jesus Christ able to be that sacrifice
[1:30:16] no wonder when John was looking around
[1:30:18] with a book that was sealed up and said
[1:30:20] who is able to loose the seals
[1:30:24] Jesus Christ the only one able to walk
[1:30:27] forth and take that book and loose those
[1:30:29] seals and open the book
[1:30:31] amen because nobody else is Worthy
[1:30:34] he was found worthy even by his enemies
[1:30:38] he was found
[1:30:39] no not the high priest and the the the
[1:30:42] the the Jews and the chief priests not
[1:30:45] them no
[1:30:47] amen but by Romans people that weren't
[1:30:50] even Jews see I didn't consider The High
[1:30:53] Priestess in but they were Jews and
[1:30:55] Jesus said I've been sent to the house
[1:30:57] of the of the Israelites I've been sent
[1:31:00] to the family of God I've been sent to
[1:31:01] the Jews The House of the children of
[1:31:03] the House of Israel that's where I've
[1:31:05] been sent Jesus said that himself
[1:31:07] but his enemies the Romans came forward
[1:31:10] this man is innocent this man is just
[1:31:13] surely this man is the son of God
[1:31:17] proving still Jesus Christ held up is
[1:31:21] our sacrifice innocent now
[1:31:24] Lord Willard uh I want to get to this
[1:31:27] evening part-time because
[1:31:30] I I'll be honest with you I never uh not
[1:31:34] that I've lied to you but I'm gonna stop
[1:31:36] that catchphrase uh
[1:31:39] to embellish
[1:31:42] um
[1:31:43] I didn't understand it for a long time
[1:31:46] when brother Branham talked about the
[1:31:49] the the the Holy Spirit not coming until
[1:31:52] the evening time but I want to talk to
[1:31:55] you about that so next time Lord willing
[1:31:56] let's stand if we could we get to the
[1:31:59] identification of that Paschal Lamb now
[1:32:01] when it was killed at the evening time
