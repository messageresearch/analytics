[0:07] work something out for us I had to bring
[0:10] my desktop into the living room because
[0:12] it can't stream using a mobile device
[0:15] because they don't have enough followers
[0:17] I'm not popular enough so maybe if you
[0:19] all click enough likes maybe I'll get
[0:21] enough followers that they'll allow us
[0:23] you have to have a thousand followers to
[0:25] do it on on the phone on a mobile device
[0:28] that's why on my weekly things I have to
[0:31] I have to record it and then send it to
[0:34] Micah then he uploads it so you all can
[0:36] see on on our website if that's those
[0:40] are our lives so doing the life is a
[0:41] little more complicated a little more
[0:43] difficult but thankful to have Micah to

[5:30] Lord now let's this service Lord we have
[5:33] God Lord may you speak to these lips
[5:36] towards you to have us to hear according
[5:38] to your perfect will now as we committed
[5:40] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:41] Christ amen
[5:44] god bless you now there's a something
[5:47] the Lord put on my heart probably a
[5:50] couple weeks ago I actually an issue was
[5:52] going to make it a short little midweek
[5:57] snip at 15-20 minute sermonette if you
[6:00] will but the more I got to study on and
[6:04] the more I got to looking at it the more
[6:05] I felt like that it would be something
[6:07] that would be more for a Sunday so the
[6:11] Lord puts us on my heart to bring today
[6:12] so I want to do this and I want to talk
[6:16] about this role is not our home even
[6:19] this world is not our home sometimes we
[6:21] sort of tend to lose the vision about
[6:24] that there's a particular scripture I
[6:26] want to read in just a moment that kind
[6:29] of highlights that that was the thing
[6:31] that stuck to me that Jesus said that
[6:35] kind of stuck to me because sometimes
[6:37] are sometimes as we spoke last week
[6:39] about vision and keeping our vision on
[6:42] what is spiritual and what is right and
[6:44] and keeping our vision on Jesus and and
[6:47] what we're looking for what we're
[6:50] expecting today and and what we spend
[6:52] our time on and in our emotions on our
[6:55] spirit involved in I mean you know those
[6:58] in my congregation know I'm not much of
[7:01] a modern events preacher and the things
[7:04] that's going on but it's hard to deny
[7:05] and you don't want to nullify the
[7:08] scripture what it says about it but also
[7:11] making sure that we keep our hearts and
[7:14] minds on what is real and what is right
[7:17] and what God wants us to keep our hearts
[7:19] and minds own so I want to go to the
[7:21] scripture now in st. John chapter 6 and
[7:24] just read a couple of verses of
[7:26] Scripture here pardon me out the
[7:32] don't steal my tables not quite high
[7:35] enough so we'll do the best we can so
[7:37] you pardon me for that but st. John
[7:39] chapter six I'm going to begin reading
[7:40] with verse 14 and and just draw a
[7:44] context here if we could remember now
[7:45] titled this is this world is not our
[7:48] home this world cosmos is not our home
[7:52] now this earth is we're going to come
[7:54] back and live here in the millennium and
[7:57] the white of the new heavens new earth
[8:00] the new jerusalem we're going to live
[8:02] here that's going to be right here on
[8:03] this earth but this world is not a home
[8:06] the Satan's eaten is not our home so
[8:10] let's look at this now st. John chapter
[8:12] 6 verse 14 then those men now this is of
[8:16] course the story after Jesus had fed the
[8:18] five thousand and with the loaves and
[8:22] fishes and people saw the miracle and
[8:25] they saw what had happened and the
[8:27] resulting effect of it of course you can
[8:30] read all of our six and see what the
[8:32] resulting effect is but the immediate
[8:34] resulting effect was this 14th verse
[8:37] then wrote then those men when they had
[8:40] seen the miracle that Jesus did said
[8:43] this is of a truth that prophet that
[8:46] should come into the world when Jesus
[8:49] therefore perceived that they would come
[8:52] and take him by force to make him 18 he
[8:57] departed again into a mountain himself
[8:59] alone and notice when they come to make
[9:03] Jesus a king they come by force to take
[9:07] him to try to force him to make him a
[9:10] king which is what what they did the
[9:12] whole time even as they look through the
[9:14] scripture and were and we're living
[9:16] their lives and under the oppression of
[9:18] the Roman government
[9:21] they kept looking for this keen they
[9:22] kept looking for this one to come and
[9:24] and wipe the enemy away and the white
[9:27] the Romans off and is set up on the King
[9:29] ship on the throne and be the King here
[9:33] and and and transform this this world
[9:36] well that wasn't the way it was going to
[9:37] be that was a little bit was supposed to
[9:39] be God has his way of doing it and it's
[9:42] in the scripture if we if we look and
[9:45] read the scripture we try to transform
[9:48] and reform this earth what I hear to do
[9:51] that the children of God the ministers
[9:54] of God the the sons and daughters of God
[9:56] we're not here to change your
[9:58] transformer reform this world we have
[10:01] one responsibility and we'll get to it
[10:03] in just a minute but they wanted to take
[10:05] in making the key
[10:06] why didn't he allow them to do that
[10:08] because it wasn't that time he wasn't
[10:11] here to become king when he's King he's
[10:14] son of David he wasn't here to become
[10:16] king he was here to become a sacrificial
[10:19] lamb that lamb and and to be able to
[10:22] serve that purpose of the sacrificial
[10:24] lamb on her on earth was the reason that
[10:27] Jesus came well if they tried to push
[10:29] him up in a kingship that was going to
[10:31] change the whole picture of everything
[10:33] jesus said I do nothing except the
[10:35] father show me first and what he shows
[10:37] me that's what I'll do amen so so the
[10:41] purpose of Jesus being here was to
[10:44] fulfill the will of the Father it was to
[10:46] fulfill the will of God if it wasn't to
[10:49] fulfill God's will then what was the
[10:51] point of it so if that was his purpose
[10:53] and what is our purpose what is our
[10:56] purpose to be here our purpose is to
[10:58] build some great kingdom here our
[11:00] purpose is to find it to be elected to
[11:03] some political office or something so we
[11:06] can reform everything that's not our job
[11:08] it wasn't Jesus's job then that's why he
[11:11] would let them he was king he's
[11:13] absolutely king but that wasn't why he
[11:16] came he came
[11:18] a sacrifice not as a king so when they
[11:21] come to try to take him as king he ran
[11:24] away
[11:24] he got away from he said he the Bible
[11:27] says he departed to get into the
[11:28] mountains alone and got away from them
[11:30] so they wouldn't do that yes we do Jesus
[11:34] is the key we acknowledge him is that we
[11:37] know that absolutely but that wasn't the
[11:39] purpose he came here realizing this was
[11:43] not his home
[11:44] case in point let's go over to st. John
[11:47] chapter 18 read Saint John chapter 18
[11:51] here we'll begin with verse 33 this is
[11:54] the conversation with Pilate after they
[11:57] delivered Jesus unto Pilate and see
[12:00] Jesus is on words he says here as Pilate
[12:02] is questioning him now we'll go down to
[12:04] st. John 18 we'll go to the thirty
[12:06] thirty third verse thirty third verse
[12:11] yet then Pilate entered into the
[12:13] judgment Hall again and called Jesus and
[12:16] said unto Him art thou the King of the
[12:20] Jews notice the question notice what
[12:24] they tried to do to him not his twelve
[12:27] but the others that were following him
[12:29] if you go and read the rest of Saint
[12:33] John six you'll see his admonishing to
[12:36] them his his is telling them why they
[12:38] were even there they weren't there
[12:39] because they believed they weren't
[12:41] believers but look what they did they
[12:44] tried to make him keen now look what
[12:47] Pilate is saying art thou the King of
[12:50] the Jews because he that was the that
[12:52] was the false witness that was brought
[12:55] against Jesus to try to bring him before
[12:57] Pilate halt to be crucified because it
[13:00] couldn't be a transgression of Jewish
[13:03] law that the Romans would acknowledge it
[13:06] had to be a transgression of Roman law
[13:08] and that Roman law was this man is
[13:11] trying to take over kingship and we
[13:14] don't have any other
[13:15] but you see but so they were able to try
[13:19] to make him in the Romans I look like
[13:22] something he wasn't even trying to
[13:23] portray he wasn't trying to make himself
[13:26] King
[13:26] but look what Pilate said thou art thou
[13:30] King of the Jews
[13:32] jesus answered him say us now this of
[13:35] thyself or do others tell it of thee of
[13:39] me Pilate answered am i a Jew thy own
[13:44] nation and the chief priests have
[13:46] delivered thee unto me what hast thou
[13:49] done jesus answered listen now this is
[13:52] the scripture this is the scripture that
[13:55] that just went over my spirit to to
[13:59] bring this with look what Jesus said now
[14:01] not neglecting Jesus life and everything
[14:05] he manifests to show us but look what he
[14:09] said jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[14:13] this world Wilfred if were Christians
[14:16] then our kingdom is not of this world
[14:19] amen
[14:20] his kingdom was not of this world our
[14:23] kingdom is not of this world if my
[14:25] kingdom were of this world then my
[14:27] servants would fight then what would my
[14:30] servants fight jesus said if this was my
[14:33] kingdom these are my subjects they would
[14:36] fight and he would fight for them he
[14:38] would be there with him but this is not
[14:40] his kingdom if this king of this kingdom
[14:45] if my kingdom were of this world then
[14:48] would my servants fight that I should
[14:50] not be delivered to the Jews but now is
[14:53] but now is my kingdom not from hence
[14:56] Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou
[14:58] a king then jesus answered thou sayest
[15:01] that I am a king to this end was I born
[15:04] to this end end was I born yes he was
[15:09] and to that end was he born but that
[15:12] wasn't the
[15:12] purpose he served while he was here to
[15:15] the end of it yes he is now king of
[15:17] kings and Lord of lords did this end was
[15:19] I born for this cause I came into the
[15:21] world that I should bear witness unto
[15:23] the truth everyone that is of the truth
[15:26] hears my voice now what is that truth
[15:28] what is that truth we know that Jesus is
[15:32] the truth the truth is not a theme the
[15:35] truth is a person Jesus is the truth he
[15:38] said he was the way the truth the life
[15:41] with Jesus was the way the truth the
[15:44] life if he's that truth then he's the
[15:47] one to come and reveal that truth to his
[15:50] own people his he came for that purpose
[15:53] not to be a king of this world not to
[15:56] set up his kingdom in this world in this
[15:59] Satan's Eden remember last week we
[16:02] talked about how Jesus blood the water
[16:05] bathed the earth and Jesus blood dropped
[16:07] on it there's going to be a fiery
[16:08] baptism that blood redeemed this earth
[16:12] back to God it belongs to God now we're
[16:14] still in the middle of Satan's Eden but
[16:15] this earth belongs to God now he's going
[16:18] to take full control over it and that's
[16:19] exactly what he's doing now all this
[16:21] that we see and all this going on in the
[16:23] motion now is running it to that point
[16:26] but this is not our home this world is
[16:29] not our cosmos
[16:30] jesus said if this was my kingdom if
[16:32] this world was my home if this was what
[16:37] I came for then my servants would fight
[16:40] they would fight that I wouldn't be
[16:43] brought into the hands of the Jews
[16:45] but he's not the king of this world well
[16:48] that this world is not his home then
[16:51] this world can't be our home Jesus kept
[16:55] the purpose the perfect focus how do we
[16:59] would desire so and
[17:01] admittedly since it's hard yeah I love
[17:04] this country I love people I don't want
[17:07] to see anybody go to hell I don't want
[17:08] to see anything detrimental happen to
[17:10] anybody I don't want to see one person
[17:12] diaper on a virus but it's just it's
[17:15] inevitable the scripture tells us that
[17:18] not all are going to come to repentance
[17:20] so we know that but it I understand how
[17:24] it hurts I understand how hard it is to
[17:26] watch our beautiful country just in the
[17:29] past 50-plus years I've been alive go
[17:32] from what it was even the beaver cleaver
[17:34] days to what it is now and how far has
[17:38] slidden how far that's gone and how how
[17:42] the degradation of this world it used to
[17:46] be that my saying was that they they try
[17:48] to patch things up in this world by
[17:50] putting a band-aid on a broke it even
[17:53] that anymore
[17:53] I don't even think that they they try to
[17:58] cure cancer with a breath of air or
[18:02] something or with mercurochrome you you
[18:07] most people don't know but some of you
[18:09] might know what that is that's what my
[18:10] mom always put on me when I had a scrape
[18:12] wasn't mercurochrome you can't cure
[18:15] cancer with that it doesn't work that
[18:17] way but I always said if it seemed like
[18:20] her felt like that they tried to that
[18:22] they're trying to make things better
[18:24] with with taking God out of it the big
[18:30] push now on this coronavirus thing is
[18:32] that we have to rely on and depend on
[18:36] the one thing that's going to work the
[18:38] one thing that is true the one thing is
[18:40] sure and that is science what a lot of
[18:44] the devil and there there's nothing more
[18:47] imperfect than science the only thing
[18:50] that is perfect and the only thing
[18:52] that's reliable the only thing you can
[18:54] depend on is God period there is no
[18:58] question there is no determining of that
[19:01] but you know even the disciples didn't
[19:06] understand it when they were here Jesus
[19:09] talked about it and and and we just read
[19:11] that and and and what he said about that
[19:13] and in he he knew he kept his vision
[19:16] right but but even his disciples even
[19:19] the ones that were followed they didn't
[19:21] understand that I think it's probably a
[19:22] lot been the way it was and brother
[19:24] Branham was here and maybe even still
[19:26] some now with brother Branham and it
[19:29] just understand the purpose the reason
[19:33] that the fulfillment and what it was
[19:35] about even Peter look even Peter when
[19:39] they come to take Jesus even Peter drew
[19:41] a sword and cut off one of the high
[19:43] priests servant Sears could is right
[19:45] there off Jesus had to take and heal the
[19:48] man right there supernaturally had to
[19:50] heal the man right there because Peter
[19:53] even thought he himself God's disciple
[19:56] took a sort of think oh that's what
[19:59] we're gonna do with it we're gonna we're
[20:01] gonna take it by force and he cut the
[20:02] man's ear off but that wasn't why it was
[20:05] here so many times we try to do the same
[20:08] thing and we try to go the same way but
[20:10] you know Jesus told him he said if you
[20:13] live by the sword
[20:14] you'll die by the sword that's not the
[20:17] purpose we want to fulfill here that's
[20:19] not what we want to do going back to the
[20:22] midweek thought you know keep her vision
[20:24] keep her fall in line in the right way
[20:27] this world is not her home look let's
[20:29] continue to go on and build with this in
[20:31] a in Shepherd of the sheep fold in 1956
[20:35] Rev Anne said it that's the way the
[20:38] human race is we are absolutely totally
[20:40] helpless without the Shepherd of the
[20:43] fold now the world doesn't understand
[20:46] that the world doesn't see that the
[20:48] world cosmos World Order I'm not talking
[20:51] about everybody but the world in general
[20:53] the Cosmo does not see that they don't
[20:55] acknowledge or understand that but we do
[20:58] Christians we do the ones that
[21:01] understand
[21:02] and are in the position of recognizing
[21:04] what our place is here why not put us
[21:07] here
[21:08] we're helpless without the Shepherd of
[21:11] the fold we can't find our way back look
[21:14] now he's talking about humanity and
[21:16] humanity trying to find its way back to
[21:19] where it fell from in the beginning in
[21:21] the Garden of Eden how do we get back to
[21:24] that place he said we've tried to
[21:26] educate our way back we've tried to
[21:28] reform our way back but we'll never be
[21:31] able we'll never do it
[21:34] Reformation we'll never do it he said
[21:36] we're not reformers the police out here
[21:39] are reformers weren't preachers of the
[21:41] gospel reformers around here to take
[21:44] care of the laws even another what he
[21:47] talked about you know someone does
[21:50] something wrong or a murder or something
[21:51] he said that's not our business the cops
[21:54] take care of that then the Reformers
[21:55] they're the ones to take care that thing
[21:57] that's not our job that's not our place
[22:00] I place that our job is to preach the
[22:02] gospel that's why God put us here to
[22:05] preach the gospel Jesus was here to do
[22:08] the will of the Father when the will of
[22:10] the father was finished God took him I
[22:12] can't think of a better life but we get
[22:16] all these other things going on in life
[22:18] and marriages and families and children
[22:20] and the grandchildren and homes and you
[22:22] know we have a lot of the things of the
[22:24] world water earthly Goods and things
[22:27] that we enjoy in the pleasures that God
[22:28] gives us and we're thankful for that
[22:30] but none of that should be something
[22:32] that holds us or grips us to the place
[22:35] that we lose the purpose of being here
[22:38] and that's to be ministers of the gospel
[22:40] not just me standing here today you all
[22:42] know that a minister of the gospel is
[22:45] someone that is born again has filled
[22:47] the Spirit of God and upholds the
[22:48] righteous and holiness of the Word of
[22:50] God and ministers their life to other
[22:53] people as they go around the world hard
[22:55] to do now
[22:56] he's supposed to stay at home all day
[22:57] but still it's a life it's something
[23:01] that's eating you not on you it's
[23:04] something that comes out of you not into
[23:06] you it's something that you just you you
[23:09] live because it's who you are to preach
[23:11] the gospel
[23:12] we are preachers of the gospel not to
[23:16] try to put people on penalty crawl on
[23:18] your knees so forth there's nothing that
[23:21] we can do there's no dependence or
[23:22] nothing that we can do to inherit
[23:24] Goddard or life in daughter the life of
[23:28] Jesus Christ
[23:29] put penalty crawl on your knees so forth
[23:32] but to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ
[23:35] deliverance to the people that's what
[23:38] the Shepherds are supposed to do to feed
[23:41] the sheep as Peter as he as he talked to
[23:44] Peter and Saint John chapter one Amen
[23:47] lovest thou me me more than these feed
[23:50] my sheep feed my lambs
[23:51] well the ministering of the gospel is
[23:53] what God's called us here for we come
[23:56] into this world we do God's will and
[23:59] when God will is done in our lives it's
[24:01] time to go home again what a greater
[24:04] life to live then to come born and live
[24:07] for God and to fulfill the purpose of
[24:10] God has in our lives and then go ahead
[24:12] and then and then God take us home and
[24:16] we're very selfish as humans I still
[24:18] desperately miss my mother I think about
[24:22] her almost every day but that's just me
[24:25] that's just cuz I'm selfish that's just
[24:27] cuz I'm human you know she come here
[24:30] fulfilled the purpose God give her and
[24:32] then he took her home praise the Lord
[24:35] we're gonna be united again one day
[24:37] hopefully believing very soon we're
[24:39] gonna be united again the rest of its
[24:41] just selfish selfishness and humanity on
[24:44] my part but when she but when it's done
[24:47] when it's time to be done and God has
[24:50] finished say God take me
[24:51] it's time to go home at that time if the
[24:54] Lord wants to take us home then it's
[24:56] time to go home
[24:57] it's it's God's a Weedle and purpose in
[25:01] our lives we're just we're just Pilgrims
[25:04] and strangers here what we're just
[25:08] walking around in this earth fulfilling
[25:11] trying to fulfill whatever purpose it is
[25:14] that God's put in our lives now I want
[25:17] to read a couple more scriptures Matthew
[25:18] chapter 13 one verse of scripture will
[25:22] change this over just a bit but still on
[25:24] the same theme in Matthew chapter 13
[25:31] around the wandering one verse verse 22
[25:37] Matthew 13 22 now Jesus talks about the
[25:42] sower and sowing the seed and of course
[25:44] the seed to get some get some out into
[25:46] the world into the earth and but this
[25:50] particular part now the 22nd verse he
[25:54] also that received seed among the thorns
[25:56] is he that heareth the word listen to
[25:59] this now either here at the word and the
[26:01] cares of this world and the
[26:04] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[26:07] out of that person or choke the word and
[26:09] he becometh unfruitful god help us never
[26:13] to be that way god help us never get to
[26:16] that place to where we let the cares of
[26:18] the world the the desire for riches and
[26:22] things like that steal away the purpose
[26:25] that God put us here to keep us from
[26:27] being unfruitful the fruitfulness that
[26:30] God's put in our lives is for a reason
[26:32] and
[26:33] and that's why we're even a year is to
[26:36] fulfill that purpose and and to produce
[26:39] those fruits and understanding that God
[26:42] puts you here to do that purpose and
[26:44] only you can do that purpose that's the
[26:46] reason you're here
[26:47] that's the reason God chose you and so
[26:49] that you could do it and that purpose
[26:51] that God put in you now if we get
[26:53] distracted and we get taken away with
[26:55] the cares of the world the Steep fulness
[26:57] of riches things those things just
[26:59] detract those things just take away from
[27:02] the fund of fundamental foundation of
[27:05] the why God set us here to begin with
[27:07] why are you here to start with see it
[27:09] takes a balance it takes a balance to
[27:12] understand I told you many go
[27:13] it burns me to see where this world is
[27:17] going it burns me to see how far and how
[27:20] low and and and and how bad this country
[27:24] even has just gotten to the morals and
[27:27] the ethics and and all of this this
[27:29] country is just it's just it's not even
[27:32] a semblance of godliness anymore it's
[27:34] not even a semblance of holiness anymore
[27:37] and yeah it hurts I hate to see it and
[27:39] but the way people think and do but
[27:42] there's a balance there's a balance to
[27:45] maintain to be able to take that word
[27:47] and live that and not to become so
[27:50] heavenly bound we're no earthly good
[27:52] because we got to be we got to fulfill
[27:54] the fruitfulness remember the
[27:55] fruitfulness part of it is the part
[27:57] that's here on this earth yes there'll
[28:00] be a part where we play the body change
[28:02] go home and forever be with the Lord but
[28:05] the fruitfulness of the part of it that
[28:07] God had us here it has us here for is in
[28:09] our humanity in this earth in this life
[28:12] and fulfilling the purpose that God give
[28:14] us in this world to do its maintaining
[28:18] that balance and keep
[28:20] things between understanding what we can
[28:24] and should do as members of this society
[28:28] and productive members of this society
[28:31] and and being a child of God if you
[28:35] don't to me a child of God isn't
[28:37] somebody that just need collects to
[28:40] everything on the earth or doesn't care
[28:41] anything about what's going on or not
[28:43] trying to help with souls to Christ I
[28:46] don't believe brother Brandon was that
[28:48] way
[28:48] absolutely not Jesus wasn't that way
[28:51] Jesus walked by and people were were
[28:54] there he healed we don't know who some
[28:57] of those people were saved or not
[28:59] He healed them I believe the same thing
[29:03] happened in this day think of the
[29:05] hundreds of thousands of people that
[29:07] received physical healing your brother
[29:09] around this ministry how many of those
[29:11] people were not actually children of God
[29:13] but they had enough faith to believe for
[29:16] Supernatural healing so what poor but
[29:20] that that purpose it God had us I
[29:23] mentioned this before and and I haven't
[29:28] found this story in a while so just bear
[29:31] with me but when when when brother
[29:33] Branham went to Chicago one time back in
[29:36] the early days when he went to Chicago
[29:38] one time they had three or four days
[29:40] setup of Matson Bo's day I think or
[29:43] somebody had had it set up or something
[29:45] and he was going to Chicago and had for
[29:48] five days meetings whatever it was three
[29:49] or four days and after the Fuhrer the
[29:51] second or third night he tells his
[29:55] people he informs is a manager and all
[30:00] the purpose or the person that God sent
[30:04] me here for came in last night we can
[30:06] close the meetings now down now of
[30:08] course they did and they kept the
[30:10] meetings going because it was advertised
[30:12] a lot of people were coming but brother
[30:14] Graham expressed a
[30:16] purpose that God sent me here for this
[30:19] park this person this purpose and that
[30:22] person when the God revealed to him that
[30:24] person was in he said we can close the
[30:26] meetings down because that's the one God
[30:29] came to get in Chicago think about that
[30:33] the purpose and that person that God had
[30:37] sent him there for good put an airplane
[30:41] on the ground in Memphis Tennessee for a
[30:44] woman for her little boy boy wasn't
[30:46] little but hurt her boy is little to her
[30:48] but her boy see God would bankrupt
[30:53] heaven beside let one of his children go
[30:56] go away or go astray all the father has
[30:59] given will come but there's a balance to
[31:02] maintain and make sure that we
[31:04] understand yes we want to be productive
[31:06] here we want to do what we can for God
[31:09] here but our job is to preach the gospel
[31:12] this is not our kingdom this is not a
[31:14] home we're not here to build a kingdom
[31:17] we're not here for perpetual existence
[31:20] we're here to do God's purpose and then
[31:22] go home eternity will enter in labor and
[31:26] eternity will begin later but now is the
[31:30] purpose God give us and then we did the
[31:32] time has come up let's go home look at
[31:34] this now an invisible union November
[31:38] 1965 brother and says I'm he's I just
[31:42] got a little excerpt out of this but if
[31:44] you go listen to it he's going on pretty
[31:47] good and then he hits this quote so only
[31:50] secluded this one quote but you go
[31:51] listen to it above and below it it's
[31:54] just outstanding but when it gets to
[31:56] this quote he said now buildings all
[31:58] right hospitals are all right all these
[32:01] other things are all right educational
[32:02] programs that's why we have to live here
[32:05] we have to read right that's one of the
[32:07] nice of God but that's not why I put us
[32:12] here he said like we wasn't supposed to
[32:15] put on any clothes at the beginning I'll
[32:17] preach on that glittery Suika Lord
[32:19] willing
[32:19] but we have to wear clothes because God
[32:22] because God gave us clothes but in the
[32:24] beginning we didn't need them
[32:26] we were veiled now she is veiled now see
[32:29] at that time we were veiled I just leave
[32:33] it there it's just like they were in the
[32:37] Garden of Eden they were veiled from
[32:38] their nakedness we were veiled today
[32:40] that veil that God gave us helps us to
[32:44] to stay protected from what's going on
[32:49] around us it's a godly veil it's
[32:51] available to help us understand what
[32:53] holiness is and what righteousness is
[32:56] then it was the same thing they didn't
[32:58] realize that they were naked because
[33:00] they had the holy veil now that holy
[33:03] veil that God give us now you know we
[33:06] can see and understand and see those
[33:07] things today and they aren't the same
[33:09] today as they were then because that was
[33:12] a holy veil we have a different kind of
[33:15] veil but it's the Holy Spirit veil even
[33:17] though we can see we understand what
[33:19] God's holiness really is and that
[33:22] holiness that God gave us puts it in
[33:24] perspective see the police are fine
[33:28] the hospitals are great the educational
[33:32] programs all that's it's fine and dandy
[33:34] good not not going to say against that
[33:36] in those people but that's not why we're
[33:38] here that's not if your doctor or nurse
[33:42] or a policeman or whatever that's
[33:44] perfectly fine god bless you that's
[33:46] wonderful that's a great thing God works
[33:48] through medicine God wants to do those
[33:50] things but God put this bride here to
[33:52] preach the gospel our purpose is to be
[33:56] here - to get those that that belong to
[33:58] Yemen bring them into the fold and then
[34:01] when they come in the hole they do the
[34:03] same
[34:04] you talk about a pyramid scheme it's not
[34:06] a scheme but it's it's bringing them in
[34:10] and one person brings in ten more ten
[34:12] more ten one you got the kingdom of Gus
[34:15] we want to fulfill is God's purpose
[34:18] God's purpose here second Timothy now
[34:20] let's read this 2nd Timothy 4 second
[34:24] Timothy chapter 4 read a few verses of
[34:27] scripture here now notice this won't
[34:31] cause bosses thinks of the world that's
[34:33] fine we live here we get educated and
[34:37] you can't hardly live with them get
[34:38] money without a good job of that
[34:41] education sometimes we go to doctors we
[34:44] go to hospitals there's nothing wrong
[34:46] with that those are just the economies
[34:48] of the things who could go and make a
[34:50] little bit of money here we go
[34:52] use that money to buy food and that's
[34:55] the economy's that we live in and that's
[34:57] that's the part of what we deal with in
[35:00] this cosmos but that's not our purpose
[35:03] that's not why God put us here all those
[35:06] things are just after shoots of the
[35:09] purpose cuts called us to be here for
[35:12] second Timothy 4:1 he said now I charge
[35:15] thee listen to this now charge see
[35:17] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[35:19] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[35:22] dead at his appearing and his kingdom
[35:23] preach the word amen
[35:27] preach the word that's about as good an
[35:30] instruction as I know preach the word be
[35:32] instant in season out of season reprove
[35:34] rebuke exhort with all long-suffering
[35:37] and doctrine for the time will come when
[35:39] they will not endure sound doctrine amen
[35:42] to that but after their own lusts shall
[35:45] they heap to themselves teachers having
[35:48] itching ears and they shall turn away
[35:50] their ears from the truth and shall be
[35:52] turned into fables oh my if you see a
[35:56] falling away today and what
[35:58] going on in this world and people
[36:00] turning to everything it seems like but
[36:03] what is godly turning to every other
[36:05] church or every other ministry or
[36:07] whatever that other than something that
[36:09] God's ordained at God is in people said
[36:13] well this church is fine what might be
[36:15] that that's fine but what does the Bible
[36:17] say because that's all it matters the
[36:21] standard is in here the standards done
[36:23] up here the standards not in some
[36:25] seminary the standard is in this Bible
[36:27] and if they don't make the stems of this
[36:29] Bible then I believe it along because
[36:31] it's got to meet this standard it's got
[36:33] to meet God's standard it doesn't be
[36:35] God's standard then what's the point
[36:36] that we just might as well have a
[36:39] another Club let's just form another
[36:41] club like the quad so the lines or
[36:44] whatever or just for another club or
[36:46] just have another club we'll come get
[36:48] together have few drinks and enjoy our
[36:50] social life and dine go to hell but bow
[36:54] that's not why we're here
[36:56] amen we're here to fulfill the purpose
[36:57] of God give us place to work Paul's town
[37:00] Timothy preach the word reprove rebuke
[37:02] with all long-suffering doctrine that's
[37:05] why God give us a voice that's why God
[37:07] give us a life that's why give us the
[37:09] Holy Spirit so we live that life and we
[37:12] project that spirit and we let that word
[37:14] live through us so that others could see
[37:17] Jesus in us I've said it many times
[37:19] friend they might not understand what it
[37:21] is they might not comprehend why it's
[37:24] like that or why you're like that or why
[37:26] do you act like that they may call you a
[37:29] name or square and they've got so many
[37:31] names for everybody the fear thing was
[37:33] talking about the other day in the
[37:35] shaming remember we talked about the
[37:37] fate of the fear and the shaming you
[37:39] know they come up with a name for
[37:40] everything I thought that was only
[37:43] supposed to be in kindergarten
[37:45] playgrounds that people called names
[37:47] other people names but you see grown
[37:50] adults learning people politicians if
[37:54] they can't understand it because it's
[37:56] not something they believe
[37:58] hold to themselves as a principle they
[38:00] put a name on it or label it as a some
[38:02] kind of a phobia I'd hate to think if
[38:07] they knew me what they call me what
[38:10] would they call us I'm not smart enough
[38:13] to make that up
[38:14] but they already come up with a name for
[38:16] people who are abiding by their purpose
[38:20] and rules of this coronavirus Court
[38:23] idiots I think our quarry idiots or
[38:25] something like that they call them it's
[38:27] just a name
[38:28] I thought names were left behind we're
[38:30] in kindergarten but that's exactly what
[38:33] they do is the fear is the shame is to
[38:36] try to control you by calling you a name
[38:39] oh you're this person you're like this
[38:41] because you're luckier you're this kind
[38:43] of a person no I'm just like God because
[38:45] God's made me like God God born again of
[38:49] the Holy Spirit I am the way I am
[38:50] because of the grace of God not because
[38:54] of some phobia because I am what God
[38:57] made me let's read this now a trial now
[39:02] this is an April 5th 1964 brother Graham
[39:05] preached at trial several times but in
[39:07] the April 5th 1964 trial all what ought
[39:11] that do to us though we be alienated
[39:14] though we're in a dark world of unbelief
[39:16] and sorrow and sickness and death listen
[39:19] to this alienated in a dark world amen
[39:24] not this kingdom dark world of unbelief
[39:30] sorrow sickness and death you say
[39:34] unbelief
[39:35] how do you know if they believe or not
[39:37] if they're out there promoting that
[39:39] sinus is the only true short things we
[39:42] have that's unbelief that's death
[39:45] think of the thousands of things that
[39:48] scientists prove was perfectly right a
[39:50] hundred years ago that our null and void
[39:53] today the dump that dump they don't even
[39:55] count that there was a time where
[39:57] scientists thought that the atom was the
[39:59] smallest thing there was and then one
[40:01] day they figured out they could spread
[40:02] that atom and all those other stuff come
[40:05] out of it
[40:06] don't tell me science is the most short
[40:09] if size is the most short thing we have
[40:11] friends and we're all in trouble
[40:13] darkness unbelief sorrow sickness and
[40:17] death think about that now that all this
[40:21] is going on more and more people are
[40:23] depressed more people getting I've heard
[40:27] more people are becoming alcoholics
[40:29] again drug addicts again children at
[40:32] home being abused by their parents
[40:33] because the schools are closed
[40:35] sickness sorrow and death I'm not saying
[40:38] that closing it was the right or wrong
[40:40] thing to do I'm just saying look at the
[40:41] result you think well there's so many
[40:44] people that have died from it how many
[40:45] more might have died well how many other
[40:47] lives are being ruined as a result of
[40:49] what's going on again I'm not here to
[40:52] politicize that I'm not here to say it's
[40:54] right or wrong or indifferent I'm here
[40:56] to preach the gospel but I know that in
[41:00] this world of darkness and unbelief it
[41:03] is sorrow sickness and death yet lack
[41:10] yet let's act like some less act like
[41:14] sons and daughters of God we are the
[41:17] sons and daughters of the king it ought
[41:20] to change our attitude everything no
[41:23] matter what the rest of the world is we
[41:26] must hold up the rights of God
[41:29] praise the Lord no matter what the world
[41:33] is we must hold up the rights of God
[41:36] mine we remember that this is not our
[41:39] home we are not of this country we are
[41:43] not of this world we're born of the
[41:47] Spirit of God which is above several
[41:50] times Jesus even in John talks about
[41:53] that I had a couple of those scriptures
[41:54] I had to take out just for times sake
[41:56] Jesus said I'm from above Jesus says I'm
[41:59] out of this world
[42:00] Jesus saw them if you were of this world
[42:03] if you're of me the world's going to
[42:05] hate you too because on either the Rope
[42:07] dirt out of the world they hate me they
[42:09] hate you none of us were born of the
[42:13] Spirit of God which is above he said I
[42:16] was going with my life here not long ago
[42:17] to a grocery store I've seen a strange
[42:20] thing in the summer time in Indiana a
[42:22] woman had on a dress
[42:24] they don't wear them too much anymore
[42:26] you know my wife I said well look at
[42:29] their wonder if that woman's a Christian
[42:31] they said well all these women I know
[42:34] some of them here singing the choirs
[42:36] churches
[42:36] she said why why why is it bill that
[42:40] they do that I said of course and our
[42:43] people our people doesn't do that I said
[42:46] of course we're of a different nation
[42:48] media said how people don't do that the
[42:52] man said of course we're of a different
[42:54] nation she said we're Americans aren't
[42:56] we I said oh no we're just camping here
[43:00] we're not Americans I said see we are
[43:03] from above
[43:05] that's easy Doug that American spirit
[43:08] can get onion no but other band was
[43:10] talking about in the spiritual aspect
[43:12] now of course not the fact that we
[43:14] weren't born as Americans in this world
[43:16] but understanding that our spiritual
[43:18] aspect transcends everything else that
[43:20] goes on here yes of course we're
[43:23] Americans yes of course
[43:24] we live in this country and we read
[43:25] write do the things it's country
[43:27] dictates but we're from a higher order
[43:29] friend we come from above you're going
[43:32] again in the spirit of God the Holy
[43:34] Spirit come down United our hearts with
[43:36] God and we profess like Abraham we are
[43:39] pilgrims and strangers this is not our
[43:42] home we're seeking a city whose builder
[43:44] and maker is God coming from above yes
[43:48] we are the sons and daughters of God if
[43:51] you're gonna listen hope you did maybe
[43:53] you didn't maybe you forgot future homes
[43:56] the heavenly bridegroom and earthly
[43:57] bride you go to look at that listen to
[43:59] it you have it if you did you see that
[44:02] point where brother Branham was talking
[44:03] about Abraham coming and having
[44:05] fellowship with Melchizedek he said on
[44:06] the very ground because when Abraham
[44:09] went forth
[44:09] Abraham went forth from his foreign
[44:12] country although it was common to him
[44:14] left his dad and he went to a land that
[44:16] he knew nothing uh but he was being led
[44:18] of God as God was leading him his life
[44:21] was preaching is his life was preaching
[44:22] it was preaching what was then what was
[44:25] coming in what is now or what's now and
[44:27] what is coming because that place that
[44:30] brother Adam talked about Abraham and
[44:32] Melchizedek having fellowship and
[44:34] communion he's having the the wine and
[44:38] the bread as they're having their
[44:40] communion and fellowship he said he had
[44:43] it right there on the little spot where
[44:46] that new city is going to come up out of
[44:48] the earth that pyramid-shaped mountain
[44:50] 1,500 miles where that is going to be
[44:52] the prana home of this bride and the
[44:55] bridegroom that future home it brings us
[44:59] to that place whether was just a
[45:00] foreshadow of it when Abraham come and
[45:03] had fellowship and communion right there
[45:05] God led him to that very spot and when
[45:08] he got to that very special spot God met
[45:11] him there
[45:11] praise Allah the logos come down put on
[45:14] a form of flesh and set here and had
[45:16] fellowship with his servant had
[45:18] communion with this servant right there
[45:21] on the literal spot that's that home
[45:23] that's that place that
[45:25] looking to Abraham was looking for he
[45:28] said we're not we're pilgrims and
[45:30] strangers it's not a home we're seeking
[45:32] a city whose builder and maker is God
[45:34] amen that's the city we're looking for
[45:37] the city whose builder and maker is God
[45:40] coming from above yes we are sons and
[45:42] daughters of God amen in that city that
[45:45] will descend of course on that
[45:47] pyramid-shaped mountain and bring it out
[45:49] in the light that it's supposed to be
[45:51] for us to live on it'll be a place that
[45:53] would be fit for us to live on a couple
[45:57] more scriptures for our clothes st. John
[45:59] chapter 15 let's see here st. John 15:18
[46:04] beginning with verse 18 is one of the
[46:06] scriptures I wanted to read that I
[46:08] quoted if the world hate you you know
[46:11] that it hated me before it hated you so
[46:15] if the world hates you understand it
[46:16] hated Jesus before it hated you if you
[46:20] were of the world the world would love
[46:22] his home but because ye are not of the
[46:27] world but I have chosen you out of the
[46:30] world therefore the world hated you what
[46:34] world world cosmos World Order
[46:38] now this goes out to a lot people maybe
[46:43] I'm going to read it but I remember back
[46:45] years and years ago certain man from a
[46:49] certain denomination held up a message
[46:50] book and said this is our worst enemy
[46:53] look friend they know who we are
[46:56] don't deceive yourself don't don't
[46:58] neglect to understand they know who we
[47:01] are
[47:03] it's going to come to that place one day
[47:05] it's going to come to that head one day
[47:07] I'm you notice maybe I'm checking my
[47:09] words I'm I told you the morning God
[47:11] gave me a month ago just to be careful
[47:13] what I say they know and I'm careful
[47:16] about what I say here because this
[47:17] broadcast publicly but but we're not of
[47:22] this world they know we're not of this
[47:25] world God knows we're not of this world
[47:28] God chose us God chose us out of the
[47:32] world we're not of the world we're
[47:34] actually in a different the bride isn't
[47:36] even entered into a bride age now to the
[47:39] place that my vision my vision I'm
[47:43] looking for Christ but I'm also even
[47:47] first looking for my loved ones to show
[47:49] up just like the scripture said you know
[47:53] how they ever hear that anybody else say
[47:54] but the bride scripturally when Jesus
[47:59] rose he he brought many of the Saints
[48:02] with him and they appeared unto many
[48:03] well it's gonna be the same thing this
[48:05] resurrection gonna be the same way
[48:07] they're gonna resurrect and they're
[48:10] going to begin to peer unto many and
[48:12] we'll know who they are
[48:14] what will recognize it they'll appear to
[48:16] those who are looking for them he won't
[48:19] come to those who aren't looking that's
[48:21] our vision there it will come to those
[48:24] who are looking and I'm looking friends
[48:27] I'm looking every day I believe your
[48:29] vision you're looking to because we're
[48:30] not of this world
[48:31] he says I've chosen him out of the world
[48:34] therefore the world hates you the world
[48:36] hates us because we're not of this world
[48:39] we're looking for a very concise time
[48:44] and way of living amen this world this
[48:47] cosmos look here
[48:50] and Satan's een in the August 1965
[48:55] now notice perverted from innocence
[48:58] don't miss this now the church has been
[49:00] with this lust veil on notice now we
[49:03] talked about the veil a minute ago
[49:05] notice I probably didn't do a very good
[49:08] job of it but notice now notice what
[49:10] it's done to her its perverting her from
[49:13] innocence to knowledge see the holy veil
[49:16] she was innocent with the lust veil she
[49:19] has knowledge she knows it's Pleasant
[49:23] she knows what it does see it's a fruit
[49:26] it's a tree to be desired to make one
[49:28] wise she is perverted from innocence to
[49:31] knowledge from holiness to filth and
[49:33] lust and from life to death look at what
[49:37] the influence of the world is today look
[49:39] what the influence of our poor children
[49:41] is today if nothing else all the filth
[49:44] that pours out of Hollywood all the the
[49:48] designs and the clothes and and the
[49:51] fashions and what a little bit there is
[49:54] in it and the filth that comes across
[49:57] the screens is just it's it's just
[50:00] horrible that thing that the kids feed
[50:03] off for these things people feed off for
[50:06] those things with no wonder that's what
[50:08] they're going to produce because it's
[50:10] traded holiness for filth and lost in
[50:14] life to death look friend we're not of
[50:17] this world we don't we don't live like
[50:19] them we don't act like them we don't
[50:22] think like them we don't dress like them
[50:25] we don't go to the places they go to we
[50:28] don't speak like they do
[50:31] in a lot of ways in almost every way we
[50:34] don't dress like they do nothing that we
[50:36] do it's becoming mobile you see people
[50:40] who call themselves Christians and you
[50:43] take somebody out of the wagon you look
[50:45] at the two together you say which one's
[50:46] the Christian you can't even tell them
[50:49] apart anymore which one is which
[50:54] God's bride is recognizable God God
[50:58] should be able to be noticeable no
[51:00] matter where she is you see what she's I
[51:04] boss because she's different she's from
[51:06] a different wild we're not from this
[51:09] world we're not from this planet we live
[51:12] here this body and everything we do well
[51:14] we don't eat at dress look think like
[51:18] like the rest of the world does because
[51:22] we're apart from the world my mom and my
[51:25] sister used to sing an old song back
[51:27] years ago in North Carolina says we're
[51:29] in the world but not of the world that's
[51:31] what the master said amen and I believe
[51:34] that's still true they treated they
[51:36] traded innocents for knowledge holiness
[51:39] for filth and lust from and life to
[51:42] death but rinses and said this kingdom
[51:45] has to die this kingdom shall die the
[51:50] God of heaven will destroy it from the
[51:53] face of the earth think about that all
[51:57] the elements will melt with fervent heat
[51:59] the Bible says let's go to that let me
[52:02] let's just read that for a minute let's
[52:04] see what others hey one more scripture
[52:06] not one to read and then we'll go over
[52:08] to the second Peter let's read in
[52:10] Hebrews first and and I want to finish
[52:13] up here just a minute Hebrews 13 14 for
[52:15] we had for for here we have no
[52:18] continuing City but we seek one
[52:21] come amen here we have no continuing
[52:24] City Jesus said if this were my kingdom
[52:27] yes I'm a king I'm a king but not of
[52:30] this kingdom and if I was the king of
[52:32] this kingdom my servants would fight but
[52:35] I'm not of this world that's not my
[52:37] purpose that's not the point I'm here
[52:39] for I'm here to become a sacrifice I'm
[52:42] here to be a sacrificial lamb so that
[52:46] through my death and the shedding of my
[52:48] blood
[52:49] millions can know Jesus Christ and the
[52:53] power of that resurrection but second
[52:57] Peter listened second Peter 3 let's
[53:01] begin with verse 9 the Lord is not slack
[53:06] concerning his promise as some can some
[53:09] men count slackness but is
[53:10] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[53:13] that any should perish but that all
[53:15] should come to repentance I'll say
[53:17] praise the Lord - that had the same
[53:19] desire but the day of the Lord will come
[53:22] as a thief in the night in the which the
[53:25] heavens shall pass away with a great
[53:27] noise in the elements listen this this
[53:29] this earth this world this cosmos that
[53:33] we're living in listen what's going to
[53:35] happen to it
[53:35] and what Saints we're getting closer to
[53:38] that everybody trying to sense a lot
[53:40] let's make this a better place so that's
[53:42] fine and dandy friend we're just making
[53:44] it fine and better so that it's but
[53:47] that's the whole promise of words going
[53:49] to it we want to make it the best place
[53:53] we can make it until that time but that
[53:56] but our point preach the gospel bring
[54:00] those out of that the day of the Lord
[54:03] will come as a thief in the night in the
[54:06] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[54:09] great noise and the elements shall melt
[54:12] with fervent heat the earth also and the
[54:16] works the works that are therein
[54:20] I'll be burned up we're killing
[54:23] ourselves making a great Kingdom here
[54:25] that's gonna be cannon fodder it's gonna
[54:28] be burnt over Oh help us what that ought
[54:34] to do where our vision to understand and
[54:36] that becomes a reality friend all this
[54:38] here is going to be gone all this here
[54:40] is going to be burnt over and done away
[54:42] with it's going to be melted with
[54:44] further heat even the very molecules
[54:47] every molecule of sin will be
[54:50] annihilated because this place is gonna
[54:53] have to be fit for Christ and his bride
[54:56] to come back and reign in the Millennium
[54:58] and for the new city to be set up it's
[55:02] gotta be purified because that world
[55:04] pack that word pass away or words
[55:06] doesn't mean it's gonna annihilate this
[55:09] planet it's going to change it transform
[55:13] it annihilate every element of sin even
[55:18] the atmospheres will explode melt with
[55:21] fervent heat to make it fit for Christ
[55:24] and his bride to come live on the great
[55:27] transformation that pass away is the
[55:30] same word in Matthew they said heavens
[55:33] and earth will pass away change from one
[55:36] form to the other but my word will never
[55:39] pass away or change from one form to
[55:43] another same word same meaning the word
[55:47] cannot change
[55:50] Amen you want something sure you want
[55:53] something true forget science
[55:57] this is it it's the only thing that will
[55:59] survive it not this little book but the
[56:02] word which is Christ to Christ the word
[56:05] Oh mine seeing then that all these
[56:09] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[56:12] persons ought we to be in all holy
[56:15] conversation and godliness looking for
[56:18] and hasting unto the coming of the day
[56:20] of God wherein the heavens shall be
[56:23] inferred the heavens shall be on fire
[56:26] shall be dissolved and the elements
[56:29] shall melt with fervent Heat
[56:31] my friend think of it this not all
[56:34] nevertheless we according to his promise
[56:36] look for new heavens and a new earth
[56:39] wherein dwelleth righteousness that's
[56:43] what we're looking for the place wherein
[56:46] dwelleth righteousness
[56:48] wherefore love seeing that ye look for
[56:50] such things be diligent that ye be found
[56:53] of him in peace without spot and
[56:56] blameless found in Christ be careful he
[57:00] says to be found in Christ without spot
[57:04] blameless in the place in the position
[57:08] of God's purpose in our lives
[57:10] God placing us here the reason that
[57:14] we're here Jesus said if my st. if if
[57:18] this is my kingdom my servants would
[57:19] fight think about that if this was
[57:21] arcing them what would we do how would
[57:24] we act if this is my kingdom I run for
[57:26] mayor if this is my kingdom I'd run for
[57:29] president I do everything I couldn't try
[57:31] to make sure and make this that place
[57:35] that that's envisioned in my mind but
[57:38] the place is envisioned in my mind if I
[57:40] ran for prayer even if I became the
[57:42] president wouldn't happen anyway because
[57:44] this is what's going to happen to
[57:47] what's our point not to build a kingdom
[57:50] here with store up treasures in heaven
[57:52] where moth does not eat and rust doesn't
[57:55] corrode we send up our treasures in
[57:58] heaven amen all that we can do for God
[58:02] is the only thing that will stand things
[58:04] that we do for the world the things that
[58:06] we make and are living all those things
[58:08] we have to do like said the education
[58:10] read write and close and all that's us
[58:12] part of comments you go that's all fine
[58:14] and dandy not a thing in the world wrong
[58:15] with that but all that's going to be
[58:17] gone one day you ever heard the old
[58:18] story that they've never seen a u-haul
[58:20] trailer behind us pulling behind ours we
[58:24] can't take it with us all the but what
[58:26] we send ahead but this world is on our
[58:29] home
[58:29] gotta keep that balance and make sure
[58:31] that we don't get caught up and the
[58:34] things that's going on so many people
[58:36] and I have something I feel maybe the
[58:38] Lord give me during the week to bit but
[58:41] understanding it not to get caught up in
[58:44] some of these other things that you know
[58:47] we're just humans and we try to work
[58:49] everything out so much.you we try to
[58:52] make things be things that and we don't
[58:56] know if that's what they're supposed to
[58:58] be or not but we love the Lord we do the
[59:02] best we can with what the Lord's give us
[59:03] amen and I'm thankful that God's blessed
[59:06] us to be able to have his word to be
[59:09] able to look into his word and and that
[59:11] word can speak to us and and show us you
[59:15] know friend
[59:16] just exhort you in pray read your Bible
[59:21] spin-spin least a portion of your day
[59:23] with the Lord Jesus and let him speak to
[59:26] you let it move you let it help you show
[59:29] you that whatever purpose he has in your
[59:31] life be fulfilled whatever that might be
[59:34] every one of us have a purpose every one
[59:36] of us I know that the bottom line there
[59:39] the the number one pure goal is to
[59:41] preach the gospel that's absolutely but
[59:43] you know of that underlying part of even
[59:45] that preach the gospel is that we all
[59:48] have a part and we all have specific
[59:50] things that God wants us to do specific
[59:53] places specific people maybe even if the
[59:58] God if God wanted me to share this
[59:59] message with President Trump I believe
[1:00:02] you make the way and show me and give me
[1:00:05] the words who had the mayor of the city
[1:00:08] whoever some great Hollywood movie star
[1:00:12] or song a senior musician or something
[1:00:16] I'm gonna do it you couldn't be his team
[1:00:19] of horses couldn't stop me but I believe
[1:00:22] God would make a way so whatever that
[1:00:24] point whatever that purpose whatever
[1:00:26] that reason is this is not our kingdom
[1:00:29] friend this is not our home we're not
[1:00:32] here to make that this kingdom and build
[1:00:35] great Kingdom here for us we're here to
[1:00:40] be servants of God and to live for him
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:43] let that know our our focus our vision
[1:00:46] let that help us to to understand that
[1:00:50] that middle-of-the-road even that that
[1:00:52] that that moderate way of we think of
[1:00:55] maintaining that balance between
[1:00:58] understanding that were sons and
[1:01:01] daughters of God were from above and the
[1:01:05] point that an apartment God has us here
[1:01:07] to play Jesus did only what the father
[1:01:09] showed him
[1:01:10] help us Lord that we can do that we can
[1:01:13] be led by that spirit and only do what
[1:01:15] the father shows us let's bow our heads
[1:01:18] Lord Jesus follower thankful again today
[1:01:22] that you're with us and that you never
[1:01:24] can never leave or forsake us thank you
[1:01:27] Lord for this time and the ability to
[1:01:28] have this streaming service I pray that
[1:01:31] you bless it Lord I pray that your words
[1:01:33] would go forth to each one of us and
[1:01:36] Lord may it be strength in our lives may
