[11:29] amen amen I'm good to worship and praise
[11:32] the Lord he's been so good to us amen we
[11:35] we've
[11:36] transitioned over into a new year uh
[11:39] singing that song looking at the tablet
[11:41] here and it just struck me Sunday 1 1
[11:44] 23. amen happy New Year amen praise the
[11:48] Lord pray you all have a blessed happy
[11:50] prosperous New Year in the Lord amen I
[11:53] don't know of any other better place to
[11:55] start a new year than right here in
[11:56] church right amen praising the Lord amen
[11:59] amen those of you who weren't able to
[12:01] make it or streaming today I'm sure you
[12:02] wanted to be here but Lord reach the
[12:04] best you where you are today as well
[12:06] amen thankful to be in the house of the
[12:08] god uh today appreciate his goodness
[12:11] service to it to a whole another year
[12:13] and bringing us to a new year we don't
[12:15] know how many of them more we have left
[12:17] amen but we know that they're in his
[12:20] hands for us and all things work
[12:23] together for our good praise the lord
[12:25] it's an interesting thing I looked at it
[12:27] a little bit I don't put a whole lot of
[12:30] um
[12:31] effort and energy into this but uh
[12:34] sister Judy Arnold sent something to
[12:35] Sonya last night and uh the first church
[12:38] age uh lasted 117 years
[12:43] and 2023 is the 117th year of laodicea
[12:49] now we know we know brother Branham said
[12:52] laodicea goes into Perdition so this
[12:54] can't be the last year of laodicea you
[12:56] got three and a half after the bride
[12:58] leaves there's three and a half years of
[12:59] tribulation laodicea and end of
[13:01] Perdition so uh but I just found it
[13:04] interesting that this year is the year
[13:07] that we actually match the duration of
[13:10] the first church year so that was
[13:12] interesting so sister Judy if you're
[13:13] watching I did find that interesting
[13:15] again I what it means I have no idea uh
[13:19] but again those little details like the
[13:21] pope passing away
[13:24] um the Pope Benedict not the current one
[13:25] but the one that retired all those
[13:28] things I I'm not a prophet I can't tell
[13:30] you necessarily this the Lord shows me
[13:31] the significance of it but I know that
[13:34] they're in the religious realm there's a
[13:35] significance to this that's happening in
[13:38] another Spirit there that's broke so
[13:40] amen Lord knows amen but I'm happy to be
[13:44] his I'm happy to be here happy to be in
[13:46] the house of the Lord today so amen open
[13:49] our service in prayer and Joel would you
[13:52] open our service in prayer bag

[14:07] us another good year yes

[17:25] Beginning amen praise the Lord a lot of
[17:28] people make resolutions on the first day
[17:29] of the year New Year's resolutions and
[17:32] of course probably 99 of them are more

[17:37] weeks uh I don't make resolutions but I
[17:40] try to consecrate myself more to the
[17:43] Lord amen every day praise the Lord so

[19:44] thought I was born again
[19:48] praise the Lord Jesus amen
[19:52] you know Nicodemus it baffled him when
[19:55] Jesus told him that
[19:56] he just couldn't grasp it he just
[19:58] couldn't understand how can I enter into
[20:01] my mother's womb the second time
[20:04] something that's
[20:05] miracle that God placed in each believer
[20:08] to be able to be born again to be
[20:11] renewed to be regenerated for his Spirit
[20:15] to move into us and take control over
[20:17] our lives and make us new creatures in
[20:19] Christ Jesus amen you don't maybe think
[20:23] a whole lot about it in that context but
[20:25] friend it's a miracle that a person born
[20:28] in sins shaped iniquity come the world
[20:30] speaking lies can be changed into a new
[20:33] creation amen by the grace of God Amen

[21:51] again

[22:00] yes Hallelujah born again just like
[22:05] Jesus said

[22:14] Calvary
[22:16] well I'm glad so glad that I've been
[22:20] born again over time
[22:24] yes born again there's really been a
[22:29] change in me Hallelujah
[22:32] morning and just like Jesus
[22:37] said
[22:39] well born again and it's all because of
[22:44] calvary
[22:46] well I'm glad so glad that I've been
[22:50] born again
[22:54] amen
[22:55] so glad Saints Hallelujah so glad I've
[22:59] been born again thank you Lord Jesus
[23:02] amen that born that new birth will make
[23:05] a real change in you too amen praise the
[23:09] Lord Jesus it'll make as Paul said it'll
[23:12] make the things that you love you now
[23:13] hate the things you hated you love
[23:15] praise the Lord and he knew
[23:18] he knew from experience he's the one who
[23:21] went down to try to put all of them that
[23:23] were worshiping God out of business amen
[23:26] one week
[23:28] he was going out to take him out of the
[23:30] business the next week he was down there
[23:31] preaching to him praise the Lord I say a
[23:35] week I don't know what the Bible doesn't
[23:36] give a time frame but one moment he's
[23:39] persecuting when the next minute he's
[23:41] preaching to him could you imagine
[23:45] I could just imagine people walking by a
[23:47] church and coming in and saying who's
[23:49] speaking tonight Paul Paul you kidding
[23:52] me you mean Saul the guy that tormented
[23:55] us and put us out of his same guy who's
[23:57] been a change in him and then he's a new
[23:59] person he's not the same guy it was just
[24:02] sit down and listen the wall amen
[24:04] there's been a change thank you Lord
[24:07] and we have a few prayer requests to
[24:09] bring to you this morning amen I know
[24:12] there's none over there Joel so
[24:13] don't worry about it usually I have him
[24:16] get them because sometimes people come
[24:18] in a little late and write them down so
[24:19] it gives everybody the opportunity to
[24:22] get them written down so uh that helps I
[24:25] think with the flow of the service but
[24:26] we didn't have any over there so
[24:29] um sister Sharia texted me this morning
[24:31] uh they are not feeling well they said
[24:34] they've been doing fine for the past
[24:35] couple of weeks and they woke up this
[24:37] morning and uh coughing and
[24:40] congestion and also please pray for them
[24:43] if you will also sister Shelia texted me
[24:46] and said that she's having I think she's
[24:47] Texas sisters too but she's having a lot
[24:50] of neck and shoulder pain for the past
[24:52] three days and she'd get got up was
[24:55] getting ready and want the comment it's
[24:56] just a pain just overtook her so please
[24:58] remember her in prayer Sharia and Sheila
[25:02] said they would be watching here so God
[25:03] bless you if you are and I'm going to be
[25:05] praying that the Lord just touched you
[25:07] all today also sister Matisse sent me a
[25:09] text and said that she's had a sort of a
[25:13] pretty bad sore throat and a deep cough
[25:15] she is feeling much better but again
[25:19] out of abundance of caution and trying
[25:21] to keep and make sure that those things
[25:24] stay isolated she decided to stay home
[25:26] today as well so please remember her in
[25:28] prayer uh also found out this week while
[25:31] I was out of town that a couple of dear
[25:34] friends of mine passed away a couple of
[25:36] Hall sisters brother Dwight Hall who
[25:39] some of you may know just from his
[25:41] singing prowess and brother Dwight Hall
[25:44] wrote a lot of songs sang a lot of songs
[25:46] made a lot of
[25:48] tapes CDs whatever they are right now so
[25:53] you may know brother Dwight from uh his
[25:55] singing I don't know if he ever came to
[25:56] Tabernacle not years ago I know we had
[25:59] since I've been here but maybe years ago
[26:01] he came brother Dwight his wife passed
[26:04] away this week so please remember human
[26:07] prayer was unexpected as far as I knew
[26:09] so please remember him in prayer they
[26:11] were getting up in age of course but
[26:13] precious brother precious sister a good
[26:16] family I was very dear friends with one
[26:18] of their sons for a while Paul Hall so
[26:21] let's please pray for them if you would
[26:24] also Gary Hall in Beaufort South
[26:27] Carolina his wife Jan passed away this
[26:29] week none of you would know except for
[26:31] Michael would know Jan but she passed
[26:33] away this week as well she actually if I
[26:36] remember right sister Jan passed away on
[26:39] my mom's birthday
[26:40] 27th so I believe it was the 27th one of
[26:45] the two but I believe it was sister Jan
[26:46] passed away on my mom's birthday 27th I
[26:49] didn't tell Gary that but Gary mom we
[26:52] knew them back my mom and dad back from
[26:55] when we very first came in the message
[26:57] uh new Brother Gary he's married to a
[27:00] different woman at the time but I knew
[27:02] them knew him very well and got to know
[27:04] his
[27:05] sister jammed very well when I was
[27:07] traveling back uh administering for some
[27:10] there in Beaufort they were attending
[27:12] church there
[27:14] Brother Gary and sister Jan made quite a
[27:16] pair uh for instrumentals they could
[27:21] both play a guitar about as good as I've
[27:23] ever seen anybody in person play they
[27:27] were tremendously talented of course
[27:29] Brother Gary still is but I think they
[27:31] had sister Jen's funeral yesterday but
[27:33] please remember Brother Gary uh in
[27:35] prayer again he's had some health issues
[27:37] he's been in the hospital a handful of
[27:40] times with heart issues I think a lot of
[27:44] people thought maybe Gary might go first
[27:46] but his wife did I think she came down
[27:48] with cancer
[27:49] and it took her so please remember them
[27:52] in prayer if you would amen anyone else
[27:55] have a spoken request or something on
[27:56] your heart welcome it was good to see
[27:59] you
[28:01] cool
[28:03] sister Julie was the only one over there
[28:08] I should have some neighbors
[28:11] anyone uh have a book report
[28:17] I haven't unspoken requests
[28:19] today let's stand to our feet if we
[28:22] could
[28:22] and then we'll remember these needs
[28:24] these requests appreciate the Lord
[28:25] giving the safe journey back and
[28:29] amen I'm still missing a piece of
[28:30] luggage but it's supposed to be

[28:39] healthy so brother Dennis would you take
[28:41] these needs to the world
[28:43] Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads
[28:46] in unison of the faith knowing Lord that
[28:50] another year has come forward my mind
[28:52] and as our brother has said many people
[28:55] making resolutions they're going to eat
[28:57] better they're going to lose weight
[28:59] they're going to do this and that and
[29:01] because they're doing it they fail my
[29:04] father May there be a sincerity from the
[29:08] depths of our heart Yes to Jesus
[29:10] dedicate Our Lives to you yes to draw
[29:13] closer to you Lord may your Holy Spirit
[29:17] work in a stronger than ever before that
[29:21] you'll bring us to the place of a
[29:24] stronger prayer life of a dedication of
[29:29] coming to church knowing that your word
[29:32] says oh God yes forsake not assembling
[29:36] ourselves together the more so as you
[29:39] see that day approaching amen and this
[29:42] Paul was speaking today of your second
[29:44] coming and how the enemy's fighting
[29:47] harder than ever before Lord keeping
[29:51] people away from the word away from your
[29:54] truth oh Lord we cannot do it in our own
[29:58] we cannot rely on our own abilities
[30:01] we'll fail you but father it's your work
[30:05] you started in us that you'll complete
[30:08] until that day and Lord help us to
[30:11] recognize that we cannot do nothing
[30:13] right we cannot be a good Christian our
[30:17] own the more we try the more we'll fail
[30:20] but Lord greater heareth in us
[30:24] it's your life in US Lord it really
[30:29] blessed my heart in 1948 I hurt your
[30:33] prophets say that it has to be Jesus
[30:36] Christ in you bringing you in
[30:39] subjections yes it has to be Christ
[30:43] alone it has to be you Lord having
[30:47] complete preeminence yes
[30:50] Lord It's like another year and it's
[30:55] like Peter said one time that some have
[30:58] mentioned where is the promise of this
[31:01] coming for everything seems to remain
[31:04] the same as our fathers fell asleep oh
[31:07] lord the devil knows his job but father
[31:11] he knows what it'll take to keep us away
[31:15] from you away from your word but father
[31:19] it's your work in us that give us
[31:21] ability to overcome to stay with your
[31:25] word and Lord there are many that are
[31:27] sick this morning that need a healing
[31:30] touch yes you know each and every one
[31:33] you know what they have needle father we
[31:36] are standing on your promises as as
[31:39] brother Brown says God wants you to take
[31:42] him at his word to believe that what he
[31:45] said it will come to pass as the word
[31:48] says if two shall agree it's touching
[31:51] anything it shall come the best amen be
[31:53] light yourself in the Lord he'll give

[41:12] um and then when she found the Lord the
[41:14] Lord changed her life and all the
[41:16] friends that she had had back then and
[41:17] all the things that she did and had one
[41:20] person that came to her funeral that I
[41:22] remember very vividly now others came
[41:23] that knew my sister over all those years
[41:26] and she got up and I believed she had
[41:29] told me personally it's been years ago
[41:30] but she had told me personally and she
[41:32] got up I can't remember now she got up
[41:34] and spoke one way or the other and she
[41:37] said
[41:38] that's not the one I knew
[41:40] she was a different person than the one
[41:43] I knew back in the day back years ago in
[41:46] her teenage early 20s whatever that's a
[41:48] Janice was a different person at my
[41:51] sister a different person at that time
[41:53] and it's only because of the grace of
[41:55] God Amen my sister Norma said you look
[41:58] back in your life and you saved mine

[42:06] so Lord anybody else
[42:10] what testimonials
[42:12] grandson
[42:13] my grandson can be used to love the Lord
[42:17] and therefore sometimes for the
[42:20] unforeseen reason he became very
[42:22] isolated
[42:24] um suicidal and homicidal and it was a
[42:27] horrible burden to my daughter and
[42:30] isolated
[42:32] um didn't visit anyone
[42:35] and um
[42:37] one day I visit them and
[42:40] I saw the demon
[42:42] yeah
[42:49] tell my daughter because
[42:56] me and her we prayed for the meat for
[42:59] her son yes we were afraid that he was
[43:01] like with somebody or kill them or
[43:04] killed himself
[43:06] um and
[43:09] I gotta say it we believe that he's been
[43:11] delivered amen amen all day in fact he
[43:15] spent the night on Christmas day which
[43:17] is so unusual nice
[43:20] yesterday and he's just like a different
[43:24] person amen
[43:26] praise the Lord
[43:29] what a horrible burden this was for us
[43:33] sure always we were always so stressed
[43:36] out that he would do something terrible
[43:38] yes but now he even has a job amen
[43:48] amen amen yes he has glory to God
[43:52] wonderful God is so good the one thing
[43:55] missing and all that stuff that's going
[43:57] on you hear about the killings and the
[44:00] homicides as you said and the one thing
[44:02] that's missing is a caring mother or
[44:04] grandmother something to go and lay
[44:06] hands on that cast that demon off
[44:08] he used to love to come to church so
[44:11] that's my next next step yes amen
[44:15] praise the Lord Next Step thank the Lord
[44:18] Jesus
[44:20] anyone else beautiful brother yes I
[44:23] wanna
[44:24] give glory and praise to the Lord
[44:27] last night Leah says you know we need to
[44:30] bring the New Year in with a time of
[44:33] prayer together and we prayed and you
[44:36] know and just we've dedicated ourselves
[44:39] to the Lord and I believe Leah has a
[44:42] good prayer life it's getting stronger
[44:45] but there's something I guess it keeps
[44:48] me humble she fights this word and she
[44:50] fights this truth and there's a friend
[44:53] that you're quite aware of and you've
[44:56] talked to her salad she called me a few
[44:59] days ago and I believe she's truly
[45:02] searching but Leah can be a real
[45:05] something about to her but I I believe
[45:08] the more she prays God's going to reveal
[45:11] himself to him and let's pray uh
[45:14] together that this will happen soon yes
[45:17] yeah because there's also someone else
[45:20] that really uh tops to leonette Sally
[45:24] but she has confidence in yourself and
[45:28] just confidence in me he's blessing
[45:30] yourself when she prayed and rededicated
[45:33] her life
[45:35] amen praise the Lord
[45:36] amen that's good to it's good to get to
[45:39] try to help her yes amen she said she's
[45:42] going to try to come to service sometime
[45:44] so I hope she does I hope she does be
[45:47] good to see her again I think we met her
[45:49] one time yes you met her anyway is
[45:53] you get went to a different
[45:55] large denominational Church you could
[45:57] probably guess I'm not going to call its
[45:58] name
[45:59] just destitute and needing some help and
[46:02] needing some counsel and
[46:03] so Lord just intervened and
[46:07] spoke to her and blessed her heart so
[46:09] she feels a lot better and like I said
[46:12] she's planning on coming to church yes
[46:14] so
[46:15] I look forward to that maybe that'll be
[46:17] the End Road to get Leah to start to
[46:19] come yes amen
[46:26] Ralph's coming back and praise the Lord
[46:28] I believe all of God's children are our
[46:31] families yes anybody else

[46:40] when I first started coming to church I
[46:43] wasn't sure
[46:46] the good thing about you know you have
[46:48] to keep coming and praying and listening
[46:51] to the word
[46:53] just God puts in your heart if you
[46:56] really want to learn about the message

[47:11] you yes you know if it's not there
[47:14] it won't speak to you right if there's
[47:17] that germ seed that's there when that
[47:19] word hits that seed it'll it'll cause
[47:22] something to happen yes you know even if
[47:24] you might not understand it or even if
[47:26] it seems out there somewhere or
[47:27] far-fetched or whatever
[47:29] doesn't matter it just keeps pulling
[47:32] because you know there's something is
[47:33] real it's true

[49:11] praise the Lords amen I believe it too
[49:15] my prayer and confession
[49:18] anybody else
[49:20] you know I want to cut it short I like I
[49:23] said when I did this I didn't plan a
[49:25] very lengthy service for today and it
[49:27] was New Year's Day but I didn't want to
[49:29] cancel either
[49:35] nobody else and we'll just stand to our
[49:37] feet amen and go to the scripture here
[49:40] we're going to go to the new beginning
[49:42] part 13. uh I think again uh I I thought
[49:47] about something that maybe would be
[49:51] as you'd say appropriate for a New
[49:53] Year's service day and I thought well
[49:54] then I felt my heart I thought what
[49:56] better than there would be for a new
[49:59] beginning yes uh again kind of where
[50:02] we're at here and what's going on is a
[50:04] new beginning a new beginning in our
[50:07] lives a new beginning in the year A New
[50:09] Beginning in the world the country
[50:11] um everybody always kind of looks at New
[50:13] Years as they roll over into New
[50:15] Opportunities and new chances and
[50:18] that's why I always you know say that
[50:21] the
[50:22] this you year bring you happiness and
[50:24] prosperity and blessings above measure
[50:29] new year new beginning so we're going to
[50:31] go back to that and
[50:34] part 13. so let's go to Genesis again
[50:36] chapter 1 verse one and two as we read
[50:39] that as our beginning scripture for this
[50:42] series
[50:43] Genesis chapter 1 verses one and two but
[50:46] before we do let's just fire our heads
[50:48] again for another word of Prayer
[50:50] amen Lord Jesus we're very thankful
[50:52] father again for 2022 we're thankful God
[50:56] for the gains we're thankful for the
[51:00] losses we're thankful for what you've
[51:02] given us and thankful for what you've
[51:04] taken from us Lord yes because we know
[51:06] what you may have taken from us Lord
[51:08] isn't gone forever lord it's like job
[51:11] Joe was doubled in everything that was
[51:13] taken from him except for his children
[51:15] knowing that his other children were on
[51:18] the other side waiting on him so he was
[51:20] still doubled even in them because they
[51:22] were there waiting on him so even at
[51:24] those things Lord that happened in our
[51:26] lives in the year that we look back and
[51:28] reflect upon we realize it can see so
[51:32] much more in retrospect how your hands
[51:35] have been Upon Our Lives Lord how you've
[51:37] led us and guided us and blessed us and
[51:39] helped us and we come to roadblocks we
[51:42] come to narrow tunnels and we come to
[51:44] tunnels that didn't seem to have a light
[51:46] at the end of them and so many things in
[51:48] our lives Lord and here we are again and
[51:50] we can give you thanks and praise and
[51:52] glory Lord knowing that you've brought
[51:54] us through every one of them we may yet
[51:57] still be in certain situations God that
[51:59] we don't understand we may still be in a
[52:01] tunnel that we don't see the end of the
[52:03] the light at the end but we know God
[52:05] that you are the light and you bring
[52:07] that light to our lives even if it's
[52:09] just one step at a time yes God bless us
[52:12] with your word today speak to us from it
[52:15] may your Holy Spirit have the
[52:17] preeminence once again in this service
[52:19] and Lord just breathe on us through this
[52:21] place as you wave through it as you did
[52:23] on the day of Pentecost and Lord Lift us
[52:26] up and bring us to that place Lord of
[52:28] power and demonstration of your spirit
[52:30] Lord to do the exceeding abundantly
[52:33] above all that we could ever ask or even
[52:35] think Lord bless these that have come
[52:37] Lord bless those who may be listening
[52:39] watching Lord streaming today God may
[52:42] your hand be upon them as well and Lord
[52:44] I pray that you'd have whatever your
[52:46] perfect will would be to be said here
[52:48] Lord through these lips heard through
[52:50] our ears and Anointed God to to bless us
[52:54] and to come a part of our lives and Lord
[52:57] just to grow more like you every day yes
[52:59] I believe we're staring down the end of
[53:02] this road Lord and staring down the end
[53:04] of time and Lord where I believe that we
[53:07] as a brider about to go home I said this
[53:09] last year I said it the year before I'll
[53:11] say it this year I believe this is the
[53:13] year of the coming of the Lord yeah amen
[53:16] and if it doesn't happen this year Lord
[53:18] I will be looking for you next year yes
[53:20] even more fervently yes Lord so may you
[53:23] bless us now this beginning of this New
[53:25] Year 1 1 23 God may you bless us and
[53:29] strengthen and help us again for this
[53:31] journey and for this word and this
[53:33] service here today we commit it to you
[53:35] we rebuke every demonic spirit that try
[53:38] to hurt hinder infiltrate this service
[53:40] in any way that you get the glory and
[53:42] the praise for all that is said and done
[53:44] and we commit it to you now in the name
[53:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[53:50] in Genesis 1 1 and 2 in the beginning
[53:53] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[53:55] the Earth was without form and void and
[53:57] darkness is upon the face of the deep
[53:58] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[54:01] the waters amen you could be seated
[54:04] that beginning men as we've said many
[54:07] times that beginning was the beginning
[54:09] that we know of as a beginning although
[54:11] God himself never had a beginning but we
[54:14] as humans can't fathom not having a
[54:16] beginning so as the scripture begins in
[54:19] us as Mortals uh so that we can
[54:23] tag something to it a beginning point in
[54:27] the beginning so that's where we're at
[54:29] here in our new beginning and the new
[54:31] beginnings that we've talked about from
[54:32] the beginning of this series amen now
[54:34] the last time uh we had gotten through
[54:37] uh Gog and Magog we had gotten through
[54:40] the burning over of the earth amen and
[54:43] the purification of the earth and red
[54:46] word the scripture talked about it where
[54:48] brother Brandon mentioned that even the
[54:50] atmospheres would explode every germ
[54:53] every disease every sin everything that
[54:56] has anything to do with Satan or uh uh
[55:00] the the sin and degradation of life will
[55:02] be completely wiped away purified
[55:05] annihilated and God will come and set
[55:08] his kingdom upon this Earth yes but
[55:11] before he does that there has to be that
[55:13] time of judgment and that's the time
[55:16] that we're at here now so we go to
[55:17] Revelation chapter 20. again we're going
[55:20] to start with verse 7.
[55:24] and we're going to start into the white
[55:28] Throne judgment there's going to be
[55:30] probably two or three services uh that
[55:34] would incorporate these few scriptures
[55:36] here before we actually get into the new
[55:38] city
[55:40] there's several nuances and things that
[55:43] I feel to talk about that are in this
[55:46] portion of the scripture here so we're
[55:48] going to begin with verse 7 Revelation
[55:51] 20 and verse 7 so I will background just
[55:55] a little bit as we did with Gog and
[55:57] Magog uh beginning with verse 7 as we
[55:59] read here
[56:01] and when the thousand years are expired
[56:03] Satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[56:06] and shall go out to deceive the Nations
[56:09] which are in the four quarters of the
[56:11] earth Gog and Magog to gather them
[56:13] together to battle
[56:15] the number of hoon is as the sand of the
[56:18] sea again quite a large number of people
[56:22] when the scripture describes them in
[56:25] such a number that there would be as the
[56:27] Sands of the sea amen that's a lot
[56:30] because you it would have a very
[56:33] challenging time to go out to the ocean
[56:35] and try to count the Grans of grains of
[56:37] sand that are on the ocean uh just as it
[56:41] would be for the people that are going
[56:43] to be at this time obviously it's just
[56:45] an analogy of what it the the numbers
[56:49] will be but people sometimes uh forget
[56:53] about the fact that uh how our
[56:57] population has just grown here under
[56:58] normal circumstances uh I looked it up
[57:01] and in 1900 uh which was a thousand
[57:06] years ago approximately they were there
[57:08] was about uh less than two billion
[57:11] people
[57:12] on the earth how they know that I don't
[57:15] know because I don't know how you could
[57:17] count that considering we didn't have
[57:20] all the technology that we have today
[57:22] but that's what the statistics say there
[57:25] was less than two billion people and now
[57:28] in the year two thousand one thousand
[57:30] years later there was over 6 billion
[57:33] people
[57:34] in a thousand years it gained over 4
[57:37] billion people just under normal
[57:40] conditions of Satan's Eden including
[57:43] pestilence and famines that killed
[57:45] people by the millions of wars that
[57:47] killed people by the thousands see those
[57:50] things won't exist at that time Satan
[57:52] will be locked away germs diseases the
[57:55] the wars and all those things that this
[57:57] would be a time of Peace even to those
[57:59] that are outside of the city it'll be a
[58:01] time of Peace uh but they continue to
[58:04] multiply they continue to grow and get
[58:07] to that place on a normal normal
[58:09] circumstances it grew 4 billion now in
[58:12] the past 20 years it's grown another 2
[58:16] billion just in 20 years so because
[58:19] we're right at 8 billion I think is it
[58:21] so uh that it the Earth is getting to
[58:24] the place that it is unsustainable for
[58:28] the number of people that are here uh if
[58:31] you if you go down now and all the
[58:33] people that's moved into this Valley
[58:34] into Phoenix and Tucson and and the dry
[58:38] areas and you can go down to Yuma and
[58:41] see where the river used to go down
[58:42] through the Colorado River used to go
[58:44] down between Arizona and California and
[58:46] go and flow through uh Yuma down into
[58:49] Mexico it's a trickle now but you can
[58:52] see the walled Banks like what it used
[58:54] to be huge used to be a huge flowy River
[58:57] but all that water is being sucked out
[58:58] now I don't know what the poor people
[59:01] that were depending on it down in Mexico
[59:03] I don't know what they're doing nowadays
[59:04] but it's getting to the places really
[59:07] becoming unsustainable but you see how
[59:09] the population can multiply you see well
[59:12] how could it be the Sands of the sea
[59:14] well we look right here it can be
[59:16] because uh the procreation just
[59:19] continues and continues like it would be
[59:21] as the Sands that are on the sea went up
[59:24] upon the breadth of the earth and
[59:26] compassed the camp the Beloved City that
[59:29] camp of the Saints about and the Beloved
[59:31] City but then fire as they encamped
[59:34] around it that fire of God came down and
[59:37] devoured them all amen we read where
[59:40] brother bam said the bride those that
[59:42] are in that Millennium Place that
[59:44] beloved city as it said who are taken
[59:46] away again uh that God just completely
[59:49] Burns that's my opinion doesn't say here
[59:51] I don't know that brother Brown that I
[59:54] can find any way that there's a specific
[59:56] time that brother Madam says that that
[59:58] actually happens but we no one have seen
[1:00:01] scripturally it could not have been
[1:00:03] before the Millennium and obviously we
[1:00:05] know it's not going to be during the
[1:00:06] Millennium so the place that I believe
[1:00:09] that this uh complete purification as II
[1:00:12] Peter tells us is going to happen is
[1:00:14] going to happen after the Millennium at
[1:00:17] this time where God rains down from
[1:00:19] heaven this fire and brimstone it it it
[1:00:22] destroys him annihilates them but then
[1:00:25] it completely changes the Earth again
[1:00:29] completely changes the Earth even under
[1:00:31] the Earth will be exploding and all the
[1:00:34] gases and the the you think these
[1:00:37] volcanoes you see around in uh Hawaii
[1:00:40] and things or something and people gasp
[1:00:41] at those this that that's that's a toy
[1:00:44] compared to what's going to happen when
[1:00:46] this whole earth begins to belch
[1:00:48] underneath it and explode from the
[1:00:50] bottom up uh it's going to be quite a
[1:00:52] destruction but it's got to be that way
[1:00:54] because the fire is what purifies
[1:00:56] everything even today we know fire is a
[1:01:00] purifier uh back in the day years ago my
[1:01:04] parents if they wanted to purify a
[1:01:06] needle for some reason
[1:01:08] uh that it was we're gonna use your skin
[1:01:11] or something for alcohol on it and then
[1:01:13] they put it under a over a lighter or or
[1:01:16] a flame not a lighter my parents didn't
[1:01:18] smoke but but we did have Flames
[1:01:20] lighters things for for fire and they
[1:01:22] would and they would purify that needle
[1:01:24] with fire that's that's how they did I
[1:01:27] guess they got all kinds of different
[1:01:28] ways now to do it but fire is the best
[1:01:30] purifier there is so the fire is going
[1:01:32] to completely purify the Earth change
[1:01:34] the earth set the Earth back upright
[1:01:36] again it's going to be in its perfect
[1:01:37] condition and state just like God
[1:01:40] intended
[1:01:41] before even the Garden of Eden the way
[1:01:44] God intended it to be amen is going to
[1:01:47] be at that place brought back to that
[1:01:49] place again 10th first now and the devil
[1:01:52] that deceived them was cast into the
[1:01:54] lake of fire and brimstone where the
[1:01:57] beasts and the false prophet are and
[1:01:59] shall be tormented day and night forever
[1:02:01] and ever now notice we know that that
[1:02:04] does not happen and it cannot happen as
[1:02:07] a just God until after the Judgment God
[1:02:12] doesn't judge anybody even Satan to hell
[1:02:15] until he actually gives them a fair
[1:02:18] judgment yes amen which is what the
[1:02:21] white Throne judgment does so you you
[1:02:24] notice that the scripture and you but
[1:02:27] you've got to know the scripture enough
[1:02:28] to follow the flow of continuity in the
[1:02:31] scripture to know that when when a man
[1:02:35] like John writes this and God allowed
[1:02:38] people like John the Revelator to write
[1:02:40] Revelations to to bring it in a way that
[1:02:43] it would confound people because if you
[1:02:46] read this just on face value you would
[1:02:48] think that at that moment in time is
[1:02:50] exactly when it happened but when you
[1:02:53] bring into context of their scripture
[1:02:55] and you recognize the kind of
[1:02:58] deity that God is that he doesn't he
[1:03:01] doesn't pronounce judgment on anybody
[1:03:04] except first that there is a a judgment
[1:03:07] amen there's got to be a God's got to
[1:03:10] find that person the place to be able to
[1:03:12] receive a fair trial before he sentenced
[1:03:15] them God's not an unjust cause and he's
[1:03:19] going to have a fair trial before he
[1:03:21] sentences anybody even the devil amen
[1:03:25] who at one time of course was brother
[1:03:26] man said was God's right-hand man he was
[1:03:28] the cherubim he was an angel that was
[1:03:31] created by God that turned Lucifer that
[1:03:33] turned into the red dragon the devil uh
[1:03:36] the Beast
[1:03:38] uh all these things so if you I think
[1:03:41] that's honestly I I personally think
[1:03:43] that's where a lot of people get
[1:03:45] confused even in the seals uh that's a
[1:03:48] whole nother series and a whole nother
[1:03:49] topic but to me when you hear people
[1:03:53] preach about that and things that come
[1:03:56] off of that uh you can recognize look
[1:03:59] I I I'll just say I've heard people
[1:04:02] teach on the seals and and when I hear
[1:04:05] some things that said and and God rings
[1:04:09] that Bell to me that you know brother
[1:04:11] green always told us that's the Holy
[1:04:13] Ghost now listen but I still call it
[1:04:15] that Bell that's in me when it goes off
[1:04:18] then I go and I look now something's not
[1:04:20] right because what he's saying doesn't
[1:04:22] flow in the continuity of scripture
[1:04:24] right it has to flow in continuity of
[1:04:27] scripture or it can't be right right God
[1:04:30] is not he's not going to put the cow in
[1:04:33] the tree picking grass
[1:04:35] uh he he's he's not gonna uh
[1:04:39] grow potatoes out of an oak tree uh God
[1:04:43] has a way of doing things he created it
[1:04:45] and he started it and it flows in the
[1:04:48] continuity it is in even to body like an
[1:04:50] animal life and it operates today just
[1:04:54] like it was when God said let there be
[1:04:56] it operates today the same way outside
[1:04:59] of the fact that the fault changed
[1:05:02] things after the fall they changed but
[1:05:04] they continued to operate in the same
[1:05:06] way
[1:05:07] because they were created by God the
[1:05:09] scripture is the same way amen Heaven
[1:05:12] and Earth will pass away the scripture
[1:05:13] cannot and that pass away is again
[1:05:15] Heaven and Earth will change from one
[1:05:18] form to another we just talked about
[1:05:20] that the atmospheres will even explode
[1:05:22] yes the atmospheres the Earth Heaven and
[1:05:24] Earth will change we'll we'll pass away
[1:05:26] or be changed but his word cannot change
[1:05:29] yeah so it's got to flow in the
[1:05:32] continuity of the scripture if it
[1:05:34] doesn't something's wrong right and
[1:05:36] there's nothing wrong with the message
[1:05:37] and there's nothing wrong with the
[1:05:39] scripture so where's the problem
[1:05:42] it would be neat or you or whatever your
[1:05:46] interpretation or whatever that Minister
[1:05:48] that person's interpretation of that
[1:05:50] scripture is it has to flow in the
[1:05:52] continuity of the scripture and the only
[1:05:54] way to know that is to know the
[1:05:56] scripture
[1:05:57] is to know the word that's why we are to
[1:05:59] read and pray and amen search the
[1:06:02] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:06:03] have eternal life see we know what the
[1:06:06] continuity the flow of the scripture is
[1:06:08] and how God operates and this is if we
[1:06:12] put God putting them in Hell before
[1:06:14] there's a trial that does not flow in
[1:06:17] the continuity of scripture right it
[1:06:20] doesn't flow with the personality of the
[1:06:22] way that God is who he is and how he
[1:06:25] operates it doesn't
[1:06:27] and if you look at a lot of other things
[1:06:29] that that people try to bring about and
[1:06:31] say oh it sounds good you know and you
[1:06:33] can try to fit it in there and oh my
[1:06:35] yeah that six seal fifth seal seven seal
[1:06:38] and the coming of the Lord and those
[1:06:39] things if you don't get it into the
[1:06:41] continuity and flow of scripture and the
[1:06:44] way that the scripture all the way
[1:06:45] through not just one quote not just one
[1:06:48] scripture not just something out of uh
[1:06:51] out of one message that brother Brandon
[1:06:53] may have been talking about could it
[1:06:56] possibly be like uh services this the
[1:06:59] time
[1:07:00] uh a soul is in prison now
[1:07:03] then we get the scripture out of
[1:07:05] continuity you can't do that right amen
[1:07:07] my point in saying that is that this
[1:07:10] here as it says that they were cast into
[1:07:14] the lake of fiber and so yes but not
[1:07:16] right then
[1:07:18] amen not as the continuity not as this
[1:07:21] scripture is reading yet because there
[1:07:23] hasn't been a white Throne judgment yet
[1:07:26] amen do you understand that's that's
[1:07:29] that probably may be a long way around
[1:07:30] but it was something that was burning in
[1:07:32] me to try to get across to understand me
[1:07:35] you can't you look at it and say well
[1:07:37] that's what the Bible says but if you
[1:07:39] don't follow it when the Co in the
[1:07:41] continuity of the entirety of the
[1:07:43] scripture you get it out of place
[1:07:46] amen and we must not misplace the word
[1:07:49] yes Amen brother around it's one of the
[1:07:52] must not we must not misplace the words
[1:07:54] we gotta place it where it belongs amen
[1:07:57] now let's keep going 11th verse and I
[1:08:00] saw a great white Throne judgment now
[1:08:02] it's being set up here
[1:08:04] I saw a great white Throne judgment a
[1:08:07] great uh White throne and him that sat
[1:08:09] on him from whom's face uh whose face
[1:08:13] the Earth and Heaven fled away people
[1:08:16] still do amen
[1:08:18] you mentioned God to a lot of people
[1:08:20] today they don't want to hear it amen
[1:08:22] ridicule you put you down old-fashioned
[1:08:24] whatever they want to say
[1:08:26] flat away
[1:08:27] and there was uh there was found no
[1:08:30] place for them
[1:08:32] now
[1:08:33] a couple of references
[1:08:36] one is when I believe it's Ephesians
[1:08:40] tells us that we are to give no place
[1:08:46] for the devil yes Greg
[1:08:49] that no place means that in your life
[1:08:53] the the devil would have no place to
[1:08:57] infiltrate you in your life don't give
[1:09:01] place to the devil don't allow your life
[1:09:03] to be operated or lived in a way that it
[1:09:06] allows the devil to come and do
[1:09:09] something in your life or or influence
[1:09:11] you a certain way or or try to get you
[1:09:13] to do something you shouldn't do or
[1:09:15] something to that effect don't even give
[1:09:17] place to them don't open that door to
[1:09:20] where Satan can come in and and confuse
[1:09:23] you or get you to doubt or to get you to
[1:09:26] disbeliever to get you to sin or do
[1:09:28] something you know you shouldn't do
[1:09:29] don't even give him the opportunity
[1:09:32] the other place is in Revelation 12.
[1:09:35] when Satan took unpreached to a third of
[1:09:38] the angels in heaven and deceived them
[1:09:39] and there was war between Satan and
[1:09:42] Michael there came a place that when the
[1:09:44] devil lost that battle that Dragon lost
[1:09:47] that battle there was what no more place
[1:09:50] found for him in heaven amen what does
[1:09:53] that mean he had to fall down he had to
[1:09:56] be diminished or brought down from his
[1:10:00] position of cherubim light bearer
[1:10:03] right-hand man of God he had to so in in
[1:10:07] that economy of Heaven there was no more
[1:10:11] place for him
[1:10:13] he could not it's like can I make I can
[1:10:17] make it a little carnal
[1:10:18] let's just make it a little carnal for a
[1:10:20] minute if there's a job opening at a
[1:10:22] corporation
[1:10:24] and there's a hundred people apply for
[1:10:25] that job only one person is going to get
[1:10:27] that job out of 100.
[1:10:29] well
[1:10:31] you go and apply and let's say it's for
[1:10:34] a machinist
[1:10:36] a person who knows to operate a how to
[1:10:39] operate a certain machine or certain
[1:10:41] machines or something
[1:10:42] and you come in and and they say uh well
[1:10:45] what experience have you had
[1:10:47] oh well I've dug a couple of ditches
[1:10:51] uh I I you know I I drove for Uber for a
[1:10:54] while
[1:10:56] okay well what qualifies you to operate
[1:11:00] this 20 million dollar machine
[1:11:04] I just want to no no there's no place
[1:11:07] for you at this company there's no place
[1:11:10] for you at this job
[1:11:12] amen you don't qualify
[1:11:15] that make sense there's no place found
[1:11:18] in heaven for Satan anymore there was a
[1:11:20] place for him at one time when God
[1:11:22] created him and he was Lucifer he had
[1:11:24] his position he had his placement but
[1:11:26] when there was no place found in heaven
[1:11:28] he was what him and his angels were cast
[1:11:31] down on the Earth
[1:11:33] amen now we see here the same verbiage
[1:11:37] and there was no more place for them
[1:11:41] there's no more position for them to
[1:11:44] hold there's it's just like in the
[1:11:46] Millennium when Satan was bound by the
[1:11:49] chain of circumstance
[1:11:51] why because there was no place for him
[1:11:55] there was nobody he could operate in or
[1:11:58] work through
[1:12:00] so there's no place for him well here
[1:12:03] the finalization of it at the white
[1:12:05] Throne judgment him that sat on Whose
[1:12:07] face that heaven uh the earth and the
[1:12:09] heaven fled away and there was no place
[1:12:12] found no place for them
[1:12:15] no place
[1:12:17] so you've got a position here you got
[1:12:20] the Bride of Jesus Christ you got his
[1:12:23] children the Jews and the hundred and
[1:12:24] forty four thousand and you've got those
[1:12:27] that are uh
[1:12:29] well we'll get to it and you had let's
[1:12:32] just say this scripturally you have that
[1:12:34] place for the wise virgins
[1:12:36] the bride you had that place for those
[1:12:39] 144 000 the Jews those that are blinded
[1:12:41] you had that and you had that place for
[1:12:44] the foolish virgins
[1:12:46] they have their place
[1:12:48] I understand but here those that come
[1:12:52] forth that did that do not fall in
[1:12:56] either of those categories there's no
[1:12:58] place for them
[1:13:00] so what happens when there's no place
[1:13:03] found for them
[1:13:04] they're cast down just like Satan and
[1:13:07] his angels from Heaven to Earth they are
[1:13:10] cast down to a lower position and where
[1:13:13] is that
[1:13:15] that's
[1:13:16] their final resting their final judgment
[1:13:19] I say resting they're not going to rest
[1:13:20] it's their final place of judgment right
[1:13:23] it's it's it's it's the fire of God that
[1:13:26] God created people say hell I'm trying
[1:13:29] to avoid the word of hell because Hades
[1:13:30] in the Bible just means uh uh uh grave
[1:13:33] and as we start continue to read through
[1:13:36] this scripture it becomes very Paramount
[1:13:38] to understand that the vernacular that
[1:13:41] we use in the scripture for hell Hades
[1:13:43] just means the grave
[1:13:45] amen so I'm trying to get us to see when
[1:13:50] it talks about the lake of fire and
[1:13:52] brimstone that place where God sends
[1:13:56] those that have no place
[1:13:58] there's found no place that they didn't
[1:14:01] fall into this category they didn't fall
[1:14:03] into this category they didn't fall into
[1:14:05] this category so there's no place for
[1:14:08] them right what happens when there's no
[1:14:10] place for them they go to a lower region
[1:14:13] what's the lower region that's left from
[1:14:15] here the lower region that's left is the
[1:14:17] lake of fire and brimstone that's all
[1:14:20] that's left
[1:14:21] unfortunately there'll be people that
[1:14:23] fall under that category just like Satan
[1:14:26] just like the Beast just like the false
[1:14:28] prophet they will all be cast into that
[1:14:31] Lake of Fire
[1:14:32] just like those who have who there is no
[1:14:35] place found for them
[1:14:37] unfortunately the same place now we know
[1:14:43] um
[1:14:44] that in verse 5 I want to go back to
[1:14:47] verse 5 real quick before we continue on
[1:14:50] we know that in verse 5 also at the end
[1:14:54] of this Thousand Years
[1:14:55] let's just read it at the end of the
[1:14:57] Thousand Years the rest of the Dead live
[1:15:00] not again until the thousand years were
[1:15:03] finished amen now the bride those that
[1:15:06] are in the Millennium they come up in
[1:15:08] that first resurrection
[1:15:10] or they're a part of that that they go
[1:15:13] into the Millennium from the bride's
[1:15:14] supper or wherever it may place them see
[1:15:18] uh they're the ones that are in that
[1:15:21] place and the others that die lay in the
[1:15:25] grave lay in that place of waiting wait
[1:15:28] in the regions of the Lost
[1:15:30] because it weren't bride uh for that
[1:15:33] thousand years so the rest of them uh
[1:15:37] lived not until the thousand years were
[1:15:39] finished but after the thousand years
[1:15:42] are finished
[1:15:43] is the resurrection of the rest amen the
[1:15:47] rest of the Dead that are resurrected at
[1:15:50] that point after the Thousand Years then
[1:15:52] all of humanity comes forth
[1:15:55] everyone that was ever born everyone
[1:15:58] that ever came forth comes to this place
[1:16:01] now
[1:16:02] all human
[1:16:04] every knee about every tongue will
[1:16:07] confess is not an acronym it is a fact
[1:16:10] amen it is something that will happen
[1:16:12] and take place
[1:16:14] because notice we'll read a scripture in
[1:16:16] a minute God placed into the position of
[1:16:21] Jesus Christ now people want to make him
[1:16:23] a different person no
[1:16:24] the position of Jesus Christ into that
[1:16:27] place of judgment
[1:16:29] different for for uh reasons that we'll
[1:16:33] get to in a minute but that position
[1:16:36] that God had the position of the son
[1:16:39] Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] do the judgment
[1:16:43] because the bride his wife is there in
[1:16:48] judgment with him
[1:16:50] she sets with him in that throne
[1:16:55] one reason God does that as the son do
[1:16:58] it the other is that he was the kinsman
[1:17:01] redeemer amen and the body of Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ as he was here on Earth became
[1:17:07] our kinsman redeemer now I find it
[1:17:11] sometimes challenging when you try to
[1:17:14] counsel people and and probably all of
[1:17:16] you at some point uh adults have tried
[1:17:19] to help somebody or counsel somebody
[1:17:21] who's grieving or has lost a loved one
[1:17:23] or a a job or or finances or something
[1:17:28] you try to help them or console them or
[1:17:30] or talk to that person uh counsel them
[1:17:33] in some way sometimes it's hard you say
[1:17:36] well I know how you feel you know
[1:17:38] uh you you probably don't I know how
[1:17:42] they feel but that becomes like the
[1:17:45] go-to line that people say
[1:17:47] well I know how you feel now people what
[1:17:51] our our first son passed away we had a
[1:17:54] lot of that
[1:17:55] people would come up and say oh I know
[1:17:57] how you feel and most of the time I was
[1:17:59] very gracious and understanding and say
[1:18:01] I appreciate that
[1:18:03] sometimes I'd say have you lost a child
[1:18:07] right well no well then how could you
[1:18:10] how could you possibly understand how I
[1:18:12] feel okay
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:15] do you see what I'm saying yes Jesus
[1:18:18] Christ walked in this earth in a body of
[1:18:20] Flesh as our kingdom Redeemer he
[1:18:23] suffered loss he suffered sickness he
[1:18:25] suffered or what it is Humanity uh
[1:18:30] know about sickness but hunger uh he
[1:18:33] knew what it was like to not be wanted
[1:18:34] he knew what it was like to be rejected
[1:18:37] by his own people he knew what it was
[1:18:39] like to sleep outside without a pillow
[1:18:42] or a blanket he knew what it was like to
[1:18:44] be invited to a party that nobody wanted
[1:18:46] him at
[1:18:48] he knew what it was like
[1:18:50] he knew what it was like to have a
[1:18:52] headache why because somebody shoved
[1:18:53] that crime of thorns and pierced into
[1:18:55] his skull he knew what it was like to
[1:18:58] have a backache because he drugged that
[1:18:59] however many 100 pound cross up a
[1:19:03] cobblestone Road
[1:19:05] he knew what it was like to be whipped
[1:19:07] and beaten so when you go to him and say
[1:19:09] Lord help my backache he knows exactly
[1:19:12] how you feel right
[1:19:14] won't say Lord help my headache he knows
[1:19:16] exactly how you feel
[1:19:18] you say Lord help me in my lost he knows
[1:19:21] exactly how you feel Lord help me in my
[1:19:23] destitute he knows exactly how you feel
[1:19:25] help me with the friends or family and
[1:19:27] people don't love me he knows exactly
[1:19:29] how you feel he's been there he's been
[1:19:31] through it
[1:19:33] amen he knows how you feel
[1:19:36] so the son is in place it's placing in
[1:19:40] Trust of that place of judgment because
[1:19:43] he knows
[1:19:44] he's been there and people come forth
[1:19:47] and say but
[1:19:49] there's no buts
[1:19:52] every human ever walked this ball of
[1:19:54] dirt had the same opportunity as you and
[1:19:56] I do to receive him
[1:19:59] everyone
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:02] a few received him like us many reject
[1:20:05] him
[1:20:06] they didn't want him
[1:20:08] and they could come up with all excuses
[1:20:10] they want but but Jesus knows
[1:20:13] amen he knows he's been there he's gone
[1:20:16] through it
[1:20:17] amen so when even a foolish virgin comes
[1:20:20] forth I'm getting a little ahead of
[1:20:22] myself because I didn't want to talk
[1:20:23] about this until later
[1:20:25] but even when a foolish virgin would
[1:20:27] come forth
[1:20:29] and remember Revelation uh Matthew 25
[1:20:32] well God separates the sheep from the
[1:20:34] goats
[1:20:36] that's not the bride
[1:20:38] the bride's not the Sheep separated the
[1:20:41] bride is setting on the throne with him
[1:20:42] yeah in judgment yes right that's not
[1:20:45] the bride right that's the foolish
[1:20:47] virgin yes that setting there that God
[1:20:49] and God gets to the understanding
[1:20:53] of that person and that person's life or
[1:20:57] what they did or how they gave maybe
[1:20:59] even the tribulation they they now
[1:21:02] there's foolish virgin in every age so
[1:21:06] people talk about the foolish version
[1:21:08] almost like it's only going to be
[1:21:09] through the tribulation no no there's
[1:21:11] foolish virgin in every age
[1:21:13] but just for example if they gave their
[1:21:16] lives in Mortimer they sealed their
[1:21:18] testimony with their blood during the
[1:21:20] tribulation
[1:21:22] one of those scenarios Jesus would
[1:21:25] understand that
[1:21:26] see he's a just God he's a fair God he's
[1:21:30] a reasonable God
[1:21:31] he God's yes he is a god of wrath and
[1:21:34] judgment but God's a god of compassion
[1:21:37] and love too
[1:21:39] amen his his Jesus the Bible said that
[1:21:43] Jesus the man Jesus personal will his
[1:21:47] human will same as mine wish that nobody
[1:21:51] would go to hell that everybody would
[1:21:54] come to repentance I wish the same thing
[1:21:57] Jesus wished that that was in his by his
[1:22:01] will but he doesn't predestinate based
[1:22:03] on his will he predestinates based on
[1:22:05] his foreknowledge right he knew before
[1:22:09] it ever began who would and who wouldn't
[1:22:11] thus the predestination of God by
[1:22:14] election stands
[1:22:15] only way it does stand not by his will
[1:22:18] if it was by his will it be like my will
[1:22:21] the native everybody could but it has to
[1:22:24] be a just thought only way he can be a
[1:22:26] just God amen
[1:22:29] now when these people come up
[1:22:33] from from that a lot from that second
[1:22:35] Resurrection having been in the holding
[1:22:38] Place regions of the loss for that
[1:22:41] Thousand Years
[1:22:42] in Bodies In The Grave
[1:22:45] he said and I saw the dead small and
[1:22:49] great stand before God
[1:22:52] you say well that Bible just says they
[1:22:54] stood before God
[1:22:56] well
[1:22:58] so where's the prize
[1:23:00] well isn't she become him
[1:23:04] amen you read all through the scripture
[1:23:07] you can see when it talks about a king
[1:23:09] and a queen very rarely does it talk
[1:23:11] about a queen being there
[1:23:14] he said he
[1:23:16] well what is she
[1:23:19] she is just a representation of him
[1:23:23] she has just become him
[1:23:25] she's just an extension of him
[1:23:28] so when it mentions him it's mentioning
[1:23:32] her at the same time whether it
[1:23:35] verbalizes it or has it here or not when
[1:23:38] it says him it's talking about him and
[1:23:41] her
[1:23:42] and we'll prove that scripturally in a
[1:23:43] few minutes
[1:23:45] step before God and the books were open
[1:23:48] and another book was open which is The
[1:23:50] Book of Life and we'll the books which
[1:23:53] we have talked about it in the past I
[1:23:55] believe we were probably on the portera
[1:23:57] at the Cortaro Church
[1:23:59] um but I want to go through that again a
[1:24:01] little bit maybe not in the same detail
[1:24:03] and talk about these books again so
[1:24:05] that'll be a whole nother service so
[1:24:07] just hold that and wait the books were
[1:24:09] open another book was open which is The
[1:24:11] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[1:24:14] out of those things which were written
[1:24:16] in the books according to their Works
[1:24:19] written in those books are the works of
[1:24:23] the individuals and the individual will
[1:24:27] be judged in the same body
[1:24:30] that they did these works
[1:24:34] The Works will be in the book the person
[1:24:37] will be judged in the body by which they
[1:24:40] were judged by and by which they
[1:24:42] committed these acts
[1:24:44] the things of life
[1:24:46] that God writes down and Records
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:50] these books will be open and they will
[1:24:53] be judged out of those books brother
[1:24:55] random even talked about uh at a point
[1:24:58] that a a screen will come up and
[1:25:00] somebody said well uh they might try to
[1:25:03] make an excuse or try to say well this
[1:25:05] didn't or that you know someone said
[1:25:07] you see it right here and play it right
[1:25:10] back for them to see it for everybody's
[1:25:11] standing there to watch and see exactly
[1:25:13] what happened and how it happened
[1:25:14] probably even to the intent of the
[1:25:16] person's heart or thoughts that that did
[1:25:18] the act right
[1:25:20] because it's a judgment it's a place
[1:25:23] where nothing is hid friend in that
[1:25:26] light nothing is here the deep dark
[1:25:29] secrets of an individual's heart will be
[1:25:32] exposed will be revealed will be made
[1:25:34] known there's no place to hide there's
[1:25:37] nothing you can hide even in the depths
[1:25:39] of your heart or in the back of your
[1:25:41] mind it can't be held it can't be hid
[1:25:43] from God it'll be revealed it will be
[1:25:46] shown
[1:25:47] and they will know
[1:25:49] amen they'll show out of these books
[1:25:52] that God has written and again we'll
[1:25:54] talk about that later according to their
[1:25:57] words
[1:25:58] amen now according to their works well
[1:26:02] we'll just get to the other in a minute
[1:26:03] and the Sea gave up the dead which were
[1:26:05] in it and the dead and death and Hell
[1:26:09] delivered up the dead because remember
[1:26:12] death and hell were both conquered
[1:26:14] when Jesus Christ died he went to hell
[1:26:17] he uh and he rose from the dead he
[1:26:20] conquered death and Hell
[1:26:22] and then he had he had the keys of death
[1:26:25] hell in the grave
[1:26:27] because he conquered them so as he
[1:26:30] conquered them death and Hell delivered
[1:26:33] up the dead they what because they could
[1:26:35] no longer hold them
[1:26:37] because
[1:26:39] the bill that was due when Jesus died at
[1:26:42] Calvary has now come due
[1:26:46] the the act that Jesus performed at
[1:26:49] Calvary
[1:26:51] that purchase our Redemption even though
[1:26:55] we're still in these sin bodies comes to
[1:26:57] comes due here
[1:27:00] Satan can no longer hold grips on him
[1:27:03] Satan can no longer hold grips on the
[1:27:05] earth because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] dripped on this Earth and bought it back
[1:27:08] he can no longer hold claims on us
[1:27:12] on this on the word on life of of
[1:27:16] anything he has no rights to anybody
[1:27:19] at all even the ones that he deceived in
[1:27:22] the following him he has no rights to
[1:27:25] them
[1:27:26] death and Hell have to give up the Dead
[1:27:29] because they were conquered
[1:27:32] which were in them and they were judged
[1:27:34] every man according to their works and
[1:27:37] death and hell now were cast into the
[1:27:39] Lake of Fire
[1:27:40] which is the second death
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:44] death and Hell Now cast because they've
[1:27:46] been conquered
[1:27:48] they've been done away with so when we
[1:27:50] get over to this new city
[1:27:52] amen death one exists
[1:27:55] the grave won't exist
[1:27:58] these things will be devoid from our
[1:28:00] lives because they they will they no
[1:28:03] longer exist
[1:28:05] only those that God had created this
[1:28:09] Lake of Fire for and those that are in
[1:28:11] it will be uh in that place in that
[1:28:15] position now it won't be for eternity
[1:28:18] uh we may talk about this greater in
[1:28:20] length at another time but death uh hell
[1:28:24] is not forever people you hear people
[1:28:26] say well uh you know people live
[1:28:30] eternally in Hell they'll they'll
[1:28:31] they'll they'll burn eternally no they
[1:28:34] won't
[1:28:34] no hell was created
[1:28:37] and anything or say the Lake of Fire was
[1:28:40] created and anything that has been
[1:28:43] created will have an end yeah
[1:28:46] yeah amen anything that's created has to
[1:28:49] have an end to it if it had a beginning
[1:28:52] it has to have an end
[1:28:54] amen only thing that is eternal is
[1:28:57] something that never began and the Bible
[1:29:00] says that God created hell for Satan and
[1:29:04] his angels his followers well if it was
[1:29:07] created it can't last forever
[1:29:10] and if a person in hell has eternal life
[1:29:13] they should be in heaven not in hell
[1:29:15] because the only form of eternal life
[1:29:17] there is is God's light and how you're
[1:29:19] going to have God's life and be in hell
[1:29:21] right
[1:29:22] right amen so it can't be Eternal that
[1:29:24] might be for years and thousands of
[1:29:27] years it might even be a a very long
[1:29:30] extended period of time as the Bible
[1:29:32] tells us it is but it won't be Eternal
[1:29:35] right it won't continue perpetually just
[1:29:39] in existence it can't it will be done
[1:29:41] away with at some point
[1:29:43] everyone that's in it and the Lake of
[1:29:46] Fire and all itself will be annihilated
[1:29:48] at some point will no longer exist amen
[1:29:50] because it can't
[1:29:52] because it was again created
[1:29:54] the sea gave up the dead which were in
[1:29:57] it
[1:29:58] and death and Hell delivered up the dead
[1:30:00] which were in them they were judged
[1:30:01] every man according to their words and
[1:30:03] death and hell were cast into the Lake
[1:30:04] of Fire this is the second death and
[1:30:07] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:30:09] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:30:12] Fire now I want to go to another
[1:30:13] scripture and and bolster this point
[1:30:16] Daniel chapter 7
[1:30:23] Daniel chapter 7. I just read it a
[1:30:25] couple of verses here
[1:30:28] and then I want to get to one main point
[1:30:31] that I want to
[1:30:32] drive home today and then we'll we'll uh
[1:30:35] close
[1:30:36] but Daniel chapter 7
[1:30:39] verses 9 and 10.
[1:30:42] Daniel 7 9 10. I beheld to the Thrones
[1:30:46] were cast down
[1:30:48] and the Ancient of Days did sit
[1:30:51] on the white throne
[1:30:54] whose garment was white as snow
[1:30:57] and the hair of his head like the pure
[1:31:00] wool
[1:31:01] his throne was like the fiery flame and
[1:31:04] his wheels as burning fire
[1:31:07] now notice
[1:31:10] brother Ram talked about this hair
[1:31:12] whitest wolf from Revelation and he
[1:31:14] called Jack Moore and asked you and he
[1:31:16] said well that was his glorified body
[1:31:17] and brother Branham said that didn't
[1:31:18] ring brother Branham said that didn't
[1:31:20] ring the bell so I guess it's okay for
[1:31:24] me to say too he said that that just
[1:31:26] came to me he said that didn't ring the
[1:31:28] bell so he said I went to prayer and I
[1:31:31] started asking God and seeking the
[1:31:32] scripture find out and find out
[1:31:35] that that was God in his place of
[1:31:37] judgment
[1:31:39] amen that was Jesus in his place of
[1:31:41] judgment like the judges the old judges
[1:31:44] of of England in those places they
[1:31:46] before they went out to their judgment
[1:31:49] seat they put on a white wig right uh
[1:31:52] that I don't do it anymore but they used
[1:31:54] to of course we don't follow scripture
[1:31:57] in anything hardly anymore even to the
[1:31:59] point of do not steal
[1:32:01] but they used to wear a white wig
[1:32:04] amen and when when when the Lord
[1:32:07] revealed this when when God showed this
[1:32:09] to brother Brandon he saw it then it
[1:32:12] become a place of Judgment at that point
[1:32:14] no longer Grace see because at that
[1:32:17] point Grace had ended it was nothing but
[1:32:19] judgment
[1:32:21] and as a judge he wore the white woman
[1:32:24] he was the white uh garments the white
[1:32:28] wig the white his hair was white as snow
[1:32:30] was in a place of judgment as he was
[1:32:33] judging pure wool and the fiery flame
[1:32:36] his throne and the wheels
[1:32:39] movement is all the wheels just means uh
[1:32:42] as burning fire a fiery stream issued
[1:32:46] and came forth from before him
[1:32:49] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[1:32:52] who would that be
[1:32:55] that'd be the bride Amen ministered on
[1:32:57] him Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands
[1:33:01] stood before him
[1:33:03] so thousands of thousands ministered but
[1:33:06] tens of thousands and tens of thousands
[1:33:09] stood before him
[1:33:11] the Judgment was set and the books were
[1:33:14] open now you you see the place set up as
[1:33:18] God sets it up
[1:33:20] how long it takes I have no idea but we
[1:33:23] will have because the white Throne
[1:33:25] judgment I if I remember right now I
[1:33:27] didn't look this up again but if I
[1:33:29] remember right brother Brown tells us
[1:33:30] the whitetown judgment is still a period
[1:33:32] of time even after the millennium we
[1:33:34] don't enter into
[1:33:36] eternity until after this point
[1:33:38] okay so because
[1:33:41] time still has well okay well thank you
[1:33:45] Lord time still has to exist because
[1:33:48] there's people there that are in time
[1:33:49] bodies
[1:33:50] they're they are they are not Eternal
[1:33:53] creatures
[1:33:55] because they're going to be cast into
[1:33:56] the Lake of Fire
[1:33:59] so there we go
[1:34:01] but
[1:34:02] we now are are in this place this white
[1:34:06] that's been set up so how long it takes
[1:34:08] again
[1:34:10] nobody knows scripture doesn't say uh
[1:34:13] but it it'll be whatever time it'll be
[1:34:17] that God has that he has set up but
[1:34:20] it'll be a place now where these ten
[1:34:22] thousands of ten thousands come before
[1:34:26] Christ and his bride those that are
[1:34:29] ministering to him amen just like just
[1:34:32] like a wife would do her husband
[1:34:34] amen just like a wife would take care of
[1:34:37] minister to her husband the wife the
[1:34:39] bride ministering to Jesus the
[1:34:42] bridegroom amen he that sets on the
[1:34:44] throne amen will be there with him ten
[1:34:48] thousands of ten thousands will be
[1:34:50] before him and the Judgment then is set
[1:34:55] judgment is ready to go
[1:34:57] and God judges everyone as we just read
[1:35:00] here judges each one out of that book
[1:35:03] according to their words amen according
[1:35:07] to their Works judgment is set up
[1:35:13] for all the for all but the bride
[1:35:15] because the bride has already been
[1:35:17] judged and been found guilty
[1:35:20] that's the last point I want to drive
[1:35:21] home here today let's read this in
[1:35:25] the god a question to answer is God
[1:35:27] being misunderstood 1960 when he said
[1:35:29] now question was about five it just says
[1:35:33] five virgins he said now with the five
[1:35:35] virgins lost that's not really an
[1:35:37] appropriate question he should have said
[1:35:39] the five foolish virgins but that's the
[1:35:42] question brother Brown said I pursue
[1:35:44] they're asked the question the five
[1:35:45] virgins the five wise and the five
[1:35:48] foolish now if you were with us in the
[1:35:51] last teachings in Revelation you find
[1:35:53] out uh those five foolish virgins were
[1:35:56] not lost
[1:35:58] virgins were not lost but they were not
[1:36:01] permitted to go to the wedding supper
[1:36:03] those are part of those that were the
[1:36:05] Thousand Years in the grave until the
[1:36:07] white Throne judgment
[1:36:09] they were not permitted to go into the
[1:36:11] wedding supper but they suffered
[1:36:13] persecution and was martyred and raised
[1:36:16] again at the general Resurrection in the
[1:36:18] last day at the at of course at the
[1:36:20] white Throne judgment those are the
[1:36:23] people
[1:36:24] those are the people where he separated
[1:36:27] the sheep from the goats they stood
[1:36:30] before the Judgment you say well brother
[1:36:33] Brown Don't We Stand the bride the
[1:36:35] church no sir we do not stand before the
[1:36:39] judgment praise the lord
[1:36:41] we are now standing before the judgment
[1:36:46] praise the Lord
[1:36:47] God put our sins upon Christ but again
[1:36:52] those that rejected Christ and the blood
[1:36:55] of Christ those sins still lay on them
[1:36:58] and are written in that book
[1:37:01] the book of their works that they had
[1:37:04] done in that body while they were here
[1:37:07] it's the only chance they have
[1:37:10] we have been born again
[1:37:13] the bride has become new creatures in
[1:37:16] Christ we no longer because we accepted
[1:37:19] Jesus Christ and his shed blood for our
[1:37:22] Redemption and for our perpetuation so
[1:37:25] we now have already been judged and
[1:37:28] found not guilty
[1:37:31] if we had not been found not guilty he
[1:37:34] would never have put his spirit
[1:37:38] if we were still guilty he would have
[1:37:40] never put his Spirit God doesn't come
[1:37:42] and put his his holy spirit in a filthy
[1:37:45] place very much so if it was judged and
[1:37:48] still found guilty God would have never
[1:37:50] God would never come and put his spirit
[1:37:52] in a filthy vessel
[1:37:54] amen so
[1:37:56] if we've been under judgment and found
[1:37:58] not guilty did God put his spirit in US
[1:38:02] the token
[1:38:04] the ticket that gets us out of here that
[1:38:07] puts the bride in the position of being
[1:38:10] bride and in the rapture because of his
[1:38:13] spirit because he found her not guilty
[1:38:17] praise the Lord put our sins upon Christ
[1:38:21] at the grave of course but then when God
[1:38:23] but when Christ went to hell because as
[1:38:26] a result of that he conquered death in
[1:38:29] Hell praise the Lord which put those
[1:38:32] sins back on Satan yes
[1:38:35] praise the Lord
[1:38:37] oh it's beautiful
[1:38:38] he that heareth my word Saint John 5 24
[1:38:41] believe him and sent me had eternal life
[1:38:44] and shall not come into the Judgment but
[1:38:47] has passed from Death unto life
[1:38:50] amen look at this the first seal notice
[1:38:54] the rest of the day the church members
[1:38:56] dead church members live not again until
[1:38:58] the thousand years and then at the
[1:39:01] thousand years they were gathered
[1:39:03] another Resurrection come which is the
[1:39:05] second Resurrection he's talking about
[1:39:07] those that come forth the dead that
[1:39:09] lived a thousand years in the second
[1:39:10] resurrection and get that understanding
[1:39:13] now those other than the bride the 144th
[1:39:16] out of those that are in the millennium
[1:39:18] beloved City everyone else that's still
[1:39:22] in that waiting Place reasons the Lost
[1:39:24] wherever those people come forth after
[1:39:27] the Thousand Years every one of them
[1:39:29] that were there come forth after that
[1:39:32] thousand years they're still in that
[1:39:33] waiting that is the second Resurrection
[1:39:37] and they were gathered and Christ and
[1:39:40] the bride he said not the church the
[1:39:43] bride Christ and her and his Queen not
[1:39:47] the church Christ and the bride stood
[1:39:50] there
[1:39:51] Christ and the bride now you say stood
[1:39:54] there
[1:39:55] he just means they're there he doesn't
[1:39:58] literally mean we were standing there
[1:40:00] because
[1:40:01] he's on his throne and we're in the
[1:40:03] throne with him
[1:40:05] amen so he says stood there again you
[1:40:09] can't take it to the actual literal of
[1:40:12] the word you got to go back to the
[1:40:14] scripture and see this is what he's
[1:40:15] talking about he didn't mean they stood
[1:40:18] there so okay
[1:40:19] I you know sometimes you just you just
[1:40:22] gotta it seems silly sometimes but
[1:40:26] people take things like that and they
[1:40:27] run with it make a Doctrine out of it
[1:40:29] and make it all things it shouldn't be
[1:40:31] and that's what I was talking about
[1:40:32] earlier about the seals and stuff and
[1:40:34] they take it and don't search through
[1:40:36] the scripture or know the scripture at
[1:40:37] all right Define the continuity of what
[1:40:39] the scripture is and what scripture says
[1:40:42] right so anyway well he said it right
[1:40:45] there yeah he did but
[1:40:47] you understand
[1:40:50] and they were separated like the she
[1:40:52] ETS that's right there's the church
[1:40:55] members come up and if they heard the
[1:40:57] truth and rejected the truth then what's
[1:40:59] going to be said when that big thing
[1:41:02] spreads across the canvas he's talking
[1:41:04] about that
[1:41:05] spreads across the canvas when even your
[1:41:08] own thoughts will be there
[1:41:10] Amen on that great screen he calls
[1:41:13] canvas here great screen that shows
[1:41:16] forth that shows every bit of it even to
[1:41:18] the very thoughts your own thoughts will
[1:41:20] be there what you thought about in fact
[1:41:22] we know of course through brother
[1:41:24] Branham and brother green told many many
[1:41:26] times your thoughts speak louder Before
[1:41:29] the Throne of God than even your words
[1:41:31] correct amen I got that right amen so
[1:41:36] our thoughts will even be there what you
[1:41:38] thought about how are you going to
[1:41:40] escape it there on that canvas of the
[1:41:43] Skies God's Great television there's
[1:41:46] there's your own thoughts he says
[1:41:49] rebelling you right there your thoughts
[1:41:51] speaking against you at that time
[1:41:54] my help us Lord but thank God for his
[1:41:57] blood see because even even those
[1:41:59] thoughts get annihilated and wiped away
[1:42:01] right amen those things that Satan's try
[1:42:04] to put on you know Satan will give you a
[1:42:05] thought yeah and it can be a bad thought
[1:42:07] it could be a horrible fall it could be
[1:42:09] a filthy thought and he'll have you
[1:42:12] repentant for that thought when Satan's
[1:42:14] want to put their start with
[1:42:15] is to get behind me Satan gifty behind
[1:42:19] me Satan that's not my thought that's
[1:42:21] your thought you put in my mind because
[1:42:23] remember Satan still has access to your
[1:42:26] mind the mind is still flashing can't
[1:42:27] corrupt he still has access remember we
[1:42:30] talked about that service one time uh
[1:42:32] brother random talked about uh giving
[1:42:34] the devil the opportunity he said to uh
[1:42:36] Satan took the Mind God took the heart
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:41] and that mind you'll put stuff in your
[1:42:42] mind you'll be repent for stuff you
[1:42:44] didn't even do right you didn't even
[1:42:46] think about oh God I'm sorry no just
[1:42:48] cast down reasonings
[1:42:50] amen and what the scripture says is cast
[1:42:52] down those reasons they get thee behind
[1:42:54] me that's not my fault and just and move
[1:42:57] on Amen honestly you can repent if you'd
[1:43:01] like I'm not telling you not to but you
[1:43:02] really don't have anything at that point
[1:43:03] to repent for what are your thoughts now
[1:43:06] if you entertain it and you act upon it
[1:43:08] or something that's different
[1:43:10] but if it's just a thought Satan puts in
[1:43:12] he say get behind me Satan and you move
[1:43:14] on with your normal Godly life and
[1:43:17] there's not even anything to repent for
[1:43:19] wasn't your thought Satan put it there
[1:43:21] it's his thought
[1:43:22] amen now let's go over I want to read I
[1:43:25] want to uh bring you three scriptures
[1:43:27] and drive this down before we go so
[1:43:29] let's go to Saint John chapter 5.
[1:43:32] we already had we already are you ready
[1:43:33] for brother Brown quoted it
[1:43:39] Saint John chapter 5.
[1:43:52] you know what let's go up to the 19th
[1:43:54] verse uh I got a couple more services on
[1:43:57] this anyway uh let's go up to the 19th
[1:44:00] verse I was just going to read one verse
[1:44:02] of scripture here but I wanna I want to
[1:44:04] try to back up with the scripture some
[1:44:06] of the things that I've ministered to
[1:44:07] you this morning
[1:44:09] uh Saint John 5 19. then answer Jesus
[1:44:12] and said unto them verily verily I say
[1:44:15] unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:44:16] himself but what he seeth the father do
[1:44:18] for what things soever he doeth those
[1:44:21] also doeth the son likewise
[1:44:24] for the Father loveth the Son and
[1:44:26] showeth him all things that himself do
[1:44:28] it and he will show him Greater Works
[1:44:31] than these that ye may Marvel
[1:44:34] for as the father raises up the dead and
[1:44:37] quickeneth him even so the son
[1:44:39] quickeneth whom he will thank God for
[1:44:42] that very much for the father judgeth no
[1:44:45] man but hath committed all judgment unto
[1:44:49] the son
[1:44:50] amen so now we understand C
[1:44:54] Jesus himself
[1:44:56] the father judgeth no man but had
[1:45:00] committed all judgment to the son why
[1:45:03] all the reasons we said earlier
[1:45:06] amen
[1:45:07] somebody can come to you and say oh I
[1:45:09] know how you feel if you haven't been
[1:45:11] there you really can't understand how
[1:45:13] that person feels and
[1:45:15] even then you can only understand a
[1:45:18] portion of because that's a different
[1:45:19] person than you are right they've had a
[1:45:21] different life different backgrounds
[1:45:22] they've gone through different things
[1:45:24] their spirit's different their nature is
[1:45:26] different so you still even when you say
[1:45:28] I know how you feel you still it it
[1:45:31] still kind of you really still kind of
[1:45:33] don't know because because you're not in
[1:45:36] their body
[1:45:37] but Jesus now understands and had
[1:45:42] committed the father had committed all
[1:45:45] judgment unto the position the placement
[1:45:47] of the son
[1:45:50] Jesus that all men should honor the son
[1:45:53] even as they honor the father he the
[1:45:55] honoreth not the son honor not the
[1:45:57] Father which he has sinned verily verily
[1:45:59] I say unto you he that heareth my word
[1:46:02] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:46:05] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:46:08] the condemnation but is passed from
[1:46:12] Death unto Lionel you do not come to the
[1:46:16] judgment
[1:46:17] he that heareth my word
[1:46:20] and believeth on him that sent me how
[1:46:23] many of those are in here this morning
[1:46:26] amen
[1:46:29] half the everlasting life and shall not
[1:46:31] come what's it saying you right now
[1:46:36] at this moment you have everlasting life
[1:46:41] praise the Lord why because his life is
[1:46:43] in you yes only form of eternal life
[1:46:45] that there is that germ seed of God that
[1:46:48] was placed in you from before the
[1:46:50] foundation of the world
[1:46:51] now God in you
[1:46:54] Everlasting
[1:46:55] eternal life
[1:46:57] shall not come to the Judgment
[1:46:59] condemnation is judgment
[1:47:01] but his past from Death unto life you
[1:47:04] don't taste second death we might
[1:47:08] the purchase has been paid but the
[1:47:10] Redemption has not been fully ex
[1:47:14] realized yet even though Jesus paid for
[1:47:17] it
[1:47:18] we're still in these bodies and these
[1:47:20] bodies May yet still taste dead
[1:47:23] we might we don't know what God has in
[1:47:26] store amen some of us may not even meet
[1:47:29] if there is a 2024 may not make it I
[1:47:32] don't know I may be one I don't know
[1:47:34] but we may still taste that death but
[1:47:38] because of having
[1:47:40] eternal life you the real you has
[1:47:44] already passed from Death To Life so
[1:47:47] what can death do to you
[1:47:52] death has nothing on you right
[1:47:55] praise the Lord amen
[1:47:57] he's already conquered yes he has and
[1:48:00] you have already passed have already
[1:48:03] passed you believe receive his word his
[1:48:08] holy spirit you have already passed you
[1:48:10] don't come to condemnation you've
[1:48:12] already been found not guilty pass from
[1:48:14] Death To Life
[1:48:15] amen let me read this first Corinthians
[1:48:19] a couple more scriptures I said First
[1:48:21] Corinthians 6 I'm going to go ahead and
[1:48:23] read
[1:48:24] dare any of you having a matter against
[1:48:27] another go to the law before the unjust
[1:48:30] and not before the Saints
[1:48:32] do you not know that the Saints shall
[1:48:35] judge the world
[1:48:36] and if the world shall be judged by you
[1:48:39] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:48:43] matters
[1:48:44] know ye not that we
[1:48:48] shall judge angels
[1:48:51] how much more things that pertain to
[1:48:54] this life
[1:48:56] amen amen
[1:48:58] if those judgments
[1:49:03] if then ye have judgments of things
[1:49:06] pertaining to this life set them to
[1:49:08] judge who are less esteemed in the
[1:49:10] church as he begins to explain that and
[1:49:12] how it should it doesn't but how it
[1:49:16] should operate in church an assembly of
[1:49:20] Holy Spirit-filled people
[1:49:22] amen amen unfortunately so many times
[1:49:25] you get in places where the serpent seed
[1:49:29] gets involved and then you've got greed
[1:49:30] and you've got arrogance and you've got
[1:49:33] pride and you've got contention and and
[1:49:35] then you just got a mess that's why
[1:49:37] people don't want to do it yeah
[1:49:39] and that's our shame as as bride that is
[1:49:44] to our shame it should not be that way
[1:49:46] unfortunately it is but this is how it's
[1:49:49] supposed to work
[1:49:51] scripturally this is how it's supposed
[1:49:53] to be done amen and and for the court so
[1:49:56] if the bride now if as he said we shall
[1:50:00] judge the world
[1:50:02] then where are we going to be how do we
[1:50:05] judge the world
[1:50:06] Revelation chapter 3 and I'll I'll close
[1:50:09] with this I got one more quote but I'll
[1:50:11] close with this scripture
[1:50:13] Revelation 3 21 to him that overcome it
[1:50:18] has eternal life
[1:50:19] well I grant to set with me
[1:50:23] in my throne
[1:50:28] those that are Overcomers those that
[1:50:30] overcome have eternal life
[1:50:34] born again
[1:50:36] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:50:42] even as I also overcame and am set down
[1:50:46] with my father in his throne so these
[1:50:48] Throne the Throne of this white Throne
[1:50:50] that is set up
[1:50:52] is set up not just for him
[1:50:55] but for us
[1:50:56] when you say him when you say the
[1:51:00] masculine you include the feminist amen
[1:51:03] when you include when we were married me
[1:51:06] and my wife we were probably on the cusp
[1:51:08] of this new woke stuff whatever that
[1:51:11] involved
[1:51:13] the minister
[1:51:15] even a Methodist minister of course my
[1:51:17] dad had told stuff from the minister to
[1:51:20] say it was it was one of the funniest
[1:51:22] things I remember when we were back in
[1:51:24] the back room my dad told me uh told the
[1:51:26] guy because it was her parents church so
[1:51:29] but my dad told the minister he said you
[1:51:32] marry him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:51:34] and he looked at him like a mule looking
[1:51:36] at him you gave
[1:51:39] we always say father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:51:42] no that's what I'm telling you you don't
[1:51:45] say that when you join them in Union you
[1:51:48] say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:51] and of course
[1:51:53] I don't mean I probably shouldn't even
[1:51:55] say it but you know
[1:51:57] Pastor got another 20 he'll say whatever
[1:51:58] he wanted to say
[1:52:00] but he did say it God we had the video
[1:52:03] go look and when he pronounced he said
[1:52:05] follow us on the Holy Ghost two or three
[1:52:07] different times through the ceremony but
[1:52:09] when it got to pronouncing us as husband
[1:52:10] and wife he said in the name of the Lord
[1:52:13] Jesus Christ and at the end he said I
[1:52:16] present to you Mr and Mrs George Newton
[1:52:18] Bennett III
[1:52:20] that's what he said right why because
[1:52:23] when he said me he included her
[1:52:26] that's the way it used to be I don't
[1:52:28] know what it is anymore but that's the
[1:52:30] way it's supposed to be in my opinion Mr
[1:52:33] Mrs George Newton III because when he
[1:52:35] said my name it included her she's now
[1:52:38] part of me we're one right
[1:52:41] that's the way it should be you look in
[1:52:43] the scripture and see that's the way it
[1:52:45] is in the scripture and when you say him
[1:52:47] you say her
[1:52:49] all right so people will say Miss Jesus
[1:52:51] oh that's fine but when you talk about
[1:52:53] him what are you talking about it when
[1:52:56] you talk about him the bride the groom
[1:52:58] you talk about the bride
[1:53:00] that's why Jesus said what they're not
[1:53:02] rejecting you they're rejecting me yes
[1:53:05] whatever they do unto you they're doing
[1:53:06] to me why because we're part of him
[1:53:12] we're one
[1:53:15] I don't know how many times brother
[1:53:17] random tried so hard in the latter part
[1:53:19] of his ministry to drive that home to us
[1:53:20] to get us to understand we are one with
[1:53:24] amen one with him
[1:53:27] and he has oh and we as Overcomers will
[1:53:29] be granted to sit with him in his throne
[1:53:33] know ye not that ye shall judge the
[1:53:35] world
[1:53:36] praise the Lord again one more add this
[1:53:39] one more quote I want to read here I'll
[1:53:40] close
[1:53:42] this is uh
[1:53:45] uh questions uh oh the same one question
[1:53:48] God's being under
[1:53:50] uh misunderstood
[1:53:52] uh
[1:53:54] here
[1:53:59] oh I already I already read that
[1:54:01] it's the same quote
[1:54:03] uh don't uh brother bear said don't the
[1:54:06] question is don't we stand uh
[1:54:09] don't we stand in judgment program said
[1:54:12] no sir we do not stand before the
[1:54:14] Judgment we are now standing before the
[1:54:16] Judgment God has put our sins upon
[1:54:19] Christ we have passed from Death unto
[1:54:21] life amen amen so now we got the
[1:54:24] Judgment we know where this judgment is
[1:54:25] set you know I accept
[1:54:28] Christ
[1:54:30] the son the position of sonship on the
[1:54:34] throne with his bride his bride
[1:54:37] thousands of thousands however that
[1:54:39] equals would be Millions thousands of
[1:54:41] thousands is in the millions I don't
[1:54:43] know why because there's no number given
[1:54:45] to it you say one thousand one thousand
[1:54:46] anyway
[1:54:47] and tens thousands of tens of thousands
[1:54:50] Before the Throne to be judged the books
[1:54:52] are open The Book of Life is open and
[1:54:55] all those that come before will be
[1:54:57] judged according to their words
[1:54:59] amen
[1:55:01] there may be somebody come up
[1:55:05] and maybe what's written there is not
[1:55:09] very good
[1:55:11] but it was somebody that you encountered
[1:55:13] in your life
[1:55:16] and that person comes up and all this is
[1:55:18] said and all the stuff is played on the
[1:55:19] screen and everything that happens
[1:55:22] and you step forth and say but
[1:55:24] father
[1:55:26] when I was on Earth they did this or
[1:55:28] this or whatever it was
[1:55:31] that might be exactly what it is in
[1:55:33] judgment now to be a righteous judgment
[1:55:35] amen right A righteous judgment
[1:55:37] but God will look upon that in favor
[1:55:41] amen because of how that person treated
[1:55:43] you I'm not saying that that person is
[1:55:45] going to be given eternal life for that
[1:55:49] reason that's up to the Lord I know what
[1:55:52] the scripture says I know what brother
[1:55:53] Brown says but
[1:55:56] the Bible says You must be born again
[1:55:59] but there will be people you know some
[1:56:02] of the foolish virgins that you may
[1:56:04] stand forth in favor of and say when I
[1:56:07] was on Earth
[1:56:09] I was destitute I was lost I was broke I
[1:56:13] was suicidal I was whatever and this
[1:56:16] person came and helped me this person
[1:56:18] came and gave me life this person came
[1:56:21] and ministered to me gave me a cup of
[1:56:23] water and something
[1:56:24] he'd stand forth and stand up for that
[1:56:27] person that person may very well just be
[1:56:30] because of the Judgment that you have
[1:56:32] through the character of Christ that
[1:56:33] person grant them a place not in the
[1:56:36] city but on the outside of the city but
[1:56:38] with the eternal life it will have life
[1:56:41] because of you
[1:56:43] that's one purpose reason of your being
[1:56:47] there as the bride you remember that
[1:56:49] Bridle be from the first church each of
[1:56:51] this church
[1:56:53] amen that
[1:56:55] praise the Lord in that judgment
[1:56:57] the books will be open
[1:56:58] amen let's stand if we could
[1:57:03] we know that brother random
[1:57:07] teaches us that
[1:57:09] death only changes your dwelling place
[1:57:11] that's right right
[1:57:13] amen
[1:57:16] you say well I do I'll do whatever I
[1:57:19] want but when I get over there I'll be
[1:57:20] this and says no you won't
[1:57:22] whatever you are here is what you'll be
[1:57:24] over there of course some people if they
[1:57:27] think they're going to be over there
[1:57:28] what they are here they won't be over
[1:57:30] there
[1:57:31] but
[1:57:33] death only changes your Dwelling Place
[1:57:35] amen those you've who go to sleep in
[1:57:38] that condition with those books open in
[1:57:41] those work set they'll be that's why
[1:57:43] they'll be judged in that same body yes
[1:57:45] because it only it only changed their
[1:57:48] dwelling place from here to here
[1:57:50] didn't change your character the only
[1:57:52] way that happens is if it's done here
[1:57:57] it's the only way that happens otherwise
[1:57:59] you're the same
[1:58:02] praise the Lord
[1:58:04] God is good amen
[1:58:06] praise the Lord let's sing this Amazing

[2:03:24] I really don't believe that my

[2:04:06] 23 years ago people were losing their
[2:04:09] minds over Y2K yes building bunkers and
[2:04:14] storing up stuff and going
[2:04:17] uh corporations going crazy over the
[2:04:20] computers and
[2:04:22] here we are 23 years later and he
[2:04:24] wouldn't even thought it was a blip on
[2:04:26] the radar
[2:04:28] foreign
[2:04:30] but it seems like the world has to keep
[2:04:33] in this country has to keep everybody

[2:04:56] this ever going to get to the place of

[2:05:05] and now I see you see it happening all
[2:05:08] the time every day all around us the
[2:05:11] good part is God will protect his own
