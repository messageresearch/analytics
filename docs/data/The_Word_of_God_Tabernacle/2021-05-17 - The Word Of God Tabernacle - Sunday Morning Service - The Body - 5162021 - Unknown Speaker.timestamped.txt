[22:30] they run some more tests
[22:32] and that was good news when we left the

[26:51] many years ago when i was seven years
[26:53] old we pulled into a restaurant late at
[26:55] night my dad had been traveling and
[26:57] and we there must not have been a
[26:59] restaurant on the road because
[27:01] we didn't stop till it felt like about 9
[27:03] 00 8 30 9 30 at night he was feeding us
[27:06] and
[27:07] by that time of being seven i was out of

[27:10] i was sitting at the table like this i
[27:12] didn't want to eat i just wanted to
[27:13] sleep
[27:14] and my father says to me honey please

[27:18] because i was all slumped over and it
[27:20] hurt him you know he knew how it had
[27:21] been on the road
[27:23] and it hurt him and so but i felt like i
[27:26] couldn't let him control me
[27:28] because it was a i don't know it just
[27:31] didn't feel right
[27:32] and so i didn't do it and um from that

[27:57] that have been contracted in the front
[27:58] and stretching them out and sometimes i
[28:01] find myself slumping in order to give
[28:02] myself relief

[38:32] appreciate you so much
[38:33] uh thank the lord's goodness in our
[38:35] lives um there's
[38:37] something i wanted to also mention to
[38:39] you uh before i
[38:40] have you stand in us entering into the
[38:43] service i'm not gonna be very long today
[38:45] i had a simple thought on my mind this
[38:48] week and then when i started looking at
[38:49] some things yesterday
[38:51] this is what the lord gave me so this
[38:53] won't be too long
[38:55] just fairly simple message i guess but
[38:58] the other day
[38:59] which would have been sunny before last
[39:00] i meant to do this last sunday but
[39:02] sunday before last
[39:03] uh and our last part of the free will uh
[39:07] series that we had that i mentioned
[39:09] about uh
[39:10] brother branham and the brown tabernacle
[39:12] and some things that unfolded
[39:14] with the ministering there when brother
[39:15] branham left the pulpit to go out on the
[39:17] field
[39:18] and i mentioned that uh about
[39:21] and i mentioned his name then so i might
[39:23] as well mention it now
[39:26] graham snelling uh but i
[39:29] got some of the facts a little off the
[39:31] premise of what i said was still true
[39:33] but when i went to work with brother
[39:35] roger the next day who was the one that
[39:37] relayed to me the
[39:38] the information from his dad who was a
[39:41] deacon at the tabernacle
[39:43] and and those things and of course being
[39:45] a collins and being an
[39:46] integral part of the branham tabernacle
[39:48] for many many years
[39:49] uh he relayed this information to me
[39:52] many years ago and it just came on my
[39:55] heart the other day when
[39:56] when i was talking about it and the way
[39:58] that sometimes people can be
[40:01] uh and make decisions and things that
[40:04] aren't
[40:04] uh really motivated by the
[40:08] holy spirit and the word but um
[40:11] i mentioned about him that brother
[40:13] branham had
[40:14] put him in and that the brothers had
[40:16] taken him out well
[40:17] there's another one that was involved so
[40:19] i want to straighten this story out so
[40:21] that we understand
[40:22] but uh there was a there was a brother
[40:25] before grand snailing that brother
[40:27] branham
[40:27] uh said the lord told him or felt led to
[40:30] put that brother
[40:32] in as the pastor brown tabernacle so
[40:35] so brother branham had this brother as
[40:37] the pastor of branham tabernacle when
[40:39] brother branham was gone
[40:41] these the deacon brothers trustees those
[40:44] that were in charge of the church found
[40:45] out that he had been
[40:46] married before and they voted and kicked
[40:49] him out
[40:50] it came to brother branham and brother
[40:52] brown um
[40:54] which you know you can take it for what
[40:56] it is i'm just telling you the story the
[40:58] way it was given
[40:59] uh and somebody relayed that story to
[41:02] brother brown
[41:03] said they got rid of this brother found
[41:05] out he'd been double married and they
[41:06] kicked him out
[41:07] and brother bantam just put down his
[41:10] head and said i
[41:10] wish they hadn't done that and uh
[41:14] and it wasn't long after that that of
[41:16] course then brother branham
[41:17] put they had graham snelling come in and
[41:19] be the pastor well though
[41:21] i mentioned the ones that uh that had
[41:23] the issue of graham snelling
[41:25] uh had backslid or died in a backslidden
[41:28] condition but it wasn't that it was the
[41:30] first minister
[41:32] all the ones that had made the decision
[41:35] to get rid of the original pastor
[41:39] everyone backslid or died in a
[41:41] backslidden condition
[41:42] now this was before brother rogers dad
[41:44] became a deacon there
[41:46] but every one of them according to what
[41:48] he had been told
[41:49] had died in that backslidden condition
[41:51] or had backslid or been
[41:53] died in that back every one of them that
[41:54] voted to get rid of
[41:56] that first brother you know brother
[41:58] brown put his head down and said i wish
[41:59] they hadn't done that
[42:01] see so got to make sure that we know
[42:04] what the leading of the lord is on on a
[42:06] certain issue
[42:07] sometimes the word of god becomes
[42:09] another effect because of our tradition
[42:11] right and we hold to things so much in
[42:14] church allergy and religion
[42:16] that we forget about the spirit of god
[42:18] and we forget about the moving of the
[42:19] spirit of god
[42:21] you know uh we just need to make sure we
[42:24] stay in contact with that spirit now
[42:26] graham now i got this part of the story
[42:28] right he came in uh made a mistake with
[42:30] the lady
[42:32] brother roger just mentioned and said
[42:34] the word adultery i didn't say that
[42:36] i just said uh he got himself mixed up
[42:39] in a situation with a lady
[42:41] and uh and they came to brother brown
[42:44] and brother branham they prayed about it
[42:47] brother branham got before the people
[42:48] and said
[42:49] brother snelling has apologized he has
[42:51] repented
[42:52] his repentance is sincere and i believe
[42:55] that he should just stay in as the
[42:57] pastor
[42:57] so he stayed in as the pastor after his
[43:00] indiscretion
[43:02] but then after that brother branham
[43:04] found out that he began to get off the
[43:06] word
[43:07] he began to preach things that were
[43:09] contrary to the message the scripture
[43:11] and when he started getting off the word
[43:13] that's when brother branham
[43:15] they got rid of it that's when brother
[43:16] brown said okay that's
[43:19] so the point of that was to understand
[43:21] uh the things that happen in life
[43:23] sometimes
[43:24] uh are are are some
[43:27] sometimes superficial things or we all
[43:29] get caught mistakes and make
[43:31] uh fall or make a mistake or get caught
[43:33] in a trap or something
[43:35] and that wasn't concerning to to brother
[43:37] brandon it wasn't concerning to the lord
[43:39] the holy spirit
[43:40] he fell and made this mistake but what
[43:43] but where the dividing point was
[43:45] to get rid of him from behind the pulpit
[43:48] was when he got
[43:49] off the word right when he started
[43:51] preaching false
[43:52] doctrine that's when it became a problem
[43:55] right
[43:55] so you understand what my my whole point
[43:58] of that was if you were here a couple
[43:59] weeks ago
[44:00] you remember that uh that that was the
[44:03] point of this
[44:04] of the story was to get to that point to
[44:07] understand sometimes we look at
[44:08] something
[44:09] and and we get something so fixed in our
[44:12] minds we get
[44:13] and we get this church allergy and we
[44:15] get this religion and tradition
[44:17] and and all of a sudden you know we
[44:19] think
[44:20] we just cut it off instead of giving
[44:23] time for the holy spirit and the lord
[44:25] to mend him to help it and to make it
[44:27] right
[44:28] we got to take into account the things
[44:31] that the lord is doing
[44:32] right and what god might be doing in the
[44:34] situation see we look at it from one way
[44:37] and then and then we can come through
[44:38] like i said and say oh we'll just pray
[44:40] about it well we'll just put it before
[44:42] the lord let's have prayer meaning
[44:44] but when your mind is already made up
[44:46] and you're already fixated that it's
[44:48] going to be one way
[44:49] you can pray all you want but there's no
[44:51] change in your mind
[44:52] right you're not going to change
[44:58] an angel could come from heaven
[45:01] and try to convince it or change it but
[45:03] it's not going to change if your mind is
[45:05] fixed on it
[45:06] right and you're just all of a sudden
[45:08] well you know
[45:09] he's done and over then that's just the
[45:11] way it's going to be you can pray all
[45:13] you want
[45:13] right you can talk to god all you want
[45:16] but if your mind is made up god's not
[45:18] going to
[45:18] god can't move that and god's a
[45:20] gentleman god's not going to force
[45:22] himself on you
[45:23] right now god's not going to come down
[45:25] with a louisville slugger to
[45:27] alter your opinion about something yeah
[45:29] he's not going to do that
[45:31] you're a free moral agency with a free
[45:33] will see
[45:34] and and in that god trust you in those
[45:37] decisions sometimes
[45:39] we got to make sure well all the time
[45:41] we've got to make sure it's the leading
[45:43] of the holy spirit and god that's moving
[45:45] those
[45:46] decisions in ways that we go and things
[45:48] that we do
[45:49] and have an open mind amen remember what
[45:52] the bible says
[45:53] the bible says to to uh to
[45:57] to have grace to someone to have mercy
[45:59] to someone
[46:00] uh unless you fall in that same
[46:02] temptation
[46:03] right judge not let you be judged for
[46:06] the same judge you meet on somebody that
[46:08] judgment's going to come back to you
[46:09] he said well i never did that yeah but
[46:11] what else did you do over here
[46:14] you say well that's not as bad so now
[46:16] we're getting into the category of big
[46:18] sins and little sins
[46:20] we're getting into the category of
[46:22] that's worse than this
[46:24] if it's sin friend it's sin amen and if
[46:26] you're guilty you're guilty
[46:28] right whether it's this or whether it's
[46:30] that it doesn't matter right
[46:31] you understand so the point of that was
[46:34] being
[46:34] that we never never come to the throne
[46:37] of god with
[46:38] closed mind with a fixed opinion would
[46:40] think well
[46:41] this is just the way it is that's hard
[46:43] and fast done
[46:44] well then what is the grace of god in
[46:46] the mercy of god
[46:47] if that was the case then we would still
[46:49] be living under the law
[46:52] but that's not the case the grace of
[46:54] mercy the grace and mercy of god
[46:56] so many times will come in and want to
[46:58] help the situation the issue
[47:00] and solve it out just like brother adam
[47:02] said that graham had
[47:04] had had repented and had apologized and
[47:07] he made it right and has straightened it
[47:09] all out
[47:09] and brother bantam allowed him to stay
[47:11] as the pastor abandoned tabernacle under
[47:13] those conditions
[47:15] understand amen so i know people say wow
[47:19] how could that be i don't know i don't
[47:22] know
[47:22] because my my first thought would be
[47:24] yeah he needs to go
[47:26] right that would be my first thought but
[47:28] then when the grace of god coming into
[47:30] repentance
[47:31] and and and god was merciful
[47:35] who can question that right i'm not
[47:37] going to question
[47:38] the mercy of god in your life because i
[47:40] don't want him questioning in my life
[47:43] i don't want the mercy of god question
[47:45] in my life if i don't want it questioned
[47:47] in my life
[47:48] i'm sure not going to question it in
[47:49] your life right if god can cover
[47:52] as the song and saying the chiefess of
[47:54] sinners then
[47:56] he's god he can do whatever he wants
[47:58] right amen
[47:59] he he's god so who am i to say
[48:03] that's just the grace of god but if you
[48:05] really want to try to find the mind of
[48:06] god you need to come to god with an open
[48:08] heart with an open mind
[48:10] allowing god to change that opinion or
[48:14] that feeling or that
[48:15] free will moral agency that you have
[48:18] so that it fits god's will right
[48:21] not uh not somebody's but it fits god's
[48:24] will that's the thing that we want the
[48:26] most
[48:28] uh that's the thing that matters the
[48:29] most amen
[48:31] is the will of god that's what matters
[48:33] see and that's where we need to be with
[48:35] him and that's what matters see amen
[48:38] that's so that's
[48:39] that's the whole point of the story
[48:40] don't get things so fixed in your mind
[48:42] don't get so much religion and tradition
[48:44] and
[48:45] and and churchilogy that that it's just
[48:48] the hard and fast
[48:49] right it's like i said there's people
[48:51] out there today i know
[48:52] people uh there and brother branham said
[48:55] it this way oh my grandpa was a baptist
[48:58] and my
[48:58] path he was a baptist and i'll be a
[49:00] baptist till i die and my kids will be a
[49:02] baptist until he hits six foot
[49:04] underground
[49:06] and that's just the way it is right well
[49:08] it's the same thing some people say well
[49:10] i go to this church it's my church i'll
[49:12] never leave this church
[49:13] so no matter what happens or how much
[49:16] goes on or whatever
[49:17] is preached behind the pull pitch you're
[49:19] going to stay right there
[49:20] but some people will do that because it
[49:22] gets so much church allergy
[49:24] saying let the lord leave that's the
[49:27] whole
[49:28] the whole point let your free will be
[49:31] molded by god's will in your life
[49:33] amen and then you'll find yourself in a
[49:35] position where god's blessings are
[49:37] are continuing to abound in your life
[49:39] yes and that's what we want
[49:41] we want the blessings of the lord
[49:42] abounding see right we want the lord's
[49:44] blessings abounding in our homes and and
[49:47] in our church here and in our family see
[49:49] that's where we want
[49:50] we want god to continue to move and
[49:52] bless us
[49:54] and that's what we want the most isn't
[49:55] it the will of
[49:58] amen and that's the most important thing
[50:00] so that's that's where we stand today
[50:02] yes amen and i appreciate god's goodness
[50:05] to us so yes
[50:06] amen let's stand to our feet now i hope
[50:09] i got that cleared up i wanted to make
[50:10] sure
[50:11] that the facts of that were said
[50:13] correctly
[50:18] i i i didn't miss the premise of it but
[50:20] i wanted to make sure and get the facts
[50:22] of the story correct so that there was
[50:23] no misunderstanding um
[50:27] or anything like that and i think
[50:29] actually the power of the story had more
[50:31] merit once i remembered
[50:33] my brother roger telling me the rest of
[50:35] the story or the fullness of the story
[50:38] so
[50:38] it helped me understand that but let's
[50:40] turn over our bibles to first
[50:42] corinthians
[50:47] the food is about a half hour early but
[50:50] um
[50:51] we're going to still have church anyway
[50:53] but like i said we won't be too long
[50:56] half hour or so and and
[50:59] see where the lord takes it from there
[51:01] so first corinthians chapter 12.
[51:10] amen first corinthians chapter 12
[51:14] verse 12. before we read let's just bow
[51:16] our heads if we could for another word

[52:06] the way and we know that and we believe
[52:08] that and i thank you lord

[53:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[53:08] pray amen amen amen
[53:10] amen amen first corinthians 12 verse 12.
[53:14] let's just begin reading we'll just read
[53:15] a few verses here and let you be seated
[53:18] for as the body is one and have many
[53:21] members and all the members of that one
[53:22] body being many are
[53:24] one body so also is christ for by one
[53:28] spirit are we all baptized into one body
[53:30] whether we be jews or gentiles
[53:32] whether we be bond or free and have been
[53:35] all made to drink into one spirit
[53:38] for the body is not one member but many
[53:41] you can be seated if you like and i'm
[53:44] just going to talk about and this is the
[53:46] subject that came on my heart
[53:47] on the body the body because of the
[53:50] situation
[53:51] here and being our anniversary time and
[53:55] us as a family together and us as the
[53:57] church together
[53:58] we read here that paul is telling the
[54:00] corinthian church that
[54:02] the body of christ is one body it has
[54:04] many members
[54:05] but it's just one body and you know
[54:07] within that one body
[54:09] is the body that we have here today
[54:11] inside the one body of christ is many
[54:13] members
[54:14] we inside that body are one body as a
[54:17] church together
[54:18] amen we are one body fit inside the body
[54:21] of jesus christ we are many members
[54:24] but we are a body we are one together
[54:27] everyone that comes in and calls
[54:29] themselves a part of this church
[54:30] and attendance and tithes and this is
[54:33] your church and i'm your pastor and
[54:35] uh we're all together as a family you
[54:37] fall under
[54:38] that protection of the of that blood of
[54:41] this
[54:41] church and of jesus christ you all fall
[54:45] under that protection so because
[54:47] we're a part of that family and the
[54:49] blood of jesus christ of course
[54:50] protects the entire body of christ but
[54:53] we are just a microcosm of a little bit
[54:55] of
[54:56] of of what god does internationally
[54:59] around the world
[55:00] not just in tucson or in arizona or in
[55:02] the united states but
[55:04] all over the world god has little
[55:05] pockets just like this
[55:07] some are larger some are smaller but
[55:09] they're all families
[55:10] and they're all families together you
[55:12] know we we rarely see and and
[55:15] hopefully we won't see it very much if
[55:17] at all but
[55:18] you know there is a process that's in
[55:20] the scripture that brother branham talks
[55:22] about that
[55:23] that is taking out from under the blood
[55:25] well that process
[55:27] is exactly what i'm talking about of the
[55:29] blood that protects
[55:31] or that is over this congregation as a
[55:34] as a body as a family that uh pastor the
[55:38] headship and the people
[55:39] are all together as one body and when
[55:42] and when one unconfessed sin comes in it
[55:45] can ruin the body
[55:46] yeah it can mess up the whole church
[55:49] brother adam said it could cause this
[55:50] church to
[55:51] bitterly fail yes just one unconfessed
[55:55] sin
[55:55] so that process if someone lives in open
[55:58] sin
[55:59] and is unwilling to repent and has
[56:01] sinned against the church and against
[56:02] the people in the church and things
[56:04] and and they're unwilling to repent and
[56:06] and they just go out and live and
[56:08] and unrepented living whatever life they
[56:11] they want to live then
[56:12] there's that process of taking that
[56:14] person out from under the blood
[56:16] because the blood because if they were a
[56:18] part of this church if they're a part of
[56:20] a church
[56:21] and they fall under the auspice of that
[56:23] and that blood for that church
[56:25] that church and that blood is still
[56:27] responsible for that person
[56:30] so you see that's why that process is
[56:32] instituted
[56:33] so that that person no longer is under
[56:36] that same protection
[56:38] amen so if it's not under that same
[56:40] protection
[56:41] then the church body that local church
[56:44] body is not responsible
[56:46] for that that happens by that person
[56:48] outside or out from under the blood
[56:51] right you understand so that at that
[56:53] point when
[56:54] i know this has taken a turn i
[56:56] absolutely didn't have in my mind or
[56:58] expect but
[56:59] we're going with it once it's out from
[57:01] under the blood then too
[57:02] according to the scripture then god can
[57:05] or satan can begin to deal with that
[57:07] person or god forgive to deal with that
[57:09] person by using the devil
[57:10] right because they're out from under the
[57:12] blood they're out from under the
[57:14] protection of
[57:15] of the church they're out from under the
[57:17] protection of that blood
[57:18] that's where satan can get to them and
[57:20] god can use that tool
[57:22] to bring that person back and that's the
[57:25] whole point of it
[57:26] is to bring the person back it's not to
[57:28] make their lives miserable
[57:30] it's not to send them or doom them to
[57:32] hell is to make them and bring them to a
[57:34] point that they'll come back to where
[57:36] they're supposed to be
[57:38] under the protection of the blood in the
[57:39] body of that uh current
[57:42] church family right that's the whole
[57:43] point see but
[57:45] that family you understand that's the
[57:47] body that point of the body is what i'm
[57:49] trying to make
[57:50] and we're a part of that body paul
[57:52] talked about the body as
[57:54] a whole has many members and all the
[57:56] members he talked about jews and
[57:57] gentiles he talked about free and bond
[58:00] but we're all a part of that same body
[58:02] you know you look sometimes you think
[58:04] well
[58:04] uh uh i i i feel kind of like a misfit
[58:08] myself
[58:09] uh i i feel like sometimes that um
[58:12] you know even though i was an associate
[58:14] with brother green the tabernacle for
[58:16] 15 years uh that i just
[58:20] feel kind of like a misfit you know and
[58:22] and
[58:23] and sometimes when you feel that way uh
[58:26] it's because god wants to lead you or
[58:28] put you in a position
[58:30] where you belong right because that
[58:33] because god wants you if you're his
[58:35] child he wants you in a certain place
[58:36] right and and the gentleness of the
[58:38] sweetness of the holy spirit will
[58:40] manipulate you and move you in a certain
[58:42] way so that it brings you to a place
[58:45] again that doesn't negate your free will
[58:47] because you still have a decision
[58:49] but it will move you and guide you into
[58:51] the place that he wants you to be
[58:53] and see if you're pliable enough and if
[58:55] your heart is soft enough and if you're
[58:57] desiring to have
[58:58] the holy spirit move you and shape you
[59:00] and to have
[59:01] uh his will in your life then he's going
[59:04] to be able to move you in that way
[59:05] he's going to be able to put you in that
[59:07] position he's going to be able to bring
[59:09] you where you're supposed to be
[59:11] i believe that's why all of us are here
[59:12] today
[59:14] absolutely what the leading of the lord
[59:17] right whatever criticism whatever
[59:20] uh uh putting down people may do or
[59:24] whatever they may say about you or this
[59:26] church or me
[59:27] let it all follow me that's fine but it
[59:30] doesn't matter
[59:31] as long as i'm right with my lord right
[59:34] as long as i'm in his perfect will
[59:37] i'm not here to service other people's
[59:39] wills for my life no
[59:40] i'm here to service the will of god for
[59:42] my life and if god is shaping me and
[59:45] moving me and making us in a place where
[59:47] we're supposed to be
[59:48] to fulfill that purpose god give us then
[59:50] praise the lord that's where we're
[59:52] supposed to be
[59:53] and god will bless you there amen god
[59:55] will meet you there and bless you there
[59:57] yes
[59:58] and that's why and i believe saints
[1:00:00] that's why we've been seeing so many
[1:00:02] things
[1:00:03] happening and the spirit of god moving
[1:00:06] in our services and
[1:00:07] and the miracles and the things taking
[1:00:09] place in our lives in our families and
[1:00:11] in our homes and things that's happening
[1:00:13] in testimonies that are one right after
[1:00:15] the other
[1:00:16] i thought i thought maybe even having
[1:00:19] a little testimony service of things
[1:00:22] that that god may have done for you
[1:00:24] in the past a few years but i felt like
[1:00:26] that that this is what the lord
[1:00:28] wanted me to talk on so if you have a
[1:00:30] testimony though
[1:00:31] please you're more than welcome to give
[1:00:33] it when i get done but
[1:00:34] you know we all have something that's in
[1:00:36] our heart that the lord's been doing for
[1:00:38] us
[1:00:38] especially how we see god moving in our
[1:00:41] lives
[1:00:42] lately and in our families and and and
[1:00:45] some things you just see maybe a grain
[1:00:47] at a time
[1:00:48] it might just be a grain of sand at a
[1:00:50] time but you see the hand of god moving
[1:00:52] on it
[1:00:53] and you just have patience and you trust
[1:00:55] the lord and you believe god's going to
[1:00:56] make it work together for our good
[1:00:58] because he promised us he would do it
[1:01:00] because we love him with all of our
[1:01:02] hearts yes
[1:01:03] amen we have confidence in him and we
[1:01:05] believe in him
[1:01:06] amen but if we are one body
[1:01:09] and and and tighten it and brought
[1:01:12] together and i've said this before and
[1:01:14] i'll say it again and god bless you
[1:01:15] precious sisters
[1:01:17] for having your prayer group and getting
[1:01:19] together for lunch and spending
[1:01:21] time together and fellowship and uh you
[1:01:24] don't know
[1:01:24] how good that does my heart how that
[1:01:27] makes me when
[1:01:28] my wife comes says oh we're going to
[1:01:29] lunch how that just settles in my heart
[1:01:31] like a dove coming on a lamb
[1:01:33] amen it feels so good so appreciate it
[1:01:36] but
[1:01:37] uh and things like today and the
[1:01:39] fellowship it just means so much to me
[1:01:41] because that's the unity and that's the
[1:01:43] fellowship and that's the longing the
[1:01:45] loving that god wants his family to have
[1:01:47] for one another
[1:01:48] but understand satan is going to do
[1:01:52] everything he can to disrupt that yeah
[1:01:54] say he's going to do everything he can
[1:01:56] to try to come against that or hurt or
[1:01:58] hinder that in whatever way he can look
[1:02:01] at this if you go down i was going to
[1:02:02] read this whole part but
[1:02:04] just for sake of time just uh pieces of
[1:02:06] this now
[1:02:07] same chapter but on the 20 in the 24th
[1:02:10] verse
[1:02:12] first corinthians 12 24 for our comely
[1:02:15] parts
[1:02:16] have no need but god hath tempered the
[1:02:19] body together
[1:02:21] having given more abundant honor to that
[1:02:24] part which
[1:02:24] lacked amen well when the body come
[1:02:27] together of course in the day of
[1:02:28] pentecost and
[1:02:29] and afterwards in the book of acts when
[1:02:31] the body of christ came together
[1:02:34] nobody was wanting and nobody was excess
[1:02:37] but everybody was everybody was happy
[1:02:40] and everything was going fine and
[1:02:42] and their lives were great so the bot
[1:02:44] because the body becomes tempered
[1:02:46] together
[1:02:46] and the nicest of fire come and tried
[1:02:49] the light of the holy spirit and tried
[1:02:50] to keep back a part of that well you
[1:02:52] know what happened
[1:02:53] in eye since the fire right so but the
[1:02:55] bodies being
[1:02:56] tempered together see tempered the body
[1:02:59] together
[1:03:00] having more abundant honor to that part
[1:03:02] which lack
[1:03:03] that there should be no schism amen
[1:03:06] anybody know what a schism is schism is
[1:03:08] something that divides
[1:03:10] yes a schism is something that is meant
[1:03:12] to bring
[1:03:13] separation amen it's sort of like a
[1:03:16] it's a derivative of a word called shim
[1:03:20] a shim is something that you stick
[1:03:22] between usually two pieces of wood
[1:03:24] sometimes i balance my bookshelf with a
[1:03:27] shim because it's leaning forward and i
[1:03:29] need to put
[1:03:30] something under it so that it sets it up
[1:03:32] right but
[1:03:33] i'm sure if you took the door frames off
[1:03:35] of these doors
[1:03:36] there's probably shims inside there to
[1:03:38] separate the frame
[1:03:40] from from the uh uh from the actual door
[1:03:44] and because the door frame just sits in
[1:03:46] there and the door will be locked sided
[1:03:48] and it'll be
[1:03:49] it'll be uh uh caddy wampus and it won't
[1:03:52] open it won't close and
[1:03:54] it'll scrape hero straight there so you
[1:03:56] put a little shim
[1:03:57] that is meant to divide it starts
[1:04:01] at the end and just a tiny little
[1:04:04] smaller than a toothpick on the very end
[1:04:06] or right about the size of a toothpick
[1:04:08] a shim is on the very end those who
[1:04:11] don't know construction or anything like
[1:04:13] that might
[1:04:13] understand but it's a piece of wood
[1:04:15] about that long
[1:04:17] uh some numbers shorter longer but but
[1:04:19] at the very end it starts just in a very
[1:04:22] small
[1:04:22] tiny little section just like the size
[1:04:25] of a toothpick
[1:04:26] but then once it goes back towards the
[1:04:28] end of the shim it gets to about that
[1:04:30] thick
[1:04:31] maybe a quarter of an inch or so maybe
[1:04:33] even a little more than a quarter of an
[1:04:34] inch
[1:04:35] it'll get about that thick well the
[1:04:37] point of that is to separate
[1:04:39] is to divide the door frame from the
[1:04:42] door
[1:04:43] so that it can it can level the door up
[1:04:46] so it doesn't scrape
[1:04:47] and so that's a good process of hashem
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:50] but you understand that the point of the
[1:04:52] shim is at the very
[1:04:54] tip it just comes in as the smallest
[1:04:57] tiny little minute uh end
[1:05:00] on that shim and that's exactly what the
[1:05:03] devil does
[1:05:04] the devil will try to come in with the
[1:05:06] end of that shem
[1:05:07] just as small just as tiny
[1:05:10] just for the purpose of trying to shove
[1:05:12] that thing right through to bring a
[1:05:14] shism
[1:05:15] or division between the people yes
[1:05:18] and that's exactly what satan will try
[1:05:20] to do they'll try to do it to you to
[1:05:22] me to us to the family to us to me
[1:05:25] whatever and bring that division that
[1:05:27] separation
[1:05:28] to divide and to separate but it starts
[1:05:32] with just the smallest little thing
[1:05:35] friend if something happens if things
[1:05:38] come up if there's
[1:05:39] cross words said or if there's things
[1:05:41] that are offensive or something
[1:05:43] let's deal with it right amen i mean
[1:05:47] in small parts we've done that here but
[1:05:50] let's deal with it amen if somebody
[1:05:52] hurts you somebody offends you
[1:05:54] let's deal with it let's get it straight
[1:05:57] i don't want any chism friend no
[1:05:59] division no separation
[1:06:02] i i don't want you to feel like there's
[1:06:03] anybody in here that's in here now or
[1:06:06] comes to this congregation or part of
[1:06:08] this church
[1:06:08] that you couldn't go up and shake your
[1:06:11] hand hug your neck
[1:06:12] say i love you brother love you sister
[1:06:14] now of course the brothers and sisters
[1:06:16] don't you understand
[1:06:17] right but uh sister to sister brother
[1:06:19] brother
[1:06:20] say i love you i appreciate you i'm glad
[1:06:24] you're in my life i'm glad you're pro
[1:06:25] whatever and mean it you know brother
[1:06:29] branham said that there will people
[1:06:30] there'll be people that that they'll say
[1:06:33] i love you brother branham
[1:06:34] and he said they'll hug me around the
[1:06:36] neck he said but if they had a knife
[1:06:38] they'd stab me in the back
[1:06:39] now that's a prophetic gift that could
[1:06:42] know what the intent of that person's
[1:06:43] heart is
[1:06:44] i don't have that in that gift and you
[1:06:47] probably don't either
[1:06:48] although i have hugged some people that
[1:06:50] i felt like if they had a knife who's to
[1:06:52] have me in the back
[1:06:53] but but understand
[1:06:56] that can't be you right amen
[1:07:00] don't be that person right that if you
[1:07:02] hug them or something that you are ready
[1:07:04] to stab
[1:07:05] them in the back or ready at the first
[1:07:08] chance
[1:07:08] to try to spread gossip or hurt that
[1:07:11] person's character in any way
[1:07:13] character assassination is one of the
[1:07:15] most
[1:07:16] demonic things a church has to deal with
[1:07:19] that people in christianity
[1:07:22] has to deal with it is a horrible
[1:07:27] situation is a lie to hell amen he's
[1:07:30] saying
[1:07:30] it's right brother newton but that
[1:07:32] doesn't make it right
[1:07:34] you're spreading it you're talking about
[1:07:36] it you're slandering doesn't make it
[1:07:38] right
[1:07:38] tearing down that person's character
[1:07:40] doesn't make it right
[1:07:42] even if they did do it right right it
[1:07:44] doesn't make it right
[1:07:45] amen amen the love of god will bring
[1:07:49] together
[1:07:50] not separate right now the only
[1:07:53] separation there is
[1:07:54] is from belief from unbelief and
[1:07:56] sometimes god does that
[1:07:59] sometimes god has to use the word to
[1:08:01] bring a separation between belief and
[1:08:03] unbelief
[1:08:04] but friends we are brothers and sisters
[1:08:06] we love one another
[1:08:08] we're all part of the same body of jesus
[1:08:10] christ
[1:08:11] do you plan to get up there and you have
[1:08:14] occupy one end of heaven and the person
[1:08:16] you hate occupy the other end
[1:08:18] amen ain't gonna be that way i'm sorry
[1:08:20] it doesn't work like that
[1:08:22] if you go up there with hatred in your
[1:08:24] heart toward anybody friend you're not
[1:08:26] going to be there
[1:08:27] because there's nothing there but
[1:08:28] perfect love yeah
[1:08:30] and don't step and don't say here tell
[1:08:32] me that you're going to get perfect love
[1:08:34] when you get a body change
[1:08:36] doesn't happen that way a body change
[1:08:39] only separates you from this body
[1:08:41] you keep the same character that you
[1:08:44] have now that you when you get in that
[1:08:45] new body
[1:08:47] amen same if you hate here
[1:08:50] you'll hate there that's right if you
[1:08:52] love here you'll love there that's right
[1:08:55] so my point is
[1:08:59] don't be that person that says i would
[1:09:01] stab them in the back
[1:09:05] don't be that person even if somebody
[1:09:06] hurts you
[1:09:08] forgive them let forgiveness abound
[1:09:12] and forgive that person say brother you
[1:09:14] don't know what they did to me
[1:09:15] well i know what they did to jesus and
[1:09:17] he said father forgive
[1:09:19] right amen amen so you i'm sorry you
[1:09:22] don't have an excuse
[1:09:26] it's like the the testimony today
[1:09:30] uh about uh sister pat
[1:09:33] about lee going through and comparing
[1:09:36] him to job
[1:09:37] and she admitted said i'm sure lee
[1:09:39] didn't go through what job had to go
[1:09:40] through
[1:09:41] but similar and i'm sure we've all had
[1:09:43] our valleys where we felt like job at
[1:09:45] times or another but but to understand
[1:09:49] but that the lord brought from that
[1:09:51] place and
[1:09:52] and took him out of that amen so
[1:09:55] so who is legal to blame
[1:09:59] who is job going to blame who are we
[1:10:02] gonna blame
[1:10:03] right even if you most people blame god
[1:10:07] that's that's why they leave him because
[1:10:09] because well god how could god allow
[1:10:11] this to happen they leave god
[1:10:14] they leave the body they leave the
[1:10:15] family you see but i don't know
[1:10:17] you don't know what they did to me it
[1:10:18] doesn't matter what they did to you no
[1:10:21] you don't know what people have done to
[1:10:22] me either yes
[1:10:24] well some of you may know some of what's
[1:10:25] been done to me but
[1:10:27] you know we don't know but
[1:10:30] we do know one thing that love covert
[1:10:33] the multitude of sins
[1:10:36] in fact one place psalm says love covers
[1:10:38] all sin
[1:10:39] now that's the love of god not not
[1:10:42] worldly love
[1:10:43] right worldly love says oh yeah i'll
[1:10:45] love you as long as you agree with me
[1:10:46] right oh you're part of our group as
[1:10:48] long as you say what we say
[1:10:50] right oh we love you and we want to help
[1:10:52] you do everything we can for you but
[1:10:54] boy as soon as you turn around and you
[1:10:56] say something contrary they'll
[1:10:57] jump on you like a bunch of rabbit
[1:10:59] jackals
[1:11:01] feast off the carcass of whoever
[1:11:04] amen that's exactly and unfortunately i
[1:11:07] hate to say it but that's exactly some
[1:11:09] things i've experienced and seen in this
[1:11:11] message friend
[1:11:12] my my message today don't be that no
[1:11:15] don't be that person don't be that group
[1:11:18] don't be those ones
[1:11:19] yes say i promise you satan is going to
[1:11:22] do
[1:11:22] everything he can to take that little
[1:11:25] corner that slim of the shiver
[1:11:27] and stick it in there to try to get you
[1:11:29] to hate one another
[1:11:30] right that's right bringing negativity
[1:11:35] to then all you got to say is negative
[1:11:38] about somebody
[1:11:39] just waiting for a little juicy section
[1:11:41] of concept that you can
[1:11:42] spread about so-and-so amen
[1:11:46] i can't even begin to tell you the
[1:11:48] things that i know about other people
[1:11:50] that i would never tell somebody else
[1:11:54] i had to correct a brother one time the
[1:11:56] tucson tabernacle
[1:11:58] well several times but i'm thinking of
[1:12:00] one specific instance
[1:12:02] and the brother called me later he said
[1:12:03] oh please don't tell brother green
[1:12:05] i said brother if there's any
[1:12:07] corrections needs to be done
[1:12:08] god's going to do it not me right true
[1:12:12] and i never have never will of course
[1:12:14] brother green's gone now but
[1:12:16] never would amen it's still me
[1:12:20] i wouldn't do it right nor would i
[1:12:22] because that what what purpose would
[1:12:24] that serve
[1:12:25] right you see it and it doesn't matter
[1:12:28] if that person has done something to you
[1:12:30] or not get past that
[1:12:32] let the holy spirit let the love of god
[1:12:34] come in
[1:12:35] and let the grace of god take over and
[1:12:37] say if it weren't for the grace of god
[1:12:39] there go
[1:12:40] i exactly amen amen don't let that shift
[1:12:44] there should be no schism in the body
[1:12:46] yes but that
[1:12:47] members should have the same care one
[1:12:50] for another
[1:12:51] amen the same care one for another that
[1:12:54] there's no division
[1:12:55] no separation yes you know a lot of
[1:12:58] times we're unwilling to accept
[1:13:01] how difficult this can be sometimes
[1:13:05] unwilling to accept and and i'll
[1:13:08] probably
[1:13:09] i'm gonna have to close here shortly but
[1:13:11] i'll probably do this in a greater way
[1:13:14] just a message for the fifth anniversary
[1:13:16] but sometimes we don't realize
[1:13:18] how difficult it is to be a christian
[1:13:21] yeah how difficult it is to coexist with
[1:13:24] others
[1:13:25] to coexist with with brothers and
[1:13:27] sisters of the same church
[1:13:29] the same faith same belief the same
[1:13:31] message
[1:13:32] to coexist together because the enemy is
[1:13:35] always out to try to divide it to
[1:13:37] separate
[1:13:38] and destroy always that's this whole
[1:13:41] point
[1:13:42] to drive that division to drive that
[1:13:45] separation between
[1:13:46] between brothers and sisters and all he
[1:13:48] needs is just to get that little crack
[1:13:50] open
[1:13:51] that's all he needs to do just don't
[1:13:55] don't give place to the devil ephesians
[1:13:58] says
[1:13:59] don't give place to the devil amen i
[1:14:01] believe it's actually it might be right
[1:14:02] here close to what i'm getting ready to
[1:14:03] read i'm trying to remember
[1:14:07] amen yeah uh ephesians 4 27 never
[1:14:11] neither give place to the devil be ye
[1:14:13] angry
[1:14:14] sin not lest not the let not the sun go
[1:14:17] down upon your wrath
[1:14:18] neither give place to the devil don't
[1:14:20] allow the devil to get in there
[1:14:22] at all don't entertain him praise the
[1:14:25] lord
[1:14:26] but i want to read from ephesians 4 1
[1:14:30] 4 ephesians 4 1 therefore the prisoner
[1:14:33] of the lord
[1:14:35] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:14:37] location wherewith you are called
[1:14:39] with all lowliness and meekness with
[1:14:42] long suffering for bearing one another
[1:14:44] in love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:14:46] the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:14:48] there is one body and one spirit even as
[1:14:50] you are called
[1:14:51] in one hope of your calling one lord one
[1:14:54] faith one baptism
[1:14:55] one god and father of all who is above
[1:14:57] all through all in you all
[1:14:59] now look at the look at the challenge
[1:15:03] laid on the ephesian church most
[1:15:05] probably the most perfect church in the
[1:15:07] bible
[1:15:08] look the what was laid to the ephesian
[1:15:12] church by paul
[1:15:13] this was the warning he gave very much
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:16] look at this he said with all loneliness
[1:15:21] and meekness with long suffering for
[1:15:24] bearing one another in love endeavoring
[1:15:26] to keep the unity of the spirit
[1:15:28] in the bond of peace so what we're
[1:15:31] looking for
[1:15:32] and what my encouragement is to you
[1:15:34] today
[1:15:36] is to keep the unity of the spirit in
[1:15:39] the bond of peace
[1:15:41] amen amen keep the unity of the spirit
[1:15:45] and the bond of peace that's what we're
[1:15:48] to do
[1:15:48] yes stay unified stay unified to christ
[1:15:52] stay unified to the body of christ
[1:15:55] internationally
[1:15:56] and unified to the local assembly that
[1:15:58] we have here
[1:15:59] now now you feel led to do what you i'm
[1:16:01] not trying to
[1:16:03] say you've got to stay here i'm not
[1:16:04] saying that you know me better than that
[1:16:06] right but what i'm saying is if we're
[1:16:08] here and we are a part of this
[1:16:10] right then we then we do what we
[1:16:13] we keep the unity of the spirit in the
[1:16:16] bond of peace
[1:16:16] now how are we to do that now this
[1:16:20] may be a little rough and i'm going to
[1:16:21] go through this kind of quickly
[1:16:23] but listen very closely because the
[1:16:25] prescription paul
[1:16:26] give us is in verses two and three
[1:16:30] with all lowliness amen that means we
[1:16:33] not
[1:16:34] have to humble ourselves right amen and
[1:16:37] sometimes
[1:16:38] to bite your tongue and to keep
[1:16:41] spreading gossip
[1:16:42] let's put it that way yes you have to be
[1:16:45] humble
[1:16:46] yeah you have to humble yourself with
[1:16:49] all
[1:16:49] humility or lowliness and meekness
[1:16:52] meekness is mild gentle amen to be mean
[1:16:57] with long suffering long suffering is to
[1:17:00] have patience
[1:17:03] i doubt if i asked anybody to raise
[1:17:05] their hand they had patience very
[1:17:06] very few if anybody's hand would go up
[1:17:09] we struggle
[1:17:10] probably very hard most of us on a daily
[1:17:12] basis
[1:17:14] basis with our patients right and of
[1:17:16] course society hasn't made that any
[1:17:17] easier
[1:17:18] with automobiles that go 100 miles 200
[1:17:21] miles an hour with planes that go
[1:17:23] several hundred miles an hour you could
[1:17:25] be across the country in half a day
[1:17:26] nowadays
[1:17:28] amen i told you before it's like it's
[1:17:30] it's robbed the patience of people
[1:17:32] uh people used to just sit on the front
[1:17:34] porch and just enjoy sitting
[1:17:36] i i mean do people still do that or
[1:17:39] they're just
[1:17:39] so busy doing everything else or no
[1:17:41] patience or
[1:17:43] whatever has to be done because there's
[1:17:45] a lot to be done there's always
[1:17:47] a lot to be done people say i gotta do
[1:17:49] this because there's a lot to be done
[1:17:51] but you know what
[1:17:52] if you do that tomorrow there's still
[1:17:54] gonna be
[1:17:55] a lot to be done so if you skip the day
[1:18:00] there's still going to be a lot to be
[1:18:01] done if you work real hard today
[1:18:04] there's still going to be a lot to be
[1:18:05] done sometimes it just takes a little
[1:18:07] patience
[1:18:09] always seeking god first amen putting
[1:18:12] god first
[1:18:13] in every seek ye therefore first the
[1:18:16] kingdom of god
[1:18:17] then all these things would be added up
[1:18:19] to you it was one of the
[1:18:21] uh one of the messengers back i can't
[1:18:23] remember
[1:18:24] luther or who it was but uh uh i
[1:18:28] i i read somewhere i heard somewhere he
[1:18:30] made this statement he said if i don't
[1:18:31] take three hours and pray
[1:18:33] every morning i don't have enough time
[1:18:35] in my day to do what i need to do
[1:18:38] now that's just as illogical as
[1:18:41] believing that
[1:18:41] 90 of your funds will go as far as 100
[1:18:45] it's illogical it doesn't work
[1:18:49] how does taking three hours out of your
[1:18:51] day give you
[1:18:52] more time to do what you need to do
[1:18:56] you know how it's how you spend it right
[1:19:00] amen it's how you spend those three
[1:19:02] hours yes
[1:19:03] amen it's how you spend that ten percent
[1:19:06] yes
[1:19:07] that's when god can take it and multiply
[1:19:10] yes
[1:19:11] so to understand that that that that's
[1:19:13] how god works
[1:19:15] to make all of this come about in our
[1:19:17] lives is to understand and trust him and
[1:19:20] everything patience
[1:19:22] very hard they used to uh women used to
[1:19:26] have this big metal thing in the corner
[1:19:27] of their kitchen
[1:19:28] they'd have to go outside chop down the
[1:19:32] wood
[1:19:32] have to cord up the wood and have to
[1:19:35] take the wood
[1:19:36] put it in this big metal thing they
[1:19:38] didn't have to build a fire
[1:19:40] inside the big metal thing and wait for
[1:19:42] it to get hot enough
[1:19:43] to put some food on it so it can start
[1:19:46] getting warm
[1:19:47] that's how they cooked how many days and
[1:19:51] hours did that take a lot of prep work
[1:19:54] of course with the wood
[1:19:56] but just from the fact of saying the
[1:19:57] wood is already in there you still got
[1:19:59] to build the fire you got to wait for it
[1:20:01] to get hot you got to do all this
[1:20:03] nowadays we stick stuff in this little
[1:20:04] metal box we push a button and we sit
[1:20:06] there and wait for it to get done
[1:20:07] because it just can't wait
[1:20:10] two minutes to cook this meal i can have
[1:20:12] an entire meal in two minutes
[1:20:15] well that's just too long i want it
[1:20:17] minute to hand
[1:20:18] and we sit there and wait for it to get
[1:20:20] done let's just can't wait
[1:20:23] patience our patients have been robbed
[1:20:25] lord help us
[1:20:26] yeah and then what's what's the what's
[1:20:28] the michael used to dance around with
[1:20:30] this
[1:20:31] uh little bunny that sang and said that
[1:20:32] he wants patience and he wants it right
[1:20:34] now
[1:20:37] that's kind of the way it is but we got
[1:20:39] to be patient
[1:20:41] we got to hum but be humble gentle and
[1:20:44] meet towards one another not overbearing
[1:20:46] not demonstrative not not matter of fact
[1:20:49] you don't make yourself build yourself
[1:20:51] up higher than
[1:20:52] don't act towards somebody like your
[1:20:54] condon sending
[1:20:55] down to their level just to communicate
[1:20:58] with them
[1:20:59] i'm not saying anybody does that but you
[1:21:01] understand see
[1:21:03] be humble be meek have patience with one
[1:21:07] another
[1:21:08] amen be patient forbearing
[1:21:11] one another in love forbearing is to
[1:21:14] endure and suffer
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:17] suffer now how many of us willing to
[1:21:19] suffer
[1:21:21] because of your brother or sister right
[1:21:24] amen well that's what it says if you
[1:21:26] want if you want to keep the unity of
[1:21:29] the spirit of the bond of peace
[1:21:30] that's what you're going to do you're
[1:21:32] going to suffer you're going to endure
[1:21:35] amen you're going to you're going to
[1:21:37] endure forbearing
[1:21:39] endeavoring now endeavoring is to give
[1:21:42] diligence or
[1:21:43] labor work out
[1:21:46] give work labor diligence
[1:21:51] suffering patient humility
[1:21:54] well first of all none of those will
[1:21:56] happen if we're not humbling ourselves
[1:21:58] to the lord into whatever his purpose
[1:22:01] or humbling ourselves to one another
[1:22:04] amen being humble towards one another
[1:22:07] and letting the lord
[1:22:08] help each one of us in that same spirit
[1:22:11] right
[1:22:11] and when god does that then god then
[1:22:14] then we can keep and god
[1:22:16] keeps the body tight knit together
[1:22:19] satan will come in and satan will try to
[1:22:21] shake it and rattle it but god can keep
[1:22:23] it together that way see yes yeah
[1:22:25] right i used to read this every year to
[1:22:27] the church in
[1:22:29] my church in saint augustine i don't
[1:22:32] know that i've maybe read it once here
[1:22:34] but at the beginning of every year i
[1:22:37] read it
[1:22:38] and it's a good reminder so as i close
[1:22:41] i'm going to read this it is a word to
[1:22:44] the church
[1:22:46] christ and mystery god revealed love one
[1:22:49] another
[1:22:49] above everything so this is my this is
[1:22:52] my exhortation
[1:22:54] my final to hear today love one another
[1:22:57] above
[1:22:57] everything love one another no matter
[1:23:00] what the devil tries to say
[1:23:02] now you're all one great big sweet group
[1:23:05] now
[1:23:06] but remember my warning see satan won't
[1:23:09] let it stay that way
[1:23:10] no sir he'll shoot everything if he has
[1:23:13] to bring
[1:23:14] somebody in to make his target he'll
[1:23:16] bring in some critic or some unbeliever
[1:23:19] set him down and cause him to fellowship
[1:23:21] with one of the quietness and things
[1:23:23] then he will shoot that guy with some
[1:23:25] kind of poison stuff and he'll start
[1:23:27] through the church with it don't you
[1:23:29] take sides with it now this is just an
[1:23:32] example brother brown's given
[1:23:34] it doesn't have to be somebody coming in
[1:23:36] and shooting some poison
[1:23:38] okay this happens in so many different
[1:23:40] facets
[1:23:42] don't let that poison come and that dark
[1:23:45] hit you don't don't don't let your ear
[1:23:48] be a garbage dump
[1:23:49] right right and he'll start to the
[1:23:52] church with it
[1:23:53] don't you take sides don't you have
[1:23:55] nothing to do with anything else
[1:23:57] you stay right loving sweet kind to one
[1:24:00] another
[1:24:01] pray for that man that he'll be saved
[1:24:03] too
[1:24:04] pray for him or her he says
[1:24:08] right ever who it is just pray for them
[1:24:11] and stick with one another and stay with
[1:24:13] your pastor
[1:24:15] he's the shepherd god give him uh he's a
[1:24:18] shepherd and you give him respect he'll
[1:24:19] lead you through
[1:24:20] he's ordained of god to do so now do you
[1:24:23] remember that the enemy
[1:24:24] will come right and when he does just
[1:24:28] clean that much
[1:24:29] coast together and
[1:24:32] the one that the devil is using for an
[1:24:34] enemy
[1:24:35] he'll either just clean that much closer
[1:24:38] uh uh
[1:24:39] he'll either get out or he will come in
[1:24:41] and be one of you that's all
[1:24:43] don't never clan among one another or
[1:24:46] talk or make yourself clannish we are
[1:24:49] one
[1:24:50] i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you
[1:24:52] i'm going to take you away because
[1:24:53] you're not a right hand
[1:24:55] he's my left hand i wanted to stay right
[1:24:57] there even the tip of my finger i want
[1:24:59] to be
[1:25:00] right there every part of my body stay
[1:25:02] right there
[1:25:03] and god wants us as a body of believers
[1:25:06] to stay
[1:25:06] right exactly with one another
[1:25:09] now you've got tapes on that you've got
[1:25:12] tapes on what we believe you've got
[1:25:13] tapes on discipline the church
[1:25:15] uh how we believe ourselves behave
[1:25:18] ourselves in the church
[1:25:19] how we uh how we got to come here
[1:25:22] together sitting
[1:25:23] together in heavenly places don't stay
[1:25:26] home
[1:25:27] if god is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:25:29] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:25:31] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:25:33] brothers and sisters
[1:25:34] if you don't feel that way then i'll
[1:25:36] tell you it's time you got to pray in
[1:25:38] them
[1:25:39] because we're in the last days where the
[1:25:40] bible exalted us that much
[1:25:42] more even as we see that day approaching
[1:25:46] love one another with christian love
[1:25:48] divine love assemble ourselves together
[1:25:50] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:25:52] and love one another this will all men
[1:25:55] know you're my disciples when you have
[1:25:57] love one for the other
[1:25:58] that's right stay right together if the
[1:26:00] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[1:26:02] sister say lord don't
[1:26:03] ever let a root of bitterness spring up
[1:26:07] causing it which actually that that's
[1:26:10] actually where i got the subtitle from
[1:26:11] my book
[1:26:13] i saw my brother richard giberti one
[1:26:15] time which helped me tremendously get
[1:26:17] the book written and
[1:26:18] and all and he said you really should
[1:26:20] have a subtitle he said the root could
[1:26:21] mean anything
[1:26:22] see the roots all the lord gave me for
[1:26:25] the book
[1:26:25] he said you really should have a
[1:26:27] subtitle with satan and el guardo canelo
[1:26:29] why don't you pronounce that
[1:26:30] sorry butcher i'm sure on on on
[1:26:33] oracle just right behind the tabernacle
[1:26:36] we were sitting there eating and all of
[1:26:38] a sudden this dropped into me right here
[1:26:40] the poison acid of bitterness the root
[1:26:43] of bitterness the root of
[1:26:44] bitterness the poison acid of bitterness
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:48] don't let that root of bitterness spring
[1:26:50] up because it'll affect him and it'll
[1:26:52] take the christ
[1:26:53] right out of your life that poison acids
[1:26:57] and malice and malice and jealousy and
[1:27:00] hatred
[1:27:00] that'll just take the holy spirit right
[1:27:03] away from you
[1:27:04] it'll run him from the tabernacle it'll
[1:27:07] kill the spirit of god or drive it away
[1:27:09] from here
[1:27:10] hurt your pastor it'll do everything
[1:27:13] don't you
[1:27:13] let it do it you just wax that much
[1:27:17] closer together
[1:27:18] take the buckle as the brother testified
[1:27:20] minister here hand that bucket
[1:27:22] buckle see on the whole armor of god put
[1:27:25] it on tight it up move right up closer
[1:27:27] together
[1:27:28] love one another anyhow talk nice to one

[1:27:32] things about one another and god will
[1:27:34] bless you amen
[1:27:36] and god will bless you yes amen
[1:27:39] god will bless you the great warning he
[1:27:42] gave to his church
[1:27:44] yes i believe it's something that we
[1:27:45] take to heart today that we
[1:27:47] that we look to and and and
[1:27:51] and take seriously you say oh it's one
[1:27:54] so wonderful
[1:27:56] i think about that and i pray when i'm
[1:27:58] praying sometimes and
[1:28:00] and i i'm thanking god for all the
[1:28:02] miracles he's done for us and all the
[1:28:04] things all the
[1:28:05] healings and keeping safe and protection
[1:28:07] and
[1:28:08] and all the the the hedge of god that he
[1:28:11] keeps around us safe and
[1:28:13] healthy and and i thank him for that
[1:28:16] so many times and then and then
[1:28:20] and then i start remembering lord but
[1:28:22] keep us keep us close to you
[1:28:24] yes keep us close to you as we stay
[1:28:26] close together
[1:28:28] each one of us stay close together as we
[1:28:30] stay close to him
[1:28:32] and don't let that devil come in don't
[1:28:33] let that chism come in
[1:28:35] don't let anything come in there that'll
[1:28:37] bring a division or
[1:28:38] some kind of a little sting or something
[1:28:41] just
[1:28:42] let it go away pray to the lord pray
[1:28:44] with that person
[1:28:45] whatever it needs to be to keep that all
[1:28:48] together
[1:28:49] together is how we conquer the enemy
[1:28:53] amen one coal out by itself will surely
[1:28:57] should shortly die but when it's in a
[1:29:00] nice roaring fire

[1:36:34] we'll miss you all very much so amen and
[1:36:37] remember these announcements and um
[1:36:41] seems like i'm missing something of the
[1:36:43] buildings the same things
[1:36:45] going on with that right now just
[1:36:46] continue to remember to pray
[1:36:49] for the situation as a whole i can't
[1:36:53] i i you know i talked to the lord about
[1:36:56] it
[1:36:56] but i haven't got any direct leadership
[1:36:58] other than that as of now
[1:37:01] but when something like this happens i
[1:37:03] can't help but feel there's something
[1:37:04] else going on
[1:37:05] right there's a reason why this is being
[1:37:08] delayed like it is
[1:37:09] i don't know right right not prophesying
[1:37:13] i i just uh i'm just telling you what's
[1:37:16] on my heart so
[1:37:17] so please just pray for that if you
[1:37:19] would we're all a part of this
[1:37:21] and all the part of the same i'm i'm you
[1:37:23] know it's working out fine here but i
[1:37:26] don't want to stay here
[1:37:28] but the lord's doing something so
[1:37:30] whatever it is we just want to step into
[1:37:32] it
[1:37:32] right yes two things um where are we
[1:37:35] going
[1:37:36] after this room and what time can we go
[1:37:40] into it
[1:37:41] you're going right now and it's right
[1:37:42] next door okay and the second thing
[1:37:44] is i want i'm considering i wanted to
[1:37:48] run it by you first
[1:37:49] if we could put a little sign in the
[1:37:51] foyer announcing that we're having
[1:37:53] church services here so that people that
[1:37:55] blow through the mayor maybe the
[1:37:56] christians that are missing having
[1:37:58] service on a sunday
[1:37:59] can come in or people that aren't
[1:38:02] you know yeah okay absolutely okay
[1:38:05] thought about that too it's a great idea
[1:38:07] can you run it by the
[1:38:09] desk and um i'll ask them i don't think
[1:38:12] they'll care
[1:38:13] we'll probably have to keep it out of
[1:38:15] the aisle but it'll be where people can
[1:38:18] see it
[1:38:19] i don't have a computer so i can't make
[1:38:21] a sign that's okay
[1:38:22] okay thank you okay great for israel
[1:38:26] amen well yeah absolutely
[1:38:30] um yeah there's a there's a whole lot
[1:38:34] going on
[1:38:37] it made me think about uh a lot of
[1:38:40] things that's going on that's part of it
[1:38:46] when they say peace peace sudden
[1:38:48] destruction
[1:38:50] right a sign before trump went out of
[1:38:52] office they signed
[1:38:53] four peace agreements between israel and
[1:38:55] arabs
[1:38:56] four they hadn't had peace like that
[1:38:59] whatever maybe and now all of a sudden
[1:39:02] you see what's happening
[1:39:03] now it's by a different group it's not
[1:39:06] it's not a
[1:39:07] it's not a violation of one of the four
[1:39:09] treaties those four treaties are holding
[1:39:11] this is a whole different arab group uh
[1:39:14] the united states gave them a half a
[1:39:16] billion dollars and they took that half
[1:39:18] a billion dollars and went to iran and
[1:39:19] bought a bunch of rockets to shoot over
[1:39:21] to israel
[1:39:22] now israel's retaliating and it's uh
[1:39:24] it's a situation
[1:39:26] uh i'm seeing and i want to make this a
[1:39:28] part of a whole other message but
[1:39:31] there's a lot a lot lot more evidence
[1:39:34] and videos and things of
[1:39:37] uh stuff flying around up there amen
[1:39:40] nobody knows what it is except for the
[1:39:42] bride
[1:39:43] yes amen maybe think about that meeting
[1:39:46] in the air
[1:39:47] he was singing today yes amen they're
[1:39:50] flying around
[1:39:51] up there brother brown just said don't
[1:39:53] worry about a little children
[1:39:54] pick you up one of these days yes amen
[1:39:57] anyway
[1:39:58] we'll just leave that for another time
[1:40:00] but absolutely brother pat
