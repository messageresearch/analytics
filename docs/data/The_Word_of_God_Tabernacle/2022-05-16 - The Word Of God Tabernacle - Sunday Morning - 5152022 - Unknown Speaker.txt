TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is here yes we're living in the darkest days amen probably maybe spiritually in the history of man is this time yes you know we talk about looking and waiting for a rapture yeah about how children the world is supposed to be yet during that forget about how dark horses horrible demonic praise the lord we're looking for his coming at any moment in time praise the lord amen praise the lord i don't know how about you but saints i feel this power she coming through this place today and last week it was kind of sweet and the spirit and the lord just flowed through and today it just feels like there's just such an anointing amen the power of god just so real praise the lord jesus amen yes praise the lord he is brother pat amen let's stand to our feet now amen and turn in the bible appraisal we're going praise the lord jesus thankful god makes the way he always does doesn't he yes amen praise the lord despite our faults and failures and mistakes he always does praise the lord you know i read a thing on facebook the other day that it probably was yesterday yes he said the biggest problem with going outside of the will of god to get what you want is you have to stay outside of god's will to keep it right i thought that was quite profound amen if you have to go outside of the perfect will of god to get what you want you have to stay outside of god's will to keep it amen fine this i thought that was outstanding so praise the lord we'll turn our bibles first peter chapter 5 amen first peter chapter 5 verse 1 amen i had intended to start on a series today and uh maybe if the lord will uh maybe next week i don't know if it's up to him but um he put something on my heart just something else on my heart yesterday that i want to bring to you today so amen trust to be a blessing to you first peter chapter five i'm gonna begin reading with verse one and then god bless you thank you for being here thank you if you may be streaming today amen welcome you in the name of the lord jesus first peter chapter 5 verse 1 4 read the word let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could precious lord jesus father we are so very thankful today god your grace your love your mercy your blessings to us lord it's so bountiful in our lives lord where would we be without it god is just something that we can know that when adversity strikes our lives our homes our families lord that we can stand true and hold fast to that type host jesus christ the word that promised never to leave us or forsake us it's a time that our faith is exercised to bring to a place lord that we can believe and know god that you have everything under control it's all in your hands and that god you're going to take care of everything on our behalf we thank you lord for this time of fellowship thank you so much lord for this our sixth anniversary today lord it's hard to believe god has been six years but lord i'm so thankful that i believe father know that you've been with us every step of the way god there was just a few of us in the very first service six years ago but here we are today god and i'm so thankful for those that are here i'm thankful for those that have called that you've led to be here lord to call this their home church and lord all those who may stream or whatever god i'm just so very thankful father because it's your home it's your sanctuary it's your work and lord would just help us to be faithful in it lord what you call each one of us in each one of our parts to play in this service and this and in this church lord we pray god that your holy spirit would have preeminence once again the remaining part of this service the ministering of your word as we open back the pages of this word that's all we can do lord we can read it the lord it takes you to reveal it to our hearts and to show us in here what you'd have us to see and know that every part of this word although the world may try and other denominations may try to denounce certain parts of it because it doesn't dovetail with their particular doctrine or belief or dogma but lord it must every bit come in dovetail and perfect uh unity together lord because this word is you in letter form and there's not one thing out of place with you lord god we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt him or infiltrate this service in any way feeling the anointing of the power of your spirit flowing through here right now god to do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think praying right now lord that you take full control over every one of us speaker in here alike that what you would have to be accomplished in this service today will be so as we committed fully into your hands once again in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first peter chapter 5 verse 1 the elders which are among you i exhort who am also who who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucra but of a ready mind neither as being lords over god's heritage but being in samples to the flock and when the chief shepherds shall appear we ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away and you can be seated if you like we actually took this scripture not too long ago but on a different topic i want to major on that second verse there uh that talks about not being by constraint but willingly amen not being by constraint but willingly the title i want to have though today is god the gentleman that's my title god the gentleman which goes with not by constraint but willingly amen god loves that your forgiver right and god always wants those people to serve him willingly god wants every one of us to serve him willingly he wants us to be his children because we are always were his children but because we want to we want he wants us to live the way he wants us to live not by force but because he wants us to live that way there's nothing forceable god's a gentleman friend he doesn't force himself on anyone in fact god doesn't force anybody to serve him nor does god want anybody to serve him by force god doesn't want anybody to disconnect that has to serve him by force he wants us to willingly not constrain now this of course was to the ministers and the and the heritage or those that god has given authoritative positions to not do it to the individuals by constraint but willingly but it comes as a as an overall understanding and feeling belief that we as christians do what we do willingly we live for god willingly we do what we do because we want to do it because god's word dictates to us that we do it that way but we don't do it because it's forced on us by god's word we do it because we love him and we want to please him in that way you know the things that i do for my family or the things that i've done for my wife here almost 37 years the end of this month i've done willingly i've done because i've wanted to my wife has not forced me she has not made me nor have i heard i haven't forced her or made her she what she's done to serve me to serve our family she's done willingly and that's exactly and that's a relationship and that's exactly what god wants with his children is a relationship he doesn't want to be lord over us although he is he doesn't want to lord over us although he does but we do it because because we want to do it she served me because she wanted to serve me we as his bride serve him because we want to serve him we do it willingly from our hearts we are not deceived peter said uh later on there in second peter that that we are not a deceived people we don't do this by deception we do it with a willing heart and a willing mind because we know what his word says we know what is pleasing to the lord amen a lot of people have ideas of what they're what would be pleasing to the lord and they live their lives as thus i'm assuming all christians they i assume all christians live their lives in a way that they feel will be pleasing to god i i can only assume that and if they do that then you figure that the way they live is the way that is pleasing to the lord but friend the only way i know of to be pleasing to my god is to follow the word that he gave me amen that's the only way i know to do it right and if you follow the word he gave it's going to be a word of holiness it's going to be a life of holiness it's not a life of dictation it's it's not a light life of legalism it's a life of freedom it's it's a life of serving god in the way that god calls for us to serve him it's not legalism it's holiness it's because of a standard that god has called us to a standard of life that his children live god has called his children you read the scripture of course a lot of people probably bypass that scripture but the bible says if you love the word of the things of the world god how god's not even in you yes god can't even be a part of your life brother madam even said don't pattern yourself after the world yes amen why do you think brother bannon was against crew cuts you know brother bannon spoke harshly against crew cuts even though it made the man's hair really short because it was a patterning of the world at that time that's why he said that being patterned after the world we're not supposed to be like the world we're not supposed to look like the world we're not supposed to act like the world god's word for those who don't know has called for a total separation from all unbelief what's unbelief anything that's against this word not a man's interpretation of it not a man's idea of what it says but what the word says to us that's what we live because we want to because we love god so much that we would be willing to look the way we look and act the way we act and don't go places the world goes or and do things the world thinks is foolish or won't do we do it because we love him they love him so much we're willing to do that in accordance to his word not accordance to a man's word according to god's word not according to a denomination's dogma but according to god's word some people call us a cult i got news for you saints that's just a buzzword to try to put fear on people you don't want to know the truth we are a cult amen anybody that says they're a christian is a cult yes if you're a christian and you're not a cult you're not a christian every definition of what this country deems as a cult today jesus christ fit every one of them well if you're a servant of his then you're one of him right then you're identified with that then you're considered to them as a cult well praise god i thank god i follow jesus christ my lord let me read you something i i actually looked up a definition today just because i was thinking about it and it came on my heart i looked up in webster's dictionary occult defined now this is not the government okay what i mentioned before was the government's definition the united states definition of a cult this was real big when it came with david koresh and the waco and all that that was a big issue then and of course it's still a buzzword um i i they may do it but i've never heard it but i don't know what the republicans call democrats occults but i've heard democrats call the republicans cults or or those that believe donald trump was a good president they used that word not just for a christian you understand but look at this see so they they try to place everybody in that in that category a system of religion uh veneration and devotion directed towards a particular figure amen what is that is that not who we are as christians hallelujah all of our veneration devotion devotion is directed towards him amen amen amen well then you're a cult amen if all of your veneration devotion love is not directed toward him then you're not a christian right and if it is you're a cult so they can people can say what they want but that's this right here a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister guilty amen he was considered so strange and so sinister they hung him on a cross yes colt amen well then people can say what they want friend they can classify you how they want but that's just the fact of the matter right and what they use and what people don't understand is in so many ways take the religious part out of it in some way shape or form they're occult too amen i remember this story brother green told him he met this man and he was talking said oh that man said oh i i don't follow a man i don't of course brother green's like oh we don't follow a man either oh yeah y'all believe this message so on so forth he said but i don't follow a man i i i refuse to do that i follow jesus christ i don't follow just any human man and he got to talk and brother greek got to talk to the man and talking to him and finding out his background and his life and everything and come to find out everything the man talked about he did was because his wife told him to he told him later he said sir i believe you're right you don't follow a man you follow a woman amen the point of that is somebody everybody follows somebody usually in some way shape or form but our following is him amen amen praise the lord my coldhood is i'm a christian and he is my lord and my savior my god and i love him so much i'm willing to do whatever his word abraham loved him so much he actually was willing to take his only son and sacrifice him now god doesn't accept human sacrifice we know that but he was willing to do it because of his love for god now if that ain't the definition of a cold i don't know what is so people with loose lips which we know seek shift people with loose lips don't know what they're talking about slap out these buzzwords to try to make people feel guilty and try to put people down when the fact of the matter is they just need to find out what they're talking about and know what they're saying so they can stand upon what they say they believe amen they believe it well your life will dictate to you what you believe amen if you believe it you're going to live it you're going to do what the word says amen god does not want to have anybody serve him forcibly right he wants them to do it willingly because it's from your heart let's go to romans chapter 6. now i got a whole nother thing to this see god's god's a gentleman that's the whole point of this see god's a gentleman he doesn't force himself on anybody god is not going to come down with the louisville slugger and make you serve him he's not going to bash you inside the head until you serve him no he's a gentleman we are free moral agents that's why the world is the way it is today could god have forced his spirit on everybody to fall down sure he could they will one day one day every knee will bow every time we'll confess could he do it now sure he could yeah absolutely but he doesn't want us to he doesn't want people to serve him that way he wants to do he wants to be served he wants us to live for him because we desire to because we want to and the only way to do that is to obey his word jesus said if you love me keep my commandments do what i tell you amen if you don't do what i tell you it just proves you don't love me amen and and that's that probably sums it up romans chapter 6 verse 11. paul hear the roman church he said likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof now what is sin sin is missing the mark sin is unbelief and missing the mark of what this unbelief of what this amen amen that's all sin is it's missing the mark unbelief of this his word so if it's unbelief of his word if it's missing the mark of this word then it is deemed sin let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof there you go lust of people's flesh the pride of life that's exactly how most people fall that's how they go into it unfortunately it seems like a lot of churches are allowing people to manipulate themselves to the place that that's how they live they actually live their lives and conduct their business based on the lust of their life instead of on god's holy word it makes me wonder and ask and i'll ask it even of myself newton are you projecting your life are you projecting yourself are you living in a way that is complementary to the word of god and to the holy spirit are you dressing are you acting are you talking are you living in a way that others would see christ in you or do you just look like another member of the world do you just act like another member of the world do you just say see one of the biggest cults there is in the world today is the devil a lot of people don't know that but the devil's the biggest cult there is in the world today they worship him without even knowing it right they serve him without even knowing it so it serves to understand this moral body paul says this mortal body are you living in a way do you that that would be when people look and say now there's a christian or they look at a room and say well i don't see any difference in any of them right well half of them go to this church and half of them are the other half of a third are atheists the other third are agnostics can't tell the difference amen well something's wrong in that picture friend am i amen there's got to be a there is a difference when a person is born again and filled with the spirit of god there's a difference in that person's life it'll that that spirit will live through them and it won't live through them of the dictates that we see in the world it'll live through them to the holiness of this word it's a holy standard not legalism a holiness standard look at this neither yield your members see those those lusts are taken over now neither neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god now unfortunately a lot of people have taken that scripture and subsequent ones with some three and applied it in their lives in a way that they feel like that the grace of god though it does cover all sins it does but that it that through the spirit of that nicolaitan and catholicism that it it affords them the right and the ability to live however they want to and still be okay it doesn't matter god doesn't care how you dress well then why are there so many scriptures in the bible old testament and new that refer to the clothes that you wear if he doesn't care why is it in there oh god doesn't care how you wear your hair then why there's so many scriptures old testament and new that tells us that god cares am i bad if he didn't why would it be in here of course he does oh god doesn't care about this he absolutely does he cares about your mortal flesh yes he does as a christian this is supposed to be the temple of the holy ghost it is supposed to be sacred and holy i remember i was talking to my barber thursday and i remember this story this older lady she wasn't uh say elderly but she was older i said man my wife saw this older lady probably 75 80 years old in the cracker barrel the other day monday i think it was she had a tattoo right here and it was and sony said well maybe she got it now it was fresh you could tell you know when they get old they start spreading out and they just kind of you know become a big black blob but this was very defined you could tell it was it was it was it was fresh and new and i thought wow why would what would compel a 75 year old woman to go get a tattoo and it reminded me and i told my barber uh thursday this uh older lady these younger kids was talking to her and said hey uh uh man why why don't you go ahead and get tattoo or ink they call it ink cause why don't you go get some ink you know that's kind of the cool uh way of putting it you know get some ink i've got ink and they go get this and their body and that and that lady looked at those kids and says why in the world would i put a bumper sticker on a rolls royce oh man amen i agree with you lady don't know who it was don't know if she's a christian or what but make good sense amen why would i do that praise the lord amen now yielding yourselves members as instruments of righteousness unto god but look down because people take that they take that and they say well the grace of god will cover the grace of god will take care of i i know i live this way but the god god will take care god the grace of god will cover over that willful purposeful sin god grace can take care of it yes but that's that's not the purpose of the grace amen the purpose of the grace is our humanity it's to be used uh to alleviate our and help our humanity not as a crutch not as an excuse to sin look what paul goes on to say for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace then paul says obviously he was questioned what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace paul said god forbid amen well that could just have however the one because of the grace of god no paul they questioned him here and he says shall i live however i want to because the grace of god will take care of it god said and paul said god forbid amen we don't take the grace of god and make a disgrace out of it know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness it's like i said satan is the biggest cult today he has the greatest following he has the most influence we know we're in satan's eating amen and anything outside from the garden of eden friend anything outside of the word of god 100 is of the devil amen so if you yield your members to obey that's whose servant you are if you're yielding your memories in obedience to to a to a church or denomination or to the the government of the whims of of the devil then that's who you're serving and that's the cult but god be thanked that ye were the serp that ye were that ye were amen you with me now that you were past tense you were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart praise the lord not because you were forced to not because you were made to amen now i know i said earlier we train our children the way they should go we make them live a certain life and act a certain way or dress a certain way because that's our responsibility as parents a lot of times today as we know brother branham said it's parent delinquency and not child delinquency because parents just let their kids do whatever live however and and and well it doesn't matter what your chromosome said son you can be a girl if you want to it doesn't work that way or it it can for them they can get some medical doctor or something but in god's eyes that's a slap in the face of god's omnipotence amen his creation from the beginning he made a man and a woman amen god did not make a man be born into this world but was supposed to be a woman god doesn't do that right now slap in the face of god look here now god be thanked that you were the servants of sins but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you amen and you trained your children you raise them right the actual scripture says train the child in the way they should go not in the way the government says they should go not in the way some not even some not even another person in your church it's not up to me to raise your children it's up to you right you train them and the way they should go praise the lord what way is that the way of the lord amen that's the only way you can go that's the only way train them according to this work oh no i just let my kid live however i just let them go and do however i can't tell you how many times you probably experienced it to me and my wife are going to restaurant or me and other people one time i believe we were the olive guard the one on valencia or irvington excuse me and we were standing there sitting there eating and this little kid was a table big gap in between it was a table on the other side that had a little kid and that kid spent almost the entire uh meal jumping and dancing and running and all kinds of stuff friend if i had done that i wouldn't have been able to sit down if my son or daughter had tried that you can ask them afterwards well if they would have been able to sit down amen that's just what the bible says and i thought are they are these people are ever going to teach this child the right way to be right and i tell you what i stand here and i have got to tell you how proud i am of you especially parents are trying zach tabitha these little kids are sitting here so politely quietly nicely in church three four seven eight children amen politely quietly god bless you that that is that is a jewel in your crown right there right amen that is pleasing to the lord yes because of those children you see training them the way they should go i remember and i won't say i've had people ask me in the past well but my child won't behave i said you bring them there anyway you teach them that's what they're supposed to do that's where they're supposed to be but they'll disrupt service we'll be okay god will take care of that people understand bring them yes amen that's how you teach them amen and look praise the lord that's the way it's supposed to be look from your heart now let's get back to this amen don't be too long from your heart that's that's that's our part god the gentleman we yield unto god it's from the heart for that form of doctrine which was delivered to you what doctrine the word of god god's word being that people make excuse for that people will try to uh uh make excuses for for the word of god well i i don't want to work live like that well then you don't belong to god or maybe you do and you just don't know it yet i mean we've all rebelled at some points and times let's continue being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness see so being made free doesn't mean you live however you want to being made free means that you're free to become a servant of righteousness praise the lord you mean i've been liberated to be a servant absolutely you've been made free now we serve willingly we live our lives willingly to the word of god because that's our desire now i want to go to a story saint luke and i want to finish this up with this story because there's there's very good lessons has just been preached on many many times i have myself i believe i even have uh been a while since i read it but i believe even have this story in my book at least to some degree god's looking for someone to serve him with their heart we're going to luke chapter 15. i didn't mention that luke 15 he wants somebody he wants a people to serve him with their heart because it's in their heart to do so not to be forced to do it i'm not a child of god because i joined a church i'm not a child of god because i preach or because i can sing a gospel hymn i i'm not a child of god because my name is on an earthly church role of some kind i'm a child of god because in god's mind before the world was formed i was there i was in his lawrence i was a child before the world ever started we know that according to the scripture you go back in revelation it tells you before the world began i've been a child of god my whole life whether i knew it whether i act like it whether i wanted to be or not i was i didn't force myself to be obedient i was born a bit amen there might have been times i didn't want to be but i was anyway now that's just a name of course your character of course defines you way farther than just a name tag to you but you understand my point i was born of that lineage i was the son of mom my mom and dad that because a surname of bennett that made me that as thus that's the only reason i am whether i wanted to be or not was my choice although some crazy guy i think in the india uh wanted to sue his parents because he didn't want to be born right he was suing his parents because his parents birthed him and he didn't want to be born the craziness today i i told the lord this morning i said god if this is if sodom and gomorrah was worse than we are today mercy how much more has it got to be how much fuller does the cup of iniquity have to get right you just look around saints and i just it's just incredible now to the worldly people the ungodly people they don't care or nominal christians even they don't care that's just the way of the world it's just the way things go it doesn't bother them but it bothers the holy ghost field born again christian yes it vexes just like it did uh it vexes our righteous soul daily just like lot they're in sodom vexes righteous soul daily what does it do to us but that's where we're sitting but see i did i i wasn't made a child of god and a lot of people thinking in the christian world that they became a christian when they came to an altar or they became a child of god excuse me they became a child of god when they came to the altar they became a child of god when they uh came into the church or they became a child of god when they were born again that's not when you became a child of god if you're a child of god you were always a child of god it didn't matter where you were didn't matter what you was going through didn't matter what family you were born into didn't matter you wanted to or not you get to the place where you're thankful because you realize who you were who you are but that's how you're a child of god let's read this luke 15 11. the lord gives certain examples of the things that were lost and found a certain man had two sons the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that followed to me and he divided unto them his living not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living now that riotous is a twofold purpose as a twofold meaning yes righteous as an ungodly own holy immoral living yes but it also means that he spent his substance without regard of money right it meant nothing to him he served his dad of course in the fields of whatever they did as a son to his dad but he didn't have a value of money and so this riotous means that without regard of money you know that most people who win the lottery are broke within 10 years because they didn't earn it it was just given to them yeah they won some prize and it was just given to them and and as dust they just spin it like it's nothing i think oh i got a million dollars this will last forever no it doesn't right that client friend of ours mary just sold their house up in the foothills for seven hundred and forty thousand dollars there goes a million right there amen they go oh this will last forever and his and that riotous yes immoral living but it was he he just spent the money without regard of money he just spent it like it was water like it was gonna last forever and that's the way a lot of people do the exact same way just like it doesn't mean anything because they didn't work for it it was given to him and this was given to him so it doesn't it didn't mean to him what it should that's why again a lot of the lottery winners go broke after 10 years or whatever it is because it just doesn't mean to them and i remember brother uh ron carpenter up in the mountains he was a drywall guy he would go on the reservation and do a lot of reservation work and he said they would build brand new houses now this is not a knock on the uh the native american or anything like that it's just what our country's done uh it's just i'm an american and i'm proud to be one but friend we've got some dark parts of our history we know that right good bad or indifferent it just it is what it is and it lingers into today because of how we treated them and he said they'll go and the government would just they gave him all this land that was theirs to begin with you know brother graham called geronimo a gentleman anyway it was theirs to begin with but they build up all these houses brand new houses that they can just live in go here this is your house this is your house it's called it and brother ron says he'll go in less than a year and he'll have to fix that house all up again because he's tore all the pieces yeah a year they tear apart a brand new house in a year why it was given to them right they didn't earn it the respect of it just wasn't there and so that it didn't mean anything to them they tore it apart probably knowing that they would uh they would contract somebody to go back and fix it up again right holds big holes in the wall liquor bottles everywhere just just a mess now again that's not a knock on them just reality unfortunately in a lot of cases that's just the reality but when something is is is earned it means more but when you look at salvation for just a moment if you look at salvation it's a free gift god give it to us freely but if that spirit of god some people trash it and some people run all over it along with the blood of christ and some people it doesn't mean as much to them they weren't born again filled with the spirit so this salvation doesn't mean as much to them they trample all over it and they treat it like well no matter what i do salvation is always going to be there no it's not this man burnt through his money oh it's always going to be there but it wasn't it's always there until it's not right and people just think oh well the salvation is just always going to be there no it's not right if you trample all over the blood of christ and you reject his word and that message of truth then god have mercy on you what else can you say but for the true believer the born again holy ghost filled believer that salvation though it was a free gift from god it cost him everything he give to us freely that we respect and that we appreciate and that we revere that salvation that god give us but some people just don't it doesn't mean anything to them they didn't earn it right amen and i didn't earn this i couldn't have earned it it was no way there's no possible human way i could have ever earned my own salvation right can't happen can't do it yes that's why he came because he knew we needed it we were his children he knew he needed it and he gave it to us praise the lord and we appreciate it we thank god for it he just this uh uh prodigal son wasted his substance with ungodly living and burnt through his money like it didn't mean anything and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want god knows exactly how situations dictate things in our lives doesn't he amen you ever tried to run from god in a certain situation dictated a certain circumstance in your life to kind of give you a nudge back in that direction right amen give you just a little bit nudge god doesn't force anybody god doesn't make anybody but sometimes we just we need that little pull we need that little nudge god will allow circumstances to happen satan thinks oh i'm pounding him into the ground what he doesn't realize is he's just driving that child of god back to where he's supposed to be praise the lord aren't you glad the devil's just a tool in the hand of god amen so many people scared to death of the devil he's just a tool in the hand of god you know the devil do things and think oh i'm taking care of that person now and all their all he's doing is just taking that child of god and putting them back where they're supposed to be amen amen well that's the whole premise of this story isn't it amen it's been all he had he began to be in one there came a famine in the land he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country went and sent him who went and sent him in the fields to feed swine which is the nastiest lowest worst job you can have anybody ever slot pigs you slapped pigs yeah i should know yeah southern people that's kind of a thing we did a lot of times i saw pigs it's nasty filthy pigs eat their own excrement and everything it's just gross the pig pigpen is one of the nastiest things i've ever been in my life just smells and they just wallow in it and i'm sorry i don't mean to be disgusting but they'll poop and pee and just roll right over in it and just flop flop around around and just love it they just love it and slopping them pigs this is just nasty it's a really disgusting thing if you've never done it i don't recommend it but it's a nasty uh sloppy pig that's what he's doing here this citizen of the country has sent him out to do the most disgusting thing in the most disgusting place and anything all the devil's saying oh i'll get him doing this and he'll really be distraught no it just what it did was this he began to realize 16th first that he would fain have filled his belly with the hust that the swine did eat and no man gave to him amen no man can you imagine passing by nobody having compassion on this man praise the lord god knows how to soften a heart god knows how to harden the heart he sent moses to pharaoh and he hardened pharaoh's heart maybe god hardened every one of these people's heart not to give this boy anything nobody gave him anything and when he came to himself praise the lord all that the devices of the enemy the nastiness that satan had put him in all it did was drive him back to who he was he came to himself so what does that mean if he came to himself that means that where he was was not in his right position it was not in his we'll even say right mind he may not have been mentally unstable i don't mean that but he wasn't in his right mind right position of who he was called to be boy you are the son of that leader that king that's who you are and he fell from that position and he was ready to stick his face in with that nasty disgusting slop of the hog when he came to himself praise the lord he realized my daddy has servants has land has cattle has houses my daddy owns it all praise it if you will my daddy owns it all papa god owns it all right and i'm sitting here in the slop of this pen eating out of this worldly slop oh my i believe that's where we were we come to ourselves maybe in a denomination head long face deep in that mess right when you came to yourself and said i'm this is not me this is not who i was born to be this is not revealed to me that i'm a child of the king amen and he came to himself that means at that time he wasn't himself when he left when he spent all his money when he lived ungodly that wasn't him because he never was not a son he was always a son he didn't stop being this man's son when he ran away he didn't stop being this man's son when he was face deep in that hog swap he was never not a son i know i've said that many times friend but to me that's pure goal to realize no matter where you've been what you've done what you've gone through run hide whatever you try you can never escape the fact of who you are amen amen yes i'm a child of the king yes praise the lord he came to himself and he said how many heart servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare but i'll perish with hunger i will arise to go to my father well say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee he humbled himself amen he found a place of humility he found an altar somewhere which is your heart amen may not be down at the church there the pulpit or something the altar is in your heart yes he found that altar he found that space of repentance and he came to himself and recognized my father and he was really who his father was he was willing to repent he was willing to leave behind the world behind everything that he had suffered the past time period he was gone he was willing to leave it all behind and come to his father and i'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of the hard servants he arose came to his father but when he was a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him since the son said unto him father i have sinned against god heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy sons you know what his daddy was doing oh would you say something his daddy could have cared less that little that little exhortation he gave his daddy was like went right through him his daddy wasn't concerned about that why because his son was home that's all he cared about he didn't care oh daddy maybe you're one of your hired servants no no no you're my son i don't care what you did i don't care where you've been i don't care what you're going through you're my son so whatever this young man said uh i've sinned against heaven against in and in thy sight and nowhere nor more worthy to be called thy sons dad couldn't care less about that what did the father respond but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet bring heather the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be married for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they begin to be married look at this as i close here in just a minute he said for this my son praise the lord he designated he recognized and he made sure the entire kingdom heard and understood this is my son praise the lord jesus he's not an astray vessel he's my son he came to himself and he realized he was my son and now he's here and he's still my son when he was out there he was still my son he's here now and he's still my son and he's letting the whole kingdom know this is my son he was dead but now he's alive now look at this it says again now i'm not going to read the rest of the story the father says that twice he was dead but he's alive again so that means he was here at one time praise the lord he was in the position that he was supposed to be who he was born to be at one time and he fell from that place just like people who become dead in their trespasses and sins it's a spiritual death but now he's alive again he has come to himself and he has realized who he was born to be and now he's come back home and now we're going to kill the fatted cat we're gonna put a ring on his finger we're gonna put shoes on his feet and we're gonna celebrate and have and be merry and have a celebration because my son who was lost is now found he came back to himself he was lost but see the the man he never went hunting for we don't see anywhere where the man went hunting for his son we don't see anywhere in here where he compelled somebody or something else or whatever god just this man which i believe of course the representation of the lord and us this man just let his son go he just let him go here it is just go knowing having faith believing that's not who he is amen that out there is not who he is amen this right here is who he is because he's my son amen he doesn't belong to the devil he belongs to me he's mine praise the lord don't belong to the world belongs to me amen praise the lord and the stand that this man took and the word that it was told it just took faith and that's all we can have today that's all we can believe today because every one of us in some way at some time in some capacity has tried to run from god every one of us have yes except maybe the little bit i'm not sure emma's tried that but alice but almost every one of us adults at one point in time in our lives amen people say oh when i was out in the world i got myself in a mess you can't get yourself in such a mess that god can't take care of it amen oh there may be residual effects from that but god's able to take care of that god's able to make take every wrong every mistake that you make and he's able to turn around and make it right and make it to work together for our good evening praise the lord it's just sometimes unfathomable to believe how loving and merciful and kind and giving that god is and how much he loves his children yes you know man has been trying to run from the presence of god since the beginning of time in the garden of eden when sin first entered what did adam do he hid well he thought he could hide amen he got in the bushes anyway him and his wife who wasn't named eve at the time the woman right hid in the bush or they tried to hide they tried to run from god and men have been trying to do that ever since we talked about jonah the other day how many times have men in the bible that we see abraham try to run from god but god always has a way god always makes a way because you know what there's something that's down in there that cries out that says this is not who i was born to be this is not who i'm supposed to be i'm a child of god i don't belong here this is not my heritage i'm a child of god and god makes a way and takes care of in our lives to bring us back to where we're supposed to be because he's a gentleman god's a gentleman he never forces himself on anybody yes he never makes you do anything and he's not going to now amen but thank god that through him we can have faith and trust to believe that god's taking care of god's hand in every situation amen god's handling praise the lord let's stand if we could we need to make sure we continually ask ourselves is is my life pleasing to the lord is the way i'm living my life is how i'm acting what i'm doing is that pleasing to the lord am i is that something that god would be happy with unfortunately too many people they don't read the word they don't know what's pleasing to god all they do is hear what some man tells them and i've told you here many many times you don't go by what i say you go about what this says i'm going to do everything within my power saints to stay within the pages of this book of this book this bible this sacred word amen but don't take my word for it you read it for yourself amen amen your relationships not between with god is not me him and me you and him it's you and him amen you don't take brother branham's word for it you find it in here yes amen let god reveal it to him you're his child he'll show you he'll reveal it to you he'll let you know amen you say well i don't understand this just put it on the shelf close it up just put that thing on the shelf and say lord it's just gonna stay there at some point in time lord if you feel fit to reveal it to me and brother graham said he'll reveal it to you when you have need of knowing it okay and then the lord and you might be reading something listening to a tape reading the scripture and god will just open that up to you and say oh my you take that thing off the shelf and you put it right in here you said there it is amen that's it and then god makes it all dovetail that's why so many people denominations people they want to try to discard or or or get rid of certain things in the scripture because it doesn't dovetail with their doctrine right it doesn't dovetail with their beliefs it doesn't doubt even in the message people take things that quotes brother brown they'll just dismiss them and say oh well they just dismiss him because it doesn't dovetail with what their doctrine is with what their belief is but this word dovetails genesis 1 to revelation 22 and ain't one single word out of line amen because this is christ in letter form amen and we believe it praise the lord we believe it and hold to it let's sing this amen let's sing a song before we go today got a little order of business before we leave but i i ended a little soon so we'll uh write while right at 12 anyway so let's sing this little course here amen well maybe we'll sing the verses too praise the lord believe it amen why is greater is he that's in you because you are who god made you amen amen you're a child of the king greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he than is [Music] the bible tells us [Music] yes [Music] baptized is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] world praise the lord praise the lord amen is he greater in you today greater in you today yes amen praise the lord did him satan that is in the world thank you lord so people can rail they can go on about they can spout their talking points and negativity friends but god has called me who i am amen praise the lord never do i intend plan ever want to stick my face in that hog trough again amen nasty filthy dirty oh god has put something in us that has made us greater not me but him enemies him in

food they have southern food they have mexican food tacos they have baked food fried foods they have breads they have desserts so hopefully you can find something you like uh if you go with me get

when i get there of course we'll take care of everything and you could have the card and you can go and we have the facebook room so they should instruct us i'm assuming but if you get there before anybody else and you go through uh we have at least the section of the room to the left so when you go in you go to the left there's a room there to go in the room at least part of the room's hours if not all of it i'm not sure for sure is in the room so just go to the room and if it looks like people are going to be a little straggler go ahead and start eating pray we can pray together but at least we can get everybody through we'll try to we'll try to make it to where all of us can get there to relatively together at best because if nothing else i like for us to all pray together uh when we get there for the meal so so anybody have any questions okay so when you get in you go in yes okay river turns to the thorny dale at orange grove and as you're going north on thornydale uh it'll be

the second light if you're from orange grove through the second likeness right there on the left right next to culver's what street is that horizon hills uh yeah it's horizon hills coming across yeah
