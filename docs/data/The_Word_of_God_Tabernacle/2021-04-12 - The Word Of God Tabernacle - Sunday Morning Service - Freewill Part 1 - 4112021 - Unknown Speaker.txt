uh please continue to pray for uh my good friend uh brother mike holloway he's doing much better better but he needs uh direction on the next step amen this is from sister matisse here um it's a little confused i'm not sure who who it is in relationship to you i believe it's a friend of yours uh if i read this right but there is a woman that she has a general body infection that started with the pain in her liver and was ignored as nothing but it's progressed to meningitis and she's been hospitalized she is a christian and appreciates our prayers is she's a christian is that correct yeah he's a christian i don't know about her oh sorry so it's the husband okay okay so um it's it's a man that is uh has this uh sickness that we want to remember the brother in prayer um and then i'll read a couple that we're saying this morning his wife is in the hospital and he covets our prayer okay so he's he's he's in oz where she's in the hospital she's in the hospital okay she's in the hospital okay so it's a woman a sister that you can prepare as well you may have just remembered both of them in prayer this morning and then this is from sister norma uh prayer uh city uh wants to raise uh the county water thirty to fifty percent i believe she lives way out there she's not in the room right now but i saw her a little bit ago uh but yeah she lives uh way out uh out of the city limits i believe so that would be a big increase to her water bill uh 30 to 50 percent so she's asking that we join uh with her that does not happen until the privately you say that and she wants to also put in a phrase um she asked prayer for her husband's vision and he can now see small letters when he's seven feet away now so thank you lord jesus amen amen thank you lord there's one more here so brother dennis uh he had just gotten his second dose of the vaccine uh the pfizer kovitz shot his left arm and still he's he's having some soreness but he's also feeling really tired this morning um just having some common side effects of uh from the uh shot so i just want to remember him this morning and uh also for her sister pat she has an internal infection that she has had before she's just not feeling well uh there i believe they were on the stream this morning so both brother dennis and the dad so we'll remember your prayer brother and sister brothers and sisters does anyone else here have a prayer request they'd like to make mention yes i'd like to add that we just pray for that man that he can get his room rented in his little trailer because he's got hospital bills oh wow yeah okay okay i didn't understand that part of it okay so he has a room listed for rent the uh the the husband so that's how i found it yeah okay so we'll keep him in prayer for that as well to help with financial needs anyone else this morning yes my daughter is still recovering from a stroke symptoms um he's had a few bad days so just continue sure what is his name daniel daniel i remember daniel in prayer this morning anyone else yeah just a quick one it's an odd one too i just felt to take it to the lord um i have a i'm in an apartment complex downtown and uh my next-door neighbor um he's like l-shaped catty corner to me i don't know if he's autistic or what but he he watches sports and plays video games and you can hear him screaming and yelling and pounding on his desk but it's not normal i've seen guys watch sports and get all worked up but this it's like you can tell it's a demon in him wow um and i don't want him to get kicked out of the apartment but when he's doing this at three four o'clock in the morning then at 8 9 10 in the morning and at night all day it gets a little to where you can't sleep or you can't if i can hear it through my headphones when i'm writing music it's very disruptive so just whatever the lord's will would be with him i hate to see someone so overcome by the devil like that um live down the hall big house his name is sam sam okay i'm not sure if he's a believer or not but i pray the lord would make him a believer and deliver him amen um our let's just stand this morning as we take these needs to the lord and i would ask for prayer for myself as well just been uh struggling with uh it's kind of embarrassing but uh i stubbed my toe a few months ago and it's like it's it's not sprained and i don't think it's spring it feels like a sprain but uh it's still just bothering me uh and it feels like it's getting worse over the last week or so um i saw a telemed doctor they recommended i go in i just i haven't made the time to go in it's just been really busy but uh you know i just prayed that the lord would touch it and i wouldn't have to go in to get it so but yeah anytime i bend it it just hurts it's not it doesn't hurt to touch or anything it doesn't look swollen it's just it's really odd so i haven't had that happen to me before so just pray the lord would touch me this morning brother uh john would you mind just assistant oh sorry yes sister sister sheila i'm so sorry with the gym show endeavor okay lord protect him she says some things are missing already you know oh no wow you know just protection and strength yeah okay we'll do uh crank for the zinkas as they're at the gym show uh selling uh you know gyms there and i guess they're having some theft problems so praise the lord would uh protect them

praise the lord anyone else this morning may god bless you um i've never i've listened to the song but i've never actually played it or practiced it um so pray for me but it's i had three songs i was trying to decide between today but with all the testimonies the song i had practiced the most is not the one i'm gonna sing sing i wish if you know it's called greatly blessed highly favored the gay they're singing so if you know it feel free to sing along the words are just greatly blessed highly favored and perfect but forgiven child of god that repeats and there's a couple verses but at least

beautiful amen i believe every one of us are looking for that time amen calling us home i like the way that that uh verbage that song reads or sounds we're continuing to march forward amen that's the whole point marching onward everybody expects to be some uh great explosion and all of a sudden you're changed from this to that but you know it's a walk yes it's a daily journey that we make and as we make this journey we don't go parallel we go upwards true amen as we become more like him as we become formed more into his image we get closer and closer to him well we're going to him amen praise the lord this third coming or the second coming actually the new testament time is us going to meet him in the air praise the lord amen i like that we're marching to zion amen upward upward amen design praise the lord that's exactly what we're doing moving to him thank you jesus god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord appreciate each one of you coming to being here today amen appreciate the lord most of all moving of his spirit and so good to hear all the wonderful testimonies how the lord's moved on your lives and hearts and prayers has been going up before the lord for daily for so long and just to hear the results and hear god's moving and just trusting him and all things and i'm just so thankful that god is mindful of us he loves us amen he trusts us and whether it's we go to a doctor maybe or a natural remedy is sister julie or just a miracle supernatural touch of god whatever it is god does all the healing amen amen period praise the lord god does all the healing and that's what matters the most we trust him amen for his perfect healing direction leadership amen in all of our lives praise the lord so god bless you let's stand if we could today uh i'm going to begin the reading today uh i mentioned to you a couple weeks ago that this was something the lord had put on my heart and i want to start on this today and trust the lord bless it of course and genesis chapter 1. so it'll probably more than likely be several parts to it but just however genesis chapter 1 verse 26 we'll start with genesis 1 26 before we read the word of god we just bow our heads good for another word of prayer precious lord jesus father it is certainly a great privilege lord to be here today i'm so thankful to you god and all that you do for us lord it just sometimes it gets into your presence and lord when we feel your presence so near god lord i was gonna rebuke those devils but there's not a devil can stay here with this presence here right now and lord i'm so thankful god that you've come and swept into us once again like you did on that day of pentecost father just increasing our faith and blessing us to believe and lord for every miracle every need every question answered dissolve every doubt lord give direction leadership healing lord we just believe father now that you're here with us and sometimes just getting into this presence and lord words escape us lord just uh sometimes you just feel like you could uh run through that wall or run through that troop and jump over that wall brother green used to tell us all the time from the scripture lord we just feel so so inspired by your spirit by your word and we thank you god today for lord for your blessings for all that you do for us lord for us here this little lord is the world we consider an insignificant little body of people lord but highly favored in you lord and i'm thankful god that song that mike is saying and blessed and highly favored in you god and that's what matters the most and we thank you father for these people thank you for those who may be streaming today lord we're just trusting and believing for your healing touch for every request as you've all already bought healing touch god for those who have had requests up before believing today god is a day of change today is a day of progression today is the day lord that you have made for us to rejoice and be glad in we thank you lord for this time for this place lord for your word god most of all for your spirit your word that spirit and truth that brings life to us god lead us guide us direct us use us for your glory and honor father we commit the remaining part of this service to you for your glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse 26 we'll read read verse 26 through the end of the chapter there amen genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every leaving living thing that moveth upon the earth and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me and to every beast of the field and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for me and it was so and god saw everything that he had made and they and behold it was very good the evening in the morning with the sixth day you could be seated if you'd like amen want to really reiterate and of course give you the title of the subject that the lord put on my heart i kind of gave it to you a few weeks ago but i want to talk about today and lord willing upcoming services on free will free will subject that came on my heart a little while back and you know we we often use the subject or we often use the verbiage that we are free moral agents we were put on free moral agency and that type of verbage but a lot of times as as brother branham used it and as we use it and talk about it it's talked about many times as kind of a foregone conclusion it's said or spoken as something that's uh uh that's common knowledge or something that uh you know we just all universally agree upon but within that free moral agency or that free will is uh is actually some contention there's actually some disagreement there's actually uh some um uh back and forth between which is right and which is not i mean this goes back of course uh we could go back to calvinism and armenianism uh which we'll talk about in a few minutes goes back way beyond that uh to reach into a person's free will brother brown tells us and uh i had this little quote here of course uh to validify that and and i just want to take a little bit of time to lay this foundation and and a lot of it will be things that we've probably spoken before it'll be things that we uh want to just lay that foundation to remember or to remind us of the things and of course how i believe brother branham taught it how the scripture teaches it about a person's free will uh brother brown tells us of course that we have our outward being when and is contacted by five senses see tasteful smell here we have the inner being the spirit which a lot of times gets neglected a lot of times we don't consider that or bring that into a a consideration of part of the things that's going on in our lives but it's conscient memory affection reason um and the fifth one which is eludes me but you know uh conscience affection reason memory imagination the five sense is the contact of spirit but of course sin in the soul the soul of man which of course in the man in the soul so as this as we know and identify as being a part of a human soul we can see that this is not in a in an animal um this is not a part of animal nature this is not a part of botany life this is a part of a human uh whom god put on free moral agency god wasn't so interested although he is proud of and loves and his nature the way it is and the animals and the plants and all those they always worship him they were put in the motion when god created them to do what they do amen right a lot of times people have been debating and of course you read about evolutionists and those that evolve and then and they get into the place well did which was first the chicken or the egg well you know i think we had that answer right because god created every living creature and put within that creature the ability to reproduce right that we just read the seed was in it to reproduce of itself whether it's a plant or an animal it was given that so that god set in motion and it was the way it is and it has been now not since the beginning of creation because man fell and when man fell all of creation fell but since then nature just continues to evolve the way it is the way it does when it gets cold you see the birds flying in big flocks nobody came and instructed them to do that nobody came and had some seminar or class on something to say well you know you have a choice this time you don't have to do that no they don't have a choice right i guess technically they do but they get in their groups and they leave because their choice of staying is dying because if they stay in the fridge and cold they're not going to live right so you understand that's just a simple part of understanding that the animals and body life just evolve and go about doing as god set them in motion thousands and thousands of years ago but humans have a soul and in that soul as brother branham teaches us in that soul is a man's free will that free will is something that is delegated and regulated only to a human not to animal life dr botany life right the human has the free will because it was the human in which god was wanting to now not that he didn't display attributes of who he is in body life and animal life but the evolved is i'll use that terminology evolves part of god's creation because you know he started with blocking life on the lower level then he increased that by coming into the animal life something that took breath and had a beating heart and then he evolved that up into the human being would actually has a soul so that top so as god's evolving of creation came about god then put in that man and god wanted the desire of the man to worship him see but god wanted that man to worship him based on his own free will based on his own desire based on his own love for god based on his own desires god wanted the human to have a desire to worship him god wanted the man to have to do it of his own free will so he put in that human a soul a determinate soul so that that soul would dictate to that human through the spirit into the body how that human would live and react and decisions we would make places we would go things we would do things we would say how we would act how we would live how we would or would not worship who and what or we would or would not worship god put in that soul that desire that that's why that anchor part of your being the soul is the part that god wants the most right that's the part that uh god that's why he placed that seed in there from the beginning first john that tells us that that seed was placed in there that was that part of god that was to be you from before the foundation of the world that's why god placed it where not in your body not in your spirit but in your soul that's why in ephesians it tells us that the soul is sealed with the holy spirit of promise until the day of your destination until you get to where god has you to go see until your eternal destination that soul is sealed is sealed with god in there because that's the determinate part of you and which way you go so now with that determinate part in you that controls that free will now that doesn't change your free will you still have free will even even when you were born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies you had free will after you become a born again christian filled with the holy ghost you still have free will god you can get mad in your emotions and your emotions can cause you to do something or make a decision you should not make but you still have the free will god could move a person a certain way or cause a heart to be hardened or something but you still have free will you can still decide to do it whichever way you want to do it or say it or what you still have that ability periods right you understand that free will is there it's always been there we'll always be there until we leave this place to have the free will of god now when god not to to substantiate that by scripture we just read this part that god said about the earth god said let us make man in our image and our likeness and have them that man have dominion that is to have complete control to have authority over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air the cattle of all the earth every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth the man is to have authority or dominion over so you know that dominion comes with responsibility the dominion that god gave us now you as we read on the rest of this it talks about how we have dominion it says we are to uh multiply or cleanse your earth subdue it amen that is to take it for your for your liking and man has done that now of course when adam lost this earth he lost it into the hands of satan and it became satan's eden and thus man's free will has done what is done to bring this earth to the place it's at today which is fit for destruction yes that's just the place it's at now is satan's e to be burned over purified is the place that it's it's gotten to today and it got to that place because of man's free will it didn't get to that place because god determined it it didn't get to that place because god caused it or god moved on somebody to make it that way no it came to be that way because of man's free will first of all it was in the hands of adam adam had control over it it was in his dominion it was in his control it was his authority but he had responsibility on that because this earth was created for christ for god and for his children it was we go back to colossians and read all that we see was created for him by him for his glory for his honor all of it was done for him adam lost in the garden of eden by his free will he chose to do what he did and he fell eve chose to do what she did she fell adam went after chose to do what he did he fell and when he fell all the creation fell this earth went into the hands of satan man still has control of dominion over it to subdue it but look what they do in subduing it now right yes they destroy it right you know brother branham said god the bible says god will destroy those that destroys the earth because this was god's creation but it wasn't done because god's determined from the beginning it was done because of man's free will man's chose to do what they've done man's chose to build bigger bombs and and and and better bullets and guns and uh they they chose to hate one another and they they chose to despise and kill one another since cain and abel kane had a choice to do what he did god gave him a choice god said if you'll do well i'll accept you but if you sin if you go that way sin lieth at the door right so he had that choice that was given to cain right there both men had a choice of whether they were going to offer a sacrifice and what sacrifice they were going to offer that was their choice and then when when god came to king he says you could go this way or you can go this way knowing he was the son of the serpent and knowing the nature that was in him god still gave him a choice god still gave him a space to repent but he would not repent every human ever born has the choice the decision to repent if they desire to do so now it's this this is going to take us into of course uh god's for knowledge and election and predestination and sometimes we get those terms intermingled but i want us to understand today there's a there's a separate and distinct difference between foreknowledge and election and predestination election and predestination are not the same right foreknowledge leads to election or to be chosen which the bible says elected or chosen two different words in and and god's election or choosing leads to his predestination so god knew so let's just do this for a second i wish i had my board but anyway we start with four knowledge we have to start with the the with the infinity of god god knew all things from the beginning now that's still hard for me to grasp not that i don't believe it right i absolutely do believe it but to believe or know not believe just i know right to know that there is a being that of course greater than us a being that knows everything that's going to happen through time everything brother adam said he knew every every flea every fly he said every gnat that would ever be on the earth god knew it and he said how and every now and how much tallow each net would produce now friend that that still boggles my little human pee brain i just can't comprehend that i believe it right i know it's the truth he's proved it over and over again of course and by faith in myself but to understand it as a human i don't understand that right i don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes and honestly i don't want to know oh well unless it's something god thinks i need to know when he reveals it to me or gives a vision or something that's a little different but just to know the next minute or the next hour next day i don't want to know i just want to live my life living through the glory of god the best of my ability see but uh you think you worry now you think you worry and fret and under stress now just think if you knew what was coming down the road exactly fret and strut uh worried about every little thing but it's i don't want to know but god knows he knows all that so for him to have the foreknowledge to know as much as every gnat that would ever exist on this planet and how much tala each net would produce down to that very infinite uh uh amount what do you believe in your heart he knows about you right exactly yes and what he knows about us in our lives our great testimonies that we've had today friend have been just outstanding touched my heart so much i i'm sorry i think i scared you but i i didn't clap god clapped that's that was just something that took over me i i i that wasn't purposely done that was just the next thing i know god's shouting and that's i'm just praising the lord but see god knows all those things i don't we don't know that god knows it so that's his foreknowledge so first we have to understand and accept the fact that god foreknew everything so if he ford knew everything he knew there would be people in the bars this morning he knew there would be people worshiping their televisions in a sporting event and he knew that you would be sitting here worshiping god and listening to his word he knew that so he knew that so because he knew that you would accept and that you would receive and by your determinate decision as a free moral person by your free will that you would accept him you would believe him and you would receive him and live for him he put within you the ability to do it based on his spirit yes he knew that thus he could choose you yes now now with from from from free will from foreknowledge excuse me from foreknowledge to election or choosing so based on that and based on that fact he chose you now you say that that is in just by god no it's not it's not unjust because god knew what you would do and what you would not do right now we'll get into some more of this later but uh not today but later on but when paul was struck down you know all the light that saul lived right and how he had stephen stoner stood there with the coat and consented to it anyway and how he lived and persecuted the christian and everything that that saul did and there on the road to damascus jesus spoke to him and he said who art thou lord because it was something to know that he knew enough about sitting at the feet of gamalia about what that pillar of cloud meant and who it was and he acknowledged it who are you lord i am jesus who you persecute but now when god goes to telling ananias to go to saul ananias says oh no lord not me him surely lord you jest you know what this man has done see us we're humans right raising with god do you know what he's done amen right of course he does he knew it millions of years ago he again i my mind just explodes when i get to those explicits but i just can't uh those adjectives is before time and it just it just goes beyond what a human could comprehend but yes he knew and god told ananias he is my chosen vessel amen he is my chosen vessel now i i believe by the grace of god that i am looking upon many of those who god has chosen exactly the same way he told ananias about saul right he is a chosen vessel you are a chosen vessel of god yes because god should choose you now after all the life that saul lived after everything he did after uh the murderous spirit and and the contention to god's children and all that he did that why would god make him a chosen vessel because remember the choosing was based on for knowledge amen god knew what he would do now that knowledge doesn't take away his free will he could choose not to when ananias came to saul he could have said oh no this is foolishness this is rubbish i don't care anything about this so get away from me i don't believe that this is the way i'm going this way i've been taught this is how i lived it's what my grandpa my great-grandpa my all my life and i've been a baptist and that's just the way i believe me i don't need anything else see god knew that god knew that saul would receive it that's what made him a chosen vessel right because god knew that he choose chose paul he took him out and chose him this he elected him this is this was his hand-picked election right by god but he did it not out of injustice to say well why didn't he do it to this guy over here right because by god's foreknowledge he knew this guy over here if he were to get struck down by that pillar he wouldn't want to have anything to do with it i've told you before that when i was driving well i do this all the time i i try to do this my entire life i i don't just and i'm not saying there's anything wrong with it i'm just just the way the lord has directed me in my life so i'm not saying anything wrong with it but i'm not someone who just arbitrarily does things i i try not you know there's been street preachers there's people i've seen even times uh that they'll be preaching on the corner and that's then there's nothing wrong that's wonderful and maybe the lord led them to do that and so that's great but unless god shows me or reveals to me or or or puts something on my heart to do something like that i just i don't i don't move in that direction i don't move like that not that i don't want to do something without saying well you know god's pushed me to do something no no but i like to feel that little unction you know brother adam when he talks about he's going overseas he says you know i can go overseas and i i can go almost anywhere and preach he had managers people that were lying places up in india and africa and wherever across the country overseas anywhere around the country around the world people would line them up he said but there's just something about knowing that you've got that little unction from the holy ghost that says this is where i want you to go and this is what i want you to do and this is where i want you to be there's something about knowing now when the devil comes and tries to face you down about that you can stand and say satan get away from me i'm here in the name of the lord jesus you have no authority here praise god then you know you got something friend yes just not something that just gets arbitrarily done god doesn't do anything arbitrarily or just by chance he doesn't do it just because he he's got a wild hair to do something he doesn't do something just to mess with people but you know some people i don't know if you ever heard people say oh god just messes with people you know or topsy-turvy that kind of thing twist you around or make you go this way that way you've heard the stories people say well how could god how could a loving god cause these starving people god didn't cause charming people people's free will has caused starving people people's free will has called this place caused this place to be where it is today not god right now so when god chose paul when god told ananias that paul is a chosen vessel that meant that god had already by his foreknowledge knew that paul saul would receive it believe it and live it he knew that god knew that saul didn't know that i didn't know when i was younger you probably didn't know that i'm sure you didn't but when it come across your path at least at the right place at the right time and god spoke to your heart god knew that that would be it he knew that by your free will you would choose it accept it and believe it and now you live it you knew that that's why he chose you people say he's always unjust no he's not it's like i was saying when uh uh well the story is i was trying to make the point i was trying to make when i was driving i don't do anything arbitrarily but if i felt led now i always i always trying and i do this with almost anybody especially people that i don't know but i always try to cultivate the conversation the word will come into a place where you can talk about the lord right in whatever way that is you feel by the spirit of god leading you to cultivate that conversation to a place that you could talk about god to that person and if you give a mention or something comes up or something like that if it's received then you just a little bit further right yeah now if it's rejected if you slam the door and it's you know don't cast my pearl before swine beautiful weather we've been having on which is always a pretty mostly good subject in tucson except in june july and august then it's just hot just the greatest three letters hot and so anyway but you can talk about somebody but then you just a little bit at a time and you talk to somebody a little bit and and you try to cultivate that conversation just to talk about the lord to try to see if there's something there and i had a great conversation uh well many times but this one time continues to come back to me that i brought a man from the airport up to oro valley it was later at night and we talked about the lord and i think he went to casus or one of those churches and uh and you know he was telling me about different things and all and i just try to bring him back to the word and but anyway people like to brag on their church i'd rather brag on jesus but people like to brag on their church and that's okay that's fine um but then i try to bring it back around to the lord and i dropped the man off and it started ringing my spirit uh or i started thinking why did why didn't i say something about brother branham why didn't i bring up the message why didn't i and immediately i told you this before i think i told you even when it happened just been two or three years ago immediately after i thought that it god dropped in my spirit and said he would not have received it anyway that's right so then i think well lord that's why you didn't put it on my heart to say when he was in the car right because that's the way that's how literal i take things in my relationship with the lord that's how literal it is to me i believe that if i was just supposed to speak that to him i could regret not doing something but then i always look and think lord and make sure i'm in tune enough with the lord that i'm listening of course that's paramount first and foremost that i'm listening that i missed an opportunity lord did i miss an opportunity and then god would come back at least in this partic particular example that's probably why i remember it so vividly is god came and in my spirit immediately said he would not have received it anyway and then i thought well lord i felt my i felt clear then i felt clean i didn't feel like i was dearly to my duty and then again then it came to me and said well that that's lord that's why you didn't give it to me to say when he was in the car because he would not have received it anyway that's god's poor foreknowledge i didn't know that but god did right and because god did and i'm leaving my life according to the moving of his spirit in my life right then he is the one doing the the work he's the one that's the one walking and talking and and living it he's living through us so if it doesn't get said then then in that case in in that scenario he didn't want it to be said so if he didn't want it to be said then then you can rest assured now that's that's walking and talking with the lord that's not just saying well i just didn't want to no it's because the lord is leading you to do something and if he led you not to or you didn't come up then he's well lord there must be a reason because there's a reason for everything obviously we know that for a person's free will but now when god's path crossed saul saul received it so i accepted it that's what made him a chosen vessel a chosen elected vessel of god now that choosing now leads to predestination where god then pre-determines who you're going to be what you're going to be when you're going to live who's going to be your parents what part of the world what language your upbringing everything about you gets pre-determined at that point because god's foreknowledge knowing you would receive it causes him to choose you and once he's choose you chose you then he pre-determines or predestinates the kind of person you're going to be amen you're going to be a preacher laity member are you going to go here are you are you going to be this to fulfill this purpose you know there's another chosen vessel that's going to be in the same city around the same time and i'm making things it's extremely elementary years things i i'm breaking this down to where newton can understand it uh so this this is dumbed down for newton's benefit uh and make it very elementary the word oh there's somebody else in that city at that time that i that's a chosen vessel but i need to get the word to them well brother john's gonna be there i'll send them over there and god predetermines predestinates you or just say in this example john to go to that person that might be the one major thing that god has predestined for john's law now obviously everything else that we do as we live for him of course is is the moving of god in our lives and many times there are more things in just that one but you understand there's a predestined plan for you yeah amen there's no plan in election uh let's just let let me dumb it down even further amen this is the the uh the dummy's guide to newton's thinking they used to some of those yellow books you know that says this is a computers for dummies uh that that's where i fall in so i have to bring it down to where it makes sense to me we just had an election this country whatever you believe elected joe biden or joe biden as president but his election didn't make him do what he does to rule the country that's something that was probably in the natural predetermined by him or in his thoughts or minds oh if i get in there i'm going to do this people come and say you know sir if you get in office you should do this and other people come and he gets people all around him that they're smart supposed to be smart all around him say do this for him and help him get to this place and say you know i know you were thinking of doing this but after investigating you know you'd be better and all that all those things that's why you saw on like the first day of his presidency he signed an executive order one after the other right right i mean he said a record of of executive order just do this this and this and this this this because that was already predetermined right you understand i'm not i'm not trying to belittle the president or any of that i'm just saying i'm trying to get to the point to understand the election did not do that him being chosen did not do that the predetermined the predestination come from what it was in his mind before it got to that place right and who you were to be and what purpose you were to serve and who you were to become on this earth as a son or daughter of god is predetermined by god in his mind before you ever got here that's right amen but he had to do it based on his foreknowledge right and his choosing right amen none of that now i've got to make this loud and clear friend and i'm going to let you know what i've seen in the message what i've seen in the word and what your pastor believes and because there's other people that would disagree with me and i know people in this message that would disagree with me but to me that for knowledge coming to that choosing brings that predestination is where god that that uh brings you into play but has absolutely nothing to do with your free will right nothing to do with your free will you still have you said well i would have come to it anyway that is true why would you have come to it not because i said so right but because god already knew that you would god already knew what you would you say well my decision doesn't bear uh bear any merit yes it does you still can do what you want to do you still can decide what you want to want to do how you want to live it's god has predetermined yes but you still have a choice let's just say you woke up one morning and you just didn't feel very good and that was the day that god had you go to speak to so and so that you were supposed to be at the market or you were supposed to be somewhere where you're going to meet this person and lead them to the lord jesus because they're a chosen vessel and god's going to use you and you say yeah i don't think i'll go i'll just stay at home today it doesn't really matter anyway i can get that milk tomorrow or i can i i i can see this you might miss the very point that god wants you to do right you can still choose not to go you can even feel the action of the lord to do something and you say you know i just i just don't feel up to it i just don't feel i just don't feel good today or whatever it's your decision it's your choice you can do whatever you want to do brother branham talked about one of the greatest choices especially for a man and sometimes i wish i knew this and sometimes i'm glad i didn't know it when when uh my wife crossed my path uh but we weren't either serving the lord then anyway but was but but one of the greatest choices of man choosing a wife i mean that was one the last a messages brother ran a priest was the choosing of a bride he you listen to that his his determinate faction of that message is a person's free will yeah yeah is a man's choice decision now of course it falls on the woman too i don't mean to say that you know the message was the choosing of a bride not a husband and listen folks god made a man and he made a woman right anything outside of that is perverted right i'll leave that alone but that choice is what god put in a person that free will to decide right what they're going to do which way they're going to go who they want to choose he talks about so well this is a pretty girl i'll i'll take her because she's pretty oh this one cooks good sod she might not be much on the looks but man i'll be fat in 20 years whatever the determinate factor is they decide but that's by their free will they can choose not to a lot of people today they'll choose based on frivolous uh uh attributes in an individual and five years less than five years later they're divorced right and they do the same thing with the next one yeah and then they're divorced and they do the same thing with the next one and then they're divorced why the determining factor should outside of them will forget about the world the determinate factor should be in should based in god and the moving of the spirit in the word in the word that's why the bible says don't be unequally yoked it's in the word that's the determinate factor that that determines or breaks down a person's free will now there are people that i know in this message that no nobody here that just basically to believe and again i'm dumbing this down but basically believe that they're gonna sit in their chair and when god's ready to save them he's going to come and elevate them out of their chair bring them over to an altar somewhere in the kneeling prostrate condition and force them to give their heart to him because hey it's predetermined well then where's the man's free will right now you've got calvinism versus armenianism again and calvinism believes so much in predestination he didn't believe there was any free will and there's plenty of people in this message that believe that that believe well everything's predetermined anyway so what's the point well the point is that you're a free world agency and your decision determines which way you'll go god just happened to do that before the foundation of the world i don't you don't he does that's how he chose but that predetermined factor now lies in us what am i going to do what decision am i going to make which way am i going to go with it i'm not going to just sit here and just wait for god to come scoop me up and throw me at an altar somewhere right i got to make a decision to do something i've got to make a decision to make a move for the lord even if i don't understand it maybe if i don't even agree with it i gotta make that move i gotta put myself in that position so that god can do something amen god's not gonna force you to do anything yes god struck down saul god blinded saul god sent ananias to saul but saul still had a choice he still could decide each other the way he wanted to go right he had because that's our choice see what does it mean to god and this would be an unjust god if he forced you or made you to do something let's just say god's gonna force this side of the room to serve him and this side of the room he's not he don't care about you at all well that is an unjust god and that's the way a lot of people picture or plant or or paint the picture in your mind of who god is right how could god do this how could god allow this it's not god it's your decision it's your choice god gave you look in the beginning god gave the man the choice yes god gave the man the decision the decision-making ability because god wants you to serve him of your own free will right that's right he wants you to serve him because you love him not because of anything he's done for you not because of anything he's done for your family or church not because he's uh blessed you so much you know when all those things run out you get in those dry places then what have you got right yeah right you got a god that you're gonna keep serving well he's done anything for you lately as you know the saying goes what have you done for me lately [Music] so what then becomes your determining factor for your choice amen what's your determining factor what's your determining factors for getting up every morning maybe some people don't i don't know what's your determining factor for going to work what's your determining factor for uh the the meal you eat what was your determining factor from coming to church today great amen amen i'll tell you i came here because i wanted to yes ma'am i came here and i didn't know who else was coming right i assumed and believed unless you know sometimes people say that they're not doing well like brother dennis brother and sister pat and and danny and i you know i hear those things but i don't know i didn't come here because you i didn't even necessarily come here for you i came here because of the lord jesus i came here because i wanted to come here i came here hoping and believing i would see you and i enjoy that very much but i don't know but that's not my reason that's not my purpose i'm assuming you didn't come to hear me i'm assuming you didn't come to see one another hear some special song or or feel some tingling down your spine you come because you love the lord you came because you love the lord jesus and his word declares forsake not to sin to govern yourselves together even that much more as we see and we do see that the approach that's right amen but you just did it because of out of your heart because you love the lord yes and that's just the bottom line what god who's there other than you or what god does from that point that's not up to you right but the results are so beautiful aren't they and that desire just grows greater and greater amen that desire just gets greater and greater and see that that becomes a determinate factor in your life because that's your it's your choice that's your free will you didn't come here this morning because god made you come here you come here because you wanted to come here and that's been the exact same thing from the beginning of time from adam and eve and the garden of eden had dominion over everything in this earth now people want to blame everything on god but everything is not god's fault in fact nothing's his fault everything's man's fault from the beginning god made the perfect place he made the perfect being and he put him in the uh perfect state to be in yes everything from there was man's decision right everything amen everything from there was god's decision god doesn't make you do anything now there are some things that just spirit just hit me so i don't know if anybody out there is thinking this but they're i'm going to get into some of this a little later too not today uh yeah well what in the bible god hardened so-and-so's heart uh god this lying spirit and and these things happen in the bible you gotta understand god those things be determined does not change a person's free will right sometimes god will test you to see what decision you're going to make right he'll test you to find out what your free will determinate purpose is going to be he does that on purpose that not only does he of course knows who you are but let you know well is there a shortfall here in my life yeah is there something i'm not doing is there someplace i'm not reaching to is there some cuz honestly friend and you know as well as i do in church of course everything looks rosy and glowing and every family's the perfect family that sits on the pedestal you know but when you get in the four corners of your house right a lot of times it's a little different story right and most of the time other people don't understand that right but we do because we live it and god does because of course you do it before the foundation of the world so where does the determinate factor come from your free will what is your choice what is your desire see what what is what drives a person i i got to post here in a minute i haven't read any of this but what what drives the person there there's there's a motive behind everybody's choice behind every choice you make there's there's an end result determining what you choose to do there's a motive in you there's a maybe that's a good place to stop this too there's a motive in you that drives you to make your choice yeah because you believe that the choice you make is going to end up with this positive result whatever it is now sometimes we make choices that uh we just don't even think about it things that usually get us in trouble probably things we probably shouldn't do you don't think about things you're not supposed to do because you know what the result is going to be and you don't want to think about it because you want to make that decision that choice regardless and people do that they make decisions and choices regardless of what those consequences might be they do it anyway but there's still a motive there's still something that's in that person that that's determining what they're going to do what is uh the motivating factor behind our free will choices what is that motivating factor what is motivating you to think that way what is motivating you to make that decision what is motivating you to operate yourself in this way or or over this way or something there's always something behind it amen and you got to understand of course every single single single solitary move you try to make for the lord jesus there's going to be a devil there to try to keep you from it and try to sway you from it that's right amen i want to be sweet and kind to my wife or my husband today or i want to be the best mother father my children and whatever else and then the devil comes there and says and then next thing you know you're making a choice decision or something you probably should make but you got to understand that's the enemy yes amen that's the devil that's right if it's coming against what god is doing that's the devil yes that's the enemy so make sure that that motivating factor remember when brother branham talked or billy paul's testimony about his son when he came and kept interrupting them when they were writing letters together they were answering letters brother billy paul and brother branham and billy some would come up i forget which one it was and he would interrupt him and said no no you know go away two or three times i forgot what it was came up and interrupted him and like the last time billy paul took him in and swatted him on his diaper and skidd him across four a couple inches and the boy's screaming and crying and he's upset you know daddy whacked and probably didn't even feel anything because his diapers you know of course back then they weren't oh they were clothed i don't know anyway sent him across the floor anyway a couple inches he probably did feel it back then but the kid goes running away and crying and screaming and and billy paul's like okay daddy i think we'll be okay let's get back to work no he said i've got something to say to you amen and he says what's the matter he said you struck that boy he said you mean i disciplined him he said no you hit him in anger right yes when you hit that boy in anger you upset his angel and god is very displeased with this situation and with this atmosphere right now and you know if god was just pleased with it brother branham was displeased with it yeah right amen he said you struck that kid and that kid in anger that child and anger and you upset and angered that angel that protects that boy and that upset the lord and this atmosphere is not working amen right yeah now what do you think is determining decision factor of this decision is going to be from that point on right well motion takes over things happen amen the devil comes and tries to upset everything yeah but there's but but ultimately ultimately the end is with us it's our choice our decisions our free will it's our free will we have free will to decide everything that's gotten to the place it's gotten today in this world from the time that god created it was because of man's free will yeah still that way today i'm gonna go i'm gonna read this i'll close the god of this evil age as we talked about this but he said the outside man is physical being was controlled by five senses inside man is a spirit man controlled by five senses conscious love so forth the outside man see takes phil smell here but the inside of that spirit is a soul it's controlled by one thing and that's your free will amen that's why it matters so much well one big reason it matters so much you become that you get born again because in the determinate factor of your being is your soul is being influenced by god then you're going to have a godly result yes going through the spirit of course and through the flesh and that all gets muddied and muddled but the but the but the result is the point is that if god is in there that determinate factor in your being by your free will is god see because that free will is in your soul it is controlled by one thing your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept what god says you can now god knew the decision again for knowledge but you can still choose if it's the spirit of god it'll feel uh feed on the things of god and it won't feed on anything the world jesus said if you love the world thinks the world is because the love of god's not even entered in that inner part satan has deceived you and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that perceiveth out the mouth of god that determinate factor in each of us that free will our free will we always have a choice when people try to present this word present this message with the degree of uncertainty about your decision process they're in my opinion they are wrong the thing that puts us in that position is the fact that god already knows that we would have done that that we would be that that was our choice our decision he knew that we would do that amen that's why he chose you that's why he predetermined who you would be what you'd be but that doesn't take away my free will i can still decide to choose what i want to and not want to amen people screaming yeah i hear about the united states oh this is a free country and it's freer than most right it's uh best country in the world still in my opinion there's there's no freedom out here if it was out it's free there's nothing free outside of golf right period oh i'm i want to remain free you weren't free to begin with amen if you could sit down if we can sit down i'm getting late if we could sit down and actually examine how this we americans humans are funneled like cattle to go certain directions and think certain ways and feel certain things about about everything basically yeah i mean from from media to news to billboards to other people we get steered in in ways that we just don't even understand we just we don't even comprehend and a lot of people don't even recognize that they've been they have been manipulated to go a certain way or make a certain decision they've been they've been motivated to make a decision or or to exercise their free will and afraid in a way that's going to be purposeful to someone's in the agenda agenda their end result is just think about it sometimes how this how we as people are determined to move a certain way amen it's the things you eat places you go amen there's always those factors that are there it that that motivates and and drives us into certain little channels yeah amen that's why people go certain ways they go and and then of course that's why that's one reason this country's broke so dividedly into two parts mostly three parts if you ask me but we're the christians not a part of this world anyway so it's really just two the three part is the bride's getting ready to lead then they'll just be too hard and there's and they're so so divisive because the one has said oh that's just a horrible way i'll never go that way so they just go this way you know says oh that's a horrible way i'll never go that way so they just go this way and then they they chunnel down their little channels just like cattle being proud amen they don't realize uh they're exercising their free will for other people and entities amen let's stand if we could amen people get determined determinate by different things different purposes but i want my purpose and the determining factor of my life to be the holy spirit that's in there the the the seat of my free will be the holy spirit that that spirit moves me in whichever way he wants it to go because it's it's god who's chosen it that's what makes us the sheep right that we're not driven as the world does we just talked about but we're led amen we're led god leads us as free mortal agents this thing is little course 3 17. maybe next week i'll get past the first two lines of my nose uh 3 17. sometimes when something's been on your heart so long you uh you just speak what the lord gives so i'll say yes lord yes [Music] [Applause] and my answer will be yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] i will trust you [Music] [Music] yes praise the lord all saints how many times have you gotten in a place where you said oh god how did i ever get here trace it back fine because you made the wrong choice you made the wrong decision over here that wasn't the that wasn't the plan i had for you that wasn't the the road i had laid out for you you chose to go this way and it may have taken a while but at the end of that road was destruction he said lord how did i ever get here well you shouldn't have chose to do this amen but we still had a choice yeah yeah that's when we get in god's seat oh one more thing that's how people have a hard time even understanding god's permissive will and his perfect will right because when you're in his perfect will oh absolutely you think god that's the path that god's paid for me and i don't have free will i don't have choice so i just i just go like a robot down this road but then where does god's permissible come in his permissive will comes in when you've made a decision a choice by your free will that took you off that perfect will path amen praise the lord so thankful that we can still say yes lord amen we can still say yes the chosen vessel predestined by god amen and thankful to be one of his you're thankful to be one of his today amen you made that choice you made that decision yes sometimes against all odds sometimes against every one of your family members every one of your friends you may have made that determining decision based on absolutely nobody's support in your entire life anywhere and yet you decided god knew that amen i grew up in a christian home and i'm thankful for my godly parents who came in this message in the 70s and raised me in it and i thank god for that but a lot of people didn't a lot of people didn't have that but yet the decision the choice that you made yet with all odds we're against it for him amen that just prejudice proof shows amen that's god's god's way in your life and your choice you made that choice you made that decision amen and i'll go out on a limb here with all of you well i'll just say it for myself best choice decision i ever made amen was for him yeah amen best one i ever made no offense dear love you love my children with every ounce of fiber in my being amen but that's the best decision i've ever made amen i didn't make that decision there wouldn't be no hurt or them probably or you praise the lord aren't you thankful thank you jesus help us continue on from this day forward amen to make that just a little more a little a little tighter decision so we don't end up in his permissive will maybe yeah amen or at least not quite so much yeah god bless you appreciate you thank you so much for being here today nothing nothing new to report on the other building or another front so lord willing we'll be here again next week by the grace of god and if something else comes up i'll let you know or keep you informed if it's something very important i'll let you know before next sunday but if not we'll just uh keep you updated next sunday i haven't heard from him in a couple weeks but i'll probably try myself to reach out this week if i don't hear anything at least get an update so um we'll just by the grace of god amen to the prayers keep going by the grace of god i'm thankful he allows us to have this place and so far it looks like micah gets here for india it looks like nobody else is even getting it since we've been here nobody else has even before we was before we reserved this the guy was telling us they they reserved
