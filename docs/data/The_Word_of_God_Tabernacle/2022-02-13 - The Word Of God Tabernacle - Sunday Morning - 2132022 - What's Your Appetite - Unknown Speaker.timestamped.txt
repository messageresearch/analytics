[15:37] we know what the solution is we want

[15:41] ourselves
[15:42] praise the lord jesus
[15:44] amen that's what makes the difference we
[15:46] relinquish ourselves and our rights into
[15:48] his hands he can take it and use it amen
[15:52] praise the lord jesus we've got a few uh
[15:56] prayer requests here that we want to
[15:57] make mention to you today
[15:59] um
[16:01] thank you sister matisse for writing
[16:03] this as a praise so it's easier for me
[16:05] to recognize if it's a praise report if
[16:08] it says that on there
[16:09] um art and shri are on their way
[16:12] supposed to be the biosteros or running
[16:14] a little bit late today but sister
[16:16] shreya wanted me to put a prayer request
[16:18] in for art his shoulder effect still
[16:20] bothering him remember last week we had
[16:22] that prayer request for him so
[16:24] let's continue to remember him in prayer
[16:26] also micah put in a prayer request
[16:29] brother tom
[16:31] zanka of course uh that's still like
[16:33] today's the last day of the gym show so
[16:36] they'll be starting to wrap up
[16:38] probably not tonight maybe a little
[16:39] tonight but more tomorrow and so mike
[16:43] put in a prayer request that laura would
[16:45] just help him and the ones that are
[16:46] helping him next few days breaking down
[16:48] all the displays and handling the big
[16:50] heavy rock and machinery so we want to
[16:53] remember him in prayer in that situation
[16:55] also brother angel
[16:57] told me they would be streaming today
[16:58] god bless you family if you're
[17:01] there now trust you are that he put in a
[17:03] prayer request they uh streaming today
[17:06] because they have a little sickness in
[17:08] the family there in the home and they
[17:09] all you know in the same home and his
[17:11] mom and all
[17:13] uh had a little sickness there so they
[17:15] felt to stay home instead of coming and
[17:18] potentially spreading it but he had a
[17:20] prayer request if uh pray for healing of
[17:23] course for them
[17:24] granted the desires of their heart for a
[17:26] home of course brother angel says
[17:28] priscilla they want to try to move out
[17:30] of their mom's home again and
[17:32] get a home of their own which i would
[17:34] advise there's always a reason why the
[17:36] bible said to
[17:37] leave father and mother and cling to
[17:41] the family that's the way it's
[17:43] uh hopefully now sometimes it works out
[17:45] okay but a lot of times it doesn't
[17:47] um i know when we tried to live with my
[17:50] mother
[17:51] didn't work yeah even after my dad
[17:53] passed away
[17:54] uh it it didn't work
[17:57] just as much as my mom loved my uh my
[18:00] wife and my wife my mother and
[18:02] everything it just
[18:04] you know it just
[18:06] without going into detail it just
[18:08] doesn't work
[18:10] just didn't work so we moved out and
[18:12] everything was great but they want to
[18:14] have a new home and want to try to find
[18:16] a new home their finances close the wall
[18:18] to the lord remove all doubts fears
[18:21] unbelief let their epistle be rid of all
[18:23] men
[18:24] grace and mercy to god so remember that
[18:26] in prayer for them as well
[18:28] amen
[18:30] i did not see any prayer requests over
[18:32] there uh but if you have an unspoken one
[18:35] and let it be known by updating him so
[18:38] thank you have brother dennis for the
[18:39] danny back with us today battling that
[18:42] devil coveted
[18:44] amen but by the grace of god they didn't
[18:45] get it too heavy and of course you don't
[18:48] see my family or mine and sonia's
[18:50] tabitha and zach and the kids are home
[18:52] tabitha and joel tested positive this
[18:55] week for covet with the little home test
[18:58] thing
[18:59] they're both feeling fine the whole
[19:00] family zach had a few little symptoms
[19:03] too but they're all feeling fine they're
[19:04] doing good but they stayed home of
[19:06] course
[19:08] just to be safe so they're home today
[19:10] god bless you love my family too miss
[19:13] you joel and emma and
[19:15] my family but uh they're home there so
[19:17] let's pray for them too if you would
[19:19] remember them in prayer
[19:22] amen
[19:24] praise the lord
[19:26] let's stand on our feet then
[19:28] trying to think it seems like i always
[19:30] feel like a lot of times i'm up here and
[19:32] i forget certain requests or something
[19:33] and that's why i try to write them down
[19:35] and put them in my phone so that i know
[19:37] them sometimes i forget them if if there
[19:40] was one that i forgot then
[19:42] you can let me know uh or
[19:44] if you have one that i forgot you can
[19:46] raise your hand
[19:48] i always forget amen god knows though
[19:50] that's the most important thing so amen
[19:52] brother dennis would you take these
[19:54] things to the lord brother

[30:09] from brother danny
[30:10] amen thank the lord sister
[30:12] lydia sent me a praise report this week
[30:16] as you probably all know i'm sure she
[30:18] gave it to the sisters especially
[30:21] her blood work came back and
[30:22] everything's perfect
[30:24] amen everything's normal
[30:26] everything's right everything's good
[30:28] praise the lord so thank god for that
[30:30] she also
[30:31] gave a praise report about robert
[30:34] but i'm gonna let her give it because i
[30:36] i forgot exactly the details and i have
[30:38] to look it up on my phone anyway uh
[30:40] robert um
[30:48] had a issues with its intestines that's
[30:51] what it was
[30:53] and now uh they have given him some
[30:55] antibiotics for 10 days
[30:57] and then after the 10 days
[31:00] he will go back to the doctor and see if
[31:02] he is going to need more treatment
[31:05] but uh he was at my house yesterday
[31:08] and he looked really well
[31:10] he thanks everybody for your prayers
[31:13] and um we're just hoping that it's
[31:15] nothing in your house yes amen praise
[31:19] the lord
[31:20] amen so far so good and in case y'all
[31:23] were wondering um
[31:25] we don't necessarily although some need
[31:28] it but we don't necessarily pass the mic
[31:30] around
[31:31] because we can't hear one another but
[31:33] because of the camera
[31:35] uh sometimes when you speak it's just
[31:38] not quite loud enough
[31:41] to get to the camera mic so that it goes
[31:44] out to those streaming and those who
[31:45] might watch it in archives so if you're
[31:47] wondering and you don't like holding the
[31:49] mic or something it's it's really you
[31:51] might think well they can hear me it's
[31:53] really more
[31:55] uh for the camera and the streaming than
[31:58] anything else so that you know that
[32:00] mike has got a song for us she's also
[32:02] got a testimony and he wrote it down for
[32:04] me but i'm gonna go ahead and just let
[32:06] him give the testimony since he's seen
[32:07] anyway so go ahead mike
[32:11] um
[32:17] so i went to get my oil change thursday
[32:19] and
[32:22] i asked specific questions to make sure
[32:24] that they were doing what i knew needed
[32:26] to be done other than changing the water
[32:27] like topping off coolant and stuff like
[32:28] that but after i got done the coolant my
[32:31] coolant light kept coming on
[32:33] so this morning i was like i need to
[32:35] check it i checked it they didn't top it
[32:38] off but also the
[32:40] cap to the oil where you put it in the
[32:42] engine was not on
[32:45] so i freaked out a little bit and
[32:47] started panicking and i was looking
[32:48] around the engine and looking underneath
[32:50] to see if maybe it fell in the oil pan
[32:52] around
[32:54] and i i was like man and they're closed
[32:56] on sunday so i can't call them to see if
[32:58] they have it i could drive and see if
[33:00] autozone had it because i woke up early

[33:03] like okay calm down florida i need your
[33:05] help just find this

[33:11] of the
[33:12] engine casing

[33:16] of blended in

[41:14] morning

[41:19] i
[41:20] looked in the closet and kind of wore a
[41:23] different
[41:24] i guess uh
[41:25] color combo than i really ever wear and
[41:27] i got here and i think i looked like the
[41:28] carpet
[41:29] because i got the
[41:31] revelation of the carpet this morning
[41:34] i looked and i thought wow it's pretty
[41:36] close

[43:17] given us to come to this morning and

[43:21] to us and have your way in each and
[43:23] every one of our lives so god just let
[43:26] this word come forth in power and
[43:28] manifestation of your spirit and let it
[43:31] not return void but accomplish that that
[43:33] you send it forth for and bring us more
[43:36] into your image and likeness by it we
[43:38] commit it to you and ask your uh uh
[43:41] your hand of mercy to be upon it upon us
[43:44] lord to anoint the hearing speaker as we
[43:46] commit this remaining part of the
[43:48] service into your hands
[43:50] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[43:52] pray amen amen
[43:55] luke 12 32
[43:58] 32-34 let you be seated fear not little
[44:00] flock
[44:01] what is your father's good pleasure to
[44:04] give you the kingdom
[44:06] sell that ye have and give alms provide
[44:08] yourselves bags which wax not old a
[44:11] treasure in heaven
[44:13] in the heavens that faileth not where no
[44:16] thief approacheth nor moth corrupt
[44:19] for where your treasure is there will
[44:21] your heart be also
[44:23] you can be seated if you'd like
[44:26] amen i guess that's quite a
[44:30] scripture for today
[44:33] when we see and acknowledge and
[44:35] recognize around the
[44:37] country around the world the great
[44:39] thefts that are taking place all over
[44:41] the place brazen thefts thefts that just
[44:45] you know divide defy logic defy any
[44:48] thought
[44:48] of things it's almost a weekly
[44:50] occurrence anymore that i look and see
[44:52] things that's going on and you know it
[44:54] could discourage you if you're not a
[44:55] christian if you don't know better and
[44:56] you don't know where you're going and
[44:58] what the lord's doing in our lives
[45:00] it can be quite discouraging but when
[45:02] you recognize the lord's hands on it all
[45:04] and he's taking care of it but every
[45:06] week is like something that i look at
[45:08] and see and i think mine when i was a
[45:09] child this would have never happened
[45:12] when i was growing up you would have
[45:14] never seen this
[45:15] when i was in school this would have
[45:17] never happened and it seems like a
[45:19] weekly occurrence anymore that i'm
[45:21] saying that about things that are
[45:22] unfolding just in our country
[45:25] but
[45:26] it comes to help us recognize that so
[45:28] many of those things that we're still
[45:31] living in satan's eden but god's
[45:32] protection is around us
[45:34] god still takes care of us and blesses
[45:37] us and watches over us but my thought
[45:39] this morning is going to be on the
[45:40] actual 34th verse which where you are uh
[45:43] where for where your treasure is there
[45:46] will your heart be also where your
[45:48] treasure is there your heart be also
[45:51] i want to speak on a little subject of
[45:53] what is your appetite
[45:55] what are you
[45:57] desiring
[45:58] what is it that you want amen because
[46:01] everybody does everybody has things that
[46:04] goes on in their mind and then their
[46:05] spirit everybody has things that goes on
[46:07] in their soul and those things that are
[46:09] in life that we do we do to satisfy
[46:12] those appetites uh we
[46:15] are supposed i guess the sisters and the
[46:18] brothers too i guess we're gonna go have
[46:20] some to eat after church here today and
[46:22] you know it's to satisfy a certain
[46:23] appetite uh a physical appetite is
[46:26] something that our brains are telling us
[46:28] that control tower god put in us that we
[46:30] have to go eat or we're going to die
[46:32] well you know the same thing is
[46:34] in our soul the same thing with our
[46:36] spirit body the spirit man there's
[46:39] something that has to that he has to
[46:41] have or he's going to die spiritually so
[46:44] the question then becomes what's feeding
[46:46] you what is your appetite what are you
[46:48] wanting
[46:49] uh
[46:50] what is it you're looking for because
[46:52] the bible jesus said here where your
[46:53] treasure is there's where your heart's
[46:55] gonna be you know a treasure is
[46:57] something that somebody lays up or
[46:59] stores up a treasure is something like
[47:02] uh uh you know would be maybe in the old
[47:05] pirate days in a treasure chest with
[47:07] gold coins today their bank accounts or
[47:11] uh iras or something like that they're
[47:14] treasures there's things that we
[47:15] consider valuable or we have a safe at
[47:17] home
[47:18] with uh valuables or guns in it or
[47:21] memorabilia or something from our lives
[47:23] from our kids and you know those are
[47:25] treasures that we store up it's things
[47:27] that we consider important
[47:30] you know it wouldn't be a treasure uh it
[47:33] would be a treasure to you
[47:35] if it wasn't something that was that was
[47:37] the desire of your heart i think that's
[47:39] what jesus is saying here because it's
[47:42] the desire of your heart that's what
[47:44] makes it a treasure because where your
[47:47] treasure is that's where your heart's
[47:49] going to be well the treasure is there
[47:51] because that's what your heart is
[47:53] desiring that's where your appetite is
[47:55] that's what you're thinking now in the
[47:57] natural we think about things we have
[48:00] storage my wife keeps telling us we need
[48:01] to get rid of the storage so all that
[48:03] stuff away but a lot of that stuff we
[48:05] have in that storage are things that our
[48:06] kids and uh
[48:08] from years ago and things that were
[48:10] important to us and
[48:11] i have little things that i say that she
[48:14] might not know that i have left over
[48:16] from high school when we were dating
[48:18] stuff like that those are physical uh
[48:21] desires physical appetite of things that
[48:23] we consider a treasure it's a treasure
[48:25] to me
[48:26] somebody would come along if i uh if i
[48:29] neglected to pay the bill on the storage
[48:31] unit and some storage wars were coming
[48:33] along and they bought it they'd take
[48:34] this stuff and they thought the fastest
[48:37] quickest closest dumpster they could
[48:38] find
[48:39] but to me it's a treasure
[48:42] to me it's important to me it's a it's a
[48:45] memory she said you never look at that
[48:47] stuff again don't matter i know it's
[48:48] there
[48:49] am i i know it's there so it's important
[48:51] to me it's a treasure to me is it a
[48:54] treasure to you what is your treasure
[48:55] see and that's just something physical
[48:58] of course
[48:59] ministering church or majoring on the
[49:02] spiritual aspect of it and where that
[49:04] treasure is and what that storing up is
[49:08] because that's what's going to tell uh
[49:10] dictate in your heart what what what is
[49:13] in your heart
[49:14] what is in your heart is going to be
[49:15] what's valuable to you
[49:17] it's going to be what you feed on and
[49:19] where your appetite is
[49:21] that your treasure is going to be uh
[49:24] that is going to be a reflection of
[49:27] where your heart is your treasure what
[49:29] you've stored up what you felt important
[49:32] to you spiritually is what you're
[49:35] storing up it's where your heart is
[49:37] it's what's controlling you it's that
[49:40] control tower of god see because we had
[49:42] a control tower in our in the spirit
[49:44] being we had a control tower when we
[49:47] were sinners when we were lost in
[49:49] sinners and lived in the world and
[49:51] weren't born again and just lived off
[49:53] the desires of our old nature that's
[49:55] what we stored up that's what we felt
[49:57] was important that's where our heart was
[49:59] so that's what we fed on but when you
[50:01] become born again then you start feeding
[50:04] on something different you start feeding
[50:06] on things that are more important to you
[50:08] your appetite changes
[50:11] yes that's the see the bottom line of
[50:13] the service today your appetite changes
[50:16] it changes from the things of the world
[50:18] to the things of god it changes for the
[50:21] things of satan to the things of the
[50:23] lord and when it does then everything
[50:25] about that because you have a heart
[50:28] change you have a soul change when that
[50:30] nature changes then everything that
[50:33] comes with that changes as well your
[50:36] appetite changes what you consider
[50:38] important changes what you store up as a
[50:41] treasure changes all those things are
[50:43] different than what they used to be
[50:46] spiritually because you now are a
[50:48] different person you're not the same
[50:50] person you were then you are a new
[50:53] creature in christ jesus so the appetite
[50:56] that that you portray
[50:58] is what's in your heart right it's what
[51:00] you want to it's what you want to feed
[51:02] and
[51:03] the reason i want to nail that down is
[51:06] the fact that that that will show to you
[51:10] not in church
[51:13] not around other church members or when
[51:15] you're trying to be all good and nice
[51:18] and and we're trying to put forth a
[51:20] facade of some kind
[51:22] but you know if your heart is changed
[51:24] and you're a new person you don't have
[51:27] to put up a facade
[51:28] you don't have to be pretentious you
[51:31] just be who you are because who you are
[51:34] is manifesting from your heart is
[51:36] showing that now it's of god and my
[51:38] appetite is for god not of the world
[51:41] so it's a it's a great barometer
[51:45] it's a great uh uh
[51:48] type host i guess you'd say or or
[51:50] measure
[51:51] that you can know
[51:53] what kind of
[51:55] heart you have now
[51:57] what appetite you have because that's
[52:00] gonna prove what's in your heart
[52:02] when you get outside of church
[52:04] when you're at work or when you're alone
[52:08] what is your appetite what are you
[52:10] wanting to feed on
[52:12] what what are you wanting your soul what
[52:14] do you want in your spirit body to feed
[52:17] on that that time
[52:18] because what you're wanting to feed on
[52:20] at that time is proof of what's in your
[52:22] heart
[52:24] where you're at
[52:25] whether you're saved or not whether
[52:26] you're born again or not that'll dictate
[52:29] to it because that's the number one
[52:31] barometer that tells you because what
[52:34] you desire
[52:35] is what's in your heart right
[52:38] what you if you desire to eat that just
[52:40] shows that there's something that that
[52:42] that's that's missing
[52:44] and
[52:45] in the simplistic form of it food is
[52:48] missing
[52:49] and as food is missing you get hungry
[52:52] if water is missing you get thirsty
[52:56] that just shows that that that what is
[52:58] controlling you in here that's naturally
[53:01] again
[53:02] so spiritually it proves to you
[53:05] what spirit you are of what nature you
[53:08] are of
[53:09] depending on what you're desiring to
[53:12] feed off of
[53:13] amen
[53:14] now
[53:15] i'm not saying we're monks and then
[53:18] every single waking moment that you're
[53:20] uh
[53:21] that you're in a prostate position or
[53:23] something we all have lives and we all
[53:25] do things and
[53:26] uh and things of our lives to enjoy our
[53:29] lives and things like that but that's
[53:31] not what we're talking about we're
[53:33] talking about the fundamental foundation
[53:35] of the of the
[53:38] the desire that's in your heart the
[53:40] appetite that you have because what
[53:43] treasures your your your
[53:45] uh building up is proving what's there
[53:48] amen so we understand that's what's
[53:51] showing it what's there
[53:53] um
[53:55] what's important to you
[53:57] amen uh
[53:59] like i said about the storage unit
[54:02] you i guess you've heard the old saying
[54:03] a one man's junk to another man's
[54:05] treasure
[54:06] uh
[54:07] there's people in the world today that
[54:09] are making a boatload of money because
[54:11] they're taking some piece of junk
[54:13] somebody sold for a dollar to yard sale
[54:15] and they're because they know the value
[54:17] of it
[54:18] and they're taking and putting it on
[54:19] ebay or online somewhere and they're
[54:21] selling it for 100 000
[54:23] hundred dollars or a thousand dollars or
[54:25] five thousand whatever they can get for
[54:26] it sometimes somebody buys an old
[54:29] painting or something they think is
[54:30] worthless well it was hung at my
[54:32] great-grandma's house and you know she
[54:34] died and it was getting rid of it they
[54:36] said oh you want it and i said no not
[54:37] really well take it because of some
[54:39] memorabilia and the next first yard sale
[54:42] they get they sell it for five bucks and
[54:43] somebody takes it who knows what they're
[54:45] doing and they take that painting and
[54:47] say now that painting's worth ten
[54:49] thousand dollars
[54:50] they'll buy for five bucks and sell it
[54:52] for ten grand
[54:53] amen one man's junction another man's
[54:55] treasure but what is the treasure to us
[54:58] what's important to us let's go over to
[55:00] matthew
[55:01] and uh read a scripture here to continue
[55:03] with matthew five
[55:10] matthew 5
[55:11] 1
[55:12] beginning of the beatitude sermon on the
[55:14] mount
[55:18] matthew chapter five verse one
[55:25] and seeing the multitudes
[55:27] he went up into a mountain and when he
[55:29] was set his disciple set his disciples
[55:32] came unto him
[55:34] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[55:36] saying
[55:38] blessed are the poor in spirit
[55:40] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[55:44] blessed are they that mourn for they
[55:46] shall be comforted you know shall is the
[55:49] most positive word in the english
[55:50] language
[55:52] shall
[55:53] they shall be comforted
[55:56] blessed are the meek for they shall
[55:58] inherit the earth now this goes against
[56:01] everything that the world does today
[56:02] right yeah if you notice if you go and
[56:04] you read through this you recognize that
[56:06] every attribute that god's listing here
[56:09] it really
[56:10] goes completely con the world's going
[56:12] completely contrary to that today
[56:15] sixth verse now blessed are they which
[56:18] do hunger and thirst after righteousness
[56:21] for they shall be filled
[56:23] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[56:26] after righteousness
[56:28] what is that appetite that appetite is
[56:31] from someone who is hungering and
[56:34] thirsting for righteousness now what is
[56:37] righteousness
[56:39] christ amen jesus christ is righteous
[56:43] the deeds he did are righteousness
[56:46] he is a righteous god and the only one
[56:50] that is righteous is him
[56:52] and if you thirst and hunger after
[56:55] christ then you can receive that
[56:58] righteousness that he is of because you
[57:01] receive him
[57:02] when you receive him you receive every
[57:05] attribute of him and everything that
[57:08] comes along with that fullness of the
[57:10] godhead bodily comes into you
[57:13] christ is that manifestation of it that
[57:16] that reveals itself to you
[57:19] you hunger and thirst now someone can
[57:22] say well i'm born again well that's
[57:24] wonderful i'm glad i'm filled with god's
[57:26] spirit born again got the holy ghost got
[57:29] the token going in that rapture praise
[57:31] the lord what is your thirst what are
[57:33] you hungry for
[57:35] what is your appetite because if you're
[57:37] hungry and thirsting after righteousness
[57:40] after christ you will be filled amen you
[57:43] will be yeah and that righteousness will
[57:45] become your righteousness you sell
[57:48] righteous automatically god takes care
[57:50] of that by his spirit but you grow in
[57:52] the grace of god the grace and the
[57:54] knowledge of the lord jesus as we
[57:56] continue to uh look and and
[57:59] and act and and present ourselves more
[58:02] christ-like it's like i said last week
[58:06] i don't even think you should be allowed
[58:07] to call yourself a christian unless
[58:09] you've been born again yes and then
[58:11] brother adam said a man shouldn't be
[58:13] ministering the gospel unless he's come
[58:15] face to face with that pillar of fire
[58:18] now he's not talking about a literal
[58:19] pillar of fire but he's talking about
[58:21] the spirit christ in the man
[58:24] i don't believe even a person can call
[58:26] themselves a christian because to be a
[58:27] christian is to be christ-like
[58:30] to be christ-like is manifesting his
[58:33] righteousness
[58:35] to manifest that righteousness proves
[58:38] what appetite you have because that's
[58:41] what your treasure is
[58:43] that's what you desire for that's what
[58:45] you long for
[58:47] is that is that appetite that only he
[58:50] can fill yeah everybody goes to
[58:52] everything else now of course satan will
[58:54] do everything he can to pervert that
[58:55] appetite and to try to get it to uh
[58:59] uh dumbed down or watered down or in
[59:01] some way give some sort of substitute
[59:04] uh try to bring discouragement or
[59:06] distraction or something and of course
[59:08] we know this world is full of
[59:09] distractions and satan does everything
[59:11] you can to try to keep it distracted and
[59:14] pervert that thirst but there's only one
[59:17] if there's a true hunger a true thirst
[59:19] for that righteousness there's only one
[59:22] way that righteousness can be filled
[59:24] and that's by christ yes he's the only
[59:26] one that can do it he's the only one
[59:28] that can fill it it's the only place you
[59:30] can get it you can go to your uh
[59:33] neighbor you can go to the church you
[59:35] can go to your pastor you can go
[59:36] wherever but there's only one that can
[59:39] do that
[59:40] only one that can fulfill that hunger
[59:42] and thirst in your soul and that's jesus
[59:44] christ yes only place you can get it
[59:46] people say well
[59:48] if the prophet we're only here no you
[59:50] know you won't go get it from him
[59:52] if he were still here you couldn't get
[59:54] it from him he didn't give it to anybody
[59:56] only jesus christ could give it amen he
[59:59] is that righteousness
[1:00:01] we are robed in his righteousness that's
[1:00:03] what makes us righteous
[1:00:05] amen righteousness taking on the
[1:00:08] righteousness of jesus christ because of
[1:00:10] the hunger the thirst that we have in
[1:00:12] our lives
[1:00:13] if that hunger and thirst is in there
[1:00:15] then that righteousness is going to be
[1:00:17] there it's going to be the stored up
[1:00:19] treasure that our heart longs for every
[1:00:22] day that our heart desires for every day
[1:00:26] it's long friend as long as we're in
[1:00:28] this past house as long as we're in this
[1:00:32] uh this body of flesh we're going to
[1:00:35] always desire more of god right
[1:00:39] if we're born of god
[1:00:41] and our soul
[1:00:43] is filled with his spirit
[1:00:46] there's always going to be that hunger
[1:00:48] for him yes
[1:00:50] every day
[1:00:52] every moment
[1:00:53] even in the depths if we're working our
[1:00:55] job or or if we're uh just
[1:00:58] doing something in our normal everyday
[1:01:00] lives whatever it is it's always going
[1:01:03] to be that hunger for him
[1:01:06] a lot of times
[1:01:07] uh things will happen that
[1:01:10] to me
[1:01:11] how the lord speaks sometimes
[1:01:14] is doing something that i would maybe
[1:01:16] normally do
[1:01:18] on a daily basis a daily basis
[1:01:22] and something specific will happen but
[1:01:24] because
[1:01:26] your mind your appetite your desire is
[1:01:29] in a certain place and it's there all
[1:01:32] the time even if you're not conscious of
[1:01:34] it right
[1:01:36] that when that thing that god whatever
[1:01:38] reason god made jews a specific time you
[1:01:40] know you know like he deals with that
[1:01:43] specific time in that specific way or
[1:01:45] that specific person to bring something
[1:01:48] to enlighten you
[1:01:52] if it wasn't there
[1:01:54] you would just go right over it
[1:01:56] i sometimes would probably miss it
[1:01:58] anyway probably miss god uh
[1:02:01] even job said he passes by me and i
[1:02:04] don't even recognize it but
[1:02:06] most of the time i would say
[1:02:08] that because that is there because that
[1:02:11] appetite because of that desire is there
[1:02:14] when that when an instance comes along
[1:02:17] and god just reveals himself that much
[1:02:20] more to you and and opens up more of
[1:02:22] himself to you which he continues to do
[1:02:25] yes amen
[1:02:26] god continues to brother adam said god
[1:02:28] will be unfolding himself to us through
[1:02:30] eternity right amen so if he does that
[1:02:34] every day it shows
[1:02:36] there's something there
[1:02:38] that that acute spirit that is that it
[1:02:41] that is cognizant of god
[1:02:44] and is desiring to have something from
[1:02:47] him any moment anytime whenever god
[1:02:50] wants to show it reveal it to me
[1:02:52] whenever god wants to let me know
[1:02:54] whatever sometimes
[1:02:56] god is coming certain ways at certain
[1:02:58] times of things i've had on the shelf
[1:03:00] that i didn't understand for months or
[1:03:02] years god will reveal to him and and
[1:03:05] drop it right there say i didn't know i
[1:03:07] i hadn't seen that right right
[1:03:09] and then and it cinches it all up right
[1:03:11] there
[1:03:12] that just shows see that's in the middle
[1:03:15] of everything that goes on in life
[1:03:18] because that desire is there
[1:03:20] because that heart and that that
[1:03:23] appetite is there
[1:03:25] as soon as it comes across
[1:03:28] you catch
[1:03:29] because god knows that that that's in
[1:03:32] your heart
[1:03:34] and your heart's desiring that
[1:03:36] and god might come and bring and drop it
[1:03:39] right there
[1:03:40] and you say praise the lord that's
[1:03:42] exactly it i was listening uh monday uh
[1:03:45] we worked in benson me and brother roger
[1:03:47] i was going down uh the interstate and
[1:03:49] listening to a message and
[1:03:52] and uh brother branham said something
[1:03:54] and friend i tell you i i probably got
[1:03:58] to believe and i've quoted this but i've
[1:04:00] probably got to believe i've heard this
[1:04:02] multiple times i won't even begin to say
[1:04:05] how many multiple times i'm sure i've
[1:04:07] heard this i know i've heard this
[1:04:08] message very
[1:04:09] that that really speak to me that
[1:04:12] brother branham says but when i was
[1:04:14] going to he he said this one specific
[1:04:17] thing
[1:04:18] and for some reason well we know the
[1:04:20] reason that's what i'm preaching about
[1:04:22] it quickened to my heart
[1:04:25] and i thought
[1:04:26] and i just
[1:04:27] about wrong throat having a jubilee
[1:04:30] praise the lord
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:32] that's something that had been on my
[1:04:34] heart for so long
[1:04:36] and just and i know i've heard it before
[1:04:39] but because the appetite was there
[1:04:42] and god come and sweat that across
[1:04:44] and it quickened to my heart just like
[1:04:46] that dropped in my heart and quickened
[1:04:48] praise the lord that's it
[1:04:51] it wasn't anything that was like an
[1:04:53] outstanding something that was going to
[1:04:55] answer the world's problems it's just
[1:04:57] something that newton had a desire for
[1:04:59] it's just something that i had been
[1:05:01] looking at and and got mindful of that
[1:05:04] and because of that desire god sent it
[1:05:06] down my you could have fed me a 32-ounce
[1:05:09] t-bone perfectly cooked in season and i
[1:05:12] wouldn't have been any happier
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:15] that fed knee is
[1:05:17] as much as the
[1:05:19] that steak would have
[1:05:21] praise the lord the best rack of ribs
[1:05:23] are the
[1:05:23] juiciest hunk of brisket that that that
[1:05:26] was
[1:05:27] that was
[1:05:28] food for the soul
[1:05:30] amen fed me praise the lord but you
[1:05:33] understand
[1:05:35] it wasn't anything i wasn't in my closet
[1:05:38] i wasn't down on my knees
[1:05:42] every moment that you live because of
[1:05:44] that desire because of that appetite god
[1:05:48] can drop something at any time amen
[1:05:51] somebody else somebody stranger in a
[1:05:54] supermarket might say it
[1:05:56] and and something quickened to you
[1:05:58] amen it's just that simple but it's
[1:06:01] based on your appetite it's based on
[1:06:04] your hunger
[1:06:05] where your heart is and what you're
[1:06:07] desiring what you're looking for amen
[1:06:10] because god's going to feel it saints
[1:06:13] he's going to feel it and the difference
[1:06:15] between when you are a sinner and now
[1:06:17] that you're born again
[1:06:19] is so astronomically different
[1:06:22] the appetite doesn't even resemble each
[1:06:25] other anymore
[1:06:26] amen it just it comes to the part of
[1:06:28] what you what you want
[1:06:31] what are you wanting see
[1:06:32] look
[1:06:34] in that same message
[1:06:37] now this this isn't um
[1:06:39] this quote isn't what
[1:06:41] uh what the lord had dropped in my heart
[1:06:43] this this came afterwards that part but
[1:06:47] this is from that message things that
[1:06:49] are to be
[1:06:50] he said now notice
[1:06:52] how the expecting mother on earth today
[1:06:55] how the mother's body craves for certain
[1:06:58] things
[1:06:59] mother pregnant amen
[1:07:02] craves for certain things
[1:07:04] you had a husband's have a wife that's
[1:07:07] been pregnant you know what i'm talking
[1:07:09] about
[1:07:10] or what he's talking about and i know it
[1:07:12] as well too amen it's the only time in
[1:07:16] life when
[1:07:17] uh
[1:07:18] it's probably the only time in life when
[1:07:20] certain women leap pickled ice cream
[1:07:24] or or
[1:07:25] or
[1:07:26] uh licorice chicken
[1:07:29] just
[1:07:31] or
[1:07:32] uh sardines or something
[1:07:34] it got a midnight at midnight they got a
[1:07:37] craving for sardines
[1:07:39] i don't know anybody who's ever had a
[1:07:41] craving for sardines you might have had
[1:07:44] to eat them for survival but a craving
[1:07:46] for sardines does that exist i don't
[1:07:48] want to offend anybody
[1:07:51] you know what i'm saying but when a
[1:07:53] mother when she gets that baby see
[1:07:55] there's just those things that she
[1:07:57] craves for certain things
[1:08:00] she didn't crave them before she got
[1:08:02] pregnant but now there's life in her
[1:08:05] because there's another life in her it's
[1:08:07] causing her body to react in the
[1:08:09] chemistry of her body to react in
[1:08:11] certain ways it tells her i need this
[1:08:14] i'm craving this i want this
[1:08:18] and and it's to get in her body to take
[1:08:21] care of her and the baby
[1:08:24] he said now i guess
[1:08:26] uh i'm speaking i hope to all adults
[1:08:29] that will understand the mother
[1:08:31] and the birth of the baby
[1:08:33] if there's something lacking in her body
[1:08:35] she begins to crave certain things now
[1:08:38] brother branham is isolating this to a
[1:08:41] woman who is pregnant
[1:08:43] a woman who is pregnant not a man
[1:08:47] despite all the
[1:08:48] world's trying to tell you today a man
[1:08:50] can't get pregnant i don't care how many
[1:08:52] emojis iphone puts on their phone of a
[1:08:55] pregnant man it is not possible
[1:08:58] it's biologically impossible
[1:09:02] but when a woman gets pregnant
[1:09:05] you see her body changes and that's who
[1:09:08] brother adam's talking about but you
[1:09:09] know it happens in your natural body
[1:09:12] under normal circumstances as well
[1:09:15] if your body starts craving or needing
[1:09:18] certain things your body will start
[1:09:20] acting in a certain way to make you want
[1:09:23] that whatever's in there
[1:09:25] brother bantam talked about the the the
[1:09:27] boy needing sulfur his body needing
[1:09:30] sulfur so much that he started eating
[1:09:33] the buy the petal off his bicycle and
[1:09:35] erasers off the pencil to get the sulfur
[1:09:38] that his body was needing so bad
[1:09:40] the same thing will happen to our bodies
[1:09:43] our natural bodies if your body is
[1:09:45] needing something uh it'll start craving
[1:09:48] that thing until you until you satisfy
[1:09:50] it with something
[1:09:52] and with that item with that chemical
[1:09:55] chemical that
[1:09:56] vitamin that that
[1:09:58] that thing that our that our bodies are
[1:10:00] made of that it needs uh
[1:10:02] i know
[1:10:04] sometimes on the job especially in the
[1:10:06] summer i'm getting a little dehydrated
[1:10:09] my body will start cramping up
[1:10:11] well that's just my body saying you need
[1:10:14] this get some potassium get some water
[1:10:17] uh get something in your body because my
[1:10:20] body is reacting to adversely to
[1:10:22] something
[1:10:24] because it needs something else right it
[1:10:27] needs this
[1:10:29] food or it needs this water it needs
[1:10:31] something to to help
[1:10:34] calm that down and take care of the
[1:10:35] problem see and your body does that now
[1:10:38] brother adam specifically talking about
[1:10:40] a pregnant woman because that's probably
[1:10:42] more uh of course i don't know how more
[1:10:45] extreme you can get than eating the
[1:10:46] petals off a bicycle but
[1:10:49] uh the extremities that we see when the
[1:10:52] woman gets pregnant sometimes like i
[1:10:54] said uh you know she's not gonna eat the
[1:10:57] i the pickle ice cream before after
[1:10:59] she's pregnant just during
[1:11:02] and and at midnight one o'clock or
[1:11:04] whatever
[1:11:05] however you can get it
[1:11:07] but our bodies are like that anyway
[1:11:10] well if our natural body is like that is
[1:11:12] not our spiritual body like that yeah it
[1:11:15] is not even at midnight one o'clock two
[1:11:17] o'clock in the morning isn't our
[1:11:19] spiritual bodies like that
[1:11:21] that craves for something as well
[1:11:24] has god ever woke you up at two or three
[1:11:26] in the morning and all of a sudden you
[1:11:28] don't realize why you're awake but
[1:11:29] something drops into your heart and and
[1:11:32] and you know it's god's presence there
[1:11:36] amen or during the day i talked about
[1:11:39] you know during the day or going down
[1:11:41] the road or meeting somebody but
[1:11:43] sometimes just wake up and not really
[1:11:45] realize or why god i need to get some
[1:11:47] sleep got to work tomorrow but god's got
[1:11:49] something he wants to drop into your
[1:11:50] heart right amen
[1:11:53] and god will do it
[1:11:55] look how dad
[1:11:57] he said i remember we was raised in such
[1:11:59] a poor family we didn't hardly have
[1:12:01] anything to eat when many of us
[1:12:03] uh were kids
[1:12:05] many of you suffered the same thing so
[1:12:08] it seems like it's getting back to that
[1:12:10] too
[1:12:11] so how that when before the baby would
[1:12:14] be born mother would crave something and
[1:12:17] dad would just pinch corners everything
[1:12:19] to get it for her see it's her the body
[1:12:22] her body the calcium so forth of her
[1:12:25] body the vitamins that she needs
[1:12:27] judy is being made up see and she craves
[1:12:30] for things the food for the coming child
[1:12:33] and how the parents
[1:12:35] they try to get this so the baby will be
[1:12:37] born as perfectly and happy as possible
[1:12:41] her body is craving that her body is
[1:12:45] needing that if her physical body is
[1:12:47] needing that friend our spiritual bodies
[1:12:50] are needing that
[1:12:51] she is craving that because she's
[1:12:54] pregnant
[1:12:55] amen she's
[1:12:57] she's craving it because her body has
[1:13:00] changed
[1:13:03] she's not the person she was before she
[1:13:06] was pregnant
[1:13:08] we are not the people we were before we
[1:13:11] became born again before we became
[1:13:13] christians
[1:13:15] and it changes our appetite yes it does
[1:13:18] it changes what we feed on
[1:13:20] it changes what we desire
[1:13:23] it changes what our treasures are what's
[1:13:26] important to us all those things change
[1:13:30] but because we're different people
[1:13:33] so what is our appetite
[1:13:35] what do we desire to feed on
[1:13:39] what do we desire to lay our treasures
[1:13:42] up that's where our heart is
[1:13:44] hungry thirst after righteousness you
[1:13:47] will be filled
[1:13:48] you shall be filled
[1:13:51] amen and that feeling is his spirit that
[1:13:54] comes and reveals itself to us and lets
[1:13:57] himself be known to us
[1:13:59] amen
[1:14:01] let me read this
[1:14:03] we'll go to second corinthians here but
[1:14:05] in thirst
[1:14:07] abraham says now we find god gives the
[1:14:10] control tower to you to give you the
[1:14:12] things that you need
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:15] now that's
[1:14:16] spiritual
[1:14:18] and physical
[1:14:19] god gives you the control tower so that
[1:14:22] it can give you the things that you need
[1:14:25] now the control tower in you is what
[1:14:28] directs you
[1:14:29] and this thirst runs this control tower
[1:14:32] tells you what you have need of
[1:14:35] spiritually speaking
[1:14:37] the control tower in the body and in the
[1:14:39] soul also there's a control tower of the
[1:14:41] body that tells you that you need the
[1:14:43] things in your body and it's brought to
[1:14:45] you by thirst
[1:14:47] your body starts thirsting
[1:14:49] lips get chapped mouth gets dry
[1:14:52] you ever notice you ever uh i used to
[1:14:54] have seen like old westerns back in the
[1:14:56] time and
[1:14:58] filmed in tucson or different places and
[1:15:00] and they'd be out in a desert and had no
[1:15:02] water
[1:15:04] they would go pick up a couple of
[1:15:05] pebbles or something off the ground and
[1:15:07] start sucking on a pebble
[1:15:09] because they're trying to generate some
[1:15:10] saliva in their mouth so that their
[1:15:12] mouths aren't so dry
[1:15:14] but then it gets to a place to where you
[1:15:16] can't even produce or generate any
[1:15:18] saliva because your body's gotten so
[1:15:20] dried up but what's it doing it's
[1:15:22] telling you it's like the crayons it's
[1:15:24] telling you you need water
[1:15:28] if you don't get water in simplistic
[1:15:31] terms with the body you're going to die
[1:15:35] if you don't get it you're going to die
[1:15:37] and it's telling you that
[1:15:39] it's letting you know
[1:15:41] i believe that's what god tries to let
[1:15:43] us know every day amen
[1:15:46] we need him
[1:15:48] we need that hunger that thirst we need
[1:15:52] to crave for god we need to crave for
[1:15:54] his life his
[1:15:56] his uh
[1:15:57] his spirit his words
[1:15:59] because that's what's going to sustain
[1:16:01] the spiritual man
[1:16:03] because if we neglect the spirit man
[1:16:05] it's going to die
[1:16:07] the spirit man is going to wither away
[1:16:09] and our spirit our experience with the
[1:16:11] lord is going to become nothing
[1:16:13] amen we'll
[1:16:15] quit the things of god
[1:16:17] reading our bible or praying or coming
[1:16:20] to church or
[1:16:22] tithes or offering whatever it is the
[1:16:24] things that we that we do in god's life
[1:16:27] it just it's showing that something's
[1:16:30] starting to dry up and wither away right
[1:16:33] when you start neglecting the things
[1:16:35] that you used to consider important
[1:16:38] things that you used to consider
[1:16:39] essential
[1:16:41] when those things start going away and
[1:16:43] driving up drying up oh i'm too busy to
[1:16:46] pray anymore then you're too busy to
[1:16:49] live
[1:16:51] because you can't live without it yes i
[1:16:53] i i'm too busy to pray or read my bible
[1:16:56] anymore i'm too busy to come to church
[1:16:59] well then i tell you what i'm gonna pray
[1:17:01] that god take everything out of your
[1:17:02] life that's encumbering you so that you
[1:17:05] can get back to where you should be with
[1:17:07] him
[1:17:09] and i probably don't even have to pray
[1:17:11] that because if you belong to him he'll
[1:17:12] do it anyway
[1:17:14] amen he'll do it anyway it's like uh
[1:17:18] i've experienced and i've known and
[1:17:21] ministering almost 35 years now
[1:17:24] and
[1:17:25] different places of the country
[1:17:26] different churches people
[1:17:28] i notice when people aren't given to the
[1:17:30] lord when they're not giving to the lord
[1:17:34] their lives start going downhill
[1:17:36] that's right
[1:17:37] things start getting in trouble for them
[1:17:40] they start having more problems
[1:17:42] different ways because look
[1:17:45] whether it's a set of tires or
[1:17:48] tithe in a box god's going to get it
[1:17:50] anyway
[1:17:52] that's just what happens
[1:17:54] god takes care of that so
[1:17:57] what boils down to then is god
[1:18:01] saying to you
[1:18:03] just like the mouth the pebbles
[1:18:05] just like the body the cramping god is
[1:18:08] telling you
[1:18:10] you need to change course you need to
[1:18:12] change something
[1:18:14] you need to let
[1:18:15] me be your desire spiritually
[1:18:19] hunger and thirst you shall be filled
[1:18:21] you need to change this
[1:18:25] get unbusy
[1:18:28] my work keeps me too busy well then
[1:18:31] god's gonna fire you
[1:18:34] if you belong to him
[1:18:36] and work is keeping you from him
[1:18:38] you're done you forget that job you're
[1:18:41] just quit now before you even get fired
[1:18:44] you understand because it's not god's
[1:18:46] not going to let anything become between
[1:18:48] you and him yes and if it starts to if
[1:18:51] it gets to that place to wear that
[1:18:53] thirsty it's like it's like uh
[1:18:56] we just read that first scripture when
[1:18:58] jesus said
[1:18:59] uh
[1:19:00] sell that you have give alms and give
[1:19:02] your alms provide yourselves now look
[1:19:05] what he's saying provide yourselves bags
[1:19:08] which a bag is just something that they
[1:19:10] carry their money in
[1:19:12] you notice that judas held the bag
[1:19:15] when they talked about
[1:19:17] jesus with the disciples judas was the
[1:19:19] possessor of the bag the bag is
[1:19:22] something that is what's held your your
[1:19:24] uh
[1:19:25] your wealth
[1:19:26] your possessions your treasure
[1:19:29] your treasures were in your bag see uh
[1:19:32] just like when david went down he had
[1:19:34] his bag and when david went down to the
[1:19:37] creek uh he had his bag he took those
[1:19:39] five smooth stones and he stuck them in
[1:19:41] his bag
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:44] his treasure
[1:19:45] so when he got to the place that he
[1:19:47] needed him it was in his back
[1:19:50] well jesus is saying provide yourselves
[1:19:53] bags which wax not which means what not
[1:19:56] a natural not this natural thing that
[1:19:59] holds a dollar or two
[1:20:02] but your bag of god of of the spirit of
[1:20:05] god that holds up treasures in heaven
[1:20:09] that moth can't
[1:20:10] corrupt and thieves cannot steal
[1:20:14] put your treasure there
[1:20:16] not here there
[1:20:18] praise the lord that's why he said so
[1:20:20] then he said where your treasure there's
[1:20:22] where your heart is
[1:20:23] amen
[1:20:24] there's where the difference comes
[1:20:27] there's control tower in the body tells
[1:20:28] you what you uh what need in your body
[1:20:30] it's brought to you by thirst
[1:20:32] and like i said the other that's god
[1:20:35] speaking to you
[1:20:36] amen that's god speaking to you
[1:20:40] also there's a control tower in your
[1:20:42] soul that tells you the spiritual things
[1:20:44] that you have need of something in your
[1:20:46] spirit
[1:20:48] and you by this listen now
[1:20:52] and you
[1:20:53] by this
[1:20:55] can tell what kind of life is
[1:20:57] controlling you
[1:21:00] amen amen by this
[1:21:04] that spirit control tower that tells you
[1:21:07] the spiritual things that you need
[1:21:10] by this that spirit it will tell you
[1:21:13] what kind of life is controlling you
[1:21:15] that's guess in a nutshell what i was
[1:21:17] sort of trying to explain earlier
[1:21:19] that's how you can know what life is
[1:21:22] controlling you
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:25] when you can see your desires are then
[1:21:27] you can tell that by that what are your
[1:21:30] desires
[1:21:31] by that what kind of thing what kind of
[1:21:33] something that's in you that's creating
[1:21:36] this desire that you have
[1:21:38] see
[1:21:39] it can tell in your soul what's this uh
[1:21:43] what
[1:21:44] this desire is by the nature of the
[1:21:46] thirst that you have
[1:21:48] on the nature of the thirst that you
[1:21:50] have
[1:21:51] amen got a couple more scriptures second
[1:21:53] corinthians before we close second
[1:21:56] corinthians chapter five
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:05] second corinthians chapter five just to
[1:22:07] try to finish this off now second
[1:22:09] corinthians 5
[1:22:11] verse 16.
[1:22:14] and i will honest i've had
[1:22:16] i've had a couple things in my heart
[1:22:18] i've wanted to try to to bring here
[1:22:21] and i
[1:22:23] every sunday it's it's almost like the
[1:22:25] lord is keeps putting it off so
[1:22:28] i just keep bringing what he gives me
[1:22:30] uh until we get to that point
[1:22:33] so just trusting him
[1:22:35] whatever whatever the lord's doing
[1:22:37] that's what matters the most second
[1:22:39] corinthians 5 16 now wherefore
[1:22:42] henceforth know we no man after the
[1:22:44] flesh yea though we have known christ
[1:22:47] after the flesh yet now henceforth
[1:22:50] knowing him no more
[1:22:52] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:22:55] a new creature he is the righteousness
[1:22:58] of jesus christ
[1:23:00] old things are passed away the appetite
[1:23:03] of the old days has passed away behold
[1:23:06] all things are become new not some
[1:23:09] he's not saying hold on to this all this
[1:23:11] stuff out here and and
[1:23:14] and but this is okay just give jesus
[1:23:16] this but not this give god this but not
[1:23:18] this no no all things all things have
[1:23:22] become new
[1:23:23] and all things are of god who has
[1:23:26] reconciled us to him
[1:23:28] by jesus christ
[1:23:31] and had given us the ministry of
[1:23:33] reconciliation
[1:23:35] we have been purchased by his blood and
[1:23:38] brought back together with him
[1:23:41] brother branham puts it this way man
[1:23:44] and god heaven and earth embrace one
[1:23:46] another again yes praise the lord
[1:23:50] the ministry of reconciliation to it
[1:23:53] that is to say that god was in christ
[1:23:57] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:24:00] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[1:24:04] had committed unto us the word of
[1:24:06] reconciliation how their how there can
[1:24:08] be a reconciliation because there's an
[1:24:10] imputation of sin
[1:24:13] or no imputation of sin when sin is not
[1:24:16] imputed when sin is not reckoned to you
[1:24:20] then you can be reconciled to the
[1:24:22] sinless one
[1:24:24] because god took away our sin and made
[1:24:27] us sinners or the very righteousness of
[1:24:31] jesus christ
[1:24:33] then man and god can be reconciled again
[1:24:36] amen
[1:24:37] the word of reconciliation
[1:24:40] now them
[1:24:42] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:24:45] as though god
[1:24:46] did this
[1:24:48] beseech you by us we pray you in christ
[1:24:51] said be reconciled to god
[1:24:55] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:24:58] who knew no sin that we
[1:25:01] but we might be made the righteousness
[1:25:04] of god in him
[1:25:05] praise the lord
[1:25:07] he took our sin because he was sinless
[1:25:10] and made us sinless who was sin
[1:25:13] so that we might can become the
[1:25:15] righteousness of jesus christ yes the
[1:25:18] only way we can be righteous
[1:25:20] is the fact that he gave us
[1:25:24] and robed us
[1:25:25] in his righteousness that's the only
[1:25:27] righteousness we could attain to it's
[1:25:29] the only way we could even say that we
[1:25:31] are righteous it's because of him
[1:25:34] did he make this man righteous this
[1:25:36] mutant benedict is not righteous
[1:25:38] my flesh my my
[1:25:40] my body here me as a human it's not
[1:25:43] righteous i make mistakes and do things
[1:25:44] wrong all the time
[1:25:46] we all do
[1:25:47] all of sin and come short of the glory
[1:25:49] of god but his righteousness is what i
[1:25:51] stand upon
[1:25:53] because it's his righteousness that
[1:25:54] destroyed sin in my life that made me
[1:25:57] righteous
[1:25:58] praise the lord amen amen thank god for
[1:26:02] that
[1:26:03] romans chapter 3.
[1:26:09] romans 3 21.
[1:26:16] but now let's see here romans 3 21 yes
[1:26:18] but now the righteousness of god
[1:26:21] without the law listen now the
[1:26:23] righteousness of god without the law is
[1:26:27] manifested
[1:26:28] who is he talking about
[1:26:30] he's talking about christ
[1:26:32] he's talking about jesus jesus was
[1:26:35] manifested as the righteousness of god
[1:26:38] without the law why
[1:26:40] did the law not pertain as we would say
[1:26:43] to christ because he was sinless
[1:26:46] why did law come into play to begin with
[1:26:50] because of sin
[1:26:53] because sin came in play
[1:26:56] it took it took a law to bring man under
[1:27:00] control
[1:27:02] to try to squelch the sin in their lives
[1:27:06] without a speed limit sign on the
[1:27:08] interstate could you imagine how fast
[1:27:10] people would be going on the interstate
[1:27:11] right now if there was no sign on there
[1:27:13] to tell them to go a certain limit
[1:27:16] i mean i know nobody obeys it anyway or
[1:27:18] most a lot of people
[1:27:20] but
[1:27:21] it would be
[1:27:23] anarchy
[1:27:24] i mean there's places in the world like
[1:27:26] the audubon where there is no speed
[1:27:27] limit and
[1:27:29] there's actually less accidents on the
[1:27:31] audubon than there is mo in a city like
[1:27:33] tucson
[1:27:35] that goes on because they're just going
[1:27:37] 200 miles an hour and they're all going
[1:27:39] this way and they're not stopping and
[1:27:40] they're not swerving and they're not
[1:27:41] exiting and coming on they're just going
[1:27:43] and they have actually less accidents
[1:27:45] than they do anyplace else but anyway
[1:27:47] that's beside the point but
[1:27:50] that law is to bring people under
[1:27:52] subjection to the law
[1:27:54] to to squelch a person down because a
[1:27:56] nature because the nature of a man is a
[1:27:59] brute beast
[1:28:00] and he is his nature is just to go wild
[1:28:03] and just to do anything and everything
[1:28:05] and
[1:28:06] you see kind of that nature exposing
[1:28:08] itself in this country today people are
[1:28:10] kind of just doing whatever they want
[1:28:12] right they're living doing going however
[1:28:15] they want to setting up homeless camps
[1:28:17] with needles and school yards and uh
[1:28:20] going and smashing stuff out of people's
[1:28:22] stores and just taking them and walking
[1:28:23] out going into a
[1:28:25] a drug store with a bag and just
[1:28:27] clearing off the shelves and just walk
[1:28:29] right out the door
[1:28:30] no regard for anything anybody or any
[1:28:33] you know
[1:28:34] it means absolutely nothing see
[1:28:36] no limits see so it becomes complete
[1:28:39] anarchy so the law came in to respect
[1:28:43] because god needed to bring man back
[1:28:45] into a perspective of
[1:28:48] being like him
[1:28:50] with laws
[1:28:52] with truth with justice with a heart
[1:28:54] that is obedient
[1:28:56] well jesus came without sin
[1:29:00] so because there was no sin in him
[1:29:04] he was the perfect man
[1:29:06] he didn't have to worry about a law to
[1:29:08] keep him under control the life that was
[1:29:10] in him
[1:29:11] kept him what he who he was supposed to
[1:29:13] be and that's what he projects to us yes
[1:29:17] not that he did away with the law the
[1:29:19] law has not been done away with
[1:29:21] because we're still humans brew beasts
[1:29:24] but the spirit of god the sinless spirit
[1:29:27] of god that came in us
[1:29:29] makes us that way automatically
[1:29:32] because it changed your desire
[1:29:34] it changed your appetite
[1:29:37] there was once time an appetite for you
[1:29:39] to just live however
[1:29:42] and drink smoke drugs gamble
[1:29:44] riders living whatever it was
[1:29:47] you might have done every bit of it
[1:29:49] because that was desiring you to do
[1:29:52] that brought you under the law
[1:29:54] but when you got born again and the
[1:29:56] spirit of christ came into you which was
[1:29:59] manifested without law
[1:30:01] it made you sinless
[1:30:04] and it changed your desires right now
[1:30:07] you don't need
[1:30:08] somebody to tell you
[1:30:11] don't go into denny's and have a meal
[1:30:14] and walk out without pain
[1:30:17] there's something in you that tells you
[1:30:19] that
[1:30:21] don't go into the to the jewelry store
[1:30:24] and bash the cabinet the counters out
[1:30:27] and steal
[1:30:28] tens of thousands of
[1:30:31] jewelry out of there
[1:30:33] because there's something in you that
[1:30:35] tells you that's wrong
[1:30:37] you shouldn't do that
[1:30:40] and it keeps you from doing it now i'm
[1:30:42] not going to say that these people that
[1:30:43] are doing it aren't doing it because
[1:30:45] they think it's the right thing to do i
[1:30:47] i don't know what they're thinking
[1:30:50] obviously they're not thinking right but
[1:30:52] you understand my point
[1:30:55] when christ is in you you don't need a
[1:30:58] sign to tell you
[1:30:59] don't do this don't do that don't go
[1:31:01] here don't go there because that life is
[1:31:04] already in you
[1:31:06] that life is what controls you now
[1:31:09] that life is what controls your desire
[1:31:12] that life is what controls your appetite
[1:31:14] that life is what tells you what to and
[1:31:17] god give us his word to live by
[1:31:20] so what greater thing do we have saints
[1:31:23] we have his life and his spirit in us
[1:31:26] and him and the letter of the word to
[1:31:28] live by what greater thing is there no
[1:31:31] wonder jesus said if you hunger and
[1:31:33] thirst after righteousness you shall be
[1:31:35] filled right
[1:31:37] amen
[1:31:38] it's inherent because god giveth yes and
[1:31:42] if we do it he will
[1:31:44] do what he said he would do yes
[1:31:47] the righteousness of god without the law
[1:31:50] is manifested
[1:31:53] being witnessed by the law and the
[1:31:55] prophets now look who witnesses it
[1:31:58] the law witnesses it
[1:32:00] because why because the law has no power
[1:32:03] over him
[1:32:05] amen you understand the law has no power
[1:32:08] over him
[1:32:10] because he's perfect he's sinless so the
[1:32:13] law has the so the law is witnessing
[1:32:16] this the prophet's witnessing because
[1:32:18] there's no power over that because he's
[1:32:21] sinless
[1:32:22] perfect
[1:32:24] even the righteousness of god which is
[1:32:27] by faith
[1:32:28] of jesus christ
[1:32:30] unto all and upon all them that believe
[1:32:35] for there is what
[1:32:37] there's no difference
[1:32:40] praise the lord amen so the
[1:32:42] righteousness that jesus christ was on
[1:32:44] when he was a flesh man living here is
[1:32:47] the same righteousness that you are now
[1:32:48] robbed of there's no difference
[1:32:51] no difference
[1:32:53] amen amen
[1:32:55] jesus christ that righteous come upon
[1:32:58] all them that believe
[1:32:59] and we believe i believe we're a group
[1:33:01] of believers today we believe that
[1:33:04] that faith brings us into that place
[1:33:08] to help us understand there's not a
[1:33:10] difference very well in the life that
[1:33:12] was in him
[1:33:13] and the life that was reviewed romans 8
[1:33:15] says if that same life that was in him
[1:33:17] is in you it'll do the same thing to you
[1:33:19] as it did to him right amen there's no
[1:33:22] difference yes praise the lord for all
[1:33:25] have sinned and come short of the glory
[1:33:27] of god
[1:33:28] being justified freely by his grace
[1:33:30] justified now that word justifies the
[1:33:32] same word is righteous
[1:33:34] righteous the word righteous means it is
[1:33:36] ought to be conditioned
[1:33:39] if you're righteous it means that you
[1:33:41] are what you supposed to be
[1:33:43] in christ in god's eyes in god's mind
[1:33:47] not the world in god's mind the way god
[1:33:50] looks at you your righteousness when god
[1:33:52] sees righteousness he sees it as it
[1:33:54] should be
[1:33:55] as he's seen it before the foundation of
[1:33:58] the world
[1:33:59] justifies the same thing when you've
[1:34:01] been justified it means though you had
[1:34:03] never done it in the first place right
[1:34:06] which means that it never in your life
[1:34:08] it never happened now that's not a
[1:34:10] physical application that is a spiritual
[1:34:13] application now some people try to
[1:34:15] attach that to a physical application
[1:34:18] and get things all messed up
[1:34:21] amen somebody might have
[1:34:24] been drunk and ran over a woman with a
[1:34:26] kid and killed them all and got in court
[1:34:28] and said well judge i never did it
[1:34:30] well we got witnesses that say you did
[1:34:32] it it's your car we got a photograph we
[1:34:35] got people that saw you we know that you
[1:34:38] are the one in there we know that well
[1:34:39] yeah but
[1:34:40] i've been justified oh yeah he'll throw
[1:34:43] you in jail quicker you can spit
[1:34:46] amen why because you did it right you
[1:34:49] can't take the spiritual application and
[1:34:51] apply it physically
[1:34:52] i've known people even in this message
[1:34:54] try to do that judge i didn't do it yes
[1:34:57] you did
[1:34:59] just admit you do it yes repent make
[1:35:02] things right in the physical but in
[1:35:04] god's eyes if if that applies you never
[1:35:08] did it in the first place
[1:35:09] praise the lord i'd rather go to jail
[1:35:12] for a million years and know that in
[1:35:14] god's eyes i never did it right
[1:35:16] praise the lord
[1:35:17] amen so that justifies the same thing
[1:35:20] justification brings a man into his
[1:35:22] place of righteousness
[1:35:24] it annihilates all that sin all that uh
[1:35:28] unbelief so that it brings you back into
[1:35:31] the ought to be conditioned yes this god
[1:35:34] sees you
[1:35:35] justified freely by his grace
[1:35:38] no law now through grace through the
[1:35:40] redemption that is in christ jesus
[1:35:44] redemption bring us back to where we
[1:35:46] were
[1:35:46] in the mind of god we were here
[1:35:49] we fell
[1:35:50] but then redemption brings us back to
[1:35:53] reconciling back to where we should be
[1:35:55] that's our outfit condition
[1:35:57] that's the righteousness of god that's
[1:35:59] the justification of god
[1:36:01] amen amen that's where a christian lives
[1:36:04] yes
[1:36:05] whom god has set forth to be a
[1:36:07] perpetuation
[1:36:08] through faith in his blood to declare
[1:36:11] his righteousness for the remission of
[1:36:13] sin that are passed through the
[1:36:15] forbearance of god now perpetuation is
[1:36:17] just someone who takes your place yes
[1:36:20] if someone is perpetuating for you it
[1:36:22] means that they've taken your place
[1:36:24] amen a proxy if you will they've taken
[1:36:26] your place jesus christ took our place
[1:36:29] yes became our perpetuation he became me
[1:36:32] so i might become him by grace
[1:36:36] not through the law but by grace yes why
[1:36:39] not through the law because christ and
[1:36:41] his sinlessness came and done and didn't
[1:36:43] do away with the law but brought us
[1:36:45] beyond the law
[1:36:47] amen that we might be the righteousness
[1:36:49] of jesus christ
[1:36:51] to declare i say at this time his
[1:36:54] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:36:56] the justifier
[1:36:58] of him which believeth in jesus where is
[1:37:01] boasting then
[1:37:03] because we didn't do it
[1:37:05] that's all he did it all praise the lord
[1:37:07] i just said yes lord
[1:37:09] just try to be obedient where's boasting
[1:37:13] it is excluded by what law of words nay
[1:37:16] but by the law of faith therefore we
[1:37:19] conclude that a man is justified by
[1:37:21] faith without the deeds of the law
[1:37:25] praise the lord
[1:37:27] it changes
[1:37:28] our appetite
[1:37:30] changes our desires
[1:37:32] it changes what we want in life
[1:37:38] the
[1:37:39] thing then is
[1:37:41] what does it witness to us what is it
[1:37:43] witness to you
[1:37:44] it's the lord speaking to our hearts now
[1:37:46] so what is that witness to you yes
[1:37:49] that
[1:37:50] that that word your treasure is in life
[1:37:54] i don't consider anything in my life i
[1:37:57] love my son i love my wife i love my
[1:37:58] daughter my grandchildren my son-in-law
[1:38:00] i love you all
[1:38:03] across the country i have friends and
[1:38:04] brothers and people i love so very
[1:38:06] dearly
[1:38:09] but i give every one of you up for him
[1:38:12] every one of you yes in a heartbeat i
[1:38:15] wouldn't even think twice right as much
[1:38:17] as i love you but i only love you
[1:38:19] because it's in him
[1:38:20] but i'd drop every one of you and i
[1:38:23] believe you better do the same thing to
[1:38:25] me
[1:38:26] yes and a heartbeat like hot potato as
[1:38:29] we said in the south
[1:38:31] for him
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:33] praise the lord because he's number one
[1:38:36] amen yes number one
[1:38:38] if he's number one that's going to be
[1:38:39] your desire
[1:38:40] that's going to be what your appetite is
[1:38:43] psalms 42
[1:38:45] as the heart pantheth after the water
[1:38:47] broke soul painteth my soul after thee o
[1:38:50] god
[1:38:51] my soul thirsteth for god for the living
[1:38:54] god
[1:38:55] when shall i come
[1:38:56] and appear before god
[1:38:59] praise the lord
[1:39:01] good way that david penned it there
[1:39:03] my soul longest after you yes
[1:39:07] that song we sang whoever wrote that
[1:39:09] song inspired by the scripture
[1:39:11] my soul desires for you lord my soul
[1:39:14] longeth after you
[1:39:16] it took the thought of
[1:39:18] the deer that might have been wounded or
[1:39:19] shot or something if that deer can get
[1:39:21] to some water and get some light giving
[1:39:24] uh
[1:39:25] uh
[1:39:26] chemicals in god-given chemicals into
[1:39:30] his body he can have a chance to live
[1:39:33] many can stop that bleeding and he can
[1:39:35] he can live past that see
[1:39:38] has that heart painted
[1:39:40] with every heartbeat
[1:39:42] that that goes by in our lives
[1:39:46] it draws us closer to him
[1:39:49] that song that
[1:39:53] that brother wrote
[1:39:54] lafontaine and i feel that hole
[1:39:58] hey man i feel that pull
[1:40:00] that what's that that pull is just
[1:40:02] something that's in you
[1:40:04] that that's that's what your appetite is
[1:40:06] your appetite is pulling you
[1:40:08] calling you to him
[1:40:10] amen and as we see these days going by
[1:40:13] and we see that time approaching
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:16] he becomes more and more precious
[1:40:18] more and more paramount all of our lives
[1:40:21] amen
[1:40:22] praise the lord jesus let's stand if we
[1:40:24] could
[1:40:33] it's what becomes
[1:40:35] the most important thing in life
[1:40:39] serving him living for him
[1:40:42] being here for him doing everything we
[1:40:45] can
[1:40:49] to feed our souls
[1:40:51] with the living god
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:57] praise the lord so
[1:40:59] the question then becomes
[1:41:00] what is your appetite
[1:41:03] what are you feeding on
[1:41:05] what do you desire to feed on
[1:41:08] amen
[1:41:09] do you pick up the bible and
[1:41:12] think of it as a drudgery that or a law
[1:41:15] you pick up the bible and say well i've
[1:41:17] got to read the bible today
[1:41:20] i'm not considered a christian
[1:41:23] if that's what it's about friend
[1:41:25] i'm not going to tell you to put it down
[1:41:26] but you need something more than just
[1:41:28] letters on a page
[1:41:30] amen you need a spirit that comes in
[1:41:33] because these are just this this is dead
[1:41:35] letter unless the spirit comes and
[1:41:36] brings it to life
[1:41:38] amen
[1:41:39] do you
[1:41:40] get into a position of prayer and think
[1:41:43] well i've got i got to spend this time i
[1:41:44] got to do this
[1:41:47] god won't like me anymore
[1:41:49] or i won't be considered a christian
[1:41:51] then
[1:41:52] it's a drudgery at that point it's not a
[1:41:54] desire
[1:41:55] amen
[1:41:56] when it's the desire to do it freely
[1:41:59] and that's what our whole lives are to
[1:42:01] him it's free
[1:42:02] it's it's living in the liberty that is
[1:42:05] jesus christ
[1:42:07] because we're dead and our lives are
[1:42:08] hitting him through christ
[1:42:10] praise the lord
[1:42:12] amen let's sing this little chorus
[1:42:15] and we worship the lord before we go
[1:42:17] today
[1:42:18] you know brother brown said the best
[1:42:19] time to worship is after the word has
[1:42:21] gone forth
[1:42:22] god has brought that bomb and soothed
[1:42:24] over that spirit and
[1:42:27] and that worship that is here just draws

[1:44:58] it's what we're thirsting for it's what
[1:45:00] we're longing for it's what we want out
[1:45:02] of life yes
[1:45:04] it comes from the depths of our soul
[1:45:06] because that's where our treasures are

[1:45:32] praise the lord
[1:45:34] you know friends he's so good to us
[1:45:37] and serving the lord jesus is the
[1:45:39] greatest privilege that human has ever
[1:45:41] had yes and i'm thankful that he
[1:45:44] put it in my life
[1:45:46] and the surrender of my life
[1:45:48] to do that to him
[1:45:50] to him and to him only
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:54] praise the lord god bless you
[1:45:56] amen god is good
[1:45:59] i appreciate each one of you being here
[1:46:01] being in the house of the lord trust
[1:46:03] something was said to bless you today
[1:46:06] amen
[1:46:07] that our desires continually be to him
[1:46:10] that our appetite continually to be for
[1:46:13] you
[1:46:14] you know your appetite
[1:46:16] your appetite
[1:46:18] like i was saying just very quickly
[1:46:20] your appetite isn't developed
[1:46:23] because
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:25] of your wanting it
[1:46:27] your appetite develops because your body
[1:46:30] wants it
[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:34] i i've seen a lot of people and i eat
[1:46:37] kind of slow you all know that right but
[1:46:38] now i ain't kind of slow i've seen
[1:46:41] people buying so fast
[1:46:43] most people eat i guess what you
[1:46:45] consider normal
[1:46:47] i'm slow not normal
[1:46:49] but i've seen people eat so fast
[1:46:52] and
[1:46:53] and i think
[1:46:54] to myself now
[1:46:56] not being critical but i think that
[1:46:58] person is just eating to survive
[1:47:01] that's they're just putting food down
[1:47:02] their throat to live
[1:47:04] but i don't need to live i eat because i
[1:47:07] enjoy it
[1:47:08] you understand
[1:47:10] because i want that to be
[1:47:12] something
[1:47:14] that's a continual spiritual blessing to
[1:47:17] me
[1:47:18] to not eat so fast
[1:47:20] i've gone through the bible in a year
[1:47:22] and done those things like people do but
[1:47:24] i like pouring over that word i like
[1:47:27] eating it slow like i do
[1:47:29] physically i guess that's just the
[1:47:31] nature different natures of different
[1:47:33] people in that but
[1:47:34] i thought i think you know they just eat
[1:47:36] just to have something in their belly
[1:47:38] but i don't eat for that reason
[1:47:41] i eat because i enjoy food
[1:47:44] i eat because it tastes good
[1:47:46] i don't eat stuff it doesn't taste good
[1:47:48] to me and maybe it doesn't taste good to
[1:47:50] me because my body doesn't need it i
[1:47:52] don't know but i only eat because it
[1:47:54] tastes good and i take my time eating it
[1:47:56] i had
[1:47:58] a good friend i know i ate fat she was
[1:48:00] in the army he was in the reserves i
[1:48:02] know why he was he was a lineman and the
[1:48:04] power company
[1:48:05] he ate i couldn't have my food salted as
[1:48:09] fast as he'd have his plate clear
[1:48:12] he said boy you still got a lot of food
[1:48:14] there yes and looks like you're
[1:48:17] i said yeah your plate's empty how are
[1:48:19] you enjoying your food he said i've ate
[1:48:21] it already i said so you're not enjoying
[1:48:23] your food anymore he says no i've
[1:48:25] already ate it that's why i'm still
[1:48:26] enjoying mine
[1:48:29] so eat your heart
[1:48:30] out i'm still enjoying mine and i guess
[1:48:34] i'm that way i try to
[1:48:36] probably like that way a lot spiritually
[1:48:38] too
[1:48:39] i just just pour over it amen
[1:48:42] spiritually
[1:48:43] pour over it
[1:48:46] i just take my time and
[1:48:48] see if there's something in there god is
[1:48:49] there something in there i need to know
[1:48:51] see the appetite doesn't come from you
[1:48:54] it comes from your body it comes from a

[1:50:24] um
[1:50:25] i i'll say this i don't know i just felt
[1:50:28] what you
[1:50:29] had described what you went through this
[1:50:31] morning there's a copa devil that's
[1:50:33] trying to fight this church

[1:50:45] said there's one place we meet the lord
[1:50:47] every day every minute of our lives is
[1:50:50] under the shed blood of jesus christ and
[1:50:53] we make to continually flee the blood of
[1:50:56] jesus christ yes yeah and we don't have
[1:50:59] to claim praise the lord uh anything
[1:51:01] that the devil gives us god has not
[1:51:03] given us a spirit of fear by power of
[1:51:06] love and of a sound mind amen and i
[1:51:09] believe that for every one of you so
[1:51:12] don't go in fear when it came upon my
[1:51:14] brother and myself i says god's in
[1:51:17] control

[1:51:33] to notice something
[1:51:35] and our precious brother charlie just
[1:51:37] passed but um i want you to notice
[1:51:39] something
[1:51:41] that
[1:51:42] they had a severe covet and a more
[1:51:46] severe coping but less
[1:51:48] contagious
[1:51:49] and then a very much less severe
[1:51:53] but more contagious
[1:51:55] that
[1:51:56] seems like probably what's going on now
[1:51:59] maybe sister shelia sister matisse
[1:52:02] katy brothers my family different ones
[1:52:06] through the omnicron
[1:52:07] but you understand that now

[1:52:18] now have immunity to cope

[1:52:25] praise the lord
[1:52:27] but it was much less severe notice how
[1:52:29] god
[1:52:30] for the most part protected us from all
[1:52:32] those harsh ones yes yeah and then
[1:52:36] this this lesser severe one has just
[1:52:38] kind of swept through
[1:52:40] and people are out a few weeks or
[1:52:42] something they're not feeling good but
[1:52:44] so thankful but but it's god's hands on
