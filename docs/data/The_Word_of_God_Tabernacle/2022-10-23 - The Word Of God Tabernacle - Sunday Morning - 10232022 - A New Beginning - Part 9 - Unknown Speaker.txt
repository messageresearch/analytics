everything that we do we do by faith believing amen we don't necessarily have any tangible evidence all the tangible evidence people say they have science and medicine proves away but you got to believe it by faith it's got to be something inside the individual that says I know there's an Almighty I know there is a God that made and controls this world this universe these galaxies every molecule every Star every atom he knows it he created it and he controls every bit of it we believe in that God because he is our Lord and savior the condescended in the body of Jesus Christ to become man just like you and me to become a Kinfolk to us to suffer and to go through all the shame pain sickness the hurting you ever realize there is it ever dawned on us at the last moments of our

move praise the Lord Jesus amen we want to go to the Lord in prayer now amen and take a prayer request that we have written down I have a few to mention to you I appreciate everyone's prayers for me while I was gone uh it was a it was a tough week it's pretty tiring thank you buddy praise the Lord his prayers but the lord always takes care amen and makes a way praise the Lord so thankful the Lord bless us and be able to get back home yesterday morning and go to Emma's birthday party which we were happy to be able to be a part of and thank the Lord I'm not sure I was actually there but just in body I was uh pretty tired but uh thank the Lord to be able to be a part of that and amen appreciate each one of his prayers amen there I have a prayer request uh of course I want to remember brother Dennis and his wife Leah is out of town uh they took visit us he said last week to South Carolina North Carolina over a bit because I believe was for aunt uh there in the upper part of South Carolina just below North Carolina closed like I said to where uh actually where brother Nolan and sister Shirley live so pray for them they'll be back I think the middle of the week this week if I remember right so please remember them in prayer if you would also brother Danny text me and you know we have been praying here for his Noisy Neighbor upstairs to move out and the neighbor upstairs finally moved down now another neighbors moved in he said is louder than the last thinkers so um so yes the Supreme didn't get much sleep last night he woke up with a crick in his neck and kind of in pain so please remember him in prayer if you would today amen for those neighbors and for his landlord I guess to Danny wants to move out so that's I guess probably above every all and everything maybe is the Lord provide another place for him to be able to move to because beyond all the complications that he's endured he really just wants to try to move out of that place into a different better facility so I believe the Lord is more than able to do that amen also remember uh Shariah text me this morning and said that Alice woke up this morning and not feeling well and had a caught a little bit of a cough I think yesterday at the party and uh it apparently has turned into a cold and she has fever so please remember Alice in prayer this morning and of course the family uh if you would that's there with with Alice right and Gabriel So amen also got a request of prayer from um brother Angel fraho so it was a little leaky so I thought I would just read it to you here off the text he sent me he said asking for prayers for our household here asking for healing physically and mostly mentally and spiritually asking that God cleanses everyone's hearts and Minds asking for God to spread his holy love and forgiveness upon us all also asking God to lead us and guide us every day may God draw us closer to him so that we reflect him daily to everyone around us and we ask for God's complete will and blessings in our lives daily we also ask God to do unto our church family as well may God bless you all daily and may all your walk all our walks be closer to our Lord and savior just a closer walk with thee Jesus granted is my plea daily walking close to thee let it be Lord let it be amen so that's brother Angel and his request of prayer so let's remember obviously the family there this morning came into those prayer requests also got a couple prayer requests one from Sister Norma here uh thank you for your prayers for Katrina they did a test on her uh uh uh on her place like on her place and found mold and then so now I can pray the landlord does something or she's able to move out amen that's some nasty stuff all this so amen so let's remember continue to remember that request of Prayer of course amen uh that's a praise from Sister Norma is this a prayer request or just you said please read this story but is it a request or a there's not a request I'll do it after the prayer requests it's not a request we'll do that after we get dumped in here and also I believe this is Joel's handwriting oh yeah Joel he has a praise report too so amen so that's a prayer request you know what happened on spoken requesting you know Lord knows all of my needs glad to have sister Julie with us we just have a tough week so amen appreciate that wreck and then a little stroke I guess you'll call it so I had to have him glad to be here I appreciate you love you let's stand to our feet if we could and then we'll take these needs to the Lord in prayer and be interested in the Lord's mindful of every one of them and then also sister Sheila text me sometime this week she bumped her sore on her arm again and flamed it up a little bit again I guess it's doing a little better now hopefully amen so amen she's not a yes so glad it's doing better but she does have a payment you say that he's heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we've come to you humbly with our heads bound from the Earth from which we came Lord Jesus Jesus knowing that without you were nothing Lord we ask that you'd forgive us of our sins and shortcomings in anything that we've done that would be displeasing to you yes that anything that would stand in the way of us being able to take a full advantage of the blood that you shed on Calvary you know your forgiveness as father God forgive us father as we move on through our service Lord Jesus these requests that we brought to you father our sister Julie who's been through a rough week father we know that you're with her and then you seems to be with you yeah Lord sister Sheila they continue to touch her hand Lord and for the dentist and his wife or when we give them traveling mercies yeah standing as well as with that situation Lord many of us have been in similar situations living situations where certain things out of our control but Lord we give them to you because there are things in your control yes our well-being is is in your hands and with trust and loves love you because we know that you're going to take care of us and do what's best for us Lord God and the requests father for sister Norma's daughter Katrina the home Lord Jesus made landlord be a good landlord and do what they should to take care and eradicate the situation amen for all the many requests and ailments and physical and spiritual and emotional that each and every one of us have that we deal with each and every day Lord the prio family for those who couldn't be here for whatever reason they may be certainly commit everything and everyone into your hands and we ask you everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord amen you can be seated if you'd like amen as I said we have some praise reports here so thank God for that amen we always trust that our prayer requests become praise reports of the grace of God and the moving of his hands so amen good to have sister Teresa back had a good trip amen this awesome post and Billy there so that's wonderful I hope to get to get up there one of these times that's supposed to go in December but they wiped our calendar clean so I don't know what we're going to do now amen but we're still building misters up in St Louis and um Salt Lake so hopefully we'll get up there one time sister Norma has a praise for Katrina her granddaughter uh is starting to feel better uh doctor found out she had E coli and started her own some special medications so praise the Lord thank God that she started she's feeling much better so amen Joel has a praise report uh Joel says this was two weeks ago I know he wanted to give this last Sunday but they weren't able to make it this was two weeks ago me and my mom and sister were going out to some stores but before we got on the freeway the car made a weird sound so we pulled over and prayed uh we got out of the uh freeway but the uh the devil made me fear so I said get out of my head and the car was fine amen praise the Lord great great car back this sound was gone and amen fear was gone and God took care of it so praise the Lord amen sister Matisse wrote this uh you remember this story I'm just going to read it um it says Pastor do you remember the story of brother green told of the time he was respecting the sanctuary of the Tabernacle uh he was shot from Brother random started shouting across the sanctuary yes I do remember that story uh to ask brother green question about lunch going to eat or something it was about lunch yeah brother Branham was behind that you remember the story behind the pulpit brother green was over there and brother green was I think vacuuming or something he was so uh afraid of church order he didn't want to bump the chair legs with the vacuum with the noise it made and and then all of a sudden he's back there and brother Perry yelled a brother Branham yells out hey and talks to brother green across the pool I saw yes I remember that story uh that that's pretty much the gist of it fairly were you going to eat and all this and so brother brother Green's life he's trying to whisper brother you see he learned a great lesson about church War at that time um let me see if I can continue the story shocked when he continued to whisper even though they were the only two in the church brother Graham continued shouting the conversation across the room yes now people were present and still trying to get something for God I'm quiet if everything is uh leaving together I talk in the sanctuary I was rebuking for talking the sanctuary just a short comment for a person everyone uh was half out already so I believe uh that of course that wasn't here but uh well we try to make sure when when we we do reverence our sanctuary as much as possible but obviously when uh when that situation came up it showed brother green a little bit of lesson that brother Branham had about the reverancing of the sanctuary and and how we conduct ourselves in God's house during service or not during service but there was nothing out of line that brother Brown had done or anything that was displeasing to the Lord and uh but brother green had been taught so much have been and instilled in him by others so much that he was even afraid to bump the chair leg uh with vacuum cleaner but um but brother Branham taught him a valuable lesson there but we do when we leave we try to we have a place to Fellowship so this is not a place of Fellowship except with him we do have a place to fellowship and we have beautiful weather in Tucson to step outside and fellowship so that's what we try to do and make sure uh we keep this place as worshipful as possible amen amen so uh we do know that but thank the Lord for that amen and I do yes I remember the story very vividly um brother brother green told his story it's quite often I guess maybe people would get sick of hearing them but I think he did that a lot of times they helped me remember a lot of the detail of the stories probably just because of that I still remember that so God knows yes praise the Lord let's sing uh song number 698 amen he's God on the mountain s here for you I sung this in a while I as you all know my personal testimony I have a hard time struggle with this song Sometimes so bear with me if uh get a little emotional but I try to sing it to the glory of the Lord so see it life is easy when you're up on the mountain you've got peace of mind [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] all comes easy when life says [Music] Temptations as we as we begin is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well that's when things [Music] amen glory is not on the mountain he's still got in the valley when things go wrong well he makes them run and the god of the good times he's still got in the bad times the god of the game he's still gone let's sing it again now [Music] he's still got in the valley when things go wrong he makes him run and the god of the good times he's still God in the bad times the god of the day he's still got in the night yes the god of the day he's still got in the night amen yes he is hallelujah thank Jesus as such an inspirational song Amen I know it was written by our sister McKamey but you know she's not in the message but that is such an inspirational song Amen praise the Lord and it is so true how we lose sight of that so many times and he's God in the valley just as much as he's got in the mountain he's God when you're going through very hard times just like he is God when everything seems to be one perfect he's still gone that doesn't change anything amen praise the Lord Jesus he takes it he makes it all right amen thank you Lord sometimes we can't recognize it sometimes we can't see it sometimes our vision is so short-sighted we don't recognize God's hands upon it but if you have faith to believe you know that he will anything that's not to our betterment amen praise the Lord Jesus amen I love it don't you praise the Lord God bless you amen appreciate the Lord's goodness to us thank you for all the good positive testimonies amen we'll stand to our feet now amen turn to the word of God of his precious word amen amen we're going to turn our Bibles again now to Genesis chapter 1. he goes first a couple of students again as we go into the new the new beginning part nine part nine we're getting there Saints amen we're getting there praise the Lord getting to the park basically pretty much today it's going to be a lot of where we're living and just beyond where we're at now so amen we've gone back from the beginning in Genesis and we of course you read that scripture every time but and gone through time and hit some high points and getting us to this place here kind of where we're at now because remember starting at the beginning we're going to that basically what we consider or know of is to be the end even though it's not an end uh you know what I'm saying in that new city that new beginning praise the Lord so we're kind of about halfway there maybe to that point so amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 before we read let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus we are again grateful Lord of grace and mercy in our lives thankful father for the spirit that we have felt this morning and knowing that you are here God we're just a few in number father but Mighty in power and strength because you are on our side Lord and you are here and you are with us doing the exceedingly abundantly bringing our faith Lord we feeling the moving of that Spirit brings our faith up Lord to a level to receive whatever we have need of today we know that you're still the same God today as you have always been and you're here right now God doing that for each one of us Lord and bringing us to that place that we need to that time God that as we've come and gathered here in your house Lord and that time God that you've given us consecrated Sanctified set aside Lord hear at that time looking to hear from you again Lord from your word speak to us father speak to me Lord speak to us may you anoint speaker and hear our ears our lips all that is said and done today God let it be to glorify magnify and exalt you we thank you Lord for those that have come Lord for those who weren't able to make it today those who may be streaming Lord for every request that was made mentioned Lord everything that was known you knew them before they ever became requests trusting and believing your hand upon each one of them now and now upon us here at this place God expecting you once again to reveal your word to our heart openness to us help us see and hear what you'd have us to see and know God is nothing new nothing outside your scripture nothing outside the message Lord nothing that but just bringing back to remembrance and helping us Lord to energize our faith to bring us along to the place of this time of a Rapture lording and a going home and catching away Lord we can commit ourselves to you and just trust your hand upon us in the remaining part of the service we rebuke every demonic Spirit we try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done for the precious holy lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you'd like so just talking about how we are at this place now uh through this life through this time uh even brother Noel hit on it a little bit and talking about the wickedness of the world and the evilness of the hour that we live and things that are going on in this world today that 10 years ago I never would have fathomed 20 years ago wasn't even a fault but things that are being said and done today things that are uh anti-science anti-medicine anti-biology anti-god uh is becoming extremely prevalent uh it seems like we're trying to be anyway infiltrating into the minds and hearts of people more probably now than it ever has because we're coming to an end and a winding up because all of this now is coming to a place it's coming to a head amen it's really coming to two heads actually one head is the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to be raptured and go home that's the verse second is going to be a time where the whole world is gathered foolish virgin Jew and all gathered together to that place of of Armageddon amen that's where it's all going you hear so many times even the president United States mentioned and uttered that word a couple of weeks ago about Armageddon when it come to Russia and nuclear possible nuclear weapons and War and things like that even mentioned like the the thought of Armageddon uh so it's it's quite a word that the world is familiar with but probably very few have any understanding of what it is or what it means or what's going to happen amen so but as of where we are at we know that now we are at a time of a Rapture the bride is at the place at the time of the going home how many more days how many more months how many more years we don't know we this might be the day or it might be a hundred years from now right we don't know brother random talks about from six to nine in the morning well six to nine in the morning to who Arizona there's three hours difference at least until next week there's three hours difference between here and the East Coast there's three hours difference between North Carolina and California all the time it's three hours difference so that's the three hour difference between six and nine is it going to be in Russia is it going to be in China is it going to be in Africa where it says six to nine going to be we don't know it could be any time amen I kind of think it's going to be between six and nine East Coast time or the profit of the hours time that was here that that that's my personal opinion that means absolutely nothing that ten dollars will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks but that's my opinion anyway I think that's because the six nine because I don't believe that brother Brown said anything uh that was out of sort so if the six to nine came up based on the watches of the scripture I believe there's irrelevance to it and based on the fact that he was here from uh that East Coast time frame I tend to believe it's going to be six to nine in the morning East Coast time that's my opinion again that means very little but it's still my opinion uh you can have what you want bottom line is it can be any time it could be at any moment it could be at any day it could still be today we don't know but it could be a hundred years from now we don't know I don't believe it's going to be but 40 years ago I didn't think I'd be here today 50 60 years ago you probably all didn't know just going to be here today how would I ever have guessed that we would have kids or my kids would be in their 30s well sorry Captain almost 30s mind that look uh almost 30. uh and almost three grandchildren I never would have imagined being here could you uh and and having kids and grandchildren and maybe even great-grandchildren I don't know and and where we are today so we don't know but we do know that the Rapture is a ham we do know that we are in the season of the coming of the Lord and it could be at any time but when the Rapture comes the bride will leave this place and she will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air amen the second coming of the lord we will go he is coming there he comes as we go this time he doesn't come to Earth but we meet him in the air and we go to a wedding supper a three and a half year period of a wedding supper of the Lamb that's where the bride goes to the supper during the three and a half years of tribulation now I left out uh a lot of the teaching of Daniel 70 weeks in this study uh just for the mere fact that that would have taken up so much more of this and I just wanted to mainly hit the high points along to get us from beginning to end uh through those through those more significant periods and high points and where we're living today so uh to understand the last three and a half years of Daniel 70 weeks we understand that Jesus when he was here fulfilled the first three and a half years and he was killed and cut off as the scripture says in the midst in the middle of that three and uh seven years that first three and a half years of his ministry from 30 to 33 and a half cut off in the midst the last three and a half is to come after the bride is gone the last three and a half years of that ministry will be fulfilled in the tribulation and as God goes back to the Jews and be and and be ministered through Moses and Elijah in uh in Revelation 11 because at that time the anointing will have gone back to the Jews which we've talked about a couple of times we'll be there for them for Revelation 11. uh I've had people say was is it going to be literally Moses and literally Elijah I've had people say it won't be literally it'll just be the spirit of again you I haven't found where brother Branham said specifically uh if you do know let me know uh that it's going to be the literal Moses and the literal Elijah uh I don't know I don't I personally don't think it will be the literal Moses and Elijah I believe it'll be the spirit of those men that will be in men that are probably again my opinion probably on earth now because if they're literal men they would have to be born and they would have to grow up and there would have to be people the men that were there uh in the land at the time who received the spirit I just like brother Branham of course uh here for the Gentiles uh brother Adam was a man he was he was born he was raised the Lord began to deal with him and the spirit of Elijah came on it right and began to do the works and had the spirit of Elijah in the scripture I I personally believe it's going to be a lot the same way in Revelation 11 with those two and uh in Israel there as they grow up and receive the spirit of of Moses and one of Elijah you can go back and read the the the demonstrations that they have basically tell of who they are uh one has the power to shut up Heaven that it rained not days in the prophecy well that's that's pretty evident that's Elijah Elijah went to Ahab and did the exact same thing there'll be no do and no rain drop fall from Heaven until I call for it that's what Elijah told e Ahab and that's exactly what happened he shut up the Heavens amen and it didn't rain until he called for it amen and the second was these have the power to shut up heaven and power over the waters to turn them to blood and dismite the Earth with plays that everybody knows the the story of Moses in the land of Goshen in Egypt exactly what took place in the water turning the blood and all the plagues so it's not hard to understand that those two are going to be and distribute or manifest the spirit of Moses and Elijah to to those people at that time so that three and a half years is going to be that period and during that period of time is where they begin to realize and receive by Revelation who Jesus Christ was and at the end and we've already talked about this we know and I read that quote at the end of that marriage supper and at the end of the tribulation period Jesus Will slip away from the Gentile bride and reveal himself to his brother just like Joseph did Joseph dismissed his Gentiles the the Gentile bride the marriage supper will be dismissed to the uh to the kingdom and Jesus Will slip down and reveal himself to his brothers and they realize who they did now this is at the end of that period of time the end of that three and a half years the end of that tribulation but there's also the great thing that's going to take place at the end of that time is is during that tribulation and we know the tribulation the tribulation is not for the brine because remember the tribulation is a purification period it's a time of purging and the bride does not need any purification she does not need any purifying uh just his brother Patty prayed to us and prayed this morning and and talked about how the bride is she's pure now Justified as if though she had never done it in the first place robed in his righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish well if she is without spot wrinkle or blemish what purpose of what need would there be for the bride to go through the tribulation purging period she's already been Purge she's already been found innocent she's already been found Guiltless she's married to the righteous Son of God Jesus Christ and she's going to a married supper of the Lamb amen the marriage supper comes after the after the ceremony so where does the ceremony of the marriage take place it's not there it's got to be here Christ is marrying his bride right here right now amen she's slit he is slipped on the wedding band of unmerited Grace to his bride and she's received the spirit of him now so that when we leave here we go to the reception we go to the supper praise the Lord so if she is married to him now become white then what point is there for her to go through that purging period She doesn't need any purging she's pure already amen she's perfect undefiled wedding the wearing the wedding Garment of of unmerited Grace the the bride making herself ready with the with with the bridegroom's garment the word he took our place so that we could take his right and he is perfect without spot wrinkle or blemish his bride is perfect without spot wrinkle or blemish not you as a human but the word the of Christ coming in you has made you perfect has purged you of all unrighteousness Justified you because you never did it in the first place praise God just cause you got tricked into something on your flesh or say something or a little emotion or anger or something come up the emotion and the spirit of a human or something and those things happen to all of us hopefully less and less as we live our lives amen as we grow more like Jesus Christ those things happen less and less than our life amen amen until we get to the point that that that it won't be perfect but in a body change it'll be perfect amen so why would the bride need to go through purification she doesn't tribulation is purification tribulation will be for the foolish virgin and the 144 000 for the Jews and those that did not receive it now they will be purged during that period of time the rest will be done away with it amen through this battle through this time of tribulation now we see everything Gathering itself together we've already got to that place of of pretty much the governments of the world crying and yelling to become one one world let's all become one world well you see what happens in this country when we are dependent on other countries and one country decides to invade Another Country what happens to us we tend to suffer a little bit as a result we shouldn't have to because I believe personally we are a country of self-sufficiency we should be able to uh fend for ourselves but we've become so dependent on things from other countries Well when things go wrong in that country that we can't control it affects us but you see the whole world it's becoming this one world we want a United Nations used to be the League of Nations the United Nations now all come together we're one world we're one people we're all together it's the exact same life Satan tried to tell the the the the the Jews Israel back in the day with uh with with Balaam he told them the exact same thing well we're all one we're all one people let's just all come together let's just have those that are ungodly marry him with the children of God it doesn't work that way we are not one we are not all together we are not a United group now the world order is the Council of churches is and the bride is but she's not United with them and they hate you for it that's why they're trying to squeeze the Christian out now they just call it Christian because they don't know that there's a segment of that Christianity of that Christian Dome that is a pure undefiled bride of Jesus Christ they kind of want you all together if you're a Christian you're just a Christian well let me tell you friend they're not all the same just like not all Israel according to the scripture not all says they're Israel's Israel not all that says they're a Christian not all that says their bride is bride amen but this world is coming together it's giving his head coming to that place of headship to where it it it ends up and winds up at that place at the end of the tribulation that winds up the tribulation uh uh to Armageddon let me read you a couple of things here remember it winds up at Armageddon now brother said in the patriarch Abraham Bakersfield California he said that's that's all we care to know God promised it how is it going to be I can't tell you but God said so amen we just have faith he'll send Jesus Christ the second time he will come in a physical form brother Branham said in in the Rapture even though we're going in the air to meet him Amen in a physical form he will claim his own there will be 1 000 years Millennium Reign upon this Earth with him with the redeemed now I want to put something before you and I hope people don't take this wrong but we know that in the second coming of the Bride of this last day and the end times Jesus Christ will not set his feet in a Corporal body upon this Earth we know that amen amen so what is he doing instead what has he done and doing instead whose feet have set upon this planet the first fruits of that God coming in demonstration to show to this bride now the man was not God but he produced God so closely that people thought he was God yeah amen just like Abraham just like when he turned his back and got and could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart God doing it through a man putting his feet upon this Earth with the bride because now brother Pat said the bride absolutely right he's a part of the problem we're all right now how does God how has God returned to this earth in its fullness in this last day when he is not going to do it in the rapture he's done it through us he did it in a first fruit if you will through a prophet through brother Branham who again lived a life so close to God people thought he was God people today still say he was God still worship and believe that he was still baptized in his name even to this day that's how close it was amen now in in that and the opening and revealing of the word this bride becoming this word through the revelation of that word remember Revelation the best way I could explain it Revelation is something that becomes a part of you it is much a part of you as your as your uh the Flesh of your skin and your bone and and your thought and your heart and everything about you it just becomes a part of it a revelation is something that when God gives it to you you cannot deny you can never see it a different way uh I give the example if you remember it's been years ago so I'll do it again you give the example I'll give the example of that sign it's something the lord gave me one day uh that uh sign that people used to make that had Jesus written on it like a wooden sign but the outside Parts was what was accentuated so when you looked at it with I guess you'd say an untrained eye you look at it all you see is just a bunch of scribble it looks like you know what I'm talking about yeah because the inside is all accentuated but then people say well what does that say he said it doesn't say anything all I see is some lines here and some lines here and this going over here and it doesn't make any sense to me what what do you got that in your living room for look at it again you got to look at it real close and look at it real hard somebody may even have to tell you what it says but when you see the inside between the lines and you see the inside between the existing the accentuated parts and you see it says j-e-s-u-s you say oh it says Jesus I see it now amen you ever done that with a word it's God ever done that to you with the scripture oh I see it now yeah well when you see it you can't unsee it right now every single time I'll look at one of those post one of those pieces of wood I don't see the in the scribble all I see is Jesus I can't see it any other way anymore because God my eyes had been open I see it that's a revelation amen when God reveals it to you like that you don't see it any other way you don't see the denominational way you don't see it some uh uh a seminary way you see it the way God revealed it to you amen and then when you see it that way you can't unsee it and when you see it that way that's all you see you don't see the little scribblies anymore they're not even there I mean if you really tried hard but when you look at it every time I see one of those now I look at it all I see is Jesus right no matter where it is who's got it or if you don't see them very much anymore that's all I see is Jesus now because it was revealed to me when God reveals something to you that's the way it comes to you that's the way it is it becomes part of you you can't see it and when God reveals it like that you become a part of it it becomes a part of you well when the Lord when he ripped the uh the cover of the scripture and and and a man that God coming in man forming this last day that God could use to bring that word to a bride and that revelation of that word come out of there to each individual that would receive it it becomes a part of you the word becomes a part of you just as much as the Holy Spirit are you born again you have the Holy Ghost well that is just as much a part of you as that as that spirit is and that word comes in it makes it live with God is living in you if God is growing in you if God is becoming more manifest in your life less of me more of him my brother Noah was saying last week blessed me more of him you become that word well that's the only way God's gonna marry you is if you're the word because he's the word and the word's not going to marry a reprobate the word's going to marry the word that's why the bride has become the worst she has become him one with him praise the Lord for together as husband and wife together with him praise the Lord one entity Jesus come the second time you come into physical form claim his own they'll be about a thousand years Millennium Reign upon the Earth with him with the redeemed now that's the Millennium reigned upon the Earth with the Lord now the second invisible Union he said but we are enthused about it and we know that history is closing out the world's history will soon be over then when now that was 1965. so if it was if he said the world's history is closing out the world will soon be over 50 almost 57 years ago where are we now amen I'm not that good at math it's like I told you I was born 20 days after this was said so it's easy math for me because I as long as I remember how old I am uh I can remember that so almost 57 years now how much closer are we now than we were then we're going to step into a new day to the great Millennium that as one believer I believe in the Millennium a millennium reign with Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth the physical Return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical body glorified by his cleansing blood amen that's word this bride is going after the wedding suffered now if we get to the Earth let's get to the time here that that that we're living here upon this Earth because after again after the end of the tribulation at the end there will be that battle of Armageddon and we know that's scripture so let's go read that if we could Revelation chapter 16. Revelation chapter 16. amen even the two witnesses of Revelation 11 are killed their bodies lay in the street for three days people coming by making fun talking laughing amen but on that third day those two dead bodies in the middle of the street who raise up and brought to life and go in Rapture remember that's our our last Rapture the third Rapture of this New Testament is those two witnesses they raise up from the dead of a Rapture right in front of everybody but it's like brother van said even the scripture says though they do a miracle before your eyes you won't believe if you do the point of it is there's nothing there too to believe if there's nothing in you to believe if you've if you've turned your back from it and you you declare you don't believe and if you're an unbeliever there's nothing in you to see it there's nothing in you to believe though one raised from the dead amen they still don't believe it but look Revelation 16 and I want to spend the rest of my time just here on this Armageddon I thought I'd have time to maybe get into the Millennium that's why I read those two quotes but time gets by fast so we'll just we'll we'll start getting into this Armageddon now and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast so it starts with the Devil comes out of the mouth of the Dragon Satan comes out of the mouth of the Beast we know as the office of the Pope and out of the mouth of the false prophet which I don't know that false prophet of that false prophet of that mouth those three unclean spirits all those unclean spirits notice now are coming out of their mouths those three unclean spirits like frogs these devils and men like frogs come out of their mouths three of them and they are the spirits of devils amen working miracles working miracles how do they work miracles they do it within because Satan knows remember Satan was Lucifer Lucifer worked within the confines of the spirit that God has that the economy that God has placed us in and we know that the spirit of God is around the world the spirit of God moves anybody that's able to tap into it can operate in no matter who they are Devils demons you know brother Graham talked about it going over and seeing which doctor speak in tongues stick a sword through them and not bleed a drop pull it out look through not even believe see a pencil stand up by itself and write in an unknown tone well how does that happen working those Miracles hasn't happened they found a way to tap in through the inspiration of Lucifer who brother Brown said was God's right hand man at one time amen angel of Light to to tap into what he knew God had created in the in the economy of God that anointing is there for anybody anybody can tap into that anointing if they just will believe it anybody can how do you think an atheist gets healed they didn't pray to God to ask him to heal them amen medicine didn't heal them because God's the Healer God's the only one that can heal well how'd they get healed well have you have to tap into that that's kind of a low level of it but you have to tap into that's economy God's put us in this world today anybody Taps into that can be the beneficiary of that of that spirit and they all have been today they are here working miracles well if you don't have a revelation those things will deceive you if you don't have the Holy Ghost in a revelation of the word of the hour those things will deceive you and it deceives the greater portion of the world who look upon that and say oh wow that's fantastic but then where are their lives you say well they they perform miracles but if if the if the Miracles are coming out of the devil what good is it is that God if they've tapped into even operating in the gifts of spirit what good is it if God's Not There or do they believe the word do they live the word are they are are they uh born again check their lives see if they be of God if that if they live and are just basically as ungodly as the rest of the world it don't matter what gift they tapped into that's of the devil amen it's something because it's not operating in the in the inspiration of the of the perfect will of God God operates within his perfect will through his children to produce what he wants not what I want but man and Satan operates in that same capacity to work through people to bring about his devilish ends to deceive people and these working of Miracles is a deception to the world it looks just like the genuine but it's not they can perform a miracle but the minute they deny the word they're not of God Amen The Witch of Endor was able to call up Samuel yes but was that a work of God oh that was a miracle but it wasn't a work of God he even came out and said why in the world are you disturbing my rest that wasn't a work of God his demonic Powers working in that same capacity but to their own ends what God does is he works it to the end to his End Amen and his end is for our good praise the Lord so we that so that's what we want that's why we know that when God worked through that Vindicated prophet that when all the Miracles all the discernments all those things perfect right on the money absolutely but the thing that solidifies it to the bride it's not the Miracles it's not the discernment it's not the calling people out it's not the uh the the seeing the demons it's not telling them where their address was it was the word the purity of the righteousness and the truth of the revealed word of the hours what settled that profit into the office of who he was not the Miracles amen those were just to catch the eyes of the people praise the Lord that God could work with them so you see that these Miracles yeah tap into that Spirit they work these miracles they're but they're the spirit of devils working miracles which go forth in the 14th verse till now which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty just like it tells us Malachi 4. the great and Dreadful day of who of the lord well who is allowing this to orchestrate itself to come to pass well God is he's in control of all of it he's allowing it to happen it's the great day of God almighty again Malachi 4 tells us it would be keys and the whole Earth how could the whole earth you think a hundred years ago how could the whole earth have come to this place couldn't happen but today with the with the invention of of cars and airplanes and and internet and social media and and and and all of those things that happen and integrate together through this great web as they call it um all come together the whole world can be won within two seconds you could talk to somebody in London England Amen in two seconds you could talk to anybody in China as long as they've got the same apparatus that you have amen all these things we carry around all the time you could in two seconds you could talk to somebody in China you could talk to somebody in New York I could talk to my wife and well sometimes it takes her a while to respond but uh usually I can talk to my wife within a second from Minnesota to here just in a second tap tap tap hit that button and all of a sudden you see it there it is hun today that's why it's all come together the way it has that's why all the development all the technology I'll look back and think you are we better now than we were 50 years ago are we better now than we were 100 years ago I say no but we're closer Home amen but it all comes all these things that are detriments all becomes and works in the hand of God to bring this all together amen you could uh tap on this phone and you can instantly see something that's happening over in across in Australia in an instant you can tap on this little bitty box it's something going on in Australia that's how this whole world remember this is a fulfilling of scriptures things this world the kings of the earth and of the whole world they're all coming together because they're all inspired under the same auspice they're all inspired this Dragon this Beast this false prophet all inspired together to the battle to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty behold I come as a thief blessed is ye which watch and keepeth his garments lest he Walt naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together he who God gather them together um unto or the the Beast excuse me gather them all together because this is the world here now God gathers his children Satan gathers his the Dragon the Satan the dragon gathers them all together in a place called the Hebrew tongue Armageddon God is gathering his children together but it's not Armageddon he's Gathering his children together under Jesus Christ amen amen to soon go home but Satan the dragon is gathering his together that is called to this place called Armageddon amen now in this that God has uh this great battle now remember where did this battle start this battle did not start in Israel this battle did not start in Tucson this battle did not start frankly anywhere on this planet this battle started in heaven you believe that go read Revelation 12. it'll tell you where this battle started or this great Dragon drew a third of the angels of the stars of heaven with his tail with his lies and Drew them down and they were all cast on the Earth and now for how many years Gathering them all together to bring them to this place of Armageddon at one point God wiped them all off the Earth but now he brought now they've all come back together sin unbelief through the through Noah's Ark we all know that that ombudi came through the arm and from that time what Gathering them all together is bringing them all together Satan all his children all his followers and Believers to this place this battle the battle now to wind it up it started in heaven but now it's about to get finished amen I remember when I was a kid probably a crude saved but it used to be when I was a kid in high school the the saying was uh when there was a something going on a disagreement or something or get married to fight you say well he started it but I'm about to finish it probably never heard that amen he started it but I'm about to finish it Satan started it but God's about to finish yeah amen he's Gathering them all there to Armageddon and he's bringing them all together now let me read you uh let me read you something that Armageddon now if you look it up you see the definition that Armageddon is the hill or city of megiddo which is just really if you look on a map uh is is almost perfectly due north from Jerusalem it's in Israel it's in the land of Israel mogito's in the land of Israel again all these major things the city we're talking about a word Abraham met Melchizedek God sent Abraham out to go find this land to inhabit this land all this is in that exact same spot exact same spot this is the exact same spot Armageddon that land that place there the land of megiddo Armageddon the hill or city of megiddo now let me reach you hear a couple things I've got now brother Brandon said thy house this is 1961. he said now the Bible predicts that in the last days there will be a a trap because I want to talk about those three unclean spirits for a little bit amen those three unclean spirits now the Bible predicts in the last days that he will trap Catholicism romanism and all these things them cannot uh communism and all them together in the valley of megiddo there you were just talking about it again trap them bring them all together until there will be such a Slaughter amongst them until the blood will flow to the horse's bit Bridal and we know that will be a purging time for even the foolish virgin will be purged they'll have to sacrifice their lives for the testimony of Jesus Christ amen they seal their testimony with their own blood we steal our testimony with his blood they have to seal their testimony with their own blood in in the tribulation such a great Slaughter there that it'll be to the blood the blood will flow to the horse's bridle in Revelation we know that but thanks be to the heavenly father we will not be here by his grace we won't we'll be in glory see that will be right after the two prophets is prophesied in the battle of Armageddon and he's talking about Revelation 11. that's when these Gentile Nations uh get so wicked just keep on Confederation of churches all this comes together um we'll take the church the elect Church home the bride out of everyone and all the Sleeping virgin will remain will still be here amen that come out of Revelations come out of the mouth of the false prophet the dragon and the Beast as we know now we're going to get to that in our study now these three unclean spirits which we probably already know again I'm not I'm not bringing you anything new we're just getting to that place of the new beginning scene uh the three unclean spirits is that is those three isms let me type that out for you now he said where it started where it begun see there was communism Fascism and Nazism they were the spirits that's the three spirits that came out of their's mouths came out of their mouths as unclean frogs spirits of devils amen that's the three Spirits communism Fascism and Nazism they were Spirits communism is a spirit of course brother Brandon hid a lot on communism because in the 60s communism was a a big thing in this country everybody fought tooth and nail to try to get away from it that seems like a lot of people are fighting tooth and they'll giving their lives for us to try to go back into it amen but we know that's where it's all going to end up anyway but it's but it actually it all ends up in Catholicism that's where it all acts ends up now communism we know is is a a power grab it's it's a controlling it's the thought that uh and and I guess if you look at it in a certain way that it it is it is sort of um utopian to think communism doesn't work as the government never has uh even the Soviet Union collapse but it's the thought of probably utopianism to bring everybody up to exactly the same place they call it equity um the problem is in Satan's Eden is that those people that have worked to achieve who have actually worked harder to achieve more have to come down for to meet the people that just hadn't worked and don't care and made me lazy I don't know to try to find some equality the whole point of Communism though it's a nationality thing is that there's a headship or a government or a entity that controls all of it that tells everybody this is what it's going to be this is what we have to do to make you come down to here and this person come up here so that you're all on the same plane oh it sounds wonderful sounds like Utopia it'll be that way when we get on the other side and uh all of God's children in God's mind because God has no respecter or person in God's mind straight across everybody everybody's saying nobody's different nobody's higher lower nobody has more money less money nobody has more cars more houses amen it's just all the same but in in in Satan's Eden it does not work because you have to have those people that are harder working probably even smarter to to create things to help people that maybe aren't quite as diligent as working hard or as smart for whatever reason and but again there's a theme to it that that there's the control that's the whole thing the equality is one thing it's the control who's going to be the control to say this is the way it's going to be yeah this is how this has got to be to have you and to have you and to bring everything to take control over it all not with the heart of the people that that's the big problem they don't have the heart of the people they have the heart of their own purpose amen and their own prosperity and heart not of the people so when they talk about equality they don't care really what happens to the people they just want it to sound good look good so that they stay in power that's communism in a nutshell now Fascism and Nazism are basically the same because Nazism is really just a form of of fascism which basically just is just a dictator controlling everybody and calm the shots and saying this and and and the similarities there now are the fact of what communism does and the power they have to control everybody and what not uh fascism does in the same sense is Con control everything and everybody by one person that's why Nazism was a form of fascism because Hitler did that talked about the Jews all the time and everything that Hitler did but people a lot of times forget that Hitler killed his own people Hitler killed Germans he considered him pure Hitler sterilized people who had impurities in their lives or if you just had an impediment a stuttering or something he would have he would have neutered Moses because he was unpure Moses could have never reproduced because he was on pure he had a speech impediment anybody with any kind of any kind of impediment was considered impure and was either a a sterilized or or murdered killed one of the others his own people not just Jews anybody that was his thought that's why Nazism was so popular and as long as you're one of the ones considered pure it's great if you're one of the ones that have any kind of impediment it's not so great amen your life is controlled destroyed killed burned whatever it is that's how they control people the three unclean frogs that came out of their mouths I keep emphasizing that because I want to get to something here in just a minute I know I'm late but just a minute coming out of their mouths these three frogs come out of each one of their mouths look where it's going back and all of it winds up back in communism or excuse me in Catholicism all of it does because we know who controls it the Beast does you can have your communism you can have your Nazism you can have your fascism all socialism whatever it is but it's all controlled by that Beast who is controlled by that dragon so that's where it all comes to it goes to the office of the Beast mine all winds up it all winds up and that's where brother Brandon gets to now but these three Spirits communism fascism Nazism he said that brought out many years ago told you it'd be that thing that would take place while all wind up in communism all of it will wind up in communism that's the three unclean spirits that set the whole world to Armageddon the unclean Spirit now in the fourth seal let me read this real quick notice uh what is he coming to look at what all this I'm kind of skipping some so please forgive me um what's it all coming to it's coming to the End Time battle the first thing heaven was about amen like we said Lucifer was kicked out come to Earth he polluted Eden and and there's those things that's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven is coming to a battle on Earth it has to be finished on the earth at the end time of the battle called Armageddon Armageddon now there's that arm again is that place where they all come and there's that great Slaughter Satan Gathering all of his people together and out of the mouths of these people this Beast the the dragon is coming those three unclean spirits but I want us to turn to Revelation 19. I'm going to try to finish this here I have to skip a couple things but revelation 19. Satan is gathering his prop together from the four corners of the earth just like God does amen just like remember everything Satan does is nothing but a a a a a copy of what God does back in the Garden of Eden Satan told them or God told them that the serpent would bruise the heel of the woman's seed Jesus Christ he's always on his heel always copy uh trying to write off the back up that's why there's three unclean spirits like frog just three well that's God's number Satan's just copying it everything he does he does to copy what God does and in a lot of ways again those two come so close together that people won't know the difference unless you have the Holy Ghost they just won't know it's that deceiving it deceives the very elective positive impossible thank God it's not possible Revelation 19 we know this scripture very well um let's start with verse 11. and I saw heaven open John the Revelator now saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteous he does judge and make war now this is obviously in contrast to Revelation 6 and the White Horse comes forth and him conquering and to conquer that Satan this is not Satan the impurity of the hypocrisy of of Satan trying to present himself as pure through the Beast remember when the Beast is out and open he's always wearing white he always comes out to the general public in white he rides in his little poke mobile he's all white when he comes and stands out in the Basilica he's always always in white amen when he goes behind doors that's a different story he's got red and he's got black but this Y is the hypocrisy of trying to present himself as pure and holy but now God coming forth on a white horse is called faithful true and in righteousness he's not judge and make war that's not Satan that's God that's Jesus Christ his eyes was a flame of fire you're gonna read Revelation one you see that's Jesus and on his head were many crowns or diadems and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God amen amen the other one it was death and Hell Followed him right this one is the word of God because Satan's Trinity is death hell in the grave praise the Lord which of course the hell Hades is the grave uh and and that always follows to humanity it always follows the grave when he came into Power this Earth that's what he implemented Satan implemented death death came on humans because God said it would and he took that death and put a human in the grave back to the dust from once they came 80s amen that's his Trinity God is the word amen and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven praise the Lord look around you see a little bit of that Army amen a little bit of the Army's right here this morning amen the armies of Heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean praise God because she's the bride she is his wife and he is proud of her he wants to show his bride off to anybody and everybody because he loves her and he's proud of her God is proud of you Saints God loves you you're a part of that Army you're a part of the ones in heaven here that come out white horses with him clean and white and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword now what goes out of his mouth amen not devils not unclean frogs not unclean spirits but the word of God comes out of his mouth a short sword going forth out of his mouth you can go and find this in Revelation 1 20. you can find it in second Thessalonians 2 8 and you can find it Revelation 1 16. it's the same thing the sword of God the sword of the word comes out of his mouth that's how God always remember brother Noel said last week that's what God actually fights his battles with we always like to talk about giving the devil a black eye but it's not with this thing it's with the word that's what gives him the black eye Satan fears your mere presence because you are the word walking in shoe leather and he knows that's the only thing that'll defeat him is the word praise the Lord don't let it Satan make you look at your mirror and think that you're some kind of something that you're not you look at God's mirror and you know who you are because that's what God has made you and God don't make any junk amen God made you as a son and daughter of God Purity and righteousness of God himself amen and now the sword Goes Forth that within should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of uh with a rod of iron now that's over in the new city that's not here that's a dual purpose scripture because if you go over we'll see we'll get to it we'll get to that city you'll see this is over in the new city he rules them with the rod of iron and he treaded The Wine Press of the fears of the wrath of almighty God and he had his best friend on his thigh named written king of kings and Lord of lords praise the Lord God himself they battled Armageddon they gather an Armageddon they battle at Armageddon the blood runs through just like the wash going down on a a on a stormy Monsoon afternoon that water that we see in those washers will flood right through but it'll be blood up to the horse's bridle it'll be so bad it'll be so murderous but God comes and with the sword of the word he destroys them all he ends the battle he ends the fight right there at that place Armageddon God stops it all he comes on a white horse with the armies of Heaven A White Horse behind him and the word coming forth out of his mouth he doesn't use Spears and swords and bombs and and guns and knives he uses the word the word is what destroys the word is what puts them in their in their place to the point that I saw an angel standing in the sun cry with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather your souls together unto the supper of the great God that ye may eat the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains and the Flesh of Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the Flesh of men both free bonds small and great amen battle is over God is Victorious God wins over all of it and he has to because we're getting because that that end of the the end of the Armageddon sets the stage for Christ to come back now in a Corporal body back with his glorified body back with his bride here on this Earth from for a millennium reign of a thousand years amen we leave here we meet him in the air we've spent three and a half years at a wedding supper we go to the Palace God takes cure uh business with the Jews and we come back with him on white horses and we stand Victorious here through a Thousand-Year malane a millennium reign God breaking the curse of the original sin finally and for all we're one man we're men not just one but any man any person any human lives on this Earth for one thousand years for one full day with God it never happened since the fall Millennium came the closest 969 years but there hasn't been one single human live recorded scripture has not lived one day with God amen 1000 years that'll break the curse of the original sin that broke that man in his eternal life in the beginning it'll be shattered and broken and done away with God and his bride will live here for a thousand years Satan will be bound a thousand years will have no sense for them amen let's stand if we could praise the Lord amen I believe that no God comes forth with his weapon of choice and that's the word of God Satan comes with his and that's the perversion of the word but God's the one that takes control over the whole thing amen by his word through his spirit he does it all for our betterment amen because he loves us right so that's why I give his life for us that's why he was willing to spend the last moments of his life in pure agony because he loves us so much you think about that think about it as a human is there anybody on this planet Earth that you know that you would do that for amen it's a hard question a lot of people would jump and say oh I do it do it before I do it for mature but you know when it comes right down to it just like Jesus and the garden gets anything and his sweat became ass drops of blood he sweated it out he fought it out all those demons coming around and he fought it out remember brother brother green even pointed out I don't know what I've never been there but that Jesus even to get there had to cross over that trough for Channel or whatever it was where all the sacrifices that were sacrificed up by the Jews had all that blood had to run right down through there and just the father it's not scripture but one of brother Green's analogies and Jesus had he had to go that path Jesus had to go that path and go over that blood you imagine what what may have gone through a human Jesus mind and he saw that and recognizing the great sacrifice that he was amen when he comes right down to it Saints amen it is a it is a bit harder than probably a lot of people think but it's it's a lot of it's a it's in a lot of ways like people oh if if I won the lottery I the first thing I do is pay my tithes I I do this and I do that as you don't know what you do until it happens and then of course something great happens or good happens or something and you never see them again don't mean that the bad way amen that's just the way it's just the way it happens so many times I guess it's the it's the Rubber meets the road analogy when it comes right down to it only God knows amen even we don't even know ourselves praise the Lord let's sing this course um I want to live the way he wants me to live and we've seen that to him now see it with all of our hearts here that's just that that's your desire is 493 in the songbook I don't know what I think we all do but 493 I want to live the way he wants me to live praise the Lord and God knows if that's your real desire or not see the Bible says I want to live it doesn't say I am living because that's in my human flesh I don't know if I'll ever live the way I want to live but I know through him knows my heart in what I want to do what my desire is amen yes [Music] I want to love love to you there's just no no more love oh I could never ever [Music] until there's just [Music] way to him now going to live away he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to hear I'm going to love love till there's just no more love oh I could ever ever [Music] and and praise the Lord Jesus I trust believe that's all our desires today amen praise the Lord I'm going to live I desire to live the way he wants me to live amen not the way I want to live all that he does he does it for his purpose but all his purpose works together for our good and so we should want the exact same thing but regardless I want what he wants and if I can do whatever I can do to help make that happen more to help me amen praise the Lord be so good he isn't he hey man thank you thank you amen appreciate you love and prayers amen appreciate you coming today being in the house of the Lord if you're streaming God bless you amen like I said it was a pretty rough week I was kind of tired this week tired yesterday uh I even woke up Friday morning and they I had a hard time getting up Friday morning I went and
