[2:20] [Music]
[3:43] morning things have said that in a while
[3:46] I mean a good morning part since we've
[3:49] had evening service systems we've
[3:51] started the church here for past four
[3:54] years or so now a little over four years
[3:56] but good morning to you welcome to the
[3:59] first church service live we've had it
[4:02] in three months hard to believe some in
[4:05] some ways it seems like it's been longer
[4:07] than that in some ways it seems like
[4:09] shorter but very thankful to be back in
[4:12] the house of the Lord again and you know
[4:14] everywhere that God has two or three or
[4:16] gathered I consider the house of the
[4:17] Lord so I believe there's more than that
[4:20] of us here today all as obvious you can
[4:23] see there's still little kinks and
[4:26] things we have to work out to get this
[4:29] or we'd like it to be not that we're
[4:32] gonna be here forever I just
[4:34] Lord willing plan on having this little
[4:36] place here is a temporary place for us
[4:39] just maybe for a few weeks he with the
[4:41] Lord supplies when I felt the Lord to
[4:46] try to find something that we could
[4:48] definitely have this is the first place
[4:51] the Lord brought woman was here I felt
[4:54] to come over here and this was with all
[4:58] the hotels here this is the first place
[5:00] - Lord sent me - I went to the other
[5:02] hotels but there wasn't anything there
[5:05] there was a process Jean at the Days Inn
[5:08] there was a much smaller a little about
[5:12] half the size of this room and it was
[5:15] 150 dollars
[5:17] so that didn't work the sizes or the
[5:21] price really we could have made the
[5:23] price but the size just wasn't going to
[5:25] work and went to the Red Roof down here
[5:28] and they weren't renting theirs out so
[5:31] anyway just this the first place that
[5:33] came was the place that the Lord wanted
[5:35] us so here we are
[5:37] thank thankful to the Lord for that
[5:39] they've been looking diligently at
[5:40] places around around town trying to find
[5:44] something that would soon and would work
[5:47] in a good area and the price range and
[5:50] everything and something more permanent
[5:52] I'm figuring if the Lord's moved us out
[5:54] of the place we were then there's got to
[5:57] be something more permanent something
[5:59] that he wants us to be in that's going
[6:02] to be ours so that's kind of that's
[6:05] really what my aim and goal is I've had
[6:08] a couple of suggestions of other
[6:09] churches to maybe rent to us take their
[6:12] facility when off times but under the
[6:17] current circumstances we can do that and
[6:20] that that would be fine I just you know
[6:23] we've been doing that for four years I
[6:25] just feel like if we're moving on then
[6:27] let's just move on and move to a place
[6:30] again that's more permanent and the
[6:32] place that we can call ours we can set
[6:35] things up the way we'll want them and
[6:36] just have them that way and to be a
[6:38] church obese just for us we come in
[6:41] there and just
[6:44] everything that happens the spirits and
[6:46] also just be a different situation
[6:48] scenario so but I'm very happy and
[6:50] thankful to be here today trying to give
[6:52] Michael a little time to play with the
[6:54] piano over there appreciate exactly
[6:57] Tabitha bringing their piano here but
[6:59] Zack didn't warn me a couple of key
[7:01] stuck so Micah's trying to work on that
[7:04] a little bit but we're thankful to be
[7:05] here today
[7:06] appreciate the Lord's blessings to us
[7:08] let's just stand to our feet we'll open
[7:13] our service in prayer just invite the
[7:16] president's Lord Jesus having this
[7:18] service as I wrote to you yesterday in
[7:21] faith trust the Lord is gonna bless us
[7:23] to be with us and comfort us I have some
[7:27] I want to say but I want to say it
[7:29] during the message so and then for those
[7:33] who are watching and streaming and those
[7:35] who may get this that are a part of our
[7:37] congregation I have Mike to turn the
[7:40] cameras off I got some personally I want
[7:42] to talk to you about that I do not want
[7:45] to be on YouTube or the internet or for
[7:48] anyone else to hear but because I
[7:51] believe it's a word the Lord gave for me
[7:53] to you so I'm gonna record it for those
[7:56] who aren't here today for them to be
[7:59] able to get a copy but the Lord willing
[8:03] towards the end here so let's just bow
[8:06] our heads now if we could by his
[8:08] presence Lord Jesus father we're very
[8:11] thankful God again and lord did you give
[8:14] us a place to come that you give us a
[8:16] place to assemble a place that we call a
[8:19] church a place that we can come in out
[8:21] in the world and we can gather together
[8:23] more with those of like precious faith
[8:25] as you admonished us even that

[11:14] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[11:16] pray amen god bless you it can be seated
[11:21] if you'd like and we just have a few
[11:23] songs song service we won't be too long
[11:26] this morning the Lord willing but we do
[11:28] what we also want to be obedient to the
[11:30] Lord and what the Lord has for us today
[11:32] so amen let's turn over in song number
[11:40] 426
[11:43] I've had a textbook that said they're
[11:46] getting sound with no video even we're
[11:52] trying to stream this - I mean there's
[11:55] quite a few people that weren't going to
[11:56] be able to make it this morning so we
[11:58] want him to continue to stream that and
[12:00] wanted to also give the levity to those
[12:02] who didn't feel like they should be in a
[12:05] group of people yet you know I think the
[12:08] I think one of the worst things that
[12:09] would come of this situation like I said
[12:11] in my last message and please I
[12:14] apologize for not having a midweek
[12:16] sermon this week but the one previous
[12:19] you know the devil could use this to try
[12:22] to drive a wedge and to bring
[12:25] differences into dis unifying God's
[12:28] people and try to make it dis against
[12:31] that and if you don't do this you don't
[12:33] do that and you know the worst thing you
[12:35] can do is is for those who and I'm just
[12:38] gonna say it bluntly but for those who
[12:40] wear masks to look down on the people
[12:42] that don't and for those who don't
[12:45] [Music]
[13:02] [Music]
[13:25] I thought it would be more comfortable
[14:15] to you as a group at least the majority
[14:18] would just continue to screaming so we
[14:20] just found a good compromise we got a
[14:22] place where and we're streaming so god
[14:24] bless you on the streaming in gov su 491
[14:27] let's turn over there amen
[14:30] so glad to be together at the end day
[14:33] then Lord knows how much the little
[14:36] folks
[14:40] [Music]
[14:44] one homelessness a great expectation
[14:50] [Music]
[15:46] Purcell monster trade of me
[15:56] [Music]
[17:15] back to the top down
[17:20] [Music]
[18:08] amen when I came in at first all this
[18:12] place and I saw the lectern s will raise
[18:14] the Lord I have a little bit more of a
[18:16] full head like but I thought there'd be
[18:18] a shelf here there's nothing to put
[18:20] anything on and I haven't sang like this
[18:22] for a while so forgive me
[18:29] but I'm worshiping the Lord a man 361
[18:33] appreciated roses 361 and we'll see this
[18:37] one more before we go to the Lord in
[18:39] prayer we bring the sacrifice of praise
[18:49] amen
[18:50] we bring that sacrifice of praise
[18:54] I got challenged one time about with
[18:56] somebody about the Old Testament New
[18:58] Testament oh we don't go by the Old
[19:00] Testament I said I absolutely do simple
[19:04] do you still sacrifice us in absolutely
[19:06] every time I wake up I sacrifice praise
[19:09] to the Lord every day I don't take an
[19:11] animal and slit his throat down two
[19:12] thousand square but I worship the Lord
[19:15] and offer up my sacrifice to praise the
[19:17] Lord Jesus amen that's what we come here
[19:20] to do today let's see it
[19:32] [Music]
[22:13] and the Roberts had quite a emotional
[22:17] physical drain and it's real need a
[22:22] prayer so please remember whether Robert
[22:24] I considered brother Robert Robert and
[22:27] brother Dana men of God yes and love
[22:30] them
[22:30] hold him up and not bending Roberts
[22:33] handful of times to preach for him and I
[22:35] wanted to have him up here sometime had
[22:38] had got to that point yet but just
[22:40] please remember him in prayer if you
[22:42] would also that request a prayer from
[22:47] brother angel angel had let me know last
[22:52] night in Priscilla that there her sister
[22:57] tested positive for Kovac 19 last night
[23:00] and they had been around her sister and
[23:04] they have been around the family and
[23:07] things like that so it doesn't mean they
[23:09] contracted it but they decided to stay
[23:11] home as a result today so please
[23:13] remember them in prayer probably now
[23:16] they're going to be tested as a result
[23:19] so please remember that family and
[23:21] prayers angel that ask that request
[23:24] prayer for their whole family and of
[23:27] course for his immediate family I think
[23:30] I'll just read this part but he said I'm
[23:32] also asking prayer for my family because
[23:34] we are being attacked by the enemy and I
[23:37] want the enemy to leave and provide to
[23:39] fill our home entirely with him alone
[23:41] I'm also asking prayer for God to help
[23:43] my children during these trying times to
[23:46] fill them and sealed it with the with
[23:48] the taupe and the Holy Ghost I'm also
[23:50] asking God to bring each one of them
[23:52] closer to him and make them in the
[23:54] likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ also
[23:56] restore their peace and love in their
[23:58] hearts he said the reason I'm asking is
[24:02] the enemy is physically showing himself
[24:04] and letting his presence known and it
[24:06] was affecting every
[24:08] so they're also well today
[24:43] to deal with the pain and now she
[24:45] doesn't have it and she's just in bed
[24:47] constantly for the last 2 or 3 days that
[24:50] she's been home and she's just in
[24:52] tremendous pain so he decided to save
[24:54] the day to take care of her
[24:56] god bless him and we need to pray for
[25:00] him he's a new Christian when he was we
[25:05] meet at the patio at the housing complex
[25:08] where we are and the Lord when we pray
[25:13] for him my friend Dominic is a the Holy
[25:20] Spirit gallery and and so the Holy
[25:33] Spirit Archie came on Derrick and you
[25:35] could see his chest flush and he just
[25:37] something like just flew out and he just
[25:40] and he just and so he you know he's been
[25:43] serving God I got him a mobile Bible and
[25:46] he can he wanted to come this morning
[25:48] but he he was being faithful to his
[25:50] mother so there's a lot of pain there we
[25:53] need to pray for him he's gone back to
[25:55] smoking cigarettes out left in one
[25:59] but back to smoking and I realized
[26:02] there's a problems there that we need to
[26:05] pray for him to even that I think it
[26:07] calms him down and he needs a lot of
[26:10] calming down and so he walks a lot to
[26:13] try to get rid of the excess energy so I
[26:15] think that's the reason he does it so
[26:17] his so we just need to pray for him he's
[26:21] got neurological issues so I asked him
[26:27] today and for them
[26:34] it's good to have you go by Dom or
[26:36] Dominic okay well come over there the
[26:40] other day to see you but really but it's

[34:28] but when we get to the other side oh my
[34:30] you know I just said and thinking and
[34:35] studying on the message today yesterday
[34:37] and just something hit me I started to
[34:40] get a glimpse than the thought of you
[34:43] know because I believe if we get on the
[34:44] other side it's gonna be the hardest is
[34:46] I got and God loves his children he
[34:48] wants to give their hearts desire and
[34:51] you know he said if we delight ourselves
[34:53] in him he would give us our heart's
[34:54] desire and believe more so we get on the
[34:56] other side and I started getting a
[34:58] glimpse of what it might what what my
[35:01] cabin my place of abode or whatever you
[35:05] want to call it and that new cities
[35:06] gonna look like and you know what made
[35:08] me think about when brother Branham used
[35:11] to talk about me
[35:12] we've got his little cabin down by the
[35:14] river and he says you hear him singing
[35:16] about the blood of Jesus or something he
[35:18] said old brother bill made it and
[35:20] marries the Lord you can do the same
[35:22] again it just comes in such plain view
[35:25] to think all what a day it'll be what a
[35:28] place it is the Lord has already said
[35:30] he's prepared for us amen
[35:33] that wonderful place praise the Lord
[35:35] Jesus anyone have a quick testimony now
[35:37] real quick now in just a couple minutes
[35:39] I don't want to be too long today we
[35:41] only have a certain length of time
[35:43] room two so a man just yes sister
[35:46] mentees well those of you who have seen
[35:49] bright Hill if you're watching online I
[35:53] know any Joel and Priscilla have seen it
[35:55] that one the bride has no I yes day
[36:02] before yesterday I went Friday excuse me
[36:05] was about two or three days ago I went
[36:08] to a stop sign it's free and in the
[36:10] afternoon and I just happened to look at
[36:13] Brian Hale it was on Nikki and I think
[36:16] it was a Latoya and I happen to look
[36:18] over and her eye was open God gave her
[36:21] an eye there's never been an eye there
[36:24] and it was flaming it was one eye it was
[36:28] open the bride is a week and her eye was
[36:32] flaming like brother branham's eyes were
[36:34] flaming when he went up that Matthew
[36:36] told Billy Paul this is the hour I've
[36:38] told you about this this is it and there
[36:41] it was like this there's white
[36:42] formations underneath her nostrils I've
[36:44] never seen them before and it looked
[36:46] like white mucus coming out of her nose
[36:48] and I realized the talk with Tom about
[36:52] this and I realized this is the seal of
[36:54] the hour that the Holy Spirit in us
[36:57] bringing us to repentance looking for
[37:01] that last little piece under the bed
[37:03] sweeping the house looking for it
[37:05] everywhere that we can this is not a
[37:08] time to be playing praise the Lord
[37:14] that's some true things we're going home
[37:17] maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe next
[37:20] week maybe next year maybe ten years
[37:22] from now but we're going home ready to
[37:24] go home
[37:24] amen do you want to else real quick I
[37:28] don't but I mean we've been going

[37:34] thought maybe you have if you have
[37:35] something to share I don't want to stop

[37:38] daddy knows but my car has been a little
[37:41] past I have a check engine light on got
[37:46] a hole puncher like $3,500 with the
[37:48] repairs done to it and now about six
[37:52] months nine months later the lights on
[37:55] lights are flashing on the dashboard my
[37:58] tire was flat and all kinds of stuff
[38:00] going on
[38:01] I want to thank God for holding the tire
[38:03] up I waited too long to get new tires
[38:05] but I was waiting for finances to do so
[38:07] but it would get down to life
[38:10] flat flat and tire was falling apart
[38:13] there was no tread left but the Lord
[38:15] kept it good enough to where I could
[38:17] drive to the gas station pump it up and
[38:19] then keep going about my day coming to
[38:21] church and going to their house for
[38:22] streaming and whatnot and the engine
[38:26] light will come on and I'll just review
[38:28] kit and then go and then five days later

[39:22] else Amen god bless you today again
[39:29] welcome you appreciate your being here
[39:31] today we're going to stand to our feet
[39:33] now and go to the Word of God turn our
[39:40] Bibles if you would with me to Genesis
[39:43] chapter 3 I had mentioned to you on one
[39:47] of the videos excuse me there's so many
[39:48] of that just running together the stream
[39:50] in the ones who did it like this
[39:52] the midweeks someone kind of run
[39:54] together that I've mentioned to you that
[39:56] I was going to plan when we started
[39:58] meeting live like this again to continue
[40:00] on the crisis of mystery God to reveal
[40:02] to the mysteries of God in Christ as I
[40:04] titled it and I wanted to continue
[40:07] forward from that from the revelation
[40:08] point that we had talked about the last
[40:11] message we spill spoke on that but the
[40:14] other day in prayer
[40:15] I felt really compelled to bring this
[40:19] message today so we all know who the
[40:24] enemy is
[40:25] tactus the enemy reminding us of the
[40:28] tactics of the enemy and so I want to
[40:31] approach that thought today if we could
[40:34] you know it just it's a subject that's
[40:37] very felt very seldom ever talked about
[40:40] but Lord willing we'll just get into it
[40:44] here but this let's bow our heads for
[40:46] word of prayer there before we before
[40:48] read the Word of God Lord Jesus we thank
[40:50] you Father
[40:51] I feel so inspired of a heart right now
[40:54] Lord and just ready to bring this word
[40:57] you gave to me and Lord to give to your
[40:59] people and just trust that your Holy
[41:01] Spirit is going to speak through these
[41:02] lips the words you have us to hear Lord
[41:05] let it fall into of each one of our
[41:06] hearts Lord God believing that this
[41:09] truth of your word Lord comes to us to
[41:11] recognize the day and the hour that we
[41:13] live there's a lot going on father
[41:15] there's a lot of disruption there's a
[41:17] lot of disturbance there's a lot of need
[41:19] Lord there's not of there's a lot of
[41:22] people in the Father we're just
[41:24] believing that God you're going to speak
[41:27] to us and help us recognize the truth in
[41:29] your word Lord of where we are in that
[41:32] word of what part we play in that word
[41:33] of what it means to us God Lord I'm
[41:36] thankful father for these that have come
[41:38] today I'm very thankful for those that
[41:40] are streaming Lord and watching and and
[41:42] I'm appreciative too for those who will
[41:44] watch maybe at a later date but God
[41:45] we're thankful to be here to have this
[41:48] place and have you present with us so
[41:50] Lord may your Holy Spirit Lord break
[41:52] forth this word to us not just by words
[41:54] not just by the letters but reveal to us
[41:57] in here what you'd have us to see and
[41:58] though we give you thanks and praise for
[42:00] it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:02] Christ we pray amen now Genesis chapter
[42:06] 3
[42:06] I'll just read two verses to you when we
[42:09] go back to verse 1 of course we feed on
[42:11] this a highlights of different points of
[42:13] time but let's go to verse 6 and 6 and 7
[42:18] and we'll let you be seated and when the
[42:20] woman saw that the tree was good for
[42:21] food and it was pleasant to the eye and
[42:23] the tree to be desired to make one wise
[42:25] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[42:27] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[42:30] her and he did eat the eyes of them both
[42:32] were opened they knew that they were
[42:34] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[42:36] and made
[42:36] themselves aprons you can be seated if
[42:39] you like now now again the the point of
[42:44] this that I want to make is of course
[42:46] the tactics of the enemy and the devices
[42:48] of the devil and the time that we're
[42:50] living today and there's a lot going on
[42:52] is there's a tack of the enemy on every
[42:55] side and you know as well as I do that I
[43:00] wanted to bring this out but before I
[43:03] get into this but you know as well as I
[43:05] do as as soon as you try to now hold
[43:10] this is because we know this but when it
[43:13] gets into reality sometimes that we
[43:15] forget about it or we lose it but but
[43:18] understanding that that when you when
[43:21] you work to try to make a step towards
[43:24] God the sate is gonna it's not going to
[43:28] let just you let that go Satan's going
[43:31] to be there to try to pound you every
[43:34] chance you get the the closer you get to
[43:37] the doors of the kingdom the closer you
[43:39] get to God the closer you come to making
[43:42] that relationship with Jesus Christ the
[43:45] more artillery Satan is going to fire in
[43:47] your direction he's going to try to turn
[43:50] your attention and different things and
[43:52] try to get you distracted and try to
[43:54] pull you away from what you know is the
[43:56] truth from what you know it's real from
[43:59] what you know this Bible this word this
[44:01] message is the truth say he's going to
[44:03] try to pull you away he's going to try
[44:04] to bombard you with everything he's got
[44:07] a lot of times the biggest mistake
[44:09] people have when they come in
[44:11] Christianity they think they're coming
[44:14] into this great wonderful flower tea bed
[44:16] of ease if you know all your problems
[44:18] are going to be solved then everything's
[44:20] going to be perfect and you're just
[44:21] gonna ride and crest every wave and it
[44:24] just doesn't work that way because as a
[44:27] Christian we give our lives to the Lord
[44:30] and the Lord allows things to happen to
[44:32] test us to make sure that we are firm in
[44:35] what we know and what we believe in who
[44:37] we are if we don't know that it's like
[44:40] kinda like the pressure message
[44:41] for each a couple weeks ago if we don't
[44:43] know that if it's not settled in our
[44:45] hearts then when the real test does come
[44:48] that they will falter failing and and
[44:52] fall back that happens to many people
[44:55] how many people you probably know
[44:57] personally that just went along for a
[45:00] long time we're doing wonderful and and
[45:02] great then all of a sudden something
[45:04] happens and shakes their faith and they
[45:06] just don't know what to do and and
[45:08] sometimes they even use the verbage god
[45:10] help but they use the verbage I don't
[45:12] know where to turn
[45:13] if you're a Christian friend you don't
[45:15] know where to turn you're not a
[45:16] Christian a Christians know where to
[45:19] turn because there's only one place to
[45:21] turn to because when that artillery
[45:24] starts coming in and try to bring doubt
[45:26] and try to see the division and try to
[45:29] dis unifying all these great bombs get
[45:32] locked at you all these problems you
[45:34] said well I never had these problems
[45:36] when I wasn't serving God well of course
[45:38] not the devil had you all right he
[45:40] wasn't he wasn't disrupting your life
[45:42] the disruption of life comes when you're
[45:44] serving God the closer you get to him
[45:46] the more disruption there is we know
[45:49] that we've had prayer requests and
[45:51] things from people that's gone forth and
[45:54] and things that's happened in lives and
[45:57] you you know if some of those things has
[45:59] happened and it's gone through with
[46:01] prayer requests even sister Julia
[46:03] included a lot of you as a part of a
[46:05] text last week of the situation she'd
[46:08] been going through and you know it just
[46:11] shows that when you're when you're
[46:12] moving towards the Lord and when you're
[46:14] trying to do something you feel God is
[46:16] leading you to do Satan's not gonna let
[46:19] that go he's going to continue to love
[46:21] those those those bombs in your area you
[46:26] look around you think you've crossed
[46:28] over and all of a sudden there's bombs
[46:31] are all around you will understand
[46:34] friends we're in the middle of a warfare
[46:37] this is a warfare this is the
[46:38] battleground and world Satan Zenon's
[46:41] ground so if we're in the middle of this
[46:43] battle we're in the middle of this war
[46:45] now it's not the time to doubt now it's
[46:48] not the time to sow seed of discord now
[46:51] it's not the time to pull away because
[46:53] remember what does the pressure do the
[46:56] pressure either draws you closer into
[46:58] Christ or it drives you further away and
[47:01] when someone says they don't know where
[47:03] to turn you're driving further away when
[47:05] what we should be doing is getting
[47:07] closer to God so God I don't understand
[47:10] it I might not be able to figure it out
[47:15] or why're we always have second question
[47:18] why but lord I trust you you've never
[47:21] failed me you've always been there
[47:22] you've never failed me so I trust you
[47:25] Lord in family regardless I know this is
[47:28] the truth I know you weren't real I know
[47:30] this message is right but now look as we
[47:33] go back to the scripture let's get into
[47:35] Genesis chapter 3 for a minute and let's
[47:38] go back to verse 1 Genesis Trika chapter
[47:42] 3 verse 1 and see because this this is
[47:46] after God's creation and God has brought
[47:49] Adam along and and he's created and made
[47:53] a woman for him a hell pain and and now
[47:56] we've got a beautiful place just think
[47:59] of it just imagine when you become a
[48:01] Christian or even last week you've been
[48:05] a Christian for forty years but last
[48:06] week you're in the middle of this
[48:09] beautiful barnaby God's created that
[48:12] garden for you it's a beautiful place
[48:14] you seem like nothing to go wrong
[48:16] everything is right everything is
[48:18] beautiful everything's filled with joy
[48:21] and a bird singing and rainbows and life
[48:26] is good right garden to me and he's had
[48:29] a Garden of Eden experience good man and
[48:31] you feel like you're in the middle of
[48:33] Garden of Eden and all of a sudden here
[48:34] comes a bomb that you weren't expecting
[48:36] well that's what's happened
[48:39] they're in the middle of this beautiful
[48:41] Garden of Eden but that beautiful Garden
[48:43] of Eden is about to be disrupted God
[48:46] does everything for a purpose remember
[48:48] fragrance we spoke one joke before but
[48:51] God had job hedged remember that God had
[48:55] job hence Satan couldn't even touch Joe
[48:58] cuz he went to God God God says why have
[49:01] you considered Joe Satan said I can't
[49:03] even get to him you've got an edge I
[49:05] can't touch him God says ok let down the
[49:08] hedge and I'll prove to you that he
[49:10] belongs to me no matter what you do to
[49:13] him he's going to clean that much closer
[49:16] to me and God lowered the hedge Satan
[49:19] attacked him and then more Satan
[49:21] attacked in the closer job got to go oh
[49:24] let that be our testimony the more Satan
[49:27] might attack you just get that much
[49:29] closer to God just just Nussle up next
[49:32] to MZ
[49:33] he's that breasted one that we that we
[49:35] receive nourishment and strength from
[49:37] and you just muscled up next to God
[49:39] don't let all the distractions and all
[49:41] the things in the world take over that
[49:43] just come just click take that and just
[49:45] clean that much closer to God it's all
[49:48] happening for a reason
[49:49] but now the Garden of Eden there's a
[49:51] bomb about to be unleashed
[49:53] God's allowing the Satan to influence
[49:58] the serpent the closest one to the human
[50:01] race remember the link between the
[50:03] monkey and the man the place that the
[50:05] evolutionists cannot find because they
[50:08] can't find that link they can't prove
[50:10] evolution as a fact because of that lent
[50:12] missing link well we know where that
[50:14] missing link is he's crawling around his
[50:16] belly every fiber of his being has
[50:19] changed from the curse in the Garden of
[50:21] Eden that's why we can't find him but
[50:24] now the influence of Satan upon the
[50:27] serpent has brought this bomb into the
[50:30] Garden of Eden now the serpent was more
[50:33] subtle than any beast of the field which
[50:36] the Lord God had made now God made this
[50:39] serpent of course God made Lucifer which
[50:42] became safe the devil God made every
[50:45] beast of the field God made the serpent
[50:47] he was upright more like a man only seed
[50:50] that could cross with the woman
[50:52] of course it couldn't be with that with
[50:54] the animal I forgot now the only one
[50:56] that could cross over only seed that
[50:59] could mix with the woman so Satan found
[51:01] an instrument that he could work in and
[51:03] remember Satan is always going to find
[51:06] an instrument that he can work in
[51:08] understand don't be that instrument god
[51:11] help you
[51:12] don't ever be that instrument but Satan
[51:14] is always going to have an instrument
[51:16] that he can work in and the instruments
[51:19] he tries to work in the most are those
[51:21] of influence those who are influential
[51:24] positions namely pastors great amen a
[51:28] lot of times you won't hear things
[51:30] preached especially in the nominal world
[51:32] today about the devil and the devices of
[51:35] Satan because everything is again ranked
[51:38] those puppy-dog tails and everything is
[51:39] good you are wonderful and you are great
[51:42] and the grass is green and the sky is
[51:43] blue and you're just prosperous and you
[51:46] know that that's what you get that but
[51:47] so much of it all the time which is I
[51:50] don't want to say anything negative
[51:53] about anybody but is that that's not
[51:56] reality people like to hear those kinds
[52:00] of things if the positivity is fine we
[52:02] should all be positive a friend there's
[52:04] a devil out there that wants to drive
[52:06] you with him to a burning hell rate and
[52:09] that is a reality that we all must
[52:11] recognize but the devices of the devil
[52:14] see the serpent was more subtil now we
[52:17] know what the word subtil I've mentioned
[52:19] to you probably a couple of times but if
[52:21] you bear with me to give the definition
[52:23] the subtool if you go back in the Hebrew
[52:26] you recognize that that word subtil this
[52:28] put in there means shrewd crafty slime
[52:31] beguiling we understand that she he
[52:34] beguiled Eve he was sly he was shrewd
[52:38] even even in Scofield notes he talked
[52:41] about her brother and said this too but
[52:43] talked about how the serpent was
[52:45] probably a very beautiful creature and
[52:48] you think well how would you know the
[52:50] serpent would be a
[52:51] beautiful creature because of the
[52:53] beguiling abilities that he had to
[52:56] seduce Eve not to mention the fact that
[53:00] after he was cursed you can see him
[53:03] slithering around on his belly now every
[53:05] movement he really makes is very
[53:07] graceful
[53:08] many of them have colored very beautiful
[53:10] I've seen some very beautiful snakes
[53:12] although I didn't cut their heads off
[53:15] they keep a try so that's a good thing
[53:18] but anyway their movements are beautiful
[53:21] a lot of times their colors are
[53:23] beautiful you see one of the most
[53:25] deadliest snakes when he gets riled up
[53:27] he'll jump up and his is the Cobra ice
[53:30] you look at it and thing from the back
[53:33] hand fronts a beautiful animal beautiful
[53:35] reptile creature
[53:36] well that's just a signification of what
[53:39] it was in the Garden of Eden when God
[53:41] cursed him down there on the ground it
[53:43] changed every Faculty of his beings he
[53:46] he couldn't he could talk when he was
[53:48] the serpent in the Garden of Eden he
[53:49] could communicate with Eve but he could
[53:52] not communicate now so every part of
[53:56] every part of that was changed but now
[53:59] as this beautiful subtool beguiling
[54:03] individual sly crude crafty but again
[54:08] the word that I found a couple years ago
[54:11] that struck me the strongest when I
[54:13] first looked at this was the word
[54:15] sensible the word sensible and subtool
[54:20] it to me would identify the serpent as
[54:25] much as the crude slime crafty part
[54:28] because what he offered and what Satan
[54:32] is offering today sounds to the common
[54:35] ear to the human mind as something that
[54:38] makes sense
[54:40] drink I don't know how many times I've
[54:42] said this but we don't look for things
[54:45] that make sense a lot of times things
[54:48] that make sense to the human mind are
[54:51] things that are contrary to God a lot of
[54:54] times the things that don't make any
[54:56] sense are things that is godly
[54:59] I mean you make sense to one day being
[55:02] ready to eat not with cancer and the
[55:05] next minute you don't have cancer at all
[55:07] to be seen in your body what sense is
[55:10] there in that there is none what sense
[55:13] is there in you coming here today and
[55:15] listening to this lump of clay up here
[55:19] speaking to you today what sense does
[55:22] that make it makes no sense to the
[55:25] common man to the natural minded it's
[55:28] not sensible but it's sensible to not
[55:31] God instituted it that way to bring his
[55:34] word so how do they know unless they err
[55:37] hear the word and how do they hear the
[55:39] word without a preacher that's God's Way
[55:42] and how much sense did it make for Adam
[55:46] and Eve to fall in the Garden of Eden
[55:47] and God's rid the resolution God's
[55:51] remedy was to kill two lambs and throw
[55:54] the sheep skin in for them to wear made
[55:58] more sense for them to take fig leaves
[56:00] which I've become way more acutely aware
[56:02] of recently because of my wife's desire
[56:05] for figs in the trees at the zika's
[56:08] house I begin to really see what these
[56:11] fig leaves really look like more so and
[56:13] and I can see it think that would create
[56:17] a good covering it says apron but it
[56:20] just means covering a place that would
[56:22] that would cover to sew together to join
[56:25] together now that made more sense than
[56:28] taking a couple animals and killing them
[56:31] why would you do that because there had
[56:33] to be a sacrifice to meet the sin the
[56:37] sin was a blood hemoglobin sin and the
[56:41] sacrifice had to be a blood hemoglobin
[56:43] sacrifice when Jesus came and gave his
[56:47] blood that blood of man
[56:50] of a perfect male was June was to
[56:53] annihilate the original sin which was a
[56:56] blood transfer a semen transfer it
[57:00] wasn't a fruit or a an apple or apricot
[57:05] er or a fig or something they ate it was
[57:08] a relationship we know that and the
[57:12] sacrifice had to make the sin but to the
[57:15] natural eye it doesn't make any sense
[57:17] no sense so let me help me get past this
[57:22] point so something that is sensible many
[57:27] times because because I not used the
[57:30] phrase all a lot oh that makes sense
[57:32] mmm oh that makes sense well that's fine
[57:35] when it comes to something of a world or
[57:36] something that you're trying to learn or
[57:38] something to enhance your intelligence
[57:41] or something so well that makes sense
[57:42] that fits there yeah okay that makes
[57:45] sense that's fine nothing wrong with
[57:46] that but that's not what we're talking
[57:48] about we're talking about the things of
[57:50] God and we're talking about the things
[57:52] of God we draw a strap strike contrast
[57:55] between the things of God and the things
[57:57] of the world the things that we learned
[58:00] that the things that we see taste feel
[58:03] smeller here is a different situation we
[58:06] draw a very stark contrast between the
[58:10] two we're talking about God now and
[58:13] you're talking about godly things
[58:15] it's not always that that's sensible
[58:17] right because what seems to be right to
[58:20] God is wrong to man and what is right to
[58:23] man is wrong to not we know that's a
[58:26] scripture I mean I paraphrase a little
[58:28] bit but that's that's the Bible it
[58:30] doesn't make sense to us it's probably
[58:32] God if it doesn't make sense to if it
[58:36] doesn't work with God then it probably
[58:38] makes sense to man and that's the track
[58:40] that Men goes off on that's the way they
[58:42] go with it
[58:43] that's why so many people leave the
[58:45] message then they think oh well what
[58:47] well that makes sense well yeah well I
[58:50] never knew that before
[58:51] oh well is it coming to you by knowledge
[58:54] or is it be coming to you about
[58:55] revelation
[58:57] let's continue to read now the serpent
[59:00] we've established was more sensible
[59:03] crude crafty sensible then the Lord got
[59:07] it mate and he said unto the woman yea
[59:10] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[59:12] tree of the garden now that's the first
[59:15] trick of the devil to sow doubt sowing
[59:19] doubt is the first trick of the devil
[59:22] it's the first in the trinity of the
[59:25] deception of Satan that's the first to
[59:29] get it out first thing if Satan's ever
[59:32] going to get a hold of you he has to
[59:35] cause you first to doubt to get you to
[59:39] doubt what you believe to get you to
[59:41] doubt what you've known your whole life
[59:43] for most your life or whatever the
[59:45] scenario is doubt that's the first thing
[59:48] he does and that's what Satan is doing
[59:50] to eat now Eve knows the word because
[59:53] her husband told her he Adam told her
[59:56] that what God said now the fact that
[1:00:00] Adam told her did not make it any less
[1:00:03] the Word of God if I tell you something
[1:00:07] God give to me as a revelation through
[1:00:09] the word message whatever it doesn't
[1:00:11] make it any less of the word or any less
[1:00:13] truth by my relaying that to you as it
[1:00:17] was when it came to me or if you witness
[1:00:20] to somebody is no less a word to
[1:00:23] somebody as it was when he came to you
[1:00:25] or to me so when Adam got it he got it
[1:00:29] fresh from God remember the voice of the
[1:00:31] Lord the Bible says the voice of the
[1:00:34] Lord will read it the minute walk with
[1:00:36] Adam in the garden in the cool of the
[1:00:38] day no doubt what they talked about God
[1:00:41] told Adam we could read it here that God
[1:00:44] told Adam
[1:00:45] you can either the fruits of the tree of
[1:00:47] the bar but don't eat the fruit of this
[1:00:48] in the midst of the tree now we know
[1:00:51] trees represent people in the Bible the
[1:00:52] Med so on but that deception
[1:00:57] came through doubt that's what he tried
[1:01:00] to get her to doubt now again I'm
[1:01:04] bringing this to us to refresh
[1:01:07] us and help us remember and remind us
[1:01:10] when these things are going on it's just
[1:01:12] the device isn't the enemy yes it's just
[1:01:15] Satan trying to draw you away
[1:01:18] it's just Satan trying to defeat you to
[1:01:21] get you away from what is true and what
[1:01:23] is real
[1:01:24] the first thing he uses in his Trinity
[1:01:27] of deception is to get you to down
[1:01:30] yay hath God said ye shall not eat of
[1:01:33] every tree of the garden you notice the
[1:01:36] question mark at the end of that
[1:01:37] sentence that question mark means it's a
[1:01:41] question he's asking her which is
[1:01:44] showing in her mind the seed of doubt
[1:01:47] oh they God really say this now she says
[1:01:50] the woman said to the serpent we may eat
[1:01:53] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[1:01:54] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:01:57] the midst of the garden God has said ye
[1:01:59] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:02:01] touch it lest she die now is that the
[1:02:03] truth that's absolutely the truth that's
[1:02:06] exactly what God told Adam and no doubt
[1:02:09] exactly what Adam told Eve so what did
[1:02:14] Eve have at this moment did you have a
[1:02:18] knowledge of what Adam told her or did
[1:02:21] she have a revelation of what God told
[1:02:23] Adam understand let me say that again
[1:02:28] did she have a knowledge of what Adam
[1:02:31] told her or did she have a revelation of
[1:02:34] what God told Adam see there's a big
[1:02:38] difference there it's subtle but it's
[1:02:41] big difference if she simply had a
[1:02:44] knowledge of what Adam told her all she
[1:02:48] had was knowledge but if she had a
[1:02:51] revelation of what God told Adam then
[1:02:56] she had something that changed her life
[1:02:58] that become a part of her that she could
[1:03:01] not doubt many times I give you the
[1:03:03] I'm not a Chinese woman I lived the life
[1:03:05] of a white male I've said that to you
[1:03:06] many times that's the greatest
[1:03:08] description I know of revelation
[1:03:10] I can't doubt I can't deny I live the
[1:03:13] life of a Chinese woman because I'm a
[1:03:15] white man understand
[1:03:17] so if God's revealed something to you
[1:03:20] and you know it's right you can't go off
[1:03:24] of that because you know it's just a
[1:03:26] part of who you are when somebody tries
[1:03:28] to bring something contrary to you no
[1:03:31] matter how sensible it may sound you
[1:03:33] know it's wrong right because God has
[1:03:37] already revealed to you the truth
[1:03:39] so is she speaking to the serpent a
[1:03:42] knowledge of Adam's message to her a
[1:03:45] revelation of what God told to Adam
[1:03:48] which of course then told her obviously
[1:03:52] she's speaking of simply the fact that
[1:03:54] Adam told her this is what it is now
[1:03:57] what she said is no less the Word of God
[1:04:00] understand whether it's my knowledge of
[1:04:03] Revelation is no less the Word of God
[1:04:05] it's still the Word of God amen
[1:04:08] even spoke by the devil which will maybe
[1:04:11] hopefully Lord willing we'll get to in a
[1:04:12] few minutes even if spoken by the devil
[1:04:15] himself it's still the word God it's
[1:04:18] still the Word of God so it's still the
[1:04:20] Word of God but the difference is cheese
[1:04:23] has simply a knowledge of what her
[1:04:24] husband told her rather than a
[1:04:25] revelation of what God told out you see
[1:04:30] that was that was Cain enables problem -
[1:04:32] that was Cain's problem what bagels
[1:04:34] brother Abel had a revelation not simply
[1:04:38] knowledge Cain had a knowledge of what
[1:04:41] of what was told to it not a revelation
[1:04:44] man Hebrews 11 says enabled by
[1:04:48] revelation by faith faith is a
[1:04:50] revelation offered to God a more
[1:04:52] excellent sacrifice it was revealed to
[1:04:54] him that it wasn't fig leaves but it was
[1:04:58] it was of knowledge by Cain that it was
[1:05:01] Bakke life fruits vegetables leaves
[1:05:05] whatever because that's what Adam and he
[1:05:07] tried to do in the beginning they tried
[1:05:09] this so
[1:05:10] fig leaves together to try to hide their
[1:05:12] nakedness from who from each other
[1:05:15] I mean they've already been joined
[1:05:18] together as one so who are they sewing
[1:05:22] fig leaves together I mean just animals
[1:05:24] around
[1:05:24] who are these sewing fig leaves together
[1:05:26] the hide themselves from there's only
[1:05:29] one that's right right they're only
[1:05:33] trying to hide themselves from God
[1:05:35] because they've realized that they were
[1:05:37] naked well shall I say the same thing
[1:05:39] brother madam said sixty years ago if
[1:05:42] Apple's made women realize they're naked
[1:05:44] it's time to pass the apples again
[1:05:46] because they're out on the streets naked
[1:05:48] again but let's continue on revelation
[1:05:52] or knowledge now she having knowledge
[1:05:55] obviously because she repeated God's
[1:05:57] Word the way that it was given to Adam
[1:06:00] but now the second part of the Trinity
[1:06:04] of Satan's deception and the serpent
[1:06:08] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:06:11] die now every part of that is the word
[1:06:16] except for one part one word not God
[1:06:22] said ye shall surely die the serpent
[1:06:25] said ye shall not surely die
[1:06:27] so what's he done he's caused her to
[1:06:29] doubt first that's the first thing he
[1:06:31] comes to you it's always going to make
[1:06:33] you to doubt second thing is he's going
[1:06:36] to try to hide read the word he's going
[1:06:39] to try to take the word which most of
[1:06:43] you know all of us here I believe know
[1:06:44] is the truths it's God in letter form
[1:06:47] he's gonna take that and hydrate it from
[1:06:51] what you know is the truth from what God
[1:06:54] has give to you as the truth he's gonna
[1:06:56] hide read it by taking the word itself
[1:06:59] and make it say something that it
[1:07:01] doesn't actually say God said you will
[1:07:05] die the serpent said you shall not die
[1:07:08] so his first thing is to get you to
[1:07:10] doubt his second thing is to hybrid the
[1:07:12] word to make the word say something it
[1:07:15] doesn't say now that's a lot of the
[1:07:18] pitfalls that a lot of people fall into
[1:07:20] today a lot of Ministers
[1:07:22] they said well I don't doubt the word
[1:07:24] but how can you not doubt the word when
[1:07:27] you feel you have to bring your word or
[1:07:31] your version or your hybrid idea of what
[1:07:34] the word says if a person has two hybrid
[1:07:38] the word to make it say what they wanted
[1:07:41] to say or fit their own lives you don't
[1:07:44] believe the word you'd have to doubt the
[1:07:48] word two hybrid people will say I
[1:07:51] believe the word but then they'll preach
[1:07:53] what a seminary teaches they'll preach
[1:07:55] what a denomination teaches they'll
[1:07:57] preach what somebody comes to the
[1:07:59] contrary to the word they'll say that's
[1:08:03] hybrid then you don't believe the word
[1:08:05] our our spiritual growth is not based on
[1:08:09] your knowledge of Revelation or doctrine
[1:08:12] your spiritual growth is based on
[1:08:15] obedience to Christ in your relationship
[1:08:17] with him not how much you know not how
[1:08:21] much knowledge you gain but how close
[1:08:23] are you to the Lord what is your
[1:08:25] relationship with him that's the that's
[1:08:28] the spiritual that's where our spiritual
[1:08:29] growth comes from
[1:08:31] see now we've got the second part of the
[1:08:33] Trinity of Satan's deception it's right
[1:08:36] here the Garden of Eden he said well I
[1:08:37] thought his Trinity was Father Son Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost it is that's the titles evil
[1:08:43] spirits travel and the titles of Father
[1:08:45] Son Holy Ghost not Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:08:49] the Trinity of Satan in the Garden of
[1:08:51] Eden first is is doubt second is is
[1:08:54] hybrid now where does he go from there
[1:08:56] you can probably see you shall not
[1:09:00] surely die fifth verse now for God doth
[1:09:04] know that in the day ye eat thereof then
[1:09:07] your eyes shall be opened and he shall
[1:09:09] be God's knowing good and evil
[1:09:11] now was he right he absolutely was right
[1:09:16] what he just told her is exactly what
[1:09:20] happened he was right but it wasn't
[1:09:24] God's gospel
[1:09:25] it wasn't what God gave it wasn't God's
[1:09:30] Word it was
[1:09:31] serpents were so first he caused doubt
[1:09:35] second he calls hybrid ation of the word
[1:09:38] third he brings his own gospel in now
[1:09:42] he's got a new gospel to her and buy
[1:09:45] that new gospel she's accepted that new
[1:09:48] gospel cause first she doubted she had
[1:09:50] to doubt or she would have acted on it
[1:09:53] she would've either if there was no
[1:09:55] doubt you wouldn't even entertain it
[1:09:57] because you know it's not true sorry she
[1:10:00] had to doubt and she had to listen to
[1:10:02] the high predation of the word you shall
[1:10:04] not surely die which had 95 90 plus
[1:10:07] percent work to it all just one word
[1:10:11] just one word friends you shall not
[1:10:14] surely die hybrid a hybrid the word so
[1:10:17] now after she he's God rid the place of
[1:10:20] hydrating the word just manipulating
[1:10:22] what part of it now he brings his own
[1:10:24] message he's got her in position to
[1:10:28] receive his word by causing her to doubt
[1:10:31] and hydrating the word now she's in
[1:10:34] position to receive his message what was
[1:10:39] his message to get her to have relation
[1:10:41] with him God does know in the day ether
[1:10:45] of your eyes shall be opened he shall be
[1:10:47] as God's knowing good and evil that's
[1:10:49] his message it was true remember Lucifer
[1:10:53] was God's right-hand man
[1:10:55] it was true but it wasn't what God gave
[1:10:57] them what God gave them was don't touch
[1:11:00] it or you're gonna die period there was
[1:11:03] no caveat to it there was no exception
[1:11:06] there was no buts or maybes there was do
[1:11:09] it and death that's what God said period
[1:11:12] now people want to fool around with that
[1:11:14] and say well yeah but what about this
[1:11:16] and you know I think gods are loving God
[1:11:18] and yeah he is a loving God but he's not
[1:11:20] a dirty grandpa there that's not gonna
[1:11:22] honor his word he God expects us to live
[1:11:26] by his word and the judgment of that
[1:11:31] word befall those who do not
[1:11:34] so he said now we've got the Trinity see
[1:11:39] the Trinity of Satan's deception doubt
[1:11:41] hybrid new message
[1:11:44] that's exactly now after she received
[1:11:47] the new message what does she do just
[1:11:49] like anybody that receives a if you
[1:11:51] receive a new message that you really
[1:11:53] believe you really give credence to that
[1:11:56] message what's the first thing you do
[1:11:59] you have gone amen
[1:12:03] that's what a lot of people are doing
[1:12:05] that today in the streets of this
[1:12:06] country they've received a message and
[1:12:09] they're acting on it they're out in the
[1:12:11] streets they're acting on what the
[1:12:13] message was when you receive a message
[1:12:15] that you really believe the first thing
[1:12:18] you do is act on it when you become a
[1:12:21] Christian and you really believe that
[1:12:23] this was the way to live and this was
[1:12:24] pleasing to the Lord and this is what
[1:12:26] you wanted your life to be what did you
[1:12:29] do
[1:12:29] you acted upon it Peter said repent you
[1:12:34] repented be baptized we're baptized and
[1:12:36] receive the Holy Ghost and praise God
[1:12:38] hopefully 100 jeev that point what is
[1:12:42] you you've acted on and then after you
[1:12:45] got it you went to church and you lived
[1:12:48] your life as a godly life you witness to
[1:12:50] other people you wanted others to to
[1:12:53] receive what you've got you wanted
[1:12:54] others to to have what you had
[1:12:57] you acted upon that that's just normal I
[1:13:00] mean even in the world of business if
[1:13:03] somebody come to someone and let's just
[1:13:06] say for a moment that that a Warren
[1:13:09] Buffett came and you have the utmost
[1:13:12] confidence in Warren Buffett and he's
[1:13:15] been like the master of Wall Street his
[1:13:17] whole life but he's a multi-millionaire
[1:13:19] so obviously the man knows what he's
[1:13:21] doing is that he'd come and he'd give
[1:13:23] you some advice and said you should buy
[1:13:26] this so-and-so and stop he's so I you
[1:13:30] know I don't know
[1:13:31] I don't think I want to do that you got
[1:13:33] the money you got the time you can do it
[1:13:35] but you think it all well you know I
[1:13:37] don't know you know it's not that big
[1:13:40] deal with me I don't really wanted to do
[1:13:41] that you know the next day the stocks up
[1:13:44] 10 bucks next day it's up 30 bucks next
[1:13:46] day it's a hundred bucks you're like oh
[1:13:47] why didn't I do that you know a lot of
[1:13:51] times people do do that but most of the
[1:13:53] time if you receive something from
[1:13:54] something you truly believe and you
[1:13:57] revere and you hold up you act upon it
[1:13:59] if you were to get something you know is
[1:14:01] a surefire thing or something you know
[1:14:04] it's gonna be right you do something
[1:14:06] about it
[1:14:06] you act on it that's what he did she
[1:14:10] received Satan's new message through the
[1:14:12] serpent and she acted upon it the sixth
[1:14:15] verse when the woman saw that the tree
[1:14:17] was good for food that was pleasant to
[1:14:19] the eye and the tree to be desired to
[1:14:21] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:14:23] thereof she had a relationship with a
[1:14:25] serpent and did eaten gave also unto her
[1:14:28] husband with her and he did he remember
[1:14:31] this the Bible says that she was to see
[1:14:34] but he wasn't he went out to take her
[1:14:37] and became sin for her that God wouldn't
[1:14:39] kill her God would have had to kill him
[1:14:41] to kill her just like Satan just like us
[1:14:44] you mean
[1:14:45] Jesus did the same thing for his bride
[1:14:47] we were racked in sin headed to hell
[1:14:50] faster than the Gentile people could
[1:14:52] head but Jesus Christ came along and he
[1:14:55] stepped forward and he embraced his
[1:14:57] bride and he took her into his bosom and
[1:14:59] he took their place so that he/she could
[1:15:04] become him now we stand in his
[1:15:07] righteousness because of the price that
[1:15:10] he paid for us and embracing us into
[1:15:13] himself
[1:15:13] now we become as he is now God can't
[1:15:17] destroy this US bride sinners as we were
[1:15:21] degradable desert ale we're never gonna
[1:15:26] see hell because he's Jesus step forward
[1:15:30] remember revelation five took the book
[1:15:33] redeemed all it was his now when God
[1:15:36] looks at you he doesn't see that
[1:15:38] sin he sees the blood of Jesus he sees
[1:15:41] the sacrifice because the sacrifice my
[1:15:44] friend is still there that blood is
[1:15:47] still there making intercession for us
[1:15:50] praise the Lord just like Adam did in
[1:15:53] the Garden of Eden Adam went out and
[1:15:55] embraced his wife and took her into his
[1:15:58] bosom had relation with her such a
[1:16:01] relation the serpent and Adam both had a
[1:16:04] child come forth from her came enabled
[1:16:06] he took her to himself see he did take
[1:16:10] and they both knew that they were naked
[1:16:13] see seven persons the eyes of them both
[1:16:15] were opened and they knew that they were
[1:16:17] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[1:16:19] and made a made themselves aprons it's
[1:16:22] the exact same thing people try to do
[1:16:24] today they try to hide behind religion
[1:16:27] they try to hide behind a botany life
[1:16:30] something that's sensible
[1:16:33] not God's provided way God has a
[1:16:36] provided way friend and that's the only
[1:16:38] way that's going to get us to him that's
[1:16:41] the only way this one excuse us from
[1:16:43] this world in line for sin it's not
[1:16:45] doing it the way we want to do it like
[1:16:47] many people I would try to tell you
[1:16:48] today you are your own God though you're
[1:16:51] not we are he is and we belong to you
[1:16:56] in ourselves in ourselves God has made
[1:17:00] us a part of him to speak and name just
[1:17:02] like in the Garden of Eden but we're not
[1:17:04] God amen
[1:17:08] but they did what they thought was right
[1:17:10] they tried to hide themselves and they
[1:17:12] heard the now listen here we go now and
[1:17:14] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:17:17] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:17:19] day he was walking in the garden in the
[1:17:21] cool of the day the voice of the Lord
[1:17:23] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[1:17:25] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:17:27] trees of the garden now the question
[1:17:29] here is why are they hiding themselves
[1:17:34] amongst the trees of the garden
[1:17:37] did they not already just so fig leaves
[1:17:40] together to hide their nakedness
[1:17:43] well if they saw the fig leaves to hide
[1:17:45] their nakedness why they go into the
[1:17:46] trees to hide themselves aren't they
[1:17:49] already covered see this is the son of
[1:17:53] God were talking about this is the first
[1:17:55] created son of God Adam that we're
[1:17:58] talking about
[1:17:59] he knew although the best he can do at
[1:18:03] the time was the fig leaves he knew that
[1:18:05] was not sufficient in coming into the
[1:18:07] presence of God he knew that that wasn't
[1:18:10] gonna was going to suffice for what
[1:18:12] God's law required was a lot of time but
[1:18:16] what God's Word required he knew it
[1:18:18] wasn't he was a son of God he knew it
[1:18:20] wasn't sufficient so he knew that they
[1:18:23] would still have to go in and try to
[1:18:26] hide themselves or separate themselves
[1:18:29] apart from the holy God because now they
[1:18:33] had transgressed his word and they had
[1:18:35] fallen from grace so they're dividing
[1:18:39] themselves from the presence of God
[1:18:42] hiding themselves in the trees of the
[1:18:46] garden which of course a lot of people
[1:18:48] do that in church - you know again
[1:18:50] people represents trees and the Bible
[1:18:52] represents people you know a lot of
[1:18:55] people come to church and though you
[1:18:57] know try to do the acts and play the
[1:19:00] part and they'll try to just hide
[1:19:01] amongst the trees kind of hard to do in
[1:19:03] a congregation like we've got we don't
[1:19:05] have enough trees to hide but a lot of
[1:19:07] people try to find big churches no boat
[1:19:09] unless on the back pew or something now
[1:19:11] try to hide themselves and they'll say
[1:19:12] oh I went to church today
[1:19:14] did you really probably not they
[1:19:18] probably didn't and hide themselves
[1:19:19] among the trees and they just become a
[1:19:21] part of it they scoot in this go down
[1:19:23] that's all it is to them but there's no
[1:19:27] place you can hide the God doesn't find
[1:19:29] the Lord called up to Adam and said unto
[1:19:31] Him where art dominance of course one of
[1:19:33] the most outstanding parts of the
[1:19:35] scripture where are now you mean you are
[1:19:37] almighty omnipotent all-knowing infinite
[1:19:39] God you don't know where Adam is of
[1:19:42] course he knew where Adam was he wanted
[1:19:44] to know if Adam knew where he was that's
[1:19:47] that that's my take God wanted Adam to
[1:19:51] know Adam do you know where you are do
[1:19:54] you know what you've done do you know
[1:19:56] what you have called do you know what
[1:19:58] situation and circumstance you find
[1:20:00] yourself in now where are you he's not
[1:20:03] God's not God's not a blind man in a
[1:20:06] dark room trying to find a black cat he
[1:20:09] knows where Adam was I mean people would
[1:20:12] read this part of the scripture like God
[1:20:14] saying Oh out of work could you possibly
[1:20:16] be Adam oh where I can't find you are
[1:20:21] you playing peek-a-boo with me today I
[1:20:23] can't that's not God we're talking about
[1:20:27] an almighty all-powerful omnipotent
[1:20:29] all-knowing unchanging it for my God how
[1:20:34] is he not gonna know where Adam is he
[1:20:37] knows exactly where Adam is he wants
[1:20:40] Adam to know out of where are you what
[1:20:42] have you done what have you caused do
[1:20:45] you know where you're standing now you
[1:20:48] know what's gonna have to happen now
[1:20:49] because I told you the moment you did
[1:20:52] this that we would be separated told you
[1:20:56] that as soon as you did it be school of
[1:20:59] the dog these cool to evening walks
[1:21:01] within you knew that there would be a
[1:21:03] great chasm that would separate God and
[1:21:06] man until the supreme sacrifice came you
[1:21:11] knew that this was gonna happen
[1:21:12] where are you let me move on and he
[1:21:15] heard and he said I heard thy voice in
[1:21:17] the garden I was afraid because I was
[1:21:19] naked and I hid myself again he already
[1:21:21] covered himself from his nakedness right
[1:21:23] so to think leaves together but he still
[1:21:26] knew that that wasn't enough
[1:21:29] he knew his nakedness bear open before
[1:21:32] the Lord now it wasn't just a physical
[1:21:35] nakedness right now it's a spiritual
[1:21:37] nakedness and he said who told you that
[1:21:41] that was naked as thou eaten of the tree
[1:21:43] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:21:45] should it's not either man said the
[1:21:47] woman whom thou gave us to me with me
[1:21:50] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[1:21:51] the Lord God said unto the woman what is
[1:21:54] this that thou has done the woman said
[1:21:56] the serpent beguiled me and I did eat
[1:21:58] now it's time to pass the book you know
[1:22:00] that's what happens a lot of times you
[1:22:03] know probably the worst part that that
[1:22:04] happens is politics today you know some
[1:22:06] little thing goes wrong and this one
[1:22:08] oblate mountain and that want to blame a
[1:22:10] pond that won't align that one and you
[1:22:12] know the problem is we're all at fault
[1:22:13] whole systems at fault but they want to
[1:22:16] put a bandaid on a broke and you've got
[1:22:19] to find out what caused the broke leg to
[1:22:21] start with not just put a bandaid on it
[1:22:23] well how'd you break your leg well I did
[1:22:25] this we're gonna do that again how did
[1:22:30] you break your ankle I jumped off the
[1:22:31] roof of the house we don't do that again
[1:22:33] you won't break rank like that again
[1:22:35] right right well that's the same thing
[1:22:37] happens today they said well this
[1:22:39] happened well how'd it happen well then
[1:22:41] don't do that again
[1:22:42] but everybody was passed above well this
[1:22:46] one did this you know Adam says well the
[1:22:49] woman you gave me and the woman's like
[1:22:52] well the serpent beguiled me and the
[1:22:55] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[1:22:56] thou has done this thou art cursed above
[1:22:59] all cattle above every beast of the
[1:23:00] field upon thy belly shalt thou go cuz
[1:23:03] he was not a recently on his belly does
[1:23:05] shall be the shop out eat all the days
[1:23:08] of my life and I will put enmity between
[1:23:09] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[1:23:11] and her seed proving again the serpent
[1:23:14] had his seed produced in the of the man
[1:23:18] came a man who was the Bible says was of
[1:23:21] that wicked one amen between I see her
[1:23:25] she is your Bruce ahead
[1:23:27] bruises heal now that's the subtlety of
[1:23:30] the enemy the cunningness of the of the
[1:23:33] devil the Trinity of The Devil's
[1:23:36] deception get you two down hybrid the
[1:23:40] word that you know it's true and then
[1:23:43] bring a new gospel that's exactly the
[1:23:46] only way a seminary a church minister
[1:23:51] denomination could do anything like that
[1:23:53] is first get people to either withhold
[1:23:56] the Bible which they used to do in old
[1:23:58] times the Catholic Church used to just
[1:24:00] hold this Bible back and not give it to
[1:24:02] the common people for them to read first
[1:24:04] you just it would hold it from them so
[1:24:06] they don't have it to read at all or you
[1:24:09] try to get them to say well that's not
[1:24:11] exactly what it means right well that's
[1:24:13] not exactly what it says and lord have
[1:24:16] Saints I don't know the Lord how many
[1:24:19] actually variations of the Bible are
[1:24:22] there today and how many interpretations
[1:24:25] how many what's the word I'm trying to
[1:24:29] go home you have in your mind somebody
[1:24:31] translations of the Bible are there
[1:24:35] today there's probably hundreds of
[1:24:37] translations when all we need is the one
[1:24:41] that God originally came to us amen
[1:24:44] all we need is the one that you give to
[1:24:46] us begin with but you looking oh they
[1:24:48] trying to figure it out they try to make
[1:24:50] this and hyper distant and then what
[1:24:52] they had well you're not a Catholic
[1:24:55] unless you take communion but she let
[1:24:57] you take the uterus and all this like
[1:25:00] taking the Holy Spirit well you can't be
[1:25:02] a bad just unless you're baptized in the
[1:25:04] name of Father the Father Son the Holy
[1:25:06] Ghost so we you can't be a Methodist
[1:25:08] about whatever they all have their own
[1:25:10] little things as they go by that that's
[1:25:12] their doctrine that's their dogma and
[1:25:14] they all wind this up they're all
[1:25:18] winding this up today
[1:25:20] oh lord help me this later they're all
[1:25:23] winding this up today in the World
[1:25:25] Council of Churches just hold on for a
[1:25:30] minute
[1:25:31] because I want to get more to that I
[1:25:33] found something out yesterday that I
[1:25:35] didn't even know but anyway look at this
[1:25:38] price of misery got revealed when evil
[1:25:41] went away from the word she went away
[1:25:42] from her mate and when the church the
[1:25:45] bride goes away from the word to a
[1:25:47] denomination she rejects and commits
[1:25:49] fornication with the world of man's
[1:25:51] wisdom and rejecting the authority of
[1:25:54] God's Word
[1:25:56] leave this now and faith without works
[1:25:59] is dead
[1:26:00] August 1950 the first sin that was ever
[1:26:03] committed look at this now the first sin
[1:26:05] that was ever committed and what is sin
[1:26:08] unbelief unbelief first sin first not
[1:26:12] really ever committed was doubting God's
[1:26:14] word amen there we go in the Garden of
[1:26:19] Eden chapter 3 verses one two and three
[1:26:21] doubting the word first in ever happened
[1:26:24] doubting the word is that right God said
[1:26:26] ye shall eat the day either of that day
[1:26:29] you die Satan said surely you'll not die
[1:26:32] and he gave and he got heed to doubt
[1:26:35] God's Word and to seeking knowledge is
[1:26:38] that right Amen said thinking minutes
[1:26:42] before remember Satan punts the first
[1:26:44] hole through Eve's mind of her thinking
[1:26:46] to let the taste of his wisdom and
[1:26:49] knowledge get through amen let me read
[1:26:53] this last one god of this evil age and
[1:26:57] notice he preached that kind of
[1:26:59] scientific social educated progressive
[1:27:03] gospel to eat that struck me the other
[1:27:08] day I want to go to a Matthew chapter 4
[1:27:11] but that struck me I believe it actually
[1:27:14] was yesterday
[1:27:16] just contemplating on the Lord and
[1:27:19] thinking of the things of the Lord
[1:27:20] yesterday Sonia was gone from house
[1:27:22] running errands and I had about spot
[1:27:25] right around the time that I thought I
[1:27:27] got that vision of what the Lord has
[1:27:29] prepared on the other side that cabin or
[1:27:32] that place of abode that's looking
[1:27:35] forward to going to and I started
[1:27:37] thinking you know when when in the
[1:27:40] natural life and I want to feed off of
[1:27:43] this quote if you will if I read it
[1:27:46] again that social educated progressive
[1:27:49] gospel progressive people who's even in
[1:27:52] the message we want to say this is a
[1:27:54] progressive gospel it's not a
[1:27:55] progressive gospel God's Word is God's
[1:27:58] Word from the moment of creation even
[1:28:04] before then
[1:28:05] Jim than it is now God's words not
[1:28:07] changed God's words God's work period
[1:28:09] it's not progressive it is what I did
[1:28:11] now I may gain a more of an
[1:28:13] understanding or a revelation of it to
[1:28:17] me personally but the gospel is up the
[1:28:19] words not progressive it is what it is
[1:28:21] what's brought me to the ball you know
[1:28:23] in this country we have counterfeiters
[1:28:26] in the world not just this country but I
[1:28:28] use this country in the in this country
[1:28:30] we have counterfeiters people that try
[1:28:32] to get around earning the money from
[1:28:35] themselves and and working for it which
[1:28:38] we should do and they try to print it
[1:28:41] they've been doing this for years they
[1:28:43] they print the money well let's just get
[1:28:45] somebody that's a good artist and
[1:28:46] they'll just draw this business and
[1:28:48] we'll just make places we'll just print
[1:28:50] our own money
[1:28:51] and we'll just pass an office as the
[1:28:54] real is the genuine you know if there's
[1:28:57] a counterfeit there's got to be a real
[1:29:00] true there's a counterfeit it's got to
[1:29:03] be a real that that counterfeit came off
[1:29:05] of if the counterfeit doesn't have a
[1:29:07] real then that is the real it can't be a
[1:29:11] counterfeit if there's nothing you came
[1:29:12] off of because that would be the
[1:29:13] original or the real one there's an so
[1:29:16] if there's a counterfeit there's got to
[1:29:17] be real so if there's a real and there's
[1:29:20] a real hundred dollar bill and somebody
[1:29:22] decides that they want to print a
[1:29:24] hundred
[1:29:24] look just like the regular hundred OBO
[1:29:26] but it's not one not backed by the
[1:29:28] government or anything else not that any
[1:29:30] of the money we have is now but anyway
[1:29:32] that's beside the point
[1:29:33] they they try to make it look exactly
[1:29:36] like that dollar bill so the crook is
[1:29:40] progressive in their intelligence and in
[1:29:44] their ability to make a counterfeit look
[1:29:47] just like the real so what does the
[1:29:50] government have to do the government has
[1:29:53] to take and retool that hundred-dollar
[1:29:55] bill and change it and change the paper
[1:29:59] and the color and everything else so
[1:30:01] that it becomes harder to counterfeit
[1:30:04] but then the counterfeits get more
[1:30:07] progressive and they figure out how do
[1:30:08] we do this or how do we steal this paper
[1:30:10] how do we get and and then the
[1:30:12] government has to change the dollar bill
[1:30:14] again has to change the hundred dollar
[1:30:16] bill nobody counterfeits a dollar but a
[1:30:18] hundred dollar bill so they have to they
[1:30:21] have to figure out a different way to
[1:30:22] make the $100 bill less counterfeit able
[1:30:25] and then I started thinking but God
[1:30:28] doesn't do that God never changes the
[1:30:32] work even though there's millions of
[1:30:34] counterfeits out there today - God's
[1:30:36] Word God never changes the word God does
[1:30:40] not have to bring anything of a
[1:30:42] progressive nature on his word his word
[1:30:45] is what it is now the Bible says if this
[1:30:49] word is hid it is hid from those that
[1:30:51] are lost so if those are counterfeiting
[1:30:55] it that word for those who who received
[1:30:59] that counterfeit and believe it accept
[1:31:01] that counterfeit that means that the
[1:31:03] real was not for them to begin with they
[1:31:07] accepted received the counterfeit as it
[1:31:10] is which is of no value the $100
[1:31:14] counterfeit bill in this world today is
[1:31:16] of no value the counterfeit gospel is of
[1:31:20] no value because it doesn't have what it
[1:31:24] doesn't have the
[1:31:25] of God and if it's counterfeit it will
[1:31:29] not have the backing of God why is a
[1:31:31] piece of paper that looks just like $100
[1:31:34] bill but counterfeit not worth anything
[1:31:36] because it's not backed by our
[1:31:38] government of course again I don't think
[1:31:41] the real is anymore anyway but again
[1:31:43] that's beside the point
[1:31:44] the counterfeit is not backed by the
[1:31:47] government the counterfeit gospel is not
[1:31:50] backed by God it's not backed by God
[1:31:53] it's worthless out there who's preaching
[1:31:55] it I don't hear care whose mouth that's
[1:31:57] coming out of it's worthless but God
[1:32:00] doesn't have to change his two draws two
[1:32:03] counterfeiters because he knows the
[1:32:06] counterfeiters are there to throw up
[1:32:08] those that work predestinated to receive
[1:32:13] the real but if you're real and you're
[1:32:19] predestinated a counterfeit won't do a
[1:32:23] counterfeit is not good enough right if
[1:32:27] it's a counterfeit gospel there's got to
[1:32:30] be a lot of stuff made up about it a lot
[1:32:32] of stuff that they have to try to
[1:32:35] produce to manufacture to make it look
[1:32:37] like something to try to make it produce
[1:32:39] into something try to muscle up her or
[1:32:42] try to rile you up into some kind of
[1:32:45] emotion but that's not what the gospel
[1:32:48] is about the gospel is about the purity
[1:32:51] of the word of your relationship with
[1:32:52] him that's the gospel
[1:32:55] people counterfeit it but what does that
[1:32:58] produce in Matthew chapter 4 let me read
[1:33:02] this through fairly quickly because
[1:33:05] again Satan in the Garden Feed showed
[1:33:08] his Trinity of deception he does the
[1:33:10] same thing when he meets Jesus
[1:33:11] face-to-face look here now then was
[1:33:14] Jesus led up of the Spirit of the
[1:33:15] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[1:33:17] that was the purpose of the Spirit
[1:33:19] leading Jesus into the world whom the
[1:33:21] purpose was for him to be tempted of the
[1:33:23] devil and people said I don't want to be
[1:33:25] tempted well Jesus was purposely led by
[1:33:28] the spirit and people want to say that
[1:33:31] but it's the truth
[1:33:33] but remember his will won't lead you
[1:33:37] where his grace can camp amen you may be
[1:33:40] it it may not be the easiest road to
[1:33:42] take but gotta be there wins when he had
[1:33:46] fasted forty days 40 nights he was
[1:33:48] afterward 200 and the tempter came up to
[1:33:50] him he said a gift thou be the Son of
[1:33:52] God there we go down remember the first
[1:33:55] thing he tries to do to you is to get
[1:33:58] you to doubt first thing if there's
[1:34:02] doubt coming is the devil
[1:34:04] period God doesn't cause you to kind of
[1:34:07] doubt the word Satan does if thou be the
[1:34:10] Son of God command that these stones be
[1:34:13] made bread and when he answered him he
[1:34:16] said is written man shall not live by
[1:34:17] bread alone but by every word of the 13
[1:34:19] mm of God how did he defeat the enemy
[1:34:21] with the word and then the devil taking
[1:34:24] them up into the holy city now Satan's
[1:34:26] not and he's not an idiot
[1:34:28] so look what his now God doesn't change
[1:34:32] his word ever stays the same but look at
[1:34:34] Satan trying to progress himself in his
[1:34:38] deception of Jesus the second is in the
[1:34:41] devil takes him up into the holy city
[1:34:43] set up in middle of pinnacle and Satan
[1:34:45] said unto him if thou be the Son God
[1:34:48] again he's trying to get him to down but
[1:34:51] look at what he says now cast thyself
[1:34:54] down for it is written
[1:34:57] now Satan's trying to bring a
[1:34:59] progressive gospel to try to deceive the
[1:35:03] word Jesus with the word he ups his game
[1:35:09] if you will he steps it up a bit because
[1:35:13] he realizes that Jesus is defeating him
[1:35:17] with the word so what does he counteract
[1:35:20] that with the word he says catus lights
[1:35:24] up for it is written he shall give his
[1:35:27] angels charge concerning thee and in
[1:35:29] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[1:35:31] at any time thou dash thy foot against
[1:35:33] the soul that's the word amen in songs
[1:35:39] jesus said unto him it is written again
[1:35:43] or it is also written thou shalt not
[1:35:46] tempt the LORD thy God now this reminds
[1:35:49] me of of a snake handling church is back
[1:35:53] east
[1:35:54] you think well there's still some of
[1:35:55] those yes there are they're probably
[1:35:57] from what I know they're all in the
[1:35:59] south back east they actually literally
[1:36:01] had it's poisonous snakes in the church
[1:36:03] boxes of them and they pulled him out
[1:36:04] and they handle them to earn church
[1:36:05] service many people have been bitten and
[1:36:07] killed because of it but they actually
[1:36:09] literally do that I don't think there's
[1:36:11] many of them whether but what they do is
[1:36:13] they manipulate and they pervert God's
[1:36:15] Word like Satan just did Satan just
[1:36:18] perverted God's Word that's God's Word
[1:36:21] but he's misusing it
[1:36:23] that's like those people misuse mark 16
[1:36:26] which says you can take up a serpent and
[1:36:28] it will harm you right now I believe
[1:36:32] just like I tell you I was going to tell
[1:36:35] you about the service today I believe
[1:36:37] and that this is my revelation this is
[1:36:40] what God has showed me I believe that in
[1:36:44] the service of the Lord God protects his
[1:36:47] own that's why I call this service in
[1:36:50] the service and we are here in the
[1:36:53] service of the Lord we're not doing this
[1:36:55] selfishly we're not doing this close
[1:36:57] trying to gain something or we're doing
[1:36:59] this in service for the Lord that's why
[1:37:01] we are here today when Paul was was
[1:37:05] going around preaching the gospel and he
[1:37:08] got to these barbarians and he was there
[1:37:10] at night with a fire and I asked common
[1:37:12] struck him in the hand I think a baby I
[1:37:16] gave this analogy the other day and he
[1:37:18] that snake struck him on the hand and
[1:37:21] then these barbarians thought he was a
[1:37:23] devil and they weren't listening to it
[1:37:25] but when that snake come and struck him
[1:37:28] in the hand he looked at it he just
[1:37:30] shook it off in the fire mark 16 they'll
[1:37:33] take up serpents and won't harm them in
[1:37:35] this situation Paul is in the service of
[1:37:39] the Lord and in doing a service for the
[1:37:42] Lord Satan tried to come and take him
[1:37:44] away to take him out and he killed him
[1:37:46] and that snake come and grab the meat
[1:37:48] just shook it off on the fire he just
[1:37:50] kept talking they looked upon him and
[1:37:52] said oldest devil he's going to die any
[1:37:54] minute that was a you know that's one of
[1:37:57] the most venomous snakes there are he's
[1:37:58] gonna die any moment they were just
[1:38:00] waiting just watching waiting for him to
[1:38:02] die he just shook it off the fire he
[1:38:05] kept going so when Paul didn't die the
[1:38:08] men that were there looking at him
[1:38:10] thinking he was a devil now thought he
[1:38:11] was a God because he shook off this
[1:38:14] poisonous snake but that was in the
[1:38:16] service of the Lord now Paul had gone
[1:38:18] over and said well you know what I'm
[1:38:20] just gonna tip the Lord I just picked
[1:38:21] the snake up and you know that's a
[1:38:23] misapplication of God's Word Satan is
[1:38:26] miss applying God's Word yes
[1:38:29] so Jesus uses the word to Cammisa
[1:38:32] plication it is written thou shalt not
[1:38:36] tempt the LORD thy God we're here today
[1:38:39] not in the purpose serving the purpose
[1:38:43] to tempt the Lord we're not here to say
[1:38:46] I defy hoping not to know we're in a
[1:38:49] service and in the service for the Lord
[1:38:52] I believe no everybody
[1:38:55] a revelation that's up to them I don't
[1:38:56] look down on anybody thinks different
[1:38:58] than I do and and I trusted trade they
[1:39:01] don't look down on me but my revelation
[1:39:03] is in the service pool of war God's
[1:39:05] going to take care of God's gonna
[1:39:07] protect us and can I give you this bit
[1:39:10] of information if God desired to take me
[1:39:12] he wants to take me right now if he's
[1:39:14] done with me I'm gonna be better off
[1:39:16] anyway I'm not scared to die right but
[1:39:20] anyway that that's that's beside the
[1:39:22] point but you understand the mist
[1:39:24] application of the work here that saint
[1:39:26] is he's moved his game up to use the
[1:39:28] word but he's miss applying it and Jesus
[1:39:30] corrected it now the third time Satan
[1:39:33] doesn't even try to get him to doubt
[1:39:34] first time get him to doubt second time
[1:39:38] he's hydrating the word how to be
[1:39:40] hydrated now he said exactly what the
[1:39:42] word said but the hybrid ation here is
[1:39:44] the Miss applying the primer that's the
[1:39:47] hybrid ation of the word in this
[1:39:49] situation again the devil taketh him up
[1:39:51] into the seating high mountains short of
[1:39:53] all the demons of the world the glory of
[1:39:54] them and said unto him all these things
[1:39:57] will I give the Intel about that will
[1:40:00] fall down and worship me then say of
[1:40:03] Jesus unto him get thee get the hint
[1:40:06] Satan for it is written thou shalt
[1:40:07] worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:40:09] shalt thou serve
[1:40:10] now notice each time as Satan progresses
[1:40:14] in his revelation in his message in his
[1:40:18] doubt hybrid new new word Jesus uses the
[1:40:22] word every single time he doesn't
[1:40:26] progress he doesn't change he just uses
[1:40:29] a different part of the word to attack
[1:40:31] the part that was being brought to him
[1:40:33] at the time
[1:40:34] Jesus didn't change it is written it is
[1:40:37] written it is written and he just read
[1:40:39] today will defeat the enemy on every
[1:40:41] ground today just like it did did in the
[1:40:44] mouths of believers that work will
[1:40:46] produce exactly what it said amen
[1:40:50] today as it always has it'll do the same
[1:40:53] thing today because it's still God's
[1:40:55] Word so let's not be we're not ignorant
[1:40:59] but let us not be dull of recognizing
[1:41:03] when that enemy is coming in and he'll
[1:41:07] come in like a flood we know the Bible
[1:41:08] said you come in like a flood friend you
[1:41:11] accommodate you make a step towards God
[1:41:13] you do something else for the Lord you
[1:41:16] make a move and or church or wherever
[1:41:19] and you make that step though
[1:41:22] you just expect those those balls he's
[1:41:25] gonna be lobbing those bombs at you
[1:41:28] Satan's gonna be lobbing those bombs
[1:41:30] that you match again he's gonna try to
[1:41:32] get you to doubt he's gonna kind of try
[1:41:34] to change it from you and try to
[1:41:36] hybridize it there from you or something
[1:41:38] in amen all this counterfeit
[1:41:42] anti messy stuff is nothing but a lot of
[1:41:44] us but it's backed by what a man's
[1:41:47] opinion a man's idea there's a prophet
[1:41:51] of God backed up and vindicated by God
[1:41:54] not by man and what he did and what he
[1:41:57] said and God vindicated and backed it up
[1:41:59] with words the vindication for all this
[1:42:02] other there's no vindication it's just
[1:42:06] their own word it's just their own
[1:42:07] opinion but God all doesn't change God's
[1:42:12] not gonna God doesn't have to up his his
[1:42:17] way of doing things
[1:42:19] he does have to progress it is the same
[1:42:22] and it defeats him every time he meant
[1:42:25] on every level every time praise the
[1:42:28] Lord Amen god bless you today amen I
[1:42:31] pray someone said the bless you
[1:42:33] today in some way Amen god bless you on
[1:42:37] the streaming better turn the streaming
[1:42:38] off now for just a few moments now
[1:42:45] there's a couple things that I wanted to
[1:42:47] mention to you I know I did a little
