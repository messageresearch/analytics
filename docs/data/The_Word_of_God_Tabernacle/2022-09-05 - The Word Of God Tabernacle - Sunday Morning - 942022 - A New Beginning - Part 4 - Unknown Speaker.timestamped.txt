[40:26] we pray
[40:27] amen amen amen
[40:29] amen
[40:31] genesis chapter one verses one and two
[40:34] amen
[40:37] in the beginning god created the heaven
[40:39] and the earth and the earth was without
[40:40] form and void and darkness was upon the
[40:42] face of the deep the spirit of god moved
[40:45] upon the face of the waters amen you
[40:47] could be seated if you'd like
[40:52] i'm gonna go over to back to leviticus
[40:55] chapter 23 where we left off last week
[41:01] and we want to uh
[41:03] bring in some of the types
[41:05] shadows from the old testament uh
[41:08] from the the jewish feasts as we had uh
[41:11] entered into or talked about last week
[41:14] that seventh feast that last
[41:16] feast entering into that eighth day and
[41:19] entering into that rest the rest that
[41:21] the lord promised us the rest that we
[41:24] looked to that
[41:25] god showed us after the andalumian flood
[41:28] with the naming of noah which meant rest
[41:30] and of course when jesus came in that
[41:32] next new beginning and he said come on
[41:35] unto me all you labor heavy laden and
[41:37] i'll give you rest and we know of course
[41:39] we're heading to a place a millennium
[41:42] that is a thousand years of rest and
[41:44] it's a rest period we know we'll be
[41:47] planting and building and things like
[41:49] that but it'll still be a rest why will
[41:51] it be a rest because our adversary will
[41:53] be chained a thousand years you'll have
[41:56] we'll have no tempter then
[41:58] amen will be a time of rest to be a time
[42:00] of reprieve that the lord gives us that
[42:03] thousand years the breaking of that
[42:04] original sin that man lives on this
[42:07] earth a thousand years still a period of
[42:10] time
[42:10] a type of the finishing of that seventh
[42:13] day before it enters into that eighth
[42:15] day rest that perfect rest amen of the
[42:18] eighth day but it is a it is that rest
[42:21] period that we have amen and showing us
[42:23] today that we should have that rest
[42:26] today because our rest is the holy ghost
[42:28] yeah we rest in the holy ghost if you've
[42:30] been born again you have the spirit of
[42:32] god or the holy ghost god lives in you
[42:35] then you have that rest because you know
[42:37] that you have that
[42:39] that assurance that as god has sealed
[42:41] that holy spirit in you and he has
[42:43] sealed the devil out you are sealed
[42:45] until your eternal destination well if
[42:47] you're sealed by the holy ghost and
[42:48] god's gave you that promise and accepted
[42:50] you then we know that we
[42:53] essentially as brother branham taught us
[42:55] are already there
[42:57] amen by god's promise we can believe now
[43:00] if god's not as good as his word then we
[43:02] can't trust in that but if god is as
[43:04] good as his promised word then we can
[43:06] trust and believe as his word has told
[43:08] us that as he has sealed us that we are
[43:10] there we rest in that
[43:12] that's our rest
[43:13] don't matter what goes on what the satan
[43:16] tries to do what the devil the turmoil
[43:18] all the things of the world brother tom
[43:20] and his prayer and the world is falling
[43:21] and it's turned upside down and
[43:23] and a world that has fallen apart he
[43:25] used to preach a message the world
[43:27] falling apart uh that message has
[43:30] changed it has become a world fallen
[43:32] apart it is past tense now it has fallen
[43:36] apart but regardless of that we rest
[43:39] we're rested and we rest in his word we
[43:41] rest in his promise because he's given
[43:43] us that rest that we know that
[43:45] romans 8 28 all things work together for
[43:49] our good because we love him amen that's
[43:52] our arrest now getting into these these
[43:55] these feast days going back to the first
[43:58] now i know we talked about the feast of
[43:59] the tabernacles last week and the last
[44:02] one that brought us into that eighth day
[44:04] and that rest but i want to go back to
[44:06] the first and look through uh these
[44:09] feasts to type them not only to
[44:12] uh those as the theme of ours messages
[44:15] here is the new beginning and like i
[44:17] said this is the new beginning part four
[44:20] uh but it's also a typing of the uh from
[44:24] from god showing us
[44:26] in these feasts what he was going to do
[44:29] and what he has done for us his gentile
[44:32] bride
[44:33] every one of these feasts is a type of
[44:35] christ every one of them
[44:37] god giving these feasts to the to the
[44:40] jews so that
[44:42] they could see that what they were doing
[44:44] was going to happen to us in a spiritual
[44:48] uh in a spiritual sense god's sending
[44:50] his own son jesus so uh as we read this
[44:54] let's look for just a second now these
[44:56] feasts
[44:57] a feast
[44:59] basically means
[45:00] the meanings obviously changed over time
[45:04] we think of a feast today it's probably
[45:06] a little different than what
[45:08] god is giving them as a feast
[45:11] it is not necessarily a time to come
[45:13] together with cakes and cookies and
[45:16] candy and celebration of balloons and uh
[45:20] the kind of feast that we think about
[45:21] today
[45:22] but uh gorging on food or something like
[45:25] that uh these feasts that god give to
[45:28] them was was for a sacredness
[45:31] it was for a sacred season a sacred
[45:34] period a sacred time and a sacred place
[45:37] that that god had that it was to be an
[45:40] honor
[45:41] that god was going to honor his children
[45:43] and his children were going gonna honor
[45:45] him through these feasts so as we say
[45:48] feast and we think in our minds it's not
[45:51] that
[45:51] uh
[45:52] that type of feast
[45:54] it's it's something that god set aside
[45:57] for them to be a sacred period uh a
[46:00] sacred period of time or place and and
[46:03] uh and season for them
[46:05] uh so let's as we go through them let's
[46:07] look we'll go through one at a time
[46:10] and
[46:11] and see how they
[46:12] typify christ and how they show us uh
[46:17] christ in in us and in
[46:20] through the church ages and where we are
[46:21] today amen now um
[46:24] let's just go down to the fourth verse
[46:26] the first three verses just talks about
[46:28] god telling moses to tell them about the
[46:30] feast
[46:32] but in the first feast
[46:34] is the feast of the passover
[46:37] god says these are the feasts of the
[46:39] lord even holy convocations we talked
[46:41] about what that holy convocation was
[46:44] remember it's a holy gathering a sacred
[46:47] gathering holy place
[46:49] consecrated of god consecrated of his
[46:52] people
[46:53] of that convocation it's a gathering
[46:55] together of people together like-minded
[46:58] people amen just like there's the
[47:00] gathering that's going on today there's
[47:02] a gathering going on right now i know
[47:04] there'll be a gathering on the other
[47:05] side for him but there's a gathering
[47:06] right now
[47:08] and it's not the gathering in the word
[47:09] of god tabernacle or in tucson or in the
[47:12] united states it's a gathering
[47:13] internationally of god's bride under the
[47:16] auspice of the shed blood of christ
[47:18] that gathering is going on right now
[47:20] holy convocation
[47:23] uh even holy convocations which ye shall
[47:26] proclaim in their seasons and the 14th
[47:29] day of the first month at even
[47:32] is the lord's passover now the passover
[47:35] we could obviously understand
[47:37] and recognize
[47:38] the passover the paschal lamb typifying
[47:42] jesus christ of course but it also
[47:44] becomes the foundation
[47:47] upon all of what these feasts were based
[47:49] on and all of what the christians
[47:52] experience is in
[47:54] our whole experience is based in the
[47:56] typification of this passover christ
[47:59] being our paschal lamb as redemption to
[48:02] us
[48:03] it is that redemption christ is our
[48:06] passover it is redemption to us man and
[48:09] regardless of anything else
[48:12] statue of a perfect man or walking with
[48:14] god or coming to church or whatever you
[48:16] do in your life
[48:17] without redemption none of it matters
[48:21] you go nowhere with god if there weren't
[48:24] first redemption
[48:26] because redemption is what brought us
[48:28] back to him
[48:29] it was redeeming us back remember the
[48:32] old pawnshop redeeming us back to our
[48:35] proper position
[48:36] mankind had fallen from where it was
[48:39] supposed to be in god's original
[48:41] creation the garden of eden redemption
[48:43] was to bring man back to redeem him back
[48:46] to that place it's a place or a state of
[48:50] of god performing the act of
[48:53] perpetuation
[48:54] you may have heard me say several times
[48:57] uh of that act of perpetuation think
[48:59] well what brother you what is what does
[49:01] that mean to perpetuate it means that
[49:04] you're taking someone else's place
[49:07] the act of perpetuation means that god
[49:11] took our place
[49:13] in the act of redemption that god showed
[49:16] to them through the process of the bulls
[49:18] and goats he showed us through sending
[49:21] his only son jesus christ to bring
[49:23] redemption to us so that that
[49:26] perpetuation would come and he would
[49:29] take our place
[49:31] not only would he take our place but he
[49:33] took our place so we could take his yes
[49:37] amen
[49:38] he took our place he became our
[49:40] perpetuation he went to calgary for us
[49:43] he take he took our sins upon himself
[49:47] he became that sacrificial lamb he
[49:50] became that passover that paschal lamb
[49:53] and perpetuated for us
[49:56] so that we now in his place could be
[49:59] robed in his righteousness without a
[50:01] spot wrinkle or blemish
[50:03] you think how could this bribe how could
[50:06] we humans if we go through this life
[50:08] end up at the end of this without a spot
[50:11] wrinkle or blemish
[50:12] walk through this life
[50:14] without a single accusation
[50:18] against you
[50:19] satan will certainly try to but there's
[50:21] not an accusation laid to your feet
[50:25] laid to god's feet of you
[50:27] because it's been annihilated
[50:30] he has perpetuated that
[50:33] the passover the redemption
[50:36] the the the taking of our place the
[50:39] taking of our sin
[50:41] means that we now
[50:43] are are in his place
[50:45] road in his righteousness well in his
[50:48] righteousness there are no spots
[50:51] in his righteousness there are no
[50:53] wrinkles there are no blemishes well if
[50:56] we're standing
[50:57] robed in his righteousness and friend
[50:59] you are just as
[51:01] righteous as god is righteous amen
[51:04] because we're in his righteousness
[51:05] through this and without that friend
[51:08] none of the other christian experience
[51:10] matters
[51:11] without redemption
[51:12] without that passover without that
[51:14] paschal lamb without him having taken
[51:17] our place
[51:18] then none of it would matter
[51:20] we'd still all be sinners we would still
[51:23] all be
[51:24] a
[51:25] cannon fodder headed to hell
[51:27] if he had not come and redeemed us and
[51:30] took our place that that paschal lamb it
[51:33] took our place that redemption that
[51:35] redeemed us to ourselves now look at
[51:37] this as we climb upward
[51:39] the very next day
[51:42] okay
[51:43] this is to me this is beautiful because
[51:45] it's the very next day
[51:47] notice the first day is the 14th first
[51:50] of the month
[51:51] of first month 14th day but now on the
[51:54] 15th day
[51:56] the very next day
[51:58] is the feast of unleavened bread
[52:01] which means the communion and fellowship
[52:04] that we have with the lord
[52:06] redemption brought fellowship
[52:09] praise god
[52:11] the very next day
[52:13] it didn't take months after he redeemed
[52:15] you it didn't take years after he
[52:17] redeemed you when he regains you you
[52:19] come in complete fellowship with him
[52:21] right then
[52:22] the very next day
[52:24] praise the lord let's read it on the
[52:26] 15th day of the same month is the feast
[52:29] of unleavened bread and that is of
[52:30] course
[52:31] tip of pfizer represents our communion
[52:34] or our fellowship with him amen you know
[52:37] a lot of times i i don't i don't
[52:39] actually call our as we call communion
[52:42] service communion i call it the lord's
[52:43] supper
[52:44] because really communion's not
[52:47] uh
[52:48] taking of the bread or the wine in just
[52:50] one two three four days out of the year
[52:52] communion with us and fellowship with us
[52:54] with him is every day
[52:57] every moment every second we have is
[53:00] fellowship and communion with the lord
[53:02] jesus
[53:03] with your mind with your heart with your
[53:05] mouth his fellowship is continual
[53:08] communion with the lord this unleavened
[53:10] bread just represents the oneness that
[53:13] we've come together with him in a union
[53:15] amen now there's a greater oneness
[53:17] through these that we're going to talk
[53:18] about but that's the beginning of it
[53:21] god redeems you to have fellowship with
[53:24] you god brought you back where you were
[53:26] supposed to be because god couldn't have
[53:27] it or never in the garden of eden when
[53:29] man failed god could no longer come to
[53:31] adam with life to ear there was a great
[53:33] castle between god and man
[53:35] that great chasm that was thrown that
[53:37] sin chasm that was thrown between god
[53:39] and man god was no longer able to come
[53:42] even with the sheepskin on and speak
[53:44] lift the ear like he did with adam
[53:46] before that
[53:47] couldn't no longer do it so there had to
[53:49] be that perfect perpetuation that bloody
[53:52] bridge that that bridged that gap so man
[53:55] and god could come back in fellowship
[53:57] again this was a beautiful time saint
[54:00] to understand it that we now have the
[54:02] ability to be able to have that type of
[54:04] communion and fellowship with the lord
[54:06] again
[54:07] praise the
[54:08] lord in the first day you shall have a
[54:11] holy complication shall do no several
[54:13] work therein but ye shall offer an
[54:15] offering made by fire unto the lord
[54:17] seven days in the seventh day is a holy
[54:20] convocation ye shall do no several work
[54:22] therein now third one now this is the
[54:25] main thing i really want to get to
[54:28] uh the third and fourth for
[54:30] probably most of the rest of this
[54:32] service
[54:33] ninth verse and the lord spake unto
[54:36] moses say
[54:38] speak unto the children of israel and
[54:40] say unto them
[54:42] when you come into the land which i give
[54:44] unto you and shall reap the harvest
[54:46] thereof then ye shall bring a sheaf of
[54:49] the firstfruits of your harvest unto the
[54:51] priest now there's the there's the
[54:54] redemption the passover there's the uh
[54:58] the fellowship the feast of unleavened
[55:00] bread the communion together
[55:03] now there's the now those were specific
[55:05] months now you notice here there's not a
[55:08] specific month or day
[55:10] god's just telling here now when you
[55:12] come into the land that i have promised
[55:14] you when you have planted and reached
[55:17] your first harvest
[55:19] you take of the reaping of the first of
[55:21] that first harvest
[55:23] you bundle it together and you offer it
[55:26] as a waving
[55:28] by the priest before the lord as a
[55:30] thanksgiving to god as an offering to
[55:33] god for the blessings and the
[55:35] bountifulness that he has given you and
[55:38] the harvest
[55:39] now that first fruit is only the first
[55:42] one that came to maturity
[55:44] wasn't the entire harvest it was just
[55:46] the first to come to maturity now look
[55:49] it doesn't say a day or time
[55:52] but it says
[55:54] at the at the time when that comes to
[55:58] maturity
[55:59] when it comes to the place that this
[56:01] harvest has reached a place of maturity
[56:04] or that part of the harvest as you begin
[56:06] to reap it that harvest that's come to a
[56:09] place of maturity a place that that that
[56:12] wheat or whatever it is can be
[56:14] a processed and eaten
[56:18] maturity
[56:21] i give to you shall reap the heart then
[56:23] shall you bring a sheaf
[56:26] of the first fruits of your harvest unto
[56:28] the priest now the first fruits is just
[56:30] simply again that part of that harvest
[56:32] that has come to maturity it has come to
[56:35] a place that it can be eaten come to a
[56:37] place that it can be of use
[56:39] amen just like if uh
[56:42] if you go to a citrus tree here or an
[56:45] apple tree or something you see a uh one
[56:48] hanging from a branch you look at it and
[56:50] say well that's not right you're not
[56:52] gonna pick it because it's not right
[56:54] many times joel will go around into our
[56:56] apartments and we have orange trees and
[56:59] grapefruit trees and we'll look at it
[57:01] and uh you'll look say well that that's
[57:03] not ready to be picked yet
[57:04] we'll look to say that's not mature that
[57:07] fruit's not ready to be eaten but when
[57:09] it gets to the place that it's ready to
[57:11] be eaten that's when you can pluck it
[57:13] cut it eat it
[57:15] that first fruit is just the one that
[57:17] came to maturity first the first one
[57:20] that came to that place now sheep is
[57:21] just simply
[57:23] a a taking of those first fruits
[57:26] and a binding of those together we just
[57:29] say the stalks of wheat biting those
[57:31] together loosely binding those together
[57:34] each one of the stalks all separate
[57:36] stalks now but they're bound together
[57:39] with a with a common thread
[57:42] oh with with a common rope or whatever
[57:43] it was they bound them with they bound
[57:45] these sheaves loosely bound together was
[57:48] that sheep
[57:49] and that sheath
[57:52] he shall wave the sheath before the lord
[57:55] to be accepted for you on the morrow
[57:57] after the after the sabbath the priest
[58:00] shall waive it wave it before the lord
[58:03] amen as a thanksgiving to the lord thank
[58:06] you lord for this harvest we give this
[58:08] sheaf back to you lord as i thank you
[58:10] for what you've done for us it's a sort
[58:12] of a type even of tithing that the lord
[58:14] has blessed you and you give a small
[58:16] portion of it back as god has blessed
[58:18] you you say lord i give this back to you
[58:20] this is an honor to you and this is the
[58:22] thanks to you for what you've done for
[58:24] me
[58:25] what you've done for my family what
[58:27] you've done for us lord i'm just
[58:29] offering this back to you and the priest
[58:31] takes it and he waves it amen
[58:34] you say well the priests don't need it
[58:36] doesn't matter what the precedes that's
[58:38] god's directions god says take it and
[58:40] it's for the priest to do
[58:42] it's his instruction to take it he's
[58:44] just the facilitator of it amen the
[58:46] advantage between the people and god the
[58:49] priest is the facilitator to take in way
[58:51] before the lord and say okay god this
[58:53] and it became a sweet smelling savior to
[58:56] god
[58:57] because it was a representation of our
[58:59] honoring to god and our thankfulness for
[59:02] what god has done for us amen we do it
[59:04] today we offer up spiritual sacrifices
[59:07] to the lord all the time
[59:09] the first to come to maturity now let's
[59:11] finish this because it was the first to
[59:14] come to maturity even in this day that
[59:17] we live
[59:19] amen way before the lord
[59:22] to be accepted for you on the morrow at
[59:23] the the the after the sabbath the priest
[59:26] shall wave it and ye shall offer now
[59:28] look at the rest of this offering okay
[59:30] because the wave sheet the first to come
[59:32] to maturity we know was jesus
[59:34] amen was was way before the lord for the
[59:37] people amen he was hung up on the cross
[59:40] of calvary came to
[59:42] maturity first he was just the first one
[59:45] he was just the first fruits the the one
[59:47] that was the representative of it now
[59:50] we're going to talk about that in a
[59:51] minute because
[59:52] actually this first fruit
[59:54] represents the resurrection
[59:56] uh the resurrection of the seed that had
[59:59] been
[1:00:00] buried in the ground and come forth and
[1:00:02] raised up
[1:00:03] it was a typification of jesus christ
[1:00:06] who was the first one jesus christ was
[1:00:09] he was the first one to raise but notice
[1:00:11] this we're going to continue reading
[1:00:13] of the other that god
[1:00:16] gave to them
[1:00:18] so that we could see today the
[1:00:20] significance of christ and and what god
[1:00:23] was doing even for them back in
[1:00:25] leviticus
[1:00:26] for the showing of the coming of christ
[1:00:29] his only son look here now
[1:00:32] and yeshua 12 first and ye shall offer
[1:00:34] that day
[1:00:36] when you wave the sheath and he lamb
[1:00:38] without blemish of the first year for a
[1:00:40] burnt offering unto the lord also
[1:00:43] typification of christ
[1:00:45] and the meat offering thereof shall be
[1:00:48] too tense deal of fine flour again same
[1:00:52] mingled mingled look at this now this
[1:00:55] fine flower is now mingled with oil
[1:00:58] the sheath look at the sheath
[1:01:00] the sheath was
[1:01:02] binding together a loosely binding
[1:01:04] together of individual stalks they
[1:01:06] became one unit but they were still all
[1:01:08] individual stocks
[1:01:10] notice the fine flour the fine flour is
[1:01:13] simply mingled with oil what do we know
[1:01:15] oil is
[1:01:16] oil is the holy ghost represented in the
[1:01:19] scripture oil is the holy spirit this
[1:01:21] fine flower is simply mingled with that
[1:01:24] oil
[1:01:25] okay now an offering made by fire unto
[1:01:28] the lord for a sweet savior and the
[1:01:29] drink offering
[1:01:31] shall
[1:01:32] thereof shall be of wine the fourth part
[1:01:34] of an hen
[1:01:36] and ye shall eat neither bread nor parts
[1:01:38] corn nor green ears until the self same
[1:01:40] day that you have brought an offering
[1:01:42] unto your god it shall be a statute
[1:01:44] forever throughout your generations in
[1:01:46] all your dwellings now
[1:01:48] this
[1:01:50] raising from the dead
[1:01:52] this sea that was in the ground that
[1:01:54] came forth that was given to the lord
[1:01:57] that was
[1:01:58] showing
[1:01:59] the the resurrection
[1:02:02] brings us to first corinthians i've got
[1:02:04] a couple scriptures i want to read hold
[1:02:06] your place so we're going back to
[1:02:07] leviticus 23 but i got a couple
[1:02:09] scriptures i want to read before we get
[1:02:11] back there first corinthians
[1:02:15] chapter 15.
[1:02:20] first corinthians chapter 15. now
[1:02:23] there's so many associate scriptures
[1:02:27] that really goes in the new testament
[1:02:30] with these feast days
[1:02:32] um and i could have taken three or four
[1:02:35] sundays and probably brought every one
[1:02:37] of them out
[1:02:38] uh but i just picked one or two here or
[1:02:41] there to try to hit some highlights of
[1:02:43] it and help and maybe if you
[1:02:46] watch it later write some notes or go
[1:02:48] back and study you can look and see for
[1:02:50] yourself but now in first corinthians
[1:02:53] chapter 15
[1:02:55] 20th verse
[1:02:57] first corinthians 15 20. but now is
[1:03:00] christ risen from the dead
[1:03:03] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:03:05] slept
[1:03:06] amen christ the firstfruits what the
[1:03:10] first one to come to maturity
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:13] for since by man came death by man came
[1:03:16] also the resurrection of the dead
[1:03:19] for as in adam all die even so in christ
[1:03:22] shall all be made alive why because he's
[1:03:24] the first fruits
[1:03:26] of them that sleep
[1:03:28] bringing life resurrection
[1:03:31] but every man in his own order christ
[1:03:34] the first fruits
[1:03:35] afterward
[1:03:37] they that are christ at his coming
[1:03:40] he was just the first the first of many
[1:03:43] to come along behind him
[1:03:45] so he rose from the dead
[1:03:48] but he rose from the dead for what
[1:03:49] purpose
[1:03:50] because we were in him because heroes we
[1:03:53] rose with him amen first thessalonians
[1:03:56] chapter 4
[1:03:59] first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not
[1:04:01] have you to be ignorant brother
[1:04:02] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:04:04] you saw not even as others which have no
[1:04:06] hope for if we believe that jesus died
[1:04:09] and rose again even so them also would
[1:04:12] sleep in jesus will god bring with him
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:16] god didn't have to do that
[1:04:18] he's god he did it for us
[1:04:21] he became the first fruits for us he
[1:04:24] took our sin for for us it all that he
[1:04:28] did was for us
[1:04:30] it's amazing it seems like how selfish
[1:04:32] humanity has gotten today then almost
[1:04:34] everything we seem to do anymore is for
[1:04:37] ourselves
[1:04:38] or for at least at the most for our four
[1:04:41] or r4 no more
[1:04:43] but every single thing that jesus did he
[1:04:46] did for you yeah he did for others he
[1:04:49] did for us he became the first fruits
[1:04:51] not for himself but for us
[1:04:55] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:04:56] rose again amen even so then which also
[1:04:59] sleep in jesus will god bring with him
[1:05:02] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:05:04] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:05:05] remaining to the coming of the lord
[1:05:07] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:05:09] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:05:11] heaven with a shout of the voice of the
[1:05:12] archangel the trump of god the dead of
[1:05:14] christ shall rise first amen why because
[1:05:17] he already has risen
[1:05:19] because he's risen we are risen
[1:05:23] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:05:25] be caught up uh shall be caught up
[1:05:26] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:05:28] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:05:30] be with the lord
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:33] that
[1:05:35] fruit that first fruit feast
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:40] first to maturity the first to resurrect
[1:05:44] the first to come forth but now look
[1:05:47] even in that
[1:05:49] the wave sheet
[1:05:53] god takes it a step further
[1:05:55] we go from redemption to communion to
[1:05:58] first fruit from
[1:06:00] from
[1:06:03] not even being
[1:06:04] a people
[1:06:06] to god taking
[1:06:08] and redeeming us to himself
[1:06:11] having communion and fellowshipping with
[1:06:14] us
[1:06:15] and dying and raising from the dead for
[1:06:17] us so that we could raise with him amen
[1:06:21] but now look what happens after the
[1:06:22] feast of the first fruits 15th verse
[1:06:25] the fourth one now
[1:06:27] the fourth feast is the feast of the
[1:06:30] waveloads the feast of the wavelobes
[1:06:33] fifteenth first and ye shall count unto
[1:06:35] you from the morrow after the sabbath
[1:06:38] from the day that ye brought the sheep
[1:06:40] of the wave offering
[1:06:42] seven sabbaths shall be complete
[1:06:44] seven sabbaths shall be complete now
[1:06:47] that means that from the time now let's
[1:06:50] read it again ye shall count unto you
[1:06:52] from the day of the morrow after the
[1:06:54] sabbath now that's when the when the
[1:06:56] priest here
[1:06:58] on the tomorrow 11th first after the
[1:07:00] sabbath she the the priest shall waive
[1:07:03] it
[1:07:03] okay now in the feast of the waveloaves
[1:07:07] there's still not a month
[1:07:09] there's still not a day
[1:07:11] but look at the timing of it
[1:07:13] after that she count unto you for
[1:07:15] tomorrow after the sabbath from the day
[1:07:17] after the at the you brought the sheep
[1:07:19] of the wave offering
[1:07:20] seven sabbaths are complete
[1:07:23] so 49 days
[1:07:25] basically is what god's telling them
[1:07:27] this from the beginning to the end is 49
[1:07:30] days seven sabbath shall bring this to a
[1:07:33] completion
[1:07:34] and immediately after that remember now
[1:07:37] 49 or the sabbath
[1:07:40] is
[1:07:41] is the ending of the week
[1:07:44] but our eighth day eternity our new
[1:07:48] beginning
[1:07:50] is the next day remember just like our
[1:07:52] sunday just like today amen our week
[1:07:56] begins today
[1:07:57] and what better way to begin it than in
[1:07:59] church honoring the resurrection of
[1:08:01] christ who also again rose on the third
[1:08:05] day on sunday the eighth day first day
[1:08:07] of the week the new beginning
[1:08:11] as he did
[1:08:13] he does for us
[1:08:15] now
[1:08:16] seven sabbaths so after that now look
[1:08:18] what he says in the 16th verse even unto
[1:08:21] the morrow
[1:08:22] after the seventh sabbath
[1:08:25] so again after the seventh sabbath seven
[1:08:29] sevenths we know seven is completion
[1:08:31] after the seven seven seventh sabbath 49
[1:08:34] days is the 50th day or the next day or
[1:08:38] as we know the beginning of the week the
[1:08:40] eighth day
[1:08:41] again
[1:08:42] typical
[1:08:43] of that rolling over into eternity
[1:08:47] from time into eternity because remember
[1:08:50] as the jews were
[1:08:52] as the jews were commanded to keep these
[1:08:55] feasts as it was it should have been
[1:08:57] their desire to keep these feasts in
[1:09:00] honor of the lord
[1:09:02] these things
[1:09:03] by the old law were changed
[1:09:07] you want to say pass away
[1:09:09] changed
[1:09:11] when christ came and gave his life and
[1:09:14] came and lived in us and
[1:09:16] and then the law to us
[1:09:19] changed just like brother branham said
[1:09:22] change from one form to another now
[1:09:24] those that live by the law they have to
[1:09:26] obey the law live by the law amen but we
[1:09:29] live by christ amen no we live by christ
[1:09:33] christ is the law
[1:09:35] amen so it's not done away with
[1:09:38] but it's changed it's enhanced
[1:09:41] it's come to us to work being born again
[1:09:44] christians being holy ghost filled that
[1:09:47] law
[1:09:48] is something that's not a day or a time
[1:09:51] or a sabbath or a new moon or any of
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:54] it's become life to us
[1:09:57] because it's not it's not a matter of
[1:09:59] something that you and your flesh try to
[1:10:02] accomplish
[1:10:03] is something that by the spirit of god
[1:10:05] living in you you just become amen
[1:10:09] it's just who you are
[1:10:11] you don't obey the law because you're
[1:10:13] afraid of the penalty
[1:10:14] you don't obey the law for any reason
[1:10:17] you live the law
[1:10:19] you live the word
[1:10:20] amen you live the word let's just say
[1:10:23] word how's that law scares people when
[1:10:25] you say that three-letter word
[1:10:26] especially in the scripture people get
[1:10:28] scared to death they talk about la la la
[1:10:30] it scares you to death
[1:10:32] but let's talk about word then you obey
[1:10:34] the word
[1:10:36] you don't obey the word because you're
[1:10:38] afraid of the penalty you obey the word
[1:10:40] because you become the word
[1:10:43] you don't obey the word you live the
[1:10:45] word
[1:10:46] because you've become the word see it
[1:10:48] changes now for some it doesn't those
[1:10:51] who are not born again and you don't
[1:10:52] have the holy ghost and
[1:10:55] that's what you want your life to be and
[1:10:56] you want to meet it out and say well i
[1:10:58] think god will be okay with this and i
[1:10:59] think i can get away with this and
[1:11:01] whatever then you go right ahead because
[1:11:03] you go to live by the law then you'll
[1:11:04] have to suffer the consequences of the
[1:11:06] law but i want to live by his grace
[1:11:08] and his grace with his spirit in me
[1:11:10] tells me that i do what i do because i
[1:11:12] love him
[1:11:14] not because i'm scared of him i do it
[1:11:16] because i love him
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:19] i do it because i love him because i
[1:11:22] become that
[1:11:23] i live that because i've become that see
[1:11:26] that's how the law changed
[1:11:29] it lives through the bride
[1:11:31] amen it lives to us we obey it because
[1:11:34] we want to obey it it's our life to obey
[1:11:36] now when it comes to these feasts like
[1:11:39] this we don't have these same feasts
[1:11:41] not written in the scripture like this
[1:11:44] but we obey and live the same feast but
[1:11:46] in the spiritual sense of christ now all
[1:11:49] of this parenthetical of christ going
[1:11:52] through is now living in us we just live
[1:11:54] it out because he's in us
[1:11:57] he's every bit of it anyway if he's
[1:12:00] every bit of it i'm every bit of it i
[1:12:02] live it because it's who i am now
[1:12:04] i do it praise the lord i don't take
[1:12:07] lambs i don't take fine flour i don't
[1:12:09] take and do all these things that they
[1:12:11] had to do
[1:12:12] because it has passed from death and to
[1:12:14] life
[1:12:16] we are living in life now amen
[1:12:19] living in life
[1:12:20] they were living to get by with what was
[1:12:23] acceptable to god we live life because
[1:12:26] we're living it and have it more
[1:12:27] abundantly
[1:12:30] praise the lord
[1:12:32] look at this
[1:12:35] seven sabbaths the day after the sabbath
[1:12:38] remember the new beginning
[1:12:40] the new day the first day
[1:12:42] rolling over into eternity
[1:12:45] after the seven sevens shall you number
[1:12:48] 50 days and he shall offer a new meat
[1:12:51] offering unto the lord now 50 days now
[1:12:55] what does 50 tell you
[1:12:56] obviously it tells you that's the number
[1:12:58] of pentecost 50th pentecost 50
[1:13:02] is the exact days between the
[1:13:04] resurrection of christ and the and the
[1:13:06] formation of the church
[1:13:08] in the upper room
[1:13:09] when god sent the holy spirit down 50
[1:13:13] days
[1:13:14] 50 days pentecost from the time of the
[1:13:17] first fruits to the time of the wave
[1:13:20] loaves 50 days the same as when christ
[1:13:23] raised and they were in the upper room
[1:13:25] and the holy spirit fell on them
[1:13:28] and he filled him with the holy spirit
[1:13:30] 50 days
[1:13:32] remember everything about it fulfilled
[1:13:35] by christ
[1:13:36] the new beginning
[1:13:38] that christ did when he rose from the
[1:13:40] dead
[1:13:41] began that time remember on that
[1:13:44] after that seven sabbaths
[1:13:47] amen there was that old
[1:13:49] bc time after that was now the 50 days
[1:13:53] 50 days from the time of the
[1:13:55] resurrection to the pentecost
[1:13:57] was the wave sheep now in this
[1:14:00] pentecostal feast
[1:14:02] waving of the sheep let's look at this
[1:14:04] for a minute because remember what you
[1:14:06] had in the first fruits
[1:14:08] you had loosely bound together
[1:14:10] individual stalks that were offered to
[1:14:13] god you had fine flour that was just
[1:14:15] mingled with oil
[1:14:17] but now look at what the wave loaf is ye
[1:14:20] shall bring out 17th first
[1:14:23] of your habitations two waveloads
[1:14:27] of two tenths deals
[1:14:29] they shall be a fine flower and they
[1:14:33] shall be bacon with leaven
[1:14:36] now these aren't loosely bound together
[1:14:40] individual stalks
[1:14:42] this is not fine flour that's just
[1:14:45] mingled with oil
[1:14:46] now you've got on this feast of
[1:14:48] pentecost
[1:14:50] on the day of pentecost when the holy
[1:14:52] spirit came
[1:14:53] and the holy ghost and fire came into
[1:14:56] you
[1:14:57] it galvanized the two of you together
[1:15:00] christ and his bride became one amen
[1:15:04] it's no longer loose least of individual
[1:15:06] stalks
[1:15:08] it is one yes christ and his bride are
[1:15:11] not one it is no longer just mingled
[1:15:14] with oil although a lot of people uh
[1:15:17] live under that mingling
[1:15:19] uh you realize that you see a lot of
[1:15:21] times the the screaming the shouting and
[1:15:24] even sometimes the tongues and things
[1:15:26] like all that's just the operation of
[1:15:28] the spirit of god that does not mean
[1:15:30] that person is born again
[1:15:32] does not mean that person predestinated
[1:15:34] does not mean that person is going to
[1:15:36] heaven
[1:15:37] it does not mean any of those things
[1:15:39] gifts and callings are without
[1:15:40] repentance
[1:15:42] it purely means that the anointing of
[1:15:44] the holy spirit is still going around
[1:15:47] and and is still evident in the gentiles
[1:15:50] and they feel that anointing people get
[1:15:52] under that anointing and tap into that
[1:15:54] anointing doesn't mean they're bright
[1:15:57] just means you're tapping into that
[1:15:59] anointing the rain falls on the just and
[1:16:02] the unjust
[1:16:03] the rain falls on the tares just as much
[1:16:06] as it falls on the wheat
[1:16:08] maybe sometimes more
[1:16:11] doesn't mean they're bright
[1:16:13] does they mean they're right with god
[1:16:15] right now
[1:16:17] this
[1:16:18] brother branham talked about being in
[1:16:20] foreign lands and devils and demons and
[1:16:23] putting swords through and running water
[1:16:26] water through their bodies and
[1:16:27] laying a pencil down and see that pencil
[1:16:29] get up by itself and write in an unknown
[1:16:32] tongue
[1:16:33] see you can't tell me that that's
[1:16:35] that that is somebody that's that is
[1:16:38] born against
[1:16:39] a christian
[1:16:40] these are hidden people but they do it
[1:16:43] under the operation that god has given
[1:16:45] that anointing that spirit they do it
[1:16:48] under that same spirit the false
[1:16:50] anointed ones that people today still do
[1:16:53] the same
[1:16:54] they're just mingled with that oil that
[1:16:56] oil hasn't become baked in them
[1:16:58] it hasn't become one in fellowship and
[1:17:01] in union with christ it's just a
[1:17:03] mingling look at the day of pentecost
[1:17:06] what happened here
[1:17:09] acts chapter 2 let's read it again
[1:17:11] i like reading this
[1:17:16] acts chapter 2.
[1:17:21] we'll begin reading with verse 1.
[1:17:23] acts 2 1 and when the day of pentecost
[1:17:25] was fully come
[1:17:28] notice that word those words fully come
[1:17:32] we may entertain those two words again
[1:17:34] in the future
[1:17:36] but a lot of times we get in our minds
[1:17:39] when we try to reason with the word and
[1:17:42] with the message
[1:17:43] we get in our minds that
[1:17:45] something is
[1:17:47] is like an absolute especially in the
[1:17:50] seals
[1:17:51] uh it's almost as if people would think
[1:17:54] that uh the sixth seal is going to be on
[1:17:57] one day
[1:17:59] the sixth seal was when brother brown
[1:18:00] preached it in march of 1963 or
[1:18:03] something to that effect oh it's just
[1:18:06] it's just this and it's cut and dry
[1:18:08] but notice
[1:18:10] and there's more places than this
[1:18:12] but notice that there's things that god
[1:18:15] and
[1:18:16] in matthew 24 that god
[1:18:19] brings into
[1:18:20] presence
[1:18:22] into existence
[1:18:24] brings and shows
[1:18:25] that
[1:18:26] this wave of that spirit is moving
[1:18:30] but it's not to the place
[1:18:32] of the fullness of it quite yet
[1:18:36] you could take since i've already said
[1:18:38] it and i'll delve into it just a minute
[1:18:41] let's just take the sixth seal how many
[1:18:43] beliefs a sixth seal has been unleashed
[1:18:46] now don't lift your hand or anything
[1:18:48] but think about it remember the sixth
[1:18:50] seal is tribulation judgment
[1:18:53] now when i put in that context how many
[1:18:56] belief judgments in the world today
[1:18:58] amen but they get it things get all
[1:19:01] scrupled when you say well six seal
[1:19:04] six seals judgment
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] you could never convince me there's not
[1:19:09] judgment going on in the world today
[1:19:11] there absolutely is god's still sending
[1:19:13] warning but judgment is here but the
[1:19:16] sixth seal hasn't fully released itself
[1:19:19] yet right it won't until the tribulation
[1:19:21] the bride will be gone yes amen
[1:19:24] when the day of pentecost
[1:19:29] anyway when the day of pentecost was
[1:19:32] fully come
[1:19:34] well what does that mean well it means
[1:19:36] it started somewhere
[1:19:38] and it come to a place of completion it
[1:19:40] come to where it was fully in its
[1:19:43] maturity
[1:19:44] in its place where god was bringing it
[1:19:47] from to where he's bringing it to those
[1:19:50] that are here during the tribulation
[1:19:51] could probably say the same thing about
[1:19:53] the sixth symbol it is fully come
[1:19:56] as
[1:19:57] chaos goes on around them or whatever i
[1:20:00] don't plan to be here so uh don't study
[1:20:02] too much on it but it is gonna happen
[1:20:05] yes but i believe it's it is also
[1:20:08] unveiling itself and happening now
[1:20:11] it has it has unleashed itself
[1:20:14] and it's coming forth right now
[1:20:16] amen get it won't
[1:20:18] fully come until the bride's gone but
[1:20:21] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:20:24] they were all with uh all with one
[1:20:26] accord in one place
[1:20:29] like the sheaves they were all in the
[1:20:31] upper room
[1:20:32] they were all loosely gathered together
[1:20:34] in this one room
[1:20:35] as individual stalks together
[1:20:39] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:20:42] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[1:20:45] and it filled all the house where they
[1:20:47] were sitting
[1:20:48] praise the lord i totally said that
[1:20:50] earlier i like that part amen filled all
[1:20:53] the house
[1:20:54] not just you but the whole house
[1:20:57] amen
[1:20:58] i believe this spirit of god could be so
[1:21:01] powerful anybody come through that door
[1:21:03] would knock them back
[1:21:05] just to feel the presence of almighty
[1:21:07] god
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:09] that presence that you bask in
[1:21:12] filled all the house where they were
[1:21:13] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:21:16] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[1:21:19] upon each of them now you've got the
[1:21:22] fine flower that's mingled with oil
[1:21:25] the spirit of god came and it sat upon
[1:21:28] them
[1:21:30] but that's not a new birth
[1:21:32] a new birth is not a sitting upon
[1:21:35] a baptism is not a sitting upon it's an
[1:21:37] immersion
[1:21:39] it's a complete immersion of something
[1:21:42] not just a sprinkling not just a pouring
[1:21:44] not just an anointing or a dabbing of
[1:21:46] something but it's a complete immersion
[1:21:49] of that spirit but when the spirit of
[1:21:51] god came and it sat upon them that was
[1:21:54] just the first fruit that that was just
[1:21:56] the honoring of the resurrection of god
[1:21:58] proving himself that he came back on the
[1:22:00] day of pentecost and just
[1:22:02] came on them
[1:22:05] but look what happened next
[1:22:10] and they were all filled
[1:22:14] with the holy ghost
[1:22:17] so not only did the spirit of god come
[1:22:19] on them
[1:22:20] as in the first fruits it came in them
[1:22:24] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:22:27] ghost the holy ghost and fire that took
[1:22:30] that fine flower and oil and baked them
[1:22:33] both together
[1:22:35] now you may have at some point during
[1:22:37] that first fruit taking that fine flour
[1:22:40] and that oil and maybe separated the two
[1:22:43] again but the two are baked together now
[1:22:45] you cannot separate them they have
[1:22:47] become one
[1:22:49] amen
[1:22:51] christ and his bride through the holy
[1:22:53] spirit anointing that baptism coming and
[1:22:56] galvanizing the bride and christ
[1:22:58] together as one
[1:23:01] now she's one with him
[1:23:03] this is the promise that god showed them
[1:23:06] back in in the fourth feast
[1:23:08] the wave offering the waveloaf
[1:23:11] was showing that christ was going to
[1:23:13] come 50 days from the time of the
[1:23:16] resurrection to the time of the wavelok
[1:23:18] was god going to prove himself on that
[1:23:21] day of pentecost by not only coming on
[1:23:23] them
[1:23:25] but in them
[1:23:27] praise the lord now that's a problem a
[1:23:29] lot of people have they stop with that
[1:23:31] on them part
[1:23:32] and they feel that anointing and it
[1:23:34] feels good
[1:23:36] it feels good that the anointing of god
[1:23:39] feels good they feel like a little
[1:23:40] tingle up their spine or a little gift
[1:23:42] manifests itself and they're like i got
[1:23:44] it no you don't got it till it comes in
[1:23:46] you and when it comes in you you become
[1:23:50] him yes and when you become him you live
[1:23:52] like him yes you punctuate every word of
[1:23:55] god with the name and yes you receive
[1:23:57] the word to yourself and when you
[1:23:59] receive it it becomes who you are yes
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:03] when you receive something it's you now
[1:24:06] it's part of who you are
[1:24:08] when you see when you receive a bite of
[1:24:10] morsel of food in your mouth that from
[1:24:12] the time it hits your lips that
[1:24:14] that morsel food becomes a part of you
[1:24:17] you've received it
[1:24:19] you've ingested it
[1:24:21] praise the lord
[1:24:22] when god came
[1:24:24] at that time and they received him
[1:24:28] they became one with him just like the
[1:24:31] wavelok became one baked together
[1:24:34] neither one unit one unit you can't
[1:24:37] separate them
[1:24:38] you can't separate christ from his bride
[1:24:41] no more than
[1:24:42] you can separate the sun from light yes
[1:24:47] amen
[1:24:48] look let's continue to read this now
[1:24:51] they both become one christ and his
[1:24:54] pride become one
[1:25:00] two whey blows
[1:25:02] two tin steels they shall be a fine
[1:25:04] flower
[1:25:06] shall they bacon with leaven
[1:25:08] again still actually still showing the
[1:25:10] sinful nature of the human flesh
[1:25:13] amen not the soul anymore soul cannot
[1:25:16] sin right but the
[1:25:18] the sinful nation of the human flesh
[1:25:20] there's leaven
[1:25:21] they are the first fruits they
[1:25:24] are the first fruits unto the lord
[1:25:27] and ye shall offer with the bread seven
[1:25:29] lambs without blemish
[1:25:31] of the first year and one young bullock
[1:25:33] and two realms they shall be for a burnt
[1:25:36] offering unto the lord with their meat
[1:25:38] offering and their drink offerings
[1:25:40] even an offering made by fire of sweet
[1:25:43] savior unto the lord
[1:25:46] then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the
[1:25:48] goats for a sin offering and two lambs
[1:25:51] of the first year for a sacrifice of
[1:25:53] peace offers and every one of these has
[1:25:55] that spiritual significance to it
[1:25:58] we're just not going to that
[1:25:59] today for
[1:26:01] that's not really the subject that we're
[1:26:03] working on we're looking at that new
[1:26:05] beginning
[1:26:06] the new beginning
[1:26:08] the one that we just talked about we
[1:26:10] just read about pentecost the new
[1:26:12] beginning acts 2 1 1-3
[1:26:16] the priest shall wave them with the
[1:26:18] bread of the firstfruits for a wave
[1:26:20] offering before the lord with the two
[1:26:22] lambs it shall be holy to the lord for
[1:26:24] the priest and he shall proclaim on the
[1:26:27] self same day that it may be unholy
[1:26:30] convocation unto you
[1:26:32] ye shall do no several work therein it
[1:26:34] shall be a statute forever in all your
[1:26:36] dwellings throughout your generations
[1:26:38] and when you reap the harvest of your
[1:26:39] land thou shalt not make clean riddance
[1:26:43] of the corners of the field when thou
[1:26:45] reapest neither shalt thou gather any
[1:26:47] gleaning of the harvest thou shalt leave
[1:26:50] them unto the poor and to the stranger i
[1:26:53] am the lord your god
[1:26:55] now look at this
[1:26:56] i'll read this
[1:26:58] for a moment
[1:26:59] see
[1:27:00] what time we're at here now future home
[1:27:04] brother branham says this now
[1:27:06] if if you
[1:27:08] i talked about future home in this the
[1:27:10] this whole series
[1:27:12] and uh i hope maybe you've had a time to
[1:27:14] listen to some of it
[1:27:16] uh this that we're going through today
[1:27:20] brother branham really emphasizes in the
[1:27:22] feast of the trumpet
[1:27:24] now feast of the trumpets of course
[1:27:26] dealing with the next feast that we're
[1:27:27] about to get into
[1:27:29] um
[1:27:30] hopefully if we have another minute uh
[1:27:33] that that feast he wanted to brother
[1:27:35] madam wanted to take uh a week of
[1:27:38] services like he did the uh the seals
[1:27:40] and all
[1:27:41] and the church ages and and bring those
[1:27:44] seven trumpets
[1:27:45] and then right before he's getting ready
[1:27:47] to get a place the lord spoke to him and
[1:27:48] said this is to the jews
[1:27:51] amen those seven trumpets feasted the
[1:27:53] trumpets was to the jews so brother
[1:27:55] branham came along right after that and
[1:27:57] he preached a message called feast of
[1:27:59] trumpets
[1:28:00] and he goes probably maybe in a little
[1:28:02] more detail on some of it than i did
[1:28:04] because again that's not the theme of
[1:28:06] this message uh but it's a good message
[1:28:09] to listen to if you have never heard it
[1:28:12] a little it's not as lengthy as future
[1:28:14] home it is still sort of lengthy but not
[1:28:17] as lengthy as that one but it'll bless
[1:28:19] you amen and i will tell you the feast
[1:28:22] of trumpets is good to read uh this
[1:28:25] scripture as we're going over now and
[1:28:27] and
[1:28:28] listen to it
[1:28:31] you i think i've told y'all i don't
[1:28:33] listen to the messages ground as as a
[1:28:37] background
[1:28:39] noise or whatever and it's okay if you
[1:28:40] do i'm not saying don't do that
[1:28:43] i just don't do it if i listen to the
[1:28:45] message i'm listening to it
[1:28:47] uh the worst probably the most
[1:28:50] place i'm ever
[1:28:52] distracted listening to the message is
[1:28:54] if it's playing in my car and i'm
[1:28:55] driving other than that i'm usually
[1:28:57] listening like at my desk or something
[1:28:59] i'm listening and i'm following
[1:29:02] because i like reading and listening at
[1:29:03] the same time following it through but
[1:29:06] take time
[1:29:09] pour through it
[1:29:11] don't just don't just say well you know
[1:29:13] brother mutant mentioned this and not
[1:29:15] listen no
[1:29:16] put it on there and take time and pour
[1:29:18] over it uh if you got time if you just
[1:29:21] do a half hour a day or something and
[1:29:23] write notes or something and look and
[1:29:24] listen because
[1:29:26] brother branham really
[1:29:28] goes back and forth between the seals
[1:29:30] and the trumpets and uh
[1:29:32] and
[1:29:33] these feasts and
[1:29:35] if you're not
[1:29:36] following it can get a little confusing
[1:29:40] but if you go listen to it and i advise
[1:29:43] it if you haven't already even listen to
[1:29:45] it and just take time just take your
[1:29:47] time i had to do that
[1:29:48] uh take time i listened to it even in
[1:29:50] the car and i rewind rewind what do you
[1:29:54] say there well how did that
[1:29:56] and sometimes there's a couple times
[1:29:58] just be honest there's a couple times
[1:30:01] brother branham kind of mixes up the
[1:30:03] seals and the trumpets and he says sixth
[1:30:06] seal and he meant sex trumpet or
[1:30:08] something like that but
[1:30:09] it's easy to follow if you go along with
[1:30:11] it many many times most of the time he
[1:30:13] corrects that but
[1:30:14] um
[1:30:15] listen to it but listen closely okay
[1:30:18] don't just listen and say well uh you
[1:30:20] know i'll just take time and do this
[1:30:22] it's not homework
[1:30:24] this you're not going to be graded
[1:30:26] you're not going to be disciplined if
[1:30:27] you don't do it but
[1:30:29] just take your time
[1:30:32] but in future home i did want to read
[1:30:33] this quote in future home
[1:30:36] and notice after 50 days or seven sabbas
[1:30:40] from there again 50 days
[1:30:42] he's reading the seven sabbaths of when
[1:30:44] it's completed
[1:30:45] of when that feast of the
[1:30:47] first fruits is completed
[1:30:49] is that seven sabbaths after that that
[1:30:51] next day's the 50 days
[1:30:55] there come another holy convocation what
[1:30:57] happened the holy ghost fell on the day
[1:30:59] of pentecost on the eighth day
[1:31:02] new beginning
[1:31:04] eighth day
[1:31:05] fell on the eighth day this that spirit
[1:31:08] fell on the eighth day
[1:31:10] was the seventh sabbath later exactly
[1:31:12] after his resurrection 50 days so i've
[1:31:15] been seven times that again bring back
[1:31:18] around uh to the first day of the week
[1:31:21] again seven times
[1:31:22] each time beginning
[1:31:24] holding over
[1:31:26] finishing its completion going back into
[1:31:28] that first day
[1:31:29] amen but when it gets to this new
[1:31:31] beginning we're talking about that last
[1:31:34] eighth day it rolls over into eternity
[1:31:36] not the beginning of a new week then
[1:31:38] after the millennium white throne
[1:31:39] judgment enters into enters into
[1:31:42] eternity in the new city that we're
[1:31:44] eventually gonna get to
[1:31:46] there there's your holy convocation
[1:31:49] not have anything to do with the literal
[1:31:52] thing listen now the literal thing
[1:31:53] what's he talking about these feasts
[1:31:55] were reading
[1:31:56] nothing to do with the literal thing
[1:31:58] it's beyond that
[1:32:00] it's into the kingdom of god with
[1:32:03] eternal life
[1:32:04] that's where thou that's where the
[1:32:06] gentiles enter into that promise
[1:32:09] that's where we plug and place ourselves
[1:32:12] into that word
[1:32:13] amen it's taken us
[1:32:16] beyond that how by christ
[1:32:18] by the death burial resurrection of
[1:32:20] jesus christ yes
[1:32:22] not the literal thing it's beyond that
[1:32:24] it's the kingdom of god with eternal
[1:32:26] life with the
[1:32:28] predestinated that never did start who
[1:32:31] is he talking about
[1:32:33] yes he's talking about you he's talking
[1:32:35] about me
[1:32:37] mine it never started on any day now you
[1:32:40] wasn't saved on any day you was always
[1:32:44] there
[1:32:45] yes
[1:32:46] why because you're part of god yes
[1:32:48] well if you're a part of god you're just
[1:32:50] as eternal as he is in fact the only
[1:32:52] part of you that can't be eternal is
[1:32:54] that part of god who you are yes amen
[1:32:57] the only way you can be eternal because
[1:32:58] the only thing that's eternal is god
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:03] so that's who that's who we really are
[1:33:05] now
[1:33:06] you as always saved jesus just come to
[1:33:09] redeem that but you were saved from
[1:33:13] before the foundation of the world and
[1:33:15] that's when your eternal life had to
[1:33:19] begin with
[1:33:20] eternal life
[1:33:22] what we're recognizing now
[1:33:24] is just pointing us back to that reality
[1:33:28] what we're seeing in the scripture what
[1:33:30] we're looking at and god sending a
[1:33:32] prophet thank god that we can see that
[1:33:35] is just pointing us back to what we
[1:33:36] realize
[1:33:38] now
[1:33:39] where we came from and who we are
[1:33:42] we're who we are where we're going
[1:33:45] see so many times
[1:33:47] we focus on where we've been and where
[1:33:49] we're going and we forget what god's
[1:33:51] doing right now yes
[1:33:53] who we are right now what is happening
[1:33:56] right now right amen
[1:33:58] it's just as important things
[1:34:01] it's hard to recognize who you are
[1:34:02] unless you recognize the day and hour
[1:34:04] you're living
[1:34:06] scripturally and once you see that
[1:34:08] there's nothing just nobody can take it
[1:34:10] from you
[1:34:11] amen and when the word gets preached and
[1:34:13] god begins to reveal himself and you say
[1:34:15] oh praise the lord there i am
[1:34:18] there it is
[1:34:19] that's me where am i i'm still in him
[1:34:23] because we've been come we've become one
[1:34:26] brother adam says god and man
[1:34:29] heaven and earth have embraced heaven
[1:34:31] and earth i believe is one place even
[1:34:33] said heaven and earth have kissed
[1:34:36] they've embraced they've come together
[1:34:37] one again unity in a love affair
[1:34:41] praise the lord you can't separate them
[1:34:43] anymore you could the son from life
[1:34:46] amen i'm going to read this
[1:34:48] i'll close here in just a minute
[1:34:50] but let's go to the next one just real
[1:34:52] quick i actually had this one for the
[1:34:54] next service but we got a few more
[1:34:56] minutes
[1:34:57] um
[1:34:58] still in leviticus 23 23rd verse
[1:35:05] leviticus 23 23.
[1:35:09] now
[1:35:09] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:35:11] speaking of the children of israel
[1:35:13] saying in the seventh month
[1:35:15] in the first day of the month shall ye
[1:35:17] have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of
[1:35:20] trumpets and holy convocation now we
[1:35:22] know they're all holy convocations
[1:35:24] gathering places sacredness
[1:35:27] but now god's gone back to the time
[1:35:30] element
[1:35:32] now we're in the seventh month
[1:35:34] so the first two were the first month
[1:35:36] 14th and 15th day now we're in the
[1:35:39] seventh month
[1:35:41] the seventh month the first day of the
[1:35:44] seventh month which i think actually is
[1:35:45] october our seventh is july there it'd
[1:35:48] be i believe it's october
[1:35:50] first day for them is april or the first
[1:35:52] month excuse me would be april we
[1:35:54] believe october so the seventh so now
[1:35:56] we're in the seventh the seventh month
[1:35:58] first day of the seventh month is a
[1:36:00] memorial of the blowing of trumpets he
[1:36:02] shall do no several work therein but he
[1:36:04] shall offer an offering made by fire
[1:36:06] unto the lord what are these trumpets
[1:36:09] these trumpets do what all through the
[1:36:11] scripture all through the old testaments
[1:36:14] even in the scripture we just read about
[1:36:16] the rapture there's a trumpet that
[1:36:19] sounds is what it's a calling together
[1:36:22] of a people is to bring a people
[1:36:25] together for a purpose common
[1:36:28] a common goal and purpose
[1:36:30] and these seven trumpets were to bring
[1:36:33] the the the jews all back to their
[1:36:36] homeland again back after
[1:36:39] pentecost and the dispersion by rome
[1:36:42] sent the jews all over the world
[1:36:45] but there had to be a trumpet sound
[1:36:47] of a hitler there had to be a trumpet
[1:36:49] sound of a stall and a trumpet to to
[1:36:51] draw these jews back to their homeland
[1:36:54] to bring the jews back to their promised
[1:36:57] land amen because that's the only place
[1:37:00] that the jews are blessed
[1:37:02] the only place that god deals with his
[1:37:05] people is in their homeland
[1:37:07] when they were dispersed
[1:37:09] he did not deal with them but now i want
[1:37:11] to point you to something before i get
[1:37:13] into that because we can save that for
[1:37:14] next time
[1:37:16] but notice as we get to this point
[1:37:19] um
[1:37:21] i had that quote i don't i'm not sure
[1:37:23] what i did with it but look
[1:37:25] from that time of the waveloke
[1:37:27] to the time of the blowing of the
[1:37:29] trumpets was a significant period of
[1:37:31] time you've gone from the first
[1:37:34] month to the seventh month
[1:37:37] now
[1:37:37] all of a sudden you've had the first
[1:37:40] feast second feast third feast four feet
[1:37:43] and now there's this long period of time
[1:37:46] between that time of the blowing of the
[1:37:50] waving of the wavelobe to the blowing of
[1:37:52] the trumpets
[1:37:54] you had one two three four bam just like
[1:37:56] that and now all of a sudden you've got
[1:37:58] this long period of time now you're
[1:38:00] going into the seventh month
[1:38:02] this long period of time which is
[1:38:04] parenthetical of
[1:38:06] the seven church ages because as god
[1:38:09] came on the day of pentecost with the
[1:38:11] feast of pentecost
[1:38:13] god's anointing went from the gent from
[1:38:16] the jews to the gentiles
[1:38:19] god then began to as he blinded them as
[1:38:22] we probably will get to not today but
[1:38:25] god blinded them
[1:38:27] that they would not see the messiah when
[1:38:29] he came but the gentiles received it the
[1:38:32] gentiles believed it and for the never
[1:38:35] the next 2 000 years seven church ages
[1:38:38] god's anointing has been on the gentile
[1:38:41] not the jew right the jew has been going
[1:38:44] along for 2 000 years just exactly like
[1:38:47] they've been going through the scripture
[1:38:48] that we're just reading
[1:38:50] and all their feast days and their
[1:38:52] sacrifices all that they do that the the
[1:38:55] jews and the law and living by the law
[1:38:58] and what they've done they they they
[1:39:00] just
[1:39:01] they did not recognize the messiah so
[1:39:04] they've been living by the law all
[1:39:06] through this time while god's anointing
[1:39:09] the holy spirit has been on the gentile
[1:39:11] bride
[1:39:12] through this long period of time
[1:39:14] but now at the end of god dealing with
[1:39:17] the gentiles remember we've said this
[1:39:20] many times
[1:39:21] the anointing the spirit of god begins
[1:39:24] to lift off of the gentiles and starts
[1:39:28] going back to the jews i believe that's
[1:39:30] already happened
[1:39:31] or again we're in the process of that
[1:39:34] happening
[1:39:35] i don't believe that time has fully come
[1:39:38] i don't believe that time will fully
[1:39:40] come until the gentile bride is gone
[1:39:43] when the gentile bride is gone and
[1:39:45] raptures she's no longer here the spirit
[1:39:47] of god will be fully on the jews yes
[1:39:50] amen
[1:39:51] as those trumpets have blown to bring
[1:39:54] dispersed israel back to their homeland
[1:39:56] again so as as them being in their
[1:39:58] homeland just in this church age as we
[1:40:01] call it church aids not church age to
[1:40:03] them but just in our church age
[1:40:05] that those trumpets have been blown
[1:40:09] i didn't want to get in this today but
[1:40:10] i'll just say and brother branham says
[1:40:12] all of those trumpets sounded under the
[1:40:15] sixth seal
[1:40:18] so now if there was a if there was a
[1:40:20] gathering together of dispersed israel
[1:40:23] and the sixth seal has not already began
[1:40:26] to unleash itself then where are we
[1:40:28] right if all those trumpets to the jews
[1:40:32] to gather them back to their homeland
[1:40:34] has not happened which we know it has
[1:40:38] then where are we
[1:40:40] if it's not if it's
[1:40:42] all blown under the sixth seal
[1:40:46] continuing
[1:40:47] when it comes to its fullness after the
[1:40:49] bride's gone god deals with them
[1:40:52] god deals with the jews
[1:40:54] he got revelation 11 and all the two
[1:40:56] witnesses and the things that god does
[1:40:58] and they realize who he is and
[1:41:01] they they put on sackcloth and ashes
[1:41:03] they separate themselves one family from
[1:41:05] the other and they say where did you get
[1:41:07] those scars and he said in the house of
[1:41:09] my friends
[1:41:10] that's at the end of the tribulation
[1:41:12] which i'm getting ahead of myself but
[1:41:14] that's at the end of the tribulation
[1:41:17] at the end of the marriage supper we go
[1:41:19] and have three and a half years a
[1:41:21] marriage supper of the lamb with him and
[1:41:22] at the end god slips away and comes and
[1:41:24] reveals himself to his people
[1:41:26] he couldn't do that unless they were
[1:41:28] already gathered in their homeland
[1:41:30] because he doesn't deal with them unless
[1:41:31] they're in their homeland
[1:41:33] the feast of the trumpets was to bring
[1:41:35] them back together that's the ending
[1:41:38] of the gentile dispensation the
[1:41:40] beginning of it was the waveloke that
[1:41:42] was the beginning of the gentile
[1:41:43] dispensation the day or feast of
[1:41:45] pentecost as we know it it's the feast
[1:41:48] of waveload for them feast of pentecost
[1:41:50] for us that was the beginning of that
[1:41:53] now it's winding up
[1:41:55] we're at the end of it things we know
[1:41:56] that we all know we're at the ending of
[1:41:58] that we're at the time where this spirit
[1:42:00] is that that anointing is lifting off
[1:42:02] the gentiles and it's going back to the
[1:42:04] jews this headed that way now is god
[1:42:07] still dealing with his people absolutely
[1:42:09] yes amen is god still dealing with us is
[1:42:12] he still dealing with agenda absolutely
[1:42:14] is amen for this period of time but you
[1:42:17] can tell
[1:42:18] i know just in my lifetime from when i
[1:42:20] was a kid when i was gabriel or joel's
[1:42:22] age
[1:42:23] and i remember services i went to friend
[1:42:27] they were
[1:42:28] greatly different let's just put it that
[1:42:30] way
[1:42:31] i don't want to say they were better
[1:42:33] uh
[1:42:34] although that's probably an appropriate
[1:42:36] word uh they were very different
[1:42:39] i've told you before
[1:42:41] i remember when i was again joel
[1:42:43] gabriel's age i remember being in the
[1:42:45] back of the church and seeing look like
[1:42:47] smoke
[1:42:48] milky white
[1:42:50] over the whole congregation over the
[1:42:52] whole church i mean so much so the
[1:42:54] presence of god so powerful there that
[1:42:57] you could hardly even see the man
[1:42:58] standing behind the pulpit
[1:43:00] that's how powerful it was yes amen
[1:43:04] sisters dance around the spirit of god
[1:43:06] moving so powerfully
[1:43:09] beautiful sisters
[1:43:11] uncut hair flowing down
[1:43:14] the the bobby pins i could have started
[1:43:15] a bobby pin factory uh bobby said pen
[1:43:18] selling business i if i was a little kid
[1:43:20] selected all the bobby pins they're on
[1:43:21] the floor at that time
[1:43:23] is incredible i i'm not exaggerating
[1:43:27] just from the power of god the spirit of
[1:43:29] god living and even as a little boy i
[1:43:31] knew there was something it was
[1:43:32] something different friend you can i
[1:43:34] grew up in a baptist church and this was
[1:43:36] no baptist church
[1:43:38] but you knew the difference
[1:43:40] wasn't just another church it was the
[1:43:42] presence of god right
[1:43:44] a lot of times people just want a
[1:43:46] different church no no the difference
[1:43:48] comes when god comes
[1:43:50] not from the door to door name the name
[1:43:52] denomination nomination church the
[1:43:54] church pastor pastor it changes when god
[1:43:57] comes
[1:43:58] amen and just from that time i remember
[1:44:02] and how it's as now we feel the power of
[1:44:04] god move here very strong
[1:44:06] but
[1:44:07] from those days i've seen it
[1:44:10] wane
[1:44:11] and lived
[1:44:12] and kind of almost to the point not
[1:44:15] completely gone again it won't be
[1:44:16] completely gone until we're completely
[1:44:18] gone then he deals with the jews
[1:44:21] feast of the trump has gathered them the
[1:44:23] jews back to their homeland
[1:44:26] amen so that god can begin to deal with
[1:44:28] them
[1:44:29] the jews are never blessed unless
[1:44:32] they're in their homeland
[1:44:33] god does not deal with the jews unless
[1:44:36] they're in their homeland
[1:44:37] god does not deal with us
[1:44:40] unless we are in our homeland amen and

[1:48:31] uh that on that anointing
[1:48:34] and then the tears the weak
[1:48:36] you'll see
[1:48:37] comes confusing to some people sometimes
[1:48:40] how how can this be and how can this
[1:48:42] person say that or do that
[1:48:44] but they just operate under that
[1:48:45] anointing

[1:48:51] anointing ones at the end time amen amen

[1:50:22] service again the next sunday brother
