[30:20] bit trust he hit your heart
[30:23] amen
[30:49] several out today as you can see
[30:52] thank you jesus
[30:58] it may be mother's day
[31:01] brother dennis attended texas wife leah
[31:04] as we prayed for last week is still
[31:07] struggling mightily and probably even
[31:09] more so
[31:10] today being mother's day so
[31:13] brother dennis
[31:14] she asked if he would stay home
[31:18] with her again today and so he's home
[31:20] with his wife so please remember very
[31:22] prayer
[31:22] the lord would just touch her and
[31:25] take away that anxiety that depression
[31:28] completely deliver her
[31:31] i believe
[31:32] when we agreeing with brother dennis
[31:34] that the lord's still dealing with our
[31:36] heart
[31:38] so uh to bring her
[31:40] amen to this truth so we know that
[31:42] there's a purpose behind and a reason
[31:44] for everything
[31:45] god doesn't just do things
[31:47] he does things for a reason and purpose
[31:50] so uh let's remember brother dennis
[31:53] uh sister lee of prayer also he asked
[31:56] he's
[31:57] having a scan i
[31:59] forget but it's his yearly scan you know
[32:02] the
[32:03] colon cancer that brother dennis had
[32:06] a c scan tomorrow
[32:09] tomorrow morning
[32:10] and not only of course as he's looking
[32:13] for this he scan to come come through
[32:15] negative
[32:17] but he said the last time he had the c
[32:19] scan he got sick
[32:20] after the test
[32:22] so he had asked us to pray for him and
[32:24] lift him up as well
[32:26] this morning uh
[32:28] the frauds are at home their angel got
[32:30] sick not feeling well friday he's still
[32:33] not feeling good today up last night
[32:35] with chills and fever and also please
[32:38] remember they stayed home uh with him
[32:40] today so please remember brother angel
[32:42] in prayer
[32:43] uh
[32:44] brother angel sent me a text also about
[32:46] his mother genevieve she had had a
[32:49] seizure last night
[32:50] uh you know she's been dealing with
[32:52] those uh for several years now and we're
[32:55] just trusting it to
[32:57] completely deliver her of that so
[32:59] uh please remember her in prayer if you
[33:01] would as well
[33:02] brother danny's still at home
[33:05] uh he said his allergies are still
[33:07] acting up and his it's affecting his
[33:09] eyes
[33:10] even in his sinuses so please remember
[33:13] brother danny in prayer as well
[33:16] sister julie sent me a text
[33:18] her and
[33:19] she said maggie hadn't been feeling well
[33:21] which is her niece
[33:23] and
[33:24] and seems to have
[33:26] that kristen and julie
[33:29] have contracted some whatever the
[33:31] sickness whatever is
[33:34] there so the three of them are not
[33:35] feeling well at home today so please
[33:38] remember them in prayer if you will
[33:40] as well the others i'm not sure i
[33:42] haven't heard from the pats or uh
[33:45] steroids but just trust in the lord's
[33:47] hands upon them amen and they'll be with
[33:50] us next week so anyone have an unspoken
[33:53] request on your heart
[33:56] do you have a spoken request
[33:58] um
[34:00] enoch just called me
[34:02] about two weeks ago
[34:04] anybody who may not know enoch is alex
[34:07] rael's son
[34:09] and he said that he the doctor told him
[34:12] he has cancer stomach cancer
[34:16] he has three more years to go to finish
[34:19] his
[34:20] sentence
[34:22] and he had h pillory which causes ulcers
[34:25] in the stomach
[34:26] and he was in medical
[34:29] in a different prison
[34:31] for that
[34:32] but i think
[34:35] so if it's not traded properly it causes
[34:38] cancer
[34:39] i don't know he needs
[34:42] i i am asking that god had given him
[34:46] he knows christianity knows the message
[34:50] and now i'm just praying that if
[34:53] god had given him the faith
[34:56] um
[34:58] change his mind whatever he has to do to
[35:00] be able to enter into that place of
[35:02] healing
[35:04] because
[35:05] at this point it looks like there's no
[35:07] other alternative because the
[35:10] the
[35:12] prison does not really treat
[35:14] cancer and and and i don't know that
[35:19] uh outside doctors can send anything in
[35:22] it's just a very locked up
[35:25] situation
[35:26] so his
[35:28] his only hope is prayer that god would
[35:31] just
[35:32] make a way
[35:35] he only eats his beans and rice and
[35:37] nothing and processed meat that's all
[35:40] there is available
[35:42] and he's just really suffering and those
[35:45] are the kind of things that he can't eat
[35:48] and that's all he has to eat
[35:51] amen
[35:52] so like i said
[35:54] um
[35:55] that
[35:56] was brother alex rael's son enoch
[36:00] we had him in school first couple years
[36:02] him and hosanna
[36:04] and he's in prison now
[36:07] and
[36:08] they found out he has cancer so please
[36:10] remember enoch if you would in prayer
[36:13] and anyone
[36:14] spoke anyone else have a request
[36:19] just a short group a small group this
[36:21] morning so
[36:23] feel a little more liberty if you have
[36:24] something on your heart to speak it
[36:27] if not let's just stand to our feet
[36:32] take these needs to the lord in prayer i
[36:35] mean you pray with us at home though

[45:28] get too full of him
[45:30] praise the lord jesus
[45:32] amen
[45:34] i will change your service now but
[45:36] i just thought i'd ask if anyone has a
[45:38] testimony on your heart
[45:45] before i was a christian
[45:47] i had this vision
[45:50] of a
[45:51] circle
[45:52] in which god was at the top and i was at
[45:54] the bottom and uh his love was raining
[45:57] down on me and
[45:59] and i didn't know what to do with all
[46:00] this love and uh because i wasn't a
[46:02] christian i had didn't know anything
[46:05] so as i'm meditating and what i could do
[46:07] it and all of a sudden i see at nine
[46:09] o'clock i start to see the faces of
[46:11] people up here
[46:13] and god just
[46:15] directed me
[46:16] i was inspired to give god's love to
[46:19] them
[46:21] and when i did i saw i go back up to god
[46:24] and then he ran down more on me than he
[46:27] had at the first so now i knew what to
[46:29] do with it so i gave it to the people
[46:32] and they gave it to god and i was just
[46:35] so thrilled that i had some way to give
[46:38] it back to god
[46:39] and then they ran down more on me than
[46:42] he had the first two times and this
[46:44] cycle continued until i was so full like
[46:48] a pawn
[46:49] i my mortal body couldn't take any more
[46:53] and and i felt like i was going to die
[46:57] now looking back
[47:00] i made the wrong decision to stop the
[47:02] meditation i should have just gone in
[47:04] and died
[47:07] that's a better place to be
[47:18] amen i like that
[47:20] shed
[47:21] abroad in our hearts that we can give to
[47:23] others amen that's right
[47:26] i like that living your life brothers
[47:28] you're staring heaven in the face
[47:29] praise the lord jesus let's all stand to
[47:32] our feet is anybody else
[47:36] go ahead maybe you'll pray for me the
[47:39] last time i didn't tell you what was the
[47:42] matter
[47:43] but what you prayed
[47:45] you asked the lord
[47:47] not to be afraid
[47:50] and
[48:01] it shocked me
[48:03] but i said i am not going to fear
[48:07] for your friends amen
[48:11] that we have the holy ghost
[48:14] pastor yes
[48:16] thank you
[48:17] praise the lord
[48:19] amen
[48:20] so thankful god bless
[48:22] sister norma has so many times
[48:26] as he as he has all of us
[48:28] amen
[48:46] let's stand to our feet if we could
[48:48] we'll grab our bibles and then turn into
[48:50] the first kings chapter three
[48:54] as i said just something
[48:56] uh just
[48:58] an east uh
[48:59] mother's day message lord give me my
[49:02] heart
[49:03] you know we don't
[49:05] usually try to
[49:07] have something that was
[49:09] being
[49:10] along the themes of mother's day and
[49:13] gets to the point where you've said a
[49:15] lot of things you can say about mother's
[49:17] day and without just continuing to
[49:19] repeat yourself but i figure if the lord
[49:21] keeps the
[49:22] mother's day to me is so
[49:25] special
[49:26] that it warrants it to me i don't
[49:28] necessarily preach a father's day
[49:30] message we're just thankful to our
[49:31] heavenly father but mother's day is it's
[49:34] a little bit different
[49:36] and
[49:37] i always like to even though
[49:39] every day should be a mother's day as we
[49:41] know that but we know
[49:43] it rarely is with anybody
[49:46] i i hate to admit but i never spent
[49:49] every day of my life treating my mother
[49:51] like it was a mother today
[49:53] i now wished i had
[49:55] now that she's gone or not here in the
[49:58] flesh with us anymore but
[50:00] uh but to me it's it's always been a
[50:02] very special time today's a very special
[50:05] time
[50:06] uh i miss her very much
[50:10] but
[50:10] uh but this to me
[50:14] warrants that so
[50:16] uh i wasn't exactly sure what the lord
[50:19] wanted me to bring here but uh this
[50:21] story came to my heart and you all know
[50:23] it very well
[50:25] and it's the love of a mother i want to
[50:28] speak on though the subject today is
[50:30] something real
[50:31] uh because to me there's nothing more
[50:33] real than a mother's love to me
[50:36] there just isn't just when god separated
[50:39] that feminist part out of adam and put
[50:41] it in eve or the woman at the time she
[50:44] wasn't even at the time but that
[50:45] feminist spirit that
[50:47] it just like that that
[50:49] that boost of love was put in her heart
[50:51] and
[50:52] that love that's for her children just
[50:55] uh is to me the most special it's just
[50:57] the most special thing that there is
[50:59] um
[51:00] you know you see sporting events and
[51:03] you used to be anyway uh if i saw a
[51:06] sporting event and they'd come and
[51:08] interview somebody afterwards and this
[51:09] young man he says i want to say i love
[51:11] my mom
[51:12] or get on camera and say hi mom you
[51:15] rarely ever hear them say i love my dad
[51:17] or hi dad
[51:19] there's always high mom
[51:21] but there's a reason for that so
[51:23] amen first kings chapter 3
[51:26] amen before we read let's just bow our
[51:28] heads for another word of prayer
[51:31] lord jesus father we are
[51:33] again so very thankful what you've done
[51:36] for us given to us
[51:38] for the blessings that you shine abroad
[51:40] in our heart every day
[51:41] thank you for this word lord
[51:44] thank you for our mothers
[51:46] lord there may be some in our
[51:47] congregation
[51:48] who may not have had the best mother
[51:50] but lord
[51:52] they're our mothers nevertheless
[51:54] and we're thankful god if nothing more
[51:56] than just bringing us in the world and
[51:58] giving us the opportunity to live our
[52:00] lives here
[52:01] and to serve you and to live for you god
[52:04] because even if they came from someone
[52:06] who may not have been a great mother
[52:07] lord you
[52:09] became our mother our father our sister
[52:11] our brother our everything lord and we
[52:13] love you and we thank you for that
[52:15] we thank you lord for being with us this
[52:18] morning lord and just in such a special
[52:20] way feeling your presence so near
[52:23] so precious oh god
[52:25] lord it just reminds us again of
[52:28] of how close you really are to us
[52:30] every day and just
[52:33] maybe a little trigger of something to
[52:35] to manifest that spirit and bring that
[52:38] spirit so real to us it just engulfs us
[52:41] so god
[52:42] makes us feel
[52:45] warm all over makes us feel that
[52:48] presence that you're so mindful of us
[52:50] we thank you for it lord
[52:53] we thank you lord for
[52:54] the truth of your word for the message
[52:57] we thank you for good godly mothers
[52:59] raise their children in the nurture and
[53:01] admonition of god
[53:02] and as we have this day that we
[53:04] celebrate that mother's day
[53:06] we know you are that to us as well lord
[53:09] not just our heavenly father you are
[53:11] everything lord
[53:13] we thank you father for these that have
[53:15] come lord those who may still be
[53:16] streaming here
[53:18] and lord we're thankful most of all for
[53:20] you and for your presence
[53:22] we commit the remaining part of the
[53:23] service to your hands
[53:25] trust you to meet with us and speak
[53:26] through these lips the words you'd have
[53:28] us to hear today that it would honor and
[53:30] glorify and magnify your holy name jesus
[53:34] in your precious name the lord jesus
[53:36] christ we pray amen
[53:39] again a very familiar story that we know
[53:42] of it's
[53:43] the most wise man that we consider
[53:46] uh that's ever lived
[53:48] so first kings chapter three we begin
[53:50] with verse six uh
[53:51] chapter three begin with verse 16.
[53:55] then came there two women that were
[53:57] harlots unto the king and stood before
[53:59] him
[54:00] the one woman said o my lord i and this
[54:03] woman dwell in one house and i was
[54:04] delivered of a child with her in the
[54:06] house
[54:07] it came to pass the third day after i
[54:09] was delivered that this woman was
[54:11] delivered also
[54:12] we were together there was no stranger
[54:15] with us in the house save me
[54:17] save we two in the house
[54:19] this woman's child died in the night
[54:21] because she overlaid it
[54:24] she arose at midnight and took my son
[54:27] from beside me while thine handmaid
[54:29] slept
[54:30] and laid it in her bosom and laid her
[54:32] dead child in my bosom
[54:35] when i rose in the morning to give my
[54:36] child suck behold it was dead
[54:39] but when i had considered it in the
[54:41] morning behold it was not my son which i
[54:44] did bear
[54:45] the other woman said nay but the living
[54:48] son is my the living is my son
[54:51] the dead is thy son
[54:53] and this said no
[54:55] but the dead is thy son the living is my
[54:58] son thus they spake before the king
[55:02] then said the king the one saith this is
[55:04] my son that liveth
[55:06] and thy son is dead the other said nay
[55:09] but thy son is dead and my son is the
[55:11] living
[55:13] the king said bring me a sword they
[55:15] brought a sword before the king the king
[55:17] said divide the living child in two give
[55:20] the one half to one the other half to
[55:23] the other
[55:24] then spake the woman whose living child
[55:26] was unto the king for her bowels yearned
[55:29] upon her
[55:31] upon her son and she said o my lord give
[55:34] her the living child and in no wise slay
[55:37] it but the other said let it be neither
[55:40] mine nor thine but divided
[55:43] then the king answered and said give her
[55:45] the living child and in no wise slay it
[55:48] she is the mother thereof
[55:51] all israel heard of the judgment which
[55:53] the king had judged and they feared the
[55:55] king
[55:56] for they saw that his wisdom was of god
[55:59] was in him to do judgment you can be
[56:01] seated if you like
[56:04] now again
[56:05] as i said before we all know this story
[56:08] quite well
[56:09] uh one of the most famous stories
[56:11] actually the world knows this story
[56:13] quite well i've probably heard this
[56:14] story mentioned among
[56:18] worldly people even as much as maybe
[56:20] christians
[56:23] but it's a very
[56:25] a wise choice a very wise
[56:28] way to discern but we know that that
[56:30] wisdom come from god but again the thing
[56:33] that obviously strikes us here and of
[56:35] course this being mother's day is that
[56:38] this mother's heart for her child
[56:40] the differentiation that you can see
[56:42] from a true godly mother
[56:44] and someone who isn't really a mother or
[56:46] someone who
[56:48] has
[56:49] allowed that spirit of motherhood to be
[56:52] tamped down by whatever means that there
[56:55] are in the world but there is something
[56:58] always in the heart of that woman that's
[57:01] going to be a mother you know brother
[57:03] branham tells us that even if a woman
[57:06] today refuses to have a child now
[57:08] there's some women that that cannot have
[57:10] children medically for some reason but
[57:13] if they
[57:14] simply refuse to have a child they'll
[57:17] take to themselves a dog or a cat to
[57:19] mother it because they it's instinct in
[57:22] them to want to be a mother to mother
[57:24] something
[57:25] and that that thing that we recognize
[57:28] that that is that special bond that uh
[57:31] that that god gives to a mother that
[57:34] allowed in this woman's heart to want to
[57:38] lose her son and him stay alive rather
[57:41] than her son to die
[57:43] and what a great story because obviously
[57:46] the woman whose child it was not could
[57:49] care less about that child her child was
[57:51] already dead she didn't care whether
[57:54] solomon chopped that other child in half
[57:56] or not because it wasn't hers but the
[57:58] woman whose child it was was more
[58:01] willing to allow that child to go and
[58:03] maybe even never see it again
[58:06] than to allow that child to be killed
[58:08] now that being of a true mother could be
[58:11] spoken of in a spiritual sense as well
[58:15] because a true godly mother wants her
[58:17] child to serve god wants her child to be
[58:20] born again wants your child to be saved
[58:23] wants your child to be spending eternity
[58:25] together
[58:26] with them on the other side
[58:28] that's true heart of a mother that
[58:30] mother would rather cause that child and
[58:33] see that it kind of almost gets to the
[58:35] spare the rods for the child type
[58:37] situation but that mother is going to do
[58:40] what it takes for that child for that
[58:43] child to become obedient so that that
[58:45] child is raised in the right way so that
[58:48] they recognize and acknowledge god when
[58:50] they get older because as much as the
[58:53] the a true mother wants her
[58:55] child to stay alive physically
[58:58] that true godly mother wants her child
[59:00] to be alive spiritually and that prayer
[59:03] for that mother or from that mother that
[59:06] prayer to that uh to god for that child
[59:09] is to me prevails before god as much as
[59:12] any prayer that there is it exists
[59:15] but the thing about it that that i want
[59:18] to speak on today just again for a few
[59:20] minutes but how the lord leads that i
[59:22] want to talk about that that mother's
[59:25] love
[59:26] and the reality of that love
[59:29] there's a lot of things in the world
[59:30] today and
[59:31] and as we sing this song there's there
[59:33] are so many people
[59:35] that i believe in the world today
[59:38] uh that that just they just really want
[59:42] something that's real
[59:44] now you know there's a there's a soul
[59:46] inside everybody
[59:48] every human that's ever born has a soul
[59:50] worth 10 million worlds
[59:52] and that soul
[59:55] cries for the living god
[59:57] now
[59:58] in everybody
[59:59] you say oh
[1:00:00] it is just for the predestination no i
[1:00:03] believe every soul that is born because
[1:00:06] life is precious
[1:00:08] to god life is a precious thing and
[1:00:11] every name every person that's born is
[1:00:14] written in a book of life
[1:00:16] every day because that life is precious
[1:00:19] and and in that soul because that soul
[1:00:22] would be the eternal part of that person
[1:00:24] that soul is the thing that cries out to
[1:00:27] god now how many times and through how
[1:00:31] many people does that
[1:00:33] that yearning become camped down by the
[1:00:36] things of the world
[1:00:37] now see that that becomes the issue in
[1:00:40] so many people's lives
[1:00:42] now
[1:00:43] it's a lot of times not understood it's
[1:00:45] not acknowledged but the fact of the
[1:00:47] matter is that that yearning that's in
[1:00:50] everybody
[1:00:52] is
[1:00:54] is
[1:00:55] is there it's inherent
[1:00:58] but in so many people
[1:01:00] they allow that desire to get driven
[1:01:03] down by everything else
[1:01:06] all the things in the world all the
[1:01:08] cares of life
[1:01:09] so many people try to mask it
[1:01:11] with righteous living with with drugs
[1:01:14] with alcohol
[1:01:18] with substitutes things that they try to
[1:01:21] to bring into their lives to quench that
[1:01:23] thirst of god
[1:01:26] that
[1:01:27] desire is still there
[1:01:29] even if a mother and and
[1:01:32] we've seen and heard so many stories
[1:01:35] unfortunately
[1:01:36] of mothers that have taken their
[1:01:38] children and done
[1:01:39] unspeakable things to them
[1:01:42] uh throwing them in garbage cans or
[1:01:44] dumped them in rivers or
[1:01:46] all kinds of horrible things but i will
[1:01:49] testify that i believe because it's god
[1:01:53] that still in that woman
[1:01:56] there's that desire to be mother because
[1:01:58] she's born that way
[1:02:00] it's inherent from god to be that way
[1:02:03] but something in life
[1:02:06] some conditions
[1:02:08] some adversity something
[1:02:11] has
[1:02:11] tamped down that desire has tamped down
[1:02:15] that that reality of what's in there
[1:02:18] and it's perverted it
[1:02:20] just like the the perversion of the
[1:02:22] taste that's supposed to be for god that
[1:02:24] people have they turn to so many other
[1:02:26] things it's become perverted it's become
[1:02:29] perverted so many times in women's
[1:02:32] hearts
[1:02:33] even though that yearning is there
[1:02:35] becomes perverted
[1:02:37] i don't think it's a i don't think it's
[1:02:39] an accident
[1:02:41] uh you may differ with me and maybe i'm
[1:02:44] wrong
[1:02:45] but i don't think it's an accident that
[1:02:49] this leak came out of the supreme court
[1:02:53] about them
[1:02:54] uh
[1:02:56] tearing down
[1:02:57] roe versus weight
[1:02:59] and the legalization national
[1:03:01] legalization of abortion
[1:03:05] on the week of mother's day
[1:03:07] i honestly don't think that's a
[1:03:09] coincidence now did man orchestrate that
[1:03:12] no i don't think man orchestrated that
[1:03:15] i think that's a sign to us
[1:03:17] to recognize
[1:03:19] what is real and what isn't real
[1:03:22] what is god doing amen there's been
[1:03:26] 63
[1:03:27] million babies
[1:03:29] murdered in this country before they
[1:03:31] ever had a chance to have life
[1:03:34] 63 million can you imagine
[1:03:37] and i don't think it's a coincidence
[1:03:39] that this is going on now on this week
[1:03:42] of mother's day this
[1:03:45] week that we celebrate mother's day
[1:03:48] because
[1:03:49] this country has thrown itself into a a
[1:03:54] a
[1:03:55] a tizzy over this leaked document that's
[1:03:59] not even official yet
[1:04:01] don't even know what's going to happen
[1:04:04] i personally celebrate it
[1:04:07] it won't legalize it
[1:04:09] it'll
[1:04:09] it would
[1:04:11] do away with the national legalization
[1:04:14] of abortion and just give it back to the
[1:04:16] states to the people's hands so this is
[1:04:19] not going to
[1:04:21] get rid of abortion
[1:04:23] but
[1:04:24] it's a step in the right direction
[1:04:27] does it tell us maybe we have another
[1:04:29] year or two that we didn't realize i
[1:04:31] don't know
[1:04:32] that's up to god that's his choice
[1:04:34] but i don't think it's an accident that
[1:04:36] it happened in the week of mother's day
[1:04:38] 63 million human beings 63 million
[1:04:43] babies
[1:04:44] murdered before they ever even had a
[1:04:46] chance to be a human to have life
[1:04:49] and that's sad
[1:04:51] it gets to be today that a certain group
[1:04:54] of people they almost it seems like or
[1:04:58] maybe they do maybe it's not just almost
[1:05:01] maybe they do
[1:05:02] value a dog's life more than they do a
[1:05:05] human's life yeah
[1:05:07] yes
[1:05:08] more it seems like certain people
[1:05:11] advocate more
[1:05:12] for for
[1:05:14] adopting a dog than they will have a
[1:05:16] child that someone could could adopt
[1:05:18] yeah
[1:05:20] and that's sad when did it get to be to
[1:05:23] where the animal took the president over
[1:05:25] a human
[1:05:27] in life
[1:05:28] do you know what is illegal to kill a a
[1:05:32] sea turtle in its shell
[1:05:35] right before it has a chance to come to
[1:05:37] life it is actually illegal to kill to
[1:05:40] take that egg to use that egg or to kill
[1:05:42] it or you know it's actually illegal to
[1:05:44] do that but you can kill an unborn child
[1:05:48] human
[1:05:49] and there's others that that's just one
[1:05:51] that i just remembered i don't even have
[1:05:53] that in my notes that just came to my
[1:05:54] mind it is actually illegal to kill an
[1:05:57] unborn i think it's a sea turtle or
[1:05:59] something it is illegal to kill that and
[1:06:01] but yet you can you can you can go down
[1:06:04] the street and kill a human
[1:06:08] it's even been talked about infanticide
[1:06:11] i've heard a governor of a state that
[1:06:14] said that lady can have that child
[1:06:17] and then and then the the woman and the
[1:06:20] doctor could decide what to do with the
[1:06:22] child from there in other words they
[1:06:24] could kill it if they wanted to well
[1:06:25] that's just
[1:06:26] that's just outright murder
[1:06:30] so let's get this spirit uh we know
[1:06:33] we're living in satan's evening
[1:06:36] we know these these things come into
[1:06:38] people's lives
[1:06:39] and they they move into people's spirits
[1:06:42] and they darken a person's soul even
[1:06:45] darker than they were they become so
[1:06:47] hard they become so calloused and
[1:06:49] crusted that it just
[1:06:51] it it it just
[1:06:53] defies humanity
[1:06:55] if that person comes like an animal
[1:06:57] brother of adam said without the holy
[1:06:58] ghost a man is just a beast
[1:07:01] even if it has a soul it's just it's
[1:07:03] nature how it acts is just like a beast
[1:07:07] and so this spirit that
[1:07:09] tamps down that that god-given desire
[1:07:13] that god-given nature that's in there
[1:07:16] that that god-given uh
[1:07:19] respect for life
[1:07:21] that that we as
[1:07:23] a christian nation
[1:07:25] have inherent in us as human beings
[1:07:29] everybody struggles for life even at the
[1:07:32] end of life when a person's reaching
[1:07:34] their end of life
[1:07:36] i remember watching our son take his
[1:07:38] last breath
[1:07:39] that little body it didn't know any
[1:07:41] better
[1:07:43] it it didn't know what it meant to him
[1:07:45] intellectually to breathe or to
[1:07:48] to to live another day or he didn't have
[1:07:51] a slightest idea he was a day and a half
[1:07:53] old
[1:07:55] but that little body
[1:07:56] was laying there struggling pulling
[1:08:00] sucking every bit of air that it could
[1:08:02] possibly get in its body because that
[1:08:05] body was struggling for life
[1:08:08] it was fighting and struggling and it
[1:08:11] was doing everything in its little power
[1:08:14] to try to stay alive
[1:08:16] wasn't the will of god for it to stay
[1:08:18] alive
[1:08:19] but you could watch it and see as it
[1:08:21] drew its breath oh friend i
[1:08:25] just
[1:08:27] i i cried like never before i i wasn't
[1:08:31] even i don't even
[1:08:32] i don't even say i was crying water was
[1:08:35] just pouring out of my eyes
[1:08:37] you know i i i've cried a lot in my life
[1:08:40] but it wasn't like crying it's just like
[1:08:42] water was pouring out of my eyes and i
[1:08:44] couldn't stop it as i watched that
[1:08:46] little
[1:08:47] form that little body that little human
[1:08:50] try to stay alive
[1:08:52] and you don't think that it's that way
[1:08:54] even at conception even at the time when
[1:08:57] that little baby comes to to fruition
[1:09:00] and and is conceived
[1:09:03] it's that way
[1:09:05] in that woman's in that woman's body
[1:09:08] and people have such
[1:09:11] some people have such disregard for that
[1:09:15] but that spirit that that presses that
[1:09:18] that's in there that that god-given
[1:09:21] inherent in there
[1:09:23] to to want
[1:09:25] to have that life and have that life
[1:09:28] come forward and to have just just have
[1:09:30] a respect for that life
[1:09:34] and thank god that there is still a way
[1:09:36] that life can be brought forward
[1:09:39] and that god would honor that amen
[1:09:42] and god does honor him
[1:09:45] god honors the godly mothers
[1:09:48] that
[1:09:49] have that
[1:09:52] and in their soul
[1:09:54] in that spirit of of that motherhood to
[1:09:57] want a mother something
[1:10:01] i've heard people say and we've said it
[1:10:03] sometimes we were empty nesters and you
[1:10:06] know and the kids have gone off out of
[1:10:08] the house and things like that and i
[1:10:10] used to take people around and they tell
[1:10:12] me how their empty nesters or their kids
[1:10:14] were off in some different state or they
[1:10:16] had to follow a job or something like
[1:10:18] that and
[1:10:19] but you know you could always tell
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:23] no matter how far away
[1:10:25] or no matter how old or how big that
[1:10:28] child gets
[1:10:29] it'll always that mother it'll that
[1:10:33] mother will always that'll be her baby
[1:10:36] always
[1:10:38] it doesn't matter what changes it
[1:10:40] doesn't matter who they are where they
[1:10:41] go you can see them once a year it'll
[1:10:44] that will always be mama's baby
[1:10:47] always
[1:10:48] because that doesn't change no matter
[1:10:50] how old they get or how big they get
[1:10:52] but this this spirit of being
[1:10:56] a of reality
[1:10:59] something that that shows that that
[1:11:02] there is something that is that is
[1:11:04] really real something that is in
[1:11:07] that inherent
[1:11:09] human that soul that desire for mother
[1:11:13] that desire for god that thirst for life
[1:11:17] that is there
[1:11:18] that desire that's there
[1:11:20] with people
[1:11:22] so many times it gets camped down i i
[1:11:25] can't believe
[1:11:27] that people even who have been misguided
[1:11:29] or have had that camp down or broke the
[1:11:32] law or killed somebody or done something
[1:11:35] wrong that that isn't all that that
[1:11:37] isn't still there
[1:11:40] how do we know that person laid there on
[1:11:42] their prison bed at night
[1:11:44] and that come to their heart
[1:11:47] i believe it does
[1:11:49] the coldest heart out there
[1:11:52] because it's what god put in them
[1:11:55] it's how they were born
[1:11:57] there's something in there that wants to
[1:11:59] thirst for god
[1:12:02] and then the things happen and it gets
[1:12:04] pushed out again
[1:12:06] but oh if there's just some way somehow
[1:12:10] that person could get to that reality
[1:12:13] that that reality that is god
[1:12:17] the world
[1:12:19] is doing everything but
[1:12:22] the world is becoming more and more fake
[1:12:24] and put on all the time
[1:12:27] it's becoming more
[1:12:29] uh uh
[1:12:31] superficial
[1:12:33] it's becoming more oh just just think
[1:12:35] about all the things that try to have
[1:12:38] people escape from the reality of what
[1:12:41] life is and and life itself and god
[1:12:46] all the fake all the put on
[1:12:48] hollywood think about how everything
[1:12:50] comes out of hollywood everything about
[1:12:52] it is fake
[1:12:55] superheroes comics comic books
[1:12:59] i think comic books those are far from
[1:13:02] what reality is
[1:13:04] comic book superheroes
[1:13:06] science fiction i've never seen that
[1:13:08] time i've never been a science fiction
[1:13:10] person myself even when star wars came
[1:13:13] out in the 70s and everybody went crazy
[1:13:15] i'm like why are you that's the
[1:13:16] stupidest thing i've ever seen
[1:13:18] who would want to even watch that
[1:13:21] people looking all moral gnarled up and
[1:13:24] living on a planet and flying it it
[1:13:26] didn't make any sense to me
[1:13:29] still doesn't
[1:13:30] but science fiction now it's got to work
[1:13:35] probably the majority of what even comes
[1:13:37] out of hollywood is science fiction now
[1:13:40] or comedy or a cartoon or a superhero or
[1:13:45] something
[1:13:47] man that can shoot webs on a building
[1:13:49] and fly around
[1:13:51] or or
[1:13:53] stop a bullet with their hand i don't
[1:13:54] even know if they do it
[1:13:57] the superhero stuff and and the the fake
[1:14:00] the sci-fi reality tv there's not a
[1:14:03] reality thing about any of that stuff
[1:14:06] right every bit of it's all put on and
[1:14:08] fake
[1:14:10] there's nothing real about that never
[1:14:12] seen anything of reality and all that
[1:14:14] there's nothing real about that
[1:14:17] social media is just as guilty
[1:14:20] social media and all the the the hype
[1:14:23] and the put on and the fake the tick
[1:14:25] tock oh my goodness
[1:14:27] people are dying trying to do stuff that
[1:14:29] others are doing on this tick tock
[1:14:32] giving their lives and
[1:14:35] and acting just just acting crazy
[1:14:38] and people are making some people are
[1:14:40] making a lot of money off this stuff
[1:14:44] and all of it's a bunch of put on oh
[1:14:46] it's a bunch of fake
[1:14:48] there's nothing to it
[1:14:50] there's no reality to it disney
[1:14:53] is not the happiest place on earth i'm
[1:14:56] sorry
[1:14:57] it is
[1:14:59] to me this is
[1:15:01] amazing yes that will probably happen
[1:15:04] with my family
[1:15:05] amen with you all
[1:15:07] but this is not it amen some nice rides
[1:15:10] characters all that said it's all put on
[1:15:12] it's all fantasy that's why that's why
[1:15:15] people they say it's the happiest place
[1:15:17] because people want to get away from
[1:15:20] their real lives and get into something
[1:15:22] that's fake and put on
[1:15:24] costumes and all that all those things
[1:15:26] like that
[1:15:27] it's all fake
[1:15:29] but i
[1:15:30] i i never would have known or thought
[1:15:33] back you know 20 30 years ago that the
[1:15:36] science fiction and the superhero the
[1:15:39] comics and all that stuff would have
[1:15:40] become such a big thing like it is today
[1:15:44] it's it's like they can't think of
[1:15:46] anything of reality to try to put out
[1:15:49] anymore so let's just come up with the
[1:15:51] most hideous gruesome nasty ugliest
[1:15:54] most unbelievable thing that you can and
[1:15:56] just just throw it out in front of
[1:15:58] people and it's warping the young
[1:16:00] people's minds yes
[1:16:03] so that reality that they're born with
[1:16:06] immediately gets camped down
[1:16:09] because this is all pressed down on them
[1:16:12] it comes to their body their spirit and
[1:16:14] it it it takes toll that that soul that
[1:16:17] thirst that's in there
[1:16:19] so then it perverts that thirst
[1:16:22] so then he wants something else besides
[1:16:24] what the thirst is for and that's god
[1:16:28] you remember brother brown i'm talking
[1:16:29] about alley-oop
[1:16:31] brother green used to tell us that
[1:16:32] brother what brother brandon what
[1:16:34] brother branham said about alley-oop
[1:16:36] this cartoon character alley-oop that
[1:16:38] was supposed to be a i think as a
[1:16:39] prehistoric something some
[1:16:42] prehistoric uh caveman or whatever i
[1:16:45] guess they say
[1:16:46] it was alley-oop anybody ever seen the
[1:16:48] commercial of the the cartoon or that
[1:16:51] brother green gave him out i looked him
[1:16:53] up
[1:16:54] it was it wasn't my thing i never was
[1:16:56] much of a cartoon person
[1:16:59] this alley-oop brother branham said that
[1:17:01] that was the closest to satan that he
[1:17:03] had seen
[1:17:05] you know this he said this is the
[1:17:06] closest to jesus that you that god had
[1:17:08] showed him there in the broomstage field
[1:17:10] he said that ali was the closest thing
[1:17:12] he'd seen the devil
[1:17:15] and and people's kids reading that stuff
[1:17:17] all the time
[1:17:19] of this fake
[1:17:21] science fiction put on made up stuff
[1:17:25] amen but i do believe
[1:17:28] that there's still people
[1:17:30] i i believe everybody
[1:17:32] i believe everybody really truly if you
[1:17:35] broke it down and got rid of all the
[1:17:37] crusty mess on top
[1:17:39] everybody really desires to have
[1:17:41] something that's really
[1:17:45] a life
[1:17:47] home
[1:17:48] a marriage
[1:17:50] family
[1:17:51] people want things that are real
[1:17:54] if that other stuff were to all go away
[1:17:57] get rid of all the other uh
[1:17:59] things that pervert
[1:18:01] when you get right back right down to it
[1:18:03] that's exactly what humanity devolves uh
[1:18:07] really desires more than anything you
[1:18:10] think about you think about the people
[1:18:11] of ukraine for a minute
[1:18:13] they don't care what
[1:18:16] disney's new character gay character is
[1:18:20] they don't care what
[1:18:21] new reality show is on
[1:18:24] they don't right now they could care
[1:18:25] less what cartoon or sci-fi movie is
[1:18:28] coming out next or superhero they
[1:18:30] couldn't care less about superman or
[1:18:31] batman or whatever
[1:18:33] they couldn't care less
[1:18:35] because their lives have devolved down
[1:18:37] to one thing that's survival that's
[1:18:40] living
[1:18:42] having something that's real close
[1:18:44] reality to those folks right now is a
[1:18:46] bomb dropping on their heads and their
[1:18:48] kids laying dead in the street
[1:18:51] that's reality to them
[1:18:53] they want something that's real
[1:18:56] and that's exactly what god gives to us
[1:18:59] to me that's exactly what a mother
[1:19:02] provides a true godly mother now
[1:19:05] provides
[1:19:06] is that reality
[1:19:08] a true reality
[1:19:10] you know listen this brother branham
[1:19:12] said uh they said this in several places
[1:19:14] but in 1954
[1:19:19] i picked this one out
[1:19:22] he said the backbone of any nation is
[1:19:25] womanhood
[1:19:26] now you think about that for a minute
[1:19:28] because remember we've told this i think
[1:19:30] maybe this was the last mother's day i
[1:19:32] can't remember
[1:19:33] but
[1:19:34] the sacredness
[1:19:37] uh
[1:19:39] i know brother branham was
[1:19:41] was hard on the woman but he was hard on
[1:19:43] ungodly women right
[1:19:45] he was hard on jezebels
[1:19:48] wasn't hard on the godly sister
[1:19:51] but womanhood
[1:19:54] in general
[1:19:56] not godly women but ungodly women yeah
[1:20:00] he was hard on them
[1:20:02] but
[1:20:03] he understood and believed i believe
[1:20:06] the sacredness that god gave that woman
[1:20:11] god entrusted the female
[1:20:15] with the ability to reproduce
[1:20:19] to bring forth life into the world
[1:20:22] i can't do that
[1:20:24] i have life in me i have seen in me but
[1:20:27] i can't bring that forth
[1:20:30] bring it into life
[1:20:32] without the woman without the mother
[1:20:36] god allowed you and entrusted you
[1:20:39] sisters with that responsibility women
[1:20:42] with that responsibility
[1:20:45] and to me that's a very sacred
[1:20:46] responsibility
[1:20:49] and brother adam says then the backbone
[1:20:51] of any nation is womanhood
[1:20:54] backbone of any nation
[1:20:57] couldn't be standing here before you
[1:20:58] today if i didn't have a backbone you
[1:21:00] could be sat in there if you didn't have
[1:21:01] a backbone so what is a nation without a
[1:21:03] backbone
[1:21:07] womanhood broken
[1:21:09] he said when it comes to the morals
[1:21:11] and you and when you break motherhood
[1:21:14] you've broken your nation
[1:21:16] so friend
[1:21:18] if we didn't already know it i
[1:21:19] officially declare we are living in a
[1:21:21] nation that is broken
[1:21:24] now he said nation i believe we're
[1:21:25] living in a world that is broken and we
[1:21:27] know what's next
[1:21:29] but that doesn't change the reality in
[1:21:31] our hearts you know brother dan was here
[1:21:33] last week talking about um
[1:21:35] you know the things that's going on in
[1:21:36] the country and and
[1:21:39] uh i think it was a time magazine or
[1:21:41] something you mentioned a picture of the
[1:21:42] woman of the year or something like that
[1:21:44] and
[1:21:45] and yeah all those things happen and and
[1:21:47] yeah it hurts our heart because
[1:21:50] it's hard to see
[1:21:52] i love this country i love its people
[1:21:56] i hate to see what's happening and we
[1:21:59] know it's going to but that doesn't
[1:22:01] change
[1:22:02] how i feel about it
[1:22:05] right it doesn't change how i feel about
[1:22:07] it i know
[1:22:09] that the majority of people that are
[1:22:11] around us today are going to go to hell
[1:22:13] because the scripture says so but that
[1:22:16] doesn't change how i feel about them
[1:22:19] that doesn't change my desire to want
[1:22:22] them to not go to hell
[1:22:25] my desire is for them to see this truth
[1:22:27] and to receive this truth and to go and
[1:22:29] spend eternity with me even if they're
[1:22:32] on the outside of the city at least they
[1:22:34] can be granted life yeah
[1:22:38] yes that's my heart i believe that's all
[1:22:40] of our desires
[1:22:43] but when motherhood is broken you've
[1:22:45] broken the backbone of a nation you've
[1:22:47] broken that nation
[1:22:51] since
[1:22:52] 1974
[1:22:54] i think it was
[1:22:55] 70-something roe versus weight 63
[1:22:59] million babies
[1:23:01] and how could we think that motherhood
[1:23:03] is not broken
[1:23:05] that situation
[1:23:07] and looking at the children that are
[1:23:09] being raised today
[1:23:11] it's hard it's a chore i'm looking at
[1:23:14] mothers looking at me
[1:23:15] it's hard you all know it's hard i say
[1:23:18] it as a father and i and that's from a
[1:23:20] father's point of view look
[1:23:23] being a mother is a much
[1:23:26] much more difficult than being a father
[1:23:29] just is
[1:23:31] first of all god gave you the
[1:23:33] responsibility of being the mother to
[1:23:34] that child that's the first thing
[1:23:38] man is responsible but it is harder
[1:23:41] for the sisters for the women to raise
[1:23:43] those children than the nurtured
[1:23:44] admonition of god
[1:23:47] and god sees that
[1:23:49] that's why god honors that
[1:23:51] that's one reason i like
[1:23:54] having this mother's day even if it's
[1:23:57] just taking a few minutes
[1:23:58] to have
[1:23:59] a scripture a celebration of
[1:24:03] an acknowledgement of that just like
[1:24:06] this
[1:24:07] woman here
[1:24:09] true mother
[1:24:10] a true mother wants to see her baby live
[1:24:13] that's what a true mother does
[1:24:15] there's a special connection i believe
[1:24:17] there's a there's a special spiritual
[1:24:19] connection now there's obviously the
[1:24:21] physical connection but there's that
[1:24:23] spiritual connection i believe between
[1:24:25] the mother and his child and her child
[1:24:28] it's something that transcends just the
[1:24:30] flesh and just the uh just the humanity
[1:24:33] of it there's a spiritual bond that
[1:24:35] develops there between that child and
[1:24:37] that mother that
[1:24:39] again is something that's unlike
[1:24:41] anything else
[1:24:43] unlike anything else
[1:24:45] look at this
[1:24:46] you all know this story i'm going to
[1:24:48] read a couple of stories to you
[1:24:50] on that reality
[1:24:52] but this one is
[1:24:54] um
[1:24:55] my new ministry brother brown said 1959
[1:25:00] both of them are a little lengthy
[1:25:08] brother brandon said i that same god
[1:25:10] hallelujah that jehovah jireh he's just
[1:25:13] as much jehovah jirei today as he was on
[1:25:16] the mount with abraham
[1:25:18] he can still produce an animal to his
[1:25:21] glory
[1:25:22] three squirrels was not a vision i shot
[1:25:25] them blood came out of them i dressed
[1:25:27] them ate them
[1:25:29] they weren't visions they were squirrels
[1:25:32] i said that same jehovah jireh trying to
[1:25:35] get his promise over to me and the
[1:25:37] thickness and dullness of my mind
[1:25:40] he could speak my
[1:25:42] need into existence the same as he could
[1:25:44] speak abraham's need into existence
[1:25:47] i had no more than said that till sister
[1:25:50] had he's sitting there crying right now
[1:25:52] he said sitting there
[1:25:53] hadn't said a word and she said that's
[1:25:56] nothing but the truth
[1:25:59] that pleased the lord
[1:26:02] please the lord so much
[1:26:04] god told brother brandon speak to her
[1:26:06] and tell her that he'll she'll get
[1:26:07] whatever she wants
[1:26:10] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:26:12] one thing about
[1:26:14] sister hattie that a lot of people don't
[1:26:15] know
[1:26:16] well you would if you read the message
[1:26:18] enough but there's one thing about
[1:26:20] sister hattie that a lot of people
[1:26:22] didn't know hattie was her right was her
[1:26:24] middle name people have wrote songs
[1:26:26] about how right she was and how right
[1:26:28] this was in that because of her name and
[1:26:30] trying to bring the coalition of the
[1:26:33] right with what she said the right word
[1:26:36] and that's okay there's nothing wrong
[1:26:37] with that but actually her name at that
[1:26:39] time was not right
[1:26:41] her name was actually moser she was a
[1:26:43] widow
[1:26:44] her actual
[1:26:45] her actual legal name at that time was
[1:26:48] hattie mosher it wasn't actually hattie
[1:26:50] wright brother bantam does tell that he
[1:26:52] calls her hattie right more than any
[1:26:54] because she was in the right family
[1:26:57] but her married name when she was a
[1:26:59] widow was hattie moser actually her
[1:27:01] legal name at the time this happened was
[1:27:04] was different but anyway that's a whole
[1:27:06] nother segue
[1:27:08] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:27:12] she said the right thing
[1:27:14] she said just like
[1:27:16] banks
[1:27:17] sat down there i heard a voice
[1:27:19] as i as it swept from my ears like up
[1:27:22] into the woods
[1:27:23] miss right sitting back there with a
[1:27:25] little girl was trying to intercept with
[1:27:27] edith i couldn't hear miss right
[1:27:31] that super anointing swept over me still
[1:27:34] said tell hattie that she's found grace
[1:27:37] in the sight of god
[1:27:39] who would have thought said tell her to
[1:27:42] ask whatever she will
[1:27:44] then you speak it by this gift into
[1:27:47] existence whatever she's asketh speak it
[1:27:51] into existence
[1:27:52] i look to sister hattie the first time
[1:27:54] it was ever performed on a human being i
[1:27:57] said sister hattie
[1:27:58] ask what you will god is going to give
[1:28:01] it to you
[1:28:02] what do you think of that congregation
[1:28:04] says amen
[1:28:06] does it get into you
[1:28:08] seven times he had confirmed it by an
[1:28:11] animal seven is god's complete number
[1:28:13] here is the first time on a human being
[1:28:15] and he uh he did he chose some great he
[1:28:19] did not choose some great aristocrat or
[1:28:22] a great noted minister a poor little
[1:28:24] widow woman that could hardly write her
[1:28:26] name
[1:28:27] god knows what he's doing
[1:28:29] said ask what you will had he uh and had
[1:28:33] he said to me brother banner what do you
[1:28:35] mean
[1:28:36] i said ask anything your heart's desires
[1:28:39] and it shall be produced right here
[1:28:42] and that you know that the lord god of
[1:28:44] heaven answers his scriptures are true
[1:28:47] my the my first time the new gift my
[1:28:50] first anointing i could hardly hear her
[1:28:53] she looked around
[1:28:54] we have been talking about her little
[1:28:56] crippled sister there i said oh no doubt
[1:28:58] in my heart within a few minutes little
[1:29:00] edith will be jumping for the glory of
[1:29:02] god
[1:29:04] hattie looked around all around
[1:29:06] she said brother bill
[1:29:08] my greatest desire
[1:29:11] is for the salvation of my two boys
[1:29:14] amen
[1:29:16] now that's not a mother
[1:29:19] you think about that this morning
[1:29:22] what else could sister had he have asked
[1:29:23] for
[1:29:25] maybe her car was a clunker breaking
[1:29:27] down maybe her house roof was craving in
[1:29:29] maybe
[1:29:30] she uh could ask for uh
[1:29:33] the healing of her sister or family for
[1:29:35] herself she could ask for a million
[1:29:38] dollars to roll through the door and a
[1:29:39] million dollars would roll through the
[1:29:40] door she could ask for anything god told
[1:29:43] brother branham tell her she can have
[1:29:44] whatever she wants
[1:29:46] whatever she says whatever she asks for
[1:29:49] you speak it and it will come to pass
[1:29:52] and that mother's heart could only think
[1:29:54] of one thing
[1:29:57] that was the salvation of her two boys
[1:30:00] now that's the heart of a mother
[1:30:02] despite everything else
[1:30:04] despite all the other things she could
[1:30:06] have asked for
[1:30:07] amen she asked for the right thing and
[1:30:10] god knew it god knew what she was going
[1:30:11] to ask for
[1:30:13] god knew that she was going to ask for
[1:30:15] the salvation of her voice
[1:30:17] god has everything under control like
[1:30:19] that franny knows exactly
[1:30:22] she said i want the salvation and she
[1:30:24] said they had gotten into that ruffian
[1:30:26] teenage years you know where the
[1:30:28] teenagers start acting like their
[1:30:30] know-it-alls and don't need their
[1:30:32] parents anymore and don't want their mom
[1:30:34] hanging around and stuff and they were
[1:30:36] getting rough in she said
[1:30:38] she said i want the salvation of my two
[1:30:40] boys and he says i give them to you in
[1:30:42] the name of the lord jesus christ she
[1:30:44] said those two boys fell on their knees
[1:30:46] before god weeping before the lord
[1:30:49] he said the power of god came so real
[1:30:52] those boys started shaking he said the
[1:30:55] buildings started shaking but those boys
[1:30:57] started shaking so they fell on their
[1:30:59] faces before god weeping and crying
[1:31:02] before the lord
[1:31:03] i don't care
[1:31:05] i don't care
[1:31:07] people that are anti-message will say
[1:31:09] all those boys did this they went out
[1:31:10] and see them blah blah blah whatever i
[1:31:12] don't care where those boys ever ended
[1:31:15] up i don't care what those boys ever did
[1:31:18] in life i don't care where they ever
[1:31:20] went said perform i don't care if they
[1:31:22] were in jail their whole lives i don't
[1:31:24] care what they did
[1:31:26] those boys are going in heaven that's
[1:31:28] right
[1:31:29] those boys are safe
[1:31:31] period
[1:31:32] amen
[1:31:34] but i think of it even in a more real
[1:31:37] sense
[1:31:38] because yes that's wonderful to hear
[1:31:40] about there with brother branham and
[1:31:42] hattie
[1:31:43] but to me it's more real than that
[1:31:46] to me that's a promise to me
[1:31:49] that's right that i have
[1:31:51] that no matter what happens no matter
[1:31:54] where my children or where they may have
[1:31:55] done or when or whatever that doesn't
[1:31:58] matter they're gods and they're going to
[1:32:00] be there
[1:32:01] period there's no question they are
[1:32:03] saved that's right
[1:32:05] there's no discussion
[1:32:08] she got it there and it's a great story
[1:32:10] that we tell and the heart of a mother
[1:32:12] and something that was real friend but
[1:32:14] i'm telling you what's real to me what
[1:32:16] should be real to you
[1:32:18] it doesn't matter where they went it
[1:32:20] doesn't matter what they did
[1:32:22] those boys are saved why because they
[1:32:25] belong to her
[1:32:27] my children are saying why because they
[1:32:29] belong to me
[1:32:30] they belong to my wife
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:34] if there's anything good about our
[1:32:35] children it's because of her
[1:32:37] not me
[1:32:39] god of course
[1:32:41] but
[1:32:42] it's the mother
[1:32:44] anything even actually good about me
[1:32:46] today is my mother
[1:32:49] my dad i love my dad he was a wonderful
[1:32:52] father
[1:32:53] put my feet on the path of truth this
[1:32:56] message
[1:32:57] but it's my mother's reason i'm standing
[1:32:59] here
[1:33:00] amen i believe that in my mother's
[1:33:03] prayers
[1:33:07] it's just one of those things amen the
[1:33:09] prayers of the father is powerful saints
[1:33:12] but there's nothing like the prayer
[1:33:13] beloved that prevails before god
[1:33:15] and i hold on to this promise for me
[1:33:18] as much as had he would there for her
[1:33:22] and
[1:33:23] people say all those boys weren't saved
[1:33:25] to see what people look at they look out
[1:33:27] with their eyes they look at with these
[1:33:29] things sitting in their skulls
[1:33:31] instead of looking at what the promise
[1:33:33] of the word says
[1:33:35] what comes from your heart of what comes
[1:33:37] from this word what god says is more
[1:33:39] powerful than anything else
[1:33:44] isaiah said a virgin is going to
[1:33:45] conceive it took almost 800 years
[1:33:48] but what god said came to pass
[1:33:51] it didn't matter how many women came
[1:33:52] through it didn't matter how many people
[1:33:54] they thought might have been didn't
[1:33:55] matter how many
[1:33:56] uh
[1:33:57] situations they considered or thought of
[1:33:59] it was going to come in god's way in
[1:34:01] god's time with the right person it's
[1:34:03] god's choice
[1:34:06] we're still here today i don't
[1:34:07] understand why we're still here
[1:34:10] but we are
[1:34:11] and i'm thankful we are because it's
[1:34:12] another day to live for god it's another
[1:34:15] day to try to do something for the lord
[1:34:17] jesus
[1:34:18] if we don't have it tomorrow then praise
[1:34:20] the lord we'll do all we can for him
[1:34:21] today
[1:34:22] you know brother branham said i was i
[1:34:25] was going to mention this last week and
[1:34:26] i thought would brother dad hear that i
[1:34:28] wouldn't
[1:34:28] um
[1:34:30] get into preaching but you know brother
[1:34:31] branham said i heard him on a tape the
[1:34:33] other day he said that uh and i didn't
[1:34:36] know this but scripturally but when
[1:34:38] jesus when brother branham talked about
[1:34:41] los angeles california going underneath
[1:34:43] the sea
[1:34:44] sliding into the ocean he said he came
[1:34:47] back and the lord showed him where that
[1:34:48] was in the scripture where jesus cursed
[1:34:50] capernaum in the same way
[1:34:53] he says you exalted in heaven will be
[1:34:55] brought down to hell
[1:34:57] but he said it was almost a hundred
[1:35:00] years now this is the part i didn't know
[1:35:02] it was almost a hundred years before
[1:35:05] capernaum ever slid into the sea jesus
[1:35:07] was long gone by then
[1:35:09] almost a hundred years i thought mine
[1:35:13] that was 1965 when brother brown said
[1:35:16] that god spoke to brother branham what
[1:35:18] are w where are we at today
[1:35:21] i don't know 65 is it going to be the
[1:35:22] same thing who knows but people fret and
[1:35:25] worry and say oh it's still
[1:35:27] has
[1:35:30] it doesn't matter it's been spoken it's
[1:35:32] going to happen
[1:35:34] amen it's going to happen 100 years that
[1:35:36] seems like a long time to us
[1:35:40] i don't i don't even personally know
[1:35:42] anybody that i know personally that's
[1:35:44] lived 100 years i don't think anybody my
[1:35:46] family has
[1:35:47] lived 100 years that's a long time so
[1:35:50] you think about 100 years
[1:35:52] amen
[1:35:55] people are just looking for something
[1:35:56] that's real
[1:35:58] to me i really believe people are just
[1:36:01] looking for something that's real
[1:36:03] and it's up to us to produce that
[1:36:05] reality before them
[1:36:09] let's look at another one
[1:36:11] real quick and we'll close
[1:36:13] exodus chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:36:17] there went a man out of the house of
[1:36:19] levi
[1:36:20] took the wife a daughter of levi
[1:36:24] and the woman conceived and bear a son
[1:36:27] and when she saw him that was a goodly
[1:36:29] child
[1:36:30] she hit him three months because it had
[1:36:32] been a decree of course to kill all the
[1:36:33] babies
[1:36:36] and when she could no longer hide him
[1:36:38] she took him uh took for him an ark of
[1:36:41] full rushes
[1:36:42] dubbed it slammed it with pitch put the
[1:36:45] child there in and she laid in the flags
[1:36:47] of the riverbank
[1:36:49] and his sister stood afar off to wit
[1:36:52] what would be done to him daughter
[1:36:54] pharaoh came down to wash herself to the
[1:36:56] river
[1:36:57] her maids walked along the river's side
[1:36:59] and when she saw the ark among the flags
[1:37:02] she sent her mate to fetch it
[1:37:05] when she had opened it she saw the child
[1:37:08] and behold the babe wept she had
[1:37:11] compassion on him and said this is one
[1:37:13] of the hebrews children even though she
[1:37:15] knew what the pharaohs decree was
[1:37:18] she kept the child
[1:37:20] then said his sister to pharaoh's
[1:37:21] daughter shall i go and call thee a
[1:37:23] nurse
[1:37:24] of the hebrew women that she may nurse
[1:37:26] the child for thee
[1:37:28] pharaoh's daughter said to her go
[1:37:31] the maid went and called the child's
[1:37:32] mother
[1:37:34] not knowing that that was his sister
[1:37:37] pharaoh's daughter's uh
[1:37:39] go made call a child's mother and
[1:37:42] pharaoh's daughter said unto her take
[1:37:44] the child away and nurse it for me and i
[1:37:46] will give you thy wages and the woman
[1:37:47] took the child and nursed it and the
[1:37:49] child grew she brought him into
[1:37:51] pharaoh's daughter and he became her son
[1:37:54] called his name moses and she said
[1:37:56] because i drew him out of the water a
[1:37:58] man a woman's love a mother's
[1:38:01] love again willing to put her son
[1:38:03] trusting god
[1:38:05] having faith enough to trust god to put
[1:38:07] that child in that basket with the
[1:38:09] crocodiles everything else in the nile
[1:38:11] could have drowned it could have flipped
[1:38:13] over anything could have happened to
[1:38:14] that child but put him in the hands of
[1:38:16] god
[1:38:17] rather than in the hands of pharaoh
[1:38:19] pharaoh was willing to kill him but god
[1:38:21] was going to save us and then god
[1:38:24] ironically
[1:38:25] took that child and put him right in
[1:38:27] pharaoh's house
[1:38:29] became second in command the most
[1:38:31] powerful man in the world in the world
[1:38:34] and he was the one that was supposed to
[1:38:36] be the deliverer because of a mother's
[1:38:38] heart
[1:38:40] now that mother's heart that it is his
[1:38:43] sister when told pharaoh's daughter uh
[1:38:47] uh can i find somebody to nurse him for
[1:38:49] you oh yes i'll pay her
[1:38:52] went got her mom
[1:38:54] moses's mother and said here
[1:38:58] and she got to nurse her own child
[1:39:01] phrase she got to take care of and rear
[1:39:03] her own child and got paid to do it
[1:39:07] pharaoh's daughter actually paid moses
[1:39:10] mother to take care of her own child
[1:39:13] because of her faith
[1:39:15] because of her faith because of that
[1:39:18] heart of a mother
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] you remember i closed with this i
[1:39:24] printed it but i'm not going to read it
[1:39:26] it's a little leaky i said i had a
[1:39:27] couple but
[1:39:29] i do this
[1:39:31] almost every mother's day
[1:39:33] but the one thing that meant that uh
[1:39:36] that i think of that i see here
[1:39:38] with humanity getting to the place that
[1:39:40] it's getting
[1:39:42] women and the things that they're doing
[1:39:43] and
[1:39:44] i see women out there screaming and
[1:39:46] yelling because they don't they afraid
[1:39:49] they won't have the ability to kill an
[1:39:51] unborn child
[1:39:53] it makes you wonder
[1:39:56] what would happen if that person if that
[1:39:58] woman if that potential mother
[1:40:02] were to have a child
[1:40:04] or to be a mother
[1:40:06] or to see something that was real
[1:40:10] that hunting trip i talked about so many
[1:40:12] times that brother branham went on his
[1:40:13] friend lizard eyed bird
[1:40:16] and lizard i had that whistle that he
[1:40:18] blew and caused that mother deer to
[1:40:20] stand up because her heart was bleeding
[1:40:22] for her baby or for a baby
[1:40:25] i mean we don't even know for sure
[1:40:27] because
[1:40:29] they make these distinctive sounds these
[1:40:31] these
[1:40:33] fawns
[1:40:34] these babies
[1:40:36] it brother adam said her baby but i
[1:40:38] don't even know that it was really clear
[1:40:40] that she heard her baby because it was
[1:40:43] just bert's whistle but it was a baby
[1:40:47] and in her heart being a mother
[1:40:50] a baby was in distress and she was going
[1:40:52] to risk her life to save him
[1:40:55] she stood up in that
[1:40:57] in that field just as plain as she could
[1:40:59] be
[1:41:00] lizard.bert put that gun right down on
[1:41:02] her and brother random said the deer saw
[1:41:04] the hunter
[1:41:05] and i tell you friend if that deer gets
[1:41:07] a smell a whiff a look or anything of
[1:41:10] anything out of the ordinary her flag is
[1:41:12] up and she's gone yeah
[1:41:14] but she stepped more out in the clearing
[1:41:18] to see what was going on to see that
[1:41:21] baby that was that was in trouble
[1:41:24] recognizing
[1:41:26] it might not have been very much longer
[1:41:28] for her
[1:41:30] and all the testimonies all the
[1:41:32] witnessing
[1:41:33] all that brother branham did to try to
[1:41:35] lead birth to christ
[1:41:37] he still was stoned cold-hearted as he
[1:41:41] always was
[1:41:43] but when that man saw that deer stand up
[1:41:46] and he saw her heart
[1:41:48] getting ready to give her life for her
[1:41:50] baby
[1:41:51] done something to him brother branham
[1:41:54] says he saw something real
[1:41:57] not that what brother branham gave him
[1:41:59] wasn't real
[1:42:00] but for bert that's what it took for god
[1:42:03] to show him that mother
[1:42:06] that godly
[1:42:08] in a dear
[1:42:09] mother it makes me wonder if she'll risk
[1:42:12] her life for a baby that might not have
[1:42:15] even been hers or it wasn't because it's
[1:42:16] just a whistle
[1:42:19] what does that say about human women
[1:42:21] today
[1:42:22] who are willing to just
[1:42:25] in any way
[1:42:26] just kill it kill the children
[1:42:30] just
[1:42:32] kill them all it just shows you how
[1:42:35] ungodly and perverted we've gotten as a
[1:42:37] nation where life is so undervalued
[1:42:41] life is so undervalued
[1:42:44] it's sad to think about that that's
[1:42:46] that's the position that a lot of people
[1:42:48] are in today and fighting
[1:42:51] they're spending their time out
[1:42:54] their sacrificing their meals and their
[1:42:57] sleep just so they can go stand in front
[1:43:00] of a building and yell and scream
[1:43:02] about their ability to kill an unborn
[1:43:05] child
[1:43:07] talk about darkness
[1:43:12] talk about stone cold
[1:43:15] hearted
[1:43:17] friend has gotten to that place
[1:43:20] but i thank god
[1:43:22] they're still godly mothers
[1:43:25] they're still godly mothers
[1:43:28] raise their children in the nursery
[1:43:30] nurture and admonition of god they're
[1:43:31] still godly mothers
[1:43:33] that have faith
[1:43:34] that trust god
[1:43:36] whatever they have need for them for
[1:43:38] their families they still believe and
[1:43:40] trust god
[1:43:41] the sanctity of life is still precious
[1:43:44] to them it means something
[1:43:46] the backbone of a nation
[1:43:49] i believe it's the same thing in
[1:43:51] even in a church
[1:43:53] in that backbone
[1:43:55] that family
[1:43:58] the family that satan has so
[1:44:00] successfully broken up
[1:44:03] in a world of fake and a world to put on
[1:44:06] in a world of comics sci-fi and
[1:44:08] everything else
[1:44:10] there's a reality
[1:44:12] i believe that reality is what we're all
[1:44:14] looking for
[1:44:16] we believe we have
[1:44:18] the world's looking for it the whole
[1:44:20] world
[1:44:22] amen
[1:44:23] we can
[1:44:24] be thirsty for something that god can
[1:44:26] feel
[1:44:28] and we'll be quenched
[1:44:31] we'll always want more
[1:44:33] but will be quenched
[1:44:35] no matter how much alcohol this world
[1:44:37] drinks they'll always want more
[1:44:41] no matter how much drugs they consume
[1:44:43] they're only going to want more no
[1:44:45] matter how many cigarettes or
[1:44:46] e-cigarettes or anything else they puff
[1:44:48] on it's only going to make them want
[1:44:50] more of them
[1:44:52] because it does not satisfy
[1:44:56] it does not satisfy
[1:44:58] praise the lord but thank god god has
[1:45:00] given us something that is real
[1:45:02] you can't get you can't get warm by a
[1:45:05] painted fire
[1:45:06] you can't make a substitute of something
[1:45:08] god put in you
[1:45:10] with something else other than him
[1:45:13] amen
[1:45:15] but i thank god he'd give us these
[1:45:17] examples that we can look to
[1:45:20] of a godly mother of what a mother's
[1:45:22] heart really is what it really means
[1:45:25] amen yes
[1:45:27] as a child
[1:45:29] you're unhappy sometimes because a
[1:45:31] mother's love is as corrective as it is
[1:45:34] ooey gooey mushy huggy lovey kissy
[1:45:37] sometimes it's just as corrective and
[1:45:39] that's just as much the love of god as
[1:45:42] the other
[1:45:43] amen
[1:45:44] praise the lord we'll stand today if we
[1:45:46] could
[1:46:01] as the song sang
[1:46:02] says
[1:46:04] just like the woman at the well
[1:46:07] she was seeking that
[1:46:09] because she had tried
[1:46:11] she'd gone from man to man to man

[1:46:15] real
[1:46:16] she was looking for something that would
[1:46:18] stabilize her something that would feel
[1:46:20] or something that would help her be
[1:46:22] satisfied
[1:46:24] in life
[1:46:27] we have that
