[23:46] &gt;&gt; Pats of course I know on the early
[23:48] mornings Pats are doing fine really and
[23:51] just old that's just and I say that
[23:54] because that's what they say but u I
[23:57] know 10:00 move it up 10:30 is very
[24:00] difficult for them to make service uh
[24:02] 10:00 is almost impossible for them to
[24:04] make service but of course we always
[24:06] continue to remember one another in
[24:08] prayer so we do remember
[24:11] Does anyone else have a request?
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Which one?
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Anyone else?
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. um continue to remember my wife
[24:39] Leah. Um sometimes she has some rough
[24:42] days. She hurts where we did the
[24:45] surgery. Um I've been praying and the
[24:49] last two days she's doing a lot better.
[24:54] Uh but she still uh hasn't had that. She
[24:58] has one grain and u it it's not able to
[25:02] be taken out yet until she meets a
[25:05] certain uh requirement. So just pray
[25:08] that that requirement will be met soon.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; And I can take you to the doctors and I
[25:15] remember myself. I'm having feet
[25:17] problems and um the Lord knows that I
[25:22] believe in this.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Praise the Lord. So please
[25:26] ignore brother Dennis's shoes.
[25:30] He's wearing feelgood boots on his toes.
[25:35] Everybody will be fine with that. It's
[25:37] okay. We understand.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Anyone else?
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Um, we should continue to pray for
[25:45] Patty.
[25:48] It's really taken a toll on her losing.
[25:52] And tell you the truth, it took a toll
[25:55] on me. I feel bad that
[25:58] affected me more with Ron than my
[26:01] brother. I spend a lot of time with
[26:04] &gt;&gt; there's a big difference.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; And I noticed with Patty, she was
[26:10] telling me that she can't sleep at
[26:13] night. So, it's affecting her uh
[26:17] you know, her
[26:19] well her way of
[26:21] &gt;&gt; getting going in the day.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so hopefully,
[26:27] you know, I wish she would give her
[26:30] heart to the Lord.
[26:32] I've been talking to her about that.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Remember, you all know we had prayer
[26:38] many times for Ron. Yes.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; And we had prayer of course for Patty
[26:42] and the family after Ron's passing. So
[26:45] please continue as brother Danny said
[26:49] Ron's wife Patty. So
[26:53] anyone have an unspoken question?
[26:57] Let's stand if we could and ask brother
[26:59] Dennis if you would. to have him back
[27:01] with us if he would take us to the Lord
[27:04] in prayer.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I feel like David said one
[27:07] time, I was glad when he said it unto
[27:10] me, let us go to the house of the Lord.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Lord, thank you,
[27:14] Father. We know as my brother even said,
[27:16] the world's falling apart.
[27:19] There's so many signs that's uh
[27:22] displaying itself that your coming is
[27:25] very close. Oh Jesus.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; And it's time, Father, that we identify
[27:29] ourselves fully with your word.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Your prophet said that the bride will
[27:35] have the seal of God.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; And the rest of the world will take on
[27:40] the mark of the beast.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[27:42] &gt;&gt; it's sobering. Father, there was one
[27:44] message you sent in this day to get a
[27:48] bride ready for a rapture. There's not
[27:50] many messages or many churches you send
[27:53] in your word. You'll reveal your secrets
[27:57] unto your servants, the prophets. And
[27:59] father, as the prophet said, the
[28:02] revelation of the rapture is only to the
[28:05] bride.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; She knows what she needs to do to get
[28:09] ready. Father, it's lamb trimming time.
[28:14] And brother said lamping means to get
[28:17] all that worldliness, all that
[28:19] carnality.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. all that
[28:23] lacks the desical spirits away from us
[28:27] &gt;&gt; to repent daily if we see that we have
[28:31] sinned and come short of the glory of
[28:33] God.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yes God
[28:34] &gt;&gt; we thank you father by your grace you
[28:38] have called us into your marvelous
[28:40] light.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. There's a fountain
[28:43] filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's
[28:46] veins where sinners plunge beneath the
[28:49] flood lose all their guilty state.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, God.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; There's only one place you meet the
[28:54] believer every day. It's under the shed
[28:56] blood of Jesus Christ.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; And father, there's power in the name of
[29:01] Jesus.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; We as the prophet said, you don't have
[29:05] to take any lie, anything from the
[29:08] devil. God has paid the price in full.
[29:13] He's paid the price in full for our
[29:15] healing. Amen. He's paid the price in
[29:18] full for our mental uh welfare. He's
[29:21] paid the price for our finances. He's
[29:24] paid a price for everything. Father,
[29:27] there are many that are sick this
[29:29] morning. Their request has been spoken.
[29:33] Lord, our sister Norma going for the
[29:36] MRI. Father, oh Lord, may you have
[29:40] complete control of this visit with the
[29:44] doctors. May all go well for your honor
[29:48] and glory. Grant it, God. Yes.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; And Father, for our sister Judy Arnold,

[30:04] condition. For you are in control,
[30:07] Father.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; And Lord, all the others that may be uh

[30:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help us to stand on your word
[30:34] to look in the mirror of your word and
[30:37] see the reflection of Jesus Christ. Oh
[30:41] Lord, we're in that hour where you can
[30:46] bring forth the dead in Christ and we'll
[30:49] be taken home, Father, together very
[30:52] soon.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, uh bless each and everyone that
[30:57] raised their hand for unspoken prayer
[30:59] request. May you grant them their
[31:02] heart's desire. You said in your word,

[31:07] give you the desires of your heart. We
[31:09] believe it. Reclaim it. Satan, you have
[31:12] no hold on God's people. I adure you in
[31:16] the name of Jesus Christ to leave him to
[31:19] let go and let God have his way. In your
[31:22] name we pray. Name the Lord Jesus
[31:25] Christ. Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You can be seated if
[31:29] you'd like.

[31:52] for me.

[35:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:00] He carried way more than what little bit
[36:02] we have. Amen. Praise the Lord. Micah
[36:04] has a song, too, to sing for us.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, he has a testimony, too.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was just a brief testimony. I
[36:22] had a brief outpatient, very minor
[36:25] outpatient surgery, having a subdural
[36:27] under the skin cyst removed off my upper
[36:29] thigh. Everything went well. It's just
[36:30] healing. So, thank the Lord. Even though
[36:32] it's minor, anything can happen. Just
[36:34] thankful that it went well.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; This song's been on my heart for the
[36:39] last couple weeks. Um especially given
[36:42] the testimonies and things that have
[36:43] been happening in our midst. So, uh,
[36:46] definitely sing along and encourage you
[36:49] to think of a time when he touched you.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:57] [Music]
[37:00] &gt;&gt; I was shackled
[37:02] by a heavy
[37:06] burden
[37:10] beneath the load of guilt
[37:14] and shame.
[37:17] [Music]
[37:19] There the hand of Jesus
[37:23] touched me.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; And now I am no longer.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; He touched me.
[37:38] Oh,

[38:51] And all
[38:53] the joy that floods my soul.
[38:58] I know that something wonderful
[39:01] happened.
[39:03] And now I know
[39:07] he touched me and made me whole. Let's
[39:13] sing that in first.
[39:15] And since we met our blessed
[39:20] Savior,
[39:24] and since he's cleans and made us whole.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And you know that I will
[39:33] never cease to praise praise.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And we're going to shout it while

[40:17] time.
[40:19] It's because he touched me.
[40:22] Oh
[40:24] Jesus, touch me.
[40:28] And oh
[40:30] the joy that floods my soul.
[40:36] Oh something wonderful happened.
[40:40] And now I know
[40:44] it's because Jesus touched me.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:49] [Music]

[41:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank
[41:02] you Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord. My my.
[41:08] Aren't you so glad he touched you today?
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. Without that
[41:12] touch, where would we be, saints? Amen.
[41:15] without the touch of the Lord Jesus
[41:18] making us whole, not just physically,
[41:21] spiritually.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Praise his holy name, Lord Jesus. Let's
[41:26] stand to our feet if we could. Amen.
[41:28] We'll go to the scripture now.
[41:36] Amen. Thank the Lord Jesus.
[41:44] We're going to go back over to Romans
[41:46] chapter 8 again. Read those couple of
[41:48] verses as we have been the series.
[41:52] Speak on adoption again. This be
[41:54] adoption part 21.
[41:57] Adoption part 21 position in Christ part
[42:00] five.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Adoption 21
[42:05] position in Christ five. And I always
[42:08] forget to
[42:10] have prayer requests. myself. I'm
[42:12] supposed to leave at about 1:30 today,
[42:14] going back to Houston. So, I appreciate
[42:17] your prayers. Supposed to be hot and
[42:19] humid in Houston. Uh,
[42:23] according to the uh weather so far, it's
[42:26] supposed to be 95 every day. And of
[42:29] course, with the humidity, it's probably
[42:30] more like 102, 3,4, something like that.
[42:33] We're doing vacuums, so we're going to
[42:34] be outside all day every day. Uh, but
[42:38] just trusting the Lord to give grace.
[42:40] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[42:43] Romans chapter 8. We're going to begin
[42:46] reading with verse 14 as we normally do.
[42:48] But before we do, we just bow our heads
[42:50] for another word of prayer. Lord Jesus,
[42:52] very thankful, Father, of your grace and
[42:54] mercy to us.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your blessings, your love,
[42:57] your hand of of mercy in our lives and
[43:00] watching over us and keeping us. Thank
[43:02] you Lord for bringing us this place
[43:03] again, Lord. This time, this day, Lord,
[43:06] another Sunday to come in from out of
[43:08] the world to worship and to praise you,
[43:10] God. just looking Lord for wonderful
[43:12] things to happen in our lives Father and
[43:14] for you to bless us exceedingly as you
[43:17] have already done so much Lord God if
[43:19] you have Lord if you'd never do one more
[43:22] thing God I'll just speak for me
[43:24] personally if you never do one more
[43:25] thing for me the rest of my life I have
[43:28] gotten way more than I ever should have
[43:30] gotten Lord and I'm so thankful for your
[43:33] blessings to me God and I know that
[43:35] we're all so very thankful God of the
[43:37] blessings you give to us we pray God
[43:40] that you take now complete control of
[43:42] the main part of this service. Lord God,
[43:44] the ministering of your word, may it
[43:46] come forth with power and manifestation.
[43:49] May it go forth and heals those that are
[43:51] sick in body. May it go forth, Lord, and
[43:53] not return void, but accomplish in each
[43:55] and every one of us what you sent it
[43:57] forth for. Yes.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; May you anoint every ear, every every
[44:01] word that's spoke, Lord. Help every one
[44:03] of us, God, to receive by revelation
[44:05] that that you would have us to see and
[44:08] know through your word, God. on the
[44:09] vindicated word for this day.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; God, we just commit ourselves to you and
[44:13] ask your blessings on on this service
[44:16] now in the precious name of our Lord and
[44:18] Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans chapter 8, read the three
[44:24] verses beginning with 14 as we do. For
[44:27] as many as are led by the spirit of God,
[44:30] they are the sons of God.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. For you have not received the
[44:34] spirit of bondage again to fear, but you
[44:36] have received the spirit of adoption,
[44:38] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." The
[44:41] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[44:42] spirit, that we are the children of God.
[44:45] And if children, then heirs, heirs of
[44:47] God, joint hes with Christ, if so be
[44:49] that we suffer with him, that we may be
[44:52] uh also glorified together. Amen. And
[44:55] you can be seated if you'd like.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:02] Amen. We notice that u we notice that we
[45:05] talked about uh we left off the week
[45:08] before and then last week talking about
[45:11] uh the adoption of Jesus Christ and we
[45:14] went into Matthew 17 and of course tied
[45:16] that to the understanding that uh uh
[45:19] after his adoption he placed in us.
[45:22] Amen. What we need to understand as we
[45:25] become adopted into this same body that
[45:27] we have the same authority that he has
[45:29] as being adopted son. Amen. Understand
[45:33] the difference. And we saw we read where
[45:36] uh not last week but we read previously
[45:38] or Jesus had been baptized. Amen. Been
[45:41] baptized by John. John said uh uh I I
[45:45] need to be baptized of you. He said
[45:47] suffer it to be so. But John baptized
[45:50] Jesus because the sacrifice had to be
[45:52] washed before it was presented. Yes. So
[45:55] John baptized Jesus and as Jesus came up
[45:57] out of the water, the spirit of God,
[45:59] Amen, the spirit of God came down on him
[46:02] in the form of a dove. Amen. And the
[46:05] voice spoke, Amen. of God. Amen. That
[46:09] said, this is my beloved son. Amen. In
[46:13] whom I am well pleased.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But notice the difference between
[46:18] his baptism and his adoption. Amen. And
[46:21] his baptism je uh God said, "This is my
[46:25] beloved son." Yes.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; In whom I am well pleased or pleased
[46:29] whom I dwell to pleased to dwell in.
[46:32] Yes. Amen. This is my son in whom I am
[46:34] well pleased. But when he uh but in
[46:37] Matthew 17 when uh when he was when he
[46:40] received that transfiguration adoption
[46:44] Jesus uh God spoke out and said this is
[46:46] my son my beloved son in whom I well
[46:49] pleased hear ye him.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the difference. The
[46:55] difference between Jesus baptism and his
[46:58] adoption. The words were basically the
[47:01] same except for the last part now
[47:03] because he had been put in that
[47:05] position, that placement of authority.
[47:09] God put Jesus in that placement of
[47:11] authority. And notice right after he was
[47:14] put in that place of authority, he said,
[47:16] "Now if you say to this mountain, amen."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now where does that place us?
[47:20] Because we need to also recognize our
[47:22] position. Amen. In Christ. Notice as the
[47:26] scriptures read, we read this scripture
[47:29] 21 times now because this is part 21. So
[47:32] we've read this scripture to begin this
[47:34] series in every single part. Amen. 21
[47:38] parts. We have read this part where it
[47:40] says that we are the children of God. We
[47:42] are led of God and if children heirs of
[47:45] God and joint hes with Jesus Christ.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So no wonder Jesus the
[47:50] difference in his baptism and his
[47:52] adoption was I am pleased to dwell in
[47:54] him. I am pleased to dwell in him. Hear
[47:57] ye him. Yes.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Now the authority of the spoken word was
[48:01] placed in Jesus. And then Jesus again
[48:04] turned around and said now if you say to
[48:07] this mountain if you say praise the
[48:10] Lord. Now he's taken the authority that
[48:12] he's gotten and he's placed it in his
[48:14] children in the heirs of Christ that we
[48:17] are part of in that position of power
[48:21] that ep uh position of authority and I
[48:23] want to talk about that a little bit
[48:25] today uh today before we go now let's go
[48:27] over to Matthew
[48:30] um chapter 26
[48:32] uh 24 excuse me
[48:36] amen uh no I had it right Matthew 26
[48:40] pardon
[48:41] Matthew 26. I'm going to read one verse
[48:43] of scripture. We'll go over to Matthew
[48:45] 28. We'll read a couple more scriptures
[48:48] there. Amen. Draw our context today.
[48:52] Position in Christ. Again, recognizing
[48:55] that our position in Christ. But look at
[48:57] this now. Jesus said um they brought him
[49:01] for before uh Caps and the Sanhadrin.
[49:05] And to to serve time to read the the
[49:08] whole story, let's just read 64. Verse
[49:10] 64. Matthew 26:64. And Jesus said unto
[49:14] him, thou hast said, "Nevertheless, I
[49:18] say unto you, hereafter,
[49:20] I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see
[49:23] the son of man sitting on the right hand
[49:26] of power and coming in the clouds of
[49:29] heaven."
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:32] The right hand is a position of
[49:35] authority. The right hand is a position
[49:38] of power. Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you took the scripture without
[49:42] revelation or you took it just as it is
[49:45] literally written, you would have God
[49:48] first of all with a literal hand. And
[49:50] God doesn't have a literal hand. God's a
[49:52] spirit.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you would have God with a
[49:56] literal right hand. And you would have
[49:59] Jesus sitting on that right hand.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a revelation of
[50:05] scripture, if you just took it for face
[50:07] value, it said the son of man sitting on
[50:10] the right hand. I mean, if someone
[50:13] didn't understand the scripture, if you
[50:14] just take and read it for face value,
[50:17] you've got God with a hand and Jesus
[50:19] sitting on it as two different people,
[50:21] first of all, which God's just one God,
[50:23] which we'll read in just a minute.
[50:26] You'll have God at least two people. You
[50:28] chop him up into two pieces. Most people
[50:30] uh chop him up into three, but you can
[50:32] chop him up up into two. You can have
[50:35] Jesus sitting on the hand of God, which
[50:38] again, God doesn't have a hand. He's a
[50:40] spirit. And he's not sitting on his
[50:42] right hand, but he's sitting on the
[50:44] right hand of power.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power that represents you look
[50:48] through all the scriptures. Amen. The
[50:50] represent called that into being, you
[50:52] see that that right hand of power is a
[50:55] is a is a position of authority. It's a
[50:58] position of power. Amen. the power of
[51:01] God that God had when God told those
[51:04] that were there in attendance, of
[51:06] course, and he's told us through the
[51:07] reading of the scripture, hear ye him,
[51:10] that authority and that power
[51:12] transferred, which we've already gone
[51:15] through many times about a man and
[51:17] raising a son and having tutors over
[51:19] that son and that son getting to the
[51:21] place that he's grown and he's ready to
[51:23] take authority and power over what the
[51:25] the father wants him to take over. And
[51:28] uh he's got a good report. Uh he's he's
[51:32] pleasing to me. He's done everything I
[51:34] said. He's he's accomplished everything.
[51:36] And the dad uh and and in pride is
[51:40] thankful for his son to be able to turn
[51:42] over this to his son. He says, "Hear ye
[51:45] him."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But again, don't forget right
[51:49] after he was given that authority,
[51:51] before the chapter even ends, Jesus
[51:53] comes down off the Mount of
[51:54] Transfiguration and he tells his
[51:56] disciples, "If you say,"
[51:59] &gt;&gt; so he's telling us. Now, let's go over
[52:01] to uh Matthew 28. Let's read a couple of
[52:04] verses of scripture here.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; So, the right hand is the right hand.
[52:08] Authority and power is a representation
[52:12] of that of that right hand.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he tells Caes and the whole
[52:18] Sanhadrred, amen, you will see the son
[52:21] of man, amen, ascending. He will be uh
[52:24] on the right hand of the father, the
[52:27] right hand of power. Amen. Now verse uh
[52:32] uh let's start with 18. Matthew 28:18.
[52:36] And Jesus came and spake unto them,
[52:39] saying, "All power is given unto me in
[52:44] heaven and in earth."
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All power is given unto
[52:49] me in heaven and in earth. That's just
[52:51] what he told Capus and the Sanhadrin. He
[52:55] told them the exact same thing. You see
[52:57] him on the right hand of power. Praise
[53:00] the Lord. And now he's saying, "All
[53:03] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[53:07] earth." That's his adoption. That's his
[53:09] placement of adoption. Amen. Hear ye
[53:12] him.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Now, we must find our position or know
[53:17] what our position is. Yes.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; But let's continue to read. All power is
[53:22] given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[53:25] Go ye therefore and teach all nations,
[53:29] baptizing them in the Nam
[53:32] [Music]
[53:34] name.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We understand that.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do we know what a name
[53:40] is?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Good. What is a name?
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Newton Bennett is my name.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; George Newton Bennett III. The third is
[53:52] what separates me from my grandpa and my
[53:54] dad
[53:55] &gt;&gt; is the fact that I'm a third. The fourth
[53:58] is what separates my son from me and my
[54:01] dad and my grandpa because he was George
[54:04] Bennett the fourth. Amen. That that even
[54:06] that little bit separates us. That's our
[54:09] name. Amen. But if I stood here and
[54:13] said, "Father," how many of you would
[54:14] stand up? I know Dennis has fathered
[54:17] children. I know Danny's father
[54:18] children. Amen, Steve. Amen. Or I would
[54:22] stand. Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I've children. I'm as much
[54:28] a father as Dennis is. Amen. But if I go
[54:31] through that door and I say, "Father,
[54:33] five of us are going to walk to the
[54:35] door."
[54:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz who are they talking about?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Jesus said in the name,
[54:43] praise the Lord, the name of the father
[54:46] and of the son and of the holy ghost.
[54:49] What is that name? And notice that word
[54:52] name is not plural,
[54:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Because there's not but one God.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; There's not two and there's not three.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; There's not a dozen. There's not 50.
[55:03] There's one.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the Lord God Almighty.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ. What is his name?
[55:12] Jesus Christ.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is his name. He is Jesus the
[55:18] anointed.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord of all, Lord Jesus
[55:22] Christ, father, son, holy ghost. He is
[55:25] one is God. Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; That's why there's no contradiction.
[55:31] As a lot of people would say, there's
[55:33] contradiction in the Bible. And a lot of
[55:36] actually a lot of very smart biblical
[55:40] people and and and ministers and and and
[55:43] I I wouldn't say scholars but studying
[55:45] the Bible.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Can't answer
[55:50] the difference between Matthew 28:19
[55:55] and and and Acts 2:38.
[55:58] They don't know the difference,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there is no difference.
[56:03] But they can't reconcile the two. I've
[56:06] even had I mean
[56:10] pastors that's ministered for 20, 30
[56:12] years come and tell me, "Well, I'll just
[56:15] take what Jesus said." And what kind of
[56:17] an answer is that to the scripture,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm like, "Okay, well then what do
[56:21] you do with Acts 2:38?" Well, it's it's
[56:24] just in there. And you know, I I they
[56:27] don't know,
[56:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:28] &gt;&gt; They don't know. If you try to
[56:30] characterize a difference between the
[56:32] two, then you've got a problem. Amen.
[56:36] Because they don't know. That's one
[56:38] reason they have a problem with the
[56:39] Godhead. Because they don't know. Amen.
[56:42] Is there two? Is there three? How many
[56:45] is there?
[56:47] They don't know. Without revelation,
[56:49] they won't know.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; But there is no difference between
[56:53] Matthew 28:19 and Acts 2:38. There's no
[56:56] difference.
[56:58] Jesus said, "In the name of the Father,
[57:00] Son, and the Holy Ghost," Peter came out
[57:02] and told us what that name was.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:07] And and not to mention, Peter's got to
[57:10] be very, very careful here. Amen. First
[57:13] of all, he just received the Holy Ghost.
[57:16] All of them, 120 up room, all got the
[57:19] Holy Ghost. So God came and is now
[57:22] living in Peter.
[57:24] So be careful what you say, Peter. Not
[57:27] that we can't say things that we
[57:28] shouldn't. No, we've got the Holy Ghost.
[57:30] But he had just come out of the
[57:33] inspiration of the anointing of the Holy
[57:36] Spirit and the indwelling presence of
[57:37] the Holy Spirit.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He's come out as the spokesman of the
[57:41] group. And he declared what the name of
[57:44] the Father, Son, the Holy Ghost was. And
[57:46] it's Jesus Christ.
[57:49] He declared that. But Peter's got to be
[57:51] very careful. Not only did he just get
[57:53] the Holy Ghost, but just a few chapters
[57:56] earlier,
[57:58] Jesus gave Peter by the authority of
[58:01] heaven the keys to the kingdom of heaven
[58:04] and told him, "Whatever you bind on
[58:07] earth is bound in heaven."
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Wh what else do we need? Amen. Peter, be
[58:16] careful what you say cuz what you're
[58:18] binding here is going to be bound in
[58:19] heaven.
[58:21] Well, there can't be any contradiction
[58:23] because the God that's living in Peter
[58:25] there, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit,
[58:29] God himself is, if he's living in Peter,
[58:32] then what is Peter going to say? He
[58:34] can't say anything else but what the
[58:36] scriptures already said. And that
[58:38] scripture is the name of the father,
[58:39] son, and the holy ghost, which is the
[58:41] Lord Jesus Christ.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It's not hard. It's not complicated. It
[58:47] just takes revelation to see it.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I again I have I have
[58:51] literally had ministers tell me, "Well,
[58:54] I'll just take what Jesus said." I've
[58:57] actually had them tell me that when
[58:59] challenging them about about Matthew
[59:01] 28:19 and Acts 2:38 challenging about
[59:04] well I'll just take what Jesus said
[59:08] forgetting about all the scripture
[59:11] and then not only that but to ask them
[59:16] after that challenge them in that light
[59:20] with what I just told you. I said then
[59:23] show me one person
[59:27] that was ever baptized scripturally in
[59:30] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Show me
[59:32] one.
[59:34] There's not one.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; In the entire Bible, in the entire New
[59:38] Testament,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; after after Pentecost, after the filling
[59:42] of the Holy Ghost, there's not one
[59:45] scripture where anybody was ever
[59:48] baptized, Father, Son, and the Holy
[59:49] Ghost. And you won't find it in history
[59:51] until 320 AD when the Catholic Church
[59:53] formed and started doing it
[59:55] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Satan's way of annihilating or
[59:59] eliminating the name of Jesus.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. To where then everything just
[1:00:03] became about father, son, and holy
[1:00:05] ghost.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; That's Satan eliminating it. Although
[1:00:07] the scripture tells us that the
[1:00:10] scripture tells us that all that we are
[1:00:12] to do in word or in deed,
[1:00:18] right? to do in the name of Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; I to me it's not complicated,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; It just makes perfect sense because
[1:00:27] that's what the Bible says. And and you
[1:00:29] can't say you're going against what
[1:00:31] Jesus said because you're not
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; because he said in the name of the
[1:00:37] Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:00:39] And we know what that name was. Peter
[1:00:41] just clarified what the name was. Acts
[1:00:43] 238 is just a clarification of of
[1:00:46] Matthew 28:19. His name is Jesus.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be identified with that name
[1:00:53] in every aspect of my life,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; including my baptism.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Baptizing them.
[1:01:02] It is that okay now? Baptizing them in
[1:01:05] the name of the Father, Son, and of the
[1:01:07] Holy Ghost. Name singular because he's
[1:01:10] God. Singular.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Teaching them to observe all things
[1:01:14] whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo,
[1:01:16] I am with you always, even unto the end
[1:01:19] of the world. All power was given unto
[1:01:23] him. All power was given unto him in
[1:01:26] heaven and earth. Amen. Now, let's go
[1:01:30] into let's go into humanity for a
[1:01:32] minute. Now, let's go into we talked
[1:01:34] about Jesus again, like we said last
[1:01:37] week, but what about us? Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; What about me and you? Let's go over to
[1:01:41] Revelations chapter 5.
[1:01:47] pick him up again in Revelations chapter
[1:01:49] 5,
[1:01:51] gone through the church ages. You can
[1:01:53] see over in Revelation 1,
[1:01:57] uh, beautiful, but I wanted to try to
[1:01:59] condense this a little bit.
[1:02:01] If you go over to uh Revelation chapter
[1:02:04] 1,
[1:02:07] you'll see that
[1:02:13] uh let's see
[1:02:16] uh 19th verse. Write these things which
[1:02:18] thou has seen and the things which are
[1:02:20] and the things which shall h be
[1:02:23] hereafter. The mystery of the seven
[1:02:25] stars which thou sawest in thy right
[1:02:27] hand. Amen. Seven stars of the right
[1:02:30] hand and the seven golden candlesticks.
[1:02:33] The seven stars of the angels of the
[1:02:35] seven church ages in his right hand. The
[1:02:39] seven golden candlesticks. Thou saw us
[1:02:41] the seven churches. The seven church
[1:02:42] ages. The seven churches that we are a
[1:02:44] part of. A messenger to each church age.
[1:02:49] A star to coincide with every
[1:02:52] candlestick.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. A messenger to each age. first,
[1:02:57] second, third, on down to this age.
[1:03:00] Amen. A messenger where in his right
[1:03:02] hand. Praise the Lord. Now, look,
[1:03:05] Revelation chapter 5. I'm kind of
[1:03:07] skimming over some of this. Most we
[1:03:09] probably mostly know uh what I'm getting
[1:03:12] into, but Revelation 5. And I saw in his
[1:03:16] where?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Right hand. I saw in the right hand of
[1:03:21] him that sat on the throne a book
[1:03:25] written within and on the backside
[1:03:27] sealed with seven seals. Now who is this
[1:03:29] sitting on the throne?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; It's God because he's got the book of
[1:03:34] redemption in his hand because remember
[1:03:36] we already went through in the parts of
[1:03:38] this series and I hate to keep
[1:03:40] hearkening back but try to bring them
[1:03:42] back to our remembrance. So, if you've
[1:03:44] if you've missed parts of this, it makes
[1:03:46] more sense if you've heard every part,
[1:03:48] but we we hearken back and go back to
[1:03:51] where we were when we were in the Garden
[1:03:53] of Eden with Adam and Eve and what
[1:03:55] happened to Adam and what happened
[1:03:56] during the fall and what happened to the
[1:03:59] book of life. So, Adam had this book of
[1:04:01] redemption. Amen. He had this book in
[1:04:04] his hand, in his possession. It was his
[1:04:07] rightful uh uh duty because he didn't
[1:04:10] have to go through what Jesus did and
[1:04:13] what we went through to bring us back to
[1:04:16] that place again. He started out there
[1:04:18] because he was the spoken word of God.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; He was the spoken word son of God. Amen.
[1:04:25] And he had this earth in his control. He
[1:04:28] had the book of redemption in his hand.
[1:04:30] But remember what happened when he lost
[1:04:32] that book. The book didn't go into the
[1:04:34] filthy hands of Satan who could not take
[1:04:37] it. It went into the hands of the
[1:04:39] original owner. Who's the original
[1:04:40] owner? God.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Because everything in that book came
[1:04:44] from him.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Everything that is in that book came
[1:04:48] from God because that book is in that
[1:04:51] book contains who God is.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the ex and who God is is is a
[1:04:58] part of his expression is in that book.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If because we have to look
[1:05:04] at it as a literal book like like we
[1:05:07] would here or or old-fashioned book if
[1:05:09] you will where they had scrolls they
[1:05:11] real they rolled up and and then they
[1:05:13] unrolled the scroll which was the
[1:05:16] equivalent of what we have as a book
[1:05:17] today. Amen. But contained in that book
[1:05:21] the equivalence of what was in that book
[1:05:23] was was God expressed.
[1:05:27] Amen. In there was the expression of
[1:05:30] God.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what was in that book was
[1:05:33] all the names as we go as we could go to
[1:05:36] Revelation 17. Uh in that book was all
[1:05:42] the names, the lamb's book of life,
[1:05:43] those whose names were written before
[1:05:45] the foundation of the world.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can go to Revelation and read
[1:05:49] that. But let's keep going. U and find
[1:05:52] in there that's the expression of God.
[1:05:55] Amen. There that book was an expression
[1:05:58] and expression of God. Right?
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; You are in that book. If you are born
[1:06:03] again and you're a part of God and uh
[1:06:07] you are God's, you are filled with the
[1:06:10] Holy Spirit. You you are a part of the
[1:06:12] family of God. You are the expression of
[1:06:14] God. You you are that expression.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You just come forth into life into
[1:06:20] a human body.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. As God did. As God a as God was
[1:06:25] there and he looked over what he
[1:06:26] created. He sent the logos. It wasn't
[1:06:29] another person. Listen to me. It wasn't
[1:06:32] another person. It was the logos of God
[1:06:35] that went forth and brewed over the
[1:06:38] earth.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; It's the same logos that came in the
[1:06:41] form of Melzdc. It's the same logos that
[1:06:44] was in Jesus Christ. It's the same God
[1:06:47] all along.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; If we could just see it.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; It's the same God.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That was an expression of God. This book
[1:06:55] was an expression of God. So it was in
[1:06:58] his right hand, the hand of power and
[1:07:02] authority. Again, God doesn't have a
[1:07:04] right hand, but as we have it written
[1:07:06] here, in the right hand of him that sat
[1:07:09] on the throne. That book was in the
[1:07:11] power and authority of God because it
[1:07:13] was his book. It was him expressed
[1:07:17] expression of God. If you were in that
[1:07:19] book, saints, you're an expression of
[1:07:21] God. That's all you are.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's where we go back first John 3.
[1:07:26] That seed of God that was in you, amen,
[1:07:29] was to be you from before the foundation
[1:07:31] of the world. That's when God put your
[1:07:34] name on the lamb's book of life.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; That expression came forth in a human
[1:07:39] being. And each one of us have a name.
[1:07:45] We're all human beings.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, you talk about we talked about a
[1:07:49] minute ago about father. What if
[1:07:50] somebody come and walked through the
[1:07:51] door and said, "Hey, human being."
[1:07:55] Well, even Gabriel and Alice would walk
[1:07:57] through the door. Why? We're all human
[1:07:59] beings.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not my name.
[1:08:03] Praise the Lord. Amen. George, you've
[1:08:07] been at third. That's my name.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But that expression came
[1:08:12] into human flesh. Now, let's let's see
[1:08:15] what this book now on the right hand or
[1:08:18] the th the in the authority. See, I read
[1:08:20] that so we could understand God does not
[1:08:22] have a right hand in the authority. the
[1:08:25] power of him that sat on the throne, a
[1:08:28] book written within and on the backside
[1:08:30] sealed with seven seals.
[1:08:32] And I saw a strong angel. Amen. A strong
[1:08:36] angel. That's not Jesus now. Amen. This
[1:08:39] is a strong angel. A strong angel that
[1:08:42] come forth proclaiming with a loud
[1:08:45] voice, who is worthy to open the book
[1:08:49] and to loose the seals thereof?
[1:08:53] And no man in heaven
[1:08:55] nor in earth though m- an no man in
[1:08:58] heaven nor in earth neither under the
[1:09:01] earth was able to open the book neither
[1:09:04] to even look upon it or it says look
[1:09:07] thereon.
[1:09:08] No one no man able to even look on the
[1:09:11] book much less touch it much less open
[1:09:14] it.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not even look upon it. No man was
[1:09:18] able to open the book neither to look
[1:09:20] thereon. And I wept much. John wept
[1:09:23] much. John the revelator. And I wept
[1:09:26] much because no man m an no man was
[1:09:32] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:09:35] book neither to look thereon. Now why
[1:09:38] was John weeping?
[1:09:41] because he knew that if nobody prevailed
[1:09:45] to come forth who was worthy to take and
[1:09:48] to remove those seals and to open that
[1:09:51] book that all humanity would have been
[1:09:54] lost.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Every name on that book would have been
[1:09:58] lost.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; All humanity would have been lost. Oh
[1:10:03] my, what a pickle. No wonder John was
[1:10:05] weeping. No wonder John was crying
[1:10:08] because I believe he knew his name was
[1:10:10] in that book.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I think he also he also knew
[1:10:15] that all the names that were the
[1:10:17] redemptive names are in that book.
[1:10:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know what my name is in
[1:10:23] that book. I just know the earthly name
[1:10:25] my parents gave me. Amen. But whatever
[1:10:27] my heavenly name is, which I'm assuming
[1:10:30] is not going to be George N. Bennett
[1:10:32] III, whatever that is is in that book.
[1:10:35] Yeah. Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And unless that book were to be
[1:10:38] opened, those seals to be taken off and
[1:10:40] that book to be opened, all of that was
[1:10:43] in there would stayed sealed up.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Because remember
[1:10:48] when we go back again to the Garden of
[1:10:51] Eden?
[1:10:52] When was it that they were to come
[1:10:55] forth?
[1:10:58] Amen. If you go back to creation,
[1:11:02] when were they to come forth?
[1:11:05] when their name was spoke,
[1:11:08] when their name was spoke, that's when
[1:11:11] they were to come forth.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; When God created man, he gave him the
[1:11:17] book. Now, again, I go back here. Uh,
[1:11:19] please help me, Lord, if I'm I try not
[1:11:22] to venture without authority, but I I I
[1:11:25] can't help but look at the scripture and
[1:11:27] see what God was doing in the Garden of
[1:11:29] Eden and where he's restoring us back
[1:11:32] to, what the purpose in the beginning
[1:11:34] was when when Adam had the book. Why
[1:11:38] would Adam have the book if he wasn't
[1:11:40] responsible for opening the book and
[1:11:42] reading the names as each one was to
[1:11:44] come forth in his decree time and
[1:11:46] season?
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as that name was spoke is when
[1:11:52] it came forth,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't if it was a waiting for
[1:11:56] that time, then what what are we doing
[1:11:58] here?
[1:12:00] You could have been back 3,000 years ago
[1:12:03] or whatever it was.
[1:12:06] But it was a decreed time and season. We
[1:12:08] talked about and read last week at the
[1:12:11] fullness of time. At the fullness of the
[1:12:14] appointed appointment of a specific
[1:12:18] time, this was this is when that was to
[1:12:21] happen.
[1:12:23] At that specific time that we were to
[1:12:26] come forth,
[1:12:28] but because the book is sealed, those
[1:12:30] names are sealed,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; They're in the book. The expression of
[1:12:34] God is still in there.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; But unless it's open and revealed and
[1:12:38] expressed, then what will we to do?
[1:12:42] Amen. Live in the dark.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; No man was worthy. Nobody.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And it's no wonder John John was upset.
[1:12:49] He was weeping because no man was found
[1:12:52] worthy. Not even to even look on the
[1:12:54] book.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; But oh, praise the Lord.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Around 2,000 years ago, we had a kinsman
[1:13:01] redeemer come. Yes.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And fulfill every purpose and point of a
[1:13:08] kinsman redeemer from the from the Old
[1:13:10] Testament and became our kinsman
[1:13:13] redeemer. Not because he's a Bennett of
[1:13:16] a a Katy or whatever your last name. It
[1:13:20] wasn't because of that, but be- but
[1:13:23] because he came into human form like one
[1:13:25] of us.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the form of a man. The Bible
[1:13:30] says in the form of man. in the form in
[1:13:32] the likeness in the likeness of sinful
[1:13:36] flesh. His flesh wasn't sinful, but it
[1:13:39] was in the likeness as a kinsman to us.
[1:13:43] He became in human form.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God for that
[1:13:47] kinsman, friend, because the fifth verse
[1:13:49] says, "And one of the elders said unto
[1:13:51] me, weep not. Behold, the line of the
[1:13:54] tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath
[1:13:56] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:13:58] the seals thereof." Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our kinsbury redeemer has come
[1:14:02] forth to claim what is his.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; This is the ones that he died for.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; This is the ones he went to Calvary for.
[1:14:11] This is the ones he gave his life for
[1:14:13] was the names in that book so he could
[1:14:16] come forth with the authority and power
[1:14:18] and take that book.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. Now I know it says the
[1:14:23] line of the tribe of Judah, but look
[1:14:25] what's happened when I beheld. I lo and
[1:14:28] lo, in the midst of the throne of the
[1:14:29] four beasts, in the midst of the elders
[1:14:31] stood a lamb. Amen. Because lion
[1:14:34] represents judgment.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when John turned around, he
[1:14:39] saw mercy.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; The lamb, the blood of the lamb
[1:14:43] represents mercy.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And when he looked, he saw a lamb as it
[1:14:46] had been slaying. Bloody lamb
[1:14:49] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[1:14:52] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:14:54] into all the earth. and he came and took
[1:14:57] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:14:59] that sat on the throne. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that our kinsman redeemer
[1:15:04] was found worthy to take that book.
[1:15:07] Amen. To take out of the right hand of
[1:15:10] the ownership of God. And he was able to
[1:15:14] worthy to take the book. Worthy to
[1:15:17] loosen the seals. And and because it was
[1:15:20] him, that lamb, the mercy of God, open
[1:15:24] that book so that the names could be
[1:15:27] revealed, so that the names could be
[1:15:28] opened, so that the names could be
[1:15:30] exposed and the expression of God could
[1:15:33] be fulfilled.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Now, we go over to Revelation 10
[1:15:41] in the right hand, power, authority.
[1:15:46] He saw that book, took that book because
[1:15:50] he was cold. Could you imagine? Can you
[1:15:52] imagine what what John's weeping turned
[1:15:55] into?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; He went from weeping and crying to
[1:15:59] rejoicing and celebrating and shouting.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I know sometimes
[1:16:06] people probably look and say, "You ought
[1:16:07] to keep it down a little bit. How can
[1:16:09] you?" I I mean, my question to them is,
[1:16:11] "How can you?" I I I just
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; how when you know what God has done,
[1:16:17] when you know where you are in that
[1:16:18] book, when you know what God has given
[1:16:20] to, how can you be quiet?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; How can you be?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I imagine all of heaven heard John
[1:16:28] shouting and worshiping and praising.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Revelation 10. And I saw
[1:16:34] another mighty angel
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; come down. Now, another mighty angels
[1:16:38] beyond the the the uh the the church
[1:16:42] ages. We went through the church ages
[1:16:44] then and we went through the plagues and
[1:16:46] then and those things and trumpets and
[1:16:49] we get to the 10th verse. So, when he
[1:16:51] talks about another mighty angel coming
[1:16:54] down,
[1:16:55] he says, "A mighty angel come down."
[1:16:57] Now, not the strong angel. Amen. But a
[1:17:01] mighty angel because the strong angel
[1:17:04] was declaring or proclaiming who is
[1:17:07] worthy to take this book and who is
[1:17:09] worthy to loose the seals.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; But another mighty angel come down from
[1:17:16] heaven and this is what differentiates
[1:17:19] him. Clothes with a cloud. You find him
[1:17:21] over in Revelation one. Same way. And a
[1:17:24] rainbow was upon his head. the covenant
[1:17:27] angel which is Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The covenant angel with co clothed
[1:17:34] in a cloud as we've seen him and a
[1:17:37] rainbow upon his head as we know that
[1:17:39] covenant is. Amen. You can go back in
[1:17:41] the Old Testament and see when the
[1:17:43] rainbow came forth. And I know the the
[1:17:45] homosexuals have tried to steal that but
[1:17:47] it doesn't belong to them. It belongs to
[1:17:49] us.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It belongs to God.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; This is God's token. Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I Heath It's just been perverted
[1:17:56] the way it has in the world today. But
[1:17:58] this is God stoken.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; A rainbow upon his head. That coveted
[1:18:02] angel. His face was where the sun is and
[1:18:04] feet as pillars of fire. And who others
[1:18:06] could that be but but Jesus Christ.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ. Now standing there.
[1:18:13] Amen.
[1:18:16] His face is a sun. His feet is pillars
[1:18:18] of fire. And he had in his hand a little
[1:18:21] book. And it was what? Open. So that
[1:18:25] means between the fifth ver chapter and
[1:18:28] the 10th chapter, the book's been
[1:18:29] opened.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God that book was open.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. A little book opened. And he set
[1:18:38] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:18:41] foot upon the earth. Why? Because he had
[1:18:42] all power in heaven and in earth. Amen.
[1:18:46] The sea and the land. It was a complete
[1:18:50] total conquering through the authority
[1:18:52] and power given complete total
[1:18:55] conquering of heaven and earth of the
[1:18:58] earth uh of uh ground and earth sea over
[1:19:03] everything over everybody complete power
[1:19:07] complete authority.
[1:19:09] Amen. On one foot on land, one foot on
[1:19:12] sea on the earth. And he cried with a
[1:19:14] loud voice as when a lion roth. And when
[1:19:17] he had cried, seven thunders uttered
[1:19:18] their voices. And when the seven
[1:19:21] thunders had uttered their voices, I was
[1:19:22] about to write, I heard a voice which uh
[1:19:24] from heaven, saying unto me, sell those
[1:19:26] things which the seven thunders uttered,
[1:19:28] write them not. The angel which I saw
[1:19:30] stand upon the sea and upon the earth,
[1:19:31] lifted up his hand to heaven. Swear by
[1:19:33] him that liveth forever and ever, who
[1:19:35] created heaven and earth, uh heaven, and
[1:19:37] the things that are therein, the earth,
[1:19:39] the things that therein are, and the
[1:19:41] sea, and the things which are therein,
[1:19:43] that there should be time no longer.
[1:19:45] Amen. Amen. No more a delay of time.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. What does the scripture tell us?
[1:19:51] Matthew
[1:19:53] Matthew tells us that for the elect's
[1:19:55] sake, this time end time should be cut
[1:19:59] short.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it says otherwise there'd be
[1:20:03] no flesh sake.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you look around, you
[1:20:09] wonder if it hadn't got to that point.
[1:20:11] But thank God it's not. And it won't be.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; At least not while the bride's here.
[1:20:15] Amen. When she's gone, it's a different
[1:20:17] story, right?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; You have chaos. And but in the days of
[1:20:21] the voice of the seventh angel, praise
[1:20:24] the Lord.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; When he shall begin to sound, the
[1:20:29] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[1:20:31] had declared to his servants, the
[1:20:32] prophets. Now, don't get me wrong. I
[1:20:34] believe that seventh angel was a seventh
[1:20:35] angel through his entire life. Amen.
[1:20:38] Just like you were born to be who you
[1:20:40] were for your entire life. But just like
[1:20:43] Jesus, just like every one of us, he had
[1:20:47] to come to his place of adoption,
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; He had to come to his place of adoption
[1:20:52] just like all the rest of us did
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; or do. Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And I want to read something
[1:21:02] a quote from the breach. I know remember
[1:21:05] you all know brother Brand preached God
[1:21:08] in simplicity before he even began to
[1:21:12] approach the seals before the breach was
[1:21:15] God in simplicity. Amen. The next
[1:21:18] service now it wasn't in Jeffersonville.
[1:21:21] It was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. But
[1:21:23] the next service after the seventh seal
[1:21:25] was preached in Jeffersonville. He
[1:21:27] preached again
[1:21:29] God in simplicity. He bookend he
[1:21:33] bookended. Is that a word? Sorry, I'm
[1:21:35] not a math English teacher. He bookended
[1:21:39] I'm going to say it's a word. He
[1:21:40] bookended
[1:21:42] the seals with God in simplicity.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe that was an
[1:21:46] accident. Of course, I don't believe
[1:21:48] anything God does is an accident, but
[1:21:50] the the seals but uh the God in
[1:21:53] simplicity. But the the second message
[1:21:55] was the breach.
[1:21:57] And notice the breach was preached.
[1:22:00] Amen. before the first seal was opened,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Because we know that each day that angel
[1:22:10] come into that room and revealed or
[1:22:13] opened to brother Brandham that seal for
[1:22:16] that day,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; for that time, for that night, each day.
[1:22:20] Amen. He didn't come in all seven right
[1:22:23] there. No. When when brother Brandham
[1:22:26] left the pull pit on the night of the
[1:22:27] first seal, he didn't know any more
[1:22:30] about the second than anybody else.
[1:22:33] Amen. It was the next day in that room
[1:22:37] again that the angel visited him and
[1:22:39] gave him that the second seal.
[1:22:42] Amen. But look now, so in in in in
[1:22:46] setting that up because I'm going to
[1:22:48] close here in just a few minutes. In
[1:22:49] setting that up, let's look at this
[1:22:51] breach this quote for a minute. Now,
[1:22:54] keep in mind, Brother Brandham had to be
[1:22:57] adopted just like the rest of us,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. When that time was, I don't know.
[1:23:02] Amen. I have an inkling. I I have a
[1:23:05] suspicion. I have a feeling. Amen. But
[1:23:08] I'm not going to say it that there
[1:23:11] there's some things that that I feel
[1:23:13] that I
[1:23:16] have a revelation or something the Lord
[1:23:17] has showed me maybe that that I've
[1:23:19] shared with you uh such as maybe the
[1:23:22] sinking of California things the timing
[1:23:24] and things but I I this I just I feel
[1:23:28] checked. I I just don't think I should
[1:23:30] I'm going to not going to give you my
[1:23:31] feeling about this. But I am going to
[1:23:33] read you this. you draw your own
[1:23:35] conclusions
[1:23:36] in the breach
[1:23:39] March 1963.
[1:23:42] And he saw one sitting upon the throne.
[1:23:44] Now he's reading or or he's talking
[1:23:47] about the scripture we just read in
[1:23:49] Revelation 5.
[1:23:51] And he saw one sitting upon the throne
[1:23:53] with this book in his hand in his right
[1:23:55] hand. Brother says, "Think of it now."
[1:23:59] And then in this book was the title deed
[1:24:02] of redemption.
[1:24:05] Every name the redemption.
[1:24:08] And it was sealed with seven seals.
[1:24:12] And then an angel came forth, a strong
[1:24:14] angel. Look at this now. A strong angel
[1:24:19] proclaiming with a loud voice, who was
[1:24:22] worthy to open the book or to take the
[1:24:25] book? Who was able to open the seals?
[1:24:28] Who was able to open this book? See, the
[1:24:31] angel asked it.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; John saw it and he said, "Now, oh, who's
[1:24:37] worthy?
[1:24:39] Let him."
[1:24:41] I'm still reading the quote.
[1:24:43] Let him.
[1:24:45] Brother Brandon pauses. He says, "Oh my,
[1:24:49] maybe I'm just feeling this way."
[1:24:53] So, what was he feeling?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, it's the stirring of
[1:24:58] the Holy Ghost. That's what it was.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God moving on him.
[1:25:02] When that when that when that tone is
[1:25:05] struck, friend,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; uh maybe maybe you can see it in me
[1:25:09] sometimes or other ministers. When that
[1:25:11] tone is struck, it's it things change.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Things change. But it changed. And you
[1:25:18] know, it changed a lot in his ministry,
[1:25:20] especially when he's praying for the
[1:25:21] sick. But in this specific point, he
[1:25:25] stopped He literally stopped and said,
[1:25:27] "Let him." And he stopped. He paused and
[1:25:31] he said, "Oh my, maybe I'm just feeling
[1:25:34] this way, but let him," said the angel,
[1:25:37] "let him." Here is the book of
[1:25:40] redemption. Here is the plan of
[1:25:41] redemption. Here is the only way you'll
[1:25:43] ever be redeemed. For here is the title
[1:25:46] deed to redemption of the whole heavens
[1:25:48] and earth.
[1:25:50] Let him come forward if he will. Oh my.
[1:25:54] He said, "Now speak or forever hold his
[1:25:57] peace. Let him come forward and claim
[1:26:00] this book."
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Who is worthy to do it? Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe I'm just feeling this way.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What was happening,
[1:26:12] saints?
[1:26:15] There was a stirring in heaven going on
[1:26:17] during this period of time.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Just like I believe there's a stirring
[1:26:21] going on right now because we're about
[1:26:22] to go home. Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; This bride is about to get out of this
[1:26:25] place. There's a stirring going on.
[1:26:27] There was a stirring going on in heaven.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] this this Revelation five and the
[1:26:33] vindication and revelation and actually
[1:26:36] manifestation of Revelation 5 was taking
[1:26:38] place. And as and as that book was taken
[1:26:42] by our kinsman redeemer and as each seal
[1:26:45] was loosed and removed from that book of
[1:26:47] redemption, the the the the
[1:26:51] shall we say mystery contained in each
[1:26:53] one of those seals was brought to a
[1:26:56] prophet.
[1:26:58] No wonder he's standing there saying,
[1:27:00] "Oh, maybe it's just me."
[1:27:04] But let him come. I'll let you go with
[1:27:07] that for a minute, but let me read you
[1:27:09] this quote.
[1:27:11] Brother talks about many times
[1:27:15] on
[1:27:17] out here in Sabino Canyon,
[1:27:21] is there pray?
[1:27:23] He had his hands lifted up. I believe
[1:27:25] I've been there. But you know that's
[1:27:27] just just a mountain. But it's in your
[1:27:29] heart. That's what in your heart towards
[1:27:32] Christ that's what matters.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not being in Sabino Canyon or
[1:27:36] wherever else. It's your heart in
[1:27:37] Christ. That's that's what matters. But
[1:27:39] he was there. Hands up praying.
[1:27:43] And a sword come and struck his hand.
[1:27:45] Which hand? The right hand. Amen. The
[1:27:49] right hand. And I don't know if brother
[1:27:50] was brother right hand. The left hand I
[1:27:52] don't know. in his right hand though
[1:27:55] power authority to a man that actually
[1:27:57] literally has a right hand now I
[1:28:00] wondered what it meant that is the
[1:28:03] king's sword a voice spoke out and said
[1:28:05] that is the king's sword he said I
[1:28:07] wonder what that meant that is the
[1:28:09] king's sword and I thought if I would
[1:28:12] have said if if it that voice would have
[1:28:15] said a king's sword it might have been
[1:28:17] that I must would have understood it but
[1:28:20] it said the king's sword sword,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; But what is that sword? That sword's the
[1:28:26] word.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a as we read over in
[1:28:30] Revelation one, as he had the seven
[1:28:33] stars in his hand and he's in the midst
[1:28:34] of the seven golden candlesticks, what
[1:28:36] came out of his mouth?
[1:28:39] Sword.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; A sword came out of his mouth. That was
[1:28:42] Jesus Christ. The sword. Hear ye him.
[1:28:46] The sword came out of his mouth. Praise
[1:28:48] the Lord. Now, this sword that came in
[1:28:50] his hand said this was the king's sword.
[1:28:56] The king, not a king, the king. There's
[1:28:58] only one the king. There's a lot of a
[1:29:00] kings. Amen. Basketball players and uh
[1:29:04] rock and roll stars and they call a lot
[1:29:05] of people king.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; But there's only one the king.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And that is Almighty God.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; The king. Sorry. So, I may not have this
[1:29:15] right. He said, "But I thought there's
[1:29:17] only one the king. That's God. And his
[1:29:20] sword it is sharper than any two-edged
[1:29:24] sword. See, and ye abide in me. My word
[1:29:27] is in you. And I thought in a dueling.
[1:29:30] See, I don't understand one word of it.
[1:29:32] He says dueling. I don't know much about
[1:29:34] it either, but I don't understand one
[1:29:36] word of dueling or one principle of
[1:29:38] dueling, but the best my understanding
[1:29:40] the life strike, the knife striking a
[1:29:42] cross, and then finally the swords then
[1:29:44] locked together.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. which we do with the devil every
[1:29:49] day.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; This enemy and you lock swords together.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Like this. And you, Amen, you locking
[1:30:00] swords with the enemy every day.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you don't lock
[1:30:04] swords with the enemy there every day,
[1:30:06] saints, I wonder about your walk with
[1:30:07] the Lord.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:09] And I wonder about your uh your position
[1:30:12] in Christ because those that are born
[1:30:14] again and that we in Christ uh that
[1:30:17] devil is relentless.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; To every one of us.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; That sword's locked. He says together.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; He said the enemy you lock swords like
[1:30:26] this. Then it takes the strength of the
[1:30:29] man dueling
[1:30:31] because see his sword would be pointed
[1:30:34] to my heart and mine to his. Amen.
[1:30:37] locked together,
[1:30:39] but they're locked and our knives
[1:30:40] striking each other and then they strike
[1:30:42] and then the swords come together and
[1:30:45] and the one that can shut the other one
[1:30:47] down, the sword goes straight into their
[1:30:50] heart. So it takes, listen now as I
[1:30:53] close here. So it takes even though the
[1:30:57] sword being the word, the sword is the
[1:31:00] word. Even though the sword is the word,
[1:31:03] listen now.
[1:31:05] Even though the sword is the word, it
[1:31:07] takes the hand of strong faith.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; To hold it there and to bring it to the
[1:31:14] heart of the enemy.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, let's go
[1:31:20] back. I I I I don't know. I've never
[1:31:22] known of anybody in my lifetime greater
[1:31:27] of a greater or stronger faith than the
[1:31:30] prophet of God.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know of anybody. But if you go
[1:31:34] back to the scripture in Revelation 5,
[1:31:38] what was the what what was the angel
[1:31:40] that was proclaiming
[1:31:43] who is worthy? I mean uh uh the the uh
[1:31:46] the the strong angel,
[1:31:50] the strong angel that was proclaiming,
[1:31:53] Amen. who is worthy
[1:31:57] is a strong angel.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; What does it take? It takes a strong
[1:32:03] hand of faith.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; To hold that sword right there and to
[1:32:07] get it to the heart of the enemy.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that didn't just pertain to
[1:32:12] Brother Brandham. That pertains to us.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; To stay strong in faith.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; That when your swords do lock with that
[1:32:21] enemy, you have the strong faith enough
[1:32:24] to drive it to the heart of the enemy.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me, Satan. You have no
[1:32:30] right to me or my family or God's
[1:32:32] property. You have been exposed and you
[1:32:35] have no right here. You take that to the
[1:32:37] heart of the enemy.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; What is he going to do?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has to leave.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; He has to flee.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; There's nothing he can do about that.
[1:32:47] He's defeated at that point. Praise the
[1:32:50] Lord. But it takes a strong hand of
[1:32:52] faith. It takes a strong hand to drive
[1:32:55] it to the heart of the enemy. Praise the
[1:32:57] Lord. That angel was a strong angel.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It said, "Who is worthy?"
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Who is it today,
[1:33:07] saints?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It has to be us.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; It has to be the bride. I don't say us
[1:33:16] by our church. I mean by God's people.
[1:33:18] We're all a part of God's people. Yes.
[1:33:21] We're part of the family of God.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about the family of
[1:33:24] God. international, around the world,
[1:33:26] whoever they are. Amen. It takes us as
[1:33:30] God's family, praise the Lord, to to
[1:33:33] take this as strong faith and drive it
[1:33:37] to the heart of the enemy. Take that
[1:33:40] sword, take that word and drive it to
[1:33:43] the heart of the enemy.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You can't take anything hybrided. Amen.
[1:33:48] You can't take anything made up. You
[1:33:50] can't take anything manufactured by
[1:33:52] somebody in a seminary somewhere. You
[1:33:54] have to take that true, pure revelated
[1:33:57] word,
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; to take it to the heart of the enemy.
[1:34:01] Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Else you're you're dueling with a rubber
[1:34:06] sword.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might have strong faith, but
[1:34:10] when you go to drive it to the heart of
[1:34:11] the enemy, it just goes
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; just bounce off his chest because you
[1:34:16] don't have the the sword of the king,
[1:34:20] the word to take it to the heart of the
[1:34:22] enemy. Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's got to be the word.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; It's got to be strong hand of faith.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Strong hand of faith to drive it to the
[1:34:33] heart of the enemy.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Again, I I I don't know of anybody. I've
[1:34:37] never run across anybody that had
[1:34:39] stronger faith than than brother
[1:34:42] Brandham did.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And look where it look
[1:34:47] gotten us today.
