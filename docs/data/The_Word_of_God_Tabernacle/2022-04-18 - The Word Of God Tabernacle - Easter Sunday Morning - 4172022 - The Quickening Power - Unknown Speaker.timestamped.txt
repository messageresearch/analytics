[27:56] time thank you buddy
[27:57] from time to time in the mountains uh
[27:59] from the mountains
[28:01] uh but this first time she'd been here
[28:03] so amen welcome sister tina but they're
[28:06] here
[28:06] uh on not so
[28:08] a good occasion i guess you'd say they
[28:10] had to fly his her husband brother rick
[28:13] down
[28:14] helicopter from uh show low because he
[28:16] was having some heart palpitations and
[28:19] his uh
[28:20] uh heart rate had gone up like 130 and
[28:23] if he just made any movement at all his
[28:25] heart would just start fluttering and so
[28:27] they flew him down here only place they
[28:30] could find a bed for him was at
[28:31] northwest i asked him i said well they
[28:33] take you to phoenix and normally from
[28:35] the mountains they fly people to phoenix
[28:37] he said they didn't have any room in
[28:38] phoenix i had to bring him here
[28:41] so he's in northwest hospital
[28:43] he's doing better they shocked his heart
[28:45] and got it back into a rhythm but his
[28:47] top part bought a part part of his heart
[28:50] weren't working congruently that was
[28:52] working together and was causing the
[28:54] problems and
[28:55] they're supposed to do another procedure
[28:57] where they go up and cauterize part of
[28:59] the heart
[29:00] hoping to prevent this from happening in
[29:03] the future
[29:05] so please pray for brother rick if you
[29:06] would the lord would just touch him and
[29:09] amen and
[29:10] put that heart back just perfect normal
[29:13] make it to where it works just the way
[29:15] it's supposed to amen
[29:16] praise the lord so
[29:18] uh also
[29:19] i want to continue to remember the
[29:20] dougal family in prayer me and sonia

[29:24] very good funeral very efficient funeral
[29:27] um
[29:28] brother ed kept things rolling pretty

[29:33] basically the eulogy about sister joyce
[29:35] and a lot of the family member got up
[29:37] and spoke about her and
[29:39] i wish i'd had an opportunity to but it
[29:41] was i know they were trying to keep
[29:42] things a little tight but uh it was a it
[29:45] was a good time uh as far as being able
[29:48] to see some people that hadn't seen in a
[29:50] while and to
[29:52] give our greetings to the family and
[29:54] just pray that the lord would continue
[29:55] to touch brother keith sister joyce's
[29:57] husband and the family in prayer if you
[29:59] would she was quite a a
[30:02] an anchor foundation in that dugal
[30:04] family in that google home
[30:07] she meant a lot to a lot of people
[30:09] i know personally she was
[30:12] she was uh she
[30:13] to me was the epitome of a human
[30:16] in every way a wife
[30:19] a mother
[30:20] a friend a sister a mom grandmother in
[30:24] every way
[30:25] she was such a precious sister she
[30:27] always had something good to say about
[30:29] somebody she always had a smile on her
[30:31] face and i know that for me
[30:34] that one of the darkest times of my life
[30:36] she shined a ray of light to me
[30:39] she stood up for me and she spoke
[30:41] verbally
[30:42] in the opposite in the face of the
[30:44] opposition that was coming so hard
[30:46] against me brother dennis well don't ask
[30:49] him it's i don't want to dredge that
[30:50] back up but brother dennis could tell
[30:52] you
[30:52] uh and she stood there and she voiced
[30:55] her opinion of support for me when uh it
[30:57] was not a popular opinion in that group
[31:00] and
[31:01] it meant a lot to me and i will
[31:03] absolutely never forget sister joyce and
[31:05] what she did for me and she actually
[31:08] a lot of a lot of people don't want
[31:11] this said
[31:12] but she actually there right at brother
[31:14] green's passing was calling me her
[31:16] family's pastor
[31:17] i don't know that i ever actually did
[31:19] anything to warrant that title
[31:21] but um
[31:23] i
[31:24] did spend some time go to texas a couple
[31:27] things to help some of her family but
[31:28] she actually called me her family's
[31:30] pastor and uh although i'm not sure i
[31:36] deserved that title necessarily i was
[31:38] honored that she uh would actually call
[31:41] me that meant a lot to me and she'll be
[31:43] greatly missed she was a precious sister
[31:46] she defied death many times
[31:48] she's been in the hospital time after
[31:50] time congenital heart failure and
[31:51] congestive heart failure and heart
[31:53] failure of the heart failure and
[31:55] uh
[31:56] just one thing after another i've
[31:57] visioned her hospital several times and
[32:01] it just seemed like she just kept
[32:03] defying death but it was her time
[32:06] so the lord took her home and she will
[32:08] be greatly missed but again remember the
[32:09] family in prayer also
[32:12] met
[32:13] jenny her daughter
[32:15] uh from texas that i had gone a couple
[32:17] of times to try to help her son austin
[32:19] uh kind of getting off the rails and
[32:22] um
[32:23] tried to help him and i told her that we
[32:25] would continue to keep austin and
[32:27] prairie still in prison
[32:29] so please remember austin is his name if
[32:31] you remember him also as you know here
[32:34] we mentioned uh michael dougal which was
[32:38] her grand joyce and keith's grandson
[32:41] their son
[32:42] him and kristen
[32:44] their son 24 year old had gotten run
[32:46] over over here off aina
[32:49] by some lady trying to steal her car
[32:51] he jumped on the hood and she shook him
[32:53] off and ran over him twice
[32:55] killed him
[32:56] and the family the whole family is still
[32:59] hurting
[33:00] very much over that the little girls
[33:04] they were tormented by demons they had
[33:07] catholic
[33:09] come in to try to exercise it nothing
[33:11] helped and so sister joyce
[33:14] asked me
[33:15] so i got acquainted with michael that's
[33:16] when i first got acquainted with michael
[33:18] and she asked me and so i went over and
[33:22] spent some time with them and talked to
[33:24] them and uh me and my wife stood we
[33:26] stood hand in hand and we rebuked those
[33:28] demonic spirits and they've never had a
[33:30] problem since
[33:31] uh but now the girls
[33:34] are
[33:34] are
[33:36] fearful again
[33:38] not that the demons are back but they're
[33:39] fearful because uh actually one of the
[33:42] daughters told uh her mother it seems
[33:45] like everybody around us is dying
[33:47] so they haven't even told joy they
[33:49] haven't even told her that their
[33:50] grandmother's great-grandmother's past
[33:52] they haven't even told the girls that
[33:54] sister joyce has passed away yet
[33:56] um
[33:57] so i hope they're not watching this
[34:00] but
[34:01] they haven't even told him because they
[34:02] were just
[34:04] the trauma of what had been going on
[34:08] recently i told them michael and kristen
[34:11] that we would continue to remember them
[34:13] in prayer as well so please hold them up
[34:15] in prayer if you would uh also
[34:18] amen so
[34:19] uh remember of course continue remember
[34:22] the situation in ukraine russia
[34:24] and all around the world god's pride
[34:26] internationally amen we're needy people

[34:31] request in your heart the lord knows our
[34:34] hearts today let's stand to our feet if

[56:40] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[56:42] pray amen amen
[56:45] matthew chapter 28 we'll begin reading
[56:47] with verse one in the end of the in the
[56:50] end of the sabbath as it began to draw
[56:52] dawn toward the first of the week
[56:55] came mary magdalene and the other mary
[56:57] to see the sepulcher
[56:59] behold there was a great earthquake
[57:01] where the angel of the lord descended
[57:03] from heaven and came and rolled back the
[57:05] stone from the door and sat upon it
[57:08] his countenance was as lightning in his
[57:10] raiment white as snow for fear of him
[57:13] the keepers did shake and became as dead
[57:15] men
[57:16] the angel answered and said unto the
[57:19] woman
[57:20] unto the women
[57:22] fear not ye for i know that ye seek
[57:26] jesus which was crucified he is not here
[57:30] for he is risen
[57:32] as he said come see the place where the
[57:35] lord lay and go quickly and tell his
[57:37] disciples that he is risen from the dead
[57:42] and behold he goeth before you into
[57:44] galilee there shall ye see him though i
[57:46] have told you you could be seated if you
[57:49] like
[57:52] praise the lord he is risen
[57:56] amen we count it as i guess something
[57:59] that's a
[58:00] normal thought in our christian religion
[58:03] that jesus christ is risen from the dead
[58:06] and maybe sometimes even take for
[58:09] granted that but it again if you if you
[58:12] go back and and you you really reflect
[58:15] on the world and the world standards and
[58:18] what the world's doing and all the world
[58:20] religions and all how the world
[58:22] religions are are pushing that religion
[58:25] forward to try to squeeze christ and the
[58:28] true god out that we recognize that
[58:33] none of their leaders none of their
[58:35] saviors none of their lords none of
[58:38] their uh books of their men none of
[58:41] their uh uh
[58:44] people that they follow
[58:46] are risen from the dead
[58:48] every one of them are still dead laying
[58:51] in a grave
[58:52] every one of them are
[58:54] are
[58:55] no longer to be heard from yes but ours
[58:58] is amen ours is risen yes ours is here
[59:03] ours is now present
[59:06] ours is the all-powerful almighty
[59:09] all-knowing god
[59:11] and he's here he's risen we can't take
[59:13] for granted the fact that he's risen
[59:16] because none of them have right none of
[59:19] the others have risen
[59:20] he's alive all the others are dead
[59:23] praise the lord now i want to read in
[59:27] congruent to this ephesians chapter 2.
[59:33] i want ephesians chapter 2 to go along
[59:34] with this
[59:36] we'll begin here with the first verse as
[59:38] well
[59:40] amen
[59:42] praise the lord ephesians chapter 2
[59:45] verse 1.
[59:48] let's look at this now because this is
[59:50] this is uh this is the most important
[59:52] part
[59:53] amen it was important that jesus was
[59:56] risen but to me personally this is
[59:59] important to me
[1:00:00] personally amen now if he hadn't rose
[1:00:03] this couldn't exist
[1:00:05] amen so we understand him rising from
[1:00:07] the grave was what was paramount to
[1:00:10] bring this to pass but if this doesn't
[1:00:13] happen in us then all of it's in vain
[1:00:16] for us
[1:00:17] personally amen you and you
[1:00:20] who were dead in trespasses and sins now
[1:00:23] you notice here
[1:00:25] the italicized words are added to they
[1:00:28] meant to make a flow of it
[1:00:30] but it's easy to understand why they
[1:00:32] would have added this because it says
[1:00:35] and you who were dead and trespasses in
[1:00:37] sins were the word here is were amen
[1:00:43] you were
[1:00:44] dead in trespasses and sins
[1:00:47] so that means if you were
[1:00:49] dead in trespasses and sins he has
[1:00:52] quickened you
[1:00:54] because when he quickened you he made
[1:00:56] you alive
[1:00:58] and that's what i want to talk about
[1:00:59] today is that quickening power
[1:01:02] the quickening power you've heard the
[1:01:04] easter seal or it is the rising of the
[1:01:06] sun brother venom there's that's the
[1:01:08] major theme behind those messages is
[1:01:11] that quickening power and it's a
[1:01:13] powerful message friend when you really
[1:01:15] delve into it and think about it i
[1:01:17] probably won't spend as much time on it
[1:01:18] this morning that it that it uh deserves
[1:01:21] but i do want it's the thought that came
[1:01:24] on my heart to bring to us today so i
[1:01:25] want to talk about that quickening power
[1:01:28] and as i was listening and refreshing my
[1:01:30] self again with it is the rising of the
[1:01:32] sun this week uh that life came to me
[1:01:36] because
[1:01:36] when when the lord helped me to bring
[1:01:38] this out it was
[1:01:40] he was showing me something as he always
[1:01:42] does and i always i take it personally
[1:01:45] that when he shows me that that it's my
[1:01:48] responsibility my duty to do my part to
[1:01:52] as he would as yielding to his spirit to
[1:01:55] reflect that to you
[1:01:57] to bring that to you so you see and you
[1:02:00] feel and you be a part of what the lord
[1:02:02] had dealt with me on and that quickening
[1:02:05] power that segue to that is life
[1:02:09] life because that's what the quickening
[1:02:11] power is the quickening power is to make
[1:02:14] alive
[1:02:15] or to produce life
[1:02:18] now who else could produce life
[1:02:20] you've heard brother branham say they
[1:02:23] can say they can do this and they can do
[1:02:24] that and their gods and they can create
[1:02:26] this and that he said well i'll tell you
[1:02:28] what then go and make me a blade of
[1:02:29] grass
[1:02:32] you can't do it right oh they can have
[1:02:34] cures for this and they come up with
[1:02:36] medicine they can have bombs to
[1:02:38] kill a million people
[1:02:39] they can uh have inventions and fly to
[1:02:43] the moon and have rockets and and
[1:02:45] jet propulsion they can do all these
[1:02:47] wonderful things
[1:02:49] back in the andaluvian world can build
[1:02:51] those pyramids so perfectly you could
[1:02:53] run a razor blade between the between
[1:02:55] the stones
[1:02:57] but go have them build a blade of grass
[1:02:59] they can't do it
[1:03:00] because it takes life
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] and they're not producers of life right
[1:03:06] brother braham said satan can produce
[1:03:08] any kind of gift but he cannot bring
[1:03:10] that word word by word why because that
[1:03:13] word is life
[1:03:14] amen truth behind that word 100 truth
[1:03:19] behind that word brings life because it
[1:03:22] is life amen
[1:03:24] that word
[1:03:26] brings life
[1:03:27] by the spirit to those who read it
[1:03:30] to those who uh
[1:03:32] ingest it it becomes life to them and
[1:03:35] that quickening power is that life the
[1:03:38] holy spirit that god brings upon each
[1:03:41] one of us is that
[1:03:42] life amen look let's continue to read
[1:03:46] and you
[1:03:47] i'll read it the way it's had here now
[1:03:49] you have to quicken
[1:03:51] who were i loved that
[1:03:53] you were
[1:03:54] dead in trespasses and sins trusting
[1:03:57] that today you're here this morning you
[1:03:59] are no longer dead
[1:04:02] in
[1:04:03] sin
[1:04:04] praise the lord notice and we'll get to
[1:04:06] this in a minute notice
[1:04:07] dead
[1:04:08] in sin you are no longer dead in sin
[1:04:13] you were
[1:04:14] but now you've been made alive amen
[1:04:17] god has produced life to you
[1:04:21] god has produced and made you alive and
[1:04:25] that's not just alive as far as our
[1:04:27] human being because we were all alive as
[1:04:29] humans when this spirit came and brought
[1:04:32] life to us we were all human life
[1:04:35] but it's that eternal life
[1:04:38] actually if you go and you look back in
[1:04:40] john one and
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:42] uh three or four i forget which it is
[1:04:45] when it says that he was that light he
[1:04:47] was that life
[1:04:49] and that light was the light
[1:04:52] that life excuse me was the light of men
[1:04:55] that life that life there is zoe's eoe
[1:04:59] that
[1:05:00] that is the life of god brother adam
[1:05:02] told us that's the literal life of god
[1:05:05] the literal life of jesus christ zoe
[1:05:08] living in you
[1:05:09] that's that same life it's his life
[1:05:12] zoe that same prefix of of of greek now
[1:05:17] is the same prefix used in the word
[1:05:19] quicken
[1:05:20] if you go look up quicken you'll see zoe
[1:05:23] and this word have the same prefix it's
[1:05:25] uh uh dzo i don't even know what that is
[1:05:28] but it's it's dzo it's the same prefix
[1:05:32] so that quickening power is what brings
[1:05:35] by that spirit what is what brings that
[1:05:38] zoe life into you and makes you alive
[1:05:41] so you're no longer dead
[1:05:43] that's why the grave can't hold you
[1:05:45] that's why death can't hold you because
[1:05:47] you got life
[1:05:49] you've got his life you've got eternal
[1:05:52] life you've got a life that satan can't
[1:05:54] snuff out
[1:05:56] praise the lord
[1:05:57] satan can't kill you no more than he can
[1:06:00] kill god
[1:06:03] praise the lord because you've been made
[1:06:05] a lot amen
[1:06:06] you've been brought to life that
[1:06:08] quickening power
[1:06:09] praise the lord
[1:06:11] wherein look at this now
[1:06:14] he's still talking about the past
[1:06:16] wherein in time past
[1:06:19] ye walked past tents
[1:06:22] according to the course of this world
[1:06:25] according to the prince of the power of
[1:06:27] the air
[1:06:28] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:06:30] children of disobedience
[1:06:32] that was all of our lives
[1:06:34] we all lived that unless you're like
[1:06:37] gabriel and alice joel and emma that's
[1:06:39] the way we were that was our lives we
[1:06:42] walked
[1:06:43] according to the course of this world
[1:06:45] in obedience
[1:06:49] in death
[1:06:50] we walked in death
[1:06:52] our bodies were alive but we were
[1:06:53] walking in death
[1:06:56] in time past
[1:06:58] among whom also we all had our
[1:07:01] conversation when in times past
[1:07:04] again
[1:07:05] times past
[1:07:08] in the lust of our flesh
[1:07:10] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:07:14] of the mind which is just absolutely
[1:07:16] engulfing the world today that's what
[1:07:18] it's all about amen i heard some
[1:07:21] commentary that was uh somebody going
[1:07:23] out on the street and was asking random
[1:07:26] people what do you what is easter
[1:07:29] not what does easter mean to you just
[1:07:31] what is easter just a simple question
[1:07:33] what is easter oh my goodness you hear
[1:07:35] the question uh the the answers that was
[1:07:37] given to a simple question what is
[1:07:39] easter i asked anybody here this morning
[1:07:41] if i ask you what is easter i'm sure
[1:07:43] every one of you would give a very
[1:07:45] appropriate answer
[1:07:47] i couldn't believe the stuff that some
[1:07:48] people said some people had absolutely
[1:07:51] no idea
[1:07:52] they had no idea and we had joel's uh
[1:07:55] birthday party yesterday at peter piper
[1:07:57] and i look around all the people and i
[1:07:58] thought well no wonder they don't know
[1:08:00] i look at the the degradation that the
[1:08:02] way people are but one person
[1:08:05] one person said i don't believe in god i
[1:08:07] don't believe in the devil i'm my own
[1:08:09] god
[1:08:10] and that's the way it is that's where a
[1:08:12] lot of people believe today they believe
[1:08:14] fulfilling the lusts of their own flesh
[1:08:17] they are their own god
[1:08:18] and actually they're probably right
[1:08:21] so many people have become so
[1:08:23] self-centered and self-absorbed sort of
[1:08:26] like going back to last week's message
[1:08:28] that they probably are worshippers of
[1:08:30] their own selves
[1:08:32] and that's what that's what a god is and
[1:08:34] object to worship they probably are
[1:08:36] worshipers of their own selves
[1:08:39] that's probably exactly what they do
[1:08:40] fulfilling the lust of the flesh
[1:08:43] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[1:08:47] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:08:50] children of wrath even as others we were
[1:08:52] our very nature commanded us to lie
[1:08:54] still cheat our very nature that we were
[1:08:57] born when sin born in sin shaken
[1:08:59] iniquity come the world speaking lives
[1:09:00] we were by our nature
[1:09:02] amen that nature that we were born with
[1:09:04] commanded that we lived that way it
[1:09:06] dictated it it it actually uh
[1:09:10] to fulfill that desire
[1:09:12] the only way to do it is to do the
[1:09:14] things of the world and to fulfill the
[1:09:16] lust of the flesh that was the only way
[1:09:18] to fulfill it and that's exactly what we
[1:09:21] did
[1:09:21] that's what the rest of the world still
[1:09:23] does but it was our nature and you go
[1:09:26] back to first john
[1:09:28] first john 3
[1:09:30] 9 i believe it is
[1:09:31] john talks about that that seed that
[1:09:34] comes in you
[1:09:35] and that if the seed of god is in you
[1:09:37] that seed can no longer sin
[1:09:40] but look at the flesh the flesh is still
[1:09:42] dead too sin
[1:09:43] amen but the spirit of god is still
[1:09:46] alive amen in our hearts the the spirit
[1:09:49] of god that has come we and changed our
[1:09:52] nature
[1:09:54] that spirit literally changed our nature
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:58] and brother branham said that the soul
[1:10:00] is the nature of the spirit yes
[1:10:02] but god who is rich in mercy praise the
[1:10:05] lord amen for his great love wherein he
[1:10:09] loved us
[1:10:10] even when we were dead
[1:10:13] were again were
[1:10:15] dead in sins
[1:10:17] hath quickened us together with christ
[1:10:20] by grace are you saved now look at this
[1:10:23] look at how uh paul is phrasing this
[1:10:27] because it goes back to the first verse
[1:10:30] and even the second verse
[1:10:32] where we were
[1:10:33] even when we were dead were dead in sins
[1:10:39] that means that we were
[1:10:41] sinners
[1:10:43] and because of that we were dead
[1:10:46] we had no life
[1:10:48] we had human life but that was it
[1:10:50] the life that was in us was was a life
[1:10:52] of death
[1:10:54] sounds contrary but that's exactly what
[1:10:55] it is it's a life of death
[1:10:58] that spirit of the enemy has life it it
[1:11:02] it moves his principalities powers of
[1:11:04] the earth we know that it has influence
[1:11:06] and has great influence over the world
[1:11:08] today but it has no influence on a child
[1:11:10] of god
[1:11:12] because that spirit is of death
[1:11:15] and the spirit that's in me is life amen
[1:11:18] that life is the life that god gave yes
[1:11:21] that life because he lives is the life
[1:11:23] that he give to us that we can live yes
[1:11:27] we were dead but now we're alive
[1:11:30] but what were we dead in we were dead in
[1:11:33] sins
[1:11:35] our sins
[1:11:37] our trespasses
[1:11:39] are missing of the mark
[1:11:41] not not not the little things that that
[1:11:44] we do in the flesh or mistakes we make
[1:11:47] and things like no no no it was the very
[1:11:50] nature that you lived by the very nature
[1:11:53] that you were born with is what
[1:11:55] commanded this sin that's where the
[1:11:57] death was
[1:12:00] because that's the center of every human
[1:12:02] it's the soul
[1:12:03] the soul is the center of the man
[1:12:06] and if the soul is blocking then the man
[1:12:08] is blocking
[1:12:09] because it's the nature of the spirit
[1:12:11] the spirit's the nature of the body and
[1:12:13] if the soul is blocked and the body is
[1:12:15] black
[1:12:17] but when life comes
[1:12:19] in the soul
[1:12:21] then it creates life in the spirit amen
[1:12:24] the human spirit not the holy spirit our
[1:12:26] human spirit which creates life in our
[1:12:29] human bodies
[1:12:31] amen makes it alive now
[1:12:34] that's why our human bodies are quick
[1:12:36] and even
[1:12:38] that's why god even if this body goes by
[1:12:40] the grave that spirit will come and pick
[1:12:43] this body back up again i don't care
[1:12:44] where it is in the world i don't care if
[1:12:47] an ash has been dropped in every body of
[1:12:49] water on this planet when god's voice
[1:12:52] cries out every single one of those
[1:12:54] elements will come back together and
[1:12:56] produce me again
[1:12:58] or you
[1:12:59] or whoever
[1:13:01] because it's life
[1:13:03] right it's life it's not death anymore
[1:13:06] it's life
[1:13:08] we were dead in sins
[1:13:11] our sins because the death
[1:13:14] because of death made us
[1:13:17] made us in sin put us in sin
[1:13:20] but now being born again we're not dead
[1:13:23] in sin
[1:13:24] but we're dead to sin yes
[1:13:27] praise the lord amen sin has no more
[1:13:30] home on me why because i'm dead to it
[1:13:34] it has no more grip on my life because
[1:13:36] i'm dead to sin once i was dead in sin
[1:13:40] now i'm dead to sin everybody because
[1:13:43] sin has no more grip on me because why
[1:13:47] because he had quickened us together
[1:13:53] amen talk about equipment power saints
[1:13:56] made us a lot
[1:13:59] brought us together give us life
[1:14:01] together with christ
[1:14:04] with christ
[1:14:06] by grace are you saved and hath raised
[1:14:09] us up together
[1:14:11] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:14:14] places
[1:14:15] in christ jesus
[1:14:19] how did that happen
[1:14:21] because he quickened you
[1:14:23] none of that could happen if he hadn't
[1:14:24] quickened you if god had made you alive
[1:14:27] there's no way you could be with christ
[1:14:28] there's no way you could be raised up in
[1:14:30] heavenly places with him there's no way
[1:14:32] we could be like him there's no way that
[1:14:34] he could have a part of us
[1:14:37] because we were dead
[1:14:39] but because of the quickening power
[1:14:42] it come into your life and made you a
[1:14:44] new creature
[1:14:46] it brought you out of that life of sin
[1:14:48] and degradation and you because so now
[1:14:51] you were
[1:14:53] amen amen
[1:14:56] you used to be
[1:14:57] that old man is dead
[1:14:59] now notice let's go look at uh look at
[1:15:02] something saint matthew again
[1:15:06] again i know you're hot but
[1:15:09] look at it this way i'm hotter than you
[1:15:13] appreciate it
[1:15:16] praise the lord
[1:15:18] i thought i thought we don't i don't
[1:15:20] even think we have do we even have a fan
[1:15:21] i don't even think we have a favorite
[1:15:24] we got heaters but we don't have fans
[1:15:27] yeah brother crack a door in the whole
[1:15:28] world that's all right let the whole
[1:15:30] world hears matthew chapter 13
[1:15:34] praise the lord now remember
[1:15:37] zoe that uh holy spirit life zoe is the
[1:15:39] literal life of god
[1:15:42] the literal life of god
[1:15:44] you know i see different ones fanning
[1:15:45] and i uh her message is brother brown
[1:15:47] before they got air conditioning in the
[1:15:49] tabernacle
[1:15:53] in jeffersonville indiana with no air
[1:15:57] uh the humidity
[1:15:59] sweating
[1:16:00] i i think we've still got it good but
[1:16:03] amen we'll not we'll still get the air
[1:16:05] fixed
[1:16:08] matthew chapter 13. let's start with
[1:16:11] verse one
[1:16:12] let's look at this this life
[1:16:14] it's life we're talking about life
[1:16:16] that's the quickening power is that life
[1:16:18] you go back and listen to that uh
[1:16:21] the the rising of the sun you hear well
[1:16:23] brother branham he just nails on that
[1:16:25] life that life
[1:16:27] because he
[1:16:28] recognized this
[1:16:29] when he died at calvary we talk about
[1:16:32] the blood and the shedding of the blood
[1:16:33] and the blood and that is true
[1:16:35] but it was the life that was in the
[1:16:38] blood
[1:16:39] is what came back on the worshipper the
[1:16:41] chemistry of the blood fell into the
[1:16:43] earth
[1:16:44] now it was the purpose of that because
[1:16:46] that chemistry redeemed this ball of
[1:16:48] dirt we live on back to him
[1:16:50] but it was the life that was in the
[1:16:52] blood
[1:16:53] that blood cell was broken at calvary
[1:16:57] with the crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:16:59] then and when that blood cell was broken
[1:17:02] it released the literal life of god
[1:17:05] almighty himself amen
[1:17:08] and that life come back on the worshiper
[1:17:11] at the day of pentecost yes
[1:17:14] and on down because that was just a
[1:17:16] promise to them now now that promise has
[1:17:18] been to them whosoever will believe i
[1:17:20] believe how about you well then it's to
[1:17:22] you
[1:17:24] praise the lord when that blood cell was
[1:17:26] broke that life was released that light
[1:17:29] now comes and lives in you yes
[1:17:31] praise the lord
[1:17:33] now that can be raised up in heavenly
[1:17:35] places in christ jesus
[1:17:37] matthew 13 1
[1:17:39] the same day went jesus out of the house
[1:17:41] and set by the seaside great multitudes
[1:17:44] were gathered together unto him so that
[1:17:46] he went into his ship and sat and the
[1:17:48] whole multitude stood on the shore
[1:17:51] he spake many things unto them in
[1:17:53] parables saying
[1:17:54] behold a sore went forth to sow now look
[1:17:57] i'm going to read through this follow it
[1:17:59] if you will with me
[1:18:02] and he sowed some seeds fell by the
[1:18:04] wayside and the vows came and devoured
[1:18:07] them out
[1:18:08] some fell upon stoning places where they
[1:18:10] had not much earth forthwith they sprang
[1:18:12] up because they had no deepness of earth
[1:18:15] and when the sun was up they they were
[1:18:18] scorched and because they had no root
[1:18:20] they withered away
[1:18:23] some fell among thorns and the thorns
[1:18:25] sprung up and choked them but other fell
[1:18:27] into good ground brought forth fruit
[1:18:30] some a hundred some sixty some thirty
[1:18:32] fold who had ears to hear let him hear
[1:18:35] now look at the progression that jesus
[1:18:37] is giving them in the parable he's
[1:18:40] telling them first of all a sower went
[1:18:42] forth to sow now what's a seed the seed
[1:18:45] is life
[1:18:47] god
[1:18:48] made
[1:18:49] every seed to have the life that it
[1:18:51] needed to reproduce within itself
[1:18:54] every seed whether it's botany life
[1:18:57] animal life or human life
[1:18:59] every seed that was needed for
[1:19:01] reproduction was placed inside each
[1:19:05] vessel with life contained in it
[1:19:08] so every seed so if you see a seed it
[1:19:10] comes out it has that life in it if that
[1:19:14] life can get to a specific place and the
[1:19:17] right conditions and atmosphere and all
[1:19:19] can
[1:19:20] can be met
[1:19:21] then that seed will bring life
[1:19:24] it'll reproduce itself yeah but now
[1:19:27] these seed is the su
[1:19:29] the seed is the word we know the seed is
[1:19:31] the word amen so as this sower went
[1:19:34] forth to sow seed some went by the
[1:19:37] wayside and the fowls came and ate them
[1:19:39] up right so it was just food to the
[1:19:42] fouls that's all it was it never
[1:19:44] germitized it never produced anything it
[1:19:48] never brought forth any kind of life it
[1:19:50] was just eaten by the birds now the
[1:19:52] second that fell in stony places
[1:19:55] say a stony heart
[1:19:58] amen our hearts should be changed to a
[1:20:00] heart of flesh but if it lands in that
[1:20:03] stony heart
[1:20:04] where it doesn't have much earth it
[1:20:06] springs forth
[1:20:08] because it still has life in it
[1:20:10] it springs forth but it doesn't produce
[1:20:13] much
[1:20:14] it doesn't it doesn't come go very far
[1:20:17] because it has no root amen
[1:20:19] um
[1:20:20] and if there's if there's no root for it
[1:20:22] to take hold as soon as the hotness of
[1:20:25] the sun came up and we could say the
[1:20:27] s-o-n not just the s-u-n
[1:20:29] amen when the word really comes and
[1:20:32] produces itself in people's lives are
[1:20:34] they going to be able to take it are
[1:20:36] they going to be able to live it are
[1:20:38] they going to be able to produce it
[1:20:40] amen
[1:20:41] because if not then it's fell into some
[1:20:44] stony ground and when the sun came up it
[1:20:46] scorched and withered it away
[1:20:48] so it had no roof so
[1:20:51] it had a it had a little germination to
[1:20:54] it it dermatized just a little bit
[1:20:56] enough to spring forth but then it
[1:20:58] withered away now the third one was
[1:21:01] it fell
[1:21:02] into ground
[1:21:04] but it fell in a place to where it was
[1:21:06] thorns and thistles and everything
[1:21:08] around it and and it and it grew up and
[1:21:10] it got bigger than all the first two
[1:21:12] before it this third one it got bigger
[1:21:15] but as it started to get to a place of
[1:21:18] maturity when it really started to get
[1:21:20] to the place that it received a
[1:21:22] revelation of the word of god and it set
[1:21:24] into true meetings with holy
[1:21:26] ghost-filled people and hearing the word
[1:21:28] of god preached in the message of the
[1:21:30] hour then the thorns and thistles began
[1:21:32] to choke it out right
[1:21:35] it began to do before it got to that
[1:21:37] place of full maturity it choked out
[1:21:41] and it went away
[1:21:43] don't we see a lot of that today saints
[1:21:45] yes amen of those that came far and they
[1:21:48] kept going and they grew up and even
[1:21:50] putting forth a shock maybe and starting
[1:21:53] to look just like the genuine wheat
[1:21:55] maybe even preaching this message but
[1:21:57] all of a sudden these thorns stuck over
[1:21:59] here and here and this is not right and
[1:22:02] and all this garbage about the message
[1:22:05] and it chokes them out
[1:22:07] and before they reach that place of full
[1:22:09] maturity it choked them out
[1:22:12] and they went away and it produced no
[1:22:14] fruit
[1:22:15] before it got to maturity
[1:22:18] remember fruit only produces fruit when
[1:22:21] it's reached a place of maturity the
[1:22:23] life is in the seed absolutely but that
[1:22:26] seed has to die and rot
[1:22:29] has to die and rot
[1:22:31] to produce what is in it
[1:22:34] and when that for when it gets to that
[1:22:35] place of maturity is when it starts
[1:22:37] bringing forth fruit
[1:22:39] which is
[1:22:40] the holy spirit
[1:22:42] amen the holy spirit the fourth one
[1:22:45] good ground
[1:22:46] and when that seed fell in good ground
[1:22:49] it reached to a place of maturity
[1:22:51] because it had life
[1:22:53] because it had life it reached a place
[1:22:55] of maturity
[1:22:57] and when it reached that place of
[1:22:58] maturity it began to produce fruit of
[1:23:00] its own
[1:23:02] some 100 fold some 60 fold some 30 fold
[1:23:06] because everybody's different
[1:23:08] not everybody's the same
[1:23:10] amen but every
[1:23:12] fruit that's produced from that seed is
[1:23:14] ordained of god
[1:23:16] and every fruit that is brought forth
[1:23:20] whether it's 30 fold 60 fold 100 fold
[1:23:23] doesn't matter every single one of them
[1:23:26] is just as important to god
[1:23:28] every one of them is just as important
[1:23:30] to god every one of them means just as
[1:23:32] much to god god has a purpose for every
[1:23:35] single one regardless if it's a
[1:23:37] million-fold or one-fold
[1:23:39] everyone has its purpose now making sure
[1:23:42] that you fulfill that purpose
[1:23:44] of the life that is in you
[1:23:46] amen because look there's still so many
[1:23:49] things out in the world today those
[1:23:51] spirits and principalities powers here
[1:23:54] that continue to try to choke down and
[1:23:56] to try to suppress and to try to keep
[1:23:58] god's children down below what their
[1:24:00] privileges really are really what they
[1:24:02] were born to do and produce satan is
[1:24:05] trying to keep you pressed down and beat
[1:24:07] down so you don't reach that place that
[1:24:09] you know who you are that's right
[1:24:11] that'll bring you to the place of
[1:24:12] maturity and that'll bring you to the
[1:24:14] full production of the fruit that god
[1:24:16] put in your life
[1:24:18] amen but you've got to die first yes
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] you've got to die first
[1:24:25] what did paul say i died daily yes even
[1:24:29] paul said my you think if anybody
[1:24:31] reached the place of maturity his time
[1:24:33] it was paul absolutely i agree with that
[1:24:35] anybody reached the place maturity at
[1:24:37] this time with probably brother branham
[1:24:39] i agree with that but every day
[1:24:42] in this flesh we have to die yes so that
[1:24:45] life that quitting power manifests
[1:24:49] itself to us
[1:24:50] praise the lord that quickening power
[1:24:53] that quickening power is what changes
[1:24:55] things friend
[1:24:56] that quickening power is what rolled
[1:24:58] that stone back that quickening power
[1:25:00] that now look
[1:25:02] understand the quickening power is not
[1:25:06] an external force
[1:25:09] you understand that the quickening power
[1:25:12] is not an external force it is an
[1:25:14] internal force
[1:25:17] that quickening power should lie in you
[1:25:20] if you're born again yes if you're
[1:25:23] filled with the holy spirit if your soul
[1:25:25] has been the permanent resident of that
[1:25:27] of of jesus christ himself that
[1:25:30] quickening powers in you
[1:25:32] it is an internal force
[1:25:34] and when that internal force began to
[1:25:37] stir
[1:25:38] and the word that was spoken began to
[1:25:40] manifest
[1:25:41] that body of christ came back to life
[1:25:44] yeah the force was already in him
[1:25:47] amen force was already in him
[1:25:49] that that quaking power was already his
[1:25:51] life it was already who he was
[1:25:54] but he laid in the grave as he went to
[1:25:56] hell to do what he had to do down there
[1:25:58] to fulfill the scripture notice
[1:26:02] i've already turned from it but
[1:26:03] when that angel told them
[1:26:06] the angel told himself he is a risen as
[1:26:10] he told you he would
[1:26:13] you notice that
[1:26:14] it's written that the angel that was
[1:26:17] there
[1:26:18] said he is risen like he said he would
[1:26:22] now the word that was spoken had to be
[1:26:26] fulfilled
[1:26:27] amen you say well why didn't jesus raise
[1:26:30] on the first day why didn't jesus raise
[1:26:33] on the second day why didn't he raise on
[1:26:35] the sabbath day
[1:26:37] because it was spoken
[1:26:40] and when he spoke it it had to be
[1:26:42] exactly like he said it would be
[1:26:45] could not be one moment earlier it could
[1:26:47] not be one day later it had to be
[1:26:49] exactly the way god spoken and when that
[1:26:52] word that had reverberated around
[1:26:54] through heaven and earth for three days
[1:26:57] finally manifested itself in the body of
[1:27:00] jesus christ
[1:27:01] and that quickening power took hold of
[1:27:03] that body and up he came from that grave
[1:27:07] praise the lord amen that same power of
[1:27:10] that word spoken that quickening power
[1:27:13] in your life is just as important to you
[1:27:15] today as it was to him then right
[1:27:18] because as he raised in that life
[1:27:22] that life that zoe life lives in you
[1:27:25] right
[1:27:26] it'll raise you yeah yes amen sure is
[1:27:28] the world now it'll raise you even more
[1:27:30] towards the world world could be a
[1:27:32] figment of our imagination
[1:27:34] amen you know brother graham said that
[1:27:35] he said i know he's real he said
[1:27:37] everything around here could be
[1:27:38] imaginary or something i could be
[1:27:39] dreaming this but he's real am i praise
[1:27:42] the lord that's just as real as anything
[1:27:44] in real can be yes praise the lord is
[1:27:46] raising him from the dead but that
[1:27:49] that
[1:27:50] seed
[1:27:53] that that was in the mind of god
[1:27:54] remember we talked about god's uh
[1:27:57] intellectual property
[1:28:00] you
[1:28:01] being god's intellectual property
[1:28:04] god thought of you
[1:28:05] attributes that seed of god
[1:28:09] that he put down in there
[1:28:11] praise the lord has to produce what it
[1:28:13] is
[1:28:14] to bring forth that life
[1:28:16] and that life is now lived through you
[1:28:20] he rose
[1:28:22] but see when he rose he walked around
[1:28:24] with his disciples a couple of days but
[1:28:27] he no longer fulfilled
[1:28:29] uh the the position of
[1:28:32] jesus and corporal body walking in the
[1:28:35] temple and doing miracles he no longer
[1:28:37] did that anymore
[1:28:39] when he young at calvary he said it is
[1:28:41] finished he no longer did that anymore
[1:28:44] he didn't do it why because he came in
[1:28:47] you to do it
[1:28:49] he came in us
[1:28:51] to do it
[1:28:52] i believe in matthew 10 that's why he
[1:28:54] sent his disciples forth going into all
[1:28:56] the world priests the gospel teaching
[1:28:58] them and healing the sick and raising
[1:29:00] the dead and doing all these things that
[1:29:02] was just a that that was just kind of
[1:29:04] like the five times of the spoken word
[1:29:06] you know brother ramsay what you've seen
[1:29:08] him temporarily my ministry is seeing
[1:29:10] the fullness of the bride right i think
[1:29:12] the same thing with jesus is sending his
[1:29:14] disciples forth and telling them to you
[1:29:17] go forth you preach the gospel you send
[1:29:20] the good news you heal the sick you
[1:29:22] raise the dead if they won't receive you
[1:29:24] knock them dirt off your shoes and just
[1:29:26] keep on going
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:29] but he sent them forth what was that it
[1:29:32] was a preview
[1:29:33] it was a preview of what was about to
[1:29:36] happen in the book of acts and jesus
[1:29:39] death and resurrection produced the book
[1:29:42] of acts through his children amen
[1:29:45] amen because that's what he sent him
[1:29:47] forth through to begin with
[1:29:50] you think well why did jesus is here why
[1:29:52] do i need to go preach he's here
[1:29:55] you know a lot of people had that that
[1:29:57] old thought about even with brother
[1:29:58] brown well he's here
[1:30:00] nobody else can pray for me i have him
[1:30:02] pray for me well that's all well and
[1:30:04] good for him but everybody anybody the
[1:30:06] holy ghost has the right to pray for you
[1:30:08] yes
[1:30:09] anybody
[1:30:10] in fact there was one time if i remember
[1:30:12] this right uh he was having a prayer
[1:30:14] line and somebody came through the
[1:30:16] prayer line and uh sister was sitting
[1:30:18] there and god spoke to her and said go
[1:30:20] pray for that sister in the prayer line
[1:30:22] he said oh no he said god
[1:30:25] no brother branham is about to pray for
[1:30:27] her
[1:30:28] the prophet of god is going to pray for
[1:30:29] her i told you to go pray for now i'm
[1:30:31] paraphrasing of course this is exactly
[1:30:33] how it happened
[1:30:35] i told you to go pray for she finally
[1:30:37] got up
[1:30:38] obedient to the lord she resisted for a
[1:30:40] little bit oh but brother branham is
[1:30:42] going to pray for her she'll be up there
[1:30:44] in no time at all and brother browner
[1:30:46] will pray for her and she'll be fine
[1:30:48] i told you to go pray for her
[1:30:51] she got up out of her seat she went over
[1:30:53] and prayed later hand prayed for that
[1:30:54] lady went and sat back down when that
[1:30:56] lady came up before brother branham she
[1:30:57] says
[1:30:58] i don't see anything wrong with you
[1:31:00] sister you're perfectly fine she said oh
[1:31:02] i see
[1:31:03] a sister back there has already prayed
[1:31:06] for you and you've been healed go on
[1:31:08] your way
[1:31:10] amen we try to put it all on brother
[1:31:12] branham saints but every one of us with
[1:31:14] that quickening power has the ability
[1:31:16] and the right and dares i say the
[1:31:18] responsibility
[1:31:20] to lay hands and to pray for one another
[1:31:23] yes yes amen amen
[1:31:25] we have that ability because that is
[1:31:27] that that spirit lies within us
[1:31:30] that authority lies within us when jesus
[1:31:33] sent them out he didn't send them out
[1:31:35] just you know because they had nothing
[1:31:37] better to do
[1:31:39] he was training them he was teaching
[1:31:41] them he was helping them to see you go
[1:31:44] do this so then when he died and rose
[1:31:47] again they produced a book of acts
[1:31:49] because of what he had showed them and
[1:31:51] what he had taught them
[1:31:53] praise the lord that's our examples
[1:31:55] today friend amen that's what god gave
[1:31:57] to us that's the reason that we're able
[1:32:00] through that quickening power to do the
[1:32:02] same thing
[1:32:03] to produce the same life
[1:32:05] amen he is that quickening power saints
[1:32:08] don't just put it on
[1:32:10] back in
[1:32:12] relig that's one of the worst things
[1:32:14] about religion and denominations that's
[1:32:16] exactly what people want to do they want
[1:32:18] to put everything back on uh uh uh two
[1:32:21] thousand years ago amen god is the god
[1:32:24] of today not of 2000 years ago

[1:32:30] he's as much alive today as he was then
[1:32:33] praise the lord he's a present god
[1:32:35] romans chapter 8 now
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:43] that life is in that seat
[1:32:45] but it takes that quickening power
[1:32:48] to draw that life out of that seat
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:53] that quickening power is what draws that
[1:32:55] life out
[1:32:57] produces it
[1:32:59] manifests it
[1:33:00] amen amen i'm trying to train myself to
[1:33:04] get to the place that i say come lord
[1:33:05] jesus
[1:33:07] because he promised me he would never
[1:33:09] leave me or forsake me
[1:33:10] well if jesus christ never leaves me
[1:33:13] he's with me 24 7 365 366 leap year
[1:33:17] then i don't need him to come i just
[1:33:19] need him to manifest himself in a real
[1:33:22] way
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:24] i'm trying to alter my verbiage maybe
[1:33:26] i'm wrong i don't know

[1:33:29] say god come and power memphis
[1:33:31] manifestation well he's already just

[1:33:40] praise the lord lord just manifest her
[1:33:42] so let us feel you let us feel that
[1:33:45] presence real
[1:33:46] let that pulsation of the holy spirit
[1:33:49] raise our faith to a place that there'll
[1:33:51] be nothing impossible to us today
[1:33:53] nothing impossible to you
[1:33:56] that's that life tap into it
[1:33:59] that quickening power romans 8
[1:34:01] let's begin with verse
[1:34:02] 10. and if christ be in you
[1:34:06] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:34:09] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:34:12] look at that now the body is dead
[1:34:14] because of sin
[1:34:16] if
[1:34:18] see this is something that people
[1:34:21] i think struggle with sometimes
[1:34:23] sometimes don't not feeling themselves
[1:34:26] to be worthy enough
[1:34:28] but
[1:34:29] paul tells the romans
[1:34:31] that if christ is in you okay
[1:34:34] that's settled
[1:34:36] you are born again
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:39] that's what he's saying you are born
[1:34:40] again you have the holy ghost
[1:34:43] not not just an anointing not just a
[1:34:45] sensation but you're literally truly in
[1:34:49] your soul
[1:34:50] reborn
[1:34:52] of the of the spirit of the life of god
[1:34:54] zoe lives in you okay that's his that's
[1:34:57] his first part christ be in you
[1:35:00] the body is dead why because of sin
[1:35:06] born in sin shaped iniquity come the
[1:35:08] world speaking lies
[1:35:10] this body doesn't receive a body change
[1:35:12] until
[1:35:13] either we go by the way of the grave or
[1:35:15] it's quickened and changed to go on a
[1:35:17] rapture right
[1:35:19] he tells us later here the 23rd verse
[1:35:22] that that is the fullness
[1:35:24] of that word or 24th verse
[1:35:27] 23
[1:35:29] to wit
[1:35:30] the redemption of our bodies
[1:35:32] that's what we're still waiting for amen
[1:35:35] our bodies have been redeemed by the
[1:35:37] blood of christ but we're waiting for
[1:35:38] that to manifest itself
[1:35:41] but now he says if christ being you the
[1:35:43] body is dead because of sin but the
[1:35:45] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:35:49] amen
[1:35:51] but if this but now look now though but
[1:35:54] if the spirit of him
[1:35:56] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[1:36:00] in you remember it's an internal force
[1:36:02] not an external force
[1:36:04] if it dwell in you
[1:36:06] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:36:09] shall also quicken or make alive
[1:36:13] your mortal body
[1:36:15] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:36:19] it'll also quicken or make a life this
[1:36:22] mortal body
[1:36:24] which is dead because of sin but it is
[1:36:27] being quickened because of the
[1:36:29] quickening power and the life of god
[1:36:31] that's come down in it
[1:36:33] it's made it a new person
[1:36:36] praise the lord that spirit of god is
[1:36:38] working through you've been born again
[1:36:40] yes
[1:36:40] amen been born again bodies did because
[1:36:43] of sin but if that same spirit that
[1:36:45] raised up jesus from the dead don't
[1:36:47] worry
[1:36:49] don't worry
[1:36:50] it'll also quicken your body your mortal
[1:36:52] body it'll also raise you up it'll also
[1:36:56] make you a new creature praise the lord
[1:36:58] just like it did him because it's that
[1:37:00] internal force that was in that was in
[1:37:02] him is in me
[1:37:04] it's that same zoe life
[1:37:07] that same quickening power
[1:37:09] it'll quicken your mortal body
[1:37:13] amen therefore brethren we are debtors
[1:37:16] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:37:18] for if you live after the flesh ye shall
[1:37:20] die but if you live after the spirit

[1:42:11] want to go pray for her

[1:42:16] but i don't want to get judged i don't
[1:42:18] want to put them in hell
[1:42:20] when they still have a breath in their
[1:42:21] body and an opportunity maybe to receive
[1:42:24] christ yes
[1:42:26] i don't know but i don't want to put
[1:42:29] them there

[1:42:52] me let's
[1:42:53] as he helped us we could try to help
[1:42:55] other people shine that light
[1:42:58] share that quickening power inside those
[1:43:01] human beings or our soul brother adam
[1:43:03] said we're 10 million worlds
[1:43:06] amen help me
[1:43:09] if there's something i can do
[1:43:11] i know we're living in a dark hour
[1:43:13] saints we're living in a lost and dying
[1:43:14] world i understand that
[1:43:16] amen but if there's one that we can help
[1:43:18] there's one that we can make a
[1:43:20] difference to somehow
[1:43:22] amen even if even if i can do something
[1:43:24] to make their life hear better
[1:43:27] because this may be all they have
[1:43:30] you know that's
[1:43:32] in isaiah that's the mark
[1:43:35] that god sent them forth that marking
[1:43:37] angel sent him forth that said mark all
[1:43:39] those that are crying and signing the
[1:43:40] abomination is done in the land
[1:43:43] now i know he was talking about israel
[1:43:44] and we're talking about the world but
[1:43:46] they're still humans
[1:43:49] it just
[1:43:50] it vexes my soul
[1:43:54] i i'm i'm gonna say something i might
[1:43:57] i don't wanna i don't want this to be
[1:43:59] taken wrong
[1:44:01] but i saw a report the other day
[1:44:04] where they had a white house event
[1:44:07] and the former president not trump but
[1:44:09] before him came
[1:44:11] and
[1:44:13] and
[1:44:14] had a speech and all this and they had a
[1:44:16] party afterwards and they were filming
[1:44:17] and they were showing everybody and
[1:44:20] and and our and our president the
[1:44:22] president the current president united
[1:44:24] states
[1:44:25] was just walking around
[1:44:28] looking for somebody to talk to
[1:44:30] looking for somebody's hand to shake
[1:44:32] looking for somebody he even goes to the
[1:44:34] other former president who he was the
[1:44:36] vice president under tapping his
[1:44:38] shoulder trying to get his attention
[1:44:39] he's ignoring him
[1:44:41] and i gotta be honest i felt literally
[1:44:44] absolutely sorry for the man
[1:44:46] my heart broke for him it really did
[1:44:49] i don't agree with his politics i don't
[1:44:51] agree with his policies
[1:44:53] 99
[1:44:55] but i felt generally sorry it kind of
[1:44:58] gave me compassion to think that's kind
[1:45:00] of the way it is in the world today
[1:45:03] they made him look like a buffoon
[1:45:06] it was i felt generally sorry for him
[1:45:08] it's very it was sad to see
[1:45:11] most powerful man is supposed to be in
[1:45:13] the world
[1:45:15] the top position
[1:45:17] in this country politically and
[1:45:19] completely ignored
[1:45:22] and and and pushed aside basically
[1:45:25] i felt so i felt generally sorry for him
[1:45:27] and it may and out and again it it
[1:45:30] helped me reflect on humanity as a whole
[1:45:33] not just him necessarily but humanity as
[1:45:36] a whole
[1:45:37] i generally feel sorry that there's
[1:45:39] people who don't know what easter is
[1:45:42] have no clue about the resurrection of
[1:45:44] jesus christ
[1:45:46] have no
[1:45:48] opportunity or or
[1:45:51] they have opportunity but they have no
[1:45:53] desire to be in a church service like
[1:45:55] this on an easter sunday morning
[1:45:59] most easter to most people is pushing
[1:46:02] colored eggs and wearing big dresses and
[1:46:04] bonnets and stuff
[1:46:08] if it's not because of the resurrection
[1:46:10] and power the literal
[1:46:13] quickening power
[1:46:15] of the life of god in us
[1:46:18] what hope do any of us have that's right
[1:46:22] amen
[1:46:23] i'll close with this i like what brother
[1:46:25] green always said
[1:46:27] he said
[1:46:29] and and

[1:46:32] similar to that i'll just tell you what

[1:46:41] and take as many people with me as i can
[1:46:46] i've said that for years
[1:46:48] try to help anyway
[1:46:49] and brother greene had a version of that
[1:46:51] too that he used to say independently i
[1:46:53] didn't know his he didn't know mine he
[1:46:55] just out there he would speak his behind
[1:46:56] the pulpit but that's my that's my
[1:46:58] heart's desire

[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:01] look at this
[1:50:02] first corinthians chapter 11
[1:50:08] for i have received of the lord that
[1:50:09] which also i delivered unto you that the
[1:50:11] lord jesus the same night and when she
[1:50:13] was betrayed took bread
[1:50:15] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:50:17] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:50:20] broken for you
[1:50:21] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:50:24] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:50:26] insuffed saying this cup is the new
[1:50:29] testament in my blood
[1:50:30] this do as often as you drink it in
[1:50:32] remembrance of me
[1:50:34] whereas often as you drink eat of that
[1:50:36] bread and drink of this cup you do show
[1:50:39] the lord's death till he come
[1:50:41] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:50:44] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:50:46] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:50:49] and blood of the lord but let a man
[1:50:52] examine himself

[1:51:14] judged or condemned but if the but when
[1:51:18] when we are judged we are chastened to
[1:51:21] the lord that we should not be condemned
[1:51:23] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:51:25] when you come together to eat carry one
[1:51:27] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:51:29] him eat at home
[1:51:31] that he may come together unto
[1:51:33] condemnation and the rest i will set in
[1:51:34] order when i come
