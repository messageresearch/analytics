[22:23] &gt;&gt; Praise you Jesus.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my saints. That's just a little bit
[22:28] of how much we think of it. That's just
[22:30] a small snippet of few adjectives we
[22:33] could throw in there to try to speak in
[22:35] our hearts what we really feel about
[22:37] him. Amen. But there's nothing compares
[22:41] with him. Amen.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. God bless you.
[22:45] Welcome to the house of the Lord today.
[22:46] There's a few still on their way. So,
[22:48] but we're going to start service and
[22:49] just enter into our worship with a with
[22:53] a little prayer. So, let's just bow our
[22:54] heads if we could now. Lord Jesus.
[22:57] Father, we're so thankful again for
[22:58] another beautiful day that you give us.
[23:00] Thank you for health and strength and
[23:01] life in our bodies, Lord, for bringing
[23:04] us to this place today of worship. We're
[23:06] so thankful for you, Lord. And we're
[23:08] thankful for your spirit in our lives.
[23:10] Thank you for leading and guiding us and
[23:12] helping us, Lord, along our journey,
[23:14] Lord. We know this journey, the time of
[23:16] this journey is running short. We know
[23:18] the world, God, is basically gone into
[23:21] chaos. It's gone into a a place, Lord,
[23:25] where there's just, as much as I hate to
[23:28] say it, there's just no return.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; But Lord, there is a return for your
[23:32] bride. Yes.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; And that is after you purify this world.
[23:35] That is after you get rid of all the
[23:36] sin, the degradation where even the
[23:38] atmospheres explode, Father, to make it
[23:41] a place fit for your holy children and a
[23:44] holy God to come and live again and rule
[23:47] and reign. Oh, what a wonderful time
[23:49] it'll be. Father, give us your grace
[23:51] once again today in this service. May
[23:54] you move in a supernatural way in our
[23:56] midst, God. For we need you desperately
[23:58] today
[23:59] &gt;&gt; to bless us, to strengthen us, to help
[24:01] us, to heal us, to comfort us, to give
[24:03] us your grace. Once again, we commit
[24:06] this service into your hands. We pray
[24:08] Lord as we rebuke every demonic spirit
[24:11] that would try to hurt, hinder, and
[24:12] infiltrate this service in any way that
[24:15] you get the glory, honor, and praise for
[24:17] all that is said and done. Take full
[24:19] control, Lord, of every one of us at
[24:21] this service that all is said and done.
[24:23] May it be to you, Lord, for a sweet
[24:25] smelling Savior. We commit it to you now
[24:27] in the precious name of our Lord and
[24:29] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

[39:40] guess office desk here um for a few
[39:45] hours Friday. So yeah, he seems to be
[39:48] doing good. He had an eye appointment.
[39:49] They put some drops in his eyes, so it
[39:51] was a little blurry, but uh the doctor
[39:53] said his eyesight was coming along. He
[39:55] was doing really well. He felt really
[39:56] good about it. Uh Sister Pat seriously

[41:12] stay at home and get some rest today. So
[41:14] please remember her in prayer. She
[41:16] wanted me to say hello to Gabriel for
[41:18] her.
[41:19] So, in case I forget, after church, uh,
[41:24] Sister Julie said hello. She you'd been
[41:26] on her heart this week. So, it really
[41:29] touched her heart when you gave her a
[41:30] hug last week. So, but please pray for
[41:33] Sister Julie. Also, I didn't hear from
[41:35] Sister Norma.
[41:37] Not sure. Maybe she's just running a
[41:38] little late. So, I did not hear from
[41:40] Steve or Anna either. Uh, this is
[41:43] usually their off week. So, please
[41:44] remember them in prayer. Did not hear
[41:47] from them. So, We're just thankful the
[41:50] Lord's here.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Glad to have Michael back to each one of
[41:54] you today. And we also want to remember
[41:57] um I failed to mention last week, so
[41:59] please forgive me, but I'm sure all of
[42:01] you already knew that brother Eddie
[42:03] Bisll, Edward Bisl, passed away a week
[42:06] before last. Uh, so I failed, excuse me,
[42:09] I'm sorry, but failed to mention it last
[42:11] Sunday, but please remember his family
[42:13] and church, all those affected by
[42:15] brother's passing. Of course, we're all
[42:17] getting to the age. Uh, you know, you
[42:19] just keep getting up there in years. And
[42:22] finally, those years uh those years take
[42:25] you and the Lord says, "Time to come
[42:27] home."
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Uh, it just signals to me though uh
[42:31] another soldier from the cross, another
[42:34] one of that generation. Uh, it kind of
[42:37] reminds me of Exodus, doesn't it?
[42:39] Another one of that generation is gone
[42:41] away now. Uh, so it's the new generation
[42:45] with Joshua that took that uh took that
[42:47] promised land. So, praise the Lord. Went
[42:49] over Jordan into the promised land. So,
[42:52] another one of that generation has
[42:53] passed on. There aren't many left. As
[42:56] far as I know, I think brother Charlie
[42:58] Cox is still alive. Uh, but I'm not sure
[43:01] there's many. I'm um talk to Brother
[43:04] Roger about that.
[43:06] I do. But, uh, they're they're going
[43:08] away, saints. And so, uh, that just
[43:12] signals something scripturally to me
[43:14] along with everything else we've been
[43:15] talking about.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Like, uh, me and Dennis were talking,
[43:20] uh, we had lunch Thursday, uh, about I
[43:23] had mentioned to you about the turning
[43:25] point and, uh,
[43:28] Charlie Kirk had 3,200
[43:31] uh, chapters of turning point in the
[43:34] country. I told Last week, the requests
[43:36] now have gone up to 65,000
[43:39] requests. Not 6,500, 65,000. I heard as
[43:42] of Thursday, haven't heard since we
[43:44] talked about it, it was it was over
[43:47] 150,000. The last I heard requests.
[43:51] 150,000 requests. They're expecting to
[43:54] have a chapter of that group in every
[43:57] high school and college in the country.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; It that's just you talk about again
[44:02] Matthew 25, you talk about a a move of
[44:05] that nominal that nominal church saints
[44:08] uh that that nominal virgin. We're we're
[44:10] I just I can't help that just keeps
[44:13] coming back to me over and over again.
[44:14] So uh we just keep that in mind too.
[44:17] Keep that in heart. The Lord knows.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So
[44:21] &gt;&gt; amen. But that's all I have for prayer
[44:23] requests. Anyone else have anything on
[44:24] your heart?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:30] This Thursday will have a surgery
[44:33] &gt;&gt; and Um just pray that all go well by the
[44:37] grace of God.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. October second
[44:41] remember that for his wife Leah. Anyone
[44:44] else
[44:46] have an unspoken request
[44:49] and I'll stand.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; We're going to ask brother Dennis if you
[44:54] would take these.
[44:59] Lord Jesus, it's an honor once again to
[45:03] be in your house of worship, your house
[45:06] of prayer,
[45:07] &gt;&gt; your house with your word can be
[45:10] preached without compromise with the
[45:14] revealed word coming forth that has been
[45:19] delivered through your mighty prophet,
[45:21] brother Brandham.
[45:23] The shout to get a bride ready for
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord. And Lord,
[45:29] help us to always be in the spirit. Them
[45:33] that are led by the spirit of God, they
[45:36] are the sons of God.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us to examine our hearts
[45:43] daily. For we know the enemy is fighting
[45:46] us harder than ever. The greater he
[45:48] that's in us than he that's in the
[45:51] world.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. And you also said and
[45:54] you gave us that promise, I can do all
[45:57] things through Christ who strengthens
[45:59] us.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we have to have that faith to
[46:04] totally trust you in our lives for
[46:07] everything.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; We have to have the faith to believe
[46:12] that
[46:14] you could come any day now. that there's
[46:17] a bride that is walking in the precepts
[46:21] of your word, Father, that is Lord. Yes,
[46:24] Lord.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Not ashamed of the gospel. And Lord,
[46:29] help us to love one another that much
[46:32] more.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Grant it, God. Yes.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Knowing that John says, we owe nothing
[46:37] to one another, but to love one another.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, yes. Thank you, Jesus. Even
[46:44] with the people that are needy this
[46:47] morning, if we don't have your love, our
[46:50] prayers will be like a sounding uh uh
[46:56] drum and a tingling symbol. Lord, let us
[47:00] sincerely
[47:02] love one another. Unseen love as Paul
[47:05] said.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are needs this morning,
[47:09] my brother. It's a very serious
[47:12] situation,
[47:13] Lord. They might have to amputate
[47:17] all his toes, but we know that you're
[47:20] still our healer.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Our Jehovah Rafa that can be touched by
[47:27] the feelings of our our infirmities.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; And with his stripes, we are healed. And
[47:33] we claim and believe total deliverance
[47:37] um for my brother going through this uh
[47:41] sepsis that's in his body and this um uh
[47:46] bad condition with his toes. Father, we
[47:50] believe that if anything that you'll
[47:53] guide the surgeon's hands and that all
[47:56] be done right. Amen. We believe for your
[47:59] honor and for your glory. in the past
[48:01] father that are have been dealing with a
[48:06] situation in their lives where they
[48:08] don't have the energy. Brother Pat,
[48:10] sister Pat and brother Pat dealing with
[48:14] eye problems knowing that it's gotten
[48:16] better but he still deals with blurry
[48:19] vision and our sister Pat had falling
[48:23] down and had that hip surgery recently.
[48:27] May you touch him both, Father.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. May you deliver them from
[48:31] God that condition that they're enduring
[48:34] at this time.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And Father, my wife will be having
[48:38] surgery this Thursday. Lord, she's
[48:41] nervous. Lord, may you also once again,
[48:46] as I said, guide the surgeon's hand.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, may all come
[48:52] all right and good for your honor, for
[48:55] your glory.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. And father
[48:58] are are all the other requests of the
[49:02] people that need a healing touch. I
[49:04] can't remember them all, but you know,
[49:06] Father, they've been spoken.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; They're our precious brethren. May you
[49:10] touch them and give them whatever they
[49:13] have need of at this time, Father. And
[49:17] Lord, all the unspoken prayer requests,
[49:20] Lord, touch each and every heart. May
[49:22] you grant them to them their heart's
[49:25] desire. You said in your word, "Delight
[49:29] yourself in the Lord and I'll give you
[49:31] desires of your heart."
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; May your cups runth over. May it flow um
[49:39] with no limit, Father. And bless our
[49:43] pastor. He's getting ready to do another
[49:45] job. give him strength throughout the
[49:47] week and use him once again, Father, uh
[49:51] to bring forth your word, knowing that
[49:53] faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[49:56] the word of God. It's not a time to play
[49:59] church. It's not a time to just uh be
[50:02] laxidasical
[50:04] in our walk with you. If we're not
[50:07] right, we're going to find ourselves in
[50:10] the great tribulation. Ask my heart
[50:13] daily, Father. May speak to all our
[50:16] hearts. In your precious and holy name
[50:18] we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:21] Christ.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[52:32] Calary.

[53:56] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Thank you
[54:00] God for Calvary.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. Where would
[54:04] we be without it? saints.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where would we be without?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Calvary.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; The place where he paid it all.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; The place where he took my place. The
[54:18] place that changed everything. Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; It was a place that devil thought he had
[54:23] it. It was the place where the devil
[54:25] literally thought he had Jesus.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I imagine he thought, "I've got him now.
[54:30] He's hanging up there and he can't come
[54:32] down." Oh, he could have, but he chose
[54:35] not to.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Because he had you and me on his mind.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He looked through
[54:40] history and he saw those that was to be
[54:44] purchased back to him. Amen. And though
[54:47] he could have called 12 legions of
[54:49] angels, he stayed there and he hung and
[54:52] died in shame at that precious place.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; And when he was done, he said, "It is
[54:58] finished." Praise God. Amen. Thank you,
[55:02] Lord Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. You know,
[55:06] I'm trusting and praying one of these
[55:08] glorious days.
[55:11] Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; We may be laying on a death bed.
[55:17] We might.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; But we can lay there and say, "It's
[55:22] finished."
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; I did what the Lord sent me here to do.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I run my race. I finished my
[55:29] course.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. ready to go meet him.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's stand if we
[55:37] could. 28.
[55:41] And we're going to start on the
[55:42] five-fold ministry. This will be the
[55:44] last section as far as I know right now
[55:46] will be the last section uh of this
[55:48] series, the five-fold ministry.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I saved it kind of last because so
[55:55] many times when people talk about
[55:56] adoption and position and placement in
[55:58] God, they always put those
[56:01] ministry positions up first and out
[56:04] front. And truly, ministry positions are
[56:08] out front and seen and heard more than
[56:11] anybody else. But
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; They're no more important. Amen. They
[56:15] are no more important. This five-fold
[56:17] ministry is no more important than every
[56:19] single person in their position in that
[56:22] body.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to talk about that
[56:25] place today. Amen. The five-fold
[56:27] ministry.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord if we could. So now
[56:30] Romans 8. Going to begin reading with
[56:33] verse 14. But let's just bow our heads
[56:34] for a word of prayer if we could first.
[56:36] Thank you, Lord Jesus, again for feeling
[56:39] your presence and knowing that you're
[56:40] here, Lord, that you're real, God, that
[56:42] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[56:44] forever. Lord, you're in our lives,
[56:46] leading and guiding us and helping us
[56:48] along the way, giving us strength, Lord,
[56:50] along this journey.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your blessings and
[56:53] love to us, watching over us and keeping
[56:56] us. Now, as we approach this precious
[56:58] sacred word, Lord, we pray that you
[57:01] would reveal to us what you'd have us to
[57:03] know and see in here. Lord, we may have
[57:06] read this portion of scripture many,
[57:08] many times, hundreds of times even, but
[57:11] Lord, that doesn't mean you can't reveal
[57:13] something in there to us,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Lord. Even now, God. Even after we've
[57:17] read it before every service in this in
[57:20] this uh series, Lord. Uh even now, God,
[57:24] let's just I don't want to read it just
[57:26] as words on a page, but Lord, if there's
[57:28] something in there you want us to see,
[57:30] even now, God, reveal it to us. Show to
[57:33] us in there what you'd have us to see
[57:35] and know, God.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, we just thank you, Father,
[57:37] for the word, for the revelation, the
[57:39] word, for a prophet of God, Lord, who
[57:41] would come into this world and basically
[57:43] sacrifice everything, Lord, to bring
[57:46] this message to a to a bride for this
[57:49] last day.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the grace that you
[57:52] give us every day, Father. It is
[57:54] amazing, God. We commit the remaining
[57:56] part of this service now into your hands
[57:58] and pray that your Holy Spirit would
[57:59] have its preeminence. Open my mouth to
[58:02] say those things that would be your
[58:03] will, Lord, and shut them to anything
[58:05] that you would not have me to say today.
[58:08] May you have full control of all of us
[58:10] hear and speakers alike. We commit it to
[58:14] you now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:15] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:14.
[58:20] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[58:23] God, they are the sons of God.
[58:26] For you have not received the spirit of
[58:28] bondage again to fear, but you have
[58:31] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[58:33] we cry, "Aba, Father."
[58:36] &gt;&gt; The Spirit itself beareth witness with
[58:38] our spirit that we are the children of
[58:41] God. And if children, then hes of God
[58:46] and joint hes with Christ. If so be that
[58:49] we suffer with him, that we may be also
[58:52] glorified together.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated if you'd like.
[58:59] Amen. As we uh delve into this uh
[59:02] portion of the uh adoption as we read
[59:05] that and see that that the Lord give us.
[59:10] Amen. We want to go over and turn over
[59:11] to Ephesians. Amen. And and uh get over
[59:15] Ephesians starting here of that
[59:18] five-fold ministry.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. that five-fold ministry uh that
[59:22] the Lord uh has given us in this last
[59:25] day. Amen. So, Ephesians chapter 4, just
[59:29] read a couple of verses of scripture
[59:31] here. Amen. As the Lord would would show
[59:35] it to us. I want to start with verse
[59:37] one. Ephesians 4:1.
[59:40] Amen. Amen. We'll just read down through
[59:45] just see where the Lord takes us today.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4 uh verse one. I
[59:52] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[59:54] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[59:57] vocation wherewith you are called with
[1:00:00] all loneliness and meekness with
[1:00:04] longsuffering
[1:00:05] forbearing one another forbearing one
[1:00:08] another in love.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And that's that's kind of a tough
[1:00:13] saying. Uh it's not something that most
[1:00:16] people would like to hear. Uh most
[1:00:19] people uh I would venture to say
[1:00:21] probably all of us are not in favor of
[1:00:25] being meek or lowly or longsuffering.
[1:00:30] Uh you know longsuffering means to
[1:00:32] suffer long.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Well, nobody wants to suffer at all.
[1:00:37] Must less long.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; But we must suffer long for what? Not
[1:00:42] me, but for one another.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I suffer for you. You suffer for
[1:00:48] me.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; We suffer for one another. The Lord
[1:00:50] suffered for us.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And still And still his
[1:00:54] longsuffering is beyond anything I can
[1:00:56] comprehend.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as he does, we are
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; we long suffering. Forbearing. That also
[1:01:03] means to suffer.
[1:01:05] Forbearing one another in love. That
[1:01:07] also means to suffer with one another.
[1:01:10] Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; To be suffrage if you will. endeavoring
[1:01:15] to keep the unity of the spirit in the
[1:01:17] bond of peace. You know this is the only
[1:01:19] place in the scripture where the word
[1:01:21] endeavoring is used. The only place in
[1:01:24] the Bible where endeavoring is used. To
[1:01:26] in endeavor, amen means to strive means
[1:01:31] to be diligent. It means to press
[1:01:33] forward, if you will. To to press
[1:01:36] forward. Endeavor. Amen. to delve into
[1:01:39] uh uh uh deeply to work at to endeavor.
[1:01:44] Amen. So this this is this is can I say
[1:01:48] this is a job.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; This is work.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is it work? Why why would it
[1:01:54] be work for me to endeavor to keep a
[1:01:57] unity of the spirit of peace, the bond
[1:01:59] of love?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Why would that be so endeavoring?
[1:02:02] Because that endeavoring with the spirit
[1:02:05] of God in us is contrary to everything
[1:02:07] our human nature wants to do,
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Uh we none of our humanity wants none of
[1:02:13] our carnality wants to endeavor with
[1:02:15] anybody,
[1:02:17] suffer with anybody,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Be meekness. There's there's nothing
[1:02:20] about the human spirit that wants to be
[1:02:22] meek or lowly. the the human spirit as
[1:02:25] you notice for those without the Holy
[1:02:27] Spirit uh out in the world that everyone
[1:02:30] wants to be first. Everyone wants to be
[1:02:32] the best. Everyone wants to be the most
[1:02:34] known. Everybody wants to have the most
[1:02:36] popularity. Everybody wants most have
[1:02:38] the most power, have the most money.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. People want to be out and up and
[1:02:43] front and forward. That's human nature.
[1:02:45] Human nature wants to So you overcome
[1:02:47] the human nature. You unco you overcome
[1:02:50] the carnality by by by the loneliness of
[1:02:53] the spirit in you.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; By the by the suffrage by the work by
[1:02:58] the endeavoring by the diligence that we
[1:03:01] give the work that we put into making
[1:03:04] sure that we can keep a unity of the
[1:03:06] spirit. It's work keeping the unity of
[1:03:09] the spirit. Yes.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because human nature wants to say
[1:03:12] well if they don't believe like me then
[1:03:14] I don't want to have anything to do with
[1:03:15] them. In fact, a lot it's come to the
[1:03:18] place, at least in this country today,
[1:03:21] if you don't if people don't agree with
[1:03:22] you, they're just going to kill you,
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's just just just becoming
[1:03:28] the way it is daily today.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Uh I I think there's been shooting
[1:03:33] there's been shootings every day this
[1:03:35] week.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; There's been hatred and and murders
[1:03:37] every day this week. I just heard this
[1:03:39] morning coming over here that uh some
[1:03:42] man went into I I guess it was Mormon a
[1:03:45] church a Mormon church I think it was
[1:03:46] shot up a bunch of people and set church
[1:03:48] on fire.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Uh just yesterday a guy in North
[1:03:53] Carolina from a boat shot up a
[1:03:56] restaurant. I think he maybe hurt some
[1:03:58] people killed. I don't know what
[1:03:59] happened. I haven't had time to look at
[1:04:01] all of it. Just the headlines I've seen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen off the coast of North Carolina.
[1:04:06] And we all know so many of things that's
[1:04:09] happened up to that time. The shooting
[1:04:10] in Dallas and killing a a a
[1:04:16] migrant uh that was held detained by
[1:04:18] ICE. Shot shot up the van, killed killed
[1:04:21] a guy, hurt a couple people. Amen. It
[1:04:24] just it it just got to the place that,
[1:04:26] you know, if if if you don't agree with
[1:04:29] me, uh then I I hate you. If you don't
[1:04:32] agree with me, I'm going to shoot you.
[1:04:34] I'm going to kill you. You don't deserve
[1:04:38] to live if you don't believe the way I
[1:04:40] do.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; That's where humanity's gotten to
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; in a lot of ways. Now, not everybody.
[1:04:45] It's I would say it's more or less a
[1:04:47] fringe uh part of humanity, but it's
[1:04:50] still gotten that place. You said,
[1:04:51] "Well, that sounds awful bleak." Well,
[1:04:53] that's why the Bible tells us to
[1:04:55] endeavor
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; to keep unity of the spirit. Endeavor
[1:04:59] work to work to keep the unity of the
[1:05:02] spirit. So many times it seems like
[1:05:04] we're we're so divided. Now, not each
[1:05:06] church. A lot of times, uh, we're pretty
[1:05:09] united in our little group here and
[1:05:12] maybe Tucson Tabernacles, they're
[1:05:13] probably fairly united in their group
[1:05:15] over there and Brother Rogers probably,
[1:05:17] you know, and Brother Doug and different
[1:05:18] churches just around in this city are
[1:05:20] probably fairly united within
[1:05:22] themselves. But how about the uniting of
[1:05:24] all of us together?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; How about the uniting of that brother
[1:05:27] with that brother or that sister with
[1:05:29] that sister, that pastor with that
[1:05:30] pastor, that church with that church?
[1:05:32] You hardly see that.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And it's getting to the place that it's
[1:05:35] not just here.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; It's getting more so to the place that
[1:05:38] it's in infecting
[1:05:42] uh the country. But see, that's the
[1:05:43] devil. That's the spirit of the enemy
[1:05:45] that tries to get in there. That's why
[1:05:47] it's work to keep unity.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to strive at it. You
[1:05:51] have to endeavor for it because the
[1:05:54] devil wants to do everything but keep
[1:05:56] you united in the spirit.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And how do we keep you united in the
[1:06:00] spirit? in the bond of love.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Above all things, above anything else,
[1:06:06] above any divisions, above any
[1:06:08] disagreements, above anything that I
[1:06:10] might not like about you or you might
[1:06:13] not like about me, I love you.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Above anything else, I love you. Amen.
[1:06:19] And I can say that to anybody. Now, it
[1:06:22] might not be uh, you know, the kind of
[1:06:24] love I have for my wife, for example,
[1:06:26] but I love everybody. there. There's
[1:06:29] nobody that I want to see go to hell.
[1:06:31] There's nobody I want to see bad things
[1:06:33] happen to.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; There's nobody I I love every I love
[1:06:37] every human. I want to try to do
[1:06:39] anything I can to help any human that I
[1:06:41] can. Amen. Now, sometimes love's
[1:06:44] corrective. A lot of times, especially,
[1:06:46] love is corrective and it's it's not the
[1:06:49] the affectionate kind of love that a lot
[1:06:52] of people misconstrue love for. Most
[1:06:55] people just think that love is just the
[1:06:56] affectionate, but it's corrective. But
[1:06:59] that that doesn't mean I don't love
[1:07:00] them.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And that's of course a lot of people are
[1:07:03] blinded to that. But we we work to keep
[1:07:06] the to keep endeavoring. We endeavor to
[1:07:09] keep a unity of the spirit. Amen. And
[1:07:12] the bond of peace above everything,
[1:07:14] friends. Above everything, I love you.
[1:07:17] Period. No matter what I disagree with
[1:07:20] or whatever, I love you. Amen. And
[1:07:23] that's the way it should be in the body,
[1:07:26] especially in the body of Christ. It
[1:07:29] should be that way.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is one body.
[1:07:33] Fourth verse. Now, there is one body and
[1:07:37] one capital S spirit. Amen. That's his
[1:07:40] spirit. That's God's spirit. Not a third
[1:07:42] person in the trinity, but God's spirit.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; One spirit. Even as you are called and
[1:07:50] one hope of your calling. Now he's
[1:07:52] talking about being called three times.
[1:07:56] He talked about
[1:07:58] make sure that you walk worthy of your
[1:08:00] vocation. Amen. Which is your choosing,
[1:08:03] your picking. God's handpicked you.
[1:08:06] Vocation calling wherewith you are
[1:08:08] called. Amen. As God has called you. Now
[1:08:10] he says in one body, one spirit. Even as
[1:08:13] you're called, that calling is what? To
[1:08:16] the body. There's that one body and one
[1:08:19] spirit. And our calling is for that one
[1:08:21] body. Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; In that one spirit unto the Lord. The
[1:08:24] Lord calls us in that spirit and one
[1:08:27] hope of our calling that we are called
[1:08:29] in that we are supposed to walk worthy
[1:08:31] in that we are supposed to fulfill. That
[1:08:34] when it comes our time, we can say the
[1:08:36] exact same thing that Jesus did. It is
[1:08:38] finished. Amen. He had a work to do.
[1:08:41] Correct? He did what he was supposed to
[1:08:44] do. And when he did what he was supposed
[1:08:46] to do, he hung there and said, "It is
[1:08:48] finished." Praise the Lord. His finish
[1:08:50] is a lot greater than my finish because
[1:08:52] he purchased all of humanity with his
[1:08:54] blood. But we all have that part to play
[1:08:57] to say it is finished.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The place where we get
[1:09:02] when we get on the other side, he says,
[1:09:03] "Well done, my good and faithful
[1:09:06] servant, entering into the joys of the
[1:09:08] Lord." Well done. It's finished.
[1:09:12] Paul said, "I shun not to declare unto
[1:09:16] you the whole council of God." Now, what
[1:09:20] does that mean? That doesn't mean Paul
[1:09:22] preached every single segment of the
[1:09:23] scripture. But what it does mean is
[1:09:25] everything that God gave him to bring,
[1:09:28] everything that God had him to do,
[1:09:30] everything that he was to fulfill in a
[1:09:33] as a prisoner of Christ, he did.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's what that means. That's what in
[1:09:38] in all of our lives is what that is what
[1:09:40] that is to mean to us that we fulfill
[1:09:43] that we say then we can say it is
[1:09:45] finished.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; That was in one hope of our calling of
[1:09:49] your calling of your adoption of your
[1:09:52] placement of your position.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Fifth verse now one Lord.
[1:10:00] Amen. That is indisputable although a
[1:10:02] lot of people will
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; uh even though the Bible you know the
[1:10:06] Bible in several places refers to God as
[1:10:09] Lord and Jesus as Lord.
[1:10:13] Well, if there's only one Lord, then how
[1:10:15] can God and L and Jesus both be Lord?
[1:10:21] Because they're one. That's the only
[1:10:23] way. That's why the scripture says
[1:10:25] there's only one Lord. Amen. Because
[1:10:28] there's only one God.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just, you know, the
[1:10:32] more you search the scripture, if you if
[1:10:35] the Lord reveals it to you, it's it's so
[1:10:37] simple. People talk about how
[1:10:39] complicated it is and how it contradicts
[1:10:41] and how all these people of all these
[1:10:44] years, I watched a couple of interviews
[1:10:46] that Charlie was talking to some kids
[1:10:48] and they would they would question about
[1:10:49] the Bible. And I heard uh one recently
[1:10:52] that said, you know, the the the Bible
[1:10:54] not written by God. A bunch of men wrote
[1:10:56] it. He said, "But a bunch of men that
[1:10:59] were under the influence of God."
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there were all these men over
[1:11:03] this time. They they they they were over
[1:11:06] years. They didn't know each other. And
[1:11:08] uh I would have liked to have said,
[1:11:10] "Well, that makes the Bible more
[1:11:12] prophetic to me because every bit of it
[1:11:15] for men that didn't know each other for
[1:11:17] it to dovetail so perfectly together,
[1:11:19] Genesis to Revelation of these men who
[1:11:21] wrote it and didn't know one thing about
[1:11:23] each other.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:26] didn't live together. I mean, then it
[1:11:29] could have been more misconstrued. But
[1:11:31] you can't now to recognize to look over
[1:11:33] here and see what David said about the
[1:11:36] crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Just the several places that he wrote,
[1:11:41] "Oh, they pierced my hands and my feet."
[1:11:43] He didn't know anything about that.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; But look what happened in the
[1:11:46] scriptures. It just coincides so
[1:11:49] perfectly together. That's why it's so
[1:11:51] beautiful. There's one Lord. Amen. One
[1:11:53] faith, one baptism.
[1:11:56] Amen. That means that Jesus Christ and
[1:12:01] Peter did not contradict each other.
[1:12:05] It can't because there's only one
[1:12:07] baptism.
[1:12:10] Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; One God. Not two, not a dozen, not
[1:12:14] three. One God and father of all. Amen.
[1:12:20] Now, does that mean that there's a God
[1:12:21] and a father?
[1:12:23] But people try to use the conjunction
[1:12:25] the conjunctions to try to separate
[1:12:27] them. No, he's God and father because
[1:12:31] he's one God.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I one God and father
[1:12:36] of all who is above all, through all,
[1:12:39] and in you all. But unto everyone is uh
[1:12:44] every one of us is given grace according
[1:12:47] to the measure of the gift of Christ.
[1:12:49] And I'm thankful for that grace.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. the measure of the gift of Christ.
[1:12:55] Wherefore
[1:12:57] of the gift of the Holy Spirit of
[1:12:59] Christ, wherefore he said, when he
[1:13:02] ascended up on high, he led captivity
[1:13:05] captive and gave gifts unto men. Now, uh
[1:13:10] I I'm not sure we'll get into those
[1:13:13] gifts. We may at some point during this
[1:13:15] time. uh it would kind of make sense
[1:13:17] maybe if we did. But uh if you go over
[1:13:20] in Corinthians, you'll find out with the
[1:13:21] gifts it talks about the speaking in
[1:13:23] tongues and prophecy and helps and
[1:13:25] government and all the gifts of uh the
[1:13:28] spiritual gifts that's given unto the
[1:13:29] church. Well, he when he ascended up on
[1:13:32] high, he led captivity captive and gave
[1:13:35] gifts unto men. Amen. Gave gifts unto
[1:13:39] men. Now, if you notice, let's just read
[1:13:42] on, but I want you to notice something.
[1:13:44] Ninth and 10th vers. Now uh let me read
[1:13:46] the eighth again. Wherefore he says when
[1:13:49] he ascended up on high led captivity
[1:13:51] captive gave this unto men. Okay. Praise
[1:13:53] the Lord. Now now he that uh now that he
[1:13:57] ascended that is it but uh that is it
[1:14:00] but that he also descended first into
[1:14:03] the lower parts of the earth. He that
[1:14:05] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:14:08] up far above all heavens that he might
[1:14:10] fill all things. But now notice
[1:14:14] those two verses are in parenthesis.
[1:14:18] Amen. So this is a if you will a
[1:14:21] statement that he's making that Paul's
[1:14:24] making to the Ephesian church. He's
[1:14:26] making this statement. Wherefore he send
[1:14:28] it up on high led captivity captive gist
[1:14:30] of men. He's making a statement and he
[1:14:34] offshoots that statement. Now you could
[1:14:36] you could bracket it off with
[1:14:38] quotations. You could bracket it off
[1:14:39] with with parentheses. You could bracket
[1:14:41] it off with commas, whatever way. Amen.
[1:14:45] This in my Bible, it's bracketed off
[1:14:47] with parentheses.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; So, he's making a statement and he goes
[1:14:51] and he adds some validity to that
[1:14:54] statement by saying, "He that ascended
[1:14:57] uh was was the same one that descended
[1:14:59] to the lower parts of the earth asking a
[1:15:02] question." And he ascended up far above
[1:15:04] all all heavens that he might fill all
[1:15:06] things. So he's adding an explanation or
[1:15:10] an addition to what his statement is
[1:15:13] that he uh was ascended up on high and
[1:15:16] led captiv captivity captive dead gives
[1:15:18] unto men. Amen. So his next two verses
[1:15:21] are an offshoot or a a explanation of
[1:15:27] what he's talking about. Amen. And
[1:15:29] questioning. So maybe uh we don't know.
[1:15:32] There could be people there that uh
[1:15:35] didn't quite understand what he was
[1:15:37] talking about or maybe disbelieved what
[1:15:39] he was talking about. So, as the spirit
[1:15:42] leads, Amen.
[1:15:44] probably how many times I do that. I I
[1:15:47] try to listen to the Lord uh when I'm up
[1:15:49] here and whatever the Lord gives me.
[1:15:52] You'd be surprised at how many messages
[1:15:54] I have here and I have all kinds of
[1:15:56] notes that I don't one note, one
[1:15:58] scripture out of the entire page
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; because everything is what the Lord gave
[1:16:03] me.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised how many I mean I
[1:16:06] could tell you but it's a lot. Amen. But
[1:16:09] but in in in the spirit in Paul in the
[1:16:12] spirit leading Paul
[1:16:15] there must have been a spirit there. You
[1:16:16] notice brother Brandham sometimes would
[1:16:18] preach or he would be in discernment or
[1:16:20] something and he would catch somebody's
[1:16:21] thought and he would stop and he would
[1:16:23] go to that thought or he would go to
[1:16:25] that person or or whatever that spirit
[1:16:27] led him to. Amen. And I can imagine that
[1:16:30] maybe when Paul was doing this as a as a
[1:16:34] a a prophet of God, apostle as he was
[1:16:38] reading, as he was giving this
[1:16:39] statement,
[1:16:41] uh he ascended up on high, left
[1:16:43] captivity captive, gave gifts to men.
[1:16:45] Maybe there was a question, maybe there
[1:16:46] was something there, maybe there was
[1:16:47] doubt. So what does he do? He goes on,
[1:16:50] he says, "Now he that ascended up, what
[1:16:52] is it? But he that descended first in
[1:16:55] the lower parts of the earth." See,
[1:16:56] that's a question. She's questioning to
[1:16:59] say if those of you are doubting this is
[1:17:03] the explanation.
[1:17:04] Praise the Lord about him uh ascended up
[1:17:07] on high and live captive cathic gave
[1:17:09] gifts to men. Now he's given explanation
[1:17:11] first is to a question. A lot of times
[1:17:14] when you're in reasoning with people or
[1:17:17] debating with people or trying to talk
[1:17:19] to reason with somebody, uh you you will
[1:17:22] do that. You'll you'll come off with a
[1:17:24] question. Well, what is it that now he
[1:17:26] ascended up uh what that but he
[1:17:29] descended first into the lower parts of
[1:17:31] the earth.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he explains that he that
[1:17:36] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:17:39] up far above all heavens that he might
[1:17:41] fill all things.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all that is is just an
[1:17:46] explanation if you will of what he's
[1:17:48] talking about. But now in the uh uh 11th
[1:17:53] verse he continues his thought. His
[1:17:56] thought continues from the eighth verse.
[1:18:00] So what I'm going to do, please forgive
[1:18:02] me if this offends anybody. I'm going to
[1:18:05] omit verses 8 and N. And let's read it
[1:18:09] again.
[1:18:10] Wherefore he said when he ascended up on
[1:18:14] high, he led captivity captive and gave
[1:18:18] gifts unto men. He gave some apostles
[1:18:21] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:18:24] and some pastors and teachers. Now, how
[1:18:26] does that sound?
[1:18:28] Sounds like a continuation of a thought.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without eight and nine, without
[1:18:34] the explanation of the ascending and
[1:18:36] descending, without that explanation,
[1:18:39] this the his this paragraph, this uh uh
[1:18:43] speech is this teaching he's giving
[1:18:45] flows a lot better really if you take
[1:18:47] those two verses out. Amen. Uh led cap
[1:18:51] captivity captive, gave gifts unto men.
[1:18:54] He gave some apostles. So see these are
[1:18:57] gifts of God. These are the gifts of God
[1:19:00] that God gives. Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Now we know that the that the main gift
[1:19:05] that we've got, the gift of the Holy
[1:19:06] Ghost is that that God comes in us is
[1:19:08] the greatest gift we have. But upon that
[1:19:11] in in in the bringing of that spirit
[1:19:14] comes the gifts that God distributed
[1:19:17] unto men. Now remember these gifts are
[1:19:20] without callings are without repentance.
[1:19:22] These gifts and callings are without
[1:19:24] repentance. Right. Amen. So, a person
[1:19:26] can have that gift or have even that
[1:19:28] calling and still not believe it, still
[1:19:31] not uh uh accept it or use it maybe in
[1:19:35] uh a a way that's not godly, if you
[1:19:38] will, or use it in a way that doesn't
[1:19:40] edify God. That happens also. Amen.
[1:19:43] That's I I hear probably a lot of you
[1:19:46] probably like I do when you hear
[1:19:48] psychic, uh your eyes roll. Uh mine
[1:19:51] probably rolls so loud you can hear it
[1:19:53] at your house from mine. Sister
[1:19:55] when my eyes roll or brother Dennis how
[1:19:57] far you are away from us you could
[1:19:59] probably hear my eyes roll you say well
[1:20:01] and you heard the word psychic again
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; cuz but but
[1:20:06] uh because
[1:20:09] if if not all of it at least 99% of it
[1:20:12] is fake and put on and people trying to
[1:20:15] make money but I don't deny the fact
[1:20:18] that there are people that may have a
[1:20:21] gift
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; and they're using it for the devil are
[1:20:24] using it not to edify Christ, but they
[1:20:27] may have a gift.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; they may have a gift to uh to be able to
[1:20:31] do the what they call psychic things uh
[1:20:34] that that are there that reading minds
[1:20:36] or whatever. A lot of people call
[1:20:38] brother a mind reader. A lot of people
[1:20:41] call brother Brandham a fortune teller
[1:20:43] or something like that. you know, bad
[1:20:44] names,
[1:20:46] devilish names, terms, um, that that
[1:20:50] would that would try to lessen the gift
[1:20:52] of God in his life. And of course, that
[1:20:55] was the devil. But I I don't deny that
[1:20:57] there's people out there that had that.
[1:20:59] But see, God, when go when he talks
[1:21:00] about when Paul's talking about this
[1:21:03] give giving gifts of men, this is a very
[1:21:05] specific reason he's talking about. He
[1:21:08] goes to the Corinthian church about all
[1:21:09] the gifts of tongues and prophecy and
[1:21:11] all those. But what he's talking about
[1:21:13] here now is a specific uh uh area of a
[1:21:18] five-fold ministry as we've come to
[1:21:20] affectionately known as brother Brandham
[1:21:22] called a five-fold ministry.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Five-fold prophet, teacher,
[1:21:26] evangelist, missionary, prophet. So this
[1:21:29] now he says when he led captivity
[1:21:31] captive, he gave gifts unto men. So
[1:21:35] these gifts are God-given. Amen. It's
[1:21:38] God gives these gifts. He gives the gift
[1:21:40] of uh he gave some apostles and some
[1:21:43] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:21:46] pastors and some teachers.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; So each one has that that gift. Those
[1:21:51] that are called has that gift. Amen. Uh
[1:21:55] you you know me and you know the way I
[1:21:58] feel and I I I don't believe that God
[1:22:02] made it. Not that a person can't preach
[1:22:06] or be edifying or helpful to people, but
[1:22:09] I believe that if you're called to be a
[1:22:12] pastor, that's what you do.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't go out doing
[1:22:17] missionary work and evangelistic work.
[1:22:19] And
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; if you're called to be a pastor, you're
[1:22:21] a pastor. That's what you do.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; A pastor's main function is to guard the
[1:22:28] sheep and protect the sheep and to feed
[1:22:30] the sheep.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's their job. That's pretty hard to
[1:22:33] do when you're 5,000 miles away for
[1:22:36] months at a time. When you're 10, 12,000
[1:22:40] miles away in some other country on some
[1:22:42] other continent, it's kind of hard to
[1:22:44] do.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there's associate pastors and
[1:22:48] such like that and I would agree with
[1:22:50] that. Amen. But I'm a little more
[1:22:52] liberal with them than I am the pastor.
[1:22:53] The pastor's the pastor and then
[1:22:55] associate pastor, they should be in line
[1:22:57] together as much as possible. But the
[1:22:59] associate pastor gets a call to go out.
[1:23:01] the pastor's there. Amen. The pastor
[1:23:04] gets a call to go out, the associate
[1:23:05] pastor be there. But for to go to go six
[1:23:08] months out of the year, I don't agree
[1:23:10] with that.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh when I wasn't feeling well, uh
[1:23:15] you all know I got I wasn't feeling well
[1:23:17] a few weeks ago and had to cancel church
[1:23:19] here. Well, that Thursday night, that
[1:23:22] Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Brother Roger
[1:23:23] had some special meetings with a brother
[1:23:25] from back east and he called me and
[1:23:27] asked me if I would minister on
[1:23:29] Thursday. and I was planning on doing
[1:23:30] it. Uh but then I got to where I wasn't
[1:23:33] feeling well. So I I didn't I had to
[1:23:35] text him and tell him I wasn't going to
[1:23:37] be able to do it. Uh but he called and I
[1:23:39] said, "I would have no problem with
[1:23:41] that.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; I'd have had no problem going over and
[1:23:43] ministering him on a Thursday night. It
[1:23:45] didn't affect our service.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And uh if there's something that God put
[1:23:49] on his heart, maybe I could help those
[1:23:50] people. But it's not like I'm going over
[1:23:52] for months at a time or something.
[1:23:53] That's a totally different thing.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; It's not like I you all know this. I
[1:23:58] don't actively call other pastors to
[1:24:00] come minister for us. I just I just
[1:24:03] don't do that. Now, obviously, if we did
[1:24:05] it now, only having a Sunday morning,
[1:24:07] they would have to leave their Sunday
[1:24:08] morning service to come here to do it.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; I I just I I and honestly, that's that's
[1:24:15] actually one thing I disagree with
[1:24:16] brother Roger about. uh truthfully he
[1:24:19] thinks they're kind of more
[1:24:21] interchangeable and a person can do this
[1:24:23] for a while and do this for a while and
[1:24:26] that's possibly so but not effective not
[1:24:29] as effective a pastor is effective as a
[1:24:32] pastor.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He might can help somebody or he might
[1:24:35] can do some good as an evangelist but
[1:24:36] that's not his call. That's not where
[1:24:38] he's supposed to be. That's not what his
[1:24:41] ministry and his nature is geared
[1:24:42] toward. He's geared toward being a
[1:24:44] pastor. an evangelist geared toward
[1:24:46] being a pastor. I mean,
[1:24:50] not an evangelist. An evangelist
[1:24:51] shouldn't be a pastor,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I I've seen them and and an evangelist
[1:24:56] comes and he rips a place apart and he
[1:24:58] hits the street. Amen. That's what he
[1:25:00] does. He comes and tears a hide off of
[1:25:02] people and he's gone. And he goes and he
[1:25:06] goes and does this wherever he goes.
[1:25:07] That's what he does. the pastor comes
[1:25:09] along with the sav and he nurses things
[1:25:12] back to uh the way they should be. And I
[1:25:15] mean, brother Brandham kind of did all
[1:25:17] that whole thing in one meeting. You
[1:25:19] know, brother Brown rip the hot off of
[1:25:21] you one second and he's got the sav out
[1:25:22] the next. But that's what an evangelist
[1:25:25] does.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And if an evangelist stays in front of a
[1:25:27] group of people as a pastor for a long
[1:25:29] period of time, people are just going to
[1:25:31] leap. Usually, people are just going to
[1:25:34] leap. They're not going to sit there
[1:25:35] every service and just get ripped apart
[1:25:37] every single service,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; They need a little kindness. They need a
[1:25:41] little nurturing. They need a little
[1:25:42] taking care of. Amen. Which is what a
[1:25:45] pastor supposed to do because that's his
[1:25:47] job,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you got teachers and uh
[1:25:50] missionaries who should be burning up
[1:25:52] the fields. Now, I know the missionary
[1:25:54] fields aren't what they used to be, but
[1:25:56] that doesn't mean God doesn't have
[1:25:57] missionaries or
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; uh u uh or or teachers. Um we we still
[1:26:05] there's still a need for that. Amen.
[1:26:08] There's always in fact, Brother Brandham
[1:26:09] said, we'll have this need in this
[1:26:12] ministry, this five-fold ministry until
[1:26:13] the Lord comes.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Right? So, uh, if if people try to, uh,
[1:26:19] denigrate that, uh, again, and I've made
[1:26:22] this statement before, I'll make it
[1:26:23] again.
[1:26:25] It baffles me how tape only people can
[1:26:29] be tape only people, right?
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; If you're a tape only person and you're
[1:26:34] only listening to the tape, I'm sorry
[1:26:35] for the word salad, but I'm getting to a
[1:26:37] point. And you're you're only you're a
[1:26:40] tape only person and you're only
[1:26:41] listening to tapes. How are you not
[1:26:44] listening on those tapes when that tape
[1:26:46] is telling you to go to church and have
[1:26:47] a pastor?
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And have live ministry.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And have the five-fold ministry is
[1:26:53] supposed to be in effect until the Lord
[1:26:54] comes.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; How are they missing that? I don't know.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; I really don't. Or they're not
[1:26:59] listening.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Or or they don't play the tape that Lord
[1:27:03] that brother Brown talks about that. I
[1:27:05] don't know. I I'm not sure how that can
[1:27:08] be. But that's that what I get from it
[1:27:11] is he is that's exactly what brother
[1:27:13] Brandham's saying. In fact, let me read
[1:27:15] you this
[1:27:16] since I'm to it and again just like last
[1:27:20] week
[1:27:23] I'm
[1:27:24] moving in a different way. So whatever
[1:27:26] the Lord wants a question
[1:27:30] went came to brother Brandham on the
[1:27:31] questions and answers of the seals.
[1:27:34] The question was, would the bride of
[1:27:36] Christ
[1:27:37] uh have a ministry before the rapture?
[1:27:40] Now, the bride of Christ, it doesn't say
[1:27:42] brother Brandham. It doesn't say him. It
[1:27:44] says the bride of Christ. Now, if you
[1:27:46] think now, if a person thinks that
[1:27:49] brother Brandham was the only member of
[1:27:51] that bride, then okay, you're you're
[1:27:54] fine there. Amen. But I want you to know
[1:27:58] that if you believe, and I'm using this
[1:28:01] hypothetically, but if you believe that
[1:28:03] brother Brandham was the only bride
[1:28:06] member, that puts you out,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:10] That does it not? Cuz that makes Brother
[1:28:12] Brandham the only bride member. You're
[1:28:14] not bride because he's the only one,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; That puts you out by believing that,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; right? Again,
[1:28:24] stuff that seems sometimes like common
[1:28:26] sense just baffles me.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; It It really does.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; But now his point is, does the bride of
[1:28:33] Christ
[1:28:35] have a ministry after the uh uh would
[1:28:38] the bride of Christ have a ministry
[1:28:40] before the rapture? Before the rapture.
[1:28:44] So, this is 1963 to 2025. Now, we're
[1:28:48] standing here in September. What does
[1:28:50] brother Random say? Brother Ram says,
[1:28:52] "Sure,
[1:28:54] that's what's going on right now." See,
[1:28:57] the bride of Christ certainly it is the
[1:29:01] message of the hour. See the bride of
[1:29:03] Christ. Sure, she is she is consisting
[1:29:07] of apostles,
[1:29:09] prophets. She is not him. She is
[1:29:13] consisting of apostles, prophets,
[1:29:16] teachers, evangelists, and pastors.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:23] That's a five-fold ministry.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; That's a bride's ministry in the last
[1:29:28] day before the rapture. It wasn't all in
[1:29:31] brother Brandham. In fact, brother
[1:29:32] Brandham is saying here is for all of
[1:29:35] these to have in the bride of Christ
[1:29:38] with the message of the hour.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He says that's the bride
[1:29:46] of Christ. Sure. She's got a ministry,
[1:29:48] great ministry, the ministry of the
[1:29:49] hour. And it will be so humble.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What's going on now?
[1:29:56] It's still going on.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And it will go on until we all go home
[1:30:00] until the rapture.
[1:30:03] God, his bride will have a five-fold
[1:30:07] ministry. God will have a voice to his
[1:30:09] bride. Amen. Nothing wrong with
[1:30:11] listening to tapes. Obviously
[1:30:14] not. In fact, we all should uh listen to
[1:30:17] tape. Absolutely.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Feed on that word. Get into that
[1:30:22] storehouse of that stored up food and
[1:30:24] and enjoy and eat. Amen. But then we
[1:30:27] come to church and let the Lord speak to
[1:30:30] us even fresh. A lot of times uh the
[1:30:33] fresh will just reiterate what God has
[1:30:36] already spoken.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. which Peter said that in two or
[1:30:41] three places over in his gospels that he
[1:30:43] said we we come just to stir up your
[1:30:46] mind. We come just to bring back to you
[1:30:49] to bring back to your remembrance the
[1:30:51] things that we know to be the truth. We
[1:30:54] know we did not uh we we have not
[1:30:58] followed cunningly devised fables.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We followed a gospel, a
[1:31:04] truth, a word ministered and brought by
[1:31:06] God Almighty to a bride.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; And this bride in this last days has a
[1:31:11] ministry. What's her ministry? She g He
[1:31:13] gave some apostles. He gave some
[1:31:15] prophets, evangelists, pastors, and
[1:31:18] teachers. Amen. Now, let's look at this
[1:31:21] real quick. We'll go on. We'll probably
[1:31:23] come back to these because we'll
[1:31:25] probably eventually individualize these,
[1:31:29] but let's continue on for right now.
[1:31:32] Because there's three purposes. The
[1:31:34] Bible lists three purposes for this
[1:31:37] five-fold ministry.
[1:31:40] The 12th verse enumerates them. For the
[1:31:44] perfecting of the saints,
[1:31:47] for the work of the ministry,
[1:31:50] and for the edifying of the body of
[1:31:52] Christ.
[1:31:54] That is the three-fold purpose that God
[1:31:56] gave to this five-fold ministry. That is
[1:32:00] that is it is to accomplish.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfecting of the saints, working
[1:32:06] in the ministry, and edifying of the
[1:32:09] body of Christ. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:32:11] look,
[1:32:13] we can break these down a little bit.
[1:32:16] For the perfecting of the saints. Now,
[1:32:18] so many people get in their minds that
[1:32:21] that perfecting is to make a bride
[1:32:23] sinless. The blood of Jesus Christ makes
[1:32:27] the bride sinless. Amen. The blood has
[1:32:31] washed her clean. It's the blood that
[1:32:34] makes the bride sinless.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; He took our place so we could take his
[1:32:39] place. He shed his blood so we don't
[1:32:42] have to. He became me that I might
[1:32:45] become him.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; That I could take his place. That I
[1:32:49] could put on his robe of righteousness
[1:32:51] which is without a bl a spot, blink,
[1:32:55] blemish, or wrinkle. Amen. It's his that
[1:32:59] we put on. It's by his blood. Amen. That
[1:33:03] we put that on that be that we become
[1:33:06] sinless. Now, not in our humanity, not
[1:33:08] in our flesh, not in our carality, not
[1:33:11] in our bodies, not in our spirits, but
[1:33:13] in God's eyes through that blood, he
[1:33:15] sees a sinless, perfect bride.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sinless and perfect
[1:33:23] without spot, wrinkle, or blemish.
[1:33:25] That's the bride. Now, he is a human. Oh
[1:33:28] my my my I would hate to try to
[1:33:30] enumerate all of my faults. This wall's
[1:33:32] not big enough. These walls aren't large
[1:33:35] enough. There's not enough ink on the
[1:33:37] world to try to write down all of mine.
[1:33:41] But it doesn't matter
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:45] cleanses us. Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Of all unrighteousness.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, it's not a sinless
[1:33:52] perfection that we we're we are in God's
[1:33:56] eyes at, but in our humanity, we're not
[1:33:58] sinless. In our carnality, we're not
[1:34:00] sinless. Here is humans. We're not
[1:34:03] sinless. No. Amen. It's not a perfecting
[1:34:06] of the saints in the sense that we
[1:34:09] become sinless. Amen. as humans because
[1:34:12] we're always
[1:34:14] always false sin come short of the glory
[1:34:16] of God always repenting asking God's
[1:34:18] forgiveness always needing his grace
[1:34:20] always needing his mercy always leaning
[1:34:22] on the blood always believing and
[1:34:25] expecting that that blood to still be on
[1:34:27] that mercy seat today making
[1:34:28] intercession on my behalf
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; on our behalf it's still there
[1:34:34] perfecting of the saints simply means
[1:34:36] strengthening
[1:34:38] or edifying
[1:34:39] that's all it means means perfecting,
[1:34:41] dispering,
[1:34:43] uh is an edification. It's a
[1:34:45] strengthening. The the uh the work of
[1:34:48] the five-fold ministry is to bring
[1:34:50] strength to the bride. How does she get
[1:34:53] strength? From the word.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; From the spirit of God and from the
[1:34:57] word. The word revealing itself to you.
[1:34:59] The Holy Spirit revealing that word to
[1:35:01] you. We become edified.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; We become strengthened. Amen. Because of
[1:35:06] that word. That word brings life. That
[1:35:09] word brings strength
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and that's what the bride is to do. Now,
[1:35:14] it is the calling that God gives us in
[1:35:16] whatever position it's in. Like I said,
[1:35:18] an evangelist can help maybe if he's
[1:35:20] pastoring. What he says may be good and
[1:35:23] he may be a God- called minister. But
[1:35:25] look, if a person is not a God-led
[1:35:29] minister, God has no obligation. Listen
[1:35:32] to this real close now. If God if they
[1:35:35] are not a God called minister, God is
[1:35:39] absolutely not responsible for holding
[1:35:42] that person true to the word.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if you're God called, if God
[1:35:48] is I if if God has called you, placed
[1:35:50] you, this is your calling, this is where
[1:35:52] God has you, God is obligated to take
[1:35:55] care of you. And that goes with any
[1:35:58] calling. That goes with any position.
[1:36:01] You're in your position. God has called
[1:36:03] you to this position. God's placed you
[1:36:05] there. God is obligated to take care of
[1:36:08] you. What's the saying that we've heard
[1:36:09] for so many times, for so many years?
[1:36:11] God's will can't lead you or his grace
[1:36:13] can't keep you.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] If you're in God's will, being led by
[1:36:20] his spirit in your place, in your
[1:36:21] position, God is obligated to take care
[1:36:24] of you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Scripturally obligated. But if you're
[1:36:29] out of that
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and say a man gets behind a pull pit to
[1:36:33] take a position he's not called to,
[1:36:36] God's not obligated to take care of that
[1:36:38] man. God is not obligated to keep that
[1:36:40] man right on the word.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if that man is not right
[1:36:45] on the word,
[1:36:47] then anything can happen really.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, I was going to be a little more
[1:36:50] polite, but the truth is anything can
[1:36:52] happen to that person
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; and they can start preaching anything.
[1:36:55] They can start believing anything.
[1:36:57] Forgive me, saints, but it's just come
[1:37:00] to me. That could be the very reason a
[1:37:03] lot of these people are leaving the
[1:37:04] message,
[1:37:06] leaving the truth. Why?
[1:37:10] They weren't called to it to begin with.
[1:37:12] So, God wasn't obligated to hold them
[1:37:14] there.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; And that's a hard thought to think
[1:37:16] because I got some precious friends that
[1:37:18] I know personally that I love dearly
[1:37:21] that have left and went off away from
[1:37:23] this this truth, this message.
[1:37:26] And that hurts me deeply,
[1:37:28] but it carried very well. And and and
[1:37:32] people I thought were
[1:37:34] stout believers were were gallant
[1:37:38] ministers, were preachers of the truth,
[1:37:41] the gospel,
[1:37:44] and go away. Some pastors,
[1:37:48] Amen. I know in my mind right now, two
[1:37:50] pastors, three pastors,
[1:37:53] Amen. that have denounced this truth.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe. I don't know. I believe in my
[1:38:03] heart of hearts they're going to be
[1:38:04] saved.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; God have mercy. I really do. I I I
[1:38:10] absolutely refuse to believe anything
[1:38:11] different.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; But that could be the reason.
[1:38:15] I I don't know. It just came to me. But
[1:38:19] God is not obligated to keep a man if
[1:38:21] he's not in his God called position.
[1:38:24] God's not obligated to keep him straight
[1:38:26] on the word if he's not in his God
[1:38:28] called position.
[1:38:30] Perfecting now edifying, strengthening,
[1:38:34] strengthening of the saints by the word.
[1:38:36] The word brings strength. The word
[1:38:37] brings healing. The word brings
[1:38:39] blessing. The word brings comfort. The
[1:38:41] word what does the word not bring?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. all the goodness and things that
[1:38:47] the Lord gives us the perfecting of the
[1:38:50] saints for the work of the ministry to
[1:38:52] be working in the ministry to be a work
[1:38:54] of the ministry to be someone who works
[1:38:57] in it. So when someone
[1:39:00] something is needed,
[1:39:03] it's probably a little simpler with our
[1:39:06] small group, but nevertheless, you can
[1:39:09] understand nobody but my wife probably
[1:39:12] maybe Mike, I'm not sure because he was
[1:39:13] with us when he was in our home of how
[1:39:16] it affects a minister, how it affects a
[1:39:18] pastor, how that the weight of that is
[1:39:21] on that man 24/7.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. of your well-being, your spiritual
[1:39:27] well-being, your position in Christ,
[1:39:29] your
[1:39:30] your wellness physically, everything
[1:39:32] about it. It it continuously weighs on a
[1:39:35] person all the time. Even if it's not on
[1:39:37] your lips or in the forefront of your
[1:39:39] mind, it's in your spirit and you know
[1:39:41] it when it comes up that it's there and
[1:39:44] you feel it. You say, "It's not
[1:39:46] grieving." It's not grieving. It's just
[1:39:48] something that pulls from you.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It's something that pulls off of you.
[1:39:52] And and that pull is something that It
[1:39:54] it takes something out of a person. Uh
[1:39:57] takes something out of a man for in that
[1:40:00] position, but it's a work of the
[1:40:02] ministry. It comes with the territory.
[1:40:04] It's part of it. Again, you can ask my
[1:40:06] wife. She's lived in it, lived through
[1:40:08] it. She understands. She knows because
[1:40:11] she's seen it. Front row seat
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; and then some. But it's a work of the
[1:40:17] ministry. It's a work. Ministry is a
[1:40:20] work. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of times, unfortunately, in
[1:40:24] the dynamic that we live in and and the
[1:40:27] world's economy and the way things go,
[1:40:30] you got most smaller churches, in fact,
[1:40:33] I don't know of any smaller churches
[1:40:35] like ours where the pastor doesn't work
[1:40:37] to make money, has to make a living.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Um, most do. You got a handful of them
[1:40:43] out there that are larger churches that
[1:40:45] are able to take care of a pastor. a
[1:40:46] pastor to just spend that time straight
[1:40:49] in that work of that ministry, straight
[1:40:50] in that 24/7 or all the time is studying
[1:40:54] or whatever praying. Amen. It doesn't
[1:40:57] always fall on all all of us that way,
[1:40:59] but still we do what we need to do.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; And God gives grace and I'm thankful for
[1:41:04] that.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; God gives grace just like the job I have
[1:41:06] now. Thank God God gave me that job and
[1:41:09] I'm thankful for it. And I know and
[1:41:11] believe that if it comes a time that the
[1:41:13] Lord says, uh, okay, the period for you
[1:41:16] to be there is over, he'll show me and
[1:41:18] and it'll be over. Maybe when I die, I
[1:41:21] don't know. But there is a work of the
[1:41:24] ministry that is a fulfillment of that
[1:41:26] five-fold ministry to work in that
[1:41:28] ministry and for the edifying of the
[1:41:32] body of Christ. See, because the work of
[1:41:34] the ministry, the work of the ministry
[1:41:36] is to edify people.
[1:41:39] Not just themselves or not just
[1:41:41] therefore no more, but it's to edify the
[1:41:45] entire body.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; The entire body of Christ.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Edify is to build up. In fact, I think I
[1:41:52] I printed it here.
[1:41:54] Edifying. To build up to to build a
[1:41:57] building is what he's talking about. To
[1:42:00] build a building. To edify. to build up
[1:42:02] to strengthen uh just as we talked about
[1:42:05] even with the uh perfecting of the
[1:42:07] saints edifying a building up building
[1:42:10] of a building brother talked about you
[1:42:13] know almost anybody could masonry a
[1:42:15] straight wall but it takes a true mason
[1:42:18] to turn the corner
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; right
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; he said why because we're not building a
[1:42:21] wall we're building a building
[1:42:24] amenifying
[1:42:26] to build up to to build up to edify the
[1:42:30] act
[1:42:31] The act of one who promotes another's
[1:42:35] growth in spiritual wisdom.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; The act of one who promotes another's
[1:42:42] growth in spiritual wisdom. Edifying to
[1:42:46] edify to bring edification. Now, when it
[1:42:49] says to edify of the body of Christ,
[1:42:53] that helps us all understand that when
[1:42:57] I'll just say me just for just not to
[1:43:01] use anybody out there. If if I get
[1:43:04] edified,
[1:43:06] it's a blessing to the whole body.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; If a brother over in Marishia gets
[1:43:13] edified, it helps us.
[1:43:17] If a bo if a if a brother in China gets
[1:43:19] built up and edified, it helps us.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; It helps the one over in Australia.
[1:43:26] It helps the one uh in in Russia
[1:43:30] because it's all an edification because
[1:43:32] remember what we just read. There is one
[1:43:35] body.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; One body. We're all part of that same
[1:43:41] mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. and in this one body we're all a
[1:43:45] part of needs the building up of that
[1:43:48] body into the edification of the bride
[1:43:50] of Christ.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; That's who she is. Amen. That ministry
[1:43:54] that five-fold ministries to do that.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray Lord bless that fivefold
[1:43:59] ministry.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's be in the call we're to be
[1:44:02] in. Be where God's called us. Be in that
[1:44:04] place where God's placed us. And let
[1:44:06] that edification come. Let that
[1:44:09] rapturing faith come. Let that build in
[1:44:12] this bride to the place that we that the
[1:44:14] the dead in Christ rise and we see our
[1:44:16] loved ones in here before us.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here or home or wherever.
[1:44:22] Amen. I don't believe it's long either.
[1:44:24] Amen. I sat in here the other day
[1:44:26] studying and reading and just something
[1:44:29] overcome me. I just I just sat there and
[1:44:32] looked ahead for just
[1:44:34] five minutes or more just waiting.
[1:44:38] Honestly, it just overcome me to a place
[1:44:40] I was expecting to see my son,
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; My dad, my mom. I was expecting that.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; I was I had that kind of an expectation
[1:44:48] as I sat there. I don't know. Somebody
[1:44:49] thought I was in a trance. I I'm really
[1:44:51] not sure what happened around me, but it
[1:44:54] just came over me in that way.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's going to be just like
[1:44:58] that.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Wherever we are, whatever time, it's
[1:45:01] going to be just like that. And they're
[1:45:03] going to be starting a period before us
[1:45:05] any moment, anytime. Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Every bit of this brings that edifying
[1:45:10] is is a part of that. It it it brings
[1:45:13] that along and helps that come forward
[1:45:16] and and and bring forward in in that
[1:45:19] body of Christ. Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; A lot of times I'm going to close here
[1:45:25] in just a minute, but a lot of times you
[1:45:27] don't see very many people or I haven't
[1:45:29] anyway seen too much teaching on the
[1:45:31] five-fold ministry. I I don't know why.
[1:45:35] In fact, I don't know that I've ever
[1:45:36] heard anybody except maybe brother
[1:45:38] Brandham preach on the five-fold
[1:45:40] ministry.
[1:45:42] Maybe you have. That's okay. Maybe
[1:45:44] you've heard me touch on it before.
[1:45:46] That's okay, too. Amen. But I haven't.
[1:45:48] I've heard they don't that people don't
[1:45:50] talk about so many times you
[1:45:53] unfortunately I'm afraid there's so many
[1:45:55] guilty of it that they don't want to
[1:45:56] talk about.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] God makes special provisions and things
[1:46:02] along the way, but you know, u
[1:46:06] the reason a lot of times that things
[1:46:08] get scrupled up is is out of ignorance.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Look and say, well, you know, how
[1:46:14] horrible things are and how horrible way
[1:46:16] people act and how horrible the mind.
[1:46:18] There are people that just because the
[1:46:21] Bible talks that people that receive the
[1:46:23] truth and reject it. Don't have anything
[1:46:25] to do with it. There there's people that
[1:46:28] they know and they don't care.
[1:46:30] But I just can't help but believe the
[1:46:33] majority of people are just ignorant.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; And ignorance people, it's ignorance has
[1:46:38] become such a bad word. But ignorance
[1:46:41] isn't a bad word.
[1:46:43] Ignorance isn't isn't a harmful word.
[1:46:45] Ignorance just means you just don't
[1:46:47] know.
[1:46:49] How can you react on something that you
[1:46:51] don't know?
[1:46:53] If you don't know it, how can you,
[1:46:55] pardon me, know it?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; If you don't know, you don't know. And a
[1:47:01] lot of people just don't know,
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Look what Brother Brandham said here.
[1:47:05] Adoption number two. What is the body of
[1:47:08] Christ? Some are apostles,
[1:47:10] some are prophets, some are teachers,
[1:47:12] some are evangelists, some are pastors.
[1:47:14] Is that right? He said we're called to.
[1:47:16] But others has gift of tongues,
[1:47:17] interpretation, tongues, wisdom,
[1:47:19] knowledge, miracles, working of
[1:47:20] miracles, all these great gift,
[1:47:22] different gifts. And what did they do?
[1:47:24] They practiced that a little bit. What?
[1:47:26] And let it run loose just like I don't
[1:47:29] know what one raise up and speak in
[1:47:32] tongues. The other one go back and talk
[1:47:34] blur blur blur blur blur. He said,
[1:47:36] "Uh-huh. Pastor a preacher preacher will
[1:47:39] be preaching making an altar call and
[1:47:41] somebody will raise up speak in tongues.
[1:47:43] Hallelujah. Praise God. And if the
[1:47:45] preacher happens to go on with his
[1:47:47] message as he has had the authority to
[1:47:49] do because if the minister's ministering
[1:47:51] and has the word and is bringing forth
[1:47:53] the word, he is the one of authority.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. No other no other gifted to rise
[1:47:59] up above that gift or to take over or
[1:48:02] interrupt that gift. Amen. Because that
[1:48:04] the word is the most is the most
[1:48:06] important part.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is more important than
[1:48:09] the tongues or the prophecy or the all
[1:48:12] that may be perfectly right and genuine,
[1:48:14] but if it interrupts what God is what
[1:48:17] God is doing and in the flow of the
[1:48:19] spirit and bringing the word, it's out
[1:48:21] of order.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Brother said, if the preacher happens to
[1:48:25] go on with a message like that, being
[1:48:26] anointed, then the people say, "Oh, he's
[1:48:28] just an old backslider." He said, "See,
[1:48:31] but it's because they're not taught."
[1:48:36] because they're not taught. What does
[1:48:38] that mean? That means they're doing it
[1:48:40] ignorantly. Brings it to light in that
[1:48:42] in in that way. It makes me feel like,
[1:48:45] well, Lord, help me to make sure that
[1:48:48] what I do and the calling you've given
[1:48:49] me that they know and that they're
[1:48:52] taught
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; and that they understand and can see
[1:48:55] scripturally the truth of it. No, not
[1:48:58] ignorance, but truth, reality. Amen. So,
[1:49:01] what does that do? That puts pressure to
[1:49:03] me. puts pressure on me to make sure
[1:49:06] that those that God's put in my
[1:49:08] spiritual care know and are taught and
[1:49:11] forgive me if I repeat myself. Forgive
[1:49:15] me if if if I'm redundant sometimes.
[1:49:19] Uh but I I I try my best to bring it the
[1:49:23] way God gives it and uh what he does
[1:49:26] with us from there. But I probably do
[1:49:30] sometimes maybe uh
[1:49:34] say something more than once or
[1:49:35] redundant about it. Uh truth is there's
[1:49:40] not not here. We have such a small group
[1:49:42] now. But there's times that you know
[1:49:44] that there's people that didn't get it
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You know that there's people that got
[1:49:48] interrupted. You know there was people
[1:49:50] that just weren't listening.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; You know there was people that forgive
[1:49:53] me but probably fell asleep maybe.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That didn't get it.
[1:49:58] So maybe the Lord brings it back again.
[1:50:01] It becomes repetitive. And for those who
[1:50:03] are attentive and listen, it may sound
[1:50:06] repetitive, but uh it's the Lord's it's
[1:50:08] the Lord's word nevertheless.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it brings it to us to
[1:50:14] edifying. Now, let me finish reading
[1:50:15] this and I'm going to close. Till we all
[1:50:18] we're at the 13th verse now.
[1:50:20] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:50:23] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:50:26] God unto a perfect man, unto the measure
[1:50:30] of the stature of his of the fullness of
[1:50:32] Christ. And Lord willing, next week
[1:50:33] we'll probably go over to second Peter
[1:50:35] and pick up that stature of a perfect
[1:50:37] man again a little bit, not teach on it,
[1:50:40] but just to recognize that the ministry,
[1:50:43] the five-fold ministry is to help bring
[1:50:45] it to that place.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the to the uh stature of the
[1:50:50] Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[1:50:52] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:50:54] of Christ, that we henceforth be no more
[1:50:57] children, tossed to and fro, and carried
[1:50:59] about with every wind of doctrine, by
[1:51:00] the slight of man and cunning
[1:51:02] craftiness, whereby they lie and wait to
[1:51:03] deceive, but speaking the truth in love,
[1:51:06] may grow up into him in all things which
[1:51:09] is the head, even Christ, from whom the
[1:51:12] whole body fitly joined together and
[1:51:14] compacted by that which every joint
[1:51:17] joint supply.
[1:51:19] That's all of us. According to the
[1:51:22] effectual working in the measure of
[1:51:24] every part maketh increase of the body
[1:51:26] unto the edifying itself, the edifying
[1:51:30] of itself in love. Amen.
[1:51:34] the bringing of this body together
[1:51:38] in an edification of the pure word,
[1:51:42] the poor, the pure true unadulterated
[1:51:46] word of God, message of the hour, truth
[1:51:49] that God reveals and brings to us and
[1:51:53] things that God may even through the
[1:51:56] message bring the bride to a a different
[1:52:00] place than that.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the message that that was
[1:52:04] brought to us is one thing. Amen.
[1:52:07] There's a lot of things brother Brandon
[1:52:08] didn't talk about. He just like we said
[1:52:11] Paul, there's there's things in the
[1:52:13] scripture brother Brandon didn't talk
[1:52:15] about.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; He may not have hit.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of those things may be very
[1:52:19] good scriptural lessons that somebody
[1:52:21] through God's operating,
[1:52:24] God brings it, shows it to us, and it
[1:52:27] edifies,
[1:52:28] blesses us. Amen. brings strength to us,
[1:52:32] gives us strength for this journey
[1:52:34] because friend, we need more strength
[1:52:35] now in this journey than we've ever had.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're living at the end time and
[1:52:40] now is the time to be fortified and
[1:52:42] strengthened more than ever. Amen. Let's
[1:52:44] stand if we could.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:52:59] By his grace,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; he brings
[1:53:02] by his grace he shows us.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's by his grace that
[1:53:08] we can even stand today.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Let's sing this
[1:53:13] little chorus again that we sang
[1:53:14] earlier. This marvelous grace course
[1:53:16] here.
[1:53:18] This grace, grace, grace of God. Amen.
[1:53:22] Before we dismiss, just worship the Lord
[1:53:24] a little bit. Amen.
[1:53:28] Praise the Lord. So thankful for his
[1:53:29] goodness. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.

[1:53:49] within.

[1:54:51] grace.

[1:54:59] within.
[1:55:02] Grace.

[1:55:06] God's
[1:55:08] grace.
[1:55:10] Grace that is greater than all
[1:55:16] our sin.
[1:55:19] Hallelujah.
[1:55:20] Praise the Lord Jesus. So glad there was
[1:55:24] something to cover
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; and not just cover but annihilate every
