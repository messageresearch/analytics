thought that we've had here the past few weeks a month or so amen the new beginning part five yes and so we will go to genesis chapter one read a couple of verses of scripture and in the first couple of verses amen genesis chapter one i don't know how long uh this may be a little shorter service today we'll see how the lord does it um but kind of the tail end of this is kind of getting into a whole other service and i felt like if i tried to bring it in with this today it would be very lengthy so i was thinking of breaking them both up but doing that may make today a little shorter so but however the lord leads however he wants we'll just see um we'll just start and let him have control praise the lord so whatever his desire is that's what we want amen genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and then before we read this by our heads for word of prayer lord jesus is certainly grateful to be back again this morning thank you lord for this beautiful sunday thank you for the health and strength and life that you give in our bodies lord the desire to be in the house of god once again today lord thank you for that resurrection that resurrection sunday morning that not only you raised but you raised us in you and lord you give us life anew and lord it just dawns on me more and more as you give me this this message to bring lord of how a new beginning is is just that to us every day uh every every week every month lord is a new beginning every week that we have here this first day of the week this sunday this resurrection morning lord it's a time that you give us and i don't know any greater time lord that we can have to to commit to you lord the first day of this week that you give us to start off a week and lord is and we're here this morning lord expecting you to do great things for us today father to do the exceedingly abundantly because we're trusting you and believing you lord may you take every uh uh unwanted undesirable spirit or a situation or disease or affliction or sickness lord and just take it from your people today continue to keep us hedged about lord with your precious holy angels with flaming swords drawn keeping those demonic spirits at bay lord protecting and watching over your own lord may you just bless this service the remaining part of it bless the reading of your word lord in all that is said and done may it be to glorify magnified you today jesus bless those who may be streaming thank you for those who have come lord and we're just trusting you in all things believing that you're going to speak to us once again today and lord have your way in this service and in our lives may not a sick feeble person leave this building today but what they've been well maybe the disappointed the downtrodden or the disheartened lord may you increase our faith and raise us up lord today to receive what we have need of lord that when we leave this place we'll leave afresh and nude in you god lord i pray that you bless this word now as we committed to you in this service just anoint speaker and hear a like and accomplish what you'd have to be purpose for this service today as we committed to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen genesis 1 verse 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth the earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated as you if you'd like last week i didn't get any comments but myself pursling i felt like i was rushing myself for going quickly through the last part of this so bear with me for a few moments if i take five or ten minutes to kind of uh background what we finished with last week and kind of reiterate some of those and it will also uh kind of springboard us into what we want to enter into today because we finished on the fifth feast or the fourth feast and we want to talk more about the fifth the sixth then uh the sixth is where i wanna really mostly concentrate on next week uh but the the sixth and then of course then the seventh which we kind of did a couple of weeks ago but just wanted to background for a little bit and of course read another quote to here that i meant to last week uh to kind of get us caught up in this place because we had the first two feasts uh which were the redemption and the fellowship and we got into the third which were specific times which one immediately followed the other redemption immediately a fellowship with the lord immediately followed our redemption uh which brought us to a place of the first fruits of the waving of the of the sheaf waving uh which was uh a symbolic of the bride today uh a loosely fit together group that was bound together by one common thread we know today that's jesus and it was mingled with oil as it went into this uh as it went into this meal offering that was given to the lord and as this meal often was given to the lord it was a it was a meal offering a fine flour which of course again represents christ mingled with oil which we know is the holy spirit and that mingling was just a rubbing of oil on or with that with that flower and and we gone from that waving of the first fruits which you know christ was the first fruits to come to maturity uh that was way before the people knowing that that first fruit was just that it was only the first of many that were to come it was just the beginning of it it wasn't the whole thing it was just that one wave sheet one bundling but it was symbolic of what was to come it was a beginning it was a showing forth that as this wheat has reached its place of maturity and it's been offered back to god it's been way before the lord in acceptance that god would receive it to himself it was to show that there were there was more of this to come it's again i said it's sort of like the the application sort of not exactly but sora like the application of tithing where you know you give unto the lord you give god thanks for what god has done and you give it to the lord and the priest receives that and waves it on behalf of the people before the lord knowing thank god that there's going to be more to come amen right do you see the blessings that god gives there is the same thing scripturally it's the blessings that god gives when it's way before the lord is simply showing there's more coming so as this first jesus christ reached that place or was at that place of maturity we know that you say well he was god well of course he was god but the hebrews tells us that he learned obedience through the things which he suffered so if he is a human in flesh learned then how about us he was perfect done no wrong made no mistake sin uh had no sin and yet he learned well what about us see but what it's showing is this first wave sheath is showing is that jesus christ our high priest that came to that place of maturity and was waived as an offering as an offering for us that there were more to come behind it more not just more people but more that reach that place of maturity just like he did amen get to the exact same place that he was when he was offered that was the whole point so behind him was going to be us there was going to be a bride that through the indwelling presence of the holy spirit which is the next feast the indwelling of the holy spirit which is the next wave loaf was the next feast was going to be the indwelling presence of god that was going to change us uh into being like him that we were going to be able to come to maturity just as he came to maturity we were going to be like him because in the next verse the oil wasn't just with the flower the oil by the power of the fire was baked into the flower and the flower and the oil became one yes and when they became one it was symbolic of the holy spirit coming in us christ in us becoming one yes us becoming one with him bringing us to that place of offering that this bride is to come or be at that place of maturity just like he was we are to so much reflect jesus christ that there should be a time that we that people mistake us for him yes people make a big thing out of people praying to brother branham and baptizing him in his name and calling him god and all these things and worshiping brother branham but you know what friend it's just a carnal interp interpretation of the spiritual revelations all it is because the fact of it is every one of us should be able to get to that place every one of us should are going to get to that place of maturity now his gift before the lord was a little different than our gift but as far as the spiritual application of our lives to him we will get to that place too that was just a symbolic nature of it the word people said that well that was carnal obviously and that's not right to worship brother brown we know that brother branham wasn't god brother branham was not my savior he was sinner saved by the grace of god just like i am but in our day the first one to come to that place of maturity there were people confused even today 60 years later almost people still look back and have confusion between god and brother branham jesus christ and brother brown friend you know i don't want people to worship me i don't want anybody to baptize in my name but i would so like for people to mistake me for jesus amen but see my point is that's the point of this feast that we type it of course into the spiritual to the bride for this now it's just a feast for them that they were giving back to the lord god received it of them but it became a greater remember the law wasn't done away with it was magnified the law wasn't uh amplified to the place that we that it is a law to us but what he's done is it has become a part of who we are uh we live the word because we because that's what we are that's what we do because it's who we are and it just shows that the two become one so much so that that you can't tell them apart you can't separate them uh like i said last week you may have if you are inclined to or able to have taken the mingling of the oil with the fine flour and separated them again at some point but once the holy ghost and fire comes and bakes that holy spirit into you and the two of you become one there is no separating at that point right you are one that's why the bible says that you are sealed until your destination and this is not our destination friend right yes amen florida is not our destination arizona is not our destination new york city chicago la those are not another country russia japan those are not our deaths our destination is in heaven yes and you are sealed until your destination yeah praise the lord so god as he has shown to us that perfection of the cro of christ and the bride becoming one it was just symbolic to them in leviticus 23. it was just something that god was giving them that was making it a feast time of acceptance by the lord remember all the lord give even from the time that god killed the sheepskin and thrown to adam and eve was nothing but provisional ways that god was making so he would accept the people if they did what he said to do in obedience to his word that's what it was it's the same as obedience today but in a different way now we obey it because it's his word to us through his spirit that makes us like him we become more like him than we become like him yes hopefully the fifth wave chief wave won't be any different than the first right the tenth sheep to come maturity won't be any different than the first the first age was to not be any different than the first the waving the second age third age fourth fifth sixth seventh into this bright age for the bride today isn't to be any different actually supposed to be more like him than ever this age is supposed to reflect jesus christ more today than any age ever has from the first church of course obviously they wrote a book of ads from that time to this time was never to be but it is now and we are a part of it yes god has given us that time god has put us in this age he's put us in this place for that reason amen so that we reflect him and who he is now from the wave sheath to the wave loaf now the wave loaf we remember was the 50 days from the wave sheath to the way below 50 days typifying pentecost which so we uh call this wave loaf the fourth feast the feast of pentecost or a pentecostal feeds as 50 represents pentecost pentecost as we read last week acts chapter 2 verses 1 and 2 3 through 4 i believe it was where the holy spirit came down when they were all in the upper room and he filled all the house where they were sitting and the holy spirit came and sat upon each of them representing the third feast the wave sheep where the oil was mingled with the flower and then the next verse the conjunction says and which is a conjunction we know what a conjunction is correct and is a conjunction it's actually grammatically inaccurate to start a sentence with a conjunction but it doesn't matter it's the bible uh but it says and that's the first word it's a conjunction what's it doing it's conjoining the previous statement with the next statement the previous statement says it is sat upon each of them and joining with that and it went into each one of them the fulfillment of christ taken resident in his people the holy spirit and fire coming and burning out the old nature and taking permanent resident of your soul jesus christ among amen praise the lord on them and in them that's from the third to the fourth feast the waving of the sheep where they're least loosely bound together by one common thread to a baking together to where there is no separating but between christ and his bride let's just say it that way there's no separating they're one they become one and they will be one forever till their destination friend as long as this earth is we will be with him praise the lord now that's at that pentecost the pentecostal feast now from that pentecostal feast we talked about there was a long period of time a long period of time between the fourth feast and the fifth feast now the first two feasts give us months and days third and fourth do not but the fifth and sixth do so what are we looking at there that long period of time between the feast of pentecost the feast of the way blow offering unto the feast of trumpets which again is the 23rd verse that we started at so from that time to this time was a long period of time now the first two was one day we don't know exactly from the third to the fourth or from the second to the third or third to the fourth well we we don't know the second or third we do know the third to the fourth that's 50 days uh but from there from that fourth to the fifth the time period is a long you got short time period in the first to the fourth now you've got a long time period between the fourth and the fifth to the seventh month to be exact now let's see what brother branham says in the feast of the trumpets remember i asked see if you wanted to go home and try to listen to that tape this week maybe you did maybe you didn't if you had a chance then uh be a little more informative to you uh again the feast of the trumpets if you haven't or if you're going to just like i said take your time with this one uh if this is not like one of the prayer line meetings where brother brown just takes a scripture and just kind of gives an exhortation and some uh uh some story lines this is this is this is some serious uh ribeye steak here right here so you really gotta take your time and and digest this uh and and go through this feast of trump just take some notes write it down if you can but really go through it because uh i i've listened to it over and over and over again and uh the things that brother branham puts in here is is uh very specific so it's good to listen to but just take your time with it if you do hope you do notice now quickly this is the quote now quickly revelation 9 under the seventh trumpet their king is from the bottomless pits in leviticus now how perfect the interpretation here is with the word because see immediately following the pentecostal jubilee followed the day of atonement but now we haven't got to the the trumpets to the atonement yet amen which he's talking about immediate from those trumpets to that atonement was uh was a very short period of time but we haven't got that yet we'll come back to that the order of the feast time between the pentecostal feasts to the uh to the sounding of the trumpets uh for the atonement which was to bring the atonement from the from the pentecostal feast to the trump feast of the trumpets was a long period of time look there was a long period of time between the pentecostal feast and the feast of the trumpets to be sound a long period of time brother adam says frankly it was 50 days from one of the feasts of pentecost to the feast of the atonement was 50 days or the atonement came after the trumpets he keeps saying atonement but the atonement comes directly after the trumpets so when you hear brother random say atonement that's what he's talking about okay because the trumpets were merely like we talked about last week the trumpets were merely a sound that was led forth that signified to israel even back through the old testament the trumpet sounding we went kind of through this a little bit when we did the rapture message uh was sounding forth that's something to israel so that they know that there's an event going on and what to do about it it was to bring them together into a gathering to bring them from scattered around to one central location now it was applied in the old testament of something as simple as uh going to war uh we have the watchmen watching and they see the enemy approaching so they blow a trumpet a certain sound a specific sound of that trumpet to let them know it's time to gather together and prepare yourself for battle that's what the trumpet was that's just one one uh example of it was to let them know the enemy's coming gather yourself together and get prepared for battle well these trumpets was sent forth and sounded to bring israel together and fly them from the disbursement of all around the world back to their homeland again amen well god the atonement would have never happened for the jews had not they come from scattered around the world back to their homeland amen remember god only blesses israel when they're in their homeland god only deals with israel when they're in their homeland so if there was ever to come an atonement which is the sixth feast which immediately follows the trumpets the atonement for there to be an atonement they had to be in their homeland so the fifth feast the feast of the trumpets had to sound to bring israel back together again brother brahm talks about those trumpets as being uh mussolini and hitler and stalin and all those that persecuted the jews that caused the jews to go back home they were being persecuted we know all about the holocaust and uh and what took place here and many of the jews went in through the holocaust of many of them got out of there left germany left russia left from the places they had been dispersed to to go back home to be in their homeland because the 144 000 that god is to call out of this had to be there before the atonement could ever take place before god would ever even deal with them again yes before god would ever even speak to them again yes before god would ever try to even bless them again they had to be home that's why brother branham keeps talking about atonement between the pentecost to atonement well he's kind of skipping the trumpets but it's basically the trumpets brought about the atonement we'll go into that a little more in a little bit but frankly he says now 50 days 50 days from the pentecost feast of pentecost to the feast of atonement or the trumpets was 50 days now 50 days is exactly seven sabbaths with seven sabbaths is what 49 7 times 7 is 49 should ask joel that you would know that would you 7 times 7 49 50 is the one extra day what again is that that is the rolling over into the new day right the eighth day the beginning of the week again typifying that when christ was to come all the shadows and tights and new moons and and stars and sabbaths were going to be done away with we were entering into a new day amen people fighting fussing scampering everything over uh well should we worship on saturday or should we work for worship on sunday saturday's the sabbath well if you want to keep the sabbath you go right in back into the law again i don't keep a sabbath the sabbath to me is every day of my life because i've entered into a new day by the scripture by the word through jesus christ who came and gave his life and and now lives in me now every day is the sabbath we just honor his resurrection and our new beginning of this week on a sunday because that's when he raised amen not saturday not sunday people can fight those battles all they want friend but we're resting now those battles are over we know who we are and we know who we are in jesus christ amen 50 days now 49th plus the day that's 50 days your brother graham says now exactly seven sabbaths and seven sabbaths is the seven church ages the seven church ages get it he sees now he said now the jews had been blinded waiting all this time while the pentecostal first fruits has been poured out upon the church upon the bride these seven church ages seven sabbaths between the waving of the loaf or the feast of pentecost there's been seven sabbaths seven church ages typifying seven church ages from the first church age to our age today that god has been dealing with the gentile the jews were blinded not to see it right they were not to see it we'll go to into romans here uh maybe next week whatever time that it plays out in the scripture we'll go and we'll look at that probably next week uh that that god that the israel was blinded we talked about the blindness of israel yes amen and how they could not see the messiah they did not see it their eyes were their eyes were keen on something else and they did not see it amen so they were blinded to the messiah they were blinded to jesus christ we know that uh ezekiel or zechariah excuse me zechariah 13 there would be a a period of time that would be a fountain open for the house of david well that fountain started with jesus christ but they rejected him the jews rejected him so he left from the jews and he came to the gentiles and now for 2 000 years for seven sabbaths for seven church ages god has been dealing with the gentiles and getting his gentile bride together and we're at the end of that time yes we're at the end of the time of god gathering the gentile bride together all the while israel's been in their homeland or they've been they've been uh uh going about living as as they did through the entire old testament uh being the same as they were basically the the daily oblation quit because the overrunning of the temple but their feasts and new moons and all they continue on that all this they do amen because that's that's what they believe they did not see the messiah they did not know jesus christ was this messiah they were blinded to it so they've been going on like they've been going all the while god's been with the gentiles the spirit of god the anointing has been with the gentile pride and he's been calling a gentile bride out of every church age yes unto this age and god is still dealing with the gentile bride although like we said last week that spirit is lifting off the gentiles you can feel it i talked about the services i was in when i was a kid those are services my grandchildren never see because we're not in that day we're not in that time anymore they won't see those services once in a while or or actually most sundays we have a really powerful moving of the lord here but it's not like just not quite like it was then but god is still dealing with us you say well brother newton how we know when god's done dealing with the gentiles we'll be home that's how you know amen when we go home when we go to the wedding suffer god the anointing goes fully back over to the jews again and starts dealing with them now because why they're in their homeland because of the fifth feast let's read it the fifth feast starts at the 23rd verse leviticus 23 23 and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month the first day of the seventh month um which i believe is october because again remember their first month is april so their seventh month i believe it's october uh it's the seventh month the first day of that seventh month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of a blowing of trumpets unholy convocation you shall do no several work therein but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord now again remember what was that trump what were those trumpets to do it was to gather dispersed israel back to their homeland again now all seven of the of the of the feast of trumpets was blown under our sixth seal now remember our sixth seal is what judgment tribulation where we got to last week in our understanding has the sixth seal began or has it not see that that was something i posed to you last week and my question was then do you believe that judgment is on the land today and i believe all of us believe that people get wonkas with you say the sick seal they get all crazy and because it messes people up they without a revelation you talk about the seals and and people in the message some people just they just ignore you don't want to talk about it all and some people you'll spend the next four hours if you just start one word on them and they'll give you abs their revelation of it from beginning to ending if it ever even has an end but really it's not that complicated it was open it was revealed to a prophet to bring a revelation of that word on tape on book for a bride especially for this last day so that we could recognize and understand from the first church age even from pentecost down to the church ages the advices of the enemy remember cause what is the main theme of each seal a horse rider yes well that horse rider is not jesus that horse rider is satan most of the church world believes that those horse riders the white red black they believed that was jesus but it well he said well he was on a white horse well yeah he was a hypocrite he was trying to produce or save with something he's not he's trying to pretend remember satan can can uh copy everything that jesus does except creation which is following the word he cannot keep that word word by word and the word is creation he cannot create that's why god has given that into the hands of the bride yes amen what did he say you could speak name say do what you want say this say that but you do it with the power of the anointing of the spirit of god and not by your own self do you do it by your own self things would be a mess if i tried to do it by my own it would be a mess friend because my mind would go off my human emotion too many times instead of the will of god yeah so god is we have that power but we have it only by the authority of his spirit we have we have that based on what god has given us for this last day the thing that satan cannot do so yeah he can copy him he could be on a white horse he could be on a red horse he could be on a whatever horse but we know that that horse rider is satan so the main theme of each seal was simply the horse rider amen this is just god unveiling to us so that we look back and see what the tactics of the enemy have been all the way through what he's doing today what he's going to continue to do we know the devices of the enemy there's no secret to us he can't do anything to us that we don't already know that he does as his tactics because we he's been exposed all of satan all of hell all of his tactics everything is all been exposed yes to the bride by revelation god has exposed that so that we see it so now you see that sixth seal yes that judgment so we'll say sixth seal all right just ask you do you believe judgment has been unleashed i believe every one of us will say absolutely well that's what the sixth deal is the sixth seal is judgment it ends in tribulation but the sixth seal is judgment which leads to the tribulation the tribulation is simply the finalization of it all the tribulation is what ends it completes it amen well that sixth seal in this church age which began in 1906 uh i believe i don't have the book with me i believe this church age 1906 from that time each of those seven trumpets have sounded for the jews in this period each of those seven trumpets has sealed the seven trumpets for the jews has sounded under our sixth seal we know the seven seals coming of the lord but those six seals of that sixth seal those seven trumpets under that sixth seal that judgment period god is taking oh listen now god is taking the jews out of that because he's sounding their trumpets to bring them to their homeland to give them a time of atonement which is the sixth they're they're six feasts their fifth feast sounding of the trumpet was to bring them to their homeland so god could unveil the sixth feast to them which is the feast of atonement listen 26th verse and the lord's speaking to moses saying also on the 10th day of this seventh month now notice this is winding up just like it began you had a quick atonement the day after the atonement is fellowship praise the lord now the day after the the trumpets are not the day after but very shortly after five days exactly or ten days what did we say here ten days because the feast of the trumpets was the first day of the seventh month the feast of atonement is the tenth day of the seventh month ten days later basically immediately right after the jews there is a period of time notice though there is a period of time that period of time to me saints from the time that that happens to the time the atonement actually begins because the atonement cannot begin until the bride the gentile bride is gone okay listen to me close now the trumpets have sounded to bring dispersed israel back to their homeland under the sixth seal yes the talmud however cannot happen for the jews until the bride is gone home because that's when the anointing goes back to the jews and god begins to deal with them and they recognize that they crucified their messiah that's why brother branham told billy paul billy if you ever seen the daily oblation of the jews back instituted again you'll know you miss the rapture because god will not deal with the jews in that capacity anymore until the gentile bride is gone god the anointing will not bring them to the point of beginning that that's why you hear so much about the red heifer and and these messages that people preach and talk about because they know the times and the seasons friend i don't i i remember years ago this red heifer that was coming up in israel oh that was gonna be the one 30 years ago we don't know we know it's going to be but we don't are the witnesses there are they not i don't know the the witnesses of revelation 11 have to be born they have to raise they have to be grown they have to be older men are they there now they probably are but i don't know is that heifer been born is it the perfect heifer for their beginning their daily sacrifice i maybe probably i don't know but i don't venture to try to guess on those things not anymore i have in the past years ago i have but i don't know that's up to god all i know is what the scripture says and the scripture says the trumpets were to bring israel together and that was under our sixth seal so judgment has began we know we can see judgment on the world today and and shall i say um i first of all want to honor 9 11. but i want to which i was going to do at the end but i didn't want to forget that but i also want to acknowledge the passing of the queen of england yes you may not think and i honestly i couldn't care less uh it's not something that has ever captivated my attention about the royal family but i do believe there's very sign very much of significance to our passing uh if it's nothing more than a passing of an old order into an ushering in of a new order i don't know but there's there's because i'm not a prophet but there's i can in my little p brain see the significance of of someone of that statue for 70 years uh now in one of the most influential countries in the world now gone what happens next oh charles was taking over well that doesn't mean anything uh his two sons are fighting like cats and dogs so i you know who knows but we do know that there's a shifting going on is it ushering in something that that that we see scripturally but we might not conceive this out here i don't know if i was a prophet i tell you i'll tell you one thing though if the lord reveals it to me i'll tell you i promise you that it's a report if the lord reveals something like that to you let me know amen i'll see if it fits scripturally and we'll see but i don't know but i do believe there's some spiritual significance to that but the sounding of the trumpets was to bring her back together sixth seal but now the atonement which immediately follows but notice there is a period of time there's 10 days so there is a period of time to where israel is in their homeland they got their own flag you hear what i'm saying they got their own flag they got their own currency they are part of the what was the league of nations now i guess united nations they're recognized by the world as a country for the first time since david since they were uh 2000 for 2 000 years not david since christ for 2 000 years now they have their own flag six-point sergeant david had their own currency acknowledged worldwide as a nation they are the nation of israel and they have been for how long 70 years 60 years i lose track but it's been many years but remember there's a period of time between the trumpets blowing and bringing them back together before the atonement takes place what's god doing during that period of time he's doing the same thing that he did what we preached on a couple of weeks ago just like he did with noah god made up his mind what he was going to do he told his son what he was going to do and gave him instruction for 120 years that man noah fulfilled that that instruction and built an ark he got on the ark when god told him to god shuts the door seven more days nothing no rain no judgment seven more days they sat there on the ark with no rain i mean could you imagine the scoffers today yeah if they got on that boat and you said daddy you told me now we've been here for five six days smelling the the stink of these animals when is that gonna rain are you sure you heard from god are you sure you heard the right voice you sure you weren't you know dreaming some thinking something you never know there's golfers of all kinds and i say that because people do the same thing today yeah amen because they're not on god's time schedule they're on their own time schedule friend we can't be on our own time schedule because our time schedule is not in line with god's time schedule we have to get in line with his time schedule and when he says yes you can bank it friends because it's done yes when i say yes well maybe maybe not probably not but i'm not relying on me i'm not relying on you i'm not relying on somebody that claims to be a prophet i'm relying on god's word and the vindicated prophet for this day and when god says it that settles it it's done at that point i'm finished we know that it's done so there's that period of time just like that period of time just like this period of time just like our period of time right now we're in that period of time in my opinion now i'm not saying when but in my opinion we are in that period of time and we're getting ready to go home and as soon as we go home that 10 days there's that atonement the atonement that god makes with his own people who were who were once blinded but now they can see now i'm going to read through it uh this feast of atonement the sixth feast but i'm not going to get into great detail with it because again i want to do that next week that's probably a whole other service so lord willing we'll do that next week but now feast of atonement now let's lay the groundwork really quick one more time feast of atonement follows immediately after or ten days after the feast of the trumpets which brought israel back together which was at the end of the gentile dispensation okay so that now the bride is in its ark uh in the ark waiting time basically when we're getting ready to go home to go to the marriage supper of the lamb and at the time that the bride leaves the full anointing of christ the holy spirit goes back to the jews and god deals with the jews and this feast of atonement sets in crosses over from feasts of trumpets to feast of atonement when the feast of atonement sets into the jews then god begins to reveal himself to them people and they recognize they crucify their messiah amen now what is atonement atonement is to atone for something when you try to atone for something you did wrong you try to make amends you apologize you restore make reparations of some kind you restore back because you want to make an atonement for something you personally did wrong if i uh uh if if in my previous life i'll just say i stole ten dollars from somebody and god put it on my heart i'd know that person or go to apologize getting that ten dollars maybe give twenty dollars to atone for what i had done wrong i wanna make right what i had done wrong what did they do wrong they didn't see recognize their messiah so because they didn't they crucified him and they screamed let his blood be on us and on our children i mean you would think that was that was a sin that would be unatonable it's a sin today that a lot of people would say oh that person did something i could never forgive them i could never forgive somebody of that then you won't be forgiven either for the things you've done right if you can't forgive you can't be forgiven so this falls into that position this falls into that place notice so when when this happens and they recognize they had killed their messiah their eyes open and they see it there's an atonement made they make atonement for what they've done wrong they try to atone for the mistakes they had made in whatever capacity that is acceptable to the lord and again we'll talk about next week is acceptable to the lord is what they have to atone for amen remember in the garden of eden what was the atonement in the garden to be first of all there's repentance there's apology i'm sorry which unfortunately a lot of people don't seem to know how to say anymore it seems like the two hardest the four hardest words to say are grouped in twos i'm sorry and i was wrong that's three words i'm sorry and i was wrong those are five words people don't seem to know today but it's still true anyway because they're still all human yeah there's a nice sorry there's an apology and an atonement made what was the atonement made for them in the garden of eden god took the sheep he killed the two lambs who had to pay the price for what they had done wrong and threw the sheepskin out to adam and eve there had to be an atonement made there has to be an atonement here to make up for what they did wrong when they crucified their messiah they didn't see him now blinding now let's read it so as that said we recognize we're entering into this this atonement scripturally the bride is gone jesus as the marriage suffered lamb and the lord speaking to moses saying also on the tenth day of this month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be in holy convocation unto you and ye shall afflict your souls afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the lord while they have to flee their souls because of the wrong they had done make it right and you shall do no work in that same day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the lord your god for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among the people so the atonement has to be recognized by god among his people if it's not those people get cut off but we know there's only 144 000 anyway right and whatsoever so it be that doeth any work in that same day the same soul will i destroy from among his people you shall do matter no manner of work it shall be a a statue forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings it shall be to you a sabbath of rest and ye shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the of the month at even from even until from even unto even shall ye celebrate your sabbath now there's one more thing i want to bring out here that i want to type with the gentiles and and then we'll close because the next thing basically takes us over to daniel 9 which puts us into the seven-fold vision of gabriel to daniel that is your not homework for this week if you want to listen daniel 70 weeks or day or or or specifically gabriel's six-fold vision to daniel gabriel six full vision to daniel and we'll be here with what we're gonna talk about next week starting daniel 9 24. but i want one i want to bring forth one more thing uh that before i close here now we notice as the feast of the trumpets to the feast of the atonement is a very short period of time 10 days it's basically immediately following week and a half after the trump uh a trumpets to the from the trumpet to the atonement very short period of time so we notice that this long period of time that god deals with the gentiles it's been two thousand years seven sabbaths seven church ages that that from the time that god turned uh they crucified christ to the time that we're living in now is that long period of time so you had the first feast you had a you had a day of redemption then a day of fellowship those followed immediately after that you had that wave offering of the one that came to maturity not just to talk uh not just redemption not just fellowship but you have uh a a a completion of coming to maturity then you have a baking in of the two becoming one through the wave offering then you've got a bringing together the feast of the trumpets and sounding them all in together those first few are bam bam god does immediately quick works but then all of a sudden you've got this long period of time that the jews have gone along the way they've gone for the past two thousand years as god's dealt with the gentiles that's going along but i want you to know something at the end of this time from the time that god's calling his jews his people back to their homeland to the atonement is a very quick work yes god does a very quick powerful work right there for the jews right all together after this long period of time god doesn't waste any more time he calls them together and he gives the atonement the atonement takes place in that very short period of time god does a quick powerful work right then what did brother branham say that god was going to do for the gentile bride at the end of our dispensation amen he said this bride will do a quick powerful work at the end everybody's waiting waiting waiting looking people get all confused people get ahead of themselves people try to push things forward well it's now it's going to be here and try to make things happen that aren't there uh it may be a right thing but a wrong time and trying to do all these things and we're waiting and waiting and waiting but when it comes to that time friend there's a quick powerful work that this bride is going to do now people say it's going to take a great persecution to bring that uh the bride's going to have to be in concentration camps and things like that and i personally don't believe that i know what brother graham said about it i also know brother graham said god doesn't put his wife through a bunch of punishment once he marries her he said what man says i do and loves his wife so much he would uh reject every other woman in the world to take this woman and say i do and take her home and beat her into a pole well god doesn't do that either a man now some reprobate might do something like that but a man doesn't do that he loves that woman he's gonna he's gonna be more affectionate with her after the wedding than he ever has been before he's not gonna take her and beat her up well i don't think god does that to his bride either god didn't marry this gentile bride just to take her and beat her around a while he's going to protect her he's going to keep her watch over her amen now if people think there's i'm not saying there's not a persecution i'm not saying there's not going to be some pressure but i'm not saying it's but i'm saying is in my opinion it's not going to be to the degree that a lot of people say that it is and a lot of ministers i've heard preach that it is i really don't but but it will be what it needs to be to bring this bride to the place of rapturing faith rapturing faith doesn't come from pressure friends rapturing faith comes by preaching the pure unadulterated word faith comes by hearing and hearing the word not from pressure all pressure does is force people into doing things god doesn't force people into doing things we do it he he brings us along to where in our hearts we desire to do things and we live the way we live and we do the things we do because we want to because we love him because we want to please him not because he's going to beat us to a pope not because he forces us to do something no because we want to because we love him and faith just like rapturing faith comes by preaching and hearing the pure unadulterated word of god that's where faith comes from and if a rapture is going to take faith like we've never had before then where is it going to come from it's not going to come from pressure it's not going to come from persecution it's going to come because of the of the pure unadulterated word the hearing of that pure word is what's going to bring the faith amen now i'm not negating there might be a little pressure and i'm not saying that there really already is i mean even in this religious loving country this country if you look at the the the hierarchy and the overwhelming things going on in the entertainment sports and things in this world they hold up the the muslims and hindus more than they do the christians now you're the hated and persecuted group many times over there is a persecution already going on around the world and that's another thing we can't forget friend this bride is not just in this room right god's bride is not just in tucson or arizona this bride is not just in the united states god's bride is international and a part of god's bride portions of god's bride are going through serious persecution right now religiously physically persecuted because they believe this message because they believe christ they're being persecuted right now right well if they're part of this body aren't we all a part of the same body so we can't forget that either yeah the bride internationally is going through some persecution amen it's getting worse in this country it will continue to get worse how much i don't know but i know that faith rapturing faith will come because of the word hearing of the word not through persecution not through pressure any of those things be some sure but i i again to to the degree that a lot of people say i don't know but it's going to be for this gentile bride just like the jews it will be a quick and powerful work at this last time it'll be a quick work friend this bride will do a quick and powerful work and then she's gone yes amen well that quick powerful beat during that time where the dead and christ are here for that 40 minimum 40 days or minutes and 30 days are here and we're all together will that be that time i don't know i know that brittle graham said there will be that time so i believe there will be that time and the scriptural precedent to show us that that is scriptural not just something brother branham said their scriptural precedent to back up that claimed of that quick powerful work he's going to do it for us we're going home then he's doing it for the jews and then they go home praise the lord amen amen and at the end of the wedding supper marriage up to the lamb christ leaves he slips out from from the supper and he goes and reveals himself to the jews and they said where'd you get those scars in the house of my friends yes amen then they're gone too and uh then we go to a millennium and gog and magog and the white throne judgment and into eternity praise the lord amen that's where we're headed friends that is our new big that is our real new beginning it's when eternity sets in praise the lord that true eighth day amen will begin that time that god give us amen let's stand if we could amen lord willing then we'll uh we'll get to that place that atonement the atonement will the atonement generally as we know deals with the jews but it will be uh there will be uh there are types in there that helps us to see what it what it means to us as gentiles too amen that atonement what god does for them see god god is no respecter of a person those are his people but he doesn't respect him any more than he does over us or vice a person there's no respect more for the gentiles over the jews either he's no respecter of person he holds one over the other does not hold one over the other so as he does for one uh we see as he typically does for the other amen praise the lord let's see this little course amen if i can find it we probably all know it anyway i know it i just usually like to find it to give you a penis number more of you 617. i thought i knew about where it was more of you just a chorus here how many m how many wants more of him today though and i say amen we want more of him more than i've ever had praise the lord let's sing it to him won't be on the screen so if you don't know what you get the book 617 sing the chorus [Music] i've had it all but what i need is i've had my fears [Music] hear my prayer for more [Music] i need more of you [Music] i've had it all but what i need is [Music] [Music] lord hear my prayer for more time him now [Music] i've had it all but what i mean is [Music] [Music] amen amen praise the lord jesus oh god would you grant that for us here today and will all each and every one of us have more of you yes amen i pray that when we leave out of here today we can testify we have had more of him now than when we came in the door yes amen yes lord that's the whole point that's the whole reason the whole purpose god let it be each one of us today [Music] amen praise the lord i love his word his words are beautiful his word is so perfect his word is so holy his word is so bright you know from genesis 1 to revelation 22 it just doesn't change amen people may look at it and think it changes they may think it alters here there contradicts here there it is so beautifully perfect no way that men from that many generations over that span of time can write such a perfect word that fits so perfectly together without a divine being instrumenting it no way amen i like what brother green used to say it said thinking about the big bang is like thinking you could throw a stick of dynamite in the print shop come out with this bible [Music] i like that that's the truth take a stick of dynamite throw at the print shop and come out with this bible that's about the equivalent of what they consider the big bang amen you ever thought about that a human being what we're made of and all the i don't give us it just blows my mind amen this blows my mind god is so good isn't he amen god bless you appreciate you love you thank you for your prayers my flight was late i'll just give you a brief synopsis i was instructed not to give you the whole course i'll give you a brief synopsis i left here uh me and my wife when we had dinner cracker i went up to phoenix my flight was delayed from seven ish to nine he already knew i was gonna get in late so i was supposed to get there midnight get to the hotel about one uh well the flight didn't leave did we didn't start boarding until about nine the plane was coming from dallas wasn't there um we were leaving at nine o'clock and we got on the plane and everybody was set and ready to go we got almost to the to the runway and he stops and i'm sitting here thinking what is he stopping for he had a plane stop all the time on the runway but not in this particular area and there's no movement nothing going on like what why is he seeing he sat there for five minutes or ten minutes why is he stopped and all of a sudden he comes on the intercom and says there's a problem with one of the passenger manifests or something we gotta turn around and go back to the gate so he turned around after already being delayed first time i've been on a plane a pilot literally did this made a u-turn i've had him do this stuff he literally turned his wheels and we did this and went straight back to the gate it was ten o'clock before we actually left it was three o'clock before i got to minneapolis and it was 4 30 by the time i got to bed i had to get up at 6. so i got about an hour's sleep and i tell you that not to have sympathy but to thank you for your prayers because i woke up an hour after i went in fact my boss who usually gets he says at 4 30 every morning i told him i said you were awake before i even got to bed um one hour monday was a perfect day i wasn't tired i wasn't struggling i was i didn't fall asleep i wasn't falling over i did a whole full 12-hour physical work day and the lord blessed me i got to the end of the day i even got something to eat told him i said i had i have a date with the inside of my eyelids now i went to bed a little earlier i i i bucked up and got me taco bell because it was the closest thing uh not my favorite thing however but it was the quickest easiest closest got it and i did get to bed a little earlier uh than i normally do but my point in saying that again was thank you for your prayers because like we said god could take four hours into eight he took one and made it eight or more because i got one hour's sleep monday morning before i had to get up and go to work and then coming in uh last night or friday night uh we worked really late really hard my arm was about to fall off and we had to drive back to the airport it was like an hour didn't get to the

was so faithful and he knew it by heart but i just i don't i never have i doubt that i will so thank you for letting me know that i appreciate it amen but god is being good and friday was 61 degrees so it was so nice to work in rained all day so it was really nice to work in but it was pretty rough so but i thank the lord his goodness in being back home with you and remember now next not next time but the sunday after that's kind of how this worked out thank the lord i didn't work it out that way but that's how he worked it out to uh finish that part of it uh next sunday and then the following sunday brother neil johnson noel johnson is going to be with us so please keep that that's the 25th of september that noel will be here so keep that in prayer if you will he's supposed to be with us the 25th and the 16th of october so please remember to keep those in your prayers keep him in your prayers as well for the end of that and remember i haven't said much about it but i do i do feel a lot in my heart for the family it's been 21 years since 9 11. uh i i'm sure it's one of those days where all of us can probably remember who we were when we first heard about it um i know that we were in the chapel at the tabernacle upstairs it was the first year of the school we had just started the school and i was having bible lessons in the morning and rich giaverdi came in and told us about it when all the kids were sitting there that's first i heard that's when i first heard about it a lot a lot of lives were lost that day and a lot of people still suffering from that uh still people i think sick or cancer whatever from breathing stuff and it's uh it was so the death toll has been way more than 3 000 actually it's been in multiple thousands beyond that i couldn't even begin to say but please remember those families and people that lost those loved ones also and i'm sorry that i didn't mention this but brother dave williamson wanted me to mention to each one of you to pray for a lady named grace in north carolina she had a severe friend of his name grace in charlotte in north carolina had a severe stroke and he did he text me while we were in service on updates and she was she was put in an induced coma she was taken off the ventilator and the propofol which is the sedation drug she is opening her eyes she has not uh she's not yet sorry this is small uh she's not yet talking which is normal so today is a good day prayers are being answered so let's hope each day going forward it's a good day for her continue sending prayers her way it's working and patrick i guess i mean that's her husband i don't know appreciates it tremendously so i'm giving you an update before i even ask you to pray but her name is grace she had a severe stroke and uh he covered our prayers for that so remember that prayer if you would as well anyone else have anything then for we're dismissed yes on the on the news the passing of the queen and the new king i noticed that one person followed up god bless the king god bless our kingdom amen praise the lord i don't know she was quite the woman she had quite a uh all i know about her uh she held a standard serious standard for that for those people and i'm sorry but i'm just afraid the man that's in there now is not going to right he says he'll be fidelity to his nation but he wasn't even that way to his wife so i don't know how it's going to work but anyway that's something else but it's a new yeah exactly and we'll see where the lord takes it from here amen i don't know if you've yeah i mean i christian not i don't know obviously the way she looked and all but hey that's you know as old as she is she could have been from another age too we don't know but i just know that all of my life and and they probably held it close to the vest i'm sure but i never heard one bad thing about her and and all you know how tabloid is and everything but that she really held a standard for those people to look up to she was she was a ladies lady yes when there was a prophecy that she was going to go and that she was ready now and that the lord was going to take her and then and then the lord took her you know within a short period of time and then um and i think it's also the watching this time this new beginning and and with rosh hashanah that the people are then now they have this new king it's a new beginning here as well and that and that she was and the lord said she's ready now to go and that's what he told the problem she's ready now so she's been sick for a while if all of you hear of it i don't follow it again but it's in my news feed she'd been sick there was stuff that had to cancel months ago because she was really sick and they thought she was going to go then this was several months ago so i i wasn't completely surprised 96 i mean people say i was surprised she's 96 and you were surprised uh it's been sick for months but anyway so accolades to her amen so i'm not gonna call her godly woman but she held a standard of morals um so anyway but praise the lord so god reaches that should appreciate each one of you come and be here lord willing next sunday did you have something yes i wanted to have this you know you try to think of when you're speaking and testifying um all the vets had bookings too we can get them in december we can get them in january so when i called the arizona humane she says we're booked to uh december then she goes wait we just have one cancelled you see god's in it amen well you know he makes away another thing which it startled i didn't see it and we know what brother brown said about tuesday wednesday over tuesday in the morning there was some lights that appeared and the new stations were flooded with calls and we know bill graham says investigating judgment oh yeah yeah i didn't see it i just know like you said brother it's close and it's time to gear up and get serious in our walk amen amen yes praise the lord absolutely true absolutely true amen lord bless you again uh appreciate you loving you amen we'll be dismissing the word prayer believe this would you dismiss us lord jesus we bow our hearts and heads in unison of the faith of your precious word the word that we heard father is it's just scripture being fulfilled your bible is being fulfilled before our very eyes and lord i i saw that when revelation comes forth the devil doesn't like it and how many kids today were just restless and going back and forth we need to interpret and understand how the enemy works we need to strive to be more diligent in our walk with you yes you're a rewarder of them to diligently seek you and lord it's time to buckle up and and put you first how i heard your prophets say earlier this week there's a famine in the land not necessarily for food but for um for the preaching of the true word of god amen and how many of us are really not concerned and we don't bother hearing tapes and reading our bibles and praying and even becoming a church father and and just doing what's right in obedience to your words i heard your prophet say father it's not the big things we do for god it's the little things we leave undone and this is not a time just to come and warm a sea it's a time to to be steadfast in our faith to hear your word faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god and you even taught us when you defeated the enemy you spoke the word father it is written amen it is written and father you could have just spoken one word and put the devil out of existence once and for all but you showed us is we have to stand with your words we are a blessed people yes we have been called to the greatest message that you have sent forth in this day and hour that we live in a message where even paul even moses and all the prophets couldn't preach the completion of the revelation of your word and your pride for this hour it's christ in you the hope of glory oh father make it more real in our lives than ever before lord bless each and every one as we leave from one another and go our separate ways grant us traveling mercies be with us let us be a light in this hour of darkness uh let they let you truly be a lamb and to our feet a light into our pathway let us be a witness let us testify of the hope that lies within us jesus let us live our life daily 24 hours a day to seek your will and to ask lord what would you have your humble servant do for you yesterday in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen [Music] you
