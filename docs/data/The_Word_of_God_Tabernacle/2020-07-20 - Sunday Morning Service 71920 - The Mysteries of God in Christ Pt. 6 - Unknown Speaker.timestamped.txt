[0:02] hello everyone

[0:12] uh digging quite a couple of little
[0:14] details i didn't quite have in there and
[0:16] i had to do it two or three times and it
[0:18] finally then went through so uh my sim
[0:21] my apologies for that and uh
[0:24] putting urls in any just computer stuff
[0:27] is
[0:28] unless you know what you're doing it's
[0:30] kind of difficult to go with it but
[0:32] hopefully everybody's there hopefully
[0:34] everybody's okay hopefully everybody's
[0:36] got it streamed and lived and ready to
[0:37] go so

[1:05] so maybe we get past this point and i'm
[1:08] kind of taking just a couple of minutes
[1:10] here so that
[1:11] we get past this initial thing and
[1:13] hopefully everybody gets signed on so
[1:16] um if you don't maybe you can get the
[1:18] prayer requests and all of what we give
[1:20] maybe when it gets archived so but uh
[1:23] just trust us to be a blessing to you
[1:25] today
[1:25] i want to read a couple of prayer
[1:26] requests that we have that's been that's
[1:28] coming to us today
[1:30] um also first of all as i said to you
[1:34] yesterday
[1:35] i have not been able to verify yet to
[1:38] make sure that this is a valid request
[1:40] but we're going to we're going to
[1:42] pretend it's a valid request we're going
[1:44] to assume it's a valid request
[1:46] until i hear something otherwise that i
[1:49] got a
[1:50] email or a text from tabitha yesterday
[1:53] about brother donnie's daughter
[1:54] erica uh who has been diagnosed with
[1:58] liver cancer
[1:59] uh in the text said something about a
[2:02] couple of sets of twins which
[2:03] probably some of you may already know uh
[2:06] but
[2:07] cancer is usually not a very good thing
[2:10] um usually when it gets to the liver
[2:13] it's already been other places but we
[2:15] know a mighty god
[2:17] that is more than able to heal that is
[2:19] more unable to deliver
[2:20] and it can bring her through perfectly
[2:23] healed and well so we're just going to

[3:53] in prayer that the lord helps continue
[3:55] to provide their jobs for them

[4:14] requests to prayer
[4:16] um i know there was a prayer request or
[4:19] two i think i
[4:21] missed last week i hope i didn't miss
[4:22] any of this week but
[4:24] uh god knows our requests if anything's
[4:27] on your heart or anything you know of
[4:28] please just remember that in prayer we
[4:30] want to continue to remember
[4:32] uh sister priscilla and her family are
[4:34] mother and family sister in prayer
[4:36] brothers the lord would just continue to
[4:38] comfort them the loss of their
[4:40] um their sister martha we had the
[4:44] funeral service celebration memorial
[4:47] thursday and i thought it went
[4:48] really well uh the pastor there i
[4:50] thought did a good job
[4:51] and uh kept things going and some really
[4:54] wonderful things were said about her
[4:56] and of course it's very encouraging to
[4:58] know that uh
[5:00] someone has
[5:03] made the commitment to the confession to
[5:06] the lord jesus and had mentioned the
[5:08] priscilla the desire to be baptized in
[5:11] the name of the lord jesus and
[5:13] things like that so and
[5:16] got to meet a few good people there and
[5:18] friends so
[5:19] just appreciate that time but remember
[5:21] them in prayer martha still
[5:23] has gone to be with her reward with the
[5:26] lord and her reward so
[5:27] just remember her in prayer as well as
[5:29] you if you would so
[5:31] and again if there's any other requests
[5:34] please continue remember help us we got
[5:36] we got pray for us we have some work to
[5:39] do on the building
[5:40] before we get it ready and me and
[5:42] brother roger's been very
[5:44] very busy um the past few weeks month or
[5:47] so
[5:48] so we're just you know we talk about the
[5:50] work to do and all and i told him i said
[5:52] brother it's not necessarily the work i
[5:54] think it's work that we can do
[5:55] uh i think it's the time getting the
[5:58] time to do it is probably the biggest
[5:59] thing right now so
[6:01] certainly remember that in prayer if you
[6:03] would and i just thankful the lord
[6:05] provided that for us i'll give you some
[6:06] more
[6:07] details about it and all i sent you a
[6:09] picture hopefully you got the picture
[6:11] and description or the address
[6:13] of where it's at it's a nice place and i
[6:15] believe the lord has provided us i
[6:16] looked at it yesterday
[6:18] on my maps and uh it is exactly 18
[6:21] minutes
[6:22] from here to the old church and it's
[6:24] exactly 18 minutes from here to the new
[6:26] church for us
[6:28] some of you probably have to drive a
[6:29] little further most of you i think it's
[6:31] going to be a little closer
[6:33] uh but uh i believe that you would come
[6:35] with the words priest irregardless so

[8:31] jesus christ we pray
[8:33] amen amen god bless you today
[8:38] i'm going to be reaching a little bit
[8:39] because uh i'm using a laptop that the
[8:42] camera is right here
[8:43] so uh and my phone and recording and
[8:47] things like that so
[8:48] i trust it won't bother you too bad but
[8:51] let's go into the scripture
[8:52] we're going to go and uh maybe lord
[8:54] willing maybe not take quite as long
[8:56] this week but
[8:58] uh maybe get about 45 minutes or so and
[9:00] just see how the lord leads this and
[9:02] where he decides to take this today um
[9:05] in revelation chapter 10 we're going to
[9:07] go
[9:08] continue on with the the mysteries of
[9:10] god in christ this will be part six
[9:12] and this is god revealing himself to his
[9:14] people part two
[9:16] so we're going to continue on kind of
[9:18] try to before we left off last week
[9:20] and begin back again with revelation 10
[9:23] 7 as we begin
[9:24] every one of these services like this so
[9:26] revelation 10 7
[9:27] says but in the day's voice of the
[9:30] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[9:31] sound the mystery
[9:33] singular of god should be finished as he
[9:35] has declared to his servants the
[9:37] prophets
[9:38] amen i remember of course so many times
[9:40] that we look at this
[9:42] as the mysteries that are to be finished
[9:44] the mysteries that are to be done
[9:47] all those mysteries wound up in jesus
[9:50] christ
[9:51] that god was able to bring in the
[9:53] condescension of jesus
[9:55] to bring him to us a people so where we
[9:57] could see him and feel him and
[9:59] hear him and record his voice and
[10:04] record it as in written down and be able
[10:07] to be
[10:07] privy to that and through the revelation
[10:09] that god gives us in his word for today
[10:12] but uh i want to go through this and
[10:15] there's a few points that i believe the
[10:17] lord wants to make in here
[10:19] uh with this and beginning back in
[10:21] genesis
[10:22] uh i want to go back to genesis chapter
[10:24] one and read that again
[10:26] as we did the other day uh and uh lord
[10:29] help me again this is
[10:31] not my fortess to preach to a camera and
[10:34] of course i'm watching myself and it's
[10:36] 10 seconds behind so
[10:38] uh just trusting the lord's anointing
[10:40] today genesis chapter one verse one look
[10:43] at this now again
[10:44] in the beginning was the in the
[10:46] beginning god created the heaven and the
[10:48] earth
[10:49] and the earth was without form and void
[10:51] and darkness was upon the face of the
[10:53] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[10:55] the face of the waters
[10:56] and god said let there be light and
[10:58] there was light now there's several
[11:00] things in here i want to bring out a
[11:02] point
[11:02] a part of now we understand there's uh
[11:06] there's the parts of this that scripture
[11:08] that is spiritual
[11:09] that it's of the spiritual element and
[11:11] the spiritual realm there's those are
[11:13] this that are of the natural
[11:14] uh that go come forth as the natural now
[11:18] uh if you go back to this you look it
[11:20] says in the beginning god created the
[11:22] heaven and the earth now that's a
[11:23] statement that's selfish sustaining
[11:26] that statement in in and of itself means
[11:29] exactly what it says that
[11:30] in the beginning god created the heaven
[11:32] and earth that's it
[11:34] that's that that's the end of that now
[11:36] how he did it
[11:37] when he did it how long it took him it
[11:39] doesn't say that
[11:40] notice now when he began now look though
[11:43] and the earth was without form and void
[11:45] so it had been created
[11:47] and the heavens and the earth all this
[11:49] this had been created
[11:50] we don't know how long again or uh
[11:54] or or that but look so the earth was
[11:57] without form and void in darkness
[11:59] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[12:01] of god then
[12:02] moved upon the face of the waters the
[12:04] spirit of god moved upon the face of the
[12:06] waters if you go back to david
[12:08] uh in the psalms i believe it's psalm
[12:10] 104
[12:12] you'll see that david even talked about
[12:14] that how god moved upon the earth
[12:17] to reform the earth well that's what he
[12:19] did he created it
[12:20] and then as he began to speak he began
[12:23] to form that earth into the way that he
[12:25] wanted it to be
[12:26] now i'm saying this because we
[12:29] we're obviously trying to in our our
[12:32] limited abilities
[12:33] bring down the almighty omnipotent
[12:36] all-knowing
[12:36] eternal infinite god down into a place
[12:39] to where god can reveal himself to us
[12:42] uh and and knowing that god did this and
[12:44] knowing that created that god created
[12:46] all these things
[12:47] then god's spirit came notice now god's
[12:51] spirit came
[12:53] and it moved upon the face of the waters
[12:56] god's spirit came now remember god
[12:59] created man in his own image
[13:01] when god created man he eventually now
[13:04] it took him a process but eventually
[13:06] man became a trial being man became
[13:10] body spirit soul that's what that's what
[13:13] man became the body
[13:15] the spirit on the inside of the soul
[13:16] that's on the inside of that triune
[13:18] being so if god made us in
[13:20] his own image then that must mean that
[13:22] god himself of course is tron being that
[13:25] we try to
[13:26] again wrap our little p brains around i
[13:28] mean there's so much more to this than
[13:29] we can imagine or say or think
[13:31] but just to try to bring it down into a
[13:33] way that we could maybe
[13:34] grasp it a little bit including myself
[13:37] if you will
[13:39] but now the spirit of god is moving out
[13:41] upon the face of the waters
[13:44] and as that spirit of god moved out
[13:46] god's spirit
[13:48] came out moved out upon the face of the
[13:52] waters
[13:53] and god said
[13:56] and god said that was god's word
[14:00] god said let there be light
[14:04] now that began the six day creation that
[14:08] we know of or the six
[14:09] day reforming world as you want to say
[14:13] of what god had created god had already
[14:16] created the heaven and the earth
[14:18] and then the spirit moved out upon that
[14:20] creation
[14:21] and then god began to speak and as god
[14:25] began to speak now you notice
[14:27] of course in god as always has always
[14:30] been
[14:31] uh that the the triune being a
[14:34] father son spirit uh all those have been
[14:38] there of course that's all a part of god
[14:40] jesus is the almighty god we read last
[14:43] week all these supporting him
[14:45] now if that spirit moved upon the face
[14:47] of the water and god
[14:49] spoke amen now god spoke
[14:52] when the spirit of god and notice that
[14:54] spirit of god
[14:56] the spirit of god is as said in the
[14:59] hebrews
[14:59] is the mind or the breath of god
[15:03] that that moved upon the face of the
[15:06] water so
[15:06] now if we in in our human abilities
[15:10] have to think before we speak and we
[15:13] although some of us probably don't think
[15:16] before we speak as my dad always told me
[15:18] that but
[15:19] but literally we think before we speak
[15:22] it has to be a thought before it becomes
[15:24] a word
[15:25] well when the spirit of god moved upon
[15:27] the face of the water that spirit is
[15:29] the mind of god or the breath that
[15:32] breath
[15:33] now who's in the mind of god amen
[15:36] so go there with me so as that spirit of
[15:39] god mind breath
[15:40] moved upon the face of the water god
[15:42] spoke
[15:44] so that if you will it
[15:47] now the word logos doesn't appear until
[15:49] the greek so
[15:52] the the old testament translated from
[15:54] hebrew so
[15:55] uh but if you if you take the same
[15:58] definitions if you will you can see that
[16:01] the
[16:02] the logos uh moving upon the face of
[16:06] water the mind the breath of god
[16:07] becoming
[16:08] rhema or the spoken word as
[16:11] as that mind of god became spoken word
[16:14] it it spoke and as it spoke it created
[16:19] we know hebrews tells us that uh that
[16:22] the
[16:23] these worlds were framed by what
[16:26] the rhema the word of god as god spoke
[16:29] the spirit
[16:30] became tangible that was in the spirit
[16:33] realm
[16:34] came down by the faith and spoken word
[16:36] of god
[16:37] into a reality into something tangible
[16:40] something you could touch see feel smell
[16:43] something that
[16:44] became a tangible for us humans
[16:47] well first it began there in the elohim
[16:50] as elohim as he spoke in his mind the
[16:53] spirit of god moved and he began to
[16:55] speak
[16:55] and when he spoke it created oh friend
[16:58] if we could just get to the point
[17:00] to understand the power of the spoken
[17:02] word
[17:03] and understand that we as children of
[17:05] god in the commission of god
[17:07] gives us his spirit to speak what does
[17:11] that do
[17:12] it it can create another world and go
[17:15] live on it
[17:17] amen just the power of that spoken word
[17:20] the power of the spoken word today god
[17:23] in us
[17:23] is the same now as it was then
[17:27] when it created that word spoke god
[17:30] said now when god said go look going
[17:33] back in the hebrew now
[17:34] uh from logos rhema which are greek
[17:38] words from the new testament
[17:39] but if you go look and you see that that
[17:42] that
[17:43] spoke when he spoke that's a verb
[17:47] if you go look in the hebrew it'll show
[17:48] you that word speak in the hebrew is a
[17:51] verb
[17:52] it's a it's a word of action so
[17:55] it wasn't something that we see at the
[17:57] spiritual it's something that's tangible
[17:59] he spoke
[18:00] when he spoke he created something came
[18:03] forth
[18:04] he said let there light and let there be
[18:06] light and there was
[18:08] light amen light came upon
[18:12] the heaven and earth that god had
[18:15] created
[18:16] amen that's that's seems very simplistic
[18:20] but it's true
[18:22] by faith these worlds were framed
[18:25] were framed by the word of god when god
[18:27] spoke let there be
[18:29] now that part of god of course
[18:32] that brought in the condensation this is
[18:35] just sort of
[18:37] laying the outline or even the beginning
[18:39] part of it if we could say beginning
[18:40] because the bible says in the beginning
[18:42] god spirit god
[18:46] creating bringing forth life
[18:50] as he did in the womb of a woman named
[18:52] mary
[18:54] through the holy spirit because it was
[18:56] always in him
[18:57] to do always a part of god oh think of
[19:00] this
[19:00] always a part of god in him to do to be
[19:04] able to even before the fall in the
[19:06] garden of eden this was in god this is a
[19:08] part of god for him to come out for him
[19:11] to
[19:12] bring forth that that sought that
[19:15] attribute
[19:16] in the mind to speak the spirit of god
[19:20] moving in the womb of a of a woman to
[19:22] create a blood
[19:24] cell that became jesus christ as we know
[19:27] the son of god the only begotten
[19:30] son of god created in the womb
[19:34] see god condensating himself bringing
[19:37] himself from
[19:38] one position from one state and bringing
[19:41] himself into a way that he could reveal
[19:44] himself to his people that he could
[19:47] reveal
[19:48] himself to us oh friend i guarantee you
[19:50] adam loved that time
[19:52] of fellowship with god in the cool of
[19:53] the day but i can't imagine he would
[19:56] love that any more than he loves the
[19:57] time to be able to fellowship with
[19:59] us that he loves to be able to come down
[20:02] and talk to you and to be able to
[20:03] fellowship with you
[20:04] and be able to bring back and everything
[20:06] that happened
[20:07] to bring back the uniting of god and man
[20:11] again
[20:12] that god and man could have that same
[20:13] fellowship was god revealing himself to
[20:16] his people
[20:17] only way to do it be able to condensate
[20:21] down
[20:21] into a kinfolk a kinsmen redeemer
[20:25] someone who was
[20:26] kin to us that we could be able to see
[20:29] him again
[20:30] tangible feel him hear him we can still
[20:32] read his words in this beautiful holy
[20:35] bible still today
[20:36] the life-giving words that we can read
[20:39] that means so much to us
[20:41] amen in the beginning god now i'm going
[20:44] to
[20:44] not today come back into the garden of
[20:47] eden
[20:48] but i want to hit a couple of other high
[20:51] points
[20:52] this was going to be the service today a
[20:54] couple of other high points
[20:55] that accentuate or highlight back to
[20:59] what we just talked about and read
[21:01] now you may be going with me already in
[21:03] your mind
[21:04] but physically go with me in the bible
[21:07] to
[21:08] saint john chapter one saint john
[21:10] chapter one
[21:11] i know what you're all thinking because
[21:13] you're all getting it in your mind right
[21:15] now in the beginning god
[21:16] uh in the beginning was the word see
[21:20] there we go back see in the beginning so
[21:23] we look now genesis 1 1 in the beginning
[21:26] god created
[21:27] saint john 1 in the beginning was the
[21:29] word
[21:30] amen in the beginning god
[21:34] in the beginning was the word
[21:38] now that word greek
[21:41] is logos of course spirit
[21:44] word logos is a thought or
[21:48] concept thought or concept now you see
[21:51] why i draw that
[21:53] back to where the spirit of god was
[21:56] in the beginning when the spirit of god
[21:58] moved remember thought
[22:00] his mind or breath see the spirit of god
[22:04] uh and the logos now in the beginning
[22:06] was the word the logos
[22:08] which is the father concept uh listen
[22:12] now though
[22:13] the expression or utterance of that
[22:16] thought
[22:17] the expression or utterance of that
[22:21] thought now that takes us right back to
[22:23] genesis
[22:24] 1 1-3 the mind of god
[22:28] the expression of god the thoughts of
[22:30] god brought into expression
[22:32] or utterance as we know as word
[22:36] word tangible rhema that comes forth
[22:40] out of god out of you
[22:43] out of jesus that word but in the
[22:46] beginning
[22:48] now it's saying the was the word
[22:51] the rhema the the logos
[22:55] of god that logos came forth
[22:58] that logos brewed over that logos that
[23:02] came and
[23:03] and and showed himself in the form of
[23:05] adam
[23:06] that logos that came and was the
[23:08] representative of
[23:09] jesus slaying the lambs that logos that
[23:12] came forth and
[23:13] was there in the form of melchizedek
[23:15] that logos that came and
[23:17] was the pillar of fire in the day in the
[23:19] cloud of night the children of israel
[23:21] that logos that came
[23:23] and was and fellowshipped and was in a
[23:26] body form with
[23:27] abraham when he was going to go down and
[23:30] and check on
[23:31] sodom and gomorrah it's the same logos
[23:33] that came and
[23:34] became jesus christ
[23:38] god condescending himself how many
[23:41] types shadows in the old testament
[23:44] through the bible do we have probably
[23:45] the most prominent one
[23:47] the paschal lamb isaiah 12 our
[23:50] of exodus 12 the paschal lamb and the
[23:54] passover lamb
[23:56] so many times types how about how about
[24:00] isaac how about isaac and the type of
[24:02] isaac packing the wood up the mountain
[24:05] to be a sacrifice as acceptable by god
[24:09] i'm going to get up there isaac said my
[24:12] father
[24:13] hears the wood and all the words that
[24:15] where's the sacrifice where's the lamb
[24:18] for sacrifice
[24:19] abraham said my son god will provide
[24:23] himself a lamb
[24:25] god will provide himself a sacrifice but
[24:27] look at isaac the man the boy
[24:29] tote his own cross tote his own wood up
[24:32] the hill
[24:33] amen the wood and the fire but where is
[24:35] the sacrifice
[24:36] god will provide himself but see now in
[24:38] the beginning
[24:39] was the word the word was
[24:42] with god and the word was god
[24:46] of course all a part of him all a part
[24:49] of him from the beginning
[24:51] that condensation doesn't just come down
[24:54] and end with jesus christ
[24:56] that condensation then comes in the form
[24:59] of that
[24:59] holy spirit to live in you to live in us
[25:04] so that we now are the manifestation
[25:07] of that thought that god had before the
[25:10] foundation of the world
[25:12] that brewed over
[25:16] and and became jesus christ
[25:20] the holy spirit in you in you and i in
[25:23] his people
[25:24] in the beginning was the word the word
[25:25] was with god the word was god
[25:28] the same was in the beginning with god
[25:32] amen all things were made by him
[25:35] and without him was not anything made
[25:38] that was made so everything of course is
[25:41] just simply saying that
[25:42] everything was made by him it was made
[25:45] by him it was made for him and there was
[25:47] nothing that
[25:48] is made today that you can see that
[25:50] wasn't made by him
[25:52] in him was life now that life that word
[25:55] life is zoe
[25:57] or the literal life of god the literal
[26:01] almighty life of god is zoe it was
[26:05] in him was life and the life
[26:08] was the light of men what is that light
[26:11] now notice that
[26:12] light still yet in logos form had not
[26:15] come
[26:15] into tangible form yet had not come into
[26:18] reality yet
[26:20] but it was still there in him
[26:23] was that light who was that light
[26:26] that light is jesus christ he was that
[26:30] light
[26:31] that was in him when he came to the
[26:32] earth what did he say i am the light
[26:35] i am the light of the world he said that
[26:38] i am that light he
[26:39] uh when he said that but now in him was
[26:42] life the life was the light of men
[26:46] jesus the light of men the light shineth
[26:49] in darkness and the darkness
[26:51] comprehended that not that's why the
[26:53] unbeliever doesn't like it doesn't
[26:54] believe it doesn't want to have anything
[26:56] to do with it
[26:57] uh they don't want to listen they don't
[26:59] want to go to church they don't want to
[27:00] obey they don't because the darkness
[27:02] doesn't understand it
[27:03] the darkness will never see the light
[27:06] the darkness will never
[27:07] comprehend or understand the darkness
[27:10] will never
[27:11] have a revelation of the light to them
[27:14] that's just what happens the bible says
[27:17] that if this law
[27:18] if it is uh um if it is heated it's yet
[27:21] to those that are lost
[27:23] that the the god of this world has
[27:25] blinded
[27:26] their eyes because if you go over in in
[27:29] john 3 it says that the men would rather
[27:32] they love darkness rather than light
[27:34] well
[27:35] the bible does say if you love the world
[27:37] of the things of the world how loveth
[27:38] the
[27:39] how well is the love of god in you well
[27:41] what is it they've chosen darkness over
[27:44] light
[27:44] they've chosen the world over jesus
[27:47] they've chosen the things of the world
[27:49] and
[27:49] the things of the uh of this evil place
[27:53] of darkness over the over jesus christ
[27:56] and when jesus came to his own people
[27:58] they rejected him
[27:59] but the people today they see
[28:03] the darkness they they can't pop
[28:04] comprehend it
[28:06] can't comprehend it here
[28:10] um they can't comprehend it they can't
[28:13] comprehend the light see
[28:16] the darkness comprehended not there was
[28:18] a man sent from john whose name
[28:20] god whose name was john the same
[28:23] came for a witness to bear witness of
[28:25] the light
[28:26] that all men might believe him there was
[28:29] a man
[28:30] sent from john amen notice this a man
[28:33] sent from john
[28:34] god whose name was john or dares i say
[28:37] there was a man
[28:38] sent from god whose name was william
[28:40] branham
[28:42] the same came for a witness to bear
[28:44] witness of the light
[28:46] he came to bear witness of the light
[28:49] amen
[28:50] he was not that light but he come to
[28:52] bear witness
[28:53] of that light who is that light that
[28:56] light is
[28:56] jesus amen that light is jesus
[29:01] see that all men through him might
[29:03] believe
[29:04] the same came for a witness to bear
[29:06] witness of the light that all men
[29:08] through him might believe
[29:10] it was not the light but was sent to
[29:13] bear witness
[29:14] of that light he was the witness of
[29:17] jesus christ that was the true light see
[29:21] each other in succession like that
[29:24] like john the baptist did were here for
[29:27] that purpose
[29:28] that was the purpose that they were here
[29:30] for their purpose was to
[29:33] bring that light into life
[29:37] to to help people see through revelation
[29:40] that light and who that light is
[29:44] amen so to be able to see that
[29:47] uh was was the light of men that was
[29:51] the true light who is that jesus
[29:54] jesus was the true light which lighteth
[29:56] every man that cometh into the world now
[29:58] i want you to see
[29:59] how this is condescending how here
[30:03] i want you to see how this has come from
[30:05] one spot to the next
[30:07] where this is uh uh coming down from the
[30:10] beginning in the beginning being the
[30:12] word
[30:12] downing into this place now to where the
[30:15] light is beginning to shine
[30:17] and that john the baptist was here to
[30:19] bear witness
[30:20] of that light to help everyone
[30:22] understand and see
[30:24] how this was a witness of that light
[30:26] john the baptist was here
[30:28] that's why he was able to say
[30:31] that you know behold the lamb of god
[30:35] which take away the sin of the world
[30:37] because there he was
[30:38] the lamb of god
[30:43] now let's look here the true light which
[30:45] every uh which light of every man that
[30:47] cometh into the world
[30:48] he was in the world and the world was
[30:50] made by him but the world knew him not
[30:53] he came unto his own and his own
[30:56] received him not but as many as received
[30:58] him to them gave he
[30:59] power to become the sons of god even to
[31:02] them that believe on his name
[31:04] which were born not of blood nor of the
[31:06] will of flesh nor
[31:08] of the will of man but of god
[31:11] who is that now that's that's brought
[31:14] from
[31:14] in the beginning was the word
[31:20] the light the life that was in god
[31:23] that was coming forth that was shining
[31:25] in the darkness
[31:27] down into john the baptist which began
[31:29] to under
[31:30] uh reveal or begin to preach
[31:33] jesus christ that word and as that word
[31:37] came forth then it began to come in
[31:40] in the human flesh and and then
[31:43] showed us as we then receive the power
[31:47] to become sons of god now it's gone from
[31:51] that part
[31:52] to in each one of us from that in the
[31:54] beginning
[31:55] to now with us
[31:58] that gave us the power to become the
[32:01] sons of god now what does that make us
[32:04] does that not put this bride in that
[32:07] position
[32:08] of being a part of god almighty of being
[32:11] that thought that
[32:12] attribute does that not show the
[32:15] revelation of jesus christ to his people
[32:18] so that we can see him and and he could
[32:20] be revealed to us
[32:22] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[32:25] us and we beheld his glory
[32:27] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[32:30] father
[32:30] full of grace and truth and now he is
[32:33] the same yesterday
[32:35] today and forever the word
[32:38] may flesh that look us
[32:42] that would be flesh that word
[32:45] that attribute that creation
[32:48] that came down into the womb of mary
[32:51] that created a blood cell
[32:53] that became the lord jesus christ became
[32:57] flesh that word coming into
[33:00] flesh wine so that we could see it
[33:04] so that we could know it that it would
[33:05] be revealed to us
[33:07] somehow that's why jesus looked at his
[33:10] disciples and he said
[33:11] who do men say that i son of man and
[33:14] some say well
[33:16] some say you're this and some say you're
[33:18] that and some say
[33:19] these others and and then but then jesus
[33:22] looked and got very personal with
[33:24] him and said but who do you say that i
[33:26] am
[33:27] and peter of course became the spokesman
[33:29] of the group
[33:30] stood up and said that thou art the
[33:32] christ the son of the lady god
[33:35] and jesus looked at it and said blessed
[33:38] art thou
[33:38] simon barjona for flesh and blood has
[33:41] not revealed this unto you but my father
[33:43] which is in heaven
[33:44] has revealed this to you and upon
[33:47] this rock what is that rock that rock is
[33:51] the revelation
[33:52] of who jesus christ is that rock is that
[33:55] revelation that rock
[33:57] is jesus and the and
[34:00] dares i say the understanding but the
[34:02] revelation
[34:03] of the truth of who he is not some
[34:06] trinity not some father son holy ghost
[34:10] not some errant baptisms or uh
[34:13] titles but the lord jesus christ
[34:16] and who he is and who he is to us
[34:19] his bride how was he able to do it
[34:22] he came down so that we could come and
[34:26] so that he could come that we could be
[34:28] uh that we could be partakers of that
[34:31] so that we could see that the word
[34:33] became flesh
[34:34] and dwelt among us and he's standing
[34:37] there amongst his believers
[34:39] dares i say to us today who do you say
[34:42] that he is
[34:43] because that's what really matters not
[34:44] what they said but who do you say that
[34:47] he is
[34:48] that's what matters to me who he is to
[34:50] me who is he to me
[34:52] who is he to you because that's what
[34:54] really matters for that revelation
[34:56] it's who he is seminary or some other
[35:00] church or denomination but who is it to
[35:02] you not to your parents
[35:04] not to your spouse not your children
[35:06] nephews uncles nieces whatever
[35:08] you personally who is he to you
[35:12] that has to become a revelation god has
[35:15] made it possible
[35:16] so that that that spirit in us
[35:20] recognizes that that that spirit of god
[35:25] because they're the same spirit the two
[35:27] become one
[35:37] is to literally hybrid or attempt to
[35:41] in in people's minds hybrid the mind of
[35:45] god
[35:46] to hybrid the word because you see and
[35:49] understand now
[35:50] who that is where that came from
[35:53] what it represents to hybrid that is to
[35:56] hybrid
[35:57] the mind of god you can't hybrid god's
[35:59] word
[36:00] his word is pure his word is right look
[36:03] revelation chapter 3
[36:07] revelation 14 and the angel
[36:10] church laodiceans write these things say
[36:13] at the amen the faithful and true
[36:15] witness the beginning
[36:16] of the creation of god the beginning of
[36:20] the creation
[36:21] of god let me read you a quote there
[36:23] from the church age book just a moment
[36:26] you can see it in the smyrna church age
[36:29] god
[36:29] came down in a blood cell not through a
[36:32] man
[36:32] but by the holy ghost and in the virgin
[36:35] womb of
[36:36] a tabernacle for the purpose of death
[36:40] the seed of the woman came in order that
[36:43] he be bruised
[36:44] to bring us our salvation when the holy
[36:47] ghost came upon mary he created within
[36:49] her womb the cell
[36:51] that would multiply and become the body
[36:53] of our lord
[36:55] that cell was created it was the
[36:58] beginning of the creation of god
[37:01] who that is who jesus
[37:04] is that beginning of the creation
[37:08] of god remember where we just came from
[37:13] in the beginning of this we came from i
[37:15] know i've said a lot in probably a short
[37:17] period of time
[37:17] but we notice where it came from where
[37:20] it began
[37:21] where was it the elohim the great
[37:24] almighty in the beginning
[37:26] created the heads and the earth the
[37:28] spirit moved upon
[37:30] the face of the waters and god spoke and
[37:32] said let there be
[37:34] the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[37:38] the logos became rhema and it became
[37:41] physical it became tangible see
[37:44] but jesus that true and faithful witness
[37:48] is the beginning of the creation of god
[37:52] that creation that brought us salvation
[37:55] and i want to read this one scripture
[37:57] uh before it was one more scripture
[37:58] before i close here
[38:00] because my time does certainly seem to
[38:03] get away awful quickly on me but
[38:05] let's go to the first uh chapter one
[38:09] colossians chapter one and begin with
[38:10] verse 12
[38:14] of uh colossians 1 12
[38:22] look at this now giving thanks unto the
[38:24] father
[38:25] which has made us meek to be partakers
[38:27] of the inheritance of the saints and
[38:29] light
[38:30] who had delivered us oh there's so much
[38:33] in here i want to talk about
[38:36] who had you may need to visit this later
[38:38] who had delivered
[38:39] us from the power of darkness look at
[38:43] this
[38:44] let's go back to the 12th first version
[38:47] giving thanks unto the father
[38:51] which had made us meet
[38:54] that means able to be partakers
[38:58] of the inheritance of the saints
[39:02] where in light
[39:05] who is the light jesus
[39:09] so he has made us meet or
[39:13] able to be partakers
[39:16] of the inheritance god has made us able
[39:18] to be partakers
[39:20] of the inheritance of the saints
[39:24] in christ in light
[39:28] now it transitions
[39:31] from giving thanks unto the father who's
[39:34] made us
[39:35] able unto the light
[39:39] which is the who in the 13th verse
[39:43] who had delivered us from the power of
[39:46] darkness
[39:48] amen he delivered us the power of
[39:50] darkness
[39:51] and has translated or moved us
[39:55] not translated as in transformed
[39:58] but translated us as in moving from
[40:02] one spot to the next or putting us from
[40:05] one position to another
[40:07] has who has delivered us from the power
[40:10] of darkness
[40:12] and hath moved us or translated us or
[40:16] changed us into the kingdom of his dear
[40:20] son jesus
[40:21] amen he's moved us
[40:25] he's translated us from the grip of the
[40:28] power of darkness
[40:30] that held us from the beginning of the
[40:32] garden of eden
[40:34] to this time today has moved us now
[40:37] after he's delivered us from the group
[40:40] of darkness
[40:41] moved us now over into the kingdom
[40:45] of jesus christ praise the lord
[40:49] in whom now jesus in whom
[40:53] we have redemption through his blood
[40:56] even the forgiveness of sins who's that
[40:59] jesus we have now the forgiveness of sin
[41:04] through redemption through the blood of
[41:07] jesus christ
[41:09] who is the image now again he's talking
[41:11] about jesus
[41:12] of course this is this is the theme of
[41:15] our
[41:15] services here this is the theme of our
[41:18] crisis the
[41:23] mysteries plural in christ see
[41:26] uh that is our life
[41:29] that is our message that is our hope
[41:31] that is our speech
[41:33] that is our our faith that is our
[41:35] everything
[41:36] jesus christ who is the
[41:39] image or the expression
[41:42] of the invisible god jesus christ
[41:46] the created blood cell we just read the
[41:48] beginning of the creation of god was
[41:50] that expression
[41:52] of the invisible god the spirit
[41:55] god became tangible the spirit
[41:59] god came into flesh and
[42:02] was that expression now not just
[42:05] humanity as human beings
[42:09] but in every way in every facet
[42:14] was god in the expressed
[42:17] image of
[42:21] jesus the express image of god
[42:25] in every way you can go over to the
[42:28] second verse
[42:29] of the second chapter read verse nine
[42:31] for in him
[42:33] jesus dwelleth all the fullness of the
[42:36] godhead ugly
[42:37] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[42:39] dwelt in christ
[42:40] so when he says here that
[42:44] that jesus is that expressed image
[42:47] of the invisible god that means in every
[42:50] form and fashion
[42:52] in every way not just as you looked at
[42:54] him as
[42:55] as a flesh being but in every way he was
[42:58] almighty god that's why isaiah
[43:02] called him the almighty god
[43:06] because that's who he is the almighty
[43:08] god the firstborn of
[43:09] every creature for by him jesus
[43:13] were all things created that are in
[43:16] heaven
[43:17] and they're in earth visible and
[43:20] invisible
[43:21] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[43:23] principalities or
[43:26] all things were created by him and
[43:29] for him and he is before
[43:32] all things we read that genesis 1
[43:36] we read that saint john 1 he is the
[43:39] beginning
[43:40] of all things and by him all things
[43:43] stand or consist they stand today
[43:47] because of who he is god said let there
[43:51] be
[43:52] there was the spirit of god moved and
[43:55] god said let there be
[43:56] and there was and it stands today
[44:00] everything that it was in him he created
[44:04] was by him and for him and he is before
[44:08] all things and by him all things consist
[44:11] that includes us
[44:12] all things stand today
[44:16] and he is the head of the body the
[44:18] church
[44:20] jesus christ who is the beginning amen
[44:23] revelation 3 4 14 we just read who is
[44:26] the beginning
[44:27] he is the beginning of the creation of
[44:28] god the firstborn from
[44:30] the dead that in all things he might
[44:33] have the preeminence
[44:34] and all things down that brings us
[44:37] although i probably take one more
[44:39] subject of service on this that brings
[44:42] us to the
[44:43] second part of christ the mystery of god
[44:45] revealed
[44:46] first part god revealing himself to his
[44:48] people second part
[44:50] having the preeminence in that body of
[44:52] believers
[44:53] see in this we get that scripture
[44:56] and the head and he is jesus is the head
[44:59] of the body the church
[45:00] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[45:03] the dead that in
[45:04] all things he might have the preeminence
[45:07] for it please the father that in him
[45:10] should all fullness dwell
[45:12] all right so there is
[45:17] colossians 2 9 in him dwelleth all the
[45:21] fullness of the godhead bottle
[45:23] 10th verse says that now you we are
[45:26] complete
[45:27] in christ who is the fullness of the
[45:30] godhead bodily
[45:32] dwelt in christ and have
[45:35] um where please the father in him should
[45:38] dwell
[45:38] all the fullness and having made uh made
[45:41] peace through the blood of his cross
[45:43] by him to reconcile all things unto
[45:46] himself
[45:46] by him i say whether they be things in
[45:49] earth or things in heaven
[45:50] and you that were sometimes alienated
[45:53] and enemies
[45:54] in your mind by wicked works yet now
[45:57] have he reconciled
[45:59] and the body of his flesh through death
[46:01] to present you
[46:02] holy and unblameable and unreportable
[46:06] in his sight if you continue in the
[46:08] faith grounded and settled and be not
[46:10] moved away from the hope of the gospel
[46:12] which ye have heard
[46:14] and which we have was preached to every
[46:16] creature which is under heaven
[46:18] whereof i paul and maybe minister who
[46:20] now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[46:23] and fill up that which is behind of the
[46:26] afflictions of christ in my
[46:28] flesh for his body sake which is the
[46:30] church
[46:31] whereof i am made a minister according
[46:33] to the dispensation of god which is
[46:35] given to me for you
[46:36] to fulfill the word of god that is still
[46:39] the commission we have today
[46:41] that is still the commission given to us
[46:43] today fulfilling
[46:45] that word of god even the mystery as it
[46:47] is his fault as it has been spoken
[46:52] in history which has been killed from
[46:55] ages and from generations but is now
[46:58] made manifest to the saints
[47:00] now what was that that was hid and what
[47:03] was that that was made manifest
[47:06] christ god the invisible god
[47:11] untouchable by man unable to understand
[47:15] comprehend by man
[47:18] became tangible that was the great
[47:22] mystery that was
[47:23] hid all that time all those years
[47:26] now become known how has it become
[47:30] known oh you can look back and you can
[47:32] see adam's part
[47:34] you can see god's part in the garden of
[47:38] eden with the lamps you can see
[47:39] you can see the pascal lamp like we said
[47:42] earlier and you can see the the pillar
[47:45] of cloud
[47:46] by a day and the pillar of fire by night
[47:48] the children as you can see the
[47:50] the melchizedek and the one that came to
[47:54] abraham and discerned the thoughts of
[47:57] the tent behind him uh you you saw the
[48:00] paschal lamb and
[48:02] the the sacrificial lamb you you see
[48:04] isaiah talking about him coming forth
[48:08] and then coming and then that prophecy
[48:10] coming true
[48:12] where a virgin did conceive brought
[48:14] forth a
[48:15] man child all those things that
[48:19] paul is talking about has now been made
[48:22] known
[48:24] now it is not a mystery but it is
[48:28] manifested
[48:30] what is manifested uncovered or revealed
[48:34] to the saints it's not for everybody
[48:38] he came to those that were his own you
[48:41] read the bible
[48:42] he came to those that were his own to
[48:45] whom god would make known what is the
[48:47] riches of the glory
[48:48] of this mystery among the gentiles which
[48:51] is christ
[48:52] in you the hope of glory whom we preach
[48:55] warning every man and teaching every man
[48:57] in all wisdom
[48:59] that we may present every man perfect in
[49:02] christ jesus
[49:03] whereunto i also labor striving
[49:05] according to the work
[49:07] which worketh in me mightily
[49:10] that work of christ that now i'm working
[49:12] in each one of us
[49:14] that proves who he is
[49:18] showing jesus the same yesterday today
[49:20] and forever
[49:21] he was the same yesterday amen
[49:25] different form still god today
[49:28] he was when he walked here he is today
[49:32] he will be through eternity the same
[49:34] yesterday
[49:35] today and forever if god revealed that
[49:39] to us
[49:40] to see that in him lays
[49:44] lays the responsibility for us to know
[49:47] who we are today
[49:50] it was imperative for john the baptist
[49:54] to do what he did
[49:55] and declare jesus and for them to follow
[49:58] jesus and not john
[50:01] the forerunner of the first coming of
[50:03] christ it was imperative upon the second
[50:05] run of the first
[50:06] of the second the first the forerunner
[50:09] the second coming of christ
[50:10] brother branham to do the exact same
[50:12] thing
[50:13] to point a bride to jesus christ there's
[50:16] people in this country there's people in
[50:18] this world
[50:19] there's people all over that say brother
[50:20] bran appointed people to himself
[50:22] and made this that lied about this that
[50:24] whatever
[50:26] the only thing that that man tried to do
[50:28] the most was to get people to understand
[50:30] who they were
[50:31] and jeru and and for jesus christ to be
[50:34] revealed to them
[50:35] and for them to follow christ and not
[50:37] him
[50:39] if that's not a message i don't know
[50:41] what is but that was what it was
[50:43] brought to us so that it could be
[50:45] revealed to us
[50:47] that we could know because if
[50:50] if we can't see
[50:53] the revelation of that word then how are
[50:56] we ever going to
[50:57] see us revealed in that word
[51:01] how are we ever going to see ourselves
[51:03] in
[51:04] the word how can we ever see ourselves
[51:07] being the word unless we can see and
[51:10] recognize what god has done
[51:13] where it is today what's going on in our
[51:17] lives today
[51:18] where we're at in this end time where
[51:21] are we
[51:22] friend is a late hour and we're in this
[51:25] last days
[51:27] god unfolding himself god revealing
[51:30] himself
[51:31] those scriptures i wanted to read to you
[51:34] maybe next week we can transition if the
[51:36] lord terry's
[51:37] into that part into the next part
[51:40] and uh and and try to get into that
[51:43] preeminence that god wants to have in
[51:46] his body of believers
[51:48] that that falls squarely on our
[51:50] shoulders friend
[51:52] now this far this first part god
[51:54] condensating himself
[51:56] into the place that he could reveal
[51:58] himself to his people
[51:59] you that that was that was god working
[52:02] that work
[52:02] and and in that god created the
[52:06] the vehicle the possibility to bring the
[52:09] second part to past
[52:11] which is to have preeminence in us
[52:15] and to live in us amen so
[52:18] lord whitley maybe next time we'll get
[52:21] get to that place and
[52:23] and friend just try to try to do we
[52:26] what we can define to see ourselves
[52:29] in the word to see ourselves in
[52:33] christ and to know our position today
[52:35] this brian's not going to go anywhere
[52:37] until she knows who she is
[52:39] and and getting to that place that we
[52:41] know who she is we got to know where we
[52:43] came from who we are and what's going on
[52:45] today and what god's done for us
[52:47] where he's brought us from all these
[52:49] mysteries we talk about are simply
[52:51] contained
[52:53] in this one lord jesus christ
[52:58] other people and some father son holy
[52:59] ghost
[53:01] who were they it could be any father i'm
[53:03] a son i'm a father
[53:05] i'm a human being but if this one man is
[53:08] contained all
[53:10] this one lord jesus christ died and gave
[53:14] himself for us
[53:16] amen in him contains it all
[53:19] the fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[53:22] praise the lord
[53:23] so god bless you today i prayed son pray
[53:26] something once said to
[53:27] bless you help you in some way today god
[53:30] is good to us
[53:31] god's blessed us revealed himself to us
[53:33] shown us his word help us to see that
[53:35] word
[53:36] and then that word would be revealed to
[53:38] us that it would be recognizable of who
[53:40] we are in him
[53:42] amen god richly bless you
[53:45] let's bow our heads for a moment of
[53:47] prayer if we could now

[53:53] that in my little in our little
[53:57] humanity feeble pea brain efforts lord
[54:01] it what you do for so transcend
[54:04] transcends that lord and brings it all
[54:08] to the place that
[54:14] it has to be a revelation it has to be
[54:17] something that
[54:18] transcends just human knowledge or
[54:21] something that we learn
[54:23] i thought it's something that only you
[54:24] can do and in doing all of this
[54:27] for us lord you've brought it to pass
[54:30] just as i believe you brought it to pass
[54:31] to them there the disciples
[54:33] they didn't have a full grasp of it

[54:38] day lord but
[54:39] they had what they needed for that day
[54:41] and and peter stood forth and said you

[54:48] they lived upon lord
