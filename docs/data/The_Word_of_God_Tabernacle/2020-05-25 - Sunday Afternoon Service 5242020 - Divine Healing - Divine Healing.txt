TRANSCRIPT
========================================
welcome to our living room once again hopefully for the last time it's going to be the last living room stream we're going to do as I mentioned last week me and sooner you're gonna go planning on trying to have an anniversary trip next week next Sunday will be our 35th anniversary so we're gonna try to be out of town I've been thinking about maybe if I have some time during the week doing an extra message short like I normally do during the week and maybe for Sunday but also remember that brother Roger has his streaming at 10 o'clock on Sunday mornings as well something that you could attend or be a part of but me and son are going to be gone Lord willing next Sunday we won't be here so then the following Sunday we're gonna try to meet the holiday in conference room the two other places that I had that we're hopeful for more permanent places for us to be fell through so at least as of right now I'm using one of those just going to work so again as of right now next next week me and sone you're going to be gone the following week we're gonna be trying to start meeting at the Holiday Inn conference room there on kotero Cracker Barrel Drive right there off court arrow half a mile or so from where we used to have church so that's kind of the plan right now anything changes I'll let you know but as as I said before it looks like this would be our last string here in our living room but it's glad to have each one of you don't know how much it means to me to know that you're on the other end of this and watching it's it's a little different when I do the midweek and with my phone and just by myself it's a little different than standing here live and knowing that you're sitting there listening really makes a big difference to me so I appreciate you being there I appreciate you listening and being part of the service today and we'll all be a part of it together even though we're separate but we're one spirit amen or in one spirit and that's what matters the most just help us come to realize how much we need each other and how much we pinned on each other but also the preparation of understanding that we need him for the kneading thing so with him in our lives and in leading and guiding us that's what matters the most and no matter where we are we're still together so God's going to be calling us from all Kindred's tongue people nation we're going to be coming from all over the world to come together and rapture is going to take place to go home and we're all going to come together that one unified place someday so looking forward to that time amen so god bless you today welcome to our service we want to open our service and word of Prayer now I had one person sister she had sent me prayer requests her behalf first of all she said that she had a serious unspoken family and requests that she wants us to remember in prayer also continue remember her brother Harlan which we've mentioned here several times you've been praying for I trust for sister she Leah's brother Harlan in Texas teen you remember him in prayer as she reiterated the fact that he has mentioned to her that he feels when the people are praying for him so this made sure and keep that up and pray for her pray for our pray for him pray for the other requests we had her brother Jenna's wife Leah of course she's a nurse there with all that's going on with the Cova thing and it seems like we're getting back to a little semblance of normal in the nation I heard that every country every state now has loosened some regulations at some point to some degree in the entire country so we're thankful for that and get back to I guess what's considered normal in this world today what's normal is not normal to us but normal according to our country normal according to the world and sister Sheila also asked for requests she had fallen earlier in the week on a concrete or asphalt street trying to swerve startled by an aggressive dog and she felt she was thankful she didn't hurt anything or didn't break anything I should say just some recovery and getting back to normal also to make known that you know I've been working me and brother Rogers been working doing electrical work together and we were out Wednesday I believe it was believed it was wins anyway and got into some behind some bushes and brother Roger was drilling holes in the wall and B started stinging him and so we worked on another part of the job and had to come back over to that part and he started drilling to that wall again and the Beast has come piling over the back of that wall and they were by the dozens I saw 3040 of them probably I told the rupture get out of there she had been allergic to bees before I don't know if you've heard the story but he got stung as a young boy brother branham pray for him and healed got healed but his airway restrict so I said you better get out of there well the guy at the owner of the house had some people some exterminators go over and found out that there were thousands of bees living in the back side of that wall so we still haven't been able to finish that job and exterminate or come out but we got a few stings brother Roger got about five of them I have I think three couple owned one of each arm my head so thankful the Lord's blessed us and it wasn't any worse than that so God's been good to us but just remember those remember the Bride of Christ worldwide in prayer remember every one that has a need if you had one of course you signified to the Lord in your heart that you have a need that you expect and believe

fellowship and pray your Holy Spirit would have its preeminence now as we committed to you and they're mainly part of this service I ask it and ask it on behalf of our congregation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so come to you today and had a couple thoughts of my heart this is something last week was something that I told you mentioned and we've gone over before today's the same thing something that came on my heart that I thought was very appropriate for today and for us and for what we're going through and for the things that's happening in this country in the world today to understand that as we've gone through the different things it's it's as I looked back and reflected upon it it's kind of a progression almost a little bit how the Lord has brought each one of these sermons during this period of time to the place that it's at now thinking about this world is not our home and and were exempt from the things of the world and God has called us and raised us up into heavenly places in a bride age and to a place where all these things that we look at the diseases afflictions all those things I'm not saying that we're completely exempt from those friends but I do understand that in this life that God has already given us and blessed us today so titled this just divine healing but it's going back into numbers chapter 21 sermon they would preached before about the brass serpent and thought a very appropriate for for what we're going through today and what I believe the Lord put on my heart to say today so let's go in the scripture to numbers chapter 21 and read a few verses of Scripture here beginning with the fifth verse numbers 21 5 now before we read this we see that the Canaanites had taken some of the children of Israel and the chart and pledge to God God if you'll delivered them into our hands we vowed to destroy the cities and God did that God liberated them those people that have been captive into their hands and led them into a way of destroying the enemy but then just after that I mean simply the next verse of course that ends at the the third verse then you got the fourth verse of their journey so we're starting with the fifth verse numbers 21 five and this is just after the victory that God had so mightily wrought to them and delivered those that were captive into their hands again the fifth verse now this just really shows the humanistic value of of who we are who they were who we are today listening and the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness die in the woods after what God had just done for them for there is no bread neither is there eating water and our soul lovest this liked bread now that white bread the bread means the same thing they just said we have no bread light bread just means the word light which we would think means less calories does not mean that the scripture what it means in the scripture is is contemptible and worthless so what they're saying is the bread that God provided from the supernatural bread God given to them and provided for them there now got so complacent they had gotten so used to it and it becomes so common to them that they kind of complacent about God's provision to them that they began to call God's providing provided way God's provision contemptible and worthless man it's a sad place to be but that's what we're reading that's what we're talking about and hopefully in examining our own lives that we don't get to that place here in our own mind so we get then it becomes so common and becomes so easy to us and and things like that that it's just too common we don't want to let it ever become common see that even goes back to last week scripture on that pressurization we don't want it to become pronto common that pressure comes in to keep it from getting that way see we don't ever want it to become common to us so don't let it become common as it did to them they called it contemptible and worthless God's provided bread was contemptible and worthless and the Lord now this was very displeasing to the Lord so the Lord sent fiery serpents fiery mean poisonous deadly serpents the fiery part come from of course when they win them when the snake bit them it felt like burning fire in their bodies as the poison pulls through their veins it felt fiery and burning thus the fiery serpents said fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died now that's the judgment the judgment on their sin their sin of complacency their sin of talking against God to talking against Moses talking against God's provided way their sin their unbelief we know sin is unbelie-- their unbelief of bringing this in bringing this plague upon them God sent those fiery serpents as judgment on those people now understand there there's brother Branham preached three kind of believers we know there's three kind of believers he talked about three kind of believers and let every local assembly would you say what he said I trust believe they're not in our assembly but I trusted for good pastors a real good godly pastor he feels the same way about his congregation as I do but brother Graham said there regardless three kind of believers - believer make-believe or unbeliever we can't negate the fact that in Old Testament that it would have been the same way there are those that were the real true believer there were those that were kind of in the middle you know they would they would kind of go with Moses sometimes and then they kind of go with Nathan and Korah sometimes and then you have the bases and quarter group to flat-out unbelievers they weren't made believing at all they weren't a part of it nor were they going to be a part of it didn't want to be a part of it so they were the unbeliever and you had those that were in the middle that kind of went with faith in the quarter sometimes and and and then with Moses sometimes so and then the miracles came and all the the things that God was doing through Moses begin to manifest itself they would go with Moses and they was celebrating them with shout and say praise the Lord and then when it came outside of church when they came out of Moses presence and they heard Nathan and cor over here yelling and screaming about whatever negative or wrong thing that they could they're right there with him saying oh yes yes this then why did you lead us here to die the wilderness blah blah blah so there's that group of people too they were going with Moses son well they were in church they were just as religious as they could be but when they came out of church and all the negativity and all the dissension was happening they were with that too and they go back to church then getting rejuvenate and then they go back out and see you had both groups you had one group regardless of what happened regardless of what was said or took place regardless of how hard the way was they were going to stay with God and Moses period the believer so you can see how even in that day that they would have the same so so these unbelievers began to scream out now they were one group and remember that Israel the Jews are wandering God deals with them as the group the Jews he deals with the Gentiles as individuals we know that so as one of them was beginning to move forward now he deals with the bride to in that way as a body but as Israel was was beginning to speak forth even though it was the make-believe or the unbeliever God deals with him as a groom so that we're all a part of a part of that same group so when when the negative began to come out God reflected on that as Israel that was Israel being rebellious disobedient so as Israel began to do that God sent the judgment on all of them the judgment came down on all of them the fiery serpents were with the believers the fiery serpents was with the Mait believers the fiery serpents were with the unbelievers the fiery serpents were there as a judgment on all of Israel every one of them was subject to that judgment now think about that and think about that and think about that in terms of what's going on today and the things is happening in this world think about coronavirus and what's happening in this world and I hate to think that almost every time we talk now that that word coronavirus happens to be a part of our natural everyday verbage but it's true and it's something that we can relate to because it's happening now but we can relate to it also with recognizing that things like this have happened before and when you look at this and you see this happening to them the judgment was on all of them it was on the believer it was on the make believer and the unbeliever judgment but now let's continue to read now as the serpents begin to bite much of Israel the people of Israel died much of them died seventh verse now therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned but we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for the people now it's just kind of common that when people make mistakes or do things wrong they don't issue repent until they're caught people don't usually say they're sorry or contrite or contentious or apologetic until until they're caught now this has come down and God has judged them and now recognizes now wait a minute we've done done something wrong and that seems to be human nature the way people he's due and and so when this happened then they begin to realize oh my we got to stop this somehow we got to repent we got to make things right and that's okay because that's the way God set it up God made a way for us to repent for us to repent today made a way for them to repent and and then Moses went and prayed for the people as he did incessantly Moses made intercession for his people there and the Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and he shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live now God's instruction take a serpent of this fiery serpent is a serpent of brass that is formed in the fire form this brass serpent in the form of brass fire it and put it on a stick so that the whole congregation of Israel can see this this fiery serpent now we know that the serpent represented sin and go back to the Garden of Eden and see in the Garden of Eden that the serpent was came forth was sin and that sin in the Garden of Eden was judged so the serpent represented sin judged that sin being judged is what they is what God showed to the children of Israel they could recognize that they can see that sin knowing what happened in the garden eating that sin being judged so what it was was that atonement what it was was a representation of the in sign that that atonement the standard you know the inside just means a standard it's a standard that was set it was something that God brought as a representation as a standard now you know what a standard a standard is something that everything comes off of a standard is is the absolute it's the place of a typos it's the finalization and all for that comes everything else that's the state that's what you go by you got a real dollar bill and you got those that come off of it it's good you got to have the first the standard that's what it is that in son was the standard that standard here being sin already judged that serpent showing the brass serpent of course the brass the brass represented divine judgment but that sin already judged was that was that brass serpent so they looked at it now the people asked Moses to ask God to take away the fiery serpents but God didn't take away the fiery serpents look friend God did not take it away you look at today I I don't see God taking away coronavirus but what did he do for them he made a way of asking for them even though they were still there even though they were still in the midst of the judgment the fiery serpents were still there God was not going to take away the fiery serpents every time that come it was a reminder to those people what they had done it God had taken away those fiery serpents that reminder would not have been there and and eventually as humans are the further time goes by the more you forget those things the more you don't remember how it was back at that day so those fiery serpents were still there God left them there as an example as a reminder to those people that this is what happens when you cross God when you disobey God when you unbelief God now there's also another little caveat to this because as that brass serpent was on the pole representing sin already judged and divine judgment that when they looked upon it what have we just read here when they looked upon it anyone that was bitten when they looked upon it they would live but the other part of this is that they had to believe what the representation was of that inside they had to believe and accept that atonement if they didn't it meant nothing to them it was just an idol see that's the difference in seeing what an idol is to people and what something is as an inside people sometimes think a cross is an idol or a crucifix ISM I don't know it's not it's an enzyme it's an acknowledgment of the atonement that Jesus made for us that brass serpent on that stick still is represented today in our medical community what do you think that stick with the snakes wrapped around it means that shows in our medical community goes right back to the Bible whether they want to believe it or tonight or what it doesn't matter that right there is identifying the scripture in our country to our medical community as as as it has gotten today it represents this in the Bible sin already judged there it is it brought healing it brought salvation because it's the same thing that Tolman it has to be sis not Idol C it has to be looked upon and believed it has to be looked upon as the atonement as the way of escape if it was looked at just as a simple Idol of some kind they still died it not nothing to that person it had to mean to that person the purpose for what God sent it and if it wasn't then it didn't mean anything to them she understand had to be believed if it's not believed it still means nothing it's just like Jesus we're going to get into in just a minute if it's not believed you can look at a crucifix you can look at a cross you can look at Jesus or go back and reflect and even if you don't see the as the atonement as the standard and is the basis for forgiveness of sin for the absolution by the blood of Christ of our sin that atonement that torment means that a price has been paid the price that was paid for your salvation if you don't believe that that it means nothing Jesus means nothing to you the cross means nothing to you if you don't believe it you have to believe this by faith and not just some nominal belief it's got to be something that becomes a part of you becomes a part of you ix first and Moses made the serpent of brass put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived but he lived by faith he lived because the word became a part of that it became a part of what they believed what they trusted in what they had faith in it became a part of them but it has to be by faith the life that they lived had to be by a life of faith the life that we live today has to be a life of faith now we live in this world we live in the midst of all the germs diseases afflictions people don't worry about that most of the time they're not scared of them I mean people things like cancer and stuff like that people get afraid of and scared and all these so that you don't see the type of reaction like you seen with this coronavirus today I personally think one of the reasons is we've just we've just gotten so far removed from godliness and holiness and faith that it just we've just live in a godless society that's I mean that's pretty blunt but that's just the way I see it you're just looking at a godless society but but nothing wrong with you know people using wisdom but then you got to go back to that that message wisdom versus faith which one do we choose which one do we live by our faith all our faith does is enhance our wisdom amen our faith enhances our wisdom it shouldn't be contradicted to each other they should be complementary to each other but we live in this world today and this virus is out there friends it's out there it's all over the world I I'm sure there's some countries don't have it but of me basically it's all over the world this thing is everywhere so what makes you exempt from it what makes you or anybody else exempt from getting it it's just a matter of fact that that we know that we could be susceptible to it but we also know and believe that God has already made the atonement for it God has already made a way for divine healing to bring us from that point from from the sickness to the health amen you know but even my cancer I mean if God decides for some reason and he wants to take me by cancer or or you or whoever we just praise the Lord if we're not here to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord so even if we leave from here to go there praise the Lord we're in a much better place anyway but the point I'm trying to make here is to show even even in the midst of that judgment God makes a way of escape and even in the midst of judgment God made a way of escape for the believer they can believe and when they got bit by the fiery serpent they didn't die they lived the judgment was still there the Serpent's were still there but God made in the way of escape God introduced and brought in divine healing if you will for those people that when they were bent they didn't die reminds me of when Paul when Paul coming he was preaching and Dudus his Apostleship and his missionary working and he was standing there with barbarians and had his hand out and a snake and ass have come up and bit his hand and he looked at it and of course they all thought the man was the devil and I want to kill him but when they saw that snake bite his hand he looked at it he just shook it off into the fire and just kept preaching to him and they were waiting for him to die knowing how poisonous that snake was he was gonna die in any minute seeing that no effect of all happened whatsoever fiery serpents truckin and no effect to him whatsoever he shakes off in the fire then from then they started calling God at first he were calling the devil and then when the Lord showed a miracle in their presence and him being just shake it off and just keep preaching they begin to think he was gone she see the difference and the effect that it has what's different today it's the effect it's the same effect with us God has already given us a way of escape he's already give us an inoculation we still have divine healing we still have a way of escape now we go to st. John chapter 3 we go to st. John chapter 3 let me let me read a couple of folks to you before we go to the first John chapter 3 look here sort of reiterating what I had said but in look 1963 in Phoenix he said if men come out there just as an idol to look upon that serpent they received nothing but when the true believer amen remember the true belief of the make-believe or unbeliever the true believer now the make believer can have some of that make believer can can muster up sometimes enough faith to be able to enter into that place as well amen not all of them she kind of got almost two groups really because the the make believers kind of get split in half some of them do can actually believe enough to receive what they need and the others just don't but the true believer as well as talking about what I believe you are you a true believer today that that's the dividing line you've got to be a true believer not a make believer not a not a fair weathered believer not a in church believer but a true believer true believer when that true believer come out there and looked upon that serpent with a spiritual revealed truth big man that serpent itself being that it was in the form of a serpent represented sin already judged I'm said in the garden being that sin was judged by God there they seemed sin their unbelief already under judgment from the serpent in the Garden of Eden and the serpent was made out of brass which means divine judgment see the altar was made at a brass brazen altar which the sacrifice was put on and offered upon as divine judgment that sacrifice was made in divine judgment so that it would it would take away or a toll for pay the price for the worshippers wrongdoing or sin and that's what the brass serpent did that's what the brazen altar was for that's what Jesus quiet Christ was raised for when he was lifted up it was for the same purpose it became judgment he took that on our behalf we'll read that here just a minute now but one more rich in mercy also in Phoenix 1965 the man that looked upon the brass serpent just as a priest piece of brass he never would be healed because he didn't have understanding or revelation of what it was not a revelation of what it was you can't have true faith without a revelation because Reb faith is a revelation by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice what was that faith that faith was a revelation Abel knew what it took to be able to be pleasing to God he knew the kind of sacrifice that it took to please the Lord and by faith he offered that was revelation that revelation brought about his faith his faith believed in his revelation said this is it his faith believed it Speight not only believed it but lived it now Saint John chapter 3 verse 14 st. John 3:14 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him believeth in him should not perish but have ever have eternal life for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved so jesus being lifted up as the brass serpent was was that sin already judged it was that atonement that was made it was that price that was paid that when he was lifted up we could look at that and believe see that doesn't make the crucifix the cross Jesus it doesn't make it an idol it makes it an atonement it makes it a way of life it makes it the in Sun the standard by which we believe see Galatians 3 I believe is Galatians recent of course going back to Deuteronomy 21 that that everything that anyone that hangs on a tree whatsoever hangs on a tree is cursed during Deuteronomy says accursed Galatians cursed is every one that hangs on a tree so he was cursed Jesus was cursed I went to hell was who took our sins Jesus was cursed being that atonement the price that he could pay to be able to bring our salvation to us he took our place so we could take his so that he would take our sin so that we could become sinless that was the standard that was the lifting up that was the curse that he on our behalf what that atonement is it means that it took my place then atonement that that sacrifice that insight meant that that was judged for me he was judged for me he took my place so I could become him so when he was lifted up it was the same thing it was Jesus it was that sin whose sin now any men you look in the Garden of Eden and the serpent and the brass serpent but whose sin was being judged here my sin my sin was being judged in Christ because he had no sin he was sinless he was the perfect sinless son of God he had no sin so what sin was being judged at Calvary it was mine because he took my sin on him and thus was judged by it and became a curse for me so I cannot be cursed I'm not cursed today blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin because because he took that sins for us now here again we have to look at this because this is the very most paramount point to understand as Moses lifted up 15th verse doubtless it's still st. John 3:15 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting or eternal life believeth in him there's got to be that measure of faith just like there was with the serpent of the wilderness there's got to be that measure of faith there's got to be that belief if that belief is gone if it's just a matter of saying oh it's a religion oh it's some kind of covering oh it's just a social group we can belong to or it's just the way they do things or and then just go about your normal life and just live however you want this worldly and ungodly as you want to and see there's nothing there there's nothing there there has to be a faith there has to be a belief if there's a faith and a belief and you truly believe then that belief is gonna bring action to your life to want to obey God and obey his word if there's no obedience to God in his word there's no faith you don't believe he is who you say he is if you believe he you believe he is who he you say he is then you're gonna be obedient there's gonna be obedience to the word you're gonna live the life that's according to God's Word not according to your denomination not according to your unbelief seminary or it's what somebody said on a television or televangelists or something no according to this word God's Holy Bible this is the standard this is the standard by which every one of them has to live every one of us have to live but this standard Jesus made that standard he made this standard live he made it right it's true everything from it has to come by it if it doesn't is not a part of this product it's not a part of God if you're not a part of God then what does that make you you're not a believer you can look upon it all you want churches can defy coronavirus all they want print but if you don't have the goods you just bring a reproach I heard the other day that some people churches now and then I'm not you do what you feel led to do of God I would I would never I would never try to question the Holy Ghost leaving in your life that you feel that - do you do that I'm just here to preach the gospel and tell you what the Bible says in 1 the Lord is good on my heart but if you feel whatever the Holy Spirit telling you you do that but when you go back and think about and I heard again this week some people that had defied the orders to stay home head church and that's fine I probably wouldn't have shut down my church doors either toys but they defied that and now the reproach is that a pastor or two and congregation members have now come down and tested positive coronavirus now if you're not a believer in you do this what kind of reproach does that bring on the gospel if you mentor those church doors you believe you have faith you you obey God's Word you're standing on that standard that standard will stand for you it won't it won't bring a reproach it won't show that there's that there's a hypocrite there it'll stir oh that Jesus or daughter or anything that we follow and believe is wrong it'll hold that standard true friend and you'll be its representative and you'll be its standard bearer today you are the standard bearer of this word going on into the world to show that doesn't mean that we don't get sick and things like that I'm not talking about that but we don't want to go and do things that's contrary to say all we we defy this and we defy that and you come down with it come on at this if if the Holy Spirit's moving is God in your life and you got faith there that I'm sorry I just don't believe that's going to happen I believe God's been God will take care of me if you stand upon him his word he'll always do it it's divine healing but now we've got down to the part of faith believe he that believe it it's not just saying oh I believe it's not just saying you know Jesus is God and then that's fine that's good but there's got to be a standard to that and that's the obedience to the word when he says I believe it's got to be more than just your lips that are saying it if you believe you're gonna live it you're gonna act upon it there's got to be a there there's got to be something that backs it up you know isaiah 53:1 says he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon him and by His stripes we are healed if you think about that and you look at what that compounding scripture does for us as individuals today what it reminds me of a scripture I'll get to in in James we can turn to the James chapter 5 probably all know it very well but let's go to James chapter 5 James chapter 5 let's begin with verse 13 James 5:13 look at this now James says if any man if if is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord amen now that's a great scripture a great prescription to go by but look at the compounding of what James is in in my opinion repeating what Isaiah said in chapter 53 look and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him what was the compounding that Jesus did he was wounded for what transgressions well that's not physical healing that spiritual healing our transgressions are our sins our unbelief our transgressing God's Word he was wounded for those sins he was bruised for our iniquities our wrongdoings doing things we we shouldn't are not doing what we should see bruised for our iniquities the chastisement our peace upon and by His stripes now we are what healed healed so it follows along with James reading that the prayer of the faith shall save the sick the prayer of faith now prayer faith can't just be a regular old just bow your head and say some words it's got to be a prayer of faith it's got to be a prayer of revelation of God's Word when we read that quote here see when that when that one looked upon that serpent would spiritually revealed truth revelation of what it meant of what it was who Jesus is they did by the brass serpent we do by what we look to Jesus for now we don't look at a brass serpent we look to Jesus we see in our medical field the pole of the Serpent's on it that's just a recognition recognize a recognition of divine healing back in the scripture supernatural healing one person it would bite they die next person you bite they'd live you explain to this God but it's gotta be by faith the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise them up the city amen that's healing and if he committed sin they shot the sins shall be forgiven young the prayer of faith think about the power of prayer and the power of your prayers if you have the prayer of faith that save the sick and forgive sin 16th verse this is the hardest part probably one of the hardest outside of maybe tithes and offerings when it comes to finances and a lot of times not everybody but in a lot of ways this is one of the hardest scriptures people have confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now it says confess your faults doesn't say confess your sins it says confess your faults say brothers just try have a I have a hard time with the spirit would you pray for me not I killed someone I buried him in the desert or I'm not talking we're not talking about sins we're talking about falls shortcomings the struggles people have with with certain sins and certain demons Devils of certain kinds that come into our lives if we all have them I mean everybody has a weak spot you know some people have problems with alcohol some people have problems with blonds some people have problems gambling obesity there's all kinds of things that's out there they say help me to keep from struggling on this is a fault I have pray for me that I overcome this devil amen right so and then at the end it says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth lunch before God now that man is humanity of course doesn't have to be a male/female to as we talked about on mother's day I don't believe there's any other prayer that avails to God any more than a mother's prayer for children that's my opinion you know can't be just scripture on that one but that's my opinion but the effectual fervent prayer the effectual that is a powerful prayer one that is has a lot of faith behind it fervent is passionate and and and burning prayer means you have a desire see so it's a burning desire that has faith and and and power behind it available before God of a righteous man a holy man a person with a faith see in availeth months before God because the lights Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are we know the things that Elijah did in his life from the power and the things that happened in alliances life thinking he was a man subject to like passions just as we are I mean my goodness you meant come off a Mount Carmel with winning the Mount Carmel showdown he goes and runs from one woman he goes and hides under a tree and that begs got to kill him it's just God I'm all these are dead around me and I'm the only one left I got seven thousand and having Beldon about the need to bail yet you don't know nothing about get up mountain of that tree go go about your business but God took care of him see but he was a man of subject to like passions just as we are but he prayed earnestly that might not rain and rain not on the earth by the space of three years and six months my goodness you get 40 days around in Tucson without rain and I started getting antsy myself but anyway and he prayed again and the heavens gave rain and the earth brought forth forth her fruit brethren if if any of you do err from the truth and one convert and let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save the soul from death and the soul and shall hide a multitude of sanim amen that's what prevails before God she look at today well close your just a minute you look at today what we're dealing with you look at the scripture see what they were dealing with they begin to murmur complain so God sent judgment down and then they repented and God didn't take away the judgment but he made a way of escape what is our way of escape today we're living in a world of judgment we've talked about that the warning has come I believe there's still warnings because we're still here there's still warnings but judgment is also falling upon this wicked and adulterous layout in age and we know that we're in the middle of judgment so if we're in the middle of judgment that judgment that sin has to be judged we're in the middle of a sinful war that sin has to be judged well who's judged it's still here even though we're here even though the bride is here I say we in reference to God's children I don't mean me or my family but I mean God's children international old wide you're watching this when you consider yourself one of them then praise the Lord you're one of them so awesome time we as in believer we're still here in the middle of the judgment God's not taking it from us he's just giving us the way of escape he's just give us through the atonement of Jesus Christ that we looked to that cross we look to Calvary now when I had to physically look to a crucifix or cross nothing wrong with that you can do that if you'd like but it's the faith that you have when you're all alone and there's no one around when you don't have church when you don't have this one or that one he's still there it's still there he's still with us he's still the atonement so regardless of any of that we can still look to him and believe for healing divine healing now if they if they come up with a vaccination or a cure for this or whatever fine and dandy if they do that's fine as they go I believe they probably will I don't think this is the end-all to everything I've told you that mentioned that again last week I don't think this is the end of everything everybody so many people keep talking about how this coronavirus and the end and all this we don't need a coronavirus tell us we're living in the end times you're a bride members Saints you know you're living in the end times we know we're at the end it's just just part of it I think it's more control thing anything but again watching myself that's what I say but anyway it's not any different to me then what they did if even if that thing were to come and bite you even if that thing were to come and bite me we to have the faith to believe God's gonna in the work of the Lord doing God's bidding in your life being led by his Spirit God is obligated to take care of you if something does happen or come about I believe I believe divine healing still in place friend God will take care of us amen God will take care of us now in look the way to Jesus my last quote today and look away to Jesus December 1963 Israel looked at the brass serpent that Moses made and saw the suffering of Christ for the judgment for the sick amen that's what we're looking at today but again that that atonement played two parts it was for the healing of the body but also the healing of the soul it was for the salvation of the soul as well as it was for the healing of the body that atonement saw the suffering of Christ for the judgement for the sick for we know that the serpent spoke of the atonement Jesus was that atonement he was that price paid to redeem us back to him as Moses lifted up the brass serpent the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up for the same purpose why they had sinned and had got sick that was for the taking away of their sins and for their sickness praise the Lord there is your atonement does the same thing today it is for our soul and it is for physical sickness God makes a way of escape I hope you can see that the parallel that I did when the Lord showed this to me even though I had gone through this brass serpent before when you showed me this in comparison of what's going on today I thought of mine that's that's just it's just perfect to me and it's just right on and it enhances by today's world and the way things going the fact that we are at the end was the taking away of their sins for their sickness and that is what Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed they divine healing away from Christ you cut the atonement in half but we don't take it away from Christ because he it is him it is a part of who he is but when you see the comparison look at the faith that there has to be we talked about James we just read the prayer of faith can look over in Matthew you can see how mark 16 and laid hands on the sick they shall recover and all those are outstanding scriptures that we have but you know the best example of faith for Gentile faith not Jew faith not Jewish faith faith as the people here as God had them the atonement but the faith of the Gentile you look at this interior and in Matthew 8 I've spoken on it many times but brother Branham pointed to it many times as the Gentile faith what is the Gentile faith the Gentile faith is I don't need you and I'm not worthy that you come under my roof you just speak the word Jesus you speak the word cause Jesus was willing to come to the man's house and the Centurion said no I'm not worthy I bet you come under my roof you have subjects to come and go I have subjects they come and go but you just speak the word and by the authority on this the ones that I have that I speak to that they have to obey my voice that they come and go they got to do what I tell them well your subjects Jesus when you speak to them they've got to come they've got to go they've got to do whatever you say so you just speak the word and my servant will be well because the ones that's made him sick they're subject to you in all just think about the demons and demonic spirits that are subject to the bride of Jesus Christ for today you speak the word you have the faith to say it is it is fit in Jesus name it's it's done it's a finished work you are the standard bearer for today by your faith in believing that Centurion said you speakin and those that make my servants sick will have to obey what you say because there are subjects of yours are under your subjection anyway Jesus spoke the word actually Jesus spending his faith word he just told the center he said I've never seen faith like this no I'm not in anywhere not in Israel anywhere I've never seen this kind of thing you go home and find your servant well your servant owe me well when you get home hey how simple how simple but it's not for everybody you know it's for the believer it's only for the believer when the believer looked at it he was healed because he recognized the atonement he recognized the price that was paid for him even Jesus disciples in Matthew 17 and they were going about twist you God Jesus gave them power in Matthew 10 to go heal the sick and raise the dead and do all these great miracles and things and sent to the children house visceral and they come back rejoicing all the the Devils are subject unto us unto your name and things and he said don't rejoice at that but rejoice because your name is written in heaven cuz of course Jesus was there and his name wasn't there and he was out praying for them and getting healed and all those like the rest of them Judas was remember he was justified and sanctified so all these works were working in his life but when he come to being able to go and receive the Holy Ghost and the furtherance of Christ he hung himself so Christ out hung himself so he couldn't go but then when Jesus said that Matthew 17 they run across a lunatic boy and they couldn't heal him and the man of the boy comes and said and come to Jesus said I asked your disciples and they prayed and prayed they can't do anything for him could you please help my son because somebody's falls in the fire he falls in the water and I'm scared he's gonna kill himself Jesus looked at his own disciples and said o faithless and perverse generation how long to be with you how long are you gonna live like this and add this lack of faith oh but sometimes I think Saints a duck looks and says sometimes the same things does how long it's just simple faith it's just simple simply believing you know brother Roger does the mark 16 prayer line lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you come through the prayer line don't say a word necessarily this lay hands them don't pray for me let me go through how many healings have have manifested what was its faith its faith believe me the hands is just a point of contact but if you can have faith to believe that's all it takes faith to believe that's what if they needed in the wilderness when they looked at the brass serpent that's what we need today when we look at our torment when we look at our torment Jesus Christ it just takes pure unadulterated unfettered faith what he's done already for us because a God early God's already guilty God save me God's already saved you you just come to the reckon recognition that God is already built God has already saved you everything he needs to do for you is already done so we believe even though we're living in the middle of judgment God has already sent an atonement garden God has already sent the way of escape amen we just believe it just believe it Amen praise the lord god bless you today pray something was said to bless and strengthen you amen just trust the lord hold true to it and we'll just believe in being contact through the week and maybe again next week i'll see you about during the week we got a couple jobs coming up and things we'll see during the week if I have a little message I can't do too long of a message on my phone because it takes so long to upload doing a doing 18 20 minute little a sermon end that that I upload to the drive for Micah to put on the website takes over an hour hour and a half just to get it off my phone onto the drive so it'd take probably four hours if I did a message like this on there so but pray the Lord bless you and God really keep you in his hands amen let's just bow our heads for word of Prayer Lord we thank you for what you've done for us today we thank you for your hand up mercy and love upon us god I pray that you continue to be with our congregation and keep them in your protective care watch over
