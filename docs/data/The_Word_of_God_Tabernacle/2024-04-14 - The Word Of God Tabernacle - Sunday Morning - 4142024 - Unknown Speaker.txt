how you doing doing great doing great really yeah let me tell you amen Sunday praise God I'm so glad I'm I'm going testify to my work for tomorrow amen now you know people believe what they want to believe but it's my testimony and it's the truth so people can believe what they want but by God's grace amen Psalms 110 now we'll read the first verse the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol then you can be seated if you'd like amen I want to go over to Acts chapter 2 reading from there as well this one uh this one spiritual utterance that David gave is recorded many times several times uh in in almost to a te and in other ways uh all through the new script uh the New Testament amen testifying of Jesus Christ amen God the Father lord lord said unto my Lord Jesus amen sit thou on my right hand praise the Lord until what until all the all your enemies amen which is what the devil amen is your foot stol now if his enemy is a devil what's our enemy amen if the enemy is under his feet were they to us under our feet praise the Lord hence my servant today your enemy is under your feet praise God your enemy is under your feet I've had this uh written down somewhere I ran across it yesterday for a long time now amen and I looked at it and I thought Lord that that would just be that was really what burning in my heart amen the enemy is under my feet praise the Lord Acts chapter 2 amen let's read from here we're going to read a few of these amen look at this something help hopefully to build our faith amen hopefully to build our faith something that we can look to we know the word bring to our remembrance amen What the Lord Has Done For Us amen and doing amen not past tense but doing right now he's still a Healer Saints you believe that yes he's still deliverers amen he's still the same God Amen only thing has changed is us only thing has changed is time and people and all this other has changed amen you know I heard that uh that Arizona had voted to go back to until something else is done as far as what they call abortion I call it uh uh Fetti murder but they can call it abortion all they want that's just to lighten up the fact that they're murdering unborn children so vle murder is my uh the way I phrase it so they're going back to the 1800s and people are mad and saying that Arizona is taking us back to the Civil War times or whatever they said Civil War time I said well that's funny it was fine then what changed amen if it was right then it should be right now just because people have changed and time changed doesn't mean what's doing right has changed right amen if it was right then it's right now still the same praise the Lord if it was wrong then it's wrong now but they act like because time has gone on that it's okay now we have advancements we the advant the advant advancements of that specific subject have led us to understand that it's worse now than it was then because they know now that when when they say life begins we know when it begins but when they say it begins amen they hear the heartbeat and and the movements and feelings and those the thoughts and things that that a fetus has they know that more now than they did back then praise the Lord but if it was wrong then it's wrong now yes the only thing that's changed is people it's us ideas thoughts opinions well we progressed yeah we progressed where that's the sad part we progressed into denying God and rejecting anything that's right moral and ethical amen but now let's go to acts acts chap 2:33 I'm sure y'all know by now I am not a proponent of abortion or called Murder amen call it uh acts uh 233 let's let's start with 32 this Jesus ha God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted by the right listen to this now because there are people that actually literally believe that Jesus is at God God is sitting there on a throne like we are here he's sitting there on a throne just like this and then Jesus is sitting right there by his right hand or in some places the Bible says on his left hand what that doesn't even make any Common Sense much l by revelation we understand what that right hand is and you don't have to necessarily have the revelation of what the right hand is because the Bible tells us what it is and it is right here therefore being by the right hand of God exalted amen it's a position of power it's a position of authority being at the right hand is a position of Power Authority that God gave to Jesus Christ amen amen to sit at his right hand or be it that place of authority amen we're going to read some more a little bit later amen just again stir up our remembrance having received uh right hand of God right hand of God exalted and he should be exalted in our lips every day amen amen and having received by the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost those he has shed forth this which you now see and hear for David is not listen now for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself amen but we know how he sayth under the inspiration of course of the spirit of God the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand amen even from someone who has has been explained here that has not ascended unto heaven but now has ascended to Heaven through the blood of Jesus Christ he had not as that time ascended because he had not you could not be under the blood of bulls goats and cows and heers and uh of of the blood of animals it had to be be the blood of Jesus Christ that was sufficient enough to bring all those that were uh uh that were Gods back then to be raised up and to be able to ascend with him amen so him even David saying the Lord said to my Lord sit down on my right hand until praise God I make thy foes thy foot stol and that's what we looking for amen amen all the enemy we we use it plal of course but that's just the spread of the devil the one enemy we have is the devil amen thy foes become thy foot stol praise the Lord your foes the thing that you that you worry about the most in life the things that come against you the most in life the things that give you the most trouble in your spirit in your body in your mind those things have become your foot stol they are under your feet understand Saints amen there's a song that um um some very dear friends of mine back in North Carolina used to sing in the in the title is under his feet I thought about singing it but I just didn't remember at all but a lot of the chorus goes when the waves are over your head remember they're under his feet praise the Lord kind of reminds me of the song that sister green used to sing it said from Heaven's point of view that big mountain you're looking at is not even a hill to him amen when you look at it from a different perspective when you look at it from a different point of view you can see that it's not what the devil makes it out to be am but he tries to Li likes to try to scare you amen make you fear fear takes away your faith amen fear and worry takes away your faith right Faith brings us to the understanding that all these things have nothing to do with me they're under my feet my enemies are my foot stol praise the Lord look now uh let me finish reading this uh until I make th foes thy foot stol therefore all the house of Israel know assuredly that God ha made that same Jesus whom he crucified both Lord and Christ Lord and Christ he is the ruler and he is the anointed one he is the anointed ruler praise the lord well who anointed him God did amen who made him in charge God did Hallelujah he become Lord amen and now he is our Lord if we believe he is our Lord he now has become both Lord and Christ let's go to Matthew Matthew chapter 17 let's read a few verses Matthew 17 some of you may already recognize no going amen Matthew 171 praise the Lord and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John's brother bringeth them up to a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun his rment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias take talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here he recognized with something special going on Amen it is good for us to be here if thou wi let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one and one for Moses and one for Elias but while he yet spake Behold a bright cloud cloud overshadowed them amen not the bright Sun now but a bright Cloud remember that same Cloud that followed the children of Israel amen same Cloud I believe that struck uh uh uh Saul down off his horse and they spoke to him I am Jesus whom now persecutest that cloud overshadow them and behold a voice out of the cloud a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him Jesus received in his Corporal body received his placement into this body amen into the body amen the body that we now know as the body of Christ it is the mystical body of Jesus Christ of whom we are parts of Praise the Lord that make that we make up God himself saying this is my son what is happening Saints it's like a man who has a company and his son has showed himself worthy and his son comes up and he comes before the entire company and he said my son has proved him himself worthy my son has proved himself to know everything about there is to know in here and he showed that he knows exactly what to do and how to run this company I now therefore transfer my authority and power of this company to my son now you listen to him praise the Lord amen not that the not not that the that the dad's voice doesn't have weight obviously but the transfer of that authority to sit on the right hand of authority that transfer of authority happened as God gave it and said now you listen to him hear ye him he is now Lord yes praise God he is now ruler he is now the one in charge you hear him listen to what he tells you praise God now he is Lord what is he had done made all the enemies amen all of our enemies are foot stol all of our enemies are foot stol when the Devil comes at you don't don't plead with him don't beg with him don't don't you can acknowledge Him if you want just enough to say get out of here but that's it don't even acknowledge his existence Satan has nothing to do with the child of God those Devils have nothing to do with me they have nothing to do with you amen now the Lord may allow certain things to happen for certain reasons a lot of times we may not understand that but God is always there to bless us and help and bring us through he is Lord we listen to him we obey his word amen I don't obey the word of William brandom I don't obey the word of any great man I love their words I love of course from the word of God they're preaching and all but I I I listen to God Almighty I try to obey Jesus Christ what Jesus tells me to do is what I have tried all my life that since I surrender to him that I could do I try to do amen I many times failed miserably I'm sure we all have to a point but we try to do the best we can to the detriment of even our own thoughts even our own ideas even even the things we want to do yes amen the places we want to live amen the the the the places we want want to go we don't know why God does certain things certain ways but we just try to follow him where he leads us CU he's what he's the Lord amen he is our Lord all the enemy is under our feet because of him because he has made us more than conquerors he has conquered made us more than conquerors praise the lord it's like that story that I can't remember maybe brother green told I heard it years and years ago of the great Boxer that was trained uh to box and he was strong and he was fit and he worked out got up at 4:00 every morning and drunk 12 raw eggs every morning and uh uh did things that were uncomfortable to him and ate things he didn't like and uh did things that he didn't maybe necessarily want to do but he had to get strong he had to get fit he had to get uh ready for the battle because the guy on the other side of the ring is is probably trading as hard as he is guys he's training hard and he gets himself into Peak condition he gets faster he gets stronger he gets more uh able to take care of his opponent and when they come together in the ring he knocks the man out he stands there Victorious he conquered he destroyed the enemy he laid the enemy outsight and so he walks out of that ring and the promoter hands him a check 10 million he goes home he's all happy he's Joy he's thankful all the sacrifice all that he did gave himself bloody beaten bruised swollen he goes up to his wife and his wife puts his hand her hand up there's the million amen she didn't train she didn't fight she didn't get bloody beaten of course now a good wife would have been there with him all the step all wait but she didn't do she didn't she didn't have to go in the ring and even get bloody beaten and swollen but but she was a beneficiary of what her husband had done praise the lord we are beneficiaries we didn't have to go to Calvary right we didn't have to hang in shame we didn't have to get beat bloodied and and drained of our blood to the backbone showed through we didn't have to go in shame and hang there in the most horrible death that human has has ever uh uh suffered before but we now enjoy the benefits amen we enjoy the benefit of all of what Jesus Christ did for us he gave to us amen part of that is understanding that all the enemy that comes against you Saints has is no match for you you understand that all the Satan can bring before you is no match to you zero they're under your feet amen there there are no match Jesus now God putting in Jesus hands look let's go back over Matthew 17 uh the end of the fifth verse this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and he hadn't even gone to Calvary yet but he saw the submissiveness the willingness CU everything that he learned he learned through obedience all all the obedience he learned he learned through suffering amen praise the Lord and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and tou him and said arise Be not Afraid and when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead there testifying to them Jesus he there would raise again from the dead solidifying our Easter sermon and even our last week what we talked about they knew Jesus had already told them they man may try to put me in the grave and no doubt I'm sure Satan celebrated when he thought he had him amen never realizing that he was conquered death hell and the grave praise the Lord let's go over to Matthew chapter 28 read a couple of verses here amen Matthew chapter 28 uh let's start with Verse 18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power here we go now sitting on the right hand my Lord the Lord said to my Lord sit ye here speaking of the deity of Jes Jesus Christ amen all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth praise the Lord hear ye him that was God's exclamation hear ye him all power given unto him in heaven and in Earth now he's given instruction by the authority and power that he has he's given instruction to his disciples to go ye with which I am one of I wasn't standing here in a Corporal body at this time but I am here as one of his disciples now telling me to go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost which is we know is the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord the Lord Jesus Christ teaching them to observe all things what ever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even until the end of the world Amen a command from what from the Lord the Lord said the Lord said go and do this teaching them showing them helping them to understand that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost that they are to be taught to understand now do you think Peter understood did those that that instruction sure he did because when they come out on the day of Pentecost Peter said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen he understood the instruction wasn't to say and of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost like there's three of them there's only one the Lord Jesus Christ God almighty teaching them praise the Lord that's exactly what Peter did on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came down them he went forth teaching them repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord and that promises to us and to them whoever many is God will sin it's not my decision to determine who will and who won't that's God's determination he's the one who says is and is it not me praise the Lord now let's go over to First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 15 prise The Lord thank you Jesus In Christ Alone amen Christ Al will our glory amen First Corinthians chapter 15 let's begin with verse 20 1 Corinthians 15:20 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all died even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put uh put down all Rule and all authority and power praise the Lord for he must Reign till he had put all enemies under his feet another part now this isn't exactly the way David had said it like uh Matthew Mark Luke uh uh said but this is another variation of that exact same phrase that David Again David a man who hadn't even as they said as act said ascended into heaven proclaimed the Lord said unto my Lord set down my right hand until all the enemies become my foot stol praise the Lord here it is Saints for he must rain till he put all enemies under his feet praise God now look thing there's when when Jesus Christ died he rose again conquering death went death couldn't hold him he went to hell hell couldn't hold him the grave couldn't hold him the stone was rolled back he resurrected death hell and the grave were conquered and then when he did and then in the Conquering what did he tell the the spokesman of the group at the time Peter he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven and said Peter whatsoever you bound on Earth is bound on he in heaven whatsoever you loosed on Earth is loosed in heaven why that is the character of God with the power of God amen amen because remember uh the power of God without the character of God is satanic yes amen but the power of God with the character of God is godliness it's Holiness it's righteousness it's God moving through his people in the capacity that God would do if he were yet here in a Corporal body yes because he uses us to do it yes amen making all enemies putting all enemies under his feet now you have the keys praise the Lord Jesus has conquered all things but now in Christ he has given unto us all things yes now you possess it it belongs to you it is ours we probably don't utilize it to the capacity that we should brother bam said many times we fall so far below our privileges we live so far below our privileges where we should live where we should be amen we live so far below God help us to understand this belongs to us this is our inher inance this is what God gave to us freely gave to us it's like I said God wants to give it to you more than you even want it yes God helped me to receive it to believe and accept right under my feet all enemies under my feet that includes death hell and the grave praise the Lord The Last Enemy though Listen Now The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death amen for he had put all things under his feet but when he say all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is accepted which put all things under him being accepted of course of the Lord being made Lord uh of God being made Lord he now has given to us The Last Enemy to be conquered is death now look death was the greatest if I can say it this way death was the greatest victory that Satan had death was from the Garden of Eden when he caused the Fall In the Garden of Eden death became the greatest tool that the devil had death because even he knew if all these people were even to serve God he still had them in the clutches of death and every man up to Jesus Christ has died amen everyone every one of us everybody if God doesn't come we're all going to go that way yes amen but the good thing is Saints it can't hold me yes it's like anything that might come Saints Satan tries to torment you or try to bring something it cannot hold you you don't belong to it you are not his property you don't belong to the devil you belong to God Amen you're God's inheritance God has done all this to make a way for you to be able to receive it accept it and become it and live it so you don't have to delve or suffer into into into those things of uh of the devil death has been conquered Saints the The Last Enemy to be destroyed is death there'll be a time I don't know if I'll be one of them I may go by the way of the grave but there'll be a group of people who will overcome and Conquer and not taste death right I hope I'm one of them I believe we're close enough that I'll be one of them but I don't know we don't any of us know but we do know there will be a group that will not taste death yes the final conquering which brings about to it the Redemption of our bodies the full adoption that God has called us to be yes amen that true child of God death will be conquered amen not only will be there'll be a group of people who will not taste death all those that have gone on before will God bring up with them to be to together to meet the Lord in the air every one of them amen they cannot be the grave cannot hold them praise the Lord I heard I heard that old song I've heard since I was just a boy since I was a kid Ain't No Grave Gonna Hold My Body Down Ain't No Grave can't hold this body down I'm going to come up from the ground I forgot some of the words but There Ain't No Grave amen No Grave can hold this body down amen praise the Lord we're going to resurrect amen because death Can't Hold You grave can't hold you all the enemies that Satan has brought forth can hold you amen even the greatest stronghold that Satan managed through through this Humanity through this Earth through this time through US humans to live the greatest stronghold that he's even had will be conquered completely conquered amen no longer be able to hold the child of God look Saints you have been made more than conquerors God has made you God has given to you everything that you need to overcome to go beyond to to to conquer yourself amen Faith believe there's nothing Satan can do to you first of all as a child of God that God doesn't already know but that you hav't already conquered nothing not one thing mental physical emotional Financial spiritual whatever it might be not one thing that Satan can do that has not already been conquered you just believe it praise the Lord just believe it one more scripture here Ephesians chapter 1 amen just remember all under your feet amen amen all under your feet Ephesians chapter 1 let's read a few verses of scripture here before we close Ephesians 1:19 amen and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power We Believe believe it according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and have put all things praise the Lord under his feet now that's us under our feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all amen praise God we now are his filled with his Spirit living his word over overcome conquered everything that Satan's tried to do everything that Satan tries to continue to do and don't get me wrong he's not going to stop Satan he does not as much as we would like him to he is not going to stop he is a Relentless foe even though he knows he has lost he is a Relentless foe but greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world we have have already conquered him we have already conquered everything that Satan tries to throw at us even the things that we haven't even gotten to death Hell In The Grave even the things that Satan continues to try to bring God has already given it to us amen amen praise the Lord God has already blessed us with this bring to me to mind sister matis had something happen the other day and I want us to pray and believe that the Lord's going to return to Sister mati what belongs to her amen it's happened many times I mean how many stories I've heard of several stories of of things in this situation someone would take and the Lord would show well it's over here this is this is where it is go get it amen belongs to you you go get it amen I believe that amen I I God is more than able to do that yes praise the Lord and things that mean something to us things that are important to us things that are significant in our lives yes we hold together as a group of individuals as a group of Believers I I why it's so important I believe and we stay in contact with each other and have a prayer chain and just and trust the Lord and know that God is moving in our group yes yes God is answering prayers yes amen he's delivering he's blessing he can do the same thing in every in in every circumstance Satan has no right the devil has no right to anything that belongs to me now everything happens for a reason amen we know it does somebody could have done this for sister mati for her to go get her bike back and witness to that person you never know and she would be the person to do it you just never know God does things for a reason we don't understand so why would this have happened to me don't know but God does and do you trust him well if you trust him then you believe that he's doing it for our good whatever it is yes amen amen I don't understand it God knows yes there's a purpose behind it all and we most of us at least are seasoned enough in the Lord to recognize that it's just the road we walk it's the life we live amen it's happen all of us it'll continue till we continue to press forward and and and leave this world but as it does as remember we preached a few weeks ago a couple months ago the enemy comes in like a flood amen God raises the standard against you praise the Lord when the waves are over your head you got to remember they're under his feet Yes praise the Lord but now they're not just under his feet they're under your feet you might feel like the wave is overcome you amen but he is under your Fe praise the Lord amen we need to pray um Shai text me earlier and had mentioned that they've had some struggle because uh of dealing with the situation that's going on at home and they've fallen behind on some bills so please pray the Lord Make A Way amen God manifest somehow to them the need that they have to to overcome this situation because now Art's out of work and she's had to miss some work so um it's struggling today like we said last week uh 75 80% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck for when a paychecks gone what do you do yeah amen things get left off and not paid and it makes life even that much more difficult amen but we're going to believe together amen God is in God is going to bless and help bring through amen again as I said had some pretty dark times I think we've all had some pretty dark times in our lives but we know the Lord has brought us out of every one of them and blessed us I I I am I am personally blessed beyond measure that I can't even begin to explain I just give him thanks for it amen just give him thanks praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen Satan is trying to do everything he can to disrupt the things that the Lord is doing and honestly a lot of people try to make a move towards God and their life gets rough and they they turn around and say wellow you know I I should have never done this to begin with you know that's the best sign in the world you've got that God is with you yes because like we said a few weeks ago the devil wouldn't work anybody who's already got amen why please allow us personality why would I if I had a player let's just say the best basketball player in the world on my team why would I go recruit that player it would be worthless for me to go spend my time trying to convince this person to come be on my team when they're already on my team yes that would make no sense it's fruitless to do why would Satan try to recruit someone that he's already got on his team why would he work at making things so hard and so difficult amen and and and like we said the other day Arts from what I've seen recently he's tried so hard he's said he'd been reading the Bible more and uh uh going to people to try to make sure that there's nothing wrong and no problems that's just the thing the devil hates the most yes amen he's going to fight even harder against that yes praise the Lord but that's when you buckle up yes amen that's when you say get behind me Satan yes amen get thou behind me you have no right to me you have no right to my home you have no right to my family praise the Lord and you stand your ground because you know that if if he had you he wouldn't care that's why I've said before when people go about disobey the word and things are all nice and gushy and great that worries me amen cuz uh because things should be getting rougher amen amen it should be getting harder cuz Satan's going to fight everything he can fight until this thing is over amen and by God's grace I believe it is almost over just as brother Danny had his prayer you see the thing happening in Israel again now it's stirring up again Saints yes amen that fiig tree's been in bloom for how many years now close to 70 years I know that's not a long time in God's economy but that's been a long time for us yes we don't know what we're looking to seeing things that's going on my mind Lord some comments even by our president against Israel God help us I know that they're coming to Israel's defense now and that's good I'm glad of that but we don't know how much longer we've got amen Lord
