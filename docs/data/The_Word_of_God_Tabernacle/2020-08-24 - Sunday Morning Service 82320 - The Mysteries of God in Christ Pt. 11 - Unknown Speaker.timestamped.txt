[5:28] perfectly
[5:29] done and lord may your hand be upon it
[5:31] god as i committed to you now
[5:33] lord in the name of the lord jesus
[5:35] christ we pray amen
[5:38] and god bless you we want to go right to
[5:41] the scripture now if we could
[5:42] uh and in the scripture again we're uh
[5:45] getting into the mysteries of god in
[5:47] christ part 11
[5:48] uh and god having preeminence in his
[5:52] people part three and
[5:53] uh as we have been as we begin this uh
[5:56] part of the teaching you wanna go
[5:58] to revelation chapter ten verse seven so
[6:00] let's just read that again if we could
[6:02] revelation 10
[6:03] 7 uh to begin this but in the days of
[6:06] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[6:07] shall begin
[6:08] the sound the mystery of god should be
[6:10] finished as he is declared to his
[6:12] servants the prophets now i think we've
[6:14] laid quite a foundation to understand
[6:16] that mystery is jesus christ and who
[6:18] jesus
[6:19] christ is and the revelation of jesus
[6:21] christ and that and
[6:22] we found that in what we see here and
[6:25] through the scripture and
[6:26] and trusting god's hand upon that but we
[6:29] go over
[6:30] and of course we're talking about god
[6:33] having the preeminence in his people
[6:37] and for some reason it looks like the
[6:39] streaming's still
[6:41] uh messing up a little bit i i just
[6:43] don't understand i got the
[6:44] uh full internet going in all this time
[6:47] so um
[6:48] i'm not sure why it's not receiving
[6:50] enough video but
[6:51] anyway we're gonna keep plowing on and
[6:54] the colossians chapter
[6:56] one as we've read from about this
[6:58] preeminence as we read
[6:59] the last couple of weeks i just want to
[7:01] again read the seventh 18th and 19th
[7:04] verses
[7:05] as as we again draw our context for this
[7:08] subtext
[7:09] and he is before all things by him all
[7:12] things consist or stand
[7:14] and he jesus christ is the head of the
[7:17] body
[7:17] the church and that's what we've been
[7:19] majoring on last week
[7:20] probably get into a little more this
[7:22] week uh
[7:24] the head of the body the church who is
[7:26] the beginning the firstborn from the
[7:28] dead
[7:28] that in all things he might have the
[7:31] preeminence again
[7:32] not just his bride although that's what
[7:34] we're majoring on and talking about but
[7:36] in all things
[7:38] uh we'll get to a point here we see in
[7:39] romans 8 where
[7:41] all of creation groaning waiting for the
[7:43] manifestation the sons of god see that
[7:45] in
[7:45] all things he would have preeminence
[7:49] uh they might have the previous word to
[7:51] please the father that in him
[7:53] should all fullness dwell now that
[7:55] priming
[7:56] a preeminence in that head ship is
[7:58] exactly what we talked about last week
[8:00] now i don't know how much of this
[8:02] got through last week with our
[8:03] difficulties in the streaming and all
[8:05] but
[8:05] well background just a little bit of
[8:06] course usually when i go through this
[8:08] we'll back down a little bit from last
[8:10] week
[8:10] and uh get a little bit of the
[8:12] highlights before we move on for this
[8:14] week
[8:14] but uh i want to want to again reiterate
[8:17] the the fact that the headship that was
[8:20] jesus christ and
[8:21] him being the head and him being the
[8:24] head of course makes him that figurative
[8:26] head he's not our literal head upon our
[8:28] shoulders
[8:28] but remember something as little and
[8:32] figuratively or an adjective as
[8:35] in the head of something or someone who
[8:37] has domain or dominion over someone or
[8:39] some
[8:40] group of people just like the body is a
[8:43] literal
[8:43] you can look at my head literally you
[8:45] can look at my body literal
[8:46] body's also an adjective or figurative
[8:49] or there's large groups of people or
[8:51] large
[8:52] uh gathering of water is called a body
[8:55] of water so
[8:56] we recognize those two things but as he
[8:59] is the head
[9:00] being that head he is the head of the
[9:03] church
[9:04] he is the head of uh uh of all things
[9:08] of of his church and of course in that
[9:10] he has the preeminence
[9:12] he is the head of the body the church
[9:15] amen so he is our head
[9:17] praise the lord so we're thankful god is
[9:19] our head
[9:20] so now we go from there go back to as we
[9:23] read this
[9:24] uh the other day and getting into
[9:27] remember there's several places in the
[9:29] scripture that refers to this
[9:30] of course jesus referred to it and
[9:32] matthew mark luke
[9:34] talked about luke last week for a moment
[9:36] but of course david you go all the way
[9:37] back to psalms 118
[9:39] and david prophesying about jesus christ
[9:42] uh talking about the cheap cornerstone
[9:44] or the
[9:45] the stone that was laid not those that
[9:48] were rejected by the builders
[9:51] the builders now in acts chapter four
[9:53] we'll pick this up again
[9:55] real quick and go through this in acts
[9:58] chapter four
[10:00] uh we want to begin we're reading with
[10:02] verse eight then peter
[10:04] this is after the impotent man was
[10:06] healed
[10:07] uh peter in the name of the lord jesus
[10:09] then peter filled with the holy ghost
[10:11] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[10:14] and elders of
[10:14] israel if we this day be examined of the
[10:18] good deed done to the impotent man by
[10:20] what means he is made whole
[10:22] be it known unto you all and to all the
[10:26] people of israel that by the name of
[10:28] jesus christ of nazareth
[10:30] whom ye crucified whom god raised from
[10:33] the dead
[10:34] even by him dot this man stand here
[10:36] before you
[10:37] whole amen again peter was not ashamed
[10:41] to declare
[10:42] jesus christ anymore he stands before
[10:44] you hold this is
[10:46] jesus christ is the stone
[10:49] which was said it not of you builders
[10:52] which has become the head of the corner
[10:54] again for just a moment that stone
[10:58] jesus christ remember we're going to
[11:00] read the scripture again where he talks
[11:02] about that stone is the
[11:03] foundation of the church that it was
[11:05] being built upon
[11:07] he is that stone which was said it not
[11:10] now remember again
[11:11] not is to be rejected or despised
[11:14] or deplorable unwanted
[11:19] so when something comes and you put it
[11:21] at not
[11:22] that means that you discard it you do
[11:24] not regard it in any way
[11:27] it has no value to you so what peter is
[11:29] saying that you took and you crucified
[11:32] the one by whom the name on me that i
[11:36] spoke
[11:36] made this man whole you put him aside
[11:39] you put him at
[11:40] not you rejected him see so he said you
[11:44] put them at not of you builders now
[11:46] again what is that builders he's talking
[11:48] about
[11:48] that builders is the ones he's saying
[11:50] that you are the religious
[11:52] leaders you are the priests you are the
[11:54] pastors you are the ministers you are
[11:56] the ones
[11:57] that are supposed to be laying having
[11:59] that foundation laid which is jesus
[12:01] christ
[12:02] to build that church upon you're the
[12:05] ones to bring the word to those people
[12:07] you are the ones to preach the gospel to
[12:09] those people
[12:10] and you are the builders of getting
[12:12] those people built or edified
[12:14] to a place of being a part of the body
[12:16] of jesus christ
[12:18] built and edified and and grow
[12:21] in the lord to make that building to
[12:24] make those people
[12:25] a place inhabitable of jesus christ
[12:28] see they were the ones responsible for
[12:31] that all the builders
[12:32] those that consider themselves ministers
[12:35] or religious
[12:36] uh godly godly people or
[12:40] as we'd say today christians uh
[12:43] religious leaders
[12:44] you're the builders you're supposed to
[12:46] be the ones that are edifying these
[12:48] people you're the supposed to be the
[12:49] ones
[12:49] giving them the pure unadulterated word
[12:52] of the hour the present day truth
[12:54] you're supposed to be the ones helping
[12:56] these people build up to a place of
[12:58] faith
[12:59] our original scripture is that in the
[13:01] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[13:02] master what does that mean
[13:03] that means there's going to be a day
[13:05] when a prophet is going to come and
[13:07] bring a present-day truth to bring
[13:09] and at the end time seventh day is going
[13:11] to take into a rapture
[13:13] so those are the builders that he's
[13:15] talking about and you've taken he's
[13:17] talking
[13:18] you've taken jesus christ your religious
[13:20] leaders have taken jesus christ
[13:22] and discarded him you've built your
[13:25] foundation
[13:26] your church on something else oh sure
[13:28] you've got beautiful buildings
[13:30] oh sure you got beautiful stained glass
[13:32] windows and beautiful steeples and
[13:34] you got these beautiful fineries you got
[13:36] them packed full of people
[13:38] but what does it really mean when it
[13:39] comes down to it if your foundation is
[13:41] not
[13:42] laid on jesus christ well friend the
[13:45] foundation of any build
[13:47] is the most important part you know we
[13:49] major on the fineries
[13:50] we like how beautiful it is we paint it
[13:53] often we put carpet or
[13:54] the the lights whatever we find we make
[13:57] it look beautiful and there's nothing
[13:58] wrong with that
[13:59] but without a steady foundation remember
[14:02] the wise man
[14:03] the wise man built his house upon what
[14:07] a stone the rock the rock
[14:11] now if you talk about a natural house of
[14:13] course there's got to be a solid
[14:14] foundation
[14:15] you talk about your spiritual life that
[14:17] that rock has got to be jesus
[14:19] and not just again some trinity or
[14:22] second person
[14:24] but but the revelation of jesus christ
[14:26] is god almighty and flesh
[14:29] it's a revelation it's who he is is the
[14:31] mystery of god
[14:33] that's being revealed in this last day
[14:34] you have rejected him
[14:37] and you builders have built your
[14:40] buildings
[14:41] your churches your denominations your
[14:45] spiritual of
[14:48] foundations buildings you built among
[14:50] seeking sands
[14:52] if they're not built on jesus christ if
[14:54] they're not built on
[14:55] who jesus christ is isn't the revelation
[14:57] of who he is
[14:59] not just a you know something just a
[15:02] good man or prophet
[15:03] but god almighty himself got to be built
[15:06] on that foundation because
[15:08] in there is all the mysteries that he
[15:10] goes from reveals from from that point
[15:12] see
[15:13] he has become now the head of the corner
[15:15] we talked about that corner last week
[15:16] what is the corner of the corner the
[15:18] foundation
[15:18] stone cornerstone song of the building
[15:21] is the building that
[15:22] uh is a stone that holds the weight of
[15:25] the building
[15:26] it's the is the foundation of the
[15:28] building so we find out he's the head
[15:31] of the head cornerstone she's the
[15:33] cornerstone foundation
[15:35] he's also the head of the building he
[15:37] comes in caps we talked about last week
[15:39] pyramid and
[15:40] the captain of the pyramid showed you
[15:42] american dollar
[15:43] of course it never has been capped never
[15:45] will be capped
[15:46] because america rejected him right the
[15:48] all-seeing eye
[15:49] they rejected him so if they rejected
[15:52] him it will never be capped
[15:53] but he is coming to cap and he has
[15:55] capped a bride
[15:57] and brought that that headship down on
[16:00] the bride remember
[16:01] philippians 2 says let this might be in
[16:03] you which was also in christ jesus
[16:06] that capstone headstone to come so he is
[16:09] the author
[16:10] the foundation the cheap cornerstone and
[16:13] the finisher the capstone the finishing
[16:16] product of that building
[16:17] is the top the the capstone see when
[16:20] they make the pyramids built them
[16:22] that capstone was the last thing to come
[16:24] on and because
[16:25] that is the finisher so he's the author
[16:27] and the finisher so he has
[16:29] the ones that was rejected jesus christ
[16:32] the stone that was rejected was said it
[16:34] not of the builders
[16:35] has become the head of the corner he is
[16:38] the one that's in charge of this whole
[16:40] thing
[16:40] upon that that his church is being built
[16:44] now
[16:44] neither is there any salvation any other
[16:47] for nath
[16:48] for there is no other name under heaven
[16:50] given among men whereby we must be saved
[16:53] but at the name of jesus christ in the
[16:56] name of jesus christ now remember
[16:59] that that foundation is the most
[17:01] important foundation of ability or
[17:04] is the most important part of the
[17:05] building is the foundation
[17:07] we go back and pick this up again in in
[17:10] matthew chapter 16 thought it was
[17:12] important enough to read to us again
[17:13] today
[17:14] in matthew 16 17 jesus
[17:18] uh let's go up to 13 again we read when
[17:20] jesus came the coast of cesarean
[17:22] philippi he asked the disciples saying
[17:24] who to men
[17:24] say i the son of man am they said some
[17:27] say that thou are john the baptist some
[17:29] elias others jeremiah so one of the
[17:31] prophets he said unto them but whom say
[17:34] ye that i am who do you
[17:37] say that i am that's the most important
[17:39] thing
[17:40] because it's individual it's it's up to
[17:43] you
[17:43] see and simon peter answered said thou
[17:46] art the christ the son of the living god
[17:49] jesus
[17:50] answered and said unto him blessed art
[17:52] thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood
[17:54] had not revealed it unto thee you get it
[17:56] seminary
[17:58] but god my father which is in heaven
[18:02] he has revealed it to you god revealed
[18:06] it
[18:06] to peter what's up you learned what
[18:08] something you got in the
[18:10] book or school or seminary god revealed
[18:13] it to him
[18:14] who jesus christ was so what does that
[18:16] tell us it tells us that the only way
[18:18] that a person could get to an
[18:20] understanding of jesus christ and who he
[18:23] is
[18:23] is through revelation of jesus of jesus
[18:27] christ by god
[18:28] that's the only way you can get it this
[18:30] comes by revelation
[18:31] has to be personally given god to you
[18:34] see
[18:35] revealed to you personally my father
[18:38] which is in heaven i see unto thee
[18:40] thou art petered upon this rock i will
[18:43] build my church
[18:44] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[18:46] against it one of the
[18:47] most great scriptures there for the
[18:48] church to hinge upon
[18:50] to to have trust in faith in sea because
[18:53] if your foundation is built on jesus
[18:55] christ
[18:56] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[18:59] you
[19:00] now it may try to buffet you but it
[19:03] can't overcome you
[19:04] it can't overtake you it can't uh
[19:07] consume you see now if your foundation's
[19:10] not built upon the revelation of who
[19:12] jesus christ
[19:12] is then of course your foundation is
[19:14] just going to wash away then what do you
[19:16] have
[19:17] building is going to crumble to the
[19:18] ground the gates of hell can prevail or
[19:21] overcome anything that's built on
[19:23] anything other than the true revelation
[19:26] of who jesus christ is that's why he
[19:28] desires to have that preeminence
[19:31] in his body he does it through the
[19:33] revelation of his word
[19:35] and his life his spirit coming in us his
[19:38] spirit is in you
[19:39] he has proved that he's approved of you
[19:42] and that revelation comes from god to
[19:44] realize who he is
[19:45] and the gates of hell no matter how much
[19:47] satan tries to come against you
[19:49] he cannot prevail over you he cannot
[19:52] prevail it is impossible because it
[19:54] would be against the word
[19:56] and god doesn't go against his word god
[19:58] doesn't transgress his word
[20:00] so it has to be that god those that are
[20:03] on that founder cannot prevail i know
[20:05] maybe sometimes you've been in some
[20:07] trials and some tests and it felt like
[20:09] you were being prevailed over
[20:10] but trust me you were not you could not
[20:13] be not if your foundation's in the right
[20:15] place
[20:16] built upon that stone that rock
[20:19] that the builders religious leaders
[20:21] rejected built upon that
[20:23] can't prevail there's no way it can
[20:25] prevail against you
[20:27] because that's what the word says cannot
[20:29] prevail
[20:30] see and again that foundation that
[20:33] foundation is the most
[20:34] important part of the building people
[20:37] try to go to church and they try to
[20:39] get baptized and they try to do all
[20:41] kinds of stuff
[20:42] and then all that's fine you know they
[20:45] try to live a good religious life they
[20:47] try to go to church
[20:48] and try to be faithful and and again all
[20:50] those things are fine and dandy friend
[20:51] but
[20:52] if it's not built on that sure
[20:54] foundation if it's not built on the
[20:56] revelation of jesus christ
[20:58] and that mystery of who he is then it's
[21:00] not going to hold it's not going to
[21:02] stand you go read the
[21:04] the parable that that jesus gives the
[21:06] sower the seed
[21:08] you know the sea goes here and it can't
[21:10] hold and it throws out here and it can't
[21:11] hold it goes here and it can't hold wine
[21:14] because it has no foundation it has no
[21:18] root seeming the seed has to when the
[21:20] seed go forth
[21:21] the seed has to have the kind of ground
[21:23] that's going to allow the root to dig
[21:25] into it
[21:26] so it has a foundation so it has
[21:28] something to hold it
[21:30] so all the tests and the trials and the
[21:32] hardships come
[21:33] it's got something to hold it see now
[21:35] all the others they go by the wayside
[21:37] they burn the sun or something like that
[21:39] there's got to be a foundation
[21:41] there's then when that foundation is
[21:43] there then it doesn't matter
[21:44] the winds can blow and the the the uh
[21:47] the toil can come and
[21:49] and satan can do whatever he wants but
[21:51] that that
[21:52] with that foundational hole it'll hold
[21:55] every time
[21:56] and it'll hold every time see you go to
[22:00] you go to certain places where they have
[22:01] a lot of hurricanes
[22:03] you go to california they have a lot of
[22:04] earthquakes you know it used to be a big
[22:07] earthquake with crumbled buildings like
[22:08] nothing big hurricane with level grounds
[22:10] and they still do
[22:11] sometimes but but man
[22:14] has gotten smarter and they built a
[22:17] little better foundation
[22:19] so a 5.0 earthquake won't crumble
[22:22] buildings as much anymore
[22:23] used to but it won't anymore because
[22:26] they've gotten smarter but see god
[22:27] doesn't get smarter
[22:28] that's why the foundation that we lay in
[22:30] him is
[22:31] perfect it's right and it will hold
[22:34] regardless of the circumstances
[22:36] regardless of what comes that's the most
[22:38] important part
[22:40] it isn't now forgive me i don't mean
[22:42] this the wrong way but it isn't
[22:44] necessarily just getting baptized
[22:46] it isn't necessarily just going to
[22:47] church isn't necessarily just reading
[22:49] your bible all those things are
[22:51] wonderful
[22:51] good things please don't get me wrong
[22:54] that's absolutely what a christian
[22:56] should do
[22:57] but you got to get that foundation right
[22:59] first
[23:00] that foundation has got to be right
[23:03] that's christ
[23:04] in you the hope of glory that's you in
[23:06] the new birth coming
[23:08] into you settling that foundation
[23:10] packing it
[23:11] to where whatever comes on it it'll hold
[23:15] i remember one time i was in business
[23:16] back in charlotte and we had gotten into
[23:18] a new building we
[23:19] moved to the south part of charlotte we
[23:21] got in this building and it was still
[23:23] developing and
[23:24] i could look out my office window and
[23:27] look out they were going to build a
[23:28] building up on a little
[23:29] it's kind of a little ledge up there but
[23:31] it was kind of a hill
[23:32] they brought bulldozers and earth movers
[23:34] in there and they begin to
[23:36] to take that land they begin to flatten
[23:39] it out
[23:40] and then they brought other dirt in and
[23:42] stuff and put it down there
[23:44] and for literal what seemed like weeks
[23:46] or maybe even
[23:47] months they had these big huge
[23:50] equipments
[23:51] going back and forth and back and forth
[23:53] across all that land
[23:55] back and forth back and forth and you
[23:58] know for a moment i thought why they
[23:59] keep doing that day after day after day
[24:01] and then it dawned on me
[24:03] and the scriptural and the spiritual
[24:04] application they had to
[24:06] pack that thing down good to where that
[24:09] foundation was
[24:10] solid so when they built that big old
[24:13] building on top of it it wasn't just
[24:14] gonna crumble down with the first storm
[24:16] to come along
[24:18] that's what happens to a lot of people
[24:20] they don't get their foundation right
[24:21] and the first one that comes along
[24:23] they're building crumbles down quit
[24:26] going to church they leave god or
[24:27] whatever and
[24:28] you know sometimes they build a good
[24:30] enough foundation that it holds for a
[24:32] while
[24:33] but when a real hard trial hits then
[24:35] there comes the building
[24:37] but if it's built on jesus christ the
[24:39] rock
[24:40] revelation the revelation here jesus
[24:43] telling peter
[24:44] the revelation who he is is built on
[24:47] that
[24:47] it doesn't matter what storms come it
[24:49] doesn't matter what hardships are life
[24:51] what trials tribulations it will hold
[24:54] it will keep you amen people ask
[24:57] you know when brother branham went
[24:58] through that with his wife and his
[25:00] daughter
[25:00] and his first wife hope and sharon rose
[25:03] and when they passed away and they said
[25:04] through all that you went through
[25:06] brother brown
[25:06] bill uh how were you able to keep your
[25:10] religion he said i didn't it kept me it
[25:14] kept me
[25:15] that's having the right foundation
[25:17] friend when you can't keep it
[25:19] when you'd rather die than draw your
[25:21] neck your next breath that foundation
[25:23] will hold you
[25:25] amen that's why that foundation has got
[25:27] to be there baptism is fine
[25:29] reading the bible going to church all
[25:30] those good things those are
[25:32] prosperous things but that foundation
[25:34] has got to be there first
[25:36] amen i know i'm laying that foundation
[25:39] pretty hard right now
[25:40] but we're going to build on that
[25:41] foundation here i want to start building
[25:44] on that foundation
[25:45] for the body that jesus is having the
[25:48] preeminence over
[25:50] that body that we are a part of see
[25:52] because
[25:53] that that that brings us to that
[25:55] knowledge and understanding
[25:56] who are we who am i who are you
[26:00] who who are these people that are called
[26:03] the bride around the world who are they
[26:05] see but that foundation's got to be
[26:07] right first
[26:08] it's got to be right and then we can and
[26:11] then you can build
[26:13] then you can build on that building see
[26:15] it's got to come from that first
[26:18] amen now let's go to uh ephesians
[26:22] ephesians chapter 2 we read last week
[26:24] again
[26:28] some of this would be with the way the
[26:32] streaming was going and all i
[26:33] i kind of skipped through some of it and
[26:36] we'll just uh lay a little bit better
[26:37] but i want to put that foundation in
[26:39] there friend
[26:40] that foundations no matter who you are
[26:42] you're listening and watching this
[26:43] that foundation has got to be settled
[26:46] it's got to be right
[26:47] without that your building will crumble
[26:50] without that
[26:51] the gates of hell can prevail
[26:54] over you not just come against you but
[26:57] prevail
[26:58] that means coming out victorious over
[27:01] you
[27:01] that foundation's got to be right first
[27:04] it's not in a church
[27:06] it's not a pastor it's not a preacher
[27:08] it's not
[27:09] a prophet or some kind of gift he said
[27:11] the word
[27:12] jesus christ that foundation it's got to
[27:15] be their revelation
[27:16] now uh arabia excuse me ephesians
[27:19] chapter 2.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:23] amen let's read this ephesians chapter 2
[27:26] verse 20.
[27:29] uh let's just begin with verse 19
[27:31] ephesians 2 19. now therefore
[27:33] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[27:35] but fellow citizens with the saints
[27:37] and of the household of god and are
[27:40] built upon the foundation
[27:43] built upon the foundation let's get this
[27:45] building going up now
[27:47] amen it's nice to have the foundation
[27:49] good foundation solid foundation
[27:52] but you don't just you don't just stand
[27:53] there and stare at the foundation
[27:55] you can't inhabit a foundation
[27:59] god can inhabit a foundation he's got to
[28:01] inhabit a building
[28:03] and you are that building individually
[28:06] and as a worldwide body
[28:09] god inhabits amen now
[28:12] that it's got to be a building so
[28:15] we are built upon the foundation
[28:18] and we got that foundation lane now
[28:20] we're being built upon the foundation
[28:22] of the apostles and prophets
[28:25] those that have the word uh jesus christ
[28:29] himself
[28:30] being the chief cornerstone which we've
[28:33] just
[28:34] uh reiterated and gone into jesus
[28:37] and being the chief cornerstone so how
[28:39] can he be the cornerstone of the
[28:40] building
[28:41] and the head of the building because he
[28:43] is the author
[28:44] the beginner the alpha and he is the
[28:47] finisher
[28:48] the omega the ending amen
[28:51] in whom all the building again we get
[28:55] into this
[28:55] all the building fitly framed together
[28:58] now if you're the house of jesus christ
[29:01] it's all fitly framed together
[29:03] groweth unto and and as a body of
[29:07] believers worldwide
[29:09] remember my body and the body of
[29:11] believers worldwide
[29:13] see we're all part of the same mystical
[29:15] body of jesus christ we're all a part of
[29:17] it
[29:18] worldwide you know friends sometimes we
[29:21] just
[29:21] you know we really got to get out of
[29:24] this
[29:25] this mindset of my foreign no more that
[29:28] we
[29:29] uh uh uh
[29:32] devolved into sometimes that we that we
[29:35] go into sometimes
[29:37] uh sometimes we get into this thing that
[29:39] it's just me or it's just
[29:41] my family or it's just my church or it's
[29:43] just here in the state or
[29:44] in this country friend there's pride
[29:46] around the world
[29:48] it's got to always be our thought vision
[29:50] understanding
[29:51] bride around the world and those people
[29:54] over there
[29:54] are just as much bright as you and i are
[29:58] they are just as much a part of this
[30:00] body as you and i
[30:01] are there may be eyes over there there
[30:03] may be fingers toes
[30:05] torsos there may ears nose there maybe i
[30:08] don't know
[30:09] but we all make up the mystical body of
[30:11] jesus christ around the world
[30:14] and it's just like your body if you stub
[30:17] your toe your whole body hurts
[30:20] when something goes wrong the whole body
[30:22] reacts to it
[30:23] even in your bloodstream those if
[30:27] i get this right those white blood cells
[30:29] you cut your fingers up and go
[30:31] they all rush from the body go right to
[30:33] that hard spot
[30:35] why because the body knows if he can fix
[30:37] that one part
[30:39] then the whole body will be complete
[30:41] again that's the way we should be as a
[30:43] body
[30:44] a body of believers the building
[30:47] remember this
[30:48] fitly frame together building that
[30:50] groweth
[30:51] together remember what brother braham
[30:54] said it's fitly building it's
[30:56] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[30:59] holy temple in the lord remember again i
[31:01] said last week brother
[31:02] talked about those pyramids and how
[31:04] those rocks were so
[31:05] hewn out and and laid together that you
[31:08] couldn't run a razor blade between them
[31:11] and i believe that's the way the bride
[31:12] is no matter how much satan tries to
[31:14] carve us up
[31:15] there's not a razor blade can come and
[31:18] separate a brother from
[31:19] sister sister sister brother brother
[31:21] because that's the way god has set this
[31:24] building together that's the way this
[31:25] building
[31:26] is fit together can't run a razor blade
[31:30] and it's growing together see if you
[31:33] build a house
[31:35] the foundation is the most important
[31:37] part but if you're building a house the
[31:39] house has to be
[31:40] plumb and square right i mean
[31:43] you can have a good foundation and which
[31:45] is the most important part
[31:47] but if you start building the building
[31:49] you say well i got a revelation of jesus
[31:51] christ and
[31:52] you know i'm going to go somewhere that
[31:53] doesn't teach the pure word
[31:55] then you're going to have a leaning
[31:57] tower of pisa
[31:59] the building is supposed to be plum and
[32:01] square
[32:02] it's supposed to be exactly on angle and
[32:06] and level everything about the building
[32:08] so it's holds
[32:09] better it's fitly framed together for
[32:12] that purse
[32:13] for that purpose so it has to be
[32:16] not just the word it's got to be the
[32:18] spirit too
[32:20] but it can't just be the spirit it's got
[32:22] to be the word too it's got to be the
[32:23] mechanics and the dynamics together
[32:25] it's got to be the spirit and the word
[32:28] that's together
[32:29] that that building is is growing in
[32:33] it has to be plumb and square it has to
[32:35] be the holy spirit
[32:37] and the word that's growing amen
[32:40] as you're bringing this building up as
[32:42] it's growing it's
[32:44] fitly framed together palm and square
[32:47] holy spirit and the word growing into a
[32:50] holy temple
[32:51] in the lord in whom ye are are also
[32:55] are building together for a habitation
[32:58] of god
[32:59] through the spirit becoming a habitation
[33:02] of god through the spirit again you
[33:03] can't have potato
[33:04] of literally a foundation
[33:08] has to be a building it's got to be a
[33:09] building that's going to hold
[33:11] it's got to be a square plum building
[33:12] it's got to be on the revelation of the
[33:14] word
[33:14] and it's got to be by the holy spirit
[33:17] unto the habitation of god
[33:19] in you through the spirit god inhabiting
[33:23] you now not just me but each one of us
[33:27] together
[33:27] again this body around the world when
[33:30] one part of the body grows
[33:32] all the body grows right when one part
[33:35] of the body hurts all the body hurts
[33:38] when one part of the body is in need the
[33:40] whole body is in need
[33:42] it's just like we were talking about it
[33:43] has to be the whole body together
[33:46] that's why this body is what it is to be
[33:48] the inhabitant
[33:49] place of god that by the spirit
[33:53] god come and inhabit it it's got to be
[33:56] according to the
[33:57] the specifications of the word as god
[33:59] has laid out to us
[34:01] amen so it's all around the world now
[34:04] let's move on first corinthians
[34:09] first corinthians chapter three
[34:14] first corinthians chapter three we'll
[34:15] just begin with verse one and we're
[34:17] gonna
[34:17] build this building we're going to try
[34:19] to get this building built today
[34:21] and then we'll we'll end it we'll end
[34:22] with that let's start building it here
[34:25] we already got here it says it's built
[34:27] fitly framed together
[34:30] it's fitly framed together to bring
[34:32] forth the habitation
[34:34] of god through the spirit now first
[34:37] corinthians chapter 3
[34:38] and i brother could not speak unto you
[34:40] as unto spiritual but as unto carnal
[34:43] even as unto babes in christ i have fed
[34:45] you with milk and not with me
[34:47] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[34:49] it neither yet
[34:50] now are ye able remember brother graham
[34:53] said the corinthian church's most
[34:54] spiritually weak church
[34:56] ephesian church was the strongest uh
[34:59] spiritually
[35:00] strong church so you know
[35:03] paul's telling them i had to feed you
[35:06] with milk as babes
[35:08] things i want to tell you i couldn't
[35:09] tell you even so now i can't tell you
[35:12] because you're not able to receive it
[35:14] third verse for ye are yet carnal
[35:17] for whereas there is among you ending
[35:19] strife division are ye not
[35:21] carnal and walk as men for while one
[35:24] saith i'm of paul and another i am
[35:26] apollos are you not carnal
[35:28] oh god help us that same spirit today
[35:33] who then is paul and who is apollos
[35:36] but ministers builders if you will
[35:39] by whom he believed even as the lord
[35:41] gave to every man
[35:43] i have planted apollo's water god gave
[35:47] the increase
[35:48] amen foundation was late never has to be
[35:51] the foundation we just read the apostles
[35:54] and prophets
[35:54] laid jesus christ himself being the
[35:57] chief cornerstone but it's god that
[35:58] gives the increase
[36:00] it's god that continues to keep this
[36:01] building growing because it's god
[36:03] is the one that reveals the word to you
[36:06] because this is a word body
[36:08] it's a word building it's built on
[36:11] the word it is built by the word because
[36:14] it is the word
[36:16] so that building it's god that gives the
[36:18] increase
[36:20] one planet the other water i mean i've
[36:22] said this
[36:23] several times to our church and you've
[36:25] heard me say this
[36:27] i think they should change the name of
[36:28] the revelation seven seal book
[36:31] that's just my personal opinion because
[36:33] it's not the revelation seven six it's
[36:35] the truth of the seven seals
[36:37] delivered by a prophet god inspired
[36:40] anointed
[36:41] to the truth to bring it to a people but
[36:43] it's only a revelation
[36:45] if god gives you that revelation see
[36:48] paul planted apollos water brother
[36:51] branham planted
[36:53] ministers water but it takes god to get
[36:56] the increase
[36:57] it takes god to bring the revelation
[36:59] brother branham could not give you
[37:01] revelation
[37:02] paul could not give anybody revelation
[37:04] paul could not give anybody revelation
[37:05] it takes god to give it
[37:07] and that's where the increase comes the
[37:10] faith comes by hearing and hearing the
[37:12] word absolutely
[37:13] that's the ministry that lays it out the
[37:15] planting the watering
[37:16] but it takes god to bring the increase
[37:19] of that
[37:20] faith faith comes by hearing the word
[37:22] but god gives the increase
[37:24] god brings the revelation to you so as
[37:27] the words being ministered as the words
[37:29] being brought to you
[37:30] god is revealing it to you as god
[37:32] reveals it to you
[37:34] it just adds another block it adds
[37:36] another brick it adds another stone it
[37:38] adds another two by four wall
[37:39] ceiling whatever it adds to that body
[37:43] praise the lord and as that body goes
[37:45] forth god
[37:46] gives the increase
[37:50] so neither verse 7 now so neither is he
[37:53] that planteth
[37:53] anything in other words paul's saying
[37:56] i'm nothing
[37:58] neither is he that watereth apollos is
[38:01] nothing
[38:02] but god they giveth the increase there's
[38:05] god that brings the revelation
[38:07] so it's only so it's god's church so
[38:09] god's the one in charge of it so god
[38:11] takes care of it amen
[38:13] he's the one that gives the increase
[38:15] that's where it comes from
[38:16] amen we're just here to be by the
[38:19] revelation
[38:20] preeminence of jesus christ in us
[38:23] to bring that word to bring that truth
[38:26] to witness to other people to help other
[38:28] people we can't
[38:30] save anybody we can't reveal the word to
[38:32] anybody we can lead them to it
[38:34] we can help them and maybe explain it to
[38:37] them as god has revealed it to us
[38:39] but even in explaining it you can't
[38:40] reveal it to somebody
[38:42] oh sure they might get some kind of a
[38:44] head knowledge to say oh i i see what
[38:45] you mean
[38:46] but that's not a revelation revelation
[38:49] when it becomes part of you
[38:51] amen it becomes part of i've told you my
[38:53] definition of that many times
[38:55] but when it becomes a part of you man
[38:58] that's a revelation and nobody can take
[39:00] that from you
[39:01] and nobody can take that from you god
[39:03] gives the increase now he that planted
[39:05] paul he that water apollos are one
[39:09] are one together united every man
[39:12] shall receive his own reward according
[39:14] to his own labor now
[39:16] the first thing that that that paul is
[39:18] trying to bring here to help them
[39:19] understand is look there's no division
[39:21] here there's no chisholm
[39:23] there's no separation there's no ending
[39:25] there's no hatred
[39:26] me and apollos are one yeah i mean
[39:30] he may be going here and doing what the
[39:32] lord called him to do and i'm going here
[39:34] and doing what the lord called me to do
[39:35] this brother's going here doing what the
[39:37] lord called him to do and that's all
[39:38] right
[39:39] that's fine god leads every man
[39:41] according as he will
[39:43] but we're one well one in him
[39:46] and if you're if your building is on
[39:49] that foundation
[39:51] you're built upon the revelation of
[39:53] jesus christ
[39:54] the mystery of god and that foundation
[39:57] of who jesus
[39:58] is not just a church not just a building
[40:01] you're built on we're one we're brothers
[40:05] around the world internationally we're
[40:07] one we're all a part of this same
[40:08] mystical body of jesus
[40:10] christ we're all one and paul's telling
[40:12] them here
[40:13] menopause aren't at odds with each other
[40:15] we're brothers
[40:16] we're one in this one's watering one's
[40:19] planting one's doing this and that
[40:22] but in all that god gives the increase
[40:25] amen god gives the increase praise the
[40:27] lord
[40:29] for we are for we are laborers together
[40:32] with god
[40:33] ye are god's husbandry now that's a
[40:36] strange word isn't it especially
[40:38] considering
[40:39] if you think on it because considering
[40:41] that we're considered the bride of jesus
[40:44] christ
[40:45] which is feminist by designation
[40:48] because bride woman if i hear he's
[40:52] saying that paul is saying
[40:54] you are god's husbandry ye are god's
[40:57] building
[40:58] but what is a what is a husbandry
[41:01] a husbandry is simply a worker
[41:04] a laborer a fellow servant that's all a
[41:08] husbandry is someone who kills the
[41:10] ground
[41:10] someone who is in labor for the lord is
[41:13] someone who is doing the work and the
[41:15] bidding of the lord jesus
[41:17] it's just someone that is out being led
[41:19] of the spirit and god is leading them
[41:21] to do his work for him on this earth we
[41:24] are his
[41:25] husbandry look it again let's read it
[41:27] again see here now
[41:28] he said together we are uh together with
[41:30] god ye
[41:31] are god's husbandry ye are god's
[41:35] building praise the lord we are his
[41:38] workmen
[41:39] we're here because to allow god to have
[41:42] the preeminence
[41:43] in us he is the head of this body
[41:48] so that in that we are his building
[41:51] to do his work we have a work to do
[41:55] continuing he said well we're at the end
[41:57] time yes we are and it may be a
[41:59] different
[42:00] work than than even
[42:03] a hundred years ago maybe a different
[42:05] work than it was even 50 years ago
[42:07] but it's still a job it's still a work
[42:09] it's still some
[42:10] there's a reason why we're still here
[42:13] there's a reason why this bride is still
[42:15] here and whatever that reason is
[42:17] i i you know that's up to god i mean the
[42:20] full
[42:20] aspect of that reason is totally up to
[42:22] god it's not up to me
[42:25] so i'm just here to do what he called me
[42:27] to do and my part of that
[42:30] you're here to do that part that god's
[42:32] called you to
[42:33] whatever that is now i i can't say that
[42:36] you're not doing what god's called you
[42:38] to do
[42:39] because god calls you to that not me now
[42:42] if it's something unscriptural or some
[42:44] uh the the it's not following the
[42:47] message of the word or something that
[42:49] that's totally different
[42:50] but if you're a fellow laborer
[42:53] uh part of the husbandry or one day
[42:56] we're just doing the job god called us
[42:58] to do you may not be on that street or
[43:00] in that city or in that state or in that
[43:02] country but you're doing what god called
[43:04] you to do
[43:05] and that's all god expects of any of us
[43:07] because we are his building
[43:10] let 10th first out according to the
[43:12] grace of god which is given
[43:13] unto me as a wise master builder i have
[43:16] laid the foundation
[43:17] and another build it thereon but let
[43:20] every man
[43:21] take heed how he buildeth thereon
[43:24] we have to make sure that how we build
[43:27] upon that foundation
[43:28] is based upon the revelation of the word
[43:31] of the hour
[43:33] based upon god bringing his word as he
[43:36] is
[43:36] remember again the foundation of the
[43:38] apostles and
[43:39] prophets in the days of the voice of the
[43:43] seventh angel messenger
[43:44] prophet the mystery of god should be
[43:48] finished that foundation will be built
[43:52] this body will be there upon so
[43:55] we have to be careful how we're building
[43:58] upon that foundation
[44:00] we have to make sure that it's according
[44:02] to the word
[44:03] it's according to the message it's
[44:05] according to the spirit of god
[44:07] in our lives and as leading us see you
[44:09] say well god's called me to do this
[44:10] that's fine and dandy but just make sure
[44:13] that you absolutely know that's what
[44:16] god's calling you to do
[44:18] that's that's just all there is to it
[44:20] just make sure you know what
[44:22] this is what god told me to do well make
[44:25] sure that's what he told you to do
[44:27] there's nothing wrong with that that's
[44:28] good
[44:29] we all be led of the lord but make sure
[44:31] see paul's saying
[44:33] take heed how you're building thereof
[44:36] don't go with you know some another
[44:39] man's revelation
[44:40] even in the message is that what's you
[44:42] know he's a message minister that's fine
[44:44] but that's not your foundation
[44:46] that's not your building see you your
[44:49] building is based on the revelation god
[44:51] gives you
[44:52] now it would certainly match if it's a
[44:55] word and if we're one it's going to
[44:57] match together
[44:59] but don't take it just because it's
[45:00] somebody else's revelation
[45:02] it's got to be your revelation and your
[45:05] revelation
[45:06] as we are one together should match the
[45:08] revelation of the word
[45:10] together amen but don't do it just
[45:12] because
[45:13] it was revealed to them amen don't
[45:16] preach something just because another
[45:17] brother
[45:18] preached it let god reveal it god
[45:20] reveals it
[45:21] then that's a different story see take
[45:23] heed how you build their own for a other
[45:26] foundation can no man lay
[45:28] than that it is laid which is jesus
[45:30] christ
[45:31] and other people try to lay other
[45:33] foundations you say oh oh we're
[45:35] christians oh well we're in the message
[45:37] we
[45:37] we listen to the we listen to the tapes
[45:41] we go to church every week that's all
[45:44] fine and good
[45:45] but what is your foundation what is your
[45:47] building being built upon
[45:48] just based on what somebody else has
[45:50] told you
[45:52] just based on what you've heard on the
[45:54] tape
[45:55] or is it coming because you have a
[45:57] personal relationship with jesus christ
[45:59] yourself
[46:00] and the revelation that god is giving to
[46:02] you that is building your building
[46:05] that is building the building the group
[46:07] building
[46:08] as you build we all build right remember
[46:11] we're all a part of the same body
[46:13] so but but if it's not built on that
[46:16] then what is it built upon
[46:17] because it was i voted on jesus christ
[46:19] but then deny the word
[46:22] or or give us some other man's uh
[46:25] religion or
[46:26] revelation or yours it's got to be
[46:29] something that's
[46:30] according to the according to the word
[46:33] not
[46:33] not something that is uh uh um
[46:37] my idea or my opinion or or my personal
[46:40] vendetta or something
[46:42] it's got to be based on the word amen
[46:45] it's got to be based on
[46:46] what your revelation is that god has
[46:49] revealed to you
[46:51] god is brought and given to you now i
[46:53] want to read
[46:54] a couple more scriptures here if we can
[46:56] we'll get to them
[46:57] if we can i might have to leave off that
[46:59] second when time's getting away from us
[47:00] but
[47:01] i want to go to first corinthians 12 now
[47:03] again we're building that building
[47:06] we're building that building first
[47:08] corinthians chapter 12. we were just in
[47:10] chapter
[47:11] uh three but i want to go to chapter 12
[47:14] now
[47:15] and begin reading with verse 12. and it
[47:17] goes into the spiritual gifts
[47:20] of course revel um first corinthians 12
[47:22] and first corinthians
[47:24] 14 go into the spiritual gifts a lot uh
[47:27] which we've taught on but we're going to
[47:29] forgo that right now and just get into
[47:31] the body part of it
[47:32] because that's the part that i believe
[47:34] that paul is majoring on
[47:36] he's not really even necessarily
[47:38] majoring on the gifts which brother
[47:39] brahm said you can't major on a minor
[47:41] so we don't major on the gifts you may
[47:43] draw on the word uh
[47:45] you can't major on a minor but what paul
[47:48] is
[47:48] i believe really getting to the people
[47:50] here and you can look at it
[47:52] we're going to read starting with verse
[47:53] 12 and most of this chapter
[47:55] is about the body it's about us being a
[47:58] body together
[48:00] let's just read it here first
[48:02] corinthians 12 12
[48:03] whereas the body is one and has many
[48:07] members
[48:08] that's us and all the members of that
[48:10] one body being many
[48:12] are one body so also is christ
[48:15] christ's body is a many member body
[48:19] not just a myford no more it's so easy
[48:22] to get into that mindset friend but
[48:23] that's not what it's about it's not my
[48:25] fault no more it's not just my church my
[48:27] city my state
[48:28] it's around the world i want to get that
[48:30] heart to us because we got to remember
[48:32] that
[48:33] people i've heard people say well
[48:34] there's got to be persecution in this
[48:36] bride how do you know there's not
[48:38] there's bride around the world if
[48:40] they're sitting over there in china
[48:42] and they have to renounce jesus christ
[48:44] although the real believers aren't
[48:47] and and swear alliances
[48:50] and put up his picture in their house
[48:51] and take down jesus and everything else
[48:53] throw the bibles away and stuff that
[48:55] they're being persecuted
[48:57] i mean we don't know what's happening in
[48:59] some of these countries necessarily
[49:01] are all together i mean there is
[49:04] persecution in this pride
[49:05] you may not necessarily be personally
[49:07] feeling it exactly the way they are
[49:09] but they're part of the body they're
[49:12] part of us they're a part of me
[49:14] we're a part of each other if they're
[49:16] being persecuted i'm being persecuted
[49:19] amen it's not just my home not just my
[49:21] church family
[49:23] it's around the world we're all in this
[49:24] together
[49:26] paul's trying to make that very strong
[49:28] here
[49:29] our one body so also is christ 13th
[49:32] verse 4 by
[49:33] one spirit we are all baptized into one
[49:37] body
[49:37] whether we be jews gentiles whether it
[49:39] be bond or free and have been
[49:41] all made to drink into one spirit jesus
[49:44] christ
[49:45] that mystery of god for the body is not
[49:48] one member but many
[49:50] if the foot shall say because i am not
[49:52] the hand i am not of the body
[49:54] is it therefore not of the body and if
[49:56] the ear shall say because i am not an
[49:58] eye i am not of the body
[50:00] it is therefore not a part of the body
[50:03] if the whole body were an eye where were
[50:06] the hearing
[50:08] if the whole body were hearing where is
[50:10] the smelly
[50:12] see we're all we all play that very
[50:15] important part of
[50:16] of god having the preeminence in each
[50:18] one of us
[50:20] we can't hear without him we can't smell
[50:22] that but we got to do
[50:23] our part to bring about the smell and to
[50:25] bring about the hearing
[50:27] to bring about the planting to bring
[50:28] about the water
[50:30] god give the increase amen
[50:33] we're not all ears we're not all
[50:36] prophets
[50:36] we're not all ministers we're not all
[50:39] strong speakers or
[50:41] we all have our separate things that god
[50:44] works through us
[50:48] but now i have god set the members every
[50:50] one of them in the body as it had
[50:51] pleased him
[50:53] as it had pleased god so you can't say
[50:55] oh wait i
[50:56] i don't want to be in here i want to be
[50:57] a knight that's not up to you
[50:59] well i don't want to do this it's not up
[51:02] to you
[51:03] if you're going to live you are not of
[51:05] yourself you are not of your own you're
[51:06] bought with a price you
[51:08] we do what god tells us to do we do what
[51:11] he leads us and shows us to do sure
[51:13] we're free moral agents that's the good
[51:14] part about it
[51:15] we can do whatever we want we just
[51:17] choose to do what god tells us to do
[51:20] what god wants us to do that's that's
[51:23] where it comes that's
[51:24] the most pleasing thing to him he does
[51:27] he does it through us
[51:28] because we are willing subjects he
[51:30] doesn't force us to do anything
[51:32] but we do it because we want him to do
[51:34] it we want to be pleasing to him
[51:37] so he has said each one of the bodies
[51:38] that pleased him and if they were all
[51:40] one member
[51:41] where would the body or what if
[51:43] everybody was brother branham
[51:46] what part with all the rest of us play
[51:48] that we need to do
[51:50] that everything else needs to be done
[51:52] everybody can't just be a brain
[51:55] what good is a brain laying on the
[51:56] sidewalk it may be the best brain ever
[51:59] god made
[52:00] but what good does it do without a body
[52:02] to go in it
[52:03] for it to go into what what good is it
[52:06] if it's
[52:07] hearing the eyes to seeing the smell
[52:09] what what good does the rest of it do
[52:11] i mean what good is the whole head if
[52:13] he's laying on the sidewalk
[52:15] gotta have a body and if you were all
[52:19] one member
[52:20] where were the body and now all
[52:23] and now are they many members yet but
[52:25] one body
[52:27] i cannot say into the hand i have no
[52:29] need of thee nor again the head to the
[52:31] feet i have no need of you
[52:33] may much more those members of the body
[52:35] which seem to be more
[52:36] feeble are necessary they're very
[52:39] necessary
[52:40] they may not be behind the pulpit they
[52:42] may not be shining and
[52:45] and be the one that everybody looks to
[52:47] or whatever or the one that's most
[52:49] popular or that
[52:50] but you know every little piece to the
[52:53] very
[52:54] bottom of the skin on the bottom of your
[52:55] foot
[52:57] is important to go on we're all a part
[52:59] of the same mystical body of jesus
[53:01] christ
[53:02] if you're a part of the body that's all
[53:04] that really matters
[53:06] when you get down to the end of it when
[53:07] you're at the end of the road
[53:09] when god pulls your number when it's
[53:10] time to go home that's all that really
[53:12] matters that's all that's going to
[53:14] matter to you friend
[53:15] and those members of the body which
[53:17] think they are less honorable upon
[53:19] these we bestow more abundant honor and
[53:22] our
[53:22] and our own comedy parts have more
[53:24] abundant compliments
[53:27] god is thankful even if it's just a cup
[53:30] of water
[53:31] even if it's just a little labor or just
[53:33] a little of money or something whatever
[53:36] it is
[53:37] god blesses it our accompli parts have
[53:40] no need but god had
[53:42] tempered the body together having given
[53:45] more abundant honor
[53:46] to that part which lacked that there
[53:49] should be no chisholm in the body
[53:51] but that the members should have the
[53:52] same care one
[53:54] for another god help us all are we are
[53:58] can i say this are we ever going to get
[54:00] to that place
[54:02] yeah yeah that means that we
[54:05] of course because we're all part of the
[54:07] same body it will
[54:09] amen when i i don't know it sounds
[54:12] rough though doesn't it but i want to go
[54:14] back to the 24th verse real quick and
[54:16] look at this word temper
[54:18] our comedy parts have no need but god
[54:21] had tempered
[54:22] the body together they ever looked at
[54:23] that word
[54:25] that's a fusing together that's a
[54:28] that's a tempering together tempering
[54:32] even means to if you use a temperature
[54:35] to melt something and to bring
[54:38] even a couple of metals together you can
[54:40] melt metals and bring them together as
[54:42] one
[54:43] metal there's work called vulcanizing i
[54:46] think they use in the
[54:48] maybe entire manufacturing or something
[54:50] where they literally
[54:52] put something under such pressure
[54:55] or under such heat that they can bring
[54:58] two separate things together now i'm not
[55:00] a scientist i don't
[55:03] these specifics terms or whatever but
[55:06] actually bring those two
[55:07] elements and make them one element
[55:09] together
[55:11] that one element to serve whatever
[55:13] purpose it is an entire
[55:14] or whatever i don't know metals together
[55:18] or something bring them temper them
[55:20] together
[55:21] put them under such pressure and heat
[55:24] that it tempers
[55:25] them well god is saying here uh
[55:28] paul is saying that god had tempered the
[55:31] body together
[55:33] god has put the pressure god has put the
[55:35] heat
[55:36] to bring this and unify this body
[55:39] together in such a place
[55:41] that again when one part hurts that all
[55:43] the body hurts
[55:45] when one part's sick all the body's sick
[55:47] when one part is in persecution the
[55:49] whole body is being persecuted
[55:52] amen because we're part of the same body
[55:55] tempered
[55:56] tempering that body together having more
[55:58] abundant honor
[55:59] that part which lack because we're all a
[56:02] part of the same body together
[56:04] now that vulcanized that temporized body
[56:07] has come together to be one serves that
[56:11] purpose even though we're many member
[56:12] body
[56:13] we're vulcanized together we're tempered
[56:16] together by the word
[56:18] for the purpose of bringing forth
[56:21] the revelation that jesus christ the
[56:24] mystery of god
[56:26] no now 25th first again there should be
[56:29] no schism
[56:30] in the body no separation no division
[56:34] amen we're one again
[56:37] tempered together but that members
[56:39] should have the same
[56:41] care one for another no
[56:44] uh of one over the other
[56:48] uh no respect for persons we should have
[56:51] the same care one for another
[56:53] we should care just as much for that
[56:55] person in china
[56:56] as you do for your own family your own
[56:58] church we should care about that one in
[57:00] russia or in
[57:01] or north korea or wherever they are
[57:04] friend they're from every nation tongue
[57:06] kindred people
[57:08] we should carry them as much as we do
[57:10] our own home
[57:12] much as we do our own church and family
[57:14] and people
[57:15] because we're together care same one for
[57:18] them whether one member suffer
[57:20] all the members suffer with it one
[57:22] member be honored all the members
[57:23] rejoice with it
[57:25] now ye of the body of christ and members
[57:28] in particular
[57:29] was rolled together now we've got that
[57:31] body that body that's been
[57:33] built that body's been built
[57:36] it's it's it's laid its foundation
[57:39] this body's still the spiritual house it
[57:42] gets built all the time it can
[57:44] or we'll just say it's built but it's
[57:46] refining god refines it all the time
[57:49] see just like he does the body bride
[57:51] body
[57:52] refining all the time still building
[57:54] still coming
[57:55] together we're all part of the same body
[57:58] i mean when that last one comes in from
[58:00] we know
[58:01] the rapture takes place when is that i
[58:03] mean has it already taken place
[58:05] we don't know but i do know that
[58:08] that whole body is going to come fitly
[58:10] framed together
[58:12] joined together this holy spirit the
[58:14] spirit of god the
[58:16] mechanics and dynamics vulcanizing and
[58:19] bringing her together
[58:21] it's brought together the auspice of
[58:23] jesus christ the word
[58:25] because she is the word and the
[58:27] revelation that word
[58:28] having the preeminence in you making you
[58:32] that that preeminence today that god is
[58:34] called
[58:35] that god is orchestrated that god would
[58:37] have the headship

[59:03] personally
[59:04] in obedience to god's word the fullness
[59:07] of god's word not a few select
[59:09] scriptures not just the new testament

[59:19] increase increase
[59:21] god reveals that to you god shows that
[59:23] to you
[59:24] now importance the importance to
[59:26] understanding
[59:28] you can't reveal something to you you
[59:30] don't know
[59:32] you have to know it first faith first
[59:34] faith comes by hearing
[59:36] hearing the word of god but you got to
[59:38] hear it first
[59:40] you have to read it first it has to be a
[59:43] part of your life first
[59:44] you can't just think that you could live
[59:46] on going to church or watching a stream
[59:48] service or something
[59:49] it has to be you in your revelation
[59:52] relationship
[59:53] with jesus christ on a daily basis
[59:56] that god then can reveal it to you
[59:59] because then that's where the increase
[1:00:00] comes
[1:00:01] bringing that building up plumbing
[1:00:03] square
[1:00:04] mechanics dynamics holy spirit and work
[1:00:07] together
[1:00:08] making that building a perfect place now
[1:00:10] you've got a building that's on a
[1:00:12] beautiful foundation

[1:01:30] forward to it
[1:01:31] amen i pray something was said today to

[1:01:38] keep you prosperous and healthy and
[1:01:40] strong and keep us hedged
[1:01:42] from all the germs diseases afflictions
[1:01:45] everything around us friend
[1:01:46] you know i was praying i believe it was
[1:01:48] yesterday i can't remember for sure but
[1:01:50] you know it's just talking to the lord i
[1:01:53] was thinking lord how it is it seems
[1:01:55] and it just came on my mind how it is it
[1:01:57] seems that you know we used to live in
[1:01:59] florida and
[1:02:00] that's kind of hurricane territory we
[1:02:02] had a hurricane come through and
[1:02:04] uh we're kind of skirted where we lived
[1:02:06] but
[1:02:07] they always talked about the eye of that
[1:02:09] hurricane
[1:02:11] you look at a real good form very
[1:02:14] dangerous hurricane
[1:02:16] there's a big beautiful eye using right
[1:02:18] in the middle of that thing that
[1:02:20] everything's swirling around but you
[1:02:22] look in the middle of that eye
[1:02:24] and in the middle of all that swirling
[1:02:26] wind 100 mile an hour tornadoes
[1:02:28] lightning thunder rain wind in the
[1:02:31] middle
[1:02:32] it's just just calm is it it's just
[1:02:35] very little no wind even the sun will
[1:02:38] poke through that little hole
[1:02:40] that you can even look up in the middle
[1:02:42] of that and you'll be right in the
[1:02:43] middle of the hurricane
[1:02:44] you look up and there's the sun i
[1:02:47] thought lord i feel that way a lot of
[1:02:48] times
[1:02:49] just sitting in that eye i feel like we
[1:02:52] kind of
[1:02:54] are that as his people as his bride
[1:02:57] sitting in that eye there with the world
[1:02:59] swirling all around us and everything
[1:03:01] that's going on
[1:03:02] violence and the the
[1:03:05] the politics and the and the covet
[1:03:08] everything is happening all that's just
[1:03:10] swirling all around we're sitting here
[1:03:12] right in that eye
[1:03:13] looking up at the sunshine calm winds
[1:03:17] because that's how our lives are with
[1:03:18] jesus now sometimes we stick our arm out
[1:03:20] or get our leg out or something and
[1:03:22] we we're getting some of those
[1:03:24] tumultuous winds and stuff
[1:03:26] but god helps us get back to that eye
[1:03:30] helps us get back to that place and
[1:03:31] everything around us is just seems like
[1:03:33] going crazy
[1:03:34] i mean it literally just seems like it's
[1:03:36] going crazy some pretty
[1:03:38] we know by the word what was going to
[1:03:40] happen we know what brother branham told
[1:03:42] us but
[1:03:42] it's it i'll be honest for me
[1:03:45] it it's just challenging for me to watch
[1:03:48] i
[1:03:48] it disturbs me uh
[1:03:52] but i love god love his people i'm so
[1:03:56] thankful he keeps us in the eye of that
[1:03:58] storm keeps us the words a lot of times
[1:04:01] he keeps us calm
[1:04:03] you know if we can have faith and belief
[1:04:05] now got to have faith in believer
[1:04:06] there's no calm
[1:04:08] and then god keeps us there and keeps us
