[31:09] Lord Jesus, it's a honor and a privilege
[31:12] to be here once again. Yes, Lord. In
[31:15] your presence. Thank you, Jesus. In your
[31:17] house of worship. And Lord, we know that
[31:21] the end time signs are displaying
[31:25] themselves clear than ever before.
[31:28] It's like the prophet said, the flashing
[31:30] red lights of his coming. The train is
[31:33] almost here. Yes. Amen. Father, it's
[31:36] time to really examine our hearts to see
[31:40] where we stand with you. The devil knows
[31:44] his job. He's fighting us harder than
[31:47] ever before. He's giving us excuses not
[31:51] to pray, not to read your word, not to
[31:56] come to church. Oh Lord, not to pay our
[31:59] tithes. These are simple things. Just
[32:02] like the prophet said, we don't fail God
[32:05] in the greater things, the harder
[32:08] things. We fail you, Father, in the
[32:11] simple things. Yes, Lord. And Lord, we
[32:14] want to be better Christians. That's why
[32:16] we're here, Father. We're here to dwell
[32:20] in your presence. You gave us a promise
[32:23] that when two or three are gathered in
[32:25] your name, you'll be in the midst. Yes,
[32:27] Lord. You're here, Father.
[32:30] You You don't gather because there's so
[32:34] many people that needs to be in
[32:36] attendance in the service. You there
[32:38] might be like you said in your word two
[32:41] or three, you said, "I'll be there. I'll
[32:45] I'll fellowship with you. I'll minister
[32:48] to your hearts. I'll grant to you the
[32:50] desires of your heart. Thank you, Jesus.
[32:53] And Lord, the prophet said, I heard him
[32:56] if there's the need of healing. You hold
[33:01] to that promise. You hold to it with all
[33:05] that's in your heart. For God's word
[33:08] will not fail. Amen. God's word will
[33:12] bring to pass whatever we have needed.
[33:15] Thank you, Lord Jesus. And there's many
[33:17] that need a healing touch this morning.
[33:20] Father, there are several that are sick.
[33:23] Several my brother and sister Shiah that
[33:26] had trouble sleeping. Well, there's our
[33:30] sister Mat's been dealing with
[33:33] a a cold or flu symptoms for quite a
[33:38] while. Our sister Lady Father, who's
[33:43] been away from us for a while,
[33:45] she'sing's trying to regain her
[33:46] strength. She's trying to get back to
[33:49] normaly. Oh father, there's our brother
[33:53] Zach who's dealing with vertigo. I've
[33:56] dealt with it. It's a terrible thing. Oh
[33:59] Lord, and
[34:01] and our sister Sheilia will be
[34:05] traveling. Lord, grant her and her
[34:08] family traveling mercy. Grant it, Lord
[34:10] Jesus. and use our sister to be a light
[34:14] amongst her family.
[34:16] I heard your prophet say, "Father, that
[34:18] the only Bible some people will ever see
[34:22] is the Bible that's in us. You your word
[34:26] dwelling in us and they won't have an
[34:29] excuse, Father." Yes. And Lord, touch
[34:33] each and everyone. There's some I
[34:35] overlooked. I can't remember them all.
[34:38] But Lord, you know who they are. Yes,
[34:41] Lord Jesus. You know that they're part
[34:44] of your family, the family of
[34:48] God. Lord, you are our great physician,
[34:51] our high priest that can be touched by
[34:54] the feelings of our infirmities. And by
[34:58] your stripes, we are healed. We grant
[35:00] each and everyone that's sick their
[35:03] healing touch, their portion, their
[35:06] deliverance. Oh, may their testimonies
[35:09] come that you have come on the scene and
[35:12] you have grant them the desires of their
[35:15] heart. Thank you, Jesus. Bless our
[35:17] brother, Lord, who's faithful in your
[35:20] word. He's not looking at numbers. He's
[35:24] looking at the hearts like he said
[35:26] already that he's so happy to see it has
[35:28] come. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, use our
[35:30] brother to speak to our hearts that
[35:33] bring forth the bread of life, knowing
[35:36] that faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[35:39] of the word of God. Granted, Father, in
[35:42] your precious and holy name, we pray in
[35:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[35:49] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[35:51] seated today if you'd like.
[35:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thankful that the
[35:57] Lord is with us.
[35:59] Amen. Praise God. Turning over to Psalm
[36:02] number 591. We'll have it on the screen
[36:04] here, too.
[36:06] 591. The book. You want to look at the
[36:08] book.
[36:09] 591. Amen. Praise the Lord. Who I am,
[36:13] Lord. Amen. Who I am, Lord. It's the
[36:18] revelation. This bride comes to know who
[36:20] she is. Amen. Praise the
[36:23] Lord. Looking forward to
[36:25] that. Let's sing it now.
[36:29] Oh, glorious
[36:33] victory. That day he set me
[36:37] free and made my
[36:41] heart his very
[36:45] throne. My life is no longer mine.
[36:50] I'm a prisoner of love
[36:53] divine and now I
[36:58] live to praise his
[37:02] name. Who I am
[37:07] Lord. Who I
[37:11] am. I can see
[37:15] now who I am.
[37:20] I'm a part of my
[37:22] [Music]
[37:24] savior, a part of his
[37:28] word. It's a
[37:32] revelation of who I
[37:36] am. Oh
[37:39] Calvary, he
[37:41] died to redeem his lost bride.
[37:46] The king of
[37:48] [Applause]
[37:49] kings became my
[37:53] savior. This is God's great
[37:58] mystery of his love expressed to
[38:02] me that Christ and
[38:05] [Music]
[38:06] I might be made
[38:10] one. Tell who I am,
[38:15] Lord. Who I
[38:19] am. I can see
[38:23] now just who I
[38:27] am. I'm a part of my
[38:32] Savior, a part of his
[38:36] word. It's revelation.
[38:41] of who I
[38:44] am. Yes, who I am,
[38:49] Lord. Who I
[38:53] am. I can see
[38:58] now who I am.
[39:02] I'm a part of my
[39:06] savior, a part of his
[39:10] word. It's
[39:14] revelation is
[39:18] predestination of who I
[39:21] [Music]
[39:24] am. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[39:29] Amen. Thank you, Father, for that
[39:32] revelation. Amen. That revelation of who
[39:35] we are in him. Amen. Praise the Lord
[39:37] Jesus. Not who we are in our natural
[39:40] minds and our natural thinking. Not who
[39:42] we are in this flesh body, but who we
[39:44] are in him. Praise the Lord. That that
[39:47] God saw us before the foundation of the
[39:50] world. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:52] That's how he sees us today. I'm so
[39:55] thankful for that, friend. Because if he
[39:57] didn't see us that way, I would have no
[39:59] hope. Amen. Oh my. But praise the Lord
[40:02] Jesus. He sees us as he saw us before
[40:06] the foundation of the world. Amen.
[40:08] Perfect, sinless. Amen. That's why he
[40:10] took our place. Amen. He took our place
[40:13] so we could take his. Amen. To become
[40:15] him. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[40:19] Amen. So thankful. Let's stand to our
[40:20] feet if we could. We'll go ahead and
[40:22] change the ser uh order of the
[40:24] service. Amen.
[40:27] Appreciate everyone's prayers. U me and
[40:30] Sonia had a good trip this last week. We
[40:33] uh had a good safe trip and uh blessed
[40:36] trip and thankful that the Lord watched
[40:38] over us, kept us safe and uh just had a
[40:41] real good time being away and taking
[40:43] some time together and alone and very
[40:46] thankful that the Lord blessed us and
[40:48] bless the travel. Um I'm leaving again
[40:51] today. So appreciate your prayers for
[40:53] that, but I'm leaving again today.
[40:56] My flight leaves at 1:55. So, same one I
[41:00] had last week. So, thankful the Lord's
[41:02] always mine.
[41:04] Praise the Lord Jesus. We're going to
[41:06] turn the scripture now to St. John uh
[41:09] chapter
[41:11] 12. We're going to try to kind of pick
[41:13] up where we left off last week if we
[41:15] could maybe background a little of that
[41:18] uh from last week. St. John chapter
[41:21] 12. Praise the Lord.
[41:25] probably not be very long today,
[41:27] but just as the Lord leads. Amen. Amen.
[41:31] St. John chapter 12. Going to read two
[41:33] verses of scripture here that we read
[41:35] last week. St. John 12 23 and
[41:39] 24. Amen. Before we do, can we just bow
[41:42] our heads for another word of
[41:43] prayer? Precious Jesus, again, thankful,
[41:46] Father, of all that you've done for us,
[41:48] Lord. Thank you for this place. Thank
[41:50] you for this time. Thank you for this
[41:52] service, Lord. Thank you for those that
[41:54] have come today, Lord, and sacrificed
[41:56] their time to be here. God, may you
[41:58] bless them exceedingly. Those who may be
[42:00] watching, Father, streaming with us
[42:01] today, God. May you bless them as well,
[42:04] Father. Keep us in your protective care,
[42:06] Lord, as we look to you for all things
[42:08] today. God, may you speak through these
[42:10] lips the words you'd have us to hear.
[42:12] Father, may it be according to your
[42:14] perfect will, Father. anoint our ears to
[42:16] receive that and reveal to us Lord that
[42:18] that you'd have us to see and know
[42:20] because it is truly a revelation Lord
[42:22] today of who we a portion of your bride
[42:26] each of us and your bride worldwide who
[42:29] we are in you Lord is truly a revelation
[42:32] something shown to us to recognize Lord
[42:34] it's no longer us Lord but it's you God
[42:37] it's nothing that we can do nothing we
[42:39] can say but you've already done it Lord
[42:42] you've done it all you've given us
[42:44] everything we have a need of. Lord, you
[42:45] hung there and you said that it is
[42:48] finished. When you said it is finished,
[42:50] that meant it was finished. All we can
[42:52] do is receive, accept, and believe
[42:54] today, God, for you have already done
[42:56] the work. So many people today seem to
[42:59] try to work themselves towards
[43:01] salvation. They try to work themselves
[43:03] into the kingdom of God or work
[43:05] themselves into receiving the Holy
[43:07] Spirit. But it's just so simple. It's
[43:10] just so easy. Just believe. Just believe
[43:13] and trust God. Accept, Lord, your word.
[43:16] And Lord, we know that you give to those
[43:18] who according to your scripture. Follow
[43:21] your scripture, Lord. Because Father,
[43:24] your prophet said that full obedience to
[43:26] your word entitles us to that token.
[43:28] Amen. Lord, that full obedience that we
[43:31] have to repent and are baptized, receive
[43:33] the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ, living in
[43:36] us again. Lord, may you take complete
[43:38] control of the remaining part of the
[43:39] service. We commit it to you, Lord, and
[43:41] pray your Holy Spirit would have
[43:43] preeminence. Speak through these lips
[43:45] again. Anoint our ears, Lord, to receive
[43:47] that and let it be accomplished, Lord,
[43:49] that you sent it forth for today. We'll
[43:51] thank you and praise you for all things.
[43:53] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[43:54] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. St. John 12,
[43:59] 2:es, 23- 24. We'll read. Jesus answered
[44:03] them, saying, "The hour has come that
[44:06] the Son of Man should be glorified.
[44:08] Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a
[44:10] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[44:13] die, it abideth alone. But if it but if
[44:16] it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
[44:20] Amen. You can be seated if you'd
[44:22] like. Amen. As we go back over to Acts
[44:25] chapter 2. Amen. And read that scripture
[44:28] again to try to continue to kickstart.
[44:30] This will be the adoption part 10. Uh
[44:33] the bride part two. Amen. And so this is
[44:36] the adoption part 10, the bride part
[44:39] two. Praise the Lord. So we kickstart in
[44:42] that scripture recognizing that Jesus
[44:44] said, "I'm sure obviously probably in my
[44:47] opinion that when Jesus spoke this, they
[44:50] probably had no idea what he was talking
[44:51] about." Amen. Although he prophesied and
[44:54] told them several times what was going
[44:56] to happen and what was happening, uh, it
[44:59] would go right over their heads. I'm
[45:01] sure a lot of that happened when brother
[45:02] Brandon was here and a lot of things
[45:04] that were ministered said probably went
[45:06] right over people's heads didn't
[45:07] understand it. Uh you can listen on tape
[45:10] and say I'm sure you understand and the
[45:12] congregation says amen. And I bet
[45:14] probably 10% or less understood it. But
[45:16] it's okay. Uh we we all kind of fall in
[45:20] that category sometimes, but we get down
[45:22] and say, "Well, Lord, um uh I know me
[45:26] and my wife have been in places and
[45:28] heard ministers speak and things just
[45:30] didn't quite add up from what we know
[45:32] and what the scripture says and all and
[45:35] people are shouting and screaming and
[45:36] we're sitting there uh because there
[45:40] there's nothing there uh to scream about
[45:43] for us." So, uh, anyway, we just it just
[45:46] happens to be, but maybe the it wasn't
[45:48] our time. I don't know. Uh, although
[45:51] that was 20, 30 years ago, and I guess
[45:53] it still hasn't time because I still
[45:55] look at some of that and think, what
[45:57] were they talking about? But, uh,
[45:59] anyway, the Lord is still mindful.
[46:01] Praise the Lord. And I believe that even
[46:03] after that Jesus said that I'm sure they
[46:06] begin to start as the mo the the Holy
[46:09] Spirit moved in and they become born
[46:10] again and the Holy Spirit spoke to them
[46:12] that they began to recognize a lot of
[46:14] the things that probably they didn't
[46:16] recognize the beginning probably like a
[46:18] lot of those people and things that I
[46:20] listened to. I mean, when I first came
[46:22] and became a Christian, a lot of things
[46:24] I heard and listened to and people that
[46:26] seemed to accept as something that was
[46:28] uh uh common knowledge I didn't
[46:31] understand or I didn't get or it it
[46:33] wasn't something that was uh knowledge
[46:35] to me or whatever, if you will. But but
[46:38] since then after growing and ministering
[46:40] and over 30 years now it you comes to a
[46:42] place and the Lord reveals stuff to you
[46:45] and it starts getting to where it it
[46:48] starts making I hate saying the word
[46:49] sense but it starts making sense. It
[46:51] start the puzzle starts coming together.
[46:54] And you put it together and you say,
[46:55] "Okay, I that that I can see why that
[46:59] come from there and why that was said
[47:01] there and what the Lord was talking
[47:02] about here and what the prophet was
[47:04] talking about here and and then when it
[47:06] starts the puzzle starts coming together
[47:08] starts looking like a picture. That
[47:10] picture then uh is a common picture. You
[47:12] look at it makes sense. You look at it
[47:14] and say well that's the way it's
[47:16] supposed to be." Amen. And it's supposed
[47:17] to add up. Revelation 1 to re uh Genesis
[47:20] 1 to Revelation 22. It all supposed to
[47:22] dubtail perfectly together. If any of it
[47:24] is wrong, if any of it is out of cater,
[47:26] if any of it is not uh inspired, then
[47:29] it's then none of then how can you trust
[47:31] any of it. Right? Amen. If there's
[47:34] anything wrong, like I've said many
[47:36] times before, if there's anything wrong,
[47:38] it's not the word, it's not the message,
[47:40] the problems with me. Yes. Amen. I need
[47:43] to get myself right because there's
[47:44] nothing wrong with this, right? So if
[47:47] there's a problem, the problem is with
[47:49] me. Yes. Amen. Or if anybody thinks
[47:51] there's something contrary or
[47:53] something, read it again. Amen. I had a
[47:57] a very close brother. Well, I knew him
[48:00] and a brother from his church used to
[48:03] come and minister us in Florida a lot.
[48:05] His name was Dale Catch. Uh if you've
[48:08] got a lot of quote books or something
[48:09] that you've seen through the years, he
[48:12] compiled most of those books that you've
[48:14] probably seen, had or maybe even still
[48:16] have. He's passed on now. But I remember
[48:19] brother Dell gave me a testimony one
[48:21] time that uh when he came into the
[48:24] message and the truth and he started uh
[48:26] listening this there's only one God.
[48:28] There's uh there's not three gods.
[48:30] There's no trinity. And uh that he told
[48:33] me he said that was the hardest thing he
[48:34] had to grasp. uh you just couldn't see
[48:37] it. It just didn't make sense to him.
[48:40] And he would he he was in the message
[48:42] and he would preach the word, but he it
[48:45] just you just couldn't get that. And he
[48:47] said the Holy Spirit uh inspired him to
[48:52] read the the Gospels and Acts all the
[48:55] way through. And he said he read the
[48:58] Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
[49:00] and Acts. Did it again. Matthew, Mark,
[49:02] Luke, John, and Acts. Matthew, Mark, he
[49:05] said about halfway through, the third
[49:07] time of reading those all the way
[49:08] through, the Lord revealed it to him.
[49:11] Amen. It became clear. He saw it as he
[49:14] said the third I think if I'm right, the
[49:16] third time through as he was getting
[49:18] through, it became clear to him and he
[49:20] said, and that was it. And then once you
[49:23] see it, you can't unsee it. It's there.
[49:26] Praise the Lord. And it's God revealing
[49:28] himself. And when you get it, you
[49:30] understand that it makes sense. See, and
[49:32] I'm sure when Jesus said, "Except the
[49:34] corn of wheat fall on the ground," they
[49:36] didn't realize he was talking about
[49:37] himself. I'm sure they didn't realize
[49:39] they were that he was talking about
[49:41] himself or any botney life. If you
[49:43] understand uh the progression of life,
[49:46] uh God made botney life, he made animal
[49:48] life, and he made human life. But he put
[49:51] in each one of those the the process of
[49:54] life. He put in everyone. People talk
[49:57] about being vegetarians because they
[49:58] don't want to eat animals. Well, you
[50:00] realize the lettuce has to die for you
[50:02] to for you to live. The lettuce had to
[50:05] die. Yeah. I mean, don't have eyeballs.
[50:08] Maybe like an animal does, but the the
[50:10] lettuce had to die. The cucumber had to
[50:12] die. The tomato had to die. There was
[50:14] life in that tomato before you plucked
[50:16] it off the plant and shoved it in your
[50:18] face. There was there was food in there
[50:20] was there was life in that tomato before
[50:22] you took it off. Amen. There was life in
[50:24] that animal. There's there's human life.
[50:27] See, God put in every one of them that
[50:29] process of life. Yeah. And that's why
[50:31] God always types in the scripture and
[50:33] what brother Brandham looking at nature
[50:35] typed that into the scripture and
[50:38] recognizing that that that that that
[50:40] scripture that God had that process of
[50:43] life. And in every one of those
[50:46] processes of life is in itself the
[50:48] ability to reproduce life. Embody life.
[50:51] The ability to reproduce life. They
[50:53] don't procreate like humans do. Amen. or
[50:56] animals do, but in it is life. There's
[50:58] seed. There's seed life. There's seed
[51:01] life in animal life. Amen. Way to
[51:03] reproduce. There's seed life in the
[51:05] human life. A way to reproduce life to
[51:07] continue to keep life going. That's how
[51:10] life keeps going. That's why God
[51:12] continues to uh uh to bring example as
[51:15] Jesus said, a corn of wheat. What's he
[51:17] talking about? Botney life. He's put in
[51:20] an example of his life being dead,
[51:23] buried, rising again in in botney life,
[51:28] not animal life. He he he typed it to
[51:31] botney life. A corn of wheat falling
[51:33] into the ground. If a corn of wheat does
[51:36] not fall on the ground and die and rot
[51:38] and come back again, it abides alone.
[51:40] It's just one seed. But if it comes up
[51:42] again, it produces multiple seeds. If
[51:46] Jesus was here by himself, had not died
[51:48] and gone into the grave uh and gone to
[51:52] hell and conquered death, hell, and the
[51:54] grave and come back and rose again, then
[51:57] there wouldn't be all of us, right? It
[51:59] would just be him, right? Just like it
[52:01] was in the beginning. It was God. God
[52:03] alone. Amen. He created human life. And
[52:06] human life very shortly after creation
[52:09] fell. And when human life fell, all of
[52:12] creation fell. Animal life fell. body
[52:15] life fell. There was no thorn on a rose
[52:17] bush before the humanity fell. Right?
[52:20] There there was no need for the lion to
[52:22] be the lamb to be scared of the lion
[52:25] before the fall. All of nature fell when
[52:29] human life fell. So it wasn't short
[52:31] after that human life fell and have
[52:33] failed God ever since. Yes. Human life
[52:37] has really in my opinion has pretty much
[52:40] done nothing but fail God ever since
[52:42] that time. That's right. And we're still
[52:44] failing him. Yes. Amen. Even though we
[52:46] come to him and we give ourselves every
[52:49] day, the sticky flesh, you make mistakes
[52:51] and do things. We're failing him every
[52:52] day. All the time. Brother Ram said,
[52:54] Brother Green said told him that
[52:57] everything that you do in the eyes of
[52:58] God is is sin. So God help us to think I
[53:02] have any righteousness. All my
[53:03] righteousness according to the scripture
[53:05] is filthy rags in God's eyes. So what
[53:07] have I got to offer God? I don't have
[53:09] anything to offer him.
[53:12] There's nothing good I can give to him.
[53:14] Only the grace that he's shone in my
[53:16] life is the only thing that I have that
[53:18] I can claim to of being anything good at
[53:21] all because he is the only one that is
[53:23] good. Amen. So God Jesus typing himself
[53:28] even to botney life going back to seed
[53:30] life. Unless that seed goes in the
[53:32] ground and and dies and rots, amen, it
[53:36] just it's just one seed. It just abides
[53:38] alone. Amen. But when it rots, dies and
[53:41] rots and comes back, it comes back like
[53:44] he did on the day of Pentecost. And when
[53:46] the day of Pentecost was fully come,
[53:49] they were all with one accord in one
[53:50] place. And suddenly there came a sound
[53:52] from heaven as a rushing mighty wind of
[53:55] the God comes as we said the other day
[53:57] waving over the people. Amen. Because he
[54:00] come back from the dead. Now it's not
[54:01] just him. It's not just one. It's not
[54:04] just a corn of wheat or a or a single
[54:07] seed. What it is now is that life has
[54:10] come up and it's waved over the people.
[54:14] And all the house was filled. Praise the
[54:16] Lord. Where they were sitting. And there
[54:19] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[54:20] as a fire. And it set upon each of them.
[54:22] And they were all filled with the Holy
[54:24] Ghost. Began to speak with other
[54:26] tongues. And the spirit gave them
[54:27] utters. Now you got 120, not just one
[54:29] seed, but 120 that are there that
[54:31] received that on that day. After Peter
[54:34] began to preach to them, 3,000 souls
[54:37] were added to the kingdom that day.
[54:39] 3,000. Amen. So now it was no longer
[54:42] one. Praise the Lord. Now I'm I don't
[54:45] believe it was 3,000 to the exact
[54:48] number. When you look in the scripture,
[54:50] you look and see many times that you can
[54:52] actually prove in the scripture um like
[54:56] uh uh like the number of years that they
[54:59] were in the children of Israel captive
[55:01] in Egypt. Amen. Was exactly to the day
[55:05] that many years of people want to hold
[55:07] everything to the exact but may not have
[55:09] been exactly 3,000, but we recognize
[55:12] approximately 3,000 people. Amen. We're
[55:15] added to the kingdom that day. Amen.
[55:18] Praise the Lord. Now, now it's not just
[55:20] one. Now, it's not just Jesus walking
[55:22] around and everybody following him.
[55:25] There's 3,000 plus of 120 speaking with
[55:29] tongues, knocking and kicking out the
[55:30] walls and people coming around and in
[55:33] amazement. So, what is going on with
[55:35] these people? And then Peter spoke up
[55:38] and said this, "They're not drunk as you
[55:40] supposed, but the spirit of God has
[55:43] returned and fallen upon these people."
[55:45] Joel prophesied that that would happen.
[55:47] Amen. He does. He tells them Joel
[55:49] prophesied that this would happen. But
[55:50] what you're seeing is the fulfillment of
[55:52] the scripture. Amen.
[55:54] Don't look at these people with a wrong
[55:56] eye. Recognize this is God working.
[55:58] Yeah. This is God in motion. This is God
[56:00] and his people. This is God fulfilling
[56:03] his word. And 3,000 souls were added.
[56:06] Amen. Not just one. Now, now you don't
[56:08] have just one man with people following
[56:11] around. You got 3,000 people scattered
[56:13] all over trying to uh spreading the
[56:16] gospel. Amen. telling maybe hopefully
[56:19] everybody they see about what they
[56:20] experienced and what was going on, what
[56:23] was happening. Praise the Lord. Because
[56:25] it was God that ministered to their
[56:27] hearts and so that they could see that
[56:29] it was God returning. Christ died. Amen.
[56:33] Went to hell and rose again. Amen. As he
[56:36] did, remember the corn of wheat as the
[56:39] church was born here. Amen. We talked
[56:42] about last week. As the church was born
[56:44] here, it fell into the ground and died
[56:47] under Nia Rome. Amen. 320 AD it died.
[56:52] Talked about the church ages recognizing
[56:54] that uh the church ages that uh that uh
[56:58] were represented here in the scripture.
[57:00] 320 AD would have been Smyrnia. If you
[57:02] go back and read Smyrnia because we're
[57:04] not doing a study on the church ages per
[57:06] se, but if you go back and you read in
[57:08] Smyrnia, you'll find out what God had
[57:10] against them. Amen. You go in Ephesians
[57:13] and look that basically Jesus is telling
[57:16] the Ephesian church age who had the most
[57:18] light of any age. Why? Because it was
[57:20] the birth of this church, right? The
[57:22] church was birthed poor. It went through
[57:25] this from 53 170 went through the
[57:28] Ephesian church age but it started to
[57:30] wayne a little bit. Why? He said you
[57:32] left your first love. Some simple, isn't
[57:36] it? Yes. Just to think something as
[57:38] simple as just love. Amen. Amen.
[57:41] something that the world's made a
[57:42] mockery of. That's probably a lot of the
[57:44] big problem. The world's made a mockery
[57:46] of love because they don't know what
[57:47] love is. Yes. All they know is what a
[57:50] filio love or human love or love that
[57:52] says I'll love you if you love me. I'll
[57:54] do good to you if you do good to me.
[57:55] That's not God's love. That's right.
[57:57] Amen. God's love says, "I'll love you."
[57:59] Period. Amen. Amen. God's love says,
[58:01] "I'll do for you whether you do for me
[58:03] or not." God's love is unconditional.
[58:05] And man has perverted God's love. But
[58:08] what love is he talking about? He's
[58:10] talking about his love. God's love, not
[58:13] man's love. You have left your first
[58:16] love. What was the first love? Well,
[58:18] they found it right here on the day of
[58:20] Pentecost. That was their first love.
[58:23] So, they started going away from that,
[58:25] the Holy Spirit that fell on that day
[58:27] and they started to gravitate over
[58:29] towards man. So that in the second the
[58:32] second church age in
[58:34] Smyrnia, it be got it began to get
[58:37] darker and darker. Amen. what happened
[58:40] with the children of Israel. They did
[58:42] the same
[58:43] thing. They went through Moses and saw
[58:46] all the miracles, all the things that
[58:48] happened through Moses and all the great
[58:50] things that Moses that God did through
[58:52] Moses. Amen. And and they come out on
[58:56] the other side and they're like, and
[58:58] they were still dissatisfied.
[59:00] I
[59:02] mean, I would say, how can you look at
[59:05] that and and see what God did for them?
[59:08] Pulling them out of Egypt in bondage,
[59:11] taking them across the Red Sea,
[59:13] destroying their enemy, all that God did
[59:15] for them. How can you look at that and
[59:17] still be dissatisfied? That's right. I
[59:20] would think and look back and read it
[59:21] and I think, how could those people
[59:23] still be so dissatisfied? But you know
[59:25] what? Is history does repeat itself. A
[59:29] lot of people the exact same way today
[59:31] dissatisfied over of all the things that
[59:34] God's done for us. We still seem
[59:35] sometimes to be dissatisfied with what
[59:38] God with the way our lives are going or
[59:40] what God's done. We seem dissatisfied or
[59:43] disappointed. Amen. How can we dis How
[59:46] can we as Christians, born again sons
[59:49] and daughters of God, be disappointed at
[59:51] what God has done for us if he has done
[59:53] nothing but save you? If God has done
[59:56] nothing but put his life in you, what
[59:59] else could you ask? Amen. Now, I know we
[1:00:02] have all the blessings and benefits of
[1:00:04] the scripture that God has given us and
[1:00:06] we have those benefits. We are the
[1:00:08] beneficiaries of that. Go to Hebrews and
[1:00:10] find out that we are the beneficiary of
[1:00:13] the word that he wrote that he came back
[1:00:16] and lived again to make right. usually a
[1:00:19] beneficiary. Uh uh the benefactor the
[1:00:22] person has to die for someone to become
[1:00:25] a beneficiary. Amen. For me to get for
[1:00:28] me to get something in the will I they
[1:00:30] have to die first for me to get that.
[1:00:32] Well, Jesus died but he rose again to
[1:00:34] fulfill what he promised he would give
[1:00:36] us. Amen. Praise the Lord. So now we
[1:00:39] have what God's given us. But he didn't
[1:00:41] but if he didn't do anything but save
[1:00:44] us, redeem us, fill us with his spirit,
[1:00:47] what else could we ask for? Yes. And yet
[1:00:49] still sometimes we seem dissatisfied.
[1:00:51] Yes. God help us all. Amen. Amen. God
[1:00:54] help us. But the children of Israel seem
[1:00:56] seem so dissatisfied. So whether they're
[1:00:59] like we know this and we know that and
[1:01:01] we've seen that happen and we've seen
[1:01:02] this happen, but we we we still want a
[1:01:05] king over us, right? We still want a
[1:01:08] king, but God's given you everything.
[1:01:11] God's brought you into this land. God's
[1:01:14] fulfilled every promise. God's this,
[1:01:15] that, and the other. Yeah, we know. But
[1:01:17] we still want a king. We still want
[1:01:19] somebody over us. That's exact history
[1:01:23] repeating itself. Amen. We know what
[1:01:26] happened on Pentecost. We know these
[1:01:27] things that we know the the the the
[1:01:30] disciples and we know all these. But
[1:01:32] what we we still want somebody over us.
[1:01:35] We we still need to uh denominate and
[1:01:38] have this hierarchy or something that
[1:01:40] rules over us. We need to have something
[1:01:42] more than that. See they so they
[1:01:44] rejected God. Left their first love.
[1:01:47] rejected God to accept man. And just
[1:01:49] like God did to them, the children of
[1:01:52] Israel, he did the exact same thing
[1:01:54] here. Amen. He said, "Okay, you want a
[1:01:57] king, I'll give you a king." Amen. I'll
[1:02:00] give you a king. And they and he did. He
[1:02:02] gave him a king. And you see how that
[1:02:04] turned out, right? When man is ruling
[1:02:06] over, you see how that turned out?
[1:02:09] First, you see Saul and then what did
[1:02:11] Saul do? Saul, God finally had to just
[1:02:13] take Saul out, sent Samuel up and said,
[1:02:15] "Since you since you've disobeyed
[1:02:18] everything God said, God's taken you and
[1:02:20] your kingdom away from you and given it
[1:02:21] to a man after his own heart." Gave it
[1:02:24] to David, right? And and and David was a
[1:02:27] good man. But look at how that kingdom
[1:02:29] continued to pro progress.
[1:02:32] Israel and Judah and how wicked men,
[1:02:34] horrible men got to the place that you
[1:02:37] ended up with an Ahab and Jezebel and uh
[1:02:41] Ahab and Jezebel. Amen. That's right.
[1:02:44] God had to basically tell them. He he
[1:02:46] actually fed Jezebel to the dogs, right?
[1:02:49] And send Elijah to prophesy that that
[1:02:52] Ahab's the dogs would lick up his blood.
[1:02:55] They were so crooked and so evil. Amen.
[1:02:59] Well, what did it do here? God did the
[1:03:01] same thing. We'll just turn you over.
[1:03:04] Amen. And and as it did and they waned
[1:03:07] away from following the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:09] going into man and 320 Pgamus AD, they
[1:03:14] denominated. They denominated and died
[1:03:17] right there. Right? And you see that
[1:03:19] Pergamus age probably has a fourth of
[1:03:21] light. A fourth of the age is light now.
[1:03:23] Which led into Thyra, which is basically
[1:03:26] almost gone, right? the next two that
[1:03:29] died. See, they had to die there. Amen.
[1:03:32] And through the dark ages, that seed
[1:03:34] rotted. Amen. Because like we read last
[1:03:37] week, Revelation 9, that spirit was even
[1:03:39] bound. The Holy Spirit was bound not at
[1:03:42] the not at the river Euphrates. As we as
[1:03:45] we read the 200,000,000, 200 million
[1:03:48] horsemen were bound by the river
[1:03:49] Euphrates. It was bound. The Holy Spirit
[1:03:52] was bound to move in the church. Amen.
[1:03:56] Even though there were bride there, even
[1:03:58] though there were Holy Ghost fil people
[1:04:00] there, the Holy Spirit could not move in
[1:04:02] that atmosphere because the church order
[1:04:05] had it bound right to where the Holy
[1:04:08] Spirit couldn't even move in those
[1:04:09] church ages. And you see barely just a
[1:04:12] little bit of life. Amen. Amen. And it
[1:04:16] would have gone completely away. That's
[1:04:18] right. But that seed that rotted in the
[1:04:21] ground, it fell in the ground. It died
[1:04:22] at Na rotted during the dark ages. But
[1:04:26] what they fell to see was the little
[1:04:28] sprig that was coming up from that corn
[1:04:30] of wheat that fell into the ground. So
[1:04:32] it wasn't Jesus, the corn of wheat that
[1:04:34] fell on the ground and rose again. It
[1:04:36] was the church wheat that fell on the
[1:04:37] ground and had to rise again. And they
[1:04:40] didn't recognize that little blade began
[1:04:42] to come up out of the ground again,
[1:04:44] brought a stalk, which was in Luther.
[1:04:46] And in that stalk was what was was life.
[1:04:50] Amen. There was life in that stalk. Life
[1:04:53] again. A life that had been squelched by
[1:04:55] man. And putting a pope uh uh uh uh as
[1:05:00] the as the pontiff over the people over
[1:05:04] all basically all of what they called
[1:05:06] Christianity, all of Christianom. The
[1:05:09] pope was over this pontiff. This instead
[1:05:12] of Christ uh was in its place. vicarious
[1:05:17] filidi in place of Christ, right? Which
[1:05:20] we know spells out 666, right? Amen.
[1:05:22] They put in its place and it died. It
[1:05:26] rotted.
[1:05:27] But then they fell to see in Luther's
[1:05:29] age. Luther Catholic
[1:05:33] priests saw the word and he began to
[1:05:36] realize this ain't about indulgences.
[1:05:40] This isn't about uh uh uh Hail Marys and
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:46] and what all the the Catholic thing.
[1:05:49] It's not all about the this indulgences.
[1:05:52] Well, you got to pay, you know, and
[1:05:53] everything is everything takes money.
[1:05:55] Again, you go to Revelation 6, you see a
[1:05:58] a corn of wheat, a a pound of wheat for
[1:06:01] a penny, and three measures of barley
[1:06:02] for a penny. Amen. And measuring out the
[1:06:05] wealth of the world, garnering the
[1:06:06] wealth of the world, making them pay for
[1:06:08] everything. Yeah. Oh, your dad died. Oh,
[1:06:11] he was an evil person. But if you pay me
[1:06:13] enough enough money, I'll pray him out
[1:06:15] of purgatory.
[1:06:18] Just just pay me enough and I'll get him
[1:06:20] out of there. Oh my the filth. Amen. But
[1:06:24] they didn't see there was life again in
[1:06:26] that stalk. That stalk of the corn and
[1:06:29] wheat that fell on the ground came back
[1:06:31] and started coming and bringing back
[1:06:32] life again. And Luther stood there and
[1:06:35] said, "The just shall live by faith."
[1:06:38] the 95 thesis nailed to the door to
[1:06:40] Wittenberg, Germany. Yes. Amen. His his
[1:06:43] exclamation to the church. Amen. And as
[1:06:47] as they continue to kill people that
[1:06:50] come against the church, reformers,
[1:06:53] uh you had the you had the reformation,
[1:06:56] you had the Renaissance, you had the the
[1:06:59] in the invention of the printing press
[1:07:02] and things you so so that they they as
[1:07:05] they kept the Bible away from the hands
[1:07:07] of the common people, they couldn't do
[1:07:09] it anymore because it was too many
[1:07:11] people getting thirsty for the truth
[1:07:12] because the light was coming up again.
[1:07:15] And as the life was coming up again,
[1:07:17] they missed it. And Luther with his the
[1:07:20] just shall live by faith go over into
[1:07:23] Wesley. And by this time, you had Bibles
[1:07:26] being mass- prodduced and people reading
[1:07:29] the Bible. Amen. People reading the
[1:07:32] Bible and saying the the church was
[1:07:35] wrong. Amen. This is not scripture.
[1:07:38] Amen. People still do it today though uh
[1:07:42] with all the things that they follow
[1:07:46] most of which are not scriptural. Yeah.
[1:07:48] Uh they they look at the scripture say
[1:07:51] where is in the scripture? Well now they
[1:07:53] just say well it doesn't matter what the
[1:07:55] Bible says because the pope is here
[1:07:58] instead of Christ and what he says is
[1:08:01] what you listen to. Right.
[1:08:05] Amen.
[1:08:07] putting that over Christ.
[1:08:11] But there was still a
[1:08:12] stalk. There was still life in the midst
[1:08:15] of the darkness. You see it start coming
[1:08:18] back in Sardis Age with Luther. It gets
[1:08:20] a little lighter in sanctification with
[1:08:23] Wesley when it comes up into the tossel.
[1:08:26] Amen. and of the wheat coming back
[1:08:27] again, the life coming back again into
[1:08:31] that restoration of the gifts and Isuza
[1:08:34] Street in 1906. The the the the life
[1:08:38] coming into the shuck. Amen. Which was
[1:08:41] the which was the pro protector of the
[1:08:44] real seed. The shuck's not the seed.
[1:08:48] It's a protector of the seed. The shuck
[1:08:50] is there to keep and to hold the seed,
[1:08:52] but it's not the seed. It looks a lot
[1:08:55] like the seed. Amen. The shuck looks a
[1:08:58] lot like the seed, but it is not the
[1:09:00] seed. The seed is inside the shuck. Yes.
[1:09:04] Amen. If it's in its infancy stage, you
[1:09:07] can pull back that shuck a little bit
[1:09:08] and look back in there. If you could,
[1:09:10] this is if you had maybe a magnifying
[1:09:13] glass or something, you see just a tiny
[1:09:15] bit of life, just a little piece of seed
[1:09:18] in there, right? Amen. just waiting to
[1:09:20] continue to blossom forth and become a
[1:09:22] full grain wheat like it was that fell
[1:09:26] into the ground. Amen. So the church
[1:09:29] died, Christ died, rose again. Church
[1:09:32] died, rose again. Apostle but and
[1:09:36] recognized in that stalk there was life.
[1:09:40] But after Luther died and went away,
[1:09:42] they
[1:09:44] denominated. Amen. people that were
[1:09:46] there weren't happy. So, they
[1:09:50] denominated and the life went away from
[1:09:53] that into the
[1:09:54] tossel and the stalk dies. There's no
[1:09:58] more life. The life's gone on. Amen.
[1:10:02] So that as they denominate, the life
[1:10:05] moves on. God always does that. You
[1:10:09] reject God and God moves on. Yes. I if
[1:10:12] if if God moves in your path, if God
[1:10:15] comes in your way, if God speaks to you
[1:10:18] and moves on you and you reject him,
[1:10:20] God's not going to stand there and beat
[1:10:22] you over the head with a ball bat. He's
[1:10:24] going to move on. Amen. Amen. He'll move
[1:10:27] on and find somebody who does want. He's
[1:10:29] going to find a better ground to move
[1:10:30] into. Yes. Praise the Lord. And they
[1:10:32] moved as they rejected him by
[1:10:34] denomination, he moved on. He moved into
[1:10:37] the Tossel in Wesley. When they
[1:10:40] denominated and they denominated, God
[1:10:43] moved on into the shove, into the life,
[1:10:45] into the restoration of the gifts. As
[1:10:48] they moved out of that, they kept their
[1:10:52] gifts. They kept the gifts that operate
[1:10:55] by the Holy Spirit. They kept those
[1:10:57] gifts. They started denominated around
[1:10:59] those gifts. Instead of instead of
[1:11:02] organizing around Jesus Christ, they
[1:11:05] denominated around gifts, right? and
[1:11:07] said the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:11:09] Ghost is speaking in tongues. Well,
[1:11:12] that's organizing, denominating around a
[1:11:15] gift, not around Christ, right? We
[1:11:18] organize around Christ. Our lives are
[1:11:21] center or Christ centered, not gift
[1:11:23] centered. As we said the other day, you
[1:11:26] can't major on a minor. And a gift is a
[1:11:29] minor, right? Christ, the word is the
[1:11:31] major. Amen. And as and as they moved
[1:11:35] away from God, the shuck pulled away and
[1:11:38] fell off and the ground is chaff that
[1:11:41] flow blows away with the with the wind.
[1:11:43] And then you got a you got a pure wheat
[1:11:45] grain again. Amen. Produced out of that
[1:11:49] life. That same life. It's God's life.
[1:11:52] It's the same life. Amen.
[1:11:59] Let's see if I can find in the rapture
[1:12:03] message January uh December 465 that
[1:12:06] corn of wheat had to fall into the
[1:12:10] ground just like Jesus had to fall to
[1:12:13] rise again. So did the church of
[1:12:16] Pentecost had to
[1:12:17] fall. It had to go into the ground
[1:12:20] through them dark ages. Any weed, any
[1:12:23] grain that goes into the ground has to
[1:12:27] lay in that dark time to bring forth.
[1:12:30] But it started sprouting again in Martin
[1:12:33] Luther. Come on out through Wesley on
[1:12:37] out into Pentecost, the restoration of
[1:12:39] gifts. Now in to go out to the grain and
[1:12:44] now the denominational systems.
[1:12:49] The systems, not the people. is the
[1:12:52] system. Amen. The system that they left
[1:12:56] behind their stalks that is all is to be
[1:13:01] burned. Once the crane, once the grain
[1:13:04] is harvested into the garner, the stalk,
[1:13:08] the shock, the tossel is all dead, dies.
[1:13:14] It's it's harvested, thrown into the
[1:13:17] burner or rotted left to be rot or or
[1:13:21] burned. Once a field gets harvested,
[1:13:24] they'll a lot of times uh me and my wife
[1:13:27] were flying over a lot of farmland uh in
[1:13:30] in the southeast and there's fires all
[1:13:32] over the place. And I told my wife, I
[1:13:34] said, "Look at these fires. You don't
[1:13:36] hear anything about them, but they're
[1:13:38] probably just control burns because what
[1:13:39] they do once the once the genuine wheat
[1:13:43] once the genuine grain is harvested into
[1:13:45] the garner, they burn the rest of it,
[1:13:48] right? It's all burned over. It purifies
[1:13:51] everything else. He said, "Look, all the
[1:13:55] denomin denominational system that they
[1:13:58] left behind, stalks, that's all is to be
[1:14:01] burnt." The denominational system. Amen.
[1:14:05] And when you look at the church ages,
[1:14:08] you look at denominational system, the
[1:14:11] the light that's in each age represents
[1:14:13] the bride. What is she? She's been
[1:14:16] called out of that denominational
[1:14:17] system. She's not a part of that. Praise
[1:14:20] the Lord. She she believes Christ is her
[1:14:23] head. Not not a district prespter. Uh
[1:14:27] not not a board of any kind, not any
[1:14:30] kind of elected or non-elected board.
[1:14:32] There's no board of governors. There's
[1:14:34] no board of deacons. There's no there's
[1:14:36] no board of trustees. There's no board
[1:14:40] that is to rule over that God's church.
[1:14:42] Amen. Amen. Amen. Jesus Christ rules
[1:14:46] over his church. And he put men of God
[1:14:48] in the church to minister that word by
[1:14:51] the Holy Spirit. Amen. Not to be
[1:14:53] controlled by man. If it's controlled by
[1:14:56] man, God burns it over and moves on.
[1:14:59] Right. Yeah. That's where the life goes.
[1:15:03] But the real grain of wheat that come
[1:15:06] out of each of those
[1:15:08] reformations will be caught up in the
[1:15:11] bride because it all together will make
[1:15:14] up the bride all
[1:15:17] together. Bride from every age, not
[1:15:21] denomination but bride. She's been
[1:15:24] called out of that church. Revelation
[1:15:26] 18. come out of her mighty people and be
[1:15:28] not partaker of her what church her
[1:15:31] sins.
[1:15:33] Praise the Lord. She's been called out
[1:15:35] individually. We die and we rot to rise
[1:15:39] again a new person as a bride whole
[1:15:42] internationally. Die and rot to come
[1:15:44] back again as the bride of as the mature
[1:15:47] bride of Jesus Christ that God has
[1:15:50] called us to be. Amen. And through those
[1:15:52] church ages, she is this bride. She is a
[1:15:57] word seed bride. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:00] She is a word seed bride. The life is
[1:16:03] the seed. Praise the Lord. Amen. The
[1:16:06] word is a seed. She is that life. Now
[1:16:09] look though, we read this last week. I'm
[1:16:11] going to read a couple of these
[1:16:13] scriptures again. Acts chapter
[1:16:17] 20. There was
[1:16:19] warnings. Amen. Brother Brown gave
[1:16:22] warnings as well. I didn't print those
[1:16:24] quotes out, but gave warnings as well.
[1:16:26] But you look in the scripture, there's
[1:16:28] several warnings that went on in the
[1:16:30] scripture to let us know that that these
[1:16:34] things were going to happen. These
[1:16:36] darkness is going to come in. These
[1:16:38] people were going to come in. Amen. And
[1:16:41] try to destroy you to try to pull you
[1:16:44] away from the truth that you have been
[1:16:45] taught. Look, he said now uh Acts 20
[1:16:50] verse 25. And now behold, I know that ye
[1:16:53] all among whom I have gone preaching the
[1:16:56] kingdom of God shall see my face no
[1:16:58] more. Wherefore I take you to record
[1:17:00] this day, that I am pure from the blood
[1:17:04] of all men. For I have not shunn to
[1:17:07] declare unto you all the counsel of God.
[1:17:11] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:14] Take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:17:16] to all the flock over the which the Holy
[1:17:18] Ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[1:17:21] the church of God which he had purchased
[1:17:23] with his own blood. For I know this that
[1:17:27] after my departing shall grievous wolves
[1:17:30] enter in among you not sparing the
[1:17:34] flock. Right? The warning that Paul
[1:17:36] gives, this is all nice, fine, and good,
[1:17:39] but upon my
[1:17:40] departure, grievous wolves will come in
[1:17:43] and they won't they won't spare the
[1:17:45] flock. Yeah. Amen. Satan will come. When
[1:17:48] Satan comes in, he doesn't leave the
[1:17:50] bride alone. Nope.
[1:17:53] In fact, you're his number one target.
[1:17:55] Yes. He doesn't say, "Oh, well, they're
[1:17:57] born again. They're children of God. Uh
[1:17:59] there's nothing I can do with them
[1:18:00] anyway. I just leave them alone." You're
[1:18:03] his first target. Amen. You're the
[1:18:05] bullseye on the target that he's aiming
[1:18:08] for. And that's exactly these grievous
[1:18:11] wolves, inspired, of course, and
[1:18:13] orchestrated by the devil, come in and
[1:18:16] try to destroy what God has created.
[1:18:19] Thank God he can't destroy that true
[1:18:21] bride. But they will come, not sparing
[1:18:24] the flock, to try to divert you away
[1:18:26] from that truth. Also of your own selves
[1:18:29] shall men arise among
[1:18:31] yourselves. God help us. We we never
[1:18:34] want to say that or try to attain or
[1:18:37] admit to it, but that's the truth. Amen.
[1:18:39] In our own ranks, men, people have risen
[1:18:42] up to try to destroy and take you away
[1:18:45] from the truth that you know is right.
[1:18:48] Among yourselves shall men arise
[1:18:50] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:18:54] disciples after them. What is a perverse
[1:18:56] thing? He's not talking about things of
[1:18:58] sexual nature or things that are
[1:18:59] perverse. He's talking about anything
[1:19:01] that's contrary to the revealed word of
[1:19:03] God, right? Amen. Anything contrary to
[1:19:05] the revealed word of God is perverse.
[1:19:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:11] So that they can draw disciples away to
[1:19:14] follow them. Oh, I have a new way. I
[1:19:17] have a new revelation. I have a new uh
[1:19:20] message. I I I have a new prophecy. I
[1:19:23] have a new I think this is going to and
[1:19:24] I think maybe this and it looks like
[1:19:26] this and it looks like that. What do
[1:19:28] they do? They just draw people away.
[1:19:30] Yes. Amen. Just to try to draw people
[1:19:32] away, get them to send them money and
[1:19:34] all. It's just It's just perverse. Amen.
[1:19:37] It's all it is. Praise the Lord. All All
[1:19:41] these prophecies, they might hit one in
[1:19:42] a thousand, might hit one in 10,000.
[1:19:46] But Brother Ram said, if you say
[1:19:48] something in the name of the Lord
[1:19:50] doesn't happen, you come to the altar
[1:19:51] and repent because the devil's on you.
[1:19:53] Yes. You need to get people to pray the
[1:19:55] devil off of you. Amen.
[1:19:57] draw disciples after them. Therefore,
[1:19:59] watch and remember that thy space of
[1:20:01] three years, I cease not. Three years, I
[1:20:04] cease not to warn everyone night and day
[1:20:06] with tears. Now, look what Jude
[1:20:10] said. Jude chapter Well, there's no
[1:20:12] chapters in Jude. Jude verse three and
[1:20:15] four. Amen.
[1:20:19] Look at Jude's warning. Who is the
[1:20:20] brother of
[1:20:21] James? Look at his warning. Beloved,
[1:20:24] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[1:20:26] you of the common salvation, it was
[1:20:28] needful for me. Needful for me, I would
[1:20:30] say necessary. Yes. To write unto you
[1:20:33] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:20:36] contend for the faith. Amen. Amen. Means
[1:20:40] there's going to be contention. Yes.
[1:20:43] Means there's going to be times you're
[1:20:44] going to need to stand on what you
[1:20:46] believe. Amen. Stand for what you know
[1:20:48] is right. Amen. You're going to have to
[1:20:50] contend and hold true to what you know
[1:20:53] is right according to the word. Amen.
[1:20:56] Contend for the faith which was once
[1:20:58] delivered unto the saints. For there's
[1:21:00] for there are certain men crept in
[1:21:05] unawares. Amen. What does that mean?
[1:21:07] That means they've come in and they
[1:21:09] become a part of you. Yes. Amen. They
[1:21:11] they they've become a part of your
[1:21:13] belief and understanding and
[1:21:16] uh the message if you will. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:19] And look like you and talk like you and
[1:21:21] act like you, you know, praise the Lord.
[1:21:25] Come in. They That's how they're
[1:21:27] unawares. You don't recognize it because
[1:21:30] they It looks just like it. Amen. You
[1:21:34] ever You ever heard the expression I
[1:21:36] have you ever heard? You've all heard
[1:21:38] the expression, if it quacks like a duck
[1:21:39] and looks like a duck and waddles like a
[1:21:41] duck and swims like a duck, it's a duck.
[1:21:43] That's not always true. Amen. You know,
[1:21:45] geese look like ducks and swim like
[1:21:48] ducks and smell like ducks and quack
[1:21:50] like ducks, but they're not ducks.
[1:21:52] They're geese. Amen. It's not always a
[1:21:54] duck. Amen. I I understand where there's
[1:21:57] smoke, there's fire. I get all that. And
[1:21:59] I understand most of the time that is
[1:22:01] true, but it's not always true. They can
[1:22:05] come in and look and sound and dress and
[1:22:08] play the part just like any. And that's
[1:22:10] how they be that's how they come in
[1:22:11] unawares. You don't recognize it. That
[1:22:14] sp spirit that's behind that. Amen. They
[1:22:17] come in unawares who were before of old
[1:22:20] ordained. They were ordained to this
[1:22:24] condemnation. Their ordination is to do
[1:22:26] what they do. Amen. You think sometimes
[1:22:29] the people come in and and and bring in
[1:22:32] heresies, bring in hibernation. How
[1:22:35] could these people do? Well, they're
[1:22:36] ordained to that. Amen. Amen. Just like
[1:22:40] we're ordained to do what we do.
[1:22:43] Uh, God's ordained you to do that.
[1:22:46] Praise the Lord. I had I've had people
[1:22:48] come and ask me, "Who ordained you?" I
[1:22:49] said, "God." Amen. Amen. Amen. I had men
[1:22:52] lay hands on me, but God ordained me.
[1:22:55] Amen. Praise the Lord. I wasn't ordained
[1:22:57] at some seminary or by some
[1:22:59] organization, denomination, or group. I
[1:23:01] was ordained by God. Amen. I had men
[1:23:03] pray over me and say, "God, bless this
[1:23:05] gift that's in this man's life."
[1:23:07] Absolutely. But I was ordained by God to
[1:23:10] do what I do. You're ordained to do what
[1:23:12] you do by God. That's a part of your
[1:23:14] adoption. That's a part of knowing who
[1:23:16] you are. That's a part of being a part
[1:23:17] of the family. Yes. Amen. You're
[1:23:20] ordained to that. Praise the Lord. These
[1:23:23] people were ordained to this to be
[1:23:26] ungodly
[1:23:28] people. They were uh ordained to this
[1:23:32] condemnation. ungodly man turning the
[1:23:35] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[1:23:38] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:23:40] Jesus Christ. Making God's grace a
[1:23:43] disgrace. That's right. Amen. Making the
[1:23:46] grace of God a disgrace. Say you can do
[1:23:49] what you want. The grace of God covers
[1:23:51] you. Doesn't work that way. Amen. Uh
[1:23:55] that that's the same old Catholic belief
[1:23:56] of going and saying, "Well, I'm going to
[1:23:58] go get drunk and I'll pray the priest
[1:24:00] afterward to pray the indulgence or
[1:24:03] whatever it is they do. I I I'll just
[1:24:05] pay him enough money and it'll be all
[1:24:07] right. That'll take care of it."
[1:24:10] Amen. Not for that. Yeah. Grace of God
[1:24:13] is when you make a mistake, when you
[1:24:15] slip up, when you do something maybe you
[1:24:16] shouldn't, say something you shouldn't.
[1:24:19] The grace of God is to cover basically
[1:24:22] the whole of our lives. But it it covers
[1:24:24] not because we purposely intend to be a
[1:24:27] evil person. It doesn't work that way.
[1:24:30] You make the God grace. It's like Paul
[1:24:33] like Paul said in the Romans church said
[1:24:36] if it's if if the grace of God abounds,
[1:24:39] why don't we just all go in sin so that
[1:24:41] the grace abounds even
[1:24:43] more? Because we've all just become a
[1:24:46] bunch of sinners. So the grace of God
[1:24:47] really is strong and
[1:24:50] abounding. Paul said, "God forbid."
[1:24:53] Amen. God didn't give you the his grace
[1:24:55] to make a disgrace out of it. That's
[1:24:57] right. But these people make God's grace
[1:25:00] into a disgrace. Lasciviousness. Yeah.
[1:25:04] Amen. Which I don't have to explain to
[1:25:06] you is an extremely evil word. If you go
[1:25:09] look up the word lasciviousness, you'll
[1:25:12] see it's an extremely the the the uh the
[1:25:16] definitions of this is extremely evil,
[1:25:19] wicked, demonic.
[1:25:21] uh is lasciviousness and denying and and
[1:25:24] how can you get more evil than to take
[1:25:26] people off the word.
[1:25:29] Amen. You can go smoke, drink, gamble,
[1:25:31] whatever, run around, but how can you
[1:25:34] get more evil than trying to take people
[1:25:36] off the true word of God? How do you get
[1:25:39] more evil than hybriding God's word? You
[1:25:43] don't. That's as evil as it gets. Amen.
[1:25:46] Whether they're in a message dress or or
[1:25:51] what doesn't matter. Hybriding the word
[1:25:54] is the most evil thing. You can be the
[1:25:56] most pure person in the world, but you
[1:25:58] hybrided the word and changed God.
[1:26:00] That's the most evil thing it can do.
[1:26:04] And that's what people do. The warning
[1:26:06] though. See the
[1:26:08] warning. What about this
[1:26:11] day? I'll close here in a
[1:26:14] minute. these last days that we're
[1:26:17] living.
[1:26:18] Amen. We're living in a very wicked age,
[1:26:22] a very wicked time. Yeah.
[1:26:27] These denominations, think about this
[1:26:29] age. I'm going to finish with this. I
[1:26:32] might read one more scripture and and
[1:26:35] we'll move on. I I won't get to a couple
[1:26:37] of the other things I wanted to say
[1:26:39] today, but Christ and mystery of God
[1:26:41] revealed. I want to bring a couple
[1:26:43] things more together here. and we'll
[1:26:45] close. Now, the big fancy intellectual
[1:26:49] denominations are doing the very same
[1:26:51] thing. Gathering themselves together to
[1:26:53] do the same thing. See, they are
[1:26:54] gathering and a denominating themselves.
[1:26:57] Each one trying to be out the
[1:27:00] other. Sounds like message churches.
[1:27:03] Yeah. Forget denomination. That's what
[1:27:05] message seem like they want to do. Oh
[1:27:08] my. Did I say something I shouldn't?
[1:27:09] Anyway, trying to beat out the other
[1:27:12] one. And now they got so much splendor.
[1:27:15] They don't know what to do to unite with
[1:27:17] the Catholic Church. And they do. They
[1:27:18] are. They will. They continue. They will
[1:27:22] see Lucifer again building a bigger
[1:27:24] kingdom to push out people that don't
[1:27:26] believe in denominations and even take
[1:27:28] their church buildings and make storooms
[1:27:30] out of them. And the pastors of those
[1:27:32] churches have no rights at all.
[1:27:35] And a man that is God-scent man would
[1:27:37] never stay in a denomination after
[1:27:39] hearing seeing something like that. He
[1:27:41] has enough of God to get him out of
[1:27:43] that. Certainly. I don't say that
[1:27:44] critically. I say that truthfully.
[1:27:46] Notice these last days. Lucifer doing
[1:27:48] the same thing. Satan doing the same
[1:27:50] thing. Can you see it? Congre
[1:27:53] congregation says, "Amen. I doubt I
[1:27:55] doubt very many actually saw it." Today
[1:27:58] now 50 years later, yeah. Amen. Becomes
[1:28:02] more more light and more common all the
[1:28:05] time. Praise the Lord. More light. Think
[1:28:07] about that. More light. As that light
[1:28:09] comes on, it changes things. Light
[1:28:11] changes things. You see, even in the
[1:28:13] government when the light start shining
[1:28:15] on things, the roaches start scattering.
[1:28:17] Yes. Amen. You see the roaches are
[1:28:19] scattering now. I had a bunch of them
[1:28:21] out here in front of this Tesla place
[1:28:22] yesterday, too. I call the people
[1:28:25] roaches, but you know, it's just that
[1:28:26] spirit, that system. See, got those
[1:28:29] people bound. Amen. But you notice how
[1:28:31] they'll scatter. See, when the light
[1:28:33] comes on and because they're Jesus said
[1:28:37] their deed, their deeds are evil, right?
[1:28:40] So when light shone on, they don't like
[1:28:41] the light because it brings their deeds
[1:28:43] into light and they don't want their
[1:28:45] deeds to be in light because they're
[1:28:47] evil. Right? So anyway, seeing this now,
[1:28:51] they said, "Can you see?" Amen. The
[1:28:53] devil doing the same thing. Building up
[1:28:55] a hybrid church, a hybrid by hybrid
[1:28:57] members, hybrid by knowledge instead of
[1:29:01] the word, by intellectual men instead of
[1:29:04] bornagain men building an intellectual
[1:29:07] kingdom that will outshine Christ,
[1:29:10] Christ's little bitty flock. And you see
[1:29:12] today even in this message Satan
[1:29:16] substituting churches, people
[1:29:18] substituting the word of God for some
[1:29:21] intellectualism or
[1:29:23] sensationalism. Amen. They want to want
[1:29:26] to have a chill up and down the spine or
[1:29:28] have some kind of intellectualism.
[1:29:30] Friend, if it's an intellectual church
[1:29:32] you're looking for, I'm your wrong I'm
[1:29:34] the wrong pastor. Amen. Amen. Because I
[1:29:37] uh I'm thankful God showed me how to
[1:29:40] read. uh and comprehend a little bit.
[1:29:44] But intellectual, I've been around some
[1:29:46] of these brothers before and they'll
[1:29:48] talk and talk and talk and 30 minutes
[1:29:50] later I I I feel I'm dumber than I was
[1:29:54] before they started
[1:29:56] talking. I don't know what they said. I
[1:29:59] have no idea what scripture reference
[1:30:00] they're using, what message. I don't
[1:30:02] know what they were trying to get to. I
[1:30:04] don't know what the point of the whole
[1:30:05] thing was. But I've been in churches
[1:30:07] like this. Yes. Amen. intellectualism
[1:30:10] trying to
[1:30:11] exchange substitute the word for
[1:30:14] emotionalism or intellectualism. Oh,
[1:30:16] that's the exact same thing brother Bram
[1:30:18] said that the denominations would do.
[1:30:20] What does that tell you? Tells you the
[1:30:22] denomination spirit is among us,
[1:30:24] friends. Yes, it is. God help us all.
[1:30:28] Amen. Hybrid church, intellectual
[1:30:31] kingdoms, outshining Christ's little
[1:30:33] bitty flock. Little bitty flock. Look
[1:30:36] out. How many here? Amen. We got a small
[1:30:39] flock, but by the grace of God, mighty
[1:30:41] and power of the Holy Spirit, the the
[1:30:43] Bible said it was fallen angels who
[1:30:45] listened to Lucifer instead of Christ
[1:30:47] who they once belonged to. Is that
[1:30:49] right? Amen. Now listen close. Fallen
[1:30:52] angels. What kind of angels? Luther,
[1:30:55] Wesley, Catholic, Pentecostals who kept
[1:30:57] not their first estate like the angels
[1:31:00] did and has fell into organizations like
[1:31:03] Lucifer's main hold at Na. What was it?
[1:31:08] Stalk,
[1:31:09] Tossel, Chuck, they all carried the life
[1:31:13] right out into the If it weren't for a
[1:31:16] Luther and a Wesley and a Pentecost,
[1:31:20] there wouldn't have come a time where we
[1:31:22] now have the bride age. There would not
[1:31:24] have come that time. The life had to
[1:31:26] come through as that seed fell on the
[1:31:28] ground and died in rot. That life had to
[1:31:30] come back through the stalk and through
[1:31:32] the tossel and through the shuck into
[1:31:34] the life of the wheat. It was a carrier.
[1:31:37] But when that's done, the sh the the the
[1:31:40] stalk denominates dies. The tossel
[1:31:43] denominates dies. Shove denominates
[1:31:46] dies. And it's all burned away. Yes. Now
[1:31:49] what's left?
[1:31:52] Amen. What kind of angels? Luther,
[1:31:57] Wesley, Catholic denomination. Amen.
[1:32:00] Pentecostal. Those kind of angels. Not
[1:32:03] Luther. Not Martin Luther, not John
[1:32:07] Lesley personally, but that the
[1:32:09] denominated that after he left. Yes.
[1:32:12] Which Paul said would happen, which Jude
[1:32:15] said would happen, which brother Brandon
[1:32:17] said would happen after his departure.
[1:32:19] And what has happened? The exact same
[1:32:22] thing. Exactly what he said would do has
[1:32:25] happened.
[1:32:27] Amen.
[1:32:29] sold out reasonings of education and
[1:32:32] wisdom instead of the word of God. Amen.
[1:32:36] Now, Matthew chapter 24, let me read
[1:32:39] this. I skip over some of
[1:32:42] that. Matthew chapter 24, they come and
[1:32:45] ask
[1:32:46] Jesus. They ask Jesus, "How will we know
[1:32:51] when it's the tie? What is the end
[1:32:53] time?" Amen. How can we know when all
[1:32:55] these things are going to happen? Yes.
[1:32:57] And Jesus tells them this and that. See
[1:32:59] all these things he talks about. And we
[1:33:01] go to the fourth verse. Jesus answered
[1:33:04] and said, "Take heed." Look at what
[1:33:06] Jesus the first thing that Jesus says
[1:33:08] after they ask him that. Amen. After
[1:33:11] after their question about the end time
[1:33:13] and when time going to come and all, the
[1:33:15] first thing Jesus said, verse four,
[1:33:17] Jesus answered and said unto them, "Take
[1:33:20] heed that no man deceive you."
[1:33:24] Amen. So, we've got the warning from
[1:33:25] Paul. We got the warning from Jesus. Got
[1:33:28] the warning from Jude that we see all in
[1:33:30] scripture. We got the We got the warning
[1:33:33] that Brother Brandham gave us. Yes.
[1:33:34] Amen. All the same warning. Right. Jesus
[1:33:37] right here. Take heed that no man
[1:33:40] deceive you. That's the first thing.
[1:33:43] Praise the Lord. But now, when you get
[1:33:45] to the end of this, now look through
[1:33:47] those ages. We'll probably reiterate
[1:33:49] this maybe again next week, but when you
[1:33:52] get to this last age, look at through
[1:33:54] all the ages now. Amen. You had you you
[1:33:57] had those anointings, which we'll we'll
[1:33:59] probably again read maybe next week. You
[1:34:01] had all the anointings, the the uh the
[1:34:05] lion, and and the calf, the ox, and the
[1:34:08] man, and the eagle, and the anointing of
[1:34:10] each of these ages, which you know,
[1:34:12] after this age is gone, after his
[1:34:14] bride's gone, there'll be no more
[1:34:15] anointing. That's right. Right. That
[1:34:18] anointing will be gone. Yes. But they
[1:34:20] each had that anointing. But you notice
[1:34:22] through the the horse age and the horse
[1:34:25] and buggy age and went into the car and
[1:34:28] look look what Jesus said at the end of
[1:34:30] his exclamation here, his his
[1:34:32] proclamation. Revelation 24 or excuse
[1:34:35] me, Matthew 24:14.
[1:34:37] Amen. He says, "And this gospel of the
[1:34:40] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[1:34:43] world for a witness unto all
[1:34:47] nations. Then shall the end come." Yes.
[1:34:52] Now, how could that have ever happened
[1:34:54] until this age? That's right. Amen. Not
[1:34:56] even the automobile age could that have
[1:34:58] happened. Right. But now we got
[1:35:00] airplanes that can take you from one
[1:35:02] continent to another in a matter of 10,
[1:35:05] 12 hours or less sometimes.
[1:35:08] can take you across the country. Yes. In
[1:35:11] in in just a few hours. Meanwhile, I
[1:35:14] flew here to Atlanta, three hours. Here,
[1:35:17] you know how long it take us to drive
[1:35:19] it? 25, 30 to drive it. Three hours.
[1:35:24] Now, in this last day, where the light
[1:35:26] has come in and shone upon this age,
[1:35:29] shone upon this time. This is the time
[1:35:31] now that we live where this can be
[1:35:33] fulfilled. Yes. When this word can be
[1:35:37] preached, this gospel of the kingdom,
[1:35:39] not a man's gospel, but the gospel of
[1:35:42] the kingdom to be preached in all the
[1:35:44] world to all nations because everybody
[1:35:47] is going to hear it. Yes. Everybody has
[1:35:50] to be uh
[1:35:52] uh able to receive it. Amen. God doesn't
[1:35:57] judge anybody unless he's given them a
[1:36:00] chance. And this gospel would be
[1:36:02] preached in all worlds to all nations
[1:36:04] before the end comes. He said well he
[1:36:08] said then the end will be then the end
[1:36:10] will come. Could not have happened till
[1:36:13] this time that we're living now. Amen.
[1:36:15] Or humans people the gospel not only
[1:36:19] airplanes and live gospel but you can
[1:36:23] pick up probably not that phone but you
[1:36:26] can pick up this phone and talk to
[1:36:28] anybody around the world. You can pick
[1:36:30] up this phone and social media anybody
[1:36:33] around the world. You can pick up this
[1:36:35] phone and FaceTime anybody that has like
[1:36:39] phone around the world.
[1:36:42] I know people that preach that that
[1:36:45] minister to uh groups in different parts
[1:36:48] of the
[1:36:48] country. 30hour flight
[1:36:51] away this or or or this
[1:36:58] just a way to get around the world. How
[1:37:00] could we have gotten around the world
[1:37:02] quicker than we can now?
[1:37:04] Amen. But that's what Jesus said will
[1:37:06] happen before the end comes. How close
[1:37:08] then are we, saints? Amen. How close
[1:37:11] then are we? If all these things that we
[1:37:13] see have come to pass, what kind of
[1:37:16] people ought we to be? Yes. Amen. What
[1:37:19] age are we living in? Amen. Praise the
[1:37:22] Lord. God help us. Let's stand if we
[1:37:25] could. I'll close right
[1:37:31] there. This gospel be preached to all
[1:37:34] the kingdom and all the world. Amen. And
[1:37:36] every nation, to all people. Then shall
[1:37:40] the end come. Yes. Praise the Lord. What
[1:37:44] what kind of again? What kind of people
[1:37:47] should we be? Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:37:50] Jesus. Amen. That's so true. Let's sing
[1:37:54] this course. Uh Mike can probably find
[1:37:58] it on the computer there. We can have it
[1:37:59] on the
[1:38:00] screen. Let's sing this course. Uh I
[1:38:03] want to live the way he wants me to
[1:38:06] live. I guess that's the name of it. I
[1:38:09] want to live the way he wants me to
[1:38:11] live. I'm going to live the way he wants
[1:38:14] me to live for this last day that we
[1:38:17] live.
[1:38:19] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. It's my
[1:38:23] desire, saints. All of our desires live
[1:38:25] the way he wants us to live. Be what he
[1:38:28] wants us to be. Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:38:32] Jesus. Let's sing it to him
[1:38:35] now. I want to
[1:38:38] live the
[1:38:39] way he wants me to live. I want to
[1:38:47] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:38:54] I want to
[1:38:57] love love till there's just no more
[1:39:02] love.
[1:39:04] I could

[1:39:09] Lord. Oh yes Lord, I want to
[1:39:14] live the way he wants me to live. I want
[1:39:22] to
[1:39:24] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:39:31] I want to
[1:39:33] love love till there's just no more
[1:39:39] love. Oh, I could
[1:39:41] never ever out love my Lord. All is
[1:39:46] singing this way to him now. I'm going
[1:39:49] to
[1:39:51] live the
[1:39:52] way Jesus wants me to live. I'm going to
[1:40:00] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:40:07] I'm going to
[1:40:09] love love till there's just no more
[1:40:15] love. Oh, I could never ever out love my
[1:40:23] Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you,
[1:40:26] Jesus. Is that our desire today? Yes.
[1:40:29] Praise the Lord. To live the way he
[1:40:31] wants us to live, to be what he wants us
[1:40:34] to be. Yes. Amen. To live by his word,
[1:40:36] to stand on his word, to be that soldier
[1:40:40] of the cross that God has given us, to
[1:40:42] continue to contend for that faith,
[1:40:46] contend for that word delivered to us.
