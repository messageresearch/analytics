The Word Of God Tabernacle - Sunday Morning Service - Cleansing: Part 1 - 3/14/2021

Please excuse the quality of some parts of this stream, due to our location we were running off of cellular hotspot which caused portions of the stream to be choppy. Additionally, the microphone normally used for audio capture decided not to work, so we had to use the default computer microphone causing a decrease in audio quality.

or not um and it turned out even though i had the green light for several seconds the car just came straight through the light as if there wasn't even another one thank god for that little interaction

holy spirit [Music] a mercy [Music] amen welcome to the house of the lord i appreciate each one of you coming being here those who may be streaming today god richly bless you thank you for coming on a fairly cold tucson morning amen but god blessed us with a good beautiful sunlight and a beautiful day he meant it was nice to wake up yesterday to see the snow on the mountains and it's just amazing the extremes that you get in arizona tucson anyway southern arizona uh last week we got we had the air conditioner on a couple nights because we like to sleep with it cool and and now we gotta have the heat on it's we didn't turn it on but um uh it's just a roller coaster here in tucson but um but anyway appreciate you coming here and being here in this conference room this morning pray the lord richly bless you today a little bit cramped we have a little smaller area today but um we got here a little early and micah was here and uh the lady said it'd be ready in a few minutes and so we came in and we're standing out in the lobby area and she's in here putting the chairs up and didn't know it but she was putting them all up like this and you know we come in we we didn't get in here until 10 after 10 quarter after 10 something like that so we didn't have a whole lot of time so so we'll just leave it like it is but right now i i'm thankful to have church and thankful to have a place to meet and i appreciate god's blessings to us but i definitely like the cheers turned around the other way better uh it seems to have a little more room and i'm not staring at myself so i would get danny and dennis to take that mirror down but uh we better just leave it and break it then we'll have to pay for it so we'll just have to endure i'll look at you all instead of instead about there so uh that's uh i i i have to say in 33 years in august i've been ministering i've never preached to myself like that in a year before but there's always a first i guess amen but uh thankful to be here today god bless you let's stand to our feet if we could we're going to turn our bibles to numbers chapter 12. numbers chapter 12. i'll give you an update at the end of the service today short update i try not to be too long we'll probably have to divide this service this message into a couple of messages uh because i like to take you know 10-15 minutes at the end of service to try to uh poor sing and work a little and then update you a little about progress or lack thereof i should say of the other place at this point so um but anyway so we'll do that at the end of the service today so numbers chapter 12. before we read the word let's just bow our heads again for another word of prayer precious father god lord jesus it's certainly a privilege to be here and thank you so much for all that you've done for us and blessed us through this week glad there's many prayer requests that went up lord and but god has many prayer requests lord we heard testimonies of how you've moved upon our lives and how you've blessed us and healed us and strengthened us and lord we thank you so much lord for all that you do for us every day and for coming here and this giving us this place supplying this for us lord that we can come in and lord out from the world and with those of light precious faith and worship and glorify magnify your holy name for you to speak to us from your word lord that we might draw closer to you more like you in this last day lord it's a place that we're accustomed to but lord we don't know but this might be the last time we ever meet like this god we just don't want to take it for granted lord but we want to make it the best opportunity that we have lord to just expect from you all that you have for us today and lord may you just uh open your word lord to us and open our hearts to receive it lord may our hearts and minds lord god be in the place to receive the revelation of the word that you'd have to encourage us with today father lord forgive all of our sins and iniquities move upon your bride internationally lord wherever they be god we know them and we may not know them lord but god we're all part of the same mystical body of jesus christ we thank you for keeping us safe and healthy lord may you watch over and bless us as we rebuke every demonic spirit lord this place today that may try to hurt hinder and this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we give you thanks honor and glory and committed to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen numbers chapter 12 we'll just read a couple verses of scripture and let you be seated uh starting with verse 13 numbers 12-13 and moses cried unto the lord saying hear her now oh god i beseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father would spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again miriam was shut out from the camp seven days in the people's journey uh journeyed not until miriam was brought in again and you can be seated if you'd like as i said this this just because i probably could put this into a service under regular circumstances but under the circumstance certain current circumstances in about 40 45 minutes uh we'll probably just try to cut this in uh in two pieces and just do the best we can with today and see where the lord leads it for next week so uh but i want to go back to the first verse in numbers chapter 12 and read this story through and uh get an unusual thought from this uh i tell you what let's let's read another scripture first i was gonna read this afterwards but let's go ahead over to turn and turn over to first john first john chapter one i wanna read it for a few verses of scripture in first john chapter one you could hold your place there in numbers twelve because we're gonna go back to that but let's look at first john uh chapter one let's begin um let's begin reading with verse five first john chapter one all of john is wonderful you've never read the read the epistles of john the first second third epistles they're just they're they're just wonderful uh they're they're packed full of love too amen this is john's the one that informs us that god is love amen amen um he informs us that there's no darkness in him he is light which we're going to read here just a second first john chapter one now not saint john first john chapter one verse five this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us now that proclamation of course many of you probably know if you were under brother green's ministry very long he called that uh 911 first john 1 9 uh backwards 9-1-1 if you need emergency call 9-1-1 i like that so much when brother green was ministering that he went through that quite a bit that i felt compelled to put it in my book so actually that that little excerpt there is in my book first john 1 9 or backwards 9-1-1 if you need rescue he said if you confess your sins he is just and faithful to forgive you of your sin and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness now if we go back to miriam and we look at the story of miriam and uh or this part of the story in in chapter 12 miriam spoke against god's prophet her brother moses and when she spoke against him god struck her with leprosy we'll read through the story here uh god struck her with leprosy now leprosy we know in the bible represents sin sin is judged as leprosy as someone that's uh that that is a figurative of of what leprosy is it speaks of sin uh and and in it being sin it helps us understand that of course leprosy at the time was incurable by human means just like sin is incurable by human means leprosy a type of sin was incurable by human means so there was no way that a person could eradicate themselves or annihilate the uh leprosy once they got it they had to go through the whole process of course we talked about last week the garment and the garment of leprosy uh if you read through leviticus i believe it's 12 13 14 or 13 14 15 it goes through the whole scenario of leprosy and what to do when you have it or when it's found and and those things that take place and how a person can be cleansed of that well when when when miriam uh uh spoke against moses spoke against god's prophet regardless of what moses did uh you can go and look at abraham and abraham was god's prophet and god's prophet lied to a king and this king did something based on misinformation based on a lie well the lie was given to him by god's prophet and what abimelech did was based on the lie that abraham had told him which unfortunately a lot of times a lot of people too things based on misinformation based on a lie and abraham lied to abimelech so if bimbalek took sarah to be his wife and god came to abimelech in a dream and said you better restore that man's wife back to him or you and your whole household is dead right and the member like said didn't did not honor in the integrity of my heart i i i took share to myself he said that she was his sister she said that he told me that that was her sister she said she was his sister i did this and god said i know you did an integrity of heart but you better restore that man because he's my prophet and you better have him pray for you amen you mean the man that just lied to me the man that got me in this whole mess i gotta go have pray for me yes sir he's my prophet amen and and god wasn't regarding the the what we would call a little white lie because she was his half sister but this little white lie that's not white black blue green yellow purple it's alive it's a lie it's a lie that's the bottom line of that he lied to him but god says you go have him pray for you because if you don't you're in you and your kingdom is done so when god's prophet god the man that god sets up in this situation just like uh just like moses was as soon as emiriam uh spoke against him uh for for marrying the ethiopian woman god struck her with leprosy because that was god's problem it didn't matter if miriam was moses sister god struck her with leprosy that sign of sin god signifying to miriam what you just did was wrong in my eyes and that's what sin is now you can look and say sin is unbelief of course unbelief yes well if she if she believed it she wouldn't have spoke against it he said but i don't understand that was a lot of things i don't understand a lot of there's a lot of things happen that none of us understand but we have to trust and believe that if it's in god's plan or god's working it out then we just we take care of uh of what puts god puts in front of us but let's look at this for a moment uh in numbers chapter 12 verse 1 miriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman and they said had the lord indeed spoken only by moses has he not also spoken also by us and the lord heard it of course the lord hears everything now the man moses was very meek above all those that were upon the face the earth meek lowly humble contrite moses is a very humble man probably the speech impediment he had may have made him that way a lot of times a person that's not very boisterous or very loud or talks a lot is someone who tends to be meek now just because someone's quiet doesn't mean they're humble but a lot of times a person who ends up not verbalizing things like they normally would or being out front or something tend to be a little more on the meek side a little more tender a little more uh because they've been through it see they've been through all of the the the the embarrassment or the shame or whatever that person feels of that impediment in their life and moses had that impediment so he naturally was a meek man he was a humble man he was contrite uh you look at uh the prophet today brother branham you know shortened stature living the way he lived and and uh or grew up and all and you know he just wanted to live out in the woods he didn't want to be around anybody see because just the kind of a nature that he was see and and moses was that of that nature he was meek he was a very neat person so for for moses and or for miriam and aaron to have said something and miriam did have said hey does god only speak by moses he speak through us too moses wasn't someone to to come forth and lash back out or he he was one that would just that would probably just stand there and become humble about it and meek about it but you know that that's just the person's characteristic but god heard it see and when god heard it god responded amen fourth verse and the lord spake suddenly now look who he spoke to he despiced miriam naam's one that just made the descript the indiscretion but he didn't talk to her he talked to moses he talked to his mouthpiece he talked to his prophet and he talked to moses he and i'm aaron and uncle miriam came out there three unto the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out god spoke to moses said now all three of you come out here i gotta talk to you i got something to say about this situation and the lord came down the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and mirren and they both came forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not it is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the simplitude of the lord shall be behold shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses the end of the lord was and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from all the tabernacles and behold miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous that sin something that displeased god an uh a period an action of unbelief a departure from the from the faith and and the truth that they lived in this whole time since god put uh put it on moses and sent him back to egypt and framed it from egypt god had put that on moses from that time forward now that unbelief that sin had come in and she spoke of it and god struck her with leprosy god judged that sin right there now today uh those exact same things happen although today we see it more in a spiritual form than a natural form a person is struck with leprosy spiritually today rather than physically people do things and spake against things and and and and sin unbelief but you don't recognize it you don't feel the immediate effects of it right because it's more in a spiritual realm today than it is a physical realm then it was physical you saw it notice the immediate response the immediate uh uh reprecussions of her actions right then and there she was struck with luck so you could see it on earth white as snow the bible says she was struck just like that and when she was they saw that that was something that was displeasing to the lord god said how could you do this why would you do this this is my prophet this is my mouthpiece you don't speak against him this is a man that i hold in high esteem and how dare you feel like you could say something against him when you say something against him you're saying it against me right now it didn't say that right there but that's the truth of the matter right when you said something against him against moses you said it against him because see it's the same thing today when someone says something or speaks against another or speaks against you they're not putting you down they're putting god down right when they're putting you out they're not putting you out they're putting god out and when they put him out then you see the repercussion now you don't see their flesh turn white you might not see the immediate effects of it friend but a person's life will will continue to erode from that point until they make that right now thankfully because of the blood of jesus christ there's a place you can go to and become cleansed from that unrighteousness now you should go to that person and make it right as well right if another individual is involved in your indiscretion you should go to that person and ask them for forgiveness you should be contrite and repent not just to the lord but to one another right and god will forgive absolutely wipe that and it will be the sin will be white as snow amen amen praise the lord now it says in aaron 11th verse aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb moses cried unto the lord saying hear her now oh god i beseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received yet again marion was shut out of the camp she had to be excluded from the camp she had to be completely outside the camp she could not have interaction she could not be with anybody she could not speak with any of them none of the believers she was to have anything to do with for seven days she had to be shut completely out ostracized for seven days and after that seven days see now after that seven days she was cleansed and they didn't do anything they didn't move anywhere they didn't uh uh they they didn't travel or do anything different and they just kept camped right there for seven days and when the seven days was up she was brought in again and when she was brought in after one of the people removed from hezron and pitched in the wilderness apparent because they were able to move because the sin had been judged the sin had been cleansed but who did god listen to to bring that sin under subjection to the forgiveness of god he listened to his prophet moses when god cried out when moses cried out to god he said god forgive her hold not this sin against her god heard moses and god said well seven days now remember the the number seven in the bible is completion right so she was to reach that complete stage of my forgiveness of my acceptance of the repentant nature and once that's been received is seven days it's got up she's still going to be now could god have clenched her right then and there sure but that would have been complementary to the scripture it wouldn't have been complementary to the word running in continuity all the way through god had to do it the way that it was supposed to be done as he had showed to them all through the bible as he was typing shadow even in today where we see that that seven is completion it had to run that seven days before it could be completed before it could be a cleansed now we know today that if we go back and see in in first john chapter one that that that the bible says if if we confess our sin he is just and faithful to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness right to cleanse us from all unrighteousness now we know that there's a three-step process that god gives us a three-step process to salvation justification sanctification and receive the holy ghost amen that's the three-step process to salvation that's perfection to reach the place of perfection you must go through those three steps now sometimes those three steps happen simultaneously sometimes they happen over a period of time sometimes they happen maybe over a large period of time it just depends it just depends on the individual see that's the misconception that a lot of denominations and churches have today they think that as soon as you say something you're a justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost right then and there all you have to do is admit it all you had to do is speak it all you had to do is say it i know the bible says if you confess with your mouth i know that what the bible says but god many times run that process through a period of time it doesn't always happen just as i know when i was in the baptist church you know as soon as you wanted to get baptized of course they never even talked about justification or sanctification or any of that and they certainly never talked about being having the holy ghost uh the being filled with the holy spirit is being born again he talked about being born again but they're being born again meant you were baptized baptized not being born again right that's just a cleansing process show to the world and your confession you show the rest of the world you accepted jesus christ as your savior well that's well and good because there's millions of people around the world that's done that but how many people has god come and showed to you that he has accepted you my acceptance of him is one thing his acceptance of me is another and that's when he fills me with his spirit when he fills you with his spirit is showing to you and proving to the rest of the world that jesus has accepted you oh there's millions and millions come down to the altar of billy graham's uh crusades and that's wonderful fine and dandy i've been one of them i went down one time with a friend of mine at the at the stadium in charlotte north carolina we went to a billy graham and he wanted to go down i said i'll go with you i walked down there with him it was throngs of people all around down there you know some of them were just talking some of them were on their uh with their friends or whatever i was gonna say on their phone but they wouldn't phones in so it wasn't during that area time but you know distracted is kind of the point i'm trying to make some of them distracted and some are making fun and some of them laughing some very serious some of their hands up some singing some praying you know and my friend was very sincere and but but all that was was just get to the place that you say uh lord even it was sincere enough since here lord i i receive you as my savior forgive me in my sin that's well and good that's perfect but a house that's garnished and cleaned and doesn't get filled with the spirit of god that same devil will come back in with seven more worse than him right yes there's got to be that next step it's all nice that there's millions and millions of those but what happens when uh uh when the spirit of god doesn't come in and feel that empty space feel that heart feel that soul when god doesn't come in there then then you're just open for the devil and all the devil brings all the enemies that come in with it but see if you if you confess with your mouth if you are cleansed of your unrighteousness when god has cleansed you you have been made clean when you've been made clean that means that that that all the sin all the wrongdoing all the unrighteousness is no longer accounted to you it no longer is held to your charge it it's no longer a part of the account that god keeps record in heaven it's wiped clean but now what does it do for the rest of the time for the rest of your life yeah all the the past sins are are done away with and god cleanses that and and and makes you clean that you can walk it cleanse us from all unrighteousness praise the lord unrighteousness well what is unrighteousness that's the absolute opposite of righteousness well what is righteousness god well what's the opposite of god the devil so if you want to understand what unrighteousness is you've got the devil the devil is unrighteous and all his deeds all of that is unrighteous anything that's not righteous is unrighteous anything is not of god is sin and sin is as leprosy and that sin has to be judged and when that sin is judged it's judged at the altar of the uh of of the believer of of jesus christ at the cross uh the shedding of his blood annihilates that sin has to be judged right there god at calvary judged it and if you ask and you you ask god to forgive then he is just and faithful we forg we if we confess our sins he is faithful and just forgive our sins cleanse us amen and when you're cleansed you're cleansed god cleans you let's go to ezekiel for a few moments ezekiel chapter 36. and keep that seventh day on your heart i don't know that i'll be able to get to that part today um i thought for a moment i might be able to but once i get into that it just takes a little bit of time that i want to spend on that to go through it that seven days that seven-day process that miriam went through and understanding the significance all through the scripture that that means the reason god did that see there's nothing frivolous god doesn't do anything frivolous right he doesn't do anything just because he said i think today you know i woke up in a bad mood so you got to wait seven days and see god doesn't do that we we wake up with a in a bad mood or we're grumpy till i get our coffee or eat something or whatever but not god god doesn't wake up the next day and say oh i had a wonderful night's sleep so you only have to wait one day i'll do it for you instantaneously no he's got to do it the exact same way all the way through or he's not god see god doesn't have those ups and downs he doesn't have the goods and bads it's all good to him so once he's done it he's got to do it that way all the way through but the understanding of why god does it that way why would god do that see to help us understand and it's and it runs through the numerology of the scripture just like three there's three steps to that perfection justification sanctification the holy ghost and that completion the seven uh the the seven stages of that completion that cleansing amen that cleansing which is actually the title of the message uh is is cleansing of that cleansing to be cleaned that's wonderful to be clean think about that friend you know we don't we live in a in a country where water and shower and soap and things are so readily available but you know if you go to third world countries you go places that just they don't have that kind of thing they they may not have running water they may not have a shower or soap or something that shampoo you can actually clean yourself it's hard to understand what it's like when you've been your entire life clean to understand how dirty you were how dirty you are or would be if you were in that situation but to think about somebody or somebody's people uh that that are around the world that are filthy they're absolutely disgustingly filthy dirty now i'm talking spiritually not physically now dirty yeah because they have not been cleansed their sins have not been washed away the the the things that they keep piling up see we cleanse ourselves daily at least right you go to the lord and ask god to forgive you daily at least daily if not more often than daily lord forgive me my sin forgive me and my wrong doing forgive me of this certain thing i did or this or the thing i said whatever you ask god forgiveness god cleanses you god cleans you so you live in that perpetual state of of cleanness uh i get a little ahead of myself on that one but that's okay we can try to get back to that next week lord willing but we live in a perpetual state of cleanness just like living in the united states living in a place where we have readily available running water showers and soap and we're blessed friend and there's millions of people around the world that don't have that one simple luxury one simple luxury of being able to live in a perpetual state of cleanness to be clean always clean now you might get dirty or go do a job or play outside or jump in mud puddles or something if your kids are you know you might get dirty or sweaty or something but then you go and say well i got to take a shower you know as people come home after a hard day's work after walking through the dung of animals and and and living with them and handling them and not have that luxury they go home and they sit at their dinner table stinky and filthy yeah because they don't have that luxury they might not even have a dinner table i just said dinner table they might not even have that they might be sitting at their little plate of rice or whatever it is and they stay filthy they usually stay dirty but we don't have that but see when you live in that situation when you live in that condition you don't know another way we're blessed because we have it see but see people who live in that a lot of times they don't recognize or realize that they're living in a in a state of physical cleanliness that we would consider filthy smelly dirty some of us would take a bottle of perfume and pour over their heads or or or something just to try to alleviate some of the odor just the slightest doesn't in this country i know i've said in places next to people who haven't showered or don't shower or use deodorant or something and it's quite pungent and unpleasant uh and i want to get away from that person normally as quickly as i can but there's people who live like that all the time every day and they don't know any better necessarily right they don't know because they don't have and it becomes common to them if it comes to a place that they they they just don't even think anything about it it's not something that that comes on their minds readily it's not something that they that they entertain or think about because they're always dirty they're always filthy and there's no other option if they have no option then they have to stay dirty i hope you understand your spiritual thinking camps today what i'm talking about i'm talking about physical filthiness but there's millions billions of people living on this planet today spiritually in the same condition they might take a shower six times a day they might go through a stick of deodorant every day they might pour on a bottle of perfume every day but inside the inside they're spiritually filthy and they get so used to living in the filth that they don't realize there's a way of there's a way out they don't recognize because they get so used to the dirtiness they get so used to the filth and you notice it's just that way in the world you notice if you think back 100 years ago you think about 200 years ago and you think about the progression just think about this country of course very few of us have gone out of this country maybe new mexico or something or canada but very few of us have actually gone out of this country to a third world country or something of that sort maybe nobody i don't know has anybody gone to a third world country out of this i never have no i've gone to mexico and canada at the extent of my international travel so i haven't none of us have so but when you think of it but i know a lot of missionaries and i have friends and know people who live in places like that and and how they are but let's just think in america in the united states if you think about the united states and how cunningly the devil since he got control of this eve since he got control of this planet this herb he's progressively now look back at when the fall first took place when the fall first took place there wasn't a great huge change you didn't go from adam and eve in the garden of eden to what we have today just like that it didn't happen that way right but progressively over a little bit of time look at the church ages go back and read revelation of 2 3 and look at the church ages and see how progressively the devil has brought that sin in how progressively and cunningly and just a minuscule at a time just a little bit just to change somebody over this way or to change this over that way or just to to make this just a little dirtier to make this a little uh more ungodly to make this a little a little filthier do you got what you got today and you see what's going on in the world today think about what brother brown endured and what he lived through and preached about now here 50 60 70 years later and what have we got now what do you think he would say about it now but these people become so numb that if that living in the filthiness becomes so common to them they just don't recognize it and they don't realize that they even need to be cleansed right they don't know that they're living in a perpetual state of filthiness they don't know that they go get drunk every night or live with different men or women or or or think they're a man and a woman at the same time or or whatever disgusting thing they do today which is pretty bad yes but they don't know they don't recognize they need to be cleansed they don't realize there's a fountain flowing that'll just sweep through their lives and clean them and cleanse them from all of the filthiness i can't even imagine i feel sorry for you i you know i i am a proponent of kids going back to school i think a lot of kids should be have in class face-to-face learning with their teachers but i was almost glad you girls moses you'd have to go to school uh i can't imagine what it's like today i think about what it was like when me and my wife were in high school at the cdo and how bad it was then but we thought something horrible in our school was because they had a little designated smoking area we thought that was bad now what have they got today oh the field but what is it they enter into that i saw some little kid at the playground yesterday couldn't have been anymore any older than joel maybe a little bit older seven eight nine had earrings piercings in his ears already and i'm thinking and i look over his mother and she's tattooed from head to toe i thought well no one the poor kid didn't have a chance right that poor kid didn't have a shot look at the way he was born the home he was born into and just a little bit at a time they don't recognize how disgustingly filthy they are they don't recognize they need to be cleansed and unless they recognize that they need to be cleansed they're never going to seek for a place to find the cleanse the cleansing they're never going to try to get a hold of what they need to get to be cleansed because they don't recognize how filthy they are how dirty how disgusting they are but friend that's that's the part of the duty that god has given us not that we go up to to these people and say you know you're a devil and you need to have god in your life but you know when you have influence over somebody or if god influences you to speak to somebody which is usually what i do if i feel led of the lord to do something then i'll say something uh i do it to my barber almost every time we go get our hair cut i mentioned something to him about the lord he's staunch catholic but you know i mentioned something to him about the lord to the scripture to try to bring him back to that and try to help him understand look at where it's gotten now they're they're they're on the verge uh he's already endorsed homosexuality but they're right on the verge of endorsing abortion even and and women ministers and and i know him as a conservative somewhat man he is absolutely against it and the church their church been against it for years but what has this country done amen it's just like the government they they they do something and uh i i guess your stimulus is coming at you micah i think mike said he's got his but you know it's coming at you but who knows what else is stuck in that two trillion dollars that there's spending of things that you know you understand what i'm saying that filthiness that gets thrown in there and most people don't even know it most people don't see it and unfortunately most people don't care yeah as long as my my four no more is okay you send me my piggly little crumbs and i'll put it in the bacon i'll be good that they don't care yeah and that's where it's at that's that's the perpetual existence people have today of filthiness in their lives and they're so filthy they don't they they can be absolutely worse than a pig enough and a wallop but not even realize don't even know that they're filthy that they're that they're that dirty that they need to be cleansed i recognize it because i was like that one day yeah i recognize it because i know what i where i was before god spoke to me and cleansed me so i understand what that point is and where it is and how easily it can to try to get you and you know how easily that that filth out there will try to draw you back in again oh it's not so bad you just just take just a little corn you don't you don't need to dive right back in again you i just take this little corner over here you know that wasn't so bad that won't hurt you bad and then the next thing you know you need the next corner you need and he's got you right back in there again see filthy dirty but but thankfully the part of that is that god cleanses and when he cleanses he cleanses you completely amen now let's look at ezekiel i'm not sure if i had to turn over there yet but let's look at ezekiel for just a moment because i'll probably have to close after this scripture ezekiel chapter 36. you know friend we all were there but i i really don't even like to think back at the time when i was that filthy to think back at the time when i was when i was so dirty i mean it's amazing that god would even want to take somebody that was as filthy and dirty as i was to bring them in and clean them but you know his his blood cleanses from all unrighteousness it means all right it doesn't matter where you were it doesn't matter what you did it doesn't matter what you went through that blood cleanses from all unrighteousness amen my brother-in-law think i've told you before he said he had sinned so bad he didn't think that he could ever be clean i said that's the devil talking to you that's the devil trying to keep you from getting under the water fountain you get under the spigot and i promise you it will clean you amen now it might wash a little clot of dirt off here and then later it might wash or clot off a dirt off of here but it will cleanse you right amen it will cleanse you i had somebody before be uh j well i say judgment they were critical because i baptized the man who was still smoking and i said you know just get them under that water yeah just get them under that fountain just get them in the presence of god god will do the work that's right amen yes man i i i if someone in their heart feels they want to be baptized i'm not going to i'm not going to tell them no if they want to do it my grandson right now he's only seven but if he come and ask me i baptize him absolutely if he wanted to if somebody in their heart wanted to be then it's not for me to say no right i told him i said you know brother brown i'm baptized man oh yeah but that was brother bradley uh isn't he still the same god it was brother brown he is of us today brother brown didn't take any forward liberties that we're not ex that we don't have today right amen anyway it just somebody just wanted to be critical but the point is just get them there and get them to the place that they can get under that fountain and let god wash all that away from them god'll do it and you know god can do it eventually god did take that away from him praise the lord and to my knowledge they're still going and i think they live in ohio going to a message church still today amen amen praise the lord ezekiel ezekiel chapter i had to turn to 36 verse 25 then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and in your spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of place not stony it's just heart heart cold indifferent i'll take that that hardness away from you i'll take that cold nature and i'll give you a heart of flesh i'll give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that i give to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleanness amen save you now what he said save you from all your uncleanness and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you in other words you come back to me and i will bless you i will cleanse you i will make you clean i will rid all the uncleanness and not only that i'll take out that old cold nature and i'll give you a heart of flesh i'll put my spirit in you and i will bless you beyond measure you will never want for anything that's what god's telling them he mentioned corn but that's what he means you will walk for nothing i will bless you to where you won't be uh uh uh needful of anything and that's not what god does for us today isn't that exactly the way god blesses us today that we won't we're not in want of anything sure we have prayer requests sure we ask god for needs and things we're human we live in this world but we don't want for anything friends god blesses us god keeps us god helps us in our hands i know and this church and all of you sure we have some uh urgent prayer requests and needs and things that we have in our lives and go to the doctor and maybe a surgery or something like that but god always cleanses us god always blesses us god always keeps us amen and he keeps his hand upon every one of us watches over us every day and that's what he's telling them this is what i will do for you now back over if you look in exodus which i'll just give you as i close here the little teaser that i want to get to uh for next week with the lord willing that god would have moses take the blood of the animal that had been sacrificed and the water with the hysso and he would take that blood and he would take that water and he would take it with the hyssop to sprinkle now i know god told him to take the hype and the blood of the ant uh the lamb and uh for for them and uh the uh children of israel there in egypt and the doorpost and the lentil and the death angel wouldn't come in but he also had the process of their cleansing where he would take that blood and that water and mix it with the hyssop and he would actually sprinkle the people with it he would get the hyssop in the blood and water and sprinkle the people and the word and sprinkle it with the blood and the water if you understand see that's what actually come out of the side of jesus christ amen when they pierced it blood and water came forth well that blood cleanses you from all the sin that water washes you and keeps you clean amen the blood cleanses you the water washes you it keeps you clean so you live in that perpetual state of cleanness you live spiritually in in a place of righteousness in the eyes of god that you are clothed in his righteousness you have no spot wrinkle or blemish doesn't matter what you think well i i've done something i spat something i saw something and lord forgive me but you're living because of the holy spirit in your soul you're living in that perpetual state of cleanness god isn't that concerned about what's on the outside although the inside cleans the outside too right we ask god forgiveness of those things but the inside where god now lives in your soul if you're born again god is the resident the permanent resident of your soul you live in the perpetual existence the continual existence of cleanness in god's eyes clean pure holy righteous you look at first john in first john when when he says if you say you have no sin you deceive yourselves in ver in chapter one if you confess you're false he is just and faithful to forgive you and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness and then he says but if you say you have no sin you are a liar but then over in the second chapter or third chapter he says uh he tells us that whosoever is born of god cannot commit sin well if you're born of god you can't commit sin how can you not commit sin i make mistakes all the time every day you know brother branham told brother greene you may have heard brother green say this but brother branham told brother green he says you know brother perry he said where god has me live everything we do in the eyes of god is sin right i thought well well i hope do any of us have if everything that we do in his eyes is sin then how much that what hope is for any of us it's his spirit amen it's his spirit it's god's spirit that holy spirit living in your taking over the rest of your soul living in you born again now you are clean you're not clean today and dirty tomorrow you're clean amen because you're washed by the water of the word when you're washed by the water of the word that word cleans you when that word becomes you you're in a perpetual state of cleanness because you are the word you sound washed by the word of the word no you are the word if you become the word then you're in a perpetual state of cleanness not that we don't still make mistakes in this flesh right but if you're born of god you cannot sin where in your soul where you're born again you're not born again here you go in your mother's womb the second time like nicodemus thought you're not born but you're born again in the spirit your your soul not your actually human spirit his spirit and your soul then that born again placed out there is no sin can be no sin no sin can enter in there because when god went in there he put a seal on the door yeah and when god puts a seal on friend don't you dare ever try to break it yeah people try to people will try to all the time satan will try to and people in your life sometimes might try to yeah but when god goes in there he puts a seal on it and nobody dares to go over there or try to touch that again and the man who is born again cannot commit sin amen you're in the perpetual state of cleanness because god has cleansed you amen when god cleanses you has made you free from all sin amen praise the lord next week i want to get more to that seven days amen and that seven days that we talked about and that that and that that we just read from ezekiel the blood the water the cleanse made you clean it cleansed us amen and we stay clean because of his spirit because of the word because you become the word you live in a perpetual state of cleaning now amen now you're you're such a state i'll say this you're such a state of cleanness that all the filthiness and dirtiness of that old man that died back there that old spirit that that that nature that died back there that was divorced put away as brother branham said invisible union put away in divorcement put in his forgiveness that man's gone you don't even that doesn't even come back you don't think so satan tried to get you we have a spirit that has a memory and our memory can think back at those times but it's it's not even like well who was that man who was that person back then i don't even recognize him anymore i didn't know who that was because it's all good all gone all done away with amen in god's year forgetfulness now in the eyes of god it was is and you would justify these though you had never sinned in the first place right amen aren't you thankful that cleansing that god gives to each of us praise the lord amen let's the other we could and remember just as leprosy had no way of human human means of cleansing it had to be god had to be god then people tried to cleanse themselves from their sin today but the sin today as the sin then the leprosy uncurable like human means it takes god amen the only way to be cleansed from it is by the blood of jesus christ only way man tries to do it they do like adam during the garden of eden they try to put on some kind of covering they try to be religious and try to go to church and try to project themselves into something but you can't do it without the blood of christ you can't do it unless he comes and lives in him amen then that changes it all praise the lord amen let's sing this little course amen number 539 created me a clean heart [Music] and oh the right spirit within me [Music] away from my presence [Music] and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me all the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me hallelujah [Music] within me created me a clean heart oh god and renew a right [Music] restore unto me [Music] amen once god's filled you with this spirit friend there's nothing can take it away not even god will take it away god doesn't give it to you one day and take it back the next if he's given to you god amen and you've got it for eternity yeah praise the lord and i'm thankful that he cleanses us now now the devil can come along and try to steal your joy away amen that's why david's saying that restore lord that joy and a lot of times we need that joy restored amen amen praise the lord but it's right there just reach out and grab it it's right there so praise the lord amen god bless you appreciate you coming being here in the house of the lord today pray something was said to bless and strengthen you in some way amen thank you for coming the little conference room we have here hopefully we won't have to do this for too much longer just real quick before we dismiss i wrote to the realtor of the place that i'm looking at now uh i'm i'm looking diligently um uh for a place i'm not just settled on this one place so if the lord has something else then i you know i'm i'm willing to look so whatever the lord leads and whatever the lord provides that's what i want so that that's entirely up to the lord but in the meantime the one place that i'm still looking at i called the realtor i emailed him and he said the current church is still in negotiation with the town of marana to get the certificate of occupancy for their church for the new facility they're wanting to move into so whatever all the government stuff rent as you probably know the government stuff is just i mean it was already slow to get the city of tucson or marana or the state or something to do something was already slow but when kovan came and it i think it's getting a little better but it just it just slowed down to non-existent almost really um but so they're still working on it still working on trying to get the certificate of occupancy for them to move over to the new building i explained some of that to you last week uh i myself called the town of marana friday to make absolutely sure that once that church moves out it's okay for us to move in and occupy that uh that space the other realtor told me that you know it wouldn't be no problem you know there and there you should be in there but brother john yarborough told me he said don't take their word for it right he said you call them yourself and just make sure you want to get their word you want to hear from the town of miranda to make sure you have their word that y'all can meet in there so i called a very very nice lady uh and explained everything to us yes what we were doing and uh how big the church was and things like that so i explained all that and she's gonna give it to her develop person whoever it was uh to look into so i i don't expect or anticipate any issues but you can pray about that if you'd like and see where we go with that but just trust in the lord is going to provide whether it's that place or someplace else that the lord's going to provide for us the more i think about it the more i look at that the more i look at other places around i think you know if we get that place already set up and ready to move in and have church there's a facility see they have back to back uh thousand square foot units that run four wide two deep four wide on the other side is an empty one there's two empty ones actually next to each other and i thought well we might look into getting that but they're just they're just they're just concrete floor and wall i mean there's there's nothing to them they're just just almost like a shell so we would have to build out some stuff and make it nice for a church to do that but the other one uh is is just it's already ready there's really nothing to do we'll probably maybe do some stuff to it later but there's nothing to do to move in there and have church right now so anyway the lord willing we'll see what he does and what happens there but that's the situation right now and trust and believing even when the lady hung up she said bless you but you said god bless you when she hung up so i was very encouraged by that so um this that's just the update so it could happen at any moment could happen any day so just continue to pray for that and we'll see what the lord does and um checking in to see make sure we get some signage micah they have a sign up there now but micah said he can get us a sign made that goes over the front of where our church is supposed to be a big huge uh ten foot long four foot tall thing to put a sign on to for the church so making sure all that's okay and we're okay to meet there and everything's fine so we'll see just trying to be patient uh this may be the last time we meet here may not i don't know we'll just see what the lord does so just keep praying for that we love you appreciate you thank you for coming and being here today so i will keep you updated if something significant happens during the week i'll let you know uh otherwise we just keep going and praying and trusting the lord so that's about the update i have i also failed to mention to you that brother uh dave williamson called me yesterday and asked me for a couple prayer requests and some folks he knew back east i've forgotten their names so please forgive me but the lord knows but he asked very urgent uh request of prayer for a couple of people back in north carolina so remember that in prayer too if you would amen so i mentioned sister joy hawking too she's been in a lot of pain also some of you most of you probably may know but uh brother stephen lachlan uh his mother passed away so i asked you to pray for them and the lord would just comfort him and touch him during this time i know how he feels friday this past friday was one year anniversary of my mom passing so um certainly can't sympathize and understand the situation that brother steve's going through the passing of his mother but knowing where she's at you know i've had people come say oh you know you lost your mother i said i didn't lose her i know exactly where she is amen i don't have the pleasure of having her physical presence with me on this planet anymore like this but i know exactly where she is and i'm just waiting for her to show up one day amen yes my dad son amen i was thinking about that i got so many on the other side i got a whole nice beautiful family here and i got a whole nother one there too so amen we're all come together one day very much amen praise the lord god bless you appreciate you coming and being here today amen thank you for being a part of the service today so we love you appreciate you brother john would you just miss us in prayer brother sure heavenly father lord we thank you lord god for bringing us here today yes hear your word lord god [Music] appreciate you lord and this may you keep us all ordinary and bring us back again lord god thank you lord for filling us lord with yourself yes yes thank you lord god for helping us lord god to die out to ourselves dude that we might receive more of you more thomas jesus in jesus christ's name amen amen
