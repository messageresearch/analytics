[34:32] other purpose we didn't come for the

[35:14] strengthen us amen
[35:16] god bless you today welcome to the house
[35:18] of the lord um
[35:20] social distancing is taking a nap
[35:23] amen amen uh we're like paul
[35:27] i i've told y'all i'll tell you again uh
[35:31] my attitude about it
[35:32] uh you know when i'm out in the world
[35:34] and i'm out in life
[35:35] i i'm i'm wisdom i use precaution
[35:39] um i don't always wear a mask but i do
[35:41] where they
[35:42] mandate mandated a lot of people get
[35:45] confused between what is a law
[35:47] and what is a mandate some people come
[35:50] up and say well it's a law you have to
[35:52] no
[35:52] it's not a law it's a mandate i mean
[35:56] the legislature makes laws the executive
[35:59] branch like the governor
[36:01] mayor they can only mandate something
[36:04] that they say you need to or should do
[36:06] this
[36:06] and people say well the bible says obey
[36:08] the law well this is not a law
[36:10] it's a mandate a law is passed by the
[36:12] legislature not by executive not by
[36:14] governor not by mayor
[36:16] not by city council it's by the
[36:18] legislature when they pass a law it's
[36:20] different but anyway i
[36:21] i take my precaution but you know my
[36:24] feeling we come in these doors here
[36:25] friend we're here in the service of the
[36:27] lord
[36:27] amen we're here in the name of the lord
[36:30] we're here for the service of the lord
[36:32] and we're here because god brought us
[36:33] here and i believe
[36:35] and you know some wear masks and shields
[36:38] and that's
[36:38] perfectly fine i don't have any qualms
[36:41] with that
[36:42] uh that that's perfectly fine right but
[36:45] again i don't want it to become
[36:47] a situation to where we become divided
[36:50] by masking no masked people right
[36:52] we are all the people and children of
[36:53] god amen amen
[36:55] i believe in the bible that when when
[36:57] paul was in the service of the lord and
[37:00] he got struck by a poisonous viper he
[37:02] just shook it off in the fire and kept
[37:03] going
[37:04] and those that he was preaching to who
[37:06] thought he was a devil beginning to
[37:07] believe he was a god
[37:09] amen so things can change very quick
[37:12] when you're in the presence of the lord
[37:13] amen amen
[37:15] praise the lord so and i want you to
[37:16] know when i pray for you
[37:18] uh that that i pray a shield of
[37:21] protection around every one of you
[37:23] amen praise god god's protection his
[37:25] holy angels keep you and protect you and
[37:28] watch over you
[37:29] amen so god is god is with us amen and i
[37:33] believe that exactly
[37:34] amen i speak to the streaming i don't
[37:36] know how many streaming everybody's here
[37:37] so
[37:38] amen i missed the pats and um the zinkas
[37:42] i thought brother
[37:43] thomas sister karen might be here but
[37:44] you know brother tom had his soldier
[37:46] the shoulder surgery so he's still
[37:49] recuperating with that so continue to
[37:50] please pray for brother tom in that
[37:52] situation too
[37:53] uh but we're very thankful that god is
[37:55] ever present he's always with us
[37:57] his blessings and love he never subsides
[38:00] amen
[38:02] so we appreciate each one of you coming
[38:04] being here today if you haven't been
[38:05] here
[38:06] uh the bathroom's through the door to
[38:08] the right and
[38:09] please and for those who may be
[38:12] listening or watch don't
[38:13] park on the north side of the building
[38:16] also pray for the situation with the
[38:18] building
[38:18] um brother uh we're not sure brother nat
[38:22] seems to have been a little distant with
[38:24] brother roger myself lately but we're
[38:26] just trusting the lord taking care of it
[38:27] but you know
[38:29] if we're growing out of this building
[38:31] already maybe it's time to go someplace
[38:33] else so
[38:34] just pray about that whatever the lord's
[38:36] will is um
[38:37] i believe uh that the lord provided this
[38:40] and we moved in under that premise i
[38:42] wouldn't be here if i didn't feel it was
[38:44] the will of the lord amen
[38:46] i told brother roger out there i said
[38:48] well if the lord shut one door he'll
[38:49] open the others
[38:50] that's right i'm not i'm not i'm not
[38:52] worried about it god will provide so
[38:54] thankful for that so god bless you today
[38:56] welcome to the house of the lord

[39:05] of the reading of the word but we're
[39:06] going to go to the book of exodus
[39:11] and it it seems like that
[39:17] it seems like that the lord just keeping
[39:20] me in the old testament for some reason
[39:24] but that's quite all right amen the old
[39:27] testament provides
[39:28] plenty of types and shadows for us to
[39:30] follow and
[39:32] recognize and see what he's doing for us
[39:34] even in today's life
[39:35] amen it's amazing how god being infinite
[39:38] eternal
[39:39] uh from 6 000 years ago can kind of give
[39:42] us types and shadows of what's going on
[39:44] right now
[39:45] right amen is everybody comfortable by
[39:47] the way are you warm
[39:49] or a little bit amen
[39:53] we had it set on 73 and it was only 69

[41:46] name of the lord jesus christ
[41:48] for your glory and honor amen
[41:51] let's let's read here excuse me uh
[41:53] exodus chapter 11. let's begin with
[41:55] verse 4.
[41:57] exodus chapter 11 verse 4.
[42:03] i'm going to take a thought that i kind
[42:04] of uh
[42:06] hinted on last week and spent a couple
[42:08] of minutes on
[42:09] i want to take a whole subject here um i
[42:12] honestly
[42:13] wasn't really sure what the lord had and
[42:15] all week
[42:16] pretty much every day i'm like the lord
[42:18] uh
[42:20] you know as a pastor as a minister you
[42:23] you want to make sure first of all you
[42:24] got the mind of the lord and second of
[42:27] all
[42:28] there's something that's needful for the
[42:29] people uh that are there for that time
[42:32] and
[42:32] uh and then actually yesterday
[42:35] the lord brought me to this place and so
[42:39] um we'll just go on uh exodus 11 4 and
[42:43] moses said
[42:44] thus saith the lord about midnight will
[42:47] i go out into the midst of
[42:48] egypt and all the firstborn in the land
[42:51] of egypt shall die from the firstborn of
[42:53] pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne
[42:55] even unto the firstborn of the
[42:57] maidservant that is behind the meal
[42:59] and all the firstborn of the beast and
[43:02] there shall be a great cry throughout
[43:04] all the land of egypt such as there not
[43:06] was not like it nor
[43:08] shall be like it anymore but against any
[43:11] of the children listen now
[43:12] but against any of the children of
[43:14] israel shall not a dog
[43:16] move his tongue against man or beast
[43:19] that ye may
[43:20] know that the lord put a difference
[43:22] between the egyptians
[43:24] and israel and all these thy servants
[43:27] shall come down unto me and bow down
[43:29] themselves unto me saying get thee out
[43:31] and all the people that follow thee
[43:33] and after that i will go out and he will
[43:35] and he went
[43:36] out from pharaoh in a great anger the
[43:39] lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not
[43:41] hearken unto you that my wonders may be
[43:43] multiplied in the land of egypt
[43:45] and moses and aaron did all the things
[43:47] all these
[43:48] wonders before pharaoh and the lord
[43:50] hardened pharaoh's heart
[43:51] so that he would not let the children of
[43:53] israel go out of his land
[43:55] and you could be seated if you'd like
[43:57] i'm sure you can probably get the gist
[43:59] of the subject today
[44:01] based on my enunciation of that portion
[44:03] of the scripture
[44:04] when we got to the seventh and eighth
[44:06] verse is kind of outstanding and follows
[44:08] along with what we had talked about last
[44:10] week for a few moments
[44:12] but i want to title this today blessed
[44:14] during crisis
[44:17] blessed during crisis or could be
[44:19] blessed
[44:20] during curses were blessed during the
[44:23] curse
[44:24] amen we mentioned it again like i said
[44:26] last week when we talked about
[44:28] uh being in this situation and being in
[44:30] this land and being a part of lao to see
[44:32] it and being in this
[44:34] country and the things that's going on
[44:35] around us and all the turmoil and the
[44:37] things that's happening
[44:38] but help us to understand to have faith
[44:41] now last week we talked about rest
[44:43] and of course resting in that faith
[44:46] resting in that understanding resting in
[44:49] that knowledge
[44:50] that you know who you are in jesus
[44:52] christ brother branham said as we read
[44:54] that quote
[44:55] it's not that we're worried about going
[44:57] we know we've already made it
[44:59] we've already made it because he made it
[45:01] for us and we're on
[45:03] his side so if we're with the lord and
[45:05] he's already made it then we've made it
[45:07] with him
[45:08] he's made it for us thus we're we are
[45:10] more than conquerors because we didn't
[45:11] have to go through the battle or fight
[45:13] but we're there with him
[45:14] amen so we can rest in that fact and
[45:17] resting in that fact helped us to
[45:19] understand
[45:20] that not only are we resting in that but
[45:23] as
[45:23] this first wave of covet came through
[45:25] and i said this several times
[45:27] in our church services several times
[45:30] that god
[45:30] blessed us i mean we mother me and
[45:33] brother roger have been
[45:34] busy crazy working and been very
[45:37] prosperous
[45:38] and had a lot of work to do and we often
[45:41] talk about
[45:41] amongst ourselves uh every day we think
[45:44] you know how
[45:45] how all this has gone on and how the uh
[45:47] people are suffering and people in food
[45:49] lines longer than they've been and
[45:51] and people out of jobs and out of work
[45:53] and people are going in great debt and
[45:56] things like that because
[45:57] you know they're they're struggling real
[45:59] hard and i'm sitting here and i'm
[46:01] thinking about and i'm thinking about
[46:02] all of you and i'm thinking about how
[46:04] god has blessed us so much during this
[46:07] period of time
[46:08] where people are suffering so much when
[46:10] people are in so much want and need
[46:13] and then my mind started going back to
[46:15] think about the bible and
[46:16] and all the situations where god has
[46:18] protected and not only protected
[46:21] not only kept his people but blessed his
[46:24] people amen
[46:25] blessed abundantly his own people
[46:28] and that's what we look to as god is
[46:30] doing what he's doing around
[46:32] us and we know we're at the end we know
[46:34] that the time has come to an end we know
[46:36] that there's not much time left in this
[46:38] world we know that we're at
[46:39] the world's ending stages and we know
[46:42] that the bride goes
[46:44] out in a rapture before we actually get
[46:46] to that end stage
[46:47] right so we know we're at that season we
[46:49] know we're at that time
[46:50] so we've read the back of the book and
[46:52] we know what happens
[46:53] i told my barber thursday they were
[46:55] talking about all this stuff and
[46:57] you know and and of course i have to
[46:59] tell them about scripture and he's a
[47:00] catholic and
[47:01] i tell them about description the bible
[47:03] and you know tell them my point of view
[47:05] and they're like well i'm not so sure
[47:06] about that
[47:07] and this that and the other and i said
[47:08] well i've read the back of the book and
[47:10] the bible says this this and this oh
[47:12] really
[47:13] it does didn't know that i said when you
[47:15] go home today at least read revelation
[47:17] 13
[47:18] and it'll tell you a little bit about
[47:19] what's going on right now amen
[47:21] and while this garnering together and
[47:23] sister julie sent me a
[47:24] uh that uh article i had told you all
[47:28] about a little bit last week
[47:29] this uh this cardinal this archbishop i
[47:32] believe it was that actually called out
[47:34] the pope and
[47:35] and the things that's going on and that
[47:37] letter he wrote four or five months ago
[47:40] and some of those things i read in that
[47:41] letter actually are happening right now
[47:44] that he said and told in that letter
[47:46] what happened they're actually happening
[47:48] now
[47:49] and it wasn't something that he
[47:50] considers himself a prophet or prophetic
[47:52] or those were prophetic utterances
[47:54] those were just things of knowledge he
[47:56] had gained of
[47:57] what he knows is going on around the
[47:59] world and in his own church
[48:01] and with his own pope the things is
[48:03] happening there
[48:05] but in the midst of all that in the
[48:06] midst of the squeeze in the midst of the
[48:08] clamping down and we see the clamping
[48:10] friend amen
[48:12] we see the clamping down you you can see
[48:14] it around the world you see the control
[48:16] that that the the people that the
[48:18] government that the
[48:20] that those that are in power and those
[48:21] that have money and those that are in
[48:23] position around the world
[48:24] clamping down on people and on religion
[48:27] and mostly on christians right if you
[48:30] haven't noticed it friend we're just not
[48:32] looking but it's clamping they're
[48:34] clamping down on
[48:35] christian religion but when and we know
[48:37] brother branham said they'll
[48:39] they'll close these doors one day that's
[48:41] right and you know the doors of the
[48:42] branham tabernacle are basically closed
[48:44] you know they don't have service at
[48:45] brown
[48:46] tabernacle anymore that's right of
[48:48] course that i guess is because they got
[48:50] so many people
[48:51] but you never thought that when brother
[48:52] branham said that door would be closed
[48:54] one day that it'd be closed by his own
[48:56] people
[48:58] but the doors closed they don't have
[48:59] church there anymore but we know what's
[49:01] going on we know what's happening
[49:04] we know and this is just preparing our
[49:06] hearts and understanding
[49:07] where we're at today and applying it
[49:10] scripturally
[49:11] so when i began to think about the the
[49:14] several different and and if you've read
[49:16] your bible and you know the scripture
[49:18] you know the things i'm talking about uh
[49:21] i'm not giving you anything new i'm just
[49:22] bringing your remembrance and trying to
[49:24] encourage you today
[49:25] that if we as the children of god get
[49:28] caught up in the world of the
[49:29] worldliness and all the things that's
[49:30] going on there you're going to end up
[49:32] being defeated
[49:33] but if you stand upon the word of god
[49:35] and you pray and you read your bible and
[49:37] you stand on the promises of god's word
[49:39] as a child of god
[49:40] filled with the holy ghost god is going
[49:41] to bless you
[49:43] you're going to be blessed and
[49:44] prosperous in the middle of all this
[49:46] that's right and that first wave i
[49:48] thought and
[49:49] many days and i mentioned it in church
[49:51] many times friend we were we were
[49:53] helped we were blessed i
[49:56] can't think of and you're and feel free
[49:59] to raise your hand now in all fairness
[50:01] we have
[50:02] you know a third of our church or so
[50:04] that's retired so
[50:05] um they didn't stop the social security
[50:08] checks from coming in for
[50:10] for those but you can raise your hand if
[50:12] i'm wrong but i don't know of anybody
[50:14] that lost their job during that time
[50:17] even sister shelia who has a job that's
[50:20] really very much hands-on
[50:22] they figured out a way for her to do her
[50:24] job remotely
[50:26] right so she could keep doing what she
[50:28] was doing god
[50:29] blesses his people in the middle of
[50:31] crisis and god blesses his people in the
[50:33] middle of curses
[50:35] even when uh sister norman your sister
[50:38] passed away
[50:39] but listen as her sister passed away at
[50:41] the great testimony that she has
[50:43] on her sister's passing friend to
[50:46] understand
[50:47] that she went into the arms of jesus
[50:49] what greater thing could you imagine for
[50:51] your siblings
[50:53] what kind of thing could you imagine for
[50:54] your parent or for your child or for
[50:56] anybody
[50:57] that you love that they're now in the
[50:59] arms of the lord
[51:01] praise the lord that's what matters the
[51:03] most
[51:05] we just need to make sure our lives are
[51:07] in his hands too
[51:09] and that we're in the position that
[51:10] we're supposed to be in because as god
[51:13] began to
[51:14] uh lower the curses on israel
[51:17] on egypt he made sure and told moses and
[51:21] moses
[51:22] told pharaoh that israel would be exempt
[51:25] from these curse amen he did amen amen
[51:29] now what was the curse the curse was
[51:31] that the firstborn of egypt
[51:34] no matter how old that firstborn was no
[51:37] matter whether that firstborn was a
[51:38] human or an animal
[51:40] every firstborn to the animals would be
[51:43] healed that's right
[51:44] we know that the death age will come and
[51:47] sweep through the land oh man
[51:49] what did we talk about last week israel
[51:51] was a part of egypt
[51:53] israel was in egypt i should say i mean
[51:56] part of egypt but they were in egypt
[51:59] so if israel was in egypt they were in
[52:01] the middle of the curse
[52:03] they were in the middle of the crisis
[52:06] but what did god tell them
[52:08] god spoke to moses spoke through moses
[52:11] or aaron his mouthpiece and spoke to the
[52:14] pharaoh
[52:15] and said the firstborn of egypt and all
[52:17] the beasts shall die
[52:18] and there'll be such a greater crime
[52:20] throughout the egypt that has never been
[52:22] before
[52:23] and never will be since but the seventh
[52:26] verse says
[52:27] but amen i love that
[52:31] that butt makes an exemption yeah that
[52:34] exemption says but against
[52:36] any of the children of israel shall i
[52:39] say today but any of the children of god
[52:42] today amen any of the children of god
[52:45] right now any of you here this morning
[52:49] are on streaming
[52:52] shall not a dog move his tongue
[52:56] against man or beast that ye may know
[52:58] how that the lord
[53:00] that put a difference between egypt
[53:03] and israel amen or god has put a
[53:07] difference
[53:08] between the world and his children amen
[53:11] amen amen friend we are in this world
[53:14] but we're not of this world
[53:16] and god has placed a stark difference
[53:19] between the world and between his
[53:22] children
[53:23] that's why you look at it and the
[53:25] difference gets greater
[53:26] all the time the difference is more
[53:29] visible
[53:30] all the time even it used to be when i
[53:33] was growing up
[53:34] a man in the message was almost like any
[53:38] other man
[53:39] you couldn't tell them and somewhat
[53:41] still that way the sisters always been
[53:43] the one
[53:44] that god has put now go with me here
[53:47] god has put on display right
[53:50] the christian woman as the greatest
[53:53] example
[53:54] of the separation that god has drawn
[53:57] between the world and his people amen
[54:00] amen but even now
[54:02] now it's getting to the place that
[54:05] the the man is so different yes right
[54:08] it's almost like even the man now
[54:11] because you know
[54:12] you you live your life you live your
[54:13] life as a christian you say clean living
[54:15] and
[54:16] and all you do what the bible says and
[54:17] obedience to the word and you live your
[54:19] life
[54:20] but even the man now the world has
[54:22] gotten so
[54:23] wicked that even the christian man's
[54:26] life
[54:26] is drawing a difference people are
[54:29] seeing the difference in the christian
[54:31] man now not as much as the sisters now
[54:34] of course
[54:34] because you'll always be the one that
[54:36] god set forth right
[54:38] amen amen because remember you're the
[54:40] you're the one that god
[54:41] endowed to bring life into this world
[54:44] right right i said that two or three
[54:46] times and i don't know how to
[54:48] make that anymore i mean that's how much
[54:50] god loves and thinks of his children
[54:52] and how much god loves and thinks of the
[54:54] godly sister see
[54:56] but god said that as an example and he
[54:58] set it aside
[54:59] and a part that you would understand and
[55:02] that you could see
[55:03] the difference it's not just something
[55:06] that's just spiritual although that's
[55:08] the greater difference
[55:09] but it's a spiritual thing that
[55:11] manifests itself in a
[55:13] physical manifestation so people can
[55:15] look at it as a tangible item
[55:18] that you are different than the world
[55:20] right
[55:21] you're called out and god wants to make
[55:24] you let you know today just like he did
[55:26] israel
[55:27] that he has drawn a line between the
[55:30] difference of the world
[55:31] and his children amen between the world
[55:34] and what's going on
[55:35] on out there and what he has done for
[55:38] you
[55:38] and for his children around the world
[55:41] there's that difference
[55:42] and it's a stark difference because some
[55:45] people
[55:46] are able to hold it together some people
[55:48] are suffering
[55:49] some people don't have a job you know
[55:52] that they have this
[55:53] uh protection for
[55:56] not being evicted out of your home
[55:59] right right but you know that people say
[56:02] well you don't have to pay the rent
[56:03] because they're not going to evict you
[56:05] that might be true you don't have to pay
[56:07] your mortgage because you're not going
[56:09] to get evicted that might be true
[56:11] you might have to pay your power bill
[56:12] because your power is not going to be
[56:13] turned off that might be true you don't
[56:15] have to pay your water because your
[56:16] water is not going to get up that might
[56:17] be true
[56:18] but what they're doing is accruing all
[56:21] those monthly bills
[56:22] that's right right and all these people
[56:24] out here when that time hits about the
[56:26] time excuse me that about the time that
[56:28] joe biden
[56:28] is supposed to take off us about that
[56:31] same time
[56:32] is when all this stuff's going to go
[56:33] away yeah and people are going to be
[56:36] tens of
[56:36] thousands of dollars in debt right right
[56:39] they've been months and months and
[56:40] months without having to pay the rent
[56:42] well if they can't pay up let's just say
[56:44] a thousand dollars this month
[56:46] then it's 2 000 in the next month right
[56:48] they can't pay that is 3 000 the next
[56:50] month
[56:51] it's four yeah you're not getting
[56:52] evicted but at the end of this you're
[56:54] going to owe 10 grand
[56:55] to the people that are your landlords
[56:57] and not only that but you're gonna have
[56:58] a thousand dollar
[56:59] a power bill you're gonna have a 500
[57:01] water bill what are these people going
[57:03] to do
[57:05] but god has not only sustained you
[57:09] hear me now and you correct me if i'm
[57:11] wrong
[57:12] god has not only sustained you but god
[57:15] has blessed you
[57:16] amen god has blessed us god has
[57:19] blessed her sister julie had just gotten
[57:23] a brand new job and you think man if
[57:25] there's anybody during this time of
[57:26] shutdown
[57:27] that's right for the firing it would be
[57:29] someone just hired him
[57:30] right oh no no they didn't fire they
[57:33] just let her work from home
[57:35] praise the lord just work for home it's
[57:37] okay still has her job
[57:40] god blesses his children in the middle
[57:42] of crisis god takes care of his children
[57:44] but now i want you to see something and
[57:46] see something very clearly because it's
[57:48] god's children that we're separating not
[57:50] not make believers and unbelievers but
[57:53] the division is made between the
[57:54] believer
[57:55] the believer and the unbelievers those
[57:57] that are there that are pretending to be
[57:59] that's a whole different scenario i'm
[58:01] talking about the true believer i'm
[58:02] talking about the board again
[58:04] holy ghost field children of god amen
[58:07] because
[58:07] notice when the children of israel were
[58:09] not going to read it but when the
[58:11] children of israel was given this
[58:12] promise
[58:13] and egypt was told that the firstborn of
[58:15] everyone was going to die
[58:17] but god made an exemption for the
[58:19] children of israel
[58:21] they had to obey god's word
[58:24] or they were a part of the curse amen
[58:27] right
[58:28] yes god said the children of israel are
[58:31] exempt absolutely
[58:32] i agree with that but look at the
[58:35] condition that god
[58:36] gave moses to give to the children of
[58:38] israel that exempted them
[58:40] amen they had to be under the blood
[58:45] to be protected from this death angel
[58:47] amen
[58:48] amen amen they had to be under the blood
[58:51] they had to be we'll say in today's
[58:54] terms
[58:54] born again they had to have the holy
[58:57] ghost
[58:58] they had to be filled with god's spirit
[59:00] they had to be under the blood
[59:02] right you had to be under the blood
[59:03] today you can't just come out and say oh
[59:05] well i i believe it's all okay and i'm
[59:07] going to be fine and everything's great
[59:09] don't work that way
[59:10] you must get under the blood amen that's
[59:12] the only way it worked for them today
[59:14] then it's the only way it'll work today
[59:16] amen is to have your life and every bit
[59:19] about you under that blood
[59:20] under the protection of that token the
[59:22] holy spirit amen
[59:23] that's the only way you're exempt from
[59:25] it amen that's the only way you get
[59:27] blessed
[59:28] now israel because they were under it
[59:31] god judged them as a nation
[59:33] as a people they were many members but
[59:36] one god considered them as one group
[59:40] but now the gentile is a many men for
[59:42] body that god deals with
[59:43] individually so this is an individual
[59:46] affair
[59:47] she said well my daddy's under don't
[59:49] protect you
[59:50] oh my mommy's under don't protect you oh
[59:53] my pastor's under
[59:55] doesn't protect you ate my children
[59:57] under
[59:58] doesn't protect you what protects you
[1:00:01] is when you are under the blood when you
[1:00:04] have the holy ghost
[1:00:05] you're born again and you are in christ
[1:00:08] and christ is in you
[1:00:09] amen that's your protection that's your
[1:00:12] blessing remember god only blessed
[1:00:16] israel when they were in their homeland
[1:00:18] god only blesses his children today when
[1:00:20] we're in our homeland
[1:00:22] what is our homeland the holy ghost amen
[1:00:25] when we're in christ the word we have
[1:00:28] that exemption
[1:00:29] thank you and not only are we kept from
[1:00:33] the crisis
[1:00:34] we are blessed in the middle of it thank
[1:00:37] you
[1:00:37] amen amen you know that you're blessed
[1:00:39] today amen amen you know that god has
[1:00:41] blessed
[1:00:42] you not and i mean i know i'm talking a
[1:00:43] lot monetarily but
[1:00:45] it's not just monetary blessings god has
[1:00:48] blessed us physically god has blessed us
[1:00:50] spiritually god reveals his word to us
[1:00:52] god has given us health and strength and
[1:00:54] our families and we've been blessed amen
[1:00:57] because god blesses us
[1:00:58] in that hallelujah and we trust him
[1:01:01] every amendment he does
[1:01:03] we trust him for that amen we're not
[1:01:05] subjects of this world
[1:01:07] we're not subjects of this cosmos or
[1:01:09] subjects of god
[1:01:10] amen you go home and read revelation 13
[1:01:13] as i told my barber the other day
[1:01:15] you go home and read revelation 13
[1:01:17] you'll see what's about to strike what
[1:01:19] is striking
[1:01:20] not about to what is striking right
[1:01:24] what's going on in this world when this
[1:01:25] country right now is happening
[1:01:27] right now and that mark of the beast is
[1:01:31] here friend
[1:01:32] that's right it was here 50 years ago
[1:01:34] when brother adam said it was here yes
[1:01:36] if it was here 50 years ago it's here
[1:01:38] now yeah man
[1:01:39] it's the same thing and people make the
[1:01:41] same mistake
[1:01:42] all the time they think their fellowship
[1:01:45] with the church or their
[1:01:46] their name on a book or their their
[1:01:48] their
[1:01:49] fellowship card is going to get them
[1:01:51] into into heaven
[1:01:52] doesn't work that way that's right you
[1:01:54] have to have your own experience with
[1:01:56] jesus christ amen
[1:01:57] i'm not putting those churches out maybe
[1:01:59] they know god maybe the pastor is born
[1:02:01] again i don't know
[1:02:02] but i know that the mark of the beast
[1:02:04] lies in the nomination because that's
[1:02:05] what the prophet of god said
[1:02:07] amen so if he said it i believe it amen
[1:02:10] you take that dogma you take that
[1:02:12] fellowship what does it do
[1:02:13] it gets on you as dogma right that's
[1:02:16] when the separation comes
[1:02:18] but do you see how that's coming now
[1:02:20] because all those denominations going
[1:02:21] back to mom are right anyways
[1:02:23] yes right the mother church and they all
[1:02:25] go back to the mother church
[1:02:26] and and then the pope steps forward
[1:02:30] and takes over we see where this is
[1:02:32] getting to be to the place
[1:02:34] that they're all joined together that
[1:02:36] they all end up
[1:02:37] giving power to that image of the beast
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:41] and the mark of the beast is set in well
[1:02:42] unless you have this and this and this
[1:02:45] you're not a part of us right if you're
[1:02:47] not a part of them
[1:02:48] then you can't buy or sell now we're
[1:02:49] getting into tribulation of course i
[1:02:51] don't plan to be here that time
[1:02:52] right now that's what's going on this is
[1:02:55] going to transition from
[1:02:57] now to that place from now to that point
[1:03:00] if you're here during the tribulation
[1:03:02] then you can understand what i'm talking
[1:03:04] about and you'll see it happen
[1:03:06] live amen but my prayer is that none of
[1:03:09] you are
[1:03:09] right it is god amen my prayer is that
[1:03:12] none of you are
[1:03:13] that's my prayer but we're not subjects
[1:03:15] of this cosmos
[1:03:17] amen we're not subjects of this world
[1:03:19] we're subject to god we're here as
[1:03:21] pilgrims and strangers
[1:03:23] we're here uh in this laodicea and just
[1:03:26] just sojourners in this world that's
[1:03:28] right we're just
[1:03:29] sojourning away as god gives us the
[1:03:32] the leadership and as god helps us to do
[1:03:35] his will upon this earth and
[1:03:37] maybe there is another seed out there
[1:03:39] that god wants to bring us to maybe
[1:03:41] there's somebody out there god wants us
[1:03:42] to witness to
[1:03:44] somebody there that god wants us to help
[1:03:46] we do that by the leading of the lord
[1:03:48] god leads us and that's where we go with
[1:03:51] every day that god gives us
[1:03:53] because we'll have a time because we're
[1:03:55] not promised tomorrow
[1:03:56] right so if we're not promised tomorrow
[1:03:58] we don't know what tomorrow holds we all
[1:03:59] got plans for tomorrow i imagine most of
[1:04:01] us do anyway
[1:04:02] well well we're going to do this this
[1:04:04] and this i mean we all got plans but
[1:04:06] we're not promised tomorrow may not even
[1:04:07] be
[1:04:07] here so what god wants us to do we do
[1:04:10] now
[1:04:11] we do with the time that god give us and
[1:04:13] god give us now
[1:04:14] that's why you're here this morning
[1:04:16] that's why we're doing the best we can
[1:04:17] with what god's given us that we're here
[1:04:19] gathered together
[1:04:20] with the word of god to let god minister
[1:04:22] to us and reveal his word to us so we
[1:04:24] become closer
[1:04:25] more like him i don't want to be more
[1:04:28] like mutant bennett i want to be more
[1:04:30] like jesus
[1:04:31] i don't want to be more like you i want
[1:04:33] to be more like him i don't want to be
[1:04:35] more like brother branham
[1:04:36] i want to be more like jesus that's my
[1:04:39] goal that's what i'm shooting for
[1:04:41] i'm shooting to be to emulate the life
[1:04:44] of jesus
[1:04:45] we're in this world we're in this layout
[1:04:47] to see a spirit
[1:04:48] you know this layout to see a spirit of
[1:04:50] course the bible talks about in
[1:04:52] revelation 3 it talks about it being
[1:04:53] lukewarm
[1:04:54] and it's very lukewarm you see the
[1:04:57] lukewarmness spreading and god help us
[1:04:58] if it leaks in
[1:05:00] has been leaking into the message
[1:05:02] through lukewarmness
[1:05:04] brother dennis prayed about it lord
[1:05:06] let's not be
[1:05:08] lukewarm that's that layout to see in
[1:05:09] spirit that's right now
[1:05:11] you're in the world and we're blessed in
[1:05:13] the middle of this crisis
[1:05:14] but as you're as you're blessing this
[1:05:16] crisis your body
[1:05:18] is a time element body that is still
[1:05:20] subject to the things of the world
[1:05:22] that's right
[1:05:23] amen if you don't think so uh
[1:05:26] after church take the hammer that's in
[1:05:29] here
[1:05:29] and whack your finger with it you'll
[1:05:32] find out real quick that your body is
[1:05:34] still
[1:05:35] subject to the elements of this world
[1:05:38] yes
[1:05:38] don't do that please but seriously
[1:05:43] you you'll understand real quick our
[1:05:44] bodies are still a subject
[1:05:46] so if our bodies are subject to the
[1:05:48] elements of the world in our spirits
[1:05:50] right our spirits are subject to the
[1:05:52] elements of the world so
[1:05:54] we fight against the principalities and
[1:05:56] powers since
[1:05:57] uh uh uh dark places and and and of the
[1:06:00] spirit realm
[1:06:01] sometimes spirits so if if our
[1:06:04] spirit is still subject to the spirits
[1:06:06] that's in the world today then the
[1:06:08] spirit of laodicea
[1:06:09] can creep in on your spirit that's right
[1:06:12] and in your spirit make you start
[1:06:14] becoming
[1:06:15] lackadaisical and lazy and lukewarm
[1:06:18] and meaning of course uh it also the
[1:06:21] word laodicea in other words
[1:06:23] jesus typed it as lukewarmness it
[1:06:25] actually means people's rights
[1:06:27] or your rights and friend if we've never
[1:06:30] seen before in this world
[1:06:32] people are asking for rights look don't
[1:06:35] get me wrong
[1:06:38] i have my own opinion and thoughts of
[1:06:40] things
[1:06:41] so i'll just say it this way there are
[1:06:43] people in this country right now
[1:06:46] screening for rights they already have
[1:06:49] that's correct so
[1:06:53] what is it that they're wanting what is
[1:06:56] it that they're
[1:06:57] fighting what is it that they're
[1:06:58] striving for when they've got the rights
[1:07:01] they're screaming about
[1:07:04] to fund the police and so on and so
[1:07:05] forth yeah they got the rights they're
[1:07:08] screaming about
[1:07:09] so what do they want they don't want
[1:07:12] anything they are living an
[1:07:16] unbridled unfiltered
[1:07:20] desire and lust for something they'll
[1:07:23] never have
[1:07:24] amen and they keep craving for it
[1:07:27] in this place in this place over here
[1:07:30] and over there
[1:07:32] and but yet they're lost and their their
[1:07:34] their desire
[1:07:36] is to attain to something that
[1:07:39] monetarily
[1:07:40] physically they already have amen but
[1:07:43] there's that
[1:07:44] drive and that craving and that yearning
[1:07:48] to get to something that they'll never
[1:07:50] have amen
[1:07:51] so they just keep they just keep on and
[1:07:53] keep on and keep on
[1:07:55] and keep pressing keep pushing keep
[1:07:56] striving
[1:07:58] because they're just going to keep on
[1:07:59] going until until there's nothing left
[1:08:02] to go on about
[1:08:03] because they're under the influence of
[1:08:05] laodicea
[1:08:06] right they're under the influence of
[1:08:08] people's rights
[1:08:10] they're under the influence of my rights
[1:08:13] i i have a right to my rights
[1:08:17] and if you think on it long enough and
[1:08:19] you think of it logically
[1:08:21] that makes perfect sense does it not man
[1:08:24] logically it makes perfect sense i have
[1:08:28] rights of my own
[1:08:30] but as a christian we have relinquished
[1:08:33] our rights
[1:08:34] that's right we are lambs
[1:08:38] of god and we have relinquished our
[1:08:41] rights to his will
[1:08:42] amen and we don't have rights our rights
[1:08:46] are his rights amen
[1:08:48] and what god does for us is all that
[1:08:50] matters that's right
[1:08:52] we're in this world and subject to the
[1:08:54] world is subject to the powers that are
[1:08:57] as much as i dislike that in some cases
[1:09:00] we are subject to the powers that exist
[1:09:03] correct
[1:09:04] right if we're subject to the powers
[1:09:06] that exist we give the benevolence to
[1:09:08] that that is due
[1:09:09] scripturally but outside of that friend
[1:09:13] my allegiance is to god amen amen
[1:09:16] my purpose and will is to the lord jesus
[1:09:19] and my rights have been relinquished to
[1:09:21] him
[1:09:22] amen so when you get into the middle of
[1:09:24] that
[1:09:25] nail to see him and if that laodicea
[1:09:28] presses in on you
[1:09:30] my rights is it's my rights that
[1:09:33] then you're going to be in that same
[1:09:34] argument you're going to be in the
[1:09:36] middle of that same
[1:09:37] fuss right arguing and fighting over
[1:09:40] something that already exists
[1:09:41] amen amen amen people
[1:09:44] sometimes people seem to fight and
[1:09:47] struggle and
[1:09:48] and go every which way to try to get
[1:09:50] something that god has already given
[1:09:52] them
[1:09:53] let's just say healing for an example
[1:09:55] yes amen amen healing sometimes seems
[1:09:58] unattainable right and sometimes we get
[1:10:01] very impatient
[1:10:03] but the thing that we strive and we
[1:10:05] fight and we we we struggle for
[1:10:07] god's already given it to you praise god
[1:10:10] healing is already there god has already
[1:10:13] purchased it
[1:10:14] it is yours thank you jesus it's a
[1:10:17] matter of faith and stepping
[1:10:19] into it and believing that god has
[1:10:21] already finished it
[1:10:23] amen that's just an example
[1:10:26] but notice now in the church age book in
[1:10:29] the laodicean
[1:10:30] church age i'm going to use this to
[1:10:33] transition to the next part i want to
[1:10:35] get to
[1:10:37] notice the name laodicea the people's
[1:10:39] rights or
[1:10:40] justice of the peoples that's that's the
[1:10:43] meaning of laodicea
[1:10:44] it's luke it's spirit is lukewarmness
[1:10:47] yes
[1:10:48] it's definition is the people's rights
[1:10:51] or the justice of the peoples
[1:10:54] was there never an age like the 20th
[1:10:56] century church
[1:10:58] or i'll just say 21st century as we have
[1:11:00] transitioned into now
[1:11:02] 21st century church age that has seen
[1:11:05] all nations
[1:11:06] rising up and demanding equality
[1:11:09] socially and financially
[1:11:12] what does that sound like sounds like
[1:11:15] the crowd that's going on and getting
[1:11:16] louder
[1:11:17] in this country socialism
[1:11:21] which is nothing but a socialism is
[1:11:24] communist junior that's all socialism
[1:11:27] yeah
[1:11:28] socialism is communist junior because
[1:11:31] they're the same thing
[1:11:32] basically there's a couple of small
[1:11:34] little based
[1:11:35] what i consider insignificant
[1:11:37] differences but it's really communism
[1:11:39] is what it is but that's exactly the
[1:11:43] the sound that's going on today
[1:11:44] demanding equality socially financially
[1:11:47] this is the age of the communists where
[1:11:50] all men
[1:11:50] are supposedly equal though it is not
[1:11:54] but it is only so in theory it is only
[1:11:57] so
[1:11:58] when they're out on the stump and
[1:11:59] they're telling the people oh you have
[1:12:01] rights and we're all supposed to be on
[1:12:03] the same plane
[1:12:04] equal level doesn't work that way right
[1:12:07] never have
[1:12:08] right and anytime they try the country
[1:12:10] to do that it doesn't work
[1:12:12] and the people are the ones that suffer
[1:12:14] from it oh the the ones that are crying
[1:12:17] and screaming about it oh they do fine
[1:12:19] jose got millions of dollars they're in
[1:12:22] powers of positions of power
[1:12:24] they do just fine what they do is they
[1:12:26] boss around and tell everybody else what
[1:12:28] to do
[1:12:28] and suppress you down oh you're all
[1:12:31] equal yeah but you're all equal in
[1:12:32] poverty
[1:12:34] right well they're up in all their power
[1:12:36] and all their money
[1:12:37] right oh yeah equality all right
[1:12:40] equality in the fact that they are the
[1:12:41] ones that own all the power and money
[1:12:45] it only works communism socialism only
[1:12:49] works
[1:12:50] in a in a society where the people
[1:12:54] are subject completely
[1:12:57] to the government to the powers that be
[1:12:59] and to those that are in charge have the
[1:13:01] money
[1:13:02] remember what i told you last week it
[1:13:04] sounds great when they say oh we're
[1:13:06] going to pay all your bills we're going
[1:13:07] to pay off all your debt we're going to
[1:13:08] give you all this money every month
[1:13:10] we're going to give you uh there's
[1:13:12] already been people out in congress say
[1:13:13] we ought to pay everybody truth out
[1:13:15] everybody in the united states
[1:13:16] citizen and legally illegal aliens you
[1:13:19] get two thousand dollars a month
[1:13:20] yeah and free healthcare well my
[1:13:23] question is where's all that money
[1:13:24] coming from
[1:13:25] yeah just crank up the 3d or
[1:13:28] or the laser printer whatever you know
[1:13:30] just keep rolling them out you know
[1:13:32] until we get so far in debt which we
[1:13:34] already now
[1:13:34] you can't get out you can't get out of
[1:13:37] debt then where do you are you subject
[1:13:38] to those that you're in debt too
[1:13:40] yes yeah amen in steps to pope
[1:13:44] he's got the authority he's got the the
[1:13:47] the
[1:13:47] backing he's got the uh uh
[1:13:50] the the stature
[1:13:54] and almost every if not every single
[1:13:57] socioeconomic group in the world
[1:14:01] likes him amen from muslims
[1:14:05] to jews and all across the board
[1:14:08] yeah and you heard what he said about
[1:14:12] homosexual unions the other day that's
[1:14:14] right
[1:14:16] this is the age of political parties who
[1:14:19] call themselves
[1:14:19] christian democrats and christian
[1:14:21] socialists christian commonwealth
[1:14:23] federation etc
[1:14:25] according to our liberal theologians
[1:14:27] jesus was a
[1:14:28] socialist and the early church under the
[1:14:31] guidance of the spirit
[1:14:32] practiced socialism and thus we ought to
[1:14:35] do so today
[1:14:37] when the ancients called laodicea the
[1:14:39] metropolis it was looking forward
[1:14:41] it was looking forward to the one world
[1:14:43] government that we
[1:14:44] are now setting up amen
[1:14:48] which is very much highlighted in the
[1:14:51] article
[1:14:52] i tell you sister julie sent me that i
[1:14:54] have read four or five times now through
[1:14:57] setting up and we know it was at that
[1:15:00] certain place a certain time
[1:15:01] you say well you know if it was coming
[1:15:03] to at that time why didn't it just
[1:15:05] happen
[1:15:06] wait you know that there's scriptural
[1:15:08] precedence
[1:15:09] for things evolving and and happening
[1:15:12] and god says no whole wait
[1:15:14] hold it back stop we're going to wait
[1:15:17] till this happens
[1:15:18] right revelation 7 comes to my mind you
[1:15:21] look at revelation
[1:15:22] 7 and the angels have the four corners
[1:15:25] of the earth and are about to destroy
[1:15:27] the earth and god says hold him back
[1:15:29] yeah right don't destroy it we got to
[1:15:31] mark those
[1:15:32] that have the holy ghost the sign cry of
[1:15:34] the abomination see
[1:15:35] we got to mark those god said hold it
[1:15:37] stop it
[1:15:39] wait so if it's not happened then
[1:15:42] there must have been a reason for it
[1:15:43] amen but as it comes forward
[1:15:46] and you see all of these scriptures all
[1:15:49] of the prophecies
[1:15:50] unfolding before you friend how could we
[1:15:52] mistake what's going on right now
[1:15:54] amen how the scripture and the message
[1:15:58] is unfolding itself for us to identify
[1:16:00] ourselves in it to see what's going on
[1:16:03] and that's exactly what's happening they
[1:16:05] say jesus was a socialist
[1:16:07] well you know when the when the the
[1:16:09] disciples got the holy ghost and told
[1:16:11] everybody to sell everything and put it
[1:16:13] all in a pot and give to whatever need
[1:16:14] they needed
[1:16:15] but that's where people that were born
[1:16:17] again amen if you got people that's born
[1:16:19] again and filled with the holy ghost
[1:16:21] it'll work
[1:16:22] right right but you get a serpent seed
[1:16:23] in the middle of that mess and you got a
[1:16:25] mess
[1:16:25] that's right and we don't have just a
[1:16:27] serpent seed we've got millions
[1:16:29] billions of serpent seed that we've got
[1:16:31] to deal with around so you think it's
[1:16:32] going to work there with the serpent see
[1:16:33] in the middle of that
[1:16:34] right serpency greed uh
[1:16:37] arrogance and all that comes with the
[1:16:39] serpents you think that's going to work
[1:16:41] right it doesn't work under capitalism
[1:16:44] you think it's going to work under
[1:16:45] socialism that's right brother
[1:16:46] brother brown said the best form of
[1:16:48] government was a monarchy with the king
[1:16:49] that had the heart of the people
[1:16:51] right amen amen that's right that's
[1:16:53] right because he is that key
[1:16:55] that's right when his economy works
[1:16:57] perfect
[1:16:58] amen it just won't happen in this world
[1:17:00] why because you still have satan's
[1:17:02] eating
[1:17:02] you still have serpent seed in the midst
[1:17:04] of all that that's right you got serpent
[1:17:06] seed involved in it friend it doesn't
[1:17:08] work
[1:17:08] right not gonna work amen
[1:17:12] all this one world government that
[1:17:14] they're setting up now
[1:17:15] as we and and just perfect for the pope
[1:17:17] to come in
[1:17:18] right it's all going to be that one
[1:17:20] great thing he's going to come in and
[1:17:21] say i'll take it over i'll buy it out
[1:17:23] and and the people that had that he has
[1:17:26] garnered their favor they're going to
[1:17:27] throw their lot to him
[1:17:29] amen and they're probably i'm just
[1:17:31] guessing they're going to say if there's
[1:17:32] any man that can do this
[1:17:34] it's him right if there's anybody that
[1:17:37] can take this over and make it work it's
[1:17:39] him
[1:17:40] right so much so that the vatican is
[1:17:42] even going to make that
[1:17:44] covenant with the jews that's right now
[1:17:47] remember though
[1:17:48] i can't remember if i got that i did i
[1:17:50] printed that quote
[1:17:52] it's going to be after the bride leaves
[1:17:54] though right amen
[1:17:55] i'll read you that quote in a minute but
[1:17:56] that's going to be after the bride
[1:17:58] leaves but it'll be so much
[1:17:59] so that the vatican will even make a
[1:18:02] covenant with the jews
[1:18:03] with israel of course you'll break it
[1:18:06] but amen
[1:18:07] that that's that's i'm trying to make
[1:18:09] the point of how the favoritism
[1:18:11] that he's garnering from all the people
[1:18:14] amen amen and he's taking it over
[1:18:16] it's uh we're at this place friend as we
[1:18:19] think this city being a location of
[1:18:21] great council
[1:18:22] foreshadow the ecumenical move taking
[1:18:24] place today we're in very
[1:18:26] very soon we'll see all the so-called
[1:18:28] christians come together
[1:18:30] those denominations and those that are
[1:18:33] the the harlots
[1:18:34] indeed the church and state religion and
[1:18:36] politics are coming together the tares
[1:18:38] are being bound
[1:18:39] the wheat will soon be ready for the
[1:18:40] garner that's right
[1:18:42] that's us the wheat ready for the garden
[1:18:46] now let's go over there's several places
[1:18:48] in the scripture that you can
[1:18:50] find and see but the nation that come to
[1:18:52] my heart when i was studying through
[1:18:54] this is first kings chapter 17.
[1:19:00] it's about elijah and it's about
[1:19:03] elijah's progress from the time that he
[1:19:06] goes before
[1:19:07] ahab and declares no rain or dew
[1:19:10] until the time of mount carmel showdown
[1:19:13] and just after
[1:19:15] and that little synopsis of elijah's
[1:19:17] life tells us a lot
[1:19:19] about what happened to him and what's
[1:19:21] going on i think what i believe what's
[1:19:23] going on
[1:19:24] right now right today first kings
[1:19:27] chapter 17 let's just read verse one
[1:19:31] first t first kings 17 1 and elijah the
[1:19:34] tishbite
[1:19:35] who is of the inhabitants of gilead said
[1:19:37] unto ahab as the lord god of
[1:19:39] israel liveth before whom i stand
[1:19:43] there shall not be dew nor rain these
[1:19:45] years but according to
[1:19:47] my word notice elijah said according to
[1:19:51] my word well where was his word coming
[1:19:55] from
[1:19:56] what was his word being influenced by
[1:19:59] right
[1:19:59] god so as he's saying my word what he's
[1:20:02] saying is god's word because god's
[1:20:03] speaking through me
[1:20:05] but he identified the fact that he was
[1:20:08] in god
[1:20:10] god was in him right right they were the
[1:20:12] communion
[1:20:13] fellowship together that was that was
[1:20:16] standing before ahab to say i'm going to
[1:20:20] be the one to speak
[1:20:21] it god is going to use this instrument
[1:20:24] and there's many places in the bible
[1:20:25] we've referenced it maybe we'll take a
[1:20:27] whole study on it sometimes
[1:20:28] but we've referenced where god says in
[1:20:31] the bible the bible says
[1:20:32] i will but himself he didn't go
[1:20:35] right he always he sends a
[1:20:37] representative amen he said somebody
[1:20:39] down from his dead
[1:20:40] in his place to be there on his behalf
[1:20:43] right now that helps us today to
[1:20:45] understand that god didn't just do that
[1:20:47] then he does it now
[1:20:49] and that we are sitting here we are here
[1:20:51] today on behalf
[1:20:52] of the lord jesus as his mouthpiece
[1:20:55] amen as his word as he's speaking and
[1:20:59] speaking to us
[1:21:00] and us speaking through uh us speaking
[1:21:03] to
[1:21:04] whatever he gives us to speak whoever he
[1:21:06] gives us we could do
[1:21:08] whatever it might be it's god amen
[1:21:11] working through his instruments working
[1:21:13] through his children
[1:21:15] elijah here he said there'll be no rain
[1:21:17] no do fall
[1:21:18] these years until i call for it until i
[1:21:21] say so
[1:21:22] but look now who was an inhabitant
[1:21:25] of the land that he just cursed he is
[1:21:29] right he is an inhabiter of the land
[1:21:33] he just cursed amen so he is a part
[1:21:37] of the curse when he said no reign or do
[1:21:40] he's a part of that right
[1:21:42] not only would everybody else not get
[1:21:44] any rain or do he wouldn't get any rain
[1:21:46] or do
[1:21:47] right but we all know what god did for
[1:21:49] life
[1:21:51] then in the spirit of god god led him
[1:21:54] and god led him down to a place that the
[1:21:57] third verse says
[1:21:58] get thee hence and turn the eastward to
[1:22:01] hide thyself by the brook cherry that is
[1:22:03] before jordan
[1:22:04] god sent ravens to feed him right
[1:22:07] right god sent the birds to feed him
[1:22:10] that's how much god wants is going to
[1:22:12] take care of his children if he has to
[1:22:14] call an
[1:22:14] animal or the or the animal life to come
[1:22:18] and sustain you
[1:22:19] to bless you in the middle of this
[1:22:21] crisis god will do it whatever he has to
[1:22:24] do
[1:22:24] of course the brook was still flowing
[1:22:28] had water in it but yet god called the
[1:22:30] raven to come and bring him food
[1:22:32] right praise the lord and she go down to
[1:22:34] the desert museum and get a ram to do
[1:22:36] that or
[1:22:37] call the javelina hallelujah no
[1:22:40] god did it all right there's the
[1:22:42] difference god is in control of every
[1:22:44] body line
[1:22:45] animal life human life and if we lose
[1:22:48] perspective of that friend then we've
[1:22:49] lost
[1:22:50] everything right because god that means
[1:22:52] that god's in control of you
[1:22:53] right so god was calling these ravens to
[1:22:55] come feed him but i want you to pay your
[1:22:57] attention to
[1:22:58] because in this curse in this crisis
[1:23:02] god is doing a miracle for elijah now he
[1:23:06] doesn't know it elijah doesn't
[1:23:08] understand it right because i mean
[1:23:10] trust me i'd rather go to golden corral
[1:23:12] than have a crow bring me my food
[1:23:15] i'd rather go to longhorn than have a
[1:23:17] then have a buzzer drop me
[1:23:18] drop me a mercel or two every once in a
[1:23:20] while so
[1:23:21] don't get me wrong he may not have known
[1:23:24] it but
[1:23:24] god has got elijah in a position that
[1:23:28] he's getting ready to do a tremendous
[1:23:30] miracle through him
[1:23:31] amen but for this miracle to happen
[1:23:34] you remember brother abraham talked
[1:23:36] about there's uh uh
[1:23:38] diseases and spirits that are harder
[1:23:40] than others
[1:23:41] right that that uh uh you know you say
[1:23:43] well this
[1:23:44] this might take a a spark of faith but
[1:23:47] you know this is going to take
[1:23:49] this doesn't just happen because you say
[1:23:51] you got faith
[1:23:52] right i mean this like epilepsy he said
[1:23:55] epilepsy was a hard spirit
[1:23:57] to get rid of to cast off see so
[1:24:01] god is getting ready in this great
[1:24:03] miracle god's getting ready to do for
[1:24:05] elijah
[1:24:07] he's got to prepare him for it he's got
[1:24:09] to get him in
[1:24:10] condition and that and
[1:24:13] look i think that's exactly what god's
[1:24:15] doing with the bride today
[1:24:18] i believe that's why god has his bride
[1:24:20] now
[1:24:21] you got to remember and i don't mean
[1:24:23] this derogatorily
[1:24:24] and i'm not putting anybody out or
[1:24:26] putting anybody in but there's people
[1:24:28] out there that say they're in the
[1:24:29] message
[1:24:30] and they're not in christ they say
[1:24:33] they're a believer in this message
[1:24:35] they follow brother branham but they
[1:24:37] have no relationship with jesus christ
[1:24:41] they're not a believer in the sense that
[1:24:43] they're a believer
[1:24:44] in their in their relationship with
[1:24:47] christ
[1:24:47] amen and if that is not there i don't
[1:24:50] care
[1:24:50] how many books you've read or how much
[1:24:52] quote you can quote
[1:24:54] if you're not there with jesus you're
[1:24:56] not there at all
[1:24:58] and that's what matters amen it's your
[1:25:01] relationship not with a message book
[1:25:03] but with christ amen amen so i believe
[1:25:06] that
[1:25:07] god is doing the exact same thing today
[1:25:10] now
[1:25:10] what is god doing for us here and
[1:25:13] bringing that bride together
[1:25:16] now this bride is not gathered in tucson
[1:25:19] it's not gathered in north carolina or
[1:25:21] wisconsin it's not gathered in china or
[1:25:23] russia or
[1:25:24] uh singapore it's international america
[1:25:28] this bride is around the world so what
[1:25:30] is god gathering her under
[1:25:32] he's got to be gathering her under the
[1:25:34] one auspice of jesus christ the word
[1:25:37] amen the shed blood of the innocent lamb
[1:25:40] like it was in
[1:25:41] egypt that delivered the people is the
[1:25:44] same thing that's going to cause this
[1:25:46] bride to leave this world one day
[1:25:48] in a rapture and god is bringing her
[1:25:50] together
[1:25:51] and conditioning her to get her ready
[1:25:54] and prepared for the time
[1:25:56] that the faith is needed for a body
[1:25:59] change
[1:26:01] a body change amen amen i think the
[1:26:03] culmination of that will be when we
[1:26:04] start seeing our loved ones appear
[1:26:06] before you
[1:26:07] when my mom and dad and my son show up
[1:26:10] when they're sitting on the front pew or
[1:26:12] they show up at the breakfast table or
[1:26:13] at my job one day
[1:26:15] there she is right hallelujah amen i'm
[1:26:17] not gonna have to conjure it up you're
[1:26:19] not gonna have to make it
[1:26:21] it'll be there and that's the
[1:26:22] culmination right
[1:26:24] if you're not there ready for that time
[1:26:26] you won't get it
[1:26:27] that's right amen amen if you're not
[1:26:30] ready for that time
[1:26:31] that unity of faith then you won't get
[1:26:34] it
[1:26:35] but if the preparation which to me is
[1:26:38] being done
[1:26:39] right now amen the bride in faith coming
[1:26:42] together
[1:26:42] under the auspice of christ the word and
[1:26:45] now when i say christ the word i mean
[1:26:47] the reveal word of the hour too
[1:26:48] of course the message i'm not trying to
[1:26:50] put that out
[1:26:52] when we're all coming together in that
[1:26:54] light in that condition god's preparing
[1:26:56] her
[1:26:57] for some great miracle that's about to
[1:27:00] take place amen
[1:27:01] praise god when the dead in christ rise
[1:27:04] we begin to sin we're here a minimum of
[1:27:05] 30 days and we do body change we're gone
[1:27:08] that's right praise god that's it and
[1:27:11] friend
[1:27:12] we know in type that there was a seven
[1:27:15] day period where in uh where uh
[1:27:18] noah went on the ark and there was no
[1:27:21] rain
[1:27:22] but no one else could be saved amen no
[1:27:25] one else could come in
[1:27:27] bang on the door no let us in we want to
[1:27:29] see around what kind of animals you got
[1:27:31] in there
[1:27:32] can't let you in god shut the door rain
[1:27:35] starts the judgment
[1:27:37] is beginning to hit in earnest yes noah
[1:27:40] let us in this is your aunt uncle
[1:27:42] sorry god shut the door yes i can't open
[1:27:46] it
[1:27:47] amen there's no lights there's no string
[1:27:49] god closed the door
[1:27:50] amen i did what god said do he prepared
[1:27:52] me we made preparation we built the ark
[1:27:55] and we came in when god said so
[1:27:57] he sent the animals in for us yeah
[1:27:59] that's right
[1:28:00] and then he shut the door when it was
[1:28:02] over god shut the door
[1:28:04] you say it was over yes amen it was over
[1:28:07] well there's still people out there yes
[1:28:09] but it was still over right
[1:28:11] there's people gonna be out there today
[1:28:13] but it's going to be over amen
[1:28:15] should it be people coming to the altar
[1:28:16] thinking they're getting saved when it's
[1:28:18] over
[1:28:19] hallelujah it'll be over because there's
[1:28:21] a period of time
[1:28:22] that we will still be here the bride
[1:28:24] will still be here for a period of time
[1:28:27] where no one else will be able to come
[1:28:30] in
[1:28:30] right amen now when is that time i don't
[1:28:33] know
[1:28:34] real man never said personally
[1:28:37] i believe it's going to be the time
[1:28:38] between the dead of christ rise and we
[1:28:40] see our loved ones appear and the time
[1:28:42] she goes home yes that's my opinion i i
[1:28:45] could be
[1:28:46] completely wrong you might have another
[1:28:47] opinion that's just fine uh i won't
[1:28:49] differ with you don't differ with me
[1:28:50] we'll love one another and it'll be okay
[1:28:52] that's my opinion that's right but i do
[1:28:55] know one thing
[1:28:56] it does exist and there will be a time
[1:29:00] it will be that period of time but what
[1:29:02] god's doing is preparing
[1:29:04] he was preparing elijah let's go back to
[1:29:06] this word
[1:29:07] uh cherith again look at god when he
[1:29:09] sends
[1:29:10] elijah down to the brook cherith right
[1:29:13] if you look at that word
[1:29:14] cherith the the meaning of the word
[1:29:17] cherith is cutting
[1:29:21] apparently there was still things in
[1:29:23] elijah's life that god had to get rid of
[1:29:27] that god had to purge him from that god
[1:29:30] had to do some cutting on elijah
[1:29:33] now maybe some of that cutting had to be
[1:29:35] the ravens coming
[1:29:37] the rain not coming being out by the
[1:29:40] brook
[1:29:40] we don't know the bible doesn't say but
[1:29:43] the brook
[1:29:44] cherith means cutting so what god is
[1:29:47] doing is
[1:29:48] cutting away anything that god
[1:29:51] that shouldn't be in moses life
[1:29:54] anything that moses shouldn't uh uh
[1:29:57] excuse me elijah shouldn't have been
[1:29:59] doing
[1:30:00] if it's anything elijah whatever it was
[1:30:03] god had to do
[1:30:04] god had to prepare elijah for this
[1:30:07] god there had to be something more in
[1:30:09] elijah to get him to this place
[1:30:12] than what he had and there's got to be
[1:30:15] more that comes into this bride
[1:30:17] through the revealed word that hasn't
[1:30:19] been
[1:30:20] before now that's the light on the other
[1:30:23] side of the wall
[1:30:24] somebody flipped it there's got to be
[1:30:26] something more
[1:30:27] see and that something more has got to
[1:30:30] come from
[1:30:31] the word through christ yeah who is the
[1:30:34] word
[1:30:34] amen right so he sends elijah down
[1:30:38] to cut on him a bit and when the brook
[1:30:41] ran
[1:30:41] dry god sent him where he sent him to
[1:30:45] zarephath to a widow woman
[1:30:47] amen now again i'm going to cut this a
[1:30:49] little short
[1:30:50] look at the word zaraphat the definition
[1:30:53] of the word zerophath means
[1:30:54] refining so once god has cut away
[1:30:59] that's when he does some refining now
[1:31:02] this may sound crude for him but i just
[1:31:04] got to give it to you because it wasn't
[1:31:05] a note i had and god just dropped it in
[1:31:07] but it's like a fingernail if you ever
[1:31:10] have a fingernail that you don't chew on
[1:31:13] that you actually uh you actually have
[1:31:16] fingernails that you groom
[1:31:18] what do you do to a fingernail you take
[1:31:20] something you cut it the excess off
[1:31:22] well that gets rid of the unnecessary
[1:31:25] part of your nail
[1:31:26] correct then what do you do you take a
[1:31:29] file and you start filing it and
[1:31:31] refining it down
[1:31:33] take away the sharp edges take away the
[1:31:35] jagged parts and
[1:31:37] and refining it to where when you go to
[1:31:39] scratch yourself you don't rip your face
[1:31:41] open
[1:31:43] you refine it well that's what god had
[1:31:45] to do to elijah
[1:31:47] he not only cut it away but then he come
[1:31:49] in and he took and he refined it right
[1:31:51] it's like a uh it's like one of brother
[1:31:53] brown's message
[1:31:54] you listen to a lot of brother brown's
[1:31:56] message my goodness you just take that
[1:31:59] absolute hide right off you
[1:32:00] right but then when you get to that and
[1:32:02] now if you stop right there you're going
[1:32:04] to be heidless
[1:32:05] but if you keep on going and you listen
[1:32:07] to the rest of it right
[1:32:09] then he puts that salve in there and he
[1:32:11] starts the bomb
[1:32:13] of healing and then he starts refining
[1:32:16] and then bringing it over
[1:32:17] and people's hearts become tender and
[1:32:20] they get to the place that they're
[1:32:21] receptive
[1:32:22] and when they're at the place of
[1:32:23] receptiveness then he can call a prayer
[1:32:25] line or something
[1:32:26] and people's faith is at a peak that god
[1:32:29] did miracles and wonders in that
[1:32:31] ministry amen
[1:32:32] amen because it was the faith
[1:32:35] i know the promise of the angel said not
[1:32:37] even cancer will stand before your
[1:32:39] prayer
[1:32:39] but it had to be faith because that's
[1:32:41] the bible
[1:32:42] right right even the promise of the
[1:32:45] angel
[1:32:45] could not leave the pages of this bible
[1:32:48] amen everything he told him and
[1:32:51] everything that happened
[1:32:52] had to be scriptural if you can't find
[1:32:56] it in the scripture there's something
[1:32:57] wrong
[1:32:58] right so the the point that we know that
[1:33:01] brings that healing
[1:33:02] is the faith amen it's got to be that
[1:33:05] level and that point of faith
[1:33:08] and that faith is what the people
[1:33:10] received and they got blessed by
[1:33:12] a lot of people got healed a lot of
[1:33:14] unbelievers got healed
[1:33:16] people that may have never followed the
[1:33:17] message or went to church again
[1:33:20] got healed amen but it was because of
[1:33:23] the simple faith that they had gotten
[1:33:25] being there in that atmosphere and in
[1:33:26] that presence
[1:33:28] that faith it's the same thing that we
[1:33:31] strive for
[1:33:32] every day but especially like we're here
[1:33:34] right now amen
[1:33:36] god had to cut on elijah a little bit he
[1:33:39] had to get
[1:33:40] elijah ready then he had to refine him
[1:33:43] and he had to bring him up to the place
[1:33:45] he cut off all the rough edges and all
[1:33:47] the points and
[1:33:48] and make him refine to the place that he
[1:33:51] was ready
[1:33:51] spiritually because after this
[1:33:54] of course he goes back to elijah and he
[1:33:57] calls the rain back down after three and
[1:33:59] a half years
[1:34:00] but after that it was the mount carmel
[1:34:03] showdown right now
[1:34:05] friend you're not going to have a mount
[1:34:07] carmel showdown unless you're
[1:34:08] prepared for it if you try to do a mount
[1:34:12] carmel showdown without
[1:34:13] spiritual preparation in your life you
[1:34:15] will be defeated right amen you will be
[1:34:18] destroyed you will come back pardon this
[1:34:21] expression but with your tail between
[1:34:23] your legs as a defeated person
[1:34:25] right but when you're prepared and god
[1:34:27] has
[1:34:28] cut god got you through the the
[1:34:30] preparation
[1:34:31] and and the building up and the cutting
[1:34:33] and the refining and your faith is at
[1:34:35] that place that you can call down heaven
[1:34:37] to destroy it all
[1:34:39] amen and then you gotta show down the
[1:34:41] name god will make
[1:34:42] himself known in your life praise god
[1:34:45] god is preparing us for a rapture friend
[1:34:47] amen the cutting the refining yes
[1:34:50] the word because it's not it's not it's
[1:34:53] brother madam didn't do it it's the word
[1:34:55] that does it amen
[1:34:56] it's not a minister pastor that does it
[1:34:58] it's the word that does it god's the one
[1:35:00] that does god's the one that brings that
[1:35:02] cutting god's one that brings that
[1:35:03] preparation
[1:35:04] and he had to prepare him for that he
[1:35:07] has to prepare us and get us to the
[1:35:08] place
[1:35:09] that we can receive that promise when it
[1:35:11] comes down upon us amen
[1:35:14] but look what happened he was so
[1:35:16] depleted
[1:35:17] after the mount carmel showdown and
[1:35:21] one woman he defeats 400 profits
[1:35:25] he has buckets and barrels and gallons
[1:35:28] of water
[1:35:28] licked up by the fire of god and all the
[1:35:31] altar and everything around it
[1:35:33] men cutting themselves like you know
[1:35:36] people
[1:35:36] try to do today right you know that's a
[1:35:39] sign of the devil right yes
[1:35:41] that cutting that's the devil you go
[1:35:43] there's places in the bible that tells
[1:35:45] you that's of the devil
[1:35:46] amen you see these young people out here
[1:35:48] today who try to cut themselves for
[1:35:50] relief that's a satanic
[1:35:52] element of the devil don't you do
[1:35:54] something like that that is ungodly amen
[1:35:57] these ungodly men up there cutting
[1:35:59] themselves
[1:36:00] and god sends that and licks up every
[1:36:02] bit of water every bit of wood
[1:36:04] every bit of stone everything that was
[1:36:06] there god the fire of god came and
[1:36:08] licked it up
[1:36:09] and one woman after he's done somebody
[1:36:11] turned it off again
[1:36:13] one woman after it's done
[1:36:16] threatens him threatens his life
[1:36:20] and he runs like a scared cat right
[1:36:23] like a rabbit with the coyotes on his
[1:36:26] tail
[1:36:28] runs and he goes underneath the juniper
[1:36:31] tree and he says god just kill me

[1:38:09] and an angel wakes him up and feeds him
[1:38:11] some cakes
[1:38:13] amen aren't you glad that god can
[1:38:15] strengthen you by an angel with some
[1:38:17] cakes
[1:38:18] or that god can strengthen you by an
[1:38:20] angel with some tapes
[1:38:21] no right amen that god could strengthen
[1:38:24] you by an angel with some tapes
[1:38:27] amen amen god's still doing the same
[1:38:30] thing today
[1:38:32] it continues to press you on and move
[1:38:34] you forward and
[1:38:35] bless you in the middle of all that's
[1:38:37] going on around us that's right it may
[1:38:39] look grim it may look dark
[1:38:43] me and my wife went out for dinner last
[1:38:45] night and i'm gonna say this
[1:38:47] and uh i i might i'll probably read this
[1:38:49] quote but i'm gonna leave it there
[1:38:52] but we went out to dinner last night and
[1:38:53] they had these some sayings on the wall
[1:38:55] and she sent one on the tablet some of
[1:38:57] them was really funny about the colgate
[1:38:59] thing
[1:38:59] but one of them was a cat that was
[1:39:02] pursed in a carrier
[1:39:04] and the door was shut and the cow was
[1:39:06] just sitting there looking at the door
[1:39:08] and the door was shut so it was just
[1:39:09] sitting there but the whole top of the
[1:39:11] carrier was gone
[1:39:13] there was no talk to the carrier but the
[1:39:15] cat was just sitting there
[1:39:16] and the saying was don't get so fixated
[1:39:19] on the problem that you don't see the
[1:39:20] obvious
[1:39:21] answer right you don't see the obvious
[1:39:24] escape people sometimes get so
[1:39:27] tunnel visioned and so blinded about the
[1:39:29] the problems they don't understand
[1:39:31] the way of escape right the solution
[1:39:35] that is obvious right there all the cat
[1:39:38] had to do was look up and he said he's
[1:39:39] not
[1:39:40] in a box the door's shut yes
[1:39:43] but the whole top's gone he doesn't get
[1:39:45] out of the boat
[1:39:46] amen he gets so fixated on that
[1:39:49] but all the other stuff goes to the side
[1:39:52] i mean you think about the three hebrew
[1:39:55] children
[1:39:56] yeah they were they were literally
[1:39:58] thrown in the fiery furnace
[1:40:00] right but in the middle of the fire god
[1:40:03] was there with them
[1:40:04] amen daniel was literally thrown in the
[1:40:08] lion's den
[1:40:10] but in the middle of the hungry lions
[1:40:12] god stayed their mouths
[1:40:14] amen said hi kitty kitty go lay down
[1:40:18] in the morning king all well daniel
[1:40:20] all's well okay
[1:40:23] right praise the lord the bride today
[1:40:26] all is well all is well
[1:40:30] i've heard the message shalom peace all
[1:40:32] is well amen
[1:40:34] praise the lord amen
[1:40:38] you got this one world thing is settling
[1:40:40] in
[1:40:41] all this taking place around us
[1:40:45] you know it reminds me i
[1:40:48] i meant to say this a couple weeks ago
[1:40:50] but i don't know if you knew this
[1:40:52] but current president trump actually
[1:40:56] declared publicly first president
[1:41:00] i know of that did this publicly most of
[1:41:03] them who belong to a domination even
[1:41:05] you know won't even say they're catholic
[1:41:06] or something actually publicly declared
[1:41:09] he is no longer i think it's
[1:41:10] presbyterian
[1:41:11] he now considers himself a
[1:41:14] non-denominational christian
[1:41:15] right right that's first president i
[1:41:18] ever known
[1:41:18] right you know he's not gonna be present
[1:41:21] much longer doesn't look like but
[1:41:23] he's the only president i've ever heard
[1:41:25] in my lifetime that declared themselves
[1:41:26] as a non-denominational christian
[1:41:29] no wonder they hate him so much right
[1:41:32] you know brother roger told me that they
[1:41:33] had south africa during this coverage
[1:41:35] coveted stuff completely locked down
[1:41:37] nobody in out could move
[1:41:38] breathe do anything and as soon as biden
[1:41:41] was declared winter
[1:41:42] they opened it up said everybody can
[1:41:44] come in everybody can go out it's all
[1:41:46] free do whatever you want
[1:41:48] now everything's fine you watch a lot of
[1:41:51] the news is going to die down here real
[1:41:52] quick too on that coveted stuff but
[1:41:54] anyway
[1:41:55] i call it the great masked caper of
[1:41:56] 2020.
[1:41:59] first seal uh don't get mad at me
[1:42:04] that's just my that's just my feeling
[1:42:07] opinion
[1:42:07] everybody has an opinion you're entitled
[1:42:09] to yours too that's okay
[1:42:11] maybe that's my opinion why did
[1:42:13] communism raise up
[1:42:15] over here in russia it just makes me
[1:42:17] sick at my stomach to hear all these
[1:42:19] preachers hollering about communism
[1:42:21] they don't even know what they're
[1:42:23] crowing about that's right
[1:42:25] communism listen now listen what's in
[1:42:28] our front doorstep here
[1:42:30] now remember so they cry socialism but
[1:42:32] that's just communist junior
[1:42:34] right he said they're no don't know what
[1:42:37] they're crying about that's right
[1:42:39] communism ain't nothing it's a tool
[1:42:42] brother brahman said communism is a tool
[1:42:45] in the hand of god
[1:42:46] to bring revenge upon the earth for the
[1:42:49] blood of the saints
[1:42:51] amen amen that's right i just thank god
[1:42:54] that
[1:42:55] bride we are not going to be here to
[1:42:57] witness that
[1:42:58] right amen when they have to seal their
[1:43:00] their testimony with their blood
[1:43:02] and after the church is taken away rome
[1:43:05] and the jews will make a covenant with
[1:43:07] one another of course i'm not going to
[1:43:08] read it all but
[1:43:09] later they break that covenant of course
[1:43:11] the pope does but
[1:43:12] rome and the jews make a covenant
[1:43:14] together
[1:43:16] the bible said they would with the holy
[1:43:18] people and now notice
[1:43:19] they'll make it because why the nation
[1:43:21] is going to be busted
[1:43:23] amen and he's saying going to be i say
[1:43:26] is
[1:43:26] yes how many trillions of dollars do you
[1:43:29] have to be in debt to be busted
[1:43:32] how many zeros is in a trillion dollars
[1:43:36] i can't even fathom it
[1:43:40] sometimes me and my wife go to taco bell
[1:43:42] because it's cheaper
[1:43:44] i can't even imagine a trillion dollars
[1:43:47] right how many tacos could you buy with
[1:43:50] a trillion dollars
[1:43:53] that would be a lot or in my case
[1:43:58] rib eyes that's a lot of money
[1:44:02] so the point is that how many trillions
[1:44:04] of dollars do you have to be in debt
[1:44:06] to be busted which we are as a nation
[1:44:10] amen especially especially the last 12
[1:44:12] years
[1:44:13] well we'll just say since 9 11 2001
[1:44:16] right yeah
[1:44:16] this nation has gone yeah
[1:44:20] or we'll just say up with the debt it is
[1:44:23] skyrocketing republican or democrat it
[1:44:26] is skyrocketed
[1:44:28] 20 some trillion dollars you look at the
[1:44:31] debt clock and it just flips
[1:44:34] it's amazing but 1963
[1:44:39] this nation is going to be busted this
[1:44:42] nation
[1:44:43] shall i declare this day this prophecy
[1:44:45] fulfilled this nation
[1:44:47] is busted amen like all the rest
[1:44:50] around the world no matter what they say
[1:44:52] they're all coming together
[1:44:55] and the rest of the world that's on the
[1:44:56] gold standard is busted too
[1:44:59] you know that if we're lit we are now
[1:45:01] living off the taxes
[1:45:03] for bills due 40 years from now and that
[1:45:06] was 1963
[1:45:07] wow if we took
[1:45:11] every single dollar that came in
[1:45:14] to the government around the country for
[1:45:17] the entire
[1:45:18] year it wouldn't even touch our debt wow
[1:45:21] oh man every dollar that came in
[1:45:24] wouldn't touch it right think about that
[1:45:27] it's gross domestic politic but i don't
[1:45:29] want
[1:45:29] you know that's all technical stuff this
[1:45:31] ain't dollars money
[1:45:33] wouldn't even touch it all the taxes
[1:45:35] everything that goes in
[1:45:36] wouldn't even touch it there's only one
[1:45:39] thing that can happen
[1:45:40] that's to call the currency pay off the
[1:45:42] bonds and they
[1:45:44] can do it wall street owns them and wall
[1:45:47] street is controlled by the jews
[1:45:50] the rest of it is controlled by the
[1:45:52] vatican now you know
[1:45:54] why after the bride is gone they will
[1:45:56] make a
[1:45:57] treaty with one another because one owns
[1:46:00] one side of it the other is on the other
[1:46:02] side of it
[1:46:03] that's right and well i bring this point
[1:46:04] again as i close here
[1:46:07] this pope has the highest approval
[1:46:10] rating amongst
[1:46:11] jews of any pope ever according to
[1:46:14] statistics
[1:46:16] the greatest approval rating amongst
[1:46:18] muslims
[1:46:19] jews christians
[1:46:22] nominals worldwide
[1:46:26] got a brand new catholic in the supreme
[1:46:28] court that's right got a brand new
[1:46:30] catholic in the
[1:46:32] oval office if the
[1:46:35] if the democrats get control of the
[1:46:37] senate a catholic will be the head of
[1:46:39] the senate
[1:46:41] ahead the speaker of the house is a
[1:46:43] catholic
[1:46:44] nancy pelosi who is third in the line of
[1:46:47] presidency if something happens to the
[1:46:48] top two
[1:46:49] right where are we at friend
[1:46:57] right we're at this place god is letting
[1:47:00] us know
[1:47:00] just like we read when god did this
[1:47:04] through moses he let him know and he let
[1:47:07] pharaoh know
[1:47:08] god spoke through moses and let pharaoh
[1:47:11] know
[1:47:11] this is going to happen to you pharaoh
[1:47:14] and this is
[1:47:15] this is what this is what god's not
[1:47:17] going to do
[1:47:19] you're going to be the recipients of
[1:47:21] every firstborn dying from man to beast
[1:47:24] but israel won't be touched amen not
[1:47:27] even a dog
[1:47:28] tongue wag praise the lord

[1:47:39] god's children god's continuing to bless
[1:47:44] his children
[1:47:45] in the middle of this crisis in the
[1:47:47] middle of this
[1:47:48] turmoil that's going on around us god is
[1:47:51] continuing to bless
[1:47:52] us amen in in in in every way

[1:48:20] i'm so glad god has provided the way
[1:48:24] for his children to be blessed

[1:48:29] surrounding and it is
[1:48:30] when the bible says it'd be darkness in
[1:48:33] the land and gross darkness to the
[1:48:34] people
[1:48:37] the grosser the darkness is the brighter
[1:48:39] the light shines
[1:48:40] right hallelujah you can look you can
[1:48:42] light a candle in this room
[1:48:44] and it won't look like much but at night
[1:48:46] time if you turn all the lights off and
[1:48:48] light a candle
[1:48:49] you could probably see all the walls
[1:48:50] right right it'll shine
[1:48:52] bright and as the darker it gets the
[1:48:54] brighter it's going to shine
[1:48:55] the brighter your light is going to
[1:48:57] shine praise god light shiny
[1:49:00] relinquish everything we're in god's
[1:49:02] preparing us

[1:49:44] my family or church whatever god always
[1:49:47] brings it out and blesses it always
[1:49:50] always happens sometimes god brings
[1:49:54] situations that you thought were
[1:49:56] unfallible to an end
[1:49:58] maybe that thing became a crutch in your
[1:50:00] life and god had to stop it
[1:50:03] that's some of the cutting that elijah
[1:50:04] had to go through sometimes
[1:50:07] god may take that from your life right
[1:50:10] but you take that and you move forward
[1:50:11] and let god refine you and bring you
[1:50:13] forth and

[1:50:16] become more like him
