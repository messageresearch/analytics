TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning Saints god bless you welcome to this beautiful day reach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I have you mother's days now you precious mothers out there on you godly mothers that raise your children and the nurture and admonition of God we celebrate this day for for that purpose although every day in my opinion should be a Mother's Day I believe brother Branham even said that and I think most of us would agree every day should be a Mother's Day but it's a day that we set aside in this country for a specific celebration of Mother's Day so happy Mother's Day to you all we love you appreciate you in my opinion that's what keeps the everything together to me the glue of a family as a mother so happy Mother's Day to you today and welcome to the live streaming service again looks like things are starting to loose up a little bit more with the restrictions and the stay-at-home orders so I will see where the Lord goes from here and what happens from this time I still haven't heard from the pastor of the church we went from Pete so just remember that in prayer so sings God's hands God's work he put us there so if we're moving on someplace else and he's got a place for us so I'm not too worried about it but would certainly like to get back to meeting together in person and miss y'all very much and hopefully it'll be very soon as you know we usually have a little trinket or something for the mothers on Mother's Day and the mothers to be even so we're not able to do that today but we love you let we want to let you know how much we really do love you and appreciate you being a part of our church sorry for things going a little bit late today but appreciate you patience and staying with us kind of one of the little things I had there I had sent that in the text was please stand by it just reminded me for a moment my grandmother not my mom but my grandmother my dad said when TV's first came out and they had a TV first one they got they had a lot of problems you know and also many times he would come up and there would go blank or something it's a technical difficulties please stand by and my dad said my mother my grandmother would get up and go stand next to the television because she said please stand by so this is what she would to so hopefully you stood by and hopefully about the grace of God would be a good service to be a blessing to you today so appreciate you being involved in being here with us today we had a few prayer requests to make you known of brother Dennis and text me and wanted us to continue and remember his wife Leah earned her doctor boss are still seeing patients and a couple of those patients have actually tested positive for kovin so please remember continue remember him and her in prayer the Lord would just continue to keep her protected and he also asked a request for peach the lady that he had asked several times the past four it has cancer we got to meet a couple of us brothers got to meet her when we help move some of her furniture and she's in pretty bad state she's going through chemo now but brother Dennis just asked if we could just continue to remember her in prayer who would also continue remember if you would I haven't had a recent update from brother Jewell for name last time I heard he was doing really well remember that in prayer also for brother Dana Thornhill teen you remember that unspoken request if you would and brother Johnny green of course I'm just trusting he's doing well as well I heard anything recently but we're just believing that the Lord is mindful of all of our needs if Tina remembers sister she Lee's brother Harlan and prayer and last week we had the request for sister Priscilla's brother Tony amen so we haven't done distrust in the Lord is mindful of every request and every need so remember those continue to hold them up before you before the Lord in your prayers the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much so we're just believing that if you have a request on your heart today just keep that on your heart now as we approach the author of the word and just ask him to move upon these requests and bless service today precious Jesus father again we're thankful to be here thankful to have the opportunity Lord even if we're not able to get together in the flesh Lord that we're able to get together in spirit and through this new mechanism this intelligence of man that's created a way to be able to stream or live stream and Lord we can kind of be together that way and I'm so thankful Lord that you helped us to be able to do that Lord we just thank you God for being with us and for helping us through the week and for blessing this day this beautiful day Lord here in Tucson Arizona and another Resurrection morning and then the beautiful Mother's Day god I pray that you bless all the precious godly mothers raising their children in the nurture and admonition of God or have raised them in the nurture and admonition of God in the heart of a mother Lord for their children believing in trusting that your hand is upon them and the Lord one day God when all the dust has settled and all the things are done and Lord as brother Brad said the Bibles are stacked the arms are folded Lord will come up to be with you Lord and we'll all be together as a grand family father we thank you God for each one Lord and I pray that your Holy Spirit would move upon every quest and every need Lord I believe probably Lord that hasn't been said but all the mothers have tremendous prayer requests on the hearts for their children and just believing God that your hand this upon them lord I pray that you continue to help the requests and the needs Lord that was mentioned Lord continue to help Leah and be with her and God just keep her safe and head your about Lord and protect her from all the germs diseases there are dr. boss Lord we just pray that you granted Lord and again brother Dennis requests for her friend pshh Lord if you don't intervene father it's a pretty dire situation with her this cancer God but knowing that you're still a miracle working God that would perform a miracle even for her right now and Lord every heart in every life and every need and every hand and whatever God may have been upon the hearts of your people today we pray that you would go to every house every living room every place Lord Word this is being played Lord God you would bless them and then your holy anointing would fall fresh even now Lord even where their City God let it move upon each one Lord and just draw us until you Lord make me feel your presence so strong God in the anointing Lord not just here but everywhere a god that anointing would just saturate every one of us and that you would reveal to us today in this word what you'd have us to know God I pray for the people Lord and pray God for our circumstances in situation Lord we believe God that you're mindful of us and that you have a place for us to worship and we're just bonding together believing in faith that you would show and reveal to us where that would be God according to your perfect wheel we thank you for all that you do for us Lord and we commit this remaining part of this service in your hands and pray that you would speak to us now as we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you I mean we want to go to revivals now and obviously I may have taken a shorter service or something during the week but I wanted to speak on a Mother's Day or give a little follow-up Mother's Day and something crossed my heart and I thought I would share it with you today and so I want to begin in the book of Samuel first samuel chapter one first samuel 1 and 1 i want to talk about hannah and Samuel today and I want to title this so the title that came on my heart for this today was three kinds of mothers three kinds of mothers seem strange but those of you recognize you know the brother branham's title of three types of believers or three kinds of believers they kind of cross my mind now it's sort of a play on words friends I'm not saying that there is absolutely three kinds but I kind of categorized in that way in myself and my mind and heart and looking out in the world and seeing the things that's going on you know there's from what I can see they're really are in my opinion there really are three types of mothers there's there's a good mother the bad mother and the godly mothers you got the good the bad the and the godly there's those that raise your kids and they're good parents and they're there for their children but they don't raise them in the nurture and admonition of God but they raise them to be successful and they raise them to be good people and honest and moral and things like that and that's good it's good that we have good mothers that raise their children that way and we have some that are bad some that just seem like their children are nuisance to them and don't really want to take care of them and don't want to help nurture them and the thing that really makes up a mother what a mother really is and the core of a mother the god-given nature of a mother they just are so lost in the the spirit of the world or the spirit of Satan whatever it is that they just they just seem to lose or don't have that that really God given nature mothering nature although it's still there because I believe it's there God created the woman being separated the feminist part put it in the woman and making me help her I help meet for Adam and you know that was the beginning and that that part of who God is he put into that woman and you see that God Himself is that type of nurturing and and every attribute that you see of that it is in him as well but it seems to void in in a lot of women too where they just they're just not good they're not good mothers sometimes they're caught up in drugs or alcohol or righteous living and and they seem to think that their own pleasure and their own goodness or whatever they want to do is more important than their children and raising their children right I mean the nurture and admonition of God yes but just raising their children right so and then you've got the godly mothers you got the mothers that that truly are raising their kids and the nurture and admonition of God and they love their children they want their children to be successful in and to be godly children and they want to make sure that they get the holy ghost and they want to make sure that when this is all over and the dust is settled in them and we're on the other side that we're all together and we're together with our children and with our families and and all those things it's it's very important to the heart of a godly mother it's it's real important to understand that that that there are those today and it seems to be getting fewer that really take the time and the effort and they love their children even more than their own bodies because the children came from their bodies and and that they love them but I want to get it and want to get into this scripture reading before it gets kind of gets past us here but let's look at First Samuel chapter 1 and I'll probably know the story of Hannah will be too long but just just the thought that came on my heart of what a real mother what a real godly mother representation of the scripture now look at this first samuel chapter 1 verse 1 now a pardon on some of these words i might butcher them a little bit but we'll do the best you can now there was a certain man of raynathan zopim of mount ephraim and his name was Al Qaeda and the son he was the son of Jarrow hem the son of Allah who the son of tobu and the son of zuf and an ephah might be for a night and he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah the name of the other was Opena and Penna had children but hannah had no children and this man went up out of his City yearly to yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were there and when the time was that Elkin al keine offered he gave to pen a pen on his wife and all her sons and her daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord her womb now think of that it's hard to understand sometimes or fathom the Lord's will and why God does certain things the way does them but look at the result we might not understand that we don't have to understand it we're not we're not required to understand it we're just required to believe it and trust God but in this it's hard to understand at this time of course at this time it was it was a reproach for a woman not to have children it was a reproach it was considered a curse of God for a woman not to have a baby you think this woman was bad or something or of a bad character of a bad family or something and curses upon them and God shut up their womb and it was a curse man unfortunately today it seems almost like to some women it's a curse to have a child but in this day it was a curse for them not to have children and God according to the scripture God purposely shut up Hannah's wound shut her wound so that she would not have any children and he gave to Hannah Levi who gave to Hannah a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her wound and her adversary also look at the reproach now her adversary also provoked her sword that's to make her angry to get her upset for to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her wound see this woman was bullying her and was making her mad and was and was provoking her to the point of anger because the Lord had shut up her womb and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat so Hannah's now provoked to the point that she's weeping I would say bitterly although I don't mean to add a description but it says she wept I would imagine bitterly at this point because she did not eat so she's fasting she's fasting now and she's she's stopping to eat but I'll come Oh kind of excuse me her husband to her then said O'Connor to her Hannah why weepest thou and ye this down not and why is thy heart grieved and not i better to be than ten sons and that's true and i'm sure he was very good to her but it's not the same thing it wasn't a substitute having a wonderful husband it was a great thing imagined for him of course but it's not the same thing it's not a substitute of being able to give that husband some children some sons and daughters so it wasn't quite the same thing but he's like ever not better than ten sons so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by post of the temple of the Lord and and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wet sore and she vowed a vow think of this now she vowed about and said Oh Lord of Hosts if thou will indeed look on the affliction of might of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but will give unto thy handmaid a man-child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head now look God has caused this woman's wound this wonderful pure woman this righteous woman who L kind of loved desperately shut up her womb purposely to get her to this place of desperation hannah has come to a place of desperation because the nurturing part of the woman in her just wanted a child so bad her body her womb ur her her breast longed to have a child and and she was so desperate that she began to fast and pray and seek God and and promise God God if you'll give me a child if you'll give me a man child I'll turn him over to you and you can use him he'll be yours all the days of his life I'll give him unto you and a note and no razor become a his head so look at the results see if we don't always understand why God does things the way he does them why and when and how you know that's why we're not to question God sometimes we want to know why and it's not us to know why sometimes we want to you know say God I think he could have been better this way or I would appreciated it better but God knows and and Hannah had gotten to such a desperation fasting praying asking desperate for a man-child that she would give him back to the Lord all the days of his life no God was using Ana he was giving her because God uses the righteousness I mean he doesn't use the devil women he uses a righteous woman and this was a righteous woman and this woman was thinking why am i cursed like this being a good person I'm a righteous person why am I so cursed but see she wasn't cursed God was using it for the better game and you know we look at those things and we don't understand them and we think why is this the way it is and I do what I'm supposed to do and I live the life was supposed to live and be the first I'm supposed to be and and and I feel like I'm a good person a godly person I love the Lord and yet this happened or this happened you know God puts us on paths he puts us on road said that he desires for us to go down but God doesn't always intend for us to continuously for the rest of our lives go down to one specific Road he may get us to that down that road and when it comes to a time to take a left and it's time to take a left and then he'll put people in our lives he'll cause things to happen to make sure that we turn to the left and get off that road because that road has come to an end in our lives it was good the way it was but if God were to come let's just take him if God were to come what I'm trying to say if God were to come to him God would have come to you and say Hannah I want to come out of your womb one of the greatest men to ever live a man that I'm gonna put in my Hall of Fame of faith Hebrews 11 a man that's going to be a prophet that's going to be a judge and to his people he's going to be a godly man and he's only gonna follow me and speak my words and say I'm going to use you Hanna to do that but you have to go through this this this this and this to get to that point do you think Hanna would have said okay Lord be it unto me that's fine with me Lord I'll suffer the reproach I'll put up with the with the naysayers and and and I'll and I'll put up with because I want to do your will do you think Hannah would have chose that would you have would you choose that if nobody's gonna say I'm gonna do this and this is what I want but this is what's gonna happen you'd say yes Lord that's fine but then when we don't understand or we try to but we can't figure out Lord why is this going on don't worry about it don't don't fret over it say Lord there's got to be a reason why this has happened there's got to be a reason why you caused me to have to turn left or right or go a different direction or do a different thing there's got to be a reason and God and this was God's reason for Hannah God shut her womb up so she would get so desperate that she would bring forth to Samuel and turn him over to God that Samuel would become the man that he'd become I believe if Hannah had the choice ahead of time and God were to come and explain it to her she would have chose yes that's fine Lord be it unto me I believe any of us would do that but we don't always know that God's ways are mysterious his ways are above our ways his thinking is above our thinking he works and operates in mysterious ways his wonders to perform so who are we to say well this is in Hannah's life and God was using that mother nature in her that motherly a part of her to to want her to get to that place of desperation when she got to that place of desperation then God could use her and and she said I want to do this and and then of course there comes Samuel because God wanted to use her to do that remember God doesn't do that to the ungodly God not God's not operating in the ungodly bad mothers or or maybe even good mothers he's operating in those godly mothers and those mothers that want the best for their children in accordance to the word into God's will so let's move on now she got to that place of desperation she's offered a child to God and he came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord 12 first now that Eli marked her mouth he couldn't hear her now Hannah's she spoken her heart only a spoke in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she was drunk and Eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee and Hannah answered and said no my lord I am a woman of son of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord and that's when you get results friend even that's when the results come count not by an handmaid for a daughter of Belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto in Elan answered and said go in peace and the God of Israel grant thee by petition that thou that has asked of him and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad so she didn't she had faith she was she was sad she got in desperation she fasted she prayed she sought the Lord she trusted the Lord heard her and was answering her prayer that was obviously confirmed by Eli telling her that the Lord answered and grant your request and now she's living in faith she's living in faith I know that we're talking about mothers and I know that we're talking about Hannah as a mother and God using that mother nature in her to bring about the of Samuel in in the world in their lives that day maybe in the world continually we go back and we had Samuel we can read it's just phenomenal what God does but now she's living by faith think about it she's not pregnant yet she's not conceived she's not showing she has no doctor to go and and do a pregnancy test but she's no longer sad why is she no longer said because she's got faith she's believing that what she cried out to God for and fasted and prayed in a desperation and Uihlein confirmed to her the Lord grant to you your request she believed was going to happen now let's see even though we're talking about mothers it's it's quite a story to understand her or not not really a story but but our lives and this is a microcosm of our lives and and how we should prepare an act and do before the Lord when it's all said and done and we've gone to the Lord we fasted we prayed we asked God then we look to God for answer we look to God to move we look to God for for either telling us yes or no whatever the entrance of the question is but we have faith then we don't continue to operate in desperation or continue to operate I'm not saying it's wrong you to do but what I'm saying is there's faith there that says I believe God heard my request and the answers on the way period that's it so now Hannah's no more sad because she believes she's no more sad and they rose up early in the in the morning early and worship before the Lord and returned and came back to their house to Rhema and Alcott Elkanah knew and his wife and the Lord remembered her praise the Lord faith brings results I believe God had answered a request but faith brings results we believe that God that that she that she believed what she said was going to happen let's just read the rest of the story can we do that was just a few more verses here 20th verse wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived that she bear his son and called his name Samuel saying because I have asked him of the Lord and the mount al-qaida and all his house went up to offering to the Lord the yearly sacrifice in his vow but Hannah went not up for she said unto her husband I will not go up until the child be weaned and then I will bring him that he may appear before the Lord and there abide forever now she's telling al Qaeda that we know spiritually for the first time the father of the son she's telling him for the first time that we know of scripturally that she's gonna take Samuel and she's going to give him to the Lord to the temple there with Eli for good he's not coming home he's going there for good now again the heart of a mother my that's just but but the heart of a mother for the goodness of God and the work of the Lord you can think about Moses mother doing the same thing and how many others that do that and they do it out of self-sacrifice but the greater love is to the Lord their mother nature yes the the nature they have in them to be a mother is powerful probably one of the most powerful forces in humanity in my opinion you just think for a moment - in my opinion I don't believe that there's any more prayer that prevails before God then the fervent righteous prayer of a godly mother those prayers still if you had a mother that prayed for you and she's gone on those prayers still prevail before God can you imagine the heart of a godly coming before the Lord in prayer and desperation fervently praying for their child I just don't see any more prayer prevailing before God any more if you think about the woman and that was in the scripture several places but the woman Jesus called a dog she said yeah but the dog eater the crumbs she had to Humble herself so her child could be healed her child could be well she humbled herself to even be called a dog and God honored her faith God blessed it because in her was to be a mother even though he approached him wrongly and wasn't cheating come for her he come for the house of Israel children of house of Israel and she wasn't she was a Gentile but God said be it unto you she got what she wanted because it prevailed before God now Ana is just now telling her husband can you imagine I mean when I was rereading this the other day getting this prepared oh if what about wife had done this the sun's gonna be born and we're gonna take him over here we're leavin there that would have been tough now that would have been a rough one for me but that's exactly what she did and now she's telling him she said that he may appear before the Lord and there abide forever now kinda her husband said unto her do what seemeth the good a man that's wonderful tarry until thou have waned him only the Lord established his word so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one F of flour and a with three bullocks and a one fo flour and a bottle of wine and brought him onto the unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh and the child was young and they slew a bollocking brought the child to Eli and she said o my Lord is thy soul liveth my lord I am the woman that stood by the year praying unto the Lord for this child I prayed and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him therefore also I have lent him to see this for the lead gift to the Catholics get the Lynn from I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord and he worshiped the Lord there now think of the sacrifice that she made she finally got a son and she did not have a promise of getting any other children there was no request there was no promise of God that God was going to give her any more children this may have been her only child but she was so desperate and she loved the Lord so much she was willing to offer this child to the Lord and say God here he's yours for service to you use him as you will drawing up and and and and bring him forth to be a mighty soldier for you and that's exactly what Samuel did now Hannah did not look after it that's not it's in the scripture but not in our reading we'll just quit the reading there but but if you read on you'll find out that after God performed what he was performing to bring about Sabbath Samuel into the world through hannah and elkanah think about after he did that then God opened her wound she had three more sons and two more daughters I believe it was she had five more children after that so she was no more barren even after samuel was born see ones once god has got his purpose fulfilled then she moved on life as normal it just continued on after that because God had blessed her and brought her to that point now I want to read you this this one quote that kind of struck me is as I was looking at this and it is from desperations in September 1st 1963 ham a barren woman in the Bible she wanted a son and she got to fasting for him think about this now this is of course the heart of a mother but think about this as also the things that you desire before the Lord and for your children maybe your children aren't serving the Lord maybe the army haven't give their heart floor maybe they've gone astray or something but remember this that prayer that fervent prayer before the Lord prevails much in my opinion probably prevails as much more than any other prayer fervently burning passionately that's what fervent means before the Lord and and remembered that desperation she wanted a son as she went to fasting for him and she fasted and prayed until evening until even the priest at the temple thought she was drunk she was in such desperation think about my she was in such desperation the priest thought she was drunk with the rest of the women watching what kind of a bonnet the other one had to wear and you know what how it goes and the other ones seeing what kind of clothes they had on and talking about the things and going on on the farm but not him she stepped right through the whole crowd and went to the altar she had been fasting she wanted her reproach taken away what a difference it is today it's almost a reproach to have a child then it was a reproach not to have a child she got her her needs and she never noticed the dignity of the temple she never noticed the dignified priests as they walked down she was in such distress till their tears rolling down her cheeks she was crying in desperation oh lord give me that son and she did that and God honored that to bring her to the place that Samuel could be born nowadays you got almost anything that goes you know even brother Branham talked about and I don't know that it was prophetic I didn't hear brother madam say thus saith the Lord but you know he made statements like she'll show mother a dog or a cat or something and you think 5060 years ago what that was like but think about what you see going on today I've never seen the like of my life Brendan just nothing in the world wrong with you having a pet there's nothing in the world having a dog or a cat or whatever but look at the way that's done today there's they're sitting at the dinner table they're they're going into the grocery stores and the restaurants with them and it's service animals fine seeing-eye dogs fine but the dogs of this just people I see bumper stickers now Arden them little magnets or something on the back my grandchildren have four paws I I'm sorry but that's just a disgrace to me that's more I want to get one that says my grandchildren have two feet and ten toes I saw the news the other day they're actually having a dog's mom day what is that how many human women have you seen birth dogs but see it's in them that they're mothering something they treat him like like human beings PETA folks they're animals I we've had we've had pets that I've loved dearly but never treat them like a human they weren't human I believe I believe that all that we love is gonna be there I believe they're gonna be there but we didn't treat them like humans that they weren't like our children we didn't clothe them and put mittens on her feet and honestly the dogs are probably miserable like that they probably hate it I love the affection but you've never seen the like the way it is today it's just it's just going crazy how much it's it's happened that way with the dogs but it's it's kind of prophetic see because it's gotten to the place that they that they got a mother something they got a mother something you got a lot the reproach that brings sometimes today and and women that don't want to have children the hound children you know one of the probably one of the greatest babysitter's or mothers there is being used today is a TV or a video game I go into restaurants and it a little kid sitting there watching a cartoon or playing a little game or something at the table I know I'm old-fashioned I'm old-school but you took your hat off and you said respectfully you didn't sit there watching a movie or a game but that's become the babysitter's that's become the mother to these children how dare the women allow Hollywood to be their mothers their children's mother but that's what it's gotten to be and that's what's got to be bad mothers people that raise their children and what he expects gonna happen what he expects gonna take place when this when this is how these children are being raised and you see each generation is more reprobate than the other each generation is worse than the one before it people don't want to admit it they sell a while you know it was it was like that in our day no it wasn't it was not that way in our day if the way things are now wasn't that way in my day it's changed so drastically but the true godly mothers still stand and they should be honored they should be respected there's because there's the good and the bad you think about the bad ones think about how bad this is in Revelation chapter 17 I mean outside of the over 50 million human lives that have been murdered and destroyed as a result of the legalization of abortion and women doing what they shouldn't to abort least you to murder these children don't want to have the child so bad they're willing to kill them I mean people go crazy over murders all the time and rightfully so but half this you don't live tonight a highbrow when you hear about abortions government funded abortions it's just it's the murder of children is just it's sad women having to buy books to be a mother go to the book store and and there's books how to be a mother I tell you the best book to learn how to how to be a mother this one right here this Bible is the best book you can read to try to find out how to be a good mother and raise your children in the nurture and admonition of God that's how you become a big a good mother you just pray and ask God will eat you it's it's it's in them to do it's not in the library it's not in the bookstore god it's God's in a given right to a woman to be a mother to know how to raise her children right and to be a mother to those children it's in them to do but in this horribleness of nature revelation 17 you know there came out one of the seven angels which had the seven vials talked to me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the judgment of the great that's a woman of course that sitteth upon many waters that's a lot of people with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication of course fornication ones she's an illegitimate woman so a or so of course she's gonna be committing fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit of the lewdness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy which have yet seven heads ten horns of course we know that's blasphemous names denomination names and the woman was arrayed in purple scarlet color decked with gold precious stones pearls having a golden cup owner and hadn't followed the abominations and filthiness of her fornication remember she's a she's a she's a an illegitimate woman she's prostituting herself with any and all oh yes she's beautiful oh she's decked out in the scarlet color gold precious pearls having a golden cup in her hand but it's the filthiness an abomination horrible filthiness of this woman and upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth well no wonder she's the mother of harlots look at what she is and her children come forth that's their example what do you think they're gonna be how do you think they're gonna be race what kind of people do you think are gonna come from a mother like that when she of herself is illegitimate what do you think her children are gonna be what do you think her daughters are gonna be they're following all the same lines they're being the same type of way because their mother is that way that's the importance of understanding how how much a mother means to the raising of children the father's there he's a nice disciplinarian and all but you know what most of the time now I know it's different sometimes in some families and some families are broke up and one parent home and stuff but most of the time when you got children and they bump their head or they scratch their knee what do they go they climb up mother as fast as they can I mean they'll love you to death but when they scrape their knee they're going straight to mother I could grab them all along but they don't want me they want mama they're gonna if I pick them up they're gonna bellow louder than they did before why because I'm not mama they won't mama mom was the one that they can crawl into their arms and and hold up to their bosom and that's the love and the nurture and the and that comes from that mother and from that mother nature you think about again and going back back to Hannah and how she was she would have to go year after year after year to see her son there but what godly mother doesn't want their child I mean success in the world is fine riches wealth doctors whatever that's fine that's nice there's nothing wrong with being a successful person that's great a mother a family should want their children the mom and dad should want their children to be successful and to be prosperous and to be blessed but what more important thing is there them for that child to serve the Lord and to live for God to be born again and the Holy Ghost field and dedicating and consecrating their lives to the Lord you know you can do you can be successful and still serve the Lord you can still have a nice job and serve the public and serve the Lord God's hands in all of it if if it's by his children is by his chosen his hand is upon it and his hand is upon it then the thing that we that we desire the most is to make sure that in her desires to make sure that they're dedicated to the Lord and that then that they had put their feet on the right path and that's that that's what their their job their duty is I think about my own family and I think about my own life and I've done I would say I've done fairly well today I thought about my mom quite a bit but I haven't shed a tear yet fortunately my son's here and my daughter and son-in-law and grandchildren are coming over and I have my wife and I have people around me to help me remember the best things of good times but you know I I think I've mentioned you know brother Ram talked about his dad and his bad dad being big and having muscles and carrying 200-pound logs or sacks or whatever every charm and things like that and thought man that man has just built him he's a towering he's a pillar he'll never decay or go away and but of course they come the time where his dad did dad decayed his dad fade away and his dad passed away and I can actually over all the time and everything they could gone and I'd almost just got to the place that I felt that way about my mom I didn't even get really serious when when you know they were telling me that you know back he says you know she was doing bad and she was going downhill and I thought while his mom you know she's she's gonna bounce back she's gonna come back even when I was there I felt like when I saw her there laying it I thought why does she just she's just gonna you know have a nice sleep tonight and I'll see her tomorrow and but you know it was the Lord's choice the next morning to take her and I just didn't think that would ever happen it it almost shocked me without being shocking cuz I looked at my mom that way thought she would be here for forever but it's a spiritualism commune with the dead and I can't call my mom on that phone anymore and wish her a Happy Mother's Day today but I know she knows I love her mister and I think it should be that way with all of us whether we have them with us still or not if you do take every advantage you have first Mother's Day in my life I've ever had without my mom take every advantage you have of spending the time and showing them how much you love them and appreciate them especially those godly mothers that put your feet on the right path and showed you the right way and took you to church and read you the Bible and made their home a place where the Holy Spirit could come and be an influence to children and bring them to that place of knowledge they're to be revered respected loved it's hard to put into words sometimes but I believe that's just a small port of portion of what it really does mean and what it really is it's harder today it's very hard raising children it's a mother's job as 24/7 365 never ends never stops hardest job you go without sleep you go about food you have a baby hanging on you all the time or nursing on you or something it's it's that something I'll never know or experience but I can only imagine how wonderful it is to have the opportunity to be able to raise children and to raise those children unto the Lord in the nurture and admonition of God I miss my mom very dearly and I trust that y'all spend the time that you can today letting your mother know how much you love them and how much you appreciate them one day the Lord tarries their flower will fade but while we're here and while we have the chance we honor them and love them again I believe that those prayers even if your mom has gone those prayers are still prevailing before the Lord for you the thing that helps and keeps us so remember them love them remember and love even that part of God who he is feminist part of the Lord who he is and that part that he shows to us and that motherhood and nurturing that he gives to us it's all a part of the same come from the same gun because he is the same so just remember that and keep it in your heart god bless you for being here today and for listening didn't want to be too long today but I wanted to say something to honor the mothers the good mothers are good and that's fine and that's nice and the world needs them and the world means those people to raise and become doctors and and whatever you know mechanics and think doctors today because of the medical field and everything is going on but but all the things you raised are true it's good to have a good mother learn ethics and morals and hard work and that's all very important but my when when it comes to the time that that that godly mother that one that is raising their children in the nurture and admonition of God it's very important that we understand and recognize how important that is so wish we were with you today but we celebrate together with you and just trust in the Lord bless you mighty couldn't even had a meal today together but we will again very soon I will keep you updated and posted me and brother Roger has some things we've been thinking on praying about and looking to and seeing maybe what the Lord might do next so just trusting them to you keep us in your prayers and then the Lord help and bless you and just remember that we do what we can to be a help for each one of you and to the glory of the Lord so let's bow our heads for prayer now as as we get ready to dismiss Lord Jesus father I'm so thankful God that you've blessed us with godly mother's words can't even express Lord what it means to us to have had a godly mother and to and to give you the thanks Lord and the representation we see in this little story ever met about Hannah and Lord how you moved in her life and how her desperation brought her to the point that you're able to bring Samuel for is one of the greatest men a menu even a man you even put into your Hall of Fame of faith in Hebrews 11 a great man Lord had came through this precious humble woman and Lord I'm so thankful God Lord of me certainly can't claim to or attain to any kind of Samuel Lord but I'm thankful to have had a godly mother that raised me in the nurture and admonition of God and put my feet on the path of righteousness and continued to press forward Lord I know her prayers for me continue to prevail before you even today lord I love her so much and Lord I'm so thankful God that you give us this time is this commercialization time that we have in this country but God I do believe it's a very important time that we take to to celebrate and honor these wonderful godly mothers that we have today Lord they seem to be in short supply more than they used to be but God we know that they're still here and as we come to this endtime still bringing forth children in the nurture and admonition of God for your glory and honor honor them lord I pray today and may your hand be upon and bless them we thank you God for all that you do for us and give to us and we just give you glory and praise and honor thank you Lord for that the nature of the nurture that you have as that mother nature in you Lord to share with us so many people in the world today say mother nature they don't realize they're talking about you but Lord we want to thank you God because we know Lord will just give you glory and honor praise Lord may you bless the people god bless them through the week we commit them to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now I got a before we close go here I got a flyer in the mail from the Living Word Church up and living board fellowship I think it is but is for a northern northern Arizona family camp they're doing at the end of July July 22nd through the 26th carpenter families really in taking care of this they're gonna have services seven o'clock every night Thursday Friday Saturday night at 7:00 and Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m. dinner will be provided Thursday Friday Saturday and lunch on Sunday there RV hookups and there's dorms to stay in and things like that if you want to do that activities during the day and all so if you want to think you want to be a part of that notice more than two months away but I wanted to let you know about that so if you want to plan I think being in northern Arizona and the end of July out of Tucson when it's 110 might not be a horrible idea but I'm sure they have don't have Luther ministering our but that's okay as long as God's ministering that's all that matters but if you'd like to go and you want some more details or something you can contact me let me know and be happy to share that with you so appreciate you love you today again we'll be in contact during the week with the what the furthest of the Lord is going forward as we as this government things starts loosening up and all just remember each one in prayer just trust God's keeping us and blessing us and God bless you through the week god bless you
