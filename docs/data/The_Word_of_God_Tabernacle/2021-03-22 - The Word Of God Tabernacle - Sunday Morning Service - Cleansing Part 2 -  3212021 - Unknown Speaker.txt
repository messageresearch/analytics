yes um you [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] let's sing that again [Music] good morning god bless you all welcome to the house of the lord amen i believe jesus wherever we go in his name that's where he'll be this amen heavenly amen dear god lord we're without words to be able to gather in your presence yes your love that's brought us here thank you father your love that's forgiven us of our sins and it's your love that keeps us day by day lord dear lord you abundantly bless us with your holy presence you keep us from all evil and lord we ask you to fill us with your spirit more and more as we're just consumed in the blackness and the darkness of this day satan is pouring out his his evil his devils are just trying to upset the bride at every turn he doesn't want that bride to be made perfect yes into a masterpiece but we know lord god that you will have a masterpiece yes because you're the almighty god you're the one that's perfect in knowledge and lord you you saw from the beginning of time that she would be perfect and and complete the lord we just surrender our heart we surrender our being and lord we ask that you just make us a better person after we leave this service today may we receive revelation and may we receive more power of the holy ghost withstand in this evil day doing all to stand and lord just bless the service bless the pastor give him that that wisdom that he needs to just bring you a word for we know it's not man's word we didn't come here to receive anything from man we came to you yes granted just yes and you know what we have so we surrender our being to you and we ask you to bless every part of this service and everyone here in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen let's turn over to psalm number 12. [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we shall oh [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen praise you lord jesus thank you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] thank you jesus one day soon amen yes i'll just go ahead and read over the prayer requests i didn't see him in the back but i didn't have it out there for very long so i'll read one from sister no i'm the normal here she says that she needs a healing touch and also also is asking to agree with her in prayer for her friend um a drug dealer neighborhood to move away i'm assuming for the problem to move away from okay so i definitely want to remember that for the people to move on yes exactly yes okay definitely amen anyone else have a prayer request they'd like to make known yes so i just kind of wanted to give everybody an update um the lawyer submitted the response to the summons and even though we have until april 2nd i didn't realize that being rural arkansas they don't do anything electronic so the only electronic that they do do is facts so he told me to check back with him next thursday because i'm of course right if they don't receive the response then we lose by default so um he said to check back with him next thursday and he said that if we don't see it in the court system then he'll fax it over but i think that's what's causing the most anxiety um my dad's not doing real well so this is really really affecting him so if you could please just i'll keep it in prayer that everything just goes smooth with it and my dad's nerves will calm down i'm bringing up derek again um wednesday he has a meeting his um he was told he had until april 5th and then they cut it back to march 28th that he has to be out of the mental health facility halfway house between the hospital and the community it's his drugs he's got some kind of adrenal thing where it messes up up really bad and and he can't hardly think he's adhd and he you know he you know so um if so all these problems that he has as a result of all that and and the reason i'm bringing him up is because on wednesday um there's gonna be i'm on the care team so i'll be meeting with him and derek asked me specifically a couple days ago will i please be there because he knows that his life is on the line right now if they put him away in that mental institution as a ward of the state it's over i don't even think he can have his ukulele that he's learning to play because it might because of the fear of self-harm and somebody else might pick it up and harm themselves who does have that but he doesn't have any self-harm fantasies you know any more than the rest of us ever have but um he's just you know it's it'll be the end of the line for him he was so um the only thing is i can't find a place nobody will take him in they don't have an extra bed he can't couch surf anywhere he can't there's no place for him to go nobody will rent in because his mother refuses to pay the eviction of 2000 it isn't that she just refuses she doesn't have the money she gets a thousand dollars a month to live on plus food stamps and and so and she still can't get her car out hot so i'm just if anybody if you know of anybody that might have a a spare couch i i got the i so we just need that in prayer you know for to help i'm going to go to them and ask them i'm gonna go see if i can buy a trailer pay a hundred dollars a month off of it and so he'll have a place to live and because he'll pay that he's desperate he he will stand on his head and and you know shake it out of his pockets to pay for that and so you know um so i'm going to go look for a trailer today and if any of you all know of what somebody's got a little trailer to sell my car will pull 3 500 pounds and so i could load you know so i get him a little place out here i've seen him for as low as almost 200. i'm not going to go on anymore i could but i'm not going to um i just he needs a place to live so they have some place to release him too and if he's got his own little trailer then nobody can say no you can't rent here because you have an eviction and i can find somebody that's got a driveway or something that they're renting out and and you know his name was derek right derek right i mean i can even find a vacation place you know that he could stay for a couple weeks until the death settles you know so i need somebody to help me to get this thing built and to um that's got any kind of carpentry skills i'm going to have um ask try house if they because i know he's building up there so i know he's got outlets and stuff going into the yard so we could pull that thing up there and slam that thing together you know in a couple days and you know if it's just a shell and you can throw a mattress down on the floor that'd be really good you know at least you'd have a place to go and then we could do the finish up finish work later but anybody that could um put in any kind of you know skills or anything and come and help it's just a you know so you know like a like a a seven by like a seven by nine or something trailer um that yeah we can go into more details later we want to talk this time carried away i just carried this for so long i'm just so into it then i'm sorry so i'm going to remember to go with that yeah sorry anyone else this morning and then for those of you streaming again if you want to just text us or text brother ben if you have any uh prayer requests uh needs that you want to make mention to the church body here uh let's just stand as we go to the lord yes brother remember continue remember sister shelia and brother dennis is at home helping with his wife and he said he's having pain a lot of pains back today heavenly father lord jesus we come to you this beautiful morning the sun out shining more jesus knowing that the true son is also shining on us lord we are needy people as you know lord jesus each and every one of us have little things to big things lord that we don't mention every single day but maybe in our hearts to you and those few that were mentioned today lord sister julie's situation uh such a matisse's situation with derek and our precious brother dennis lord jesus taking care of his wife as a good husband is supposed to lord we ask that you move on these situations lord and within this service today anointing to each and every one of us our hearts and ears to hear and receive what you would have for us and that you would guide the rest of this um song service as well lord jesus may remove any hindering spirit that maybe tried to interfere with this and lord we ask that you would once again move upon us we ask everything in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen amen you may see that does anyone have a quick testimony you know i went had to go to the bathroom before i got back in here and i'm in there and i'm you know getting ready to walk out the door and all of a sudden i just felt like seeing um more precious than silver you know and i and uh and i so i just started humming it and i got to the door and i heard faint sounds of that song coming through the door you don't think that god's you know you don't even you're not thinking about god at the moment you're just in there doing your business you know and you know and and you realize god's there amen that's wonderful that's amazing that's great thank you sister anyone else have god bless you sometimes i don't even know if i'm supposed to see him or not and then the lord puts a song that i haven't thought of in months to a year on my heart and sometimes i just know that that's what it has to be i haven't practiced it in a while so bear with me if i mess up hung between two thieves hear the soldiers mark his name see his followers [Music] his life is through [Music] as it is [Music] i've [Music] just remember that the debt for your [Music] is some still choose to mark his name see his followers now as they can boldly say that we are the reason that he came see the ones that trust in themselves this through jesus blood alone we approach the father's throne and hear the words that he still calls to [Music] when all hell tries to tell you that [Music] is [Music] that you'll never win [Music] is [Music] you we lose [Music] [Music] is [Music] thank you jesus thank you jesus praise the lord thank you brother michael amen amen thank you lord this blood will never lose its power amen and let's just sing that chorus we sing last sunday created me a clean heart before we and black brother bennett come out yes [Music] 5 39. [Music] [Applause] here [Music] within me [Music] is [Music] the joy of god me [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] presence [Music] salvation [Music] [Applause] is within me [Music] within me [Music] oh [Music] salvation [Music] praise the lord amen believe that today thank you jesus i appreciate the lord's goodness being able to know that if we cry unto him that he is more than faithful to deliver amen as david found out when he's saying that himself amen we can stand in the presence of the lord and know and trust that his hand is upon us continually amen praise the lord jesus let's stand to our feet if we could we'll go to the scripture now amen i never i guess i've never been in the situation to where i feel um anxious to vacate the room or finish so we can vacate the room and it's just different for me so i i'm i'm used to just preaching and saying whatever the lord puts on my heart for as long as he puts it on there but we have a little bit of different scenario going uh right now but just believing and trusting is temporary amen and hopefully the lord willing soon as i'll explain it through the service here um here we can be able to occupy our new place the lord willing to just trust him for that but now let's turn our bibles if we could the first john chapter one i read this scripture last week i want to lead all of this scripture today first john chapter one uh we'll begin reading with verse five five through ten first john chapter one verse five amen the last fire has prepared for another word of prayer before we read the word father god it is indeed grateful lord if we're thankful to be in this house lord again today just a temporary place that you'd give us father but we're so thankful for it and lord helping and providing us lord that we come in and out from the world and lord come together with those of light precious faith and lord close that door and believe god that you're going to be with us we feel your spirit and know that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you inhabit the praises of your people lord as we have lifted up our voices to you today god to offer spiritual sacrifices praises and worship to you god that it would be music to your ears and acceptable that you would receive it god that you come and visit us once again and speak to us from your word lord we're thankful today god of all that you've given us through the week and lord the blessings that you bestowed upon us and the grace that you give us in our lives lord that we can stand and live another day god knowing that you're always there that you never leave or forsake us father thank you lord for those that have come today thank you for those who may be streaming may your hand be upon each one lord as you bless them exceedingly move upon every request that was made known every situation of life those that are upon the hearts of your people here today we just thank you god for all that you do and done for us looking forward god to that wonderful time where you call us home to be with you lord we know it won't be much longer but the lord would continue to occupy occupy until you come lord trust in your faith and and the faith in our lives god to believe for that and in any moment in time lord we see our loved ones appearing before us god just blessed the remaining part of the service lord speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear let it be according to your perfect will father draws closer to you more like you for this last day journey god that you put before us we give you thanks and praise lord now i'm expecting you lord to speak again in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first john chapter one uh let's begin with verse five here it says this then is the message which we have heard of him declaring to you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another the blood of jesus christ clint his son cleanseth us from all sin praise the lord if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us you can be seated if you like amen we looked at that cleansing part again we talked about that had the subject to title that cleansing uh we did a part last week and obviously with our a little bit of time constraint i probably could have finished it last week but i just don't want to run over our time so this is like i said about the place i found and and within a price range it was acceptable and also i don't want to take advantage of that so we just split it up and just dive right back into this cleansing part again amen which is very important and we talked about last week that cleansing the cleansing that jesus christ gives and the blood of jesus christ you know we're entering into another easter time another easter season is just two weeks from today and uh that blood of jesus christ that still sits there i believe still sets that on that mercy seat was shed so they can breed cleansing that's why then if we confess our faults we confess our sin he is just and faithful to forgive our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen now you know we talked about last week your brother green talked about the 119 or first john 1 9 being the emergency 9-1-1 call if you're in trouble and you have an emergency you dial 9-1-1 on the phone uh if you're in desperate need of something in your life for lord jesus to cleanse you to wipe your sins away that that first john 1 9 is the prescription to do it but i want to understand something here now that's not a get out of jail free card as people would try to use it as yes it does cleanse us yes it does set us free amen but we don't take that as a liberty to continue to sin or to continue our lives in unrighteousness amen we we work upon the blood of jesus christ to send our lives to continue to press the battle and and live for christ and to do the best that we can according to his word and live as clean a life as we possibly can by the scripture we don't take first john one night and just say well uh you know i just do all this purposeful stuff in my life i just go out and sin purposefully because i know god will forgive me you know it doesn't work that way you know in romans he said well if the grace of god abound the more the sin there is the more grace god made the more grace of god there is that is true but that doesn't mean that you go out and then paul just said well then we should we just continue to sin he said god forbid that's not the point amen the point is to come to christ for the blood of jesus christ to cleanse you of all unrighteousness that water that we talked about last week is a continually washing that keeps us clean all the time that's why the blood and the water came out of the side of christ brother brown talked about the representation of the bride that came out of him at that time but that blood and water represented that cleansing and the continual process of cleansing it wasn't just a one-time thing that god cleanses and all of a sudden you're just a center again no it's a cleansing and to make you free but that you continually stay free by the washing of the water of the word that keeps you clean in him and as you continue to keep that before you and that token on display it keeps your life in a place to where you live a godly life above and beyond all of the rest of the world that's why you look different act different don't do things the rest of the world does because you're not a part of the world amen you've called out of the world as the bride is called out of a church you've been called out be not partaker of her sin now let's go back to uh for uh numbers chapter 12 and we'll talk just for a minute again and background uh what miriam went through when she spoke against moses when she spoke against moses we realized that last week through the scripture that god struck her with leprosy because she spoke against god's servants she spoke against god's prophet if you don't do that amen right uh that that's dangerous territory when you begin to speak about god's prophet when you begin to be derogatory about the message or god's word or god's prophet you're walking on dangerous territory i've heard testimony and stories of people that have mocked even the picture of the pillar of fire and dropped dead immediately just from mocking that pillar of fire well you know yes brother branham's in that picture but the most prominent person in that picture is not brother randall right it's the lord jesus amen and when you're mocking one you're mocking the other so miriam found that out rather quickly so let's drop down last week we read all of chapter 12. but let's drop down to the 13th first because uh i want to feed off of this for the next part of what i want to get to that i could have gotten to again last week but it just didn't feel the liberty to do so because i wanted to make sure to have the liberty to express uh the next part of this uh freely the way the lord put it on my heart so numbers chapter 12 verse 13. so moses so miriam struck with leprosy and moses her brother cried unto the lord saying he'll uh heal her now oh god i beseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father but had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again in other words that sin remember the leprosy representing sin had to be separated out of the camp for the completion of the duration of god's word god's word said seven days seven is completion the sin had to be removed from the rest of the congregation she had to be taken out and separated apart she could not be a part of the people any longer she had to be a separate part because that sin you didn't want that sin to become contagious to the rest of the people that were there so she had to be removed and put out for seven days and after the seven days she was to be what clean god was to cleanse her clean her of that of that of indiscretion of that sin and once that sin was eradicated she was able to come back into the camp again she was able to come back into fellowship with those of her brothers and sisters and those that was around her see so after that seven days she was clean she was to be received and again marion was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again and afterward the people were moved from hezeroth and pitched in the wilderness of heyram so that seven days is that completion or that period of time that god had set as we know by the bible's numerology that had been set for her to be able to be out from the camp to to complete that cleansing process now you say why did god choose threes why did god choose fives why did god choose them i don't know that's just up to him i just know that through the scripture and of course brother adam teaches us and those numerologies that god works in those numbers and those uh variables as god does the three is perfection and five is grace seven is completion and on and so on and so forth so god chose to do that so when god chose for her to be cleansed it was the seven day process that she was to reach that place now we've come through seven church ages from the time of jesus christ's death and the day of pentecost till now we've come through those seven church ages and that bride that was birthed forth there at the day of pentecost had to go into the ground as we know and had to die out and to be re uh to be received back again and grow back to a new life again through uh justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost which brings christ himself brother brown teaches us that baptism of the holy ghost brings christ himself which is christ in you the hope of glory through that seven day process now there's that completion of that bride and we are at the end of that seven-day process and we all know that amen we all know that we're at the end of that seven-day process right so the completion of that has brought this bride to that being cleansed to that finished product to where this last day bride this last day alive and remain group is going to be the ones to catch a rapture to be caught away because god has completed her god has brought her to that place of fulfillment of completion in him and now it's time for her to go home praise the lord so that's today do we live now at that time now i want to go to psalms chapter 51. and i want to go through david's prayer here we're going to read all of 51 it's not very long it's uh 19 verses but we'll read all of it and look at this process that david goes through that he talks about uh when he was in distress when david was in trouble when he needed something as as uh the song that that zach sang last amen created me a clean heart renewal right spirit within me amen david was the apple of god's eye the bible says that he was a man after his own heart and being a man after his own heart didn't mean that david was perfect it didn't mean that david was sinless right it didn't mean that david never did anything wrong or would never again do anything wrong we know that david did one of the most egregious things that a human can do he had another person killed murdered now he did it indirectly he didn't do it by taking a knife or a sword or whatever and killing the man but he sent the man out into the heat of a battle knowing that he would be killed which is the exact same thing that saul tried to do to him to get him killed you remember that you remember when saul was trying to get rid of david and saul sent david out and he asked david to that if he wanted to have his daughter the dowry for his daughter was 200 200 philistine foreskin right well you figure if he's going to collect 200 philistine foreskin in the middle of this whole battle and all that surely somebody will kill david because that was saul's whole motive was to kill david david did the exact same thing in the discretion of taking bathsheba unto her unto himself as his wife and and got in in trouble by it that he had to try to kill uriah to cover his indiscretion right you think how could this be a man after god's own heart because that wasn't the part that god was looking at right that wasn't the part that god was concerned with the man after god's own heart is in my opinion personified in the in psalms 51 this was the heart of david this psalm 51 is why in my opinion is why david was a man after god's own heart now look at it we'll go through this process too and recognize this seven days that that god had established for that healing and for for miriam in that seven days to be shut out from the camp to bring that cleansing that seven days of miriam and the process of psalms 51 so let's read it psalms 51 have mercy upon me o god according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions now notice this because this is completely contrary to how saul acted with god now you say well saul did the same thing david did the same thing as saul tried to do to him but yet saul was not the man after god's own heart but david was but see you notice just in this first verse the verbiage and the heart of david speaking to his maker speaking to god have mercy on me with loving kindness according to your multitude of your mercies that blot out my transgressions saul did not do that when saul was found guilty of his by his transgressions he doubled down and tried to make excuse for what he was doing wrong he didn't ask forgiveness he wasn't contrite he wasn't humble he didn't ask god for forgiveness he didn't even give god any sort of praise which is what david is doing here right he just doubled down and said oh well this is their fault all of this that fall well oh okay i you know i've received i'm guilty i'm sorry let's just move on with life it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way god's looking for humility god's looking for a contrite heart this is exactly what god loved in david so much he knew david was going to make mistakes friends just like he knows that we're going to make mistakes we're going to slip up and do things that we don't want to do that we know we shouldn't do but in our hearts we cry out to god as soon as you come to yourself you say god forgive me i didn't mean to do that god forgive me that wasn't me i just got caught in a trap or that enemy come and persuaded or something got a hold of me something happened lord forgive me cleanse me of all unrighteousness lord forgive me of my sin you come to god and you believe in and by that humble heart by that control that's what god's looking for because that's the same heart of god that heart is the heart that was in david it wasn't in saul saul was just rebellious as ever i mean saul's rebellion led him to go to witchcraft which you know samuel told him that he would do because he said the sin of rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft that's what saul as what samuel told him it's the sin of witchcraft if you act this way and that's exactly what saul ended up doing he went to the witch of endor to call samuel up from the dead performing wickery witchcraft that was south that was saul amen that was saul's heart but look at david's heart have mercy on me oh god amen how many of you ever cried that to the lord have mercy on me lord yes amen you look in the bible you see that man and this as brother branham describes that pompous man i believe he said matthew comes out and says oh i thank you god that i'm not like this peasant over here and i pray that you'd forgive me and that peasant's down there beating on his chest saying god oh forgive me a sinner cleanse me and wipe my sin away lord he said now which would you rather be right which one do you think god's accepted no i'm so glad i'm not like him are you that man are you that one that's crying out to god lord forgive me i'm sorry yes sir lord i repent lord wash my sin away annihilate them put them in the sea of forgetfulness lord amen that's david have mercy on me according to my loving kindness according to the murder of the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions continue to read now look at this wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me now there you go someone willing to admit someone willing to acknowledge now remember one of the very first things that even the world will teach you even the uh alcoholics anonymous and and places like that will tell you acknowledgement is the first step to being cured you have to admit right that's why uh uh in aaa you have to go and say uh my name is so-and-so i'm an alcoholic and you may not have had a drink of alcohol for 20 years but that's the res that's what they recite every time they go into their meeting i i'm so-and-so and i'm an alcoholic hadn't had a drink in 20 years but i'm so-and-so and i'm an alcoholic it's the first step to cure is acknowledging there's a problem right you have to first acknowledge and recognize i have a problem i need help and there's no shame in that friend right there's no shame in having an issue in life that's why the bible says that we are to confess our faults we are to confess those things so god so people can pray for us so that we can bring this before the lord so we can bring this before the faithful people that pray for you and hold you before the lord and say god deliver them and you be that one god forgive me see there's nothing wrong with that that's how you reach the place of being cleansed that's how you reach the place of purity because there's first acknowledgement david said i acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me in other words i know what i did and i know that what i did will haunt my dreams my memory for the rest of my life amen i i you know that because it happens to you right now you know that because the things that you've done wrong recently in the past in your old life the devil continually brings to you right and reminds you of those oh you remember how you used to be you remember what you did you remember how you acted or said over here the devil was always going to bring that before you david acknowledges that i acknowledge my sin and recognize that my my transgression recognize my sin as ever before me amen but understanding now that even though satan tries to bring that all back up to you again you can put it in the face david couldn't do this he know that god was forgiving of his sin or or he was covering it up but we know now that but that by the blood of jesus christ that thing is not before you yes it might come back into your spirit your memory but it is not before you because it's under the blood of christ and annihilated never to be remembered in the mind of god again praise the lord god justified as if though you had never done it in the first place amen talk about cleansing friend talk about cleansing david acknowledge i acknowledge my transgression amen we're continuing on with this first step now we're still just in the first day and this is come on i wanted to put this over into this week i didn't want to rush through this we're still in the first day okay i acknowledge my transgressions my center before me against thee the only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold i was shaken in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me now brother branham that's better known as we verbalize it and the message is we're born and sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lines it's kind of something that uh we speak fairly freely that you say that we say i was born in sin shape iniquity come to the world speaking lies this is the scripture that that comes from that david acknowledging i was shaping iniquity and didn't sin did my mother conceive me look what brother adam said in thinking man's filter and thinking mansfield he said when you come into this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a fighting chance he says not even with a fighting chance you were born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies within your own spirit the desire of sin a lover of sin your own nature commanded you to sin ephesians 2 tells us you were by nature the children of wrath you loved it you wanted to sin it was a part of you that's why we read last week or talked about first john 3 that says if you are born again of god then you cannot sin because there's no longer a love for sin there's no longer a desire for sin when god comes in and he burns that old nature out and takes the resonance of your soul it is completely done and away with yeah now you're born again you can you don't have a desire to sin anymore you don't have a desire to do the things of the world you don't have a desire to or a lover of sin as he says here because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance but down on the inside of you somewhere is where you come praise the lord that seed of god was always there again first john 3 that seed of god that was always there yes dormant for a while by predestination god placed in you that was always there he said down on the inside of you somewhere is where you come there was something in there that began to draw if you know there was something that told you you were there was a god somewhere you began to read his word you went to church you took the ideas you was told uh was better than then then you never use the thinking man's filter but when god when you use god's filter which is a thinking man's filter because all other filters pass away mine shall not when you take god's filter and draw your life your desires it draws your desires through god's filter his word now if you take those desires and you draw through god's word they're going to be pure they're going to be right they're not going to be things that are going to be frivolous or things of the world or things that are of sin it's going to be things that are of righteousness because nothing else will draw through this filter nothing else will draw through this word uh we went picked up sister matisse today and we were listening to a little music on the radio there was a song that come on there and there's a little part of that song which i understood and i got the point they were trying to make but it didn't draw through this filter and i looked over at my wife and i said that's wrong and she said well what do you mean i said did you not hear the lyric i guess they weren't listening as good as i was i love music i listen i like music i don't listen to it like the world does it buds in years all the time but anyway i like good gospel christian music i love to sing it hear it anyway and i was listening and i heard that lyric and i'll tell you what the lyric was it said it was it was speaking from jesus point of view and it said i didn't cry because lazarus died i cried when i knew i had to bring him back and i thought well that's a nice sentiment and i understand that because he's better off on the other side than he is in this world correct we all understand that so i get the premise but that's completely unscriptural that's not what the bible says and that is not what brother brown said what was the the dramatization that he gave his good friend had just passed away and the human part of jesus was sad and cried yeah not because he was sad he was gonna have to bring him back i said that is so unscriptural i mean you just take even brother branham's uh dramatization out of it it's not scriptural right it didn't draw through god's filter and i looked and said and we talked about it for a few minutes i said i understand what he's saying and i agree with the premise but this but he's wrong according to scripture right i said and i just have a little hang up when it comes to what's against the scripture it's got to be the pure word to me period i don't care if it's just half a lyric in a song it's got to be scripture to me but it caught my attention i said that's not right that's not scripture it doesn't draw through that filter see and if you are that filter now because you've become the word then it doesn't draw through you you say now that something gets hung in there says no that's not right amen no matter what it is could be the lyric in the song could be something that somebody's trying to get you to do or tell you or something or the devil's trying to sway you a certain way and say oh no no that that's just hanging up in my spirit something's not right there that's that thinking man's filter only thing brother man says it draws your desires at thinking man's filter there is nothing left but the holy ghost amen amen nothing left but the holy ghost the pure word that's all that can be left you can take all these gifts and all these everything it's got to drop through the word friend if it doesn't draw through the word something's wrong with it let's continue on now i was shape and iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me known uh make me uh to know wisdom now that's that's the first day that's day number one that's an acknowledgement of sin and sin being judged that's that has to be the first acknowledgement now god hasn't responded anything you understand this is just the beginning this is just day one god forgive me i acknowledge i was wrong i acknowledge my sin i i i recognize that the uh that i've done wrong cleanse me lord uh wipe my slate clean take it take thy sin and annihilate it from me lord that's the first step amen has to be the first step sin that is judged yet that is acknowledged and judged now look at part set verse seven day two purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean and remember we talked about his last week that very very common weed that was there that represented simplicity or humility hyssop you notice many times when god talks about applying the blood has to be applied with a simple faith has to be applied with the humility amen just as he did on the doorpost of the lentil when the death angel came through just as moses came and sprinkled as we talked about last week sprinkled the people and sprinkled the book and sprinkled the instruments with the blood and the water had to be done with the hyssop had to be in simplicity humility see simplicity faith purge me now that's that faith that's that simplicity his and i shall be clean wash me amen wash me and i shall be clean i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow now we've reached a cleansing of forgiveness amen because first of all he says purge me with thy hyssa that's that forgiveness cleansing so that he's whiter than snow now just within that verse you've got two separate days you've got a forgiveness so so so far we've got verse seven verses first six day one verse seven day two day two and three in verse seven because the first is acknowledgement second is the forgiveness third is the cleansing amen because notice the cleansing has to come after the forgiveness have you ever done something wrong to somebody or somebody done wrong done you wrong and and let's just say you've done somebody wrong and you go to that person you ask for forgiveness i acknowledge that what i did to you was wrong i i ask that you forgive me see i acknowledge it and i ask for forgiveness but then the cleansing has to come afterwards because that person has to forgive you and for there be a reinstatement of your relationship right that's that's the cleansing that forgiveness and that cleansing brings the two back into fellowship again back together again so that has to be the acknowledgement the forgiveness and the cleansing now let's go to verse 8. make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which now has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities created me here we go create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation amen amen not our salvation his salvation praise the lord we can ask for forgiveness but it's god that does the cleansing it's his salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit now your spirit filled amen day four a spirit feeling a presence of god coming in creating me a clean heart renew a right spirit within me take natural holy spirit from me and and uh restore to me the joy of my of thy salvation uphold within me thy free spirit god and his bringing it of his spirit into your life amen being spirit filled now you notice there's a lot that goes that we talk about with justification sanctification the holy spirit acts 2 acts 2 38 specifically even where paul gets up and they want to know how do we get what you have and it's that process that he begins to explain to them now he goes through it from the very beginning when they come out and think that everyone's drunk and he says oh they're not junkies you suppose he's the third hour of the day this is what the bible says the bible says joel specifically in the scripture said this was going to happen and now it's happening before you this day that scripture is fulfilled and he began to expound to them that process what you go through what happens in life the acknowledgement the forgiveness the cleansing and then the spirit comes and sweets him amen and it fills you with his spirit with his goodness with the holy ghost amen when that holy ghost is in there then you've got a vessel that's in service you got a vessel that can be used you got a vessel that god can come and and move you and tell you to do this and go hear it and be obedient to whatever his word is for you see that's a spirit-filled person that's a person living with the token on display when that token's on display you would display to the world and to the devil that you don't belong but to god right you don't belong to the world you don't belong to the government you don't belong to the satan in the world order you belong to god you're god's cause your spirit field you've reached the place of acknowledgement of forgiveness of being cleansed and filled amen now we've gotten to day four but there's more still to the story because once you get born again you're just starting yeah we know that when you are born again you are just starting just like you're born as a little child your life's just starting your child isn't born and and as soon as it draws a breath they cut the umbilical cord and you handed the car keys it doesn't work that way it's not ready to do all those things it will be eventually but that's just the beginning and god doesn't do that to us when you're spirit-filled it's just the beginning now there's more to the story see there there's a continuation so let's go on if we can we'll finish chapter 51 then will i teach transgressors thy ways oh wow so there's something even beyond being spirit-filled i just thought i'd just get the holy ghost on the couch i just thought i'd get the holy ghost and just sit behind my desk or get the holy ghost and just live out the rest of my life oh no no no no you just got started friend amen you just began and david acknowledges that and recognizes hey i am now ready to be put in service god has filled me with his spirit it's time to do something about it so what do we do about it david said then will i teach transgressors thy ways amen how many of us do that help us lord amen then i will teach transgressors thy ways uh and sinners shall be converted unto thee now we know this is a hard day we know we're in a well brother branham said gleaning but that was 60 years ago are we still gleaning um i'll say yes because uh i believe we're supposed to feel that way until he comes even though there'll be a time where there will be no more gleaning to be done but that's not my determination that's god's determination i'll work until he takes me home right so but this transgressor part you can speak to a lot of nowadays and they've become so filthy as we talked about last week they become so perpetually filthy dirty that they don't even recognize how filthy they are they don't recognize that they need cleansing they don't recognize they need to be under the spigot they don't recognize they need to get under the fountain they don't realize how dirty and filthy they are that they need cleansing michael sent me something this week and said you know it came to him this week i was going to get him to preach it but i'll just give that a little bit to you but he said you know i was thinking about it and uh i believe he's in the shower anyway and he said yeah it's great to be under the water but you got to get the soap off the shelf and you got to use it you got to get the shampoo off the shelf and you got to use it you got to get the wash rack or whatever your process is of cleansing yourself your body physically you've got to actually be an action to do it it's great to be under the fountain and that's good you should be we all need to be trying to get as many people under that fountain as you possibly can but then they've got to actually go and get that soap they gotta actually go and get that shampoo they gotta actually go and do the process of being of cleansing and becoming clean but sometimes spiritually people are so filthy today because they're in darkness because men would rather live in darkness than light because in darkness their deeds are not exposed amen they hate light because in the light their deeds are exposed but they want to live in darkness and as they live in darkness they smell and and wreak so bad but you try to help them now this is speaking today now i'm not disagreeing with what david said here because that's still a part of our commission to do to help teach transgressors god's way and that some one maybe might come to him i told you the other day that there was a family came to our church that had just moved to florida and someone in our church had witnessed to them they started coming to church and they'd been in church i had a a a well i just i don't want to call him a scoffer but he just was kind of negative that was probably a better word negative about it oh there's nobody else to be saved you know the brother banner preach souls in prison brother branham also said what if he didn't say it is he said what if now there will be a day it will be we know that right but i thought why did you be so negative we try so hard to get other people to come to christ we try to get them to come and now we've got a whole family that's coming can we be positive about that oh we get honest nobody's they'll be gone they're still serving the lord right to my knowledge 20 years later they're still going to church still serving the lord now whether they're seed or not whether that's up to god but i know they're still going to church still still serving the lord so we can be all negative as we want but there might be one here it might be a person there it might be we don't know but the point of it is to be in service that's day five amen to be in service for the lord david said as he put it i will uh i will teach transgressors thy way and sinners shall be converted unto thee praise the lord we'll do what we can right yeah i and i don't mean to speak on his behalf but i can almost guarantee you i will guarantee you that brother tom at the gym show in the next few weeks is going to be doing that very thing to as many people as he possibly can yeah as he has expressed he gets a lot of negativity but you just never know right you don't quit doing it though do you well first of all a teen you to do it's just a part of you so if it's a part of you it's kind of like you know you just either don't say anything or you talk about the lord that's just that's your two options you talk about god or you don't talk at all that's because it's just in you it's just what you do so anyway that's part of it day four let me move on is that a couple of the scriptures i want to read amen day four now let's get to day five deliver me from blood guilt guiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness amen oh lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise now it's service and worship now there's a worship praise the lord that we're supposed to have with the lord day six is worship for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou desires not in uh delight is not in burnt offering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart oh god thou will not despise that's the man after god's own heart you've never heard things like that from saul never but from the man after god's own heart you do that's why he's a man after god's own heart not because of his faults not because of best shiva not because you're right not because of things he's done wrong but because of his heart contrite humble before the lord open my lips lord and i will sing praises to you amen amen acknowledgement forgiveness spirit filled service and worship six days but that's the number of man so we got one more step here and let's see where david comes with it do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness which we offer up spiritual sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullock upon thine altar that's a restoration of fellowship with god again that was the fellowship that god had and that restoration is exactly what god was looking for from david it's exactly what god is wanting from his children you know saints when when when adam failed when adam and eve sinned and sin was everywhere all of nature fell when adam fell everything that god created felt body life animal life and human life all fell when adam went into sin god could have wiped it clean and says you know i'll just start all over again man has done sin man has done fell into despair and degradation i just wipe them out and get rid of them off i'll just create me a new adam or create me a new beginning whatever that would be i'll just start all over well first of all god would not have been able to exercise his uh his ability to be a father his his ability to be a healer his attribute to be a savior and god then begin the process of that salvation and through the bible showing us his healing his deliverance his his uh of leadership his salvation his direction everything that god does for us every day is all through the scripture he just began there in the garden of eden well that same process we go through as individuals all the time god's just looking for the restoration of that fellowship just like he was looking for in the garden of me i know we talk about how much adam enjoyed the fellowship of god coming down in the cool of the day and then talking lift to ear because we were a part of adam we know what that means in our lives but oh don't you think god enjoyed that just as much don't you think god enjoyed that fellowship with adam just as much as adam did well don't you think god enjoys it just as much from you amen god enjoys that fellowship just as much from you as he did from adam he's enjoying that fellowship with you as much as you enjoyed the fellowship with him that's why that restoration is so important it completes that fellowship where god and man have become one again brother brahman said heaven and earth embrace one another and he's become one again god in man in fellowship in togetherness fellowship that's what god wanted he couldn't wipe them clean in the beginning but that's not what he wanted he wanted a restoration to bring him back to where they're supposed to be that's why when jesus christ died he not only uh cleansed and shed his blood for your sin but he went all the way back to adam and delivered every one of them from adam all the way through that's how he emptied out paradise gave gifts unto men and they all ascended with him as his that is ascension they were appeared unto us for a month or so amen they appeared unto many the dead in christ rose appeared unto many the bible says didn't appear unto one person it appeared they appeared unto many and then when jesus rose they went with went up to period i went and went with him amen praise the lord but god enjoys that just as much as you do god wants that fellowship god wants that restoration just as much as you do that seven steps that we go through that god desires for each of us as we come into that place of god and man coming together again amen you and god coming back into that fellowship again now let me read a couple more scriptures because i've got to close here in first timothy first timothy chapter 4 verse verse 1 now the spirit speaketh expressively that in the latter times that is shall i say today i don't mean to change the word or add to it but we'll just say today latter times some shall depart from the faith that means now that's not talking about just people of the world right you understand this is people who were in the faith and left not just worldly people that were never in it this is expressing that there will be some depart that were there in the faith that depart and leave from it that's a different group amen you understand that's a different group than just the worldly people that just were never in it to begin with okay so you look i just looking at one time i looked and i said some shall some shall some how about most about 98 but see he's not talking about all those he's just talking about those that were in the faith and left shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devil which is a religious spirit yeah speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron neck of forbidding to marry commanding to abstain from meats they want you to be a vegetarian christian a vegan as i preached one time vegan christian yeah they don't want you to have any meat of the word you just want to feed your fig leaf here there they don't want to give you the meat of the word so they they command you that you should not be eating meat amen that's what the world will tell you oh it's so horrible for you friend i'm just getting to the place i don't know if i'm getting more cynical or wise because i'm starting to disbelieve almost everything the world tells me anymore the medical world science world and all this i i mean i don't know i i guess they get paid to do what they do but um i don't know i just trust the lord i don't want to be foolish about that right or arrogant but i just trust the lord i just trust that i don't know what else to say but they forbid to marry uh and in fact there's a whole cell i use that word the other day what that means is an overall around the world a call in this country they're starting to teach kids in certain curriculum that that they're actually putting down the family dynamic being a family husband wife children boy girl well it's them they and whatever that that's the way it is anymore it's them it's they it's whatever you know but you could be what you want to be a boy go for it you don't need a girl uh it doesn't matter what the chromosomes say you're a boy you're a girl is there anything as unfortunate as a come on bro amen someone who thinks they're anyway you know what i'm saying you know what i'm talking about now that's just just as ungodly denying the authority of god and his word of anything there is going on today to say oh god didn't create a man and a woman he absolutely did and he created them separate and they're supposed to be separate and they're supposed to act separate they're supposed to dress separate amen amen forbidding to marry now they're doing that commanding to abstain from me so if you're not a vegan you're you're you're no good which god had which god has created to be received with thanksgiving of them now here's the here's the separation right you don't think god's a a segregationist you're wrong god is absolutely a segregation not between color of skin but between the color of character right if you will believe from unbelief amen and here's that separation god created it to them to be received with thanksgiving to uh of them which believe and know the truth well you know that doesn't include everybody everybody doesn't know and believe the truth right so this scripture doesn't apply to those that are out there you know i'm a vegetarian i'm a vegan course i don't they have nobody even says vegetarian anymore there's it's just vegan if you're not well you're just not with it or woke i guess is the word they use today uh you're just not woke so if you're not abstaining from me if you're not forbidding to marry if you don't agree that a person could be a boy and a girl at the same time well then you're just not woke right that's what they say yeah well i'm not a heathen either so right correct i'd rather not be heathen and not be woke so if that works that way then i'm okay with that but you understand this is not applied to everybody this is only to them which believe and know the truth amen for every creature of god is good and nothing can be refused if it be if it be with uh received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the word of god in prayer so now my question is do you believe what you pray right right amen i've seen people bow their heads over a meal and fret over every bite i don't know if i should be eating this well i don't know if i should be this is not this and this is not that and this is not good this is not good for you and you just pray over it exactly right or you just you're absolutely denying any sort of faith that you may have had when you prayed over the meal right did you not believe when you prayed did you not talk to god about it do you not believe that when you talk to him he answers your prayer well if you do then you've got to believe when you when you say it that he hears you and it is sanctified amen period that's my belief you just you believe it or you don't and if you don't well it doesn't apply to you then you might as well be a vegan of course that's probably a lot of rottenness than that too but the point is you either are a believer or you're not a believer right that's what it basically and that's what this whole thing at this end time is boiling down to that's what this segregation is all about that's what this division had come out out of her my people is all about is separating belief from unbelief faith from doubt amen that's what it's all about but you understand it's all been cleansed it's all been sanctified for the use of the for the use of our bodies right amen we either believe that or we don't that's what the bible said one more scripture real quick i'll close here ephesians chapter five and i wanted to finish with this so just uh you'll have to review i'll give them another 20 bucks or something if i go yes um ephesians 5 verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he he jesus christ might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word the word washing the word cleansing amen continually perpetually keeping you clean now this is conversely to those whose conscience is seared for the hot iron you want to know what that seared with a hot iron means it means one who carries about with them the perpetual conscience of sin yeah perpetual they've been so seared and none from sin that they can continually perpetually carry that sin with them amen that's what their whole life is because that's how they live their conscience is seared with a hot iron and they just live that's their just their whole life is sin but to a believer in jesus christ he's presented the bride to himself so he could cleanse her so that he could wash her and keep you clean by the washing of the water of the word now the perpetualness of sin on one side but the perpetual watching from sin on the other god is washing by what the water of the word that keeps you clean amen keeps you forgiven and in the presence of god that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it might be holy and without blemish amen how many of you can say that's me that's me he's talking about me i'll declare before all of you today and everybody watching this or ever will watch it that's me amen he's talking about me he's telling that i am without spot that i am without wrinkle or any such thing and holy without blemish yes amen praise the lord amen holy without blemish god has made his children why not because of my righteousness but because of his righteousness not because of what i have done but it's because of what he has done i just accept it and i like to stand under that spigot and continually let that water let that spigot continually wash me amen continually wash and keep clean by the water of the word amen not the water of your favorite television program not the water of your favorite movie your favorite song not the word of your favorite dress or or job or no by the word amen that's how you get and stay clean by the washing of the water of the word the word jesus christ shed his blood to cleanse us to cleanse us from all unrighteousness to purge us from all our sin that we might be without spot wrinkle or blemish amen standing in his presence as though you had never done it in the first place right what a cleansing friend or if it's just a if it's just somehow you can get that cleansing over to the world won't happen but it sure would be nice i wish you could amen jesus is here in human flesh you couldn't do it so amen it's only to those that are predestinated those that are called elected chosen of god before the foundation well those he knew would receive it when it come across their path he knew you here this morning he knew you there watching he knew you would receive it when it came across your path that's why that little seed was in there might have been dormant but it was still in there right all it took was a little bit of light amen a little bit of work and then all of a sudden that seed began to spring forth and we understand now that that seed was god himself right amen god himself now that's the permanent prominent resident of your soul sealed everything else out amen i'm so thankful you might look in the mirror and say well i don't look that cleansed well maybe you need to take a shower but spiritually i may not look that clean you look through the wrong lens and if you legitimately look through the right lens the thinking man's filter and you still don't see yourself as cleansed then maybe you're not maybe you need to come to an altar again maybe you need to find christ again amen if you need to get born again fill with his spirit whatever it is whatever needs be that's between you and god amen but obey that because the worst end of it is death and after that is hell yeah and i know none of us wants to do that amen so god bless you let's stand if we could amen let's sing this course we usually see it when we take communion in fact i always sing it when we take community but let's see song numbers uh 16 let's just sing this a couple times just the first verse here if you don't know any of the rest of it i've never i've sang the rest of it but not very often but just the first verse a couple of times through amen [Music] me know my thoughts i praise [Music] me [Music] now search for my heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] from [Music] granted hallelujah jesus i pray do that to each one of us amen every day of our lives we trust seek that from the lord we make sure that we're cleansed and clean before him that our lives are ever before him and he understands and he's there for us humbly contritely bowing before the lord god amen and god will cleanse made clean yes take out any wick at the store today in jesus name praise the lord god bless you i appreciate you love you all pray there was something to say bless you today amen i contacted the realtor again for the other churches was planning on moving again from the ina location and he's having a difficult time getting the city of miranda to come out and check off on the facility because they can't even turn the electricity onto that building until the town of marana clears it so they don't have power on the building yet but that wouldn't take long to do it just has to go through the whole process of doing it and that whole process is what we're in the middle of right now so just i told the realtor we'd be praying for frank is the pastor's name the other church so we'd be praying for frank his church uh if that's where he's supposed to go and open this place up for us that the lord would provide that for them they could move into that facility and moran would get on the ball the power company and all and get it done and ready for them so because we're done and ready to go over there so i still look though i'm still looking uh i found things that may work uh but they would probably have to be fixed to be a church so i'm just thinking a little bit more patience and and if the lord has is if the lord's dragging this out because he's got someplace better right uh then i'm i'm looking i'm listening i'm watching if anything comes up so we'll just see but for right now that's uh the plan so and that's where we are with that so just pray for them pray for the church pray for the miranda to come and and do their thing in the power company and what all needs to be done so they can move over there they're ready to move over they were they were he told me they're ready two or three months ago to move over there so um whatever that is needs to be done and i said well we're ready too so we'll see whatever the lord provides so amen just to keep you updated with that's where we are with it right now so i haven't heard back from the town of miranda myself about us moving into that facility i'm not concerned about that part i don't think there'll be an issue but i wanted to clear it to make sure that you know that it is official with the town of miranda because like i said we want to have the church and micah is talking about making a sign there's a big huge sign over top of it and put something over for a sign for us and also anyway we'll just uh we just continue to trust the lord and what he provides i think and thankfully provided this so we'll be meeting here until you hear back from me on sundays at 10 30 we'll be meeting here until i sonja says just tell them this just going to be the same i called the guy and reserved this room for like the next three weeks so but we cancel at any time but just so nobody else sneaks in and gets it from under us so it'll be like this until the lord provides and and the stuff that they need to do over there can be done in a day i mean it's not hard it's just the process so anyway we appreciate you love you thank you for your prayers remember the prayer requests and remember that in prayer too so amen and i trust you love you all and appreciate you in the lord so amen we'll be dismissed in a word of prayer brother john would you just miss us with jesus lord father no lord enough light of your word lord god that's how we're looking at ourselves lord god and you know
