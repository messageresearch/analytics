Let's stand if we could and ask brother Dennis if you would. to have him back with us if he would take us to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I feel like David said one time, I was glad when he said it unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Lord, thank you, Father. We know as my brother even said, the world's falling apart. There's so many signs that's uh displaying itself that your coming is very close. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; And it's time, Father, that we identify ourselves fully with your word. &gt;&gt; Your prophet said that the bride will have the seal of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the rest of the world will take on the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; it's sobering. Father, there was one message you sent in this day to get a bride ready for a rapture. There's not many messages or many churches you send in your word. You'll reveal your secrets unto your servants, the prophets. And father, as the prophet said, the revelation of the rapture is only to the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; She knows what she needs to do to get ready. Father, it's lamb trimming time. And brother said lamping means to get all that worldliness, all that carnality. &gt;&gt; Yes. all that lacks the desical spirits away from us &gt;&gt; to repent daily if we see that we have sinned and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Oh yes God &gt;&gt; we thank you father by your grace you have called us into your marvelous light. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. There's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty state. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. &gt;&gt; There's only one place you meet the believer every day. It's under the shed blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And father, there's power in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We as the prophet said, you don't have to take any lie, anything from the devil. God has paid the price in full. He's paid the price in full for our healing. Amen. He's paid the price in full for our mental uh welfare. He's paid the price for our finances. He's paid a price for everything. Father, there are many that are sick this morning. Their request has been spoken. Lord, our sister Norma going for the MRI. Father, oh Lord, may you have complete control of this visit with the doctors. May all go well for your honor and glory. Grant it, God. Yes. &gt;&gt; And Father, for our sister Judy Arnold, with the eye surgery, oh Lord, may you guide the surgeon's hands. May she come out with a better eyesight, a better condition. For you are in control, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, all the others that may be uh that had a request are sick. You are our high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by your stripes, we are healed. We claim healing in the name of Jesus Christ for all that need a touch from you. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help us to stand on your word to look in the mirror of your word and see the reflection of Jesus Christ. Oh Lord, we're in that hour where you can bring forth the dead in Christ and we'll be taken home, Father, together very soon. &gt;&gt; Lord, uh bless each and everyone that raised their hand for unspoken prayer request. May you grant them their heart's desire. You said in your word, delight yourself in the Lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart. We believe it. Reclaim it. Satan, you have no hold on God's people. I adure you in the name of Jesus Christ to leave him to let go and let God have his way. In your name we pray. Name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. Amen. Sister Norma has a song she wants to sing for us today. Amen. So, we're going to ask her if she would go ahead and come up. sing song for us. Bless our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Been a while since I've been here, but it's still not any easier.

There's no mountain to [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's no storm too dark. [Music] There's no [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he carried the weight of the world upon his shoulders. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Praise the Lord. Micah has a song, too, to sing for us. &gt;&gt; Oh, he has a testimony, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was just a brief testimony. I had a brief outpatient, very minor outpatient surgery, having a subdural under the skin cyst removed off my upper thigh. Everything went well. It's just healing. So, thank the Lord. Even though it's minor, anything can happen. Just thankful that it went well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This song's been on my heart for the last couple weeks. Um especially given the testimonies and things that have been happening in our midst. So, uh, definitely sing along and encourage you to think of a time when he touched you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I was shackled by a heavy burden beneath the load of guilt and shame. [Music] There the hand of Jesus touched me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And now I am no longer. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; He touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh, the joy that floods my soul. [Music] Something wonderful happened. And now I know he touched me and he made me whole. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And since I've met this blessed Savior. And since he has cleansed and made me whole. You know that I will never cease to praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to shout it all eternity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he touched me. Oh, he touched me. And all the joy that floods my soul. I know that something wonderful happened.

Oh, Jesus touched me. and all the joy that floods my soul. You know that something wonderful happened. And now you know that he touched you and made me more time. It's because he touched me. Oh Jesus, touch me. And oh the joy that floods my soul. Oh something wonderful happened. And now I know it's because Jesus touched me. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Thank you Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise your name Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord. My my. Aren't you so glad he touched you today? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. Without that touch, where would we be, saints? Amen. without the touch of the Lord Jesus making us whole, not just physically, spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise his holy name, Lord Jesus. Let's stand to our feet if we could. Amen. We'll go to the scripture now. Amen. Thank the Lord Jesus. We're going to go back over to Romans chapter 8 again. Read those couple of verses as we have been the series. Speak on adoption again. This be adoption part 21. Adoption part 21 position in Christ part five. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adoption 21 position in Christ five. And I always forget to have prayer requests. myself. I'm supposed to leave at about 1:30 today, going back to Houston. So, I appreciate your prayers. Supposed to be hot and humid in Houston. Uh, according to the uh weather so far, it's supposed to be 95 every day. And of course, with the humidity, it's probably more like 102, 3,4, something like that. We're doing vacuums, so we're going to be outside all day every day. Uh, but just trusting the Lord to give grace. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Romans chapter 8. We're going to begin reading with verse 14 as we normally do. But before we do, we just bow our heads for another word of prayer. Lord Jesus, very thankful, Father, of your grace and mercy to us. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your blessings, your love, your hand of of mercy in our lives and watching over us and keeping us. Thank you Lord for bringing us this place again, Lord. This time, this day, Lord, another Sunday to come in from out of the world to worship and to praise you, God. just looking Lord for wonderful things to happen in our lives Father and for you to bless us exceedingly as you have already done so much Lord God if you have Lord if you'd never do one more thing God I'll just speak for me personally if you never do one more thing for me the rest of my life I have gotten way more than I ever should have gotten Lord and I'm so thankful for your blessings to me God and I know that we're all so very thankful God of the blessings you give to us we pray God that you take now complete control of the main part of this service. Lord God, the ministering of your word, may it come forth with power and manifestation. May it go forth and heals those that are sick in body. May it go forth, Lord, and not return void, but accomplish in each and every one of us what you sent it forth for. Yes. &gt;&gt; May you anoint every ear, every every word that's spoke, Lord. Help every one of us, God, to receive by revelation that that you would have us to see and know through your word, God. on the vindicated word for this day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God, we just commit ourselves to you and ask your blessings on on this service now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans chapter 8, read the three verses beginning with 14 as we do. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, joint hes with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be uh also glorified together. Amen. And you can be seated if you'd like. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We notice that u we notice that we talked about uh we left off the week before and then last week talking about uh the adoption of Jesus Christ and we went into Matthew 17 and of course tied that to the understanding that uh uh after his adoption he placed in us. Amen. What we need to understand as we become adopted into this same body that we have the same authority that he has as being adopted son. Amen. Understand the difference. And we saw we read where uh not last week but we read previously or Jesus had been baptized. Amen. Been baptized by John. John said uh uh I I need to be baptized of you. He said suffer it to be so. But John baptized Jesus because the sacrifice had to be washed before it was presented. Yes. So John baptized Jesus and as Jesus came up out of the water, the spirit of God, Amen, the spirit of God came down on him in the form of a dove. Amen. And the voice spoke, Amen. of God. Amen. That said, this is my beloved son. Amen. In whom I am well pleased. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But notice the difference between his baptism and his adoption. Amen. And his baptism je uh God said, "This is my beloved son." Yes. &gt;&gt; In whom I am well pleased or pleased whom I dwell to pleased to dwell in. Yes. Amen. This is my son in whom I am well pleased. But when he uh but in Matthew 17 when uh when he was when he received that transfiguration adoption Jesus uh God spoke out and said this is my son my beloved son in whom I well pleased hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the difference. The difference between Jesus baptism and his adoption. The words were basically the same except for the last part now because he had been put in that position, that placement of authority. God put Jesus in that placement of authority. And notice right after he was put in that place of authority, he said, "Now if you say to this mountain, amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. So now where does that place us? Because we need to also recognize our position. Amen. In Christ. Notice as the scriptures read, we read this scripture 21 times now because this is part 21. So we've read this scripture to begin this series in every single part. Amen. 21 parts. We have read this part where it says that we are the children of God. We are led of God and if children heirs of God and joint hes with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So no wonder Jesus the difference in his baptism and his adoption was I am pleased to dwell in him. I am pleased to dwell in him. Hear ye him. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now the authority of the spoken word was placed in Jesus. And then Jesus again turned around and said now if you say to this mountain if you say praise the Lord. Now he's taken the authority that he's gotten and he's placed it in his children in the heirs of Christ that we are part of in that position of power that ep uh position of authority and I want to talk about that a little bit today uh today before we go now let's go over to Matthew um chapter 26 uh 24 excuse me amen uh no I had it right Matthew 26 pardon Matthew 26. I'm going to read one verse of scripture. We'll go over to Matthew 28. We'll read a couple more scriptures there. Amen. Draw our context today. Position in Christ. Again, recognizing that our position in Christ. But look at this now. Jesus said um they brought him for before uh Caps and the Sanhadrin. And to to serve time to read the the whole story, let's just read 64. Verse 64. Matthew 26:64. And Jesus said unto him, thou hast said, "Nevertheless, I say unto you, hereafter, I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The right hand is a position of authority. The right hand is a position of power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you took the scripture without revelation or you took it just as it is literally written, you would have God first of all with a literal hand. And God doesn't have a literal hand. God's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you would have God with a literal right hand. And you would have Jesus sitting on that right hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a revelation of scripture, if you just took it for face value, it said the son of man sitting on the right hand. I mean, if someone didn't understand the scripture, if you just take and read it for face value, you've got God with a hand and Jesus sitting on it as two different people, first of all, which God's just one God, which we'll read in just a minute. You'll have God at least two people. You chop him up into two pieces. Most people uh chop him up into three, but you can chop him up up into two. You can have Jesus sitting on the hand of God, which again, God doesn't have a hand. He's a spirit. And he's not sitting on his right hand, but he's sitting on the right hand of power. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power that represents you look through all the scriptures. Amen. The represent called that into being, you see that that right hand of power is a is a is a position of authority. It's a position of power. Amen. the power of God that God had when God told those that were there in attendance, of course, and he's told us through the reading of the scripture, hear ye him, that authority and that power transferred, which we've already gone through many times about a man and raising a son and having tutors over that son and that son getting to the place that he's grown and he's ready to take authority and power over what the the father wants him to take over. And uh he's got a good report. Uh he's he's pleasing to me. He's done everything I said. He's he's accomplished everything. And the dad uh and and in pride is thankful for his son to be able to turn over this to his son. He says, "Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But again, don't forget right after he was given that authority, before the chapter even ends, Jesus comes down off the Mount of Transfiguration and he tells his disciples, "If you say," &gt;&gt; so he's telling us. Now, let's go over to uh Matthew 28. Let's read a couple of verses of scripture here. &gt;&gt; So, the right hand is the right hand. Authority and power is a representation of that of that right hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he tells Caes and the whole Sanhadrred, amen, you will see the son of man, amen, ascending. He will be uh on the right hand of the father, the right hand of power. Amen. Now verse uh uh let's start with 18. Matthew 28:18. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. That's just what he told Capus and the Sanhadrin. He told them the exact same thing. You see him on the right hand of power. Praise the Lord. And now he's saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." That's his adoption. That's his placement of adoption. Amen. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Now, we must find our position or know what our position is. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's continue to read. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Nam [Music] name. &gt;&gt; Amen. We understand that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do we know what a name is? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Good. What is a name? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Newton Bennett is my name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; George Newton Bennett III. The third is what separates me from my grandpa and my dad &gt;&gt; is the fact that I'm a third. The fourth is what separates my son from me and my dad and my grandpa because he was George Bennett the fourth. Amen. That that even that little bit separates us. That's our name. Amen. But if I stood here and said, "Father," how many of you would stand up? I know Dennis has fathered children. I know Danny's father children. Amen, Steve. Amen. Or I would stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I've children. I'm as much a father as Dennis is. Amen. But if I go through that door and I say, "Father, five of us are going to walk to the door." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz who are they talking about? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Jesus said in the name, praise the Lord, the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. What is that name? And notice that word name is not plural, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because there's not but one God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not two and there's not three. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not a dozen. There's not 50. There's one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ. What is his name? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is his name. He is Jesus the anointed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord of all, Lord Jesus Christ, father, son, holy ghost. He is one is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why there's no contradiction. As a lot of people would say, there's contradiction in the Bible. And a lot of actually a lot of very smart biblical people and and and ministers and and and I I wouldn't say scholars but studying the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can't answer the difference between Matthew 28:19 and and and Acts 2:38. They don't know the difference, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there is no difference. But they can't reconcile the two. I've even had I mean pastors that's ministered for 20, 30 years come and tell me, "Well, I'll just take what Jesus said." And what kind of an answer is that to the scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I'm like, "Okay, well then what do you do with Acts 2:38?" Well, it's it's just in there. And you know, I I they don't know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They don't know. If you try to characterize a difference between the two, then you've got a problem. Amen. Because they don't know. That's one reason they have a problem with the Godhead. Because they don't know. Amen. Is there two? Is there three? How many is there? They don't know. Without revelation, they won't know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is no difference between Matthew 28:19 and Acts 2:38. There's no difference. Jesus said, "In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost," Peter came out and told us what that name was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and not to mention, Peter's got to be very, very careful here. Amen. First of all, he just received the Holy Ghost. All of them, 120 up room, all got the Holy Ghost. So God came and is now living in Peter. So be careful what you say, Peter. Not that we can't say things that we shouldn't. No, we've got the Holy Ghost. But he had just come out of the inspiration of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's come out as the spokesman of the group. And he declared what the name of the Father, Son, the Holy Ghost was. And it's Jesus Christ. He declared that. But Peter's got to be very careful. Not only did he just get the Holy Ghost, but just a few chapters earlier, Jesus gave Peter by the authority of heaven the keys to the kingdom of heaven and told him, "Whatever you bind on earth is bound in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wh what else do we need? Amen. Peter, be careful what you say cuz what you're binding here is going to be bound in heaven. Well, there can't be any contradiction because the God that's living in Peter there, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, God himself is, if he's living in Peter, then what is Peter going to say? He can't say anything else but what the scriptures already said. And that scripture is the name of the father, son, and the holy ghost, which is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not hard. It's not complicated. It just takes revelation to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I again I have I have literally had ministers tell me, "Well, I'll just take what Jesus said." I've actually had them tell me that when challenging them about about Matthew 28:19 and Acts 2:38 challenging about well I'll just take what Jesus said forgetting about all the scripture and then not only that but to ask them after that challenge them in that light with what I just told you. I said then show me one person that was ever baptized scripturally in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Show me one. There's not one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the entire Bible, in the entire New Testament, &gt;&gt; after after Pentecost, after the filling of the Holy Ghost, there's not one scripture where anybody was ever baptized, Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. And you won't find it in history until 320 AD when the Catholic Church formed and started doing it &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Satan's way of annihilating or eliminating the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. To where then everything just became about father, son, and holy ghost. &gt;&gt; That's Satan eliminating it. Although the scripture tells us that the scripture tells us that all that we are to do in word or in deed, right? to do in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I to me it's not complicated, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It just makes perfect sense because that's what the Bible says. And and you can't say you're going against what Jesus said because you're not &gt;&gt; because he said in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. And we know what that name was. Peter just clarified what the name was. Acts 238 is just a clarification of of Matthew 28:19. His name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be identified with that name in every aspect of my life, &gt;&gt; including my baptism. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Baptizing them. It is that okay now? Baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Name singular because he's God. Singular. &gt;&gt; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. All power was given unto him. All power was given unto him in heaven and earth. Amen. Now, let's go into let's go into humanity for a minute. Now, let's go into we talked about Jesus again, like we said last week, but what about us? Amen. &gt;&gt; What about me and you? Let's go over to Revelations chapter 5. pick him up again in Revelations chapter 5, gone through the church ages. You can see over in Revelation 1, uh, beautiful, but I wanted to try to condense this a little bit. If you go over to uh Revelation chapter 1, you'll see that uh let's see uh 19th verse. Write these things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall h be hereafter. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in thy right hand. Amen. Seven stars of the right hand and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars of the angels of the seven church ages in his right hand. The seven golden candlesticks. Thou saw us the seven churches. The seven church ages. The seven churches that we are a part of. A messenger to each church age. A star to coincide with every candlestick. &gt;&gt; Amen. A messenger to each age. first, second, third, on down to this age. Amen. A messenger where in his right hand. Praise the Lord. Now, look, Revelation chapter 5. I'm kind of skimming over some of this. Most we probably mostly know uh what I'm getting into, but Revelation 5. And I saw in his where? &gt;&gt; Right hand. I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. Now who is this sitting on the throne? &gt;&gt; It's God because he's got the book of redemption in his hand because remember we already went through in the parts of this series and I hate to keep hearkening back but try to bring them back to our remembrance. So, if you've if you've missed parts of this, it makes more sense if you've heard every part, but we we hearken back and go back to where we were when we were in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and what happened to Adam and what happened during the fall and what happened to the book of life. So, Adam had this book of redemption. Amen. He had this book in his hand, in his possession. It was his rightful uh uh duty because he didn't have to go through what Jesus did and what we went through to bring us back to that place again. He started out there because he was the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He was the spoken word son of God. Amen. And he had this earth in his control. He had the book of redemption in his hand. But remember what happened when he lost that book. The book didn't go into the filthy hands of Satan who could not take it. It went into the hands of the original owner. Who's the original owner? God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because everything in that book came from him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that is in that book came from God because that book is in that book contains who God is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the ex and who God is is is a part of his expression is in that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If because we have to look at it as a literal book like like we would here or or old-fashioned book if you will where they had scrolls they real they rolled up and and then they unrolled the scroll which was the equivalent of what we have as a book today. Amen. But contained in that book the equivalence of what was in that book was was God expressed. Amen. In there was the expression of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what was in that book was all the names as we go as we could go to Revelation 17. Uh in that book was all the names, the lamb's book of life, those whose names were written before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We can go to Revelation and read that. But let's keep going. U and find in there that's the expression of God. Amen. There that book was an expression and expression of God. Right? &gt;&gt; You are in that book. If you are born again and you're a part of God and uh you are God's, you are filled with the Holy Spirit. You you are a part of the family of God. You are the expression of God. You you are that expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You just come forth into life into a human body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. As God did. As God a as God was there and he looked over what he created. He sent the logos. It wasn't another person. Listen to me. It wasn't another person. It was the logos of God that went forth and brewed over the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the same logos that came in the form of Melzdc. It's the same logos that was in Jesus Christ. It's the same God all along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could just see it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the same God. &gt;&gt; That was an expression of God. This book was an expression of God. So it was in his right hand, the hand of power and authority. Again, God doesn't have a right hand, but as we have it written here, in the right hand of him that sat on the throne. That book was in the power and authority of God because it was his book. It was him expressed expression of God. If you were in that book, saints, you're an expression of God. That's all you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we go back first John 3. That seed of God that was in you, amen, was to be you from before the foundation of the world. That's when God put your name on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; That expression came forth in a human being. And each one of us have a name. We're all human beings. &gt;&gt; I mean, you talk about we talked about a minute ago about father. What if somebody come and walked through the door and said, "Hey, human being." Well, even Gabriel and Alice would walk through the door. Why? We're all human beings. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not my name. Praise the Lord. Amen. George, you've been at third. That's my name. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But that expression came into human flesh. Now, let's let's see what this book now on the right hand or the th the in the authority. See, I read that so we could understand God does not have a right hand in the authority. the power of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel. Amen. A strong angel. That's not Jesus now. Amen. This is a strong angel. A strong angel that come forth proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven nor in earth though m- an no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to even look upon it or it says look thereon. No one no man able to even look on the book much less touch it much less open it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not even look upon it. No man was able to open the book neither to look thereon. And I wept much. John wept much. John the revelator. And I wept much because no man m an no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon. Now why was John weeping? because he knew that if nobody prevailed to come forth who was worthy to take and to remove those seals and to open that book that all humanity would have been lost. &gt;&gt; Every name on that book would have been lost. &gt;&gt; All humanity would have been lost. Oh my, what a pickle. No wonder John was weeping. No wonder John was crying because I believe he knew his name was in that book. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I think he also he also knew that all the names that were the redemptive names are in that book. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know what my name is in that book. I just know the earthly name my parents gave me. Amen. But whatever my heavenly name is, which I'm assuming is not going to be George N. Bennett III, whatever that is is in that book. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And unless that book were to be opened, those seals to be taken off and that book to be opened, all of that was in there would stayed sealed up. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because remember when we go back again to the Garden of Eden? When was it that they were to come forth? Amen. If you go back to creation, when were they to come forth? when their name was spoke, when their name was spoke, that's when they were to come forth. &gt;&gt; When God created man, he gave him the book. Now, again, I go back here. Uh, please help me, Lord, if I'm I try not to venture without authority, but I I I can't help but look at the scripture and see what God was doing in the Garden of Eden and where he's restoring us back to, what the purpose in the beginning was when when Adam had the book. Why would Adam have the book if he wasn't responsible for opening the book and reading the names as each one was to come forth in his decree time and season? &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? &gt;&gt; Amen. But as that name was spoke is when it came forth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't if it was a waiting for that time, then what what are we doing here? You could have been back 3,000 years ago or whatever it was. But it was a decreed time and season. We talked about and read last week at the fullness of time. At the fullness of the appointed appointment of a specific time, this was this is when that was to happen. At that specific time that we were to come forth, but because the book is sealed, those names are sealed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're in the book. The expression of God is still in there. &gt;&gt; But unless it's open and revealed and expressed, then what will we to do? Amen. Live in the dark. &gt;&gt; No man was worthy. Nobody. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And it's no wonder John John was upset. He was weeping because no man was found worthy. Not even to even look on the book. &gt;&gt; But oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Around 2,000 years ago, we had a kinsman redeemer come. Yes. &gt;&gt; And fulfill every purpose and point of a kinsman redeemer from the from the Old Testament and became our kinsman redeemer. Not because he's a Bennett of a a Katy or whatever your last name. It wasn't because of that, but be- but because he came into human form like one of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the form of a man. The Bible says in the form of man. in the form in the likeness in the likeness of sinful flesh. His flesh wasn't sinful, but it was in the likeness as a kinsman to us. He became in human form. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God for that kinsman, friend, because the fifth verse says, "And one of the elders said unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our kinsbury redeemer has come forth to claim what is his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the ones that he died for. &gt;&gt; This is the ones he went to Calvary for. This is the ones he gave his life for was the names in that book so he could come forth with the authority and power and take that book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. Now I know it says the line of the tribe of Judah, but look what's happened when I beheld. I lo and lo, in the midst of the throne of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders stood a lamb. Amen. Because lion represents judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when John turned around, he saw mercy. &gt;&gt; The lamb, the blood of the lamb represents mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he looked, he saw a lamb as it had been slaying. Bloody lamb having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that our kinsman redeemer was found worthy to take that book. Amen. To take out of the right hand of the ownership of God. And he was able to worthy to take the book. Worthy to loosen the seals. And and because it was him, that lamb, the mercy of God, open that book so that the names could be revealed, so that the names could be opened, so that the names could be exposed and the expression of God could be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, we go over to Revelation 10 in the right hand, power, authority. He saw that book, took that book because he was cold. Could you imagine? Can you imagine what what John's weeping turned into? &gt;&gt; He went from weeping and crying to rejoicing and celebrating and shouting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I know sometimes people probably look and say, "You ought to keep it down a little bit. How can you?" I I mean, my question to them is, "How can you?" I I I just &gt;&gt; how when you know what God has done, when you know where you are in that book, when you know what God has given to, how can you be quiet? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How can you be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I imagine all of heaven heard John shouting and worshiping and praising. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Revelation 10. And I saw another mighty angel &gt;&gt; come down. Now, another mighty angels beyond the the the uh the the church ages. We went through the church ages then and we went through the plagues and then and those things and trumpets and we get to the 10th verse. So, when he talks about another mighty angel coming down, he says, "A mighty angel come down." Now, not the strong angel. Amen. But a mighty angel because the strong angel was declaring or proclaiming who is worthy to take this book and who is worthy to loose the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But another mighty angel come down from heaven and this is what differentiates him. Clothes with a cloud. You find him over in Revelation one. Same way. And a rainbow was upon his head. the covenant angel which is Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The covenant angel with co clothed in a cloud as we've seen him and a rainbow upon his head as we know that covenant is. Amen. You can go back in the Old Testament and see when the rainbow came forth. And I know the the homosexuals have tried to steal that but it doesn't belong to them. It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It belongs to God. &gt;&gt; This is God's token. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I Heath It's just been perverted the way it has in the world today. But this is God stoken. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A rainbow upon his head. That coveted angel. His face was where the sun is and feet as pillars of fire. And who others could that be but but Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ. Now standing there. Amen. His face is a sun. His feet is pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book. And it was what? Open. So that means between the fifth ver chapter and the 10th chapter, the book's been opened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God that book was open. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. A little book opened. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. Why? Because he had all power in heaven and in earth. Amen. The sea and the land. It was a complete total conquering through the authority and power given complete total conquering of heaven and earth of the earth uh of uh ground and earth sea over everything over everybody complete power complete authority. Amen. On one foot on land, one foot on sea on the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, I heard a voice which uh from heaven, saying unto me, sell those things which the seven thunders uttered, write them not. The angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven. Swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven and earth, uh heaven, and the things that are therein, the earth, the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer. Amen. Amen. No more a delay of time. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does the scripture tell us? Matthew Matthew tells us that for the elect's sake, this time end time should be cut short. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it says otherwise there'd be no flesh sake. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you look around, you wonder if it hadn't got to that point. But thank God it's not. And it won't be. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; At least not while the bride's here. Amen. When she's gone, it's a different story, right? &gt;&gt; You have chaos. And but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he had declared to his servants, the prophets. Now, don't get me wrong. I believe that seventh angel was a seventh angel through his entire life. Amen. Just like you were born to be who you were for your entire life. But just like Jesus, just like every one of us, he had to come to his place of adoption, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He had to come to his place of adoption just like all the rest of us did &gt;&gt; or do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to read something a quote from the breach. I know remember you all know brother Brand preached God in simplicity before he even began to approach the seals before the breach was God in simplicity. Amen. The next service now it wasn't in Jeffersonville. It was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. But the next service after the seventh seal was preached in Jeffersonville. He preached again God in simplicity. He bookend he bookended. Is that a word? Sorry, I'm not a math English teacher. He bookended I'm going to say it's a word. He bookended the seals with God in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe that was an accident. Of course, I don't believe anything God does is an accident, but the the seals but uh the God in simplicity. But the the second message was the breach. And notice the breach was preached. Amen. before the first seal was opened, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because we know that each day that angel come into that room and revealed or opened to brother Brandham that seal for that day, &gt;&gt; for that time, for that night, each day. Amen. He didn't come in all seven right there. No. When when brother Brandham left the pull pit on the night of the first seal, he didn't know any more about the second than anybody else. Amen. It was the next day in that room again that the angel visited him and gave him that the second seal. Amen. But look now, so in in in in setting that up because I'm going to close here in just a few minutes. In setting that up, let's look at this breach this quote for a minute. Now, keep in mind, Brother Brandham had to be adopted just like the rest of us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. When that time was, I don't know. Amen. I have an inkling. I I have a suspicion. I have a feeling. Amen. But I'm not going to say it that there there's some things that that I feel that I have a revelation or something the Lord has showed me maybe that that I've shared with you uh such as maybe the sinking of California things the timing and things but I I this I just I feel checked. I I just don't think I should I'm going to not going to give you my feeling about this. But I am going to read you this. you draw your own conclusions in the breach March 1963. And he saw one sitting upon the throne. Now he's reading or or he's talking about the scripture we just read in Revelation 5. And he saw one sitting upon the throne with this book in his hand in his right hand. Brother says, "Think of it now." And then in this book was the title deed of redemption. Every name the redemption. And it was sealed with seven seals. And then an angel came forth, a strong angel. Look at this now. A strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who was worthy to open the book or to take the book? Who was able to open the seals? Who was able to open this book? See, the angel asked it. &gt;&gt; John saw it and he said, "Now, oh, who's worthy? Let him." I'm still reading the quote. Let him. Brother Brandon pauses. He says, "Oh my, maybe I'm just feeling this way." So, what was he feeling? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, it's the stirring of the Holy Ghost. That's what it was. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God moving on him. When that when that when that tone is struck, friend, &gt;&gt; uh maybe maybe you can see it in me sometimes or other ministers. When that tone is struck, it's it things change. &gt;&gt; Things change. But it changed. And you know, it changed a lot in his ministry, especially when he's praying for the sick. But in this specific point, he stopped He literally stopped and said, "Let him." And he stopped. He paused and he said, "Oh my, maybe I'm just feeling this way, but let him," said the angel, "let him." Here is the book of redemption. Here is the plan of redemption. Here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed. For here is the title deed to redemption of the whole heavens and earth. Let him come forward if he will. Oh my. He said, "Now speak or forever hold his peace. Let him come forward and claim this book." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is worthy to do it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe I'm just feeling this way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What was happening, saints? There was a stirring in heaven going on during this period of time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just like I believe there's a stirring going on right now because we're about to go home. Amen. &gt;&gt; This bride is about to get out of this place. There's a stirring going on. There was a stirring going on in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. this this Revelation five and the vindication and revelation and actually manifestation of Revelation 5 was taking place. And as and as that book was taken by our kinsman redeemer and as each seal was loosed and removed from that book of redemption, the the the the shall we say mystery contained in each one of those seals was brought to a prophet. No wonder he's standing there saying, "Oh, maybe it's just me." But let him come. I'll let you go with that for a minute, but let me read you this quote. Brother talks about many times on out here in Sabino Canyon, is there pray? He had his hands lifted up. I believe I've been there. But you know that's just just a mountain. But it's in your heart. That's what in your heart towards Christ that's what matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not being in Sabino Canyon or wherever else. It's your heart in Christ. That's that's what matters. But he was there. Hands up praying. And a sword come and struck his hand. Which hand? The right hand. Amen. The right hand. And I don't know if brother was brother right hand. The left hand I don't know. in his right hand though power authority to a man that actually literally has a right hand now I wondered what it meant that is the king's sword a voice spoke out and said that is the king's sword he said I wonder what that meant that is the king's sword and I thought if I would have said if if it that voice would have said a king's sword it might have been that I must would have understood it but it said the king's sword sword, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But what is that sword? That sword's the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a as we read over in Revelation one, as he had the seven stars in his hand and he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, what came out of his mouth? Sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sword came out of his mouth. That was Jesus Christ. The sword. Hear ye him. The sword came out of his mouth. Praise the Lord. Now, this sword that came in his hand said this was the king's sword. The king, not a king, the king. There's only one the king. There's a lot of a kings. Amen. Basketball players and uh rock and roll stars and they call a lot of people king. &gt;&gt; But there's only one the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The king. Sorry. So, I may not have this right. He said, "But I thought there's only one the king. That's God. And his sword it is sharper than any two-edged sword. See, and ye abide in me. My word is in you. And I thought in a dueling. See, I don't understand one word of it. He says dueling. I don't know much about it either, but I don't understand one word of dueling or one principle of dueling, but the best my understanding the life strike, the knife striking a cross, and then finally the swords then locked together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. which we do with the devil every day. &gt;&gt; This enemy and you lock swords together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like this. And you, Amen, you locking swords with the enemy every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you don't lock swords with the enemy there every day, saints, I wonder about your walk with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I wonder about your uh your position in Christ because those that are born again and that we in Christ uh that devil is relentless. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To every one of us. &gt;&gt; That sword's locked. He says together. &gt;&gt; He said the enemy you lock swords like this. Then it takes the strength of the man dueling because see his sword would be pointed to my heart and mine to his. Amen. locked together, but they're locked and our knives striking each other and then they strike and then the swords come together and and the one that can shut the other one down, the sword goes straight into their heart. So it takes, listen now as I close here. So it takes even though the sword being the word, the sword is the word. Even though the sword is the word, listen now. Even though the sword is the word, it takes the hand of strong faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To hold it there and to bring it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, let's go back. I I I I don't know. I've never known of anybody in my lifetime greater of a greater or stronger faith than the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know of anybody. But if you go back to the scripture in Revelation 5, what was the what what was the angel that was proclaiming who is worthy? I mean uh uh the the uh the the strong angel, the strong angel that was proclaiming, Amen. who is worthy is a strong angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does it take? It takes a strong hand of faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To hold that sword right there and to get it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that didn't just pertain to Brother Brandham. That pertains to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To stay strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That when your swords do lock with that enemy, you have the strong faith enough to drive it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me, Satan. You have no right to me or my family or God's property. You have been exposed and you have no right here. You take that to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he going to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. He has to leave. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He has to flee. &gt;&gt; There's nothing he can do about that. He's defeated at that point. Praise the Lord. But it takes a strong hand of faith. It takes a strong hand to drive it to the heart of the enemy. Praise the Lord. That angel was a strong angel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. It said, "Who is worthy?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Who is it today, saints? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to be us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It has to be the bride. I don't say us by our church. I mean by God's people. We're all a part of God's people. Yes. We're part of the family of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about the family of God. international, around the world, whoever they are. Amen. It takes us as God's family, praise the Lord, to to take this as strong faith and drive it to the heart of the enemy. Take that sword, take that word and drive it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; You can't take anything hybrided. Amen. You can't take anything made up. You can't take anything manufactured by somebody in a seminary somewhere. You have to take that true, pure revelated word, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to take it to the heart of the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Else you're you're dueling with a rubber sword. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might have strong faith, but when you go to drive it to the heart of the enemy, it just goes &gt;&gt; just bounce off his chest because you don't have the the sword of the king, the word to take it to the heart of the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's got to be the word. &gt;&gt; It's got to be strong hand of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Strong hand of faith to drive it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Again, I I I don't know of anybody. I've never run across anybody that had stronger faith than than brother Brandham did. &gt;&gt; And look where it look gotten us today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. because it all comes down to and belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And finding and being in our position, our place that God has adopted us into. &gt;&gt; Amen.
