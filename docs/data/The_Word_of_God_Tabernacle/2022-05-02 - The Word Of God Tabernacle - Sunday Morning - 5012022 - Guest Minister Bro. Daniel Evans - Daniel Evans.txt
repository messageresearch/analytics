amen thank you lord jesus we'll go to the lord in prayer now amen take up the prayer requests you might have i had heard this week now uh maybe thanks buddy maybe um uh brother wilson or some others could help me here but i had heard this week that brother harold hildebrandt passed away and that is true so i had been unable to verify i've been kind of busy and i've checked on facebook a little here and there i don't i'm very sold them on facebook so but i looked to see if i could find any verification of it or anything and i couldn't so thank you for the dan brother wilson for verifying that for me that brother harold hildebrand of those probably most of us all know brother harold from canada precious brother um and he passed away this week so let's please remember the family the friends church there uh in edmonton i believe he's still in edmonton buddy in edmonton um so let's remember them in prayer if you would it's certainly a great loss last week we had prayer for brother mike patterson who had a stroke up in phoenix and as a result looks like he's closing his church doors so you know friend it just as time continues to roll on this will continue to happen i've talked to brother roger many times you know brother roger collins family and baron tabernacle and i said you know brother roger it may get to the time where there's not a single person alive that knew brother branham or was here during that time or you know all the old timers are going away so amen it's up to us to continue to press that battle yes and if it's after us brother dan you're about my age it's after us and it'll be up to my grandson and those others to keep it going amen i praise the lord we don't know but you know brother branham said 60 years ago could go another 100 years and not break scripture at all amen in fact i heard him say the other day uh it was well maybe i'll save that for later but he said it was a hundred years after the prophecy that it actually came to pass so uh we got another 40 years if that happens you don't know but we don't know that's the whole point so amen but let's again remember brother uh harold's family and the church and there in prayer if you would um and prayer also not with us today is the by steroids brother art and sister stride on feeling well they texted and said that they will the whole family i guess woke up not feeling well

she's not been feeling well so brother dennis and brother danny aren't here with us this morning brother danny's had bouts with the uh with the allergies and i told him i said well i sure know how you feel because that devil's been buffeting me uh it's been tough sometimes wake up can't even breathe but brother danny stayed at home streaming but i'll read you what brother dennis sent to me here it says please remember leah in prayer the last few weeks where depression and anxiety is really fighting her and she needs uh she needed brother dennis to stay home with her today to be with her we're agreeing for total deliverance from the conditions uh peace of mind that only jesus christ can give amen so please remember you all know uh his wife sister leah so let's just remember her in prayer the lord would just touch her keep his hand on her and touch her amen the one that we had here was a praise report so we'll save that for just in a few moments amen but those are the prayer requests i

other day and thankful good to see you here okay praise the lord glad you do it better amen god's good to us his name is amen so we're thankful to have brother dan with us here today amen and want to have you give him plenty of time today so brother dan if you want to come over we'll sing um only believe brother dan comes here this morning preach what's on his heart amen no that's all that we care about let's have a minister if i didn't if i didn't have the liberty to tell a man that he could preach whatever god gave him he wouldn't be behind this pool that's the truth so i believe that the invitation the lord give for brother dan to come that he'll give brother then to speak what we need this morning you believe that i do amen praise the lord so this thing is for the dance [Music] all things are possible [Music] oh [Music] i appreciate that brother it's a humbling thing that you'd say that i have liberty amen to speak here and i pray that that there wouldn't let you down no i must have prayed i'll pray that i wouldn't let the lord die amen there you go sister i appreciate that song that was good that i'm reaching out to you you know there was there was a time that jesus always taught his disciples he taught them to follow in his footsteps yes and he taught them how to handle certain situations and he told them that one day that this same spirit that's in me is going to come in you yes and there was a time when when jesus was out walking on the water and one of his disciples walked out to meet him and he didn't quite have the faith and he he started to sing and he reached out to the lord jesus and like you said his arm was not too short amen the lord jesus reached down there and grabbed him back and how many of us have been in that situation you know we've tried our best to follow in the footsteps of our lord jesus and we just fail but he knows we're going to fail and he reaches down there and his arm's not too short sister he he grabs us and he pulls us back up amen i'm so thankful amen for the grace of god praise the lord yes this morning i woke up and and just praying about what i was going to say today and i made the mistake of getting on my phone and looking in the news and their friends this is a bad time yeah this is a time that the world has never seen i'm telling you not up on that up on the news they had the usa today they were talking about censoring speech and all of you heard about probably elon musk and everything that he's doing and buying these these social media platform and all that but they had usa today had one of the final nominations that if it wasn't the uh the final one that they chose of the woman of the year for usa today and i looked at it and it was one of the most hideous things i've ever seen it was a man dressed up as a woman and and we think about when i always wondered when i was a kid i always wondered that brother branham would say as it was in the days of lot in the sodom condition i always wondered that why did brother branham take that scripture in luke 17 and apply it to his ministry and as a young man i didn't understand that as it was in the days of life why why is that applied to brother brando's ministry but now i see yes i can see that it was we are living in today where that spirit is so strong and everybody's afraid of it you notice you notice a lot true when when those men those angels came and visited lot and his family and and the mobs came he was the mayor of the city brother wilson he was a politician yeah he was up there and he was afraid of that yeah he was afraid of that lobby he was afraid of those people and we see that today yeah we see these things manifesting themselves and i was just i was so sad this morning that this once great country yes it's falling into this mess and it's it's it's sun that's going into and it just it breaks my heart and and i see i know that the scriptures teach us that when these things start to pass that we look up yes because our redemption is drawing nigh right sir but it's it's also a sad thing yes it is it's a sad thing of what's happening absolutely but we do we do look up in this and the word also teaches us that this is the time that we should just cling so much more closely together yes and that's what i was thinking about this morning in the past few days is we need to cling that much closer together in these last days in this time yes like never before very true but i believe that we in the christian population in general is failing in that matter yeah and that will be my message this morning is i want to talk about christ's square in the church amen and i'll get there and get to where christ prayed for this unity but first i want to read a scripture if we could stand for a minute and turn to saint john chapter 10. and again friends i'm honored to be here i i appreciate brother bennett and the love that you've shown me and the confidence amen that you've asked me to come speak i also did a great speed my friend wrote scott over there with the wilson system and arlene it's always good to see you saint john chapter 10 verse 11. this is our lord jesus speaking he says this he says i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life amen but he that is a hireling and not the shepherd whose own sheep whose own the sheep are not see it the wolf coming and leaving the sheep and flee and the wolf catches them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleet because he's a hireling and careth not for the sheep i am the good chef amen and know my sheep yes and have known of mine right as a father knoweth me even so i even so i the father and i laid down my life for the sheep amen now listen to this and other sheep i have which are not of this bowl them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold may god add the blessings amen to the reading of his word you may be seated i was uh when i was walking in i saw your book brother ben and i i didn't know that you wrote a book i saw that the title in there is the root of bitterness and i thought it was very fitting for what i'm going to say today i haven't read it yet but i'd like to read it good yeah i mean i wasn't hinting thank you i'm looking forward to it there is there's so much bitterness there's so much division within the body of what we call the body of christ today and it's it's a scary thought and we look back at what jesus said here in john chapter 10 and he says this he says he says there shall be one fold and one shepherd amen and yet we have all these different groups we have all of these different divisions of christianity and all these divisions now within the message within the so-called message that god sent a prophet to turn to call the people out of the denominational system and it's a spirit of that segregating system where we're better than this person or this group is better than that group amen because he sent this prophet to pull us out of that yes and then friends i fear i don't fear i think we have we've gone right back into it amen we did it we see in the the apostles time that there was this beautiful unity which i'll talk about for a while and then they started dividing yes and then we see separation and then we see we see luther he comes and he reforms and then they start they form a denomination out of luther we see all these different things through the through the past and then god sends a prophet an end-time prophet and we do the same thing yeah and now we have all these different denominations within brother branham's message and i know brother branham said that this message couldn't denominate but he also said the bible could denominate and it can't the word denominated it's us that had those spirits feared and it it uh it's something that we need to be careful of it's something that we need to overcome yes yeah yeah i was out yesterday there's a there's a man about my age that i've been witnessing too and uh about six months now i've been dealing with this man he's a christian man and he knew that i get away and i pray and he asked me he said will you take me to that place that you pray he said i really i really i need to get right with god there's things there's questions i have in my heart i said sure of course i will and he's told me before he says you know he says he says i've been i became a christian a while ago and and he looks to me as kind of a leader but then he he looks at me he asks he asks questions about the word and he'll go to church you know the pastor will say a certain thing and he says it doesn't quite feel right well what about this scripture and then we have these discussions and he wanted to go up and he wanted to pray yesterday which we did we spent a good part of the day up in the mountains praying and just to ourselves and sitting within a i don't know within 50 feet of each other but just seeking the lord on our own quiet timing for the lord and as we were going back um one of the one of the questions he had was that about his career and i asked him i said i said mark what about your career where do you think that what's the direction you think you'll go now and he says you know i felt like the lord told me as we were up there just to stay where i'm at and be patient because because things were going to change good and uh we were walking down the hill and down the mountain and i was in front there's a trail and he was behind me and and he says brother daniel he says uh what about you he said i know and he's come to the church but listen to the tabernacle a couple times and um enjoyed it and he says where do you see you he said you asked me where you see me he said how about you and he says i'm not talking about your work i'm talking about your ministry he says where do you see that going and i was he says what do you hope to accomplish going down the mountain and i said i said you know what if i could have anything i said i would like to be able to take the little group of fellowships that the lord has given me and the people that i know i would like to bring these people together i would like to bring them together in love and immunity and somehow i'd like to have a role in that and i said you know what i also would like to see i would like to see other men of god do the same thing whether they be in the baptist denomination or whether they be in the mega churches or the or the different churches in all of christianity i would like to see men of god raise up and bring people together even though they might not see things the same even though they may not have the same doctrines but they all believe in jesus christ and you know what he said he said that's impossible and you know what he's right he said that's impossible he said that could never happen he's been a christian long enough i guess to know it and i said but it is possible because jesus prayed and i uh got me thinking and i thought you know that's that's what i will minister on tomorrow is on the unity of the church in christ's prayer let's turn to ephesians 4. ephesians chapter 4 verse 1. the apostle paul is speaking he says i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with lowliness with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love right keep your place there friends forbearing having patience with one another you know if if i'm here today and i'm ministering i'll probably say something that may not resonate well with you that you may disagree with but i ask you have patience with yeah have patience with me because paul says here have patience with one another amen and we may make mistakes but we're all christians we have that same shepherd amen right i'm always asking my wife to do that with me to have patience with me because i'm not perfect and we make mistakes yeah endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and the father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen and friends i must admit until recently i have never considered the importance of unity among the body you know we as always we're thinking about the third pole you know we're thinking about these things that are prophesied to happen we're thinking about the squeeze that's supposed to come on the people we're thinking about all these different things we're thinking about doing great signs and great wonders and great miracles and we're thinking about those things but we neglect the most important thing that we can do which is love one another amen and have this unity among one another yes right i don't think we should all be one church and i'm not saying that but we should be one body right amen yes each member of the body has a different role and the same with our churches each church we may fit in well in this church and we're in the lord's will but that doesn't make this church better than another church and that other church doesn't look at this church and say that we're better we have more understanding that's right or whatever god's placed each of us yes and we need to make sure that we're in that place amen that he's placed us yes brother true we hear so often of california sinking and we hear so often of the pope and these different things but i think that we neglect the most important thing and it's not an easy thing to love one another right we need to have patience with one another as paul said amen there was there was a time in history that we call it the day of pentecost today pentecost was one of the greatest days in history because that is the day that jesus christ himself entered in to the body of man and went and they went out and they did the same works yes that jesus did amen but you'll notice in at the day of pentecost they were in one place it's not prophesied that we was one place now but they were with one accord yes they had one purpose amen a brother uh texted me this morning and uh he said uh you preaching this morning and i said i said yeah i'll be bennett's and he said what are you preaching and i said i said you know the body and uh he said he said that he said well he says that's a big subject let me uh let me read what he said here i'll read it off my phone his brother joe do you know brother gentlemen um he said this he said he asked me this he said what builds unity and i said a common goal and he says amen he says it's usually when we experience an incredible monster of a shared problem and that's what drives us together and that's what drove those people at the day of pentecost together he they were running from the jews they were persecuted and then they come into this place in one mine and one accord and then the holy spirit felt they had one purpose and that purpose was to promote jesus christ was to introduce others to jesus christ let's turn to uh james chapter one and uh i'm going to get rolling here in a minute but in james chapter 1 verse 22 we talk about unity and it's you say well well daniel you're coming and and you're talking about this unity we all know that our church is unified our church we all love one another and and we do but we are not there yet right i don't think that we're even close amen i think that there's a lot of more that we have to do and it says this in james 1 22 he says wherefore laying apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness in your scofield bible that says overflowing wickedness and received with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your soul yes be doers of the word and not hear zone you're deceiving your own selves if there is no desire in the church to grow to change to be molded into the stature of a perfect man i don't want to be part of that amen i don't want to be part of a church i was just walking along and saying oh we're just waiting for something to happen right if you're just waiting for something to happen and you're not doing something as james said here guess what nothing's gonna happen amen we're gonna keep going on and nothing nothing will ever happen we will just keep going this is this this is what the prophet said this is a quote from we would see jesus he said and i believe that there is the need of healing tonight more than physical healing i believe it's a spiritual healing for the sickest body i know of amen the body of jesus christ this is the sickest body i know that's a bold state that's right he goes on here it's so broke up in so many different denominations and factions here and so we're trying to do our best by the gospel to heal that broken body that all people might come together with one great unity amen i don't mean you have to leave your church and make and all of them make one organization stay in your organization it doesn't hurt anything but be brothers while you're in your organization amen i was a baptist as you know and i'm still a baptist i'm a pentecostal baptist since i've received the holy spirit you see when brother branham was saying that he says yeah i'm still i'm still part of him he said but now i'm drawing the circle bigger yeah now i'm i'm bringing all you in before i was just a baptist and i was in my own little circle but now i receive the holy spirit and i'm drawing my circle bigger amen with all of with all of you all right brother branham came out of that organization but he didn't leave it right remember my scripture on john takes 10 16 he says and other sheep i have which are not of this fold yes them also i must bring that they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd amen hear so many people talk about you we hear so many talk about unity as long as you're on my grounds yeah as long as you do what i say as long as you believe the doctrines that i believe then we will have unity in matthew 23 matthew 23 verse 1 he says this and jesus and then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses's seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their words yes but they say and they do not yes so we're saying listen to what they say maybe i could say today they preach unity listen to what they say and do what they say but they're not doing it amen [Music] for they bind heavy burdens ingredients to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves were not moved yes then one of their fingers they're not even going to try they're not going to reach out no but all their works they do for to be seen of men they may broad their phylactes and enlarge the borders of their garments they love the uppermost rooms at the feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the market and to be called the men rabbi rabbi but be not called rabbi for one is your master even christ and ye are all brethren amen a love for that yes now god might give a variety of gifts different different gifts to us and each of us have different roles but he uses all of these gifts into in into one body we can't i can't be a brother bennett but then it can be me that's right we each have our gifts and we if we can apply those gifts to the unity of the body yes then we will make we'll make progress yes amen so jesus time was getting laid in his ministry it was the last week that he would be alive in his mortal flesh goes he comes in to the city on sunday like a triumphant king he was on the donkey and people were throwing palm leaves down and throwing their garments in front of the donkey they were they were rejoicing over this this king that was coming into the city they were waving their palm leaves they were so excited yes and jesus comes in to the city and he has a big week you know what happened during that week and then on thursday burton was starting to weigh on our little young man 33 years old the burden was starting to weigh on and he knew what was going to happen disciples went man this is great this is really good finally he is going to be put on the throne of israel yes and he is going to take the kingdom for himself they had it in their mind how it was going to be sure right but jesus brings them into this room and they have their last supper jesus starts telling him things and this is in john chapter 13 jesus starts telling them he starts preaching them a sermon over supper and he says things like he says little children he says yet a little while i'm going to be with you i'm just going to be with you for a little while and he says where i go you can't go and they're sitting at the supper table they're wondering what is going on what is he telling us these are different words that he's speaking we see the burden that is on him and then he says he says this he says a new commandment 13 34 he says a new commandment i give to you command me that you love one another amen as i have loved you that you love one another by this all men shall know you are my disciples amen if you have love one for another right that's a commandment amen it's not a it's not a prophecy in mark 16 he prophesied that these signs were followed this is a commandment yes this is something for us to do amen it takes an effort and then in john 14 he's still sitting around the table and he's talking to his disciples and he's giving them instructions and there's things that they don't understand and philip asks him he says he says lord show us the father and the lord jesus says he says he says have i been so long with you that you don't know me philip he that has seen me has seen the father amen i'm going to refer back to this scripture in a little bit it's very very important that that jesus was so close with the father that he says if you see me you see the father he says come on philip he says i've been with you and you've listened to me preach all this time and you still don't know the father you're still going to ask me that question just look how close that the son and the father are now one i want that to stick in your minds because i'm going to refer back to that in a little while and in verse 16 he uh he tells he tells them he says and he says this strange thing and they must have thought okay jesus is going somewhere and then there's going to be another jesus coming there's going to be another christ coming he says this he says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter he may abide with you forever yes in the spirit of truth what is going on so he's not going to be with us and he is going to be with us and he's going to leave and and somebody else is going to come what's going on then he says again i will ask the father and he will give you another comforter what is going on here they're sitting at this table and they don't understand it doesn't compute what's going on yeah and then in john then he uh he tells him this he says don't let your hearts be troubled amen he says i'm gonna go away amen but i'm gonna come to you yes so they're still not understanding they're sitting at the table and then he says this he says well let's get him let's get up arise and let's go so they get up and they're in jerusalem and they start walking down the mountain into the valley and they're headed for this place this place this garden called goodson and he's got his people with them and and he's walking along and he's instructing them and he tells them he says again he says this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you yes he's repeating what he said at the supper table he keeps he keeps going down and they're talking and he says and he says oh and he says he says the time is coming when whosoever kills you you're gonna think that they're doing god's service yeah true this is gonna be hard in fact you're gonna suffer the same faith that i suffered that's good everything's okay and then they continue down this journey and they they didn't obviously they didn't understand these things and he says you're gonna suffer he says but but this comforter is going to come and and he's promising these things that are going to happen and that they get down to the bottom of the mouth and he says this you know we close in prayer in church you know he always closes in prayer in church jesus closes in prayer yeah after after he had he had the last supper and after he gives the sermon going down he closes in prayer on john in john chapter 17. and i want to read that to us this is very very important and this is what i wanted to get to when i talk about the unity of the body in john chapter 17 verse nine jesus has them there and he says let's pray he says this this is father in verse nine he says i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me yes for they are thine amen and all mine are thine and thy are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are amen yes now i just talked about phillip and i talked about the godhead and i talked about how close the father and the son are they're so close that we as message believers the trinitarian group they they separate them a little bit not much they can't even figure out it's like well it's god in three different personalities and we as message believers we have a higher revelation of that and we say no it's the same god and he just represents himself in different ways yes i'm i'm my father i'm my my father's son i'm my son's father and i'm my wife's husband i have different roles but i'm the same person amen so we as believers we have a higher revelation we see how close this father and this son are yes are you with me very close all right so close that we can't even separate them amen we can't even separate the father and the son because the higher the revelation that you have the closer the father and the son are right so let me read that again it says this that they may be one as we are born that the people will be so close right they will be so united that they will be as close as father as you and i are amen we are not there we're going to get there i don't believe jesus would have prayed yes let's keep going verse 12 while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept but none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of this world of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should just take them out of the world but that thou should keep them keep them from evil amen they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth yes as thou has sent me into the world even so i have i also sent them into the world yes and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth amen neither pray i thee for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word there i am there you are yes jesus right now is praying for you and me yes he's saying for those that hear the word by this gospel by these gospels right here those that hear this word i pray for them also that they might be one so we're included they can't just say that that's for the apostles that the apostolic age ended that's for all of us yes and it says here and again he makes this statement and in glory which thou gives me i mean let me go to verse 21 that they all may be one as thou father art and me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sinned praise the lord a very important statement and jesus will repent we'll repeat that in a minute and the glory which thou gave us me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and that would mean that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou hast loved me amen and friends in reading that i really never did i never did see the importance of the unity i never did see the importance of jesus prayer there as i said before we always we always think of these these great miracles that are supposed to happen but the way that jesus is going to prove that he is the messiah the way that jesus is going to prove to the world that he is the son of god i'll read it again i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect in one yes and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou hast loved me yes that the world may know that you've sent me lord look at their unity yes look at how close these people are together look at how much these people love each other look how much they work they work together yes they have one purpose and by that he will know that i am the messiah people will know that jesus is the messiah we were amen we were sitting around when i worked for the voice of god we were the lights went out at voice of god the power went out and we all got together and we were in the biggest room we're in the big the mail room of course it got the biggest room you know the big room there that there's there's the benches and all of us employees were in there because the lights were out you know we didn't have anything to do our computers were all so brother joseph and brother billy paul were sitting on on one of the tables and we're all just kind of fellowshipping in there and brother joseph asked for the billy paul he says he says billy he says tell us something about daddy tell us something about brother so brother billy says this he says i was the closest person to brother brown in the whole world yeah i traveled with brother branham everywhere he went i was always with him i knew what he liked to eat i knew the way he liked to drive and the cars they liked i knew everything about him but even i didn't know brother branham's friends from excellent how can can any of us say that amen he didn't even know his friends from his enemies brother branham and and many like my family was very very close to brother branham brother branham made them feel so good he encouraged them so much and he was such a great man in their eyes that many people mistook brother branham for the lord jesus right right it's an easy mistake to make because he was such a great man sure he made them feel so good he had such love he had he wanted such unity and they saw brother branham as this great man and there's nobody that could produce that except for the lord jesus they saw the lord jesus working through him amen they saw the love of god working through that man when peter when when the the day of pentecost had come and they received the holy spirit and all these miracles were going on peter full of the holy ghost was was would walk along and they saw that love so much in peter that even his shadow walking by them they would get healed amen and it was because of that love that peter had right because they had that excitement in peter that they knew that he wasn't he didn't have an agenda he didn't have a he didn't have his own sermon to preach he wanted jesus christ yes he wanted to preach jesus christ to the people and that's what worked that's what made it happen praise the lord yes verse number number 24. jesus continues his prayer he says this father i will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where i am yes that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the word how sweet that jesus calls his prayers praise the lord he closes his praises father i love them so much wherever i am i want them to yes amen our righteous father the world hath not known me but i have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that they love that the love where until thou hast loved me maybe in them and i am yes not because of the miracles not because the great doctrines not because of the seven seals not because of the ages not because the third poll not because of those things but because of the love that christ had for us and the unity that we have with each other every love that we have with each other imagine if we could work together as a body my body my feet have a different role than my hands do imagine if we could work together just as a little group that we are imagine what we could accomplish if it was in perfect harmony amen it was in perfect harmony at the day of pentecost they had they were in one mind and one accord they went out 3 000 people 5 000 people came thousands of people came to know the lord jesus yes there was a there was a brother um in in canada pastor called me when i was working voice of god and uh you know the billboards that we used to put up the message.com and the message.com is an introduction to brother brown's ministry and this brother called up voice of god he's a tapes only that that group yeah and i call them denominations and that probably offends people but it is it's a separation sure and and you have you have this tapes only group and they call they called and he wanted to put up a billboard in his city and he wanted the billboard i don't know if you've seen the message.com but there's there's we have a picture of an apple up there and it says on there the original sin and anytime you put something like that up of course you know they're going to go on and type in the message okay what does this mean so he said you know what he says i want that billboard up he says i've found a place that we can put it up i want to put that billboard here so great we'll do the artwork for you we'll get it uploaded to the billboard company and they'll get it up there so they uh he did that we put we put the billboard up this church sponsored it and i get a phone call from another pastor in this city that city's like tucson there's a whole bunch of churches from another message pastor and he says what are you guys doing he says you put up a billboard in my city he says it's like one block from my church he says he says he says you know i don't appreciate that he says he says we have to answer these questions and all that i said well brother i said you know just settle down. i said those questions actually come to us and then we send out lists of churches if people want to go to churches he says he says you you won't suffer the persecution he says we suffer the persecution for putting stuff like that there up there like that so we had a spirited conversation it wasn't it wasn't uh hostile spirit so yeah so we we talked we talked for a little while and then a few days later i get contacted from a lady in the same city and she says saw your billboard the message.com she said so you're saying that the serpent and eve had relations i was like okay here we go the biggest criticism that brother branham's message gets from the outside is the serpenty doctor he's like well yeah you know and i went into genesis chapter three and explained explain these different these different scriptures and then she comes back and she says ever since i read that in the bible not from your website but ever since i read that in the bible i knew that that was the case i knew exactly what this was and she says i want to go to a church that teaches this type of doctrine that has this type of revelation and she said so i read the rest of your website and she goes she says i got to the baptism part and she says i was baptized and she used the word titles she says i was baptized in the titles of the father son and holy spirit she said i need to be baptized right i need to be baptized in the name amen jesus christ so you know what i did i sent her a list of churches in her area and she said that church right there she says is just a couple blocks from my house god has a sense of humor she went to the church of the pastor that was so upset with that billboard and by the grace of god that pastor baptized her in the name of jesus amen amen as far as i know she still attends that church praise the lord imagine if we could work in that unity yes that god doesn't have to force it to us right but imagine if we could work in the unity of the gospel like that amen then we would accomplish something then things would start to move forward praise the lord my aunt jackie you know my aunt jack jacqueline wheeler she's uh she's got cancer and she's struggling she's going through chemotherapy now and she's she's sick and she told me she said i appreciate just the outpouring of love from all these people she said they they've just they've come they've set aside any differences that we've ever had and and they've come and they've been so sweet they brought me food and they text me and they give me this love and she said i just appreciate so much laying aside any differences any churches and we're just all together in unity and i told her i said you know what's sad i said it's sad that it takes sick adversity right it's it's sad that it takes adversity yeah to bring us together it's sad but it's it's a god who is rich in mercy that will do it yes but it's so sad that it has to come to that and it's always come to that throughout history and we think that it's not going to come to that now it's going to come to that amen but i want to get a step ahead of the curse yes yes i want to invite that unity man among the people among this church yes and i know i believe that you have but across them all right and then across the aisle to other christians and bring that unity together because there is coming a squeeze i don't understand it it is anybody else you know we we hear so much about prophecies um and and we all interpret them but we really won't know the interpretation of the prophecies until it comes right yeah that's that's when i really know amen you know peter was exactly in the book of joel peter was peter knew the book of joel and then at the day of pentecost peter was there and he saw the pillar of fire come down he saw people rise up and he's then speak in tongues and he says ah this is that which was spoken up by the prophet joel he recognized that he probably had all these ideas of what joel 2 28 was but when he saw it he recognized yes and when we start to get squeezed like my aunt jackie's now when we start to get squeezed we start to we start to maybe come together the lord by by his grace we should do it without having to suffer persecution but when we start to get squeezed yes when you take i was a i was juicing grapefruit last night when you take a grapefruit and you squeeze it grapefruit juice comes out if you take a lemon and you squeeze it lemon juice comes out so friends when we get squeezed i ask you what comes out of you amen what's going to come out of us when we get squeezed is it going to be fighting or is it going to be the love of jesus christ is it going to be going to be amen reach out across you know what i'm getting squeezed but i'm going to help my brother i'm going to help my sister these things are not easy to do when repressed when you get in a fight with your friend and you want to talk about it that's the time you get squeezed yeah let the holy spirit come out yes that's the juice that should come out it shouldn't be that root of bitterness amen when when we're when we're talking with with other churches or you know you see the pastors go against each other you see the denominations going against each other you see the people go against each other you see now you see you see celebrities on twitter and all that i don't know we've got to talk about it but i don't know i don't have an account or anything but they fight they argue you see countries against each other yeah you know you see democrats and republicans against each other this is the age that we live in yes but we need to overcome that we need to overcome those that root of bitterness yes that is so that is so prevalent with us amen let me uh i'm running out of time here let me let me get to uh i want to get to uh a quote from brother branham but first i'll maybe give you a little history i've heard of the azusa street revival in 1906. famous you know brother brown marked that day april then i believe it was april 9 1906 that brother branham marked that day that the laodicean age started and what it was is it was when the holy spirit fell and this this little group they started speaking in tongues and a revival started in los angeles yes they took they they grew out of their house they have a little place like this they started with a group smaller than this it grew and grew and grew they got a bigger church and and it just continued to grow the lord continued to bless him with with miracles and tongues and and it spread throughout the world and they they started a newspaper the apostolic fate and that newspaper was printed for free and it was sent out and it was telling everything that was going on in los angeles at this time tremendous revival was going on in los angeles in 1906 1907 and then something happened that's that it started to fade you know what happened they started to argue they started they started to to to fight yeah the the leader of the revival was a one-eyed black man named william joseph seymour and and seymour dedicated his life to the ministry to the message and he decided he wanted to get married well the secretary she decided you shouldn't get married and there's this this little tiff between the pastor and the secretary so so it started this argument so the secretary stole the mailing list and she went up to san francisco with another ministry and you know what the azusa street revival died it died right there and it started to shrink because of the arguments that they had it started to shrink and dwindle and go down until it turned into just just a black church with just a few people and then seymour died and they couldn't even make the bills for the church and it's gone yeah and today i've been there today all that marks the azusa street revival is a street sign and it says original location this is the street because they argued yes because they disagree and they were probably all based in fact they're all probably based in truth in in their disagreements yeah but they couldn't set those things aside and i and i see brother branham come on the scene and brother branham comes on the scene and in the in the late 40s comes through and changes the world and you have people like oral roberts come out of that ministry a allen come out of that ministry t.l osborn come out of that ministry and did great things and then you see started to fight yeah and the revival ended among the people yeah and then we see our little group we see these great things were happening we had a prophet and everything was great and then the prophet leaves the scene and we start in our different directions it ends it's the saddest thing in the world but history repeats itself over and over and over again and here we are now in 2022 coming from that and we don't see are there any miracles god's always done miracles throughout history so we see some but nowhere near what we should be seeing if we are the bride of christ where is the supernatural yeah where is it and i know people don't go there people don't go there because it's like well then you know maybe we're maybe saying we're doing something wrong or or now it's just a word brother you know and we just god is a supernatural god amen and the supernatural follows his word yes the supernatural follows his people and it is today and if we don't see that there's something wrong i'm not talking about a local church i'm talking about the body in general right the prophet said that it's the sickest body that he knows right what a what a shame amen and what a shame is that i i've talked about this squeeze that he is going to have to god is rich in mercy that he's going to have to do something to drive us together friends that's not i don't believe he wants to do that right i don't believe that he wants to hurt his people but he's rich in mercy so he knows that we're people so we have to go back we have to have to experience those things but when you get squeezed make sure that it's the holy spirit coming out yes right not something not something else amen yes do we pray as jesus prayed so what do we do you know how how can how can we get get further and one thing is we can pray for it if it meant so much to jesus that over and over and over he prayed for it over and over he told his disciples then the disciples come the apostles come first corinthians chapter 13 first corinthians chapter one uh first second third john first and second peter all of it often all the time love one another amen unity and then these other things are smaller this unity is huge it's very very important it's important for our family that we get along together it's important for our church local that we get along it's important for our church's broad scale that we get along and for christianity in general right it's important remember there's one full and one shepherd amen i read that scripture let me read this let me read a quote and i'll finish here this is what brother branham said now notice he said this in 5701 25. this is a different quote than the first one different sermon now notice just a few moments i want to say this before i start preaching that the greatest need of healing tonight and the sickest body that i know of in all the world that needs healing he says this i'm sorry he says the sickest body that i know of in all the world is the body of the lord jesus the church oh it's horribly sick yeah it's broke up and scattered it needs healing may god send the holy spirit in such a power so the whole body of christ will be brought together bond with love and unity yes now listen to this until then until then you will see things happen that you never thought of before yes until then you will see things happen that you never thought of before jesus will come and it will be all over the world again may god send the holy spirit with such in such a power to the whole body of christ will be brought together bound with love and unity and until then and then you will see things happen that you never thought of before jesus will come and it will be all over so now we have another prophet saying be together be together and by this not only will men don't know your you're my disciples but by this also that you will know that i am the christ amen if you have loved one for another and you have unity and i do not believe i believe that we do not put enough emphasis on that we talk about things of life we talk about about about great prophecies that are supposed to happen but unity of them among the body should be paramount yes and it takes an effort we need to do something it was a commandment from jesus it was not a prophecy it was a commandment amen that we should love one another and have that unity are you with me friend yes are you gonna make an effort to do it amen i'm going to ask the pastor to close but about let's bow our heads and let's stand let's stand to our feet and think about as we pray and have just a moment of quiet time think about the lord jesus coming down the mountain and the pressure that was on and the love that he had for his people the love that he had that he wanted to see among his children and then in asking the lord lord let them be one yes as you and i yes how close we should be with each other yes amen what a powerful thing it is amen love is the most powerful force there is on the planet today and the bride is the ones who have the ability to tap into it they're the ones who really have what true love is people talk about love they scream about love they mention love they say if you don't love us and blah blah on and on like you talked about the cover of that well you know we're supposed to they consider us accepting that as love that that's not love love is uh love is something that causes us to want that person to prosper and to be blessed and to not go to hell but to go to heaven that's the love that motivates us and that love will be corrective to try to get that person to recognize what you're doing how you're acting how you're living is not going to put you in heaven and that's the love that uh that our brother is referring to and of course i have a little snippet i mean belize you'll he'll enjoy the book two chapters on love it's good but anyway my my favorite thing in the scripture is i think it's genesis 11 if i remember right where they started to build the big tower together and even god himself said there will be nothing withheld from those people what they imagined to do just because they were in unity that's it they were in unity they were in one mind and god himself said there'll be nothing impossible to those people because they're in unity they'll do exactly what they set forth to do and what an example it is to us what a message to us to recognize what it would take to for us to bring us i think that's actually i was sitting there trying to remember brother dan i think that's actually the second message i ever brought up to tabernacle my entire life brother green called me up one time in the 98 convention i spoke about two most men influential men in my life but then uh i when when we came out and uh i think the next time i it was on unity and it struck a chord with brother green and he liked it so much in fact that book is a product of brother green's continued encouragement because i preached that and he said you need to write a book i don't write a book i failed english i think the teachers i had were sympathetic and passed me with a can you get a d minus minus i don't know i i can't write anything i can barely speak in fact they said they when i was in junior high school everybody was starting to take different language and the counselor came to me and said you shouldn't take a foreign language until you have mastered the english language guess what all through school high school i never took a foreign language you know why because i've never mastered the english language good enough to feel comfortable taking another language so i never did but it's it's something god did and that's what matters that's what matters problem is today we let the spirit of the world get on us amen about three weeks ago i preached on why we're not a denomination but we let the spirit of the world get on us the spirit of the world the spirit of the world says you're part of us if you believe what we believe if you speak the way we speak that's the whole free speech thing that's going on now well they believe in free speech as long as you're saying what they want you to say but free speech should be i'm going to listen to you because you have a right to speak and i expect you to listen to me because i have a right to speak but this is just the unity of the brethren amen the power of that is incredible i don't know that we even know tap into it i mean me and brother wilson growing up in the south we go back to days where we've been in ministries and meetings where it just the unity and the power of the spirit was so strong and milky white across the congregation and it just it's just incredible uh and just a little tapping into that that our brother ministered on today i tell you it's right where my art is that's for sure and he'll probably get to know that better when he reads the book but that's been a heart on my heart for so many well most of my ministry it really has it's been about unity and unity of the body i don't know how many times i've spoke on it but uh i think we just don't understand what the potential of that is if we just if we could tap into that amen and tap into recognizing we are to hold nothing against anyone right amen we are to hold nothing against anyone yes amen and by the grace of god you remember that little paper that brother green tore off and put a little mark on it and said brother branham said put it on that scale i'm not going at all the details but most of you know what i'm talking about they put a little scratch as he called it on that little piece of paper he put the piece of paper on the scale it weighed put a little scratch and put it on the thing and the scratch actually weighed very minute but it weighed he said if we have a scratch of ought towards anybody we're in danger of hellfire that if that doesn't shake us to our core friends i don't know amen god help us all but you know it's something that's uh that uh he talked about being so powerful and that love is so powerful we just tap into it just a little bit and i believe we're i i hope i pray we're getting to that place when god squeezes me whether it's individually or whether it's a group effort or whether it's internationally whatever each one of us need that god comes out amen amen praise the lord i want god to come out in every instance i hope he comes out so much he doesn't have to squeeze yes amen that's the whole point we had communion here a couple weeks ago and you read that and the communion says that we judge ourselves so that we be not judged we be not condemned amen praise the lord so we want to make sure that we and ourselves are in the position spiritually that we're pleasing to the lord amen and again the foot's doing what it's supposed to be doing and
