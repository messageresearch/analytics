[26:28] Babylonian garment that it was all right
[26:31] and he brought uh death into the camp

[38:40] let's begin with verse 16 Matthew
[38:44] 66 moreover when you fast be not as the
[38:48] Hypocrites of a sad countenance for they
[38:51] disfigure their faces that they may
[38:53] appear unto men to fast verily I say
[38:56] unto you they have have their reward but
[38:59] thou when thou fastest anoint thine head
[39:01] and wash thy face that thou appear not
[39:04] unto men to fast but unto thy father
[39:07] which is in secret and thy father which
[39:09] seeth in secret shall we reward thee
[39:12] openly lay not up for yourselves
[39:15] Treasures upon Earth where moth and
[39:18] rough thus corrupt and where thieves
[39:20] break through and steal but lay up for
[39:23] yourselves Treasures in Heaven where
[39:26] neither nor rust doth corrupt and where
[39:30] thieves do not break through nor steal
[39:33] for where your treasure is there will
[39:35] your heart be also amen you can be
[39:38] seated if you'd
[39:41] like amen just
[39:44] a simple thought today I want to talk
[39:47] about living for others living for
[39:50] others uh he's not in here yet but um
[39:54] about a month ago me and Joel went to to
[39:57] baseball game here he comes maybe I'll
[40:00] just wait till he gets in here anyway
[40:02] cuz uh a lot a lot of the influence of
[40:05] this message came from him so um I don't
[40:11] he obviously probably doesn't realize
[40:13] that but uh it meant a lot to me but uh
[40:17] about a month or so ago uh me and him
[40:20] and it's kind of become an annual thing
[40:22] for me and Joel we usually go up and uh
[40:24] we go to a game we spend the night and
[40:26] go to the afternoon game the next day
[40:29] and uh we just enjoy our time together
[40:31] and go to the ball game and he likes
[40:33] enjoying watching the game probably
[40:35] doesn't have know anything about it but
[40:37] just being there and cheering just uh he
[40:40] just really enjoyed that but uh this
[40:43] time now not that it's ever been any
[40:46] different but this time struck me more
[40:50] than any other time um I I don't
[40:54] know how well uh all of you know and I'm
[40:59] not GNA keep harping on this point
[41:03] because I want to get to the message but
[41:05] uh Joel is an extremely giving young man
[41:11] uh and and it become becomes more
[41:14] evident to me when we go to a place that
[41:18] the only two people we the only people
[41:20] we know are each other in that entire
[41:23] Stadium there may be 30,000 people there
[41:25] there's players there's men managers
[41:28] there's uh announcers there's people in
[41:31] costumes there's uh cheerleading people
[41:34] there's there's all kinds of varied
[41:36] amounts of people uh but it struck me
[41:40] more this time than ever uh how I see
[41:45] him now developing into a young man
[41:48] reacts around other people and it it
[41:51] impressed me so much more for some
[41:54] reason this time that uh when I came
[41:57] home home I've had I I wrote I had this
[41:59] message I wrote this a month ago uh just
[42:02] waiting to get through what we were
[42:04] doing here to even bring it but it was
[42:06] so inspired me uh when I came back that
[42:09] week that uh the Lord put this message
[42:12] on my heart to live for
[42:14] others um I I I don't know of any other
[42:18] person and I know I wouldn't uh if I
[42:21] when I went to a ball game as a kid uh
[42:24] if I got a foul ball or if a guy tossed
[42:26] me a ball or something I kept it that
[42:29] was my ball I wasn't giving that ball to
[42:30] anybody else Joel finds the first person
[42:33] he can find that doesn't have a ball and
[42:35] he gives it to
[42:37] him and not because it doesn't mean
[42:39] anything to him because it does because
[42:41] one the first thing we do when we get
[42:43] there the first game is go down to the
[42:45] place where all the balls come to try to
[42:47] get a ball but as soon as almost as soon
[42:50] as he gets in fact uh last time we were
[42:54] there uh I'll say this before I act get
[42:57] into the message but um the last time we
[43:01] went we went and uh he got a he's always
[43:04] got a ball every time we go he gets a
[43:06] ball I went to games it it was a thing
[43:10] for me and Tabitha for a while that me
[43:11] and her would go to the games uh years
[43:14] ago when she was younger and all and we
[43:16] never got a ball she can tell you we go
[43:19] we go and we never got a ball every time
[43:23] I go with Joel he gets a ball I and
[43:26] sometimes two or three
[43:28] honestly he'll get two or three balls
[43:30] sometimes and uh he got a ball before I
[43:33] know it we're walking we're we're done
[43:36] trying to get him we're walking up the
[43:37] stairs he sees a girl over there or
[43:39] somebody it's not necessarily a girl but
[43:41] he sees somebody over doesn't have one
[43:43] and one and one's kind of disappointed
[43:44] he goes over and says here you can have
[43:46] this
[43:47] one and I'm just I'm just blown away I
[43:51] go up the stairs and I thought when I
[43:52] was his age I'd have never done that I'm
[43:55] honesty I in fact at my age I don't know
[43:58] if I would do it probably would if I saw
[44:00] a little kid cuz you know it's different
[44:02] now but I have never done that but
[44:04] that's the way he is we go to our seats
[44:07] and it wasn't long that we were at our
[44:09] seats that uh of course I text his mom
[44:12] and told him all about it told her all
[44:14] about it and he said and she so next
[44:16] time he gets a ball tell him to keep
[44:18] it you want that to be kind of a
[44:21] souvenir and so uh sure enough got a
[44:25] foul ball another ball or somebody threw
[44:27] or something and uh we got it uh which
[44:31] again never happened never happened to
[44:33] me before ever but when I go with him
[44:35] happens two or three times every game uh
[44:37] got another one uh got another ball and
[44:41] some guys some younger guys by his AE
[44:43] were set behind us and they were talking
[44:45] the whole game and they kind of made
[44:47] buddies friends and stuff and um and
[44:50] even Joel had had the ball and he said I
[44:53] give it to you guys but my mom's already
[44:55] told me I'm supposed to keep this one
[44:58] so so he kept that one of course the
[45:00] next day he got some signatures on it
[45:02] and stuff but uh but that is just I it
[45:05] it inspired me so much when when I I I
[45:09] got to keep going when an announcer
[45:12] comes by somebody that you seen down on
[45:16] the field give a little announcement
[45:18] they would come by and they would just
[45:19] be walking by right in front of us with
[45:21] the microphone in her hand and he would
[45:23] and he would holler out hey that was
[45:25] some good announcing that you did
[45:27] who does that just being kind yes just
[45:31] being nice you know just that because
[45:34] that's just who he is I I don't think I
[45:36] don't ever think of something like that
[45:39] um some maybe other people do just
[45:41] something simple like that uh and and
[45:44] and a player or a manager or whatever or
[45:48] uh concessions he just gives compliments
[45:51] to everybody just walking by just that
[45:54] good job or something like that and you
[45:57] know it it makes I I'm sure it helps
[46:01] those people to know that there are some
[46:04] even younger ones that care that are
[46:07] listening that uh that appreciate it and
[46:12] I I just can't how but think how much it
[46:15] might make one of those people's day
[46:17] because sometimes you get people down
[46:18] there and they're cheering and they're
[46:19] clapping go debes and all this stuff and
[46:22] people are just sitting there A lot of
[46:23] times and a lot of times nobody's paying
[46:25] attention and they're just cheering our
[46:26] heart out I'm sure that's what they're
[46:28] getting paid for and Joel just stands up
[46:30] and goes right with them and just and
[46:34] compliments them and I
[46:35] think to me that just and he's always
[46:39] been that way I'm not saying this is any
[46:40] time different he's always been that way
[46:42] in fact the last year that we went he
[46:44] got two or three balls over the couple
[46:46] games and didn't come home with any
[46:48] because he gave them all
[46:49] away because he's he's just always
[46:51] that's just who he is uh
[46:55] and again
[46:57] uh I'll probably lead that to rest but
[46:59] it became such an example to me and I
[47:02] started thinking about Christ and I
[47:05] started thinking about uh the spirit of
[47:08] Christ and how the spirit of Christ
[47:09] should be in each one of us and how much
[47:12] the scripture teaches us now this is is
[47:17] a great scripture that of course this is
[47:19] of course I didn't know where to begin I
[47:21] just knew I had a thought that the Lord
[47:22] showed me as an that he my 10-year-old
[47:25] grandson gave me as an example example
[47:27] teaching his grandpa his GRS but look
[47:30] lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon
[47:32] Earth where moth rust uh du corrupt and
[47:36] where thieves break through and steal
[47:37] but lay up for your soul Treasures in
[47:39] Heaven amen and see that's that's
[47:43] exactly what I see being done laying up
[47:46] Treasures in Heaven giving to people you
[47:48] don't know giving to people who may hate
[47:51] you giving to people who may not uh uh
[47:55] uh speak bad about you or whatever and
[47:58] and giving just being there to help
[48:00] being there to encourage being there to
[48:03] uh to to be someone to uplift and to
[48:06] edify and it it it makes a huge
[48:09] difference I think uh I'll say this one
[48:11] more thing I think Joel saw uh that girl
[48:14] the next day I never saw her she's about
[48:16] his age and she was over there and she
[48:18] mouthed to him thank you or something I
[48:21] don't think she thanked him when he gave
[48:22] it I think she was so shocked that she
[48:24] didn't say anything and we just walked
[48:26] up the stairs the next day they I guess
[48:28] they saw each other and she said thank
[48:30] you uh and appreciated what he did I I
[48:33] don't know what that meant to that
[48:35] person but you know it's doing something
[48:37] for others living your life for others
[48:40] yes that's exactly what Jesus Christ did
[48:43] but see a lot of times you got to have
[48:46] the heart for others you have to have a
[48:49] heart to give uh you you you have to
[48:52] have the heart to be able to want to
[48:54] give to want to help someone to
[48:58] understand uh that it's it's more
[49:01] precious to give them receive right uh
[49:03] to help others appreciate it or enjoy it
[49:07] as much or more than you do it's like uh
[49:10] it's like the example that brother green
[49:11] gave us about brother bandam and him
[49:12] throwing darts you know and brother
[49:15] brandom uh let brother green win
[49:18] according to brother Green's testimony
[49:19] he basically let him win because brother
[49:21] random hit a bullseye every time he
[49:23] threw the dark so how do you beat
[49:25] somebody like that
[49:27] uh and and he let him win he said well
[49:29] if there's any enjoyment in winning why
[49:32] don't I let you enjoy it right and see
[49:34] that just becomes such an example of
[49:36] living for others uh that makes me think
[49:40] you know uh I I appreciate it I'm glad
[49:43] and I'm thankful to have this ball but
[49:45] maybe this other person would enjoy it
[49:47] too if it's that much enjoyment in it
[49:49] let them have some enjoyment don't know
[49:52] the person from
[49:53] Adam never see that person probably
[49:56] again the rest your life but just giving
[49:59] somebody some a little bit of enjoyment
[50:02] there's got to be a heart there to want
[50:04] to do that there's got to be somewhere
[50:06] that the that that in your heart you
[50:08] want to live your life for others amen
[50:11] remember brother random said you're
[50:13] living life for others you're staring
[50:15] heaven in the face amen praise the Lord
[50:19] let's go over to St John uh chapter
[50:25] 3 as you're turning there I want to read
[50:28] this because again uh it it made me it
[50:34] made me think about Jesus Christ it
[50:36] actually made me think about my own life
[50:39] and and about Christ and about the word
[50:42] uh let me read this quote to you as
[50:45] you're going over to St John chapter 3
[50:47] let me read this
[50:49] quote that that day on Calvary 1960 he
[50:52] says then what does it do it gives you
[50:56] after that that condition his Spirit to
[50:58] follow uh to follow
[51:01] him and to do as he did for others who
[51:06] is following
[51:08] on he was just one man the perfect man
[51:13] he gave his life and he made an example
[51:17] for you yes for me now what must we do
[51:22] see praise the Lord what must we do we
[51:25] must follow in that example he left and
[51:29] gave us an example for us to follow now
[51:32] what must we do we must follow in that
[51:35] example what was that example now the
[51:37] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[51:41] lived for himself yes amen amen Jesus
[51:45] never lived for himself why because he
[51:47] had the heart for others yes his heart
[51:50] was for other people his life was to be
[51:52] lived for others not for himself amen
[51:56] but for others what is our
[51:59] example he is well what is that example
[52:02] that he left to us he did not live his
[52:04] life for
[52:05] himself his life was spent for others
[52:10] that's perfectly eternal life amen look
[52:14] at what brother brandom said that's
[52:16] perfectly eternal life God help me Amen
[52:22] to want to live for other
[52:25] people when you say say you go to church
[52:27] and you do good things that's fine but
[52:30] when you live your life to yourself you
[52:33] haven't got eternal life on eternal life
[52:38] is living for
[52:40] others it proved it when it comes in uh
[52:44] uh when when it come in the Lamb of God
[52:48] he lived and had eternal life because he
[52:50] did not live for himself he lived for
[52:52] others and you receive eternal life by
[52:55] receiving that day and you don't live
[52:57] for yourself no more you live for others
[53:00] when you receive the spirit of Christ
[53:02] amen it doesn't become about it's not
[53:05] about you anymore amen you start living
[53:07] your life for other people praise the
[53:10] Lord what it means someone said how can
[53:14] you stand that anybody call you such bad
[53:17] names because you don't live for
[53:20] yourself you live for others you might
[53:23] uh that you might redeem that man you
[53:26] become sons and the trouble of it is the
[53:29] church has forgot they were
[53:32] Sons you're a son taking you're taking
[53:36] Christ's place you're a son so don't
[53:39] live for yourself live for others well
[53:42] brother Bram I can't live for this
[53:43] brother because he sure is uh sure isn't
[53:47] a nice man that's not it amen amen it's
[53:52] not cause the person's a nice person or
[53:54] not that doesn't me see again what does
[53:58] it make for us if we do for those who do
[54:01] for
[54:02] us amen giving was scriptural giving was
[54:06] never meant to be reciprocated yes our
[54:10] giving is not on the value of
[54:13] reciprocity our giving is on the value
[54:16] that we just give period there's nothing
[54:20] to be expected to receive back amen and
[54:23] the the the horrible thing about it and
[54:26] it's gotten to be even more horrible I
[54:29] guess is uh gift giving Times Like
[54:32] Christmas and such become so
[54:33] commercialized that people feel that
[54:36] reciprocity is a part of the process
[54:38] when it should have nothing to do with
[54:41] it amen you should want to give
[54:44] regardless of what anybody else does for
[54:46] or to you it just that that's not the
[54:49] point amen what did Jesus do in his life
[54:53] again
[54:53] remember this example that Gramps
[54:58] received reminded me of Jesus Christ it
[55:02] put my focus on Jesus Christ and how he
[55:05] lived why was he even here right he
[55:09] didn't need to be
[55:11] here he didn't need to be here he didn't
[55:14] need to do these things he didn't need
[55:15] to go through what he did but he did it
[55:17] for you yes amen he did it for me the
[55:21] rottenest most low down scoundrel that
[55:24] ever was born to a woman he loved
[55:26] right and gave his life for me amen how
[55:30] could I then even think about any other
[55:33] in any other
[55:35] way he come to give he gave me well
[55:39] brother ROM I can't live for this
[55:41] brother he sure isn't a nice man that's
[55:44] not it doesn't matter whether he's a
[55:46] nice man doesn't matter whether he's
[55:48] nice to you or not doesn't matter
[55:50] whether he curses you or calls you name
[55:52] or puts you
[55:54] down amen
[55:57] you say how can you do that because you
[55:59] have Christ Living in you because you're
[56:02] a new creature you're not the same old
[56:04] man that you used to be you're not the
[56:06] same person you used to be because
[56:08] you're born again a born again Christian
[56:10] lives a different life yes amen amen
[56:13] their whole life is to live to be
[56:15] edifying to build up to help to increase
[56:19] not to tear down not to rip apart not to
[56:23] denigrate but to build up and to help
[56:26] brother Brown said here live for that
[56:28] man who hates you see you might can help
[56:32] that person someday you might can help
[56:34] bring Redemption to that person's life
[56:36] someday you can't if you put them down
[56:40] you can't if you treat them poorly in
[56:43] fact if you treat them as horrible as
[56:44] they treat you they'll probably never
[56:46] turn to you in the time of need you
[56:48] won't have the opportunity to give to
[56:51] that
[56:52] person amen we've become such a selfish
[56:55] Society yes God help us we become such a
[56:59] selfish me first society and a and a and
[57:02] a society that does not believe the word
[57:06] that does not trust the promise of the
[57:08] word and does not trust God to do what
[57:10] he said he would do amen he said you do
[57:14] for and I will do for you we just read
[57:17] it he said don't be like the publicans
[57:21] who fast and they go around building
[57:24] themselves up like they're some great
[57:26] highest person I've been fasting I've
[57:28] been doing this and I've been doing that
[57:30] for God he said no you give just don't
[57:35] don't make a show of it amen amen God
[57:39] sees it God knows it and God will reward
[57:42] you but see people have lost that they
[57:46] want instant gratification they want
[57:48] instant reward they don't want to wait
[57:51] to get on the other side say laying up
[57:53] Treasures in Heaven well I want my
[57:55] treasures now well you can have them now
[57:57] you won't have any there probably won't
[57:59] even be there if that's your heart and
[58:01] attitude probably won't even be there
[58:03] but you definitely won't have any there
[58:05] amen people want instant gratification I
[58:08] want it now got to have it now no that's
[58:11] that that's not the life of Christ
[58:13] that's not the life he lived amen it's
[58:15] not the life that uh that's not the life
[58:17] brother brandom lived and that and
[58:19] excuse me and I'm going to give him his
[58:21] roses I know he's gone but that's how
[58:24] brother green lived amen Amen brother
[58:26] green had the example of brother
[58:28] brandham and lived the same
[58:30] way the man could have been a
[58:33] multi-millionaire many times
[58:35] over but died in debt now that could be
[58:40] a whole another subject but the point of
[58:42] it is whatever he got usually he gave
[58:45] away right he just did uh and people can
[58:51] uh say it's good bad criticize whatever
[58:54] they want to say they say well you know
[58:56] he he he he did this or talked about
[58:59] that for whatever people want to say
[59:00] about but the man gave I've never seen a
[59:03] more generous man in my life than
[59:05] brother green course I didn't know
[59:06] brother Brown so the most generous man
[59:09] I've ever met in my life because he'd
[59:11] give it away everything he got or most
[59:15] everything he got anyway didn't live in
[59:16] a mansion on the in the Foothills amen
[59:19] if he drove a nicer car it was usually
[59:22] because somebody gave it to
[59:24] him amen that he
[59:26] accepted but it's it's living that kind
[59:29] of life but we become so selfish God
[59:32] help us so selfish that giving seems
[59:35] like a foreign thing
[59:37] anymore sometimes it can just be a
[59:39] matter of giving of
[59:41] ourselves sometimes it could be
[59:42] something as simple as a
[59:44] baseball giving of yourself in prayer
[59:47] giving of yourself in time the most
[59:50] precious commodity we have is the most
[59:52] is the commodity most people take
[59:54] advantage of time that's our most
[59:57] precious commodity and some people don't
[59:58] seem to care anything about time right
[1:00:02] amen anyway let's move let me finish
[1:00:05] this quote so we can move on I can't
[1:00:07] live for that brother he's not nice
[1:00:09] that's not it live for that man who
[1:00:12] hates you live for that person who would
[1:00:15] kill you if they
[1:00:18] could that's a powerful statement that's
[1:00:21] what they done to him they killed him
[1:00:24] and he died and he might save them that
[1:00:27] he might save them that's eternal life
[1:00:31] when you that's in your bosom you're
[1:00:33] facing heaven then when it's in your
[1:00:35] bosom you're facing heaven then I guess
[1:00:38] that's kind of where the quote comes
[1:00:39] from you're facing heaven then but you
[1:00:42] sacrifice your own things you give them
[1:00:44] up amen just like a sheep gives up its
[1:00:48] wool now going back to Christ St John 3:
[1:00:53] 16 we all know the scripture very well
[1:00:55] John 316
[1:00:57] first scripture I ever knew when I was a
[1:00:58] kid growing up at a Baptist Church for
[1:01:01] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:01:04] he gave he gave his only begotten son
[1:01:08] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:01:11] not perish but have everlasting life for
[1:01:14] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:01:17] condemn the world didn't send him here
[1:01:20] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:01:23] through him might be saved
[1:01:26] praise the Lord to who to
[1:01:29] me to us Amen to those that would accept
[1:01:32] it to those that would believe those
[1:01:35] that put him out put him down shunned
[1:01:37] him ridiculed him didn't want to have
[1:01:39] anything to do with him amen as we all
[1:01:42] as Sinners didn't want to have anything
[1:01:44] to do with Christ leave me alone I'm
[1:01:47] happy the way I am no I wasn't neither
[1:01:50] were you people think they are but
[1:01:52] they're not amen they think they're
[1:01:55] happy but they're really not only true
[1:01:57] happiness is in Christ when you get him
[1:02:00] then you can get happiness but it comes
[1:02:02] with understanding that it was because
[1:02:05] he gave he gave to somebody that was
[1:02:08] unworthy he could have taken our entire
[1:02:11] race the Gentile race which was a
[1:02:14] miserable people and wiped every one of
[1:02:17] them off and said I just start all over
[1:02:20] again could have done that with Adam in
[1:02:22] the beginning just wipe it completely
[1:02:24] off and just start all over
[1:02:26] but not he had Redemptive values in his
[1:02:30] character and in that character he
[1:02:32] wanted to express that he does for us
[1:02:35] today that that Redemptive virtue
[1:02:38] character was in Christ come and shine
[1:02:40] its light so we could enjoy what we
[1:02:43] understand is the Redemption of being a
[1:02:45] part of his family brother Brown said we
[1:02:47] are Sons we are here to be in place of
[1:02:51] Christ amen now I know that that's what
[1:02:54] the pope thinks he is but no he's not uh
[1:03:00] God's children are here in his place we
[1:03:02] are here to shine and express to the
[1:03:04] rest of the world that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:07] still alive that he is still the same
[1:03:10] yesterday today and forever amen he rose
[1:03:13] from the dead he's the same God that he
[1:03:16] has always been there is this thing that
[1:03:18] goes that has gone around I guess uh I
[1:03:22] guess it still does I've had it we me
[1:03:23] and Sonia had it happen to us one time
[1:03:28] and I thought it was very nice uh that
[1:03:30] people would do but we got one time one
[1:03:33] of our times uh when we went to San
[1:03:35] Diego I was going through a Starbucks to
[1:03:38] get a
[1:03:39] coffee and first time that I every
[1:03:42] remember pulled up and the lady told us
[1:03:45] the person in front of you paid for your
[1:03:47] order I thought now see I'll never ever
[1:03:51] get to thank those people but they
[1:03:53] weren't looking for things right they
[1:03:56] didn't want to be thanked they didn't
[1:03:57] care if they were thanked they didn't
[1:04:00] care if they ever met me amen I wanted
[1:04:03] to meet them because I wanted to thank
[1:04:05] them but I I I've never met them but the
[1:04:08] only time ever they were long gone by
[1:04:11] the time we got up there and she told us
[1:04:13] that amen now on obviously I I don't
[1:04:18] know that happens like that all the time
[1:04:20] but uh we turned around and I said well
[1:04:22] pay for the people behind us I'll never
[1:04:25] met I never know him never met him
[1:04:27] whoever it is don't know but I always
[1:04:29] thought that was such a wonderful thing
[1:04:31] that kind of got I don't know how it got
[1:04:33] started but then I'd never been a part
[1:04:36] of it but I've heard it before like up
[1:04:38] to 200 people would come through a
[1:04:40] drive-thru and every one of them paid
[1:04:42] forward it's called paid forward yeah
[1:04:44] like 200 people and I think that's just
[1:04:47] fantastic and then and then I wonder
[1:04:50] wonder who was the person that stopped
[1:04:52] it uh but but that's okay cuz it was a
[1:04:56] give to expect to receive amen the
[1:04:59] person who paid for it for us wasn't
[1:05:01] expecting to get receive nor were we
[1:05:04] amen you can say well your order was
[1:05:06] only six and there's is 30 don't matter
[1:05:08] that's not the point right amen point is
[1:05:12] paying it forward the point is is being
[1:05:14] there for someone even if you don't know
[1:05:16] them even if you've never met them even
[1:05:19] if you will never ever meet them maybe
[1:05:21] in your entire life maybe they were
[1:05:23] Christians maybe I'll see them on the
[1:05:25] other side maybe we'll know I don't know
[1:05:28] doesn't matter that's not the point the
[1:05:30] point is paying it forward for someone
[1:05:33] uh who you'll never know weren't
[1:05:35] expecting to receive anything in return
[1:05:38] amen now I'll be honest I have never
[1:05:40] gone through a drive course how hardly
[1:05:42] ever go through a drive-thru because I I
[1:05:45] just don't eat most drive-throughs are
[1:05:47] fast food and I don't really eat fast
[1:05:48] food much anymore so I hardly ever go
[1:05:50] through
[1:05:51] drive-throughs uh but but I I I've never
[1:05:55] never started a pay forward I've never
[1:05:58] been the one to actually start it when
[1:06:00] you get up there and it's only happened
[1:06:02] once but when it does you think man that
[1:06:04] was just really kind to them and it and
[1:06:07] it makes a difference in your day it
[1:06:08] really does and I and you hope that it
[1:06:11] makes a difference for the person behind
[1:06:13] you if you did something to help that
[1:06:15] person when you help somebody it makes a
[1:06:17] difference when you help somebody it it
[1:06:20] makes a difference in your life right
[1:06:22] when you give to
[1:06:24] somebody you don't care whether you get
[1:06:26] anything in return but when you help
[1:06:27] somebody or give for somebody it makes
[1:06:30] you feel good it does Christian or not
[1:06:34] it I to me Matthew Chapter 5 let's let's
[1:06:38] go over here now I just got a few very
[1:06:41] familiar scriptures
[1:06:45] reading
[1:06:50] amen there should
[1:06:52] be again there should never be the
[1:06:54] thought the expect to receive right I I
[1:06:58] I think a lot of
[1:07:00] people sometimes even in church uh may
[1:07:04] give and
[1:07:06] they expect they they said well you know
[1:07:09] God said he would do this yeah yeah he
[1:07:11] did but you don't give under that
[1:07:13] premise right amen you give with the
[1:07:17] with no
[1:07:18] expectations you give without any
[1:07:21] thought of well he owes me now no no he
[1:07:25] does Amen just like any any other point
[1:07:30] of giving you give not expecting to
[1:07:33] wonder about getting back you're living
[1:07:35] for somebody else you're living to make
[1:07:37] somebody else's life easier living to
[1:07:39] help somebody else be happy living as
[1:07:42] somebody else have a little more peace
[1:07:44] or I mean that's what our government is
[1:07:47] supposed to do actually president and
[1:07:50] our federal government is supposed to be
[1:07:52] there to help our lives it's supposed to
[1:07:55] help make it easier supposed to give
[1:07:57] unfortunately and don't know when the
[1:08:00] change happened but uh it's just the
[1:08:03] opposite now all the federal government
[1:08:05] seems to do is take but U anyway it's
[1:08:09] supposed to be there to help to make
[1:08:12] people's lives safer you're supposed to
[1:08:14] feel safer because you've got the
[1:08:17] backing of the federal government or the
[1:08:19] state government whatever the backing
[1:08:20] behind you they'll say well if these
[1:08:23] people are Bad actors and they're there
[1:08:26] to do you harm we're going to take them
[1:08:27] off the street we're going to keep them
[1:08:30] off the street we're going to try to
[1:08:32] reform them make them better people if
[1:08:34] they can uh be done as such have a
[1:08:37] prison Ministries to help maybe go to
[1:08:40] church and find Christ something but not
[1:08:43] be there to harm you so you can feel at
[1:08:46] peace so you can be happier amen that's
[1:08:50] what it's supposed to
[1:08:51] be uh Matthew 5 verse 43 uh we we've
[1:08:55] read this scripture here recently ye
[1:08:57] have heard that it hath been said Thou
[1:09:00] shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[1:09:02] enemy but I say unto you love your
[1:09:06] enemies bless them that curse you do
[1:09:10] good to them that hate you and pray for
[1:09:13] them praise for them which despitefully
[1:09:16] use you and persecute you now my opinion
[1:09:19] that's one of the hardest scriptures
[1:09:21] there are in the
[1:09:23] Bible that is
[1:09:26] that scripture I think I even said this
[1:09:28] before great against the flesh probably
[1:09:30] is much or more than any other scripture
[1:09:31] in the Bible amen amen because truth of
[1:09:34] it is you have heard that ha been said
[1:09:36] yeah and that's what most people do say
[1:09:39] that's what your flesh will tell you if
[1:09:41] you listen to it love your uh neighbor
[1:09:44] and hate your enemies that's what your
[1:09:46] that's what your own flesh will tell you
[1:09:48] if you'll listen to it amen but we're
[1:09:50] not to listen to that we're listening to
[1:09:52] the spirit that's inside amen that says
[1:09:57] that we should love our enemies that we
[1:09:59] should bless them that curse us we
[1:10:01] should do the good to them that hate us
[1:10:03] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:10:05] and persecute us that's what the spirit
[1:10:08] says now is that easy no goes against
[1:10:12] everything your flesh wants to do to
[1:10:16] fight back to revile back to give anger
[1:10:19] for anger to give uh uh turmoil for
[1:10:22] turmoil to give hurt for hurt that's
[1:10:25] what that's what a person wants that's
[1:10:27] what your flesh wants to do I'm going to
[1:10:30] get
[1:10:31] even that's not what the spirit
[1:10:33] says that ye may be the children that ye
[1:10:36] may be the children of your father which
[1:10:38] is in heaven for he maketh his son to
[1:10:41] rise on the evil and on the good and he
[1:10:45] sendeth rain on the just and on the
[1:10:48] unjust for if ye love them which love
[1:10:52] you what reward have you well everybody
[1:10:55] does does that the most Ardent atheist
[1:10:59] does that
[1:11:01] agnostic the worst criminal maybe ever
[1:11:05] of course I don't know maybe there's
[1:11:06] been some that didn't love anybody but
[1:11:09] the hardest person loves those that love
[1:11:12] them so what kind of reward is that then
[1:11:16] there's no reward to that but if you
[1:11:18] give to those you don't have to give
[1:11:20] back if you give to those not expecting
[1:11:22] to get back there's a there putting up
[1:11:26] Treasures in Heaven am rest restoring
[1:11:29] Treasures in Heaven amen and I'll say I
[1:11:33] believe with all my heart that what my
[1:11:35] grandson has waiting for him on the
[1:11:36] other side I believe this my whole
[1:11:38] family but is way far beyond a
[1:11:41] baseball amen sure is praise the Lord
[1:11:46] for if you love them which love you what
[1:11:48] reward have you do not even the
[1:11:50] publicans the same and if you salute
[1:11:52] your brethren only what do you more more
[1:11:55] than others do not even the publicans
[1:11:58] sow be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:12:01] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:12:03] praise the Lord let me read you this
[1:12:06] Revelation 5 number one he says
[1:12:09] 1961 few days ago was sitting talking to
[1:12:12] my loyal friend here in the city of
[1:12:14] medical doctor
[1:12:16] Sadir he said how you doing bill I've
[1:12:18] been by his old office you ever been to
[1:12:21] Jeffersonville went by brother I call
[1:12:23] him brother samad's office Dr adair's
[1:12:26] office I went by his old office one time
[1:12:28] of course he passed away but how you
[1:12:31] doing bill I said pretty fair I suppose
[1:12:34] doc I said yourself he said oh uh got a
[1:12:38] lot of patience said I had 15
[1:12:40] examinations this afternoon I said well
[1:12:43] that's good as long as it's just
[1:12:45] examinations and finding nothing wrong I
[1:12:48] said you know we got to talking back and
[1:12:49] forth because uh like back when we were
[1:12:52] boys I said well doc I don't know
[1:12:55] just how long I'm going to be around
[1:12:58] we're both in our 50s and he said that's
[1:13:00] true Bill I said but all these years
[1:13:03] about 31 years of ministry now I have
[1:13:06] kept my heart prepared for that hour
[1:13:09] when he comes so it doesn't matter when
[1:13:13] he comes so he said that is true I said
[1:13:17] the greatest
[1:13:18] thrill I have is living for others am
[1:13:23] the greatest thrill I have
[1:13:25] is living for others so many people are
[1:13:28] so unhappy today and most of those
[1:13:31] people are some of the most selfish
[1:13:33] people you'll ever find yeah happiness
[1:13:36] is in giving happiness is in helping
[1:13:40] happiness is being in there being there
[1:13:42] for others he said the greatest thrill
[1:13:44] I've had is living for others amen don't
[1:13:48] rely on somebody else for your own
[1:13:50] happiness get it it's yours amen and he
[1:13:54] said that that's what life that's what
[1:13:56] the doctor now say Dr said that's what
[1:13:59] life is makes life real is when you not
[1:14:04] what you can do or accomplish for
[1:14:06] yourself but what you can do for
[1:14:09] others see that's when you're really
[1:14:13] living amen that's when you're really
[1:14:15] living and if there happens to be
[1:14:16] someone Among Us who has never done that
[1:14:19] tried to live for somebody else give it
[1:14:22] a try just see how much more life holds
[1:14:25] for you when you when you uh will not
[1:14:28] live for what you can give for yourself
[1:14:30] or out of life but what you can give
[1:14:33] someone else in life amen amen that is
[1:14:37] such a fantastic truth isn't it amen
[1:14:42] praise the Lord I got one more scripture
[1:14:44] I want to read in Acts Acts chapter
[1:14:53] 20 acts chap
[1:14:56] 20:35 we could have read the story amen
[1:14:59] you can find the story this comes from
[1:15:03] uh well I call it a story probably
[1:15:06] shouldn't call it a story I guess but
[1:15:08] the the reading that you'll find that uh
[1:15:11] accompanies this that this comes from is
[1:15:13] in Luke
[1:15:14] 14:12 when he talks about don't take the
[1:15:17] higher seat humble yourself and there
[1:15:20] may be somebody come in and uh do
[1:15:23] something for somebody that that you
[1:15:25] don't expect to get back and return but
[1:15:27] he says it this way I have uh uh acts
[1:15:31] 2035 I have showed you all things how
[1:15:35] that so laboring you ought to support
[1:15:37] the weak and to remember the words of
[1:15:40] the Lord Jesus Remember the words of the
[1:15:42] Lord Jesus how he said it is more
[1:15:46] blessed to give than to
[1:15:49] receive any of us that have practiced
[1:15:52] that you know that to be the truth amen
[1:15:54] amen you know that to be the truth it is
[1:15:56] more blessed to give than receive we
[1:15:59] trust God in what he says in his word
[1:16:03] amen to give is unto the Lord
[1:16:07] is not to respect anything in return but
[1:16:12] God's blessings on you it may be
[1:16:15] something as simple as storing up
[1:16:17] Treasures in
[1:16:18] Heaven amen which is where we all plan
[1:16:21] to go to be and trust that when we get
[1:16:24] there the Lord Lord's going to supply
[1:16:25] and bless let me read this one more this
[1:16:29] great example we we read the scripture
[1:16:32] last
[1:16:33] week brotherly
[1:16:35] kindness Peter came up to the man
[1:16:38] begging arms he said Silver and Gold
[1:16:40] Have I enough but what what I do have
[1:16:43] I'm going to give it to you amen amen
[1:16:46] rise up and walk praise the Lord the man
[1:16:49] rose up and walk and he was ecstatic
[1:16:53] because the Bible says he ran into the
[1:16:55] church jumping leaping and praising God
[1:16:58] you imagine how happy he was that after
[1:17:02] all those years he now could stand on
[1:17:04] his feet and walk that he could run that
[1:17:06] he could jump that he could work amen
[1:17:10] but you imagine how happy Peter was when
[1:17:13] he saw the man running and leaping and
[1:17:15] worshiping God and going into church
[1:17:17] with him you imagine how happy he was
[1:17:20] praise the
[1:17:22] Lord look now
[1:17:25] I said that to say this quote love
[1:17:28] 1956 I looked at his feet brother
[1:17:30] brandham had a prayer line man coming
[1:17:33] people coming through he had a man come
[1:17:34] through to him he said and a man was
[1:17:37] standing there and he said I looked at
[1:17:38] his feet and the man didn't have on any
[1:17:42] shoes I thought he maybe he never even
[1:17:45] had a pair of
[1:17:47] shoes all of a sudden something began to
[1:17:50] move me and I put my foot up beside his
[1:17:55] to see if my shoes would fit him I
[1:17:58] thought if my shoes will fit him I'll
[1:18:01] take them off now and give them to
[1:18:04] him amen amen he maybe never had a pair
[1:18:08] of shoes I thought here he is I pulled
[1:18:10] him up close to see uh to see uh if my
[1:18:14] shoulders and his if if he was whiter
[1:18:17] I'd give him my
[1:18:18] cooth Amen brother B said something
[1:18:22] moved on him to have love
[1:18:25] compassion he said I'd give me shoes if
[1:18:28] they would fit in I give him my coat of
[1:18:30] course you know brother Brown was kind
[1:18:32] of small in Statue so uh very good
[1:18:35] chance it didn't fit but he said I'd
[1:18:37] give him my shoes right here I take them
[1:18:39] off my feet amen I had one brother one
[1:18:43] time
[1:18:45] um up in the White

[1:18:54] and I comp minuted yet a nice I mean he
[1:18:56] had a i the guy had money but that
[1:18:59] didn't matter whether you got it or not
[1:19:01] shouldn't matter right but he had a nice
[1:19:04] cashmere fulllength coat on I mean that

[1:19:27] day as we were at church outside I I
