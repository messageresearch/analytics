has been so good to us amen praise the lord god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord i appreciate each one of you coming have several first timers brother josh and his family and sister julie and brother angel and his wife angel third supposed to be coming he texted me and said they were headed on their way just running a little late so and then we'll just have a packed house in the game so we'll be here i just trust the lord that they're going to be safe and all is going to be well with them so i need to ask you though real quick did y'all park over here okay good all right just make sure they they're kind of a stickler about us parking at that uh um cpa's office over there so even though they don't come on sunday i was here friday and they weren't even here friday so i don't know but they make a big deal about us not parking uh at this cpa office so i just wanted to make sure so i don't want anything to happen that would be wrong or go bad so so appreciate it god bless you if you've been here the first time remember uh there is no parking at the cpa on the north side of the building uh you can park in the front you can park at this school that's for sale over here they got huge parking or you can park in the back so feel free however that works for you and also if you haven't been here before the the restroom is just through the door right there on the right so if you need to use that trust you don't have to let's try not to if you can we'll try to keep from using it but if you have to it's there for your convenience so uh pray the lord richly bless you today uh by the grace of god brother roger you know and i've excuse me i forgot to mention that as a prayer request brother roger and sister moniker do to come back tomorrow so please remember them in prayer as well they'll be flying back from florida tomorrow so just pray the lord bless them with traveling mercy they had a really good visit brother roger was actually even able to see his dad they made it uh they made it to where uh they have a little tent that they could come into with the plexiglass he's able to talk to his dad just like this dad remembered him too and everything so that was that was a real blessing i could i could hear the uh the tenure brother rogers voice he was very very pleased and happy about this trip and the ability to be able to see his mom see his dad talk to his dad so that was real good but because he was gone and i wasn't working all week i've come here and spent two or three days here got all the ceiling grids put up all the cut-ins all the smaller pieces and everything down the lines got all those finished and done and i got all these the receptacles put in and the places for the uh cords to run across to get these set up so i had all these i got these hung um i don't remember when i did them thursday friday something like that i got these hung up so i did we we had this temporarily put in here this cords aren't going to be here eventually we'll get the sound booth back in the back um we'll have that cord this cord that's coming from over here is going to go straight to the sound booth and that chord is going to go straight to the sound boost so these chords won't be here but we just set it up temporarily so that we could try to get it to work now and see how it worked and my computer and the tablet that micah brought for zach to work on it's not quite the same especially if you're used to a church it has one that functions properly we're just kind of piece milling it with micah's knowledge and zach's help and getting it all put together so appreciate your indulgence during that period of time there may be a few glitches here and there but eventually brother roger i said it's going to get cameras and put them up here and we're going to get a sound booth put over there so it's going to operate everything so anyway so uh i i like it i think it turned out pretty good um i got a couple things i i think i could do to change it to where to be a little bit different but for now anyway but i appreciate the god providing for that and being able to get the receptacles put in some of that the hardest part was kind of running the wires behind the wall because there's styrofoam back in there and getting it through there was a little challenge but god blessed it and i'm so thankful for that and welcome to the house of god today and appreciate each one of you coming so amen we'll get right to the word now if we could and uh go to first kings if you'd stand to your feet if you could please we'll go to first kings chapter 13. amen first kings chapter 13. i'm going to attempt to see if this works i was going to do that the first day we did this and i didn't but i'm going to try and see if that works because if when angel can come in they're probably going to take all this up here so i don't want to take up my normal spot over there so if we're going to get more people that come in we'll probably have to put a few more chairs out so god bless you uh first kings chapter 13. i appreciate you on the hookup welcome if you're here the streaming so god bless you as well a few people have let me know of course they're streaming today so pray the lord richard bless you as well before we read the word let's just go to the author of the word for a moment of prayer precious jesus father we're indeed grateful lord of this place as brother zach has said and lord we are appreciative of the strength and the health life you give us we thank you lord for the faith we thank you lord for your protection we thank you lord that you've got us hedged lord and protected and god we're so thankful god that you're always with us and never leave us or forsake us and we do know that lord it may not may be before the rapture after the rapture we don't know but these doors are going to be shut one day and we won't have this privilege and we won't be able to meet like this again lord we're thankful god of this day we're thankful of this time we're thankful of giving us this building and the opportunity to come together to worship you and to glorify your holy precious name yes may your hand of mercy be upon us lord today and continue to speak to us from your word lord may it fall into the hearts of your people god and may it return lord accomplish what you would desire for to accomplish as you sent it forth for lord just use this voice as a mouthpiece an instrument lord to speak god what should have to be heard and said today god bless those that have come father bless those that are streaming those who may actually even archive later lord watch it god bless them exceedingly yes lord i pray that your hand will be upon us upon this nation god has a great decision coming up in the next couple of days that this nation is going to have to make and love we just pray that regardless of what happens and how it falls out god that lord that leader his heart is in your hands and god you're going to raise them up and you put them down as you see fit so we just committed to you and lord we uh pray that you would bless us and help us to do our part lord as god we know that the the rapture is imminent lord yes we but lord we truly we don't want to get to where we've become so heavenly bound with no earthly good glory play our part here and we do what you call for us to do while we're here so bless each one of us bless his servants today bless all that's done and said to further the gospel of the kingdom of jesus christ and for this service and these few people that are here today we committed to you and asked your blessings upon it now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen first kings chapter 13 we're just going to read two verses and we'll let you be seated it's another biblical old testament uh account like we read last week so it's a little lengthy in the reading but we'll just read two verses and we'll let it be seated uh the 23rd verse so we're in first kings chapter 13 and we're going to read the beginning of the 23rd and the 24th verse and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him and asked to went for the prophet whom he had brought back and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcass was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcass you could be seated if you'd like and pardon me a moment again i forgot to mention also brother roger when i talked to him the other day he told me that brother steve buffalos had been in the hospital uh with an infection so uh please remember him he's out of the hospital now but please remember him in prayer uh the lord would just touch him and of course bringing complete total recovery of his of his body so amen remember him in prayer now this thought came to me the other day as you all know uh brother roger collins had seven i actually had like nine meets and nights and meeting but uh before i had my tooth pulled that monday night i came a man brother john was here and came and brother roger made a a a um he alluded to this story in the bible and it really struck me strong so i decided to write that note down and as i was looking at something that the lord would have me to bring for today this came back to my heart and started looking at it and of course you know if if you've ever well if you're led of the lord you know how it works you know the lord will bless you here and if it's blessed there then it'll bless you over here and then it just keeps evolving and it just keeps building and the lord just blesses and blesses it blesses it so uh as the lord blessed this and as it continued to unfold i just trust and believe it to be the will of the lord today so uh it's his uh story it's it's it's quite an interesting story and and a thought came to my heart actually a title to put to it and the title today is whose god are you listening to amen whose god are you listening to so let's go back to the first verse uh first kings chapter 13. let's go back to the first verse and let's just read through this story we already read the kind of the end of the story we found out what happened to this man at the end of the story but let's let's go back to the beginning of it into the beginning of this chapter and find out how it got to this point and what happened in between those times and and what the difference would make see because uh and remember again even like last week keep in your mind the whole time of the title that we have that we placed on this uh remember last week's title you remember last week's title okay praise the lord this week whose god are you listening to last week was is that you lord this week is whose god are you listening to so as they go through this story think of that keep that in mind of course not just through this story but through this lesson today so first kings chapter 13 verse 1 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense now notice where this is this is a man of god this is a man of god this is a man of god or prophet of god that's being led by god okay so there came a man of god out of judah by the word of god so it's a man of god a prophet of god that's being led by the spirit of god that god is speaking to and voicing him to go a certain way right amen so he tells him to go into bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense and he cried against that now this man of god now cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and men's bones shall be burned upon thee so now look this is not a pleasant thing that god's sending this prophet to go declare upon these people and upon the king jeroboam this is quite the contrary this is a this is a curse this is a warning and a curse that this man of god by the word of god is giving to the king and upon the altar that the king is standing there outside of the word of the lord this man this jeroboam of course which is a wicked king was standing outside of the word of god because it wasn't his responsibility or his duty as the king to stand there and burn incense on the altar that's the priest job right that's not jeroboam's job but you know just as it happened to uh others um uh in the scripture uriah and different ones that they they got puffed up and think that they're uh more powerful than what they were and they had a greater position than what they should have had and and they took control over things that they shouldn't have taken control over so not only with this man wicked but he was going against the word of god and trying to perform something that wasn't his duty to perform only the priest was supposed to be the ones authorized by god they were consecrated by god to go into that place to burn those incense on behalf of the people to god wasn't the king's job to do was his responsibility he wasn't consecrated he wasn't in the right position he wasn't taught right it wasn't none of this was by the word of god so god sends this prophet down to tell jeroboam this is wrong and this altar is going to be cursed because of you amen third verse now and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord has spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out now that's a uh that's just not a fraywear pro of a prophecy that's not a prophecy that a person can say well it did or didn't come to pass it's not a prophecy that's going to happen 700 years later it's not going to be a pro it's not a prophecy that's going to happen down the road that nobody could verify or not verify it's a prophecy that was going to happen right then and there that day notice that's what the bible says the sign that day amen it was a sign to be fulfilled that day that the lord has spoken and the altar will be rent and the ashes would be poured out that was going to happen right there before them it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which he cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on this man in other words he's again prideful he's not humbling himself before the man of god prideful arrogant removes his hand from word never should have been been to begin with and he says lay hold on this man of god who's speaking evil against me and against this altar lay hold hands on him get rid of him basically what he's saying all right you should look in the scripture and they talk about laying hands on somebody it isn't laying hands on to pray for it's laying hands on to to beat and to torture and to get rid of that's what he's talking about lay hand on it means get rid of him right and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it again unto him and the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar the fulfillment of the prophecy right there before him amen according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of god notice that's the third time that it's referencing that this is by the word of god these things are happening by the by the oracle of god by the by the direction of instruction of god this is by the word of god three times now five verses three times it's made sure to mention this is by the word of god this is not a man that is a self-proclaimed prophet this is not a man who's going about his own business it's not a man who's giving his own word this is a man who's speaking by the word of god as that word comes to him amen the altar was rent ash is poured out which the man of god had given by the word of the lord and the king answered and said unto the man of god entreat now the face of the lord thy god the lord thy god notice he didn't say my god he said thy god and treated the the man of god entreat now the face of the lord thy god didn't claim him as his own even though this prophet came from judah and this is a king of israel and there should have been one people they should have been together it should have been one people together you know israel and judah split but they should have been one together but his god he's he's declaring here your god is not my god yeah and treat your god yeah because your god is god and that's the bottom line of it uh once they get out of trouble they don't act like it uh they want to claim god until they get out of trouble and when they're out of trouble they don't need god anymore right it's like people need god when they're sick people need god when they're dying people need god when they're in trouble but when they get it when they're out of trouble and when they're done being sick or whatever they don't need god anymore yeah he's turned their back on god well that's the same thing now happens here king answered the man of god entry now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the king's hand was restored to him again and became as it was before amen even though the curse was on him with curses upon the altar god still answered that man of god's prayer for that man's hand to come back right again amen and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward the man of god said unto the king if thou will give me half thy house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place for so was i it so was it charged me by the word of the lord praise the lord charged me by the word of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou came us so he went another way and returned not by the way which he came to bethel amen now listen this man of god has performed the responsibility that god by the word of god had given him right he had gone and had and had dispersed what god had requested of him to do amen and he leaves exactly like the word tells him to leave he goes some other way and leaves out uh uh by that way that came through bethel he's leaving a different way doing just exactly that's what the word said do amen god told him by the word of god do this do this do this do this don't do this don't do this and don't do this you know sometimes the don'ts are just as important as to do exactly right sometimes the don't do this is just as important as they do do this right amen sounds kind of weird i guess but it's true amen the dues are just as important too but sometimes the don'ts are just as important don't do this don't do that because it's god's word yes it's not a man's word it's not some rhetoric it's not something thrown out uh just haphazardly this is the word of god remember the word of god will not return void it will accomplish what it is sends out for it will accomplish that now we use that a lot i use it a lot to to talk about what the lord's doing in our services and when the lord sends the word out he sends it out for a purpose yes and we pray god accomplish the purpose that you sent it for whatever part you wanted it to play whatever point you wanted it to make whatever you wanted to be accomplished by it lord let it be accomplished whether it's by the voice of a singer or somebody testifying or the ministry whatever it is lord when you send it forth accomplish what you said forth for now that's a good and positive thought but what about the other side of it sometimes the word of the lord is brought forth as a curse as a responsibility the word of god is brought to us so that we are to live by it and follow it well what happens if we don't that's right it's still going to accomplish what it was sent forth for amen amen right you still want to accomplish that even if it's not something you say oh well this is good lord accomplish the blessings in our life and the and the growing in you lord but it's also going to accomplish what god sent it forth even if it becomes a negative in your life or seemingly negative anyway it will accomplish it anyway regardless so god's word is going to accomplish itself period he just uses willing subjects to do it through it's going to accomplish you can't deny that and you can't stop it it's going to accomplish it amen it will not return void it's going to do it so he's done everything now god has given this man of god a word of the lord to do this do this don't do this don't do this it's going to accomplish what he sent it forth for amen but he's got to obey it the man of god has got to obey it amen he's got to continue to obey it now 11th verse let's continue on the rest of the story because we haven't even gotten to the uh the the subject i want to talk about now they're dwelling on uh their dwell an old prophet in bethel so this man of god god this man of god has followed god's bidding he's followed the leading of the lord he has done what the lord wanted him to do the lord told him to go a different way he's going a different way by through bethel and there's a prophet in bethel an old prophet old man that is man of god we assume look at it by the readings if you go through the scripture and then samuel it's a younger man this is an older prophet now this older prophet in bethel and his sons came and told all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king then they all they told also to their father now if this if this prophet is in bethel and he's a real true prophet and we're going to believe that he was a prophet you know there's there's prophets that are that are prophets that follow the leading of the lord and do the bidding of god and there's prophets like balaam like we talked about last week that are hireling prophets and they don't do the bidding of the lord and they don't follow the will of the lord nor the word of the lord but they're still prophets because they're born that's a gift that brought that gift see and so this old prophet if he's in the land of bethel he's in a place that god has already cursed he's in a place where jeroboam is that the the cursing of god has come upon the altar and what god had promised that he would do to them and for them so if this old prophet is there and all of this wicked things are going on why isn't this older prophet screaming out against it now i understand the prophet's got to do with what the lord tells him to do this old prophet has got to speak only what god gives him to speak and just like makaya did there in the second kings he has to speak what god says to speak of course micaiah was one prophet that listened to god when there was 400 over here that just did whatever uh um ahab said right so you see the statistics there but anyway as we continue see if he's this old man this whole prophet that's in bethel why isn't something happening here for this old prophet to say something but this old prophet gets something when his sons come and tell him about what had just happened no doubt this old prophet probably thinking to himself and in his heart back about wow i haven't seen something like that happen in years i haven't seen anything like that i haven't seen anything that supernatural take place in years let's go meet this young guy so the sons come and tell him and this man this old prophet gets in his heart he wants to go find this guy so 12th verse their father said unto them now say let's go find this guy what way went he for his sons had seen what what way the man of god went which he came down came from judah and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled him in the ass and he rode thereon and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak tree and said unto him art thou the man of god that cameth for uh came is from judah and he said i am then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread now what was the word of the lord to this young man this this man of god do not eat any bread do not drink any water do not stop or lodge anywhere but do your bidding and come home amen he already told jeroboam that when jeroboam wanted to come and stay with him and he said i won't do it for the half of the kingdom i won't do it right but now this old prophet comes amen not the king not the wicked king but the old prophet see he comes come home with me and eat bread and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place now what's he doing he's repeating what god told him to do i can't do it god told me not to do it i'm not going to do it but look what the old man says for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread drink no water nor turn again by the way that thou camest he said unto him the old man now the old prophet he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art o prophet maybe as thou art i doubt right amen it might have been an old prophet yes but as this young prophet was i doubt amen just because of the actions right amen and and he uh now look and he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him the old prophet lied unto the young prophet amen but now what's the young prophet got to do he's got a decision to make correct because now this old prophet is not only saying hey come eat with me he's now saying but an angel came to me with the word of god telling him to go get this young prophet and come and stay with me and eat bread and drink water now what's the subject what's the title today who's god are you going to listen to the god that told you to go do this and to not lodge or eat or drink and come home are you going to listen to this man's god who's god you're going to listen to because this man that's the actual that's absolute decision this man has got to make right now he's got to decide right now is he going to listen and obey the god that told him what to do or is he going to listen to a god that this old man said what told him to do see there's a lot of voices in the land today friends there's a lot of voices a lot of things there's a lot of people talking there's a lot of people say well the lord said and the lord said you could turn on tvs and you can hear it all day long the lord said the lord said the lord told me the lord told me you can hear it and see it all the time there's all kinds of voices in the world today there's governments politics there's uh people everybody wants a voice everybody's got a voice but the problem i think is a lot of the times the problem is that people have become so devoid of listening to the word of god so devoid of even knowing when it's god speaking to them that they don't even know it's god talking to begin with right so is it god or is it god i don't know i just do what this one says or i just go with the see friend you cannot live and prosper in the lord on somebody else's revelation amen amen you cannot do it amen god has called you as individuals to live your life for him according to the calling of god in your life and when god tells you to do something i don't care how many other people come against it or say anything about it or tell you to do something different you do what god told you to do now understand it's not going to be anything unscriptural right amen it's not going to be anything unscriptural it's not going to be something sinful so well the lord told me to do this and that that god told you to do is sinful or against his word doesn't work that way amen it doesn't work that way but again a person has to be in tune to the holy spirit see god will only hold you responsible for what he tells you he's not going to hold the other person that lied to you what responsible he's going to hold you responsible it's just it goes back to the garden of eden like we've said many times when god told adam what to do when he came to the curse he god didn't even reference to the serpent or to eve or the woman she wasn't eve then but he didn't even reference to the serpent or to the woman what he told a a adam in the garden of eden god told adam don't do this don't do this you can do this this this and this but don't do this and don't do this remember sometimes the don'ts is just as important as the news because it's still god's word as long as it's still god's word it's just as important right and then when they fail and they all come to this great council of the three of them with god they're all passing the book of course to one or the other right but god does not hold the serpent responsible for what he told adam god doesn't hold eve responsible of the woman responsible for what he told adam god told adam do not do this amen now when he cursed the the ground and he he cursed the serpent and and the woman he did he didn't say but now did i tell you he didn't tell the woman that why did he tell her that because god didn't tell her he told adam so who's responsible adam it's adam's responsibility to do what god told him to do god is only going to hold you responsible for what he tells you amen he's not going to hold somebody else responsible i don't care if they lied to you i don't care if they deceived you i don't care if they tricked you into it god's going to hold you responsible for what he tells you not somebody else the question then is what god do you listen to who's god are you listening to whose revelation are you living on friend you cannot live on my revelation right my wife can't live on my revelation my children grandchildren cannot live on my revelation they have to live on their own amen they have to do what god calls them to do amen they have to listen to the god that speaks to them i got to do the same thing in my life i got to listen to the god that talks to me i can't go on somebody else's revelation i can't i don't we're not meeting in this beautiful building today because brother roger told me to right oh brother nat told me too we're meeting in this beautiful building today because god spoke to me amen amen and when the opportunity came in the and it opened up we just walked right into it i praise the lord here it is yes and thank god for it but i didn't do it because somebody else told me to right i didn't move to tucson because somebody told me to i didn't move to florida because somebody told me to i didn't go to the white mountains because somebody told me to i went because god told me to yeah right and you talk about the opposition friend yes you want to talk about opposition when god speaks to your friend you're going to get more opposition than you ever imagined you're going to get the devils and two hundred thousand demons on you like white on rice or white on white rice there's other kinds of rice in there anyway they're gonna be all over you like nothing why because they don't want you to accomplish what god is sending you forth to do right and if you do do it they want to curse you somehow to where you're not able to do it again right amen that's what happened to this young man i will read the rest of the story but we've already read what happened to him right that was the first couple of verses we read we found out what happened to the poor guy just because he was doing what god told him not to do right just because another man come across and lied to him lied to him that an angel spoke to him and told him by the word of the lord now will that old prophet have to pay a price for deception and lying of course he will right but who did god hold responsible for this young man's disobedience god did god held him responsible god didn't kill the old prophet god just killed the young prophet god just killed the man of god because he disobeyed let's read the rest of it as we'll continue on and he lied to him see not 18 first but he lied to him so he went back with him and did eat in the house in his house and drank water and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord for as much as thou has disobeyed the mouth of the lord and has not kept the commandment which the lord god had commanded thee but came us back and has eaten bread and drank drunk water in this place of which the lord did say to thee eat no bread drink no water thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers my mind how many times does disobedience lead to death right yes since the garden of eden yes when god told adam the day you do this the day you die the day you disobey is the day you die how many times has disobedience brought death sometimes spiritual death sometimes just a separation from god sometimes a physical death but it always accomplishes what god said it will yes disobedience brings death you will not your carcass shall not come to the sepulchre of thy followers and we read 23rd verse and he came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled him settled for him in the ass to whip for the prophet whom he had brought back when he was gone a lion met him by the way slew him and his carcass was cast in the way they asked to buy it the lion stood by the carcass lion didn't even eat it he just killed him right and the lion stood there lying set there after he killed him remember the opossum last week who has control over nature who has control over these animals he told the possum to come down the street and come down the alley and sit right there at that prophet's door right right sit right there at brother branham's door waiting for him to pray on before him waiting there with those babies suckling on her waiting there with the dude falling on her all night long waiting for that man of god to come pray as soon as he prayed she got up and took her babies and went down the hall uh went down the way looked back thank you sir went back in the woods and this lion commissioned by god can i say it that way yes okay this lion commissioned by god kills this young man and just late just leaves and laying there and just sets there doesn't do anything to him doesn't eat him just leaves it there and behold men passed by and saw the carcass cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcass as they came and told the city where the old prophet dwelled the lion was just sitting there even when other people passed by to see the scene and saw the carcass laying there they saw the lion sitting there the lion had completed his job he wasn't after the other guys he wasn't eating the old prop of the young prophet he was just sitting there because he had done what he was supposed to do but this unfortunately young prophet was deceived by this older prophet into doing something that god told him not to do and friend the bible tells us many many places what we should do and many many places what we should not do right that's why we live the lives we live in and dress the way we dress not the way we do and go the places or not go places that we don't go because god has commissioned and called and separated the group of people out of the world and we are those people amen we are those people so when god tells you to do something you say what is in his word sure there's many places in his word but there are times that god speaks to you personally now that's the time we must have our ears ready our spiritual acuity ready for what the lord would speak to us about or want us to do or tell us about i i really like it when someone is in a as a pastor for many years in the valley of decision and and trying to make a decision and they'll tell me and they'll say brother mutant i just want to take this before the lord and i said praise the lord brother sister i'll be with you and we'll go to the lord together with this right now we may be in two different domiciles maybe in two different places but we're still going to the same god right amen and we're coming to god to find out lord what is your word on this what would you say what would you have me do amen amen what would you have me do job had a whirlwind fire thundered lightning but he said god comes by in a steal small voice he misses him but that spiritual acuity of knowing the voice of the lord amen being in tune to the voice of the lord i told you many times it's the first time i'm going to say this since my mom passed away but my mom could have called me on the phone and the and i didn't need caller id the first second i heard that woman's voice on the other end of the line i knew exactly who it was now how did i know exactly within five seconds of who was on the other line without caller id how would i know that because i've heard my mama's voice my entire life plus nine months i've been listening to her voice all my life i know her voice i know it when she speaks to me i know when she's the one on the other end of the line i know it's her because i can tell her voice well friend that's the exact same thing that's how you know the voice of the lord people have asked me well how do i know it's god i said well do you talk to him very much right do you have a relationship with him do you converse with him do you talk to him has he ever talked to you have you ever listened to his voice have you ever been in a in a still small a quiet place to converse and to talk with him and let him talk back if you've got a relationship friend you know it he knows it when you speak he knows it's you when he speaks you know it's him that's how you know the difference it's about how do i know it's the devil it's not the devil because first of all to be according to the word won't be off the word the devil make sure and get you off the word even though 99 of truth comes from the devil it's that one percent that perverts the other thing is you'll know his voice if you have a relationship with him and you know him and you know him intimately when he speaks to you you know it because you've been talking to him right you've been in conversation with him you've been in fellowship and in friendship and relationship with him that's how you know his voice it's very simple if you don't yeah you're not gonna know its voice you might but you might very well just be deceived too but if you've had that relationship and you know it's god and god vindicates and backs up his word you know it's god amen i know when god speaks to me friend i know it because he's proved it very much and i know when he speaks he backs it up my man in ways that are miraculous and supernatural am i i trust that we could probably stand here for the rest of the day with testimonies along those lines it's not just me i understand that but i'm the one talking so i have to draw my own experience so but i know you have it too but it's listening to that voice some people seem more interested and busier with their lives to fix you than they are to fix themselves right right it's not my job to fix you it's not your job to fix me or someone else right that's not my my my job my position is to worry about numero uno right and and and my relationship with the lord amen amen now i mean obviously it's my heart and my uh my thoughts and my prayers towards others absolutely but i'm not here to fix them i'm just here to try to help them right amen i'm just here to try to help you if i can if you need help i'll try to be here every second i can to help you every one of you amen i am you're on the hook up or you're sitting here i i guarantee you promise if you need me i'll do everything i can to be there to help the lord praise god but i'm not here to to babysit you or to uh to fix you all this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong you know what i had to tell a brother one time he he called and said something said well don't say so and so i said brother if there's any correction that needs to be done god will do it yes that's not my position that's not my job the bible says vengeance is mine saith newton bennett you no it says vengeance his mind saith the lord that's not my job that's for him to do right amen if there's anything that needs to be done or fixed let god do it let god fix it god is again god is only going to hold you responsible for what he tells you to do amen amen let's look at another story here notice oh let's go to first samuel first samuel chapter 15. notice though now this old prophet for this scripture reading never suffered any consequences he is the one that lied that got this poor young man killed but he suffered no consequences that you can see now we obviously know there's going to be consequences for his actions obviously but right then at that point god only held that young man responsible for what he told him not the old man and and and what god holds this old prophet responsible for is not what he told the young prophet he's not going to hold that man responsible for what he told the man of god he's only going to hold him responsible for lying about what he said that's what he's going to be held responsible for amen now first samuel chapter 15 uh let's start with verse nine y'all know the story very well micah probably more than most of you micah's probably heard me tell this story more than anybody i told this to a lot of churches back east and micah drove me around so but it's saul now i don't know if you have a scofield bible if you have a scope of the bible my scofield bible at the top of chapter 15 it says saul's incomplete obedience well friend i know scofield was a small smart man i know a lot of his notes are good they're accurate i know some of them that aren't brother brandon said some of schofield notes are wrong and i've known by studying through my bible that there's a lot of his notes that are wrong but i know he's a highly intelligent man a theologian but i'm sorry whoever put this and i'm going to assume it's him couldn't be more wrong this is not saul's incomplete obedience story is about saul's blatant disobedience right not in complete obedience friend i'm sorry but to me and before god there is no such thing as incomplete obedience you either obey god's word or you don't period there is no income why did 80 of what you said lord what good does that do that's right god called you to do 100 he expects 100 percent he's not asking you to follow him 80 he wants a hundred percent of you right he just said lord i i i believe this word i believe this message up to a point what do you believe it at all then right why do you live this at all look friend it all that's going to do is make a human miserable right amen all it's going to do is drive you crazy and make you miserable and you live a miserable life if you can't believe it if you can't live it if it's not in you to do i can't believe i'm saying this but go live in the world at least enjoy some of what you got right because if you're not going in you might as well enjoy this little bit because it's all you're gonna have that's right yes i've had people tell me the things that about others in the world and i said well pray for them that's the first thing obviously we pray for them there's a soul in there worth 10 million worlds pray for them pray the lord and pray they'll see the lord they'll come to the lord but otherwise let them alone let them have their riches let them have their wealth let them have their fun life and their bars and their carousing whatever the gambling whatever they do let them have it's all they're going to have right yes if they're going to end up in demise anyway at least let them enjoy a little bit but friend don't be miserable here and go to hell right you understand what i'm saying amen i'm sorry but i'm kind of a black and white preacher kind of as the shoe fits wear it you know i'm not preaching any one person but if the shoe fits wear it and don't curl up your toes and say the shoe doesn't fit either if it fits put it on don't curl up your toes and say well these shoes don't fit well they don't because you're curling your toes you're curling your little spirit up there and you said i don't believe this that's your choice but if the shoe fits friend until you wear it but it's it's a can you go with me a minute to say don't be miserable here and end up going to hell that's right if you can't live it if you're not predestined if you're not one of his and do the best you can to live the happiest life you can on this earth enjoy it to the to the to the best of your ability because once life leaves this body you got nothing that's right that's the great hope that we have amen we have a happy life here and god blesses us and we're going to have eternal life and live in perfection with our savior amen and with one another thank you amen yes i'm looking forward to spending eternity folks that okay amen i am samuel now no incomplete obedience it's either obedience or disobedience period but saul said ninth verse saw in the people spared a gag and the best of the sheep and the oxen of the fatlings and the lamps and all that was good would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refused that they uh they destroyed utterly now god's commission to saul the king was to utterly destroy and kill the amalekites and everything that was living human and animal amen god even told him to kill the women the infant and the sucklings right kill them all eradicate them destroy them every animal every person every baby kill them yes that's god's instructions amen saul as we just read came comes back with a gag and and some of the sheep because him and the people decided that it would be good if we kept some of the best of the animals and what was what does it say vile and refused they destroyed utterly right right my question then is whose god are they listening to because the god that i read that's the god of this bible told him to destroy every bit of it right man well if god told him to destroy every bit of it don't you think every bit of it is violent refuse amen so who made the determination now that only this little select group was violent refused oh well only these over here are violent refused no every bit of us violent refused in the in the eyes of god and what other eyes matter saul's eyes didn't matter people's eyes didn't matter it did samuel the prophet of god there his didn't matter the only ones that mattered was god right god said every bit of us file and refuse kill it get rid of it amen then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he had turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night again the word of the lord came to samuel when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal samuel came to saul saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord listen to what saul says now blessed are the lord saul says i have performed the commandment of the lord can you see it's the same blindness that people live with today oh i've done what god said do well 99 of it 75 of it whatever you wanted part of it you wanted to do whatever suited you yeah you did what suited you you you obeyed god's word to a point that you're like i don't want to do that well what good is that that's not obedience that's not incomplete obedience that is disobedience amen right but psalm is all mine is saying is telling the prophet of god and and saul knew samuel and god knew as saul knew that samuel had a direct communication with god almighty as the prophet of god right and yet he's standing in front of this man samuel and he's saying i have done or performed the commandment of the lord what's samuel's response samuel said well then what meaneth this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowering of the oxen which i hear if you had done what god said dude these animals wouldn't be here right if you had done what god said do they would be dead in uh and with the amalekites and the rest of them that you killed right right so if you've done what god said do they wouldn't be here saul said they have they they passing the bug again they have brought from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice now first of all i have done what god said do samuel says no you haven't sought these sheep and these oxen are still back here i hear them if you'd have done what god said now he tries to throw it off well the people the people said that they wanted to keep these now not only is he throwing and passing uh passing off on somebody else but now he's saying we have the people have spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed god didn't ask for those animals to be sacrificed to him if god had one of those animals to be sacrificed to him he would have asked you right yeah but he didn't ask you for them amen amen all the rest we have destroyed but first of all he says i've done it samuel says no you have he says well the people decided to because what we're going to do samuel oh the the the high and mighty holier than now pious saul we're gonna take these animals and we're gonna sacrifice them to the lord something that is a stink in god's nostrils you're gonna take and give to him god said kill it if he said kill it it's a stink in his nose everything that touched it everything every hoof every ground that it set on kill it violent refuse oh we're going to say this and sacrifice this to the lord god doesn't want a stinky sacrifice amen i've said this many times but that's like coming up to me after church and say brother you that was a wonderful sermon we love you and your family let us treat you to the sushi restaurant i mean really go eat raw fish that's not my idea of fine dining is sushi i hate sushi i've ate it twice my first and my last i was sick for three days michael loves it when we lived in the mountains he worked at a restaurant up there he would bring that stuff home every night i had to make it go to his room the smell of it made me nauseated i could not smell it you understand what i'm saying now this is like saying okay brother i want to treat you to the sushi restaurant uh i love you brother sister but no thanks that is out i don't do sushi but you understand it's like saying i want to do something good for you but i'm going to do it on my terms i'm going to do something that would honor you but i want to do it the way i want to do it well if you really want to do something that's going to be pleasing to the person you want to honor ask them what they want ask them what they want to do ask them where they want to go but saul didn't care the people said oh we thought we'd have these sheep and you know that that was just an excuse this for the shaving the sheep to sacrifice was just an excuse it was just a reason a scapegoat to try to get it doing what they should have been doing to begin with oh we saved the best for what there's nothing there that's the best oh brother newton we'll give you the best sushi there is no best sushi amen doesn't exist not to me no offense to anybody that loves sushi including my son nobody this uh now i can smell it now so i'm a little bit better but i hate it you understand yes that's what i'm talking about right blatant disobedience put him out of favor with god amen and god set him aside and put him apart and and samuel told him i'll have to skip down because my time's gone saul said unto samuel yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord 20th verse now and have gone the way which the lord sent me and brought ag the king uh of the amalekites and have utterly destroyed the amalekites god said kill a gag samuel had to unsheath his saul's sword just to kill again to fulfill what god said to him and samuel said that the has the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft you talk about demonic witchcraft wickery demons devils just had it with this mess yesterday and all this devil ween devil weenie i hate that i'm glad it's over for another year the world can celebrate what they want but it's people don't understand the kind of spirits they invite their homes and their lives and families right and these spirits that are real friends oh well i don't feel it i don't see any effects oh you'll feel the effects all right they'll be so subtle you don't realize it's going to rip your family apart and send you to hell yes for the rebellion as the sin of witchcraft stubbornness iniquity of idolatry and that's exactly what saul did witchcraft is exactly what saul did yes is it not because right after this is when samuel died and saw had to go to the witch of vendor to get samuel to come up from the dead actually literally performing the act of witchcraft amen right right yeah the dead person came up but why to the act of spiritualism wickery demons and samuel came up and was still there told him why have you called me from my rest and he was still a prophet because he said you and your sons will be with me this time tomorrow prophesying right he said if the lord has turned you away what can i do about that amen for what disobedience and god gave saul chance after chance after chance just like in the garden of eden non-obedience has led to death many many times god help us amen i never want to be to that point but we got to live our lives we have to be what god called us and do what god called us to do amen let me see i've got a couple more scriptures i just want to read them real quick we'll close here um amen look what look what uh paul said in galatians the first chapter i'm just going to read it here galatians the first chapter um you can go back i was going to read from the sixth verse but for sake of time um let's start with the 11th verse but i certify you brother that the gospel which was priests of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ now we know that he said at the feet of gamalia we know he went met with peter after his eyes were open and it was with peter but look what he's saying he's saying a knowledge i gained yes but i only am in front of you today because of the revelation that jesus has given me amen amen i know i'm not on another man's revelation i'm not here to preach what another man's preached i'm not here to give you what somebody else says is truth i can only give you what god has given me is true revelation you do the same by the revelation of jesus christ for ye have heard of my conversation time passed the jewish religion how that i'm beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it profit in the jewish religion about above many my equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood wasn't concerned with somebody else's thought or revelation i was only in revelation or concerned with the revelation that i got from the god that now lived in me the one who separated from me my me from my mother's womb that's the only one i'm concerned with that's the one i followed yes that's the one i live by now he told others paul told others follow me as i follow christ amen did he not follow me as i follow christ but that is that is living by the revelation of paul look let's just read this scripture here um i believe it's in revelation chapter 9 or acts chapter 19 acts chapter 19 here it is acts chapter 19. let's see there's people that tried to live by paul's revelation see what happened i i quote this many times in acts chapter 19 uh we'll begin with the 11th verse god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought for brought unto the sick handkerchiefs aprons diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them i keep buying prayer cloths from brother i'm in this in this spot right here i keep it in this place right here then certain of the vagabond jews exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjourn you by jesus who paul preached now who's got the revelation right who's god is he listening to exactly and there were seven sons of one ski of a jew and chief priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are you he didn't recognize this man he recognized paul he recognized jesus by the life that was in them because this is spirit to spirit friend now it may have been in a human vessel that was standing in front of them but it was a spirit speaking out to that spirit and said i recognize the spirit of jesus christ god almighty the re and the same spirit that was in paul but i don't recognize that spirit in you and that spirit of that man jumped on this other man and he ran out of the house naked and wounded right because he was living off of paul's revelation he was living on what paul said he was living on the jesus whom paul preached you can't have a jesus just who paul preached or your parents or your pastor or anybody you've got to have your own revelation amen you don't go by just the god that somebody else is saying what is god speaking to you what is god telling you right brother brown god spoke to our former pastor brother greene one time and this very thing when he was getting ready to go out onto the mission field spoke to him and it's in acts 4. i'm just going to read a couple of verses i was going to start further up but um let's just start with a verse 18 and they called him commanded not to speak at all teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard right praise the lord we're only going to say what god gives us to say we're only going to live on the revelation that god gives us we're only going to go and say what god says and takes us that's all that matters we're not going to live by your dictates you tell us not to do this i'm sorry more pleasing to god and we want to be pleasing god amen amen we want to be pleasing to god and go where god sends us say what god tells us to say not vary from that word one iota but stay right on it amen regardless of the ridicule regardless of the the the shame or whatever somebody else may lay upon you or some name they may call you we talked about that a couple weeks ago friend right forget about all that amen probably harder for you young people no doubt it's hard growing up today in this world and the life and the things the way things are today be a christian confess a christian live like a christian look like a christian hard amen very hard but it was hard in our day not near as hard i think probably a million times harder now than it was then to live a christian life to be a godly person to let god rule you and live through you amen and can i i know some of your school age please don't when somebody tries to ask you or say something about why the way you look or please don't say it's my religion don't let it be religion right right man i lived this way and i look this way because it's pleasing to my lord jesus and that's it and that's all that matters it's pleasing to my lord and i want to be pleasing to my lord amen nothing on them people you don't look down on them you don't make them feel bad you don't post yourself up because of it but you just simply i just want to be pleasing to the lord jesus and i believe that my bible teaches me that this is what's pleasing to him so this is how i live this is what i do oh your mom and daddy make it no i do it because i want it right god wants a free will offering not an offer as the beach upside the head with but a free will offering and that's not just finances that's your life right amen god wants it of of your own free will that's why we're free moral agents yes he wants you of your own free will to live for him to serve him to love him amen who's god are we going to listen to that's right man i'm not responsible to what god tells you you are you're not responsible to what god tells me or one another amen amen you are responsible for what god tells you yes amen amen praise the lord let's stand if we could praise the lord i'm so thankful god has made a way though as god has spoke i mean you think about the unique life of brother brown you think about the unique life that
