brings forth your word may our hearts be open to receive it father it's time to be fortified and much more with your word father knowing that a rapture is imminent and a dead encounter will show themselves soon grant the lord in your name we pray the lord jesus christ amen amen yes i believe the lord heard that yes sir thank you amen there are testimonies at this time absolutely um uh here we are in the last day and you know through the years and brother um bennett touched on it last week that um when we're adopted we um get into um you know we are adopted and then we're and then we get it and then we're given our position and so through the years i've heard this about you know being knowing our position that we need to know our position in christ and so i knew i was adopted and so i didn't know what my job was and i'd have to and uh and and i have to back up on that because about 20 years or more ago god showed me what to do and but you know still we i still had those thoughts well what's my position you know thinking that it was different than my job you know and i don't know why but and uh and and god revealed to me that and i'm telling this because there's other people that are going through this too not just me that i i went through of knowing what is my position what is my job in christ if you go down to the wire brothers and sisters we got to be out talking to people and telling them about the lord i realize i'm not just saved for myself i'm safe for other people to get that word out there and we've been given a job and so um whether it's praying for those who are doing it or yadda yadda so i so i just i the lord revealed to me that i don't have to have a name for my position i don't have to have that and here i thought i had to have a name all this time i'm a prophet i'm an evangelist i'm a what i mean that's i'm not a body minister but you know it's just you know what i'm saying i don't have to have a name for what i do or or have to know i just need to follow the leading of the holy spirit that's it that's all i need to do i don't have to have a name for it and it could and wherever he leads me that's right that's my position amen amen god bless you exactly right i'll bless you i just want to encourage people amen amen good system of peace absolutely amen anyone else yes ma'am absolutely i just wanna confess and confess praise the lord for healing my love feels good to have them lungs working good huh yeah mine was really bothering me a couple of months ago that kobe probably tried to attack gurgling and stuff and now they're clear amen yes sir praise the lord for you anyway the lord i believe has shown you what to do and it's helped me amen i'm gonna continue like brother newton said god will provide a way for you yes and he has provided a way yes amen and listen and god help us to recognize it yes when he sends it we humble ourselves to it yeah exactly true hey amen anyone else song okay you do you have a song uh after you how about that i just need a mic either yours or my dad's uh okay i'll get you mine how about that we don't have a little microphone no more huh well we only have the two okay i thought we had a handheld bike we do but i can't play it all right sorry i'm gonna try it sure you can i know this song came to my heart uh because usually i try to sing like christmas songs or easter songs depending on the holiday one came to my mind but it didn't quite work out and then this came to my mind because without christ there is no christmas this is my one of my mom's favorite songs i don't know she hadn't stuff to say last time i sing it i don't know if she wants to share why this is one of your favorite songs that's one of my favorite songs because being an orphan i never had anything or anybody and when i came to know god that song just spoke to me that's all i've got that's all i want [Music] christ alone will i glory though i could pride myself in battles [Music] successes like diamonds in my hands but those trophies by which i stand [Music] in [Music] my source [Music] beyond my weakness [Music] my lord [Music] and everything my source is [Music] is [Music] my glory is [Music] my [Music] is [Music] [Applause] praise the lord yes hey man nothing but the truth yes i might just leave it up here for now for time's sake i guess praise god i love that that is nothing but the truth amen amen we put our hands to it we try we try but we fail god does it it's done amen amen well i had a song on my heart in a while i'm sure y'all heard it before but i felt senior man amen

visit with him and that we worship him and that he visits with us he promised you inhabit the praises of his people amen so we're here to worship and praise him thank the lord there's been so much of everything else going on around the world and all of what happens but amen we come into this house to worship and to praise him grace and lift him up glorify him only one worthy praise the lord everybody talks about all the others and everything in sports going on today in football games and then raising up all kinds of people and they can that's okay nothing wrong with sports but you know

lord and that's why i worship and love him amen with all of our hearts praise the lord god bless you welcome to the house of the lord once again it's honored to have brother wilson's sister tomorrow with us today so yeah thank you to be with us god bless each one of you missing quite a few today especially from last week the zinc has went back home uh for the weekend i thank her for this week brother tom had to do some things for the gym show still coming up so they're not with us i haven't heard from the frappos or sister sister julie and of course the prayer requests you heard about art so listen remember the bios terrorists and prayer brother arch and he was bothering my i don't really know why the circumstances but sarai just sent me the text she had to take him to urgent care so we'll remember that prayer so but god bless you thank you for coming being here today appreciate the lord most of all or we can all be here but if he's not here means nothing we might as well go down to the denny's right here and have a nice little meal because that's about all it would amount to but if he's here healing is met salvation the spirit of god whatever need you have amen praise the lord so let's turn our bibles now uh saint john we're going to go back here again third part of who am i amen saint john chapter three we'll uh begin reading in the same place that we read from before is this on light doesn't look like it's kind of dull probably need to change the batteries in it i'm going to use this one brother as long as it can hear it's okay okay yeah if it kind of goes out or something say something to me or something we got batteries but i'm just thinking maybe that's why the lights kind of dull i don't know but anyway st john chapter three i i never don't need a mic but we do it because it helps the uh coming into the camera for the streaming and for the archiving later so that's the reason we do it but st john chapter three uh we're gonna read a couple of verses of scripture here as we have been the past couple of weeks but let's bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could amen lord jesus we're so thankful father of your blessings your grace your love your mercy lord what can we say god it fails us so many times with the human tongue to be able to thank you for how much we love you and what we feel in our hearts and what you mean to us lord in life god i believe maybe sometimes that's why you give us another language in this life that we call tongues god because it just seems like sometimes we just don't have enough human words to be able to thank you and praise you enough for all that you do for us every day god you never leave us or forsake us you bless us strengthen us of course god your mercy your grace your love is so bountiful in our lives lord and a people that was so unworthy and so undeserving that god you made us worthy father because as it was saying earlier you became us that we might become you so that it's by your grace that we can be robed in your righteousness today stand upon the promises of your word god because you give them to us and it would be negligent on our part to think anything other than that yes lord it's uh it's a word that we look to that god we desire to become because it's something that you wanted us to do where you want us to be father to help us realize who we are and you god yes lord that's that's our standard that's our placement that's our adoption that's where we live that's where you want us to be and i don't believe lord this bride will ever go out of here until she recognizes that each and every one of us lord yes so god may you bless us again with this service bless us father with what you would speak to us this word lord this message all that you've given to us god we just give it back to you in servitude and love lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that will try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done today in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen amen amen john chapter three we're just going to read two verses this time verse beginning with verse 15 for whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the whosoever believeth that him shall not perish but have everlasting life amen you can be seated if you'd like amen i'm going to lay a challenge down real quick before i get started uh brother wilson was streaming the service wednesday night and i appreciate his comments that he gave after the service was over and he had some thoughts he wrote down some notes and things and that was that was going through his mind during the service and i thought well why don't you just come preach it to us the challenge has been laid amen i have a lot of respect for your love brothers and so you are welcome amen amen i know the challenge is out now but and i mean it i don't say that just for uh just for effect or just here but i absolutely mean it so uh amen so thank you brother god bless you we want to continue on with the thought that we had uh the past couple of weeks on who am i and uh try to pick up lord willing from where we left off last week uh and by the way i really enjoyed the the fellowship last week i enjoyed the meal i appreciate all the efforts everything that went into making it a success uh next door i thank the landlord for allowing us to use the place next door and uh and a lot went into it it's a big effort is it's it's work uh it's uh but uh a lot of cooking and all but it was a real blessing real blessing to me i really enjoyed it i loved the fellowship love to have everybody all sitting together there and we filled up that room thanks you know that room was almost too small with the food and everybody the table so but it was a real blessing and i enjoyed it very much you know i uh you know when when we moved in here and that place moved in next door and immediately we started praying that the lord would move that out and my thought my thought process was god that just didn't want those evil spirits hanging around you know this close you give us this place and i told you we lay hands on that wall and those people that month two months later they were gone but tabitha told me right after that they had left uh that i you know my testimony and how i've been praying about that she said i felt like the lord opened that up because we was going to need it so amen so thank god believing that both of those things came to pass amen god moved those spirits out and was able to use the place so thank the lord for that amen and again the man let us have it free of charge so uh it was a real blessing and i appreciate that god's so good to us amen so thank the lord so we'll just continue on again where we left off last week now we want to i want to get the focus on that uh eternal life part because that eternal life again is remembrance to us of what eternity is and and who is eternal and what is eternal right uh we all talk about him boast about having eternal life but but we recognize that that as we look at one another there's something beyond that that we recognize is eternity because we had a beginning we'll have an end but the only thing that's eternal is god because god never had a beginning and anything that never had a beginning will never have an end that eternity part now i want to enter into that sonship part the sonship christ and the sons of god and as we are sons and daughters of god today a lot of times um uh the bible references and we talk about sons of god and it says sons of god but you understand that that's just humanity that doesn't leave you sisters out right it means humanity sons of god is humanity not just men right it is men and women amen we're sons and daughters sometimes we'll add the daughter apart but the fact of it is it just encompasses the entire humanity so as we mentioned sons of god so i want to get into that son ship a little bit today and and uh and read some that i had mentioned a couple of weeks ago that maybe uh maybe something that that that might help a little bit but uh but let's go over to romans chapter eight and let's uh let's start into this if we could we we read galatians chapter four and we could go back there too but i want to since we've read that i want to go to uh romans chapter 8 now we'll begin reading with verse 14 romans 8 14 and uh and talk about this sonship because remember a son has a beginning a son a daughter is something that is begotten right anything that is begotten had a beginning amen amen anything that's begotten had a beginning has an ending thus is not eternal it may live on and on and on even our lives and our spirits uh just like people who end up going to hell there is no such thing as an eternal hell right right because if there's an eternal hell you got to have eternal life to be in hell and anybody that has eternal life won't be in hell right there's no point of hell being eternal right so it might go forever and ever but it is not eternal because hell was created for the devil and his angels so if it was created it meant it had a beginning if it had a beginning it will have an end so we understand so as sons as a son ship that had a beginning was a begotten so that begotten had it has an end that sun again is that adoptive place the placement of relationship that we have now not placement like sister matisse is talking about but relationship amen so let's go to uh well we're in romans 8 14 let's read here romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen so if you are led by god that you are if you have the holy spirit of god that holy spirit in you is leading you then that leading just proves that you are a son of god because otherwise you would you would reject the word you would reject that spirit you would reject that leading right and anybody that rejects that leading cannot be considered a son a son is someone who is going to be obedient and be led by that spirit so as we're led by that spirit as galatians said because we are sons of god amen we are led by the spirit of god so you see the the the intertwining of these two facets amen uh scofield has in his notes here that we become we become in a relationship as sons when we're born again but i beg to differ now in our human flesh we come to the recognition as our humanity is that we are sons of god absolutely that's a beginning place for us in our recognition of it in our humanity but if you are a son of god now you have always been a son of god because you came from god if you came from god that makes you a son of god a part of god from before the foundation of the world so if you were born again you didn't become a seed because you were born again you are born again because you were a seed amen so it's it's transverse on the in the scripture uh like i said a scofield's note said that you you you come in relationship as adoption when you when you were born again or upon the new birth but you could not be reborn if you hadn't already had that relationship that seed that placement of what you what part of god you are to begin with if it wasn't there to begin with it was never going to be there but if it was there to begin with it will always be there praise the lord amen so as we are led as as we are led by the spirit of god we are sons of god that's that's a proving ground that's a place of acceptance amen because you're led of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear which kind of goes to our wednesday night service we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear amen which the world is putting on the the people this world's putting fear upon the whole world uh in my life which my short 56 years will be wednesday now for my short 56 years i've never seen the world in such a tr a tumultuous uh place of fear i i've just it's fear has so gripped people today right i think it's probably some in part due to the fact that people have rejected god turned their back on god the unknown of death people are scared of death used to be people were willing to lay down their lives for uh for different reasons people uh a military whatever nowadays it seems like uh people are just scared to death to die friend death is just that open door like brother said just that open door that allows that allows us out of this past house amen i don't want to rush it but when the lord's ready for me i'm ready amen i'm not going to push him on it i'm not gonna say let's hurry this process lord uh many of all my family's gone many friends but uh but i want to do it as he leads to do it you see so uh whatever he does but there's fear such a fear but the spirit of god has not come to bring fear right right amen a bondage that fear is a bondage exactly you might just talk about wednesday night a bondage that keeps people bound that fear is what is one thing that does it but you have received the spirit capital s of adoption whereby we cry about father that spirit of adoption that placement amen we already know that we are sons of god like we said before the last couple services the prodigal son was always the son yes amen he was never not a son he was a son in the beginning when he was out with his nose dipped in the pig trough he was a son when he came back home he was a son always a son never not a son so as he was that son that spirit of adoption uh comes to to place us in a position of faith see it's hard to have faith when you don't know who you are when you don't know where you're at in the body of christ and who you are in christ uh even if you are in christ a lot of people still probably even doubt that they are in christ or a christian uh they don't they don't uh have a revelation of that so that that spirit that placement amen helps us be able to have that faith and the faith is what casts out the fear right the faith will cast out the fear so if you have that faith because you know when you're standing on the word of god you know who you are in the body of christ and there's no worry there's no fretting over it you know that you can stand on that word and say satan gifty behind me you have no place in this home you have no place in this family you have no place in this church you have no place in my life amen and you can stand on that and faith will move that mountain that's right faithful get rid of that doubt faithful get rid of that fear faith will get rid of that devil yes and put you in that place where you should be standing where you should be positioned in him and that places is where god can use us right how many so many times i thank god he keeps me healthy yes relatively healthy strong in him and and i thank him for that not because i enjoy being healthy i do but i i thank him because i can't serve them the way i want to if i'm sick i can't serve him the way i want to if i'm if i'm in a lowered position or or incapable of doing something right if i'm incapable of it then i can't serve him the way i want to right i got to be in a in a positionally miserly physically financially spiritually to be able to serve him the way i want to and if i'm in a falling condition down somewhere even if it's just physical i can't serve him like i want to i thank him god thank you for that amen not for my benefit but that i might do something for your kingdom that's the whole point yes amen father father praise the lord thank you for that the spirit capital s again itself beareth witness with our spirit lower s like we had on the board the past couple of weeks our spirit that we are the children of god yes so that spirit that capital s now that spirit is coming to our soul i took the drawing off so i can't i got something else i just it's not a secret i just uh didn't want you focusing on that the whole time or looking at that but that capitalist that holy spirit god's spirit coming in our soul taking over permanent resident of our soul our spirit our human spirit then recognizes because there has to be an acknowledgement because remember the the the soul is the nature of our human spirit so if that's the case then that nature that is in there now which is god god's nature god's own life is is in there that seed has become germatized and is growing that seal is laid on there and that soul is the permanent residence of that holy spirit in you then that human spirit bears witness to that spirit amen comes under subjection if you will to that spirit it has to yes amen has to come under subjection now of course there's a lot of times we'll uh do things according to that uh human spirit that we shouldn't do imagination conscious infection reason memory those things will take over and cause the body to do something it shouldn't do but the but the but the human spirit has to recognize witness when there's a new birth that's taken place in you that's why there's a change that's why there's an there's a visible change not that my ugly face is changed but that that there's a difference in us than when we weren't born again or when we weren't what we should have been in him even could have been going to church it could have been in church for years could have been baptized a dozen times right right but until his spirit comes amen amen it's just you just take just go take another bath right go dip in the pool because that's the equivalent of it and you can be baptized a hundred times doesn't matter right when his spirit comes then there's a witness to the human spirit and that body says it recognizes that and there's a change amen you're not the person you used to be paul said the things i used to love i now hate things i used to hate i now love why because he was a different person old things have passed away because behold all things have become new that's when you recognize that's your sonship you recognize i'm a son of god you reckon and then you come to a recognition that i have always been a son of god even when my nose was stuffed into the pig trough i was still a son i didn't know it right i didn't recognize it and a lot of me and my human spirit didn't want to i didn't want to i i was a sinner i enjoyed being a sinner but saints when that recognition come very much and i began to realize who i really was it the world became a miserable place amen when i lived in san fran i lived in sin i did but when i become a child of god and that recognition hit me that became the pig trough that became why it's like when when the prodigal son came to himself see the bible said he came to himself when you come to yourself you recognize oh my god i'm eating stuff that the hogs won't even eat i've got my face dipped into something that but you see where but that's where you were you recognized it and then it become a stinky filth in your nostril right because you recognize you're a son of god yes that spirit recognizes i'm a child of god and then and then everything about you your life atmosphere who you are how you act where you go what you listen to what you do what you watch everything change what you wear everything changed amen because you're a different person new creature amen because that spirit capitalist witness to your spirit amen in the human spirit it's the life of the body we are the children of god amen children of god and if children now listen this is beautiful now and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ well let me ask you the question we're heirs of god praise the lord we we like to hear that that's encouragement but what is as we can find scripturally the inheritance of jesus christ what is his inheritance well what happened on mount uh transfiguration god said this is my beloved son hear him right all power was given unto him in heaven and on earth that was his inheritance praise the lord amen hear him but now i want you to recognize the scripture says we are joint heirs with him you know if you take a prop possession of a property uh this basically countrywide if you take a a possession this country of property there is something called you can take joint tenancy and a joint tenancy of course now common property a man and a wife that's that's something that's inherent in the fact that you're married right but you can take uh in this country a property possession of a property and the title could be joint tenancy that means if you took possession of this property this building with one other individual and you paid for it 50 50. this property becomes both of yours equally 50 50. every bit of this property that's owned by your partner you own as well anything you want to do to this property you can do it anything that he does you can do it too you understand anything that your joint tenant does with this property you can do it too right right yes understand if you want to occupy this building if he wants to occupy you can occupy it's your building too you own this building just as much as he does i know i'm pushing the envelope a little bit friends but i want you to understand the bible says that we are joint heirs with christ what he his possession is our possession what's been allotted to him has been allotted to us right doesn't colossians say all the fullness of the godhead bodily uh dwelt in jesus christ and that you are complete in him right well if we're complete in him that means that everything that you need is done it's finished it's complete complete doesn't mean that you need to add some more down the road complete means it's finished it's complete it's it's fulfilled jesus said be there for perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect that is mature full age grown up or complete that's what he means that's what it means perfect is complete you are complete in him praise the lord well if we're joint heirs in his completeness of that godhead then where does that put our lives our word where does that put that puts you jesus one time told peter get thee behind me satan now i've told you many times that you know jesus wasn't calling peter satan right he was calling the spirit that was on peter at the time satan and putting that spirit in its place because that spirit was saying something that was contrary to the word right the spirit that was coming out of peter was saying something contrary to the word and when it's contrary to the word it's of the devil right and when jesus saw that recognize it he said get thee behind me satan well if jesus said get thee behind me satan what more would god listen to your word when you tell the devil the same thing right am i will he not yes would god not obey your word in that situation now we already understand we're in the position of being adopted we're in the position that god put us to have that faith to believe that who we are in him amy don't let your mistakes yesterday rob it from you don't let the faults and failures and mistakes you made this past week take that faith from you believe it because no matter if you made a hiccup last week you're still a son of god you're still a daughter of god you still own the rights to this promise of god's word it's still yours amen god said hear ye him amen he didn't tell he didn't just tell jesus that for fun he didn't just tell brother brown that amen that's for all of us that's for the bride internationally to obey your word to listen to you because you you are a joint heir with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together amen that sonship places you in that position amen that sonship but let me show you something because of the position of what happened in the garden of eden the fall in the garden of eden we ended up in a unique situation now god knew all things from the beginning we know that there was nothing that god did that god had attributes things he wanted to display that he wanted to manifest that he wanted to bring forward and we know that uh we read in in 1st john chapter 3 last week of the past two weeks actually that that jesus christ was manifested y'all remember what that scripture said why does why did first john say jesus was manifested or unveiled made known why was he made known that he might take away what sin son jesus was manifested that he might take away our sin amen so let me ask you in the garden of eden when god spoke and created a man and adam came forth and everything was perfect he was a true son of god adam was a true son of god spoken word being of god god took of himself put it in adam breathed into him the breath of life that was that was god that was his creation that was something that he created he could come and have fellowship with which he enjoyed very much which he still enjoys with his sons and daughters very much amen so don't neglect that time he enjoys that very much he enjoyed that there very much now if there had not been sin if there had not been a fall would there have been a necessity of the of the bringing forth of of the son of jesus where there have been a necessity there's no sin living in perfection living in in a godly atmosphere everything is perfect no sin what the necessity would have precipitated to have jesus be brought forth begotten into this world amen he wouldn't have needed to come in our kinship i was just quiet because we understand what that means to us right amen but understand what would it mean to us if we had if there was never a fall if there was never sin if there was never sin to be taken away amen so let me ask you this and before i read this when sin is completely annihilated and done away with what is the necessity of that son i know it's awful quiet amen but if some if sin is god if he was manifested to take away our sin and there is no more sin what's the purpose of that existence of that sonship because remember sonship not just yours not just mine but the only begotten son ship actually began we'll have an end because he was manifested for that purpose right amen now we know that's just an extension of god that flesh that that we identified as jesus was just human flesh god wrapped in that flesh we know that brother graham said that that flesh was the only part of god that could die right right he talks about the catholic church and other churches i guess that that reference jesus as being the eternal son which is contrary just in the just in the verbiage contrary in the fact that a son is something that is begotten and anything that's begotten had a beginning has an end cannot be eternal right now we're back into the eternities again and identifying who we are now we've done that as sons and daughters of god but who we really are in that seed that attribute that intel intellectual property that came from god that placed that seed in you that is who you really are then you begin to draw from that seed life you begin to draw from that holy spirit from that god from that god light that's where you begin to draw from you used to draw from when you were in the world nasty filthy uh uh wiggle worms and everything but when that crystal clear water came through you begin to draw from a different source you begin to draw like we talked about the soul the soul that sins that soul shall die but he who is born of god cannot commit sin you're drawing from a different fountain yes you're drawing from a seed life that makes you a new creature that identifies to you who you really are amen who you really are in this life as a son of god just like adam as a son of god we've been in the position even in the fallen state that we have we've been in a position that we that we fellowship with god that that we reject everything in the world everything of satan we reject all of the ideals and and all things and we accept christ as our savior as our lord as our god we receive it and believe in the position that we are as sons and daughters of god we accept what god has made us and what god wants us to see in his word we accept that we believe that although it's challenging sometimes with all the things that goes on in our lives and our sticky flesh it it's challenging sometimes but we believe that we know who we are we know where we stand so that's the position and we have that fellowship that eternal shall i say eternal fellowship with god now we had that fellowship god wanted that fellowship and we still have the opportunity the ability the blood of jesus christ has has built that bridge back across the chasm again that brought man and god back into fellowship that precious blood bridge that gap so that god and man could come back together heaven and earth can embrace again we can have that relationship again that's that's where god wants it to be that's who we are amen but when we go beyond this mortal reach there is no more sin where do we stand then amen the son of god was created was begotten to take away sin well when sin is completely annihilated let's look at this and christ revealed in his own word he's talking about the bible the bible he said it's not a book of systems a code of moral ethics neither is it a history book or a book of theology altogether it is not it is the revelation of jesus christ god himself revealed from word to flesh that's what he is revealed from word to flesh amen that logos that came out went into that body that was begotten from a woman sinless spoken word came forth sinless to take away our sin yes remember he could not take away our sin if he was a sinner himself right right and if he was born of a of an act that was the original sin he would have been born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lives just like the rest of us but because he did not and from the womb of a virgin came forth as a spoken word being god bailed in that flesh that begate that made him the begotten son praise the lord the word that came into flesh she birthed forth the word that was in flesh we'll just say it that way what is it the bible is the word of god is flesh god uh jesus being the flesh it's a revelation how god the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and that's why he becomes a son of god he is a part of god amen and in that sonship as being a coming forth as a part of god and that sonship is what causes us to be joint heirs with him right now we came forth in sin he did not but we're joint heirs because we came forth as kin folk he's a kinsmen redeemer to us and that's what made us kinfolk and and as being kinfocus being a part of god in this human flesh is the son of god it makes that co-equal possible amen in our lives that co-equal right praise the lord now when jesus spoke something you think he believed it amen he believed it because why he said i'd do nothing unless the father showed me first right amen there's that leading right that's the leading the holy spirit system of this is talking about be led of the spirit and that's what it boils down to our whole lives of the spirit of god that's what it that's what it all amounts to really that's what we want is to be led of the holy spirit so that leading is what led him to calvary that leading is what leads us to do what do what to do what we do for the lord brother adam said she'll she'll have thus saith the lord and she'll be quiet what does that mean that just means she'll have the leading of the spirit in her life to do as god would have through us or she won't do it at all amen so that word is what that that life that word that came life is what leads us what brings us through that same position amen as a part of god but now look look at this now but now it's still the same quote the body is a part of god so much that it is a son now look how he's dividing this the body is that is a part of god is in in as much that it is a son it's like i've said the past couple weeks my son is an extension of my body as much as he is a son my son amen that's just a natural application to spiritual revelation see he's just that son the part that body is part of god embodies part of me as much as he's the son see in that relationship he said as a catholic puts it eternal son all the rest of churches the word don't even make sense there cannot be eternal and then be a son because a son is something that he's begotten from now you've already laid the foundation i tried to lay the foundation this before reading this but this is this is where i come from amen that a son there cannot be eternal and then be a son because a son is something that's begotten from the word eternal he cannot be a son but he uh he can be a son but he cannot be an eternal son no sir he cannot be an eternal son and people will come with this and say now wait a minute are you saying that jesus christ is not eternal the sonship notice again the division he's god so much as he is in that flesh as he is a son amen but when you separate that out recognize that that that son that that attribute that was in jesus christ is just an attribute of god to be a son yes that's all it is it's his attribute that he had in the great elohim that was that was an attribute to be a son that's all it did he just took that uh intelli intellectual property and put it in his own son amen but the sonship part is not eternal that's right it is not eternal that's right again when he was manifested in other words brought forth he was he was brought from undercover that that sun attribute was manifest was was brought in full display a manifest we talked about a manifest before manifest is just something that tells you what's inside if you have a package sometimes you have a packing slip or a manifest a manifest package same thing it just tells you what's inside the box before you open it amen that's just a manifest so a manifest is just telling you he was manifested that we might see him touch him handle him because he was the son in that flesh so much of god as it was in that flesh but when but when that manifestation was to take away sin well when he stood when he hung on calvary and said it is finished friend he meant it yes it is finished what's finished everything everything you can go chronologically you can go alphabetically you can go numerically you can go whatever way you want to but everything that god almighty had intended to to do to fulfill through the son jesus was done finished every bit of it up through to the introduction again or the the entering back into that place of eternity amen we went through this time came out it went through eternity remember eternity's just just a circle there's no beginning and ending to it just you know i used to get this off easy it won't come off they miss some days it does some days it doesn't but it's just like that ring you get on the edge of that ring and you could run around and round and round around until you just starve yourself to death and die because there's no end to it no beginning to it no end to it amen which signifies my commitment to that woman right over there amen amen from eternity to eternity that's my commitment to her amen right till death do we part no no no only in the flesh right only in the flesh do we part but that eternal is there it stays it's but then there's this little blip that came off i could draw it but i don't want to mess up what i did yesterday they came off into this time element this time elements about to blend back into eternity again when that time element blends back up into that place of eternity there is no more sin sin is annihilated sin is done away with it is finished done that is that sin is annihilated when it's done and there is no more sin then the sonship cease to exist amen it's no it's not eternal it'll continue on as long as the necessity of it is there and for us as sons of god but it won't be eternal part of god that same that same attribute of god to be son will still be there amen but the sonship of jesus christ the name of christ jesus christ that was put on it won't will cease to exist amen no sir cannot be an eternal son now that he is in the sun is so much as the word was in jeremiah it was in moses all these words all these uh prophets they speak of me all the true divine revelation of the word was wound up into one human body and god put flesh around it amen all the fullness of the godhead bodily in him all that all that god was he poured into christ all into that flesh amen but again the part i like we all know that amen we give christ his praise and his accolade but the part i like is that you amen are complete in him who has the fullness of the godhead bodily amen we might have an earnest of that but oh friend what is our real inheritance our real inheritance isn't just that earnest right amen we're headed to something that's greater and that's direct that that's the acknowledgement that that's the place that that that i want us to get to i guess through this not not negating our sonship here not negating what god has done for us and in this life in our humanity but understanding friends that that there's more in there to who we really are then sometimes maybe is acknowledged that we really are not just this flesh but who we really are amen down on the inside the inside there all the divine true revelation the word wound up in one human body god put flesh around that's the reason he called it a son reason he refers to father amen why jesus brother says just as simple just as plain as anything like the nose on our face yes amen just that plain and simple now i want to go to ephesians chapter one chapter one i know i'm running short on time and there's no way i'm going to get through this but i want to lay out what i felt the lord gave me yesterday when i was reading i've read brother wilson i've read this scripture i'd probably you see that on my bible that is a huge grease spot that's how many times i've gone into scripture you see that that huge grease spot right there is my human uh oil off of my body that's how many times i've gone to this scripture but yesterday i was reading and something became more plain to me i want to share it with you at least part of it today anyway ephesians 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus now it has to be that way amen it has to be an apostle has to be a calling of jesus christ has to be of jesus christ it has to be by the will of god amen not just because somebody has the gift of gab or something that they can get up in front of people and talk no that's not a minister it's got to be of christ by the will of god it's the only acknowledgement that that's recognized in heaven people churches might be full of them people all over but the acknowledgement in heaven by god has to be by the will of god yes amen praise the lord to the saints richard episode faithful in christ jesus grace be to you peace from god our father lord jesus christ blessed be god blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ thank god for that now the the next verse and i just wrote this so that it maybe a visual could make it a little more plain we had elohim the self-existing god he wasn't god we know that god's an object of worship he was god as we know god is the almighty but he's elohim the self-existing god but in the fourth verse it says according to according as he had chosen us he meant when did he choose us before the foundation of the world that's what it is chose us where in him so he issued forth his choosing we issued forth from the elohim because we were in him that's what the bible says we were chosen amen issued forth from elohim chosen by him hand-picked praise the lord i like that part i like that part i i talk about sometimes like a woman or or a man going to a grocery store and need to get some tomatoes or something especially tomatoes oranges and apricots and or uh avocados but tomatoes you know tomatoes can go and bananas even but tomatoes a lot of times they have those things piled up in a thing there and you go and you look at them and you think wow that's a good looking bunch of tomatoes and you go and you really look at them you're like oh there's bruises on that one and this one and this one's squishy on this side and they don't look quite as good once you get it close up look but when you go there you have something that you want in mind to do with that tomato tomato sandwich from the south uh i love them my mom loved them my mom had to quit eating them because she only had one hand and she'd take a bite and the whole thing would fall out she could when she got older she loved tomato sandwiches i do too don't hardly have one but i like them tacos for you southeastern or southwesterners tacos tomatoes on tacos whatever it is there's a reason you want that and you want the perfect tomato you want it to fit on that burger just right right or in that sandwich perfectly you know uh tacos not so much sorry but you just dice them up but you want it to serve a particular purpose amen so if you go into that bin of tomatoes and you look at this and there may be a hundred 200 tomatoes there but there's two or three of them that's going to go home with you right and they're going to be the two or three depending on your time element which you might just say one two three especially the guys but there's three tomatoes that's going to suit your purpose the best and you go and you look and you might and i see women i i don't mean this sexist but it's usually women you go and you look at the women and they're staying and they'll stand there for 10 and 15 minutes trying to find three tomatoes that's true how long does it take to get a tomato sounds like brother wilson's witness has been a partner in that as i have but i like to write tomato too so i can't say much but you're going there's there's going to be three tomatoes that's going to go home with you but you're going to purposely specifically go and pick and man i've seen them they'll go over here and they'll look over here they'll go around here and they'll elbow you out of the way because this over here is the perfect tomato that they want and you might look at it and say oh i'm glad she took that one because you don't want it right but it was hand-picked by her right or you picked the one this was mine and you'll they'll go all over and they'll look all around and they'll look and tomatoes but eventually they're gonna have those two or three whatever tomatoes and they're going to take those home with them because those were the ones that they chose they handpicked it was their choosing this tomato is going to serve the purpose that i need for it to serve in my home praise the lord and god chose chose you saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world he chose you and said this one is going to do exactly what i want him to do down there yeah amen and he chose you he hand picked you the family the flesh that you come into that was just this time house that we're in but god chose you the real you down in there and placed his own spirit his own seed in there amen then his spirit come and brought it to life because he knew that you are going to be the one through his poor knowledge amen i don't have the foreknowledge to know how my burger is going to turn out but he had the foreknowledge to know exactly what it was going to be how it was going to turn out and who he needed to do it and people say i don't know what my place is i don't know what i'm supposed to do i don't know god must not have it god's got something that only you not only for you to do but he's got something that only you can do you're the one that he wants to do it he picked you he chose you he hand chose you for that purpose amen predestinated in him before the foundation of the world what's that predestination that's the mind to know i know by foreign knowledge who it is but the predestinated says i'm gonna take it to my kitchen i'm gonna get this knife and i'm gonna cut it just so thick and i'm gonna put it this way and i'm gonna lay it on a plate or i'm gonna put it on that burger and he knows exactly that's the predestination this is the purpose it's going to serve amen and he chose you for that reason praise the lord when he chose you though he chose you in him before the foundation of the world before this ball of this big rock was ever hung in space he saw you that's eternity you didn't begin there no more than god began there we say that so many times just because of our human vernacular but you didn't begin there he didn't begin there you just always were there right you didn't know it but you were always there just like he's always there yes amen before the foundation of the world fourth verse still that we should be holy amen holy and without blame before him amen now that before him means that there's an issue coming forth we're coming to this world amen that we're supposed to be holy where not there here before him here holy and without blame before him who did that christ because he was manifested to take away our sin when there's no sin it's holiness praise the lord there's no there's no religion there's no legalism right it's just in him praise the lord that's why god told you he knew you would do it he knew you'd be the right person praise the lord somebody witnessed to you one day more than likely yeah somebody spoke to you maybe even about christ about the message somebody spoke to you somebody witnesses a reason you're here today right maybe that was the only person that could have spoke to you that would have caused you to come and go through your life to where you are here this morning may have been that one person amen amen i know what might when uh the things were going on in our family uh you know sometimes there's nothing you can say that's gonna make a difference amen right brother wilson your boys something that sometimes it just is just absolutely nothing you can say to them it's going to make any difference at all my prayer became lord you know who it is that needs to go and speak to them do it for me please send the right person right at the right time to them amen because we always especially parents you know always feel like we we we're in control we've got to be the ones that do it and we're the ones to lay down the law blah blah blah but you know god has already predestinated somebody right to come and speak to that person to come and talk to them and to help them get back and get into the place where they're supposed to be amen now obviously from that comes the spirit of god speaking to them which is more prevalent but it had there had to be that that beginning place there had to be that star before it could get to the place to where that spirit began to talk to it there had to be that willingness amen your son sister teresa brother charlie's starting to read the bible again there's that place that they got to come to right to bring them along amen right well that predestination sets that in place it puts that in position so that we we fulfill the purpose god called us to we're holy here now before him without blame before him having predestinated us and i'm afraid i have to stop here predestination he predestinated us amen unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so he not only chose us but then he predestinated us well there would be no predestination if there was not a choosing so the choosing issues fourth for of the predestination choose issues for from the choosing just like the choosing issued forth from the elohim from god we were chosen in him and then predestinated so he chose us and then he predestinated us yes to the adoption to our placement to our position amen that's his predestination that he put for us to that adoption by jesus christ by the sonship jesus christ but he did it unto himself yes praise the lord that's why we're predestinated all of it every bit of everything that we go and do it all goes right back to that same one god it all goes back to that same place amen amen like i said everything a few weeks ago everything before christ pointed to calvary everything behind it is pointed back to it because that's the point that's the pinnacle that's the place amen as a believer as a as a child of god that's that's where it all lies amen they back here they didn't know it maybe they were looking to that we as believers look back at that yes and we see but he's not there anymore he's here praise the lord but without that where would any of us be amen i hate that you know it it's hard that my savior my lord my god had to go through that i tell i told you before i've seen the passion one time uh for all the way through brother brother wilson i saw it with brother jewell thorning we came preached for us up in the mountains we went to a theater and watched her when he came out me and joy set next and that's the only time every time he was scourged i jumped in my seat i bought the video i was intended i was going to watch it have it hadn't been able to watch it since i've started it two or three times and it gets to that certain point and i just can't watch it anymore it just it just just something about it i just have been unable to get past that but i thank god that he did it though i'm so thankful he went through it and he did it for me yes but i can't watch it but i'm so glad he did it amen yes because it was in him that i was predestinated by uh that children by jesus christ now notice we're not children to jesus christ children by jesus christ that's why we're heirs in joint heirs where the children of god were the bride of christ amen so it doesn't say that we're children to christ with children by christ by that blood but what he did there made us sons and daughters of god yes praise the lord through the annihilation of sin yes according to my good pleasure to what i want to do how i want to live my life to where i want to go to my worst no no no not my will your will to his will and that's where a lot of people get confused they think that they've been set free and liberated like we talked about wednesday night set free and liberate to do what we want to do just live however we want be whatever no no he didn't come to liberate us for that purpose he came and liberated us to serve him praise the lord amen amen to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved and now i guess we'll just have to but as you can see my little drawing i have paul laid it out here no wonder brother talked about the ephesian church being the most mature church just in the first chapter and how he lays this out from the great elohim of god to choosing of us before the foundation of the world into the predestination give us a revelation who we are to the end of time and our inheritance right back to him again amen all goes right back to him again praise the lord and that's and that's fine with me because that's where i want to be anyway all right praise the lord let's stand if we could that's exactly where i want to be anyway so thank god for that am i amen i thank god that he showed us that he's made us who we're supposed to be in him we're playing out the part that god called for us from before the foundation of the world amen thank god for it amen let's sing this course 665. we'll just sing the chorus part 665 child of the king praise the lord glad you're a child of the king today amen thank you jesus oh yes oh yes [Music] praise god praise [Music] oh yes and his royal blood now flows [Music] [Music] now [Music] praise god [Music] amen thank you jesus aren't you glad to be that child of the king today amen praise the lord it's got to be a revelation saints amen it's got to be a revelation it's not a revelation then it's not something that anchors our soul amen it's not something that becomes a part of who we are if it's not a revelation amen it's got to be a part of who you are amen let's see this course 270. amen i love singing this course i always loved singing it then when i become my grandson one of his favorites i like to sing it even more 270 god's not dead amen is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] feet [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus praise god amen he's not dead saints like the world wants to make you believe he is alive today as he has ever been i've heard people say more alive i don't know how he can be more alive he might be more alive than you amen but he's not more alive he just always is praise the lord you might be more alive than me amen that's the difference praise the lord praise god some people say god said it i believe it and that settles us no no no when he said it that sounds something whether you believe it or not right yeah when he said it right now it might be real to you when you believe it that settles it for you amen that's when it becomes real to you right praise the lord amen god bless you amen you love him today praise the lord love with all my heart so good to be in the house the lord again pray something was said to bless strengthen you god is so good to us amen where would we be without him saying i think about that from time to time and it just shudders me so much i forget all right stop trying to even think about it and just thank him for his grace amen praise the lord so wonderful amen so appreciate each one of you coming if you're streaming god richly bless you today thank the lord for his mercy now i wanted to mention to you that there will be we will have service here

like it used to be wow i yeah i'm not sure everybody's gonna fit or if everybody's even gonna come uh imagine kovit might keep some people away the fact that it's that the tabernacle will probably keep some people away that's sad but true sorry i i don't you know and there's so little parking i don't know how to have a problem for three or four hundred people uh anyway i want you to announce it to let you know so i now will be announcing it goes along even though they'll probably have a tape uh we'll cancel that just just to be christian for the wednesday night to go i'm not saying that i would be able to go or that i will go but for those who would like to go and just to be a brother to dismiss our service in lieu of that on wednesday the 12th we will not have january 12th we will not have service here but remember the harmony uh go if you can pray for me if you can't or pray for me the way and um just i'm not sure how the semantics are going to work out but they usually have a huge orchestra in that and i'm assuming i believe that wmo's still going to be involved in it yes that's what i thought so anyway so the 12th through the wednesday the 12th through the following sundays harmony is tucson tabernacle as it gets closer i'll tell you the times i don't you can look at all my lines if you want to but um there's different times there'll be a minister's meeting uh that friday the 14th uh that i plan to attend so and brother roger we're going to cancel work for that day to attend the ministers meeting and it's going to be a caleb's church kind of uh i kind of prefer that a neutral site not that it's a caleb's i if it was at the tabernacle or here i would rather it be at a neutral site i think that just kind of lends a little better when it's at a neutral site but it it's okay anyway but it's supposed to be the minister's meeting is supposed to be the 14th so i know that doesn't involve really much of any of you um but if you uh would pray for us that's the main thing pray for us i still plan to go we me and brother rogers been to the first two or three of phoenix and and it's been good so uh we'll try the lord willing we plan to be at that so amen thankful the lord blessed us amen i take you all out to lunch brother green we don't have furs anymore hardly any of you liked it but uh we went but we don't have furs and uh i shouldn't say i don't have them i probably have the money to pay for everybody not a long one but uh but anyway we love you all appreciate you very much amen we'll be dismissed i want to add that brother brother green shared a testimony that brother brown gave him and that was that brother brown said that these people there he saw that people would be leaving tucson tabernacle for whatever their reasons were and everybody has different reasons he said brother green he said they're going to all come back they're all coming back one day and that may be exactly what it was even though brother's not here anymore which precipitates my i'm sorry to leave you standing but i felt compelled to say this um i mentioned wednesday night um about being in bondage of having uh worshipping the the image of a god a church a pastor or a memory of a pastor and some of you may have saw my you know consternation i guess after that i was but honestly and i'll say this before god i said it before i knew i'd said it and i absolutely had nobody or no church or no pastor in my mind when that came out of my mouth so i hope i didn't offend anybody um that was not my intention but i'm not going to apologize because like i said it was out of my mouth before i knew it was sick and again before god and i told my family afterwards i said i had nobody in my mind there was nobody no church no pastor no pastor that's gone on for the green or otherwise that was in my mind when that came out not at all so i i hope that didn't offend anybody so and had no direct purpose to anyone or anything like that so anyway i just wanted to make sure i cleared the air that's why i'm not apologizing because i'm not going to apologize if i felt the lord said and it doesn't negate the fact that what what was said is true what it said was still true so i don't want to take that back either but i wanted to make sure i didn't hurt anybody or offend anybody and let you know that i had no i had no body in mind or anything so anyway so just so you know that's before god that's the honest truth remember that for your family at last um brother brown yes please do thank you that should have been a prayer request brother ralphia's mother died this week passed away so sister lydia's not here today because her family was exposed to coba and they're doing the quarantine thing uh so that she did she's not not here because of that uh but brother ralph via's mother did pass away this week so i put that out as a as a email as a text to the church but i didn't know did everybody get that okay um her mother did pass away uh or his mother passed away this week so thank you for reminding me that please remember the southern family again too jason's funeral was yesterday you know brother dan souther did you know him i worked with him how did he pass away really i didn't know yeah yeah that's the official yeah 45 years old he was a police officer for 17 years yeah uh he was a good well you would tpp yeah working with him okay uh well his dan forget his wife's name their son funeral was yesterday um and uh and he said anybody wants to view it's on youtube if you just search on youtube for jason southern south a-r-d s-o-u-t-h-a-r-d um it'll come up so they did that and they did a they did something to park a lot of celebration or something as a as a police officer too with the color guard and things so it probably was probably with something else i always get chills when i go to those like military ones than that but anyway continue to remember um the uh the greeny family in prayer too amen uh with brothers uh brother dave green's passing that was thursday his funeral funeral uh graveside was thursday so please remember that family and all the families and this intertwined so many people and so many families that were intertwined with them so remember them in prayer too did you have something yes um that a wave of tornadoes that had six states there's got to be some believers in that crowd and the bible teaches us to pray especially for the household of faith and mayfield kentucky was totally devastated i saw it on the news i couldn't help but just go to the lord and pray and um you know we don't experience it but it it's devastating and we need to pray for those people or pray the souls will get saved through that sure amen and in an area that they don't typically expected or prepared for that too but you know kansas nebraska that's a little different but tennessee and coming through arkansas it's just not something that they normally deal with so i've heard up to 100 people died i get so focused on uh on this a lot of those things leave me so i appreciate y'all mentioning that for me anything else god bless you amen again thank you for coming appreciate each one of you brother wilson honor again to happy brother would you please dismiss lord jesus i want to thank you for your many blessings yes i want to thank you for your love and mercy and please yes thank you the word of god this morning because truly our hearts were stirred yes we as jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered yes we're constantly continually being made more subject to you and more yielded to you so please lord have your will and what you just saw keep us in your protection in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you hard to believe but next sunday is the last sunday before christmas amen god bless [Music] yes [Music]
