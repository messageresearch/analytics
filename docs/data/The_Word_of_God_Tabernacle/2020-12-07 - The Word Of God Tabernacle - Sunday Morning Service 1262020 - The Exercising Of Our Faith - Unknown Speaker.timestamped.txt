[48:44] and looking forward to a further touch

[48:50] to our feet
[48:52] amen we'll go to the word of god now
[48:55] open your bibles to hebrews chapter 11.
[49:04] first uh
[49:07] first new testament scripture we start
[49:09] out with in a
[49:11] couple months or so i guess but
[49:17] and then we'll just read a couple of
[49:18] verses of scripture
[49:23] okay hebrews chapter 11 we'll begin with
[49:25] verse one
[49:26] amen felt my heart is just something
[49:29] actually for the past couple of weeks
[49:31] that the
[49:32] lord wanted to speak on faith so i just
[49:35] uh
[49:36] trust to be a blessing amen before we
[49:38] read the word let's just bow our heads
[49:40] for another word of prayer
[49:42] precious jesus again lord we come to you
[49:44] thanking you so much for all that you've
[49:45] done for us and
[49:47] lord given to us in this beautiful day
[49:49] and lord your word father we open the
[49:51] pages of our bibles lord and god
[49:54] trusting that you're going to speak to
[49:55] us from it now
[49:57] god we know that you would anoint the
[49:58] speaker the hearer like god that
[50:00] whatever you would have purposed
[50:02] and intended lord for this service today
[50:04] god and for your people for those who
[50:05] are here for those who may be watching
[50:08] lord that it would be accomplished in us
[50:10] god as you send it forth for we know
[50:12] it'll not return
[50:13] void god but we're trusting you god that
[50:15] it would do what you said and
[50:17] believe by faith god that that's exactly
[50:19] what you show to us and help us for this
[50:21] last day
[50:22] lord we're getting to a place as you
[50:25] know god as
[50:26] we know here lord of that statue of a
[50:29] perfect man the foundation is
[50:31] faith we're getting to a place lord that
[50:33] that faith has
[50:34] become more and more real to us it has
[50:37] to become
[50:38] more and more of a revelation jesus lord
[50:41] in this last day because we're coming to
[50:43] a place of
[50:44] of a body change we're coming to a place
[50:46] of a unity of faith a faith
[50:48] that's going to need to reach a place
[50:50] lord a plateau
[50:52] that we've probably never reached in
[50:53] this mortal realm before god
[50:56] but lord i'm just believing father that
[50:59] you god as you speak to us your word
[51:01] that word comes into our hearts it comes
[51:03] into our spirit into our lives
[51:05] it becomes a part of us lord and god
[51:08] when we're walking around on our daily
[51:10] journey
[51:11] you just open it to us lord how many
[51:13] times god in our daily journey
[51:16] you can reflect to us and we look and
[51:18] see god how that word comes instrumental
[51:21] in our lives as we speak it to someone
[51:23] else or
[51:24] it becomes real to us in a traumatic
[51:27] situation or we try to help somebody or
[51:29] speak to somebody or
[51:31] witness in some way lord that word just
[51:33] becomes so real to us
[51:35] and that faith becomes so powerful to us
[51:37] lord
[51:38] it just helps us understand that that
[51:40] faith does come by hearing
[51:42] and hearing the word of god whether we
[51:43] realize it right now or not
[51:45] we know god that that's exactly i
[51:47] believe exactly what you're doing for us
[51:50] this bride in this last day
[51:51] through the revealed word of the hours
[51:53] bringing her to that place
[51:55] bringing her to that time lord that that
[51:58] word
[51:58] lord that has been spoken that word by
[52:00] faith that comes into us
[52:02] that word is what brings about that
[52:04] faith to bring what is needed for this
[52:06] last day
[52:07] yes we thank you god when all tongues
[52:10] have ceased when all gifts are over when
[52:12] everything is all said and done
[52:14] your word stands true yes your word is
[52:17] real your word
[52:18] will not pass away we thank you god for
[52:21] it we pray lord that you would
[52:22] reveal it even now and help encourage us
[52:25] lord
[52:26] by what you would speak to us today lord
[52:28] you just help your
[52:30] unworthy servant here lord each one of
[52:32] us god we're
[52:33] we're so in ourselves unworthy but
[52:35] trusting you in all things
[52:37] we can do all things through christ
[52:39] which strengthens us today
[52:41] bless it lord now bless this service we
[52:44] commit it to you and ask your uh
[52:46] blessings on it again in the name of the
[52:47] lord jesus christ we pray
[52:49] amen amen amen amen hebrews 11 we'll
[52:52] just read the first couple of verses
[52:54] now faith is the substance of things
[52:56] hoped for
[52:57] the evidence of things not seen
[53:00] for by it the elders obtained a good
[53:02] report through faith we understand the
[53:05] worlds were framed by the word of god
[53:08] so that things which are seen were not
[53:10] made by things which do appear
[53:12] you could be seated if you'd like
[53:15] we've read that scripture many times
[53:17] we've expounded on it many times you've
[53:19] read it you've heard it
[53:20] you've probably heard many other
[53:21] ministers people expound on it and
[53:23] preach on it
[53:24] but it's really one of the best places
[53:26] if you want to talk about faith
[53:28] to begin so faith and and this
[53:31] first three verses is sometimes a little
[53:33] complicated or a little
[53:35] challenging to understand when you get
[53:37] into the double negatives and you get
[53:39] into the
[53:40] uh the uh all the adjectives that's
[53:43] added into it
[53:44] uh it can it can get to the places uh
[53:47] for example through faith we understand
[53:49] the world's refrained by the word of god
[53:51] that the things which are
[53:52] which are seen were not were not made by
[53:55] things which do appear that's not
[53:56] normally
[53:57] how we talk in our english language uh
[54:00] so it it takes one thing and goes around
[54:03] and brings it back to
[54:04] to the negative to show that it's a
[54:06] positive uh
[54:07] which is kind of unusual but you know if
[54:10] you go
[54:11] take the negative battery off your cable
[54:13] your car won't start so
[54:15] there's there's that negative that
[54:16] brings the charge to the positive so
[54:19] yeah but anyway is the challenge of that
[54:22] but
[54:22] i just want to talk about today the
[54:24] exercising of our faith
[54:26] if you will the exercising of our faith
[54:29] faith isn't common
[54:30] uh faith isn't just something like i was
[54:33] talking about in the
[54:34] memorial service yesterday about love
[54:36] love is not just something that's a word
[54:38] love is not just something that you tell
[54:39] somebody
[54:40] love is just not something that's
[54:42] written down a piece of paper sung in a
[54:43] song
[54:44] love is something that's expressed if
[54:45] it's real love if it's true love
[54:48] if it's the love of god it's something
[54:49] that's expressed it's something that's
[54:51] given out
[54:52] is something that's shown it's an action
[54:54] and we know that the loves that god has
[54:56] in the bible
[54:57] the agapo and agape one is a noun and
[54:59] one is a verb
[55:00] well the agapeo love is something that's
[55:02] a verb it's an action
[55:04] it's something you do it's something you
[55:05] perform it's something that you show
[55:07] somebody not just by words faith is the
[55:09] same way
[55:10] faith isn't something that you just say
[55:13] faith isn't something that you say well
[55:14] i got faith or
[55:15] it's not something you just sing about
[55:17] and and all those things are fine and
[55:20] and pronouncing your faith is good but
[55:22] there's got to be something behind your
[55:23] faith to show that the faith is really
[55:25] there
[55:26] amen if there's not something to follow
[55:28] the faith to prove that the faith is
[55:29] real then you can say it all day long
[55:32] but the manifestation of your faith is
[55:34] not evident in people's lives
[55:36] in our lives for for everyone and anyone
[55:39] to see
[55:39] it's got to be something that's an
[55:41] action there's got to be something that
[55:42] you do
[55:43] and it's not something that you just
[55:44] like i said earlier in the service and
[55:46] you just sit down and say okay
[55:48] god hit me you know hit me with a good
[55:50] dose of faith don't
[55:51] it you know that's good to have the
[55:53] faith because every man's dealt demands
[55:55] your faith but you got to get up off the
[55:57] couch and do something about it
[55:58] you got to put action to your faith you
[56:00] got to put
[56:02] emotion you got to put something behind
[56:04] your faith so that your faith
[56:05] works right uh there's many stories that
[56:08] you read through the message
[56:10] that that people didn't understand faith
[56:13] and i think a lot of times people
[56:14] even probably myself don't completely
[56:16] understand
[56:18] faith but it comes a time where
[56:21] the faith that you claim to have needs
[56:23] to be exercised
[56:25] it needs to be put forth there needs to
[56:27] be muscle behind it there needs to be
[56:29] evidence behind it you know the bible
[56:31] says we'll probably read this in a few
[56:33] minutes but
[56:34] uh faith without works is dead right
[56:36] jesus said you've got faith all along
[56:38] but i say well
[56:39] uh you know i got faith by my works well
[56:41] you know my works prove my faith well
[56:43] which is it gonna be
[56:44] well it's one and the same it's
[56:46] synonymous you've got faith and the
[56:47] faith is gonna follow you
[56:49] jesus said the works that i do shall you
[56:51] do amen well look through the bible we
[56:53] all know the works that jesus did
[56:55] right well if jesus said all the works
[56:57] that he did the works that we'll do
[56:59] well then what does that put us very
[57:01] much see not but
[57:02] but again we've got to understand and
[57:04] not let our faith get weak by the thing
[57:06] to sink well
[57:07] something's powerfully supernatural has
[57:09] to happen
[57:10] every minute of my life where i'm not a
[57:12] christian you know i've known people
[57:13] like that
[57:15] i i knew a brother back in north
[57:16] carolina has passed away now
[57:18] but he actually proclaimed to me my our
[57:21] pastor he said
[57:22] you know if i get into service and i
[57:23] don't speak in tongues i don't feel like
[57:25] i'm saved
[57:27] when we're trying to say brother are you
[57:30] really that's
[57:31] that that's the least of the gifts even
[57:33] according to the bible according to paul
[57:35] that even is even the least of the gifts
[57:37] but yeah he was so
[57:38] in that and of course you know the
[57:40] pentecostal thought of it and then
[57:42] and that and then he's like well you
[57:44] know i if i don't speak in tongues i
[57:46] don't feel like i've been to church or i
[57:47] don't feel like i'm saved
[57:49] it's not something that you look and say
[57:51] well there's got to be a supernatural
[57:53] happening every minute of your life
[57:55] right because most of our lives just
[57:56] like abraham
[57:58] if you compile you think of how
[58:00] supernatural abraham's life looks
[58:02] most people do look at abraham and think
[58:04] by faith and abraham
[58:06] live the supernatural life god told him
[58:08] here god told him here god told him here
[58:10] but a lot of what abraham did most of
[58:13] what abraham did
[58:14] 95 plus percent of what abraham did was
[58:17] by faith
[58:18] right it wasn't by something that god
[58:20] said okay take a step over here
[58:22] okay now take a step over here and thus
[58:24] said the lord you got to take a step
[58:25] over here
[58:26] no it wasn't that it was by faith right
[58:29] he walked by faith god said
[58:31] okay leave your father leave your home
[58:32] and i'm gonna show you a land
[58:34] that's it let's go okay now it's your
[58:37] turn to go do it
[58:38] right and it's your turn to put feet
[58:41] feet print upon
[58:42] the faith and go do what god told you to
[58:44] do
[58:45] and it's time to leave your father now
[58:46] it's time to now god didn't say okay all
[58:50] this along the way
[58:51] you know it's been told i don't know how
[58:53] accurate it is because i haven't done it
[58:55] myself
[58:56] but it's been told that they that people
[58:59] have compiled
[59:01] the total amount of time scripturally
[59:04] documented that god spoke lift to ear to
[59:07] abraham
[59:09] guess how much time well guess probably
[59:11] not the thing to do in church
[59:13] but i'm going to tell you that that
[59:16] is that they say was compiled that god
[59:18] actually spoke to abraham
[59:20] comes to about 12 minutes
[59:23] 12 minutes i've been standing here
[59:26] talking to you for more than 12 minutes
[59:30] i mean just since opening the bible for
[59:32] 12 minutes right
[59:33] 12 minutes they say now again i don't
[59:35] know how accurate that is
[59:36] but people have taken and and i guess
[59:38] they timed the things that god talked to
[59:40] abraham 12 minutes
[59:42] you imagine 12 minutes in your life you
[59:43] think some people want god to talk to
[59:45] him every second of every day
[59:47] that's right some people think brother
[59:48] branham knew everything to do about
[59:50] every situation
[59:51] every time and every coming event well
[59:54] your deity at that point
[59:56] brother man wasn't dead he was a man he
[59:59] was subject to the things that god
[1:00:00] showed him and helped him with
[1:00:02] i don't know if anybody's ever compiled
[1:00:04] through documentation how i mean how
[1:00:06] much time that adds up to but 12 minutes
[1:00:08] to abraham
[1:00:09] and most people think well god told
[1:00:11] abraham everything no he didn't abraham
[1:00:14] just put shoe leather behind his
[1:00:16] behind his face amen god just abraham
[1:00:19] just moved out when god told him to do
[1:00:21] something
[1:00:21] he exercised it you do what god said do
[1:00:24] and you move on
[1:00:25] now what if you don't get a direct say
[1:00:28] say
[1:00:28] something from god to say okay leave
[1:00:30] your father mother go into a land which
[1:00:32] i show you
[1:00:33] and and and then go do that what if god
[1:00:35] doesn't do that
[1:00:37] then then what do we have left we have
[1:00:39] his word
[1:00:41] right we have his word to walk by we
[1:00:43] have his word to live by
[1:00:45] we have his word that gives us the
[1:00:46] beautiful precious promises
[1:00:48] that we have today so when god says by
[1:00:51] my stripes you're healed can you not
[1:00:52] walk in that
[1:00:53] right step into that and believe yes
[1:00:56] how many times as brother branham said
[1:00:58] on tape
[1:01:00] i know you've all heard it but how many
[1:01:02] times he said now
[1:01:03] get up off that cot right now get up out
[1:01:06] of that wheelchair
[1:01:07] stand to your feet do something about it
[1:01:10] the prayer of faith has gone forth you
[1:01:12] say you got faith
[1:01:13] now stand on your feet and prove it show
[1:01:16] to everybody don't just lay there and
[1:01:18] rot
[1:01:19] get up on your feet and move do
[1:01:21] something right
[1:01:22] let let god let the world let yourself
[1:01:25] know
[1:01:26] that you really truly believe what you
[1:01:28] say you're
[1:01:29] you believe amen that you really have
[1:01:31] the faith that you say that you believe
[1:01:34] this is uh one of them i'll read to you
[1:01:39] uh brother and it's uh in the prophet
[1:01:42] visit south africa
[1:01:44] and he says i recall during the message
[1:01:46] as i was sitting on the platform
[1:01:47] watching the people and their reaction
[1:01:49] to the message of faith being brought to
[1:01:51] them
[1:01:52] i noticed one lady was sitting about 30
[1:01:54] 40 feet in front of
[1:01:55] the platform she was looking at her
[1:01:57] hands
[1:01:59] you could see the large knuckles now
[1:02:02] think about this
[1:02:03] especially if you've had any issue with
[1:02:05] arthritis
[1:02:07] he said you could see uh by her
[1:02:11] large knuckles and the apparent
[1:02:13] stiffness of the fingers that she was
[1:02:15] suffering from arthritis
[1:02:18] she was unable to move her fingers
[1:02:21] but as she had heard the word of god
[1:02:23] expounded
[1:02:24] her faith had grown and she looked down
[1:02:28] at those crippled fingers and she tried
[1:02:31] to move them
[1:02:32] hmm amen have you ever been in prayer to
[1:02:36] the lord and you ask god to touch in a
[1:02:38] certain way or you have an ailment back
[1:02:39] shoulder arm
[1:02:40] whatever and you say and you're you're
[1:02:43] in
[1:02:43] in prayer you get up from prayer and and
[1:02:46] you say
[1:02:47] praise the lord amen
[1:02:50] and you do something you stand up praise
[1:02:52] the lord i'm healed
[1:02:54] right yeah and you and you act upon it
[1:02:56] praise god it's not hurting me
[1:02:59] praise god it's not sore anymore praise
[1:03:01] the lord i'm healed
[1:03:02] amen amen stand on it she's brother
[1:03:04] graham said she tried to move those
[1:03:06] little fingers
[1:03:07] at first there was practically no
[1:03:10] movement at first
[1:03:11] and the at first is the worst thing
[1:03:14] yes the at first part is the worst thing
[1:03:17] because
[1:03:17] people start dwelling on the at first
[1:03:20] right
[1:03:20] and they forget about the later and the
[1:03:23] promise
[1:03:24] and the healing that is there to come
[1:03:26] very much and they get so
[1:03:27] fixated on the app first and then oh it
[1:03:29] hurts oh i can't do it
[1:03:32] but at first they barely moved
[1:03:36] them crippled fingers she tried to move
[1:03:39] practically no movement at all
[1:03:41] she continued to exercise her
[1:03:44] faith and she did it because uh
[1:03:48] and she did it became evident that
[1:03:51] she was able to move them more than she
[1:03:54] had before
[1:03:55] her fingers started moving that
[1:03:58] arthritis started leaving
[1:04:00] her face started kicking in yeah and and
[1:04:03] and the results came after a few more
[1:04:07] minutes she opened and closed her hands
[1:04:09] with perfect
[1:04:10] ease a smile came over her face
[1:04:13] and face and she realized she was then
[1:04:16] free from the crippled condition that
[1:04:19] had caused by the arthritis
[1:04:21] amen amen praise the lord
[1:04:24] sister norman was giving us a testimony
[1:04:26] a couple weeks ago
[1:04:27] how uh we just had a real powerful
[1:04:30] service and the spirit of god moved
[1:04:32] through the place
[1:04:33] and she had this thing on her hand and
[1:04:35] going home she looked and the thing was
[1:04:36] gone
[1:04:37] great notice that god had healed us
[1:04:39] completely gone yes
[1:04:40] amen see that's the kind of god we serve
[1:04:44] well that's the scriptural god see
[1:04:45] because the scripture of god says in
[1:04:47] psalms 107
[1:04:49] uh we'll just begin with verse 18 psalms
[1:04:51] 107 18 their soul abhoreth
[1:04:54] all matter of me they draw near into the
[1:04:57] gates of death then they cry unto the
[1:04:59] lord in their trouble
[1:05:00] and he saveth them out of their
[1:05:02] distresses he sent
[1:05:04] his word amen he
[1:05:08] sent his word now we're talking
[1:05:11] yeah and healed them and delivered them
[1:05:15] from their destructions what did it the
[1:05:18] word
[1:05:18] amen what was that scriptural evident in
[1:05:21] this story
[1:05:23] as he was preaching the word of faith
[1:05:26] she was sitting there
[1:05:27] and faith began to take hold into her
[1:05:29] life
[1:05:30] and as the faith took hold now it just
[1:05:34] didn't a lot of times people say damn
[1:05:35] there it is
[1:05:36] sometimes it's like a gradual thing your
[1:05:39] face starts building it starts getting
[1:05:41] to a place that you start thinking well
[1:05:43] yeah you know that is right
[1:05:46] god is real am i he did promise me and
[1:05:50] and before you know it you're just
[1:05:52] you're opening closing your
[1:05:53] hands with ease right as as the story
[1:05:56] goes well that's what it says the bible
[1:05:58] says
[1:05:58] he sent his word and his word healed
[1:06:02] them
[1:06:02] brother random had how many people come
[1:06:04] through prayer lines in his ministry
[1:06:07] thousands tens of thousands hundreds of
[1:06:08] thousands millions i don't know
[1:06:11] probably close to a million at least
[1:06:12] hundreds of thousands i would imagine
[1:06:14] and all the prayer lines he had but the
[1:06:16] bible says the word went forth and
[1:06:18] healed them
[1:06:18] right nothing wrong with the prayer line
[1:06:20] we had people come up last week a couple
[1:06:22] people we prayed for them i felt led to
[1:06:24] have
[1:06:25] uh people who wanted to get prayed for
[1:06:26] come and have lay hands later on that's
[1:06:28] scriptural too
[1:06:29] right but we know that the bible says
[1:06:31] that the word went forth and healed them
[1:06:34] the word went forth we know there's
[1:06:35] gifts of healing that's fine
[1:06:38] but the bible also says the word went
[1:06:40] forth
[1:06:41] and healed them and and delivered them
[1:06:45] from their destructions
[1:06:46] didn't just healed he delivered praise
[1:06:49] the lord
[1:06:50] oh oh 21st verse all that men
[1:06:54] would praise the lord for his goodness
[1:06:56] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:06:58] children of men amen praise the lord
[1:07:01] oh that men would i imagine that girl
[1:07:04] that lady probably had a jubilee after
[1:07:06] she saw her hands go open and then
[1:07:07] closing like this
[1:07:09] amen she probably maybe just in her
[1:07:11] heart we don't know
[1:07:12] uh he doesn't say or she jumped up and
[1:07:14] down but i imagine at least in her heart
[1:07:17] she got a jubilee and thank you
[1:07:18] praise the lord the knuckles straight
[1:07:20] down the hands are moving and every
[1:07:21] minute
[1:07:22] and it's all gone by the grace of god
[1:07:24] but the point was
[1:07:25] she exercised it right she didn't just
[1:07:28] sit there and say oh well praise the
[1:07:30] lord it's a good message and
[1:07:32] you know come to church and enjoy it and
[1:07:34] hear the man of god and
[1:07:35] he preaches and talks to us and reads to
[1:07:38] us out of the bible and
[1:07:39] all such no she took it personally she
[1:07:42] took it personally to the point that she
[1:07:44] put action behind it
[1:07:45] and she exercised it brother adam even
[1:07:48] said that she
[1:07:49] exercised her faith and she began to
[1:07:51] work on those hands i'm sure they
[1:07:53] probably heard
[1:07:55] there's some of you i think in gears had
[1:07:56] arthritis uh
[1:07:58] i've heard of people i know and a lot of
[1:08:00] people in my life have had arthritis
[1:08:02] and sister karen zinka and
[1:08:06] different ones my mom had bigger
[1:08:08] knuckles her arthritis wasn't that bad
[1:08:10] but
[1:08:10] anyway i've known a lot of people and
[1:08:12] it's painful and sometimes it hurts just
[1:08:15] to move that joint
[1:08:16] i mean it's painful but um and i imagine
[1:08:19] she
[1:08:19] it was probably painful but as she began
[1:08:22] to work it
[1:08:22] and the word began and a word continued
[1:08:24] to be preached and the faith began to
[1:08:26] continue to grow
[1:08:27] and her faith and she began to exercise
[1:08:30] and let the exercising of her faith
[1:08:32] show that there was a work behind what
[1:08:35] she said in faith and believe
[1:08:37] then then god healed it god took and
[1:08:40] healed it because she did something
[1:08:42] she didn't just sit there and let it and
[1:08:44] just let it evolve
[1:08:45] she did something about it amen she did
[1:08:48] something about it
[1:08:49] we talked about abraham last week
[1:08:53] and we went into genesis and the things
[1:08:55] that was talked about with abraham and
[1:08:58] and you know you read the bible you see
[1:09:00] abraham
[1:09:01] when god told him about isaac abraham
[1:09:03] laughed
[1:09:04] when god told him with sarah in the tent
[1:09:06] sarah laughed
[1:09:07] they both laughed 190 years 100 abraham
[1:09:10] was 100
[1:09:11] she was 90 and they both laughed
[1:09:15] but the bible in romans doesn't tell you
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:18] right so when god comes and explains it
[1:09:21] to a man of god saul paul
[1:09:24] to write it in the bible in the new
[1:09:26] testament it doesn't talk about that
[1:09:29] it talks a whole different story let's
[1:09:31] read a little bit of it
[1:09:32] romans chapter 4
[1:09:35] romans chapter 4 verse 17
[1:09:39] it says as i have as it is written i
[1:09:41] have made thee a father of many nations
[1:09:44] before him whom he believed even god who
[1:09:47] quickeneth the dead and call it those
[1:09:48] things which
[1:09:49] be not as though they were things that
[1:09:52] be not as though they were right
[1:09:56] just like the opening scripture hebrews
[1:09:59] 11
[1:10:00] amen faith is a substance well what is
[1:10:03] that substance is the thing is the
[1:10:04] substance of things
[1:10:06] hoped for it's an evidence
[1:10:09] of things not seen now i i can tell you
[1:10:13] i have a water bottle on this pulpit
[1:10:15] and and if it was different you couldn't
[1:10:18] see it
[1:10:18] you'd have to take my word for it but
[1:10:21] you might still doubt
[1:10:23] that there was actually a water bottle
[1:10:24] here but when you saw it
[1:10:27] you said okay there's the evidence the
[1:10:29] evidence proves that what i said was
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:32] well what's the evidence that we're
[1:10:33] looking for when we talk about
[1:10:35] having an exercising of our faith
[1:10:38] we're looking for the manifestation of
[1:10:40] the spirit of god
[1:10:42] to move in our lives we talk about
[1:10:44] physical healing all the time but it's
[1:10:46] not
[1:10:46] not just physical healing right it's
[1:10:49] spiritual and
[1:10:50] financial and emotional and for our
[1:10:52] families and for our loved ones and
[1:10:54] there there's so many things that god
[1:10:56] you know
[1:10:57] you know you don't have to believe god
[1:10:58] for just one thing at a time right
[1:11:00] amen right um i honestly it was a time
[1:11:02] in my life
[1:11:03] i kind of was like that unconsciously
[1:11:06] i would just pray for like one thing at
[1:11:08] a time and one time i was praying and i
[1:11:10] thought well i have more wrong to me
[1:11:12] wrong more wrong than just that right i
[1:11:15] just ask god he's a multi-tasker he can
[1:11:17] do it all at one time if he wants
[1:11:19] right he can hear it all at one time he
[1:11:20] can ingest it he's gone
[1:11:23] i don't just have to tell him there's
[1:11:24] certain people i know that if you tell
[1:11:26] them more than one thing
[1:11:27] the one thing that you said first is
[1:11:29] going to get done the thing that you
[1:11:31] said second
[1:11:31] they didn't even hear right i just know
[1:11:34] people like that
[1:11:36] that's just the way it is i'll probably
[1:11:38] like that sometimes
[1:11:39] that you you might say two or three
[1:11:41] different things
[1:11:42] one or two things get heard one thing
[1:11:44] gets left off god's not like that
[1:11:46] he's a multitasker he can take it all
[1:11:48] yeah amen he can take it all
[1:11:50] from all of us at one time he he
[1:11:54] can do it all so there's much more than
[1:11:56] just physical
[1:11:57] healing that we're talking about but the
[1:12:00] exercising of that faith
[1:12:02] is what's the key here is what we're
[1:12:04] talking about we needed evidence
[1:12:07] our faith if it's true faith our faith
[1:12:10] will bring an
[1:12:11] evidence it'll bring proof amen amen
[1:12:14] it'll bring proof
[1:12:17] now 18th verse who against hope
[1:12:21] believed in hope that he might become
[1:12:23] the father of many nations according to
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:26] which was spoken so shall i see be
[1:12:29] now look at the scripture again it says
[1:12:32] he
[1:12:32] who against hope now that's the other
[1:12:36] thing that a lot of people have
[1:12:37] trouble with they have a problem
[1:12:42] i spoke on this a little bit yesterday
[1:12:44] going beyond the vision
[1:12:45] of our see tasteful smell here going
[1:12:48] beyond just the tangible
[1:12:50] what we see here what we have in this
[1:12:53] natural normal
[1:12:54] nominal life going beyond that and
[1:12:56] seeing beyond
[1:12:57] the the realms of this natural reach to
[1:13:00] where god is
[1:13:01] to where faith exists to our healings
[1:13:04] brought down
[1:13:05] or whatever it is to our lives right
[1:13:08] against hope you look and say well
[1:13:10] there's no hope of that happening well
[1:13:13] that's true man there isn't if you're
[1:13:15] going to take that attitude
[1:13:17] if you're gonna say that and believe
[1:13:18] that yeah there is no hope
[1:13:20] i used to have people come into my job
[1:13:22] in charlotte and they would say
[1:13:24] uh and i'd have a little sniffles or
[1:13:26] something they say you gotta call us and
[1:13:27] nope
[1:13:29] say oh you know you got it i hear the
[1:13:31] sentences i said no
[1:13:32] i said no that's just a lying devil
[1:13:34] that's not true that's not real
[1:13:36] what you hear and see now is not real
[1:13:39] that's a lie the devil right right amen
[1:13:41] and then
[1:13:42] i would go into someone else's office a
[1:13:45] different
[1:13:46] time or something and they'd have a
[1:13:47] little something they'd say oh i'm so
[1:13:49] sick i said yes you are no you're mad
[1:13:50] look at me
[1:13:52] why would you say that i said well you
[1:13:53] just confessed it
[1:13:55] you just told me you were you just told
[1:13:57] the whole world the devil everybody else
[1:13:58] you're sick so you're right that's right
[1:14:00] you're gonna see are you gonna be sick
[1:14:01] you're gonna stay sick until you have
[1:14:03] faith
[1:14:04] to believe that that you're healed yeah
[1:14:06] you're gonna be sick
[1:14:08] so your testimony has a lot to do with
[1:14:11] the exercising of that faith we can't
[1:14:14] it's so easy today now i think
[1:14:17] now pardon me a minute if you disagree
[1:14:19] with me i think
[1:14:20] that a lot of what's going on here is a
[1:14:23] test
[1:14:24] of our faith amen of a real believer
[1:14:27] true believers faith i really do i think
[1:14:30] it's a real test
[1:14:31] of our faith and i'm not saying because
[1:14:34] you do or don't wear a mask i'm not
[1:14:35] saying because you have or haven't come
[1:14:36] to church i'm not talking about that
[1:14:38] i'm just talking about the faith of
[1:14:40] believing what god is doing for his
[1:14:42] people today because there's gonna be
[1:14:44] this word that comes into a bride's
[1:14:46] heart as it's spoken by a minister as
[1:14:49] the word of god or brother branham
[1:14:50] or however it's spoken by the pure word
[1:14:52] of god not a man's ideal opinion
[1:14:54] but the pure word of god is going to
[1:14:56] bring forth faith
[1:14:58] to a people's lives it has to amen
[1:15:01] it absolutely has to now no matter
[1:15:04] whether you
[1:15:05] can feel it or think it friend when you
[1:15:07] if you're a child of god
[1:15:09] that faith is there that word has come
[1:15:12] it's going to produce
[1:15:13] itself it has to and it's getting to the
[1:15:16] place that right now
[1:15:18] we've lived in a country of plenty we've
[1:15:21] lived in a country
[1:15:22] where we have everything we don't need
[1:15:24] anything
[1:15:25] i don't know of anybody unless sometimes
[1:15:28] they
[1:15:29] get in trouble or by choice don't have
[1:15:32] food to eat or clothes on their back or
[1:15:34] a roof over their head
[1:15:35] most people do and if they don't a lot
[1:15:38] of times it's their fault
[1:15:39] right not always but a lot of times i
[1:15:42] i know people i used to drive uber lyft
[1:15:44] i know people uh
[1:15:45] get in the car and they tell me their
[1:15:47] friends are are homeless
[1:15:49] 19 years old i said why perfectly
[1:15:52] healthy well strong
[1:15:54] they choose to be that's right he wanted
[1:15:56] to be
[1:15:57] sometimes they make even more money
[1:15:59] standing on the corner than you and i do
[1:16:01] slaving away every day
[1:16:03] i think how but that's just the way it
[1:16:06] is but
[1:16:07] normally most of us have food we have
[1:16:10] clothes we have a house we have
[1:16:11] we have a good life we have insurance
[1:16:13] you have doctors medicine
[1:16:14] some of the best advancements of
[1:16:17] technology and science and medicine the
[1:16:19] world has ever known
[1:16:20] uh since the andalumian world
[1:16:24] uh because we know they were far beyond
[1:16:26] that to where we are today but we're
[1:16:28] getting to that point again now
[1:16:31] so much so that there's people like elon
[1:16:34] musk talk about putting things in
[1:16:35] people's heads and turning it into a
[1:16:37] robot
[1:16:38] they're they're wanting to change
[1:16:39] people's uh
[1:16:42] thought process and things in their
[1:16:44] brain
[1:16:45] so that they don't do things wrong or
[1:16:48] never make a mistake or anything i mean
[1:16:51] just basically turn you into a robot
[1:16:53] right artificial intelligence taking
[1:16:56] over the country
[1:16:57] point is we've had it good we've had it
[1:17:01] easy friend but we
[1:17:02] can't let our faith grow weak it's so
[1:17:05] easy for it to grow weak when you don't
[1:17:07] use it
[1:17:08] right when you don't have to use it when
[1:17:10] you don't feel like there's any
[1:17:12] uh something that you say well i i'm
[1:17:15] getting a headache i go to the medicine
[1:17:17] cabinet
[1:17:17] uh i i i broke my leg i go to the doctor
[1:17:21] or stitch or uh whatever it is
[1:17:25] i go to my bank account i got some money
[1:17:27] i got a job whatever
[1:17:29] god takes care we got cars we can get
[1:17:31] here to there faster than anybody's ever
[1:17:33] done it
[1:17:34] uh airplanes and whatever we just
[1:17:36] haven't had to use our faith so much
[1:17:39] right right i don't know unless you just
[1:17:42] haven't told me that there's
[1:17:44] anybody in this room and probably
[1:17:46] streaming now
[1:17:47] that's ever set down at your dinner
[1:17:49] table with absolutely not a speck of
[1:17:51] food in your house
[1:17:52] right there's people i know have done
[1:17:54] that heard stories about it
[1:17:57] but when you're hungry what do you do
[1:18:00] if you don't go to the the local
[1:18:03] restaurant or something
[1:18:04] you go into your cupboard and you got
[1:18:07] food
[1:18:08] i know i'm embarrassed sometimes to tell
[1:18:11] this about me and my wife
[1:18:13] and we'll sit there and say what do you
[1:18:14] want to have for dinner why we don't
[1:18:16] have hardly much heat here
[1:18:17] and you go look in the cupboards they're
[1:18:19] full you go look in the freezer
[1:18:21] full you go look in the fridge full and
[1:18:24] we're talking to each other well there's
[1:18:25] not much here to eat
[1:18:27] right you know what these people come
[1:18:29] from third world countries they'll
[1:18:30] probably smack us in the face
[1:18:33] there's more food in there that feeds my
[1:18:35] family in a month
[1:18:37] right but we've got it so easy right we
[1:18:40] got it so comfortable
[1:18:42] i think maybe it is oh this covet maybe
[1:18:45] even isn't pulling out of the
[1:18:46] of the of the padding out of the nest
[1:18:50] so we get down to get a sticker say lord
[1:18:54] i i want to trust you my faith to be in
[1:18:57] you
[1:18:58] again our faith try to keep our faith
[1:19:01] from letting it grow
[1:19:02] weak exercising exercise our faith every
[1:19:05] day
[1:19:05] every day we should exercise it i'm not
[1:19:07] i'm not saying you're expecting
[1:19:09] necessarily something supernatural of
[1:19:11] the heavens to open every day but
[1:19:14] something in your life to to spark that
[1:19:17] faith
[1:19:18] i mean if it's just in prayer if it's
[1:19:20] just in reading your bible
[1:19:21] or listening to a message or something a
[1:19:24] a tape
[1:19:25] then something that just sparks that
[1:19:27] faith
[1:19:28] don't let it grow amen because abraham
[1:19:32] believed against hope against hope
[1:19:36] and the only way you can believe against
[1:19:37] hope is to forget everything that you
[1:19:39] see
[1:19:40] hear every technology everything that
[1:19:43] tells you
[1:19:44] everything that says it's this but it's
[1:19:47] not god
[1:19:48] it's this you have to go against all of
[1:19:51] that
[1:19:51] and say no it's not you ever heard the
[1:19:54] story that was told i believe it's a
[1:19:56] true story
[1:19:57] if i remember that these uh
[1:20:00] these people and i believe it was uh
[1:20:03] yeah it was
[1:20:04] it was uh i can't remember if it was on
[1:20:07] tape but
[1:20:07] it was it was involving brother branham
[1:20:11] and this uh
[1:20:15] child i can't remember trying to think
[1:20:16] it was a son or daughter i can't
[1:20:18] remember
[1:20:18] a child that had an accident and she was
[1:20:21] laying
[1:20:22] uh in the hospital and the parents were
[1:20:24] grieved
[1:20:25] and they wanted brother branham to come
[1:20:27] pray for her and the doctors are saying
[1:20:29] there's no hope
[1:20:30] you know she's going to be going anytime
[1:20:33] you know there's no way she can live
[1:20:35] there's no way she can survive
[1:20:37] and her vitals kept going down and down
[1:20:39] and down the machines kept giving a
[1:20:41] bleak picture
[1:20:42] the machines that she was tied to kept
[1:20:44] making it look like she was going and
[1:20:46] going and going and going
[1:20:47] you know and and all hope was gone right
[1:20:51] so when when brother branham came in and
[1:20:53] prayed for her
[1:20:55] the parents started getting happy they
[1:20:57] started celebrating and praising the
[1:20:59] lord
[1:21:00] and the doctor comes into the nurse and
[1:21:02] says what are you all so happy about
[1:21:04] don't y'all see those machines don't you
[1:21:06] see the condition of your
[1:21:07] i'll just say daughter don't you see the
[1:21:09] condition of your daughter
[1:21:10] don't you see what's happening here she
[1:21:12] is dying she is going
[1:21:14] and there's nothing else we can do about
[1:21:16] it praise the lord because that's when
[1:21:18] god works the best yes
[1:21:20] because when there's nothing else you
[1:21:22] can do about it is when god works the
[1:21:24] best
[1:21:25] and they said oh you precious nurse
[1:21:29] we appreciate all that you've done for
[1:21:30] us we appreciate the care that you've
[1:21:32] given to our daughter and all that
[1:21:34] you've done to help her
[1:21:35] say but ma'am you're trained to look at
[1:21:38] those
[1:21:39] instruments and to read those
[1:21:40] instruments and to follow your medicine
[1:21:41] to follow your training
[1:21:43] that's that's what you're trained in
[1:21:44] that's what you're supposed to do
[1:21:46] he said but we're trained to believe god
[1:21:49] and a prophet of god has come and prayed
[1:21:51] for our daughter and we know
[1:21:54] against hope she's going to be well
[1:21:56] right am i
[1:21:57] we know she's going to be well and of
[1:21:59] course i don't have to tell you the rest
[1:22:01] of the story
[1:22:02] amen her vitals started coming up but
[1:22:05] see they exodus
[1:22:06] even after brother branham prayed for
[1:22:08] her you understand the story
[1:22:10] and why i said it even after brother and
[1:22:13] prayed for the vitals kept going down
[1:22:15] right she kept getting worse after he
[1:22:18] prayed for her
[1:22:19] but their faith went from zero
[1:22:23] to a hundred percent am i because they
[1:22:25] believed
[1:22:26] right they believed now that was brother
[1:22:29] brown it doesn't have to be brother
[1:22:30] branham
[1:22:31] right now because it's just the faith
[1:22:33] here's if it's still faith
[1:22:35] it's the same faith it takes faith to
[1:22:36] move them out and it takes faith to
[1:22:38] believe god it takes faith from anybody
[1:22:40] simple faith it doesn't have to be a
[1:22:42] faith that
[1:22:43] that you say i'm going to pull the moon
[1:22:45] down and wrap a bow around it tonight
[1:22:48] no it just says just simple faith just
[1:22:50] simple faith to
[1:22:51] i just believed god against hope against
[1:22:54] hope those
[1:22:55] parents believed against hope everything
[1:22:58] told them contrary
[1:23:00] everything told abraham contrary his own
[1:23:03] body was speaking to him
[1:23:05] her own body was speaking to her and
[1:23:07] said you cannot do this
[1:23:09] right right this is not biologically
[1:23:12] possible
[1:23:13] right but god says i made biology
[1:23:16] america right amen
[1:23:17] i made your body i made the components
[1:23:20] of your body
[1:23:21] and they're going to be to the position
[1:23:23] and the place by
[1:23:24] body chains that you're going to
[1:23:26] conceive and bring forth the promised
[1:23:28] son
[1:23:29] amen amen amen praise the lord
[1:23:32] in the case of hell cannot prevail
[1:23:34] against him right that's right
[1:23:35] hallelujah
[1:23:37] against hope he believed in hope that he
[1:23:38] might become the father of many nations
[1:23:41] according to that which
[1:23:42] uh which was spoken so shall thy seed be
[1:23:46] being not weak in faith even though he
[1:23:48] laughed
[1:23:49] right we see in genesis he laughed but
[1:23:53] god's account he didn't hear that amen
[1:23:56] god doesn't count that day
[1:23:58] i'm not saying god didn't hear him god
[1:24:00] right he just didn't account it
[1:24:01] yes sir right right being not weak in
[1:24:03] faith he considered not his own body
[1:24:06] now dead when he was about a hundred
[1:24:09] years old neither yet the deadness of
[1:24:10] sarah's womb
[1:24:11] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:24:13] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:24:15] giving glory to god
[1:24:17] being fully persuaded that what he had
[1:24:19] promised he was able
[1:24:20] also able uh able also
[1:24:24] to perform and therefore it was imputed
[1:24:27] to him for righteousness
[1:24:29] now it was not written for it was not
[1:24:33] written for his sake alone
[1:24:35] that it was imputed to him but for us
[1:24:38] also it's for us
[1:24:42] it's for right here december 6
[1:24:46] 2020 with the swirling vertex of
[1:24:49] covet going around this world it is for
[1:24:52] you
[1:24:53] it is for us it is for you today
[1:24:57] to exercise that faith and believe this
[1:24:59] pertains to me
[1:25:01] as well as it did for abraham this
[1:25:03] pertains to me
[1:25:04] as well as it did for brother branham
[1:25:06] this pertains to me as well as it does
[1:25:09] anybody ever lived right because i'm a
[1:25:11] part of him amen
[1:25:12] i'm a part of this promise yes by faith
[1:25:16] i'm the facing not necessarily the blood
[1:25:18] lineage
[1:25:19] but the facie through jesus christ i'm a
[1:25:22] part of that
[1:25:24] i'm a part of it and the gates of hell
[1:25:26] cannot prevail against
[1:25:27] you or i anyone that believes
[1:25:31] because it was for us too it shall be
[1:25:33] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[1:25:35] up
[1:25:36] jesus our lord from the dead and who if
[1:25:39] you believe
[1:25:40] i believe am i i believe today amen you
[1:25:43] believe
[1:25:44] amen i believe yes i believe in by faith
[1:25:47] i believe
[1:25:48] and by faith and works in my life that i
[1:25:51] believe
[1:25:51] yes now god moves
[1:25:55] in mysterious ways we don't always
[1:25:58] understand it
[1:25:59] right and sometimes we not we might not
[1:26:02] always
[1:26:02] recognize it in the capacity as god is
[1:26:05] bringing it
[1:26:06] but the thing of it is god does it right
[1:26:10] god brings it to pass now i've said this
[1:26:13] before but
[1:26:14] when when you when you go in prayer and
[1:26:18] you know we have prayer requests today
[1:26:19] or you pray in
[1:26:21] your own special place it's your own
[1:26:23] time whenever you pray or talk
[1:26:25] communion with the lord and you ask god
[1:26:27] or you commune with god or you
[1:26:28] you petition god on somebody else's
[1:26:30] behalf or a healing for someone or
[1:26:32] salvation for a family member or
[1:26:34] something
[1:26:35] you know we always have in our minds but
[1:26:38] this you know
[1:26:39] that that this is the way god's gonna do
[1:26:41] it you know
[1:26:42] there's always that preconceived notion
[1:26:45] you know
[1:26:46] this is how god's gonna do it this is
[1:26:48] the way god is going to deliver this
[1:26:50] is where god is going to help this is
[1:26:51] where god's going to heal
[1:26:53] and you know sometimes we get so fixated
[1:26:56] just like they did with the messiah
[1:26:59] coming
[1:27:00] they had gotten so fixated on exactly
[1:27:02] how the messiah was supposed to come
[1:27:04] that when he did come they completely
[1:27:06] missed him right
[1:27:07] right and then when he became to
[1:27:10] came to uh expose himself to them of
[1:27:13] course their eyes were blinded they
[1:27:15] couldn't see
[1:27:15] but they missed him all together who
[1:27:17] expected their savior and deliverer to
[1:27:20] come and be born on the
[1:27:22] on a manure pile right
[1:27:25] who i know nobody would have conceived
[1:27:28] that but that was god's way of doing it
[1:27:30] right and see whatever god's way of
[1:27:33] doing it is the way that we want it to
[1:27:34] be done
[1:27:36] because however god chooses to do it
[1:27:38] when
[1:27:40] that's another thing we have a problem
[1:27:42] right right when
[1:27:43] god chooses to do it now don't but now
[1:27:46] don't let wind confuse your lack of
[1:27:48] faith
[1:27:50] okay now don't let don't let our lack of
[1:27:53] faith be confused with
[1:27:54] when now when is appropriate because
[1:27:57] god is going to be in his time but don't
[1:27:59] just say well
[1:28:00] when because you don't have enough faith
[1:28:02] to believe right
[1:28:03] if you don't have enough faith to
[1:28:05] believe then own up to it
[1:28:07] and say i just you know brother sister
[1:28:10] my faith just hasn't reached the place
[1:28:12] that i could just receive that yet right
[1:28:14] and just be honest
[1:28:16] don't say well god it's not in his time
[1:28:18] yet or something it might not be
[1:28:19] you understand what i'm saying don't
[1:28:20] confuse the two of those don't confuse
[1:28:22] your faith in your wisdom
[1:28:24] right some people they may not have
[1:28:26] faith and they said well i'm just
[1:28:28] uh i'm just using wisdom and that's fine
[1:28:30] because there's a place for that
[1:28:32] there's a place for faith there's a
[1:28:33] place for wisdom there's a place that
[1:28:35] you
[1:28:35] follow the leading of the lord in your
[1:28:37] life and that's the most important thing
[1:28:38] amen follow the leading of the lord your
[1:28:40] life but don't confuse the two
[1:28:42] don't confuse the two don't let one
[1:28:46] denigrate the other put the other down
[1:28:49] amen if the face is there let that work
[1:28:51] work that faith
[1:28:53] right amen let it work that faith and
[1:28:55] your faith then becomes evident because
[1:28:57] people see
[1:28:58] right amen it's craziness to the world
[1:29:02] but to a christian to a believer it's
[1:29:05] it it's the gospel it's a way of life
[1:29:08] right it's truth to them it was truth to
[1:29:11] abraham
[1:29:12] god said go abraham went 12 minutes
[1:29:16] i still can't get over that 12 minutes
[1:29:17] he spoke to abraham
[1:29:19] but all that abraham did all the things
[1:29:21] that happened in his life
[1:29:23] it was about faith he did it by faith
[1:29:25] the things brother branham did
[1:29:26] and i used him as examples because you
[1:29:28] know the scriptural example and
[1:29:30] of course our most recent example of
[1:29:32] probably the one that lived the closest
[1:29:34] to jesus
[1:29:35] but look friend those examples we look
[1:29:39] to
[1:29:40] i can tell you and if each one of us got
[1:29:43] up
[1:29:44] and testified you could come up with you
[1:29:46] would have something in your life
[1:29:47] that's just as powerful just as
[1:29:49] supernatural
[1:29:51] it might not have happened on that white
[1:29:53] of scale but it's not supposed to open
[1:29:54] on that widest scale we didn't have the
[1:29:56] ministry brother branham had right we
[1:29:58] didn't have the colleague brother
[1:29:59] bradham had
[1:30:00] but i can absolutely document to you
[1:30:04] miracles that have happened in our lives
[1:30:06] yes amen
[1:30:07] that boy right there fell 20 feet out 20
[1:30:10] foot out of a tree on his bright and
[1:30:11] didn't hardly get a scratch
[1:30:14] and he will testify to you when he was
[1:30:16] eight
[1:30:18] mama an angel caught me you're mad got
[1:30:21] out there no more in
[1:30:23] five seconds being there an angel caught
[1:30:25] me i felt an arm grab me here and here
[1:30:26] and lay me down on the ground
[1:30:30] who does that sounds some
[1:30:34] the world would have had the boy
[1:30:35] committed thought he was insane
[1:30:38] well you're crazy to believe such no
[1:30:40] it's not crazy it's just a way of life
[1:30:42] amen it's just who we are
[1:30:44] that's just one thing i come up with
[1:30:45] with him sitting there in my remembrance
[1:30:47] but how many of you can do the same
[1:30:49] thing
[1:30:50] right now you could each one of you
[1:30:52] could probably i'm sure do the same
[1:30:53] thing because that one thing comes to
[1:30:54] your mind my wife's got a brand new
[1:30:56] muscle in her foot
[1:30:57] had it for 20 plus years yes 30 over 30
[1:30:59] years
[1:31:00] brand new muscle that's what the doctor
[1:31:03] said
[1:31:04] right the doctor said she's got a new
[1:31:06] muscle
[1:31:07] hmm praise the lord well that's one time
[1:31:11] i'm gonna believe the doctor
[1:31:14] doctor says she got a new muscle well
[1:31:16] praise the lord she got a new muscle
[1:31:17] but i got more than the doctor to back
[1:31:19] that up that's why i believe that right
[1:31:20] but you could do the exact same thing
[1:31:23] now god didn't have to come down and
[1:31:25] and and hurricanes and tornadoes and
[1:31:28] whirling
[1:31:29] vortexes fire and brimstone no
[1:31:32] it's it's just living a godly christian
[1:31:35] life
[1:31:35] by exercising every day our faith
[1:31:40] you know some people believe that they
[1:31:43] have a hard time with their children
[1:31:45] and they bring them to church and you
[1:31:47] know
[1:31:48] especially nowadays you know children uh
[1:31:51] i'm thankful tabatha and
[1:31:52] zach bring their children and and art
[1:31:56] and sharia bring their children but some
[1:31:57] people
[1:31:58] you know i've had people tell me all my
[1:32:00] children just can't
[1:32:01] they can't take it they can't sit still
[1:32:03] i said well how do you think they're
[1:32:04] ever going to learn
[1:32:05] right if you don't put them in the
[1:32:06] situation right how are they going to
[1:32:08] ever learn
[1:32:09] if you don't bring them and put them in
[1:32:11] the places going to exercise that to
[1:32:13] train them
[1:32:14] the way they're supposed to be they
[1:32:16] never will learn that's right
[1:32:18] i had people at my job in charlotte they
[1:32:20] told me i'm not taking my kids out to
[1:32:22] any public place until they're 15 or
[1:32:25] whatever it was
[1:32:27] i thought i said that's not training
[1:32:31] your children
[1:32:32] right if you didn't want your children
[1:32:34] why did you have them
[1:32:36] right if you don't want them now i'm not
[1:32:39] i'm not for abortion uh if you don't
[1:32:41] want children don't do what it takes to
[1:32:43] get children
[1:32:44] right that's the easiest way not to have
[1:32:46] children don't perform the act that
[1:32:48] causes children to come forth that's the
[1:32:50] best thing
[1:32:50] but they said i'm not going to get my
[1:32:53] children out
[1:32:54] anywhere and that kid come to work one
[1:32:56] day
[1:32:57] and i got a real glimpse of what she was
[1:32:59] talking about
[1:33:00] that kid was everywhere
[1:33:03] but they have to be trained right
[1:33:06] and i'm thankful that they train them so
[1:33:09] when you train them
[1:33:10] my point in saying this is when you
[1:33:12] train them
[1:33:13] it brings us to a place in life where
[1:33:17] when that training will kick in right
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:20] and i and that's what exactly what god's
[1:33:22] doing for us
[1:33:23] exactly what god's doing to us this is
[1:33:26] all our life experiences
[1:33:27] all training it's all that god does i
[1:33:30] can look back on things in our lives
[1:33:32] friend
[1:33:32] as i know you could and not understand
[1:33:34] it one bit now more than i did then
[1:33:37] say god why did this happen right why
[1:33:39] did you allow this to happen why did
[1:33:41] this go on
[1:33:42] why did this happen this way god is
[1:33:44] training you
[1:33:45] god is molding you god is making you now
[1:33:47] some things happen or just our fault we
[1:33:49] just
[1:33:50] did something that we shouldn't have
[1:33:51] done or said something we shouldn't have
[1:33:52] done or
[1:33:53] whatever the circumstances but a lot of
[1:33:55] our lives if you're a christian if
[1:33:57] you're a believer
[1:33:58] you're one of god's it's training god's
[1:34:00] leading us and bringing you this
[1:34:02] to this place for a purpose for a reason
[1:34:05] it's just like training the children
[1:34:07] well now when when when alice and
[1:34:10] gabriel and
[1:34:11] t and and joel and emma get into church
[1:34:14] they're generally pretty good children
[1:34:16] when they first started coming you were
[1:34:18] there not so much
[1:34:21] disruptive around but see that's they
[1:34:23] got trained
[1:34:24] right and they know now we're in church
[1:34:27] right
[1:34:28] you act this way when we're in church
[1:34:29] this is what you do amen amen this
[1:34:32] you listen and then when they get older
[1:34:33] then they start listening and
[1:34:35] and that's that's the training the same
[1:34:37] thing happens to us
[1:34:38] as children or as children of god that
[1:34:41] faith gets exercised
[1:34:43] amen and we need to keep the exercising
[1:34:46] of our faith
[1:34:47] so it doesn't grow weak so easy for our
[1:34:49] faith to grow weak
[1:34:51] but we need to make sure that we keep
[1:34:53] our faith i'm going to read one more
[1:34:55] scripture
[1:34:56] and uh time's getting by but let's turn
[1:34:58] to uh
[1:34:59] james
[1:35:05] here's another one brother brown was
[1:35:07] talking about and i hear ye him
[1:35:11] in oregon 1960
[1:35:15] he said if you couldn't move a finger
[1:35:17] move it now
[1:35:20] if you couldn't hear out of one ear put
[1:35:22] your finger in the other one
[1:35:24] no matter or no matter what you are
[1:35:27] you'll never do no better listen very
[1:35:30] closely now he says you will never
[1:35:32] do no better until you
[1:35:35] exercise your faith you'll never do no
[1:35:39] better never mind
[1:35:40] i probably should have finished with
[1:35:41] that that's probably a good finishing
[1:35:43] place you'll never do no better
[1:35:45] until you exercise your faith amen
[1:35:49] and i'm talking to myself that's good i
[1:35:51] want to hear this
[1:35:52] amen i can never do any better
[1:35:55] until i exercise my faith amen
[1:36:00] give god a chance at it now give god a
[1:36:03] chance to do something for you
[1:36:05] so brother branham is equating
[1:36:07] exercising the faith
[1:36:08] as in giving god the chance that's what
[1:36:12] he said
[1:36:12] he's coupling the two together exercise
[1:36:15] your faith
[1:36:15] give god a chance to do something for
[1:36:18] you
[1:36:19] see the prayer of the faith been prayed
[1:36:22] hands been laid on you but now by the
[1:36:24] commandment of the lord jesus i command
[1:36:26] the devil leave you and every one of you
[1:36:28] be made well amen
[1:36:30] amen i believe it in the name of jesus
[1:36:34] amen those things the two that came up
[1:36:37] here
[1:36:38] sunday i believe it maybe amen my
[1:36:40] daughter's gonna go to the doctor
[1:36:42] tomorrow
[1:36:42] and you know what doctors aren't gonna
[1:36:44] find anything wrong with her
[1:36:46] you know why because there is nothing
[1:36:48] wrong with her that's right
[1:36:50] period there's there's there's no
[1:36:52] discussion
[1:36:53] uh we've already rebuked the devil so
[1:36:55] that's over he has no place there
[1:36:57] that's the end of it amen doesn't matter
[1:37:00] what
[1:37:01] else comes about whatever it's against
[1:37:04] all the doctors can say or
[1:37:06] think right amen that's the way it is
[1:37:09] because that's what the bible says james
[1:37:12] 2 17
[1:37:18] even so uh
[1:37:21] james did i say james 2 17. did i say
[1:37:24] that right okay
[1:37:25] james 2 7 8 2 17. even so faith
[1:37:28] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[1:37:32] faith being alone is dead
[1:37:36] get that now faith being alone is dead
[1:37:39] without works is dead
[1:37:40] yea a man may say thou has faith
[1:37:43] and i have works show me thy faith
[1:37:46] without thy works i will
[1:37:48] show you my faith by my works praise the
[1:37:51] lord that's exactly what jesus said
[1:37:53] he said if you can't believe me believe
[1:37:55] what you see right
[1:37:57] believe the evidence of who i am right
[1:37:59] the bible spoke of me
[1:38:01] my life has replicated what the bible
[1:38:04] says
[1:38:05] you see the evidence and the things
[1:38:07] that's happened in the ministry into my
[1:38:09] life
[1:38:09] if you can't believe me because i was
[1:38:11] born on manure pile believe the things
[1:38:13] you see
[1:38:14] happening exactly is it not telling you
[1:38:16] who i
[1:38:17] am amen amen
[1:38:21] show me your faith
[1:38:25] show me thy faith without thy works i
[1:38:27] will show thee my faith by my works
[1:38:30] thou believers that there is one god
[1:38:32] thou believeth well
[1:38:34] the devils also believe and tremble
[1:38:38] did you know that the devils out of hell
[1:38:41] believe in one god
[1:38:44] and yet the greatest denominationals and
[1:38:50] 90 plus percent of them don't right
[1:38:53] wow but the devils do
[1:38:56] most of christendom will tell you
[1:38:57] there's three of them right right
[1:38:59] some will tell you there's at least two
[1:39:02] i don't know if you know them i've known
[1:39:03] some of them too
[1:39:05] a lot of them will tell you there's
[1:39:06] three some of them will tell you they're
[1:39:07] two the bible will tell you there's only
[1:39:09] one
[1:39:09] yes so i'm not worried about
[1:39:11] denominations trying to tell me they're
[1:39:12] three
[1:39:13] right or some uh rogue denomination says
[1:39:15] there's two
[1:39:16] i want to say what the bible says the
[1:39:17] bible says there's only one
[1:39:19] even the devils know there's only one
[1:39:21] amen praise the lord
[1:39:24] amen is true now believers there is one
[1:39:28] god there does well the devils believe
[1:39:29] also and tremble
[1:39:33] but will thou know o vain man that faith
[1:39:36] without works is dead was not abraham
[1:39:38] our father justified by works when he
[1:39:41] had offered
[1:39:41] isaac his son upon the altar see is thou
[1:39:44] how faith wrought the
[1:39:45] wrought his works and by faith was uh by
[1:39:48] works was faith made perfect
[1:39:50] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:39:52] said abraham believed god and it was
[1:39:55] imputed unto him
[1:39:56] for righteousness and he was called the
[1:40:00] friend of god
[1:40:01] ye see now you see then now
[1:40:05] that by works a man is justified and not
[1:40:08] by faith only
[1:40:09] likewise was not also was not rey had
[1:40:12] the heart of justified by words when she
[1:40:13] had received in the messengers
[1:40:15] sent them out another way for as a body
[1:40:17] without the spirit
[1:40:18] is dead so faith without works is dead
[1:40:21] works is a manifestation of the faith
[1:40:24] that you have and the truth of god's
[1:40:26] word am i it's an evident to prove
[1:40:29] there's something in your life amen it's
[1:40:32] something that
[1:40:33] shows prayer requests we have the things
[1:40:36] that you have sometimes
[1:40:37] unspoken sometimes spoken things in your
[1:40:40] family
[1:40:40] things may be on your job whatever the
[1:40:42] situation may be
[1:40:44] again friend we're living in a country
[1:40:46] living in a world a country
[1:40:48] with all the negativity swirling around
[1:40:51] us
[1:40:51] right i told my wife the other day i
[1:40:54] said if this was a hundred years ago
[1:40:56] 90 plus percent of the americans would
[1:40:58] not even know that covet existed
[1:41:02] because it doesn't hardly even affect
[1:41:04] most of their lives
[1:41:06] of course most of them lived very
[1:41:08] secluded anyway
[1:41:09] and weren't around very many people
[1:41:10] because you didn't have huge metropolis
[1:41:12] everywhere like la and new york and so
[1:41:14] forth but i said you would never even
[1:41:16] know it
[1:41:17] you you turn on the news now you look at
[1:41:19] certain news programs
[1:41:21] and that's all they yell at you right
[1:41:23] that's all it's about
[1:41:24] i've never seen i i told
[1:41:28] sister norma's husband yesterday it's so
[1:41:30] good to see ronnie yesterday
[1:41:32] i told him i said i have never seen
[1:41:34] people
[1:41:35] so scared to death and petrified over
[1:41:38] something that has a 95 plus percent
[1:41:40] chance of recovery now i understand some
[1:41:43] people
[1:41:44] of course pre-existing conditions and
[1:41:46] things like that
[1:41:47] that's different of course uh older
[1:41:50] generation that type but
[1:41:51] i said 90 they they closed down
[1:41:54] schools
[1:41:58] and the statistics say they always say
[1:42:00] follow the science follow the science
[1:42:02] follow the statistics follow the data
[1:42:05] what does the data say
[1:42:06] the data says that a lot of these places
[1:42:08] are closing their schools
[1:42:10] when the data tells them that 99.9
[1:42:13] of the children survive coven if they
[1:42:16] even get it at all
[1:42:17] yeah almost a 100
[1:42:21] chance of survival and yet the
[1:42:23] everything
[1:42:24] it's apocalypse amen
[1:42:28] now one person is too many i understand
[1:42:31] i've said that before
[1:42:32] one person passing from it but i'll
[1:42:34] leave you with this story because this
[1:42:36] is the fear-mongering that's going on
[1:42:38] to help us exercise our faith amen
[1:42:41] i hear them screaming all the time about
[1:42:43] how many people have died
[1:42:44] biting through that against trump all
[1:42:46] the time but
[1:42:48] i was with a client the other day or
[1:42:50] someone that we're doing some electrical
[1:42:51] work for my brother roger was out of
[1:42:53] town and
[1:42:54] i was trying to find a trip a breaker
[1:42:56] kept tripping it had a
[1:42:57] round short somewhere i was going over
[1:42:59] their house to find it
[1:43:01] uh like i did the dinka's house and uh
[1:43:04] you know you know me most places i go i
[1:43:07] end up talking about the lord to
[1:43:08] somebody that wants to talk so
[1:43:10] uh we're just talking about the lord but
[1:43:12] he told me that he went into his
[1:43:14] homeopathic doctor and they had no mask
[1:43:17] and he asked why she said she says well
[1:43:19] i'm not under the cdc guidelines i don't
[1:43:21] know what all that means but that's what
[1:43:23] she said
[1:43:24] and so they didn't wear a mask she said
[1:43:26] i've never had anybody
[1:43:27] have covered come in but she said she
[1:43:30] had a client come in
[1:43:32] and this is how deceptive it is you
[1:43:34] can't put your faith and trust in all
[1:43:36] this
[1:43:38] she came in and she had a new death
[1:43:40] certificate
[1:43:41] this woman did and she said that her
[1:43:45] and you know the doctor knew it
[1:43:48] and relayed this message to that client
[1:43:50] of ours
[1:43:52] that told him that her husband
[1:43:55] died 18 months ago of cancer
[1:43:59] 18 months ago cancer 18 months you
[1:44:02] hadn't heard of it 18 months ago
[1:44:04] but she comes in to this homeopathic
[1:44:06] doctor with a new birth
[1:44:08] a death certificate that the government
[1:44:10] sent to her
[1:44:11] declaring her husband's death as coveted
[1:44:18] 18 months he'd be dead of cancer
[1:44:21] and yet they they redid a brand new
[1:44:24] death certificate for the man
[1:44:25] declaring it a covet death
[1:44:30] can you always believe what you hear out
[1:44:32] there no no but you can believe what you
[1:44:35] hear or read in here
[1:44:37] amen amen and exercise
[1:44:40] that exercise that praise the lord
[1:44:44] that's what brings the results it brings
[1:44:47] the results
[1:44:48] we pray we have faith but then sometimes
[1:44:51] we put
[1:44:52] are we not sometimes we should always
[1:44:54] put something behind
[1:44:55] that faith amen always behind that
[1:44:59] praise the lord let's stand if we could
