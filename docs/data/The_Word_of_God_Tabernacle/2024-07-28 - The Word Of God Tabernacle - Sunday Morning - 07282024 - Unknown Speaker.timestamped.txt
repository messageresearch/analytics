[44:59] to do but I want to speak on the
[45:01] spiritual growth amen spiritual growth
[45:04] brother bam titled it statue of a
[45:06] perfect man amen but we find this
[45:09] scripture that he preached that out of
[45:11] in second Peter uh verses 1-10 so uh
[45:15] chapter 1 verses 1-1 so that's where I
[45:18] want to begin my scripture reading today
[45:21] 2 Peter 1 1-10 before we do though could
[45:25] just bow our heads for another word of
[45:26] pray Lord Jesus very thankful again lord
[45:30] of the blessings that you give us every
[45:32] day thank you Lord for the spirit that
[45:34] we felt thank you Lord to know that we

[45:39] to this place
[45:40] that uh we come in your name and we're
[45:44] to there together in your name you're
[45:46] there and we thank you Lord that we
[45:48] don't come in the name of a man we don't
[45:50] come in the name of a pastor a church a
[45:52] denomination we come in the name of the
[45:54] Lord Jesus Christ the only name that
[45:57] whereby man could be saved that precious
[46:00] name that should be revered and
[46:03] worshiped and spoke of in love and and
[46:06] reverence Lord that precious name that
[46:09] means so much to us Lord it means it
[46:12] meant so much to John that Lord when
[46:14] that when your name was spoke he leaped
[46:17] in his mother's womb hadn't been felt
[46:19] for months thought he was dead but John
[46:23] the Baptist leaped to life when the name
[46:25] Jesus was mentioned
[46:27] Lord what a time it is today if that'll
[46:30] happen to them then God what should it
[46:32] do to each of us that we jump in joy
[46:35] that we jump in in faith that we jump in
[46:38] in spirit Lord knowing that you're still

[47:08] do know at that time God we won't have

[47:16] blessing Grace Lord as we continue to
[47:19] press this battle with all that we have

[48:13] we commit it to you we ask your
[48:15] blessings upon it now in the name of the
[48:17] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[48:22] second Peter chapter
[48:24] 1 amen read vers 1-10 Simon Peter a
[48:29] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[48:31] to them that have obtained like Precious
[48:34] Faith with us through the righteousness
[48:36] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace
[48:40] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[48:42] the knowledge of God and of our of Jesus
[48:45] our lord according as his divine power
[48:49] ha given unto us all things that pertain
[48:51] unto life and godliness through the
[48:54] knowledge of him that ha called us to
[48:56] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[48:59] us exceeding great and precious promises
[49:02] that by these you might be partakers of
[49:04] the divine nature having escaped the
[49:07] corruption that is in the world through
[49:09] lust and beside this giving all
[49:12] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[49:15] to Virtue knowledge to knowledge
[49:18] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[49:21] and to patience godliness and to
[49:23] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[49:25] brotherly kindness
[49:27] charity for if these things be in you
[49:31] and abound they make you that ye shall
[49:34] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[49:37] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[49:41] he that lath these things is blind and
[49:44] cannot see a far off and have forgotten
[49:47] that he was purged from his old sins
[49:50] wherefore the brother Brethren give
[49:51] diligence to make your calling and
[49:53] election sure for if you do these things
[49:57] ye shall never fall you can be seated if
[50:01] You'
[50:02] like amen ye shall never fall I I drew
[50:07] this on the on the board here I'm not
[50:10] really necessarily going to go to the
[50:11] board or write anything on the board
[50:13] just the thing that brother brandom had
[50:15] give us for this pyramid of the Statue
[50:18] of a perfect man pyramid amen I also got
[50:22] something that my sister uh I believe it
[50:25] was my sister she
[50:27] uh not crochet but crossstitch she cross
[50:31] stitched some of these and gave them to
[50:33] different ones and I like to hang it in
[50:35] here somewhere I haven't decided where
[50:37] yet but uh it's it's a it's a beautiful
[50:41] depiction of the Statue of a perfect man
[50:44] amen and of course uh we won't be I
[50:47] won't be going into so much the church
[50:49] ages or The Messengers to those Ages
[50:51] which you can see on here my main object
[50:54] my main objective today is the spiritual
[50:57] growth that we get from uh this
[50:59] scripture and from these things but uh I
[51:02] thought about showing that instead of
[51:05] this but it's kind of small so it's
[51:07] fairly difficult to see the lettering on
[51:09] that maybe when we get it hung up you
[51:11] can look at it a little closer but I'm
[51:13] sure that we've all probably have maybe
[51:16] pictures like this or uh in different
[51:19] books and things like that we have it
[51:21] and have it with the church ages and
[51:23] with the messengers on it and how it's
[51:26] uh different ones different people have
[51:27] done different ways people have made
[51:29] religion out of this uh have taken this
[51:33] have taken this and made a basically a
[51:35] religion within the message out of it uh
[51:37] they I've seen some where they've taken
[51:39] love the Capstone off and uh put
[51:42] something in the middle and all and I
[51:43] personally don't necessarily care to add
[51:46] anything beyond what brother brandom
[51:47] told us what he what was drawn and what
[51:50] we see in the scripture uh but different
[51:53] people had their different takes on it
[51:54] and that's that's up to them that's okay
[51:57] I actually had one time uh somebody
[52:00] added to the bottom of this uh a brother
[52:03] I met in Florida one time he come and
[52:04] ministered for us I actually actually
[52:07] probably about the one time I actually
[52:09] had to tell a minister and get up behind
[52:11] the pull pit and say I disagree with him
[52:13] I think that's like uh uh it was it was
[52:16] a major enough disagreement I felt in my
[52:19] heart that I actually told the
[52:20] congregation I disagree with the brother
[52:22] on this he actually added something down
[52:24] here and I I I just God bless him uh if
[52:29] that's how he feels and just I mean
[52:31] maybe the Lord reveals to me that at
[52:33] some time but I I just like to leave it
[52:35] the way it the way it was brought to us
[52:37] by the prophet the way that we see it in
[52:40] the scripture so you may see so you may
[52:43] see tons of variances of if you type in
[52:46] Google statue of a perfect man pyramid
[52:48] or something like that you'll see all
[52:49] kinds of different ones and and that's
[52:52] okay that that that's that's up to them
[52:54] I just like to keep it simple just as
[52:56] the spiritual growth that we know that
[52:58] this scripture is speaking to us as and
[53:01] and in that is contained um what we
[53:04] believe to be true now some people
[53:06] believe that the only way to get up here
[53:09] is to is to have the only way to get the
[53:11] Holy Ghost is every one of these has to
[53:14] be perfected in your life uh I don't
[53:17] personally believe it that way I I
[53:19] personally believe that you can't get
[53:21] any of these perfected in your life
[53:23] until you're born
[53:24] again it to me is the holy ghost that
[53:27] helps bring them now now different
[53:30] anybody really anybody in the world not
[53:33] even a Christian can have faith uh some
[53:36] portion of Faith some Measure of Faith
[53:38] any actually the Bible says every man's
[53:40] dealt The Measure of Faith amen or or
[53:44] patience uh there there's plenty of
[53:46] people out there that have tons of
[53:47] patience probably have a lot more than I
[53:49] do amen as a born again Christian
[53:51] probably have a lot more than any of us
[53:53] or or the temperance or any of these
[53:57] virtues anybody can possess any portion
[54:00] of these virtues at any time that
[54:02] doesn't make them a Christian that
[54:04] doesn't make them in that statue of form
[54:07] of God or the perfect man amen we know
[54:10] brother Ram talked about the kindly old
[54:13] priest could manifest the gifts uh a
[54:16] whole lot more than even Jesus did uh if
[54:19] you look at it in the flesh look at it
[54:21] in the natural so anybody can possess
[54:23] any of these at any time but the growth
[54:26] of Christian begins with a foundation
[54:30] that Foundation is the faith the faith
[54:32] is our foundation and it grows from
[54:34] there so as we continue to add we
[54:37] continue to grow we continue to come
[54:40] become more in the likeness of Jesus
[54:42] Christ until we reach that Capstone
[54:45] which is love which is God which is
[54:47] Jesus Christ Christ is love amen brings
[54:51] us to that place amen that Capstone but
[54:55] let's look at the script scripture a
[54:56] little bit before we start in on on this
[54:59] statue here I want us to look at this
[55:02] because I I I've just give you some
[55:04] things I want to look at the scripture
[55:06] to help understand
[55:09] maybe to a degree why I I don't just try
[55:13] to come up with things that that I feel
[55:15] now I know the Lord has given me things
[55:18] and of course uh I believe uh I trust
[55:21] that to be from the Lord when I know
[55:23] it's the Lord doing it uh but uh I also
[55:27] believe that uh if I feel the Lord's
[55:31] given me something I like to go find it
[55:32] in the scripture right I like to check
[55:34] it with the L with the word I like to
[55:36] check it with the message I like to see
[55:38] if this is something because you know
[55:40] the devil talks too and we as Christians
[55:44] should be mature enough now to know when
[55:47] it's one voice or the other we should if
[55:49] we're not friends we need to really be
[55:52] in more prayer uh to listen to that
[55:55] voice more because we should know when
[55:57] it's the voice of God and when it's the
[55:59] voice of the devil first of all we
[56:00] should know based on the fact that if
[56:03] it's a voice of God it's going to be
[56:05] scriptural if it's the voice of the
[56:07] devil it's not now it might be 90%
[56:11] scripture it might be scripture just
[56:14] like Satan uh told Jesus on the Mount of
[56:18] Temptation uh when when Satan gave Jesus
[56:22] the word but the word was misplaced it
[56:25] was misused so see we should be uh
[56:29] adults enough
[56:30] Christians uh to be able to know which
[56:32] is which we should be if not we we need
[56:35] to be in Greater bore of prayer with the
[56:38] Lord so we recognize it's the Lord's
[56:40] voice but beyond that we like to make
[56:43] sure I like to make sure and check it
[56:45] with the word what does the word say
[56:48] about that so when I make my comments
[56:50] when I talk about uh this and the
[56:54] variances that people have put on it and
[56:56] the different ways that people that men
[56:58] have preached about it and and uh uh
[57:01] drew it in different ways and added
[57:03] things to it uh you that's okay but
[57:07] again I like to do it based on what I
[57:10] feel led to do that I find from the
[57:13] scripture amen so let's go back to the
[57:15] scripture real quick and and and we'll
[57:18] instead of just reading through break
[57:20] this down a little bit okay so Simon
[57:23] Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus
[57:25] Christ and them that have a Ain to them
[57:27] that obtain like Precious Faith so is
[57:29] that does that
[57:30] me is that you amen amen then then
[57:36] that's our name is right there so you
[57:38] could say uh to Newton that has obtained
[57:42] like Precious Faith to Dennis that has
[57:44] obtained like Precious Faith to Julie
[57:47] that is a me put your name there yes to
[57:50] us to me that has attained like Precious
[57:52] faith it pertains to me with us through
[57:56] the righteousness of God and our Savior
[57:58] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[58:00] multiplied unto you through the
[58:02] knowledge of God and Jesus our lord now
[58:06] he mentioned the word knowledge uh
[58:09] several times here and it is obviously a
[58:12] part of our stature here too uh through
[58:15] the knowledge of God and Jesus our
[58:18] lord according as his divine power God's
[58:22] divine power has given unto us Newton
[58:27] again put your name there he has given
[58:30] unto me us all things he's left nothing
[58:35] out but he's given unto us so if we look
[58:39] at what the scripture says what the
[58:42] prophet brought to us and we apply it as
[58:46] such there's nothing else we need so
[58:49] people can add and change and manipulate
[58:52] all they want and that's up to them and
[58:54] that's fine again I'm not criticizing
[58:56] that but we know the scripture here
[58:58] tells us that in this we have all
[59:02] things there's nothing likeing through
[59:05] God's power he's given unto us all
[59:09] things that pertain unto life and
[59:13] godliness amen so everything we need in
[59:16] life everything we need as a Christian
[59:20] for
[59:21] godliness God has given us through his
[59:24] power amen
[59:26] amen through the knowledge of
[59:30] him God Jesus Christ that has called us
[59:33] me again your name to glory and virtue
[59:38] now look at this
[59:40] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[59:44] great and precious promises now there's
[59:48] there's so many great and precious
[59:51] promises that are listed in the
[59:53] scripture that belong to us it was would
[59:56] take months to list them all or to
[59:58] preach on them all amen we know as Bible
[1:00:02] readers we know as Christian Bible
[1:00:04] readers we know what many if not all
[1:00:07] those promises are we can't recall them
[1:00:09] all obviously but the but the spirit of
[1:00:12] God has given us those
[1:00:15] promises has given us those great and
[1:00:18] precious promises that by these by those
[1:00:22] promises one the number one number one
[1:00:25] most prominent promise is
[1:00:28] what the promise of the Holy Spirit yes
[1:00:31] the promise of the holy spirit that was
[1:00:34] given to us is the token that we need
[1:00:37] first of all to live our lives by and to
[1:00:41] get out of this world in a Rapture
[1:00:44] that's our token that's our ticket amen
[1:00:47] those great and precious promises that
[1:00:49] we might be partakers of the divine
[1:00:53] nature that divine nature is the nature
[1:00:55] of God right amen and your nature that
[1:00:58] your nature is what identifies you

[1:01:04] identification the nature of a tree is

[1:01:10] plant is identified in its flower its
[1:01:12] Bloom the nature of an animal is is
[1:01:16] identified in its
[1:01:17] characteristics the identification of
[1:01:20] our divine nature of a human is how we
[1:01:23] act how we talk how we live how we uh uh
[1:01:26] breathe everything about us our divine
[1:01:29] nature how we live our lives either
[1:01:33] projects Jesus Christ or or something
[1:01:37] else amen a lot of times ourselves are
[1:01:40] an evil nature but the divine nature is
[1:01:43] the ultimate that we are that we are to
[1:01:46] attain the divine nature to break it
[1:01:48] down is just the Holy Ghost thank you
[1:01:50] Lord that God's divine nature because
[1:01:53] the Holy Ghost is what identifies
[1:01:56] Jesus Christ in the spirit when he was
[1:01:59] here the life he lived the things he did
[1:02:01] the places he went the how he T how he
[1:02:04] act his preaching his ministering his

[1:02:18] given those great precious promises
[1:02:22] those promises that we might be
[1:02:24] partakers of the Divine nature now it
[1:02:27] does not say anywhere that I found that
[1:02:30] you've got to attain the Perfection of
[1:02:32] every one of these levels to get that
[1:02:35] that's not what it says it says by the
[1:02:38] power of God we've been given these

[1:02:44] the Holy Ghost Amen in the Holy Ghost we

[1:02:56] got to do this to get him uh I'm sorry

[1:03:05] opinion really actually it's what the
[1:03:08] scripture says amen the scripture says
[1:03:11] by his Divine Promises by his precious
[1:03:14] promises we might be partakers of the
[1:03:18] Holy Ghost of his divine nature having

[1:03:45] our home we we are sojourners here yes
[1:03:49] this is this this Cosmos now the world

[1:05:09] a lump on a log and not try to do
[1:05:11] anything I try to but uh and help people
[1:05:15] along the way but the truth is when it
[1:05:18] boils down to it it's not ours anyway

[1:05:31] Jesus Christ and don't go to hell I hope
[1:05:33] I pray every one of them every one of
[1:05:36] those I want them to I don't want
[1:05:39] anybody to go to hell right no one
[1:05:42] unfortunately there's going to be
[1:05:45] because the scripture says there is but
[1:05:48] uh I pray they don't but we as
[1:05:52] Christians have escaped the world amen
[1:05:56] escape the corruption of the World by
[1:05:58] the Holy Spirit the holy spirit in being
[1:06:01] born again Drew you out and put you it
[1:06:05] doesn't make us more important it
[1:06:07] doesn't make us special it doesn't make
[1:06:09] us to look down on people not even close
[1:06:12] if not for the grace of God there go I
[1:06:16] amen but what it does is it puts us in a
[1:06:19] position in an exalted position
[1:06:22] spiritually in the mind in the eyes of
[1:06:24] God almighty yeah amen that Holy Spirit
[1:06:27] pulled us out and made made you a new
[1:06:30] creature in Christ Jesus only people
[1:06:34] that are members of that club if you
[1:06:36] will pardon the crude expression but
[1:06:39] only ones that are members of that club
[1:06:41] are the also the other people that have
[1:06:43] been born again and received that divine
[1:06:46] nature right amen all that being said
[1:06:49] now look at this all that being said we
[1:06:53] are partakers of the Divine nature look
[1:06:56] at this
[1:06:58] now that we have escaped the world
[1:07:00] through lust but now look what the fifth
[1:07:02] verse
[1:07:03] says and beside
[1:07:07] this amen he just give us all that we
[1:07:11] just went through all that now beside
[1:07:14] this now what does that mean that means
[1:07:17] that means okay we did this now uh while
[1:07:22] this just came in my mind let's just let
[1:07:24] let's just think about a meal
[1:07:28] uh if you've got a meal I'm a meat and
[1:07:31] potatoes guy most people probably know
[1:07:33] that by now but uh if you got a steak
[1:07:36] and you got a potato and you got a salad
[1:07:40] you eat the steak you got steak you're
[1:07:42] eating amen but there's other food
[1:07:46] besides that yeah amen so when you most
[1:07:51] people I mean maybe different people eat
[1:07:53] differently but most people people or I
[1:07:56] will take a bite of steak and I'll eat
[1:07:58] my steak and then I'll set my steak
[1:08:01] aside not literally but I won't eat
[1:08:04] another bite of steak I'll go to my
[1:08:06] potato and now eat on my potato I'm not
[1:08:09] eating my steak anymore I'm eating my
[1:08:12] potato beside the steak I have a potato
[1:08:16] besides my potato I have a
[1:08:18] salad you understand so when it's saying
[1:08:21] that we've got all of this the the the
[1:08:24] the Holy Spirit the Aker of God's divine
[1:08:27] nature now he says beside this okay
[1:08:31] that's been settled that's been done
[1:08:34] that finishes that you're a partaker of
[1:08:36] God's divine nature now beside
[1:08:40] that what do we do besides that we add
[1:08:46] we add virtue to our faith we start with
[1:08:50] faith amen you understand does that make
[1:08:53] sense yeah yeah besides that not it
[1:08:56] doesn't say that you have to have the
[1:08:58] Holy Ghost you can only get the Holy
[1:09:00] Ghost after this it says you've been a
[1:09:04] partaker of the Holy Ghost and now
[1:09:07] beside the Holy Ghost you need to do
[1:09:10] this you've been born again you have the
[1:09:13] Holy Ghost you're a Christian have been
[1:09:15] born again now now you've got that now
[1:09:18] let's go and and let's let's work on our
[1:09:20] spiritual growth yes not the other way
[1:09:23] around amen a lot of you want to work on
[1:09:26] your spiritual growth to the point of
[1:09:28] having the Holy Ghost no you get the
[1:09:30] Holy Ghost you're born again and then
[1:09:32] you work on your spiritual growth right
[1:09:36] amen besides
[1:09:39] this praise the Lord you've got that
[1:09:42] that's been established and and and uh
[1:09:45] been made known now beside that now what
[1:09:48] do we do now we get to actually growing
[1:09:50] in the
[1:09:52] Lord we got the Holy Ghost now it's time
[1:09:55] to grow in the Lord the holy spirit is
[1:09:58] just the beginning point the divine
[1:10:01] nature is just our starting point you're
[1:10:03] just a babe in Christ you're a newborn
[1:10:06] creature in Christ at that point now we
[1:10:09] need to start growing
[1:10:12] right now we get to our statue of a
[1:10:15] perfect man and it says fifth verse
[1:10:18] besides
[1:10:19] this so so my point is I guess I
[1:10:23] hammered that a
[1:10:24] little to to get to the point to
[1:10:27] understand I try not to just make stuff
[1:10:31] up I I don't just say well the lord gave
[1:10:35] me this I I want something concrete
[1:10:37] something before I dismissed
[1:10:40] a probably tens of thousands of people's
[1:10:44] belief in this I want to know why what
[1:10:48] scripture basis do I
[1:10:50] have it's right here am amen it's right
[1:10:54] here you're a partaker of the divine
[1:10:57] nature you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:00] besides that now that's just the
[1:11:02] beginning you start and you start
[1:11:05] growing amen that's why I base it that
[1:11:08] way not because I'm just arrogant and
[1:11:10] say well why just don't believe that
[1:11:12] brother no no no I don't want to dismiss
[1:11:14] someone who might have a legitimate
[1:11:17] thought or belief but if it's not
[1:11:20] scriptural friend I I I'm not going to
[1:11:23] go with it if it's if you can't back it
[1:11:27] up by scripture I don't care what Vision
[1:11:29] anybody had I don't care
[1:11:34] about Flames going off and videos I I
[1:11:38] don't I don't care about all the people
[1:11:41] have uh uh uh the founder of the Mormon
[1:11:45] denomination had a dream the the whole
[1:11:47] denomination is based on the man's dream
[1:11:51] right amen amen I probably wouldn't say
[1:11:55] say this if Gilson was here but pretty
[1:11:58] much the entire Muslim religion is based
[1:12:00] on a man's
[1:12:03] dream I I don't I don't base it on
[1:12:06] brother bram's dream or anybody's dream
[1:12:09] I don't base what I believe on anybody's
[1:12:11] dream anybody's uh uh uh a prophecy or
[1:12:14] any I don't base what I believe on any
[1:12:16] of that I believe I base what I believe
[1:12:18] on the scripture and if I can't find it
[1:12:21] in here then I'm not going to believe it
[1:12:24] I'm not going to preach
[1:12:27] amen not even if brother Brown said it
[1:12:30] I'm not going to now I've never found
[1:12:32] anything that he said that wasn't in
[1:12:34] there so I got to have a little caveat
[1:12:36] to that and all the preaching I've done
[1:12:39] for 35 years I've never found one time
[1:12:41] where what he said wasn't in here but if
[1:12:44] it wasn't I wouldn't believe it I
[1:12:47] wouldn't preach it I don't care about
[1:12:48] anybody's dream I don't care any of that
[1:12:50] people base religions and stuff and and
[1:12:53] experiences all they had this great
[1:12:55] experience and this is what they come up
[1:12:57] with that you got to if it's not
[1:13:00] scriptural leave it alone amen leave it
[1:13:04] alone now look let's let's start with
[1:13:06] this besides this give all diligence now
[1:13:10] that's a powerful word amen give all
[1:13:13] haste give all expedience amen all work
[1:13:17] all effort diligence give all
[1:13:20] diligence to uh to to add to your faith
[1:13:24] virt now we got faith faith Faith's a
[1:13:27] pretty easy one amen but it's also a
[1:13:30] very encompassing one let's go over to
[1:13:32] Matthew uh Hebrews chapter 11 I'm going
[1:13:35] to look at doing going through scripture
[1:13:38] uh maybe some quotes uh to to bring each
[1:13:41] one of these points hopefully maybe a a
[1:13:44] little light a little more light on
[1:13:47] them faith is something that we probably
[1:13:51] all already are very astute in and
[1:13:54] believe in look to but um let's start
[1:13:57] with Hebrews chapter 11 the faith
[1:13:59] chapter
[1:14:01] amen Hebrews chapter 11 verse1 now Faith
[1:14:05] is the substance of things hoped for
[1:14:10] it's the
[1:14:11] substance in other words it's something
[1:14:13] tangible yes faith is something that is
[1:14:17] tangible you say well Faith you can't
[1:14:21] buy it at the store you can't touch it
[1:14:24] you can't smell it you can't eat it how
[1:14:28] is it tangible because Faith brings the
[1:14:32] things that are not into existence right
[1:14:36] faith is what does it faith is the
[1:14:40] substance of things hoped for it is an
[1:14:43] Evidence of Things Not Seen well now how
[1:14:46] can you have evidence if it's not
[1:14:49] tangible amen you go try to you go try
[1:14:52] to prove in a court and present present
[1:14:55] evidence that didn't exist tangibly you
[1:14:57] can't see it can't smell it can't taste
[1:15:00] it can't hear it how you going to
[1:15:02] present that as evidence in a court of
[1:15:05] law you can right that's not evidence
[1:15:09] your honor I believe it is that doesn't
[1:15:12] make it so right right not in the court
[1:15:14] of law right amen it might make it so to
[1:15:17] you but it doesn't make it so period or
[1:15:21] in a court of law you can't use it as
[1:15:23] evidence you have to have something
[1:15:25] tangible faith is an Evidence faith is a
[1:15:30] substance and that faith is is things
[1:15:33] that we cannot see that is made tangible
[1:15:38] we had a lot of testimonies in here last
[1:15:40] week things that were not tangible Faith
[1:15:44] made them tangible Faith brought them to
[1:15:47] the point of testimony to the point of
[1:15:49] saying God healed me God performed a
[1:15:53] miracle in my life God did this for me
[1:15:56] it wasn't there but now it is am now
[1:16:00] it's
[1:16:01] evidence praise God you could go to a
[1:16:04] doctor and the doctor say you're ridd
[1:16:07] with cancer and you can come forth and
[1:16:09] be prayed for and God can miraculous
[1:16:12] miraculously heal you a miracle you go
[1:16:15] back to the doctor and the doctor looks
[1:16:18] at him and says there's no more cancer
[1:16:21] in your body I don't know where it went
[1:16:23] and you can tell him I do
[1:16:26] I know where it went do you want to know
[1:16:28] where it went I'll tell you where it
[1:16:31] went amen my my wife had the thing same
[1:16:34] thing happened to her when she cut the
[1:16:36] tentant in her foot I'm not going to
[1:16:38] tell the whole story but when she went
[1:16:40] back to the doctor after God healed her
[1:16:42] we laid hands on her and prayed for her
[1:16:44] and God healed her she went back to the
[1:16:46] doctor the doctor looked at her foot and
[1:16:49] he he had this and I wasn't there but
[1:16:51] just by her original testimony I I'll
[1:16:53] never forget this but from 30 years ago
[1:16:57] looks at her and says stand up cuz she
[1:17:00] she's sitting in the chair and he's got
[1:17:03] her got foot and the doctor's looking at
[1:17:04] her foot says stand up stands up walk
[1:17:07] around a while walk around a little bit
[1:17:09] and I may get some of this wrong dude
[1:17:11] I'm sorry but I tried to my best to
[1:17:13] remember walk around hop jump skip run
[1:17:16] in place whatever you can do just to
[1:17:19] aggravate that tendon what can I do to
[1:17:21] aggravate that tendon you know now sit
[1:17:25] back down sit back down we have the foot
[1:17:27] to the doctor doctor looks at her foot
[1:17:29] again and says Miss Bennett I don't know
[1:17:31] what happened to you but you have a
[1:17:33] brand new tendon in your
[1:17:35] foot now you explain that right before
[1:17:41] it wasn't
[1:17:43] tangible but when prayer and
[1:17:45] intercession entered in and God
[1:17:48] performed a miracle in her foot he she
[1:17:51] could go back to the doctor and the
[1:17:53] doctor could identify that there's
[1:17:55] something there that wasn't there
[1:17:57] before praise God faith did it Faith
[1:18:02] brought a substance Faith had an
[1:18:04] Evidence and the evidence witness to
[1:18:06] that doctor now whatever he did with it
[1:18:08] we don't
[1:18:09] know but that man could never the rest
[1:18:12] of his life deny what happened to my
[1:18:15] wife he knows and has X-rays of a split
[1:18:19] tendon and it was rolling up in her foot
[1:18:21] she had knots on both tops and bottles
[1:18:23] of that cup
[1:18:25] gone foot straight everything
[1:18:28] perfect he has to understand and witness
[1:18:32] that what was before is not
[1:18:36] now God it became evidence yes the
[1:18:40] evidence in a court would say but your
[1:18:42] honor my foot is perfectly well and the
[1:18:46] and the judge can say oh no your foot is
[1:18:48] cut then you could bring it and said
[1:18:50] Doctor is her foot cut is her tendon cut
[1:18:54] your honor I've got evidence and proof I
[1:18:58] got an x-ray to prove that her tendon is
[1:19:01] perfectly
[1:19:03] fine his testimony brand new tendon in
[1:19:07] your foot praise the Lord Faith brought
[1:19:11] it to pass Faith made it so it wasn't
[1:19:15] one way now it is praise God that's why
[1:19:19] we can say faith is a substance amen
[1:19:23] faith is an Evidence evidence it's an
[1:19:26] Evidence of things that can't be seen
[1:19:28] but it's an evidence that we know and
[1:19:30] believe that it's there yes people can
[1:19:33] say well you're still sick doesn't
[1:19:35] matter God's word said I'm
[1:19:37] well amen evidence can say I still have
[1:19:41] blurry eyesight but God's word says I'm
[1:19:44] Healed right yes praise the Lord glasses
[1:19:47] are not the word says I'm Healed and
[1:19:49] that's what matters praise the Lord
[1:19:52] Jesus we believe what faith says and
[1:19:57] faith says by these great and precious
[1:20:00] promises that you are well that you are
[1:20:02] healed that you are blessed that you are
[1:20:04] all the great blessings God gives us
[1:20:08] it's an evidence for by it for by faith
[1:20:12] second verse
[1:20:14] Now by faith the elders obtained a good
[1:20:18] report now how about us how about the
[1:20:20] young on the elders obtained a good
[1:20:23] report what about the young
[1:20:26] I'm a
[1:20:27] young the did the youngans have a good
[1:20:30] report do do we have obtained a good
[1:20:34] report by the same faith that the elders
[1:20:37] did yes praise God I believe so I think
[1:20:42] a lot of times it kind of gets
[1:20:43] overlooked maybe dismissed a little bit
[1:20:46] unless it's something just outstanding
[1:20:48] but it's like I said the other day how
[1:20:50] many things that God does for us every
[1:20:54] day most of which we probably never even
[1:20:57] know
[1:20:59] amen but we give him thanks for it
[1:21:02] anyway we give him thanks anyway the
[1:21:05] elders obtained a good report by faith
[1:21:08] through faith third
[1:21:10] verse through faith we understand that
[1:21:14] the worlds were framed by the word of
[1:21:17] God so that the things which are seen
[1:21:21] were not made of things which do appear
[1:21:25] in other words through faith God spoke
[1:21:30] and brother B said God had to believe
[1:21:32] his own word yes for it to come to pass
[1:21:37] praise God he's the father of faith we
[1:21:39] believe that's where we get our faith by
[1:21:41] faith we believe God
[1:21:44] spoke and he believed through faith now
[1:21:48] you can you could say well uh how can
[1:21:51] God why would God need Faith well he is
[1:21:54] faith yeah you don't say well God needs
[1:21:57] love no he doesn't he is
[1:21:59] love say God needs Faith No he is Faith
[1:22:03] praise the Lord that's where we get our
[1:22:05] faith amen but in that he believed when
[1:22:09] he spoke he believed when he said let
[1:22:12] there be he knew that it would be now
[1:22:15] brother R said it may have been 10,000
[1:22:18] years but it was going to happen it
[1:22:20] happened yeah amen when God said let
[1:22:22] there be now I know when he when he when
[1:22:26] he uh made the Earth in the way it is
[1:22:30] today with the plants the bot life
[1:22:32] animal life and the forming of all I
[1:22:34] know that took the six days seventh day
[1:22:37] rested but when God in the beginning in
[1:22:40] in the beginning Genesis 1:1 says in the
[1:22:44] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:22:46] Earth that was it yeah amen amen now how
[1:22:50] long it took to do that we don't know
[1:22:52] right we don't know wellam said it could
[1:22:55] have been 10 thousands of years could
[1:22:56] have been millions of years but when he
[1:22:58] said God created the Heaven and the
[1:23:00] Earth yes well then the six days he
[1:23:03] started doing the firmament in the
[1:23:04] heavens and then the earth and the
[1:23:06] oceans and the fish and the botney life
[1:23:08] and the human life that's all that came
[1:23:11] afterwards but when God created the
[1:23:13] Heaven and the Earth brother R said that
[1:23:15] could have been millions of years we
[1:23:16] don't know but when God spoke it was
[1:23:19] going to happen amen and by faith it
[1:23:24] came in de be there was a there was no
[1:23:29] tree God spoke and botney life came and
[1:23:32] now there's a
[1:23:34] tree amen amen tree came from nothing
[1:23:38] it's like brother random said science
[1:23:39] says that they are the ones that you
[1:23:41] live by that you go by that you believe
[1:23:43] in science is the one he said well um
[1:23:46] they can they can manipulate this and
[1:23:48] they can create that and they can cause
[1:23:50] this reaction to happen this and all
[1:23:52] this by their limited understanding of
[1:23:54] physics and and uh and Science and all
[1:23:58] that they do and I probably sound like
[1:24:00] an idiot because I don't know anything
[1:24:01] about it but all that they can explain
[1:24:04] and do and and create and and uh
[1:24:08] manipulate and atoms and all all the
[1:24:12] sciency stuff they can do all that but
[1:24:17] then you go up and get the Hawkins did
[1:24:20] now but get the most brilliant scientist
[1:24:23] the most brilliant this is whatever said
[1:24:26] now I want you to build me this blade of
[1:24:30] grass could he do it of course not amen
[1:24:36] because it took Faith to bring that
[1:24:37] blade of grass yeah amen now they can
[1:24:40] take the blade of grass and they can
[1:24:43] tear it down and they can find what all
[1:24:46] is in it and what it's made up of and
[1:24:48] how it reacts and all that they can
[1:24:50] figure all that stuff out but I want you
[1:24:52] to give me a blade of grass first
[1:24:54] right amen I think it's like
[1:24:59] uh I forgot the story but it's like you
[1:25:02] know well I can do this but give me some
[1:25:05] dirt no no you got to create your own
[1:25:07] dirt right well well how am I going to
[1:25:10] do that exactly yeah that's the whole
[1:25:12] point by faith through faith the worlds
[1:25:17] were framed by the word of God God said
[1:25:20] let there be it was so which things so
[1:25:23] so the things that we see now were not
[1:25:27] made by things which do appear what were
[1:25:29] they made by
[1:25:31] faith faith in the word that was spoken
[1:25:34] the spoken word faith and belief in the
[1:25:37] spoken word that's what brought it to
[1:25:40] pass God spake God spoke it let there be
[1:25:43] a tree that tree came there it is yes
[1:25:46] amen amen people have been arguing
[1:25:49] scientist been arguing for years and
[1:25:51] years and eons and eons which came first
[1:25:54] the chicken or the
[1:25:55] egg I
[1:25:57] know I'm as dumb as a rock bag of rocks
[1:26:00] but I know where it came from right amen
[1:26:04] the chicken cuz God said let there be a
[1:26:07] chicken there was a chicken in that
[1:26:09] chicken was all it needed to reproduce
[1:26:11] there come the
[1:26:12] eggs amen chicken came first which came
[1:26:16] first the tree of the pinecomb the tree
[1:26:18] came first cuz you can't have a pine
[1:26:20] cone without the tree right the tree
[1:26:23] came first
[1:26:25] Common Sense yes but all people that
[1:26:28] make millions of dollars a year can
[1:26:29] figure that out why because they don't
[1:26:31] know God when you know God you know the
[1:26:34] answer right right there came a tree so
[1:26:37] the thing that did not exist brought the
[1:26:40] tree in into existence now from that
[1:26:43] tree you can make this pull
[1:26:47] pit amen now what you
[1:26:50] see didn't come from something that you
[1:26:52] saw it came from something that was
[1:26:55] unseen so it came from that tree where
[1:26:57] did the tree come
[1:26:59] from well it came from this tree it came
[1:27:01] from this tree you're going to trace it
[1:27:03] back so far that it's going to get to
[1:27:05] the point that it came from when God
[1:27:08] said let there be yes there's the tree
[1:27:12] from that tree come another tree from
[1:27:15] that tree come another another another
[1:27:16] another another finally from that
[1:27:19] original tree where God spoken and that
[1:27:21] tree was there came a tree that made
[1:27:23] this B now you can see it it's an
[1:27:26] Evidence I can touch this I can bang on
[1:27:30] it I can feel it don't necessarily want
[1:27:32] to taste it but I can see it right I can
[1:27:35] feel it amen it's tangible Faith brought
[1:27:39] this into a
[1:27:41] substance now it's an Evidence this pull
[1:27:45] pit is here here it is but it didn't
[1:27:49] come from something you could see it
[1:27:50] came from Faith believe God had to
[1:27:54] believe amen and there it came so now
[1:27:59] the things that were that uh the the
[1:28:01] faith that we understand the worlds were
[1:28:03] framed by the word of God so that the
[1:28:05] things which are
[1:28:08] seen were not made of things which do
[1:28:11] appear amen faith
[1:28:14] God fourth verse by faith Abel offered
[1:28:18] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:28:20] Cain what is uh faith faith is a
[1:28:26] revelation faith is a revelation that
[1:28:29] Abel had that he believed in God that
[1:28:34] regardless of
[1:28:35] what the circumstances may show he
[1:28:39] knew amen probably from Adam his daddy
[1:28:43] told him that it took blood to be
[1:28:47] pleasing to the Lord right because that
[1:28:50] was what God did Adam didn't do that God
[1:28:52] did that
[1:28:54] amen Cain didn't do that but Abel did it
[1:28:58] why did Abel do it because Adam was his
[1:29:00] daddy Cain didn't do it why because Adam
[1:29:04] is not Cain's
[1:29:06] daddy amen I I now I believe when both
[1:29:10] boys came forth that Adam probably
[1:29:13] treated them both like his boys he knew
[1:29:16] they
[1:29:17] weren't I'm sorry I maybe I'm adding but
[1:29:21] I can't believe that would have pushed
[1:29:25] Cain away and just Tau a Abel right amen
[1:29:29] I believe he called him to both but see
[1:29:31] the problem was Kain didn't have a
[1:29:33] revelation he had nothing in him to
[1:29:36] receive Revelation from God yes because
[1:29:39] he was of the serpent the evil one he
[1:29:41] was the Bible says he was of that evil
[1:29:43] one the devil amen of the serpent seed
[1:29:47] he was not from the lineage of Adam
[1:29:50] right not being from the lineage of Adam
[1:29:53] which is the lineage of God he had
[1:29:55] nothing in him to receive
[1:29:58] Revelation unfortunately Saints
[1:30:01] unfortunately there are millions maybe
[1:30:05] even billions of people in the world
[1:30:07] today that still have no representation
[1:30:12] right they have nothing in them to be
[1:30:14] able to receive Revelation from God even
[1:30:18] if God were to come and show it to them
[1:30:20] right in their faces they would not
[1:30:23] believe it right yeah because from God
[1:30:26] it has to be revealed it has to be
[1:30:29] revealed from God not just a simple
[1:30:31] understanding not a scientific belief
[1:30:33] not some kind of proof or experiment has
[1:30:36] to be Revelation by faith faith is a
[1:30:40] revelation by faith Abel offered unto
[1:30:43] God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain
[1:30:45] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:30:48] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:30:50] and by it being dead yet speaking by
[1:30:55] Revelation Abel maybe Abel and Cain
[1:30:58] received the same
[1:31:00] information obtained the same story from
[1:31:03] Adam but
[1:31:05] God Abel by God's revelation knew what
[1:31:09] it took it took blood Cain did not Cain
[1:31:12] thought Cain thought like a lot of
[1:31:14] people do today shall I say a lot of
[1:31:17] Christians do today oh this would be
[1:31:19] good enough for
[1:31:21] God a this I I'll just give him some of
[1:31:24] my fruits I'll give him actually I'll
[1:31:26] give him the best fruits I got I'll give
[1:31:29] him the best bought me life that I've
[1:31:31] raised and that I've nurtured and and
[1:31:33] I've that I've harvested I'll give him
[1:31:37] the very best I got I believe Cain did
[1:31:39] give him the very
[1:31:41] best but his best wasn't good enough
[1:31:44] because it wasn't by
[1:31:46] Revelation by revelation God was
[1:31:49] accepting as a sacrifice a blood
[1:31:51] sacrifice and bought me life does not
[1:31:54] carry blood right amen so Cain had no
[1:31:58] Revelation Abel did Cain got mad at him
[1:32:00] and killed his brother as a result even
[1:32:03] after God told him I'll give I will I
[1:32:06] will accept you if you just do right
[1:32:09] right but he couldn't why couldn't he
[1:32:10] because it wasn't in him to
[1:32:12] do that's my whole point today yeah a
[1:32:16] lot of times I get so frustrated
[1:32:18] sometimes it's so
[1:32:20] hard I I told y'all the other day that
[1:32:24] I made the comment the week before last
[1:32:27] about um one of our workers he smokes he
[1:32:31] drinks a lot energy drinks and he's not
[1:32:34] going to live to be 40 and he's only and
[1:32:36] he's
[1:32:37] 35 the poor guy I
[1:32:40] mean I think I told you that the manager
[1:32:43] said something about because the
[1:32:45] cigarettes were Cheaper by the carton or
[1:32:47] something in Georgia and he said
[1:32:50] something about uh well Newton will take
[1:32:53] something for you he's a minister nobody
[1:32:55] will pay attention I'm like I'm not
[1:32:57] taking you one cigarette mostel carton
[1:33:00] I'm not taking you anything like that
[1:33:03] and I said I'll you know I told you I to
[1:33:05] comeing I said I'll take you a gun which
[1:33:07] is basically the same thing and this
[1:33:11] time when we met up uh he's my travel
[1:33:14] partner he actually lives right here in
[1:33:16] town and I said I hope you weren't
[1:33:18] offended by that he said oh no no I said
[1:33:21] I just want you to understand I care
[1:33:22] about you and I see that you're killing
[1:33:24] yourself yeah and I hate to watch you
[1:33:27] kill yourself yeah that that was my
[1:33:29] whole point he just said I understand
[1:33:32] didn't change anything but I wanted to
[1:33:36] understand I I these things come because
[1:33:39] I care about you not because I don't
[1:33:40] like you I'm not trying to be uh cynical
[1:33:43] or or hateful I want you to understand
[1:33:46] I'm trying to tell you the truth so you
[1:33:47] quit killing yourself right amen anyway
[1:33:52] that but but but again outside of that
[1:33:55] if he has nothing in him to receive
[1:33:59] it he's just going to be what he is
[1:34:02] people are just going to be what they
[1:34:05] are if there's that if there's nothing
[1:34:09] in there for them then that's just all
[1:34:10] they can be so anyway it's a hard one
[1:34:13] for me to grasp but it's just the way it
[1:34:15] is fifth verse by faith I better hurry
[1:34:18] we'll never get off Faith by faith Enoch
[1:34:22] was translated that he should not see
[1:34:25] death and was not found because God had
[1:34:28] translated him for before his
[1:34:31] translation he had this testimony that
[1:34:34] he pleased God how did he please God
[1:34:36] same way he was translated by faith amen
[1:34:40] he pleased God by Faith said how can I
[1:34:42] please God by faith amen for sixth verse
[1:34:46] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:34:51] God Amen
[1:34:53] sixth verse but without faith it is
[1:34:56] impossible to please
[1:34:59] him with faith Revelation amen it brings
[1:35:03] you to an understanding what is pleasing
[1:35:06] to the Lord and what isn't what makes
[1:35:08] the Lord happy and what makes him upset
[1:35:11] amen praise the Lord for he that cometh
[1:35:14] to God must
[1:35:17] believe he that cometh to God Must
[1:35:21] Believe must believe that he is that God
[1:35:25] is and that God is a rewarder of them
[1:35:28] that diligently there's that word
[1:35:31] again diligently seek him now I'm not
[1:35:34] going to ask you to raise your hands but
[1:35:35] how many actually diligently seek
[1:35:39] God
[1:35:41] Amen that's personal between you and God
[1:35:45] like I said I'm not looking for hands
[1:35:46] raised I just want an interior
[1:35:49] examination of yourself to say where do
[1:35:52] I stand in this
[1:35:54] amen amen where am I placed in this
[1:35:58] scripture being diligent about seeking
[1:36:01] the Lord remember what the word diligent
[1:36:04] is amen Relentless pressing
[1:36:08] forward not stopping uh being diligent
[1:36:13] seek him that we seek Him by faith amen
[1:36:17] seventh verse
[1:36:18] Now by faith Noah being warned of God of
[1:36:22] these things not seen as yet moved with
[1:36:26] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[1:36:29] his house by the which he condemned the
[1:36:32] world and became heir of the
[1:36:34] righteousness which is by Faith by faith
[1:36:38] Abraham when he was called to go out
[1:36:41] into a place which he should after
[1:36:44] receive for inheritance obeyed and he
[1:36:46] went out not knowing where he
[1:36:50] went by faith he Ser uh so
[1:36:54] in the land of promise as in a strange
[1:36:56] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[1:36:59] Isaac and Jacob and HS with him of the
[1:37:02] same promise for he looked praise the
[1:37:06] Lord for he looked for a city which have
[1:37:10] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:37:13] God
[1:37:14] Amen I'm still looking for that myself
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:18] amen I'm still looking for that I
[1:37:21] believe we all are yes
[1:37:24] Builder and maker is God 11 verse
[1:37:26] through faith also Sarah herself
[1:37:29] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:37:31] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:37:34] past age because because she judged him
[1:37:38] God Faithful who had made the
[1:37:41] promise how about us do we find him
[1:37:46] faithful who's made all those great and
[1:37:49] precious promises that we just talked
[1:37:51] about do we find him faithful he made
[1:37:55] promises do we find him faithful to
[1:37:58] execute all of the promises that he
[1:38:00] promised to give us I mean I don't know
[1:38:03] how many times I've gotten promises from
[1:38:05] people that's never been kept yeah
[1:38:09] dozens hundreds I don't know from
[1:38:12] different people good good minded people
[1:38:14] good-hearted people I probably I I
[1:38:17] probably actually give more promises I
[1:38:19] weren't able to fulfill uh even to God
[1:38:23] uh then I've had promises broken to me
[1:38:27] so I'm as guilty as anybody but God
[1:38:30] never broke a promise never can never
[1:38:32] will can't do it amen amen we find him
[1:38:37] faithful that promised it he's the one
[1:38:39] that promised it we believe it therefore
[1:38:43] sprang there even one even of one in him
[1:38:47] and him as good as dead so many as the
[1:38:50] stars of the sky in multitude and as the
[1:38:53] sand which is by the seashore
[1:38:55] innumerable
[1:38:57] innumerable these all died in faith not
[1:39:00] having received the promises but having
[1:39:02] seen them AAR off and were persuaded of
[1:39:06] them and embraced them and confess that
[1:39:10] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:39:12] earth amen but they believed it how'
[1:39:14] they believe it they believed it by
[1:39:16] faith am praise the Lord let me read
[1:39:19] this to you this is out of statue of a
[1:39:22] perfect man
[1:39:30] see the world we've escaped that now
[1:39:33] we've escaped the world now he is
[1:39:35] addressing this to the
[1:39:37] church that's why we are here this
[1:39:39] morning to find out what is that way
[1:39:42] what is God's
[1:39:44] requirements there is not a person here
[1:39:47] it is now listen close I'm believing
[1:39:50] this identifies every one of us in here
[1:39:53] this morning there is not a person in
[1:39:56] here that loves God but that wants to
[1:40:00] become more like
[1:40:03] Christ I believe I pray that's every one
[1:40:06] of our desires amen that we all desire
[1:40:10] as it is witnessed that brother bam said
[1:40:13] that loves God that wants to be more
[1:40:16] like him amen amen help me to be more
[1:40:20] like him Lord help me to be more like
[1:40:22] you now it's laid out here every
[1:40:25] Christian I'm an old veteran look at
[1:40:27] brother and sister kid here they're
[1:40:29] probably oldest in the building I think
[1:40:31] they were in their 90s about that time
[1:40:34] oldest in the building but if I would
[1:40:36] ask them even them in their 90s if I
[1:40:40] would ask them what is your heart's
[1:40:42] desire it' be to be closer to
[1:40:44] God Amen you go ask other people think
[1:40:49] about it for a minute what if it was
[1:40:51] what if there was literally a genie that
[1:40:54] came out of a bottle when you rubbed it
[1:40:56] and he said you have three
[1:40:59] wishes I I I would
[1:41:02] imagine it'd be hard to imagine all the
[1:41:05] different wishes that people would come
[1:41:07] up
[1:41:08] with amen this is not obviously a witch
[1:41:12] this is a wish this is no Genie this is
[1:41:15] nothing magical this is God and His
[1:41:17] precious promises but just think about
[1:41:20] it if people had the opportunity ask for
[1:41:22] whatever you want itude wealth and
[1:41:24] riches Fame and and
[1:41:27] notoriety powerful president CW the
[1:41:31] whole
[1:41:32] world what would you be what would
[1:41:35] people
[1:41:36] say
[1:41:38] amen I remember one woman one time
[1:41:42] brother random called her Hatty
[1:41:44] right her last name actually wasn't
[1:41:46] right at the time it was something else
[1:41:48] and so people preached an entire
[1:41:51] messages on the fact that her name was
[1:41:53] Dy right and she was right actually her
[1:41:55] name at the time was not right you go
[1:41:57] and you read if you're reading the
[1:41:59] message enough I forgot what it was but
[1:42:01] if you go read the message enough you'll
[1:42:03] find out and note that wasn't her name
[1:42:06] at that time anyway but hady right was
[1:42:11] sitting there in a church service and
[1:42:14] brother Brandon was talking about the
[1:42:15] story faith of the squirrels that had
[1:42:19] come that that he was out hunting you
[1:42:22] know the story
[1:42:24] I'll be brief but he's sitting there and
[1:42:27] no squirrels but he needed food to feed
[1:42:29] his family and a voice spoke to him and
[1:42:32] says what do you hear for and of course
[1:42:34] you know when a voice speaks like that
[1:42:35] if you've ever heard that voice it's
[1:42:37] like who what what what was
[1:42:42] that somebody
[1:42:45] there you've ever heard it it's it's not
[1:42:48] like oh wow hi God how you
[1:42:51] doing it's it's not anybody does that to
[1:42:54] you they say God spoke to them like that
[1:42:57] an audible voice they like hey God
[1:42:58] what's up how you doing no no God didn't
[1:43:01] speak to that person right uhuh no it's
[1:43:05] like who is
[1:43:07] that what what's going on there's a
[1:43:11] there's a spirit there's an aura that
[1:43:13] comes with with God and it's not hi
[1:43:15] what's up God it's
[1:43:18] not right you say well me and God are
[1:43:20] tight might be but when that voice
[1:43:22] speaks is there's
[1:43:25] reverence amen there's there's a somber
[1:43:28] reverence there it's like brother Brown
[1:43:30] brother Billy Paul talked about the
[1:43:31] testimony when brother randam uh when
[1:43:34] God let brother random sh wake him up to
[1:43:36] see the angel of the Lord he woke him up
[1:43:39] with a pillow over his face and said now
[1:43:41] I want to tell you
[1:43:43] something he told me that you could see
[1:43:46] him he's standing over in the corner now
[1:43:48] don't be afraid and he slowly took the
[1:43:51] pillow off his eyes he looked up and he
[1:43:53] saw and that angel he said was standing
[1:43:55] in the corner with his arms folded like
[1:43:57] this right and there was no hey hey it's
[1:44:02] good to find uhuh there's none of that
[1:44:05] there was fear and
[1:44:07] reverence and that angel in an instant
[1:44:10] turned into a mist and went out the
[1:44:12] window or went out of the room just like
[1:44:15] there was there was no play When God
[1:44:19] speaks there there's there's there's no
[1:44:21] playe right amen
[1:44:23] but that when that voice
[1:44:25] speaks if God were to speak just think
[1:44:28] about
[1:44:31] that to to to speak to
[1:44:36] us what our desires would
[1:44:41] be what would we want from
[1:44:45] God had he was sitting there brother R
[1:44:47] was telling that
[1:44:51] story and there's probably obviously
[1:44:53] Skeptics in the congregation audience
[1:44:55] wherever he was I think he was at the
[1:44:57] Tabernacle
[1:44:59] but she sat there and she said that
[1:45:02] ain't nothing but the truth brother
[1:45:04] brandham and the spirit of the Lord
[1:45:07] spoke to brother brandham and said tell
[1:45:09] her she can have whatever she asked for
[1:45:12] she was a poor lady she had had all the
[1:45:15] money she wanted shackle for a house she
[1:45:17] had a brand new mansion car whatever she
[1:45:21] wanted whatever she she wants tell her
[1:45:24] she can have whatever she wants it
[1:45:27] didn't have anything to do with fame or
[1:45:29] money or popularity or substance or
[1:45:33] goodies or toys or she said I want the
[1:45:36] salvation of my two
[1:45:38] boys amen I don't care how those boys
[1:45:41] lived I don't care how they died they
[1:45:44] belong to her right they belong to God
[1:45:48] because the prophet said you have what
[1:45:50] you asked for now obviously I believe
[1:45:53] that God knew what she was going to ask
[1:45:56] it wasn't a rubber Genie bottle thing I
[1:45:59] believe he knew what she was going to
[1:46:01] ask and she said selfishly I want the
[1:46:04] salvation of my two
[1:46:06] boys amen but I wonder what would other
[1:46:09] people ask for right what would people
[1:46:12] want if they had the opportunity to get
[1:46:14] whatever they want brother Ram said I
[1:46:18] believe there's not anybody in here that
[1:46:20] loves God that if I ask you what you
[1:46:23] would want the number one desire in your
[1:46:25] heart it would be to be closer to God
[1:46:28] amen amen that's an admirable thing an
[1:46:33] admirable request a truth that we live
[1:46:37] let me read these couple more I think
[1:46:39] it's gotten wow I didn't get all Faith
[1:46:43] statue of a perfect man again he says
[1:46:45] God wants uh let me just drop down here
[1:46:48] now uh a holy God could not condone sin
[1:46:51] so nothing could touch that mountain
[1:46:54] where God was talking about Moses of
[1:46:56] course Mount Si then God was made flesh
[1:46:59] and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus
[1:47:01] Christ his son his creation then that
[1:47:05] son gave his life and the blood cell of
[1:47:08] God was broken that the life might come
[1:47:11] out of that blood to us the promise of
[1:47:15] the of the Holy Ghost the promise of a
[1:47:18] changed
[1:47:19] nature a partaker of the divine nature
[1:47:22] you know to be a partaker of the divine
[1:47:24] nature your Nature has to die yes right
[1:47:28] amen die burned out we've gone through
[1:47:30] it before that old snake nature die
[1:47:32] burned out Holy Spirit come in amen amen
[1:47:36] Holy Spirit must come in yes or the
[1:47:39] devil will come back with seven of his
[1:47:40] buddies that are worse than him right
[1:47:43] amen that's the
[1:47:47] scripture come out of the blood to us
[1:47:49] through the blood that we are cleansed
[1:47:51] and now our blood our life which came by
[1:47:53] living through sexual desire brought our
[1:47:55] life in the world the blood of Jesus
[1:47:57] Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by
[1:48:01] sending upon us the Holy Spirit and we
[1:48:04] become new creatures in Christ Jesus one
[1:48:08] more perfect Faith listen now now notice
[1:48:11] this is one of my favorite quotes of all
[1:48:13] time out of the millions I have this is
[1:48:16] one of my favorites multi-millions and
[1:48:19] multili I have millions of favorite
[1:48:21] quotes but this is of my most favorites
[1:48:25] perfect Faith
[1:48:27] notice now notice perfect faith is a
[1:48:31] master of all
[1:48:34] circumstances praise the Lord I like
[1:48:36] that perfect faith not just faith not
[1:48:39] just dealt The Measure of Faith now
[1:48:43] perfect uh we're going to look at later
[1:48:45] I thought I'd actually get to it today
[1:48:47] but not getting there perfect actually
[1:48:50] scripturally there is a perfect that is
[1:48:52] a sinless Flawless Perfection but
[1:48:54] there's also a per a perfection in the
[1:48:57] scripture that speaks of just being
[1:49:00] mature and a full age of a grown mature
[1:49:04] Christian amen perfect Faith doesn't
[1:49:07] mean that it's in you as a human
[1:49:09] Flawless no it means that it's a mature
[1:49:11] Faith yeah amen you don't you don't take
[1:49:14] your enemy and say you're a
[1:49:17] frog and cast him into a frog because
[1:49:19] you got the faith to do it Jesus could
[1:49:22] have done that every one of them that
[1:49:23] tried to crucify him you're a flea
[1:49:25] you're a frog you're I cast you into a
[1:49:29] be a snake or whatever he didn't do that
[1:49:32] when when Satan the devil came at again
[1:49:36] the Mount of Temptation he could have
[1:49:38] said you're a you're a flee on a frog's
[1:49:42] back he could have cast him into
[1:49:44] anything he wanted to no he didn't
[1:49:46] defeat him that way he defeated him with
[1:49:48] the same way that we defeated him the
[1:49:50] word yes amen defeated him with the word
[1:49:54] which is the same weapon and the same
[1:49:56] thing that we defeat him with praise the
[1:49:59] Lord in his Humanity he showed that we
[1:50:03] could defeat him the exact same way that
[1:50:05] he
[1:50:06] defeated perfect Faith Masters all
[1:50:10] circumstances perfect Faith Masters all
[1:50:13] circumstances no matter what it is it
[1:50:16] Masters it yes praise the Lord so I
[1:50:19] don't care what it looks like I don't
[1:50:21] care what it sounds like like feels like
[1:50:24] I don't care how sick they are I don't
[1:50:25] care how in a deathbed I don't care
[1:50:28] circumstances make no difference to
[1:50:32] God if they make no difference to God
[1:50:34] then they should make no difference to
[1:50:36] us a mature faith will master that
[1:50:40] circumstance a mature faith will call
[1:50:43] those things that are not as though they
[1:50:44] were and bring it into existence so that
[1:50:47] we have a substance so we have an
[1:50:50] Evidence and look friends that's just
[1:50:52] the found
[1:50:54] Foundation that's just the beginning
[1:50:56] that's just the start my hour I'm over
[1:50:59] an hour is gone and and haven't even
[1:51:01] scratched it really but it's it's just
[1:51:03] the foundation yes it's just the start
[1:51:07] it's just the beginning but on that you
[1:51:10] can't build this without building it on
[1:51:13] that
[1:51:14] though it's like the man who tries to
[1:51:16] build his hand on his house on the
[1:51:17] seashore or something it'll it'll
[1:51:19] crumble but you set that house on a
[1:51:22] solid rock on a foundation a house a
[1:51:24] hold yeah it's got to be on a solid
[1:51:27] foundation and that faith has got to be
[1:51:29] that faith of perfect faith of a mature
[1:51:33] Faith but it's a faith that you use what
[1:51:35] you have because different people are
[1:51:38] different levels at different times no
[1:51:39] big eyes and little yous but some people
[1:51:42] have a little more faith there's
[1:51:44] actually a gift of faith even in
[1:51:46] Corinthians there's a gift of faith so
[1:51:49] there's the different Lev but you use
[1:51:50] what you have you take what you've been
[1:51:53] a lotted or or or how much you've grown
[1:51:55] in faith you take the growth of your
[1:51:57] faith and use it yeah amen use it
[1:52:00] whatever you got say I just have the
[1:52:02] teeniest little Mustard Seed well then
[1:52:04] you've got the power to move this tree
[1:52:06] over here you've got the power to move
[1:52:08] that mountain right if you don't want
[1:52:09] the catalinas there anymore move
[1:52:12] them you said you had the greatest the
[1:52:14] tiniest little bit of Faith well the
[1:52:16] faith faith to gr us a must mustard SE
[1:52:18] to move mountains right then what excuse
[1:52:21] do we have
[1:52:23] praise the Lord but it's got to be an
[1:52:24] unfettered Faith he because well I don't
[1:52:27] know maybe maybe not we we'll see I it
[1:52:32] might be you know I don't amen you said
[1:52:36] and and the thing that I that I get and
[1:52:38] and I do it too because if you don't
[1:52:40] know you don't know but so many times we
[1:52:42] get to this place say well if it's God's
[1:52:44] Will and that's fine there's nothing
[1:52:47] wrong with that unless God's revealed to
[1:52:49] you whether it is his will or not that's
[1:52:51] something different different praise the
[1:52:53] Lord
[1:52:55] but when we get to the place to praying
[1:52:58] for something that's say as serious is
[1:53:01] that we say
[1:53:03] Lord what is your faith in this word if
[1:53:06] it's not it's like I told you I I'll
[1:53:08] close with this I'm sorry I just keep
[1:53:10] going it's like I've told the story
[1:53:12] several times about my sister I prayed
[1:53:14] for my sister's healing I prayed pray
[1:53:16] she had cancer breast cancer she was
[1:53:18] dying of bre of of

[1:53:59] church and attending another trying to
[1:54:01] help another one I wasn't pastoring it I
[1:54:03] I personally don't think a pastor should
[1:54:06] anyway I I'll just keep that to myself I
[1:54:08] was pastoring a church I was going over
[1:54:10] and trying to help take care of this
[1:54:11] other church and i' went over there had

[1:54:59] was uh I used to do that when I was The
[1:55:01] Courier Service in Florida I'd listened
[1:55:04] to a lot of tapes when I was in the car
[1:55:06] and I knew when the spirit of God
[1:55:08] dropped in that car I'd rake everything
[1:55:10] off the passenger seat onto the
[1:55:12] floorboard yeah and god let's talk a
[1:55:16] while every that's that's one of those
[1:55:19] times is when God told me to come here

[1:55:53] time with our our children M tath I want
[1:55:56] her to be here watch them grow up and
[1:55:59] God said stop praying for her so I said
[1:56:03] why how many times you you ask God
[1:56:06] why why you actually
[1:56:09] answered he said cuz it's time for me to

[1:56:41] I would have loved for her to meet tath
[1:56:43] his children and but we don't know why
[1:56:46] but he told me it's time I'm it's time

[1:56:52] it while you're praying for
[1:56:54] her well you're asking her for my asking
[1:56:58] me for her healing I can't take her

[1:57:06] will be done not mine whatever your will
[1:57:09] is Lord I'll I'll stop praying for her
[1:57:12] I'm not going to pray that you take her
[1:57:15] I wasn't going to do that but I knew it
[1:57:17] was the Lord's will at that time and I

[2:09:21] anyone else have anything
[2:09:25] before yes um just in relevance to your
[2:09:30] message I think it was timely and um
[2:09:35] brother green before the Lord took him
[2:09:37] there was an angel that was speaking to
[2:09:39] him you remember he never showed himself
[2:09:43] and brother green made this statement
[2:09:45] the reason why God doesn't show himself
[2:09:49] more real the angels Don't appear before
[2:09:52] us and speak to us because we don't live
[2:09:54] that
[2:09:55] life and I I believe that it's time um
[2:10:00] God is is working in his bride amen and
[2:10:03] it's it's closer than we think I believe
[2:10:06] that yes and about three Sundays ago I

[2:10:22] book where where it's at is number two
[2:10:25] amazing grace Amazing Grace yeah and
[2:10:27] three what was that three Sundays ago
[2:10:29] that's the song that you open and that's
[2:10:32] a song that you close amen that's little
[2:10:35] things how God can show his presence
[2:10:38] amen so true brother
[2:10:41] absolutely sometimes just open our eyes
[2:10:43] to see yes God's moving amen praise the
[2:10:48] Lord God richly bless you love you
