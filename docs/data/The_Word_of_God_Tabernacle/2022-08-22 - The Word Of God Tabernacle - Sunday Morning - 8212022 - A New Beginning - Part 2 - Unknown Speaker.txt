just trusting that's all still uh going and okay and all is well there so amen thankful for that um i have a prayer request here from danny said i had to he says i had to change over to another insurance company because the agency who handled that that insurance company wasn't affiliated with that company anymore the agency supposed to have canceled my insurance with my previous insurance company instead they deducted their premium after i had paid the new insurance company my startup premium both are both amounts are over a hundred dollars i'm hoping that i don't have problems getting my money back from the council policy well we're going to pray and believe that you don't danny so amen those lap overs sometimes can be uh can be tricky and all i could have recommended you call my son amen that may have been averted but nevertheless the lord will touch you and bring that back to you praise the lord amen so we're thankful for that amen and that's the prayer request i have here anyone have an unspoken request on your heart amen praise the lord god knows all our hearts today good to have rodney with us god bless you my friend good to have you back he was over there at the home when we baptized uh javi the other day and ate water and jews and it's just a good company so we appreciated that brother lord bless you and of course this tall drink of water over here uh you all probably know is uh austin brother patton sister pat's grandson so it's good to have you austin enjoyed our time together thursday wednesday thank you thanks for chauffeuring us around austin's looking to be a pilot so he's in the air force now and going to college and got his life on track so he's got to go back tuesday this will be his last vacation for a while so he comes to see his brother and sister pat and us so welcome and pray for him he's his flight he's leaving tuesday right tuesday the 23rd so lord would just bless his flight and give him a good journey back home so so it's good to have you good to have each one of you let's stand to our feet if we could amen appreciate the lord's goodness and blessings to us again brother dennis would you pray for these deeds again for us jesus and heads in unison of the faith bow lord knowing that you're all loving and caring god lord i just read in the scriptures that you told us one time you went into the temple to pray yes one was a a pharisee and one was a publican and the pharisee just bragged how much he has done for you paying his tithes and going to church and helping this one and just doing all the good that he could and the elder the publican just so humble and he felt he couldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven for he said forgive such a sinner's eye and father one was justified of himself and he got his own reward here on earth and the other one was justified of you knowing that his reward his treasures lay in heaven and help us to understand that as we pray as we search you with all our hearts yes as we know that you're coming is knocking at the door you know that old laddish that i've said many times if there's something you really want you'll find a way if not you'll find an excuse and there's so many excuses among us believers at times that oh we don't have to go to church oh we don't have to pay our tithes this month oh we don't have to love everyone this one has done me wrong oh we make excuses knowing that lord you have taught us your word yes jesus we need to stay with your word purified with your word lord to be anchored in jesus christ lord help us not to make any excuses in any way and the only way we can be successful is to let you live your life in us to make us dead to our own self dead to this flesh and let your holy spirit have full reign and control led by the spirit of god the footsteps of the righteous are order of the lord them that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and lord there are many requests we know that we serve a god that's willing to answer our needs according to your riches yes and lord may you come understand and bless the ones that need a financial touch you know as your word says father that i will not leave my righteousness forsaken or i'll have them bacon bread and lord you will meet our needs amen you would help daddy my brother you would help all that need a financial uh touch father jesus and there's some that are sick lord you are mindful of each and every one we are not a defeated group we are more than conquerors amen in jesus christ we call you on the scene lord jesus our great physician lord may you just touch each one and whatever they have need of for you are our high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities yes and with your stripes we are healed grant and lord bless our pastor lord as he laboreth faithfully and fervently to bring forth your word may our hearts be open may our hearts be ready yes jesus yes bread of life father they'll let us grow in the statue of a perfect man thank you lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen thanks the lord you can be seated if you like i forgot to ask i i'm leaving of course this afternoon so i appreciate your prayers for the flight this afternoon i only have one flight sonia's supposed to take me to phoenix today they had me flying out of phoenix today so uh just fly direct from phoenix to uh minneapolis so i just have one flight today but i appreciate your prayers for that amen the lord would just bless that flight also micah had a request i'm sorry i forgot to do this he wanted to um let's try to handle the lord in all things some things in this world are happening today that are just without excuse just under just just don't understand but the only thing that we do no one realizes we're at the end of this yes this world's coming to an end and we knew as it was coming to an end it was going to get worse uh just never would imagine that i would live to see a day where things like that become i don't want to say acceptable but there's no punishment for no no accountability just no accountability today nothing's anybody's fault anymore either sick or delusional or mental or whatever it is it's never the person's fault anymore there's always a reason excuses and it's just sad that's just a very sad testimony but we know a god who can help on this lady in this girl's heart just touch and move in that special way amen sister pat had a uh testimony as well um did you want me to read it or do you want to tell it you want me to read it yeah she wrote it down for me i wasn't sure it was real it wasn't sitting it's a praise report that sister pat sent me a text praise god for answered prayers about me having double vision problems remember she said you me spoke the word uh last week when we'll say mistakenly had it as a praise report and said a prayer request i don't believe it was a mistake but thank the lord uh as you spoke the word for mri tests to be okay and the vision to be corrected god honored that all the tests mri came back negative and the double vision is getting better maybe corrected with glasses praise god for his loving care amen amen praise the lord amen so one that was considered a prayer request last week we read as a praise report prophetically how's that amen i did get a text here from sharya since i was looking at that and said sorry for late texts arthur and gabriel both have a cold and arthur has a toothache and sore throat amen so let's remember um our trial that's from them just now so praise the lord he's good amen thank god for answered prayers he's always with us amen 381 [Music] and this world is not my home [Music] this world [Music] the is the angels [Music] [Music] lord what will i do the angels become heaven they're all expecting me and that's something i know [Music] [Music] anymore [Music] dear lord what will i do the angels that could be [Music] anymore just over in the glory land we'll live [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] eternally the saints on every hand they're shouting to victory the songs of sweetest praise came back from heaven [Music] [Music] dear lord what will i do [Music] i [Music] [Music] isn't that the truth saints praise the lord my there was a time but not anymore it's not my home my heart's crying for another home another place another dimension that we're going to amen that's far beyond this mortal reach praise the lord jesus yes amen so thankful that god give us something that we can anchor our souls in that we have a vision for towards looking to amen believe he's going to continue to bless and bring us along amen and bring us along in his in his light and his word and all that he does for us amen praise the lord jesus amen good to be in the house of the lord today god bless you let's stand to our feet if we could [Music] amen you want to have a testimony real quick on your heart yeah i did i i had a neighbor that was uh she's homeless and she lost her home and her mom moved out she had come into my yard and they were her and her boyfriend were doing drugs and they almost died i had to call the emts and she hated me after that and she couldn't remember she lost her clothes i gave them both their clothes and everything and they went on down the road and she kept coming back to me while her boyfriend came back and i found some more stuff i gave it to him she was she was looking at me you know cockeyed like i'd done something to her well i would have been praying that god would make a way to bring her back because she hadn't heard the gospel because she'd been so zoned out all the time when i met her or she was in such a hurry and to get out and go do whatever she did and last night i was standing in the lane and she came up to me and i don't see so well and so i didn't know who it was right away and she's put on a little bit of weight which i'm glad and she saw me and she came up and she put an arm around me i was so i've got answered prayer and healed that breach she thought that i had done it wrong and called in the emts and everything couldn't understand why i'd asked her to leave and so now she i guess she understands now amen and and as she hugged me and so now now god can work praise the lord amen amen amen god is good we're supposed to baptize somebody yesterday but uh he wasn't able to make it so we'll see if that happens guy's name is billy so remember him in prayer yeah he's already been baptized we prayed for my neighbor had cancer and they gave him one year to live that was they couldn't fix it and he was out this morning working in his yard when we drove by praise the lord is that long no another different neighbor okay man amen bro lord knows there's the lord amen i don't remember praying for him but the one who matters the most does amen praise the lord god is good thankful to him amen let's turn our bibles down genesis chapter 1 and then we're going to continue where we left off last week lord willing here genesis chapter one read the first couple of verses of scripture here again as we uh get back into the new beginning part two and then new beginning part two like i said probably going to be several parts to it um just however the lord leads it but uh there's a lot that goes through the scripture when you begin to look at it and see the little nuances of the scriptures and how god uh flows from genesis 1 to revelation 22. he never changes god and his patterns and how he works and what he does and how he reveals himself just just when you really start looking at the scripture it's just it's just infallible it's just infallible god is uh god is not the unchanging almighty god amen but again we're going to start with the first chapter of genesis the first verse but before we do let's buy our heads for another word of prayer precious jesus father again is a privilege to be here lord in your house expecting you and knowing that you visited with us lord and that you are here now yes to do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask for thing knowing in ourselves we are nothing lord insufficient to the task but you lord of the all-sufficient one of whom we look to and lean on and trust in in every facet of our lives and in every way god we come to this beautiful sunday morning that you give us lord after the beautiful rain that you give us here in the desert and the things greening and blossoming and the smell of the rain is just it's just a wonderful time lord and we thank you for it we thank you lord for that natural rain and of course for the spiritual reign that you would pour upon us here in this place lord may it fill all this house again lord as we pray that your holy spirit would have the preeminence now in each one of our lives god to do what you would desire to do for us for what we've come here for and lord just to meet with you lord it's uh maybe nothing that's a special lord but just to come be with you lord and to honor this time that you set aside for us to come and and and expect to meet with you and worship you praise you to thank you for all that you do for us lord and have done for us and looking forward to god to what you do for us in the future if you would terry lord i pray that you bless these people that have come may you bless those who may be watching today lord may your holy spirit have its preeminence now as we commit the remaining part of this in your hands anoint speaker in here alike that lord what you have accomplished to be done here today we rebuke every demonic spirit that we try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory praise and honor for all that is said and done we thank you for it lord we know that you're moving on the request we know many of the requests we've had have become praise reports and lord we just want to thank you for that lord god just let your word come to our hearts now lord and reveal it as you would have us to see it now we committed to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period that's a mouthful just that the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you'd like amen i'm going to go over to hebrews chapter 11. amen hebrews chapter 11. but as we remember back in genesis because we will be referring back to genesis several times a couple more times today uh obviously probably in future messages to come uh genesis because we know genesis is the seed chapter genesis is the beginning genesis is uh the everything that began everything that exists today began there amen let me read this to you i will restore 1954 brother graham says now that in order to get the basis for this for a few minutes i believe that everything that is now began in genesis right amen everything that is now began in genesis the word genesis is the beginning and every cult that we have on the face of the earth today began in genesis everything that we have today started in genesis it's beginning otherwise known as the seed chapter of the bible where the beginning originated when god way back before there was ever a star in heaven before there was even light in the skies that's as far as our mind could look back and take it god was there all that great space of eternity to eternity god was setting back in eternity then he moved out god became the logos which could say it uh which would say it uh like a little sacred light that moved out of that darkness or out of that eternity as a child playing before the father's house his infinite mind he had this scene that he would be at the end of the beginning uh at the end from the beginning that uh that he was then then he spoke and said let there be and then adam split yard of the sky somewhere in the sun came into existence after 100 billion years a clinker flew off of it was a star and watch it falling it fell maybe several million years and then god stopped it and there it fell and it stopped it and god another one fell and he stopped it he said what was god doing he was writing his first bible god's creation and the clinker falling off and god lets it fly through till he says that's far enough stop right there you stop right there and you put all the constellation everything look at it's in perfect word today than the day it was created god placed exactly where it's supposed to be amen writing his first bible we had three bibles written one of them in the heavens above the zodiac it starts with the virgin ends up with the of the lion first coming second coming the lord jesus down to different ages then we find enoch right in the pyramids and then the third was put on paper which we have here sitting before us now we know again uh that beginning that genesis was the beginning of all things but let's go over to hebrews now and chapter 11 hebrews chapter 11. we're just going to read one verse of scripture here because we're going to get back into this new beginning we know that we talked about last week the andalusian world and the destruction of the andalusian world by water and then we had the as we called it the bc uh error age 2000 roughly not exactly but roughly 2 000 years until jesus came died and shed his blood and dropped his blood upon this earth which received its sanctification process and then at the end we know this world that we live in now a.d is the world that's going to be destroyed by fire that is going to be completely purified by fire we know that water couldn't purify it the blood purified the spirit but not the actual uh uh uh physicality of the world but now the fire completely annihilates all sin all sin not even a molecule or a germ of sin will be left once that is done and it will read some scripture later about that but let's go back again in in the andaluvian world we got to an end of the andalumian world with with uh with noah and the va and the bible talks about knowing in the faith chapter of hebrews like this by faith by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet now we know that there had never reigned on the earth up unto this time god watered the earth from from underneath the water come up from underneath the earth to water all the plants the body life and all that the animals needed and what humans needed came from underneath the earth they had never reigned up to that time so when god warned noah he won't know of something that had never happened before god told noah i'm going to do this something that has never happened so to have the faith to believe that god could do something is one thing but to have the faith to know that god can do something that has never happened in the history of humanity up to that time before to me is probably even another level of faith another level of faith to believe that god could create something that didn't exist god could cause something to happen that had never happened before so when noah moved by faith he moved by faith understanding not that god could create a blade of grass or that god can heal or that god could do the miracles that we know god can do today because he's already done those things but this is something god had never done god something that had never happened before so when god told noah this this was something of us of a real i would say high level of faith so when it says by faith noah yes he was warned of god but he was warned of god of something that he had never even seen before never knew had never happened not yet not seen as yet the bible says here not seen as yet so something that had never happened he moved with fear with reverence with respect he moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heirs of the righteousness which is by faith now i want you to notice a little something that it tells us in the new testament that doesn't say this in the old testament but in the new testament and in light of the message that we have today we know what god has done of the time periods of each of these remember these special event happens major occurrence every two thousand ish years now we see that but as god has brought each one of these up the similarities and how god has allowed them to go through and what god has done to bring preparation for that time is just uh it is just god it's just miraculous it's a miracle when you go back and you study and you look and see what god has done through that period and to bring those that he's redeemed at that time to that point and through that point and shadowing in the old testament what he's doing in the new testament even to what he's doing today right today right now you can look at noah in in genesis 5 6 7 8 you can look at him in hebrews 11 7 here and you can see how god has has proven once again that not only there what we would say four thousand is years ago but god is doing the same thing today very much now let's read this again he said he moved with fear preparing an ark to the saving of his house noah prepared an ark now god gave noah the specific instructions that it was going to take for this ark to be able to sustain the judgment that was coming now we know of course enoch typed the bride noah typed the church enoch the bride went before the tribulation and noah went up through the tribulation period but god took care of noah god took care of noah and his family god helped and gave noah the preparation and the ability to be able to go beyond the judgment amen even though he was that tight beyond the judgment he prepared the ark for what purpose he prepared the ark to save his family that was the number one purpose it was to save his family right amen you want your family saved build that ark praise the lord build that ark that's the same thing no idea it's the same thing today build that ark noah built the ark number one to save his family but look what happened in the saving of his own life and his family's life what does the rest of it say he condemned the world at the same time he built the ark to save his family that ark became a condemnation to the rest of humanity same thing dual purpose just like god did when he when he came in flesh when jesus came in flesh and he died what happened he went to hell he went to hell and as we know by the scripture and of course by the message souls that are in prison he preached jesus preached to the souls that were in prison right amen then he sent a prophet in this last day to preach that exact same message souls that are in prison now indicating to us the time is now just like it was 4 000 years ago just like it was 2 000 years ago so it is today the preparing of the ark saves the redeemed but it also condemns now that's your part amen that's your ark the ark that you've prepared the ark the house that god lives in the ark that you've prepared is now not only saving you and going to put you in a rapture but it's also a condemnation to the rest of the world what did brother brown say and the souls are in person now he said that you are here ministering to the rest of these worlds your mere existence is a condemnation to the rest of the world that does not cannot will not believe right amen your existence just like jesus was amen it happened in noah's day he built the ark saved his family condemned the world jesus came saved the redeemed went to hell preached the souls in prison resurrected sitting on the right hand of god now the same thing happens today god's people god's bride in preparing an ark are becoming a condemnation to the rest of the world souls that are in prison today what did malachi tell us malachi chapter 4 3 and 4 tells us that he would send us elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord now that elijah prophet has come the spirit of elijah in the prophet we know william branham that spirit that spoke that word come before the great amen it's great for who the redeemed the bride it's a great day for us yes it's a great day to the believer it's a great day to the bride amen but it's a dreadful day to those who are in this world that are facing all the things that's happening around in this world today and are going to continue to get worse in this world i hate to be a a a well it's not a downer if you're a believer i was going to say i hate to be a downer but it's not a downer if you're a believer amen uh it's not at all a downer it is it is a great day it's the great and dreadful day it's the ark to the saving of the souls but it's a condemnation to those who don't do not believe right so you see these the same thing provides the same purpose uh it's like that story that billy paul tells about uh i think it was billy paul told this story about the um yeah in fact i'm sure it is about this man who uh was a believer and he uh talked to somebody at work i believe it was his job and uh this guy became interested and he took took a message book and he said here uh i want you to read this read this when you get a chance the man comes back with that book and throws it in the man's chest and says don't you ever give me anything written by that man again i don't ever want to hear anything he has to say again and that man says what's the problem he said that man in that book called me a buzzard and he took the book and he said well that's funny the same man in the same book called be an eagle amen is it the ark that's the saving of the soul or is it a condemnation right serves the same purpose the same bible that we know as our type host and as our salvation is what uh uh has come to live in us the third written bible that god has written has come and that's that spirit of god him christ living in us now has become salvation but to the rest of the world is condemnation to those who don't believe to those who will not follow it to those who don't want to have anything to do with it becomes a condemnation your mere existence on this planet friends is a condemnation to the rest of the world who say i can't live that i can't believe that it's not possible your existence proves they are wrong your existence proves it can be believed your existence proves that it can be lived your existence proved that it can be believed amen can be lived because you are here living you are here doing it your existence it becomes it becomes a ministering to the world to the souls that are in prison amen same thing notice again after the first two thousand years the ark did that second two thousand years jesus in his existence and preaching to the souls in prison did that now does the exact same thing today amen at the end of this two thousand years see there's always a reason why god does certain things a certain way at certain times it's not necessarily what god does although that's a big part of it it also matters when he does it the timing of what god does is just as important as what he does and the timing of god sending a prophet elijah the prophet to bring a message to us to speak the words that he spoke those weren't just messages that we can go back and listen to or read in a book those were things that god had placed and it was in his mind before the foundation of the world that a man would come and preach to you his bride for this last day amen there's a reason for it god put it that way so that we could see it and know it and that it would fit the scripture the scripture does not change it does not deviate god does not change he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he done it one way one time he's got to do it all the way through and he does praise god and he's doing it today he's doing it today that great and dreadful day of the lord that's that is this day it's great to the believer but it's a dreadful time for those who won't believe it's a dreadful time to the world to the world cosmos amen amen that's why we do the best we can to help with all that we can as god gives our lips utterance we speak we don't cast our pearl before swine but as god gives us utterance we speak and as god speaks through us there's purpose yes amen there's purpose there's reason amen it's not just having something to say it's not just having somebody to say it to god could have preached souls in prison back with iranians if you wanted to but he didn't not to the degree that we know today why because it wasn't for that time yeah it's not just to have something to say it's not just to have somebody to say it to purposeful he meant the word the time the person purposeful and god and then when god's a part of it then it works out perfect amen now let's go over to second peter chapter three we'll continue on this andalusian world and the transition the transition from that into the post andalumian or the post flood uh i've got two messages that really run close together here so i'm trying to split them the best i can i may leak over into next week's i try not to i try to keep them as separate as possible but they run so close together uh and it would have taken two and a half hours to have brought it all today so um i tried to divide them to where we can just hit some highlights here and then uh get back to it lord really next next sunday but second peter chapter three now uh we'll begin reading with verse 3. ii peter chapter 3 verse 3. now knowing this first first that there shall come in the last days we know that's where we're living last days scoffers walking after their own lusts now generally they become scoffers because they're walking after their own lusts people who want to go their own way and do their own thing generally criticize anything that would come against that lust or that desire or that that want they'll criticize anybody anything that might interrupt or or cause them to feel condemned because of the light they're living so they become scoffers they've become stoppers uh to make fun of and and uh and put down walking after their own lust saying where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fellas not again let's look at the let's listen to the next couple of verses in the context of uh of of people trying to reason with the word this is speaking people that would try to understand or reason with the word where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation for this they willingly they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world then that then was being overflowed with water perished the world perished now we'll get to that just a minute overflow with water perish but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men again the three stages water baptism blood baptism and fire baptism just like the holy spirit just like justification sanctification holy spirit god works in threes always the this world is reserved fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved now listen to this now now now peter is starting to explain spiritually first humanly trying to reason the word trying to understand the word uh is is one thing that people try to do well where is it he said he was coming where is he what's going on nothing's different nothing's changed but they fail to see into the eternities into the mind of god to realize what's going on why is god doing what he's doing and people try to figure god out all the time and people put god down and how could god allow this to happen i mean even the testimony micah gave us which i won't take but uh how could god allow something like that how how could he allow this to happen and starving children and blah blah blah people say that all the time you know again no human accountability right it doesn't happen that uh you know humanity inherently is serpent-seed and greedy by nature uh the love of money we get rich and we throw a little bit of money over at these people and think it just takes care of it and that it doesn't work that way but that's man's understanding of the scripture well where is he why is it like this this nothing's happened he's not come by yet he's not going to come it's not going to change nothing's going to be any different but now peter then begins to lay out to help understand god has a reason for everything he does and why he does it how he does it when he does it but beloved listen now be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day in other words we've only been a few days it hasn't even been a whole week in god's mind right thousand one thousand years one day one day a thousand years hasn't even been a whole week yet six thousand years or so we've had on this planet hadn't even been a whole week as you would count a seven day week hasn't even been a whole weekend people say well it's been so long and nothing's happened it ain't even been a week the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slightness but god is long-suffering praise the lord amen for his long suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance yes things continue on but that's just because of the love of god god doesn't allow things to go the way they are because he hates you he's allowing it to continue because he loves you because he loves humanity because he wants everyone knowing that not all will be but that everyone all flesh could come to repentance he's long-suffering he's not forgotten us he's not ignorant he's not dumb he's not negligent to his promises he's just long-suffering his grace his mercy his long-suffering to us humans who deserve hell to begin with he's long-suffering his love now when man looks at it in the carnal it looks like one thing but when you can put on the spiritual eyes let that ice have again correct your vision to where you can see the revelation of the scripture recognize this is the way it is because god loves humanity so much because he loves you so much his grace to us word his long-suffering to us work continues because that's how good he is that's just how good he is i i just in my lifetime i don't see how god's lasted i don't know how it's lasted this long i mean all of you nodding and shaking and you agree with i don't know how swamp has lasted this long i i don't see how we got to this point right but that just have to remember it's god's long suffering it's god's love his will god would his will would be that all would come to repentance but again as i've said many times god does not predestinate based on his will he predestinates based on his foreknowledge even though his will would be that all would his predestination before knowledge knew they would not unfortunately i wish they would too i don't want to see a single hurt a single soul in hell right personally i don't want to see one there will be but i don't want there to be i wish or wouldn't and that's his word says his will yes what was that what would be our will today would we want to see i know there's a lot of people in the world talk about us this new phrase that i've heard recently or in the past couple years that people come out just just foul people not good people and and and because they hear something they think is done that's worse than what they've done their phrases there must be a special place in hell for this person that did that thing and that makes me think well how special is the place that you're going to occupy i mean that's the sad reality a lot of times of it but the truth of it is people are so quick to want to and desire to see people go to hell that's not the will of god amen that's not the heart of god god's heart is in this word it says he does not want anybody to go to hell nor do i i don't think any of us here would want that right i don't care how bad you've been treated yes i don't care what anybody's done to you you don't want to see anybody go to hell yes amen right but that's his will he said his will was but he's because he's long suffering that they should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away look at this now the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and and the elements the elements shall melt with fervor heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up annihilated the bible says pass away which we've talked about i'll come back to in a minute seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons are we to be in all holy conversation and godliness what kind of people are we to be today saints looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens shall be on fire the heavens shall be on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and that's where this whole series is headed to amen may take several parts but this whole series is headed to that place that new heavens and that new earth that god has that he said that in john 14 1 he's already got to prepare for us amen and when john saw it he saw it as a bride a door for a husband coming down on that pyramid shake mountain amen that's where we're headed saints praise the lord amen wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you be found of him in peace without spot and blameless now let's look at for a moment that um that phrase as we we've talked about before in the past that phrase pass away and the 10th verse that said the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night it's a thief in the night the thief in the night is usually something that's unexpected it's something that uh catches a person unawares now i'm going to very off of that not that that's not true because it is true but to the bride it's not a thief in the night amen to the bride she knows what's going on yeah and i don't believe it would be a shock or surprise to any of us if we were raptured out of here in the morning i don't it wasn't to me would it to you i mean i think the bride is being conditioned to the place that she's ready and she's waiting and she's looking at any moment that we're going to be caught home to be with him or we're looking for our loved ones to appear before us maybe that would negate the in the morning but uh nevertheless you see your loved ones walking around at breakfast in the morning you're essentially already there anyway so amen so that's what we're looking at waiting for so as a thief in the night well who does it catch unawares those who don't believe those who refuse to accept what god is doing yes he is long suffering but there'll be a time god's long suffering will run out and that judgment which the judgment has already started thank god there's still some grace in the world but when the bride leaves obedient with grace yes there'll be no more love amen that'll just be pure judgment that's all it'll be and this is the judgment that's hitting the earth now but right now even as this judgment is setting in god is still sending warning he always sends warning before judgment there's still warning going forth allowing people to have the opportunity get on that ark now get in that ark while there's still a chance that ark was built and you have the opportunity get in it before it's too late amen because when they finally came up knocking on the door asking no one the rain started falling asking noah open the door open the door let us in he says too late god closed the door right i can't open it not even to your cousin eddie not even to aunt phyllis i can't open the door to my nieces and nephews i i can't help you to the rest of my family to the rest of the world god closed the door i can't open it you had the chance i preached to you for 120 years and you scoffed at me you laughed at me you made fun of my beautiful great creation i have a year you thought i was an idiot for getting all these animals and things coming around and and getting on here and now you've passed over from the warnings that god gave over and over and over into the judgment you remember the story that that uh i was told many years ago of the man who was caught in a flood and the man uh finally crawled up onto the roof of his house and the flood was just rising and rising and rushing and pouring in and he was praying god help me god save me god deliver me from this and a boat comes paddling along or putting along against the motor he comes down and he stops at the man he says come get my boat i can rescue you i can help you get in my boat the guy says no no i'm waiting for god to save me i'm waiting for god to rescue okay goes on helicopter comes over drops the rope down grab the rope sir i'm here to save you grab the rope and you can be saved from this no thank you i'm waiting on god to save me the man drowns goes to heaven he says god i thought you were going to save me he said well i sent you a boat i sent you a helicopter what else did you want me to do i sent you every way i've escaped i could think this into you you rejected every one of them and all you had left was to drown that's the same thing that people were in today yes the warning continued to come the word continues to unfold god continues to bring forth that bread of life and and and the witness of his spirit around the world in this last day and people just continue to reject it the warnings continue to go but as the judgment continues to fall saints it's it it is the way it is in this day so when these golfers get to that place and that and that becomes a thief in the night to them they it's catches them unawares they look around and say what is going on in this world today amen and god takes his bride home nothing left after that but judgment the lord will come as a thief in the night and the witch the heavens shall pass away the heavens shall pass away and the elements of the of the earth and of the heavens shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up no wonder there's no more singing we'll find out as we read it last week revelation 21 there is no more sea when he sets this new city up there's no more sea why it's all burnt up and blasted and annihilated uh not annihilated but as the word pass away here as we've said many times the word pass away is a greek word p-a-r-e-r-c-h-o-m-a-i you think i learned how to pronounce that after all this time but i haven't uh p-a-r-e-r-c-h-o-m-a-i brother branham points out that pass away that word that that that encompasses both pass away both words not just the one word but both words the phrase or the two word pass away is this one greek word pass away which means not annihilated not completely done away with where it's no longer in existence but it means passing from one form to another right amen this earth this earth and receiving its fiery baptism where the earth the atmospheres the heavens explode all the elements all the uh the germs diseases every bit of it explodes with fervent heat every bit is purified by the fire of god it explodes even to work everything about it passes away or it changes from one form to another it's just like uh uh it says in i believe it's matthew i'm trying to remember that it said where jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away or never change heavens and earth will change they will evolve they will change from the current condition to a new condition once it's all burned over but my word cannot pass away or change his word is always the same it never changes so even as heaven and earth changes his work cannot change right from one form to the other but what else does what else does what else does is you we were talking about a little bit last week what else changes from one form to another it's me it's you because this body from came from this earth god gave it a baptism he gave a blood a bath he gave it a fiery baptism this earth from which my body came changes from one form to another praise the lord it won't no longer be in this sinful condition it will be in a glorified condition where the celestial will come and take the terrestrial and we become heavenly beings praise the lord this body changes from one form to another yes like we said last week why did god care so much about this earth well it's his creation first of all but it's where you came from god took you out of the ground he created you out of the dust of the ground from the from the very beginning and adam he took you from the dust of the earth praise the lord and that dust then changes from the sinful condition that we live in today and these these time bodies become eternal beings right glorified pain changed passed away from one form to another yes oh it's just god's showing the same thing he does all the way through the scripture what he does he said well that's just miraculous to the earth but what about you or you might think well god's done that great work in me yeah but he's also doing it in others he's doing it in his creation he's doing it around the world in the world itself the heavens and the earth pass away change change forms from one form to another that pass away just means that changing it changes from one form to another now let's go over to genesis chapter 5. we're going to finish in genesis today and start back with genesis i believe next week genesis chapter 5. we'll start with verse 21. noah it was not a surprise to noah the flood was not a surprise to noah those who were looking for christ saw him it was a surprise to those who were blinded because they couldn't see him but to those who were looking for him found him today's the same thing as i said it'll be a thief in the night to the world to people that don't believe but to the bride that's her fortune that's what she's looking to what she's looking for every day of her life i believe the bride has a vision for that and that's what she's looking to the coming of the lord yes the changing of our bodies our loved ones to appear before us we're looking to that yes amen not a surprise it's something that we know no was warned of what god was about to do have we not been done the same right the second two thousand they were warned isaiah told them a virgin shall conceive they were warned they were told what was going to happen this last day same thing friend we've been told we've been warned we know what god is doing we can read it in the word and find out god had to tell noah lift the ear but god put in his word and tell us what he's doing today now as we see these uh coincide with each other these parallels that run and and all through the scripture and i'm i'm trying to see help us see how god's plan and what god does each time god is runs in continuity he does the same thing every time he uses different people he may do a different tactic or something but the same thing god does each time he does amen and every bit of it has a reason has a purpose for it now verse 21 enoch lived 65 years and begot methuselah and enoch walked with god after he begot methuselah 300 years and begot sons and daughters all the days of enoch were 365 years and i've walked with god and he was not for god took him and methuselah lived in 180 and seven years begot lama methuselah lived after he begat lamech 700 uh uh 780 in two years and begot sons and daughters all the days in methuselah were 969 years you notice in this scripture god specifically points out certain ones and then he says and then he went on to have a bunch of sons and daughters but he had this one and he had this one he had a bunch of sons and daughters and he had this one and then he had a bunch of sons and daughters and this one see as god is tracing that lineage down through so that we can see and and pick how god is is exposing revealing his word for us to see today how he's doing they couldn't then but we do now as we look at it as each one goes through ina methuselah laymen 28th verse lived 12 82 years and begot and begat a son and his name now look this changed a little bit now i'm not going to tell you today why it changed but if we come next week you'll we'll get more into that but i'm not going to go to it today that takes us into next week but it changes you notice he said he had so and he was the so-and-so age he had so-and-so and he lived so and so after that but here he says lamak lived 180 in two years and begot a son and he called his name noah notice how it's very specific there his name noah saying the same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord had cursed now it doesn't give any other description like that with any of the others but for noah it does we'll find out more about that next week and lamech lived after he begot noah 590 in five years and begot sons and daughters and all the days of lama were 77 years and he died and noah was 500 years old and noah begat shem ham and jacob now in the in the light in the last few minutes we have here in the light of recognizing that god warns noah first of all and told noah what he was going to do but in light of understanding the time frame because see god told us what he's going to do correct he says i'm coming again i will come and i will take you that where i am you shall be also. so we know there's going to be a rapture we know there's going to be a catching away we know that god in these last days is going to take his bride home with him so we know that that's a that's a blanket stadium statement that we all know that's in the scripture that is just like god telling noah i'm gonna let it rain rain is gonna flood the earth build me an ark same blanket statement see jesus is coming a messiah is coming but how many people recognized what was going to happen to the messiah once he got here who knew what was going to take place who was it going to be how long was he going to be here how many years was going to be his ministry and what was going to be his demise amen unless you look back and really studied the torah the scripture to recognize as david crying out in several places about how they nailed his hands and his feet you wouldn't know right but search the scripture amen search the scripture look noah had a blanket statement god told him warned him i'm gonna it's gonna rain i'm going to destroy humanity i'm going to destroy botany life animal life and human life off the planet with water and he knew that but now how did he know when to get on the boat how did he know now you say well the ark is finished time to get in no not necessarily it's got to be in god's timing not yours yes i see how easy we get we think oh well it just makes sense i'm done with the boat time to get on that makes common sense sure doesn't it but is that equating to god's timing because that's all that matters is god's timing so what did god god says get on the boat but you never read anywhere where god said get on amen so there's again to the day that we live just like it was not a surprise to know what god was going to do he told it to abraham when he destroyed sodom and gomorrah that wasn't one of our change over 2000 major year major occurrence but god told abraham what he was going to do to sodom and gomorrah he said i i wouldn't dare do this without telling my prophet without telling my son amen and he didn't he told him and he does the same thing he did the same thing with noah he does the same thing with his children today with his bride today when is it going to be well we can know here lamont lived or methuselah lived 969 years and as we have said here before we do know that the meaning of methuselah's name you remember the meaning of methuselah's name methuselah was named by enoch who pleased god walked with god and was raptured so before god could begin to deal with noah who wasn't even born yet but could begin to deal with that end of the world scenario he had to take enoch off the scene so enoch typing the bride had to leave amen just like in this day this the bride goes home to deal with the end of time end of life not time life their scenario the flood methuselah was named by enoch that man that pleased god walked with god methuselah's name as we've read here before means when he dies when methuselah dies there shall be an omniscient an emission or a sending forth of waters upon the earth that was the meaning of methuselah's name who was named by enoch essentially enoch told noah exactly when to get on the ark by naming methuselah and when he named methuselah noah could then understand that of course catch that revelation and as he caught the revelation to understand that methuselah's name meant this that when methuselah died it was time to get on amen whether he created a finished york a week two weeks a month the year before that was irrelevant amen amen the point was it's time to get on the time is done the the end is now when methuselah died he died in the same year and thank god appreciate brother pat you can go through the description you can figure all this out brother pat's put it on those charts that we have over there and and when i'm looking at this again i referred to them because it made it easy i can look but god but noah knew because of enoch when it was time to get on the ark because of methuselah because the the meaning of methuselah's name now remember that meaning of a name names always mean something they always do remember brother said if you've if you've named your son ricky or uh elvis or something he said change that name the nature of that kid you'll want to change that name and you see sometimes uh certain natures and i think my what name was tacked to that kid you know uh because it makes a difference yes it makes a difference i mean that's not all there is to it that a person's name isn't all the reason they're a referee a lot of times it's parent delinquency but that name has a lot to do with it it does see so that name that methuselah we'll talk about the name again next week but the but the name methuselah when he dies shall be an emission a sending forth of water going that noah knew that when methuselah died that it was time to get on the ark now notice something his father lama died before his dad methuselah five years ish give or take about five years before methuselah died and noah got on the ark his dad lament died and did you notice what lamont's age was when he died seven seven seven wow perfect completion three is the word number for perfect set is the number of completion perfectly complete just a few years before methuselah well don't you think now it doesn't tell us scripturally i didn't find brother madam said this but don't you think that in understanding the names and the times and things that god's dealing with know at this time that when he took his father at 777 that meant something to him he was even to me that greater of a warning to say it is imminent i believe that's the time period we're living right now honestly that that's me i believe that this is the time period that we're leaving living right now that triple that that perfect completion that finished it all off even before methuselah because when methuselah died and noah got on the ark that was the completion of the souls that are in prison to me now the scripture doesn't say it brother i don't see where brother brown says it but we do know scripturally and by the prophet that there will be a period of time to where we will be on this earth and there will be no ability for anyone else to be saved we do know that we know that by the ark because they got on the ark may 17th but it didn't start raining until may 24th a whole week before it started raining they're sitting there on the ark with no rain yet but god put them there for that reason but at that point god shut the door and there was nobody could get in and nobody could get out right there's going to be that period of time personally i've told you this myself personally my own opinion revelation of it is i think that's going to be the time where the dead appear before us amen and we have that period of time where the dead are with us but that period before the rapture is going to be that period of time and i believe at that period of time there'll be no nobody can be saved at that time all that's going to go in is in but the but the perfect complete completion of lamech i believe is going on right now because we're at that we're we are in an understanding of the time frames and periods that god is working in for us at this time for this prime brother branham has been gone for 56 going on 57 years now you think man how can you do such good math i told you i died i bore i was born 10 days before he passed away so it's easy math as long as i remember how old i am 56 so it'd be 57 coming up in december he's been gone that long so if we were that close then how much closer are we now i know a thousand years is one day one day a thousand years but i'm looking at the scripture and the realization of what god did in the andalusian world what god did through jesus christ and what he's doing in this last day we're at that time yeah the perfect completion that noah saw with his dad passing and then a few years later methuselah dying it was time to get on the ark and then no flesh could be saved i believe there's still mercy saying yes yes i believe there's still grace i still believe there we're in a period of time where people can be saved now i do believe we're probably out there gleaning in fact i know we are brother branham said it 60 years ago that we were just gleaning uh maybe one here one there but as long as we are doing what we're called to do whether it's here or there uh this country another country this city another city doesn't matter let us be found faithful about the post amen doing the father's business because we can see here that god uh continues to show us what he's doing now by showing us what he did then amen and as noah knew it i believe we know it as it was revealed to noah i believe it becomes revealed to us and we can see that and god continues to show us what day we're living in and where we're at now i want you to keep in mind and hold that meaning of methuselah and the significance may give you some study tips if you want to go home before next sunday that that god made in the scripture about lama description of noah and why he went into such descriptive uh talking about noah why that he changed from he had a son he had sons and daughters died son sons daughters died and then all of a sudden he had a son he named him noah and it was because of this this and this because that becomes very significant for what we want to talk about next week amen they stand if we could praise the lord amen god is good yes he is his word is perfect as he is perfect praise the lord amen aren't you thankful god will not leave us without representation god will not leave us ignorant which just means you just don't know doesn't mean you're dumb or stupid it just means you just don't know god's not going to leave a sacrament amend the bride he lets her know praise the lord i didn't i didn't marry my wife and then take her on a honeymoon and then sneak off to a bar somewhere or go do something and she's sitting there where did he go no if i did anything it was first of all with her and if we did anything i would tell her unless it was a surprise but i let her know he lets us know he shows us he reveals it to us amen praise the lord i'm thankful for that let's sing this uh maybe a couple verses of this song again this world is not my home amen you feel more like that every day amen that's when you hear things like see on the news or michael was saying and my i saw i saw on the news the other day not too great at this point but some guy came up behind another guy i think it was
