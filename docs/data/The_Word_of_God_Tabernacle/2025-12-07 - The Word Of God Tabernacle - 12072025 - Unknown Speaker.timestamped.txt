[28:09] with you, my brother. Amen. So please
[28:11] remember him in prayer. Uh, also my I
[28:15] found out this week that uh my last
[28:18] living [music]
[28:19] aunt or uncle passed away. Uh, actually
[28:22] when I got home Sunday, it was been a
[28:23] week ago today, she passed away. [music]
[28:26] Um, on Facebook's with my with her only
[28:29] child, my cousin Karen. And, uh, she put
[28:33] on Facebook that she had passed away. um
[28:36] 89 years old. My dad's sister, last uh
[28:40] the last living a or uncle I had. Uh but
[28:45] u so thankful me and Michael got to go
[28:47] visit her a few times when I was going
[28:49] back and forth to see my mom. Amen. And
[28:52] spend some time with her. I was able to
[28:53] stop when we went up in the mountains
[28:55] and minister for brother Nol's pastor,
[28:57] brother Joe Green, in the church there.
[28:59] uh she lived in that town and uh we uh
[29:03] we got to go visit her uh when we went
[29:06] up there, but she moved to a different
[29:08] town
[29:09] away from there. So, I hadn't been able
[29:11] to see her since, but she did pass away.
[29:13] Uh so, please remember the family in
[29:15] prayer. Uh the Lord would just comfort
[29:18] them and bless them. I know Karen's
[29:20] taking it very hard. Karen is a little
[29:22] younger than me. She's in our think
[29:24] early mid-50s. Uh my aunt Joe was 89. A
[29:28] lot like my grandmother and my mom
[29:31] actually. Uh picture health for whole
[29:34] her whole life. Hardly ever went to a
[29:35] doctor. My grandmother hardly ever ever
[29:37] went to a doctor. My mom didn't ever
[29:40] ever hardly ever go to a doctor until
[29:42] she had a stroke. And then uh and then
[29:44] that happened. And my uh my aunt Joe up
[29:48] till a couple years ago, Karen said that
[29:50] she's preacher of health. Never even
[29:51] went to a doctor or anything. we found
[29:53] out she had a a bad heart valve and here
[29:56] two years later then she uh she passed
[29:58] away. So uh I appreciate your prayers
[30:00] for that. Amen.

[30:04] course got a good a good uh if you're
[30:06] watching uh brother and sister Pat, God
[30:08] bless you. But uh got a good report I
[30:10] felt from brother Pat. We had lunch
[30:12] together, me, him, and brother Dennis
[30:13] Thursday. Uh brother Pat said sister
[30:16] Pat's doing a lot better. She's even
[30:17] walking around the house without a
[30:18] walker now even. So still still
[30:21] difficult for them to get up early
[30:23] earlier on a Sunday to get ready to be
[30:25] here in time. Uh so uh they may still
[30:28] probably but we're hoping to see them
[30:30] some more. Sister Pat even talked about
[30:33] hoping to try to get back to church. So
[30:35] we miss them so very much and hope
[30:36] they're able to do that. So please I was
[30:38] so encouraged by that. Amen. So please
[30:41] remember them. So good to see sister
[30:43] Julie here. Amen. God bless you sister.
[30:47] And of course remember prayer too. And
[30:51] Anna and Steve as sister Norman told us
[30:54] the other week that they'll be gone the
[30:56] rest of the year uh till the first of
[30:57] the year. So welcome to December. It's
[30:59] the last month in the year. So, amen.
[31:01] Uh, we uh pretty close to knocking on
[31:04] the door of another year. It's hard to
[31:06] believe, but here we are again. So,
[31:09] appreciate the Lord's goodness. Anyone
[31:11] have a request on your heart? That's all
[31:12] I have here. Does anyone have anything
[31:14] on your heart like mention? [snorts]
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. Thank the Lord for his
[31:20] goodness. Amen.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He is good, brother.
[31:26] That is for sure.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Anyone else? Yes.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. So, let's remember Amanda
[31:37] prayer the surgery that she talked about
[31:40] last week and came on the text that we
[31:42] sent out. So, please remember her.
[31:45] Anyone have an unspoken request? Lord
[31:47] knows all our hearts today. Let's stand
[31:48] to our feet if we could
[31:52] appreciate the Lord's goodness and
[31:53] blessing. Amen. Ask brother Dennis if he
[31:56] would take us pray.
[31:58] Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads, we
[32:01] bow in respect and love towards you,
[32:03] Father. For it's a privilege to once
[32:06] again be in your house of prayer, a
[32:08] house of worship.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that you dwell in the
[32:12] praises of your people.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; If there's a time to rejoice and praise
[32:18] you, it's right now, Father.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Give us Amen. that ability, that desire
[32:24] to do your what is required of a true
[32:29] Christian to pray, to worship, to love
[32:33] one another. Father, we know that the
[32:36] enemy is fighting us harder than ever
[32:38] because he knows that the sands of that
[32:42] hourglass is running out.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[32:45] &gt;&gt; and Lord, it's time THAT WE WAKE UP.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Or we're going to miss it. We're going
[32:51] to
[32:52] put forth uh halfway
[32:56] half sp uh effort in serving you. We're
[33:00] going to find ourselves in that great
[33:03] tribulation.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; It's time to put you first. I heard your
[33:07] prophet your say on a message that we
[33:12] have to give our all to Jesus.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus wants to use us in the way he's
[33:19] called us. If you whistle, good, give
[33:23] that to the Lord. If you um have a
[33:27] desire just to clean the church and and
[33:30] be a help to the believers, give that to
[33:34] the Lord.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[33:35] &gt;&gt; help us to do what you have called us to
[33:39] do. Be humble in our spirit.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; You dwell in the hearts of the humble.
[33:46] And them that are proud, you reject
[33:49] them. And if they don't repent, they're
[33:52] headed to that uh judgment of the lake
[33:56] of fire.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we want to be sincere in our
[34:02] walk with you.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; As I said before, brother Brown was
[34:07] asked, "How do I grow deeper in the love
[34:10] of God?" And he just told him, so
[34:13] simple, read your Bible and pray. Yes,
[34:16] Jesus.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; And Lord, if there's A TIME TO PRAY,
[34:19] IT'S RIGHT NOW. GOD,
[34:20] &gt;&gt; you went to your disciples one time and
[34:23] asked Peter, could you pray with me for
[34:26] one hour?
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And then you said these words, "Father,
[34:30] I know the spirit is willing, but the
[34:32] flesh is weak." [music]
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[34:34] &gt;&gt; give us the overcoming power to DIE TO
[34:38] THE FLESH, die to ourselves, and have a
[34:41] stronger PRAYER LIFE. THERE'S POWER IN
[34:45] THE NAME OF JESUS. WE HAVE TO recognize
[34:48] that when Satan comes in like a flood,
[34:52] you have raised that standard. Greater
[34:54] he is in us than he is in the world.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; God be with us. Who can be against us.
[35:01] Oh Lord, there's several prayer requests
[35:05] this morning. Our precious brethren that
[35:08] need a healing touch. Brother Danny
[35:11] suffering with that pain from the
[35:13] surgery that he went through. Father,
[35:16] &gt;&gt; and
[35:17] brother Newton's aunt Joe that's gone to
[35:21] be with you, Father. The
[35:25] his cousin Karen is going through a hard
[35:27] time losing her mom. Oh Lord, and all
[35:32] the other ones that are sick. I can't
[35:34] remember them, but it's not important.
[35:37] What's important that you heard him
[35:39] request has been metus Lord we call thee
[35:42] on the scene to meet you every need
[35:45] according to your riches and glory
[35:47] &gt;&gt; for thou are a high priest that can be
[35:50] touched by the feelings of our
[35:52] infirmities.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you God.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; And with your strip you are healed. We
[35:56] are are a a family THAT AS WE STAND on
[36:02] your word we believe in your spirit. We
[36:05] believe in in your power. We're are more
[36:08] than conquerors to them that are in
[36:11] Christ Jesus.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, bless our pastor as he
[36:16] labors faithfully to bring forth your
[36:18] word.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Use it to speak to our hearts, Father.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; May your word fall upon our hearts on
[36:26] good ground that we may truly grow in
[36:29] the fullness of the stature of Jesus
[36:32] Christ. Ask God. Granted, Father, in
[36:35] your name we pray, name of the Lord
[36:36] Jesus Christ.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]

[37:06] our regular song book here if you've got
[37:08] one. Amen. We'll have it here. It's
[37:11] somewhat difficult. We got a difficult
[37:14] song to sing. U so pray that uh [music]
[37:19] Lord just bless us now from his glory.
[37:23] I felt since uh we were going to be gone
[37:26] the next two Sundays that uh have a
[37:29] couple of songs that were sort of a u I
[37:33] guess you could say Christmas like
[37:34] maybe. Amen. But this song has been on
[37:37] my heart for a little bit. I sometimes
[37:39] shun from singing it because it's a it's
[37:41] [music] can be quite complicated to sing
[37:43] especially for my limited voice range.
[37:46] But we're going to sing it anyway. Uh we
[37:48] did one time on quarter and me and
[37:50] Michael found a chord to work with. I
[37:52] hope we still get that.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can work with. So, amen.
[37:56] But we're going to sing it for the glory
[37:57] of the Lord today. Amen. [music]
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's sing it.

[43:19] he knew of.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Without reluctance,
[43:24] flesh and blood, he came his substance.
[43:27] He came from glory to become a man to
[43:30] come into this earth to live like you

[43:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[44:00] Let's stand to our feet if we could.
[44:03] Amen.
[44:05] [snorts]
[44:06] Go ahead and change the word of the
[44:08] service now.
[44:10] Amen.
[44:12] Before we do, anyone have a testimony or
[44:14] something on your heart
[44:16] like give to the Lord.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; After so after everybody, I would like
[44:22] to
[44:24] Dennis, your hand was up too.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Um the Lord has been dealing with
[44:29] me about a stronger prayer life.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; And um I I walk with the Lord meditate
[44:35] on the Lord and you know I have my
[44:38] shortcomings physically and I get tired
[44:41] get sore and so forth but the Lord has
[44:44] been telling me to pray more and then
[44:48] different things will come to me and um
[44:52] you know I just want to be sincere and
[44:55] just pray with all my heart and um
[44:59] there's a movie that came out 10 years
[45:01] ago it's called the war room and It's
[45:04] about a woman, a black lady that has a
[45:08] strong prayer life and um uh I just been
[45:14] thinking about that movie and and how we
[45:18] don't have to take anything from the
[45:19] devil.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; We got to just believe the Lord is with
[45:23] us and he can fight the devil and
[45:25] anything he throws at us.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So last night Leah says,
[45:29] "Let's watch a movie
[45:33] uh a CD." And I says, "What would you
[45:37] like to watch?" Well, you picked one up.
[45:38] She picked out the war room.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; And I knew as I watched it last night,
[45:44] &gt;&gt; wow, if I can have half the sincerity of
[45:48] what this lady in this movie is
[45:50] portraying about prayer, I'll be a
[45:53] stronger Christian.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So God, God, we need to
[45:56] increase our prayer lives. Saints always
[45:59] &gt;&gt; we're not going to make it unless we do.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Put God first. Put pray. Medicate on the
[46:06] Lord and he will bless us.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Brother Bram said you can
[46:10] sing too much. He said you can even
[46:11] preach too much. You can never pray too
[46:14] much.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that was an encouragement
[46:17] to let us understand that we all
[46:19] probably fall short in that category.
[46:21] Amen. Did anyone else have something
[46:23] before Sister Roman? Sister,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank everybody for their
[46:26] prayers. I was so nauseous last Sunday.
[46:29] It started Friday or Saturday and lasted
[46:32] until Thursday. So, I
[46:34] &gt;&gt; there was an assignment that I had that
[46:36] I didn't finish and didn't quite finish
[46:39] my final. So, it was I don't know what
[46:42] it was, but thank you all for praying.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord for taking care of it.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Just
[46:49] glad you're feeling better. [snorts]
[46:50] Praise the Lord.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's miserable. Know
[46:54] that. Wow.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; If it's miserable for an hour or two,
[46:57] which I've had before, I can't imagine
[46:59] that many days.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Anyone else think?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Looks like you want to go last.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, I did.
[47:08] It's kind of strange, but it's But
[47:12] anyways, that was a little dog that came
[47:14] in our yard and um we didn't feed it at
[47:19] first because
[47:21] you know, I thought he go home and uh he
[47:25] would go in and out in the gate
[47:28] here. And he was telling me when I got
[47:32] close to him, he was scared. He was
[47:35] lonely.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And um
[47:40] I would give him food
[47:43] and he would eat it. He was happy to eat
[47:45] it.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And
[47:48] I adopted to speak
[47:51] &gt;&gt; and he got picky.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; He got
[48:00] &gt;&gt; you like that.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; You were once lost. You were scared.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; You were afraid. But I loved you. Took
[48:10] you in.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; I saved you.
[48:14] But your blackness.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; I used to always and praying with God
[48:20] coming to church or even going grocery
[48:23] stores
[48:24] &gt;&gt; and I stopped doing that
[48:27] &gt;&gt; and I need to do that again. I sang all
[48:30] [snorts] the church
[48:31] &gt;&gt; again and as soon as I came in this
[48:35] &gt;&gt; sanctuary I just oh my pres
[48:44] singing in my car
[48:47] &gt;&gt; so because we invite the Lord
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen
[48:52] atmosphere.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That atmosphere
[48:56] create that atmosphere. Amen. Praise the
[48:59] Lord. Wonderful. You create it in car.
[49:01] You create it in your home. You create
[49:03] it your job. You create it in the
[49:04] supermarket. You and of course here.
[49:08] Amen. Most definitely. Praise the Lord.
[49:10] So that's wonderful. Glory to God. It's
[49:13] great.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Anyone else? I know she want to go last,
[49:16] but something may come on somebody else.
[49:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. If not, let's
[49:22] just uh we'll go over to our to the
[49:24] scripture now.
[49:27] [cough] Excuse me. We're going to we're
[49:28] just going to start with Ephesians this
[49:30] time. [clears throat]
[49:32] We're still on adoption. Um
[49:37] this is adoption part 33, five-fold
[49:39] ministry part six. Uh but we're just
[49:42] going to go over to Ephesians and read
[49:44] there and uh forego the scripture
[49:46] reading from uh Romans 8. We'll just
[49:49] start in Ephesians today. Amen. So we'll
[49:52] go go to Ephesians chapter 4. We're just
[49:54] going to read a couple of verses like we
[49:56] did last week.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[49:57] &gt;&gt; uh verses uh 11 123.
[50:00] Amen. We're going to talk about prophets
[50:02] today and probably won't get done with
[50:04] it today, but uh the the prophets
[50:07] probably actually even more extensive, I
[50:11] guess, than than the apostles that we
[50:13] had last week. Uh and probably more so
[50:17] than any of the others. So, but uh we'll
[50:19] get into that. Let's just bow our heads
[50:22] for a word of prayer if we could. Lord
[50:23] Jesus, again, we're very thankful,
[50:25] Father, of your blessings, your love to
[50:27] us. So thankful, Father, the
[50:29] testimonies, Lord. So thankful of what
[50:32] you're doing in our lives. As Art said,
[50:34] you are so good, Lord.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You're so good to us, Lord. As Julie
[50:37] said, you are our healer, Father. We
[50:40] know that you're our healer. And as
[50:41] Sister Norman, Brother Dennis said, God,
[50:43] we need more of you. More and more of
[50:45] you. But Lord, we got to understand the
[50:48] way that we get more of you is to give
[50:50] more of ourselves to you, Lord.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Oh God. and relinquish ourselves, our
[50:54] ideas, thoughts, opinions, feelings.
[50:56] God, just give it all into your hands,
[50:58] Lord. That's how we grow closer to you.
[51:01] That's how we become more like you,
[51:02] Lord.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Want to get closer to
[51:05] God? Read your Bible and pray, Lord, and
[51:07] help us to be able to do that, Lord, and
[51:10] to reveal it to us, to show to us, God,
[51:12] in that place that we want to be, that
[51:14] we need to get to, Lord. It's in our
[51:16] lives, God. It's in our hearts. It's our
[51:18] desire, God, to serve you, to live for
[51:21] you, Father. We know that your coming is
[51:23] imminent, Lord. We know, God, that cup
[51:27] of iniquity has got to be reaching the
[51:29] brim. That that that doomsday clock,
[51:32] it's got to be close to midnight, Lord.
[51:34] God, we're just looking for our loved
[51:36] ones to appear at any time, Lord, for
[51:38] those loved ones to come forth, Lord,
[51:40] and show themselves, God, just entering
[51:43] into that place of rapture, Lord. God,
[51:46] let us enter into that atmosphere of
[51:48] rapture. Father, even in this service
[51:50] today, as you come, Lord, as you are
[51:52] here, Lord, to en rapture us into your
[51:55] word, Lord, into your spirit, reveal to
[51:58] us in that what you'd have us to see and
[52:00] know, God. Lord, speak through these
[52:02] lips the words you'd have us to hear,
[52:04] God, and shut it to anything that would
[52:06] not be according to your perfect will to
[52:08] be said today, God. And may you anoint
[52:10] our ears. May we receive that word,
[52:12] Lord, and not return void, God, but
[52:14] accomplish in each of us that you sent
[52:16] it forth for. We commit ourselves to
[52:18] you. Ask your blessings on the remaining
[52:20] part of this service, Lord, now and
[52:22] speak to us, Father, I pray, from your
[52:24] word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] Ephesians chapter
[52:30] 4,
[52:31] just read 1121 13. Let you be seated
[52:34] now. And he gave some apostles and some
[52:36] prophets, some evangelists and some
[52:39] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[52:41] of the saints, for the work of the
[52:43] ministry, for the edifying of the body
[52:45] of Christ, till we all come in the unity
[52:48] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[52:50] son of God unto a perfect man to the
[52:53] measure of the stature of the fullness
[52:55] of Christ. You can be seated if you'd
[52:57] like.
[52:59] Amen.
[53:01] The [snorts] second one here as uh we
[53:03] just read we went into the apostilhip
[53:06] last week or uh um missionaries as was
[53:10] called. We recognize a missionary
[53:11] apostle being the same thing.
[53:15] The definition of those two terms is uh
[53:18] rings the same one cent. But the second
[53:20] part of this that we want to give we're
[53:21] just following along the lines of
[53:24] apostles now prophets. Uh the prophet uh
[53:28] the prophet ministry is probably one of
[53:31] the most if not the most misunderstood
[53:35] offices of these five. Amen. There's of
[53:38] course the spiritual gifts that we know
[53:40] in 1 Corinthians 12. But as far as the
[53:43] five-fold ministry goes, that prophet is
[53:46] probably again I believe is the most
[53:49] misunderstood of of all of those five uh
[53:53] that five-fold ministry. Uh a lot of
[53:56] times people get uh the prophecy of the
[53:59] thing. Well, most of the time what what
[54:01] happens is people get the gift of
[54:03] prophecy and a prophet uh mixed up. Uh
[54:08] they get they think because somebody may
[54:10] have a gift of prophecy does not mean
[54:13] they have uh uh that they are a prophet
[54:17] is in the sense of being a word prophet
[54:19] or a ministering prophet. Right? um that
[54:24] brother Random breaks it down into a c
[54:26] in two categories which we're doing
[54:28] right now which it basically is in two
[54:30] different categories but uh but I I I
[54:34] almost I I put a subcategory in that
[54:37] category because there's uh there's
[54:42] a gift of prophecy which we'll probably
[54:45] get to when we go through the gifts but
[54:47] there's a gift of prophecy that can fall
[54:49] on anybody at any time. Right.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; That gift of prophecy uh could follow on
[54:54] brother Dennis today. It could fall on
[54:56] brother Art tomorrow. It could follow
[54:57] Micah the next day. It could fall on
[54:59] sister Sheiley or sister Norma or any of
[55:01] you sisters. Uh a gift of prophecy is
[55:04] just that. It's a gift, right?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; It's a temporal gift that can be on a
[55:09] person one second, on somebody else the
[55:10] next. Uh it's just a gift and that's all
[55:13] it is. But a ministering prophet is a is
[55:16] a is a person that has the gift of
[55:19] prophecy but also uh I is a ministering
[55:24] gift of prophecy that puts them into
[55:26] place. Now that position
[55:29] uh uh negates uh a woman fulfilling a
[55:34] woman can be a prophetess or have a gift
[55:36] of prophecy but cannot be in a
[55:39] ministering office of prophecy. Amen.
[55:42] Amen. So the ministering gift of
[55:45] prophecy is is more or less my sub my
[55:49] subcategory of a word prophet. As we
[55:52] know, brother Brham talked about a word
[55:54] prophet. Uh brother Green brought out
[55:57] that that actual word many times that
[55:59] that phrase word prophet many times and
[56:02] brother Bram talked about being a word
[56:04] prophet. A word prophet to me is even
[56:07] someone that's separated even from that
[56:10] uh of ministering prophet or gift of
[56:12] prophecy. A word prophet is someone who
[56:15] is foretold in the scripture that that
[56:18] they are going to come and that they are
[56:20] going to have this gift in their lives.
[56:22] Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Now in our Leodysian church age from the
[56:26] time that uh uh Isuza street the
[56:28] restoration of the gifts uh a lot of
[56:31] prophecy has happened a lot of people
[56:32] prophesying. you listen to brother
[56:34] Brandham's tapes and before uh people
[56:37] got to where they understood how to
[56:39] operate it which brother Brandham tried
[56:42] to do of course it still happened in the
[56:44] later years even when he would go out
[56:45] from the tabernacle to different places
[56:48] around the country you could still
[56:50] listen on tape and in the middle of
[56:52] brother Brandham's PREACHING THEY'LL
[56:53] STAND UP AND START prophesying
[56:56] &gt;&gt; and that's wrong we know that those
[56:58] gifts have to be in order and when a and
[57:00] when the man has the the the Holy Spirit
[57:03] is operating the gift of ministry at
[57:05] that time that that ministering gift has
[57:07] the priority. Amen. If anybody has a
[57:10] gift of tongues, if they have a gift of
[57:12] prophecy or something interpretation or
[57:14] something that has to wait, that has to
[57:17] be set aside while the Holy Spirit is
[57:20] operating in this capacity. Amen. Not in
[57:23] that capacity. But you can still hear
[57:25] people getting up and prophesying. Well,
[57:27] that's that's merely the gift of
[57:29] prophecy. Amen. It's just because a
[57:32] gift. Now uh that gift of prophecy would
[57:34] be on a ministering prophet as well and
[57:37] it would be on a word prophet as well.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; But see in all of the prophecies and all
[57:44] the things you've heard, you may have
[57:45] been in services. I imagine most of us
[57:48] have probably been in services where
[57:50] you've heard a prophecy given where
[57:52] someone would stand up with a gift of
[57:54] prophecy and prophesy something.
[57:56] [snorts] Amen. And give a prophecy for
[57:59] them. But that gift can be on anybody at
[58:02] any time, man or woman.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; But a word prophet is a is a
[58:08] generational it is a it is a church
[58:11] agegiven man.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That has that ministering gift of
[58:17] prophecy, but is a word prophet foretold
[58:20] in the scripture. Yes. There's
[58:22] thousands, tens of thousands, maybe min
[58:25] uh millions of prophecies that's gone
[58:27] out since Isuza Street that's been
[58:29] prophesied, BUT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE
[58:32] word prophet.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Only one. And there will only be one
[58:36] word prophet and his name is William
[58:38] Marian Brown.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was that word prophet FROM THE
[58:42] SCRIPTURE FORETOLD TO US BY THE
[58:45] scripture that he would come to this day
[58:47] and do what he did and we receive it and
[58:50] accept it as such. Now that word prophet
[58:53] brings into it brings into light all the
[58:56] things that that age needs those people
[58:58] need uh to get closer to God. uh in in
[59:03] the day of Jeremiah, which we're going
[59:04] to get which we're going to read here in
[59:06] just a minute, uh it was to try to bring
[59:08] the people together, try to get the
[59:10] people back to God, the the Israelites
[59:12] had gotten away from God. It got to
[59:14] where uh the things that they did that
[59:16] was actually God-given became a stink in
[59:19] God's nose because it became a formality
[59:21] to those people. Right.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; And Jeremiah was there known as the
[59:25] weeping prophet.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh, and I imagine uh like brother
[59:28] Brandham said on tape, he said, "I go
[59:31] around the country and I preach as hard
[59:33] as I can preach. I give my time, I give
[59:35] my effort, I give my my energy, I give
[59:37] my prayer, I give everything to to
[59:39] trying to minister to help these people
[59:41] and to and to uh uh counsel them and
[59:44] talk to them." He said, "And every TIME
[59:46] I SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IT'S WORSE
[59:48] THAN IT WAS THE last time I was there."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "And one time, Brother Brham
[59:53] was ready to quit."
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "They don't listen to me.
[59:56] They don't want to hear me. Then I'll
[59:58] just stay at home."
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, that didn't last long
[1:00:02] because God told him better. Uh God
[1:00:04] showed him better. So, that didn't last
[1:00:06] very long. He wasn't off the field very
[1:00:08] long. God said, "You better get back to
[1:00:09] what I told you to do."
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he did. Amen. He He did. He
[1:00:14] wasn't off the field very long. But you
[1:00:15] can see how someone like a Jeremiah
[1:00:18] could be a weeping prophet to give
[1:00:20] everything to to be vindicated by God.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. that God is using you. You are his
[1:00:26] mouthpiece. That God is using you and
[1:00:29] still to be ridiculed and put down and
[1:00:31] ignored and not paid attention to and
[1:00:34] just going on about the ungodly ways
[1:00:36] that they were doing.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; No wonder he was a weeping prophet. I
[1:00:39] would be too,
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; right? You don't see any help. You don't
[1:00:42] see any encouragement. You don't see any
[1:00:44] uh advancement. You don't see anybody
[1:00:46] getting closer to God. in fact worse
[1:00:48] than getting a getting further away from
[1:00:50] God and becoming worse and and and
[1:00:53] everything that they do be getting more
[1:00:55] and more away from God.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like I said uh the other day
[1:00:59] uh brother said you you start missing
[1:01:02] church and you miss a service or two and
[1:01:04] pretty soon it's easier to miss the next
[1:01:06] and pretty soon it's easier to miss the
[1:01:07] next. Pretty soon it's easier to miss
[1:01:08] the next. Probably goes with streaming
[1:01:10] too maybe. I don't know how many
[1:01:12] people's watching now but it could be
[1:01:13] the same with streaming. You can be
[1:01:15] faithful to streaming and miss one and
[1:01:18] miss another and and then you think,
[1:01:19] well, I'll go back and watch it later.
[1:01:21] And then maybe you don't, maybe you do,
[1:01:23] maybe you don't,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; you know, and then it just get kind of
[1:01:25] loose and and then you you just that
[1:01:28] that that
[1:01:30] slide is like is like skiing. Uh once
[1:01:34] you get going down a hill, it's hard to
[1:01:35] stop.
[1:01:37] Your skis are waxed up and uh they're
[1:01:40] pointed forward. You're going to go down
[1:01:41] that hill and you just keep going and
[1:01:44] keep going and keep going before you
[1:01:45] know it, you're further away from God
[1:01:46] than you ever thought. You say, "Where?
[1:01:48] Where am I? How did I get here?"
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Uh it started with that one time. Yes.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; It started with that one day.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Jeremiah became that
[1:01:57] weeping prophet because everything he
[1:02:00] said, everything he did, nothing
[1:02:01] mattered. Nobody cared. Right.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jeremiah was a word prophet.
[1:02:05] Yes.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a word prophet.
[1:02:07] Let's look and see what God said about
[1:02:09] Jeremiah. See what God told Jeremiah
[1:02:12] here.
[1:02:15] Amen. I want I'm going to read this. I
[1:02:17] got this quote I want to read, too. But
[1:02:19] [snorts]
[1:02:20] in Jeremiah chapter 1,
[1:02:23] so we can see the difference in a word
[1:02:26] prophet and someone with a prophetic
[1:02:28] gift or the the ministering prophet.
[1:02:32] Now, now, as I said, as you're going to
[1:02:35] Jeremiah 1, I put that subcategory in
[1:02:39] there because
[1:02:42] uh there there's a gift of prophecy, and
[1:02:44] that's that's just on its own. That's
[1:02:46] that's over here. Set aside 1
[1:02:48] Corinthians 12. We go read it. We'll
[1:02:50] probably do it in the near future, but
[1:02:52] it's a gift of prophecy. That's that's
[1:02:53] in its little neat bubble. That's it.
[1:02:55] You know, again, like we said, that gift
[1:02:58] can fall on anybody,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; right? that fault that that gift of
[1:03:01] prophecy can come down. Now, you got to
[1:03:03] make sure though
[1:03:06] a prophecy is not just quoting
[1:03:08] scripture.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; A a a prophecy is not getting up and
[1:03:12] just shouting out, "God loves you."
[1:03:14] Well, the Bible tells us that.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; You don't get up and just say, "WELL,
[1:03:18] GOD'S COMING SOON." WELL, we all know
[1:03:20] that. The Bible says that.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; He's a good God. He We all know that.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can bring scripture. E even I'
[1:03:29] I've heard prophecy come or people
[1:03:31] pretend it to be prophecy. I don't
[1:03:33] consider it prophecy. Brother Brandham
[1:03:35] didn't either. If you go listen to the
[1:03:36] message, brother Brandham said that's
[1:03:37] not a prophecy.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. A prophecy is something that
[1:03:41] foretells, which we'll read here in just
[1:03:43] a minute. But I've even heard people
[1:03:45] come and say, "Well, uh they had this
[1:03:47] experience and saw such and such." And
[1:03:49] and I've heard them say that. I sit
[1:03:51] there thinking, "What prophecy is there
[1:03:54] to that? We already know that." Amen. So
[1:03:57] if you come to prophesy on a prophecy,
[1:04:00] it's not a prophecy. The prophecy's
[1:04:02] already been brought forth. YOU CAN
[1:04:04] REITERATE that prophecy, but don't give
[1:04:05] it to me like you're prophesying it
[1:04:07] because I already know. It's already
[1:04:09] been prophesied. God already God already
[1:04:12] told through brother Brandham these
[1:04:13] things and we know. Amen. So to to
[1:04:16] prophesy what the word already tells us
[1:04:18] is not a prophecy,
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; right? to prophesy what has already been
[1:04:22] prophesied that we know vindicated by a
[1:04:24] prophet by a word prophet we know is a
[1:04:27] prophet is not a prophecy
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; right
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; you may reiterate that amen we know the
[1:04:33] country is going to be burnt border to
[1:04:35] border coast to coast we already know
[1:04:36] that
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; amen I don't need to you can reiterate I
[1:04:40] can retell you that you can tell that to
[1:04:41] one another that's fine but that doesn't
[1:04:43] make it prophecy because it's already
[1:04:45] been prophesied you see but that gift of
[1:04:48] prophecy now it's all setside side. It's
[1:04:50] It's a neat little thing. It's a gift.
[1:04:51] Can fall on anybody any time. Amen. Uh
[1:04:54] usually usually it tends to be Now,
[1:04:58] Brother Ram said it could fall on
[1:05:00] anybody at any time. Yes. And it can,
[1:05:02] but usually it tends to be a person that
[1:05:06] has that gift. Uh just like if someone
[1:05:09] has the gift of speaking in tongues or
[1:05:12] the gift of wisdom, uh the gift of
[1:05:14] knowledge, it it usually tends to be uh
[1:05:18] God's entrusted certain people with
[1:05:21] those gifts. Amen. Uh gift of prophecy
[1:05:24] the same way. But
[1:05:26] realistically speaking, it can fall on
[1:05:28] anybody at any time. Anybody here can
[1:05:31] fall on me, any of us to give a prophecy
[1:05:34] at any time for whatever reason it may
[1:05:37] be. And that's on its own. That's that
[1:05:38] gift of prophecy. But now the where I
[1:05:41] get the subcategory is is there is a
[1:05:44] difference between a ministering prophet
[1:05:47] and a word prophet. Amen. Now the word
[1:05:50] prophet is a ministering prophet. I hope
[1:05:55] this doesn't confuse you. Uh a a word
[1:05:58] prophet is a ministering prophet. He
[1:06:00] fulfills that that office of prophet in
[1:06:03] the script in what we just read
[1:06:04] Ephesians 4. That word prophet is a
[1:06:07] ministering prophet, but not every
[1:06:10] ministering prophet is a word prophet.
[1:06:13] Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That does that make sense?
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, every every tissue is tissue,
[1:06:19] but not every tissue is Kleenex.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every thumb is a finger, but not
[1:06:25] every finger is a thumb.
[1:06:27] Ev every ministering prophet is a
[1:06:30] ministering prophet, but not every
[1:06:32] ministering prophet is a word prophet.
[1:06:34] But every word prophet is a ministering
[1:06:36] prophet. Amen. Praise the Lord. I hope
[1:06:39] that makes sense. So, you see where I
[1:06:41] got my subcategory. I I don't separate
[1:06:44] them because they're they're basically
[1:06:45] in the same in the same category, but uh
[1:06:48] they are two different people. Amen. Two
[1:06:51] different offices, if you will. Praise
[1:06:54] the Lord. So, let's see what Jeremiah uh
[1:06:57] maybe we'll turn Jeremiah 1. Uh let's
[1:07:00] start with verse four.
[1:07:02] Jeremiah 1:4. Then the word of the Lord
[1:07:04] came unto me, saying, Before I formed
[1:07:08] thee in the belly, I knew thee.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Before I even formed you in the belly.
[1:07:14] Now, who did it? Was it because of mom
[1:07:17] and daddy? No, it's cuz God did it.
[1:07:20] Remember what brother Ram told Brother
[1:07:22] Green?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Graham told Brother Green that
[1:07:25] he had uh Brother Green's mother and
[1:07:28] daddy come from these places and here
[1:07:30] and there and bring them together so
[1:07:31] that they would breed you. And he used
[1:07:34] the word breed like a cow
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; or horse to breed you.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God does.
[1:07:44] That's that's why I look at my family
[1:07:46] and of course my son and my daughter and
[1:07:49] and even grandchildren. Look, God does
[1:07:51] this for a a purpose. He brings them
[1:07:53] together for a reason. God sent me over
[1:07:55] 2,000 miles to come to to find her. And
[1:07:59] and again, one of these days, not during
[1:08:01] church, uh all the miracles that took
[1:08:05] place to bring me and her together, it
[1:08:08] was just a miracle. It's the easiest way
[1:08:10] to put it, but anyway, brought them
[1:08:12] together to bring them. SO WHEN SO WHEN
[1:08:14] GOD says before I before I formed thee
[1:08:18] in the belly, I knew thee, that's God's
[1:08:20] doing. Amen. We're just playing the part
[1:08:24] to bring what his purpose is in this
[1:08:26] world, in our lives to pass. We're just
[1:08:28] we're just here to try to help be his
[1:08:31] instruments to bring that to pass.
[1:08:34] And obviously, of course, Jeremiah
[1:08:37] had instruments in his mother and daddy
[1:08:39] to come forth to bre Jeremiah to bring
[1:08:42] him forth before. BUT GOD SAID, "BEFORE
[1:08:44] I FORMED thee in the belly, I knew thee.
[1:08:47] and before thou camest forth out of the
[1:08:49] womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained
[1:08:52] thee a prophet unto the nations.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is an ordination from God.
[1:09:00] That's God's doing. When God does that,
[1:09:03] just like God did uh with our current
[1:09:05] prophet, word prophet that we know of
[1:09:08] that uh that God sent to us, brother
[1:09:11] Brandham, we know in the same way and
[1:09:13] what God did in that circumstance, in
[1:09:16] that situation to bring us together.
[1:09:18] Now, Jeremiah, as we were saying, was
[1:09:22] that weeping prophet to bring these uh
[1:09:24] the bring the Israelites, bring them all
[1:09:26] back together, to try to organize them
[1:09:28] back to God, bring them back to puress
[1:09:31] and holiness and righteousness and the
[1:09:34] and and in the instruments that God gave
[1:09:36] them from the heart, from desire.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not formality, not because they
[1:09:42] had to or forced to, but because of
[1:09:44] desire. Because it was in their heart to
[1:09:47] do it. God wanted them all to come back
[1:09:49] to him. They had left from serving him
[1:09:52] and they wanted to bring back. Well, the
[1:09:54] word today was for the same purpose. It
[1:09:57] was to bring, of course, through the
[1:09:58] church ages, all the truths back up,
[1:10:00] bring them all back together. Bring a
[1:10:02] word to a people by a spirit that would
[1:10:05] bring us all together. Now, there wasn't
[1:10:07] to be a rapture then, but today there
[1:10:10] was a prophet to come to bring that
[1:10:12] word, to bring these people, us all
[1:10:14] together, TO BRING A rapture about.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; TO BRING ABOUT A BODY CHANGE. And each
[1:10:20] one is chosen for THAT PURPOSE. AS GOD
[1:10:23] chose Jeremiah and said, I [snorts]
[1:10:25] formed thee, I knew thee, I sanctified,
[1:10:28] ordained thee a prophet to the nations.
[1:10:30] He did the same thing for our prophet
[1:10:32] that WE KNOW FOR THAT PURPOSE. And now
[1:10:35] for our purpose today.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's why God told him to lay up that
[1:10:40] food in the storehouse so that we'll be
[1:10:41] able to feast on that food anytime we
[1:10:44] want to.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. To partake of that food anytime
[1:10:47] that we want to because that food is
[1:10:49] life to us.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; It's lifegiving substance.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And God wants us to to
[1:10:56] to uh partake of that just as he did
[1:10:58] Jeremiah. See, now that's a word
[1:11:00] prophet. Amen. gift to prophecy or even
[1:11:03] a ministering gift is still ordained by
[1:11:06] God but it's a little again if I could
[1:11:10] say subcategory from that amen as this
[1:11:13] prophet or this ministering prophet is
[1:11:16] so we won't talk about today or uh next
[1:11:21] uh next time we won't talk about so much
[1:11:23] the gift of prophecy amen that can fall
[1:11:26] on anybody any time 1 Corinthians 12 but
[1:11:29] we'll talk about the the uh the the
[1:11:32] ministering prophet and word prophet.
[1:11:35] Amen. And and how those gifts mesh and
[1:11:38] come together. I got some scripture of
[1:11:40] course to read and make sure that we
[1:11:42] find that in the word of God.
[1:11:45] Now I want to go to this quote, read
[1:11:47] this to you before we move on.
[1:11:50] Amen. [clears throat]
[1:11:52] And greater than Solomon is here.
[1:11:56] Now make now maybe you can it makes a
[1:11:59] little more sense why in my opinion this
[1:12:01] is probably the most misunderstood gift
[1:12:02] of all of them.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it it really uh when
[1:12:07] people come in to try to be a word
[1:12:10] prophet. There was only one of those.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was brother Brandham. There's
[1:12:15] not going to be another word prophet. I
[1:12:17] know brother Brandham said I may be
[1:12:18] laying the platform and blah blah blah.
[1:12:20] He was always just being humble and
[1:12:22] contrite and trying to throw it off and
[1:12:24] not, you know, make him. But he knew
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and we knew. He was it. He was the man.
[1:12:30] It wasn't Jo. It wasn't to be Joseph.
[1:12:32] God bless his heart. It wasn't to be
[1:12:35] Joseph. Amen. I know he talked about his
[1:12:37] laying down his Bible, Joseph picking it
[1:12:39] up one day and all those things. Uh that
[1:12:43] to me,
[1:12:45] not to take anything away from Joseph,
[1:12:47] but to me that's just a man. I I had the
[1:12:51] same desire in my heart for my son.
[1:12:53] Let's just say that. I as a dad, I had I
[1:12:57] had the same desire in my heart for my
[1:12:58] son. I had that same desire in MY HEART
[1:13:01] FOR MY GRANDSON.
[1:13:03] To me, it was a it wasn't a prophecy. It
[1:13:06] was a dad's desire
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; to see his son pick up the Bible and
[1:13:10] move on with it. He knew because of his
[1:13:12] he knew because of uh uh Billy Paul's
[1:13:15] marital situation that he wasn't going
[1:13:16] to be able to do it. So he was hoping
[1:13:18] his son Joseph would be able to do it.
[1:13:20] Amen. That doesn't make Jo now he said I
[1:13:23] believe Joseph was a prophet but in what
[1:13:25] way? Not a word prophet. He wasn't there
[1:13:28] to take his daddy's place. It was only
[1:13:30] to be one.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And his brother Brown and that's it.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And there's nobody else to be it.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not God. You don't baptize in
[1:13:39] his name. Amen. But the message that he
[1:13:42] brought was to bring a bride to Christ.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring to to bring a bride to
[1:13:47] the place of rapturing faith.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; And that's that was the job he did. And
[1:13:50] when that job was finished, God took him
[1:13:52] home.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the story. But we continue on.
[1:13:56] We continue to press this battle. We
[1:13:58] continue to feed off of this word. We
[1:14:00] continue to let that word minister to
[1:14:02] our hearts because of that word prophet.
[1:14:05] Anybody else come up and try to proclaim
[1:14:07] to be that they are taking brother
[1:14:10] Baron's place or they are a word prophet
[1:14:12] or something you know right away that
[1:14:15] that's wrong
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; because that he was there's only one to
[1:14:19] Leo to see it was him and that's it
[1:14:21] that's and there aren't going to be
[1:14:23] anymore because there's not any more
[1:14:24] ages
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; this is going to be the end of it
[1:14:27] [snorts] now in greater than Solomon he
[1:14:30] said a prophet is a seer who sees the
[1:14:34] people's hearts and foretells the things
[1:14:36] that's coming to pass. Now you see why
[1:14:39] if you just get up and quote scripture
[1:14:41] or if you just get up and quote somebody
[1:14:43] or quote a prophecy that's already
[1:14:45] actually been prophesied. It might be
[1:14:47] foretelling a future event but it's
[1:14:49] already been prophesied like brother
[1:14:51] Brandham told us it would if I came up
[1:14:54] here today and I and I said that you
[1:14:57] know cars are going to be eggs well
[1:14:58] shaped like eggs. Well duh
[1:15:01] that's not a prophecy. Amen. When
[1:15:04] brother Brandham did it, it was a
[1:15:06] prophecy.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; To repeat that is just being repetitive.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But a prophet is a seer who sees
[1:15:15] the people's hearts and foretells the
[1:15:18] things that's coming to pass. It's a
[1:15:20] future thing that a prophet can look
[1:15:22] ahead that God can show him ahead. Now
[1:15:26] whether it's a vision, whether it's in a
[1:15:28] dream or [clears throat]
[1:15:31] in whatever capacity God would show it
[1:15:33] to them in, that's usually typically the
[1:15:35] two, a vision or a dream to show them
[1:15:37] these things to actually see it. Now,
[1:15:39] God can actually give a prophecy just as
[1:15:42] an utterance to your heart like it would
[1:15:44] be um tongues uh or interpretation or
[1:15:48] something like you don't have to see it.
[1:15:50] Amen. It's an utterance that God would
[1:15:52] give you as a prophecy falls and says,
[1:15:54] "Thus sayeth the Lord, so and so is
[1:15:56] going to happen." Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:15:58] so and so a person, this is going to be
[1:16:02] uh you or something. See, then that's a
[1:16:04] prophecy,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; But you know, again, to get up and say
[1:16:08] God loves you or just quote scripture,
[1:16:10] that's not prophecy, right?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; If someone brings it as prophecy, uh uh
[1:16:14] they're wrong. Now, if someone comes and
[1:16:16] and brings prophecy of of a future thing
[1:16:20] or something that doesn't happen, Amen.
[1:16:23] then, Brother Bram said that person's
[1:16:26] influenced by the evil spirit,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And that person needs to come before the
[1:16:30] church to be prayed for to pray that
[1:16:32] devil off of them.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people are out there following
[1:16:39] other prophets and trust me saints that
[1:16:42] uh from what I've heard I don't follow
[1:16:44] them. I don't know their names. I don't
[1:16:46] know anything about but from what I've
[1:16:48] heard there's thousands of them out
[1:16:50] there now.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; They're on YouTube and on TV and on
[1:16:53] every place else. Again, I don't hear
[1:16:55] them. I don't know them. Uh I I used to
[1:16:58] get snippets once in a while from Sister
[1:17:00] Matise, but uh that ended. But uh I I
[1:17:04] never watched them. she'd send them and
[1:17:06] and I I've told her many times, I'm not
[1:17:08] interested. I this is a waste of my
[1:17:10] time. You know, I'm just not interested.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And of course,
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; I I don't know of one of them that was
[1:17:18] told that ever came to pass, right?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Most of them had time frames on them and
[1:17:21] none of them I ever know come to pass.
[1:17:23] Those people and then they just keep
[1:17:25] prophesying stuff. You know, I mean, say
[1:17:28] if you throw spaghetti against the wall,
[1:17:30] something's eventually going to stick.
[1:17:33] You keep prophesying over and over stuff
[1:17:35] all left and right, eventually you're
[1:17:37] going to hit something
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; and you come up and say, "Well, there's
[1:17:40] a famous woman that's going to die
[1:17:42] tomorrow."
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:17:45] that could be a that could be a hundred
[1:17:47] thousand different women famous women
[1:17:49] around the world. Uh, you know, you
[1:17:52] know, if you want to be a word prophet,
[1:17:55] tell me their name.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Tell me what disease they have. Tell me
[1:17:59] where they live. Tell me their address.
[1:18:02] Amen. Like a word prophet does.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; And and then then we might have a
[1:18:07] discussion. Of course, then if it
[1:18:09] doesn't come to pass, but see, it's got
[1:18:10] to come to pass. Got to be a future
[1:18:12] event. Again, seeing the people's hearts
[1:18:15] foretell the things that's to come to
[1:18:17] pass. And now there's a gift of
[1:18:20] prophecy. Now, Brother Brandham's
[1:18:22] breaking the two apart. There's a gift
[1:18:24] of prophecy that's in the church with
[1:18:26] the local members. it falls upon any of
[1:18:30] them as we said they give a prophecy
[1:18:34] then it cannot be received but look now
[1:18:37] a gift of prophecy which we didn't get
[1:18:39] into
[1:18:41] just because we're not really talking
[1:18:42] the gift of prophecy but in this quote
[1:18:44] let's just read it then as a gift of
[1:18:47] prophecy then it cannot be received to
[1:18:49] the church until it's to be judged by
[1:18:53] two or three witnesses
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; right
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; amen two or three godly people holy
[1:18:57] ghost people, gifted people to to stand
[1:19:01] in judgment of that prophecy to believe
[1:19:03] whether it's of God or not. Amen. Uh
[1:19:06] back in the Old Testament, they had what
[1:19:08] they called the Gurman Thumbum,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. They would put that up. If the
[1:19:11] lights lit up, then you would know it's
[1:19:13] of God. If it didn't, then that person
[1:19:14] was a liar,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Well, we had the Holy
[1:19:18] Ghost today. The Holy Ghost is here
[1:19:20] working in his people. And if the Holy
[1:19:23] Ghost working in us looks at it and
[1:19:25] believes that to be of God and there's
[1:19:28] uh two or three witnesses, then then
[1:19:30] that uh that validates that prophecy,
[1:19:33] right?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then what do you do? You wait for
[1:19:36] that prophecy to come to pass. You wait
[1:19:38] for it to happen. Maybe it could be
[1:19:40] something as simple as uh somebody stand
[1:19:42] up and say, you know, brother Dennis,
[1:19:44] don't don't go down river today because
[1:19:47] uh at Campbell, there's a truck going to
[1:19:49] come and hit you and kill you. You know,
[1:19:52] avoid that. Don't go that way. Go around
[1:19:56] Orange Grove and Sunrise or Skyline. Go
[1:19:59] a different way. Amen. That would be a
[1:20:01] prophecy to help,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if that's if that's of God,
[1:20:06] then you can see that that could be so.
[1:20:09] Amen. Maybe you read on the news later
[1:20:12] or hear that uh a truck hit a car at
[1:20:16] River and Campbell,
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And killed somebody, but it wasn't
[1:20:20] brother DENNIS BECAUSE A PROPHECY CAME
[1:20:22] forth and said, "Don't you go that way."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that that would be a a f a
[1:20:29] thing of telling a future event. see
[1:20:31] something that could be judged by two or
[1:20:33] three people. He said now it had to be
[1:20:36] judged by two or three witnesses and
[1:20:37] then they have to put their seal on that
[1:20:40] to say that it is of God. Then they have
[1:20:44] to watch to see. Now remember,
[1:20:47] can I bring up this example? uh when
[1:20:50] when um Sister Shakaren was sick and
[1:20:54] dying
[1:20:56] and they were in a meeting in California
[1:21:00] and brother Brandham and and and Billy
[1:21:02] Paul and all these people stood up and
[1:21:05] prophesied. I forgot how many but it was
[1:21:07] it was a few people got up and
[1:21:09] prophesied
[1:21:11] sister thus SAYETH THE LORD THOU SHALT
[1:21:14] NOT DIE BUT THOU SHALT LIVE GOOD LONG
[1:21:17] healthy life and stuff like that two or
[1:21:19] three two or three I'm getting them now
[1:21:21] whether they were judged and found to be
[1:21:23] of God uh brother Ram doesn't say it's
[1:21:26] not on tape but we assume that in that
[1:21:31] situation that it was accepted and
[1:21:33] received of course it was something that
[1:21:35] Everybody wanted to hear,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to hear that she's not
[1:21:40] going to die. Everybody wants to hear
[1:21:41] that she's going to live. The family
[1:21:43] definitely wants to hear she's not going
[1:21:45] to die.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And Billy Paul comes to him and Billy,
[1:21:49] of course, Brother Bram prophesied she's
[1:21:50] going to die. That her time's up. The
[1:21:52] Lord's going to take her. Of course,
[1:21:53] everybody hated brother Brown for that
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; because he said she's going to And of
[1:21:57] course, everybody wanted to believe the
[1:21:59] other prophecies that said she was going
[1:22:00] to live. Billy Paul comes to his daddy.
[1:22:03] Says, "Daddy," says, "All these people
[1:22:04] out there's probably I I I can't help.
[1:22:07] All I can tell you is what God showed
[1:22:09] me."
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; God told me she's going to die.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; God told me she's going to take her. And
[1:22:13] then when she died, you know who they
[1:22:15] blamed? Brother Brown.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; They blamed Brother Brandon because she
[1:22:20] died.
[1:22:21] He was the ONLY ONE IN CONTACT WITH GOD
[1:22:23] ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
[1:22:25] AND THEY HATED HIM FOR IT.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; What does that sound like?
[1:22:31] Oh God. Amen. Because everybody wanted
[1:22:34] to live. Of course they wanted her to
[1:22:35] live. And people want to believe that,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it was her time to go and God
[1:22:41] was going to take her and that was it.
[1:22:42] When God showed Brother Brandham she was
[1:22:44] going to go, that was the end of it.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God told him that's the way
[1:22:48] it's going to be. Now whether there were
[1:22:49] people there to judge those prophecies,
[1:22:52] don't know. But in that day, people just
[1:22:54] stood up and prophesied left and right.
[1:22:56] And you don't know that there's ever
[1:22:57] judgment to it. But you find in the
[1:22:59] scripture what brother Brandham's
[1:23:00] talking about. It's to be judged by two
[1:23:03] or three witnesses. Then he says
[1:23:07] you have to watch to see if it happens.
[1:23:10] Make sure it is of God or not. Amen.
[1:23:13] [snorts] If Dennis decide if that
[1:23:14] prophecy comes out, let's just say two
[1:23:17] or three uh uh there's not very many two
[1:23:20] or three in here, but say say a couple
[1:23:22] of us believe that to be of God.
[1:23:25] That's that's the truth. And brother
[1:23:27] Dennis says, "Ah, nonsense. I'm just
[1:23:29] going to go down river anyway." And he
[1:23:31] goes down river and goes home, gets home
[1:23:32] safe. Everything's fine.
[1:23:35] Then what do you do?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; That prophecy was of the devil. It
[1:23:38] wasn't a prophecy line. It wasn't a
[1:23:40] prophecy. That was of the devil.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was something wrong. Anybody
[1:23:45] that judge that to be of God needs to be
[1:23:47] found at the altar,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Repenting,
[1:23:51] getting their lives right.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now I know in the in the
[1:23:56] way that we live today that those gifts
[1:23:59] don't operate like the way they used to.
[1:24:01] Amen. And and and that's okay. They
[1:24:04] should. Amen. But as the spirit lives,
[1:24:07] you see because those gifts operate by
[1:24:09] the spirit. Now you you'll see it
[1:24:11] operating all over the place. But is it
[1:24:14] God?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; That's the question. See, it's got to be
[1:24:18] of God if it's not of God. And I have a
[1:24:20] confidence enough in this congregation
[1:24:22] knowing this place that if it that I if
[1:24:26] it happens it's of God,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I believe that. Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; It's you don't just see a a bunch of
[1:24:34] stuff going on because that's just just
[1:24:35] not But we we try to do what God tells
[1:24:38] and God owns and God leads us to do. We
[1:24:40] try to do that. And if God does that,
[1:24:42] then
[1:24:44] I I absolutely I'd be the first one as a
[1:24:48] pastor to say, "Absolutely. Let's have
[1:24:50] that. Do it." Yes. Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Prophecy, tongues,
[1:24:55] interpretation, whatever it might be,
[1:24:57] which a lot of times tongues interpreted
[1:24:59] is prophecy, but whatever it is. Amen.
[1:25:02] Uh the gifts of the spirit we want
[1:25:03] operating
[1:25:05] in in any capacity as God does. As the
[1:25:07] spirit lives, it won't happen as much.
[1:25:10] not not in godfilled churches because if
[1:25:13] the spirit's lifting now people don't
[1:25:15] have the spirit then they're not
[1:25:16] depending on the spirit to do it anyway
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; right
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; it's just them so the spirit can spirit
[1:25:21] can be completely gone not even just
[1:25:23] lifting but you can be in the middle of
[1:25:25] tribulation there's no spirit of God at
[1:25:27] all anywhere and they'll still be doing
[1:25:29] it
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; right
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; because they they do it their dependence
[1:25:32] is not on the Holy Ghost their
[1:25:34] dependence is on self
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; amen now let's move on getting kind
[1:25:40] uh away from this now then they have to
[1:25:43] watch if it happens then it may never
[1:25:46] fall look now brother said it may never
[1:25:48] fall on that brother or sister again it
[1:25:52] may be or the next one that that gift of
[1:25:55] prophecy but a pro may be that gift of
[1:25:58] prophecy he said but a prophet P r o p e
[1:26:01] t is born a prophet
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; amen born a prophet always was ordained
[1:26:08] that before the world ever began. Now
[1:26:11] he's talking about word prophet too. But
[1:26:13] I believe that those gifts are
[1:26:15] operating. God ordained those as well.
[1:26:17] See now you take like Jesus Christ, king
[1:26:20] of prophets.
[1:26:21] He was from the garden of Eden, the seed
[1:26:23] of the woman, prophet,
[1:26:26] son of man is prophet. And Moses was
[1:26:29] born a proper child, a prophet. John the
[1:26:32] Baptist. Why? Uh uh John the Baptist.
[1:26:34] Why? Isaiah saw him several hundred uh
[1:26:38] 712 years before he was born. Isaiah
[1:26:42] prophesied about Jesus. The son is born.
[1:26:44] Amen. And and said he's the voice of one
[1:26:47] crying in the wilderness 712 years
[1:26:51] before he was born. Jeremiah, God said
[1:26:54] before he was even formed in his
[1:26:57] mother's womb that he would that he knew
[1:27:00] him and sanctified him and ordained him
[1:27:03] a prophet to the nation. See, prophets
[1:27:06] have the word of God and are born a
[1:27:10] prophet.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Born a prophet. And a
[1:27:14] word prophet is someone that's fortold
[1:27:17] that we know in the scripture that we
[1:27:19] can look and say people say where do you
[1:27:21] find William Brandham's name in the
[1:27:22] scripture. You can take them to Malachi
[1:27:24] 4. You can take them to Luke 17:30. You
[1:27:27] can take them to uh uh um
[1:27:31] um Matthew 17. Amen. There's several
[1:27:34] places in the scripture we know that
[1:27:36] that was foretold. Now, the name William
[1:27:40] Mary and Brown doesn't appear,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; But mine doesn't either. Newton, George
[1:27:44] Newton Bennett the third doesn't appear
[1:27:45] in it either, but I find it all the time
[1:27:47] when I read the Bible.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might not find your exact name
[1:27:52] in the Bible. Micah can because he is
[1:27:54] named after a character in the Bible,
[1:27:55] but you might not. Gabriel, too, but you
[1:27:56] might not find your actual name. Amen.
[1:27:59] But you can find your name everywhere in
[1:28:03] the scripture because God read it, wrote
[1:28:04] it for you, and you're in it. you're
[1:28:07] it's a part of your life.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; So we we we know that God has given
[1:28:12] that. Now he talks about a gift of
[1:28:15] prophecy is different. Now let's uh
[1:28:18] let's go over to first Corinthians for a
[1:28:20] moment. [clears throat]
[1:28:25] I won't hold you too much longer but
[1:28:31] we'll draw this comparison. First
[1:28:32] Corinthians 14 which is another you find
[1:28:37] uh mentioning of the gifts of the spirit
[1:28:40] that we're talking about
[1:28:42] which we believe prophecy is to to be
[1:28:45] one of those gifts.
[1:28:48] Amen. 1 Corinthians 14.
[1:28:51] I want to for a minute look at someone
[1:28:55] ordained of God. Someone for ordained of
[1:28:58] God. Um
[1:29:03] and and and someone with a gift, someone
[1:29:07] that has a gift of prophecy. Now,
[1:29:09] Brother Ram says it could fall on a
[1:29:11] person, they could prophesy, never
[1:29:12] prophesy again.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; It could fall on a person, it could fall
[1:29:15] on this person or that person. And uh
[1:29:18] maybe they do, maybe they don't. But
[1:29:20] generally generally that pro that that
[1:29:24] gift God gives to individuals. Not
[1:29:27] everybody has that gift. myself. I can't
[1:29:30] say that I've ever prophesied in my
[1:29:33] life. No. Maybe have said utterances
[1:29:36] that
[1:29:37] that actually happened. But to say I'm a
[1:29:42] prophet is or to have the gift of
[1:29:44] prophecy is
[1:29:46] a stretch. Uh maybe you have, maybe you
[1:29:49] haven't. Don't know. I don't know
[1:29:50] anybody in here that has claimed to have
[1:29:53] a gift of prophecy. But maybe God's used
[1:29:56] you in some way to speak that actually
[1:29:58] was something that was foretold and
[1:30:00] happened. You just didn't notice it or
[1:30:02] see it as being
[1:30:04] a a prophecy. So many times people are
[1:30:08] deceived by by perceptions.
[1:30:11] Perceptions are if it's a prophecy,
[1:30:15] someone's going to stand up in church
[1:30:16] and they're going to proclaim him, "Thus
[1:30:18] sayeth the Lord."
[1:30:21] That is only one avenue that God uses to
[1:30:24] bring prophecy. I mean you can read you
[1:30:27] can read even in the message and we know
[1:30:30] brother Brandham was a word prophet and
[1:30:32] yes he was in church and he said thus
[1:30:34] sayith the Lord many times but how many
[1:30:35] times did God give brother Brandham and
[1:30:38] flow through him a prophecy that was
[1:30:39] just in his living room or kitchen or a
[1:30:41] home or something
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; or just giving advice to or just
[1:30:45] counseling somebody talking to people
[1:30:47] that that that happened. It would
[1:30:50] actually was a prophetic utterance and
[1:30:53] probably not even notice it. Some of you
[1:30:56] probably may have experienced that.
[1:30:58] Don't know if you noticed that but could
[1:31:00] very well be. Amen. But generally it
[1:31:05] happens uh on on specific people that
[1:31:08] God said. But let's look what uh let's
[1:31:10] look at Paul for a minute. I'll look at
[1:31:12] two scriptural examples for each one.
[1:31:14] See in 1 Corinthians 14 uh verse um 36
[1:31:20] let's look at this Paul says what
[1:31:23] came the word of God out of you out from
[1:31:26] you or came it unto you only
[1:31:31] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[1:31:36] or spiritual
[1:31:38] let him acknowledge that the things that
[1:31:40] I write unto you are are the
[1:31:44] commandments of the Lord. Now that's a
[1:31:47] word prophet.
[1:31:50] When Paul when he comes forth and says
[1:31:53] let it be known if you think you are
[1:31:55] prophet spiritual let that person
[1:31:57] acknowledge that the things that I write
[1:31:59] unto you they are the commandments of
[1:32:01] the Lord.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And we know now of course that we have
[1:32:04] them in our Bible as letters written
[1:32:06] that we have that we can read as
[1:32:09] commandments from the Lord. a word
[1:32:12] prophet. But if any any man be ignorant,
[1:32:14] let him be ignorant. Now, let's go over
[1:32:17] to Galatians.
[1:32:20] Galatians chapter 1.
[1:32:30] [snorts] Galatians chapter 1.
[1:32:34] Uh we'll just start with the first verse
[1:32:36] here.
[1:32:38] [clears throat] Galatians 1. We read
[1:32:39] this uh last week in the apostilhip. But
[1:32:42] look here, remember what I remember
[1:32:46] uh when I mentioned about brother
[1:32:48] Brandham
[1:32:50] that brother Brandham was a word
[1:32:52] prophet,
[1:32:54] but God told him to do the work of an
[1:32:57] evangelist,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; But yet he he in his life, he basically
[1:33:04] he he went around the country like an
[1:33:06] apostle or a missionary would.
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:11] He preached in a lot of these
[1:33:13] auditoriums and things around the
[1:33:15] country like an evangelist.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Do the work of an
[1:33:19] evangelist."
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; He said he wasn't made to be a pastor.
[1:33:24] But how many private interviews did
[1:33:26] brother Ramwood have with people when he
[1:33:28] pastored them?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; So, you see, my whole point is I I
[1:33:32] believe that word prophet as he was
[1:33:34] fulfilled all of those positions in some
[1:33:36] way, shape, or form. Yes.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Now, he couldn't stay as a pastor to be
[1:33:40] at home all the time, but he pastored
[1:33:43] people all the time.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; In that congregation, he still called
[1:33:46] him his congregation even.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; But I believe he fulfilled those
[1:33:51] positions. Now, someone may be contrary
[1:33:54] to me on that. And that's fine because
[1:33:56] there's no there's nothing I can
[1:33:58] necessarily point you to that he said
[1:34:00] that would I'm just talk I I just say
[1:34:02] look at the man's life,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Look at what he did. Look at who he was.
[1:34:06] Look at what he accomplished.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Look at how God used him.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what I can see, God used him
[1:34:12] in every single capacity
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; in some way, shape, or form. But he was
[1:34:17] a prophet?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, he
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; period.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; But look what Paul says now. Paul an
[1:34:23] apostle. Well, now wait. Is Paul an
[1:34:25] apostle or is he a prophet?
[1:34:30] He's called himself an apostle. Was he
[1:34:32] an apostle? Absolutely he was an
[1:34:34] apostle. You say, "But he he never went
[1:34:37] outside his little area there. He didn't
[1:34:39] go very far." That's not what an apostle
[1:34:41] is. Remember what we said last week? You
[1:34:44] don't have to fly 3,000 miles to be a
[1:34:47] missionary.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; You could be a missionary to your
[1:34:51] nextdoor neighbor,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Apostle, remember what was the
[1:34:56] definition? An apostle was someone who
[1:34:59] was sent. one who is sent good at
[1:35:03] starting things.
[1:35:05] So if God sends you to somebody, you
[1:35:07] just be you're just as much an apostle.
[1:35:10] You don't man minister behind a pullpit,
[1:35:13] but you do missionary work to your
[1:35:16] neighbor, to your friend, or to your
[1:35:17] coworker, something all the time. You do
[1:35:19] missionary work.
[1:35:21] You're one because you're one that sent,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I'm an apostle." But he was
[1:35:28] also a prophet because you know what I
[1:35:31] as Paul being a word prophet like
[1:35:33] brother Brandham was personally believed
[1:35:35] he fulfilled each of those positions
[1:35:37] just like brother Brandham did in some
[1:35:39] capacity in some way. Paul was the same
[1:35:42] way. Paul an apostle not of men neither
[1:35:46] by man but by Jesus Christ which you
[1:35:48] said you can't be you can't be man
[1:35:51] called
[1:35:52] uh uh by Jesus Christ and God the father
[1:35:55] who raised him from the dead and all the
[1:35:57] brethren which are with me unto the
[1:35:59] church of Galatia. Grace be unto you and
[1:36:02] peace from God our Father, from the Lord
[1:36:03] Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our
[1:36:05] sins, that he might deliver us from this
[1:36:07] present evil world, according to the
[1:36:09] will of God our Father, to whom be glory
[1:36:12] forever and ever. Amen. I marvel, look
[1:36:15] what Paul said now. I marvel that you
[1:36:18] are so soon removed from him that called
[1:36:21] you into the grace of Christ unto
[1:36:23] another gospel,
[1:36:25] which is not another, in other words,
[1:36:28] it's not another gospel. It's just
[1:36:30] somebody's word, somebody's doctrine,
[1:36:32] somebody's teaching. It's not another.
[1:36:35] But there be some that trouble you and
[1:36:38] would pervert the gospel of Christ. But
[1:36:41] now look what he says. Paul says, "But
[1:36:43] though we
[1:36:45] or an angel from heaven,"
[1:36:49] Remember, there's been angels kicked out
[1:36:51] of heaven,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:53] Though we or an angel from heaven preach
[1:36:56] any other gospel unto you, then that
[1:37:00] which we have preached unto you, let him
[1:37:02] be accursed.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a word prophet. What he say?
[1:37:07] These are the commandments of the Lord.
[1:37:10] What we preach to you is what God said.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're bringing to you is what
[1:37:15] God is commanding of us. What God is
[1:37:18] telling us, how God is leading us. This
[1:37:20] is what he's saying is what I'm bringing
[1:37:23] you is the word of God. [snorts]
[1:37:26] We know it now as the word of God. But
[1:37:29] those people sitting there didn't know
[1:37:31] that because it wasn't at that time. But
[1:37:33] he made sure and let them know this is
[1:37:36] the word of God. And if an angel comes
[1:37:37] from heaven and try to tell you anything
[1:37:39] else, let him be cursed. That's of the
[1:37:41] devil.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now [snorts] look at the
[1:37:44] difference.
[1:37:47] We got a prophet named Agabus. Now in
[1:37:50] Acts 11,
[1:37:52] we got a prophet named Agabus. And in
[1:37:55] Acts 11 27, it says, "And in these days
[1:38:00] came prophets from Jerusalem to
[1:38:02] Antioch." Prophets plural. Amen. So
[1:38:06] these were men uh maybe women even
[1:38:10] because this is just a gift of prophecy
[1:38:12] that had that gift in their life that
[1:38:15] came came prophets unto Antioch. And
[1:38:18] there stood up one of them named Agabus
[1:38:21] and signified by the spirit that there
[1:38:24] should be great dirt throughout all the
[1:38:27] world. What is that? That's a prophecy.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; this is going to happen.
[1:38:32] Agabus stood up and said there would be
[1:38:35] great dur throughout all the world. As
[1:38:38] the world as they knew it anyway.
[1:38:40] [snorts] Not the world as we know it,
[1:38:42] but as they knew it there. They didn't
[1:38:44] have the internet then. So they didn't
[1:38:45] have airplanes. So all they knew is
[1:38:48] their world was right there.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Throughout all the world, which came to
[1:38:52] pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Now
[1:38:55] that's a prophecy.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; That's somebody getting up and having a
[1:38:59] foretelling of events that's going to
[1:39:01] take place of something that's going to
[1:39:04] happen. Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; One more because I'm going to close here
[1:39:08] just a minute. Uh Acts also in Acts 21
[1:39:12] again. Agabus,
[1:39:15] a true prophet,
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; not necessarily a ministering prophet
[1:39:19] because you never hear from him in a
[1:39:21] ministry context,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Not a word prophet because he wasn't
[1:39:25] Paul. Paul was the word prophet. There's
[1:39:27] only one,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; That wasn't there. Peter wasn't that
[1:39:31] man.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Uh, Agabus wasn't that man. Even though
[1:39:34] all these people had gifts of prophecy,
[1:39:36] there's only one. It was Paul,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; right? that that word pro as we call
[1:39:41] word prophet. Now agabus 21 uh acts 21
[1:39:46] verse 10. And as we carried there many
[1:39:49] days there came down from Judea a
[1:39:51] certain prophet named Agabus.
[1:39:55] And when he was come unto us he took
[1:39:57] Paul's girdle. And that girdle isn't
[1:39:59] like we know a girdle. It's just a sash
[1:40:01] something around the waist. Kind of like
[1:40:04] a scarf around the waist. Uh he took
[1:40:08] Paul's girdle and bound his own hands
[1:40:10] and feet and said, "Thus saith the Holy
[1:40:13] Ghost. So shall the Jews at Jerusalem
[1:40:17] bind the man that this owneth that
[1:40:20] owneth this girdle and shall deliver him
[1:40:22] into the hands of the Gentiles." Now
[1:40:25] that's a warning that a that God is
[1:40:27] giving a prophecy that's giving that's a
[1:40:30] warning that's giving out. This is going
[1:40:32] to the man that this girl belongs to.
[1:40:34] This is going to happen to him. Amen.
[1:40:37] Now,
[1:40:39] the person he's talking about is Paul.
[1:40:42] Paul has the choice. Now, does he want
[1:40:44] to continue just to do what the Lord's
[1:40:46] told him to do, or is he going to do
[1:40:48] something else? Amen. And when we heard
[1:40:52] these things uh these things, verse 12,
[1:40:55] both we and they of that place besought
[1:40:58] him not to go up to Jerusalem. Now, the
[1:41:00] people are saying, "Oh, don't Paul,
[1:41:02] don't go to Jerusalem." Now, this
[1:41:04] prophecy, Amen. That could have been a
[1:41:07] warning like we said with with brother
[1:41:08] Dennis. Don't go. This is a warning.
[1:41:11] Don't go.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Agabus is just saying this is going to
[1:41:15] happen as a prophecy. Paul could Paul
[1:41:18] could have done something else, gone a
[1:41:21] different way or done something. But if
[1:41:23] God's told you to do something, you do
[1:41:24] it anyway. You don't fear the enemy. You
[1:41:27] don't you don't fear the what the enemy
[1:41:28] could do to you. You just do what God
[1:41:30] says do.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Paul and they were all scared
[1:41:34] and they tell Paul don't don't do it
[1:41:36] Paul. Then Paul answered what mean ye to
[1:41:40] weep and to break mine heart for I am
[1:41:43] ready not to be bound only but also to
[1:41:46] die at Jerusalem for the name of the
[1:41:48] Lord Jesus.
[1:41:50] Amen. So he went anyway and what and
[1:41:53] what happened? Exactly what Agabus said
[1:41:56] would happen.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; They took him and they bound him just
[1:41:59] like Agabus said would happen. that
[1:42:01] shows you a true prophet to bring that
[1:42:04] prophecy. And that prophecy happened. It
[1:42:07] came to pass. But it wasn't a
[1:42:09] ministering gift. It wasn't a word
[1:42:12] prophet gift. It was just a simple gift
[1:42:14] of prophecy to come out and said, "This
[1:42:15] is going to happen." And it happened.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; What did brother Ram say? Judged. And
[1:42:22] then see if it happens.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't say here if it was
[1:42:26] judged. We believe it must have been,
[1:42:28] but doesn't say here if it was. But it
[1:42:30] came to pass,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The man whose girl that belonged
[1:42:34] to that actually happened. What do you
[1:42:36] see? What had to happen? Amen. And
[1:42:38] that's how it's supposed to operate.
[1:42:40] Amen. Now, now it it it could be
[1:42:43] something of fear. It could be a
[1:42:45] warning. It could be something that's
[1:42:47] just told as a prophecy. This is going
[1:42:49] to happen. Amen. And it happened. So
[1:42:52] many of these little things like this,
[1:42:54] even in Brother Brown's ministry, that
[1:42:56] happened that uh a lot of people don't
[1:42:58] understand. But it came to pass because
[1:43:00] it was a prophecy of God,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Why did Why did God send a bear and a
[1:43:09] lion to David?
[1:43:12] What was the point of David
[1:43:16] killing that lion and that bear? What
[1:43:17] was the point? Why Why would God even
[1:43:20] bother sending him?
[1:43:22] Because David needed to gain the
[1:43:24] confidence and the faith.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. that when he's faced eye to eye
[1:43:28] with the enemy, he even grabbed the
[1:43:30] lion, I believe it was by the beard, it
[1:43:32] said,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; He even grabbed him that he could look
[1:43:35] the enemy in his eye and stare and and
[1:43:38] stare him down face and defeat him.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Same thing happens to us. Amen. To you
[1:43:46] to be able to stare down the enemy.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And to defeat him.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Remember our five-fold ministry.
[1:43:53] prophet,
[1:43:55] missionary, apostle, teacher,
[1:43:57] evangelist, pastor. You bring them all
[1:44:00] together and you got a weapon to defeat
[1:44:02] the enemy. Yes.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Beat the enemy with.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no other no other Bible
[1:44:08] that you could tell purpose for why
[1:44:11] David, why God sent that lion and that
[1:44:14] bear out there for David. only the fact
[1:44:17] THAT WHEN HE CAME FACE to face with that
[1:44:20] giant and he looked at Saul in the eye
[1:44:23] and he said is that that that
[1:44:25] uncircumcised Philistine is going to be
[1:44:27] just like that lion and that bear. God
[1:44:30] gave them into my hands. He'll give him
[1:44:32] into my hands.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He does the same thing
[1:44:36] for us.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we know God is with us.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Paul went on up there and what happened?
[1:44:42] Yeah. He was bound. Absolutely. Th found
[1:44:45] thrown in prison. Beat thrown in prison.
[1:44:48] See, but God always has a way to show us
[1:44:51] he's with us.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; To have faith, to increase our faith, to
[1:44:55] realize that we are not alone. We are
[1:44:58] not defeated.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're his children. And God will
[1:45:02] God will fight for us. He always fights
[1:45:04] for us.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand if we could.
[1:45:13] God fights for his children as he does.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God is always there
[1:45:20] with us to keep us to help us to be able
[1:45:23] to overcome those things. Whatever it is
[1:45:26] of the world that Satan tries to send,
[1:45:29] just remember God any in the in the only
[1:45:33] way if you're a child of God, you're
[1:45:35] born again. And the angels of God are
[1:45:37] encamped around about you with flaming
[1:45:39] swords drawn to keep the enemy at bay.
[1:45:40] So if there's any enemy that gets in
[1:45:44] somehow, you have to know God allowed it
[1:45:47] for what re for for some reason. What
[1:45:49] reason? Lord, I don't know. Amen. That's
[1:45:52] for us in that in that moment to to pray
[1:45:56] about and to see Lord why, what, how
[1:46:00] you show me, you use me, you send me,
[1:46:03] you whatever God's purpose is. And it
[1:46:06] may be no other purpose but simply to
[1:46:11] help increase your faith.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; To help you come along, to help you grow
[1:46:16] in him. We're coming to a place now,
[1:46:18] especially saints, probably more now
[1:46:20] than ever, to where we're going to have
[1:46:23] faith for these bodies to change and to
[1:46:25] be translated and go in a rapture.
[1:46:28] Something that's only happened a few
[1:46:30] times in the whole history of humanity
[1:46:32] that we know by the scripture.
[1:46:34] It's going to happen to a whole group of
[1:46:36] people around the world. I want to be
[1:46:39] one of them.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I'm one of them.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God gives us that
[1:46:45] faith. Amen. He shows us his way. He
[1:46:48] shows us his purpose. Amen. Praise the
[1:46:52] Lord Jesus.
[1:46:54] Amen. Let's just sing this little chorus

[1:49:22] Amen. Remember now, um I I leave this
[1:49:25] afternoon. I'm going to Love, Texas for
[1:49:27] the week's work. Uh but when I get back
[1:49:29] on Saturday, me and Sonia's going to fly
[1:49:31] out Saturday night uh out to uh Long
[1:49:35] Beach, California, and we're going to go
[1:49:37] on a cruise for seven days. So, we'll be
[1:49:38] gone that Sunday, the 14th, and the
[1:49:41] following Sunday, the 21st, because we
[1:49:43] don't get back until that Sunday. Uh so,

[1:49:56] Christmas. remember uh the next two
[1:49:59] Sundays. Appreciate your prayers for our
[1:50:00] traveling nurses and mine and the work
[1:50:03] and uh guess it just seems like there's
[1:50:05] a lot coming up here. So uh appreciate
[1:50:08] your prayers for that and just trust the
[1:50:10] Lord bless you. Sometimes you think well
[1:50:13] three weeks off helps you rest a little
[1:50:15] bit. It does, but it kind of makes you
[1:50:17] lazy.
[1:50:18] Kind of makes you
[1:50:22] a a little harder to get back into it
[1:50:24] again when you're out of it for that
[1:50:26] long. But I appreciate it. I'll have
[1:50:28] another three weeks after this week,
[1:50:31] three more weeks. I won't go back to
[1:50:32] work until the next year. Uh but um but
[1:50:36] again, appreciate your prayers and love
[1:50:39] and appreciate each of you. Remember
[1:50:41] this coming Sunday the 14th and the
[1:50:43] following the 21st, we will not be here.
[1:50:46] So please keep that in mind. Please
[1:50:47] remember that. Amen. And again, like I
[1:50:49] said, merry Christmas to all of you.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love you. Appreciate you. Amen.
[1:50:55] celebrate in the way that you know the
[1:50:57] Lord has uh blessed you to do so. We
[1:51:00] know it's not his birthday uh but we
[1:51:02] celebrate it in in honor of him. Amen.
[1:51:05] In whatever way whether he's born then
[1:51:08] or not doesn't matter. Honor him anyway.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and if people of the world and
[1:51:13] people of the country uh because it's
[1:51:15] Christmas want to bring out the name
[1:51:16] Jesus more often, I'm all in favor of
[1:51:19] that.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm all in favor of that. Praise
[1:51:22] the Lord. So God richly bless you today.
[1:51:25] Amen. Sister
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; and happy birthday to you.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I do appreciate that. That's the reason
[1:51:34] for the trip. Sonia's like, "We need to
[1:51:36] do something special for your 60th
[1:51:38] birthday." And
[1:51:41] I've had how many birthdays that I mean
[1:51:44] just like like everybody in here but
[1:51:47] Gabriel and Alice know when you get to a
[1:51:49] certain point is just another day
[1:51:51] really. It's just It's just, you know,
[1:51:54] but uh you you end up celebrating your
[1:51:57] children's birthday and then your
[1:51:58] grandchildren's birthday a lot more. It
[1:52:01] means a lot more. But thank you very
[1:52:02] much. Just appreciate that. I do
[1:52:03] appreciate that.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Anyone else have anything before we go?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. May the Lord protect you and Sonia
[1:52:13] and have a great time. Your two Bibles
[1:52:16] are walking in that U cruise. Um, you
[1:52:20] heard the news about I never knew this.
[1:52:24] International waters teenagers can drink
[1:52:27] on the cruise.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, didn't know.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; One young man got drunk just a couple of
[1:52:34] weeks ago
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and killed the sister.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; On a cruise.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard something about that.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; God protect you,
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; you know, and you're there to enjoy
[1:52:44] yourself.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; And but there's going to be a lot of
[1:52:49] going on.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Uh Micah is good at getting a ships
[1:52:52] there. He says there's different This is
[1:52:54] probably not for the video we said, but
[1:52:57] uh he has travel agency, so he set it
[1:52:59] up. He knows the cruise ships that are
[1:53:01] party ships and they're family ships and
[1:53:04] that are more adultoriented kind of
[1:53:06] ships, things like that. So yeah. So he
[1:53:09] made sure
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; when I was even looking before he said,
[1:53:12] "Make sure you don't get on this one,
[1:53:13] this one, this one, this will be, you
[1:53:15] know, party on. This will be this." So
[1:53:17] he's the one that did it. So,
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; but I think teenagers, according to my
[1:53:22] boss, according to my man, my team
[1:53:24] manager, they teenagers drink in
[1:53:25] Wisconsin anyways. I don't know.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Well, that's good to know. When I get
[1:53:31] ready for a cruise with Leah, I want to
[1:53:34] talk to you about it.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; One that knows.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, God bless you all.
[1:53:41] Love you. Appreciate you. We'll be
[1:53:43] dismissed in a word of prayer to dismiss
[1:53:45] us.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:48] Gracious heavenly father God, we come to
[1:53:50] you Lord at the close of this service.
[1:53:52] Lord Jesus
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; as always for being with us and speaking
[1:53:56] to us and being with us through our
[1:53:57] worship
[1:53:59] Lord Jesus. I know that we all felt your
[1:54:02] your presence Lord even before the song
[1:54:04] service
[1:54:06] God.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Help us as we go our
[1:54:08] separate ways, Lord Jesus. We won't
[1:54:10] reconvene for a couple weeks, Father
[1:54:11] God, but we know that wherever we are,
[1:54:13] that we can take you with us if we
[1:54:15] choose to, Lord God, and may you help us
[1:54:18] that we can live a life that welcomes
[1:54:19] your presence every day. Yes, Lord, with
[1:54:22] us [snorts]
[1:54:23] the safe, those who have needs, Lord
[1:54:25] God, we lay them before you. We ask it
[1:54:27] everything in your name. In the name of
[1:54:28] Lord Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
