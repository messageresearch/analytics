cancer surgery does 100% what it needs to do amen so we believe that in his name amen when is that supposed to be sister Wednesday Wednesday so we remember that Wednesday of prayer for sister sheilia amen she also has here unspoken request so remember that praising the Lord for his mighty hand and everything so grateful amen praise the Lord and this is a testimony so hold on to that a little bit longer uh also uh happened this week that a very dear friend of mine uh and the family kids may not know him quite as well U but may M probably does but um a very good friend probably really actually friend probably since we came in the message so we're talking mid 70s uh brother Dwight Hall passed away this week in North Carolina so please remember the family in prayer they had Fairly large family a lot of boys a lot of boys that had a lot of kids and so they had grandkids great grandkids uh brother Dwight you may know I don't know uh I do know that there were cassette tapes of his music in the library at Tucson Tabernacle um and he has been a played sang wrote songs for years and years and years uh I think as as I can recall there's a song or two in this book that he wrote um so he will be sorely missed uh he did Pastor churches of and on different places uh all in North Carolina but very good friend of mine very one son was a very dear friend too so please remember the family in prayer if you would the the White Hall going to be with the Lord so please remember him in prayer also M had a request I forgot to put down so yeah uh just a Qui one of my friends that used to live in Tucson he's a pediatric doctor moved to Indianapolis several years ago I think preo um and we got news on his Facebook that he unexpectedly passed away on the four it took this long to Friday for the family to be able to confirm this passing and the date the fourth so I don't know anything surrounding his passing but um I know it's been a sudden shock to the medical community where he is his family and and everyone connected how old was he he was 28 more in passing Str I also have a request I forgot about it I am struggling to learn excess proceeds so that um I can start earning a real living and I've been struggling with this months now trying to now know because I took some time off to write a missionary piece that I have one for everybody to pass out the people you see on the street you know whoever you feel led to give it to um and because they've got nothing better to do than sit at their bus stop and pass out or scroll through their phone so it's the only way that we can reach these people when they're away because they can stay away for long enough so they'll figure that out themselves but I have um not been able to I'm slowly stepp step by step at a time trying to the abbreviations and terms and all this and I need help from the Lord to to get through this Labyrinth of real estate Mish you know Mish MOS that that I've never been exposed to before and the technical terms and the court terms where do you get this stuff and and and and um so I just need help with this I haven't even turned in my first case yet I'm struggling with that one now and um and so I just um I'm hoping that I can turn it in on Monday and and so I just need help with that I can real living my my uh government check is going to go away after Trump is elected and I've got to have income this isn't this isn't just I wish more money this is well first of all we don't know if Trump's going be elected second of all both candidates have said they would keep so SC so I don't think I would worry too much about that but regardless if everything was stripped from every one of us today the lord always provides we will absolutely remember your request I believe God is doing this for me because a told me that I would have certain proceeds by a certain date and and it follows what I'm doing so that was during I got real discouraged this last week but then I remembered what he said and so I'm just that's why I'm pressing on and and I need I need God's help well if that prophecy is a true prophecy then the Lord will take care of it because it's his word yeah praise the Lord anyone else have an unspoken request yes I I should have wrote it down this coming Friday I'll see my new U orthopedic surgeon um I have problems with my right knee I'm almost a step away from pulling up I came and um I believe the Lord's going to use him um so I I can't have surgery right away because Le is having a surgery and so uh I believe a shot has been delayed for months by the

this service the M part of it to your hands may you be glorified in all that is said and done accomplish now that the purpose youve set this service for we commit it to you Lord again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis CH 11 uh I want to read the first nine verses of Genesis 11 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed uh from the East that they found a plain in the land of Shar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go too let us make brick burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar they said go too let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go you let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from the F uh from th upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the Earth and you could be seated if you'd like amen I want to uh emphasize and uh bring uh a thought of Oneness today uh Oneness but the authority and the power uh by which this scripture uh brings to us that even God himself and his own verbage of what God has what was written in the scripture uh of the power of Oneness of the power of unity of the power of being together in one mind in one Accord the power of this evident here as God in his own language God himself said behold the people is one now that's the first thing the people are one amen and that's the first thing that has to be done regardless and now these were all in the same place these people were all in one location these people were all in uh uh within earshot of each other there was no internet there was no computers there was no telephone there was no uh cell phones uh there was no email there was no uh uh WhatsApp uh this was lip to ear back in the day uh they had no other way to communicate but to be within shouting distance of one another so these were all in one place but I want you to understand that they were one now you don't have to be in one place to be one right you don't have to be in the same room to be one you don't have to be in the same city state country to be one you can be one just by organizing yourself or or or coming together under a single entity that we all come together under amen and that entity I believe for the Bride of Jesus Christ is the spirit of God it's the spirit of God that is Unified around the world Amen to everyone that believes to everyone who has received that Spirit to everyone no matter where they are the deep dark reaches of this country whether they're alone by themselves they're bride member that spirit of God is on them just like he is on us and that makes us one that brings us together as one we're not together under the same language we're not together under the same race we're not together in the same Creed we're not together under the same nationality but we're together under one spirit and that spirit is Jesus Christen and together that brings us as one now that Oneness is a very important aspect cuz that's the first thing God said first thing God says they are one and because they are one they have all one language amen and of course uh the bride internationally has a language yes uh we know this bride has a language it's a language the rest of the world doesn't understand it's a language the rest of Christian language even Christians a lot don't understand the language that the has how many Christians that that do you know personally first of all how many Christians of those Christians do you know talk about Christ and mystery of God revealed how many of you know talk about the Seven Seals right seven Church ages right uh how many you know talk about it is the rising of the sun right uh how many of you uh have heard of of the of the language that that that the bride has come to know as something common for us us amen when we talk about the seals we don't even have to say the Seven Seals when you say seals you know what we're talking about any bride member anyone in this message knows of that same language that are we are of the same language you say seals you know what we're talking about amen you say Prophet you know what we're talking you know who we're talking about we're talking about Will William Mary and brandom you talk about church ages uh what other of the language that we use as as Bride As message people that we use that's a commonality to us that the rest of the world doesn't know right uh I I remember one time I had a very good friend he has passed on but he's a very dear friend we did a lot of stuff together played a lot of golf went to lunch a lot spent time together we worked together at the company when I was pury manager in Charlotte we were very close his name was Pat hman he actually came to Florida one time and I had him up and sang I got criticized because I had an unbeliever come and sang in our church but anyway um that's another story I had him say beautiful voice he had a really good voice uh good brother loved him uh when he was in Florida uh I took him out to this place that had like a there a side of beef was their prime rib um I took everybody there once I found out about it uh just delicious I uh I would go get the the big one and I eat the outside of it take the rest of it home and have sandwiches for two or three weeks uh but anyway I took him there and he looked at me and I had been witnessing to about the message and the prophet all this time he said what is the biggest difference that you would say that's between what I believe and what you believe now he followed a different nominal Minister who uh was along the Pentecostal line of speaking in tongues the is initial evidence of the Holy Ghost so much so that I went by their church one time their actual Church sign that advertised their sign out in front of their lawn was in the shape of a tongue oh that that's how that's how sold into that initial evidence speaking in tongues that they were but he asked me he said what's but I didn't I gifts aren't it I I'm not uh gifts are gifts that's what they are brother random called them temporal gifts uh we have them now they're for the Ed of the church the the body and things and and thank God for them but they're temporal uh but he asked me he said what's the biggest difference uh between what I believe what I follow and what and and and what you keep trying to tell me I said well uh the biggest thing that I know of that I could think of that that uh that put that made the Bible a new book was the seils and he looked at me like a mule looking at a new gate he said what is that and and now look this this was not a man that did not know the scripture now of course he knew basically what they taught him in the following that he followed uh of of that U televangelist Minister he did but he knew the scripture and I would have thought for sure I mean how do you not know I mean it's it's very scripture I mean it's a common language for us that we speak as as as message Believers but it's common in I mean it's not something that if you've read Revelations you know the seals uh it shouldn't be that uh non-common if you will but I said uh the opening of the revelation of the seals the opening of the seals and he didn't know what I was talking about and I of course I begin to explain it to him but then it made me of course realize this is not something common that even christiandom speaks about even other Christians and other Rel religions and denominations that they speak of they they don't talk like that that is not a language that they that that they revert to like we do because we know as brother randam talked about that the opening of the seals to him made the Bible a new book to him because then you could look at him of course the whole history uh back from the first church age all the way through made it all so clear to understand uh it it put it in a greater perspective to see and with the opening of that it opened up the the the the Bible uh as you read the Bible it doesn't read the same anymore now I I could not I've made this statement before and people think I've been a little uh uh I don't know uly about it or something but I I I've always said that the seals did not make the Bible a new book to me because I've never known the scripture now we grew up in a Baptist Church of course I but I was eight or nine when we left I was uh I got baptized there or I got put in the water under Father Son and the Holy Ghost that was a baptism but anyway uh in the Baptist Church but I didn't know anything about it wasn't anything that I didn't read my my Bible I read some scripture like I said the one scripture I knew was John 3:16 uh I didn't know the scripture so the only way to my point the only way that I've ever known the scripture is through the prism of the seals right I've never known anything any other way so if you understand what my point is I didn't know it pre seals so if you didn't know it pre seals how could it become a new book post seals if all youve ever known is post seal for something to become new it had to be old but it was never old to me it was always I always I've always in my in my Christian walk have always read the scripture when I really got to reading and studying the Bible Bible it was through the prism of the seals being open praise through through the through the revelation of the seals it's always been that way so it never was a new book to me but that's what made the difference of the opening of of the tearing of those seals to open that book for by Revelation for us to be able to see it for God to reveal it to us amen amen and I've always seen it that way when I thought about thought that's that's a language that we speak that they don't that's a a language that we speak and how much of that there so many that uh I didn't mention of course we could for the next 15 minutes talk about the things that we discuss or that we use as language verbage as message Believers and the rest of the country doesn't the rest of the world doesn't the most the Christians don't use it they don't understand it don't know what are you talking about so you didn't even go try to explain it seven Church agents what about there's lot most Christian don't even know they don't even believe that church ages all they believe is that's why I put that in my book you know I had that about I had a little excerpt about that in my book and brother Dale who was one of the proof readers came back and uh he said you need to uh clarify this and I said why he said because if your aim is for this book not to just be for message Believers but for any Christian Christian or anybody that would help if they can believe and apply those principles would help their life then you need to explain this because a lot of Christians don't believe right in the seven Church a they do not believe in dispensationalism they don't believe that they believe that Ephesus and smia were just churches that were there in that place at that time not Church ages so if you go and read my book and I get to that point uh you'll see I explain a a little bit to try to draw it out so people understand about brother brandom and that that's actually the one place in my entire book I mentioned brother brand was about that because he was a dispensationalist Lin was a dispensation I I put their names in there as to clarify but a lot of people don't even know that see language that we have Oneness we are of Oneness to be of one the first thing remember God said the people is one amen that's the number one thing that's the number one most important thing is that we must unify under the same spirit amen now we unify when we come together for church like this yes we come together in body and in mind but a Oneness that he's talking about to be one with those from around the world that we may never see that we may never speak to that we may never never know we are one with them because we're one with the thing that we can be one under and that's his Spirit the Oneness of God to have all language we all speak the same language amen there I call it I don't mean this to be in a uh of of uh an arrogant way but but in the truth it's a message language amen we all have speak a message language and this they begin to do and now now but now what he said they're one because they're one they have one language they're have one mind nothing this is the Lord speaking this is God nothing will be restrain from them which they have imagined to do whatever that they have it in their heart and mind to do they will accomplish it now think about that and think about the limits that we place on ourselves right and think about the limits that we place in our in in our Unity even of the Brethren think about the limits that we place and don't say we don't CA we do right we shouldn't but we do yes and and and and recognize how those limits are now exploited through this scripture when we reach to the place of Oneness together amen you can look at it around the world brother Bram preached about Oneness and how the world's coming together Amen in a Oneness and it's becoming more and more clear as divided as we are there's more Oneness going on in the back door that you don't know about right coming and forming together under under a different ospice under a under a a religion if you will to to bring forth someone that forget Harrison Trump yeah there's one that's going to come forth here very shortly Saints it's going to that they will pair in comparison to what's about to happen of who's about to raise up in this world today right to take over amen that the entire world will be in Oneness towards that person but think about just something small uh I I I think about something as small as uh uh a sports Stadium or an auditorium uh it it takes a coming together of people to agree that they're going to spend their hundred bucks to make sure that this thing gets built and it takes a million of them of course my numbers are skewed of course takes way more than aund million to build a stadium or an auditorium like that anymore but the point to come together to agree I'm going to put myund I'm going to put my 100 I'm gonna put myund think about a million people would have to come together hypothetically with a hundred bucks to say I'm going to take myund and I'm going to put it towards building this Auditorium I'm G to build it towards building put it towards building this stadium and it takes a million of them and if a million of them get into one mind and into one Accord in one thought and they all put their hund in they can do what they say they're going to do and they do it and how many times do they do it around the world so just in a small sense people still if they get together and they become one and they have the same thought and the same goal and the same language they can accomplish anything they want to amen right take those limitations off Saints if God will withhold nothing from these people they will they will accomplish what they said they would accomplish what do you think that we can accomplish if we come into one of Mind One Rapture oh of course the Rapture would would be the culmination of what would happen in this bride that would just simply be an an accumulation a culmination if you will of of what would happen happen in this bride she would come forth with such power with such Authority with such strength there's not a demon in hell would know what to do with any one of us amen amen they say well uh we've got all these reinforced demons but I got I got the Bride of Jesus Christ with me and guess who's backing her praise God in the name of Jesus demon have to flee right praise God nothing would this my admission now my admonishment nothing would be withheld from this bride to do what she wants to do if she's in one mind one language one Accord right now I know it come now there's there's never been a time I I know the scripture that that that God purposely scattered Brothers God purposely brought division in Brothers to to send them out to to spread this gospel but there's never been a time ever scripturally or in the history of the world that we have like we have today because there's never been a time where this bride at this time needs to come together more than she ever has now amen this is not a time for separation this is not a time for disagreement this is not a time for separation this is a time for Oneness this is a time now it doesn't have to all be in the same building amen it doesn't have to because we've said that before God sets a five-fold Ministry and even in that five-fold Ministry he sets a pastor over here and a pastor over here and a pastor over there and each one of them has the specific calling and and and and training or upbringing or whatever that God can use through that person to help those people and then God sends them to those to to that church for that reason and unfortunately uh I think we probably been scattered way too much based on personalities and uh orators and uh how uh handsome somebody is or or how well of a speaker they are or because my family goes there or because my friends go there uh I think we've been a little too skewed as far as that part of it goes I think we should all just be wor God tells us to be regardless of how big small ugly poor Rich doesn't matter where is God want me to be CU that's where your spiritual growth is going to come be where God puts you right being where God put you is going to is where your spiritual growth is going to come from because God's going to put you in the right place at the right time with the right church and the right Pastor to bring that spiritual growth forth in your life that's God doing it amen not not because my best friend goes there or not because this person oh he speaks so much better or this person's really quiet and really s this person's really loud and and borous and and very emotional now which one meet people they generally tend to go over to the meek ones and the ones that's a little more emotional tend to go over to the emotional side amen why should doesn't even need to be that way sints being God tells you to be but in that we all come together as one as one one mind one Accord nothing nothing would be withheld from them which they imagined to do God help us to get to that place amen Nothing To Be Imagined I I I can't imagine that there's one single believer bride member around the world today that's not longing and Desiring a Rapture not one I I I I couldn't imagine there is um we talk about it often we pray about it many times Amen in our conversation many times how close it's got to be so on so forth I can't imagine any believer bride person around the world that that wouldn't be their first number one focal thought in their life remember what brother green always told us remember what brother Brown said Never Lose Your Enthusiasm for the coming of the Lord right seems to wne a little bit but that's the exhortation yes Never Lose Your Enthusiasm for the coming of the lord I can't believe there's one person that that wouldn't be something that's the focal point of their mind Lord just any day now just any day now and what would that do for all of us to come into that one Accord into that one mind into that one place nothing would it be imagine what we believe could be done God what in other words the only way that God could stop them was to change their language well he's not going to do that to us no I mean he's the one that created the language he's the one that give us the language he's the one that sent it to us through a prophet so he's not going to change our language amen our language is is going to stay the same praise the Lord in a Oneness now so then what what do we look to we look to oh a a place of Oneness we look to a a a position of coming into that that one mind amen that one mind let's go over to uh Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 let me read you this the Easter seal in Phoenix April 65 notice the Pentecostal people up there when they had got quickened by the Holy Spirit he said listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on the dead Pentecost received their abstract Deed from God sure it glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it so quickened their body praise the Lord it so quickened their body till they couldn't even speak in an Earthly language anymore praise the Lord it so quickened their Earthly body that they could not speak in an Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a Heavenly language praise the Lord the place they were going to we are quickened then by the power of the Living God tongues quickened into a new Heavenly language to speak to them a rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than what with then where we've ever lived also with the new quickening life to come to them uh to come in them it quickened their language quickened their language they spoke in new tongues oh yes look it quickened their bodies until they flew so close to Heaven till it quickened their body to speak in a new language they had never heard before it quickened their bodies they spoke in a new Heavenly language they were quickened into the presence of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost God quickening power baptized them into that they were they were in the place of worship then they were where they could worship the sadrin or nothing else could bother them because they were quickened they were new people that after they were of course quickened by the spirit of God Acts chapter 2 now I want to read read this one mind Oneness when the day acts 2:1 when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place one Accord in one place now they two one one place amen understanding now I it's not lost on me that it is would be easier uh a lot of times to come into one mind if you are in one place but if the spirit of God is the same in Marisha as it is in Tucson how could that if it's the same and and I obviously use that if Loosely because we know it is the same there's it is here here how would it not be the same then to do the same to bring us into the same place of Oneness of one mind amen even though they were there because remember up to this point that Spirit had never been given this is the first initial uh uh uh giving of God giving his Spirit to the people on them in them the spirit of God Jesus Christ coming into the individual first time so for them to be in one place was important for them because they all received it in that one place at one time right they were in one Accord but the number one thing they were with all they were all with one Accord amen they were all of One mind they were one praise the Lord suddenly now when they became into now I I would venture to get yes when the 120 got there they didn't all all of a sudden come into one mind and want to it didn't I don't I don't think it happened the second they walked through the door right right right right they were they were there together they fellowshipped they talked they reminisced I guess crucifixion of Christ all the things that Christ had done while he was here and and all the things that brought them together as one see the problem a lot of times we have is that we fixate too much on the things that divide us rather than the things that bring us together amen that's right and we we fixate too much on the differences rather than the similarities and of course that's the devil's job uh Satan's job is to break Unity his number one thing that he desires to accomplish in US is to break us apart that's the number one thing he wants to do so what does he do he does his very best to try to help us to or cause us to fixate on the 1% that we disagree on instead of instead of focusing on the 99% that we agree on Amen even as people even as humans I I believe it's the same way I hear all the time you hear about political uh stuff out in the political with the election coming up and and and everything is about how horrible the other person is uh and in instead of and and and people get that and think well you know this person must be a devil uh probably I don't have any evidence of this but probably so much so a young kid climbing on a roof and triy to shoot one of them uh when you hear this stuff over and over again it takes a effect right but when it boils right down to it and you talk to people what do people want they want to be healthy they want to have money they want to be able to provide for their family they they maybe want to have a savings they want to be safe they want to be able to walk down the street and feel like they're not going to be murdered or shot in the head or or raped or whatever you break it right down to the core thing that most people in this country want and it's all the same right really but it's become so fixated on the things that divide rather than the things that bring together amen of course this country turned God down uh 70 some odd years ago now so we understand what's going on there but uh but as far as the bride is concerned the devil's going to do everything he can to try to cause us us to uh to fixate on the things that are different rather than the things that bring us together yes amen praise the Lord and I and again I think the things that bring us together are far more numerous than the things that would separate us yeah look I don't believe they walked in there and all of a sudden bam there it is right they barely get their seats and the spirit Falls no no I believe they were there they were praying they were fasting they were talking they were talking about God they were talking about Christ they were talking about all the Miracles and the things that he preached to us and my you remember that sermon he oh yeah I remember that God you remember when that he touched that one his eyes came up yeah he put mud in there how in the world could that have happen you just start talking about the Lord and then the Lord come on the scene how many times that ever happened in your life you really you start talking about the Lord and all of a sudden he's there amen praise the Lord that's just God I believe that happened here now suddenly then there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind filled all the house where they were sitting praise God seeing the Oneness that's what I pray for every time we have a church service amen amen is that experience right there fill all this house right here where we're sitting amen because that's a Oneness praise the lord and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as the fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues like brother man was just saying as the spirit gave them utterance now let's drop down to the 37th verse let's see what the result is amen I remember telling me remember me telling you the other day the story about those Brothers after right after church one of them was the one that preached the other was a minister too and and just fussing and fussing and fussing the whole time we were there fussing and fussing people looking at us gotten so loud people were looking thinking my these people just came from church they don't act like Christians and and and I'm thinking but the entire time they spent they spent the entire dinner talking about things that separated them yeah I I I never went to ministers meetings because I always heard that the things that come up are the things that divide us the things that we disagree about now I believe we should all be able to come together and reading together absolutely I don't have a problem with that but when it becomes argumentative and it becomes boisterously over of one place or the other and then I heard when I was going back to visit my mom my brother there started a breakfast uh Tuesday mornings I forgot when it was anyway uh a Brother's breakfast Minister's breakfast and AD ministers come in and there would be ministers come in from time to time or one brother he came quite often and we knew what he believed and it was completely contrary to uh uh pretty much the rest of us but most of the time very rarely did it ever get to the place at that time that's why I kept going Michael went a few times that's why I kept going because it was just a nice breakfast we just talked about the Lord and we talked about the message and we talked about things that unifies and that we agree together and love one another and uh hug one another's neck and and that kind of thing but every once in a while something would come up and a little a little bur would get in somebody's saddle and all of a sudden there they go and they talk about well you know brother Braham said this and brother Braham said that and I'm thinking how are you ever going to convince this person it's got to take God Amen it's got to take God to reveal to them pray for them that's the number one thing we can do pray for them when they go in their own time and they're studying and they're praying and they're asking God for deliverance and guidance God can show it to them it's not if I can convince them that I'm right still doesn't do them any good right Amen brother bam said I can almost guarantee you in a lot of cases not every case that the guy on the other side has as many brother brandom saids as you do yes trust me I've been through it 30 some odd years of ministering friends I've been through it I know I've seen a lot of people I've met a lot of brothers I've seen been to a lot of message uh meetings and uh uh uh ministers meetings and church me I I've seen it from North Carolina to Florida to West Virginia to Tucson and all around trust me I've been there I know that's the thing all the time that people fuss about amen why don't you believe it like this well but brother Bram said well you know well brother brandham said this over here yeah but I believe what he said here more than what he said over there no no you can't do that right amen cuz what he's saying here doesn't contradict what he said over there that's right amen there might be a new light on it that the lord gave him over the time of his ministry that's right amen because there are some of those things but you you can't as much as the devil tries to make make it contradict it doesn't amen nor does it contradict the scripture nor does the the scripture contradict itself but that's the thing that people will focus on no when Oneness comes look 37th verse Acts 2:37 after all that that God did now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ not some titles but be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord for that promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call now that just pretty much encompasses any human that draws a breath amen whomever God calls wherever they are whoever they are whatever Nation religion tongue whoever God can bring each one of them and how do we come together with them in this same because we receive the same Holy Ghost we receive the same Holy Ghost as they receive that's the Holy Ghost is not going to treat them over there different than he's treating us right the Holy Ghost is not going to treat that church down the street any different than he's treating us it's the same Holy Ghost and it's a God that does not change praise the Lord and with many other words did they did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this unw toward UNT generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same same day they were added unto them about 3,000 souls and when's the last time you've been to a church service where 3,000 people were added that day in one sermon one message I've been in some good services for him but I've never seen 3,000 at one time I've seen couple dozen maybe maybe even up to 50ish or so be baptized at one time but never have I ever seen now maybe there's some overseas or something that goes this different than here but 3,000 in one message praise the Lord we'd have to build a new church really quick wouldn't we I don't think 3,000 people fitting here and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship in a Breaking of bread and in prayer and fear Came Upon every soul and and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common praise the Lord that be beautiful God was up there now and God was here now say the same thing about us amen not just this church not just a city you know all over the world have all things common praise the Lord nothing nothing would be withheld from us nothing nothing would be off limits nothing would be out of reach that we would be able to do as a bride nothing amen we would talk about a Rapture amen praise the Lord they had all things common sold their possessions Goods parted them to all men so every man had need as every man had need and they continued daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house to eat their meat with gladness and singleness of part praising God having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved amen what an exhortation friend as much as God sent brother brandom to break down denominational barriers there were probably more denominational barriers after he left than when he was first came not his no fault of his that's right I mean brother bam even he even quit the field one time he's like the harder I preach and the more I go the worse the people get right yes I I scream and yell about bobhair women next time I go to the same place there's more of them than the were last time I was here right not not a fault of his did his duty but there's probably more division than even when he came and the one thing one of the focuses he had was to tear down those denominations walls amen praise the Lord and and I don't and look I'm not talking about denomination walls I'm not talking about Methodist walls I'm not talking about Catholic walls or Pentecostal walls I'm talking about message walls message denomination walls that's right amen because there's tons of denominational message walls yeah in this message let me finish by by reading this now this is a beautiful quote I've read this quote many times a total Deliverance 1957 he should he said that should be the motive of every Christian in every person in in the church is for to unify ourselves and stick together whatever the church vote for that's what we should stand for then say for instance that they want to change something in the church well then if trustees wants to or somebody else wants to deacons they want to change something come before the church and the church then together and if it's our idea here seems to be a little different than what the whole church wants or does let's sacrifice our idea because that's the only way we can stand United amen too many many times that thing sticks in a person I never wanted it that way to begin with amen instead of letting forgetting about just letting whatever it is your mind your thought your IDE Let It Go yes and come because it's the greater good amen if they weren't in one if they weren't one at the Tower of Babel and one says well I think we should use this the other says well I think we should use this well we should we should have it go this way instead of that way we should go this High instead of that high it should be this wide instead of that white and they just fuss and complain how God would have never had a reason to come down and say they're going to do what they want to do no they were one they had come together as one no doubt they were humans they had different ideas different opinions of things just like we all do today different ideas opinions amen but we sacrifice that brother R's talking about sacrif if I had brother Adam even said if I have a different idea I'm just one vote brother Adam said that I'm just one vote he said if my idea is different I sacrific that amen for the good of the church now if he had thus sayith the Lord that's something totally different amen thus sayith the Lord uh is is instruction from God not just an opinion or a thought amen now he says let's sacrifice that idea because that's the only way we can stand United and and if this church will just go on the way you're going now and be United together God will it is unlimited what God will do if we just stick together now that's what he's talking about of that church of there speaking in brandom Tabernacle it's unlimited what God will do with this church if we just stick together amen I I believe that's the same thing he's talking about the scripture how many we read two places now that we have that the unity of the people brought about results the unity at the Tower of Babel Unity on the day of Pentecost brought about results positive results of God on the day of Pentecost because that's when the spirit fell after they were in one mind yeah they came in one mind in one Accord and then the spirit fell on them now I asked them what would happen what would it be not just our church we could say our church brother Bram said brandom Tabernacle there we'd say the same thing for our church the greater vision of that then is in our little portion we do that as a congregation and our little portion to give what about the other Church down the street and the one uh the other nations and and the bride around the world right that come together now it's not a matter of saying okay I think we need a new air conditioner yeah that's a good idea let's vote on it I think we have a little money in the in the offering Let's uh uh let's get a you a new air conditioner nothing like that we're talking spiritual the thing that brings the results in our lives and as a bride spiritually that means the most amen air condition is nice to have especially in Tucson uh but that doesn't bring the spiritual results we look for and desire more the spiritual result than anything else now if we do that around the world it is an unlimited I will use brother bram's words around the world it is unlimited what God will do for all of us internationally around the world Amen people think well we we need a we we need a new Revival let's let let's just all come and have some meetings oh that's good but I tell you friend i' I've been I've been in thousands of meetings literally thousands of meetings special speakers if you will people coming together by the tens and by the hundreds even by the I've been in meetings where they've been by the thousands and have meetings together you think well that's wonderful what more on that can we do let's have prayer meetings oh that's great people have prayer meetings that's good I think brother po I'm going to be out of town but brother PO is having a Brother's prayer breakfast and God bless him that's wonderful those that can do that but now what do where do the results come from where there's it there has to be something you say well that that that's all we can do I I beg to differ yeah uh there there's so much more that can be done outside of just coming together to to pray together and have a breakfast that's wonderful though that's good I'm glad that's uh the brothers doing that that's uh God bless him for that but where is the true together this the true Unity the true Oneness the true one mind and one Accord the true the the true part of of of forgetting about the differences and coming together as a bride coming together as a church coming together under our common language amen our common mind of I tell you a friend personally a a Rapture is not going to happen until that takes place that's just a bottom line a Rapture is not going to happen until that takes place right so God help us all around the world amen amen and God helped me to work on forgetting about the things that divide and concentrate on the things that you unify that bring us together amen we do that as a church we do that as a bride we do that internationally Amen in our city in our state around the world amen help me help us to do our part Amen to bring that Unity to reality amen let's stand if we could the world's coming together under that Oneness yes amen the world's coming and unifying together under that Oneness I believe it's a bride's time it's not this not the world's time this is the bride's time this is our time that's right the world's had their time and and of course once the bride's gone she'll she'll have a time that's for sure uh not a time that I'd want to be involved in but they're going to have a time uh it's going to be a time all right but uh I want to be I I want to be together with him together in in that unification not in the world's unification amen praise the Lord Jesus Amen Let me see I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God Amen it's 271 in the book like Miche is going to try to
