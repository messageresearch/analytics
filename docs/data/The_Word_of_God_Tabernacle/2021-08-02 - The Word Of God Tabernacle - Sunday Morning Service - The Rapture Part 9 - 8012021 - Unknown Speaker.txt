open up everything i'm going to dump it all out i'm going to look i have looked and looked and looked for this thing and i went before the lord in his body where i'm hid and i went to the altar and i said lord i just ask you to the blood of jesus christ i need that wallet please give it to me yes this morning the fellas needed a little bite to eat so we stopped and so we stopped by uh jack-in-the-box on the corner river and uh oracle here and i went in to get some money and this is what i saw man amen amen thank you jesus hallelujah thank the lord amen amen i would like i would like to add this testimony so some of you know that i go to nogales for my dental work and so i was going to use a certain credit card that's approved by my credit union to work over there okay so i like i was holding my debit card in my hand to make sure that you know at the counter i was making sure i gave him the right card and so i was looking at my debit card and noticed that and looked at the date expired so this was in nogales and when i got home because you know you take things out that you don't want to take across the border and then so when i got home i was putting the things back in and i noticed the debit card the last time i saw it was in my hand okay i couldn't find it anywhere and the same as just so this like this is perfect this is like a double testimony yeah yeah with believers amen so i was i was like oh you know so i i went and i called the credit union you know canceled it blah blah blah blah you know quickly oh my goodness it's in nogales and uh and um so then

of our lives and what he's doing for us amen and i know i put it out on the general text but i'd also like to give thanks and praise for brother dennis's report coming back negative amen that's wonderful praise the lord amen god is so good you know how the devil tried to scare him we talked about that the other day the devil trying to scare brother dennis you know once you've been through

this chemo and all this mess again is no no in jesus name right it is negative and it was naked praise the lord god is so good in me amen love the testimonies just love to see the lord working in our lives that's what's real amen you know the lord comes and ministers to our lives and our needs and our hearts and brings his word to us and builds faith in our lives and then when that faith begins to operate and you see it manifesting itself in your life you think praise the lord jesus see what other life is or is better to live amen our brother phil there is testified of his struggles as he's had but you know i've just committed to the lord give it to him amen and let god take control of it you know i think that's sometimes what happens me and michael were talking about this even with the affliction the code of this stuff is going on now people get to the place oh i'm i'm a child of god i could never get that you know that's the first thing that god's going to take that pride down a notch amen you better be careful yeah we're children of god amen but but humbly and thankfully to god and his protection amen and god and his watching after and keeping us amen so god is so good to us it's nothing to get prideful about give him the glory and honor recognize i'm nothing without him amen i would be nothing i'd be laying in the ditch or in a grave somewhere if it weren't for god almighty amen amen so i'm so very thankful his hand is upon our lives and blessing and keeping us amen and um it's not unusual that sister matisse requested prayer because when he gave his testimony phil i felt to pray for you so if you want to come on up right now we'll pray for you right now the spirit of god is moving right now and i just want to lay hands on you and we're going to bind together in faith and believe the lord's going to touch you but you have to know friend you've got to give it to him you can't do it on your own no human kidney don't let it depend upon your human ability and your in your your will to to get rid of it you just committed to him can you do that okay amen are you willing to do that then we're going to bond and believe together lord jesus father we stand here with phil lord just trusting and believing your hand upon him lord you brought him back here lord another sunday and god he's testified to the pride in his life lord but now we know god that that pride has been taken down but we believe lord that is he's come here humbly lord with his head bowed lord before these people today god unashamed of the faults in his life but expecting you lord jesus to move upon him right now god he just testified with his mouth that he cannot do it and he's not going to depend on his own personal will but believe and trust you god to cleanse him and to heal him and to take this addiction from him and make him perfectly well father may the next time somebody comes and offers this to him may it be so repulsive lord that he even vomits god may have become so deplorable to him it makes him sick to his stomach and god made you touch him you bless him you take it from him lord it's his life as he wants to dedicate and consecrate his life into your hands that you would take him lord into yourself and lord from this day forward it'll be a new day for him in you lord jesus so god may you wrap your arms around him right now lord take him into your protective care yes deliver him and strengthen him father as we bind our faith together as a congregation today and committed to you lord for our brother now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen amen amen let's stand to our feet if we could we're going to turn to uh uh first thessalonians same place we've been the past eight sundays first thessalonians chapter four amen first thessalonians chapter 4 we want to begin with verse 13. thank the lord for blessing us with another beautiful week welcome to august hard to believe isn't it amen and we're already in august uh but uh but here it is and welcome to it and god bless you thank you for being here today thank you if you're streaming or if you archive this amen i pray the lord bless you with what he would speak to us today amen good to see you too derek appreciate you coming and being with us today amen i pray so let's bow our heads if we could for another word of prayer uh i think phil remembers but derek if you need to use the restroom it's out the door to the right just in case you might need to so let's just bow our heads for word of prayer lord jesus we're so thankful father of your blessings and love to us god we just feel your spirit moving so powerfully and real lord may the supernatural god again to begin to unfold itself to us father in this day and this hour and this service that you've given us father may your holy spirit god bless each one of us and continue to sweep through this place as you did on the upper room on the day of pentecost lord fill everyone lord re-anoint us with your spirit we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way god that you would get the glory and the honor and the praise for all that is said and done may we let allow in our spirit lord the the liberty of the holy spirit to move in and out amongst us lord move in among the avenues of our hearts and these chairs these places where we're sitting lord god when it came down in the upper room on that day it said it came to where they were sitting and filled all the house lord we pray that you do that again lord to us now lord and may your holy anointing god come fresh as you would speak to us from your word lord may this holy spirit this word god come forth reveal yourself to us again today in a greater way is so wonderful lord jesus i just my heart's exploding to hear the testimonies lord and the faith moving amongst this little group and what you're continuing to do for us lord yes there are those that are homesick today those that are needy those that are in desperation father lord backaches with shariah lord or sister julie last night getting stricken but god we believe in the name of jesus christ that they are already healed father let these testimonies if they're listening and hearing right now let these testimonies be a witness to them father the power and the of almighty god and lord the the mindfulness you are of us god i pray that you would speak to us from your word once again lord may you use these lips lord for whatever you have to be spoken lord anoint the ears as well god did all we can do would be pleasing to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen second first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we read these few verses again but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then all also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel of the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words god bless you can be seated if you like amen appreciate the lord's goodness amen amen and i want to take another avenue of what we had spoke on last week we begin to speak upon the the conditioning or the resulting condition or the condition the rapturing condition that the world would be in when we're looking for that rapture to take place amen and you know down through the ages there's been little spots of this and little things of that and you know a little situations that's arose you say oh that scripture of that scripture but you know friend we can't just take a scripture or we can't just even take a small block of scripture if we want to look at what the lord's doing we have to take the entirety of the word and re-examine the entirety of that word with what we see that's going on around us and knowing the time that we live and recognizing the prophet and the message has been sent to us in this day and what he told us what god told us through that message and through that tate uh that that ministry that tape that we can put on and listen to today and recognize the day that we're living and and i believe that we're living in the day of the coming of the lord i believe we're leaving living in the seas of the coming of the lord this is a time and season of a rapture and that rapture is what we've all been looking for that body changes what we've been attaining to and and trusting the lord for and as we see the things that's going on around us is becoming more and more blurred about what's going on in the world but it's becoming clearer and clearer about what god is doing in his bride and that's the main focus that we need to continue to have is what is god doing amongst us what is god doing when you hear the testimonies just three in one service of the few that we have here today of god moving in our midst and proving to us that his word is true and if we have faith and believe that god's going to manifest what he said he would do we've heard it today we've known that we've had it in our lives but just the three times i want you to understand the witness that is yes three is perfection amen and the witness that has been given just this week of those few people it's uh of us just as few people that are here of what god is doing and helping increase our faith and build our faith because it's going to take that kind of faith for a body change but now as we look at the condition that's going on in the world today the best word i can think of that would uh identify what's going on in the country in the world today would be the word lawlessness lawlessness is what rules the day lawlessness is what's going on uh in a place that we use the thing that i used to think was very uh uh very much about laws and rules and and standards and and people keeping what's theirs and taking care of what's theirs and respecting what's other people's and what belongs to other people but it's got to the place now that uh they they want to try to make sure they keep you shackled down by their own constrictions especially with the things that's going on in the disease world but they want to keep you conformed to that while everything else around is going on like a swirling vortex of lawlessness when everybody else is invading everybody else's everything they try to keep you bound down to say well if you want to be protected you want to keep everybody else protected you want to make sure that everybody's safe and all well you know the number one thing to do then is to get rid of the criminal yes lawlessness start obeying start fulfilling or or uh holding up to the laws making sure the laws are are actually held up to and if they're not being held up to then there needs to be a consequence friend there can be a law all day long but if there's no consequence to the law it is if though it doesn't exist right if nothing happens when someone breaks the law if nothing happens to that person more times than not unless they get christ in their life they're going to continue their lawless ways and that's what's going on today lawlessness everywhere is even got to the place that the law of biology is becoming blurred so much that there's actually medical professions out there that say that there's men women and there's men and women and there's those that are in between or uh there's uh they can choose to be a man or they can choose to be a woman i it's become to where it's not even politically correct to say man and woman anymore it's just a person it's just an individual it's like reducing humanity to a glob of meat and that's just like that's all you are just completely denying true real honest biology that god made a man and god made a woman right and every human that's been born ever since then has either been a male or a female right but it's got to the place you can't even say mother's day anymore it's birthing person day now to me you say well brother newton now what's that got to do with the law that's the law of nature that's lawlessness in the fact that it's divine the defined the very fact of the law of god from the very beginning god made a man and then he made it one even in the animal kingdom you've got a male a a cow and a female cow how do you think god reproduces after the fall uh how god has allows the properties of reproduction to bring forth more cows because there's a male and there's a female right they even this just struck me i showed my wife the other day they're now coming out with new emojis that show a man pregnant now of course it's an emoji it's not an actual human because that's biologically ridiculous but it's defying the laws of god defying the laws of nature the things that god had set forth just complete lawlessness it doesn't even exist oh you can be whatever you want no you can't right that's right you're a man or you're a woman biologically you're born that way your chromosomes tell you whether you're a man or woman you you got an x or you got a y it's one or the other but the lawlessness see i mean can you imagine a phone emoji now i saw this on a news thing i don't know if it's on my phone or your phone or not that you can actually do it but they're actually coming out with those of an emoji you can use on your phone that shows a man pregnant on such filth lawlessness lawlessness rules today and that's where we're at let's go over to matthew chapter 24. i wanted to finish off today with a certain segment that i've been wanting to talk about since i started this rapture but it seems like every week the lord has had something else come up and i thought well i'll bring that in when i finish this today and then the lord just filled it up so much yesterday so i'll just have to be next week so we'll see what the lord does with it about next week but matthew chapter 24 i don't want to tell you because uh um well i've mentioned it before you know it's not a secret but matthew 24 let's start with verse one i i'm looking at a specific part of this and i was going to begin later down in 24 but i want to start with the first verse matthew 24 verse 1. talking about the end of the world talking about the end times talking about rapture time into the age and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and it happened didn't it amen and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world says three questions you all know we've gone through this before but three questions the disciples ask him there tell us when these things shall be what shall be the sign of thy coming question number two and of the end of the world so we're talking about the sign of his coming which is where we're at question number two basically is what we're talking about the sign of his coming which is the sign the things we're talking about the condition of the world and the signs that were that we see that's going on around us the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and the end of the world amen the end of the world as in the annihilation of the world order the burning over of this planet that we live on because we know that even when it ends that we're going to come and live here for a thousand years in the millennium on this earth right here right it's just going to be in a different condition a glorified cleansed condition amen and and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you oddly that that's the first thing that jesus would say after there are three questions after the three questions was the first thing he said take heed that no man deceive you that's the first thing amen for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many now christ is just anointed right so what it's basically saying is many shall come in my name saying i'm an i am anointed i have an anointing i am an anointed of the lord right right so that's what christ is jesus is his name christ is anointing so he's the lord jesus christ okay he's lord father christ the anointing is the holy spirit so many who come to my name saying i am christ i got the anointing follow me see but that is going to deceive many now who will it not deceive it will not deceive those who have the holy spirit those who are born again cannot be deceived because they've become the word everyone else can be will be deceived and that's why you see so much of it going on and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet so we said well brother newton has always been wars and rumors of wars have been fighting and i mean in the garden of eden caleb kane killed abel that's a an act of war it's not necessarily a war but it's an act of war can't kill a gable so he said well that's been the beginning well see notice here because a lot of people look at this and say well this is happening yeah but what else is happening what are the other uh uh indications the other signs that we're looking at well this is one of them but now jesus said but the end is not yet for nations shall rise against nation kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of sorrows yes that's just the beginning then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and that's the reason i see there's a lot of people out there say oh they hate me but why yeah see there's a people that's going to be hated for the for christ but there's others that are hated just because of their personality oh and they hate me because i'm a christian no they hate you because you're mean and ugly and that happens too many times a person's personality drives people away and people dislike them because of that reason now oh they persecute because of jesus no you need to be nicer you need to be a sweeter person you need to be more cordial and more inviting and and and and more loving to people sometimes and that's just that's a general conception i'm not talking about us here i'm just saying generally of course if the shoe fits wear it right if you are that way don't be that way amen but a lot of times people say oh they hate because of jesus no they they hate you because you're not a nice person a lot of times that happens but there is that group now those people that that they will be hated they will be despised they will be made fun of that's where the scoffers come from friend the scoffers come from those people that despise you and hate you because you do display and manifest uh jesus christ and they don't like it now a lot of times they don't like it because it condemns them a lot of times they don't like it maybe either other professing christians because they can't replicate what you have because they're not born again and if they're not born again they can't live the life that you live because you must jesus said you must be born again it's the only way to live that life the only way to be able to project that image and to be that kind of person is to be born again if you're not born again you can't do it and other people despise you because you do it oh you're just a goody goody oh you're you're just old-fashioned or you're just a holy roller whatever name or whatever thing they want to tag on us they tell you those things you know but the truth of it is they despise you because you're a godly person and they're not right maybe they hate you because they are condemned by your presence maybe they hate you again because they can't have what you've got they can't live that way there's a lot of people come and say oh i i i see that message but i can't live that way we'll get bored again and you will get the holy ghost and you will live because if you're born again you don't have any other way or reason or point or want to live any other way if you're born again you don't want to live any other way much less i can't live it and you can't live it because you're not bored again right i mean that's that's i hate to be so blunt for him but it seems like that the bluntness is it was kind of blunt last week too but i i just have to say what god puts on my heart you can look this ain't in my notes so that's just what the lord gives to me but that's just the truth yes amen that's the bottom line fact a lot of times that's the situation they will hate you but now verse 10 this is a point i want to get to and then shall many be offended let's just read through this and i'll go back and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now we've got an abundance of iniquity correct that's what he said right because the iniquity shall abound so that brings an abundance of iniquity well what is iniquity iniquity if you look in this in the the definition iniquity is lawlessness right uh brother random says it two different ways he says lawlessness uh he said iniquity is doing something you know you should not do right that's iniquity but he also says iniquity is not doing something you know you should do right now so it's from both directions which basically the bottom line is it's lawlessness right lawlessness lawlessness or iniquity i looked up iniquity again and and there is a phrase in there that struck me this time that i guess i just hadn't seen it before but there's a part of that definition that actually says iniquity is a contempt for the law someone that actually has a contempt for the law yeah oh you see the law breakers today you see them running out well sometimes they don't even walk out they just fill up a big huge bag full of clothes and whatever they just walk out the front door they'd steal it and nobody stops them somebody in california tried to stop somebody from stealing stuff in a rite aid they shot the man dead part-time security guard he didn't need to lose his life over a few aspirin but he did just because he tried to stop somebody from stealing stuff out of the store yeah but they'll just help they'll keep it all up throw it on the back and just walk out the door yeah lawlessness a contempt iniquity a contempt for the law that's that's the very nature of what of what lawlessness is is a contempt for the law well they don't obey the law because they have a contempt they they hate the law oh that you got no law you have anarchy people just live and do however they want yeah but kill you no repercussions steal everything you got no repercussion right and then what happens you don't have a civil society then it's just it's just a free for all amen there's no law iniquity abounding so we see iniquity abounding now again remember this is still in the context of jesus explaining to the disciples or trying to answer the questions what uh what uh when shall these things be what is the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world the sign of the coming see this is all in that same context so the abundance here the abounding of iniquity is going to be in the context of jesus describing to them of what it's going to be like when he returns and that's what we got that's what we're looking at another thing that we see abounding today is is that iniquity but now why did the iniquity get so abundant now i told you last week and i do believe this that iniquity and the lawlessness that's going on didn't begin in the government it didn't begin with the defund the police it didn't begin with the contempt for law enforcement or any of that and and everybody makes mistakes uh sometimes a mistake especially when you're in the in the capacity of being a police officer sometimes your mistake is is taking a life yeah sometimes when you're a judge you might make a mistake and send an innocent person to jail sometimes being a juror you might make a mistake and send an innocent person to jail so sometimes mistakes have more great consequences than just saying what am i going to have for dinner tonight and eating something bad and staying up all night as a result now you don't feel good but you didn't send an innocent person to jail you didn't put an innocent person in the grave amen so it it's within the context you understand what i'm saying it's got to be within that context right right so it didn't begin there the lawlessness did not begin in the government it didn't begin with a a president or or laws or legislation it didn't begin there i said this last week lawlessness and the contempt for it began behind the pulpit in the churches amongst people who say that they're christians and with pastors who have no business being behind the pulpit yeah that won't call a spade a spade and whites white and black's black a man's a man and a woman's a woman amen right they don't want to say that they don't want to tell the truth so when they became watered down what happened to society see we're not reformers friend we're we're here to preach the gospel god commissioned his children for one purpose and that was not to reform people not to build hospitals not to build police stations not to uh uh have restaurants he called us for one thing and that is to preach the word not just me every one of us yeah now all those social activities and things they're nice and they have their place we need to go to school learn to read and write uh add and subtract um i i don't want to learn how what a horrible wicked person i am uh but i do i would like to learn how to read or write or do math we need hospitals they're important right we need police officers they're important we need our government they're important they're a part of our democracy in this country the greatest country in the world my opinion but god didn't call us as christians to do that right our job is to preach the word amen everywhere you go everybody you meet if you can if you feel led to everywhere you go your let your life minister if your lips don't let your life minister that you're you're a christian you're a godly person you're born again you're filled with the holy spirit let that let that word minister but the lawlessness began in church it began behind the pulpit because god didn't look this is satan's eden yes satan and we'll get to this in a minute but satan is the god of this world millions worship him and don't even know it yes he said oh they got an upside down cross or a pentagram or a dead chicken or blood on the door whatever and they say all these things all this all satanism that's just something that's blatantly brought to you by as satanism right satanism is anything that doesn't worship the true living god almighty jesus christ amen amen anything outside is satanism yes and it is satan amen and he is the god of this world yes all the systems of this world and everything about it is of the devil amen you hear an ambulance one down the road they're going to go help somebody but it is of the devil right yes thank god for them i'm glad they're there how many times we need them yeah but it's not our world this is not our world we're soldiers and pilgrims here saints all this economy and everything about the world order is of the devil yeah amen all of it god never god never intended us to rely on the government to get a social security check at the end of the month god never called us to rely upon medicare medicaid to help our medical expenses so that we can take care of going to the doctor and things that was never supposed to be that way god never intended for there to be a uh a bunch of give away let's just say it that way from the government god we weren't intended to be taken care of by the government we were intended to be taken care of by god yes all these social activities were supposed to be and should be given out and regulated by god's people the church yes and in a perfect society it works that way but as the society as the pulpit weaken as the churches became faithless they began to move over and and relinquish their rights and responsibilities over into the hands of the government right now there's nothing wrong with getting a social security check nothing in the world wrong with good because you put your money into it you should get it back right amen one of the worst social well i thought it was one of the worst social programs we had thanks roosevelt but now i see medicare medicaid they say they want social medicine i'm sorry i'm just giving you what's on heart and and i know what it's like in canada with socialized medicine and now i hear the things that they're doing in hospitals now when i was a kid the things they're saying in the hospital now is just um unconceivable the things they're doing with sister julie's uh dad they've helped him a lot and he's coming along and he's doing much better and actually i think he should be going home i think the best medicine for that man right now is to go home and be with his family and sleep in his bed and eat his food that's my opinion but if she were to take him out of the hospital she would lose all of her medicare benefits so you basically trapped it wasn't intended to be that way saints it was intended for us to take care of ourselves right the poor the needy the it used to be the poor and the needy they didn't go to the steps of the capitol they didn't go to their mailboxes they didn't go to the mayor's office they went to the churches yeah because that's where the help was supposed to come from that's the way it's supposed to be god's children are supposed to take care of their own it just doesn't happen that way right because it became so weak and faithless now praise the lord he's he's operated or opened up a way that we as his children even though have the social benefits that come with living in this cosmos we ourselves are becoming blessed with what god does for us every day by faith and the testimonies that we heard today amen amen medicine cannot help a man who has a growth in his back and is expecting and believing it to be non-cancerous doctor can't do that right right all the doctor can treat as the result it's cancer all i know to do is take it out and give you chemo amen but when you rely upon god you can know that god will say there's nothing to that thing right amen it is not cancerous praise the lord amen who in the world can any government facility today come and tell you where your purse is where your card is where your tool is and put it exactly where you would find it in a place you looked a dozen times before and it was not there that's right how many times have we done that amen and that's and we've had it happen numerous times it's just god yes and the testimonies are are just powerful that's the way it's supposed to be that's the way it's supposed to operate amen and that's what god does for us lawlessness iniquity has taken over it's abounding the abundance of iniquity has caused the love of many to wax coal now it doesn't mean anything for people like i said last week i i i see news reports of an old lady walking through a bus station and three or four teenagers just attack her and beat her to a pole steal her walker and her credit card or whatever piece of money i see a woman walk down the street in new york city and some guys walking past her just punches her right in the face and knocks her flat the murders i just saw last night another four-year-old shot in critical condition i don't know maybe it may have passed but i don't know in critical can four years old stray bullets flying everywhere yeah amen people knives killing because the the love is wax cold right right you know and and the division that comes from it now i'm going to say something real quick and may say more about this after service but i'm going to say something real quick and i want you to hear me and hear me loud if you're here and if you're on streaming this covet thing is of the devil right and we know what it is god may have allowed it but it's of the devil right and every aspect of it has come and i gave you this warning a year ago when we were still on country club every aspect of it is to try to tear you apart yes from the very beginning i told you that the devil was going to use this to try to divide us when the mass came along and everybody was divided in their corners mass no mass people i told you satan's going to try to use that to divide us now the vaccines are calm you got people that are vaccinated people that aren't and i told you that's what satan is going to try to do to divide us but friend i'm determined by the grace of god almighty that it is not going to do that here amen amen do not let that devil defeat you by dividing us and separating us and making us a powerless group right yes he's a liar the truth is not in him amen you do what you feel that to do with god yeah you get to shock they ain't nothing in the world wrong with that yes if you don't get it then fine it doesn't bother me a bit i don't have it and i don't plan to take it right but that's only because i just i don't feel to do it people do and that's fine i don't have a problem with that at all i love you with everything and and you're my brother my sister in the lord amen and that's all that matters amen amen i trust you have the leading of the holy ghost in your life as i pray you trust i do and we'll continue on as a group and god and we're not going to let the devil defeat us with this and provide us with that's right amen i said it over a year ago i'm going to say it again today don't let it happen don't let the devil do it see that's the one thing that makes me believe that a lot all this is demonically controlled because of the spirits that come out of this thing yes you can recognize something if it's of god the type of spirits that are being manifested from this thing wouldn't be the way they are that's true it's only of the devil when it's when it's that kind of demonic spirit when people are out there saying that i wish everybody unvaccinated would die and get get away from us that is not a good spirit right amen amen when there's people out there that are well i i'm i'll go stop there don't let it divide us friend yeah amen amen don't let it defeat you praise the lord do you believe that the lord can can tell you brother john to do something and not tell brother dennis to do it that's correct yes i do i don't believe we're cookie cutter christians right amen i believe god can tell you to do one thing and tell me to do something else and god will protect us and be with us all right and then now what matters right amen but you see that hatred that's exactly what the devil's trying to do that's the spirit of the devil yes amen it's the spirit of the enemy but let's look how did it get that way that that'd be a question then how did it get to that point let's go back to the 10th verse that many shall be offended that's the first place it starts right somebody becomes offended they get the feelings hurt amen and oh my goodness don't we have a boatload of snowflakes in this country today they their feelings are on the tip of their nose and if you breathe on it the wrong way you offend them right they're so hurt so offended so torn apart it's just sad to know and to and to see this that's going on but people get offended so easy it is and it's something to guard yourself with if you've read my book you obviously know that whole scenario that i'm talking about but if that that offense is the first thing that comes getting a person's feeling hurt is the first point of separation that the devil will drive between two people or two groups of people that's true or whoever that offense will be the first wedge that'll try to separate you because as soon as you become offended then then you feel differently towards that person right and not in a good way and shall betray one another now offense leads to betrayal because a lot of times you get your feelings hurt somebody says something cross or something bad or somebody makes a mistake or somebody says something to somebody maybe the loose lips sink ships they shouldn't have and he shouldn't have said something and all of a sudden that person gets offended and most of the time that offended person is not going to go to that person to defend him and say look you offended me with that statement you offended i heard you said something about me and that offended me that hurt my feelings give the person a chance to recant and apologize and make it right but see the devil doesn't want you to do that right right so what's he doing he causes you as a human to take the path of least resistance which is what keep your mouth shut let your feelings all boil inside to the next available reliable uh uh source of ears to hear your complaint listens to you oh you should have heard what brother and brother so-and-so said about me right and all of a sudden you got somebody else who is a mutual friend now you've got them listening to the garbage that you have because you were offended amen and people get offended it's not the wrong being offended you shouldn't be but uh but but it happens yes but the worst thing to do is to go tell somebody else that you got offended by this person right and then of course there's you know nobody is a human we don't embellish anything do we we don't make this story bigger than it really was we don't do that of course that's the first thing we're probably going to do is embellish on oh they said so and then you add a few things and you know i was just thinking too that someone's on and then all of a sudden your imagination your thoughts and and then all of a sudden you've already made another enemy out of somebody who wasn't even offended this person 10 minutes ago right and now what have you done you've betrayed your trust with that individual with somebody else and now that person goes to somebody else well eventually the person that was the original offender is going to hear about it and say well how dare he say that about me out there and then all of a sudden now what have you got you got a complete split people have been hurt offended now they betrayed one another and because they betrayed one another they begin to hate one another and that's a scripture events betrayal hatred that's the trifecta of satan to divide people to get offended then to betray one another so now all of a sudden you hate one another and you you separate and a lot of times you go and ask him say it's just like when me and my buddy when i was 10 12 years old we would have a knock down drag out beat each other to a pulp fight we'd get 15 minutes into it we'd get up and shake ourselves and said well what were you even fighting about right i don't remember let's go play basketball and that was the end of it all right yeah he just didn't even forget what what was it about i don't i don't know i don't remember you ask me well i don't know but i hate them but why do you hate them what do they do to you right well i guess nothing really but you what i heard that's the worst thing what i heard and you hear people and people say stuff all the time and it's just offensive it's hurtful it betrays trust and when trust gets betrayed then people start to hate one another and that's exactly what the that's the devil's stupid that's exactly what the devil wants to do to divide and separate god's children that's right i'm telling he's not gonna let we're not gonna let him do it amen amen amen we're not gonna let him do it then many offended betray hate and because everybody's hating one another then the lawlessness begins to abound the iniquity abounds because see the world out here and i hope this is no offense to you brother john but this world out here tells me i should hate him right and he should hate me and we should be at odds with each other just cause our skins different colors amen and then he should hate my wife because that she's a mexican sword brother dennis is lydia it's just normal whatever and we're all we're supposed to be all fighting each other right you know and hating each other because you know i've done nothing but oppressed people of color my whole life because i'm white so that's what i do it's nothing but to divide and separate it's out there to try to make you hate me me hate you you hate one another so that there's no love right there's no love of god and no love of humanity and you see it broadcast all over the world all over the country anyway newscasts all over the place disingenuous people that don't report the news anymore they just report their own propaganda in whatever way they want you to believe it yes and a lot of it is being driven all of it is being driven by the devil yeah to bring separation and hatred towards one another and a hatred towards humanity well friend if there's a hatred for humanity i don't think anything about taking stuff from you that doesn't belong to me i don't think anything about killing you or your children or or hurting you or knocking you out or or robbing you of your stuff it doesn't mean anything to me to walk in and take something that doesn't belong to me because i deserve it because i hate you you hate me iniquity lawlessness friend i am my life now i'm not saying it's never been like this before we've had it in the luvian world and the flood with noah but never been this way but in my life i've never seen it like it is today right never seen it the way it is today it's just amazing how satan and his eden has been able to take humanity and turn it into a a cesspool a cesspool of filth and that's the sad part of it but it's scriptural yeah it's supposed to be in the bible offense to betrayal the hatred the iniquity where the love grows cold and that that love is god's love yes grows cold yes well my friend you hardly ever see a filial human love for each other hardly anymore right much less a godly love they betray one another hate one ear and that's the the division the separation the the the hatred for humanity for the hatred for one another and you see the result and again it did not begin with uh uh the defunding the police or or a certain president or the government it began in the church yes weekless finalist ministers that won't preach the gospel and tell the people what god requires and expects to get people to an altar to a church but don't get them to jesus christ to not get them to a place that they become born again and filled with the holy ghost so that they leave behind just a simple thing of saying i'm a christian i go to church millions billions go to church right but not very many right are godly holy ghost-filled christians right that's scripture as well yes amen brother you not you don't know what you're talking about there's millions of words read the bible it tells you yes amen few they'll be that'll find this way amen few that'll be and and as we get up to the end time the fewer it is yes you see it you see it the same as i do friend the lawlessness that's abounding going around denying god in his word denying the very principles that god built us as humans on denying the fact that there's to say to stay civil there's simple acts of obedience that we follow i i'm not gonna leave church today with a duffel bag and go down to the target and load up and walk out the door right you're not going to do that right but there's other people in other countries or other states other cities they are lawlessness and don't think anything about it let's continue on i'm not i'm not even going to get close to where i want to be today but let's go to 2nd thessalonians but i do want to read this scripture if i have any hope of continuing where i want to next week the lord willing and i do uh i want to get in contact with the brother i've mentioned to y'all before i want to have come and minister for us he was back in jeffersonville maybe he's back in tucson now i want to have him the next couple weeks or so as well so we'll see how that goes but have the lord lead i'll let you know however it turns out but let me read the god of this evil age as you're finding ii thessalonians chapter 2 what is it the world is heading to a climax now isn't that the truth there's a climax with the bride when she gets a body change goes in the rapture that's the climax for this world and the tribulation sets in and it all gets purified why the spirit of lawlessness notice how brother branham called it a spirit of lawlessness not just a physical act but an actual spirit of lawlessness moral decay scientific religion has led to the cage of every hateful and unclean bird as the bible says in revelation 18. he said what a warning now he reads revelation 18 but i'm not going to do that now i was going to read it at the end of this but we might not have time but lord willing will still somehow the cage of every hateful and unclean bird what a warning that throws the church exactly back to revelation 3 14 to the laodicea age lawlessness real religious but lawless thou because thou sayest we have are rich and have need of nothing know us not that thou art naked miserable blind and know it not perfectly the scripture of this is perfectly the scripture of this age yes not for the scripture the age of daniel not for the ones the age of noah but in this last evil age amen the manifestation in this last evil age 2 thessalonians 2 1 now we beseech you brother by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from as from us as that the day of christ is at hand amen now look at this warning from from paul to thessalonica let no man deceive you by any means that sounds a little familiar didn't we just read that right now jesus just said that about the end time about the coming of the end in matthew 24 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now we've seen that happen it's come in earnest it well it's come in great number maybe it'll come in earnest a little later i don't know but there is will be a falling away great you know what it says there shall come a falling away that for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first people leaving the truth people leaving the word people leaving this message denying it not believing it right saying all manner of thing against the prophet of course but we won't get into that but just leaving the word leaving the truth falling away well have you seen it as much as in this last day as it has the past since brother branham was gone does it say the last hundred years the falling away people leaving not leaving church not leaving uh going to uh their churches or even preaching but leaving the true revealed word yes right the people leaving by the hundreds thousands i don't know amen leaving it and they and they leave it on both sides they don't leave it just because they get away from it don't have anything to do with it they also leave it by going over and saying brother branham's god and baptizing in his name and all these other you leave the word both ways right right amen you fall away or go away from the word in either direction sometimes to combat the people that say brother branham was god they go so far the other way that they don't even want to speak his name yeah well not speak his name is like saying well i can't say peter or paul or phillip or nathanael or or any of the godly men in the bible or the prophets of the bible i can't even say paul anymore if i can't say brother branham you're right right amen that that's the way i feel am i so where does that put us that puts us in in it they either fall away one way or they fall away the other right but there won't be but a small group that stays with that true pure unadulterated word yeah amen amen that's this last day let no man deceive you because there's gonna come a falling away except there come uh a following way and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition and we know that's what the message that's what the seals did right people said what was the seals for that's exactly what they did they revealed the enemy the greatest revelation of the scripture that exposed the enemy was when brother branham preached the seals the truth of the revelation of the seal yes he exposed them most people up to that time if not all christians believe that the horse rider on there in revelation 6 was jesus oh he's on a white horse it's got to be jesus even scofield has in his notes it's the purity has got to be jesus but it was the devil satan and that him being exposed so we know it's been revealed who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called god isaiah 14 or that is worship so that he as god amen he as god said in the temple of god showing himself that he is god this is satan's eating and satan is the ruler of this world yes satan is the god of this world let me read this because i'm going to have to close here god of this late evil age again notice how beautiful the scriptures tie themselves together in every age notice now when the church when the church world would not have the word of god to rule over them they accepted a murderer barabbas what did this do it exalted satan the god of this evil age to the place that he's always wanted again isaiah 14 tells us now listen for satan is not spoken as the god of any other age but this age this age he wasn't spoken of the god of noah's age he wasn't spoken of as the god of moses age he wasn't spoken of as the god of age of elijah but this evil age he said oh don't miss it he is the god of this evil age right worshiped by millions and billions of people worshipped by millions and billions of people and they don't even know it right but let's let the scripture uncover him this morning and let's see what we'll find from it know of it the god of this age it's the devil so the combating that we have is against that wickedness in high places against the demonic spirits that continue to infiltrate and hover around and try to do everything he can to get to the children of god you know my prayer i've told you what i pray for you saints that god will keep us hedged and protected that the angels of god that are encamped around about us would keep those flaming swords drawn ready for battle when any devil tries to penetrate past it yeah amen amen yes if that devil trump tries to come to get to you he's going to hit what brother brown said a billion million vote wire amen praise the lord that is feather singed when he tries to come and hit a child of god yes because god keeps you protected yes he does god keeps watch over his own yes amen if god let me say this i'm going to have to close here i'll have to pick it up next week if if if the lord allows and if there's something that comes well first of all you have to know you're a son or daughter of god right that's the first thing if you're a son or daughter of god and you've been born again and filled with the holy spirit then you are born with certain rights right and those rights are described here in god's holy word and you are entitled to every one of them yes and a part of that is god's watching over his own god protecting keeping you his children you must know that if you know that and you know god angels encamped around about you and you know that god's with you if something becomes you that is outside of what it should be then it it should be a time of self-examination yes i think right yeah lord why is this happening to me lord why do i feel this way lord why is my body going through this lord why is this taking place in my home or my family lord why when those things happen friend i believe it's a time of self-examination god why did you allow this a son of god to happen to me because there's going to be a reason if you're a son or daughter of god there's a reason why it's happening i think that's one of the best times to find a place and get along with god and talk to him and say lord did i offend you that i hurt you did i do something wrong did i offend somebody else lord is there someplace that i tripped up or messed up is there some something i did lord why has this come in my life right there's a reason why this is happening i lord i just want to know you just help me i'll make it right i'll do what i need to do lord i want to and maybe it's just for the fact that you can take that time to get with man maybe he didn't do anything wrong job didn't do anything wrong maybe you didn't say anything wrong maybe you didn't sin against him maybe he didn't sin against your brother maybe god just wants you to take that time to get along with him am i i remember a fairly well-known minister back east he's going to be with the lord now he preached for 20 years he fell on the tree hurt his back broke his back or heard it bad laid up in the hospital couldn't move and he testified afterwards he said i didn't really know god or this message until god put me flat on my back he said when god laid me out and laid up that hospital by myself all along laid on my back flat on my back hurting he said that's when i found god that really found god not just a you know an acquaintance of god but i really had a relationship he said that's where i found that's where i began to read and understand this message the lord reveal it to me it's when god had to they had to break my back to get me to see it if something is like that the maybe the lord's just trying to get your attention right maybe he only wants to get you to where you want to get on your knees along with him could be that's all it is but there's a reason for it and our responsibility lord what would be that reason amen what would be that reason the first thing that's going to come in a person's life is fear yeah and that's usually the thing that begins to grip people cause fear brother brahman said fear is one of the most powerful emotions it's like love love is love is the most powerful emotion when it's proper love but fear is one of the most demonic powerful spirits fear is that's why the devil uses it so much i brought this it came on my heart yesterday i found this brother branham wrote this book why do you think brother brown wrote this book because there were so many people scared of cancer right i mean doesn't that make common sense so

yesterday like mike said for helping him move and she said after we had dropped the truck off with her last night she got really bad sick so i just continued to remember pray for her sister priscilla put something on their facebook our our word of god tabernacle group site about trying to find a place for them their family to live still living with his parents now and uh really need to be on their own and with their family uh so just remember you know as much as the rest of us everything real estate has gotten so very expensive than two signs it's hard for a family of seven uh to find a place that's reasonably priced to live so please remember them in prayer if you would the lord just blessed them to find the place that he would have them to be for them to be able to live so amen we love you appreciate every one of you god's goodness to us you can be seated for just a few moments i asked micah if he would because um and i've debated about whether putting this on the camera or not um i think we'll just turn it off sorry if you're streaming we're gonna turn this part of it off
