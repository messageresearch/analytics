[39:05] that's why he give us life that's why he
[39:07] put us here that's our purpose we stand
[39:10] here today and every day that we walk
[39:12] through life is to delivered for him
[39:14] i mean you know i
[39:15] i basically attended three funerals this
[39:17] week
[39:19] someone in san diego
[39:21] uh appreciate each one of you the those
[39:23] that
[39:24] our local church let me
[39:26] go last weekend to be with the precious
[39:28] friends in san diego brother david
[39:30] zavala lost a very dear friend of his
[39:32] brother frank
[39:34] lucero and
[39:36] he was a good friend of mine too i
[39:37] didn't know him as well as many there
[39:40] but um i believed it was of the lord to
[39:43] go and be there with them and i believe
[39:45] the lord really moved in a special way
[39:47] there
[39:48] he was 81 he would have turned 82 this
[39:50] past friday
[39:52] and
[39:52] it was a good memorial service and
[39:54] internment and it was really a blessing
[39:56] to be able to meet his family and then
[39:58] come back so it was there monday and
[40:00] tuesday drove back wednesday
[40:03] and um went to a funeral thursday and
[40:05] friday
[40:06] here at east lawn
[40:08] some of you you probably most of you
[40:10] know brother martin and brother emanuel
[40:13] rojas passed away as well
[40:16] uh over the past month month and a half
[40:18] so we had their funerals so i guess that
[40:21] was really two funerals in one that they
[40:23] had for the two of them and
[40:25] uh and it just reminded me of how futile
[40:28] life really is
[40:30] and how we're not promised tomorrow
[40:32] but how every day that we live we should
[40:34] take it to live for the lord jesus you
[40:37] know we're all ready to go home i
[40:38] believe we're all looking for that time
[40:40] that god takes us home
[40:42] and the rapture
[40:44] but but i want to live for him every
[40:46] moment he gives me amen every second of
[40:48] every day if i can do it if i can do
[40:50] something for him drive across the
[40:52] country or be someplace for somebody and
[40:55] that's what i want to do and i brought
[40:56] back uh some of these uh the pamphlets
[40:59] that were there brother frank brother
[41:01] martin brother manuel uh if anybody
[41:03] wants to see him i only got a couple of
[41:05] each so if anybody wants to see him
[41:07] you're welcome too i know i don't know
[41:09] how well some of you knew them probably
[41:10] not brother frank at all but
[41:12] you're welcome to them if you'd like to
[41:14] but
[41:15] i'm honored to introduce a precious
[41:17] friend of mine i call him a friend i
[41:19] don't really know him very well um but
[41:23] uh we first got acquainted with each
[41:25] other at uh the ministers meeting that
[41:28] they started up in phoenix
[41:30] and um
[41:31] and i saw him but i don't think we
[41:32] actually were introduced at that at that
[41:35] uh meeting and then the last meeting
[41:37] that we had
[41:38] uh brother daniel came and sat down and
[41:41] he was sitting over there and i looked
[41:42] and looked around see who was there and
[41:44] i looked over and my eyes caught him he
[41:46] was kind of in front of me and the lord
[41:48] said have him come preach for you and
[41:50] i'm thinking lord i hardly know this
[41:51] brother i don't know what he believes
[41:53] what he teaches what his
[41:55] doctrine is or whatever and but but the
[41:58] lord said have him preach for you
[42:00] and so i said okay i try to be obedient
[42:03] best i can
[42:04] um even even in my reluctance
[42:07] and as it turned out
[42:09] uh a brother was supposed to speak at
[42:11] that meeting who did not show up so
[42:14] brother daniel took his place and when
[42:16] brother daniel spoke i heard him and i
[42:18] said okay i don't mind you
[42:20] i know why that the lord had put him on
[42:23] my heart so i went up to him at our
[42:25] lunch break and told him as much and
[42:27] we've been a little bit in contact since
[42:29] then i was hoping it wouldn't take this
[42:31] long but
[42:32] we were in a hotel room at that time our
[42:34] hotel conference room and we didn't have
[42:36] this facility and
[42:38] uh it just so happened right at that
[42:40] time the lord worked this out it was
[42:41] almost a whirlwind when we come into the
[42:44] place the lord gave us here and we've
[42:46] got some more work to do in the facility
[42:48] but the lord's blessed it and
[42:50] we're thankful to be here and it just
[42:52] seemed like the perfect timing and
[42:54] i appreciate that our brother has had
[42:56] the willingness and the desire to come
[42:58] and minister the gospel to us today and
[43:00] i appreciate that appreciate all your
[43:03] visitors come it's so good to see cara
[43:05] and be here today god bless you and
[43:07] appreciate your sister marylee god bless
[43:10] you and uh brother jeremy your family
[43:12] and and everybody that's come and uh so
[43:15] appreciate you being here today we have
[43:17] a few missing shared the prayer requests
[43:19] uh
[43:20] which actually might not be a horrible
[43:22] thing we probably need to get some more
[43:23] chairs in this case but they would have
[43:26] took up seven or eight chairs of the
[43:28] frau family seven or eight of them and
[43:30] they've had little symptoms this week
[43:32] not not covered
[43:34] because like you heard on the request
[43:36] they tested negative for covet but had
[43:38] some flu-like symptoms just figured it's
[43:40] probably the flu or something so i told
[43:42] him i said well if sunday morning you
[43:43] have some symptoms just you know don't
[43:45] come and say i know it's not covered but
[43:48] but you know i don't want flu either
[43:52] you know i don't want to be sick at all
[43:53] i've got work to do and things so i said
[43:55] you'd just be better to stay at home and
[43:57] uh so they're streaming uh they stream
[43:59] you got that there's other
[44:01] streaming so welcome to the service if
[44:02] you're streaming uh sister karen
[44:04] probably usually streams up in the white
[44:06] mountains and
[44:07] the pads so
[44:09] welcome to this service today you know
[44:10] we just take advantage of what the
[44:12] lord's given us uh and the opportunity
[44:14] that we have today
[44:16] you know i've heard so much and i'll say
[44:18] this it's just been burned on my heart
[44:19] but i want brother daniel to come and
[44:20] pour out his heart to us because
[44:22] he's got something to say the lord's
[44:24] going to use our brother today so i'm
[44:26] looking forward to that
[44:27] but i've heard so much lately especially
[44:30] not at brother frank's funeral so much
[44:31] because he was 81
[44:33] but uh so much of the taken before their
[44:35] time and
[44:36] uh i i hear that so much nowadays with
[44:40] koba taken before their time i even
[44:41] consider brother rod was taken before
[44:43] his time
[44:44] um
[44:45] precious brother but
[44:47] you know
[44:48] brother david zavala ministered brother
[44:50] frank's funeral and he actually
[44:51] eulogized him as much as he preached the
[44:53] funeral but
[44:54] uh he said something really struck my
[44:56] heart made me realize more than anything
[44:59] especially with all the fear that's
[45:00] gripped the world with this covet thing
[45:02] now um god has
[45:05] a purpose and a time for all of us if
[45:07] you're a child of god right you'll never
[45:09] convince me
[45:11] that all of these people that are
[45:12] passing now are the different ones and
[45:14] some not by covet
[45:16] several not by covet actually uh that
[45:19] that the devil was able to take them
[45:22] people before their time
[45:24] but there's different reasons for
[45:25] different things
[45:27] and
[45:28] i i come to the realization see i i
[45:30] prayed uh i know i'm sorry i'm
[45:32] elongating this but i prayed for many
[45:36] months maybe years
[45:38] about brother green had cancer
[45:41] and i talked to the lord
[45:43] several many many times
[45:47] and i said lord i said i i can
[45:49] understand a a man
[45:53] fulfilling his purpose and his duty and
[45:55] it's time for you to take him home and
[45:57] i'm
[45:58] sorry it's still tough for me but um and
[46:00] i said i understand that
[46:02] please don't take him by cancer and it
[46:04] was just my personal thing
[46:06] uh don't know
[46:08] but i gotta i got a revelation this
[46:10] weekend really doesn't matter
[46:13] coven cancer heart attack
[46:18] stroke my mother passed away last march
[46:21] stroke it doesn't matter it's just it's
[46:24] just simply a vehicle that the lord has
[46:26] used to take us home right yeah our
[46:28] heart stops or whatever it is it's just
[46:30] it's just the lord's will
[46:32] amen and i and i believe that i believe
[46:35] that god's children is his hands just
[46:38] like job he has every one of us hedged
[46:39] and there's no way the devil can even
[46:42] touch you unless god allows it for some
[46:44] reason
[46:45] and if he does there's a reason
[46:47] and we accept and trust him that in his
[46:50] perfection that it's all going to work
[46:51] out perfect amen so with this happening
[46:55] and things that's going on i'm just
[46:56] thankful that the lord's blessed us and
[46:59] he's given us this opportunity this
[47:00] service to this day and uh i welcome you
[47:04] in the name of the lord jesus so
[47:05] appreciate you coming today and we're
[47:07] going to have brother daniel if you
[47:08] would come now give us what's on his
[47:10] heart he said he's nervous
[47:12] pray for my nervousness
[47:14] i told him i said i've been doing this
[47:15] for 33 the lord actually august of
[47:19] 1988 is when i started ministering over
[47:21] 33 years now and every time i get
[47:23] nervous i pastored three churches been
[47:25] many
[47:27] churches around the country preached the
[47:28] thousands canada mexico

[47:34] church for three to four years

[47:57] we're thankful brother daniel's here
[47:58] thank you god bless you
[48:01] god bless you all
[48:05] brother i appreciate that song beautiful
[48:07] i think brother mccues used to sing that
[48:09] song right sister mary
[48:11] yeah but uh brought back his memories
[48:13] it's beautiful
[48:15] and uh
[48:16] bennett said uh he doesn't know me very
[48:18] well
[48:19] so he's a little bit maybe worried about
[48:22] what i was going to say
[48:24] but brother as you were singing that
[48:26] song
[48:27] it was it really touched my heart and uh
[48:29] brother brother bennett you know as her
[48:31] brother said i'd rather have jesus i may
[48:34] not have a lot of charisma right i may
[48:36] not be a deep theologian
[48:38] but if i'm here
[48:40] i believe you're going to get jesus
[48:42] amen that's the most important that
[48:43] matters
[48:45] brother uh newton and i met at a
[48:47] minister's meeting and um
[48:50] so they they asked me to come up to
[48:52] preach it and i don't have a lot of
[48:53] experience in
[48:55] in in that type of thing and
[48:58] uh caleb duran he was he was sitting in
[49:00] the front row right here
[49:03] and about halfway through my sermon
[49:05] um but caleb he starts
[49:08] putting his arm up like that and
[49:10] and doing this and stretching like that
[49:13] and i looked at him and and he uh he
[49:15] kept doing it for a while
[49:18] and i thought well i may have a cramp or
[49:21] something you know so then so then i
[49:23] continued on with my sermon and he just
[49:25] stopped
[49:26] and um
[49:28] so then i i finished out and then at
[49:31] lunch when we were in lunch i heard
[49:33] one of the people that said yeah when
[49:34] brother caleb raises his hand that means
[49:36] you're over your time
[49:38] so i'm about halfway done
[49:41] i won't be raising money
[49:47] well uh
[49:48] gracie you raise your hand okay
[49:52] that clock is really small in the back
[49:54] right there
[49:55] on
[49:56] purpose
[49:58] but i do i appreciate being here i
[50:00] appreciate the invitation i am
[50:03] i was in the east african country of
[50:05] malawi one time
[50:07] and uh it was it was a congregation
[50:09] maybe about twice the size the building
[50:11] was about about this size and we were
[50:13] way back we we drove three hours
[50:16] in a vehicle through this jeep trail and
[50:18] we got to the top of this mountain
[50:21] in the middle of east africa
[50:24] no lights no electricity no anything and
[50:29] and we got in there and it was nice
[50:31] there's no microphones
[50:33] like like there aren't here and
[50:36] wasn't needed yeah and when i got up to
[50:38] speak
[50:40] the strangest thing happened
[50:42] about 20 iphones or phones went up to
[50:45] video
[50:47] that's a strange thing so i i was
[50:51] thinking about the the ephesian church
[50:53] and it was a church probably about this
[50:55] size and the prophet told us that it was
[50:57] the most advanced church in the entire
[50:59] bible right
[51:00] so
[51:01] they uh
[51:03] they didn't have a lot of people but it
[51:05] was a special church of god amen and uh
[51:08] maybe if the lord is willing that he
[51:11] will give us that advancement
[51:13] here this morning yes sir amen i wanted
[51:16] to talk a little bit
[51:19] about
[51:20] the images that the enemy sets before
[51:23] excuse me
[51:25] and how common these images are to us
[51:28] amen uh as as
[51:30] brother bennett knows i worked for voice
[51:32] of god recordings for a long time
[51:34] and my job there
[51:37] was one of my jobs was when someone
[51:38] would call the office or something would
[51:40] come in
[51:42] or someone would write in and they would
[51:44] want to talk to a minister they would
[51:45] usually get me
[51:47] and
[51:48] handled many different questions many
[51:50] many different situations
[51:52] and one time i got a phone call from a
[51:55] catholic priest
[51:57] and
[51:58] he had some questions about brother
[52:00] brown's ministry
[52:02] and he was asking about uh
[52:04] how he was with the tongues and the
[52:06] different gifts in the church
[52:09] and then
[52:10] after a while he said i want to share a
[52:12] testimony with you he said he says i was
[52:15] the priest of a large parish i believe
[52:18] it was in either philadelphia or new
[52:19] york
[52:21] and he said i got a hold of brother
[52:23] branham's message
[52:25] and he said i started listening to it
[52:28] and he said this really lined up with
[52:31] the bible
[52:33] and that message started coming out in
[52:36] his ministry
[52:39] and one day
[52:40] he's preaching
[52:43] and a lady stands up in church
[52:47] and speaks in tongues
[52:50] this is a catholic church we have mary
[52:52] and you know we have peter over here and
[52:54] all the gold and all the strangeness
[52:57] associated with that and here a lady
[52:59] stands up and starts speaking in tongues
[53:03] she finishes and she gives the
[53:05] interpretation and he points at her and
[53:07] he says that is according to the book of
[53:10] acts amen
[53:11] and he opens up the word and he starts
[53:13] preaching this
[53:14] in his parish amen amen
[53:17] well
[53:18] there were many in there that i'm sure
[53:21] says that this doesn't line up with the
[53:24] way that we have been taught right this
[53:26] doesn't line up with the way i was born
[53:28] i was born into this church so what this
[53:31] priest is saying and what this lady and
[53:33] the gifts that are starting to manifest
[53:35] themselves they don't line up with the
[53:37] way that i believe yeah
[53:39] right so i'm sure that there was some
[53:41] tattling going on to maybe the
[53:43] higher-ups yeah right well
[53:47] they kicked him out
[53:49] the
[53:50] powers that were
[53:51] kicked him out and he told me he said
[53:54] brother he said
[53:55] he said i loved being a priest
[53:59] he said i love the people he said they
[54:02] were my life
[54:03] he said he says and now they kick me out
[54:06] and i don't have anything because
[54:08] because
[54:09] my message didn't match their narrative
[54:13] right
[54:14] and
[54:15] and today that's what i want to talk
[54:16] about is we have to be careful yes of
[54:19] that we do
[54:21] there was a couple weeks ago i was in
[54:23] flagstaff and
[54:24] i had some meetings for work up there
[54:27] and
[54:28] i walked in
[54:30] to the the place where you eat breakfast
[54:32] in the morning hotel
[54:34] and there was a little mexican lady
[54:35] there
[54:36] and i started talking to her struck up a
[54:38] conversation
[54:40] and
[54:41] she uh
[54:43] i asked her i said i said are you a
[54:45] christian
[54:46] and she was adamant she says no she's
[54:49] i'm catholic
[54:51] and i didn't understand the answer and i
[54:53] said uh i said well now sister i said
[54:56] but are you a christian
[54:59] and she was adamant she said no
[55:02] i am not i'm a catholic
[55:05] she wanted to be separate
[55:07] she wanted that separation and i said i
[55:10] said well do you believe in jesus she
[55:11] says yeah i said well what makes you
[55:13] different why are you not a christian
[55:14] she says well we worship mary oh no
[55:17] and
[55:18] i thought this is really
[55:20] odd
[55:22] so i sat down and uh one of the people i
[55:24] work with he's a uh he's a reformed
[55:27] lutheran
[55:28] which that's what i think luther came to
[55:30] do is reform and he said
[55:32] and i asked him i said well you're a
[55:33] former lutheran why why reformed and he
[55:36] says well he said the lutheran church
[55:38] has got away from what luther taught
[55:41] and they've gone into more formalism and
[55:44] this and we want to get back to what
[55:46] luther taught which is more of the
[55:48] charismatic more of the healing more of
[55:50] the that type of thing i thought that's
[55:52] that's good you know let's get back to
[55:54] what the messenger said
[55:56] messenger taught it yeah
[55:58] so so we were talking and we have to be
[56:00] careful as we're talking even in public
[56:03] we have to be careful because somebody's
[56:04] always listening
[56:06] and as we were talking there was another
[56:08] lady that was another mexican lady that
[56:10] was working at the hotel
[56:13] and she witnessed my conversation with
[56:15] the catholic lady
[56:17] and then she witnessed my conversation
[56:19] with my colleague
[56:21] and she comes up to the table
[56:25] and she says
[56:27] she says
[56:28] i feel that you're a pastor she says she
[56:31] says
[56:32] i
[56:33] i want to talk to you
[56:35] and i said okay sister let's talk and we
[56:37] talked for a little bit
[56:39] and she
[56:41] she said
[56:43] my church i go to i like my church i
[56:45] like my pastor but he doesn't just stay
[56:48] with the bible
[56:50] he starts he teaches kind of what the
[56:53] church teaches
[56:54] and there's a baptist church
[56:56] he says she says i just want a church
[56:59] that teaches the bible amen amen
[57:02] yes and i said well sister i'm not a
[57:04] pastor but i said i have a friend that
[57:06] is here in flagstaff and i sent her to
[57:08] brother steve robinson's church
[57:10] and
[57:11] and i don't haven't followed up
[57:13] with him i
[57:14] set up the initial contact i don't know
[57:18] where it's gone yet but uh
[57:21] she saw
[57:23] that her church
[57:25] had an image of christianity but it
[57:27] wasn't entirely right there was
[57:28] something a little bit off
[57:30] with her church and she wanted just that
[57:32] pureness yeah amen and and so often we
[57:36] get in our mind what religion is right
[57:39] right and it's not real
[57:41] it's just what we've been taught that
[57:42] we've been born with amen
[57:45] there was i was my mom
[57:47] um we mentioned cancer you mentioned
[57:50] cancer my mom was dying of cancer a few
[57:52] years ago and my family all of us from
[57:56] the hospital have a close family i'm
[57:58] really proud of my family my both my two
[58:00] brothers they work at voice of god
[58:01] recordings and and my sister's husband
[58:03] works there
[58:05] too so so we're all and we were all
[58:07] together and we were in the hospital
[58:10] and mom was there suffering and it
[58:12] really brought us together
[58:15] and one of my siblings made this
[58:17] statement
[58:19] said
[58:20] that
[58:21] if brother branham was here
[58:24] he would come in
[58:26] and all of these sick people would be
[58:27] healed
[58:29] and they'd all they'd all leave the
[58:30] hospital well
[58:32] and it wasn't a time for correction
[58:35] right and sometimes wisdom is is in
[58:38] silence amen so it wasn't that time
[58:42] but i thought no no no that's that's an
[58:45] image that we have created yes sir right
[58:48] right brother brown amen and it's not
[58:50] real right now my family if you listen
[58:52] to tapes you've heard of the evans
[58:54] family that they
[58:55] as close as any other people were in the
[58:58] world to brother branham and i grew up
[58:59] with all these stories and the greatest
[59:03] thing about brother branham as i as i
[59:05] ministered the other night was his love
[59:09] was was his spirit that he had it wasn't
[59:11] the miracles it wasn't the understanding
[59:13] right it was the love that he had
[59:17] and i think that we need to be careful
[59:19] that satan is the the bible says in
[59:22] first peter it says be sober be vigilant
[59:26] because your adversary the devil as a
[59:28] roaring lion
[59:29] walking about seeing who he may devour
[59:33] yes sir so these are perilous times this
[59:36] is a this is a very dangerous time
[59:39] for us to be here amen
[59:41] and
[59:42] one thing that i think the devil has
[59:44] done
[59:46] is
[59:47] he has
[59:49] give us
[59:50] given us complacency
[59:52] sure and right it's not necessarily the
[59:56] the drug addict or drunk or the
[59:58] homosexual or the adulterer
[1:00:00] or these these people that are that are
[1:00:04] in danger of being devoured by the devil
[1:00:07] they know
[1:00:09] their destination they won't be
[1:00:10] surprised on that day amen right but
[1:00:12] maybe
[1:00:14] it's us in this room that have to be
[1:00:17] careful
[1:00:18] be very careful that we are not just
[1:00:22] complacent very true because
[1:00:24] we have a church to go to
[1:00:26] or or we go to a certain church or we
[1:00:29] believe a certain prophet yeah or we
[1:00:31] have a certain family or our husband is
[1:00:34] this or our wife is that
[1:00:36] friends we can't be complacent
[1:00:39] it's very dangerous because
[1:00:41] the enemy has set up images before us
[1:00:44] and it's very easy to fall
[1:00:46] for these images like amen and my my
[1:00:51] sincere concern
[1:00:54] is what if the enemy
[1:00:57] and i think it would be his greatest
[1:00:59] achievement
[1:01:00] has made people think
[1:01:03] that they have the holy spirit that's
[1:01:04] right and they really don't yes sir true
[1:01:08] he's such a good deceiver he's far far
[1:01:10] more powerful and greater than we are
[1:01:12] but what if he can make us think that we
[1:01:15] are saved or we have the holy spirit and
[1:01:18] we are really not
[1:01:20] right and i think every one of us should
[1:01:23] check up and should be careful
[1:01:25] of this yes amen jesus said he said
[1:01:29] straight is the gate
[1:01:31] and narrow is the way right and and he
[1:01:34] said this too he said few
[1:01:36] that will be defined it's it's a scary
[1:01:39] time and he's talking about us he's
[1:01:42] warning us
[1:01:43] be careful
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] so
[1:01:47] these are
[1:01:48] truly
[1:01:49] perilous times and
[1:01:51] and
[1:01:52] it's it's an extremely deceptive spirit
[1:01:56] and i want to talk about one place where
[1:01:59] this spirit started one of these spirits
[1:02:02] and that's in babylon
[1:02:04] and there's this guy named nimrod
[1:02:06] in the old testament in the book of
[1:02:09] genesis
[1:02:10] and he built this tower and he was
[1:02:13] really proud of it
[1:02:15] and
[1:02:16] it was this tower of battle and there we
[1:02:18] have the very foundation of babylon
[1:02:21] and
[1:02:22] we see we see babylon
[1:02:24] what it did is it put up images before
[1:02:26] the people it was an idolatrous country
[1:02:28] it brought up images before the people
[1:02:30] and
[1:02:31] these images weren't real and and we see
[1:02:34] them today we see them let's say in
[1:02:36] hollywood
[1:02:38] and
[1:02:39] young people you know you're always
[1:02:40] seeing hollywood and they're putting
[1:02:42] these images before you they're even
[1:02:44] called influencers sure am i right right
[1:02:47] yes are they called influencers like on
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:50] facetime the snap face
[1:02:54] am i right they're called influencers
[1:02:56] and they do they influence us
[1:03:00] and and that's what that's what they're
[1:03:01] there for but they're not real you don't
[1:03:03] see these people's lives behind the
[1:03:05] scenes
[1:03:06] they look like these beautiful people
[1:03:08] but their lives are different
[1:03:10] and they're not what what we want to be
[1:03:12] but hollywood places them in front of us
[1:03:15] like babylon did yes there there's this
[1:03:18] place
[1:03:19] in los angeles where
[1:03:21] where you walk down the street and
[1:03:22] there's these stars right in the
[1:03:25] sidewalk yeah
[1:03:26] and these stars are moved they're
[1:03:28] they're memorials to movie stars
[1:03:31] and uh mostly you know what the place is
[1:03:33] called
[1:03:34] it's called babylon court
[1:03:37] why
[1:03:38] what what what a strange coincidence
[1:03:41] appropriate right there i was on i was
[1:03:43] on uh
[1:03:45] google maps
[1:03:46] and uh google maps is the coolest thing
[1:03:50] you know you you can look on it and and
[1:03:52] you grab that little guy and you drop it
[1:03:55] you know he wiggles his hand and he
[1:03:56] lands and all of a sudden you can look
[1:03:57] all around and you can see the street
[1:03:59] and all that and i think that's how we
[1:04:01] should do with the bible
[1:04:04] is we can take ourselves
[1:04:07] and we can open this bible
[1:04:09] and we can drop ourselves in this bible
[1:04:12] amen and then we can look around yes
[1:04:15] it's no good this word is no good to us
[1:04:18] if we can't place ourselves within this
[1:04:19] world amen amen
[1:04:21] so
[1:04:22] let's uh
[1:04:24] let's place ourselves within this word
[1:04:26] today amen and within babylon
[1:04:30] and uh let's turn to daniel chapter two
[1:04:34] because there is a religious application
[1:04:36] it's not just hollywood
[1:04:38] we're talking about babylon amen
[1:04:45] now let me lay a foundation here
[1:04:47] we set the stage what happens is daniel
[1:04:49] was was taken from his home when he was
[1:04:51] when he was a young man and there's all
[1:04:53] these these
[1:04:55] hebrews and they're living in this great
[1:04:58] country called babel
[1:05:00] and they're
[1:05:03] the king
[1:05:05] his name is nebuchadnezzar the king has
[1:05:07] a bad dream
[1:05:08] he has a spiritual dream
[1:05:11] and this dream he knew had significance
[1:05:15] so he calls his all of his
[1:05:18] ministers together and he says listen i
[1:05:20] had this dream
[1:05:22] and i want you to tell me what it means
[1:05:24] but here's the catch
[1:05:26] i'm not going to tell you what my dream
[1:05:28] is right
[1:05:30] he said you're going to tell me the
[1:05:32] dream and then i'll believe what you say
[1:05:34] all right and if you can't
[1:05:38] i'm going to cut you into pieces yeah
[1:05:41] and you're all going to die
[1:05:43] yeah and they're like oh we can't do
[1:05:45] this
[1:05:46] this is
[1:05:47] this is impossible only only they say
[1:05:49] only a god can do this
[1:05:52] so the king's like this is what i say
[1:05:55] you're all going to die
[1:05:57] so they are wiggling like a worm and a
[1:05:59] limit right now and
[1:06:01] and they're going around and they're
[1:06:02] talking and the word comes down
[1:06:05] to this prophet named daniel
[1:06:10] and then daniel does this
[1:06:13] in verse 17
[1:06:15] now we we say we pray for each other
[1:06:19] all right daniel the prophet goes to his
[1:06:22] friends
[1:06:25] shadrach meshach and abednego they're
[1:06:27] that's their babylonian names their
[1:06:29] hebrew names are in
[1:06:31] verse 17.
[1:06:33] and he asks his friends
[1:06:36] he said hey will you pray
[1:06:38] because this is really a bad situation
[1:06:42] so like we did our prayer request
[1:06:44] earlier
[1:06:45] daniel ask for prayer and they pray
[1:06:48] amen amen and then
[1:06:50] the lord gives
[1:06:52] the interpretation gives the dream and
[1:06:54] the interpretation to the prophet damn
[1:06:57] so
[1:06:59] then daniel
[1:07:01] in verses 19 through 23 he thanks god
[1:07:04] for what happened
[1:07:07] and then
[1:07:08] he gets before nebuchadnezzar and i want
[1:07:10] to read verse 26.
[1:07:15] he says this
[1:07:20] the king answered and said to daniel
[1:07:22] whose name was belter
[1:07:24] art thou able to make known unto me the
[1:07:27] dream which i have seen and the
[1:07:29] interpretation thereof now daniel gives
[1:07:31] a very good answer
[1:07:32] and he gives a very prophetic answer
[1:07:35] and this is a very important answer the
[1:07:37] king says
[1:07:38] can you
[1:07:40] daniel interpret this dream
[1:07:43] daniel says
[1:07:47] daniel says all of the soothsayers and
[1:07:49] all of everybody nobody can interpret it
[1:07:52] but then he says this and this is how we
[1:07:55] see a true prophet of god he says
[1:07:58] but god came amen
[1:08:01] yes sir so then
[1:08:03] daniel interprets this dream
[1:08:07] to nebuchadnezzar mm-hmm
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:12] he
[1:08:13] in this dream is so powerful that this
[1:08:15] dream
[1:08:17] it's the next 600 years
[1:08:20] of time yeah
[1:08:22] and and it tells about uh alexander the
[1:08:24] great and the different ones that are
[1:08:25] coming in and it it it lays out what's
[1:08:28] going to happen to nebuchadnezzar's to
[1:08:31] his kingdom and all down through so it's
[1:08:34] very very important
[1:08:38] so nebuchadnezzar
[1:08:40] is taken back
[1:08:43] this man told him
[1:08:45] what he dreamed he said you were laying
[1:08:48] on your bed told him told him how he
[1:08:50] dreamed it yeah and brother he may have
[1:08:52] said his address yes
[1:08:54] he may have said what was ailing him
[1:08:56] like we know from what we know he may
[1:08:59] have he may have said these things we
[1:09:00] see we saw that repeated amen
[1:09:03] you're
[1:09:04] 2600 years years since that time in our
[1:09:07] time amen this man of god yes
[1:09:11] so very very important now
[1:09:15] we have a stage now i want to show you
[1:09:17] what's happened
[1:09:18] here the very next
[1:09:21] verse
[1:09:23] in daniel chapter 3
[1:09:26] verse 1.
[1:09:28] let's see the results
[1:09:31] and how what nebuchadnezzar does
[1:09:34] nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[1:09:38] gold whose height was three square
[1:09:40] cubits and the breadth thereof was six
[1:09:41] cubits and set it in the plain of dura
[1:09:44] in the province of
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:49] we know the statue this image that
[1:09:53] nebuchadnezzar
[1:09:54] directed
[1:09:55] was the image of daniel right
[1:09:58] yes and this is what he had in his mind
[1:10:00] of what daniel was he's this perfect
[1:10:03] statue he's this perfect thing of gold
[1:10:06] and he's this high and everything that
[1:10:08] was in nebuchadnezzar's mind he put it
[1:10:10] into this statue amen and he says this
[1:10:14] is this holy man but the problem is that
[1:10:17] statue was not real amen that statue was
[1:10:20] not daniel
[1:10:22] and what we do is we do the same thing
[1:10:24] yes
[1:10:25] we have this great image of whatever it
[1:10:28] might be of a church of a prophet or
[1:10:30] these things and
[1:10:31] we create this image and that image is
[1:10:33] not real amen
[1:10:35] and it happens so often and it becomes
[1:10:37] deceptive yes right and what it does is
[1:10:40] it draws a circle of separation right
[1:10:45] and it separates like that catholic lady
[1:10:47] i'm not like you
[1:10:49] i'm better than you i'm more special
[1:10:51] than you i'm different yes because of
[1:10:54] this part of my religion
[1:10:56] and that's what nebuchadnezzar did
[1:10:58] nebuchadnezzar drew this circle and said
[1:11:00] if you don't worship him then you're out
[1:11:03] yeah you know you're dead that's what
[1:11:05] happened yeah you kids know what you
[1:11:07] want to know gracie do you know what
[1:11:08] happened to the people that didn't
[1:11:09] worship that statue it's a famous story
[1:11:12] they got thrown in the fiery furnace
[1:11:14] amen yeah and we know shadrach meshach
[1:11:17] and abednego we know that story you know
[1:11:19] that story makes me yeah it's one of my
[1:11:21] favorites
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:24] so so
[1:11:26] nebuchadnezzar separates them and what
[1:11:28] do we do today
[1:11:31] if
[1:11:32] you don't meet my circle
[1:11:35] as nebuchadnezzar did not only
[1:11:38] we don't we don't cast you out in a
[1:11:39] fiery furnace we do worse worse we cast
[1:11:42] you out
[1:11:44] of christianity you're not even
[1:11:45] christian we say you're not bright
[1:11:47] that's way worse than nebuchadnezzar
[1:11:49] could have done amen you're different
[1:11:51] than me
[1:11:52] so you are out yeah
[1:11:55] and that's what nebuchadnezzar did yeah
[1:11:58] and that
[1:11:59] spirit comes all the way down now
[1:12:03] 600 years
[1:12:06] to jesus's time
[1:12:08] and we have
[1:12:10] these people called the pharisees and
[1:12:13] the sadducees
[1:12:15] and the pharisees they were the they
[1:12:17] were the priests to the common people
[1:12:19] they were the ones the pastors of the
[1:12:21] churches they were in there they were in
[1:12:23] with the people
[1:12:24] they were kind of the ones that that
[1:12:26] jesus had a little bit of pull with that
[1:12:28] paul had a little bit of pull with yeah
[1:12:30] and then we have the sadducees you've
[1:12:31] heard of the high priest catholicism
[1:12:33] those were the sadducees they were the
[1:12:36] top notch yeah they were better than
[1:12:39] everybody
[1:12:41] and and they hated each other
[1:12:44] and then you have the essenes over here
[1:12:46] and the essenes are like you're all too
[1:12:47] worldly for us
[1:12:49] and then they go out and they live in
[1:12:51] this community in the desert
[1:12:53] and they preserve the word though that's
[1:12:55] where the dead sea scrolls come from
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] these essenes and they they preserve the
[1:12:59] word but they were better than all of
[1:13:01] you all so you have the pharisees here
[1:13:03] the sadducees here the essenes here and
[1:13:05] they all believed the prophet moses yeah
[1:13:10] yet they separated themselves right on
[1:13:12] doctrinal differences on images that
[1:13:16] they would lift up before the people and
[1:13:18] they separated us amen
[1:13:20] and jesus came and they were so locked
[1:13:23] into
[1:13:24] their understanding and their ideas
[1:13:27] these images of what a good hebrew
[1:13:29] should be of what moses taught and
[1:13:32] washing dishes and and not eating
[1:13:35] catfish or or
[1:13:38] bacon or whatever it might be
[1:13:40] and and they had they had all these
[1:13:42] things and everything was so important
[1:13:45] and i'm not saying this because i'm
[1:13:47] worried about the pharisees agencies
[1:13:51] and i hope that we can see some of the
[1:13:53] things that we've done yeah amen and
[1:13:55] they had all the people separated
[1:13:57] because
[1:13:59] this washes dishes this way this one
[1:14:01] does this this one believes in the seven
[1:14:03] thunders this one believes in the tapes
[1:14:06] only
[1:14:07] from this come this over here the five
[1:14:10] full ministry this over here is the
[1:14:12] return ministry
[1:14:15] did i get everybody
[1:14:20] but
[1:14:22] it's
[1:14:23] and that's what we've done right and
[1:14:25] that's what we do and what we do is we
[1:14:27] draw these circles
[1:14:29] and we cut each other out and by doing
[1:14:31] so we cut out the one that stands at the
[1:14:33] door in the eyes amen and that's the
[1:14:36] lord jesus amen
[1:14:39] an example of this
[1:14:41] is
[1:14:42] in matthew i want to i want to read this
[1:14:44] because this is a good example
[1:14:47] of
[1:14:47] matthew chapter 21 verse 25.
[1:14:51] this is a good example
[1:14:57] of
[1:14:58] the spirit
[1:14:59] in verse 21
[1:15:01] i'm sorry matthew chapter 21 verse 25
[1:15:05] the pharisees
[1:15:08] they're they're there with jesus and
[1:15:09] they're challenging and they ask jesus a
[1:15:11] question
[1:15:13] and jesus says okay
[1:15:15] he says
[1:15:16] i'll answer your question if you answer
[1:15:19] my question
[1:15:20] and he says this jesus says them the
[1:15:22] baptism of john
[1:15:25] was it from heaven
[1:15:26] or was it from men
[1:15:29] so look how they answer it should
[1:15:32] it should
[1:15:34] riley up a little bit
[1:15:37] it should it should be like
[1:15:39] you hypocrites listen to this
[1:15:41] verse um so they say this they say and
[1:15:43] they reason within themselves saying if
[1:15:46] we shall say from heaven then he will
[1:15:48] say to us well why did you not believe
[1:15:50] him and if we still say of men then we
[1:15:52] we fear the people for all hold john as
[1:15:54] the prophet and they answer jesus and
[1:15:56] say we can't we can't tell you
[1:16:00] friends what a horrible answer what a
[1:16:02] bunch of cowards amen
[1:16:05] why didn't they really pray about it and
[1:16:08] answer him in the right way but they
[1:16:09] were so worried about their images that
[1:16:11] they had among themselves that that they
[1:16:14] couldn't even answer that question amen
[1:16:17] their images were more important than
[1:16:18] their their religion right
[1:16:21] and that's what we need to be careful
[1:16:23] amen of doing
[1:16:26] jesus christ
[1:16:28] said
[1:16:29] he said there's a very very important
[1:16:31] thing that he said
[1:16:32] he said i
[1:16:34] am the way yes
[1:16:36] the truth and the life amen amen no one
[1:16:39] comes to the father except by
[1:16:42] me yes
[1:16:44] that means not through our images that
[1:16:46] means not through our churches that
[1:16:48] means not through our families not
[1:16:50] through our our groups right but it
[1:16:53] comes through christ and we have to be
[1:16:56] careful in cutting each other out amen
[1:17:00] because what it does is it promotes
[1:17:02] discord it provides fighting exactly and
[1:17:05] there is no unity there and that's
[1:17:08] satan's goal yes you see it in hollywood
[1:17:11] you see it in politics you know up there
[1:17:13] democrats and republicans right brother
[1:17:15] was telling me the other day he went he
[1:17:16] went on on a tour of a cave
[1:17:19] and he had
[1:17:20] three or four people that had
[1:17:23] two masks on
[1:17:25] like double masks yeah and it said
[1:17:27] something on the mask um i forgot what
[1:17:29] it was but very very liberal group
[1:17:32] and then you had this this group over
[1:17:33] here
[1:17:34] that
[1:17:36] had no mass and had shirts on saying
[1:17:39] trump 2024.
[1:17:41] going down in a cave together
[1:17:45] and he said it's really awkward because
[1:17:46] they're
[1:17:47] in the middle of them and they didn't
[1:17:49] speak you know
[1:17:50] and it's it's the same with us so you
[1:17:52] see that spirit of separation and
[1:17:54] division it's the same thing that
[1:17:55] happens with us right yeah we have one
[1:17:58] little thing that's important to us
[1:18:00] and we are willing as nebuchadnezzar did
[1:18:03] to separate out ourselves yes and cut
[1:18:07] everyone else and we have to get
[1:18:09] everyone out we have to be careful we
[1:18:11] start drawing these circles yes and we
[1:18:14] we draw them smaller yeah and smaller
[1:18:18] and smaller and pretty soon we're the
[1:18:20] only ones standing in the circle yeah
[1:18:23] right right we cut our family out
[1:18:25] you know we
[1:18:27] we look and i'm going to talk about the
[1:18:28] book of acts here in just a minute
[1:18:31] being in one mind and one accord
[1:18:34] and we look at a husband and a wife
[1:18:37] and if that husband and a wife if they
[1:18:39] have one purpose
[1:18:41] in life
[1:18:43] whether it be for their children it
[1:18:44] could be it could be almost any purpose
[1:18:46] but if they're together on one purpose
[1:18:49] then they'll be okay
[1:18:51] but if they're not if they have an image
[1:18:54] in their minds of this is how my husband
[1:18:56] should act or this is how my wife should
[1:18:58] act
[1:18:59] and they create this image in their
[1:19:01] minds and they're they're caught up in
[1:19:02] and how each other should act and many
[1:19:04] times that marriage fails right
[1:19:06] sure now um jeremy and i were up uh
[1:19:09] hiking
[1:19:11] um you know around christmas time
[1:19:13] and uh we were up in the tucson
[1:19:15] mountains we were hiking and we were
[1:19:16] kind of
[1:19:18] we were kind of talking about our wives
[1:19:20] and kind of and thanking the lord for
[1:19:22] the good wives that we have and we were
[1:19:24] talking to each other about
[1:19:26] about how good they are and and both
[1:19:28] jeremy and i were kind of kind of in our
[1:19:30] heart we want to be better husbands
[1:19:33] you know and
[1:19:34] and
[1:19:36] it's one of us
[1:19:38] was saying it's like
[1:19:39] you know sometimes if we get in a tiff
[1:19:42] with our with our spouse
[1:19:45] with a man so many times you want to say
[1:19:48] listen in first corinthians chapter 11
[1:19:50] it says that the that christ is the head
[1:19:53] of the man the man is the head of the
[1:19:54] woman so you got to listen to me and you
[1:19:56] got to do this yeah
[1:19:58] i'm not going to
[1:19:59] ask anybody raise their hand
[1:20:02] but
[1:20:02] i think jeremy said is that doesn't do
[1:20:05] any good right yeah it doesn't because
[1:20:07] what you're doing
[1:20:09] is you're taking this word and you're
[1:20:11] hitting that person over the head right
[1:20:13] right and that's not what this word is
[1:20:14] for right
[1:20:15] now
[1:20:16] it's not but if we have one purpose
[1:20:20] as a husband and a wife
[1:20:22] now we'll get somewhere
[1:20:24] amen so we have jesus
[1:20:28] the pharisees and the sadducees the ones
[1:20:30] that should have accepted him they
[1:20:32] turned him down
[1:20:33] so he has this little group of people
[1:20:35] now
[1:20:37] and he starts telling them
[1:20:39] here's what's coming
[1:20:41] and he
[1:20:42] he gives them instructions on what to do
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:48] in the in the end of all four gospels
[1:20:51] he gives them instructions on on how to
[1:20:53] handle things and on what to do
[1:20:56] and
[1:20:57] then we see
[1:20:59] in the book of acts
[1:21:01] we see that all of these disciples there
[1:21:03] was 120 of them
[1:21:04] in one room and they all were moving in
[1:21:08] the same direction amen like a husband
[1:21:10] and a wife with one common purpose with
[1:21:14] love between each other
[1:21:16] and if we can get in that place friends
[1:21:19] all of us can
[1:21:21] if this church could
[1:21:23] with the small group of people here
[1:21:25] if this church
[1:21:27] could get really with one mind and one
[1:21:30] accord you can change the world amen
[1:21:32] that's right they did
[1:21:34] yeah 120 of them
[1:21:36] they changed the world amen
[1:21:39] so they were in one mind the bible says
[1:21:41] here in acts chapter 2
[1:21:44] it says
[1:21:46] they're in one mind
[1:21:49] i'm sorry
[1:21:50] they were in one quality
[1:21:54] we know that that's also
[1:21:56] with one mind right
[1:21:58] amen and
[1:22:00] they had one purpose and that purpose
[1:22:04] was to
[1:22:06] spread the gospel what is the gospel
[1:22:08] that the messiah has come amen jesus
[1:22:11] came
[1:22:12] so they did that they were in the first
[1:22:14] time they go out they go out preaching
[1:22:16] the gospel you have you have peter over
[1:22:18] here 3 000 people peter preaches one
[1:22:21] service 3 000 people get baptized you
[1:22:23] have all of them going out
[1:22:25] doing different things you have philip
[1:22:27] over here and he's having this great
[1:22:29] revival and all of a sudden he goes on
[1:22:30] to the desert and talks to this eunuch
[1:22:32] and leads him to the lord you have you
[1:22:34] have james and james is the pastor of
[1:22:36] the church you know you have him there
[1:22:38] in jerusalem he's holding down the fort
[1:22:40] in jerusalem all with one mind and one
[1:22:42] accord they're going out they're doing
[1:22:44] great things yes miracles are happening
[1:22:47] in acts chapter four they're all
[1:22:49] together they all come together the the
[1:22:52] disciples give a report here's what's
[1:22:54] been happening and we even got
[1:22:55] persecuted we even got beat and
[1:22:57] everybody's rejoicing
[1:22:59] they it's strange that you know they got
[1:23:00] beaten and then they're happy you know
[1:23:02] they got beat but they got to suffer for
[1:23:04] the lord amen and so much so
[1:23:08] that as they were rejoicing
[1:23:10] the bible says they were they were of
[1:23:13] one heart
[1:23:14] and one soul yes how beautiful is that
[1:23:18] that they were together amen
[1:23:21] the holy spirit comes into the room
[1:23:24] this wasn't the day of pentecost a
[1:23:26] little while earlier this is a different
[1:23:28] time the holy spirit comes into the room
[1:23:30] and it was so powerful that the walls of
[1:23:33] the building amen
[1:23:35] from the power
[1:23:36] of the holy spirit
[1:23:37] friends that's what we need amen
[1:23:40] but we have to have one purpose
[1:23:42] and one purpose isn't
[1:23:44] to follow these images they're gonna set
[1:23:46] before us so often that one purpose is
[1:23:49] to lift up jesus christ the lord yes
[1:23:52] that's what that little lady now that
[1:23:55] lady and um
[1:23:56] and flagstaff that's what she wanted
[1:23:58] she saw that she wanted that that jesus
[1:24:03] christ he didn't want a church you know
[1:24:05] she wanted a church but she didn't want
[1:24:07] that to be her salvation yeah she wanted
[1:24:10] that
[1:24:12] relationship amen with christ
[1:24:16] and
[1:24:20] they had it in the book of acts yes
[1:24:23] and it was beautiful
[1:24:25] and they were going out and they were
[1:24:27] doing great things there's another time
[1:24:28] that 5 000 people came to the lord after
[1:24:30] that
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:32] great things were happening
[1:24:35] and friends
[1:24:38] something
[1:24:39] started to creep in
[1:24:42] and we see little signs sure
[1:24:44] of what creeped in remember we're gonna
[1:24:46] drop ourselves into the scriptures
[1:24:50] things started to
[1:24:52] happen and then there's things that were
[1:24:53] a little bit off
[1:24:55] returning your bible was first
[1:24:56] corinthians chapter one
[1:24:59] and we see
[1:25:04] that things started there there was
[1:25:07] there was something that was going amiss
[1:25:08] here
[1:25:10] this wasn't that great time in the lord
[1:25:13] and paul sees this
[1:25:16] he sees these problems and he's saying
[1:25:18] no no no no no no no no no no don't go
[1:25:21] there
[1:25:22] then you put down these images don't do
[1:25:24] that and we see in verse 9.
[1:25:28] first corinthians chapter 1 verse 9.
[1:25:31] let me read it to you
[1:25:34] paul says this and he's writing a letter
[1:25:36] to this group
[1:25:38] this church in corinth and he says this
[1:25:40] he says god is faithful
[1:25:43] by whom you were called in the
[1:25:44] fellowship
[1:25:45] of his son
[1:25:47] by whom you are called unto the
[1:25:48] fellowship of his son jesus christ our
[1:25:50] lord amen
[1:25:52] now i beseech you brethren
[1:25:54] by the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:25:57] that you all speak the same thing yes
[1:26:00] and that there be
[1:26:01] no divisions among you
[1:26:05] that's
[1:26:06] right that's support
[1:26:09] hey man i'll see something coming in
[1:26:13] yes and he's he's he said wait wait wait
[1:26:15] wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:26:17] go back go back
[1:26:20] and he says this
[1:26:22] that there'll be no divisions among you
[1:26:24] but that you be perfectly joined
[1:26:26] together in the same mind and in the
[1:26:28] same judgment amen
[1:26:30] for it hath been declared unto me of my
[1:26:33] brethren
[1:26:35] by the immature the house of chloe
[1:26:37] that there are contentions
[1:26:39] among you yep
[1:26:42] now this say i
[1:26:44] that every one of you
[1:26:48] say
[1:26:49] that's a lot yeah
[1:26:51] every one of you
[1:26:53] is saying this
[1:26:55] now paul is
[1:26:56] laying down some correction here don't
[1:26:58] do this every one of you is saying this
[1:27:00] right
[1:27:02] i am a paul
[1:27:04] and i am of apollos and i have cephas
[1:27:08] and i have christ
[1:27:10] paul puts himself right in there
[1:27:12] the brother branham of his age says
[1:27:15] you're saying that you're a brother
[1:27:17] brown right
[1:27:19] don't do that right amen don't do that
[1:27:22] amen paul's saying it right here this is
[1:27:24] the bible this isn't me or my opinion
[1:27:26] right this is what paul is saying he
[1:27:28] says he says here now this every one of
[1:27:30] you says i am a paul and i have apollos
[1:27:33] and i have cephas and i have christ and
[1:27:36] he says this is christ divided
[1:27:40] was paul baptized was paul crucified for
[1:27:43] you or were you baptized in the name
[1:27:46] of paul right man and look what this
[1:27:48] messenger is doing he's like no no no no
[1:27:51] get back to christ get back to christ
[1:27:52] you're starting to separate you're
[1:27:54] starting to divide don't do that get
[1:27:56] back
[1:27:58] right yes sir but friends the good news
[1:28:02] and i pray that all of us
[1:28:04] can think about what i'm saying right
[1:28:05] now
[1:28:06] the good news
[1:28:08] it wasn't paul's job
[1:28:12] to turn the hearts
[1:28:15] of these people
[1:28:17] to turn the hearts of the children
[1:28:20] back to that right of the pentecostal
[1:28:22] fathers amen he wanted it so bad but it
[1:28:25] was not his job right right
[1:28:28] that job
[1:28:30] came 2000 years later right
[1:28:33] when a man came to earth he said come
[1:28:35] out of these denominations come out of
[1:28:38] this get away from these images your
[1:28:41] church isn't going to save you your
[1:28:43] pastor's not going to save you these
[1:28:44] things aren't going to save you
[1:28:46] only christ is going to save you amen
[1:28:49] and then and then and then he says
[1:28:52] get back to that that was his job it was
[1:28:55] not paul's job amen paul wanted it
[1:28:59] but
[1:29:00] it wasn't for him amen yeah right and
[1:29:04] then friends
[1:29:05] so now
[1:29:06] here
[1:29:07] brother bennett around the world
[1:29:10] we need to get back
[1:29:13] to this original yes day of pentecost
[1:29:16] amen to when the holy spirit came down
[1:29:20] to where jesus christ himself
[1:29:24] in spirit form
[1:29:26] came down at the day of pentecost
[1:29:30] brother branham said he ripped himself
[1:29:33] he tore himself into pieces amen and
[1:29:36] placed them on each one yes amen that's
[1:29:41] what we have to get back to
[1:29:44] is that that was his commission we make
[1:29:47] him something different
[1:29:49] that he didn't want to be and then we
[1:29:51] start drawing our lines of separation
[1:29:53] when he said don't do that
[1:29:56] his commission in revelation chapter 18
[1:29:58] was come out of that amen don't do it
[1:30:02] and yet the human nature
[1:30:04] we go back and do it all right
[1:30:07] and friends amen we need
[1:30:10] to stop amen and i'm not talking about
[1:30:13] as as i'm speaking i'm sure that we can
[1:30:15] all point our fingers at other people
[1:30:18] that's not what i that's not what i'm
[1:30:20] here for right it's the person sitting
[1:30:22] in your chair
[1:30:24] standing in my shoes that's right that
[1:30:26] is what it has to be yes and it can
[1:30:29] start and it needs to start and it's
[1:30:32] love understanding differences you know
[1:30:34] unif
[1:30:35] unity is not uniformity
[1:30:37] we're all different look at the day of
[1:30:38] pentecost they were all different
[1:30:40] very very different people and they had
[1:30:42] a little bit of this but it was okay
[1:30:44] because they were all had one purpose
[1:30:46] yes and that's what we need to get back
[1:30:49] to
[1:30:50] and i'll close
[1:30:52] with a quote
[1:30:53] that i had another quote that i wanted
[1:30:55] to read but
[1:30:57] i'm
[1:30:59] not texting
[1:31:04] but uh
[1:31:05] i wanted to read this quote i had
[1:31:07] another quote that the one that i read
[1:31:08] at the ministers meeting but but i think
[1:31:11] this one's better i read this at service
[1:31:14] the other night
[1:31:15] and it's just beautiful brother branham
[1:31:17] says this in the church age book
[1:31:20] in fact he closes the church age book he
[1:31:23] was so proud of that book he came to my
[1:31:25] grandpa
[1:31:26] and and when he had finished that book
[1:31:29] he was so proud
[1:31:31] of the exposition of the seven churches
[1:31:34] he came to my grandpa and gave him one
[1:31:35] of the books he was just he was really
[1:31:37] excited about it and he thought that he
[1:31:40] was going to really make a difference
[1:31:42] and then the lord took brother branham
[1:31:44] off the scene right at that right around
[1:31:46] that time
[1:31:47] and he closes his book that he was so
[1:31:50] proud of he closes his book with this
[1:31:53] statement
[1:31:56] he says not for one moment
[1:31:58] do i bring a message to the people that
[1:32:00] they may follow me amen
[1:32:03] or join my church
[1:32:07] or start some fellowship and
[1:32:09] organization
[1:32:11] i have never done that and will not do
[1:32:14] that now amen
[1:32:16] i have no interest in those things
[1:32:20] but i do have an interest in the things
[1:32:22] of god and a people
[1:32:24] and if i can accomplish
[1:32:26] just one thing i will be satisfied now
[1:32:30] this is a very very important person
[1:32:33] that's saying sure we believe
[1:32:37] had pate had a very important job amen
[1:32:40] that was prophesied in the bible
[1:32:44] and he says this if i can just do one
[1:32:46] thing
[1:32:47] melissa this is what he wanted to do
[1:32:49] this one thing
[1:32:51] and it's so important to me
[1:32:54] that his ministry is accomplished in my
[1:32:56] life yes it's my greatest goal that not
[1:33:00] for brother branham but it's it's my
[1:33:01] greatest goal that i can see what his
[1:33:04] his greatest want is i can see it
[1:33:07] accomplished in my life and my wife and
[1:33:09] my family
[1:33:10] he says this
[1:33:12] if i can accomplish this one thing i
[1:33:13] will be satisfied
[1:33:15] that one thing is to see established a
[1:33:18] true spiritual relationship
[1:33:21] between god and men amen amen
[1:33:24] we're in men
[1:33:25] and he's not talking just about men he's
[1:33:27] talking about all of us humanity
[1:33:29] humanity right
[1:33:31] between god and men wherein men become
[1:33:35] new creations in christ
[1:33:38] filled with his spirit amen
[1:33:42] and live according to his word amen amen
[1:33:46] yes
[1:33:47] i would invite and plead and warn
[1:33:52] all to hear his voice yes this time yes
[1:33:58] amen and yield your lives completely to
[1:34:03] him amen
[1:34:05] even as i trust in my heart that i have
[1:34:08] given my all right yes to him praise the
[1:34:12] lord god bless you
[1:34:14] and may his coming rejoice your heart
[1:34:17] amen and friends
[1:34:19] this is not a man
[1:34:21] that wanted an image made of him you're
[1:34:24] right this is not a man that wanted to
[1:34:27] be lifted up in front of the people like
[1:34:29] daniel was amen that's not that was not
[1:34:32] his goal
[1:34:33] he wanted us to have that relationship
[1:34:36] with christ and friends i can say today
[1:34:41] my family started following brother
[1:34:43] branham
[1:34:44] in the early 50s
[1:34:46] they drove around the country following
[1:34:48] him just wanting to hear this man preach
[1:34:50] because he was different yeah
[1:34:52] my that was the evans family my other
[1:34:54] side of my family was a deacon in
[1:34:56] brother branham's church by the wheeler
[1:34:59] he was a deacon for brother brandon my
[1:35:01] aunt jacqueline who was in church the
[1:35:03] other night at the tabernacle she played
[1:35:05] the piano for brother brown yeah right
[1:35:07] so i i see all of this and in the
[1:35:10] heritage that i have i see
[1:35:13] what it is and it's i've seen it get
[1:35:15] wrapped around
[1:35:17] brother branham and lifted up an image
[1:35:19] yeah
[1:35:20] that wasn't that's not real amen not
[1:35:22] real
[1:35:24] but there was a real daniel yes
[1:35:27] and it wasn't that statue and there was
[1:35:28] a real william brown amen and it's not
[1:35:31] so much what we what we make of him but
[1:35:34] i say this in the name of the lord jesus
[1:35:37] his ministry
[1:35:39] was a success
[1:35:40] in my life amen because he introduced me
[1:35:44] to the lord jesus christ
[1:35:47] and i pray that you all have that same
[1:35:49] testimony yes sir today amen and you can
[1:35:52] talk directly to jesus amen you don't
[1:35:55] have to go through a mediator you don't
[1:35:56] have to go through mary you don't have
[1:35:57] to go through these different ones that
[1:35:59] you can talk directly to him
[1:36:02] in this quote that was his greatest goal
[1:36:05] yes
[1:36:08] let's uh
[1:36:10] before
[1:36:12] before i take my seat i uh i would like
[1:36:15] to pray for everyone
[1:36:17] and um
[1:36:18] friends i pray that that what i've said
[1:36:20] afraid that i encourage you
[1:36:22] that um
[1:36:25] you'll hear that voice as brother ram
[1:36:27] said and that you will have
[1:36:29] that relationship and let's let's bow
[1:36:31] our heads
[1:36:34] think about
[1:36:36] jesus and how we want that relationship
[1:36:40] lord jesus we lift you up before the
[1:36:42] people
[1:36:44] father may everywhere we go everything
[1:36:46] that we say everything that we do
[1:36:48] lord every person in this building here
[1:36:51] now as they go out into the world may
[1:36:53] the world look at that person and see
[1:36:55] jesus christ walking in flesh
[1:36:58] as they did at the day of pentecost lord
[1:37:00] so we pray that it would be now
[1:37:03] thank you
[1:37:04] father as brother branham's commission
[1:37:06] was to turn our hearts back to that day
[1:37:09] lord let it be a success i pray
[1:37:13] and father let it be a success not only
[1:37:15] here but around you the world i pray
[1:37:18] and may lord we be a testimony that
[1:37:21] jesus christ is real yes and he's alive
[1:37:24] yes jesus i love you i pray to you in
[1:37:27] the name above all names the name of the
[1:37:29] lord jesus
[1:37:30] amen amen
[1:37:32] my friends god
[1:37:39] thank you brother god bless you
[1:37:41] amen you enjoyed that yeah
[1:37:44] appreciate what brother daniel had to
[1:37:45] say
[1:37:46] very prominent for today the day that we
[1:37:48] live you know
[1:37:50] i've been on the rapture message for
[1:37:52] about two and a half months and i
[1:37:53] thought that's pretty uh
[1:37:58] i guess appropriate for the time frame
[1:37:59] but that message today was just
[1:38:01] absolutely outstanding for
[1:38:03] the day that we live friend and a lot of
[1:38:05] what goes on around us and the things
[1:38:07] that happen out in the world and i love
[1:38:09] the way he
[1:38:10] brought it down from
[1:38:12] a carnal aspect into a spiritual aspect
[1:38:15] to understand it's not just hollywood
[1:38:16] has put these images or you know or
[1:38:19] government or uh or or other religions
[1:38:23] that have their buddhas and their their
[1:38:25] their statues that they worship and that
[1:38:27] they talk to and they pray to but that
[1:38:30] it is so prominent to understand that
[1:38:32] the device is the enemy and what satan
[1:38:35] is doing today
[1:38:37] even amongst people that we know and
[1:38:39] that we rub elbows with and and they
[1:38:41] call themselves christians and message
[1:38:43] believers
[1:38:45] it's become a mantra i'm a message
[1:38:47] believer yeah but are you a christian
[1:38:49] he talked to a catholic lady that said
[1:38:51] i'm not a christian i'm a catholic but
[1:38:54] when we talk to one another or something
[1:38:56] we say well i'm a message believer yeah
[1:38:58] but are you a christian
[1:39:00] to me friend there's a difference yes
[1:39:02] the bible says that not all is israel is
[1:39:05] of israel and i think there is a there's
[1:39:08] a place today that not all that says
[1:39:09] there's bride is bride and the point of
[1:39:12] the of it is that people make themselves
[1:39:14] images that they that they want to
[1:39:16] follow uh because
[1:39:18] it's it's probably the easiest religion
[1:39:21] you can have
[1:39:22] neglectinism is
[1:39:24] is is overcoming the world again because
[1:39:26] it's very easy
[1:39:28] you know you just bow to this image and
[1:39:30] you do your pitches and you go home and
[1:39:31] live however you want to
[1:39:33] there's no there's no responsibility to
[1:39:35] pray there's no responsibility to reach
[1:39:37] bibles you know little responsibility
[1:39:39] coming church come when you can just
[1:39:40] make sure you drop the money in the box
[1:39:42] where everything's okay
[1:39:44] and that's just an image friend how many
[1:39:46] times we talked about that religion is
[1:39:48] nothing but a covering
[1:39:49] that's all it is people just want to get
[1:39:51] under that covering they want to get in
[1:39:53] the shadow of that image and think
[1:39:55] they're okay it doesn't work that way
[1:39:57] amen you've got to know jesus christ and
[1:40:00] him crucified the power of his
[1:40:02] resurrection to be your lord and savior
[1:40:05] and for him to fill you with his holy
[1:40:07] spirit if you ever expect to leave this
[1:40:09] place in a rapture
[1:40:10] amen amen amen and that that's the
[1:40:14] beginning and ending of it amen praise
[1:40:16] the lord and you can't have an image of
[1:40:18] christ
[1:40:19] people have in their minds that's how
[1:40:20] they missed him to begin with right
[1:40:23] they were blinded not because god
[1:40:25] purposely came and blinded their eyes
[1:40:28] but they were blinded because they had
[1:40:30] this image in their mind of when the
[1:40:31] messiah come he was going to be like
[1:40:33] this right and he came so differently
[1:40:36] than they had imaged in their mind that
[1:40:38] when he came they couldn't see him they
[1:40:40] were blinded to who he was by their own
[1:40:43] image
[1:40:44] and they couldn't see christ
[1:40:46] and people do the same thing today right
[1:40:50] that image that people have in their
[1:40:51] minds what's supposed to be like this
[1:40:53] how many times have i told you so many
[1:40:55] times people pray for things and they
[1:40:57] ask god for things and they and and they
[1:41:00] and all of a sudden you have in your
[1:41:02] mind this is going to be the way god
[1:41:04] does it that's right you know when god
[1:41:05] does something completely opposite you
[1:41:07] totally miss it because he didn't do it
[1:41:09] the way you thought he was going to do
[1:41:10] it well that's just an image right you
[1:41:13] built an image in your mind of how you
[1:41:15] thought it was going to be and god's
[1:41:16] like no no i'm going to do it like this
[1:41:19] and he does it like this and we
[1:41:20] completely miss it
[1:41:22] it would completely obscures everything
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:25] just
[1:41:26] if we can just approach jesus with the
[1:41:28] open mind open heart and look to him and
[1:41:30] expect him to speak to us and answer
[1:41:32] what we're looking for the way he wants
[1:41:35] to do it according to his word now it's
[1:41:37] never going to be against his word we
[1:41:38] know that right but according to his
[1:41:40] word and he'll do it amen and he does it
[1:41:42] he does it every time amen amen
[1:41:45] sometimes he brings healing by passing
[1:41:48] by people passing on
[1:41:50] but we don't expect they say lord heal
[1:41:52] them well he heals them because he took
[1:41:54] them home and they're perfect now
[1:41:56] yeah well that's not what i was wanting
[1:41:58] well you know i had a brother one time
[1:42:01] i don't mean to be preaching but there's
[1:42:03] an anointing here
[1:42:05] back east and
[1:42:06] he had this carnal thing in his heart he
[1:42:08] wanted a mercedes and he always wanted
[1:42:11] this mercedes he prayed god on of us he
[1:42:13] actually prayed
[1:42:14] for our savior i don't know that i could
[1:42:16] be that
[1:42:17] forth with gold
[1:42:19] god gave me a mercedes but he did he is
[1:42:22] his testimony he prayed for a mercedes
[1:42:24] and he was a musician and he went into
[1:42:27] the store one time and they went over
[1:42:29] and he found this trump he looked at it
[1:42:31] he picked it up and he played it and it
[1:42:32] sounded perfect he loved it he said i'm
[1:42:34] going to buy this he turned around and
[1:42:35] looked at it and he said mercedes
[1:42:37] [Laughter]
[1:42:40] what exactly what he was thinking about
[1:42:43] i doubt very seriously he put the key in
[1:42:45] and drove that home
[1:42:47] but he was able to play it for the lord
[1:42:50] god answered his prayer
[1:42:52] in a way that he could use that for the
[1:42:54] lord amen but he had his
[1:42:57] he had this image in his mind this is
[1:42:58] where it's going to be let me get rid of
[1:43:00] those things amen those are hindering
[1:43:03] spirits we get rid of those things you
[1:43:05] know brother brother green said many
[1:43:07] times brother branham came and this is
[1:43:08] brother green's testimony so i don't
[1:43:09] take he said brother graham told him
[1:43:11] you'll find when you come to tucson
[1:43:13] you'll find nine different
[1:43:14] interpretations of my message
[1:43:17] amen right
[1:43:20] you know he said i did i get them all i
[1:43:22] i don't know i'm not really that
[1:43:24] concerned about those but i understand
[1:43:26] why i did i've done that myself you know
[1:43:28] and things that you think are sort of on
[1:43:31] the outskirts of sure what we believe or
[1:43:34] the fundal
[1:43:35] fundamental foundation of the message
[1:43:37] the scriptures and and that's that's all
[1:43:39] i care about friend you know
[1:43:42] there's
[1:43:44] if you hate anyone or have any bitter
[1:43:46] spirits you're in danger of hell fire
[1:43:48] and that's if we just hold to that word
[1:43:50] and hold to christ and and yeah the
[1:43:52] message is in the word amen the message
[1:43:55] is in the word i believe that
[1:43:57] brother brown said but you know
[1:44:00] as long as i'm the pastor of this church
[1:44:02] brother branham's picture will not be
[1:44:03] right there
[1:44:04] it'll be jesus christ amen amen because
[1:44:07] he's my lord and savior
[1:44:09] uh there's nobody has a higher respect
[1:44:12] and regard for the prophet of god to
[1:44:14] come and this message that leads us and
[1:44:16] brings us to a truth
[1:44:17] it it just reminds me a couple weeks ago
[1:44:20] because i've been on the rapture and um
[1:44:23] we were talking about people saying that
[1:44:24] the uh out in the world and i've heard
[1:44:27] some people in the message oh this don't
[1:44:28] get the vaccination it's it it's the
[1:44:31] mark of the
[1:44:32] beast and brother dennis brought a very
[1:44:35] good point you know without this message
[1:44:37] people could believe that
[1:44:39] people would actually believe that that
[1:44:41] that vaccine is the walking face brother
[1:44:43] branham tells us plain we know very real
[1:44:46] what the mark of the beast is amen and
[1:44:48] it's not a vaccination uh but anyway uh
[1:44:52] and people have their own opinions about
[1:44:54] that but you see in that how the devil
[1:44:56] is dividing
[1:44:58] i told you this my church over a year
[1:45:00] ago that satan was going to use that as
[1:45:02] a dividing point and he sure has tried
[1:45:03] to do it yes but i'm
[1:45:05] just just it's not going to happen in
[1:45:07] this church amen but you know you got
[1:45:09] the the covet non-covenant and you got
[1:45:12] the people that are so strong on one
[1:45:13] side of the other and then all of a
[1:45:14] sudden you had the mask and the no mask
[1:45:16] people and now all of a sudden you've
[1:45:18] got the vaccinated and the
[1:45:19] non-vaccinated people
[1:45:21] and and they can't give enough levity to
[1:45:23] one another to think that maybe i'm not
[1:45:25] supposed to have it or you're supposed
[1:45:27] to have it and that we can still be
[1:45:29] brothers and love one another
[1:45:31] regardless
[1:45:33] and that's
[1:45:34] what i heard that's the whole point that
[1:45:35] our brother was trying to make
[1:45:38] um i
[1:45:39] i don't believe that we're cookie cutter
[1:45:41] christians we didn't roll off of some
[1:45:43] assembly line and god just stamped us
[1:45:45] out as we came down on this earth and
[1:45:47] said there's new there's daniel there's
[1:45:49] and then bam bam and we all go no we're
[1:45:51] all different
[1:45:53] we serve different purposes we have
[1:45:54] different gifts we have different places
[1:45:56] god puts us and everything that goes in
[1:45:59] line with that and and all that comes
[1:46:01] down the fact that god may lead me in a
[1:46:03] way he's not going to lead you right he
[1:46:05] may cause me to do something that you're
[1:46:06] not going to do he may cause you to do
[1:46:08] something and i may not understand it
[1:46:10] but it's not going to be outside the
[1:46:11] word right
[1:46:12] it's not going to be sinful but i may
[1:46:14] not understand it ways okay
[1:46:17] but give the brother give the sister
[1:46:19] give humanity
[1:46:21] enough levity to understand that we are
[1:46:23] all led of the lord jesus
[1:46:25] and that's what i've told you here
[1:46:26] friend just do what you feel led to do
[1:46:28] let god lead you right right your man
[1:46:30] said god didn't send man to lead a man
[1:46:32] he sent the holy ghost to leave right
[1:46:34] now the holy ghost is supposed to be our
[1:46:36] portion the holy ghost is supposed to
[1:46:38] lead us and guide us and bring us into
[1:46:40] all truth yes amen not brother brandon
[1:46:42] brother branham wasn't seen here to
[1:46:44] bring us into all truth god almighty was
[1:46:46] sent here he used a gift and a man to do
[1:46:49] it but god was sent here
[1:46:51] i know brother dan worked at the voice
[1:46:53] of god and i don't mean this in a
[1:46:55] derogatory manner and and and i don't
[1:46:57] mean to be contrary about it but i've
[1:46:59] disagreed i've told you many times i've
[1:47:01] disagreed with with the fact that the
[1:47:03] the the seal book says the revelation of
[1:47:05] the seven seals
[1:47:07] because see brother branham can't give
[1:47:09] anybody a revelation
[1:47:11] brother branham wasn't seen here to give
[1:47:12] you a revelation only god can give you a
[1:47:15] revelation now i believe the book
[1:47:17] contains the truth of the seven seals
[1:47:20] right and you can read that and god can
[1:47:22] give you a revelation of it but brother
[1:47:24] branham wasn't sitting here to give
[1:47:26] anybody a revelation he was just sitting
[1:47:28] here to preach the gospel and let that
[1:47:31] word move into your life and permeate
[1:47:33] into your spirit so that you can become
[1:47:35] the word yeah let that word become you
[1:47:38] yes amen i believe that's what he was
[1:47:41] yeah he was just that example he just
[1:47:43] happened to be the wave chief it was
[1:47:45] just that example for us
[1:47:47] but can't we do that in understanding
[1:47:49] that my brother can too
[1:47:52] and that my sister can too
[1:47:54] and and then they might be a little
[1:47:56] different in it
[1:47:57] amen but we're all the same
[1:47:59] we're all headed to that
[1:48:01] one goal that one purpose that one
[1:48:04] reason
[1:48:05] and that's that reason that i believe
[1:48:07] their brother was talking about today
[1:48:08] that every one of us i believe here
[1:48:10] today and i believe around the world in
[1:48:12] this city and uh in this state around
[1:48:14] the world are are gained for that
[1:48:17] purpose
[1:48:18] i mentioned the prayer requests for
[1:48:21] those uh in afghanistan because
[1:48:25] you know sometimes you see some images
[1:48:27] and you see things that are going on and
[1:48:28] they're very disturbing because those
[1:48:30] are human beings those are they might
[1:48:32] not be my children they might not be my
[1:48:34] family they might not be in my home my
[1:48:36] four no more but they are human beings
[1:48:38] with a soul worth 10 million worlds
[1:48:41] and it disturbs me to see when people
[1:48:42] are treated that way and then when you
[1:48:44] hear reports of christians fearful for
[1:48:47] their lives now god's going to take care
[1:48:49] of his own right we understand that yes
[1:48:51] but we but but he calls us in
[1:48:53] responsibility to pray for those people
[1:48:57] it's like it's like jesus said ask seek
[1:49:01] and you'll find
[1:49:04] now
[1:49:04] he asked us to ask but don't you think
[1:49:06] he already knows what what we want right
[1:49:09] he already knows what's in our heart but
[1:49:10] he still asks us to ask god's going
[1:49:12] gonna take care of his children but he
[1:49:14] still asked us in petition for them so
[1:49:17] that's what was on my heart those uh
[1:49:19] those christians over there and i
[1:49:20] believe there's that i believe there's
[1:49:22] uh as we call them bride over there
[1:49:25] message people i do believe there are so
[1:49:27] they're going to be coming from every
[1:49:28] tongue kindred nation people from all
[1:49:31] around the world
[1:49:33] and i believe there's some there so if
[1:49:34] there are i believe the lord will take
[1:49:36] care of him amen i was blessed today
[1:49:39] about what what our brother brought
[1:49:41] absolutely and i think it's paramount to
[1:49:43] what we're
[1:49:44] uh looking for the lord today because
[1:49:48] it's those images we got to shed out of
[1:49:50] our lives
[1:49:51] and look to christ and and what was one
[1:49:53] of the last things in that quote that he
[1:49:55] read and his coming
[1:49:57] amen his coming amen i'm looking forward
[1:50:00] to that with great expectation friend
[1:50:03] anticipation there's so many going
[1:50:05] beyond the curtain of time now so many
[1:50:07] loved ones many friends people i know
[1:50:09] uh from all over the country and uh
[1:50:12] they're passing on at a young age at an
[1:50:14] older age but uh i'm looking forward for
[1:50:17] that great reunion time yeah amen i got
[1:50:19] a son over there i got a dad i got a mom
[1:50:22] i got a brother i got a sister and
[1:50:24] relatives i got i got a lot waiting on

[1:50:29] are you yes but
[1:50:31] never lose your enthusiasm for the

[1:50:45] it but if that minister's meeting served

[1:53:12] he is so wonderful
[1:53:19] because he first
[1:53:22] love me
[1:53:26] hallelujah amen god richard bless you
[1:53:29] today
[1:53:30] you know i
[1:53:32] i met many many men people in my life
[1:53:35] that knew brother brown personally spent
[1:53:37] time with him
[1:53:39] and
[1:53:40] i
[1:53:41] and i fellowship with them with all
[1:53:43] different doctrines and the way they
[1:53:45] believed and i've talked to brothers
[1:53:48] that don't talk to each other
[1:53:50] and at odds and many of them have passed
[1:53:52] now but at odds with one another
[1:53:54] differing opinions or doctrines and
[1:53:57] and i talked to all of them and they all
[1:53:59] believed this message and believed
[1:54:01] brother branham to be a prophet
[1:54:03] but the one thing that i found in common
[1:54:05] in all of them
[1:54:06] besides the love that he mentioned was
[1:54:08] the humility that brother branham had in
[1:54:11] mind that's right
[1:54:12] every one of them without fail told me
[1:54:15] he was the most humble person they had
[1:54:16] ever met
[1:54:18] that speaks volumes
[1:54:20] especially with the gift given to an
[1:54:23] individual like that to take that and
[1:54:25] make yours and see how you can how much
[1:54:28] humbler you can make yourself
[1:54:30] with what god has given you amen and i
[1:54:33] and i said that because i want to say
[1:54:35] this i see that humility in my brother
[1:54:38] here
[1:54:39] i see that humility of brother dan i
[1:54:41] didn't meet brother branham i was alive
[1:54:43] 10 days on this earth with brother brown
[1:54:45] i was born on december 15th and past
[1:54:47] december 24th
[1:54:50] and but but that humility right that
[1:54:53] i know i've seen
[1:54:55] i see in our brother and he was very
[1:54:58] contrite even at the minister's meeting
[1:55:01] and
[1:55:02] that spoke volumes to me really does
[1:55:05] especially when you see so much kingdom
[1:55:08] building and it's me and my church in
[1:55:10] this
[1:55:11] uh
[1:55:13] i've always told people you know
[1:55:16] if god wants somebody to come here he'll
[1:55:18] send them here
[1:55:20] and that's that's my belief
[1:55:22] amen i don't have to advertise
[1:55:24] the guy that rented us a place said you
[1:55:26] could put a sign out there and somebody
[1:55:29] another brother said well we can
[1:55:30] increase your footprint on social media
[1:55:36] i'm not here to build a kingdom if god
[1:55:38] wants them here he'll send them here
[1:55:41] and i believe that that may be naive i
[1:55:43] don't know but that's the way i believe
[1:55:45] it right yes and so
[1:55:47] it is what it is so amen so i appreciate
