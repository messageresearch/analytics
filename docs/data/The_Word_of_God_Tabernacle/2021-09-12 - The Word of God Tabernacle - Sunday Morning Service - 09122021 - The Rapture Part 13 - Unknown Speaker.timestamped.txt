[0:13] attitude in tune
[0:15] whatever
[0:16] that's all that matters amen
[0:18] praise the lord we want it to be
[0:20] glorifying and magnifying to him
[0:23] amen
[0:25] i have a couple things i wanted to
[0:27] mention to you but instead of leaving
[0:29] you standing for that
[0:31] we'll just read the scripture and then
[0:33] we'll let you be seated
[0:35] i have a couple testimonies i want to
[0:37] give to you
[0:39] report and all and
[0:40] uh i just got to the place there you
[0:43] know several of us missing today
[0:45] uh that aren't here with us for various
[0:47] reasons and we miss them all when you're
[0:49] not here if you're streaming we love you
[0:51] god bless you but
[0:53] we miss you when you're not here but uh
[0:55] um
[0:57] but it's just just the power surging
[0:59] through this place with those
[1:00] testimonies and sometimes it just takes
[1:02] a little personal touch like that to
[1:04] make a difference but um i thought we
[1:07] just turned it into a testimony meeting
[1:09] almost uh just feeling the power of god
[1:12] and the testimonies and the things that
[1:14] the lord is doing for us done for us
[1:16] you know
[1:18] it's not a strange thing for
[1:21] uh
[1:22] in in
[1:23] in reflecting on sister norman's
[1:25] testimony uh to be going down the road
[1:28] and the lord to show you something
[1:29] before it actually happens
[1:32] and then when it happens you're prepared
[1:33] for it because god prepared you
[1:36] man otherwise you could have been like
[1:38] one of those butterflies it's on your
[1:40] windshield uh
[1:42] that's just
[1:44] but that's the world but that's god's
[1:45] protection to us and watching over us
[1:48] amen just like my daughter my grandkids

[2:51] testimonies and the things that you do

[4:39] brother concerning them which are asleep
[4:41] that you sorrow not even as others which

[4:45] jesus died and rose again even so them
[4:47] also which sleep in jesus will god bring
[4:49] with him
[4:50] for this we say unto you by the word of
[4:52] the lord that we which are alive and
[4:53] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[4:55] not prevent them which are asleep
[4:57] the lord himself shall descend from
[4:59] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[5:00] the archangel with the trump of god the
[5:02] dead of christ shall rise first then we
[5:05] which are alive and remain shall be
[5:06] caught up together with them in the
[5:08] clouds to meet the lord in the air so
[5:10] shall we ever be with the lord wherefore
[5:13] comfort one another with these words you
[5:15] can be seated if you like
[5:18] for those of you who remembered uh i
[5:20] appreciate your prayers
[5:22] for us the minister's meeting that we
[5:24] had yesterday uh it was very much a
[5:27] success uh it was still a very good
[5:29] spirit this is the third one we've had
[5:32] here in arizona and it's been a real
[5:33] blessing and i thank the lord for
[5:36] blessing me had several people from the
[5:37] south so kind of made me feel a little
[5:39] more at home
[5:40] a few black brothers that came from
[5:42] south carolina and uh i enjoyed their
[5:45] testimonies and the spirit and the
[5:47] fellowship and um and it the theme of
[5:50] the the theme of it was the
[5:52] the message brother branham priest on
[5:54] the five true characteristics or
[5:56] identifications of the true church of
[5:58] the living god
[5:59] uh that brother brown preached i think
[6:01] it was september 11 11 1960
[6:05] since it was september 11th yesterday
[6:07] that was kind of a theme that was chosen
[6:08] and uh and those characteristics and and
[6:11] it was beautiful to read uh to re-go
[6:14] over those characteristics through the
[6:16] couple of brothers that spoke
[6:18] the format is we get there and we have
[6:20] prayer and brother caleb says something
[6:22] brother steve uh robinson says something
[6:24] who kind of organized it uh a little bit
[6:27] and then we have an elderly minister he
[6:29] has like 45 minutes or so to speak a
[6:31] younger minister 45 minutes and they did
[6:33] a really good job uh but uh one of the
[6:36] focuses on that was
[6:38] the
[6:39] the church of miracles
[6:42] uh the one of the identifications of
[6:44] that true church is is miracles working
[6:46] in that church in that group of people
[6:49] and it reminded me because it was a
[6:51] brother there from south carolina named
[6:52] betty perry uh precious brother loving
[6:55] known him
[6:57] 30 years or more
[6:58] probably longer than that actually and
[7:01] uh and it and and when the brother
[7:03] mentioned that about that characteristic
[7:06] it made me think of a miracle that uh
[7:08] that brother benny had told us when we
[7:11] were at a fellowship meeting one time in
[7:13] north carolina i think we're actually in
[7:14] south carolina at that time
[7:16] at that meeting and he was telling us
[7:19] about and it had just happened so
[7:21] you know when a miracle takes place in
[7:23] something that's just outstanding you
[7:25] know what it does to you and how it
[7:27] affects your spirit and and how it makes
[7:30] you act and react and and then
[7:32] when you see that on the west coast or
[7:34] in arizona you can multiply that times
[7:37] about a hundred in in the south
[7:40] uh for whatever excitement we reach here
[7:42] in arizona you can you can take that
[7:45] excitement and multiply by times 100 in
[7:48] the south those people uh they get
[7:50] excited
[7:51] and his excitement his exuberance was
[7:54] in his face in his voice and he told the
[7:57] testimony of some sisters that was in
[7:59] his church it just happened like i said
[8:01] uh right as those meetings were going on
[8:04] uh there was a car load of them going
[8:06] down the highway uh 50 55 60 miles an
[8:09] hour whatever it was they had a head-on
[8:11] collision
[8:12] now yeah i don't need to tell you a
[8:14] 60-mile an hour head-on collision
[8:16] doesn't usually end up very well
[8:18] uh not a single person in the car was
[8:22] hurt
[8:23] not killed
[8:25] not hurt wow you understand i'm not
[8:28] saying no one was killed no one was hurt
[8:31] wow from this car in a 50 mile an hour
[8:34] head-on collision impact wow police
[8:37] showed up and he started to interview
[8:38] people
[8:39] somebody that was behind them saw the
[8:41] accident happen the police interviewed
[8:43] that person and that person said
[8:46] uh
[8:47] identified the crash and what happened
[8:49] afterwards so the police came to the to
[8:52] the sisters that was in the car and said
[8:54] uh and interviewed them and said okay
[8:56] where's this gentleman
[8:58] and they're like
[8:59] there was snowman
[9:01] they're like no
[9:03] ma'am there
[9:05] there's eyewitnesses that saw the crash
[9:08] happen
[9:09] and they saw a man get out of your car
[9:13] and help all of you out now where is he
[9:16] i want to know what happened to him i
[9:17] need to interview him and they said sir
[9:19] i'm sorry but there was no man in the
[9:22] car with us
[9:23] there was six of us and children where
[9:26] could we have put a man there was no man
[9:29] and they said we have eyewitnesses that
[9:32] they saw at just directly after the
[9:34] wreck a man get out of the car and help
[9:38] every one of you out now where is he
[9:40] gone
[9:41] not to be found
[9:42] now the test the testimony was told here
[9:45] this morning reminded me of that amen of
[9:48] that uh brother dennis and uh that
[9:52] entertaining angels unaware
[9:55] see you just never know saints amen what
[9:58] god's doing in it made me think of that
[9:59] i and other thing i was thinking uh one
[10:02] time some precious friends of ours in
[10:04] north carolina they made a turn to an
[10:06] intersection somebody blew through a red
[10:08] light and right at the point of impact
[10:10] that when they saw what was going to
[10:12] happen they screamed out jesus and the
[10:14] car went right through
[10:16] wow amen went right through them the car
[10:19] went right through them and they turned
[10:20] and kept on going now needless to say
[10:23] you can imagine all they felt after that
[10:27] happened uh but
[10:29] that's just the lord that's that's
[10:31] that's serving god and you say well you
[10:34] know i had a wreck it smashed me up and
[10:36] that didn't happen well it might be one
[10:38] in a million but it still happens yes
[10:41] amen you just trust the lord and that or
[10:43] whatever god does and one time jesus
[10:47] stepped over every single sick body at
[10:50] the pool of bethesda to go to one person
[10:52] and people would sit there and say well
[10:54] why didn't he heal all of them well
[10:56] that's not his predestinated will that's
[10:58] right whatever his predestinated will is
[11:00] that's what we want like what the angel
[11:02] was saying angel third was saying
[11:06] angel was saying he's either going to
[11:08] come home or go home yes praise the lord
[11:10] amen i mean what greater testimony can
[11:12] you have
[11:13] our selfish flesh you know if the lord
[11:15] does choose to take him which we're
[11:17] believing he's not
[11:18] if that's the lord's will then i believe
[11:20] they want it and if that's the lord's
[11:22] will then
[11:25] that's where we all want to go that's
[11:26] what we're all looking for aspiring to
[11:28] so
[11:29] uh that's just just uh that's just what
[11:31] we look to
[11:33] amen and thank god for amen you know i
[11:35] woke up yesterday and
[11:37] as uh
[11:38] probably most of the nation maybe some
[11:40] of you
[11:41] was reflecting on 9 11 20 years ago what
[11:45] happened
[11:46] maybe where you were when you first
[11:47] heard about 9 11 some of you weren't
[11:49] even born but
[11:51] 20 years ago
[11:53] when 9 11 happened
[11:55] i remember exactly where i was i was at
[11:57] the tabernacle we had just started tlc
[11:59] school and we were having a bible class
[12:01] and i was in the chapel upstairs with my
[12:04] bible in my hand when brother richard
[12:05] giberti came in and told us what had
[12:07] happened and didn't register at that at
[12:09] first but when i woke up yesterday i was
[12:12] reflecting on that it came on my heart
[12:14] now i'm going to say this i wanted to
[12:15] mention it to you i mentioned it to the
[12:17] group yesterday i told brother caleb i
[12:19] said i i woke up thinking this way and
[12:21] it came on my heart
[12:24] i said why don't we have
[12:26] a moment of prayer
[12:29] for
[12:30] the ones that have gone on
[12:32] there's there's something going on in
[12:34] the spirit realm saints
[12:36] there's something going on in the spirit
[12:37] realm the world will try to blame it on
[12:39] covet but it's not coveted right there's
[12:41] a lot of people that i know that have
[12:44] passed away that wasn't coveted
[12:46] just in the past couple of weeks just in
[12:48] the past couple of months
[12:51] going on in the spiritual i've never
[12:53] seen it like it is now
[12:56] people that are going on
[12:58] beyond the curtain of time that are
[13:00] passing on now in
[13:02] large numbers it's almost a daily event
[13:05] where you hear somebody that you know
[13:07] personally and may not have been a close
[13:09] friend or a relative but you know or
[13:11] know of that person personally on
[13:13] facebook or through
[13:15] uh people letting you know of the people
[13:18] that have been passing away
[13:20] it's been a lot
[13:22] i've never seen it like that before it
[13:25] used to be where you'd see one here or
[13:26] one there used to be a thing where
[13:28] people would say well they go in threes
[13:30] you ever heard that now they go in
[13:32] threes and two passed away and you're
[13:33] like well i wonder who the third one's
[13:35] going to be
[13:36] that kind of thing but this has been
[13:37] dozens
[13:39] dozens of people that have passed people
[13:41] i know people that
[13:43] and again not all coven
[13:45] maybe half of them may have been
[13:48] because of cobin but
[13:50] not all of them are it's just it's it's
[13:52] like we were talking about that vehicle
[13:54] whatever it is that god chooses if it's
[13:56] our time to go
[13:58] then uh actually if it's our time to go
[14:00] if you're a christian you should want to
[14:02] go
[14:03] i've said this before
[14:05] uh
[14:06] i believe if i have a lot of time here
[14:09] and and god has me and i'm being a
[14:11] purpose and god using me praise the lord
[14:13] but if that when that time ends i don't
[14:15] want to be here any longer than i need
[14:18] to be i just soon go i love my family i
[14:20] love my grandchildren my children i love
[14:22] you i love the church uh but whatever
[14:25] god's done with me
[14:27] it's like brother branham said i read
[14:28] that quote last week i don't want to
[14:30] come to that door as a coward right amen
[14:33] that door is there for a purpose and
[14:35] that door is there to relieve us of this
[14:37] past house
[14:39] amen but but i say that because i
[14:42] believe there's something very
[14:43] significant going on in in the spirit
[14:46] realm
[14:47] uh i don't think it's a coincidence of a
[14:49] lot of things that i see happening
[14:51] naturally amongst the bride and amongst
[14:53] churches and people that i know i don't
[14:55] think it's an accident the lord put this
[14:57] on my heart to bring
[14:59] about the rapture and there's something
[15:02] that there's just uh
[15:04] if we could just break into that channel
[15:07] and
[15:08] and the lord would uh of course we knew
[15:10] everything was god was doing every time
[15:12] he did it there would be no need for
[15:13] faith right but
[15:15] i i just want to let you know i believe
[15:18] in my in my spirit and what i see it
[15:21] there's something significant happening
[15:23] in the world today amen
[15:25] very significant
[15:26] spiritually significant i'm not talking
[15:28] about just
[15:30] at the afghanistan thing and and 9 11
[15:32] just happened the 20-year anniversary
[15:34] i'm talking about the spirit realm
[15:37] just there's very significant things
[15:39] that are happening in the spirit realm
[15:40] right now that we need to be very
[15:43] cognizant of yes pray continue to try to
[15:46] keep yourself before the lord the best
[15:48] you can read your bible pray stay in
[15:50] contact keep that relationship that you
[15:52] got with jesus strong
[15:54] let that relationship be stronger than
[15:56] ever right now i read brother dennis
[15:58] gave that too it's just uh
[16:01] it is so very true friend uh and i and i
[16:04] believe that if you're listening to me
[16:06] and if you listen in the future whatever
[16:08] it is
[16:09] there's just i believe it's that time to
[16:11] buckle and cinch that girder up that
[16:13] much tighter now uh
[16:16] something's going on amen
[16:18] i'm anxious to see what the lord does
[16:20] next amen praise the lord so
[16:24] we're just going to trust him in that so
[16:27] when we when we end the service uh i
[16:29] want us to get together and pray and i
[16:32] want to pray for those who have gone i
[16:34] want us together hold hands if we will
[16:36] maybe pray for brother angel jr and um
[16:39] and and if you're streaming and if you
[16:41] want to do that at home or if you're
[16:43] somebody there or just bind your spirit
[16:45] with us
[16:46] uh however it may work i want to do that
[16:48] we'll do that lord willing afterwards
[16:50] amen so uh i appreciate that and what
[16:53] god is doing for us
[16:55] amen
[16:56] praise the lord i hope i hope all these
[16:58] testimonies and things like that
[17:00] is not lost on us no amen don't let it
[17:03] be lost on us saints
[17:05] it's god
[17:06] god is mindful yes god loves you amen
[17:10] praise the lord
[17:11] there's been there's been people i know
[17:13] that have died tragically there's been
[17:15] saints of god that i've known that died
[17:17] in traffic accidents
[17:19] you go why did they die and god shows
[17:22] sister norma to back up or brother danny
[17:24] to swerve or go through those people i
[17:26] don't know
[17:27] but that's the sovereignty of god that's
[17:29] the trust we have in him that he
[17:31] protects us and keeps us and whatever he
[17:34] sees down the road is his perfect will
[17:36] that's what we want to do now let's uh
[17:38] let's move forward in the rapture part
[17:40] 13.
[17:42] uh we talked quite extensively and we
[17:44] probably could continue to talk more
[17:46] about the the resulting condition and
[17:49] what this world is supposed to be like
[17:52] at the time of rapture
[17:53] jesus was very specific about it we went
[17:56] through two or three uh
[17:58] services of that and no doubt with all
[18:00] the things that's still going on around
[18:02] us and all the signs and all the uh
[18:04] things that we can actually see with our
[18:06] eyes just just natural things that are
[18:08] happening and we can identify them in
[18:10] the scripture
[18:12] uh i felt to to to move on from that
[18:15] part and i want to talk today about uh
[18:18] those that go in the rapture and the
[18:20] scriptural precedent that is given to us
[18:23] of those that go in the rapture now we
[18:26] know and again saints
[18:28] a lot of what i give you know i'm not
[18:30] some
[18:31] deep
[18:33] uh i don't know called revelated maybe
[18:35] uh
[18:36] a scholar or something that i i just try
[18:39] to bring what the lord puts on my heart
[18:40] and maybe it's simple stuff maybe it's
[18:42] something you know
[18:43] but
[18:44] whatever it is
[18:46] the lord has somebody wants to hear it
[18:48] right amen and maybe that's me
[18:51] and if it is that's fine too so bear
[18:53] with me if you will but uh but i want to
[18:56] talk about the fact that
[18:58] the only ones that go in this rapture
[19:01] are the predestinated gentile bride
[19:05] that's the only ones that this rapture
[19:08] is for and there's lots of people on the
[19:11] earth there's a lot there's there's a
[19:14] jew and gentile but this rapture we're
[19:16] talking about is only going to be for
[19:19] the predestinated
[19:21] gentile bride now i say predestinated
[19:25] because so many times our vision gets
[19:28] narrowed
[19:29] and understandably but it gets narrowed
[19:31] to the point that we see what's in front
[19:33] of us and what's going on and what's
[19:35] happening right now so many times it
[19:38] seems like our verbiage
[19:40] makes it toward
[19:41] the raptures only for those that are
[19:43] alive
[19:44] and we and sometimes we displace those
[19:47] people that have gone on before
[19:49] the people that have gone from the very
[19:51] first church age to this church age
[19:53] peter paul john i mean all the uh
[19:57] the reformers down through the ages and
[19:59] all those that gave their lives to the
[20:01] martyrdom and and the dark ages and all
[20:03] they're all a part of that same rapture
[20:06] saint so but the only way to be in it is
[20:09] to be a predestinated seed
[20:12] now we know that in this last day and of
[20:14] course if you
[20:15] die in christ before that rapture the
[20:18] the key to that the the the ticket that
[20:21] you need to have is the token right
[20:23] but there is also the the uh the
[20:27] discussion that people have and
[20:28] sometimes forget
[20:30] that the fact that there are people who
[20:33] die before they get to the age of
[20:35] accountability
[20:36] now what happens to those people
[20:39] what happens to the children if they die
[20:41] before the age of accountability now
[20:43] brother adam says they go and they're
[20:46] going to be in heaven right they will be
[20:48] in heaven we know that because they
[20:50] didn't reach that age now we mourn and
[20:53] grieve and we're very sorrowful at the
[20:55] at the loss of a young child when
[20:57] they're killed or whatever it is but
[21:00] there's one thing you can know that
[21:02] child is going to be in heaven
[21:04] praise the lord i don't care who they
[21:06] are where they came from right the thing
[21:08] of it is now though do they go in the
[21:10] rapture
[21:12] does every one of them they're going to
[21:14] be in heaven brother and so they're
[21:15] going to be in heaven everyone if they
[21:17] before they get the age of
[21:18] accountability to the place that they
[21:19] can receive the holy spirit are they
[21:21] going to be in the rapture as well yes
[21:23] they passed on
[21:25] amen they've gone on uh and they will be
[21:28] in heaven but that but will they be in
[21:30] the rapture
[21:32] or will they be a part of the group that
[21:34] still uh uh is in the grave for the
[21:36] thousand years through the millennium
[21:37] and come up in the second resurrection
[21:40] the
[21:41] so
[21:42] that prompted this word i put in here
[21:46] and that is the
[21:48] predestinated gentile bribe brother
[21:51] madam says
[21:52] because the question was asked him and
[21:54] questions and answers do do children are
[21:57] there going to be children in the
[21:58] rapture or will there be children that
[22:00] go in a rapture people children that die
[22:03] beforehand will they be in the rapture
[22:05] and he says it depends on whether they
[22:07] are
[22:08] predestinated of god or not
[22:11] they will be in heaven
[22:13] amen but that does not mean that they
[22:16] will be in a rapture
[22:18] only the
[22:19] predestinated of god go in a rapture
[22:22] amen only the predestinated of god going
[22:25] to rapture so only the predestinated
[22:27] gentile bride from the first church ace
[22:29] till today are going in this rapture
[22:32] right only the predestinated so even if
[22:34] they die beforehand even if they were
[22:37] children even if they were so young they
[22:39] did weren't able to get the holy spirit
[22:41] they'll only be in the rapture if they
[22:44] are predestined of god
[22:46] amen and that's just the thoughts of god
[22:48] right the predestination of god is just
[22:51] the attribute the thought of god if you
[22:54] are the elected and the predestined in
[22:56] god's mind is a thought of god an
[22:58] attribute of god before the foundation
[23:01] of the world that predestination lies
[23:03] with you if not it does not right that
[23:06] does not mean now that if you weren't
[23:09] predestined or in the thought in god's
[23:11] mind that does not mean you're going to
[23:13] hell
[23:14] you might but it's not a hard and fast
[23:18] see that's where the separation that god
[23:20] has between the sheep and the goats
[23:22] right amen but there's the bride that is
[23:25] his bride
[23:27] but there are those who are granted
[23:29] eternal life amen they're given eternal
[23:31] life and that group will be there yes
[23:34] they'll be outside the city i'm kind of
[23:36] getting ahead of myself but they'll be
[23:38] outside the city the new city as workers
[23:41] they won't be in the new city they won't
[23:42] be inside the walled city they'll be
[23:44] outside but they'll be granted eternal
[23:46] life they'll be given life that's a
[23:49] group of people that are that that maybe
[23:51] were saved but weren't filled with the
[23:52] holy spirit maybe they remained virtuous
[23:55] but they didn't have the holy ghost
[23:57] maybe they reached a place of adulthood
[23:59] and they they died outside of
[24:02] of of the whole of being born again yes
[24:05] but they still might make uh they won't
[24:08] make a rapture but they still might make
[24:10] heaven
[24:11] amen so
[24:12] that being said let's go to matthew
[24:14] chapter 25 now and we'll talk about the
[24:17] ten virgins
[24:26] did you get that mica
[24:28] oh it's been a big steal
[24:32] praise the lord matthew chapter 25.
[24:38] i also like to say we we had a wonderful
[24:41] time last sunday night me and brother
[24:42] john went down to we didn't go together
[24:44] but we ended up there to brother
[24:47] rogers
[24:49] church down in sierra vista
[24:51] and we had a really good time in the
[24:52] lord last sunday sunday sunday afternoon
[24:55] it was a very good spirit
[24:57] we had communion foot washing afterwards
[25:00] i believe the lord really blessed the
[25:02] service
[25:03] the song service was outstanding and the
[25:05] spirit was moving and
[25:07] it was a it was a nice sweet spirit last
[25:09] sunday night so i enjoyed that i really
[25:11] appreciate brother roger inviting us to
[25:13] come down i want to have communion here
[25:15] too
[25:16] uh
[25:18] hopefully in the next couple of weeks
[25:20] uh brother neil
[25:23] no noel johnson's supposed to be here
[25:25] october 3rd
[25:26] sunday and i'm thinking of wanting to
[25:29] try to have it before then
[25:31] so
[25:32] hopefully before october 3rd but i
[25:34] haven't uh i haven't set a date yet it
[25:37] won't be next sunday probably the sunday
[25:39] after actually
[25:41] now i think about it it'll probably be
[25:42] the sunday after next two weeks from
[25:44] today lord willing we'll have communion
[25:47] for watching but we had a really good
[25:48] time with the lord last sunday night god
[25:50] really blessed it so thankful for that
[25:53] matthew chapter 25 now
[25:56] uh how many times this uh
[25:59] parable god
[26:00] jesus gives is used um so many times but
[26:04] as it refers to the end time and and
[26:07] beyond even it's a very good reference
[26:10] of scripture then shall the kingdom of
[26:13] heaven be likened unto ten virgins which
[26:16] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[26:18] the bridegroom now again
[26:20] as we've said before in pat times past
[26:23] we got to recognize and acknowledge all
[26:25] ten of them were virtuous okay all ten
[26:28] of the number of virtues they were
[26:30] undefiled by man by man's ideas
[26:33] doctrines opinions dogmas they were
[26:35] virtuous to the lord amen virtuous to
[26:38] the lord
[26:40] and five of them were wise five were
[26:42] foolish
[26:43] they that were foolish took their lamps
[26:46] and took no oil with them
[26:48] the wise took oil in their vessels with
[26:52] their lamps
[26:53] while the bridegroom carried they all
[26:56] slumbered and slept so we've only got
[26:58] one variance between the wise and the
[27:00] full
[27:01] foolish virgin at this point and that is
[27:03] that the wise had oil in their vessels
[27:07] and the foolish did not right they did
[27:10] not have oil in their vessels they did
[27:12] not take any extra oil
[27:14] but uh
[27:15] but the wise did so that's the only
[27:18] variance at this point
[27:20] and at midnight there was a cry made
[27:22] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[27:24] to meet him i believe an end time
[27:26] message did that for us correct
[27:28] amen as john the baptist was sent to
[27:31] forerun the first coming so will your
[27:32] message four run the second
[27:34] praise the lord amen amen so we know
[27:36] that we know that cry has been made
[27:39] behold the bridegroom coming go ye out
[27:42] to meet him that's i believe that's what
[27:43] we're doing now
[27:45] that's what the bride is doing how is
[27:46] she doing it through the word right amen
[27:49] that's spirit then all those virgins
[27:51] arose and trimmed their lamps so this is
[27:54] still no variance they all rose and they
[27:56] all trimmed their lamps all of them were
[27:58] slumbering and sleeping but all of them
[28:00] rose and they all trimmed their lamps
[28:02] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[28:04] us of your oil for our lamps are gone
[28:06] out so now obviously the wat the foolish
[28:10] virgin had oil
[28:12] but they did they only had it in their
[28:15] lamps they didn't have it in their
[28:17] vessels
[28:18] so when their experience burned out
[28:21] when their anointing went away
[28:24] when they're uh
[28:26] tingling their flesh or their little uh
[28:30] gift of expression speaking in tongues
[28:33] or whatever when that was all gone what
[28:35] did they have
[28:37] the wise still had oil in their vessels
[28:40] the foolish did not because that's all
[28:42] they had they jump they dance they shout
[28:44] they praise the lord they spoke in
[28:46] tongues they did all the things that the
[28:48] wise virgins did but they did not they
[28:51] weren't born again right they did not
[28:53] have oil in their vessels we know oil
[28:55] represents the holy ghost they did not
[28:57] have oil in their vessels they only had
[28:59] it in their lamps what is the lamp a
[29:01] lamp is the outward uh expression of
[29:04] light that comes forth
[29:06] that's what a lamp does a vessel is a
[29:08] storage place for the oil
[29:10] which to me i type that as the soul
[29:13] right the soul of man is that storage
[29:15] place that stores that uh that oil the
[29:19] holy spirit so that it
[29:22] works itself outward so that the lamp
[29:24] that shines forth to the world shines
[29:27] forth of god
[29:28] through your lamp right it's done
[29:30] through the oil well the anointing will
[29:32] do the same thing but it'll only do it
[29:34] for a short period of time right an
[29:36] anointing will come on you an anointing
[29:38] will cause you to to share a gift it'll
[29:40] cause it to be operated it'll cost you
[29:42] to cause you to have some kind of
[29:44] experience tingling in the flesh or
[29:46] weeping and crying coming to an altar
[29:49] and all those things are expressions of
[29:51] an anointing
[29:53] but a life lived is the only expression
[29:57] of oil in your vessel
[30:00] 24 7
[30:02] 365 366 leap year
[30:05] it shows that there is uh that there is
[30:08] oil in the vessel when a life is lived
[30:11] yes
[30:13] that's where the difference comes amen
[30:15] the devil can jump and shout the devil
[30:17] can speak in tongues the devil can
[30:18] manifest any kind of a gift brother
[30:20] brown said he could but he cannot bring
[30:22] that word or live that word word by word
[30:25] can't do it why because that's the oil
[30:28] that's the born-again experience that
[30:30] causes the individual to live a godly
[30:33] christian holy ghost-filled life
[30:36] there's the difference
[30:37] so when their oil went out now the
[30:40] difference now these people there's they
[30:42] were still virtuous
[30:43] okay now there's others that
[30:45] they may experience that anointing and
[30:48] they're not virtuous
[30:49] they've sold themselves out into
[30:51] denominations and they they prostitute
[30:54] themselves to uh uh to doctrines and
[30:57] dogmas of man of this world and and they
[31:01] are in no way virtuous to god right in
[31:03] no way are they but there is a group of
[31:06] people that will remain virtuous and yet
[31:10] still not be born again
[31:12] right
[31:13] remember the spirit would be so close it
[31:15] would deceive the very elect
[31:17] the very
[31:18] predestinated if possible that's the
[31:21] only closeness of spirit that there is
[31:24] you look at the world and you see the
[31:26] catholic church denominations you even
[31:28] see the nominal christian the
[31:30] charismatics and you see them out on the
[31:31] street they look absolutely nothing like
[31:34] a biblical christian right nothing they
[31:37] don't look anything or express
[31:39] themselves in any way like the godly
[31:41] christian does in their dress in their
[31:43] talk in the places they go the things
[31:46] they watch the music they listen to in
[31:48] no way do they express themselves in a
[31:50] way that would make you believe that
[31:52] they have the holy spirit because
[31:54] there's nothing biblical about their
[31:56] lives right if there's nothing biblical
[31:58] about their lives or what they watch or
[32:00] what they listen to their music or how
[32:03] they dress then then you can't believe
[32:06] that that person they only received an
[32:08] anointing of some kind
[32:10] they only received a spirit that came on
[32:13] them
[32:14] and that's all they had
[32:16] but now that person still remains
[32:18] virtuous to god now
[32:21] there's debate are the is this group of
[32:23] people in the message
[32:25] or is this group of people not in the
[32:27] message i've heard debate both sides
[32:30] brother branham said to be people come
[32:32] out of those denominations but look
[32:33] friend that was 60 years ago
[32:36] if there's going to be a coming out
[32:37] there's already been a coming out
[32:40] is there one or two or whatever still
[32:41] may be there i don't know that's up to
[32:43] the lord could be there could be some
[32:45] still in denominations
[32:47] uh but i but i've had people give
[32:50] arguments on both sides
[32:52] i believe it could be both
[32:55] but i
[32:56] i i believe it's very difficult
[33:00] for a person to remain in a denomination
[33:03] and not prostitute themselves to the
[33:06] hybridism of the dogma from that
[33:09] denomination right yes
[33:11] very difficult
[33:13] now a person can be in the message and
[33:16] receive the truth of the message and
[33:18] still not be born again right
[33:21] they live on that experience they sit
[33:24] next to
[33:25] us in pews and uh
[33:27] and in different churches and and
[33:30] special meetings and things maybe even a
[33:32] minister or two i don't know
[33:35] but they
[33:36] don't
[33:38] defile themselves
[33:40] with the dogma of satan and the world
[33:43] and the hybridism of the word they stay
[33:46] pure to the word
[33:47] they just didn't get born again yes
[33:51] see and
[33:52] and there's the difference
[33:55] there's the separating point because the
[33:58] predestinated of god
[34:00] receive that spirit and become born
[34:03] again
[34:04] they have an experience that transcends
[34:07] beyond just an anointing
[34:09] that affects their lives in every day
[34:12] that they live
[34:13] and everything they do and everywhere
[34:15] they go their influences like i said
[34:17] last week
[34:19] is living in a different dimension
[34:22] you look at everything differently
[34:24] because you live in a different place
[34:26] right
[34:27] the ungodly music that you hear out of
[34:29] this world today has no interest to you
[34:32] because you're a different creature yeah
[34:35] it doesn't even appeal to you
[34:38] because you're not that you you don't
[34:40] live in that dimension you don't live to
[34:43] feed off the things of satan in the
[34:45] world right you that that's not your
[34:48] that's not your absolute that's not what
[34:50] you live on
[34:51] when you become born again you become
[34:53] someone that's gone beyond those
[34:56] the things of the world and you have no
[34:58] appetite for that anymore right
[35:01] there's not even a desire there's not
[35:02] even an appetite for it that's why a
[35:05] born-again son or daughter of god cannot
[35:07] sin because there's no longer an
[35:09] appetite you'll make a mistake slip up
[35:12] and do things you shouldn't or say
[35:14] something you shouldn't get a little
[35:15] anger or something whatever it is
[35:17] but you're not thirsty for that you're
[35:19] not right you're you're your spirit your
[35:22] soul is not um
[35:25] dictating to you to to be that kind of
[35:28] person anymore
[35:30] your your spirit your soul
[35:33] the the life that's in you calls you to
[35:36] to be a word body yes
[35:39] to be a godly holy ghost christian
[35:42] that's what it calls you to be
[35:44] the separation between these two the the
[35:47] line seems very fine
[35:50] but the difference in the two
[35:52] is the difference between going in a
[35:54] rapture and being here through the
[35:56] tribulation
[35:57] now again i speak that
[36:00] as an alive and remain group correct
[36:03] because only the alive and remain
[36:05] that fit the foolish virgin category is
[36:07] going to go through the tribulation
[36:09] because the others have already gone on
[36:11] they've passed on already
[36:13] so those will go through the tribulation
[36:15] period they'll have to steal their
[36:17] testimony with their own blood right
[36:21] but they'll be there
[36:22] they won't be in a rapture the rest of
[36:24] the dead live not for a thousand years
[36:26] while the bride is in the millennium the
[36:28] wedding supper in the millennium they
[36:30] won't be there they'll come up in the
[36:32] second resurrection but be granted life
[36:34] right you read on the rest of uh uh of
[36:37] chapter 25 down at the bottom it talks
[36:39] about that he goes into the parable of
[36:41] the talents and then he goes into the
[36:43] parable of the separating in the 21st
[36:46] verse of the separating of the sheeps
[36:47] and the gods
[36:49] amen
[36:50] scofield says that's not the white
[36:52] throne judgment but i beg to differ with
[36:54] him and i believe brother brown did too
[36:56] uh and he talked about this isn't here
[36:58] this isn't present present but
[37:01] there's there's there's never a time
[37:03] where all of humanity comes to one place
[37:06] at one time except the white throne
[37:07] judgment that's the only place a scholar
[37:11] like uh like dr scofield would be and
[37:14] not recognize that
[37:16] everybody according to this scripture is
[37:18] gathered before the throne of god and
[37:22] that's what it says
[37:23] he said as he sits upon the throne of
[37:25] his glory and all of the nations come
[37:28] and gather before him
[37:31] well there's no other place scripturally
[37:33] there's no other place that is to happen
[37:35] but the white throne judgment right so
[37:37] it's so it's got to be so the parable
[37:39] that jesus gives now is then as the
[37:42] bride as christ and the bride are
[37:45] judging the world
[37:48] each one of them comes up one at a time
[37:50] there's a judgment that takes place and
[37:53] there's a separation the sheep from the
[37:55] goats right now the goats at that time
[37:59] that the the the
[38:03] the goat represents the unbeliever
[38:06] if you will that's
[38:08] it's a a metaphor the goat
[38:11] it is just the unbeliever that goes into
[38:13] hell they get cast out into outer
[38:15] darkness but the sheep are granted
[38:18] eternal life right and then of course
[38:20] jesus gives the parable there where he
[38:22] says uh you fed me you clothed me and
[38:25] when you did it to the least of these my
[38:26] little ones no you weren't born again
[38:29] but you were you were good to them you
[38:32] you helped them and you were there for
[38:34] them uh but you you know you you didn't
[38:37] get the holy ghost but i grant you life
[38:40] because you took care of mine
[38:42] amen
[38:44] and so there will be those people that
[38:46] are there
[38:47] now in scripture and of course the
[38:50] type that brother branham gives mostly
[38:53] is
[38:53] uh zenoch
[38:55] and noah
[38:56] a lot of times people talk about noah as
[38:59] the end time or the end time bride but
[39:02] noah did not represent the end time
[39:04] bribe
[39:05] right
[39:07] noah did not represent the predestinated
[39:09] gentile bride of this last day
[39:12] or well let's say last day from these
[39:15] church ages they go on a rapture
[39:18] uh he was a man that typed the
[39:21] uh the
[39:22] uh the foolish virgin yeah enoch was the
[39:26] man that typed the wise virgin so enoch
[39:29] was the wise virgin
[39:30] noah was the foolish virgin because
[39:32] enoch raptured one man before judgment
[39:36] ever struck the earth one man went into
[39:38] rapture
[39:40] was caught away did not taste death
[39:42] there was one man
[39:44] that's right they say eight souls were
[39:46] saved in the flood absolutely but only
[39:48] one man went in the rapture
[39:51] mine does that mean that the type of
[39:53] that and the numbers is going to be the
[39:55] bride and and then the the the the
[39:58] foolish version those that go into the
[40:00] tribulation will be eight times as many
[40:03] i don't know brother brown talk did
[40:04] numerology a lot we don't know
[40:07] uh he preached one in a million i know i
[40:09] know brother brown did that but there
[40:11] was only one winning rapture only one
[40:13] person that whole time went to rapture
[40:15] eight went over the tribulation yes they
[40:18] came on the other side yes they were
[40:20] saved from the judgment of that day but
[40:22] you notice how noah when he come out on
[40:24] the other side became a drunk at
[40:26] relation with his daughter in birth moab
[40:30] which was evil wicked
[40:32] and died to death
[40:34] noah did
[40:35] but enoch raptured yes enoch made it out
[40:38] before any of the judgment ever struck
[40:41] yes that's the type i'm looking for
[40:43] saints that's the place i want to get i
[40:45] know a lot of people say well if i don't
[40:47] go on a rapture then i just hope i'm a
[40:49] foolish virgin my my mind you have no
[40:51] revelation of what a foolish virgin's
[40:53] going to have to deal with when the
[40:54] tribulation gets are you right yes none
[40:57] that's right oh my
[40:59] god i don't want to be if i felt like
[41:00] that that was ever an option in my life
[41:03] i would find an altar somewhere
[41:05] i'd find a place where i could meet god
[41:08] somewhere wherever it was and i'd be on
[41:10] my face till i knew that that that i
[41:12] wasn't a part of that group amen amen oh
[41:15] my what is it going to be like people
[41:18] are scared of death coven can you
[41:20] imagine what they're going to do when
[41:21] the tribulation hits right and they're
[41:23] scared over a little germ
[41:26] why
[41:27] ain't nothing eyes not seen here's not
[41:29] heard what's about to strike this earth
[41:31] and it probably
[41:33] john did the best he could right and
[41:35] what was shown to him
[41:37] but
[41:38] how could you really pin what's going to
[41:40] happen how could you put it in words to
[41:42] where it would be descriptive enough to
[41:44] understand but i want you to see this
[41:47] enoch and noah both of course who were
[41:50] acknowledged uh
[41:53] in genesis but were acknowledged in in
[41:56] uh in hebrews
[41:58] amen and in the new testament of course
[42:01] uh jesus talked about the these days
[42:03] right here being as the days of noah and
[42:06] maybe we might expound on that lord
[42:08] willing uh if if he'll
[42:11] allow us some point but jesus even said
[42:14] as it was in the days of noah right
[42:16] so we know there's a significance to
[42:19] that
[42:20] so let's look see
[42:22] uh
[42:22] enoch and noah in genesis chapter 5
[42:26] verse 24 there's one very
[42:28] genesis 5 24 there's one very
[42:31] distinctive characteristic that both of
[42:34] these men had
[42:36] even though one of them went in the
[42:38] rapture and one of them went through the
[42:40] tribulation there's one very distinctive
[42:44] unique characteristic about both of
[42:46] these men amen just very much like the
[42:50] ten virgins we just read right uh it it
[42:53] it was striking and i've seen this and
[42:55] i've preached on it before but when i
[42:57] was looking at it more
[42:58] this week and yesterday it really struck
[43:00] me as to really how how close this is
[43:03] and how
[43:04] uh
[43:05] similar the types are
[43:07] but now genesis chapter 5 we read it
[43:09] last week with enoch genesis 5 24 and
[43:13] enoch walked with god and he was not for
[43:17] god took him
[43:19] now what is the very most distinctive
[43:21] characteristic about that verse
[43:23] enoch walked with god
[43:26] that's the very most distinctive
[43:28] characteristic about that scripture is
[43:30] that enoch walked with god
[43:32] amen that that is uh that was one of the
[43:35] things we talked about last week
[43:38] before the rapture what was it like
[43:42] what was enoch like before the rapture
[43:44] well he the bible says he walked with
[43:47] god amen hebrews says he had a testimony
[43:51] that he pleased god well how did he
[43:54] please god because he was walking with
[43:56] him right
[43:57] amen he walked with him talked with him
[43:59] was pleasing to him
[44:01] but the the characteristic in genesis he
[44:04] walked with god now once you understand
[44:06] in the andaluvian world there's only two
[44:08] men that this ever
[44:10] describes actually in the scripture that
[44:12] these two men that that it's described
[44:15] exactly this way
[44:17] the other one is genesis chapter 6 verse
[44:20] 8 and 9.
[44:24] genesis 6 8-9 but noah found grace in
[44:27] the eyes of the lord
[44:29] these are the generations of noah
[44:32] noah was a just man and perfect in his
[44:35] generations and noah did what
[44:38] walked with god
[44:41] now obviously there's other
[44:42] characteristics about noah that weren't
[44:44] mentioned about enoch like he was
[44:46] perfect and a just man in his
[44:48] generations but the outstanding thing
[44:51] was
[44:52] noah walked with god just like enoch
[44:55] walked with god amen
[44:58] the five foolish were virgins and the
[45:01] five wise were virgins they all walked
[45:05] with god but one group go in the rapture
[45:09] and the other group did it
[45:12] amen amen
[45:14] when the when the foolish virgin went to
[45:16] go get the oil
[45:18] the bridegroom came and god took them in
[45:21] a rapture and the foolish virgins well
[45:22] what's happened
[45:24] what's going on
[45:25] now look
[45:27] we know it's going to be a secret
[45:29] catching away
[45:31] it's going to be
[45:32] quiet secret the world won't know but if
[45:34] there's any group of people
[45:38] that will know when the rapture takes
[45:40] place it's going to be the foolish
[45:41] virgin
[45:43] because if she's in this message
[45:46] and she comes to church on sunday
[45:48] morning and half the church is gone
[45:50] including maybe the pastor
[45:52] and i say maybe
[45:54] what do you think they're gonna think
[45:57] what's gonna cross their mind when they
[45:59] say where did so and so go i don't know
[46:01] they're not answering my call
[46:04] they're not answering my texts
[46:06] i don't know they always call me back
[46:08] they always text me back
[46:10] they always show up for work
[46:12] and all of a sudden they're gone the
[46:13] only group that may understand that may
[46:16] know now the world may say well they're
[46:18] gone and you know we don't know what
[46:19] happened to them where they went maybe
[46:21] they ran away changed their identity in
[46:22] the world like we said the past two or
[46:24] three sundays the world makes up all
[46:26] kind of excuses for the things that god
[46:27] is doing in this world
[46:29] i told you one of the biggest ones
[46:30] climate change that's one of the big
[46:31] excuses they use for what god's doing in
[46:34] this world today but man is always
[46:36] trying to make excuses but if there's
[46:38] ever a group that's going to know what
[46:39] happened to that group it's going to be
[46:41] the foolish virgin
[46:43] now to be a secret catching way don't
[46:45] get me wrong i know that
[46:47] but if anybody's going to know what
[46:49] happened when it happened it's going to
[46:50] be the foolish virgin they're going to
[46:51] come up and say these people are gone
[46:54] my pastor's gone uh the the the brother
[46:57] i usually set to next to in church is
[47:00] gone and all these people aren't showing
[47:02] up and and and
[47:04] they're always there
[47:06] and they're gone
[47:07] what happened
[47:08] they'll know
[47:10] those people will know
[47:12] i believe they will anyway right
[47:15] enoch
[47:17] so so when the bridegroom came back and
[47:19] they said they said let us in let us in
[47:22] you know what let me go back to that
[47:26] um
[47:27] you can turn back if you'd like to we
[47:29] know the story
[47:31] but there's one other point i wanted to
[47:32] bring out about it and i wanted to do it
[47:35] by reading it i didn't just want to give
[47:37] it to you because it's i know it but
[47:40] read it to you
[47:42] the foolish eighth verse the foolish
[47:44] said unto the wise give us of your oil
[47:45] for our lamps are gone out the wise
[47:48] answers saying not so lest there be not
[47:50] enough for us and you but go ye rather
[47:52] to them that sell and buy for yourselves
[47:54] and while they went to buy the
[47:55] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[47:57] went in with him to the marriage and the
[47:59] door was shut
[48:01] the door was shut who shut the door
[48:04] do you think the wise virgins shut the
[48:06] door
[48:08] well certainly the foolish virgins
[48:09] didn't shut the door because there
[48:13] and when did he close the door
[48:15] he closed the door after the bride was
[48:18] separated from
[48:21] from judgment from this world right
[48:25] when else did god shut a door
[48:29] in enoch or with noah
[48:32] noah went in the ark the bible says god
[48:35] shut them in
[48:37] god shut the door
[48:39] so god shut the door then
[48:41] when did he shut the door
[48:43] he shut the door on the believer and the
[48:45] unbeliever the believer couldn't get out
[48:48] you believe unbeliever couldn't get in
[48:51] so god shut the door there god shut the
[48:53] door here god's the one that does the
[48:55] door shutting not man right right amen
[48:57] and nor would i want to amen
[49:00] but a just god
[49:03] and his righteous
[49:04] uh
[49:05] and we'll say even anger here
[49:08] shuts that door and there's nobody else
[49:10] getting in
[49:11] you can plead you can scream you can cry
[49:13] you can beg but there will that door
[49:15] will not come open it won't come open on
[49:17] the ark and it won't come open when god
[49:19] shuts it here
[49:21] and they screamed and yelled we did this
[49:23] we did this and he said depart i don't
[49:25] even know you now
[49:27] i brought this out before but i felt it
[49:29] very important to do again there's a
[49:31] couple of places that jesus in his
[49:33] parable says that i know ye not
[49:37] one of them is if you
[49:40] find in the greek one of them now
[49:42] they're translated to the same verbiage
[49:43] in english
[49:45] but one of them refers to jesus saying i
[49:48] never knew you as in i never had
[49:51] relations with you
[49:53] i never you were never a part of me i
[49:55] was never a part of you i i have no
[49:59] acknowledgement of you
[50:01] uh you were never in my thoughts you
[50:03] were never in my mind
[50:05] we never had relations with one another
[50:07] i did not know you and this i knew you
[50:11] not is i'm ignoring you
[50:13] it's a different word
[50:15] when jesus here says i know you not to
[50:18] the foolish virgin it's i'm ignoring you
[50:22] i'm not listening to you now you had
[50:24] your chance amen
[50:27] and and you'll have to go through this
[50:28] period you'll have to go
[50:31] uh wait through the
[50:32] through the millennium and and and be
[50:34] asleep for the thousand years uh to come
[50:37] up in the second resurrection i'm
[50:40] grossly paraphrasing them obviously but
[50:42] that's that's basically the gist of it
[50:44] but i'm ignoring you right now
[50:46] you had your chance you had the
[50:48] opportunity and you didn't do it
[50:51] i offered you over and over again the
[50:54] opportunity and the chance to receive my
[50:56] spirit into yourself and it and it
[50:58] didn't you did
[51:00] so i'm ignoring you now
[51:02] and that's that's what that that i know
[51:04] you not not that god
[51:07] never had them or or or was relation
[51:10] because see later in the 25th verse he
[51:12] actually grants them life
[51:15] or 25th chapter he actually grants them
[51:17] life but at that time that's not the
[51:20] time for it
[51:21] that time's the time of a rapture and
[51:23] only the predestinated gentile bride of
[51:26] god goes in that rapture amen
[51:29] the foolish tribulation period i don't
[51:31] know you
[51:33] so all of them virtuous
[51:35] enoch and
[51:37] noah both walked with god they both had
[51:40] the testimony that they walked with god
[51:43] they had that testimony
[51:45] but one went in a rapture
[51:48] and the other went through the
[51:49] tribulation
[51:50] like i said had relations with his
[51:52] daughter became a drunk ended up
[51:54] birthing moab and died to death amen
[51:57] type of the tribulation
[52:00] now
[52:01] and and the door was shut right at that
[52:04] time
[52:12] prophecy of jesus isaiah prophesied a
[52:14] virgin shall conceive brother brown says
[52:16] 800 years wasn't 800 years it was 700
[52:19] and some odd years was negan was he
[52:21] rounding up i don't know i don't bring
[52:24] you anything
[52:25] that i don't know that the lord's
[52:27] revealed to me or i can find the
[52:28] scripture in the message
[52:30] i don't i just don't do it
[52:32] now i've had different people tell me
[52:34] different things and
[52:36] and uh and i've had people tell me like
[52:38] this is the way it happened you know i'm
[52:40] sorry brother but where is your where is
[52:42] your authority on that
[52:45] i i
[52:46] because if it doesn't come from the
[52:48] scripture
[52:49] that's the third that's the authority
[52:51] and of course the the derivative of the
[52:53] scriptures the message we have you can't
[52:55] find it i you know
[52:57] i don't know what your authority is to
[52:59] tell me this is exactly how it happened
[53:02] um i i'm sorry i can't go with you there
[53:05] you may be right and that's fine if you
[53:06] are that's great but the good part isn't
[53:09] to
[53:10] have anything to do with my salvation
[53:11] but just telling you that's what brother
[53:13] branham said if you get those conflicts
[53:16] of those things this is another one
[53:17] brother brahm said
[53:19] and this is still on the first seal he
[53:20] said what was it like enoch you know
[53:23] noah watched enoch
[53:25] for when enoch come up missing he no
[53:27] judgment was at hand he got to hanging
[53:30] around the ark but noah didn't go up he
[53:33] just
[53:34] lifted a little piece rode over the
[53:35] tribulation carried through the
[53:37] tribulation died of the dead
[53:39] enoch was translated without death the
[53:41] type of the church being caught up
[53:44] uh with those which are asleep to meet
[53:46] the lord in the air the rest of the
[53:47] church carried through the tribulation
[53:48] period now brother pat made us this of
[53:51] course you could look in the scripture
[53:52] because that's where brother pat got it
[53:54] from this uh chart
[53:56] if you've gotten it looked at it there's
[53:58] still more over there if you don't have
[54:00] one you can clearly see obviously that
[54:03] enoch was not alive
[54:05] when the flood took place
[54:08] but i want to bring you something
[54:09] interesting because i i've actually had
[54:11] people tell me about that too
[54:13] and i don't know if it's true or not and
[54:15] i and and and and i don't know i'm not
[54:17] bringing this as doctrine to you i'm
[54:19] just giving this is
[54:21] something that maybe you can chew on and
[54:23] you can decide for yourself but enoch
[54:26] had methuselah
[54:28] we know that scripturally methuselah was
[54:31] issued from enoch's lineage he was he
[54:33] was his son
[54:35] enoch named methuselah obviously as his
[54:38] son
[54:39] well if you look at methuselah now
[54:41] there's a couple places you have to find
[54:43] it but it's spelled differently
[54:46] methuselah spelled two or three
[54:47] different ways scripturally and in the
[54:50] greek
[54:51] lexicon spelled two or three different
[54:53] ways so you have to find but this is
[54:55] m-a-t-h math
[54:57] o-u-s-a-o-u-s-a-l-a
[55:01] methuselah
[55:03] that methuselah
[55:04] means when he dies
[55:07] there shall be an emission
[55:09] or a sending forth of waters upon the
[55:13] earth
[55:14] that is the definition of this
[55:17] methuselah in a th o
[55:21] that's right that's the definition of
[55:23] that that methuselah's name enoch named
[55:26] methuselah
[55:27] methuselah
[55:29] the definition of the name on the
[55:31] meaning of the name is when he dies
[55:34] there shall be an admission come forth
[55:36] or ascending forth of waters upon the
[55:39] earth which would be outstanding
[55:41] considering the fact that it had never
[55:43] rained on the earth before then
[55:46] why would enoch have named methuselah
[55:48] methuselah that then
[55:50] unless he knew
[55:53] by being walking with god maybe on one
[55:56] of his walks with god god said you know
[55:57] you know i'm going to do this this and
[55:59] this and so enoch named methuselah
[56:01] methuselah so when methuselah dies
[56:03] there's going to be an emission well you
[56:04] know when methuselah died the exact same
[56:07] year that the blood came
[56:09] amen
[56:11] it was pretty easy for me to find
[56:12] because like i said brother pat put it
[56:14] in this chart
[56:16] that you can see methuselah died right
[56:18] before the flood came
[56:21] amen now people smarter than me or have
[56:23] more time to study it out than me can
[56:25] look at the exact dates month day time
[56:28] whatever uh
[56:31] that's not necessarily significant to me
[56:33] the fact of the matter is methuselah
[56:35] died right before the flood
[56:38] noah named methuselah methuselah knowing
[56:42] that that was the meaning of his name
[56:44] that when he dies there'll be a flooding
[56:47] of water coming on the earth
[56:49] now is that what brother branham was
[56:51] referencing or is that what the holy
[56:52] spirit was speaking through brother
[56:54] branham to reference
[56:56] i don't know right i don't know but i
[56:58] find it quite quite outstanding that
[57:01] that those two things
[57:03] match together right i mean
[57:06] surely we you know as christians we
[57:08] don't believe in coincidence anyway but
[57:10] surely that's not a coincidence that
[57:12] enoch would name his son of methuselah
[57:15] amen knowing that that's what it meant
[57:18] and he died at the exact same time the
[57:20] flood came
[57:21] but nevertheless
[57:24] the fact is that when brother branham
[57:26] said that he walked with god he walked
[57:28] with god
[57:30] and and then he was not
[57:33] because god took him very well
[57:37] enoch went in the rapture
[57:39] the wise virgin
[57:42] noah went through the tribulation as the
[57:44] foolish virgin
[57:47] now this this i'm going to close here
[57:51] no good
[57:52] teacher
[57:54] got in god hiding and revealing himself
[57:56] in simplicity now this is the
[57:57] albuquerque one so this is after the
[58:00] seals not the one before the breach
[58:02] god hiding himself in simplicity no good
[58:05] teacher and this was in albuquerque
[58:07] no good teacher believes that the church
[58:10] the bride he said the church goes
[58:12] through the tribulation you notice when
[58:13] brother branham started when the holy
[58:15] spirit started to reveal to brother
[58:17] branham the distinction between the
[58:19] church and the bride the calling out of
[58:21] the bride from the church he started
[58:24] fluctuating back and forth especially
[58:26] when he was in mixed company
[58:28] uh he did it at home too but when he was
[58:30] out visiting other churches
[58:32] um
[58:34] you know you get so used to saying
[58:36] something one way
[58:37] even when something comes to you and you
[58:39] you know it's different it's hard to
[58:42] change from that so when you mention it
[58:44] then uh then
[58:46] it's like calling uh it's like it took
[58:49] me forever to make sure and called joel
[58:51] joel instead of micah
[58:53] because i mean for 31 years he's been
[58:55] our son we call it my cuts on a boy
[58:57] comes in hey my guys no it's joel you
[59:00] know you get so used to saying something
[59:02] one way you know
[59:04] it just it just happens that way and
[59:06] that's what brother brown did
[59:08] and many times he would do that
[59:10] sometimes he corrected sometimes he
[59:11] didn't
[59:12] but he's correcting it here he said now
[59:14] the church goes to the tribulation but
[59:16] not the bride the church goes through
[59:19] the tribulation for purification sure
[59:21] under the sixth seal which
[59:24] which baffles
[59:26] the thought of people who believe the
[59:28] bride is going through the tribulation
[59:30] period because the point of the
[59:32] tribulation period is a purging time
[59:35] the sixth seal
[59:37] the the tribulation is a time of purging
[59:40] and purifying
[59:42] well why does the bride of christ need
[59:44] to be purified
[59:46] when the blood of jesus christ has
[59:48] already purified her she's been found
[59:51] not guilty and god has put his own life
[59:54] in her right right
[59:55] then why does she need to go through
[59:57] purification for
[59:59] blood of jesus christ has purified her
[1:00:01] amen amen she's as pure and white as as
[1:00:05] as god has washed her in his own blood
[1:00:08] right amen so if the sick seal is that
[1:00:10] purging period the bride doesn't need
[1:00:13] purging
[1:00:14] she's him
[1:00:16] right she's become him there's no
[1:00:18] purging for her to go through but the
[1:00:19] church does
[1:00:21] the foolish virgin does because they did
[1:00:24] not receive that oil they they need to
[1:00:26] go they have that time of need to go
[1:00:29] through that purification that uh that
[1:00:31] purging period
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] brother venom also includes again i'm
[1:00:36] closing another group in this
[1:00:39] he said the bride goes through the
[1:00:40] purification the church goes through for
[1:00:42] purification under the sixth seal right
[1:00:45] he said israel does the same thing
[1:00:48] for the hundred and forty four thousand
[1:00:50] the church so the the church the the
[1:00:54] foolish virgin and the hundred and forty
[1:00:56] four thousand go through the tribulation
[1:00:59] for a purification process
[1:01:01] purging
[1:01:03] but the bride does not go through that
[1:01:05] time
[1:01:06] she's at the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:01:08] amen proving once again
[1:01:10] that this rapture is only for the
[1:01:13] predestinated gentile bride
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:17] she goes
[1:01:19] the bride is forgiven
[1:01:20] she goes straight into glory in a
[1:01:23] rapture that's right see my opinion the
[1:01:26] last member
[1:01:28] will be will be caught up one of these
[1:01:30] days it might come and you would never
[1:01:32] know anything about it remember it's a
[1:01:34] secret secret catching away he'll come
[1:01:37] in an hour that you think not
[1:01:39] and that's the period of time that we're
[1:01:40] living right now amen amen that's the
[1:01:43] period of time that we're living right
[1:01:44] now i believe that
[1:01:46] uh
[1:01:47] there's people that are going on
[1:01:50] again that i mentioned that are that are
[1:01:52] passing away by large numbers large
[1:01:55] numbers people i
[1:01:57] i personally know
[1:01:59] even friends of mine
[1:02:01] uh that i know from back east
[1:02:04] and from from california to north
[1:02:06] carolina
[1:02:08] uh passing away right
[1:02:11] but they're
[1:02:12] and then i don't know why
[1:02:14] i i don't know that i'll ever know why i
[1:02:16] don't know if i need to know why
[1:02:18] but i do know there's there there must
[1:02:20] be all these believers leaving must be a
[1:02:23] reason spiritually
[1:02:25] something happening in the spirit realm
[1:02:27] we see all the things that's going on
[1:02:29] around us and we can recognize what's
[1:02:31] happening see
[1:02:33] amen we know the bride the bride is
[1:02:35] she's become him she's she's in she's in
[1:02:38] his coffers she's the she's perfect
[1:02:40] she's bird she's the bride
[1:02:43] sinless
[1:02:44] but all the other thing that goes on
[1:02:46] around her that has it has an effect you
[1:02:49] can feel it and when you and when a
[1:02:52] loved one goes on or or a good friend or
[1:02:54] something it you feel it
[1:02:57] you're happy for them but you miss them
[1:03:00] you know because it's a it's a part of
[1:03:02] the flesh the bible says that there is a
[1:03:05] time to mourn
[1:03:06] amen and we mourn
[1:03:08] and then we thank god for their life and
[1:03:10] that they're with him and we move on
[1:03:12] right amen
[1:03:14] praise the lord
[1:03:16] the the the the morning period comes
[1:03:19] when there's a time to celebrate them
[1:03:21] you know the bible says that we should
[1:03:24] uh the bible says that we should cry
[1:03:26] when they're born and celebrate when
[1:03:27] they die we'd as humans and our selfish
[1:03:31] flesh we do just the opposite
[1:03:33] amen but
[1:03:35] understand again this this rapture
[1:03:38] that we're talking about even from the
[1:03:40] dead in christ that rise is only for the
[1:03:42] predestinated elected chosen gentile
[1:03:46] bride of jesus christ amen amen amen
[1:03:50] praise the lord and we see that
[1:03:52] identified to us very plainly i think in
[1:03:54] the scripture that tells us that amen
[1:03:57] let's stand if we could
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:12] i don't know why they keep sending me
[1:04:13] texts i get texts
[1:04:15] i'm preaching and people sending me
[1:04:17] texts i'm going to look at my phone when
[1:04:19] i'm preaching
[1:04:20] or even in church sometimes
[1:04:23] but uh praise the lord i'm thankful the
[1:04:25] stream has started working so amen
[1:04:28] appreciate the
[1:04:30] micah's efforts sometimes uh human
[1:04:32] machines and
[1:04:33] mechanical devices and man-made things
[1:04:35] just don't always go the way you want
[1:04:37] them to or think they should
[1:04:39] sometimes they don't work probably right
[1:04:40] but thank god that we have them so i'm
[1:04:43] looking into getting some new equipment
[1:04:45] too uh a new camera
[1:04:48] to hang up over there for streaming so
[1:04:51] we'll see if it's something that looks
[1:04:53] like it's going to work out then
[1:04:55] we might do that and so we'll have an
[1:04:57] actual camera and a microphone and
[1:04:59] things like that
[1:05:00] and how many of you enjoy brother john's
[1:05:02] song leading yeah
[1:05:04] i've enjoyed it
[1:05:06] and brother zach on the guitar and it's
[1:05:08] like that talent in matthew 25.

[1:05:15] and he made five talents for his five
[1:05:17] talent and he said

[1:05:21] the one who buried his talent and hid it
[1:05:23] in the ground god cast him into outer
[1:05:25] darkness
