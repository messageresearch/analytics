And appreciate them being with us. Let's just bow our heads if we could for a word of prayer. Just invite his presence today. Amen. Lord Jesus, very thankful once again today, Lord, for another beautiful day that you've given us. Father, it's not beautiful because the weather outside is nice. It's beautiful because you are alive. You are Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. And you are with us. You are in us. You were leading, guiding, and directing us. We come into this house, your house, Lord, to worship and to glorify and to exalt your holy and precious name. So thankful of this another time, God, that you give us. We don't know how many more of these times that we have, but Lord, we want to take advantage of every moment that we have, God, to come to your house to worship, to praise you, to glorify you. Lord, we see the things of the world and how this time is winding up. But God, we know that eternity is right at the doorstep for us. We're looking for that body change. We're looking for our loved ones to appear before us at any time that we go home to be with you. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Oh, bless this service today, God, as we commit it into your hands. Lord, bless brother no, Father, as he brings the word. May your hand be upon him and strengthen him and bless him. Speak to him through him, Lord. May you speak to him, God, to for whatever we have need of today. Lord, we're a needy people, God. We commit ourselves to you. We rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt, hind or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory, honor, and praise for all that is done in this done in this place today. We commit it to you now. Ask your blessings. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. It was something when brother Null and Sister Shirley came through the door this morning, it uh just uh kind of redawned on me that uh good friend of mine, Brother Mike Worers, had gone to be with the Lord since we saw them last. And uh he was a precious brother. I loved him very much. And we've been talking about adoption and placement. And if I was to say anybody found their place in the Lord, it was brother Mike. Uh if I've ever there's only this is a bold statement but there's only two men that I can recall that I know were Godfilled God bought Godborn song leaders and that was Mike orders and brother Terry Walker. Those the two people that I know Amen. The Lord has showed me I know that I believe brother Mike orders that he fulfilled his position in this. I wish he was here to sing this song service. It' be a whole lot better than what you're about to endure today. But Amen. 581. We'll go turn over to 581. We'll have it on the screen here too for you. And I saw love, mercy, and grace. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. That's what we see when we look at it. Love, mercy, and grace. Amen. I saw love, mercy, and grace. I saw love, mercy, and grace. I envision, his beauty. I look on his face.

If it weren't for that, saints, where would we be today? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's turn over turn over to Psalm number 93 in the book. We have it on here. Amen. Psalm number 93, the love of God. Amen. The precious love of God. Hallelujah. What love it is, saints. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Psalm number 93. with you home with the book this morning. [Music] The love of God is greater far than tongue or pin can ever tell. It goes beyond the highest star and it reaches to the lowest hill. The guilty pair bowed down with care. God gave his son to win. His every child he reconciled [Music] and parted from his sin. Oh love of God, how rich and pure, [Music] how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure. The saints end so when years of time shall pass away [Applause] and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall. And men who hear refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains call. God's love so sure shall still endure. All measureless and strong redeeming grace to Adam's race the saints and name Jill song. Oh love of God [Music] how rich and pure. [Music] How measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the saints and shall soul. Listen to this last verse now. Could we within the ocean filled? And were the skies of parchment made? Were every stall on earth a queer and every man ascribe by dream to write the love of God above would drain the old sh nor Destroy contain the home. No stretched from sky. Hallelujah to sky. Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong. It shall forever more endure the saints and name just song. Go one more time now.

The love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How rich, how pure, how beautiful, how righteous, how strong. Amen. That love reached down one day and saw me. Amen. Picked me up, set me upon his rock to stay. Oh, hallelujah. Thank God for the love of God. Lord, would we be without it? Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. One more before we go to the Lord in prayer. Amen. You know, I believe Brother Ram said the last verse of that song was written on the wall of an insane asylum. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Think about the love of God. What it is to think about the love of God. Amen. How rich, how pure. Amen. Praise the Lord. One more before we go to the Lord in prayer. Now, Psalm number 343. Amen. Praise the Lord. If that isn't love, my sister loved this song so much. She sang it all the time. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. I don't know, Mike. I might need to start with the chorus on this one. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [Music] I'm not getting for some reason. The ocean is dry. &gt;&gt; There's no stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. If that is in love, then heavens are me. Well, there's no feeling like this. If that isn't love. If that isn't love. The ocean is dry. There's no stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. [Music] If that isn't love, [Music] then heavens are me. Well, there's no feeling like this if that isn't love. One more time. Yes, if that isn't love. The ocean is dry. There's no stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. If that isn't love, then heavens are me. There's no feeling like this. [Music] If that isn't love, amen. Oh, praise the Lord. That is love. A love the world knows nothing about. &gt;&gt; A love that is greater than any human understanding, any human comprehension. That love goes far beyond anything anybody would even imagine. Amen. The world, the way the world world describes love today is you just have to go along with anything and everything they do and think and feel and say. That's love. You you only love someone if you agree with everything they do. That's not love, friend. Love reaches out to a lost soul and tells them that they're wrong and tries to get them in. Amen. A love is a love that reaches out to try to keep somebody from going to hell. Amen. Brings them in to try to try to bring them to salvation. That's love. That's God's love. Amen. It's the only love there is to me. Praise the Lord. It's God's love. Amen. What a love it is. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Go to the Lord in prayer. Amen. take prayer requests. I have a few to mention to you today. Brother Dennis is not with us again. Uh he's having a real struggle with his foot. If you please pray for him. Uh as you know, he's a diabetic, but he's got that ulcer on the bottom of his foot. He just can't get well. Uh he had two skin grafts as we said last week. The second one still didn't take. Uh so this doctor is really confused that not sure why it's not taking. So she recommended to go to another doctor. Maybe there's something that she's missing something. She's not thinking of something uh to help. But we know who the healer is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows who the healer is. Brother Dennis knows his healing comes from the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, let's please remember uh him in prayer. The Lord would touch his foot. Amen. And uh and heal that. Also, Brother Danny, please remember to pray for him. Amen. He needs a special brother Danny's going through some spiritual battles. So, please remember him in prayer. He really needs the Lord to reach out, send the Holy Ghost to his way, bring him back in. Amen. Bring him back. Sister Norma's not with us today. Uh her uh dog got attacked and she I guess she said as she said she took the brunt of it, but she's feeling better, but she stayed home to I guess to nurse the dog that they the other little dog that they had. So, uh please remember her in prayer as well. Sister Julie's not going to be with us today. I do have a testimony from her that I want to give to you, but we'll do that a little bit later. Amen. So, please pray for her. Uh, I guess Art, &gt;&gt; he's still trying to get better. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Art's been sick. He's had some his back's been given so much problems. It's him at work. So, please remember him in prayer. Good to have Shrine kids with us. So, uh, remember brother Pat, sister Pat, they're not with us, of course. Uh, So healing, mending, getting better from operations. And just as he says every time, they're just getting old. Uh so coming to church is a little more difficult, but they always stream. I hope and pray they're streaming. Of course, brother Dennis probably is and others. So please remember, we're just God bless you. Hate that you're not here with us, but uh we're so thankful that the Lord touch you. Please remember sister Karen and uh brother Tom. haven't heard of a time frame that they'll be coming back down, but it's going to be getting cold up here pretty quick. So, looking forward to having them back with us as well. Uh, as you know, this is Sister Anna's week to work. So, remember her and Stephen prayer and Madison the Lord. So, it's a lot of names, a lot of prayer requests, a lot of people not here. Amen. And I told brother null before church, I said, "When I went to minister, whenever I minister, if I'm ministering, whether I'm pastoring or visiting, whatever it is, I've never cared how many people that were there." Uh, I went to a service one time with a brother, there was there was not a single other male in the entire church but me. Not one of everybody else there was females. I led the opening prayer, the I had every prayer. I had every ser uh uh song, the ministry, I did everything in the service. That's never bothered me. But when you pastor and you have a visiting minister, you really like to have people in the seats, uh even though I know Brother Null can look up at the camera, there's probably as many or maybe more on that camera right now than there is sitting here. But uh but we're very thankful for those that have come and are here. And we're thankful for those that are watching, too. But please remember these requests of these needs that we have today. Amen. The Lord is mindful of them all. Is anyone else has something special on your heart you'd like to mention? Amen. unspoken request. The Lord knows all of our hearts today and so thankful that he does. Let's stand to our feet if we could. Amen. Looking forward to the message today. &gt;&gt; God, Lord Jesus, we come to you, Lord God. It's another Sunday, Lord Jesus. time that we've set aside to to come together and worship you and bring our little looks of fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; A bigger fire and to feed off of each other, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; To pray one for another, Lord Jesus, to to bask in your your presence together, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Thank you, Lord. to ask Lord that you forgive us of anything that would stand between us and you to stand between us receiving what you'd have for us whether it's a blessing of spiritual blessing a financial blessing mental emotional Lord Jesus may just help us and lead us and forgive us Lord God of anything that would hinder us &gt;&gt; Lord yes &gt;&gt; many of us are are missing today Lord Jesus for various reasons Father God and I'm not going to attempt to recite the name Lord Jesus I don't want to leave anyone out but Father you know who they are Lord Jesus a physical ailment, emotional ailment, financial ailment. Lord God may go to where each and every one of us are Lord God and the bride worldwide and touch us and be with us and heal us Lord God. We commit ourselves in the right remaining part of this service into your hands. Thank you Lord Jesus and you'll fulfill the request that we ask is and your will have Jesus ourselves and everything into your hands in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. I want to give you that testimony from Sister Julie. It's about her sister. Um she said she wouldn't be able to make it to church, but she wanted to give this testimony. Uh and I want to make sure just cut through this. So um uh want the church to know to give a testimony that my sister's illness uh was healed quickly when the doctor found her uh incision was infected. She had a surgery on her foot. Uh she had she got a new cast put on and a different antibiotic. The sickness she had uh for a week resolved in 24 hours. Amen. Praise the Lord. Maybe I should use this. I'm used to having a little bit fail uh for you. Uh let's see. No, that's it. So, she wanted to thank God for uh healing her sister very quick that I think it was Achilles. It was Achilles that she had um if I remember. So thankful for that. The Lord just blessed and touched her and helped her to get to heal and get well quickly. Amen. I appreciate your prayers for me. I had a good week. It was a rough week. It was a lot of hours. Always is. Uh but uh the Lord worked out. I felt good and felt strong. And uh so thankful towards the end of the day Friday uh after lunch my my Achilles started. I didn't even know what this was. But it started hurting so bad. I didn't feel a pop or anything. Uh what they would say if you rupture or something or what they call it, maybe it is rupture, achilles tear. Uh so I didn't feel anything like that, but it was just really hurt and have a hard time. And I still I still had three or four more hours going up and down a ladder 100 times. Up, down, up, down. And it's it's that much more when you're stepping on something and you're on a ladder and your heel goes down when you're going up. And it just made it that much harder. But uh thankfully the Lord blessed it. It was hurting yesterday. I had a hard time walking and getting around, but thankfully yesterday I was off. Was just had to get from the hotel to the airport to the airport to uh and then home. So I'm thankful for that. And this morning I woke up and I got in here and started praying this morning and uh it dawned on me because I always thank God for my health and my strength and healing and uh as you all know my knees I haven't worn my braces in two or three months now. My knees my knees are so good being able to get down on the floor to work now again. Uh God just healed them. I'm so thankful for that. But I started praying about that and I thought about that Achilles and I thought I didn't even felt it this morning. didn't even didn't even remember that it was even sore or hurt or anything. I looked up yesterday and it just said that if it's sore or hurting like that, it's from overuse. I thought, well, I've certainly did that. That's for sure. Uh but I didn't even feel it this morning. Didn't even realize, didn't even remember it until um till I was in prayer and the Lord brought back back to my attention. I said, "Yes, thank you, Lord." Uh healing. Amen. God is our healer. So, praise the Lord. I'm so thankful he is. He's so good to us. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We'll sing one more. We're going to have brother Noah come up here. Psalm number 187.

So thankful for that. Glad you're able to feel well enough to be with us today, too. Amen. Missed you last week. Always miss you when you're not here so much, you know. But praise the Lord for that.

Praise the Lord Jesus. You know, it's uh it's really it it really illuminates when you become a parent of the love of God. And you can often speak on it and think about it how that love can equate over to the human element when it's a parent and a child and know that no matter and having raised two children, no matter how far they had gone or how deep they had gotten or where they were, you still loved them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prodigal son came back. He the dad loved that son so much. The son was scared to death of his dad. He afraid of what it was going to happen, what he's going to do. He came and said, "Dad, I'll just be a servant. Just let me." He said, "Oh my." Put a ring on his finger, put the cloak on him. Let's celebrate and have a party.

I trust he has something for uh us to say. We've been praying for him. Amen. Over the past few weeks that the Lord would just give him what we have need of and trust that that would be so. So let's sing Only Believe. Brother Null comes and ministers the word for us here now. Amen. Sing it with all your heart now. Holy believe. All that you believe that all things are possible. Only believe. [Music] Only believe. Only believe all things are possible. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And it's my privilege to to be with you once again. Um I have a If you'd stand in honor of God's word, I just I'm not much in preliminary. It's just the way I am. Turn to Hebrews the fourth chapter and read verses one and two. And the basic subject matter is resting. Learning to rest in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; That's something God's been dealing with me and uh Lord willing'll be able to get into it and be able to bless you with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. to Hebrews the 4th chapter verse starting in verse one says let us therefore fear lest they promise being left up so entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel of praise as well as unto them but the word praise did not profit them not being mixed with faith then they heard it &gt;&gt; amen let's just pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is again our privilege is to come and gather ourselves together as part of your body here on Lord, you've chosen to speak through a man and it's fallen my lot, Lord, to stand before the purchase of your blood. But Lord, they haven't come to hear me. They've come to listen to you. So Lord, use my voice. &gt;&gt; Speak through me, Lord, in way that you would bless the people. &gt;&gt; Grant this for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; You know it says in Hebrews what it says here, it says, "Let us let us therefore fear." And I looked up the fear and some people oh trembling and stuff. It it's it's to be fearful of that there's something that we're missing. &gt;&gt; It's realizing that there's something that God has for us but we're we might be missing it if we don't concentrate on it. If we if we don't accept it, if we don't grasp hold of what God has been trying to do for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "For unto us the gospel was preached as well as unto them, but the work preached did not profit them not being mixed faith and heard it right. And when I began to look at what God has done in this generation, God sent to us a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God through that prophet performed miracle, miracle after miracle after miracle. God became in my in my God for me became a reality. He wasn't something I read about as as a child, not something that the the preachers preached about or the Sunday school taught us about. No. But when I begin to look at the life and the ministry of the prophet, God in him became a reality to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't I don't I don't worship brother Brad, but I have confidence in what God has said through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and uh I got this little thought about a week or so ago. You know, life is a journey into an unknown. &gt;&gt; We don't know what tomorrow's going to bring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything could be going fine today and then tomorrow everything can turn upside down and go who knows where. Okay. But who are you going to trust to lead you becomes the thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I was and I and one of the things here again what I was thinking about he says I says I I I personally believe that Christians should be able to so place their faith in God that we that we can be in a constant state of rest. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A state where we no longer fear tomorrow or what it may bring because we know God is the one in control. And I believe he's directing my life. &gt;&gt; That's beautiful. When I look at what goes on in this world, if I didn't believe God was in control, man, I would have no hopes for nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I look at America, I look at the situation, I look at all the turmoil, all the stupidity, and all the things going on in Congress, and I realize if I was resting in my government, forget it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I was resting on the things of the world for my future, forget it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, I've had to come in my own personal walk with God. I've had to believe. I've had to come to the place where I rest in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, I don't know what tomorrow will bring, but I know that God's already been there. If he's already been there, he knows what I'm going to face. If he knows what I'm going to face, if I trust him, he'll take me through it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And that that's how I look at it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham in in a statement, he said, "Why are people so tossed about?" &gt;&gt; He said, "The Christian faith is based solidly upon rest." &gt;&gt; That's right. A Christian is not tossed about. Christian doesn't run from place to place. Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things. A Christian rests. It's all over. It's all finished for the believer at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is all the sickness may come and disappointment. He says, "But the Christians at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed, knowing that no matter what the thing is or how it works, there's neither sickness nor sorrow nor death. there neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to me, this is when I when I keep looking at this and what and and what what God's been dealing with me is there has to come a place within my life where I'm at rest. &gt;&gt; I don't worry about tomorrow. I don't worry about the things that may come. I don't worry about, you know, anything anymore. &gt;&gt; Yes. But I have I've tried to come to a place in my relationship with God where I rest in in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if I'm resting in him and I've asked him to guide and direct my life, then I and I and and I committed my life to him, then I have to believe that he will take care of me. He will watch over me. He will provide for me. He will do the things which which I I have asked him to. &gt;&gt; But just because I ask him to doesn't necessarily mean he's obligated to me to do it. &gt;&gt; Sure. Okay, I can ask him and it's like my wife I I pray to God that he would allow me one more time to go back to India. Um situations being what it is and in flight and at our age we have our own little limitations and problems and shortcomings and stuff. But I asked Lord if you would be so gracious to allow me just one more time &gt;&gt; because it'll be 20 years that we've been ministering in India. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought about that. that that that's a milestone that that's an anniversary whenever you want to do it. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to go back and see what God has allowed me to be a part of for for 20 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I had to come to the place where I where I where I where I reach the place where I would I would just take I would take the thing I would take my desire and said, "Lord, you have to work it out. &gt;&gt; You have to provide the means. You have to provide the health. You have to provide all of the other things which are going on in my life. and and even in the lives in in India &gt;&gt; that you have to work it out where you'll allow me to go and then be safe so I can go there and I can return safely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we began to think of this this I was trying to find how can I present this thought that you that God has placed within me and I went and I began to think of a couple of characters we have in the Bible and I thought about David. David to me is very interesting when I look at his life and the things that transpired in his life. David was out minding his own business, taking care of his dead sheep. God had taken Samuel and says, "You're going to go to David's household, his father, whatever, and you're going to anoint there the next king of Israel." &gt;&gt; Okay. So Samuel takes the anointing oil. He goes to David's dad and says, "I need to see who your I need to have your sons presented before me." And so he sees this nice, strong, handsome, you know, stout fellow and and he say, "Oh man, that has to be the next king. I mean, look at the strength he has and stuff." &gt;&gt; And God says, "No, I've rejected him." And he went down every one of them until finally Saul looked around and says, "Is this all of them? Don't you have one more?" Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he's he's out there feeding some sheep. Well, can you bring him? Yeah. All right. You know, send a servant out to and I'm paraphrasing you. You allow me that. Been out out to go David and so the servant says, "Hey, David, your dad wants to see you." Okay. So, David, as soon as he walks in, God told S God told Samuel, "That's the one." &gt;&gt; Yep. So here here's this crazy old man white hair takes his orange and ring and pours it all over David's head and says, "You are the next king of Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Really? Uh okay. What was David's reaction? Oh, I got to go see Saul. I have to learn how to be a king. &gt;&gt; Now he went back to the sheep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But see, God be God from the beginning of time had ordained David to be the king of Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. God had to bring things to pass in David's life that would bring him to that point where he would become what God had ordained for him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why was all of a sudden David called to to go to before Saul and and play his heart? &gt;&gt; Because God had put an evil spirit on Saul and Saul became disturbed and and so whenever David played, well, it would soothe him down and stuff like that. Well, that was that was fine. And then there was a battle with the Philistines. So David was sent back home to take care of the sheep and and David's brothers were sent off to the battle to to fight the Philistines. And well, his dad was concerned about how the battle was going. So he took David and gave him a bunch of honey and cakes and whatever else and, you know, go to where the battle was and see how see how your brothers are doing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So David walks up there and just about the time he gets this big huge man Goliath. He stands up and makes his boat. He says, "Just send somebody to me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I kill him, you serve me. If he kills me, we'll serve you. No problem. You know, why do we all have to battle like this? &gt;&gt; And David heard this. But see, now God had prepared him for the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a lion came in one day to attack the sheep. David went after the lion. I wouldn't have, but David went after the lion to kill the animal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and then another time all of a sudden a bear came in. Well, they tell me with bear one swipe with his hand and you know your head goes one direction, your body goes a different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh but he went after the bear rescued the sheep. Yes. &gt;&gt; And God delivered him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But see, God was preparing him for Goliath &gt;&gt; when all of a sudden Goliath made his bows and and then the anointing I if you will, I believe would have come upon David. So, who is this uncircumcised? We are the children of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are God. God has chosen us to be a representative upon the face of this earth to represent him, to glorify him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, what's this guy doing? He says, "You guys are afraid to fight this guy." &gt;&gt; He says, "All the promises rest in us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing rests in him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, and so Saul tried to put his theological armor on him and he told him he can keep all of that. David went down. He got five little stones, put them in a shepherd's purse, and all of a sudden when Goliath came out and made the bows, David ran towards Goliath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't try and duck and try and How are we going to do? No, he ran toward Goliath. &gt;&gt; He reached in. He took one little stone, put in the sling, swung it, and let it go. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God had to direct the stone, &gt;&gt; but he's got it went right where it needed to go. Goliath fell down. David reached over to Goliath's sword and killed him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; End of the story, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, all of a sudden, oh, this is great. You know, so then all of a sudden then the Israelites, the the the Israelite, the army, all of a sudden they got courage. So then they went and began to attack the Philistines and Okay. And so David then became part of of of the of the the group within within Saul's cabinet, if you will, wherever he would sit at the table. And so and so Saul took David and he made it so that David would lead the army. &gt;&gt; This is a young guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh probably just a late, you know, teenager would be my guess. I could be wrong on that. But David went out and God was with him and God would lead him and guide him. And then Saul became jealous &gt;&gt; and then David had to flee for his life. &gt;&gt; Right? And so David went here and he went there and and and and but but the thing that you notice whenever you're reading about David, David listened to God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God li led him, guided him, provided for him. God directed him in the battles. God God pursu God preserved him and all of the other types of stuff. God was preparing him to go be and go and become what God God had ordained for him to be. Mhm. &gt;&gt; There was one time when David with they were hid away in a cave and W Saul had to go in and do his business so to speak and uh David was there with his with a lot of his men. Been easy to kill him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In fact, one of his servants is just let me go. He says I only have to smite him once. &gt;&gt; Right. Yep. &gt;&gt; But you know, David's reaction was quite different than what you would expect. &gt;&gt; David in In 1st Samuel 26, he go David goes on. He says, "And David said unto Abashai, destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and be guiltless." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David said, "Therefore, that as the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battle and perish." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I pray thee, take now thy spear and that that his bolster and cruise of water and you know let him be fired. But see this was David's attitude. If I am to be the king, I will do it in God's timing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When I am to be a if I'm to be anointed king and I'm to be and I am to rule the nation of Israel, God will provide the way. God will open the door. or God will do whatever is necessary where I can ascend to that throne where I can become what God had ordained for me to be without me trying to accomplish it on my own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometime we have to look at our lives. God has ordained every one of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For a purpose, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We don't know what that purpose is. A lot of us don't know what they are. I I had never desired to be a preacher. My my my younger brother hadn't either. Look at him what he does now. Um, but each of us, God has led us. God has guided us. God has opened doors. He's shut doors. He's He's guided us in different directions and done what he has done. Because, see, God had a plan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And now I'm trying to fulfill what I believe his plan for my life is. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's another there's another person that when I look at Joseph, it's an interesting to me. It's an interesting story. Joseph was a dreamer. God gave him a couple of dreams. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, yeah." He said, he said, "What's going to, you know, uh let's see." Yeah. Okay. Joseph dreamed a dream. And and he told his brethren, and they hated him. And he said unto them, "Here, I pray that this dream that I've dreamed, for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheep rose, and also stood upright, and behold, your sheav just stood around about and bowed to me." &gt;&gt; And his brethren said, "So shalt thou reign over us, or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?" And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words. And yet he dreamed another dream and told his brethren. It says, "And I have dreamed and dreamed more. And behold, the sun and the moon, the 11 stars bowed to me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He told him his father and his brethren, even his father rebuked him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So he has his dreams. His brothers hated him. His dad even rebuked him. How is it that there's going to come a time in in in in in in in in in Joseph's life that his father and mother and his brethren are going to bow before him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh Joseph had no idea what he was going to have to go through &gt;&gt; to get where God had ordained for him to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went out to his dad was asking see how the your brothers are doing. They got he got out there and so they said, "Hey, here's that dreamer of dreams." They took him, stuck him in a pit &gt;&gt; and one of his brother, one of his brothers said, "Hey, let's not kill him." So they all of a sudden a caravan came by. Ah, hey, let's just sell him into slavery. So they sold him into slavery. He got down into Egypt. He was bought by Potterer and then he Potterer gave him their management of his house and he was Joseph was doing a good job &gt;&gt; but Potterer's wife all of a sudden decided she wanted to have an affair with him &gt;&gt; and so she accused him later on of having an affair that threw him into prison right so it went from bad to worse and so there he was in the prison he couldn't do anything at all I mean he know I mean he he was I don't think he was bound in chains but here Again, it wasn't the best of conditions. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Lo and behold, a little while later on, all of a sudden, two of Pharaoh's servants came by. They were in the prison and Joseph was checking on him one day and says, "Hey, you guys look sad. What's the problem with here?" So, well, we've dreamed dreams and there's nobody around here that can interpret them. He said, "Well, tell me the dream. Maybe God will show show me the interpretation." So, the butler says, "Yeah, yeah." He said, "I had dreamed this dream." And he gave the I don't have it written down here, but he gave the dream and and Joseph gave in the interior. Oh, yeah. After three days, he says, "You're going to be restored as a butler." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're going to be restored to your position with with Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And the other guy was was the was the baker. So, the baker says, "Hey, well, that sounds good. Maybe he'll interpret mine." &gt;&gt; So, he gave him his dream. And well, his wasn't the interpretation wasn't as nice. He says, "Yeah, yeah. in three days your head's going to be removed from you and the birds are going to whatever like that you're basically you're going to be a dead man &gt;&gt; and then Joseph asked the butler he says when you get to before Pharaoh tell him about me I'm stuck here &gt;&gt; and I have done nothing wrong &gt;&gt; and so the butler he was restored to his position and forgot all about Joseph &gt;&gt; but then there came the time when Pharaoh had a dream &gt;&gt; he got his astrologers and all of his other magicians whatever ever. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh he told him the dream and uh oh, we don't we don't know, you know. And so then the brother says, "Hey, when you had me in prison, there was a guy in the prison there and he interpreted my dream for for me." And it came across just like like you he had told me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, let's go get him. So they took Joseph. They he had to put he had to they had to dress him up as a priest. They had to jay build his hair, put um clean clothes on him and then he was ushered in before Pharaoh and Pharaoh told him the dream and and and so the dream was given to him twice. One of them you got seven years when the cows would be nice and fat and everything like that and then all of a sudden there'd be seven years and all of a sudden the cattle are just going to be skinnier than skinny. And then there was another seven there was another rice another was another crop of corn nice big rich you know taste tasty ones and then seven years after that it looked I mean blasted with mildew and dust and everything else &gt;&gt; and so Pharaoh or so Joseph interpreted these dreams. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh began to realize if a man can interpret dreams by God this is an important person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he made Joseph um second in command, if you will, of all of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then he he he gave him a a wife of one of the other priests. And so then he started having his kids and settle down. And in some regard, in some ways, Joseph probably forgot the dreams. But when all of a sudden his brothers came because they needed food, &gt;&gt; when they bowed before him, the dream came back to Joseph. &gt;&gt; Yes. and said this is how God is going to fulfill the dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he had given to me. He had to go, excuse the expression, he had to go through hell to get to where God needed him to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able to fulfill what God had given him the dreams of. &gt;&gt; Right? And we do not know what we have to what we have gone through or are going through in order to get us to the place where we can rest in what God has called us to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet. When I was when I was in the Baptist church, I was a sinner saved by grace. Emphasis on sinner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Am I a sinner saved by grace?" Yes, I will acknowledge that. But brother Bradom says you're not you're more than just a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; You are a son of God which has been fully restored to your rightful position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a son. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And that it's a it takes a huge transition in thinking to be able to acknowledge and realize what I am in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I brother Brandham in one of his one of his sermons he says you know do you realize if you are a if you are a son of God you were a part of God placed a part of him in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God placed his seed in you that was a part of God that was dwelling in you and that seed of God was supposed to sprout and bring forth the life and the life of that seed is God. So we what what are we to become? We are to become an image. We are becoming manifestation of the very God that we worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's a huge change in in my thought processes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But we have it's it's like when uh okay there's a law of redemption. If if your uncle or whatever like that decides to have favor with you and so he goes down to the guy that you sold yourself to and he says, "Hey, I want to I'm going to set my my my c my my nephew free." Okay. So, well, how much do I owe you to do that? Well, it will cost you so much. All of the requirements fell upon the one doing the redeeming, &gt;&gt; not on the one being redeemed. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Once that person was redeemed, he was free. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was free to go back to his to his house. He was free to have his village or his his yard, his his his plot of land. He was free to go back to his wife and his kids. He was free. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was no restrictions on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to be going back to? We're supposed to be going back to Eden. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are supposed to be going back to what we were in God before there was the fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything Adam lost as a result of the fall has been fully restored to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's huge. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Adam was first formed, he was a part of God. God took a part of himself. He created Adam. Adam in first part he was he was on a theophony form. Eventually God took that theophony form and brought it to the brought it to earth and he gave him rulership over the earth. &gt;&gt; We also are to have rulership over the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say well how does this work? Well if I look at when when you look at the life of a prophet a prophet not only delivers the messages of God his life is an example to the people. when what God because of the sins of the people Isaiah had to walk naked for three years. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I would find that embarrassing. &gt;&gt; Um but then you look at Ezekiel, Ezekiel had to lay on one side for 300 and something days and then he had to lay on the other side for another 400 days or whatever and and he could only drink so much water and the food that he got to eat had to be mixed with with manure. &gt;&gt; I would find that distasteful. &gt;&gt; Yes. But he was an example to the people of what they were going to go through. The example of the judgment God was going to bring upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet to tell us who we are. But and when I began to relate to that, you know, the life that he lived is for us to emulate. &gt;&gt; He I see in his life what I am to become. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the first person that I can look at that I believe came to adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But God had to try him. When you look at brother Bam's life, he was a renegade. I mean, he he would he would have been in prison for murder if if he God had not intervened. He got there was a time when his his wife and children were taken from him and he just wanted to commit suicide. But God had placed a gift in him. But eventually when when brother Brandham he over time he began to realize because God showed him visions he says well this is how God speaks to prophets and therefore he understood who he was in that regard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when God began to reveal the secrets of the heart then he began to understand well now this is also this was a furtherance of his ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In 1960 brother Brandon Re looked at all the visions God had given to him and realized we're at the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's when he preached the church ages. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's when God spoke to him and says, "Now look at Malachi 4." &gt;&gt; Then he began, in my opinion, he began to understand he was the messenger to this age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When when I listened to Brother Rad's earlier years, he had high regards for Billy Graham. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He and I and I can go back and I can substantiate now if you want, but he he thought that Billy Graham was to be the messenger to the age. He says, "Look at," he says, "You look at John the Baptist. There was no miracles, but he preached the word." Well, look at Billy Graham. He There's no miracles, but he's preaching the word. And that's how Brother Bradom tied that that together. But yet, God had a different plan. &gt;&gt; God needed a man totally under his control. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to come to the place in his life and relationship with Jesus Christ where he literally rested in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could stand. He said, "You know, the the the the gift that I have is my ability to get myself out of the way &gt;&gt; so he can use me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, he gets up there and then and and all of a sudden, God takes possession of his body and and and God speaks through him and tells the person in in the prayer line. So like this is this this this and then Brother Brad shakes his head and he says, "Is what he said? Is that true? I have to listen to the tapes because I don't know what was said." &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, but then over time, God changed it over where brother Brandham, even though he had yield himself to the spirit of God in him, yet now all of a sudden he was still in possession of his faculties. He he could listen. He could he could understand. Even though God was using him, he he we he did not go totally blank for lack of a better way of putting it. But see, then when we get to the church age, when we get to the seals, brother Brandham says when the when the when the when the when the seventh angel begins to sound, he says the mystery of God's to be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he he said he he said the seals could not be opened until the till the church ages had finished. &gt;&gt; Right? And so that and so he says the seventh angel's message began at the seals. telling and what was the seal he's trying to tell the bride this is who you are &gt;&gt; we had brother Brandham brother Brandham in different places he says you know Jesus Christ never performed a miracle he says it was the god in him &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says I've never performed a miracle either I was just standing there when he did it &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he learned to he learned to take his body and yield it so to God so God could use him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I some people had somebody had mentioned we were in different place and somebody Oh, yeah. When you look at Jesus Christ, he was all human. &gt;&gt; Well, in one sense, yes, he was. But the other sense, it was God dwelling in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; And I'd always wondered, how did God deal with the humanity that he dwelt in? &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ was every bit man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He had self-will. He had desires like any other man has desires. He wanted to have a family. He wanted to have a house. He wanted to have clothes. He wanted to have But but but brother Banner made an interesting statement. He says Jesus Jesus Christ took his will and gave it to the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He totally submitted. He He did not exercise his will. &gt;&gt; He totally gave himself to God and let God do what God wanted to do through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like in and sometimes, you know, when when you look at self, so some decisions are easy. Tells his disciples, you know, we have to go down to Jericho. Oh man, Jericho's a long walk. It's kind of hot out. What do you Why are we going to go down to Jer? It's hotter down there. You realize it's hotter down there. Well, God has told me to go to Jericho, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll go to Jericho. Well, there was this short little man had to climb up in a tree. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because that was God's seed. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Jesus gets under the tree, looks up. Hey, Zakius, come on down. I'm going to have lunch with you today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. You know, and then there's another there was a blind man there. And all of a sudden, he heard Jesus was walking by and and and he began to cry out. And I think brother Bad made mention of the fact nobody Jesus Christ could have not have heard his boy his cry in his ears. But yet there was a cry that reached him &gt;&gt; and then they asked Barnabas to come and and what Jesus asked what would you like? I would like to have my sight back. &gt;&gt; Fine. Jesus prayed his sight came back. &gt;&gt; Amen. because there was another person that God through through the min through Jesus Christ had to minister to because that was God's child. Amen. Another time he said we have to go by way of Samaria. Oh man. Hey, they hate us. They're Samaritans. We're Jew. We We don't have any relationship. No, this is not a good idea, boy. But Jesus says, "No, we're going." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, if you insist, I guess we'll go. They go down there. They went in to try and get some food. And meanwhile, Jesus was sitting there and then this this lady came in for to get some water. And all of a sudden, God Jesus began to speak to the lady and then he contacted like brothers, he contacted her spirit and realized what her problem was. Go get your husband. Well, I don't have one. Well, you had however many. The one you're living with now is not yours. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But see, she was a seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God needed to reach her and the only way he could reach her was through the body he lived in in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But see when we go and go about the our lives that we live and and interact with the pe different people, do you understand that God through you is trying to reach out to his seed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's trying to reach out to that which was a part of him from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only vessels he can use is you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are his hands. You're his feet. You're his mouth, his eyes, ears. You God dwells in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he and brother Brandham says he needs the same preeminence in you that he had in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because and because he had total preeminence in Jesus Christ, whatever God wanted to do, he had to use the body that God now dwelt in, we call Jesus Christ. And he had to go here and he had to go there and he had to in order to be able to minister. Right? Would I look at brother Bam? Brother Bam went here and there and stuff like that because here God dwelt in that body &gt;&gt; to fulfill God's will for the lives of the people that he was going to interact with. Brother Bham talks about he oh what you see up here in the on the platform this is nothing. He says I'm I'll be at home minding my own business and God will say I want you to be at a certain certain city at a certain certain time on a certain certain corner and and this other person is going to come by. This is how they will look. I want you to to take them. This is the problem they have. I want you to minister to them and hight tail it out of town. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, he gets there. He gets to the city. He gets in the street corner. He's there at the time God had appointed and all of a sudden the one he talked about was going to come, the person came, brother Brandham talked to them and he doesn't relate a whole lot on that. But he prayed for the person and all of a sudden when the person turned around to thank brother Brandham, Brother Brandham was gone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't about brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's not about us. &gt;&gt; Right. If we could ever get the come to the realization it's not about who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's about who he is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not what we do for God. It's what we allow him to do through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's nothing to do with us. &gt;&gt; We have to learn to totally yield ourselves to him so he can accomplish what he wants to accomplish through our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; We go and we begin we begin to We understand it in everything that God has timing. God has a timing for everything. In in Galatians 4, he says, "But when the fullness of time has come, God sent forth a son, made every woman made under the law for the purpose to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's to happen at this day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. And because you are sons, God sent forth the spirit of a son into your hearts where you begin to understand God is your father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My parents gave me the body I live in. I was not I but I was born here by the will of God &gt;&gt; because I God had ordained for me to be alive and in in in in this body in this in this time because he has a purpose for me going &gt;&gt; Amen. Um I never would have chosen India to be a missionary to. We went there totally ignorant of what I was getting into the middle of. Um 20 years ago, India was a lot different than the way it is now. I mean, yeah, I won't go into details, but God allowed me to become part of something. We we helped build some churches, but later, but what we have done, what we've concentrated on the most in the last probably 15 years is taking the messages of brother Brandham and having them translated from from English into the Telugu language. Right now we have 380 messages which are available in the Telugu language to the &gt;&gt; good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I went two years ago Yeah. Um I was curious how if what we had started is it going to continue? Is there enough momentum in what I had started &gt;&gt; through God's help? &gt;&gt; Is it is it is it going to continue on or is it going to dry up and just go away? Um there's enough momentum the translation work still is going ongoing. Then I was curious the churches that I had worked with are they financially stable and the other one is of the messages that have been translated how available are they to the people that speak that language? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we the different outlying churches we went to we saw they had books translated into tele. They were available to the people that could read. If you had a cell phone, you can download from from um Cloverdale on the web, you can download everything which is available in the Telugu language. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's available and and as the children had grown in grown over the years, now they they have jobs and so the the children of the ministers now have are able to contribute to the church. So that the church is basically it's financially stable because of of you know God has has allowed that to be there. &gt;&gt; Good. Amen. &gt;&gt; But any but we have but we have my my thing is is God I can look back in my life and I can see where God has directed me. I I I had not chosen this path at all. In fact, a lot of ways I I never would have. I mean I had my own ideas of what I wanted to do and stuff. But yet I can look back and I can see the hand of God in the things which were doing. And I marvel that God was has been able to keep me. He's able to supply for me. He is able to lead and guide me in spite of myself to be able to to accomplish I think what he has wanted me to do over time. But I I began to study the the uh since I'm going to be ministering at Freddy Grace Church probably about five or six services, I wanted a series &gt;&gt; and to come up with a new ser sermon. Yeah, it's difficult. And so I started studying the tabernacle and so I'm trying to inter relate to the different ways constructed. There's a brother though that I was listening to a couple nights ago and he took the tabernacle, the example of the tabernacle and and he he he brought a thought process that I never would have thought of. He says, you know, when when a person and he basically is following the the um the plan of salvation, if you will, we have to go justification, sanctification, baptism, Holy Spirit. Anyway, he says, you know, when a sinner when a sinner wants to wants to approach God, he has to go to the gate. It's on the east. And when with God, everything's in type. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. And so the gate that they have have to enter into is on the east. &gt;&gt; Anyway, but in order for you to accept Jesus Christ, in order for you to get into the into the outer courtyard, you have to bring a sacrifice. You have to you have to acknowledge that you are a sinner. You have to acknowledge that the grace of God that has provided sacrifice for you and only and you offer the sacrifice and you identify with the sacrifice are you allowed into the courtyard. Mhm. &gt;&gt; And he says, "When we when we gather together in church," Yeah. It's a group effort. We all gather together, we sing songs, we interact with each other, we fellowship with each other, all this other kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; And you have to go through a process. You have to go through justification. You justification is acknowledging that you are a sinner. Yes. And then watch the sacrifice that that you had brought. You have to watch it die. You have to watch it be consumed upon the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're in the courtyard, the courtyard when you look at it, the the walls are about seven feet tall and it's all white around which speaks of being a righteousness. Okay? And so when you're in the courtyard, God views you as righteous because you are you you have come to a relationship with God where God regards you as as righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if if you are a priest, you have to go through a process. You have to be washed and you you have to be cleansed. You have to have blood sprinkled on you before you can enter into the next into the into the next next court which is which is inside the the tabernacle itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The tabernacle is um 9 ft no almost 14t tall. It's double the height. &gt;&gt; So when you're in the outside you look you can see the tabernacle there and it looks uglier than ugly. I mean um they say in corpus skins or something like that anyway but you when you enter into there it's a very limited group that goes into the holy place and there you have different obligations and different things that you want to go through but the thing that struck me when the brother was was ministering he says you know what God is wanting us to do is to go behind the last veil. Amen. &gt;&gt; There you only go behind the last veil individually. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't go in there as a group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you enter into that, you enter into the very presence of God himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And at that point, that that is the journey that God is trying to get us to go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Often times, yeah, we sit in the outer court. Yeah. That's fine. as as as as believers in Jesus Christ, we are kingdom of priests. Okay? So, we enter into the holy place. But to make that last veil, you have it. It takes a it takes a it takes a full commitment for one, but also when you get into there, it's not about you. It's all about him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. When you're in there, it's like, okay, when I look at the ark, how could they put how could they store enough food to feed all of those animals for a year? &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a lot of food. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but I you take this for whatever you want. When Moses was up on the mountain, he was there for 40 days. &gt;&gt; He didn't eat. He didn't drink. What sustained him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was in God's presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. In God's presence, he takes care of it all. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All the physical needs that you have in your body, it's already taken care of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I look at the ark in the same kind of way. That may be all wrong, but anyway. &gt;&gt; But when we when we get to the place where we go behind the last veil, we are entering into the very presence of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. But to do that the thing that you have to be able to understand is it's all everything you do with God is by faith. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When we to go behind the last veil, there has to be a relationship between you and you and God that that allows you to go behind that veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The high priest is the only one that could go behind the veil. I think in one place the scripture says we enter in behind the veil through the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So you have to be in Christ. You have to have a relationship. It can't be a Sunday morning social function. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, there has to come to the place where God is a reality to you. And when you go behind the last veil, you're entering into the very presence of God himself. And that that's when you can begin to commune with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it's an open communion. It's it's not a, you know, praying, I hope God he'll hear my voice. No, you're actually there in his presence. And when you're in his presence and and you and and and &gt;&gt; when you when you and how can I say this David, God ordained him to become a king. He had to go through a process to get to be king. Mhm. &gt;&gt; U Joseph had to go through a process in order for the visions of the the dreams that God had given him. Brother Bradom talks about us as the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says we have to come to the place we have to come to a place where we are literally resting in God. To me that talks about going behind the last veil. &gt;&gt; Yes. I go behind the last veil and I am totally dependent upon him for my life because he that life that presence is what has to sustain me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when I when I it's it's not always easy but there's a desire in my heart to get to the place where I can so dwell in his presence until I no longer am concerned about me. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm just concerned about what he would desire for me to do for him. Okay. Brother Venom says he swore by himself. Um he said he says listen I'm going to say say something. Look he said faith is unconscious. Amen. You believe it. I've learned but that over the years of travel around the world and seeing people in all different walks of life. He said but faith is unconscious. You got faith and you don't even know it. Yes. So to the ability to enter in behind the veil, you have the ability, you have the faith to do this, but you have to will to do the will of God. Amen. But he goes on here, Jesus Christ, no matter if he was in a storm, the gale is knocking the boat from one side to the other or he's standing in the face of a mess of demons, if he was hanging anywhere, never moved him, he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be. Why? He was simply unconscious of fear. anything around him. That's right. Whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen. He knowed it was going to happen because God said so. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, I wonder if I prayed through. I wonder if I fasted long enough. I wondered this or that." He just walked right on unconscious. That's right. He believed that God said he believed what God said was truth and the words must be fulfilled. He know that his life was to fulfill them. That's right. And so I look at that and I I look at that we should we I believe we should be able to come to a relationship with God &gt;&gt; where we so trust in him. We realize that everything God's word will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if we believe it to be impossible or any anything else. No. I mean you can look at what's going on in our government. &gt;&gt; Why is Trump president? &gt;&gt; Not that I'm necessarily I'm okay. Stay with the way of politics. But we have to begin to understand. I believe God put him there for a reason. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Why are they going to elect a Muslim to be that to be the mayor of New York City, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That is unheard of, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; New York City is the center of capitalism. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This guy is a communist. &gt;&gt; Capitalism does not go with with with communism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, these are as different as you know, black is as from white, &gt;&gt; right? It's going to be interesting Tuesday. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have to understand God has a plan. He will fulfill that plan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what we say. It doesn't matter what we think. It doesn't even matter how the people vote to a large extent because God has a plan. God will fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But see, we God is going to fulfill his word in us. In order for him to fulfill his word in us, he has to have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; He had the preeminence in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God took his Jesus Christ took his will in the flesh and gave it to God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So he never did his will. He always did the will of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The place it came to where where he did not want to do the will of the father was at Gethsemane. He said, "Father, if there's any way at all, can we just change the plan?" He says, "But not what I will, but you will." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It it it it it uh when I thought about that, in fact, Jesus Christ had to had to choose to go to the cross. &gt;&gt; To me, that's huge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He knew what awaited him there. I mean he had already the angels had come down minister to him and all this other stuff but he still had to make he himself had to make the choice &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; to go on the cross to die for our sins &gt;&gt; to me that's huge &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; the greatest love it could be expressed to humanity was Jesus on that cross &gt;&gt; amen so he so that's right he believed what God said was true the words must be filled he knew that his life was to fulfill do we understand what we are to fulfill. We are coming to the place where it talks about the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; That has to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are his body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Um brother Random another place says the bride has to come to adoption. &gt;&gt; Means the same thing we're saying is the same as God himself saying it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And okay. Um, if God is not the one in control, we would say an awful lot of things which we shouldn't be saying. Sure, you know, hey, be nice to have a nice red Ferrari out there, you know, you know, but okay, you know, that's I don't think that's God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another place I was at and it was hot and they say, "Oh, yeah. I'm praying for snow." And they and they looked at me and said, "No, no. I I'm just using it for an example. I don't expect snow this afternoon." It was 105 outside. I don't expect snow today. Okay. But but here again, but you you be have one of the things I have learned in my life. What I what comes out of my mouth to a large extent determines what I expect. Sure. And you get older, you have aches and pains and other issues. And if I concentrate on the issues, the aches and the pains, you know, I get up and oh man, oh yeah, I overworked yesterday. Oh man, this hurts. Oh, bad. It's terrible. Oh man, what should I do today? Oh my Oh, it's going to be a horrible horrible day. I just feel Oh, I just ache so butt. You've spoken now. Enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But you can go look, you can go and you can take it and begin with all the aches and pains. It says, "The sun has risen. God has given me another day to enjoy his presence." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in that I rejoice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I spoke it. Now I enjoy expect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, it it's it's it's that simple. You know, some people say, "Oh, yeah, brother Brandham, you know, he spoke the storm out of existence. He spoke the squirrels into existence, all these other things." And, you know, oh, that was fine for him, but what about us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know. I was visiting with my brother in Arkansas. We were in downtown, wherever this town was, and uh a tornado was coming, and I looked and it was head right down the street where we were at. I figured, uh oh, I looked around. Ain't nothing to hang on to. Says, Lord, just let it go around us. It's interesting. It went, it split. It went around us. We joined and kept going. Amen. Was that my spoken word? &gt;&gt; I don't know. All I know is God honored it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were in Jamaica once and they had a there was a hurricane. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there was hurricanes they called. There was a hurricane heading right for where we were at in in Jamaica. And we all were praying. We said, "Lord, just take it. Instead of it going this way, have it make a sharper turn." And we had just said, "Amen." And all of a sudden, you watch the news and it took a sharp turn. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We got some rain, we got some wind, but if it had gone like it had, I mean, this last one hit Jamaica. I mean, it devastated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, that could have been us. &gt;&gt; That could have been us. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But here again, we we have within us the ability. We have the we have within us the rights to become and to manifest a God that is dwells in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he has to have the preeminence. It cannot be us. It has to be him guiding and directing our lives. It has to be him speaking through us. It has to be by his leadership and his guidance that we begin to manifest the God that is within us. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's not about us. It's about him. It It's not about what we do. It's what we allow to do through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know I' I've spoken this many times about Habacook and people probably get tired of that, but when I looked at the life of Habacook, he was a they God had said, "I'm going to bring destruction upon the city of Jerusalem." And Habacook, in my opinion, was fearful for his life. And so Habac began to pray and and u and uh well in Habac what two and three he says he says that for the vision is yet for an appointed time but yet at the end speak it will not lie though ter will will come. Behold his soul which is lifted up is not is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith. And there it talks about a person if a person who relies upon himself. He says I live in a fortress. I can control my outcome. I can control my life. I can I don't need God. So God says, "Fine. I won't help you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wish you luck. But it came down to Habacook. And it talks about Habacook. It talks about Habacook. He It talks about having a faith between the creature and the creator where the creature is totally reliant upon his creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. where he has where where God has total preeminence in leading and guiding Habacook's life. &gt;&gt; Where Habacook would no longer rely upon himself to see him through the battles which are coming. He would rely upon the God that had promised to him to take him through what was coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I read that, I I I I asked the Lord, I said, "Will you if I put my trust in you like you've asked Habacook, will you will you watch over me and take me through what's coming also?" because I we don't know about tomorrow. &gt;&gt; I I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But God spoke to me and he says, "Yeah, if you will trust me like Habacook, like I asked Habacook to trust me." &gt;&gt; Says, "I will see you through whatever is coming." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And since that point on, I have been at rest. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I know it's not about me. It's not about me controlling the fear. I I have no control over the government. I have no control over the weather. I have no control over what's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. God does. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God, if I will, if I will trust him, he will take care of me and whatever is coming. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And to me, this is what God is trying to get us to get to. He's trying to get us to the place as Christians, we no longer rely upon us. We rely upon him. &gt;&gt; Brother Vanam another place said, "Yeah, he says sickness will come and this will come and this will come. Will we all have troubles and trials?" Sure, we will. It doesn't negate them. It doesn't make all from this point on it's smooth sailing down the road. No, no, no, no. You look at David's life. You look at Joseph's life. It wasn't smooth sailing for either one of those. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But God watched over them. He kept them. He guided them through everything which was going. You look at other examples in the Bible and we find people we find other people. Why why was why did Barnabas have to be born have to be have to go blind so Jesus could heal him? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There was another one at uh I think they they brought somebody I think it was brought him to Jesus. This boy Yeah. This boy was born blind &gt;&gt; and the disciples says who sinned? This man. How could this guy &gt;&gt; unborn? How could he sin? Come on. Give me a break. Was it him sin or or was his parents that sinned? Why he was born blind? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, for neither one." But see, the glory of God could be made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This guy had to be born blind. He had to grow up blind so that Jesus Christ could come and give him his sight so God could be glorified. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's totally that that that most of us that doesn't compute, you know, &gt;&gt; but God has a plan and we don't know it. We do not understand what he is trying to accomplish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All we know is that we have to sub. We have to learn to submit to what his will is &gt;&gt; and allow him to lead and guide our lives and then rest in whatever situation we find ourselves trusting God that God will fulfill his plan for our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam had to come to that place in his life and I believe we have to come to that place in our life. We are at the end. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. That's my opinion. We we have arrived. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The end is not future. No, we're in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; What'll happen between now and then, you know, when the when the rapture when we get the changing of our body? I don't know. &gt;&gt; I have my opinion and I've talked to other ministers and they have different opinions. So, I keep my opinion to myself and let them have their opinion and we just get along fine. Okay. nothing to argue about because we don't know. God fulfills his word by bringing it to pass, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So when they ask me, "Is this going to be or is this going to be?" I says, "Well, when it comes to pass, I'll let you know." &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because that's the only way we will know. That's the only interpretation of of God's plan is when all when he actually brings it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I but like I I try to mention here that where brother Brown talks about that he says he he says a Christian's faith is based solidly upon rest. &gt;&gt; That's right. A Christian is not tossed about. A Christian doesn't run from place to place. A Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things. A Christian rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all over. It was all finished for a believer in Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And let's just pray. That's right. Heavenly Father, we gather ourselves together this morning and just Lord thankful that you thankful Lord for the way that you've been here and the way that you guided my thoughts and the words which I've spoken and I trust Lord that what was spoken Lord was what you would have spoken because Lord you in my opin opinion and what you've impressed upon me we have to come to the place where we totally rely upon you and trust you and rest in you know knowing that that You are you are the one that controls the future. You control my future. Yes. Or the future of everyone that is here. And Lord, we have to be we have to be able to come in my opinion, we have to Lord, we I we have to come to the place, Lord, where we actually will so have faith in you that regardless of what happens, we know that you're in control, Lord. You're leading and guiding our lives. So take this thought Lord, present it into the hearts of the people and help us to come to the place Lord where we we go behind that last veil. We see it in your presence and are totally at rest realizing that you are the one who is going to control and take care of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a plan for each and every one of our lives. And Lord, we know that you will fulfill your plan for our lives. We need to rest in that. Grant this, Lord. I ask it in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Appreciate brother enjoyed that message. Enjoy the truth of that message. Amen. The Lord speaking and knowing that that was his word and encouragement. Amen. Something to rest upon. realize that a lot of what uh brother Noah uh brought to us today is things that we know in our hearts and things that we realize and have read and heard preached. But you know, sometimes it just takes something like that to bring back your remembrance. We fret and we worry and we uh strive over things that just really don't have any significance, right? &gt;&gt; Because we don't have control over them anyway. Lord has control over them. It's up to him. It's what he does. Amen. He talks about the present. You know, that's scriptural. Bible tells us he puts them up. He sets them down. It's up to him that does it. Amen. Whatever God does, that's that's what we rest in and believe in and trust. I look at it and sometimes it grates against my spirit because I don't want to see it go that way, but I want it to be according to his will. Amen. So, that's a that's a part of my coming under the subjection of the will of the Lord. Amen. Because it's not happening arbitrarily, saints. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; all this stuff is not just happening. This is not just going on. It's it's not because, like you even said, the vote of the people. It's because it's God doing it. God orchestrating it. God's will. And let it be happen whatever God's will is because that's what our desire should be anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is. And I know that God will make as he does for all of us work everything out for our good &gt;&gt; because we love him. Amen. We don't have just some passing affinity for him. We don't just have some love that we say a filio because he's done something good for us. No, we love him regardless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "If he were to send me to hell, if I go the way I am now, I'll still love him." &gt;&gt; Why? Because that love doesn't change. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Doesn't change because where you are. Doesn't change because who you are. Doesn't change because of circumstances. Nothing changes it. If it's the love of God, it's settled. It's finished. It's unconditional. So no matter where you are, what's going on in life, you still love him. That love does not change, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that's why brother Ram said, "He cast me into hell. I'd still if I went the way he said, if I go the way I go now, I would still love him." Why? Because it's not going to change, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's God's. And that's what we trust in. That's what we rest in. That's what we believe in because he's working it all out for our good. May not go the way we like it to go. We may not go the way we want it to go. It's like I've said many times, saints, we pray all often. We pray that God would do something or God would heal somebody or God would move over here or God would let &gt;&gt; and then God's moving to work something and but he's not doing it the way that we envisioned he was going to do it. And because it's not the way we thought it was going to be, we totally miss God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's over here trying to work out your prayer and you're missing it because it's not done the way you think it should be done. Forget about your attitudes. Forget about your opinions, your thoughts, actions. Let God do it the way he wants to do it. Just believe and say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it. Praise the Lord. Can we put on there six All is Will. I'm going to put on the screen what I think we probably all know this anyway, &gt;&gt; but uh from the very beginning of Brother No's message, this song came to my heart and I wanted to sing it. Amen. But there's some verses in there that's not in the book. It's 650 in the book, but the verses aren't in here. And I love singing the verses. Amen. I love the chorus to this song, too. And it speaks so much to what Brother Null was telling us, ministering to us just now. And u I uh I just want us to sing it. Can we sing this? Praise the Lord. We'll sing the verses, too, but we'll have it up on the screen for you. Let's sing this. All is well. All is well. We have heard the message shalom and all is well. Well, there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner veil. So rest little bride rest for all is well. Well, there's a story in the Bible of Elijah, the Junomite woman and her son. The woman found favor with God, so he gave her a son. But while working in the field, the little boy had died. But the woman's faith never failed. Even in death, she testified that all is well. Yes, all is well. You believe that today? Yes, all is well. We have heard the message shalom and all is well. Well, there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner veil. So rest, let the bride rest, for all is well. Now things have not worked out like God's people fall cuz we're still here and we're fighting the greatest battle ever fought. [Music] But if we'll have the faith of Abraham, knowing God's word never fails, if we'll trust in him, we'll find that all is well. Yes, all is well. All is well. We have heard the message shalom and all is well. Well, there is a place of perfect rest behind the anger veil. So rest, let her bride rest, for all is well. Can we sing it one more time now? Yes. All is well. All is well. We have heard the message shalom and all is aware. Oh, there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner veil. So rest little a bright rest for all is well. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. That's just a personification of a of a Christian, of a bride's Christian's walk, of their life, of their living. Amen. It's just entering into that presence and living at rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A lot of people talk about entering into his presence in a sanctuary or in a church service, but friend, we should press into that spirit, into that rest every moment of every day of our lives. It should be a constant, persistent, perpetual living. Amen. Of being in God's presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being at rest. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Being at peace. Shalom. Amen. Peace. That's the way that the bride should be living today. At peace. Amen. At rest. Amen. Let me ensure you again and encourage you as brother N just did. God has it all under control. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he promised that he will work it out for our good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what else is there to worry about, to fred over, to be concerned about? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got it all under control. Amen. And I'm so thankful that he does. Praise God. Amen. I'm encouraged to hear and and and I'm thankful that Brother Null and Sister Shirley are going to get to go back to India this year. I know he had expressed to me a year or so ago or whenever it was uh wanted to go back. Didn't look like they were going to uh didn't know he was praying and had a desire of the Lord just one more time. But Amen. I'm very thankful, very happy. Uh as much as you can do with modern technology and cameras and videos and being uh one place and watching in another things like that, there's no substitute. There's absolutely no substitute for being in person. There just isn't. I mean, that's why that's why the Bible tells us to forsake not the assembling of ourselves together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. One day, we're going to all gather together under that same banner. Amen. Go home to be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking for our loved ones at any time. You know, Brother Null, &gt;&gt; when it's something like that that you talk about, uh, and I have my feelings, my opinions, my thoughts about, if I express that to my congregation, I always make sure and let them know. Um, this is what I think. &gt;&gt; This is how I feel. Amen. This is my opinion and how I believe it's going to be. I always preface it to make sure they know. I do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But, but I also say, but I derive my feeling from scripture. I don't just come up with something out of the blue. I I derive my opinion and my feeling based on what I believe the scripture and the message is saying. So, amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, there's there's context to it, too. Not just this is just my opinion. But as he said, there's so many of these things uh that we don't know. Amen. It's going to happen when it happens, when it comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Uh I'll let you know if I'm the first to know. If you're the first know, you can let me know. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, it's going to happen. I a lot of people talk about is California going to sink before the bride goes to rapture after, you know. Oh, brother Bradam never says. &gt;&gt; We don't know. Amen. Nobody knows. I have my opinion, but I don't know. Praise the Lord. But we know it's going to happen. That's the main thing. Amen. We know it is going to happen. Praise the Lord. So, let's stand to our feet if we could. Amen. I'll stop preaching now and um we'll let you be dismissed, but I'm so very thankful to have brother with us.
