amen we're just a little part of it but we are a part of it amen that's the most important thing we may not be but just a small part of it but we are a part of it amen because we're part of him amen my hands are kind of sore from the week and I clapping and started hurting and I just couldn't stop amen I just amen praise the Lord worship Him Anyway praise God thank you Jesus amen he's wonderful Lindy got a text from Sister Shelia this morning she uh had an accident um I believe it was yesterday and uh I could look at the text again but I believe it was yesterday she um had a man uh uh washing machine delivery I think coming to her house shoot anyway she had a misstep off of her steps and her foot her leg went down in between the mobile home and the step and just ripped the skin off her leg and her foot and it's just so very sore right now which I can only imagine I just like to try to cut my finger off this week but I wasn't successful but just rip the skin right off of there so I in just just a little bit I think it's so sore I can only imagine how she feels her leg amen so please remember Sister Sheila in prayer she stayed home the pain is just radiating basically she said from her knee to her foot I just can't walk on it just can't go anywhere not planning to go to work tomorrow so please remember Sister shealy in prayer it's it's it's uh very unpleasant it's hurting her for that that's that's the only actual written prayer request I have here so does anyone else have anything in your heart your request as as we all know the Maui was kind of ridden with fires right now the death toll is 55 people um yeah and they're expecting it to increase so those people those families those the tourists that are trapped and there's been fires in Greece there is a firefighting plane that crashed so those pilots and their families and there was another helicopter cop crash and in California I think so there's all kinds of things going on just right down about the Maui fire so thank you for reminding me Monica I forgotten about to mention that that is an extremely severe situation going on over there and of course as one that had as a family that had visited there um I'll get you a minute as a family had visited there and Lahaina was one of our favorite places uh we enjoyed that place very much and had some really good places to eat and always just so sad to see the devastation of the before and after pictures and of course that burger place that we like I saw uh where it used to be it's gone now two store just beautiful place uh it's it's incredible but beyond the lot the loss of property which can be rebuilt the loss of lives has just been devastating they said that that hurricane offshore that made those winds whip across through there blew that fire across so fast people just couldn't even get out they just they had no place to go some people I heard had to jump into the ocean to get away from it uh it very very severe situation so please remember the families those lost loved ones and all the situations I think that brother Michael's talking about let's remember all those Awards and prayer very sad situation amen praise the Lord it's a children's prayer of course we know how the devil's been trying to fight him so bad amen Zach and Tabitha and Rue throughout the town that was their anniversary this weekend so they're out of town we know for the dentist is going to be out of town Shelia with her situations not with us and I would just miss anyone who's not here when they're not here so um so glad to have everyone that is here today have an unspoken request in your heart and so we do want to remember from Sister Sheila brother Dennis their safe returns act Tabitha Ruth safe return and all traveling mercy so glad to have Michael back thankful the Lord blessed his trip and brought him back this week uh I'm thankful that the Lord blessed us through a good week in York and Lancaster Pennsylvania I we put in a 300 feet of Khmer this week we we tore out we tore out and replaced 300 foot of conveyor this week I can't even begin to elaborate to you what a feat that is uh one conveyor was 123 four feet the other was 177 feet and just to get those things out of there just we cut just to give you a small example we cut on the new conveyor we cut out a part of it to fit the brushes that come in on the tires if you've gone through the car wash you know these little black brushes have come through all the tires um we cut we have to cut the conveyor to make room for those to come in and out and just a strip that's about 10 feet long and about that tall wide and just you know quarter inch thick is about 60 pounds just just that one piece of rail I picked it up after we cut them out pick them up and take them out I could barely pick them up and take them out uh just that so you imagine the rest of that whole thing uh it's it's quite a deal so we uh we were very busy this week but thankful the Lord blessed uh and had a good week we got everything done uh we had some hiccups but the Lord I believe the Lord was there with us and helped us uh to get it done and we actually got it done and finished by five o'clock on Friday I mean we didn't have to stay late Friday so so God's been good so I thank him for that let's stand to our feet if we could and then we'll take these nieces of the Lord in prayer request Michael with you thanks for these request forms that's all right seriously father Lord God would come to you just as every time before knowing and face that you're going to listen to what we have to ask knowing that you knew before the foundation of the world that we would approach you with these leads father Yes God Amen the almighty God that you are that you can and haven't met those in the Lord we ask that you would be you with those who are sick or injured Lord Jesus or sister or that little Miss just Lord God the pain that she's in for me may you visit her

we ask amen praise the Lord you could be seated if you like while Michael was praying there uh I hope it's okay buddy I felt to have Joel come up and hang himself [Music] Lord Jesus father my precious grandson Lord is standing here in need of prayer Lord he knows you enough and he loves you enough and he has enough confidence in you Lord to raise his hand in service even a nine-year-old father to raise his hand in service and ask him requests of prayer Lord from this Congregation of Believers father that you would touch him and heal him Lord Satan again this is a great boy he is a wonderful grandson he is so smart he is so talented because of that I know more than anything Satan is trying to take him from us but in Jesus Christ's name Satan I rebuke you you have no right on this boy you cannot touch him and in Jesus Christ's name as a body of Believers we rebuke you off of him in Jesus Christ's name Lord God may you touch him heal him may your healing virtues Lord flow father through him from the top of his head to the souls of his feet to take these things from him father the stomach issue or this itching is scratching this picking father in the name of Jesus Christ my grandson is healed right now by your stripes we give you thanks and praise for it Lord now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray praise the Lord how many Believes In Miracles yes amen amen praise the Lord Jesus got a praise reporter brother Danny it says and we some of us have kind of experienced this to a point before as well brother Danny says I took my car on Thursday to the missions and my check engine light was on and you know they won't even touch you if it's on I didn't have any choice because it's due on the 15th when I got up to have my car checked before they could connect the adapter my engine light went off and my car passed you believe in miracles amen God is good give all the glory and praise uh as I was surprised but knowing that what the Lord was doing amen and so praise the Lord God is good isn't it amen wonderful that's such a wonderful testimony amen and sister uh Matisse has a testimony she'd like to give as well that happened to me I also two brothers I don't know why why is I came to the Lord in 1970 free and got the Holy Ghost in 74. and and uh or maybe it was 75 anyhow that was about 14 months later and um I saw all these years is what 2023 I have never gotten this and I just want to share it with you because it's it's changed my life and blessed me so much I heard a testimony of a man who had an open Vision he he saw his Bible a Bible and it was just electric with blue lights and everything and he realized it was a sword and he took it and he just level the mountains and then he looked at it and he saw a cross on it and it was just blowing and he was getting so big and he he thought is that the sun is it what and he looked and it's just getting bigger and brighter and then all of a sudden you felt the Bible start to go boom boom boom boom boom boom and he he thought what is that is it a drama what is that and then he started to see the Bible started to vibrate and he opened the Bible and there was a big heart inside how many times have we heard brother Brown say well I heard it I don't know they talked he said I used to think that God was angry with me and Jesus Christ loved me and I came to find out that Jesus is the very Heart Of God Amen that just blessed me so much no wonder when he comes and you get a revelation you feel that closeness of heart no wonder praise the Lord I just never connected them before amen praise the Lord amen when you have the Revelation that he is not chopped up into three pieces but he is one God changes everything about it the worst speaker than that yeah amen I'm thankful that uh that I can realize the Lord makes me realize so that we're that I'm protected no matter what even all the terrible things that you see in the news of whatever but even for the drivers and nature every little thing we're always uh protected and amen accomplishing just the little things that we do Hallelujah so it's through the day amen it would still be safe in here yes sir brother that is so true when we were in York last Monday there was severe thunderstorm warnings and a tornado warning for our area it stormed and the wind blew but all the bad stuff stayed away from us it didn't come to us I know that so God keeps us safe amen I don't know how many times too I can tell you and you know my testimony and the motion sickness and all that and flying uh how many times it happened two or three times again on this trip where Pilots would come up and say okay we're getting ready to get I'm I'm instructed to the uh the flight attendants to take their seats and buckle your seat belts and we're getting ready to hit some turbulence and it comes is going it's going where's this turbulence and it hardly ever does it materialize and especially not to the level we did that yesterday coming into Tucson he had them sit he had the flight attendants take their seat way out of Wilcox uh there's going to be a real bumpy coming in it wasn't hard there was hardly any bumps at all one or two maybe little things went landed that was it amen so even the pilots that come people that think they're experts that know all this stuff and read their instruments reminds me of that story where uh that family's daughter was dying and the doctor told her she was dying and uh brother random came and prayed for her and they were worshiping and praising God and the nurse came in and checked and she was getting worse the girl was getting worse and the parents were just celebrating worshiping and they looked at the parents they said what are you so happy about what what are you thanking God for what are you worshiping about what are you so excited about this girl's dying can't you see your instruments are failing she's she's she's going she's going to die and then dad looked at her and said young lady we love you and appreciate all that you do for us and everything that you do here as a nurse it's it's quite admirable he said but let me tell you something you are trained to read all those instruments and all that stuff and you know what all of it does he said but we're trained to believe God and God says she's healed by Jesus Christ and that's all and she was healed that's that's what they know all they know is to read their instruments all they know is to look at this but we know a God who is greater than all that amen praise the Lord I believe I believe God I believe the tornado could head right for your head and come and go up over and down amen yeah yeah I believe that absolutely The Impossible is possible with him yes praise the Lord one more song before we change your other serves number 151 I am one of them praise the Lord and one of them thank Jesus one of them praise the Lord there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all the remain with the fire that fell at Pentecost which tend to make them clean it is I love you [Music] oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them though these people may not learn to be normals baptized in Jesus name is Hallelujah [Music] they were gathered in the upper room oh [Music] [Music] I Wanna Live here [Applause] [Music] all my brothers [Music] I Wanna Live amen oh Hallelujah [Music] [Music] but my brother see this but I think that will end your heart from sin it will start the doorbells ringing and we'll keep your soul a plane it is burning now within my heart Oh Glory Hallelujah I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of you amen yes oh I'm so glad that I can say I want more time now yes foreign amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I'm one of them oh thank you Jesus All Saints just like I said earlier I I give it up a long time ago if I didn't know I was one of him one of them that I belong to him praise the Lord Jesus oh aren't you aren't you thankful aren't you thankful you belong to him aren't you thankful you're one of them praise God oh what the Lord Jesus does for us friend amen it's beyond understanding amen but thank God he keeps us continuing to press this battle every obstacle that gets thrown in our way we just get that much tighter that much closer amen God's tired and not in my heart and every time there's a poll that knot just gets tighter amen you ever tied a knot you try to pull that knot doesn't give you just I know so many times I get frustrated you get a you get you uh your shoelace and a knot you try to pull on it pull it just makes it that much tighter just that much harder to get loose amen the devil can keep pushing he can keep pulling friend but all that does is make my knot tighter it just makes me hold on that much more amen praise the Lord he's a liar the truth's not in him thank God we belong to the Lord Jesus amen let's stand to our feet if we could we'll change the order of the service now God bless you appreciate each one being here today glad to have Gabriel back with us amen good to see you all the men buddy amen praise the Lord you ever had a rough go over there for a little bit but he stayed true amen the Lord helped him and blessed himself it's a testing time when a family goes through those things but it's also a glorious time when God reveals himself and brings us through them appraisal you still got a little bending to go but man I know the Lord will bless him and heal him just perfect good amen let's turn the Bibles now to uh Genesis chapter 3. we're gonna continue on we got like I said unless something Lord changes something uh this will be our next the last service on this subject the holy spirit this is part 11. um obviously I just take some of the more higher lights of things from the scripture subject you could start on Genesis 1 and take years to go through to revelation 22 on this subject but just the things that the Lord lays before me to pull out to talk about that's what we do so Holy Spirit part 11 amen and as we have done through this series I want to start with Genesis chapter 11 or Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 amen before we do let's just buy our heads for word of prayer once again Lord Jesus father we are so very thankful Lord God of your hand upon us your leading guiding and directing us bringing us here once again for this service today thank you Lord that you keep a safe and healthy and strong and Lord in so many ways so many things could have gotten us Lord could have turned us could have hurt us but Lord you keep us safe and you bless us Lord we know as a child of God there's not one thing can happen to us that you don't allow Satan cannot touch us without your permission and we know and we're so very thankful God that your hand is upon us in every way and at every turn our hearts desire Lords to stay in your perfect will to be led by your spirit so Lord I pray that you'd move in this service today and have your prionus once again Lord may you touch every heart in every life may you speak from your word Lord may you accomplish that that you send it forth for the purpose of this meeting to be done God bless those that have come those who may be watching today those that are sick in body needy Whatever It Is God would just lift them every one before you in Jesus Christ's name thank you for your presence thank you Lord for the feeling of the moving and the anointing and the pulsation of your spirit Lord in this place to this point today God and just trusting Lord there's that Spirit sweeps through here as those words would come Lord that you would anoint me and just anoint our ears God to receive that word that you would speak to us once again today may go on in and out the Avenues of our heart Lord and bless uh bless us once again today we committed to you commit ourselves to you all that we are ever could be we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21. unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them praise the Lord he could be seated if you'd like I want to go over to Matthew chapter 13. I want to talk about the seed of God as you may have discerned or taken out of the song sung today uh that's what it's a lot about is being the seed of God being a seed of God means that you are a part of God from before the foundation of the world Amen and I want to speak on that just for a little bit today the Lord willing we're going to begin in Matthew like I said the 13th chapter uh talk about the seeds or 24th verse I mean we read this a few weeks back when one of our uh one of our parts so uh I want to go through this again just real quick uh Saint Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 24. another Parable but he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and so Terrors among the wheat and went his way so we now we see that the good man of the house which we know would be God Jesus so good seed or the seed of God Amen and that would be considered the wheat the wheat of the field that was useful was that that is from God so that God seed is the seed that is purposeful to be sown Amen in in the world sin entered into camp and When sin entered into Camp man and woman began to procreate uh through a union between a man and a woman transfer of seed transfer of hemoglobin that would bring forth human life it was inherent in the human as God created them to be able to reproduce and this way through C by reproduction a transfer from male to female the growth of that seed into a life into a life of maturity the exact same thing happens in botany life and in animal life in every life that God created their seed represented of course the human seed carries with it as that birth comes forth the the entrance of a soul into that person because of the human life but as as this procreation began to take place it was a sowing of seed if you will and it was a sowing of good seed and that seed was to be the seed of God from the very beginning Adam Adam God placed Adam on this planet and from that was to emit good seed but as men and women begin to procreate upon the Earth and is the serpent seat begin to prolificate upon the Earth that that bad seed begins is so itself as well to where the the ground that we have today the world that we have today would be scattered about with the seed of God but the majority of the seed that prolificated upon this Earth was from the serpent sea that seed that was the tear seed the seed that was not now hear me right through predestination in my mind now we know God has everything under control and everything nothing can happen that he doesn't already know but the per the the the perfect will of God to me was to be in here Adam and Adam see or the life of God if you will which would be God seed not Adam seed but God seed it only became Adam's seed after the fall was to be the seed of God that was to that was to cover this ground that was to cover this Earth was to be those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world predestinated in God's mind to be so now the prolification of the uh the continuance the the growth of The Bad Seed has happened in this world because of the fall and because man and woman can procreate that procreation brought about a sowing of bad seed amen the sowing of Bad Seed now the Earth is overtaken with the bad sea with the tares if you will and it was only that way it was never intended to me Saints it was never intended to be that way it was never intended in God's mind in God's perfect will for those in God's permissive will the care to be born on this Earth it was those that were whose names when the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world whose seed was supposed to be planted on this Earth and come forth as the seed of God that's all it was ever supposed to be but uh but because of the evil spirit there was the spirit that come forth in the fall of the Garden of Eden that began to sow Bad Seed begin to sow at as it is represented here an enemy an enemy seed and it was considered or called tares in the Bible which we know is just a weed or something that's basically useless it's more of a nuisance than anything especially if you're trying to uh grow something if you're trying to uh uh plant or harvest uh something is difficult sometimes when uh when there's tears everywhere to be able to to harvest the the correct wheat the correct seed but the tear now is basically something that's useless worthless I'm not saying that humans aren't because every human is a person with a soul where 10 million worth and we don't personally know uh by appearance whether someone is or is an a seed of God yes uh we don't know that even no matter if they come to church no matter if they've never gone to church in their life though we may we buy we don't know for sure everyone that is a seed of God or everyone that is a terror we don't know that we just do know that the terror song was in a greater quantity uh than the seed of God that's why it has taken over the world uh God the the seed of the serpent Satan seed that had taken over this world we know has prolificated to the point that it covers the earth now amen and the seed of God that's why God is going to one day take his seed his wheat and he's going to pull them out amen and then the rest is going to be burned amen the rest is going to be burned let's continue so now we see from that that this Parable that Jesus was talking about God The Good Seed the good man sowed wheat good seed the enemy came in so tears bad seed and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir this not thou sow good seed in thy field from Winston as it tears and he said unto them an enemy has done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather of the tares ye root up also that we with them and we talked about that again like I said four or five weeks ago I forgot at what part of this it was but we we talked about that yeah let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye Gather ye together first the tares and buy them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn amen so God's taking he's binding the tares together now we see that happening all the evil coming together as divided as things sing now Saints with all the government and all everything else going on around the world that that all the evil is coming together all of the evil is being bound together but yet all the bride is coming together she's coming together they're coming together under evil spirit she's coming together under the blood of Jesus Christ and God is about to take his pride out of here so the rest of this can be burned amen that's where we're getting to the place of the of the complete annihilation of this world of annihilation with the complete burning over complete uh uh cleansing of this world is about to take place now Revelation chapter 13. amen Revelation 13 8. Revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world now this is of course talking about the Beast the Beast that will be worshiped by everyone except for those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world or the wheat or the seed of God the seed of God those that that is Gods who have the seed of God in them will not worship this Feast regardless of the cause regardless of what it takes regardless of what it cost them they will not ever worship that Beast they will never bow down to that Beast amen remember that one time when the devil tried to trick brother random into doing that when he was gonna go see the Pope the image to the Beast of the Beast when he was going to go visit the pope he had a audience with the Pope and brother bam talked about the cutting of the cup and all I forgot all the stuff they had the pump and stuff he had to do all these things but then the last thing they said now when you approach him you must battle a knee and kiss his ringing programs up that's out I'll never the gut the Cuffs your pants and all that stuff that's okay but I don't bow to anybody but Jesus Christ right most Last Kiss the Rain that it did Hallelujah from a man how about nobody but Jesus Christ and of course he left never saw him amen because the seed will not do that deceived what I'm about to that image will not bow to that Beast will not bow down or uh accept any of its dogmas and doctrines which a lot of people bow to today they may have never had audience with the Pope but they bow down to that Doctrine they bow down to that Dogma which is the exact same thing by bowing down to what he says and obeying it through its Dogma instead of the word they're bowing down to that Beast they're serving to the image of that Beast because of what they say and do in their worship by by their religion or whatever they want to call it religion's nothing but a covering right amen but people they bow down to this Beast by bowing down to that word their words not the word their word denomination whatever form of it it may be it's still man's idea it's still man's opinion it's still man Dogma they will not do it only those whose names were written in the last book of life who were those those that are the seed of God now we notice that in this last day that brother Brown talked about I remember listen to the sermon uh the the uh cease not air with the shock and it is the rising of the sun uh and the quickening power Amanda forgot the uh Easter seal but the man talks about that quickening power see the only way that it can bring forth the right kind of fruit as that it has to be the right kind of seed and it has to be the right kind of seed in the right atmosphere to produce what's in the sea to produce something that is healthy strong viable to bring forth the good fruit a good crop that seed has to be a right kind of seed in the right atmosphere and brother random said in this last days what this bride is doing through the ministry that is coming through the message that's been delivered and through the word that's been revealed this bride is laying in the presence of the sun just to ripen to get to the place of maturity to get to the places she is no longer uh bathed in Christ or babes in the word she is she is a mature adult in the word Jesus said be therefore perfect grown a full age of maturity be therefore perfect easy this is my Father in Heaven is imperfect that's why this variety is laying in the presence of the Sun she's laying in the presence of the sun now to ripen all this Pride around the world she's taking this word and through Godly ministers and through godly people and through holy ghost-filled people reading and listening in that word becoming real to her she's ripening she's becoming more mature she's becoming more in the image of Jesus Christ every day the bride is becoming more and more like him every day she's becoming more and more like the word every day why because of the seed that is in her it was the seed is what made the difference it was the seed of God if you're not a seed of God then you can't go on into producing or manifesting that that image of God people produce the image of the beasts but not the image of God the only way to produce an image of God is to have the seed of God in you to be a seed of God to be someone whose name was on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world for that seed to bring forth the right kind of life it can only do it when it's in the right place that's when you and I come in the right place God doesn't just plant his seed in anywhere he only plants his seed in the places that he knows is going to represent him that he has sung before the foundation of the world through the annals of time God looked and he saw that who would receive who wouldn't receive who would who would be who wouldn't be amen remember the story brother random tells about the uh the eagle in the chicken yard amen it was uh it was the right kind of seed that was hatched uh the right kind of seed that was that was brought forth but it ended up in the in the wrong kind of atmosphere it ended up in the wrong kind of place uh this this evil egg that this farmer found and stuck under a hen so it could be uh that so that it could be hatched it brought forth the funniest looking chicken you ever seen and that's probably the way the world thought about you the funniest looking uh uh uh sinner they had ever seen you mean you don't do this you mean you don't go there you mean you don't act this way and just little things that made you look odd that made you feel odd even when you're in the world I know so many things and sinful things I did when I was in the world it made me feel uncomfortable uh when I would do them that's right uh I when I take a drink or something I felt uncomfortable it just didn't feel right and I didn't understand why because I was one of them I was in I I was I was in the atmosphere I was in the company and they were all doing it and everybody was having a great time I remember when I was just a boy maybe just just probably a team a little older than Joel uh maybe 12 years 10 12 years old I I I we had all the neighborhood friends all the guys we're all friends and and people that were around and I grew up in a neighborhood with a bunch of guys my age so I I grew up with a lot of friends and we had set in a circle in the middle of the street because a dead end Street and a royal air rural area we'd sit and somebody one of my buddies it'd pull out a uh uh stinky I don't want to say it to where it sounds okay but not uh an illegal cigarette is that something uh maybe it's not so illegal anymore I don't know but and he'd pull it out and then start puffing on that thing and they'd pass it around the circle and for some reason I was 12 years old for some reason every time that thing came to me I grabbed it and passed it on didn't touch it didn't want to have anything to do with it and I don't know why well I do not want now but I didn't know why then why can't I be like them why can't I act like that why can't I do this and every time that I do it I smoked a little bit when I was a kid when I was really young I mean probably even Jose yes stuff that happens and I hate every every single second of it that I hated it I I tried so hard to fit in I tried so hard to be one of them I tried so hard to do what they were doing and I just couldn't do it right uh it just was something in me it just it that's my my soul I might I just couldn't do it because there's just something in your Saints even from birth that told you who you were even when you didn't understand yourself who you were it was a seed of God that was down in there amen you know brother Brown did the same thing they picked on him and laughed at it called him he grabbed that cigarette was getting ready to take a puff on it in that whirl of wind come across through there and he says he threw that thing down and ran a rope crying and said You big sis he said yeah I guess I am I mean what else can you say I guess I was don't matter to me because I don't care anymore because I know who I am now that's right but I didn't know them but it was this it was the seed of God that was in that was in me that was in you it was a seed of an eagle that was in that eagle even though it was in the chicken yard it didn't feel comfortable in the chicken yard what did him say he said that eagle would Peck around the ground like all the rest of them they were just pecking around and having a great Jubilee and just enjoying their beautiful feet and that eagle was picking that stuff singing what in the world are you so happy about this is a nastiest stuff I ever tried to eat how can you live on this that's just pegging but that's all they do picking and pecking and pecking ball one time he heard a voice stream that was something he recognized from the inside it wasn't something that was identified to his ears or knew his mind or it was something on the inside that screen that he remembered from before when when it was when it identified with who he was and he said now I'm something that's real amen Mama screamed down and said just flat those big wings she got I'll catch you just come on up and come up on the uh getting just a little bit higher in those chickens and clucking clucking club and said what's wrong with this this is this is great stuff why would you leave here he looked down at him and said I got I got a higher calling I'm going to higher Heights just slap those wings you'll come up here I'll get you amen Mama brought him a nice uh rabbit or something that he started tearing in and said now that's what I know that I was born to eat I wasn't born to eat and Peg in that chicken yard I was born to eat that fresh Manna amen and when God comes across your pathway what God reveals to you who you really are and you start to realize praise God no wonder I didn't want that old chicken feet no wonder I let them pass that thing across me no wonder if I took a puff or a drink it was a nastiest thing because I was never one of them I've always been one of his praise God because I'm one of his none of that matters anymore I don't care anymore praise God you can bow your heads and you can pray in the middle of a crowded restaurant you can sit with people who are drinking till they're into Oblivion and not bother you because why because you know who you are praise the Lord I think I told you one time one of the guys on my uh on my crew uh the curmudgeon my one of my best friends now he told me one time he says you and I've never known a minister didn't drink I said what you now [Music] amen I can't bounce for the rest of them but I can sure bounce for me amen and praise God because I know by the seed of God see and I just have to do that because of the identification who I know who I am you have to take this and you have to apply it to yourself because you have to be that one you have to be that person you have to be the recognize you have to recognize who you are in yourself as the seed of God you're not that chicken and the eagle in that chicken yarn you don't belong in the chicken yard you're the eagle you belong in the heavens eating fresh God because amen first John chapter three let's go to First John chapter three [Music] amen the seed of God that is in you that seed of God that was there from before the foundation of the world sings amen [Music] probably get to this again a little bit that seed of God the god there amen that's what that represents in my Outlook by life much but that little seed right there all the fault was in that seed is in God created all the heavens and the Earth might not look like much but it's the most powerful greatest force that there's ever been and ever will be amen they've got little as much if God is in it doesn't matter what it looks like doesn't matter what you doesn't matter all this doesn't matter because what is in me is greater than any of the rest that seed seed of God first John chapter 3 . amen talking about the seed now look ninth verse whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed who's seed God see whose LCD would it be amen because you're already born whose they'll seed would it be his seed God's seed remain I don't know why that's not a capitalist not a capital H in my Bible shame on Scofield but it's not a capital H my Bible should be yes yes amen his is God's seed remaineth in him me and he me cannot sin because he me is born of God born now there's got to be a new birth obviously we know that seed has to be born in you it has to be a new birth has to be a new line like we talked about last week there has to be the Holy Ghost in fire come to burn out that old nature that we were born with because that seed that laid in there was you from the beginning it wasn't that safe nature it was always God so no matter when no matter what you were well no matter how you felt no matter who your copy was or what you did that seed of God was always the representation of who you were who you were to be who you are and by that seed being in there even when that snake nature was doing its thing there was something in there that said no it just didn't feel comfortable because that seed was always in there now it had gone live it was dormant but when the spirit of God comes down on that seat when you're burnt born to end with the Holy Spirit and fire it comes to life it burns out the old nature and it gives life remember the seed has to be the right kind of seed in the right atmosphere in the day it was never in the right atmosphere but when the Holy Spirit came and it came into you that old nature was burned out the atmosphere that it was now in like we talked about the love and the Dove and the lamb in the right atmosphere then that that seed began to bring forth life and it was the life of God the life of God from the seed of God to produce who you were to be from before the foundation of the world Even in our sticky human flesh God wants to produce us mold us shape us into his own image amen praise God and that doesn't mean because I'm a male it doesn't mean because I'm a human it doesn't mean because looks or any of that is because of the spirit that is inside of me is who I really am praise God if it's not then all of us are in trouble friend all of us are in trouble because there's only one form of eternal life and if you think you're Eternal the only way you can be Eternal is to be God because God is the only form of Eternity so if you don't if you believe you're Eternal then you then you have to understand that you are God because that's the seed of God yeah amen just like we talked about before intellectual prayer we talked about intellectual property and and copyrights and patents and things like that that they have even in the natural in the world when someone has intellectual property an original fault and they're mine they put it down and they register it with the government nobody else can duplicate that without having to pay a cost or get permission that's what that's legal in the country right if you come with original thought and you put it on paper and you register it with the government that's the only way that's why when I wrote the book I had to copyright that but that book because that was original false now I took some things and I gave credit to the people that I'd heard or took stuff from but all the original thoughts or scripture that came from me is in that book and anybody that tries to disseminate that and reuse it is illegal they're breaking the law without my permission which if anybody's watching anybody has permissions to you know don't hybrid it or anything say what it says but it's someone who wants to use it um I know my wife gets upset sometimes that day's just preaching out of your books maybe that's why God had me write it don't worry if people are getting helped and blessed by it praise the Lord amen you know that's fine it's okay I don't God blesses me I don't need another dime just God blesses me if people are being helped that's all that matters that's that's that's what I care about but from that seat down the intellectual property of God it's a part of me it's who I am that thought originated for me that thought is a part of me that thought is Newton Bennett just like your original thoughts just like your original thing that you think or have or do those are yours they came from your mind they belong to you they're an extension of Who You Are well that's just the same thing with these scenes those are those are nothing but God himself God's original thoughts that God has put down we say in paper but he put his thoughts in you because you're the thought of God where it's your thought of God God's thought is as much a part of God as any part of God Jesus was more much a part of God as any part of God 's sponsor as much a part of God as any part of God and it's your thought of God a thought of God then you're as much of God than any part of God there is that makes you Eternal praise God not this nasty thing but that that God had predestined in his mind before the foundation was who you really are by the seed of God the seed of God that remaineth in him now a lot of people say that you uh and I've heard people I've preached sometimes I've had I'll just be honest uh she may be passed now but I actually had one time a woman a sister came and tried to correct me on something that had spoke I said I'm sorry sister but you're completely off the word not to mention that many quotes I can provide for you that brother rounds said exactly what I just preached on well you that you don't get that seed until the word comes into you I said I understand the premise of what you're saying but let's go to the scripture because you can take anything and and derive something out of it to fit something you think or a narrative that you have but if you don't take it back to the word then what good does your thought mean my thoughts mean nothing my thoughts are absolutely nothing I don't care what I try to derive from it what does it say that's why I like to hinge on in many cases what did Brother Branham say because I believe brother Brown could be the mouthpiece of God a prophet of God when God spoke spoke through him I believe that was God speaking now when brother Brown spoke as a man I understand that he was a man only God's speaking and when he's ministering and the words come before that's I take that as God speaking to me amen but now when God speaks to me friend that is that is a personal relationship that I have with God that's that's God speaking my thought means absolutely nothing I said so when the Bible says that whosoever is born of God that means you have a new birth not a death thought commits sin for his seed God seed remaineth in him that doesn't mean it was just put there that means that it was there and after the birth it remained there unless I'm nuts crazy whatever probably not the right thing to say today but politically correct unless I've gone crazy isn't that what the scripture says the seed remaineth in him it didn't just get put there it was always there and after the birth it remained there yeah yeah that's pretty simple to me I don't think that takes a huge level of intelligence if it did it would it would eliminate me right off the bat so I thank God that he made it simple so my little p brain could understand it or that the revelation of God could bring it to where I could understand it amen that makes sense to me so no matter what a person drives of their own opinion that's what the Bible says and that's what I care about what the Bible says that's God's this is God's thoughts on paper amen this is the thought of God written on paper this is God's original thoughts whosoever is born of God now whosoever is born of God now it's another thing get people cannot commit sin you have to understand uh we and we I brought this out before in the past but you have to understand there's a difference in what the body of the spirit are subject to as to what the soul is subject to amen because when again as we've gone through this series so far you understand that when you are born of God the seal the Holy Spirit remember the holy spirit is a seal the Holy Spirit seals himself in there seals the devil out there's no there's no coming in or out of that Soul any longer it belongs to God that Soul's pure is the influence because of your nature now the nature of who you are the nature of who you are is the nature of God you want to know the nature of God reads your Bible because Jesus Christ produced the nature of God so when the nature of God is is reflected or produced out of you that seed soul is what becomes an influence or the nature of your spirit your human Spirit now influencing what is the life of your body and the life of your body bringing an influence to the body itself now that is absolutely contrary to human reasoning because science and and medicine and reasoning every bit of that channels just the opposite direction it all comes science all comes in medicine all medical all comes all these things in the world all comes in is to channel into you through your see tells tasteful smell here that channels into you should try to influence from the out in but what God is doing through the new birth is influencing by the nature of your soul out to your spirit and out to your body now if that is done in the correct way that spirit of God is in you then then that Soul belongs to God it's that's God your Soul's God that's who you really are remember we talked about who you really are who you really are is the thought of God is as much God as any part of God and that soul is the thought of God it's an attribute an expression of God that seed that has come forth now so how can in your soul you ever commit a sin there God there's no way because God can't commit sin God can't be with their sin amen if God can't be with their sin then how can there ever be another sin ever committed in your soul well when you're born of god let's go back to the scripture when you're born of God you cannot sin why because you've been born not your body the body's the same body you were naturally born with not your spirit because that's the same human spirit that came in you at Birth it's the same Spirit but what is Born Again is your soul so it's the soul through your new birth that can never commit sin it cannot because it's God now the body now if we become influenced to the things of the world and the Sea tasteful smell here imagination constant reason memory come back in the spirit and the body and it starts and it starts feeding downward instead of outward that's when we in our sticky flesh and our humanity and all those things say things we shouldn't feel things we shouldn't act in ways we shouldn't get tempers like we shouldn't things like this that happens that we that should not take place but it's our old nasty sticky flesh now that's not an excuse and that's not making an excuse for sin that's just who we are that's just the way it happens that's why we have repentance that's why Jesus came and shed his blood so that we can know that when something happens he's not supposed to God forgive me I'm sorry I didn't mean to act that way I didn't mean to talk that way I didn't mean to do that whatever it was say God forgive me right and repent what did Brother green used to say repentance was the greatest bargain we ever got I think it was brother green used to say that repentance was the greatest bargain human ever got amen that's the truth because we can go to God not that we make the grace of God of disgrace we don't go do it say well you know just lay in the lap of sin and just say oh God will forgive me well you might as well go to a Catholic church because that's you know do your Penance and do your thing and pay the money whatever they do now and you're absolved and even if you do die in the horrible wretchedness of sin they'll just pay you even more money and get you out of purgatory and you're still okay so what anyway your soul is what's born of God amen and when your soul can't when your soul is God how can it sin that's why it says you cannot the man whoever's born of God not born here not born here but born there so that's what it's referring to cannot see uh cannot sin for the seed of God is in there cannot sin because because of the uh is born of God because he's a new creature because that Spirit now that that the spirit of God is now the nature of God is now influencing your human spirit which is influencing your body which is causing you to outwardly act different think different and sound different and eat different and drink different and talk different and have different friends and have different company people that you that you're around your life is all different again Paul the things I used to hate on all the other things I used to love and I'll hate why because he was a different man he was born again God in his Infinite Wisdom May to help us to to be at the place where his life his Spirit can influence us in even a more greater way than we could ever thought to begin with look now let me see you this is the invisible Union brother Ram says you never did it he's talking about justification he said you never did it sin going back to this scripture we just read first John 3 9. because that little germ amen little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world when God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that there was always in there remember what did he say here because that germ that was in you now people is that I I don't know that precious sister if she ever but that got the Revelation I'm not sure but this is pretty this is the scripture this quote is exactly in line with the scripture not a man's thought not a woman's thought not anybody's thought but the word because that little germ that was in you was to be present you past tense was be present you now praise the Lord again to me friend it's very simple it was to be you from before the foundation of the world God put your name in the last book of life when what we've just read the scripture before the foundation of the world he put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Christ revealed in his own word let me see I'm the time's getting away from me let me see if I can I think this was a little bit of a let's see here Christ revealed in his own word last Sunday when we was going into those uh Cycles about how the five senses of the Realms of these circles here he's talking about he says or it's written on here Cycles I thought he meant circles uh the five senses on the outer realm that's the endless to the five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into that body that's by those five senses the sea case will smell here and there is no other way to contact that body on the inside of that man is called Spirit human spirit and he has five senses uh he doesn't list them all here but we just set them in imagination constant region fiction um and five of them now you can't now you can't think with your body you think with your mind and in there is where too many Christians only uh too many of Christians only stop and they can just uh like the corner wheat in the field and the weed and the the uh and the weed in the field they can be Anointed with the same Holy Spirit uh that the real believer is Anointed with but down on the inside of that the next realm Third Realm is the soul and that's predestinated by God there is where the real germ seed lays is in there in the soul that's why that's what God is concerned about cares about that's what we should be concerned about cared about I remember if I take a couple bird and cut it open drafting the heart of a weed and put it in there bury it it would bring forth the wheat out of the cockle bird no matter what the outside is well if the emotions are and and those things today people are so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has but he cannot bring that word word by word by word right yes amen cannot do it that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always felt that's where them on the tape the false anointed ones uh they can be Anointed with the same Spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still be a devil is the inside praise the Lord amen he talks about Abraham and Levi and uh being the great great grandfather I forgot how many times removed it was but anyway and and still that seed that was in Abraham we talked it goes in Hebrews that same seed that God recognized he attributed to Levi Generations later he attributed to Levi because he was already in him amen praise the Lord let's go on Ephesians chapter 1. Ephesians chapter one we'll start with verse 1. something amen Ephesians 1 1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who bless us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us God had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love which God is love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated of a bad word in a lot of Christian circles but a true word nevertheless a scriptural word nevertheless because we are truly predestinated of God because God predestinates based on his foreknowledge not based on his will that's right God knew everything in from the beginning thus he could predestinate you can't say that God didn't know every single thing every single person that would ever be on this planet God knew amen and if he did then he could predestinate he knew who would believe who wouldn't believe who would accept him who wouldn't accept him and thus by that he could put that seed in that person amen put their name on the last book of life before the foundation of the world and that book that contains your name is the seed of God that brings forth your name and was supposed to be that way as decreed time by the original creation but God still made a way through procreation man and woman through time uh we know how brother green used to talk about brother Brown told him that that God sent your dad from wherever here and your mom way over here however it was brought the two together so they would breed you that was his word that's what brother green said to bring you to bring him about amen the purpose of that being regardless of what else happened regardless of what else goes on there was a reason why God brings all these things together to work according to his perfect plan because of the circumventing of of of of the original sin God had to bring forth the seed that he intended in The Book of Life the last book of life through procreation and then produce a plan to save that person and to fill them with his spirit that's why he brought us to this place why every one of us or are in this place not not this place but in him now because of what God did and brought all this together however it is why I forgot it takes God to do it things amen and God brings every bit of it around to bring it all the place so that every bit of it falls in line to work together for our good and for the good pleasure of his will amen we're predestinated to the good pleasure of his will to the praise sixth verse to the praise of the glory of his grace where he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in home we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we've been predestinated and now we've been redeemed praise the Lord he redeems the predestinated only the predestinated are redeemed because you can't redeem something that was not previously there you can only re prefix or E bring back you can only read something that was there to start with that's right if it was never there to start with it couldn't be read you could deem it I deem you as so and so or like they do in England i dub you so-and-so I deem you as something but to redeem something it had to be there to start with I put you in a position but redeem means I put you back in the position that you should have been and we're in praise God so only those that were there to start with could be read back to there praise God through his blood the forgiveness of sin the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us and all wisdom Prudence having made maybe I should have split this in two parts is taking longer having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself now that he's predestinated you and he's redeemed you he's revealing himself to you amen praise God revealing to who the Regis now that God's put you back in your proper position now that the New Birth has taken place and now that influence of God is taken over your life now he begins to reveal himself to you now he begins to let himself known to you who he really is know what you learned in Sunday school or some denomination or something which is okay or some uh uh uh a Catholic or Pope or something but who you really are and who he really is in you he begins to reveal to you the mystery is no longer a mystery not to the bride because it's been revealed to her praise the Lord is this not the manifestation of the word of God the revealed word of God for the day as it was as it was in the days of the son of man amen the manifesting revealing 10th verse now that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might Gather in one all things in Christ which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him now we're being gathered together because this is the end time and the fullness of time we're about to go home God's bringing it all together he's predestinated you he's redeemed you he's revealed himself to you he has brought you through to the maturity of who you really are and now into the fullness the end of time we're about to go home in home we have obtained an inheritance and that's where to our inheritance amen oh Paul had such a revelation of the word no wonder God no wonder brother Branham said that God would show to Paul to bring to the Ephesians the message he did this first chapter would have thrown the Corinthians or Galatians on their ear but I by the way brother banham talked about it the Ephesian Church could receive this and accept it to understand who they were and not worry about talking about honey you need to quit talking about each other the way you are you need to keep running each other down you need to quit doing this and quit doing that no he just showed them the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ from the beginning to end amen praise predestinated from before the foundation of the world mine amen being predestinated according to his purpose of whom uh of him who work in all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession praise the Lord God predestinated you God is omniscient which means all-knowing he knows all things beginning from End Amen and all things that were redeemed now I'm going to read this amen and I'm going to close and uh the next part was going to piggyback on this part so Lord willing what we'll do is just try to take some of the nose things the Lord had gave me on to the we'll just try to make the next one that if not it'll just go to another part but let me read this and we'll close here in broken system now this is something that people still struggle over even in the message I've talked to people who still struggle over this I have people who have told me that they understand said thing yet their actions tell a different story uh it their actions in the way they talk would would lead you to believe that they don't have a revelation of this of the evidence of the Holy Ghost probably one of the most misunderstood things in all of Christendom is the evidence of the Holy Ghost yeah amen and I say that because it's discussed about in so many different circles in the Christian religion now Trinity of course is we know it's false but that has you said well that's one of the most controversial no it's not the most 99 probably of the Christian religion Christian World believes in the Trinity they believe in three Gods there's no debating that you go to another church or calvary or a Baptist Church or they that's all that the Trinity is it they believe in three gods it's not up for debate that's not something we look at it and we know it's not up for debate either we know there's not three Gods we know there's not a Trinity right we know there's one God amen amen amen no not one like your finger but that's a whole nother message but uh but this is still in controversy with a lot of people and a lot of people I've talked to even in the message listen brother Brown now remember I I take what he says to the word amen and to me what is said here what the word says matches yes yes by the Revelation the Lords get me now it may not be the same for other people that's up to them that's their responsibility to God this is my responsibility to God that's what I believe amen but this I believe brother random spoke I considered that as God speaking to me listen he talked to he said let me just read the whole thing this isn't broken sister and if you want to find it July 26 1964. today I was talking with my good friend Dr Lee Vale who is present now he's quite a theologian and so we usually have some pretty good discussions on the scripture he's very smart and he asked me one time what I thought about the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues it's been that way been said that way many years and a lot of people they still believed that I had a very dear good friend of mine in Charlotte that still believed that believe he probably believed it to the day he died I guess I I tried to help him with some scripture but they had I won't tell you what Ministry he was involved in is is a big one but they actually their Church in Charlotte that he went to their sign for their Church their Church sign was literally in the image of a tongue no joke I'm not I'm I'm not exaggerating right their Church sign on the side of the road was literally in the image of a tongue yeah that that is how steeped they were in believing that that you spoke in tongues with initial love until he goes he told me one time that he had a sales consultant purse that they were after they got done meeting with a client and they were in a parking lot and he got to talking and they were talking about Christianity and stuff like this and the Holy Ghost and he told now this is his testimony to me or was he's passed away now but he was I loved the brother he was a good friend um he would he expressed the story to me said and I'll just tell you in my way yeah what I heard was I got this woman to battle him so much she thought she was speaking in tongues that's what I heard because they get you repeating the same phrase over and over again and they get a person so tongue-tied that they think they're speaking in tongues that and the Holy Spirit done is you got it that's it you got it now you've reached it and all the person's done is basically gotten they're babbled their tongue tied so to the point that they think they have the Holy Ghost sad but true sad but true but look now this is the question initial evidence of Holy Ghost uh brother man said now to leeville's question no I can't see that speaking of initial let's begin in tongues initial evidence the Holy Ghost he said I can't see that he said neither do I leave Bell said neither do I said though I thought I've Been Told he said what would you think would be an Evidence I said the most perfect evidence I could think of as love and we got to talking on about it and I thought that sounded pretty good that love love would be the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost you can really Express the love of God shows the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost he said so brother random said so I held to that so you imagine when brother Branham is holding to this belief that love was the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost how his ministry was affected by that and any message that brother Brennan preached during that period of time was affected by it amen not that he didn't preach the truth I'm not saying that and I'm not saying not to follow or listen to any of that but it has to be affected by it amen he says so I thought that sounded pretty good so I held to that if a man's got love but one day the Lord now forget about the discussion between a theologian and a minister forget a discussion about two individuals and their personal opinions he said the Lord now you've got something the Lord in a vision straightened me out and he said that the evidence of the Holy Spirit was those who could receive the word neither speaking in tongues or or love but it was receiving the word praise God now I'll take that any day because that's scripture amen amen you've got a lot of people around you can produce all kinds of love I mean there's probably millions of people out there produce more love than any of us sitting here amen yeah amen me I I'll just speak for myself then amen but is that the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there's people he said devil speak in tongues people speak in tongues all the time and even genuine anointed Spirit of speaking in tongues but that's not an evidence that you got the Holy Ghost somebody brother Ramen says don't jump any iron you can live amen I say don't don't don't don't speak anymore with any higher than you can live amen but what it is is receiving Christ and what is Christ the word and he's not literally this book Christ the word receiving the word because what he say that's the one thing the devil cannot do he can impersonate any kind of a gift prophecy tongues uh love whatever Spirit he can produce any of those things he can replicate them he can fake them but he cannot bring that word word by word by word he cannot do it amen amen and that shows now receiving of the word that's different than just hearing the word that's different than just going to church and reading the word receiving it means you become it when you take something into yourself that means you've received it it's like brother random said when he talks about a man and a woman he said as soon as you take a woman to your bosom she leaves an imprint do you know he said that she leaves an imprint that becomes a part of you amen because you take that you take her in unto yourself and she becomes a part of you amen that's why uh well one reason one reason you don't see us as brother and sisters going around hugging each other for that reason many other reasons but that's one of them when you take that woman unto yourself she becomes a part of you amen when I took my wife took her to my I received her as my wife amen now she's my wife there's no other period that's it when you receive the word that word becomes a part of you when the word becomes a part of you you start living the word when you live the word your life replicates what's in the pages of this book amen and who Jesus Christ is your life replicates your life duplicates your life becomes what it is that's receiving the word amen you can you can drop a word anytime but it doesn't matter until somebody takes it and puts it into action when you put it into action that's the token on display the word an action is the token on display is the word being manifested through you because you've received it to yourself it's become a part of who you are now it's not just now by the true Revelation it's not necessarily even just a part of you it is who you are not in part but in whole praise the Lord let's stand if we could [Music] praise the Lord now you talk about acting different talking different looking different amen because it's who you are praise the Lord amen amen and the whole thing about that is [Music] I know we were born in sin-shaped in World speaking lies but it isn't even by true Revelation by true god-given Revelation it really isn't even what you have become it is who you always were amen it's who you always were because you all you never were when brother Adam says you never get it did it it means you never were that old person you were always this right here always amen praise the Lord all let's sing this course to him before we go today amen Lord prepare me my body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen and God has made me to that purpose so many times I see people around I usually even have a guy that worked with us and he said he was a Christian went to a charismatic nominal church somewhere of actually Pennsylvania he come back one time uh when he was on our team eight ten months ago and he had a big cross tattooed on his arm I'm like why did you do that well that's just a representation of my papers you think God really liked you to scar up the temple that he's supposed to be housed in with with ink with the scarring on your body I I don't I don't understand but there's a lot of there's a lot of nominal Christian churches out there that believe that that's okay now you know and when those things happen before you except Christ I understand you know that all things have happened to us before life I get that you we bear the scars physically mentally or emotionally of things that we did when we were questions but but when you become one and what my preacher says that's okay the Bible doesn't say us first you need to take whatever new international revise of their revised new edition of the revised edition of somebody's opinion and throw it in the garbage because it's not a good it's not the scripture right right but we are to be sanctuaries of the Holy Ghost amen pure holy amen we struggle to it every day we work toward it every day amen as humans because the black and the white dog or but we're always to be what God made us let's sing it amen Lord prepare me give me a sanctuary [Music] will be tried and true with Thanksgiving sanctuary [Music] for you oh sing it again him now yes the Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary you're an holy tried and true with Thanksgiving [Music] [Applause] [Music] sanctuary [Music] for you one more time with all our hearts now yes Lord prepare me to be a saint you weary everything pure

uh also after consideration and thinking about all options and everything I'm going to cancel next Sunday service I'm flying out at 6 00 a.m in the morning uh to uh go back to Pennsylvania absolutely no flights nothing available nothing that was going to work as far as flying so I'm flying out at 6 a.m and I appreciate all the input I appreciate all everything that everyone 's Jester said Mike is not going to be here next Sunday so I just I kind of felt leaning towards canceling anyway but I hate feeling like I'm letting everybody down but then after Mike had mentioned that he wasn't going to have some of my mind I remembered you saying that that just didn't connect it I just didn't feel to leave the whole service burden on Zach so um so next Sunday we'll just cancel the 20th I'm not going to make this uh a common thing though so I don't feel like that this is going to happen because it's not um if this becomes an issue I'll quit but I don't think I don't believe it's going to do it I think this is just a one-time thing so just keep in your mind remember I'll try to remember to let everybody know next week but there will be no service here if you want to visit other place watch some of the old sermons we watched today's message again if you'll wonder feel free to do as you feel led of the Lord and just pray the Lord really the best unit we'll see you again on August 27th so
