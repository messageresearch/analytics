[5:55] we're together again
[6:10] [Applause]
[6:11] [Music]
[6:21] uh glad and i thank the lord that he's
[6:23] given us another opportunity to join
[6:25] together again
[6:27] a lot of places a lot of churches around
[6:29] the country you know are
[6:31] having to separate and close down
[6:34] just because of the pandemic but i just
[6:37] thank the lord that he's given us this
[6:39] place and this time to be with him
[6:43] let's just ask him to join us this
[6:45] morning and be with us brother zinke
[6:46] would you mind opening the service up in
[6:48] the word of prayer please
[6:50] just be our heads our
[6:53] gracious precious heavenly father
[6:56] dear god how thankful we are to yes to
[6:59] be able to
[7:00] be alive in this new year that's here
[7:03] yes lord like the brother said to be
[7:06] able to have an open door
[7:08] to be able to fellowship have things in
[7:10] common
[7:11] lord the world is rejoicing they think
[7:14] that
[7:14] 2020 is behind us and there's good times
[7:17] ahead but i
[7:18] believe father that they're mistaken i
[7:21] believe we've had a prophet speak
[7:22] that this country rejected god in 1956
[7:26] 57 then she would continue to spry earl
[7:30] down into chaos
[7:32] certainly lord we see that today and yes
[7:34] there's just no
[7:35] no right decisions no sound
[7:39] decisions and anything that's being done
[7:41] yes god we
[7:43] just want to just commit our lives to
[7:46] you
[7:46] even at this day lord as we're in a new
[7:49] york
[7:50] year may we just surrender over all to
[7:52] you yes
[7:53] no dear god to take us and just mold us
[7:56] into that perfect
[7:57] image of a perfect man statue of a
[7:59] perfect man
[8:00] yes father lord one thing i would desire
[8:03] more than anything else is that you'd
[8:04] fill our way with love and brain
[8:06] yes lord we know that satan is just
[8:09] going about like a roaring lion to put
[8:12] fear in the hearts of
[8:13] people just everywhere with these mass
[8:16] and this epidemic
[8:17] and oh god we know that fear has torment
[8:20] but
[8:20] perfect love casts out fear yes but if
[8:23] we could just have more love we
[8:25] thank you we know that there was a
[8:26] brother that had so much love that he
[8:28] was boiled in oil and the oil didn't
[8:30] touch him
[8:31] yes but to me if we could have more love
[8:34] of god then these
[8:35] pandemics and these viruses couldn't
[8:37] touch us and
[8:38] we'd just be filled with that love of
[8:40] god brother branham said that
[8:42] the greatest thing that we need is love
[8:45] we don't need more gifts we don't need
[8:47] more speaking in tongues we just need
[8:49] more of love
[8:50] yes well just draw us closer to you this
[8:52] morning and may you fill our way in our
[8:54] hearts with love today and

[27:10] written down or uh
[27:12] sent in to brother ben or myself but
[27:14] does anyone have a testimony they'd like
[27:15] to share with the congregation this
[27:17] morning
[27:18] yes yes sorry
[27:22] oh okay um
[27:31] maybe i should go up there because i
[27:33] need i don't think we can hear you
[27:36] support this i think we can hear you
[27:38] right there
[27:39] okay
[27:42] um brother green i'm preempting my
[27:46] testimony by something that
[27:48] my pastor brother green has passed away
[27:54] did and it was so helpful to me
[27:58] because for many years i really
[28:00] struggled with trying to understand
[28:02] it and
[28:05] he gave the women an assignment in the
[28:07] church
[28:09] he said i want some of you sisters to
[28:16] a scripture uh next sunday
[28:19] and um and i want you to make a comment
[28:22] on it
[28:26] so the next sunday the
[28:30] there were three sisters who spoke and
[28:34] one of them gave her scripture and then
[28:36] gave her
[28:38] um what she
[28:41] the thoughts that came to her just a
[28:44] statement
[28:46] the third sister the last one
[28:50] gave her scripture and then she and then
[28:54] she gave her statement
[28:56] and then she started to move into
[28:59] another area adding a layer to that and
[29:01] then a layer to that and a layer to that
[29:03] and brother green
[29:04] stopped her and he said sister now
[29:08] you're patient
[29:10] hmm so that being said
[29:15] i've been in the book of nehemiah and it
[29:17] was so late last night
[29:20] i just said cuttings i don't care i'm
[29:23] just gonna read this bible
[29:27] and i was spend when i saw
[29:31] i've got to read you the scripture that
[29:32] i started
[29:36] i've read this bible so many times and i
[29:39] never saw this
[29:40] before it's nehemiah 9
[29:44] if you want to see it at the end of the
[29:46] chapter and the
[29:47] first verse of the beginning of the
[29:50] of the next of chapter 10.
[29:54] it says
[29:58] behold we're servants this day for the
[30:00] lamb that you gave
[30:01] unto our fathers to eat the fruit of it
[30:04] and the good of it behold we're
[30:06] servants in it and it yields much
[30:10] increase onto the kings when you set
[30:12] over us
[30:12] because of our sins also they have
[30:16] dominion over our bodies
[30:18] and over our cattle at their pleasure
[30:20] and we are in great
[30:22] distress and because of all of this we
[30:25] make a sure
[30:26] covenant and write it and our princes
[30:30] levites and priests seal onto it
[30:35] now those that sealed were nehemiah and
[30:38] tertia
[30:39] and a string of names that takes up a
[30:42] a column of scripture
[30:45] so i was stunned when i saw nehemiah
[30:48] said they were sealed
[30:50] by agreeing to keep the covenant of the
[30:53] law given to moses
[30:55] i had to read it over i had i've never
[30:58] registered hearing it that way
[31:00] i always thought that was a new
[31:02] testament happening his brother branham
[31:05] explained
[31:06] as i sat back and pondered this god
[31:10] started downloading me
[31:12] he caused me to remember that no human
[31:16] could keep the it perfectly
[31:19] except jesus christ through his holy
[31:23] spirit our only
[31:24] covenant keeper keeping it perfectly
[31:44] he's worthy he's so worthy
[31:47] amen worthy of our praise yes
[31:51] i'm worthy of honor worthy of glory
[31:55] and power thank you sister
[32:10] thank you lord
[32:27] for others too but it was for her she
[32:29] grabbed my hand
[32:30] and she started crying so i believe god
[32:34] is just showing true
[32:35] again amen praise the lord
[32:43] does anyone else have a testimony they'd
[32:45] like to share this one
[32:48] brother yeah um this is actually from my
[32:50] dad so if i don't get this right i
[32:52] apologize
[32:54] but he was out um checking his mail one
[32:56] day and there's a new neighbor
[32:57] down the way where they live at he
[32:59] bought five acres and he saw my dad and
[33:01] decided to walk down the street and my
[33:02] dad first of all
[33:03] he was taking his time jenna walked up
[33:06] and juiced himself and said hello i
[33:07] wanna
[33:07] i just feel like led by the lord and
[33:10] talk to you
[33:11] some of that guy said well he's like
[33:12] it's amazing you know he's like
[33:14] i'm a believer this man they were
[33:15] talking and stuff and
[33:18] it got kind of deep in the conversation
[33:19] they said that he came i don't know
[33:21] where it is i know what's in tucson
[33:23] and they said that a church he came from
[33:25] got vandalized
[33:27] there's kids riding all over and they
[33:28] actually burned it down
[33:30] and he got there and he was running it
[33:32] inside and out trying to you know
[33:34] stop the fire and stuff and they said
[33:36] the fire department showed up they
[33:37] grabbed him and he was standing there
[33:39] still they were telling him he was on
[33:42] fire
[33:43] and he was like i'm not on fire and they
[33:45] actually gradually tackled him and
[33:47] rolled him
[33:47] and turned him out and when he stood
[33:50] back up
[33:51] they said he was still on fire and he
[33:53] said he just happened to glance over one
[33:55] of the vehicles
[33:56] and holding him was an angel he said he
[33:59] saw an angel holding him
[34:01] and he rededicated his life to the lord
[34:04] being surrendered and now what he's i
[34:07] guess
[34:08] him and my dad are going to be you know
[34:10] talking about the lord a lot having a
[34:11] little
[34:12] moment but it was just amazing to see
[34:14] that the lord is still with us every day
[34:15] my name is taking care of us and always
[34:18] you know he's in in lead if we just
[34:20] surrender
[34:21] so to me it was just it was an amazing
[34:23] story just to hear that
[34:24] you know these reasons happen every day
[34:27] if you would just
[34:28] stop amen listen hey man thank you
[34:33] um does anyone have a song special i
[34:34] know brother micah has one that
[34:37] would like to share it now just let me
[34:40] know if you do anyone else has one
[34:46] i'm gonna use a soundtrack again today
[34:53] um so this song i've seen before
[34:58] probably almost a year ago
[35:01] but i was i was looking up the uh the
[35:04] gentleman who wrote it
[35:06] and he was given a couple testimonies
[35:08] about
[35:09] the way people been touched one
[35:12] lady she said this song got her through
[35:14] chemo
[35:16] another said that her husband
[35:20] of 40 years had
[35:23] been making fun of her for going to
[35:25] church every sunday
[35:27] every sunday he would make fun of her
[35:28] and
[35:30] one day he was flipping through tv
[35:32] channels and the gather show was on
[35:34] and the booth brothers who sing this
[35:36] song was singing the song you know i got
[35:38] to the second verse he's
[35:40] broke he started to cry and
[35:43] from that point on he dedicated his life
[35:45] and went to the same church that he made
[35:46] fun of his wife for going
[35:48] um for two years until he passed so he
[35:51] had two years of life left
[35:53] amen that's what god just said praise
[35:54] the lord very much
[35:57] i felt this on my heart a couple weeks
[35:58] ago to see after i had sing the one last
[36:01] sunday so i hope it's a blessing
[36:03] to you
[36:18] [Music]
[36:24] i was working in town one
[36:27] afternoon attending some
[36:30] business affairs i
[36:34] heard a commotion a couple streets over
[36:38] i wondered what's happening there
[36:42] a young man was running from in that
[36:45] direction
[36:46] and stopped just to catch his breath
[36:51] i asked him to please tell me what was
[36:54] the hurry
[36:56] he smiled up to me and he said
[37:00] i was trying to catch the crippled
[37:04] mended here on
[37:09] he was rushing home to tell
[37:12] everyone what jesus did today
[37:18] and the mute man was telling myself as
[37:21] a deaf girl he's leaving to answer god's
[37:25] fault
[37:27] it's hard to believe but if you don't
[37:30] trust
[37:30] me ask the blind man he saw it
[37:35] [Music]
[37:47] my friends if the troubles and burdens
[37:50] you

[38:02] to be

[38:07] that altered the future of the blind man
[38:10] the death and the land

[38:18] [Music]
[38:30] this way he was rushing
[38:34] home to tell everyone what
[38:37] jesus said today
[38:40] and the mute man was telling myself
[38:44] and the deaf
[38:50] it's hard to believe but if you don't
[38:52] trust me
[38:53] [Music]
[38:55] ask the blind man he saw it all
[39:03] [Music]

[45:25] uh
[45:27] i also i failed to put on there about
[45:30] brother jim
[45:32] as a prayer request
[45:36] if you think you may want to go
[45:40] his funeral is tuesday at the calvary
[45:43] chapel on
[45:44] speedway uh caleb duron and bobby roarke
[45:48] aren't going to be officiating but if
[45:49] you'd like to do that
[45:51] you may go remember brother jim i don't
[45:54] know how many
[45:55] brother jim but he was a precious
[45:56] brother we shared pinto beans together
[46:00] we got to talking one time at the
[46:03] tabernacle and
[46:05] we were talking about i was being me
[46:08] being from the south and
[46:10] didn't ever get any good pinto beans and
[46:12] you know ham hock
[46:14] anymore and stuff cornbread and onion
[46:16] and and uh
[46:17] you know he and he and he was just
[46:20] talking
[46:20] and then the next service he told sammy
[46:23] and next service he brought me a big
[46:24] thing of
[46:26] pinto beans and cornbread that sammy had
[46:28] made
[46:29] and uh i took the i took it back to him
[46:32] again i said
[46:32] could i get a refill it was a it was a
[46:36] it was a thing that me and him shared
[46:38] that was kind of neat because
[46:40] of the way that we were and all that i
[46:43] appreciate it brother jim he was a good
[46:44] chin
[46:45] good genuine godly man he wasn't fake he
[46:48] wasn't pretentious
[46:50] uh he was who he was and um
[46:53] i look forward to seeing him again one
[46:55] day amen amen
[46:56] it's just hard to understand sometimes
[46:58] but i don't guess it necessarily isn't
[47:00] for us to always understand
[47:02] right but we just believe and trust the
[47:03] lord that all things work together for
[47:05] our good because we love you
[47:07] amen but also i forgot to mention a good
[47:10] friend of mine back in north carolina
[47:12] bobby
[47:12] bobby i want to say bob your work again
[47:15] roby turner
[47:16] uh his pastor church in durham north
[47:19] carolina passed away this week
[47:21] just a couple of days ago and i didn't
[47:24] keep in constant contact with brother
[47:26] roby but
[47:27] brother roby opened his pulpit to me one
[47:30] of the first places i ever preached over
[47:32] 30 years ago
[47:33] was at brother robbie turner's church
[47:37] and i would ask that you would remember
[47:39] him pray for his family and those that
[47:41] are left behind there back in
[47:44] in durham in burlington raleigh area
[47:46] north carolina
[47:47] uh that the lord would just bless
[47:49] another one's gone home
[47:51] yes amen it's amazing it seems like it
[47:53] it comes
[47:54] in waves and it's just seems to be
[47:57] coming more
[47:58] rapidly anymore nowadays but um i
[48:00] appreciate the lord keeping us and
[48:02] blessing us and it's good to see each
[48:04] one of you and good to have you here
[48:05] today and
[48:06] appreciate those who may be streaming
[48:07] today pray the lord richly bless you as
[48:10] well so
[48:10] we're going to go into the bible and
[48:12] we're going to read and begin our
[48:14] scripture reading in revelation 13.
[48:18] um
[48:23] this has been on my heart for a long
[48:25] time especially since all the covetous
[48:27] stuff's been going on
[48:29] and all the things that's happening with
[48:30] the government and
[48:32] politics and because that has a lot to
[48:35] play with it if you realize through the
[48:36] bible through brother branham's message
[48:38] uh if you haven't really noticed it
[48:40] would probably
[48:42] listening to the message you probably
[48:43] maybe skip over you kind of tune out the
[48:45] things that's the political things but
[48:47] when you really go
[48:48] and you look in it and you see how many
[48:50] things brother branham talked about that
[48:52] were political
[48:53] uh it's it's quite outstanding i mean
[48:56] it's
[48:56] it's quite a bit because there's so much
[48:58] of it that plays its part
[48:59] in with the scripture and then with our
[49:01] current life through the scripture so
[49:04] um as it has been the other
[49:07] the other day uh the lord just put on my
[49:09] heart and he basically said
[49:11] you've been telling everybody this is
[49:13] revelation 13 this is revelation 13 this
[49:15] is revelation 13.
[49:17] so it says time to speak on a little bit
[49:20] so
[49:21] not that we haven't because i took
[49:24] revelation 13 as a whole one time
[49:26] a year and a half or so ago and went
[49:28] through the entire
[49:29] chapter uh four five six services of
[49:32] that so
[49:33] but i just want to get through to a
[49:35] specific part that i want to
[49:37] major on today at the lord willie so
[49:39] revelation 13.
[49:41] but before we read this bow our heads
[49:43] again if we could for word of prayer
[49:46] precious jesus again father we're very
[49:48] thankful of all that you do for us
[49:50] giving us and blessing us and lord the
[49:52] opportunity to be here today lord thank
[49:54] you for opening these doors and having
[49:56] this place provided for us that we can

[50:00] you
[50:00] lord to visit with us once again to
[50:03] speak your word and to minister to our
[50:04] hearts and lives
[50:06] lord it's not us lord but it's you it's
[50:08] not a singing it's not the words it's
[50:10] not the ministering it's
[50:11] it's you god and everything about you
[50:13] everything you is us lord and we just
[50:15] give ourselves to you in every way
[50:17] we thank you for all that is done and
[50:19] said lord and for our lives and for
[50:21] protecting us and keeping us safe and
[50:23] trusting and believing god for every
[50:25] prayer request and need lord
[50:26] your hand would be upon them and that
[50:28] need the answer already on the way for
[50:30] those needs god even before we prayed
[50:32] but believing father that you said ask
[50:34] we ask
[50:35] we ask and believe we don't ask amiss we
[50:38] ask and believe and trust you lord that
[50:40] you're going to answer and that you're
[50:41] going to meet every one of those needs
[50:42] and everyone that's upon our hearts in
[50:44] every situation
[50:45] whatever we're all going through lord
[50:47] it's a time of life lord where a purging
[50:49] is taking place and
[50:51] this world is purging itself and now all
[50:53] the things elements of it's purging
[50:55] itself and
[50:56] of course it's a it's a time uniting and
[50:58] a timing uniting of your bride yes
[51:00] coming together lord and rejoicing in
[51:02] your word
[51:03] believing god that you are the protector
[51:05] you're the leader you're the guide
[51:06] you're the strength you're the help
[51:08] lord we love you and thank you for all
[51:10] that you do for us
[51:11] lord we just pray as we commit the
[51:13] remaining part of this service in your
[51:14] hands
[51:15] we rebuke every demonic spirit that
[51:17] would try to come and hinder or
[51:18] infiltrate or hurt this service in any
[51:20] way
[51:21] that you would have the praise and the
[51:22] glory and that all that you
[51:24] determined to be done would be done in
[51:26] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[51:28] committed to you
[51:29] and asked your blessings upon it bless
[51:30] these that have come today bless those
[51:32] that may be streaming father
[51:34] may you just speak to us from your word
[51:36] once again as we commit ourselves to you
[51:38] and ask these things in the name of the
[51:39] lord jesus christ we pray
[51:41] amen amen amen i'll just read a couple
[51:44] script
[51:45] a couple verses here begin with the 16th
[51:47] verse and we'll let you be seated
[51:50] revelation 13 verse 16
[51:53] and he calls it all both small and great
[51:55] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[51:58] mark in their right hand or in their
[51:59] foreheads
[52:00] and that no man might buy or sell say
[52:03] that he had the mark or the name of the
[52:05] beast or the number of his name
[52:07] here is wisdom let him that have to
[52:09] understand and count the number of the
[52:10] beast it is the number of a man
[52:12] and his number is six hundred three
[52:16] three score and six and you can be
[52:18] seated if you like
[52:20] that's part of the scripture i want to
[52:22] major on obviously we're coming to this
[52:24] point today
[52:25] because we we can't lose focus and
[52:29] realization of all the stuff that's
[52:31] going on
[52:32] remember the warnings that i've given
[52:34] several times to you my congregation
[52:37] uh of of the things that happen in the
[52:39] world and the way the devil works
[52:41] uh he he tries really hard
[52:45] to cause a great disturbance at the
[52:47] front door so you don't recognize that
[52:49] he's coming in the back door right right
[52:51] amen and all the things that goes on
[52:53] around
[52:54] we need to refocus and make sure the
[52:56] covet and the government the election
[52:58] and all this stuff that's going on
[53:00] first of all we're not of this world
[53:02] we're pilgrims and strangers
[53:04] we are elements of this world and we
[53:05] play our part in this world
[53:07] but we are not of this world we're just
[53:09] strangers pilgrims
[53:11] going through this land this cosmos
[53:13] doesn't belong to us this world does
[53:15] but this cosmos doesn't belong this
[53:17] world order
[53:18] does not belong to us so we stay in
[53:20] focus of exactly what's going on
[53:24] what's happening where it's coming from
[53:26] the things that's
[53:27] really behind what's happening today
[53:30] because they want to blame president
[53:31] trump they want to blame
[53:32] administration uh republicans want to
[53:35] blame biden or
[53:36] everyone everybody wants to blame
[53:38] everybody right and it gets back to the
[53:39] same as in the garden of eden
[53:41] when they fell everybody wanted to blame
[53:43] everybody else
[53:44] of course the eve it was a serpent and
[53:47] adam it was even
[53:48] it was a it was a blame game but we but
[53:51] all that is to try to
[53:52] distract the focus on what is really
[53:55] happening because there is a
[53:56] he in this whole thing that is
[53:59] orchestrating all this
[54:00] right that's bringing it to a scriptural
[54:03] head
[54:04] that we know is going to happen we've
[54:05] known for years we've heard it priests
[54:07] we've heard it
[54:08] talked about we heard brother brown talk
[54:09] about it we've read it in the bible
[54:11] we know where it's going to we know
[54:12] where it's headed up
[54:14] but we can't forget who were the head of
[54:17] it
[54:17] where it's coming from we begin this
[54:20] scripture that said and he
[54:22] so there's a he that is behind all this
[54:25] yes
[54:25] and it's not donald trump it's not biden
[54:28] it's not any supreme court justice it's
[54:31] not any form of government
[54:32] right the he is the devil amen the
[54:35] devil's the one that's behind all of
[54:37] this
[54:38] yes and if you look at that you can see
[54:40] that that he
[54:41] incarnates in another he to bring about
[54:44] what's happening in this country and in
[54:46] this world today
[54:47] so let's go back in and background and
[54:50] we can begin at the beginning of
[54:52] revelation 13 and read through it
[54:57] that'll help us pick up what we're
[55:00] talking about and get us to the point
[55:02] that where we're
[55:03] wanting to realize what's going on today
[55:06] am i well i told you when a lot of this
[55:08] stuff started or i mentioned a lot of
[55:10] this stuff started and i was in prayer
[55:13] uh the lord gave me some things i gave
[55:15] that to you off
[55:16] camera uh and i've never said those
[55:18] things on camera and i don't plan to say
[55:21] them on camera
[55:22] if i ever say them it won't be something
[55:24] that's published or
[55:25] out for anybody can see it because
[55:27] that's the warning that god gave me
[55:30] so i won't violate that unless he tells
[55:32] me to i won't violate
[55:34] that warning i want to keep it the way
[55:37] he tells me to do not that that
[55:40] diminishes what he said
[55:41] at all or what the fact of it is
[55:45] because everything he showed me and
[55:47] everything that i've mentioned to you he
[55:48] told me
[55:49] has happened and it's still happening
[55:51] actually too
[55:52] it has happened and it's still coming
[55:54] and it's still going on
[55:56] and and we can see it and it's become
[55:58] more prevalent
[55:59] and it's and it's gotten to the place
[56:02] that that's
[56:03] it's become so open with it so brazen
[56:05] with it
[56:06] that it happens out actually the
[56:09] corruption used to happen mostly behind
[56:11] closed doors nobody ever knew anything
[56:13] about it right but now there's no closed
[56:15] doors hardly anymore
[56:16] now obviously there's things that go on
[56:18] around us every day
[56:19] that if we knew what was happening it
[56:21] would really cringe us maybe but
[56:23] uh but a lot of that corruption is all
[56:25] out in the open yeah
[56:27] they just a lot of the times they just
[56:29] don't even care anymore
[56:30] uh news people will look in a camera and
[56:33] lie to you
[56:34] and don't care right right and when they
[56:36] get caught they don't apologize
[56:39] they don't because they just don't care
[56:41] and it just continues on and on and on
[56:43] like that
[56:44] and it and that's exactly what's behind
[56:47] all of this thing
[56:48] now look if you go back to the beginning
[56:50] let's let's
[56:51] let's go back to the beginning of this
[56:52] so i don't get ahead of myself
[56:54] revelation chapter 13 verse 1. now i'm
[56:57] not going to go through all the
[56:58] symbols and things like we did i went
[57:01] like i said through the whole scripture
[57:03] uh this whole
[57:04] chapter a year and a half ago or so so
[57:07] we won't get into all the
[57:08] things that give you little tidbits and
[57:11] stuff but we won't break this down like
[57:12] we did before but let's just read
[57:14] through
[57:14] because it helps us get us to where we
[57:16] are and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[57:19] and i saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[57:22] having seven heads ten horns
[57:24] and upon his horns ten crowns and upon
[57:27] his heads
[57:28] the name of blasphemy now we're talking
[57:30] about this beast
[57:32] this beast producing the mark of the
[57:35] beast
[57:36] this beast that's to rise up that's to
[57:38] take over and
[57:40] control most of humanity if not all of
[57:43] humanity at some point it will be all of
[57:45] humanity
[57:46] because the bride will be gone and the
[57:49] foolish virgin that's left
[57:50] will have to seal their testimony with
[57:52] their blood and he just takes
[57:54] over everything right of course then
[57:56] armageddon sets in and all but the beast
[57:58] is that beast that's that began here we
[58:00] see the beginning
[58:01] that rose up out of this out of the sea
[58:04] which we know
[58:05] is peoples multitudes peoples this is
[58:08] the beginning or the birth of that
[58:10] catholic church of that uh uh
[58:13] uh dominance that that rose up in
[58:16] europe uh almost 2 000 years ago right
[58:20] that came forth and this beast that rose
[58:22] up out of the people the people
[58:24] brought him forth the people caused it
[58:26] to be that way
[58:27] now it was it was that way because this
[58:30] beast
[58:31] by denotation of its characteristics of
[58:34] being a beast in itself
[58:36] will tell you that a beast is something
[58:39] that rules by
[58:40] fear and rules by dominance
[58:43] and rules by strength right because
[58:46] that's the very nature of a beast
[58:48] this beast and nature incarnate in not
[58:51] a man but in an office
[58:54] an office that different men have taken
[58:58] part
[58:58] in and we know you read in revelation 17
[59:01] where it says he was he was not he was
[59:04] he was not
[59:05] he dies and another one comes up dies
[59:07] and another one raises up he dies and
[59:08] another one raises up
[59:10] it's an office not a specific person
[59:12] right amen
[59:13] now it it it wiggles it way through
[59:16] to where at the end time there's going
[59:18] to be one who is the beast at the end
[59:21] that takes over and rules over the whole
[59:23] thing obviously
[59:25] but behind it uh as you read revelation
[59:28] 17
[59:29] that uh that beast is taking over that
[59:32] that church those people to dominate
[59:36] over them
[59:37] but it came out of the sea it came out
[59:39] of a place
[59:40] to where the people gave it it's it's
[59:43] its strength
[59:44] that gave it its ability to rule over
[59:47] them which is exactly what we do
[59:50] this this country does that to our
[59:51] government
[59:53] we the people have the power
[59:56] and we relinquish our power into the
[59:59] authority of
[1:00:00] men and women around the world that hold
[1:00:02] a political office
[1:00:04] we do that for the president vice
[1:00:06] president for
[1:00:07] uh senate for the house of
[1:00:09] representatives for
[1:00:10] our local members we vote
[1:00:13] we vote to put those people in so it's
[1:00:15] the people that
[1:00:16] give that person strength or authority
[1:00:20] to do what they do right now when they
[1:00:22] go awry
[1:00:23] and they start doing things that is
[1:00:25] detrimental to the people the people
[1:00:27] have a choice
[1:00:28] whether they want to vote that person
[1:00:30] out or not to get rid of that person
[1:00:32] that's their choice but in this case
[1:00:35] when that beast rose up
[1:00:37] there was no way to conquer that beast
[1:00:41] there was no way to overcome that beast
[1:00:44] because that beast had the
[1:00:46] uh had the uh the authority over it
[1:00:49] by the people and the people had become
[1:00:51] so
[1:00:52] uh tore down and defeated and overcome
[1:00:56] that that they were unable to rise up
[1:00:59] against it
[1:01:00] right so we'll just continue reading
[1:01:02] because here it says who is able to make
[1:01:04] war against the beast
[1:01:05] they weren't able to make war against
[1:01:07] them they weren't capable of building
[1:01:10] so because they weren't capable of doing
[1:01:12] it and there was no way of getting rid
[1:01:14] of him
[1:01:14] it's just it just continued to continued
[1:01:17] on and on
[1:01:18] but this beast came up out of the sea
[1:01:21] upon the santas he saw the beast rise up
[1:01:23] out of the people
[1:01:25] had the seven hands tens horns upon his
[1:01:27] head the names of blasphemy or
[1:01:30] as brother branham said blasphemous
[1:01:32] names
[1:01:33] again go back to revelation 17 you'll
[1:01:35] see the blasphemous names that brother
[1:01:37] branham was talking about you say
[1:01:39] what blasphemy blasphemous names are
[1:01:42] they
[1:01:43] any name now you can name all
[1:01:46] dominations whatever you want to name
[1:01:48] however you want to call them i don't
[1:01:49] whatever church i'm not going to do that
[1:01:51] but any name that supplants
[1:01:54] the name of jesus christ is a
[1:01:57] blasphemous name
[1:01:59] i don't care what you call it i don't
[1:02:00] care if it's catholic
[1:02:02] or some denomination or or a facet of
[1:02:04] the message or whatever
[1:02:06] charismatics or i don't it doesn't
[1:02:08] matter if
[1:02:09] it supplants the name of jesus christ
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:12] christ's authority over that church of
[1:02:15] those people that is a blasphemous name
[1:02:18] a church that tries to rule and dominate
[1:02:21] and take control over the people
[1:02:24] nicolaitan's spirit to dominate
[1:02:26] and control the people is a blasphemous
[1:02:29] name
[1:02:30] no matter what it is i don't care who it
[1:02:32] is i don't care if it's
[1:02:33] a person's name an individual's name
[1:02:36] pope priest potentate whoever it is
[1:02:38] if it takes precedent over jesus christ
[1:02:42] or tries to squash the name of jesus out
[1:02:45] it is a blasphemous name right right
[1:02:47] right right right right right right
[1:02:47] right right right amount amen
[1:02:49] that name's a blasphemy now brother
[1:02:51] brown talks about and calls them out of
[1:02:52] denominations and different things like
[1:02:54] that but the truth of it is
[1:02:55] what he was getting to the root is that
[1:02:57] if that it roots out
[1:02:59] what they do is root out christ right
[1:03:01] you root out
[1:03:02] christ you've got a blasphemous that's
[1:03:05] blasphemy
[1:03:07] in the eyes of god that's blasphemy now
[1:03:09] different churches and all have
[1:03:10] different
[1:03:11] ideas of heresy and blasphemy but
[1:03:13] rooting out christ
[1:03:14] is blasphemous when you get rid of jesus
[1:03:18] christ in any way or substitute for him
[1:03:20] that's blasphemy amen amen and the beast
[1:03:23] which i saw was like unto a leopard
[1:03:26] and if you want to we went through this
[1:03:28] daniel 7
[1:03:30] uh four through seven uh it describes
[1:03:33] this his feet were like as a leopard
[1:03:35] or excuse me the beast i saw was like a
[1:03:37] leopard and his feet were as a
[1:03:39] the feet of a bear his mouth is the
[1:03:41] mouth of a lion
[1:03:42] and the dragon gave him his power and
[1:03:45] his seat
[1:03:46] and great authority now the dragon you
[1:03:49] go to revelation 12
[1:03:50] again we went through this several
[1:03:53] services
[1:03:54] uh i think we took one service on one
[1:03:57] verse but just again paraphrase to get
[1:04:00] where we want to get
[1:04:01] if you go back to revelation 12 you find
[1:04:03] out who the dragon is
[1:04:05] red dragon red dragon uh satan
[1:04:09] uh uh um
[1:04:12] the devil whatever whatever name he's
[1:04:15] got several names
[1:04:16] uh in here and every one of them try to
[1:04:19] or blasphemous names to try to squash
[1:04:21] out the name of jesus
[1:04:22] right but notice this dragon revelation
[1:04:25] 12
[1:04:26] where did this dragon get his power
[1:04:30] where did the dragon get his power the
[1:04:32] dragon gave
[1:04:33] uh this beast power so where did the
[1:04:37] dragon get his power
[1:04:39] because he had to have power or
[1:04:41] authority
[1:04:42] to give to the beast he had to have it
[1:04:45] first to be able to give it
[1:04:47] if you guys if you don't have something
[1:04:48] you can't give it to somebody if you
[1:04:50] don't have it
[1:04:51] you can say i hope you get this or i
[1:04:52] impart this to you but if you don't have
[1:04:54] it you can't give it
[1:04:56] that that's the whole big flaw that
[1:04:57] people try even in the message sometimes
[1:04:59] that thinks that laying on of hands give
[1:05:01] people gifts
[1:05:02] no it doesn't that's a that is a a
[1:05:06] fallacy of a lot of the modern day
[1:05:10] teachings in christianity and the modern
[1:05:13] movement of
[1:05:14] charismatic churches and stuff they
[1:05:16] think you lay hands on and give them a
[1:05:17] gift no you don't
[1:05:19] you can't give somebody you don't have
[1:05:21] something you don't have am i
[1:05:22] now you can go to the scriptural part
[1:05:25] and you can lay hands on them
[1:05:26] and you can ordain them or recognize a
[1:05:29] specific gift to say i believe this gift
[1:05:32] is in you
[1:05:32] but you can't impart that gift to
[1:05:34] somebody if you don't have it and it's
[1:05:36] not yours to give in
[1:05:38] but if you go to revelation chapter 6
[1:05:41] you'll see
[1:05:42] where he gets his power the bible says
[1:05:46] twice revelation chapter 6 verse 4 and 8
[1:05:50] that it says that god gave
[1:05:53] power or power was given
[1:05:57] unto the beast do we need to read that
[1:06:00] i i don't i don't want to keep you too
[1:06:02] long today and i don't
[1:06:04] i'm not sure but if you go to chapter
[1:06:05] four look
[1:06:07] because this whole thing is dealing with
[1:06:09] the seals right this heals is history
[1:06:11] but now that or
[1:06:12] or most of the seals is history some of
[1:06:15] it's still coming
[1:06:16] but most of its history the church ages
[1:06:19] the rising up of the beast
[1:06:21] you see the the white horse the red
[1:06:23] horse the black horse the pale horse
[1:06:25] that's all that that that church riding
[1:06:28] out with the beast sitting on him
[1:06:30] conquering and to conquer or what did he
[1:06:32] do see first
[1:06:34] uh let's just read it real quick keep it
[1:06:36] in mind
[1:06:38] i saw the lamb open one of the seals i
[1:06:39] heard as it was the noise of thunder one
[1:06:41] of the four beasts saying come and see
[1:06:43] psalm beheld a white horse we're in
[1:06:45] revelation 6 now
[1:06:47] i hope i didn't lose you we're in
[1:06:49] revelation 6.
[1:06:52] and one of the four beasts saying come
[1:06:53] and see and i saw behold a white horse
[1:06:55] he said on him had a bow and a crown was
[1:06:57] given unto him
[1:06:58] and he went forth conquering him to
[1:07:00] conquer how can you conquer and
[1:07:01] conquer him without it without an arrow
[1:07:03] for your bow
[1:07:05] you can't conquer anybody without an
[1:07:07] arrow to go in your bow
[1:07:08] but a crown was given to him what's
[1:07:11] crown
[1:07:12] a crown is a is a diadem it is a
[1:07:16] state of authority over people right
[1:07:19] it's a state of of uh uh
[1:07:22] of your highness ship of being over
[1:07:25] people but this crown he didn't earn it
[1:07:29] he didn't deserve it it was just given
[1:07:31] to it right it was given to him a crown
[1:07:34] he had a bow so he's got some weaponry
[1:07:37] but he doesn't have an
[1:07:38] arrow but he takes his crown that was
[1:07:40] given to him
[1:07:42] going forth to conquer and to conquer
[1:07:44] and conquer
[1:07:45] to take over the people amen that's what
[1:07:48] his whole thing was to do
[1:07:49] to garner the wealth of the world
[1:07:51] because we'll get to that now
[1:07:53] but to conquer over the people how do
[1:07:55] you conquer the people he's not talking
[1:07:57] about
[1:07:57] killing them killing them with with a
[1:08:00] spiritual death but taking over them
[1:08:04] ruling over them nicolaitan
[1:08:08] go to the church ages revelation uh two
[1:08:11] three four
[1:08:12] two and three you can see the church
[1:08:14] ages where
[1:08:15] it starts out and how the conquering of
[1:08:17] that spirit takes over the people
[1:08:20] it pushes the people down through
[1:08:23] the early ages the catholic church would
[1:08:26] not even let
[1:08:26] the common person have the bible to read
[1:08:29] for themselves
[1:08:30] you just had to believe and accept
[1:08:32] whatever they told you
[1:08:34] and whatever they told you could be
[1:08:35] whatever they wanted it to be
[1:08:37] thus the property of the pope rising up
[1:08:40] basically saying well it has to be this
[1:08:43] way amen it's got to be this way
[1:08:45] and every catholic followed it didn't
[1:08:47] matter what it what the bible said
[1:08:49] the bible was irrelevant to those people
[1:08:51] right but then you had people come up
[1:08:53] and they started getting the bible and
[1:08:55] sometimes one by one they get the bible
[1:08:57] that the if they found out about it
[1:08:59] though now they'd burn them at the stake
[1:09:00] or they'd
[1:09:01] kill them in some way and destroy
[1:09:03] because they weren't supposed to do that
[1:09:05] they weren't supposed to have the bible
[1:09:06] they were just supposed to listen
[1:09:08] and obey whatever that priest was
[1:09:11] telling them
[1:09:12] whatever that pope declared and decreed
[1:09:14] that was it
[1:09:15] right no matter what the bible said
[1:09:17] whatever they said
[1:09:18] that's conquering they were conquering
[1:09:21] the people
[1:09:22] people say well there's a conquering of
[1:09:24] ministry over people no
[1:09:25] no not in the right ministry there's not
[1:09:27] right because there's no conquering
[1:09:30] because you're pointing people to jesus
[1:09:32] christ the word amen
[1:09:34] you're not giving people an ultimatum to
[1:09:36] say you have to believe me and listen to
[1:09:38] me and do what i say or else
[1:09:40] no i'm gonna read you quote a little bit
[1:09:41] later tell you exactly what kind of
[1:09:43] people those are right yes but a right
[1:09:46] kind of ministry
[1:09:47] actually leads people to jesus christ
[1:09:50] as they themselves are being led right
[1:09:52] and
[1:09:53] with christ to christ
[1:09:57] but this was to conquer the people
[1:09:59] conquer the laity
[1:10:01] and you're going to read the third
[1:10:02] church age second church age began
[1:10:04] well it began the first but the third
[1:10:06] one it really the the
[1:10:08] uh smarnia that myrrh was a bitter
[1:10:12] herb that was used to embalm people that
[1:10:15] died
[1:10:16] because that spirit had began to be
[1:10:18] rooted out of the church
[1:10:20] and the men the the the the people took
[1:10:23] over it
[1:10:23] the man took over the beast took over it
[1:10:26] conquering him to conquer now
[1:10:28] and when he had opened the second seal i
[1:10:30] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:10:32] and there went out another horse that
[1:10:34] was red and power
[1:10:36] was given to him power was given to him
[1:10:41] why was power well now who has power
[1:10:44] well we know the only power comes comes
[1:10:47] from the almighty god
[1:10:48] amen that's the only power that there is
[1:10:52] right i don't care who it's being
[1:10:53] utilized by
[1:10:55] i don't care who god has allowed to uh
[1:10:58] to use that authority but the only
[1:11:01] power that there is period is god's
[1:11:04] very bad that's all there is he said
[1:11:07] well someone so has power not without
[1:11:09] god he doesn't
[1:11:10] well you so your so-and-so utilizes that
[1:11:12] authority not without god he doesn't
[1:11:14] well so-and-so does this and this and
[1:11:16] the devil does this and this not without
[1:11:17] god's permission he doesn't
[1:11:19] right satan can't make one move without
[1:11:22] god's permission
[1:11:23] that's right period amen so who has the
[1:11:26] power
[1:11:27] almighty god right thank you all
[1:11:30] powerful god all knowing omnipotent
[1:11:34] omniscient all infinite
[1:11:37] all-knowing god only one
[1:11:41] so if there's power being given it's
[1:11:43] being given by god
[1:11:45] and he said power was given to him
[1:11:48] that sat there on to take peace from the
[1:11:51] earth that they should kill
[1:11:52] one another and it was given unto him a
[1:11:54] great sword
[1:11:56] and we know spiritually a sword is the
[1:11:58] word
[1:11:59] well why would god give him power
[1:12:01] authority to use the sword the word
[1:12:04] to conquer over people when he was to
[1:12:07] to kill the people and to destroy the
[1:12:09] people
[1:12:10] because you know friend that the same
[1:12:13] holy spirit
[1:12:14] that is our uh uh our life
[1:12:18] that that is our promised land
[1:12:22] it's our ticket to the rapture
[1:12:25] our token it's the same holy spirit
[1:12:28] that's going to condemn the unbeliever
[1:12:30] that's right it's life to us it's death
[1:12:33] to them amen
[1:12:34] it's like to the believer when god
[1:12:37] brings revelation
[1:12:39] it's death to the person who takes
[1:12:41] letter only
[1:12:43] and manipulates it hybrids it whatever
[1:12:45] they do to it
[1:12:46] and that's exactly what the catholic
[1:12:48] church of course had just said the bible
[1:12:49] didn't mean
[1:12:50] anything to them they just took excerpts
[1:12:52] at it made it whatever they wanted it to
[1:12:53] be
[1:12:54] that's how you got christmas and easter
[1:12:56] and a lot of all the things that they do
[1:12:58] the
[1:12:59] the repentance and the paying the priest
[1:13:02] for everything they do and you know the
[1:13:04] the purgatory and all those things those
[1:13:08] all things just those just catholic
[1:13:09] dogma
[1:13:10] right that's not scriptural nothing
[1:13:12] scriptural to that it's just catholic
[1:13:13] dogma
[1:13:14] a lot of it came from pagan rome yeah
[1:13:18] which was the beast that was over at
[1:13:20] that time
[1:13:21] was rome romanism
[1:13:24] but let's continue here given power
[1:13:27] given a sword and when he had opened the
[1:13:30] third seal i heard a third beast say
[1:13:31] come and see
[1:13:32] and i beheld and lord my course it said
[1:13:34] on him had a pair of balances in his
[1:13:36] hand again
[1:13:37] of getting the wealth of the world and i
[1:13:39] heard a voice in the midst
[1:13:41] of the four beasts now this isn't a
[1:13:43] beast this is a voice in the midst
[1:13:46] of the beast see
[1:13:49] uh uh in the midst say a measure of
[1:13:52] wheat for a penny three measures of body
[1:13:54] for a penny see thou hurt not the oil
[1:13:56] and wine
[1:13:57] that's jesus christ in the middle of the
[1:14:00] candlesticks
[1:14:01] crying out saying okay you've been given
[1:14:05] power you've been given authority
[1:14:07] you're weighing out the wealth of the
[1:14:08] world uh well uh
[1:14:10] prayers for this money and weddings for
[1:14:12] this money and and
[1:14:14] uh pendants for this money and and uh
[1:14:16] indulgences for this money
[1:14:18] in other words indulgence you can go
[1:14:20] live and do whatever you want
[1:14:22] just come back to the priest pay him a
[1:14:23] little bit of money and the priest will
[1:14:25] give you an indulgence
[1:14:26] and that will save you so you can go to
[1:14:27] heaven anyway so you go to the bar and
[1:14:30] get drunk and come back so i want a
[1:14:31] penance
[1:14:32] i want i want uh one of the indulgences
[1:14:35] the priest said you pay him enough money
[1:14:37] and give you indulgence and you can go
[1:14:38] and live however you want to live
[1:14:39] right it doesn't matter you come to a
[1:14:42] booth and say
[1:14:43] i had a catholic friend in north
[1:14:45] carolina
[1:14:46] he's my boss at one time and we were
[1:14:49] going down the road riding and i got to
[1:14:51] challenge about the catholic faith
[1:14:53] and i said well what about the this uh
[1:14:56] confessing to the priests i said now the
[1:14:58] bible says
[1:14:59] confess your faults one to another but
[1:15:01] that's not a priest in a booth
[1:15:03] right but it doesn't say confess your
[1:15:05] sin to be absolved of sin it just says
[1:15:07] confess your faults
[1:15:09] right if i confess confess my fault to
[1:15:11] you that i have
[1:15:12] a frailty in my life uh a weak spot that
[1:15:16] i want you to pray for me that gets
[1:15:18] strengthened
[1:15:19] that's the way the bible works but i'm
[1:15:20] not going to tell you i did this and
[1:15:22] this and this and
[1:15:23] and you absolve me of that right he said
[1:15:26] well it came from here and peter and
[1:15:28] peter was given the keys to the kingdom
[1:15:29] of heaven whatsoever on earth was bound
[1:15:32] in heaven
[1:15:32] i said but you you catholic church has
[1:15:35] taken that
[1:15:36] and monopolized it to to give people the
[1:15:38] power to actually step in the place
[1:15:41] of jesus christ right amen now i forgive
[1:15:44] you
[1:15:45] you forgive me we forgive one another
[1:15:47] but it's up to jesus christ that
[1:15:49] determines
[1:15:50] where it goes from there we go to heaven
[1:15:52] or whatever
[1:15:54] he he decides or determines see that's
[1:15:56] up to him
[1:15:57] that's his choice and i said well what
[1:15:59] are you going to do
[1:16:01] if you just set a cuss word to somebody
[1:16:03] on the street and you're going down the
[1:16:04] road and all of a sudden this truck is
[1:16:06] wrapped around the tree and you're dead
[1:16:08] where's your priest right where's your
[1:16:10] confession booth
[1:16:12] where is your indulgence then are you
[1:16:14] going to die
[1:16:15] center as you're headed 70 miles an hour
[1:16:19] toward that telephone pole you're going
[1:16:20] to say god forgive me or
[1:16:22] or pope forgive me or mary forgive me or
[1:16:25] whatever
[1:16:26] wait it's not there that's right the
[1:16:29] fallacy of it all
[1:16:30] but see all that stuff coming because
[1:16:32] we're gathering the wealth
[1:16:34] of the world gathering the the the
[1:16:35] people's conquering over the people and
[1:16:38] taking control over their lives
[1:16:39] and garnering the wealth of the world
[1:16:41] right amen brother man said nobody else
[1:16:43] could do it
[1:16:45] amen the wealth of the world nobody else
[1:16:47] could do it but where the vatican
[1:16:49] the pope garnering the wealth of the
[1:16:52] world
[1:16:52] but he said don't you dare touch my
[1:16:54] people now
[1:16:55] amen you worried about covert friend
[1:16:58] jesus already told him don't you touch
[1:17:00] my old and wine
[1:17:01] right here amen forget kova that's just
[1:17:03] a little
[1:17:04] a little toy in the sandbox for the
[1:17:06] devil forget about that
[1:17:08] jesus already said don't you touch my
[1:17:10] people amen now if you don't believe
[1:17:12] you're one of his
[1:17:13] now you might have a problem right
[1:17:15] that's right if you don't think you're
[1:17:16] one of jesus christ then you might have
[1:17:18] a problem
[1:17:19] but if you belong to christ this is to
[1:17:22] you
[1:17:22] right yeah don't you worry about that
[1:17:25] that's exactly the fear that
[1:17:27] satan has used to try to gain or garner
[1:17:29] control over the people
[1:17:31] right to scare them to death
[1:17:34] yeah it's just like uh
[1:17:37] they did in the dark ages if you
[1:17:40] if you have a bible and read this is
[1:17:42] what's going to happen to you
[1:17:44] and then take them out in town square
[1:17:45] they wouldn't privately persecute them
[1:17:47] they'd take them out in town square and
[1:17:49] they'd timed the elephants or something
[1:17:51] and rip them in half
[1:17:52] or burn them at the stake it was a great
[1:17:55] event to burn somebody at the state back
[1:17:57] then
[1:17:57] people got there applauded and carried
[1:18:00] on because somebody was getting burned
[1:18:02] at the stake
[1:18:02] right amen they said now look now
[1:18:06] if you don't obey that's what's going to
[1:18:08] happen to you what do you think that is
[1:18:11] that's the exact same fear the devil's
[1:18:12] using today right
[1:18:14] to try to garner control over you
[1:18:17] over god's people but jesus has already
[1:18:20] told him
[1:18:22] jesus already told satan don't you touch
[1:18:24] my people now amen
[1:18:26] amen don't you touch my holy wine
[1:18:31] i believe it amen when you open the
[1:18:34] forest hill i heard the fourth beast say
[1:18:35] come and see
[1:18:36] i looked and behold a pale horse his
[1:18:38] name that said on him was death and hell
[1:18:40] followed with him
[1:18:41] and power was given unto him over the
[1:18:43] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[1:18:45] the sword and with hunger
[1:18:46] and with death and with the beasts of
[1:18:48] the earth now it's quite the
[1:18:50] understanding when you go back to
[1:18:52] revelation 13
[1:18:54] and you see what he talks about the
[1:18:56] beast which
[1:18:57] takes us back to daniel with the with
[1:19:00] the leopard the feet of the bear the
[1:19:01] mouth of the lion
[1:19:03] and the dragon giving him his power
[1:19:06] where to get that power well we see
[1:19:08] where he got the power
[1:19:09] the bible tells us right it's not
[1:19:11] something we have to guess about
[1:19:13] we know where he got it god gave it to
[1:19:16] him
[1:19:16] it's the only way he can get it right
[1:19:18] just like in the garden of eden see
[1:19:20] we got to understand the dragon and the
[1:19:23] beast are two different entities
[1:19:25] right just like just like the serpent
[1:19:28] and the devil are two separate entities
[1:19:31] i've heard people talk about the
[1:19:33] the serpent like that was the devil the
[1:19:35] serpent wasn't the devil that's true
[1:19:36] amen the serpent was an animal created
[1:19:38] by god
[1:19:39] right the the devil got in the serpent
[1:19:43] and used the serpent to do his devilish
[1:19:46] deeds
[1:19:46] just like he does a lot of people still
[1:19:48] today just like he does here
[1:19:51] that dragon gets in the beast just to
[1:19:53] perform his deadly deeds
[1:19:56] that's the only reason but that power
[1:20:00] and authority was given to him
[1:20:04] third verse now we're back in revelation
[1:20:06] 13.
[1:20:08] third verse and i saw one of his heads
[1:20:12] now
[1:20:13] as it were wounded to death one of his
[1:20:16] heads was wounded to death the fall of
[1:20:18] rome
[1:20:19] when rome took that deadly blow and rome
[1:20:22] fell
[1:20:23] there had to be something come forth
[1:20:26] after that
[1:20:27] after rome took over what did the devil
[1:20:29] do
[1:20:30] he said that deadly wound was healed
[1:20:33] how was that deadly wound healed the
[1:20:36] deadly wound was
[1:20:37] healed by the transferring of
[1:20:40] pagan rome to paparam right
[1:20:44] when the pagan rome had received that
[1:20:46] deadly blow
[1:20:47] and rome fell constantine came in
[1:20:51] and was able to take it over and bring
[1:20:53] christianity
[1:20:54] into it and and manipulate and
[1:20:58] and cause that to be all married in
[1:21:00] together
[1:21:01] just like balaam told the children of
[1:21:03] israel oh we're all one just marrying
[1:21:05] together it's going to be okay we're
[1:21:07] just one group of people
[1:21:08] no they weren't they weren't here either
[1:21:12] right but the people did it anyway
[1:21:15] intermingled and married in together
[1:21:17] and pagan rome became papal rome
[1:21:20] but pagan rome then then through to to
[1:21:23] satisfy the pagans
[1:21:24] they said well we'll just we'll just
[1:21:26] take over this sun
[1:21:28] god's day that we served as pagans and
[1:21:30] heathens
[1:21:31] and we'll just call it the son of god's
[1:21:33] day right
[1:21:34] and they made that christmas right
[1:21:38] december 25th the worship of the pagan
[1:21:41] son
[1:21:42] god's day they turned into the day of
[1:21:44] the birth of jesus
[1:21:46] so they tried to pacify just like you do
[1:21:48] today
[1:21:50] tried to pacify the pagans and the
[1:21:52] christians
[1:21:53] but they were never supposed to be
[1:21:54] mingled amen they were never supposed to
[1:21:57] be one group
[1:21:58] but the people lost their identity and
[1:22:01] when they lost their identity they came
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:03] molded themselves up into that place and
[1:22:05] you see on the church ages when brother
[1:22:08] branham when they get drawn out
[1:22:09] brother branham draws them when the holy
[1:22:11] spirit drew them on the wall at the
[1:22:12] tabernacle
[1:22:13] you see each one is just a little less
[1:22:16] light every age
[1:22:18] there's a little less each time right
[1:22:20] because as
[1:22:21] as those ages went along the true bride
[1:22:24] died out
[1:22:26] it went away you know brother graham
[1:22:28] said the end of this age
[1:22:29] was completely blacked out right but god
[1:22:32] the holy spirit allowed brother branham
[1:22:35] to put a little sliver of light in it
[1:22:37] because of you and me right yeah because
[1:22:39] of the bride that will be here at this
[1:22:41] last time
[1:22:42] waiting on a rapture only a little bit
[1:22:44] of light that there is friend
[1:22:46] amen and it's just a sliver it that that
[1:22:49] light at the end you go look at it as it
[1:22:51] was drawn just a sliver
[1:22:53] you look at that whole moon that is
[1:22:56] blacked out completely but that little
[1:22:58] bit of sliver
[1:22:59] you know what that means that means that
[1:23:01] we're just that small
[1:23:02] group that little remnant that god has
[1:23:05] at this last
[1:23:06] end that this alive and remain group i
[1:23:08] call us at the end
[1:23:09] it's just that just that little bit of
[1:23:11] light there that's here
[1:23:13] what was happening through the dark ages
[1:23:15] it was mostly
[1:23:16] it was mostly white when it started but
[1:23:18] then it blacked out and blacked out and
[1:23:20] blacked out as the devil
[1:23:21] took control over them and and pagan
[1:23:24] rome became papal wrong
[1:23:26] and they had the nicaea council and they
[1:23:28] crowned the pope and they allowed the
[1:23:29] pope to come in
[1:23:30] and they had great divisions because of
[1:23:32] what the catholic church
[1:23:34] did but in recent years
[1:23:37] those have uh they have reconciled a lot
[1:23:40] of their differences
[1:23:42] i showed you a video a couple years ago
[1:23:44] or so
[1:23:45] where it showed the pope and kenneth
[1:23:47] copeland yes i'll say his name
[1:23:49] yeah amen praising the pope and telling
[1:23:52] his congregation to worship
[1:23:54] under that and that they were all one
[1:23:56] together and they were all coming
[1:23:57] together again
[1:23:59] i also told you the rabbi that was
[1:24:01] responsible for that
[1:24:02] died in a car crow motorcycle crashed
[1:24:05] not long after that video
[1:24:06] right died amen
[1:24:10] why because god's in control
[1:24:14] but did that stop it oh no that didn't
[1:24:16] stop it
[1:24:17] it's still going on it's getting even
[1:24:19] it's gaining even more strength and
[1:24:21] fervor well what's happened to these
[1:24:23] people that'll sit there and appew
[1:24:25] and worship or praise the pope they've
[1:24:28] lost their identity
[1:24:30] they've lost their way i mean if they
[1:24:32] were ever christians to begin with
[1:24:34] the problem we've got today is we have
[1:24:37] too many part-time christians
[1:24:40] we have too many people that think
[1:24:41] they're christians and too many
[1:24:43] weak back pulpit uh preachers behind the
[1:24:46] pulpit that won't preach the word
[1:24:48] amen and tell the people and let them
[1:24:51] know
[1:24:52] that's right and they go home thinking
[1:24:53] everything's okay and it's not
[1:24:56] he's got a church load of people headed
[1:24:58] to hell
[1:24:59] and it's his fault because he won't call
[1:25:01] out the word the way it's supposed to be
[1:25:04] preached
[1:25:04] but there's only a sliver there's just
[1:25:07] that sliver friend
[1:25:08] i'm just thankful to god that we can be
[1:25:10] a part of that sliver
[1:25:12] that little bit of light you think how
[1:25:14] can this deception come
[1:25:16] because the people have sold their
[1:25:18] birthrights
[1:25:19] the people have lost their identity the
[1:25:22] people that give in to this
[1:25:24] laodicea age of my rights and my and me
[1:25:27] first and all they care about is me
[1:25:31] my for no more my little group
[1:25:35] what what we're doing what's going on
[1:25:37] here friend god is going doing something
[1:25:40] far beyond this little building
[1:25:42] far beyond this little ministry and us
[1:25:44] few people
[1:25:46] it's gone international around the world
[1:25:49] because god i believe
[1:25:50] is uniting his bride together under the
[1:25:53] auspice of the shed blood of jesus
[1:25:55] christ and this revealed word of the
[1:25:56] hour
[1:25:57] and he's bringing her together in a
[1:25:59] place that one of these days our loved
[1:26:01] ones are going to start appearing and
[1:26:03] god's going to call them we're going to
[1:26:04] go home to meet him amen
[1:26:06] amen we're right at hand this is
[1:26:09] happening
[1:26:10] now i don't know how long much longer we
[1:26:13] have friend
[1:26:14] right it could take years yet i don't
[1:26:16] know
[1:26:17] it may take minutes hours days months i
[1:26:21] don't know
[1:26:22] right but i know it's here yes i know
[1:26:24] that we won't know the day or the hour
[1:26:26] but i believe we'll know the time the
[1:26:28] season if you will
[1:26:29] and we're in that season we are in the
[1:26:32] season of the coming of the lord
[1:26:34] to quote a song title in the season of
[1:26:37] the coming of the lord
[1:26:38] amen it's now we see what's happening
[1:26:41] it's more prevalent than it ever has
[1:26:44] been
[1:26:44] yes because there's always been an
[1:26:46] uprising or something to
[1:26:48] counter when the devil would come and
[1:26:50] try
[1:26:52] to infiltrate that or take over that
[1:26:54] there's always been an uprising
[1:26:56] it's always been something to to counter
[1:26:59] that
[1:27:00] right and we know that scripture because
[1:27:02] the bible says when the enemy comes in
[1:27:03] like a flood you'll raise another
[1:27:05] standard
[1:27:06] but now that doesn't just apply to
[1:27:07] christendom that applies to the bride
[1:27:09] today
[1:27:10] her personal life because as brother tom
[1:27:13] had prayed
[1:27:14] we know where this is headed we know
[1:27:16] where this is going
[1:27:18] right they talk about the prosperity and
[1:27:20] the blessings and the peace and all
[1:27:22] these things
[1:27:22] but we know in the midst of all those
[1:27:25] little things where this
[1:27:26] is headed and there's always been that
[1:27:29] little uprising
[1:27:30] always that little something to take
[1:27:32] over and conquer it
[1:27:33] and to have a a move of god powerful and
[1:27:37] strong to sweep across the nation or
[1:27:39] across the world
[1:27:40] but brother brown told us the revivals
[1:27:42] are over that's right
[1:27:44] but the international sweeping revivals
[1:27:47] are over right that's right well if the
[1:27:48] international sweeping revival
[1:27:50] 60 years ago was over then where are
[1:27:53] they today
[1:27:55] right they're over amen so then where is
[1:27:58] the revival in the brother you're
[1:28:00] looking at him
[1:28:02] turn around and look at one another find
[1:28:04] the mirror you are that revival amen
[1:28:07] you are that revival no more great
[1:28:09] sweeping revivals
[1:28:10] that little sliver can't make a great
[1:28:12] sweeping revival but internationally
[1:28:14] that bride's coming together and
[1:28:16] there'll be people i've never met in my
[1:28:18] life
[1:28:18] never spoke to people of different
[1:28:20] people tongue kindred nation
[1:28:22] we'll all gather together on that on
[1:28:24] that shore one day
[1:28:25] amen we'll meet the lord in the air i
[1:28:26] amen go to a wedding supper of the lamb
[1:28:30] we're at that place but let me continue
[1:28:33] because i want to get to this last part
[1:28:34] and there's a few things i want to
[1:28:35] mention to you
[1:28:37] and time of course sorry they worshipped
[1:28:40] the dragon which gave him power
[1:28:43] okay let me go back to the third verse
[1:28:45] now the the the wound he had the wound
[1:28:47] to death pagan rome
[1:28:49] the womb was healed papal roam and all
[1:28:52] the world wondered after the beast
[1:28:54] why because he because he gathered in
[1:28:56] the pagans and the christians
[1:28:57] right now what's what's the pope doing
[1:28:59] today
[1:29:01] got the most popular the not just the
[1:29:04] most popular do you realize
[1:29:06] we don't only have you go and look at
[1:29:08] statistics
[1:29:09] we do not only have the most popular
[1:29:11] pope ever
[1:29:12] we have the most popular individual
[1:29:15] internationally
[1:29:17] today is the pope the most popular
[1:29:21] singular individual drawing breath today
[1:29:24] is the pope
[1:29:26] amen what's he done he's reached out to
[1:29:28] this group and pulled him in
[1:29:30] he's reached out to this group and
[1:29:31] pulled him in reached out over here
[1:29:33] pulled him in i think even muslims
[1:29:35] there's only like 20
[1:29:37] of muslims that disapprove of the pope
[1:29:40] one of the greatest approval ratings the
[1:29:43] pope gets is from the jews
[1:29:45] which shouldn't surprise us considering
[1:29:47] they're supposed to make a covenant by
[1:29:49] the time we get out of here
[1:29:51] right amen well of course they got to
[1:29:54] come together
[1:29:55] of course it's got to be that way see
[1:29:57] people can't they can't see the
[1:29:59] scripture no they're blind
[1:30:01] they're blind to see that they don't
[1:30:03] know a message they haven't seen a
[1:30:04] prophet they don't know what the word
[1:30:06] tells them
[1:30:07] amen people get distracted with all the
[1:30:09] little things that brother madam says on
[1:30:11] the side they get to the word of god
[1:30:13] you realize this is what's happening you
[1:30:15] told us 60 50 60 70 years ago
[1:30:18] right amen oh praise the lord amen
[1:30:22] all the world wandered after the beast
[1:30:25] and they worshiped the dragon
[1:30:28] which gave power unto the beast now look
[1:30:30] they're not worshiping the pope
[1:30:32] well they are they're not worshiping
[1:30:34] that church although they are
[1:30:35] they're not worshiping that denomination
[1:30:37] or that system
[1:30:39] though they are yeah all of that worship
[1:30:42] that comes from there goes right
[1:30:44] straight to the dragon
[1:30:46] to the beat to the to the devil to satan
[1:30:49] right that's exactly who they're
[1:30:50] worshipping they say oh we're worshiping
[1:30:52] in our
[1:30:53] in our church or not our denomination or
[1:30:55] our system or our denomination whatever
[1:30:57] we're worshiping this no you're
[1:30:58] worshiping the devil right
[1:31:00] if you're not worshiping god you're
[1:31:02] worshiping the devil and if you're not
[1:31:03] worshiping in spirit and in
[1:31:05] truth you're worshiping the devil yes
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:12] now he says they worship the dragon
[1:31:15] who gave power to the beast and they
[1:31:17] worshiped the beast
[1:31:19] saying who is like unto the beast who is
[1:31:21] able to make
[1:31:22] war with him amen no one
[1:31:26] no one and there was given unto my mouth
[1:31:29] speaking great things of blasphemy power
[1:31:31] was given
[1:31:32] power was given unto him to continue the
[1:31:35] 40 in two months
[1:31:37] now that power that he had there that
[1:31:40] continues on
[1:31:41] now this jumps over this scripture
[1:31:43] actually jumps over to the scripture we
[1:31:45] just read
[1:31:46] mark of the beast in 42 months is the
[1:31:48] tribute is the tribulation as
[1:31:50] a as the last three and a half years of
[1:31:52] daniel 70 weeks
[1:31:53] right that's the 42 months you go back
[1:31:55] to revelation 11
[1:31:57] you find that jesus talks about the word
[1:31:59] talks about the
[1:32:00] two witnesses of revelation 11 to the
[1:32:02] jews moses and elijah brother brown tell
[1:32:04] us
[1:32:05] moses and elijah in revelation 11 so
[1:32:07] three and a half years 42 months is
[1:32:09] three and a half years
[1:32:11] but that power was given so that he
[1:32:13] continues on
[1:32:15] this the scripture is telling us it
[1:32:17] doesn't come to an
[1:32:18] end it doesn't stop
[1:32:21] at a certain point it continues on even
[1:32:23] through tradition
[1:32:25] even through the tribulation even
[1:32:28] through that period of time even after
[1:32:29] the bride's gone
[1:32:31] in fact when the bride's gone it'll get
[1:32:32] even harder worse
[1:32:34] oh yeah talk about love brother tom
[1:32:37] there'll be no love when this bride's
[1:32:38] gone there'll be no love
[1:32:41] amen because she's the only love there
[1:32:43] is that's right the only love of god
[1:32:45] right there's probably going to be an
[1:32:46] over abundance of filio
[1:32:48] lust love but the love of god is going
[1:32:51] to be gone
[1:32:51] amen and he opened his mouth and
[1:32:54] blasphemed me against god to blaspheme
[1:32:56] his name and his tabernacle and them
[1:32:58] that dwell
[1:32:59] in heaven now how did he do that by
[1:33:01] manipulating the word
[1:33:02] by hydrating the word and it was given
[1:33:05] to him to make war with the saints and
[1:33:07] to overcome them the dark ages
[1:33:10] power was given unto him over kindreds
[1:33:12] tongues and nations
[1:33:13] amen through the dark ages all that
[1:33:15] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[1:33:17] whose names are not written in the book
[1:33:19] of life the lamb slain from the
[1:33:20] foundation foundational world so those
[1:33:21] whose names
[1:33:23] not on the lamb's book of life put on
[1:33:25] there
[1:33:26] by god before the foundation of the
[1:33:28] world right
[1:33:29] everyone else will worship that beast
[1:33:32] yes
[1:33:33] everyone else will worship that dragon
[1:33:35] the only ones that won't
[1:33:37] are those whose names are on that lamb's
[1:33:38] book of life that sliver
[1:33:40] this last day this end time that sliver
[1:33:43] of light
[1:33:45] all the rest of it is going to worship
[1:33:46] the beast all the rest of it
[1:33:50] if any man have any or let him hear he
[1:33:51] that leadeth into captivity go into
[1:33:53] captivity he that killeth with the sword
[1:33:55] must be killed with the sword
[1:33:57] here is the patience and the faith of
[1:33:59] the saints and i beheld another beast
[1:34:01] coming out of the earth
[1:34:02] and he had two horns like a lamb and he
[1:34:05] spake as a dragon spake
[1:34:06] as a dragon now this beast come out of
[1:34:10] the earth
[1:34:10] talking about the world of the united
[1:34:13] states this country
[1:34:14] there wasn't a bunch of people here but
[1:34:16] when those people came
[1:34:18] over they began to form this beast that
[1:34:21] was there
[1:34:21] that didn't come out of the people now
[1:34:24] but came out of earth
[1:34:26] now instead of the power that the
[1:34:28] original beast had
[1:34:30] which was a conglomeration of of church
[1:34:32] and state
[1:34:34] because over in england and over in the
[1:34:35] old country the church and state were
[1:34:37] married together they were blended they
[1:34:39] were one
[1:34:40] you had the power of one you got the
[1:34:42] power of the other but
[1:34:43] here we have a lamb a little lamb a
[1:34:46] little innocent lamb because we had
[1:34:47] freedom of religion and we had the
[1:34:49] constitution and we had the bill of
[1:34:51] rights and
[1:34:51] all those things are great although a
[1:34:53] lot of people today would just assume
[1:34:54] burn that
[1:34:55] uh or they misinterpret it right that
[1:34:58] we had all those freedom of religion and
[1:35:01] not freedom from religion but freedom of
[1:35:03] religion which the devil has used to
[1:35:05] come against us with well if it's
[1:35:07] freedom of religion then you've got to
[1:35:09] have this this this too
[1:35:11] you got to have muhammad you got to have
[1:35:13] buddhas and you've got to have
[1:35:14] uh all all the other religions muslims
[1:35:17] hindus you've got to have all these
[1:35:18] other religions and freedom of religion
[1:35:20] right well i have a religion
[1:35:22] my religion is to pick my toe that's my
[1:35:24] religion you got to accept me for that
[1:35:26] in fact you ought to be teaching it in
[1:35:28] school
[1:35:30] right how to play how to pick your toe
[1:35:31] right because that's my religion see
[1:35:32] because you can make a religion out of
[1:35:34] anything
[1:35:35] right people are doing it today
[1:35:38] they're calling themselves informing
[1:35:40] non-profit or
[1:35:42] corporations out of uh wear black shoe
[1:35:44] day or
[1:35:46] just crazy stuff uh goddesses and
[1:35:50] entities and all kinds of things they
[1:35:52] make churches that the church of the
[1:35:53] devil
[1:35:54] satan satan worshipers organized well if
[1:35:57] you're going to recognize this religion
[1:35:59] you've got to recognize this religion
[1:36:02] and and by the way why don't you take
[1:36:05] out everything that has to do with god
[1:36:07] when it comes to our government too
[1:36:09] take the bibles out of school of course
[1:36:10] no prayer because there's freedom of
[1:36:12] religion see
[1:36:13] if and if you're gonna do this you gotta
[1:36:16] you gotta you gotta have the koran in
[1:36:17] there and you gotta have the
[1:36:18] devil bible whatever you gotta have all
[1:36:21] these other
[1:36:22] religions everything in there see
[1:36:25] and and you might as well destroy every
[1:36:27] monument
[1:36:29] and every uh thing that he alludes to
[1:36:32] god
[1:36:32] and talks about the bible and
[1:36:33] christianity oh because if you do that
[1:36:36] you got to give me a chance too because
[1:36:37] i believe in
[1:36:38] uh worshiping some crazy person you know
[1:36:42] whatever their god is amen freedom of
[1:36:45] religion that's exactly what
[1:36:47] that's exactly how the devil has
[1:36:49] manipulated that but you understand the
[1:36:51] the the
[1:36:52] this lamb the innocency of it coming in
[1:36:55] it didn't come in
[1:36:57] like it came in in the old country in
[1:36:59] europe and
[1:37:00] it didn't come in with the conquering
[1:37:02] and the power and destroying
[1:37:04] not coming like a lamb and this lamb had
[1:37:07] two horns
[1:37:09] it was civil and ecclesiastical
[1:37:12] it was church and state they weren't
[1:37:15] married together when they came here
[1:37:17] man those forefathers put in that
[1:37:19] constitution that they were to be
[1:37:20] separate
[1:37:21] amen the church and state are to be
[1:37:23] separate they're not to have anything to
[1:37:25] do one with the other they're both
[1:37:27] separate entities the church is its own
[1:37:29] thing and the government is its own
[1:37:30] thing
[1:37:31] and the two shall not meet although
[1:37:34] there's tons of muddy areas today where
[1:37:36] they do
[1:37:37] they just won't acknowledge it because
[1:37:39] you've got
[1:37:40] running the thing anyway and i'm not
[1:37:43] talking about just the president i'm
[1:37:44] talking about everything around the
[1:37:45] world
[1:37:46] right we actually have a president now
[1:37:48] who'll be
[1:37:49] president for 18 more days seven more
[1:37:51] days that actually declared he was
[1:37:53] himself he
[1:37:54] declared himself as a non-denominational
[1:37:57] christian
[1:37:58] first time i've ever known a a president
[1:38:01] say that we're non-denominational
[1:38:02] christian or anybody
[1:38:03] in government i i found it dug up i
[1:38:06] probably wouldn't be able to get to this
[1:38:07] today
[1:38:08] but the things that was happening behind
[1:38:10] the back door
[1:38:11] of the devil coming in and the beast
[1:38:14] taking over
[1:38:14] and what pope francis has done to
[1:38:17] organize and to
[1:38:18] bring these back together and to start
[1:38:20] the ecumenical council
[1:38:22] which brother banham told us was the
[1:38:24] mark of the beast
[1:38:26] this mark of the beast is is
[1:38:29] the ecumenical council because he said
[1:38:31] of this image to the beast
[1:38:33] the image to the excuse me not the mark
[1:38:34] the image to the beast is the ecumenical
[1:38:36] council
[1:38:37] the mark of the beast comes from those
[1:38:39] denominations
[1:38:40] in fact they are the mark of the beast
[1:38:42] to accept their doctrine to
[1:38:44] fellowship to accept it in your head is
[1:38:46] the mark in your head
[1:38:47] to accepting the fellowship into the
[1:38:49] into that marcus to receive it in your
[1:38:51] hand
[1:38:51] people worried about barcodes and all
[1:38:53] this stuff on my hands and tattoos and
[1:38:55] things
[1:38:55] i'm not worried about a tattoo or
[1:38:57] barcode i'm worried about making sure
[1:38:59] and accepting the pure
[1:39:00] unadulterated word of god for this hour
[1:39:03] amen that's what my concern is
[1:39:05] and fellowship only with those of like
[1:39:07] precious faith
[1:39:08] amen that believe in the same not the
[1:39:11] others that go out and say well i
[1:39:12] believe in
[1:39:13] the baptism in the name of the lord
[1:39:14] jesus christ of baptism father son the
[1:39:16] holy ghost makes no difference
[1:39:17] oh don't you fellowship with that that's
[1:39:19] the mark of the beast
[1:39:20] oh i believe we can come in together and
[1:39:23] and we can take communion together and
[1:39:24] we can
[1:39:25] you know just do it my way by process
[1:39:28] and i'll take the eucharist says that's
[1:39:30] the holy ghost yeah that's the mark of
[1:39:31] the beast
[1:39:31] amen that's the mark of the beast that's
[1:39:34] right our baptism brother the same
[1:39:36] aren't we brothers
[1:39:38] same thing balaam said it's happening
[1:39:40] today
[1:39:41] amen but this said back in 2016
[1:39:47] that the united states supreme court is
[1:39:49] made up of five roman catholics and
[1:39:51] three jews
[1:39:53] you know that has changed now that three
[1:39:56] supreme court justices have been
[1:39:58] appointed in the past four years by
[1:39:59] president trump
[1:40:01] guess what denomination all three of his
[1:40:04] nominations are
[1:40:06] good catholic now there are
[1:40:10] seven out of nine supreme court justices
[1:40:13] that are catholic
[1:40:14] seven out of nine the other two are
[1:40:17] jewish
[1:40:18] the other two you don't hear from very
[1:40:19] much either i think it's bradley and
[1:40:21] kagan or
[1:40:22] those seven of the nine are roman
[1:40:24] catholics now
[1:40:26] the vice president says he's catholic
[1:40:28] the coming in
[1:40:29] uh pr president says he's catholic the
[1:40:32] head of the
[1:40:33] the minority leader of the senate says
[1:40:35] he's catholic the speaker of the house
[1:40:37] says she's catholic
[1:40:39] where are we at right amen
[1:40:43] these two horns like a like a lamb but
[1:40:46] it spoke
[1:40:47] like the dragon the devil
[1:40:50] and he exercised all the power of the
[1:40:52] first peace before him and caused the
[1:40:54] earth
[1:40:55] and then that dwelt therein to worship
[1:40:56] the first beast whose deadly wound was
[1:40:58] healed
[1:40:59] and he doeth great wonders so that make
[1:41:01] it fire come down from heaven and on
[1:41:03] earth in the sight of man and deceived
[1:41:05] them
[1:41:05] that dwell on earth by the means of
[1:41:07] those miracles which he had power to do
[1:41:08] in the sight of the beast because he had
[1:41:10] power because god gave it to him
[1:41:12] saying saying to them that dwell on the
[1:41:14] earth that they should make an
[1:41:15] image to the beast the ecumenical
[1:41:17] council
[1:41:18] the council of churches which had the
[1:41:20] wound
[1:41:21] a wound by the sword and did live you
[1:41:24] know revelation 17
[1:41:26] they all come together yes you shall ask
[1:41:28] economical accounts as the beast says
[1:41:30] god the church know that everyone
[1:41:32] all the little harlots that that spawn
[1:41:34] off of mother
[1:41:35] all come back to her again revelation
[1:41:37] 17.
[1:41:38] they all come and make one big image to
[1:41:41] the beast
[1:41:42] which is what did i mean you couldn't
[1:41:43] see it any more prominently in that
[1:41:45] video that i showed you
[1:41:47] with the with copeland and the pope
[1:41:49] coming together
[1:41:50] they're all part of that producing
[1:41:53] bringing
[1:41:54] the mark of the beast to the people the
[1:41:56] mark of the beast
[1:41:57] they say oh yeah well i i i believe this
[1:42:01] i joined this church i have this
[1:42:03] fellowship and they're using covet
[1:42:05] as a reason to control you over that too
[1:42:09] maybe lord willing we get to that minute
[1:42:11] and he had power to give life unto the
[1:42:13] image of the beast
[1:42:14] that the image of the beast should both
[1:42:17] speak and cause that as many as would
[1:42:19] not worship the image of the beast
[1:42:20] should be killed
[1:42:22] worship the image of the beast or be a
[1:42:25] part of that ecumenical
[1:42:26] move that ecumenical council that group
[1:42:30] of churches
[1:42:31] denominations people don't like the word
[1:42:34] denomination they use charismatic or
[1:42:36] calvary chapels whatever they want to
[1:42:38] call them i don't whatever they are
[1:42:40] right to be a part of that exact same
[1:42:42] group
[1:42:43] to coming together as a part of that
[1:42:45] group now years ago
[1:42:47] back in the 1700s i believe
[1:42:51] they had what was called an
[1:42:52] enlightenment that came out
[1:42:54] because this move has has happened
[1:42:57] before
[1:42:58] like not of course to this exact degree
[1:43:01] but it has happened before
[1:43:03] it is called in uh in the 1700s
[1:43:07] the enlightenment let's see
[1:43:12] let me see if i can find it i got a few
[1:43:13] minutes left please
[1:43:20] 17th a european philosophical
[1:43:24] philosophical movement known as the
[1:43:26] enlightenment
[1:43:27] or age of reason now listen to this very
[1:43:30] closely
[1:43:31] this has been 300 years ago
[1:43:35] but listen to what the enlightenment
[1:43:37] entailed or the brief description of
[1:43:40] what the enlightenment was if you don't
[1:43:42] know
[1:43:43] this this just very short but listen it
[1:43:45] encapsulates it to me
[1:43:47] and encapsulates really what you see
[1:43:49] going on in the world today
[1:43:51] by just the common person the age of
[1:43:54] reason what are they out here screaming
[1:43:56] and yelling at you
[1:43:57] believe the science follow the science
[1:43:59] believe the medicine follow the medicine
[1:44:01] believe the science
[1:44:02] that's what they're all saying oh we're
[1:44:03] going to follow the science we're going
[1:44:04] to believe the medicine we're going to
[1:44:05] believe the science that's what we're
[1:44:07] going to do yeah what is that
[1:44:08] that's denying god and saying
[1:44:12] oh well let's just believe what the
[1:44:13] scientists or what these people what
[1:44:15] these meant
[1:44:16] they put this great man fouchy on the tv
[1:44:18] all the time to continue to keep spewing
[1:44:21] whatever he wants to say on that day
[1:44:23] it seems to jump around like a kangaroo
[1:44:25] on a hot day
[1:44:27] but uh whatever he wants to say on that
[1:44:29] day
[1:44:30] you know he then he can say what he
[1:44:32] wants to say he's got the platform
[1:44:34] you've got to believe him if you don't
[1:44:36] believe what he's telling you you're
[1:44:37] you're wrong and denigrates you and
[1:44:41] and humiliates you or whatever
[1:44:44] but that's the the age of the
[1:44:46] enlightenment was the age of
[1:44:47] reason right it wasn't the age of faith
[1:44:50] it was the age of
[1:44:51] reason it was making its way across the
[1:44:55] atlantic ocean to the american colonies
[1:44:57] enlightenment thinkers listen now
[1:45:00] enlightenment thinkers
[1:45:02] emphasized a scientific and logical view
[1:45:06] of the world
[1:45:07] while downplaying religion
[1:45:10] now friend that was 300 years ago but if
[1:45:13] that doesn't tell you what's going on
[1:45:14] right now
[1:45:15] right that just shows you the same
[1:45:17] devices of the devil he was using then
[1:45:19] he's using now
[1:45:20] it's the same devil he's doing the exact
[1:45:21] same thing it just wasn't time for it
[1:45:24] then
[1:45:25] and there was a group that rose up over
[1:45:27] top of that enlightenment
[1:45:29] in this and whitfield and and
[1:45:32] uh whitefield and the different
[1:45:34] ministers that were
[1:45:35] in the colonies and going around and
[1:45:37] preaching the word and bringing the
[1:45:39] power of god and demonstration and then
[1:45:41] of course you had the azusa street of
[1:45:42] revival and the restoration of the gifts
[1:45:45] and
[1:45:45] and the moving of god began again right
[1:45:48] but now we're after that
[1:45:51] we're at the end of that time that time
[1:45:53] in those days have seen its day
[1:45:56] the sweeping revivals brother brown said
[1:45:59] are over
[1:46:00] right it's had its day this nation as
[1:46:03] brother tom reminded us
[1:46:04] turned god down in 1956 in 1957 brother
[1:46:08] brown said they did turn their back on
[1:46:10] god
[1:46:10] yes he confirmed it
[1:46:14] 1957. now today
[1:46:17] what have we got we've got the exact
[1:46:19] same thing taking place
[1:46:20] right an enlightenment where there's an
[1:46:23] encouragement
[1:46:25] everywhere around you in the government
[1:46:27] in the news and they're using koba to do
[1:46:29] it
[1:46:30] just like they're using covet to bring
[1:46:32] the great
[1:46:33] reset in what is a great
[1:46:37] reset well what is the word what does
[1:46:39] the prefix re
[1:46:40] mean bring back or again over
[1:46:44] reset what do they want to do they want
[1:46:48] to get rid of your freedoms
[1:46:49] and they want to reset it back to where
[1:46:51] it was before the enlightenment came or
[1:46:54] before the uh
[1:46:55] the great awakening came the
[1:46:57] enlightenment was an age of reason
[1:46:59] the awakening was a day of faith of
[1:47:02] godliness
[1:47:04] when men preached the word of god and
[1:47:06] and went up and down the country
[1:47:08] spreading the gospel of jesus christ
[1:47:11] that was called the great awakening
[1:47:13] now you've got the enlightenment or the
[1:47:15] great awakening
[1:47:17] back then you had people oh uh
[1:47:20] you had to follow the science we had to
[1:47:22] we have to look at the world
[1:47:24] in a way of reason now
[1:47:28] there's no faith in that how can you
[1:47:30] believe in a god that you can't touch or
[1:47:33] you can't
[1:47:33] feel and even if you do believe god why
[1:47:36] do you think a
[1:47:37] god would allow these people to starve
[1:47:39] or these people to die or these storms
[1:47:41] to happen or whatever it is
[1:47:43] so now they reason it all the way of
[1:47:45] course it's global warming
[1:47:47] or or climate change or or
[1:47:51] whatever they want to that's kind of the
[1:47:53] key word i guess yes now
[1:47:55] guns kill people sorry guns don't kill
[1:47:57] people people kill people
[1:47:59] but anyway it's all about reasoning
[1:48:03] it's all about scientific evidence
[1:48:05] logical worldview
[1:48:07] downplaying religion and religion
[1:48:11] became so formal and less personal
[1:48:15] during the time that it led to lower
[1:48:17] church attendance
[1:48:18] christians were feeling complacent their
[1:48:20] methods of worship and their dissolution
[1:48:22] with wealth and rationalism
[1:48:24] were dominating culture and many began
[1:48:26] to crave
[1:48:27] a return to that again a return to a
[1:48:31] to a faith-based life not just
[1:48:34] reason not just science not just what
[1:48:36] you could see tasteful smelling here
[1:48:38] but something that's so far beyond that
[1:48:41] faith a faith-based now it's gotten back
[1:48:48] gone back to where it was at that time
[1:48:51] what we see now friend is exactly what
[1:48:53] was happening there
[1:48:56] they were telling people
[1:48:59] calling people to bring
[1:49:02] to a a an enlightenment again
[1:49:05] a a an age of science and
[1:49:09] reason and logic rather than god and
[1:49:12] faith very much yes and now that
[1:49:16] they've allowed all that they've done
[1:49:17] that and let me tell you friend the news
[1:49:19] has manipulated you
[1:49:21] and i say you as a people not you as
[1:49:23] here in our church
[1:49:25] the people the news has manipulated the
[1:49:27] people
[1:49:29] the news has manipulated people's minds
[1:49:32] into thinking something that's not real
[1:49:35] not real according to god or his word
[1:49:38] right
[1:49:38] manipulated people's minds into
[1:49:40] believing and thinking
[1:49:42] one way instead of what's the truth it's
[1:49:44] called propaganda
[1:49:46] it's taking the story and said there's a
[1:49:48] whole story to this
[1:49:49] but we're only going to tell you the
[1:49:51] part we want you to hear right
[1:49:53] well if they're only telling you the
[1:49:54] part they want you to hear what are they
[1:49:56] doing
[1:49:56] they're manipulating you and people that
[1:50:00] stare at that stuff and listen to that
[1:50:01] and watch it all the time
[1:50:03] are being manipulated and they don't
[1:50:05] know it
[1:50:07] and they're being manipulated into a
[1:50:09] part away from
[1:50:10] god and into logic and reason and
[1:50:13] science
[1:50:14] away from faith away from god away from
[1:50:18] everything that's godly
[1:50:19] and back to science right and and
[1:50:23] education
[1:50:24] and religion they're saying oh they're
[1:50:27] crushing the small businesses
[1:50:29] of course they're crushing the small
[1:50:31] businesses how do you think revelation
[1:50:33] 13 that we just read
[1:50:34] is ever going to come to pass if they
[1:50:36] don't crush those small businesses
[1:50:38] right if they don't control and
[1:50:40] manipulate your minds
[1:50:42] how do you think they're ever going to
[1:50:43] be able to conquer you
[1:50:46] they're using cova to do it by fear
[1:50:49] they're scaring people out of their wits
[1:50:52] to where people
[1:50:53] walk on a hundred acre field with a mask
[1:50:55] on
[1:50:56] right amen nobody else without a 10 mile
[1:50:59] radius of them and they got a mask on
[1:51:01] those people are so scared they've
[1:51:04] manipulated people
[1:51:06] they've scared people into it now this
[1:51:08] great
[1:51:09] this great reset has come to be able to
[1:51:12] control people
[1:51:13] down to the point they say whoa we're
[1:51:15] going to pay off your debts and
[1:51:17] we're going to do this and that for you
[1:51:19] and we're gonna make it so much better
[1:51:21] now look in this great reset
[1:51:25] they're talking about paying off
[1:51:28] people's individual debts
[1:51:29] i know the big cry has been to pay off
[1:51:31] uh student loans and stuff like that
[1:51:34] but that's just the beginning of what
[1:51:36] they're doing can you imagine
[1:51:37] we actually have somebody in our senate
[1:51:40] who actually it well more than one now
[1:51:42] but
[1:51:43] that actually says he's a socialist
[1:51:45] democrat
[1:51:47] so he actually calls himself a socialist
[1:51:50] when i was a kid if somebody said they
[1:51:52] were a socialist i might kill him
[1:51:54] if not he'd be voted out the next
[1:51:56] election
[1:51:58] you wouldn't dare say that and they
[1:52:00] elect this man over and over and over
[1:52:01] and over again
[1:52:02] when he gets up in front of him and
[1:52:04] tells him he's a socialist
[1:52:07] i'm going to take everything away from
[1:52:09] you and give you nothing
[1:52:10] and conquer you and tell you where you
[1:52:12] can go and what you can do
[1:52:14] i mean socialist is just communist baby
[1:52:17] brother
[1:52:19] it's all the same it's all the same
[1:52:20] spirit right
[1:52:22] but the price of course is your
[1:52:25] individual freedoms
[1:52:27] the price of these concessions from this
[1:52:31] international monetary fund not the
[1:52:34] united states
[1:52:36] though the united states is a part of it
[1:52:38] this international
[1:52:40] monetary fund what do you think was
[1:52:41] happening under
[1:52:43] the previous administration i almost
[1:52:45] said his name
[1:52:46] the previous administration what do you
[1:52:48] think is happening for those eight years
[1:52:50] what are you going to think happen
[1:52:52] that's going to happen now
[1:52:54] when the same people that's coming up
[1:52:56] under that administration is coming up
[1:52:58] again that's right but it's all bringing
[1:53:01] it to an end
[1:53:02] amen it's all bringing it to this end
[1:53:04] right
[1:53:05] amen that's where we're at the prices of
[1:53:07] this concession from the monetary
[1:53:08] international monetary fund
[1:53:10] will be renunciation of private property
[1:53:14] you know what that means that means
[1:53:17] you're going to take your land
[1:53:18] yes they're going to take stuff that
[1:53:20] belongs to you
[1:53:22] amen well you've never owned it anyway
[1:53:26] you know that right
[1:53:27] yeah you've never actually owned the
[1:53:29] land anyway
[1:53:31] you don't pay your taxes and find out
[1:53:32] how long you own that land
[1:53:35] yeah you don't actually own it anyway
[1:53:37] but they're gonna actually seize it
[1:53:39] renunciate take back the private
[1:53:42] property
[1:53:43] and they're going to make you adhere to
[1:53:45] a program of vaccinations against covet
[1:53:48] 19
[1:53:49] and covet 21.
[1:53:52] promoted by this specific billionaire
[1:53:55] with collaboration of course of the main
[1:53:57] part
[1:53:57] pharmaceutical groups well of course
[1:54:00] there are billions
[1:54:01] billionaire people that's going to get
[1:54:03] richer and why you think they're
[1:54:04] crushing the small businesses
[1:54:06] because all of these rich elite ruling
[1:54:09] class
[1:54:09] people are wanting to take complete
[1:54:11] control over everything that goes on
[1:54:14] the pope has already said that he is he
[1:54:17] has criticized the president
[1:54:18] he has criticized our way of life he has
[1:54:21] criticized
[1:54:22] our government and he has criticized our
[1:54:24] free enterprise system
[1:54:26] well the great reset is talking about
[1:54:28] getting away
[1:54:29] of that getting rid of that those
[1:54:31] freedoms
[1:54:32] and having it be government controlled
[1:54:35] what do they do to us then
[1:54:38] what happens to the little guy a little
[1:54:40] guy gets squashed
[1:54:42] you can see it happen in a microcosm in
[1:54:44] california i'm closing in a minute i'm
[1:54:46] sorry
[1:54:47] getting longer you can see a microcosm
[1:54:50] of it happening in california right now
[1:54:53] i've told people when i used to drive i
[1:54:55] told people
[1:54:56] uh that come out of california i said
[1:54:58] well there's so many people leaving
[1:54:59] california
[1:55:00] i found out the other week they're all
[1:55:01] going to solo too they're coming here in
[1:55:04] droves
[1:55:05] think why are they coming here because
[1:55:07] they're getting out of there
[1:55:10] just trump take that wall make a hard
[1:55:13] right at uma
[1:55:15] anyway but it's a microcosm of it
[1:55:20] you're going to end up california is
[1:55:21] becoming a state of the e
[1:55:23] rich elite and the ones that serve them
[1:55:27] that's all california's becoming middle
[1:55:29] class is gone because they're all coming
[1:55:30] here
[1:55:32] because they're being squeezed out and a
[1:55:34] little guy can't go because he didn't
[1:55:35] have a choice
[1:55:36] he's going to serve them he's going to
[1:55:38] be his mickey mouse at disneyland and
[1:55:40] he's going to be the
[1:55:41] waiter at the cheesecake factory and
[1:55:43] he's going to be the one that run the
[1:55:44] camera that allows those
[1:55:46] billionaires to show themselves on tv
[1:55:48] right you got to have those people
[1:55:50] so you got the billionaires and the rich
[1:55:52] elites you got the ones that serve them
[1:55:53] that's exactly what they want
[1:55:56] and that's what's going on that's the
[1:55:58] one thing the great
[1:55:59] reset is going to do all the while doing
[1:56:02] what to the christian
[1:56:04] well you're not even in the picture yeah
[1:56:06] they're just squeezing you out
[1:56:08] i mean the the pope and priests have
[1:56:10] already told us years ago hold up a
[1:56:12] message book and said this is our
[1:56:13] greatest enemy
[1:56:15] well then what do you think it is what
[1:56:16] do you think that's going to be for us
[1:56:19] amen amen but god has already prepared
[1:56:22] the way
[1:56:23] remember revelation 12 see
[1:56:26] god has that hiding place for the bride
[1:56:28] he takes her home
[1:56:30] i do want to read this quote to you
[1:56:31] though
[1:56:33] we get to where they can that you can
[1:56:35] you can't buy or
[1:56:36] sell unless you're part of that system
[1:56:39] that's right
[1:56:40] now this he's talking about church he's
[1:56:42] talking about
[1:56:43] ministers he's talking about false
[1:56:46] prophets
[1:56:47] but listen what he says in in in it is
[1:56:51] true there
[1:56:52] it is still true with church and
[1:56:53] ministry and false prophets
[1:56:56] but look what he says it but it also
[1:56:58] relates to me
[1:56:59] to the picture as a whole
[1:57:03] of the fear the fear amen the fear
[1:57:07] fear is the greatest tool yeah amen the
[1:57:10] devil's used to manipulate people and
[1:57:12] control people
[1:57:14] the second thought that must be
[1:57:15] impressed on our hearts this is the
[1:57:16] laodicean church age
[1:57:18] is that the seven church ages started
[1:57:20] out with the antichrist spirit as well
[1:57:22] as the holy spirit who is blessed
[1:57:24] forever first john 4
[1:57:25] 1 beloved believe not every spirit but
[1:57:28] try the spirits where they are of god
[1:57:30] because
[1:57:30] many false prophets have gone out into
[1:57:33] the world
[1:57:34] did you notice it the antichrist spirit
[1:57:37] is identified with
[1:57:39] false prophets the ages came
[1:57:42] in with false prophets and they will go
[1:57:45] out with false prophets
[1:57:47] now what happens to the false prophet
[1:57:49] today
[1:57:50] just like it did then just like happens
[1:57:53] to the news media
[1:57:54] they'll tell you whatever they want a
[1:57:56] lot of times lies
[1:57:58] if somebody catches them and proves they
[1:58:00] lied
[1:58:01] yeah they don't say anything about it
[1:58:03] they don't do anything about it that's
[1:58:06] they spend they spend 10 weeks on the
[1:58:08] lie
[1:58:09] and if they find out the lies wrong they
[1:58:11] spend 10 seconds on a retraction
[1:58:14] right that you'll never find you know
[1:58:18] it's the same thing false prophets are
[1:58:20] the same way who follows this
[1:58:23] are you going to prophesy to me and tell
[1:58:25] me something specific about tomorrow or
[1:58:27] next week
[1:58:28] well you know what i'm going to hang
[1:58:29] around tomorrow next week and i'm going
[1:58:30] to find out what you're saying is right
[1:58:32] or not
[1:58:33] don't just give me a bunch of flatteries
[1:58:35] and things that tickle my intellect or
[1:58:37] my
[1:58:38] my uh thinking i don't want to hear that
[1:58:41] that's not prophecy
[1:58:43] prophecy is telling you what's going to
[1:58:45] happen next and what's going on and
[1:58:46] what's happening here
[1:58:47] what's going to happen in your life and
[1:58:49] what's happening in this united states
[1:58:51] and not just saying oh well you know uh
[1:58:53] biden's going to be inaugurated january
[1:58:55] 20th well duh
[1:58:57] it's not a prophecy we all know that but
[1:59:00] see when they do
[1:59:01] something then it doesn't happen what
[1:59:03] happens to them
[1:59:04] right you know what happens to them they
[1:59:07] get thrown on tv or youtube again next
[1:59:09] week
[1:59:10] some of these people prophesy more in a
[1:59:12] month than brother branham
[1:59:13] a vindicated word prophet prophesied in
[1:59:16] an entire life
[1:59:17] right right yeah i i think they prophesy
[1:59:21] about what cheerio they're gonna have
[1:59:22] for breakfast
[1:59:24] anyway false prophets
[1:59:28] come in with false prophets it will go
[1:59:30] out with false prophets
[1:59:31] if we're going out now where are we
[1:59:33] going out
[1:59:35] now of course there is going to be a
[1:59:37] real false prophet that's the beast
[1:59:40] in the grand sense of that man mentioned
[1:59:43] in revelation
[1:59:45] but as for now the revelation false
[1:59:46] prophets let me move down
[1:59:48] sorry it's getting late it's talking
[1:59:49] about false prophets false teachers
[1:59:52] taking over people enticing spirits
[1:59:56] uh
[1:59:59] first timothy 4 1 now the spirit
[2:00:01] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[2:00:03] times some shall depart from the faith
[2:00:04] giving he to seducing spirits doctrines
[2:00:06] of devils
[2:00:07] now in every case you will notice that a
[2:00:09] false prophet is one who is
[2:00:11] outside the word amen outside the word
[2:00:14] logic
[2:00:15] reason understanding science
[2:00:19] outside the word just as we showed you
[2:00:22] that antichrist means
[2:00:23] anti-word so false prophets come
[2:00:27] perverting the word giving it a meaning
[2:00:30] that fits their own
[2:00:31] devilish ends have you ever noticed how
[2:00:34] and what were those ends brother brown
[2:00:35] told us
[2:00:37] it's three mostly three of them money
[2:00:38] women popularity right
[2:00:41] now most of it seems like today is money
[2:00:44] it's money the love of money has become
[2:00:46] so rampant but
[2:00:47] that's for another service
[2:00:51] to the have you ever noticed how people
[2:00:54] how the people lead others
[2:00:55] astray listen now have you ever noticed
[2:00:58] how the people who are
[2:00:59] who lead others astray bind them closely
[2:01:03] to themselves by
[2:01:04] fear they say that if the
[2:01:08] people don't do what they say
[2:01:11] or if they leave then destruction will
[2:01:14] follow
[2:01:15] they are false prophets amen
[2:01:19] how do false prophets operate by fear
[2:01:23] they bind the people to themselves
[2:01:26] closely
[2:01:26] by fear now yes that is true in the
[2:01:29] church yes that is true with false
[2:01:31] prophets
[2:01:32] in the religious world and in christian
[2:01:34] world but that's the same thing is
[2:01:35] happening in the world today
[2:01:38] what is the warnings out there if you
[2:01:39] don't do what we tell you we're going to
[2:01:41] shut your business down we're going to
[2:01:42] find you thousands of dollars
[2:01:44] you're going to get covered and die
[2:01:48] scare people scare them to death
[2:01:52] like i said to the point to where most
[2:01:54] of the simple people just get crushed
[2:01:56] out
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:01:58] but they bind the people to themselves
[2:02:00] with fear
[2:02:02] fear is the driving factor to understand
[2:02:04] today yeah
[2:02:05] amen fear is what and they're using
[2:02:07] covet to do it with
[2:02:09] now i this has been maybe debunked by
[2:02:11] others i don't know
[2:02:13] but i i don't know that you'll ever get
[2:02:15] me to understand or believe that this
[2:02:16] wasn't released on purpose
[2:02:19] i really believe it was now on purpose
[2:02:21] by saying i believe god orchestrated the
[2:02:23] whole thing to bring it out the way it's
[2:02:25] supposed to be brought out i believe the
[2:02:27] people that were anointed to do it
[2:02:28] did it exactly in its own purpose and is
[2:02:30] to do what is exactly what it's doing
[2:02:33] if you get a cold you know what happens
[2:02:36] you know what to do you take
[2:02:37] medicine where you get the flu those
[2:02:40] things
[2:02:40] but with covet there are people who have
[2:02:44] no symptoms at all
[2:02:46] there are people who have you know a
[2:02:48] little bit of a fever
[2:02:50] runny nose or something and there's some
[2:02:52] people that die
[2:02:53] right right within a few days die dead
[2:02:56] right
[2:02:57] a cobit now i don't understand the
[2:02:59] science of medicine
[2:03:00] you have to talk to mike about after
[2:03:02] church about that but i don't understand
[2:03:04] the science and medicine of it
[2:03:05] but a strand of a of a disease
[2:03:09] that that for one person doesn't even
[2:03:12] affect them and the other person they're
[2:03:13] dead within a few days
[2:03:16] they're it's it's more than my little
[2:03:19] pee
[2:03:19] brain can comprehend but when i look in
[2:03:21] the religious spiritual world about it
[2:03:23] there's something more to it than what
[2:03:24] people understand is going on
[2:03:26] it's a vehicle to control and manipulate
[2:03:30] people
[2:03:31] and to bring fear into your life
[2:03:34] and it's working yes it's working
[2:03:37] because
[2:03:38] people have lost their identity it's
[2:03:41] working because people have
[2:03:42] sold their reputation they have sold
[2:03:44] their birthrights
[2:03:46] they have sold their uh their liberties
[2:03:48] and their freedoms
[2:03:49] over to a government or over to an
[2:03:51] entity and they've
[2:03:52] they've relinquished everything you have
[2:03:54] as long as they're a little for
[2:03:56] no more is okay that's all they care
[2:03:58] about you're right
[2:04:00] amen a great fuss i'm closing
[2:04:05] a great fuss has come out recently
[2:04:08] because congress in their nice
[2:04:11] high mighty ordinances wanted to give
[2:04:14] you
[2:04:15] the people under them the common people
[2:04:19] the little people they want to give you
[2:04:21] 600
[2:04:26] let's just go build a mansion why don't
[2:04:27] we
[2:04:29] i'm gonna take my 600 and go to the
[2:04:31] dealership buy me a new car
[2:04:33] 600 600
[2:04:37] these people made six hundred dollars in
[2:04:39] a minute
[2:04:40] right right they make six hundred
[2:04:42] dollars
[2:04:43] they made tens of thousands of dollars
[2:04:46] just deciding what little piddly stuff
[2:04:48] they were gonna give you
[2:04:49] right and there's a great fuss about it
[2:04:52] and and a lot of the physical
[2:04:53] responsible people
[2:04:56] are mad because they said well we can't
[2:04:58] give them the president said well we
[2:04:59] need to give them at least 2 000.
[2:05:01] i agree with it and crazy enough uh
[2:05:07] two other people i was gonna use some
[2:05:08] adjectives but two other people believe
[2:05:10] agree with him who never agreed with him
[2:05:13] about anything
[2:05:15] i agree with him if you cause people
[2:05:18] to not be able to make a living you
[2:05:20] should be the one to help them
[2:05:22] you should be the one to take care of
[2:05:24] them six hundred dollars doesn't even
[2:05:26] pay a person's rent for a month
[2:05:28] right in certain cities it won't even
[2:05:32] pay for a meal hardly
[2:05:36] i mean the the governor of california
[2:05:38] got caught in this restaurant
[2:05:40] not social distance nobody had a mass
[2:05:43] the restaurants were supposed to be
[2:05:44] closed there's 13 or 14 people
[2:05:47] their meal what i heard was twelve
[2:05:49] hundred dollars per person
[2:05:51] wow six hundred dollars wouldn't even
[2:05:53] pay the appetizer
[2:05:56] and a soda
[2:05:59] six hundred i think what are these poor
[2:06:02] people going to do with 600 dollars
[2:06:05] and they thought that was a big deal and
[2:06:07] they're worried to death
[2:06:08] the physical responsibility which i am i
[2:06:12] am physically responsible i understand
[2:06:15] if i don't balance my checkbook bad
[2:06:16] things happen
[2:06:18] amen we as common people understand if
[2:06:20] we don't balance our paycheck
[2:06:22] our uh checkbooks bad things happen
[2:06:26] we know that they don't seem to right so
[2:06:29] i am physically responsible
[2:06:31] but they're scared to death over a half
[2:06:32] a billion dollars
[2:06:34] which most of them could carry in their
[2:06:36] front pockets
[2:06:38] when the debt is 35 trillion
[2:06:41] they're worried about another half a
[2:06:43] billion
[2:06:45] or a half a half a trillion whatever it
[2:06:47] is it's pendley compared to
[2:06:49] to what it already is they think they're
[2:06:51] going to do something about that or
[2:06:53] bring that into a reasonable level
[2:06:55] that's never going to happen meanwhile
[2:06:57] the people are dying and suffering
[2:07:00] hurting now for me personally i don't
[2:07:03] care if i get the money
[2:07:04] it's not that big god has blessed us yes
[2:07:06] i told y'all i took a whole service and
[2:07:09] talked about how blessed god's people
[2:07:11] are in the middle of this crisis
[2:07:12] right god has blessed us and i'm
[2:07:14] thankful god's been
[2:07:16] but it's not about that it's not about
[2:07:18] the money it's about the principle
[2:07:20] you're right
[2:07:20] yeah and unfortunately it seems like
[2:07:23] that's a word that's
[2:07:24] abstract or missing in the government
[2:07:26] today
[2:07:28] in the world today principle
[2:07:31] who has principles today
[2:07:35] not very many people it doesn't seem
[2:07:38] but what is it to do is to control
[2:07:41] yeah oh well you you just pander our
[2:07:44] feet we'll we'll throw you some morsels
[2:07:45] here and there
[2:07:47] you know right and then others want to
[2:07:48] come and say well we just we just want
[2:07:50] to give you
[2:07:51] you know 2 000 a month for the rest of
[2:07:53] your life well all they want you to do
[2:07:56] is to come and grovel at their feet
[2:07:58] because then if you don't because
[2:08:00] remember what i tell you before
[2:08:01] i'm closing with this the more they pay
[2:08:05] you
[2:08:05] the more they own you that's right
[2:08:08] period if they pay you and say well
[2:08:11] we'll give them
[2:08:12] we'll erase this debt and erase that
[2:08:14] debt give them so much money every month
[2:08:16] yeah they do that
[2:08:17] what if they decide they're going to
[2:08:18] take it away from you and you've come to
[2:08:20] depend on it right
[2:08:22] you're at their mercy amen
[2:08:26] revelation 13 my friend revelation 13
[2:08:30] especially 16
[2:08:31] 17 18 is here brother bannon's already
[2:08:34] identified the mark of the beast for us
[2:08:36] i did it in a brief
[2:08:37] moment with you we know what it is we
[2:08:40] know what the ecumenical council and the
[2:08:42] image of the beast is
[2:08:43] we know where it's coming from we know
[2:08:45] who's behind it we
[2:08:46] know who that he is
[2:08:50] and don't lose focus all this stuff out
[2:08:52] here gets you lost in focus yeah
[2:08:54] i hear mike has told me once if he's
[2:08:56] told me a dozen times
[2:08:58] i don't ever listen to the news watch
[2:08:59] the news or anything anymore
[2:09:01] uh because the manipulation it's all to
[2:09:04] manipulate
[2:09:05] yeah it's all to get you first of all
[2:09:07] satan wants to get you away from the
[2:09:09] word and away from god
[2:09:10] and then manipulate you into coming to
[2:09:13] losing your identity
[2:09:15] and to losing your birthright losing
[2:09:18] your
[2:09:18] your place and and giving in to all the
[2:09:21] things that's going on
[2:09:23] we are we are citizens of another
[2:09:27] civilization

[2:09:55] minutes days hours years months i don't
[2:09:57] know

[2:10:01] i believe i'll be here to see it taste
[2:10:03] it but brother brown i believe that too
[2:10:05] so we don't know but i know it's here
[2:10:08] right when the things of the scripture
[2:10:11] are wrapping up the way they are today
[2:10:13] it becomes very prevalent and
[2:10:15] evident of where we're headed where
[2:10:17] we're at amen
