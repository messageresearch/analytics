[31:00] emus did not their hearts bur burn
[31:03] within them as they talk to you along
[31:06] the way thank you Jesus and Lord I
[31:08] believe you'll speak to our hearts if
[31:10] our hearts are right with you it's a
[31:12] time to search our hearts there's a
[31:16] strong Spirit that's battling even the
[31:19] Believers that follow this great message
[31:22] you have sent through your Prophet
[31:23] brother bradam that's a religious spirit
[31:26] that's a spirit that makes themselves
[31:29] feel that I'm doing good but when the
[31:32] word comes forth they refuse to line up
[31:36] and that's why brother Brown emphasize
[31:38] the importance of having that Born Again
[31:41] experience yes Lord where it'll be
[31:43] automatic that you want to please God
[31:46] you want to line up to the word it's
[31:49] like you spoke to
[31:51] Solomon and one night you said that if
[31:57] my people who are called by my name will
[32:01] humble themselves Lord will pray will
[32:04] seek my face I will hear from Heaven yes

[42:15] we're going to sing only believe brother
[42:18] comes to minister for us today
[42:21] [Music]
[42:31] all all things are
[42:35] [Music]
[42:52] possible all things are possible
[42:59] [Music]
[43:04] so before I get into the message they
[43:06] asked me to fill
[43:08] in um the problem that we had in our
[43:11] area was there was a storm system that
[43:13] moved across the
[43:15] Appalachians we got 16 Ines of rain in a
[43:19] week so that was all up in the mountains
[43:21] and so the ground was
[43:24] saturated and then the day after that
[43:27] ended more or less ended that's when the
[43:30] hurricane came through and the wind that
[43:34] that generated was enough to there are
[43:37] areas in where we live where there are
[43:40] acres of trees that are laying flat wow
[43:44] I mean Acres wow there's one guy he had
[43:47] a long driveway probably a quarter mile
[43:50] you know we had to cut 200 200 trees out
[43:54] of off of their driveway so they could
[43:57] get home on we had incidences where we
[44:01] had the I'm a volunteer fireman and so
[44:04] working with them we one road we had to
[44:07] help clear and we would get to one area
[44:10] we would spend a half an hour to go 20
[44:12] ft and then we would go quarter mile
[44:16] maybe another half an hour or more to
[44:19] you know to clear that Tre and all we
[44:22] were doing was a get so emergency
[44:24] vehicles get through wow um we were
[44:28] without power for two
[44:30] weeks um and then after we got our power
[44:33] back then it was two or 3 days before uh
[44:36] AT&T can come by and reestablish our
[44:39] internet phone
[44:41] service um the church above us
[44:44] Pentecostal Church they were nice enough
[44:46] to feed breakfast and dinner to anybody
[44:48] who
[44:49] wanted because of we we have a helicop
[44:52] landing pad at the fireplace fire
[44:55] department um um
[44:59] the the National Guard used that pad and
[45:03] they we had one day we had three Shooks
[45:06] drop bring water and food and then the
[45:09] following day they brought two more
[45:10] loads wow um when people found out that
[45:14] we we could
[45:16] distribute um then all of a sudden
[45:18] people began to bring other
[45:20] supplies and and but then the church
[45:23] above us which is the Pentecostal Church
[45:27] they became the distribution point for
[45:29] almost everything after
[45:31] that
[45:33] um they had the space they had the
[45:35] facilities they had the people um the
[45:38] problem that we had in our
[45:40] area in one town uh Chimney Rock um
[45:44] there was a 30 foot wall of water that
[45:46] came down the river used to be just a
[45:49] stream yeah it literally wiped out the
[45:53] town there are areas that there was no
[45:55] access
[45:57] um so they were delivering things by
[45:59] mule M had helicopters come in and lift
[46:03] people out of that town just to bring
[46:05] him to safety um one guy he owned a
[46:09] bulldozer and his the road was gone so
[46:12] he just took his bulldozer and he made a
[46:14] road wow somebody asked him the
[46:17] Department of Transportation approved he
[46:19] said who cares yeah we need a yes you
[46:23] know um but we were fortunate we um
[46:27] because of part of the fire department
[46:28] they used the refrigerator to keep water
[46:30] cold but they didn't use the freezer
[46:33] part so we took a lot of our freezer
[46:35] stuff stuck in that freezer we didn't
[46:37] lose but maybe $20 worth of grocery sign
[46:40] which okay that's it's all the stuff you
[46:43] open up salad
[46:45] dressing so but we were we were really
[46:49] quite
[46:50] fortunate um there are other
[46:54] areas they say that it's going to take
[46:57] weeks just to clear it's going to take
[47:00] months or almost years to rebuild yeah
[47:04] sure I mean the devastation was that bad
[47:07] and like I say it was because of the
[47:09] rain that
[47:11] beforehand that um when the hurricane
[47:14] came by the wind like like our our fire
[47:16] assistant fire chief they when they have
[47:19] a National
[47:20] Emergency the county requires the police
[47:23] the fire departments to be to to stay
[47:25] man you had to be fully man but there
[47:28] had to be people there well our
[47:30] assistant chief was there they got a
[47:33] call about 1 1:30 or something like that
[47:35] that some trees were down so they went
[47:36] out to cut the trees and about that time
[47:39] the wind picked up W and uh the
[47:42] assistant chief said there were trees
[47:44] falling in front of him behind him
[47:47] because it was dark he could not see
[47:50] where they were coming
[47:51] from and so he called up the other crew
[47:54] could have the other brush truck and
[47:57] said we are here we need you to come and
[47:59] cut us out wow because of a tree had
[48:02] falling on where they were at uh the
[48:04] assistant chief didn't figur he was
[48:06] going to live I mean he was and after
[48:09] that they de said let's go to the fire
[48:11] department hunker down until daylight
[48:13] and from that point on on Friday um we
[48:16] spent all day clearing
[48:19] Road um like I say Chimney Rock no
[48:22] longer
[48:23] exists um there other areas Bridges were
[48:25] totally wased way there was there were
[48:28] two there two or three there are two or
[48:31] three um towns which there is no access
[48:36] there is no access and people lost their
[48:38] homes one
[48:40] person
[48:41] um he was a Soler there was 11 people
[48:45] that died of his family because of a
[48:46] Mudslide that buried the
[48:48] house so he was the Soul Survivor of
[48:51] this house and so and because the wind
[48:54] came from a direction other than the
[48:57] than the prevailing winds the Trees of
[49:00] ours that fell down they fell away from
[49:02] our house but if they had been the
[49:04] prevailing winds it would have taken our
[49:07] our home and would have
[49:09] flat so God was gracious amen we
[49:12] acknowledge that it's also interesting
[49:14] that the that
[49:16] the we part of a Senior Choir on most
[49:20] people are 50s 60s and older one guy's
[49:24] almost 100 I think he's 10 uhuh 104 104
[49:28] okay and nobody of that group I mean
[49:32] yeah they had sustained they lost trees
[49:35] but they never lost homes they never
[49:37] lost their cars they never lost anything
[49:40] value so to speak our church there was
[49:43] nobody that had lost anything and U so
[49:46] we're we're we're very grateful that God
[49:48] watched over us take care of us amen
[49:51] proving us yes praise the
[49:53] Lord why don't we stand and we'll just
[49:55] sing one more song um just to change the
[50:01] sequency and let's just do only believe
[50:03] again

[51:24] people ministering unto that which was a
[51:26] part of you from the beginning thank you
[51:28] Jesus so take me Lord as your instrument
[51:30] this morning and use me to minister unto
[51:32] your children to your family that Lord
[51:35] we might realize the hour We're living
[51:38] but also realize Lord who we are because
[51:40] of you and Grant this for I ask it in
[51:43] Jesus Christ's name amen amen while
[51:47] you're standing if you'd open to the
[51:49] Gospel of John the 17th
[51:51] chapter read verses 20 to 23
[51:57] John the Gospel of
[51:59] John Chapter 2 chapter
[52:03] 17 read verses 20 to
[52:07] 23 you know when I was raised in the
[52:09] Baptist Church I was told I was a sinner
[52:13] that was the emphasis saved by grace
[52:16] well I still am a sinner saved by grace
[52:20] but this message began to tell me
[52:22] something that I'm more than just that
[52:23] amen that I am a Son of God and I've
[52:26] been restored back to my my rightful
[52:28] position with my heavenly father and to
[52:32] me the God sent a prophet in this
[52:34] generation to tell me who I am Amen in
[52:38] John 17 says neither pray I for these
[52:40] alone but for them also which Shall
[52:42] Believe on me through their word and
[52:45] that they may all that they all may be
[52:46] one as thou father art in me and I in
[52:49] thee that they may also be one in us
[52:52] that the world may believe that thou has
[52:54] sent me and the glory which thou gavest
[52:57] me have I given them that they may be
[52:59] one even as we are one i in them and
[53:03] thou in me that they may be made perfect
[53:05] in one and that the world may know that
[53:07] thou has has sent me amen and has loved
[53:09] them as thou Hast loved me amen you can
[53:13] be
[53:14] seated you know one of the things when I
[53:17] was began to do the I was doing a series
[53:20] Indy I Minister there every other week
[53:22] by Zoom it saves on air you know yeah
[53:26] but anyway we get to the thing here in
[53:28] Paul or Jesus Christ this is just before
[53:30] his
[53:31] crucifixion and he was praying for Unity
[53:34] amongst the people among amongst the
[53:37] disciples amen but he's saying here I
[53:40] want I want Lord he he's praying to the
[53:43] Father which dwelt in him he says I want
[53:45] I want this group of people I want these
[53:47] disciples and those which will believe
[53:49] on me through through their word I want
[53:52] them to be one in the same way that we
[53:53] are one amen well see this is something
[53:57] that is not stressed in the
[53:58] denominational system to me God is out
[54:02] you know when I was in the Baptist
[54:03] Church God was out there someplace and
[54:05] if I was a good little boy and I did
[54:07] what I was supposed to do eventually I'd
[54:08] go to a nice place of retirement called
[54:10] heaven and and everything would be nice
[54:13] but here is telling me that God is going
[54:15] to come and live in me yes and the same
[54:18] way that that spirit of God dwelt in
[54:20] Jesus Christ is the same way that that
[54:22] God now dwells inside of me amen and
[54:25] this is a concept which is
[54:27] foreign to the to the to the
[54:29] denominational churches and it's nothing
[54:32] against them but see God had to send a
[54:35] prophet because he has to prepare Bride
[54:37] for a Rapture amen and if you're not
[54:40] part of God if you're if God does not
[54:42] live inside of you there's no way for
[54:43] you to prepare yourself to become to be
[54:47] raptured right and God's power
[54:50] transformed brother B makes an
[54:51] interesting statement he said Jesus
[54:54] Christ was God himself manifested amen
[54:57] because he was a son because he was the
[54:59] begotten but it was just a tabernacle
[55:01] for him to live in amen God built
[55:04] himself a house a body to live and he
[55:06] come down so that you so you could touch
[55:09] him but Jesus Christ was just God God
[55:13] placed in Mary what was necessary to
[55:15] bring forth a body that God could come
[55:18] and dwell inside of Amen when Jesus
[55:21] Christ was born he was the son of God
[55:24] because of who he was because he was a
[55:26] part of God now manifested he was the
[55:28] lust which took on human
[55:30] flesh but but Jesus God had to come in
[55:33] there so he could become our kinsman
[55:34] redeemer God had to come in that body
[55:36] that Tabernacle of Jesus Christ so that
[55:40] not only could he become our kinsman
[55:41] redeemer but so we could actually see
[55:43] God yes yes we could actually experience
[55:46] God Amen and and and and and and when
[55:49] you begin to go through the gospels and
[55:51] you begin to look at Jesus Christ and
[55:53] who he was and how he was and how he
[55:55] acted how he interacted with other
[55:57] people this the the the the the Jewish
[56:00] Nation could not accept him because they
[56:03] had God up there someplace they had God
[56:05] Almighty all powerful all knowing all
[56:08] you know all this other and and all of a
[56:10] sudden to see a
[56:11] man claiming to be a Son of God right
[56:15] this was beyond their comprehension sure
[56:18] but see now it's coming down to us
[56:21] because where does God dwell if you have
[56:23] received the Holy Spirit God dwells in
[56:25] you am this eternal all sufficient all
[56:28] powerful Everlasting being yes dwells in
[56:32] you amen and he's not out there
[56:34] someplace no but he's actually inside of
[56:37] you and he wants to express his life
[56:38] through you amen but the only way he can
[56:41] do that is you have to give him the
[56:43] preeminent Jesus Christ he say Jesus
[56:46] Christ he says it's not me who does the
[56:47] work he says it's the father who dwells
[56:49] in me amen he does these works right
[56:52] brother Brown says he he said he said
[56:55] when God came and and the the the
[56:57] discernment and and the Miracles and
[56:59] stuff he says it wasn't me doing any of
[57:02] this he says I was merely standing there
[57:04] when God did amen right but see we have
[57:07] to realize see this is the position that
[57:09] we are in it's not about us it's about
[57:12] him right it's not what we do for God
[57:15] it's what we allow him to do through us
[57:18] but in order for him to work through us
[57:21] he have we we have to yield ourselves to
[57:24] the god that dwells in Us in the same
[57:25] way that Jesus Christ yielded to the
[57:28] Father which dwelt in him amen and and
[57:30] and this is this is the thing that we
[57:32] this is what I've been concentrating on
[57:34] this is the thing that God has been
[57:35] dealing with me or been been trying to
[57:36] show me praise the Lord and in the smon
[57:40] church age brother of Adam he makes a
[57:42] statement he says now then we're coming
[57:44] to a conclusion as Eternal as Eternal
[57:47] logos the word God himself was
[57:49] manifested in the son and in Jesus
[57:51] Christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[57:53] bod and that Eternal one was the father
[57:56] manifested in flesh and thereby gained
[57:58] the title of son and so here he's
[58:01] brother Bram is trying to relate what
[58:02] was Jesus Christ he was the tabernacle
[58:05] that God dwelt in amen he was he was the
[58:08] father himself he was this eternal all
[58:10] sufficient all powerful one he was the
[58:12] logos he was he he was he was he was the
[58:15] Eternal God now living in this
[58:17] Tabernacle we call Jesus Christ amen but
[58:20] then he goes on he says so see he says
[58:22] see now as we look at Jesus Christ we
[58:25] realize how God dwelt in him he says now
[58:28] we so he's taking us and beginning to
[58:31] he's beginning to let us to understand
[58:34] we also were a part of God from the
[58:36] beginning amen we also were an attribute
[58:38] of God we were also in the mind of God
[58:40] we're also a thought of God yes in the
[58:42] process of time we came into
[58:45] manifestation we are not Jesus Christ
[58:49] right but we are a manifestation of a
[58:51] thought of
[58:53] God because in the beginning was the
[58:55] word the word was with God and the Word
[58:57] was God and the Word was made flesh the
[58:59] word there is logos right well logos is
[59:02] a thought expressed amen Jesus Christ
[59:05] was a thought expressed he was the logos
[59:08] expressed yes and and but see now it it
[59:11] pertains to us also we are now this
[59:13] logos Express we are a thought of God
[59:15] that now came into manifestation it does
[59:18] not make us Jesus Christ right but it
[59:21] make but it comes to the place we
[59:22] realize that we were a part of God and
[59:24] now that God that dwelt in Jesus Jesus
[59:26] Christ now he dwells in us and he dwells
[59:28] in us for the same purpose so he can
[59:30] express himself through US amen amen so
[59:32] he says even even so we eternally in his
[59:35] thoughts in our turn became the many
[59:37] many membered spoken word see manifested
[59:39] in flesh uh and and those Eternal
[59:42] thoughts now manifested in flesh are the
[59:44] sons of God even as we are so called he
[59:47] says we did not become seed by the
[59:49] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[59:51] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[59:54] because we were seed is the re reason we
[59:56] could be quickened and nonseed there's
[59:57] nothing to Quicken amen so what God has
[1:00:00] done before the foundation of the world
[1:00:03] he chose
[1:00:04] us when we were born he put his seed in
[1:00:07] us right what is a seed it's it it's
[1:00:10] it's it's the seed is the life that that
[1:00:14] God has planted in US yeah okay it's a
[1:00:17] part of God that dwelt in us from the
[1:00:19] time of our birth Amen in fact actually
[1:00:22] it dwelt in us really before the
[1:00:24] foundations of the world but we can't
[1:00:26] relate to that before the foundation of
[1:00:28] the world because I had no thought of
[1:00:29] what I was back then right but we have
[1:00:31] to begin to realize we are a thought of
[1:00:33] God Express God placed his seed in me
[1:00:37] amen and what is a seed the seed is is a
[1:00:39] life of
[1:00:40] God but then when you begin to look at a
[1:00:43] seed when you begin to look like a when
[1:00:45] you you guys like to have Gardens you
[1:00:49] take a for for using with just corn you
[1:00:53] take a corn and you put it in the ground
[1:00:56] but see that corn has within it a life
[1:01:00] right and there's a life inside of that
[1:01:03] corn there's wanting to manifest itself
[1:01:06] yes but the shell of the shell that
[1:01:09] contains that life has to break open it
[1:01:12] has to die it has to degenerate yes and
[1:01:14] only when it degenerates can it can it
[1:01:16] allow the life that is in it to come
[1:01:18] into manifestation right but see that's
[1:01:21] where it comes down into us we have a
[1:01:23] life sitting in us and that life is the
[1:01:26] life is the life of God Amen but the
[1:01:28] shell that's what we live in has to die
[1:01:31] yeah has to be able to yield itself into
[1:01:33] the life that dwells in in it so that
[1:01:35] the life that is in us can come into
[1:01:37] manifestation and the more we are able
[1:01:40] to yield to the god that is in us that's
[1:01:42] that is the only way that the god that
[1:01:44] dwells in us can come and be able to
[1:01:46] manifest and express himself through US
[1:01:49] Amen in Galatians 4 it's uh 4:1 Paul is
[1:01:54] making a statement he said now I say
[1:01:56] that an heir as long as he is a child
[1:01:59] nothing but a servant though he be Lord
[1:02:00] of all yeah what are we heirs to we are
[1:02:03] going to rule and reign with Christ amen
[1:02:06] that is that that is what what we we are
[1:02:08] destined to do this is in the Millennium
[1:02:10] and eventually we after the Millennium
[1:02:12] I'm not sure what what we'll be doing
[1:02:15] but but still that we we
[1:02:17] are God himself dwells in us because he
[1:02:21] dwells in us all the power of God is
[1:02:24] there amen but he but we cannot access
[1:02:27] that or we cannot manifest that until we
[1:02:29] learn until we are trained yes you don't
[1:02:32] you don't take a a 4year old and give
[1:02:34] him the keys to the car and says here
[1:02:36] son have some fun right you don't give
[1:02:38] him a you know you don't give him a gun
[1:02:40] you know here go go shoot some squirrels
[1:02:43] or you know no he has to be trained
[1:02:46] right amen I know most a lot of where
[1:02:48] where we live everybody hunts I mean
[1:02:50] this is this is this the way they do I
[1:02:53] mean they were doing it from the time
[1:02:54] that they you know Four 3 four years old
[1:02:57] right but they have to be trained so
[1:02:59] they normally they give him a BB gun or
[1:03:00] they give them something else which is
[1:03:02] basically
[1:03:03] harmless but as the kid learns and he he
[1:03:06] learns um he learns to respect that
[1:03:10] weapon then the the father would give
[1:03:12] him a 22 or give him something else
[1:03:15] right and then all then when he gets
[1:03:16] older yeah then he gives him 30 out
[1:03:18] sixes and 30 30s and 270s what I don't
[1:03:22] know the different guns but he but all
[1:03:25] of a sudden dealing with something that
[1:03:26] you can shoot a deer and you can kill it
[1:03:29] yeah well you you have to but you have
[1:03:32] to be trained amen you just don't give a
[1:03:34] child you know a weapon and all of a
[1:03:36] sudden here have some fun right because
[1:03:39] he doesn't know that he doesn't have the
[1:03:40] responsibility doesn't have the
[1:03:42] knowledge on on how to how to handle
[1:03:44] that exactly so anyway going back into
[1:03:46] Galatians he
[1:03:48] says um he says so but we were under
[1:03:50] tutors and governors until the assign
[1:03:52] appointment of the father and he goes on
[1:03:55] so even so we we when we were children
[1:03:57] were under bondage to the elements of
[1:03:59] the world we were under bondage to our
[1:04:01] flesh because this is what we contact
[1:04:04] the world with right but when the
[1:04:05] fullness was time was come God sent
[1:04:07] forth a son made a woman made under the
[1:04:09] law to redeem them that were under the
[1:04:11] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:04:13] of sons a son that is adopted has has
[1:04:16] the same privileges and Authority as the
[1:04:19] father does right and brother brand he
[1:04:21] talks about
[1:04:22] that but because we were born in sin
[1:04:25] because we were because we are we were
[1:04:28] subject to the world because we were
[1:04:29] subject to our fleshly nature we had to
[1:04:32] be redeemed something had to come along
[1:04:34] and and make us so that we so that we
[1:04:36] could be restored back to what we were
[1:04:38] in God from the beginning amen and only
[1:04:40] when we are restored can we actually
[1:04:42] come back and become adopted Sons
[1:04:44] because that's what we are going to be
[1:04:46] once once the Rapture take place amen
[1:04:49] yes and he says and because you are Sons
[1:04:51] God sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:04:52] into your hearts crying ABA father
[1:04:55] therefore you are no more a servant but
[1:04:56] a son a son and an heir of God through
[1:04:59] Christ amen because you were a part of
[1:05:02] God from the
[1:05:03] beginning that's why God gives you his
[1:05:06] Spirit yes when he when you receive his
[1:05:09] Spirit then you begin to recognize
[1:05:11] you're are some you are part of
[1:05:13] something which is greater than yourself
[1:05:15] yes you begin to realize you actually
[1:05:17] are a part of God himself because you
[1:05:19] are an expression of that I am an
[1:05:21] expression of my Earthly father amen I
[1:05:23] have a lot of mannerisms and and and a
[1:05:25] lot of other things that way my dad
[1:05:27] acted the way he expressed himself yeah
[1:05:29] that's the same in me because
[1:05:31] genetically I'm he's my father right but
[1:05:35] see now God also God spiritually
[1:05:38] speaking is my father and he's trying to
[1:05:40] restore me back to what I was in him
[1:05:43] before there was the fall before we were
[1:05:46] put in temples of clay before we had to
[1:05:48] deal with this fleshly nature because
[1:05:50] the fleshly nature is contrary unto God
[1:05:53] we have to learn how to take our our
[1:05:55] nature and and and have it die if you
[1:05:57] will so that we can so that we can come
[1:05:59] to the place where God can live and
[1:06:01] express himself through US amen when I
[1:06:04] when I look at water baptism if you want
[1:06:06] to become a Christian first you have to
[1:06:08] repent of your sins realize that you are
[1:06:10] a sinner realize that that you know you
[1:06:13] have problems you have fleshly desires
[1:06:15] that you need to deal with so we accept
[1:06:18] Jesus Christ as your
[1:06:19] savior because you're wanting to
[1:06:22] change and then after that then then you
[1:06:25] go and and you make a public declaration
[1:06:27] through water baptism and in water
[1:06:30] baptism when you when you go in there
[1:06:32] normally speaking we ask the person have
[1:06:34] you accepted Christ because without that
[1:06:37] water baptism means nothing right but
[1:06:39] then when you when we baptize you you
[1:06:41] are going down you're a dry Sinner and
[1:06:46] you're coming up a wet
[1:06:48] Christian because you are declaring I
[1:06:50] have died right it it it's easier to put
[1:06:54] you under the water than this to bury
[1:06:55] you 4T under or 6 feet under and put a
[1:06:58] casket and put the dirt on top and try
[1:07:00] and dig You Up 3 days later because
[1:07:02] that's difficult I mean people don't
[1:07:04] survive that too well water yeah water
[1:07:07] is much easier okay but still the
[1:07:09] Declaration is the same yes you are
[1:07:12] saying I've died yes it's no longer me
[1:07:15] living and now I'm going to be I am
[1:07:17] going to live and I'm going to live for
[1:07:18] God I'm going to live for God Alone yes
[1:07:20] I'm going to submit myself to what God's
[1:07:22] will is for my life I'm going to give up
[1:07:24] my future I'm going to give up my plans
[1:07:26] I'm going to give up everything that I
[1:07:27] was striving to do so that I might I
[1:07:29] might live for God and follow his his
[1:07:32] follow his precepts and let his life
[1:07:34] live itself through me amen we look at
[1:07:36] the life of Paul I mean Paul he was he
[1:07:39] wanted to be part of the San hadrin he
[1:07:41] he wanted to be part of the ruling the
[1:07:43] ruling group that ruled ruled Judaism
[1:07:47] and he was well on his way but then he
[1:07:49] met Jesus Christ on the road to
[1:07:52] Damascus and Paul said I I've taken
[1:07:54] everything that I have
[1:07:56] all of my future all of my plans he says
[1:07:58] I gave it away just for the for the
[1:08:00] Excellency of just knowing Jesus Christ
[1:08:03] right but see this is where we have to
[1:08:05] come in our
[1:08:06] relationship we have to be willing to
[1:08:08] follow him yes we have to be follow
[1:08:11] willing to follow what he wants us to do
[1:08:13] amen it's no longer my will it's no
[1:08:15] longer my desires it's no longer my
[1:08:17] plans no God what do you want me to
[1:08:20] do and that and that's that's to me
[1:08:23] that's where we have to have to come
[1:08:26] but when we talk about Redemption
[1:08:28] Redemption is kind of an interesting
[1:08:30] thing Paul or in in God through Moses
[1:08:34] wrote down in Leviticus
[1:08:36] 25 and it talks it talks about if if
[1:08:40] a a child of of a of a family okay all
[1:08:44] of a sudden he's poor and he and he he
[1:08:46] sells himself into
[1:08:49] slavery
[1:08:50] well the only person that can redeem
[1:08:54] him has to be somebody he's related to
[1:08:58] right I cannot redeem any of your kids
[1:09:01] right because I'm not related right I
[1:09:04] can redeem mine but I can't redeem yours
[1:09:07] well it applies now in Us in Jesus
[1:09:09] Christ amen we have to have been part of
[1:09:11] God from the beginning right we have to
[1:09:14] be a child of God we have to be a Son of
[1:09:16] God God came in Jesus Christ so he could
[1:09:18] become our kinsman redeemer so that he
[1:09:20] could die on the cross so he could
[1:09:22] redeem us back to what we were in God
[1:09:24] before the fall amen but you have to be
[1:09:27] born again you have to be part of God's
[1:09:30] family if you're not part of God's
[1:09:31] family you are not redeemable yes you
[1:09:33] can be saved yes but redeemed no this
[1:09:36] implies something different
[1:09:39] right brother bradam going on in this
[1:09:41] morning church he say hold this
[1:09:43] carefully in mind he says redeem means
[1:09:45] to buy back it restores to the original
[1:09:48] owner of God by his death the shed blood
[1:09:50] brought back his own he brought back the
[1:09:53] spoken word s s bride say my sheep hear
[1:09:56] my voice which is the word and they
[1:09:58] follow me you always were sheep you
[1:10:00] never were a pig or a dog turned into a
[1:10:02] sheep right that's impossible for every
[1:10:04] kind of Life produces the same kind of
[1:10:06] life and there's no change in species so
[1:10:08] as we were in the thoughts of God and
[1:10:10] then expressed in flesh there had to
[1:10:11] come a day when we would hear his voice
[1:10:13] the word and hearing that voice would
[1:10:16] become aware of our father calling us
[1:10:18] and to recognize that we are the sons of
[1:10:20] God
[1:10:22] Amen and I see lot I lot of people and I
[1:10:25] hear a lot of people declaring oh yeah
[1:10:26] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of
[1:10:29] God well if you are then you'll begin to
[1:10:32] act like your father yes if you're still
[1:10:35] in the world doing the things of the
[1:10:36] world I'm sorry there's something that's
[1:10:38] missing in here amen either there hasn't
[1:10:41] been the commitment either there hasn't
[1:10:42] been the acceptance of of what God had
[1:10:44] did at the cross but once you are
[1:10:46] redeemed and you realize God is your
[1:10:48] father then God himself comes and dwells
[1:10:50] inside of you and it begins to bring a
[1:10:52] transformation within the individual
[1:10:55] amen
[1:10:56] um I mean I can look back in my life and
[1:10:59] I was a renegade um I wasn't always a
[1:11:02] good boy I mean there were times my dad
[1:11:04] got very upset and after he wore out my
[1:11:07] bottom end I had to stand up and eat my
[1:11:09] my dinner it was too short to to sit
[1:11:13] okay but I was always his son yes that
[1:11:17] never changed amen and my dad may not
[1:11:20] have been happy with me some days but he
[1:11:22] loved me because I was his son yes there
[1:11:25] was other Kids on the Block that my dad
[1:11:27] didn't always speak well of because they
[1:11:29] misbehaved and he didn't care for them
[1:11:32] but he wasn't their father amen okay so
[1:11:35] the Same Love relationship I have with
[1:11:37] my father they did not have that
[1:11:39] relationship with my father as I had
[1:11:42] because my father loved me he didn't
[1:11:43] love those other kids okay and so you
[1:11:46] have to begin to understand when when we
[1:11:48] are when we believe that we are a son
[1:11:50] and daughter of God we have to
[1:11:52] understand this love relationship that
[1:11:54] exists between us yes I if
[1:11:58] um Paul or no David said in one of the
[1:12:02] places in in Romans I think is blessed
[1:12:04] is the god who will not impute sin where
[1:12:07] God will no longer keep record of you of
[1:12:09] your
[1:12:10] mistakes and I was thinking about
[1:12:13] that he redeemed us and when he redeemed
[1:12:17] us he took care of all of our sins and
[1:12:19] all all he paid the price
[1:12:22] totally but then if God would keep
[1:12:24] record of of our
[1:12:26] sins then all of a sudden somebody would
[1:12:29] have to die again to pay for those sins
[1:12:33] because it's you go down to the bank and
[1:12:35] you get a loan okay there's you you owe
[1:12:37] a debt yeah well when you pay off the
[1:12:40] debt that's fine but then you go down
[1:12:42] you get a loan for something else now
[1:12:44] you have another debt and sometimes you
[1:12:46] might have a debt for the car and the
[1:12:48] house and okay somebody has to pay these
[1:12:52] debts well this is fine
[1:12:56] but if as long as there is a record you
[1:12:59] owe you owe somebody has to pay that
[1:13:01] amen but so what God has done is once he
[1:13:04] has redeemed us he paid once and for all
[1:13:06] the price for our Redemption he paid for
[1:13:09] the price for all of our sins but that
[1:13:11] he will no longer charge you for the
[1:13:13] debt amen you make another mistake he
[1:13:16] doesn't charge you for that debt right
[1:13:18] there's I mean if you make a mistake
[1:13:20] yeah you will when I made a mistake yeah
[1:13:23] my my dad would correct me
[1:13:25] okay when David made a mistake with
[1:13:27] basba God corrected him but yet God
[1:13:30] never imputed on the long term that debt
[1:13:33] right because if he had imputed that
[1:13:35] debt then all of a sudden if God if God
[1:13:38] imputed to us every time we made a
[1:13:41] mistake that he would have to come back
[1:13:42] to the cross and he would have to die
[1:13:44] again for this for my mistake amen
[1:13:46] that's why he doesn't impute I don't
[1:13:48] know if I'm making any sense on that but
[1:13:50] we have to understand the freedom we
[1:13:52] have you know the other thing when I
[1:13:54] looked at a person being redeemed yeah
[1:13:56] he the guy sold himself to slavery and
[1:13:58] we were sold into slavery to our flesh
[1:14:00] and to Satan but you know once he was
[1:14:04] redeemed he was free yes he didn't have
[1:14:07] to go work he didn't have to he didn't
[1:14:10] he no longer had the task master now he
[1:14:12] could return to this property that he
[1:14:13] had now he could return to to doing what
[1:14:15] he what what he wanted to do he was
[1:14:17] totally free from all of the debt from
[1:14:19] all of the obligations that he had sold
[1:14:21] himself into amen but you see now we're
[1:14:23] free yes
[1:14:25] Satan has no right to us amen right
[1:14:29] we're we we we are totally free true we
[1:14:32] make mistakes sure we do and and he will
[1:14:35] correct us according according to those
[1:14:37] things but we have to understand that
[1:14:39] the only and only as we submit to Satan
[1:14:42] can Satan rule us amen only as we take
[1:14:45] our fleshly desires and we let them rule
[1:14:48] only then can Satan sit there and use
[1:14:50] our fleshly desires against us and put
[1:14:52] us back into bondage right amen
[1:14:55] and and and this is I mean one of the
[1:14:57] things we we notice especially with drug
[1:15:00] addiction all they start out and
[1:15:02] somebody they claim to have been their
[1:15:04] friends they get him into drugs and all
[1:15:06] of a sudden and and there's a there's a
[1:15:08] demon that comes with that right but
[1:15:11] once you accepted Christ then all of a
[1:15:13] sudden okay you are you should be free
[1:15:15] from that bondage free from that
[1:15:18] demon but if your flesh still desires
[1:15:21] that drug there's still the bondage
[1:15:24] there
[1:15:25] so sometimes you have to overcome it
[1:15:28] every day right amen you have to
[1:15:30] overcome it every day finding this out
[1:15:32] with one of our grandsons sure um but
[1:15:35] anyway but you we have to understand we
[1:15:37] have to understand the only way we can
[1:15:40] overcome anything is we have to get into
[1:15:42] Christ amen we have we have to want to
[1:15:44] worship him we want to get into his
[1:15:46] presence we we want to praise him we
[1:15:48] want to do things which are pleasing to
[1:15:50] him right okay amen and the more that we
[1:15:53] get into his presence and the more that
[1:15:55] we worship him yeah then then the more
[1:15:57] of our Focus becomes on him and less of
[1:16:00] the focus comes Upon Our flesh true
[1:16:03] Amen in the breach between the church
[1:16:05] ages and seals brother Brown says the
[1:16:08] title to the earth into eternal life
[1:16:10] when Adam forfeited it then Satan's
[1:16:12] dirty hands could not take it so it went
[1:16:14] back to the original owner which was God
[1:16:16] himself when Adam forfeited it for
[1:16:18] wisdom instead of the faith it went back
[1:16:20] to the hands of the owner almighty God
[1:16:22] Amen so what's it doing in the hands of
[1:16:25] God is was waiting for the Redemption
[1:16:27] for the Redemption claim he made a way
[1:16:30] of redemption he made a way back and
[1:16:32] somehow the and someday the Redeemer is
[1:16:34] going to take going to take us back and
[1:16:38] this we're talking here about the
[1:16:41] Rapture until the Rapture until the
[1:16:44] changing of my body my body still has
[1:16:46] its desires sure every time I think yeah
[1:16:49] doctor says you better lose some later
[1:16:51] you know and yeah I agree with him yeah
[1:16:54] yeah yeah but I tell my body I'm going
[1:16:56] to go on a diet yeah then the battle
[1:16:58] starts yeah then the battle starts right
[1:17:01] because all of a sudden the things that
[1:17:03] yeah I could pass up before oh no oh man
[1:17:05] I see that cake and
[1:17:08] eyes Okay because my flesh is say hey
[1:17:11] you used to enjoy it why not now you
[1:17:13] know but I'm trying to do something oh
[1:17:15] no well I I have my desires and you have
[1:17:17] your desires and we're going to battle
[1:17:19] this out yeah and anyway that's why the
[1:17:22] way I
[1:17:23] am but we have to begin to understand
[1:17:26] once we get into Jesus Christ once our
[1:17:29] Focus becomes him then our Focus becomes
[1:17:31] totally different than the things of the
[1:17:33] world right this was like in the life of
[1:17:35] Paul all of a sudden when he when he met
[1:17:37] Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus
[1:17:39] from that point on he says I gave up
[1:17:41] everything for the Excellency of knowing
[1:17:42] Jesus Christ amen but see that should be
[1:17:45] in the same way in our lives for the
[1:17:47] Excellency of knowing Jesus Christ we
[1:17:49] should be willing to give up everything
[1:17:52] yes and focus totally upon upon him amen
[1:17:57] yes and legal um the legal possessions
[1:18:00] of the abstract means that that you
[1:18:02] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:18:04] lost and we I look at that and we begin
[1:18:07] to say well Adam was an amateur God Adam
[1:18:11] had whatever he spoke that's what
[1:18:12] happened but see before the fall he
[1:18:15] could see into the other realm he could
[1:18:17] see the angels and he had free access to
[1:18:19] God and he knew the will of God yes and
[1:18:22] because he knew the will of God he could
[1:18:24] speak speak and whatever he spoke he
[1:18:26] realized God would honor what he had
[1:18:27] spoken because of the relationship that
[1:18:30] he had with God yes right but after the
[1:18:33] fall that other dimension was cut off
[1:18:35] from him right then he did not know what
[1:18:38] God's will was right and therefore he
[1:18:40] could not have the faith to speak it and
[1:18:42] and believe that God would would answer
[1:18:45] that um and but here again it comes down
[1:18:48] to what we are every everything that
[1:18:50] Adam could do before the
[1:18:52] fall we have the possibility within us
[1:18:55] to do that yes Jesus Christ I me he sent
[1:18:59] the disciples ahead and he said you know
[1:19:03] and all of a sudden they were on the
[1:19:04] road they in a boat going across the Sea
[1:19:07] of Galilee and all of a sudden Jesus
[1:19:09] needed to get to where they were going
[1:19:11] so he just walked on the water amen well
[1:19:13] I've tried that a few times and I I
[1:19:15] don't do well I I get I sink okay but
[1:19:19] Peter found out the same same thing Jes
[1:19:22] all of a sudden Jesus was walking by and
[1:19:24] hi guys how's is it going oh yeah we and
[1:19:26] all said ah this is a spirit this is a
[1:19:29] spirit and then Peter being what he is
[1:19:31] if that's you let me come to where you
[1:19:33] are right Jesus is fine come on yeah he
[1:19:36] stepped out of the boat he walked on the
[1:19:39] water amen as long as his eyes was on
[1:19:42] Jesus Christ yes he walked amen but when
[1:19:45] he looked at the tempests and the waves
[1:19:47] and all of a sudden he began to realize
[1:19:49] this is not natural he began to sing yes
[1:19:52] and then he cried out to Christ and
[1:19:54] Christ down his hand and picked him up
[1:19:56] and they both walk back to the boat yes
[1:19:59] but see if the eyes are on Jesus Christ
[1:20:02] instead of ourselves with the eyes is on
[1:20:04] Jesus Christ instead of our desires and
[1:20:06] and and we and the circumstances around
[1:20:08] us then we have the ability to overcome
[1:20:11] things then we have ability liter to
[1:20:12] walk on the water amen we find out in in
[1:20:16] with with Jesus Christ I mean he could
[1:20:18] take fishes and Loaves and he could
[1:20:19] break the he could break he could take
[1:20:22] he could take this kid's lunch and he
[1:20:23] could feed a multitude
[1:20:25] yes but we've had incidences in in in in
[1:20:28] uh one of the guys was talking about one
[1:20:31] of the guy
[1:20:32] one Aaron's father was missionary to
[1:20:36] Mexico and then some people came and
[1:20:38] they made a pot of of
[1:20:41] soup and all of a sudden they were
[1:20:43] expecting maybe 40 50 people and all of
[1:20:45] a sudden when 150 people show up um how
[1:20:49] are we going to feed all these people we
[1:20:50] only planned for so
[1:20:52] many the report came back that that
[1:20:54] after feeding 150 people the pot had
[1:20:57] never gone down amen every time they
[1:21:00] dipped it in there was more they dipped
[1:21:01] it in there was more they dipped it in
[1:21:03] there was more am well this is this is
[1:21:06] this is a
[1:21:07] possibility why because of who we are
[1:21:10] yes right there was a need God saw that
[1:21:13] need God supplied that need the Miracles
[1:21:16] are not just the Old Testament the num
[1:21:18] Miracles are not just in G the time of
[1:21:20] Jesus the Miracles are are event even
[1:21:22] evident even today yes
[1:21:25] amen we know one guy that he preaches at
[1:21:27] our church periodically when he was born
[1:21:30] he was missing some bones in his
[1:21:32] ankle he went and Henry green I think
[1:21:35] was the one who prayed for him and all
[1:21:37] of a sudden God created the bones that
[1:21:39] were missing yes so he could walk normal
[1:21:44] amen um I mean we've seen things in
[1:21:46] India where where we have gone and we
[1:21:48] have ministered and stuff like that
[1:21:50] we've seen God perform Miracles yes
[1:21:52] right amen it's not limited to the
[1:21:54] Ministry it's not limited to a special
[1:21:56] group of people right but there has to
[1:21:58] be the ability to believe amen and this
[1:22:01] is the limiting factor right if you can
[1:22:04] believe like we sing the song all things
[1:22:06] are possible only believe and we sing
[1:22:08] the song oh yeah that's a nice song but
[1:22:10] do we actually have the reality that if
[1:22:12] you believe it right then you can ex
[1:22:15] then then God will will act upon what
[1:22:17] you believe God will act he's the high
[1:22:19] priest of our confession you confess it
[1:22:22] well then God would then Jesus Christ
[1:22:24] intercedes on our behalf and and and we
[1:22:26] can expect and we can expect what we
[1:22:29] have asked for because he's there to
[1:22:32] intercede on our behalf he there
[1:22:33] pleading our case so to speak amen but
[1:22:36] see God doesn't dwell up in heaven
[1:22:37] someplace he dwells here yes he dwells
[1:22:40] in every one of you well all you have to
[1:22:42] do is have this relationship with Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ if you have that relationship
[1:22:47] with Jesus Christ and you know him and
[1:22:49] and and and and you begin to understand
[1:22:52] who he is and who you are because of him
[1:22:54] then you can begin to you can begin to
[1:22:56] go through the scriptures and you can
[1:22:57] find the promises which are in the word
[1:23:00] and you can begin to claim them for
[1:23:01] yourself
[1:23:03] amen Bible says by his stripes I'm
[1:23:06] Healed okay God can't lie so obviously I
[1:23:10] am yes um so sometimes we get sick and
[1:23:15] well uh yeah I mean I've gone to bed for
[1:23:18] a couple three days letting the body
[1:23:20] repair itself but then they're like with
[1:23:23] my wife she would we were at a youth at
[1:23:26] a youth camp and she slipped and fell
[1:23:28] into a shower and she messed up her
[1:23:31] shoulder by the time that evening came
[1:23:33] she couldn't lift her
[1:23:35] arm we finally went to see a a see a
[1:23:39] doctor orthopedic surgeon and he took
[1:23:42] x-rays and he says well I really don't
[1:23:44] want to do surgery why don't we try
[1:23:46] giving they call it physical exercise or
[1:23:49] physical therapy it's physical torture
[1:23:52] but
[1:23:55] and but she did that for a couple of
[1:23:57] weeks about that time we had our our our
[1:23:59] annual camp meeting and I think it was a
[1:24:02] second day or something like that all of
[1:24:04] a sudden the spirit of God moved through
[1:24:05] the audience before she could lift her
[1:24:08] arm like this after that she were both
[1:24:10] of her arms up and she began to praise
[1:24:12] God Amen right got instantly healed
[1:24:15] praise the Lord I look at my my younger
[1:24:17] brother I mean he had a heart attack if
[1:24:19] it hadn't been that the doctor was
[1:24:21] already prepping to do a to do a heart
[1:24:23] cath on on somebody my brother would
[1:24:26] have died it was because it was the main
[1:24:27] artery yeah and anyway so because they
[1:24:31] got him here and they saw my brother was
[1:24:32] in the midst of having a heart attack so
[1:24:34] they just wheeled him into the operating
[1:24:35] a and just you know they did it yeah
[1:24:39] well that was uh that was on
[1:24:40] Thanksgiving a few years back and anyway
[1:24:43] so I took I'm retired so I don't have
[1:24:46] punch clock anyway so we came in
[1:24:49] December and I we stayed with him
[1:24:52] basically for a whole month to help him
[1:24:54] out and you know and to do what we could
[1:24:56] to encourage and my brother was slowly
[1:24:59] gaining strength he could not walk to
[1:25:00] the mailbox mailbox was well yeah mean
[1:25:04] maybe a quarter mile away because where
[1:25:06] he lived but he began to walk and he
[1:25:08] says no got to go back he said he had
[1:25:11] church service and yeah he he could
[1:25:14] stand up for one
[1:25:16] song after that he had to sit he did not
[1:25:18] have the energy but then one of the
[1:25:21] services all of a sudden God says stand
[1:25:23] up and praise me so he did yeah the next
[1:25:27] day that week he went saw his doctor the
[1:25:31] cardiologist he says wow he says your
[1:25:33] heart's the same as a 20-y old
[1:25:36] amen praise the Lord so I mean you know
[1:25:38] I mean this is I it happened in my
[1:25:41] family I I mean I know these things this
[1:25:42] isn't something that I've heard or read
[1:25:44] about no this is the reality of what I
[1:25:46] see praise the lord well that gives me
[1:25:48] the faith to believe well if you can do
[1:25:50] it for them you can do it for me amen
[1:25:52] and and but here again you have to beli
[1:25:54] that The God Who made the Abraham
[1:25:56] believed that the God who had made the
[1:25:58] promise to him that God was able to
[1:26:00] bring it to pass yes and that's what I
[1:26:03] look at well God this is your word this
[1:26:05] isn't my word this isn't the word of the
[1:26:07] pastor no this is what you yourself have
[1:26:09] said yes well if you have said it and
[1:26:12] it's a promise to me then then you are
[1:26:15] now under obligation to me to fulfill
[1:26:17] your word in my life praise the Lord and
[1:26:20] this is what Abraham he had to wait 25
[1:26:22] years to get the promised son but he
[1:26:25] never failed to believe what God had
[1:26:26] promised God was able to to bring to
[1:26:29] pass amen and this is where we have to
[1:26:30] come right yes in the revelation of
[1:26:33] Jesus Christ brother ban makes a
[1:26:35] statement he says now remember this
[1:26:37] Christ in the true church is a
[1:26:39] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:26:41] Book of Revelation shows that the
[1:26:42] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:26:44] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:26:46] formal and Powerless he said Satan knows
[1:26:49] that that and there's four things we
[1:26:51] have to realize here Satan knows that if
[1:26:54] the people can get a true revelation of
[1:26:56] the true church you have to have that
[1:26:58] Revelation right yes you have to know
[1:27:01] who what what is the true church it's
[1:27:03] the body of Jesus Christ amen that is
[1:27:05] the true church okay so you have the
[1:27:08] people have to get the true revelation
[1:27:10] of who the true church is which is which
[1:27:12] is the body of
[1:27:13] Christ and then what what does this true
[1:27:16] church stand for she stands for the word
[1:27:19] amen she stands for the word that God
[1:27:21] has delivered to the bride in in their
[1:27:23] gener
[1:27:24] praise the Lord okay okay and and then
[1:27:28] and also and
[1:27:29] what what she is which means she has to
[1:27:33] believe that she's she's part of the
[1:27:34] body of Christ and what she stands for
[1:27:37] which happens to be the word and then
[1:27:39] the last part is the hardest part for us
[1:27:41] to to accept and to deal with and she
[1:27:44] has to believe that she can do the
[1:27:46] Greater Works
[1:27:48] amen yes sir and that's where we tend to
[1:27:51] draw back from do we actually believe
[1:27:54] that the god that had made the promise
[1:27:57] is able to do these Greater Works
[1:28:00] through US
[1:28:01] amen because we look at ourselves well
[1:28:04] what am I who am I why should God do why
[1:28:08] should God honor my word why should God
[1:28:10] do the things that I'm asking him to do
[1:28:12] right right because you're his child
[1:28:14] amen because he dwells in you why did he
[1:28:17] dwell in Jesus Christ so he could man
[1:28:19] Express himself to the world yes why is
[1:28:22] he dwelling within the bride so he can
[1:28:24] express himself to the world there's no
[1:28:26] difference here amen but you have to be
[1:28:29] willing to understand what God is trying
[1:28:31] to accomplish and you have to be able to
[1:28:33] realize that the god that is in you
[1:28:35] wants to live and to manifest himself
[1:28:37] through you amen it's not about you it's
[1:28:39] about him it's not you performing The
[1:28:42] Miracles it's allowing him to do it
[1:28:44] through you it's not you doing something
[1:28:46] for God it's it's you dying to yourself
[1:28:49] so that the god in you can live his life
[1:28:51] and express himself through you amen
[1:28:53] it's not about us it's about him yes if
[1:28:55] we focus on him instead of on us then
[1:28:58] everything then it changes praise the
[1:29:00] Lord I mean yeah we get up we we have
[1:29:03] aches and pain the older you get the
[1:29:04] more that you seem to accumulate them
[1:29:08] but you have to begin to understand that
[1:29:11] the god that dwells in me is more than
[1:29:12] able to take care of me amen yes and I
[1:29:16] and anyway but I have to believe that he
[1:29:18] will do that yes okay and once we once
[1:29:21] we believe that we God can actually do
[1:29:23] that through us then we become this
[1:29:25] invincible Army Invincible means
[1:29:27] undefeatable which means Satan will
[1:29:29] attack us and we just say get out of
[1:29:31] here I don't want to you around right I
[1:29:34] mean another kind of a humorous thing
[1:29:36] kind of sort
[1:29:38] of um Satan Satan was causing my wife to
[1:29:42] cough I mean she just coughed and
[1:29:44] coughed and coughed and coughed well it
[1:29:46] was bedtime I like to sleep that okay I
[1:29:52] can't sleep when she's coughing
[1:29:55] so she was nice enough to go in the
[1:29:56] front room and try and sleep on
[1:29:59] the the easy chair and I was trying in
[1:30:02] bed to sleep but she was coughing so
[1:30:06] loud keeping me awake imagine that and
[1:30:10] so I got mad not at her I got mad at
[1:30:14] Satan Satan you're causing my wife to
[1:30:17] cough that's keeping me awake Satan get
[1:30:20] out of here amen she quit coughing we
[1:30:24] got to go to sleep
[1:30:26] amen I mean I mean it sounds humor but
[1:30:29] really I we because of who we are
[1:30:32] because God dwells in us we have
[1:30:34] authority over Satan amen we have the
[1:30:37] ability to tell Satan to pack his bags
[1:30:39] and get out yes and he he doesn't have
[1:30:42] to obey me he has to obey the word yes
[1:30:46] and and if what I'm speaking is the word
[1:30:48] of God to him he has to obey because I
[1:30:51] have the authority over him amen because
[1:30:53] Jesus gave disciples Authority he says
[1:30:55] go into the villages round about you
[1:30:57] heal the sick raise the Dead cast out
[1:30:58] Dem I've given you that Authority now
[1:31:00] freely use it he never took that back
[1:31:03] amen well so I still have that Authority
[1:31:06] we all have that Authority yes it's not
[1:31:08] just the preacher amen it's every single
[1:31:11] person yes sir that Authority rests
[1:31:13] within sight of you amen true and the
[1:31:16] Philadelphia Church brother Brown says
[1:31:18] please remember that in the Stant age
[1:31:20] started the Reformation that must go on
[1:31:23] on until the grain that was planted at
[1:31:25] Pentecost goes goes through the full
[1:31:27] cycle of planting watering and
[1:31:29] nourishing until it comes back to the
[1:31:31] original
[1:31:32] seed the seed that was planted at and
[1:31:35] what was the seed it was Christ yes
[1:31:38] that's what was planted at Pentecost now
[1:31:40] that seed has to come to full expression
[1:31:42] full manifestation and who what is he
[1:31:45] going to come to full manifestation in
[1:31:47] in his body which is the bride amen and
[1:31:50] this but and but it has coming to the
[1:31:52] place now where that seed has to come to
[1:31:54] full manifestation and but we have to
[1:31:57] begin to realize who we are right amen
[1:31:59] we have to begin to realize I am the
[1:32:02] body of Jesus Christ I I I am I am I
[1:32:07] Jesus Christ let's
[1:32:09] see I am the body of Jesus Christ here
[1:32:12] on Earth because I am a part of him it
[1:32:15] doesn't make me Jesus Christ but Jesus
[1:32:18] Christ dwells inside of me and now what
[1:32:20] He is wanting to do is he's wanting in
[1:32:22] my body to be able to live and express
[1:32:24] himself through me yes but I have to
[1:32:27] allow him to have to have the
[1:32:29] preeminence to have the control right
[1:32:31] yes you know one of the things that do
[1:32:34] you realize you can stop God
[1:32:38] right say can't but you
[1:32:41] can because if God tells you to do
[1:32:44] something and you refuse then all of a
[1:32:45] sudden you stop God yes I mean we had a
[1:32:49] friend of ours that he had a he had
[1:32:52] surgery on his elbow and uh yeah the
[1:32:55] doctors did the best they could and now
[1:32:57] an infection set in well they treated
[1:32:59] with the antibiotics this that and the
[1:33:01] other and fin knew God told me he says
[1:33:03] you're not dealing with a physical
[1:33:05] problem now you're dealing with a
[1:33:06] spiritual problem Satan is what has
[1:33:08] causing that infections to remain amen
[1:33:12] so I drove to the hospital and uh we
[1:33:15] visited for a few minutes and he kind of
[1:33:17] wondered why are you here you know I
[1:33:20] mean it's we were friends it's not but I
[1:33:23] he knows how I hate to get to Charlotte
[1:33:25] I hate the traffic I hate C everything
[1:33:28] and why did you come I say well God sent
[1:33:30] me here because God told me he says we
[1:33:33] have a spiritual problem here that's a
[1:33:34] demon causing that infection amen so we
[1:33:37] cast out the demon yes and I went home
[1:33:41] and that's when the healing began right
[1:33:43] praise the Lord because I could I I
[1:33:45] could command it because I God sent me
[1:33:48] there for that purpose amen and I
[1:33:50] realized God sent me there for that
[1:33:52] purpose yes and if he said me there for
[1:33:54] that purpose that God will honor what I
[1:33:56] say because it's him amen it's no longer
[1:33:59] me yes right when we go on and we look
[1:34:02] at Revelations 10 he says in the days of
[1:34:05] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:34:07] shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:34:09] God's going to be going to come to
[1:34:11] completion going to be
[1:34:13] finished well what is this mystery of
[1:34:15] God Paul talks about it in one of his
[1:34:17] letters he says what is the mystery of
[1:34:18] God he says it's Christ Living in you
[1:34:22] amen because it's see under under the
[1:34:25] law God could not come and dwell in the
[1:34:28] people amen they were trying by their
[1:34:31] own efforts to live a law yes and that's
[1:34:34] people are still trying to do that today
[1:34:36] in Christianity right well I'm a
[1:34:38] Christian that means I have to live a
[1:34:40] certain kind of life I have to make sure
[1:34:42] I don't go certain places I got to watch
[1:34:43] my language so I don't say the bad
[1:34:45] things and and so that but that's
[1:34:48] Pharisees yes amen okay but when God
[1:34:51] lives inside of you and he begins to
[1:34:53] change your nature yes that's different
[1:34:56] yes because that's now that's the
[1:34:58] mystery of God but the mystery of God is
[1:35:01] going to come where as God dwelt in
[1:35:02] Jesus Christ and God was able to express
[1:35:05] himself totally through that man through
[1:35:07] that through that that body now he wants
[1:35:10] to do the same thing through US yes
[1:35:12] right Jesus Christ had to give the had
[1:35:14] to give the god that dwelt in him total
[1:35:16] preeminence total control amen now we
[1:35:19] have to give him total control also
[1:35:22] until that happens that's not going to
[1:35:24] work right amen I mean when I'm driving
[1:35:27] a car I have total preeminence most of
[1:35:29] the time um because I turn the wheel and
[1:35:34] goes that way I turn it goes that way I
[1:35:36] push on the gas goes up hit the brake
[1:35:38] and supposed to stop you know I have the
[1:35:41] preeminence yeah but all of a sudden now
[1:35:44] with these new electronic gadgets inside
[1:35:46] it'll do things that I'm not telling it
[1:35:49] to do true um
[1:35:52] okay but
[1:35:54] here again when I'm in control I have I
[1:35:57] have the preeminence in that
[1:35:59] vehicle well now I have to take this
[1:36:02] vehicle and give it give this give God
[1:36:04] that dwells in me the preeminent so he
[1:36:06] can drive this vehicle amen so he can
[1:36:09] guide it he can direct it he can
[1:36:10] instruct it and he can speak through it
[1:36:13] right
[1:36:14] okay because it goes on in in uh in
[1:36:17] Revelations 108 there was a command to
[1:36:19] John he said and a voice which I heard
[1:36:21] from Heaven spake to me again and said
[1:36:23] go and take the little book which is
[1:36:24] open in the hand of the Angel it
[1:36:26] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:36:28] and he said he went to the angel and and
[1:36:31] and John said to the angel give me the
[1:36:33] book and the angel said eat it until you
[1:36:36] and that book becomes the
[1:36:39] same well this is the book right and
[1:36:43] this is what we have to eat and so we
[1:36:46] and this becomes the same
[1:36:49] amen right you don't
[1:36:54] when when when normally speaking we eat
[1:36:58] two or at least two meals sometimes
[1:37:00] three meals a day because the body is
[1:37:03] demanding that we feed it
[1:37:06] okay if we would if we would feed on the
[1:37:09] word as much as we do on
[1:37:11] food then we would be further along in
[1:37:13] our Christian walk amen my opinion
[1:37:17] that's right
[1:37:19] um and when I study the word especially
[1:37:22] for ministering all of a I mean I get
[1:37:24] into the word and I try and research
[1:37:25] this and research that and all of a
[1:37:27] sudden I something strikes me and I
[1:37:30] figure wow this is great in fact I think
[1:37:34] before we came I was studying for these
[1:37:37] sermons and all of a sudden God revealed
[1:37:39] something to me and I got
[1:37:40] excited so I I she was fixing dinner so
[1:37:43] we were sitting I said no no just just
[1:37:45] put it out put it down just I got to
[1:37:47] share this with you yeah yeah because it
[1:37:50] excited me that much yeah but see when I
[1:37:53] get into the word now and all of a
[1:37:55] sudden God begins to open it and he's
[1:37:56] opening it more and more all of a sudden
[1:37:58] the excitement comes there because the
[1:38:00] anointing comes and his presence com
[1:38:02] amen and I'm living in a realm that's
[1:38:04] not mine that I'm not that I don't do
[1:38:06] all of the time it should but I don't
[1:38:09] but we have to begin to understand if we
[1:38:11] get into the word and he will open it to
[1:38:14] you amen not just the ministry right yes
[1:38:17] to the bride because you have to know
[1:38:20] the word you have to know what it says
[1:38:22] you have to get your you have to be get
[1:38:24] the revelation of who you are amen and
[1:38:26] the only way you're can get that
[1:38:28] Revelation is you have to get into the
[1:38:29] word you have to listen to what God has
[1:38:32] trying to tell us to the prophet right
[1:38:33] and it's not just listening to the
[1:38:34] message it's getting into this book amen
[1:38:37] yes amen
[1:38:40] right I mean I read this as much as I do
[1:38:43] anything else because it's a my my
[1:38:46] father taught me he says everything you
[1:38:48] believe you have to find in the pages of
[1:38:50] this book yes that's right everything
[1:38:53] yes so when brother Bron makes a
[1:38:54] statement I
[1:38:56] figured where's that in here not that I
[1:38:58] question right but this is my Foundation
[1:39:02] yes sir everything I believe I have to
[1:39:05] find it in here because on this I can
[1:39:07] rest yes anyway amen
[1:39:15] true and proving his word brother Banner
[1:39:18] makes a
[1:39:21] statement he said the bride is see the
[1:39:24] bride is called in the day when the son
[1:39:26] of man will be revealed what to join the
[1:39:28] church to the head to unite the marriage
[1:39:31] of the Bride the bridegroom call will
[1:39:33] come right through this when the son of
[1:39:35] man will come down and come in human
[1:39:37] flesh to unite the two together the
[1:39:39] church has to be the word he is the word
[1:39:42] and the two unites together and to do
[1:39:44] that it'll take the manifestation of the
[1:39:46] revealing of the son of man and that's
[1:39:48] what God did in the prophet yes when he
[1:39:51] would stand there and through under the
[1:39:53] this was the revealing of the son of man
[1:39:55] this was God taking so much possession
[1:39:57] of that vehicle until that what what
[1:40:00] would that was no longer brother Brown
[1:40:01] speaking that was God speaking through
[1:40:03] him amen and when we get back to what we
[1:40:06] what we were reading here in our in our
[1:40:08] in our in our our text he says he says
[1:40:12] that they may be one Lord even you and I
[1:40:14] are one I and them and thou and me that
[1:40:16] they may be maybe maybe may may be made
[1:40:19] perfect in one but see God did that in
[1:40:22] the prophet my opinion but what did what
[1:40:25] was God trying to do he was trying to
[1:40:27] say you see if I can do this in him I
[1:40:29] can do it in you amen if I can so live
[1:40:33] in this man until until until he can
[1:40:35] yield himself unto me such that I can
[1:40:37] speak through him and I can Minister
[1:40:39] through him he says if I can do it in
[1:40:40] him who's a sinner saved by grace I can
[1:40:43] do it in you also right it's a different
[1:40:45] office I'm not disputing that I don't
[1:40:47] want that office but I also realize that
[1:40:49] The God Who dwells in me if I will yield
[1:40:51] myself to that God that dwells in in me
[1:40:53] that God in Me can express himself and
[1:40:55] manifest and if I will like he can speak
[1:40:58] he can speak his words through me amen
[1:41:00] that's
[1:41:02] right and God demonstrated that through
[1:41:04] the prophet he goes on he says it's a
[1:41:07] son of man Jesus Christ will come down
[1:41:09] in human flesh Among Us and will make
[1:41:11] his word so real until it'll unite the
[1:41:13] church and him as one amen the bride the
[1:41:17] one the bride and she'll go home to the
[1:41:19] wedding supper the when with the word
[1:41:21] when the word here unites with the
[1:41:22] person they too become one yes and this
[1:41:26] is the Oneness that that Jesus Christ
[1:41:28] was talking about to the disciples where
[1:41:31] we literally become one with him and
[1:41:33] when we become one with him it's no
[1:41:35] longer I who live but now it's Christ
[1:41:37] Living in me and you know it's
[1:41:39] interesting when God had taken
[1:41:42] Adam and he took him from theophany form
[1:41:44] and put him in in temples of clay the
[1:41:48] the other half of him which was e was
[1:41:50] still residing in theophany form at
[1:41:52] least that's my understanding
[1:41:54] but see Eve always was a part of Adam
[1:41:57] yes eventually God reached into Adam and
[1:42:00] took a part out out of Adam and made a
[1:42:02] body for Eve to live in right and God
[1:42:05] called their name Adam yes now it was
[1:42:09] Adam living in two
[1:42:11] bodies yes because she literally was
[1:42:13] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:42:16] amen well now you have to come and
[1:42:18] relate that to us in Jesus Christ he
[1:42:20] calls our name Jesus Christ yes because
[1:42:23] we are united with him God does not when
[1:42:27] God looks at a family he regard he he
[1:42:29] regards those two individuals as a
[1:42:31] single entity yes amen well now because
[1:42:35] we are part of Jesus Christ and we are
[1:42:37] his bride now he regards us as a single
[1:42:40] entity so when God looks at us when God
[1:42:42] looks at me all he's looking at is the
[1:42:44] body that I'm part of and that body is
[1:42:46] Jesus Christ and therefore I as
[1:42:47] righteous as he is righteous I'm as holy
[1:42:49] as he is Holy amen not because I am but
[1:42:52] because I in him right and being in him
[1:42:55] is what makes the difference
[1:43:00] amen amen and the latest here in church
[1:43:03] brother V makes this statement he he he
[1:43:06] says um the Lutheran spoke startor a
[1:43:10] momentary consideration of church
[1:43:11] history will prove how accurate this
[1:43:13] thought is in the Dark Ages the word was
[1:43:15] almost entirely lost to the people but
[1:43:17] God sent Luther with the word and the
[1:43:19] Lutheran spoke for God at that time amen
[1:43:22] amen God was revealing himself through
[1:43:25] Martin Luther yes God was God was
[1:43:28] delivering a message to the bride
[1:43:30] through that individual yes but they
[1:43:32] organized and again the pure word was
[1:43:33] lost for organization sin where dog was
[1:43:35] and treat he said and God sent Wesley
[1:43:38] and he was the voice with the word at
[1:43:40] his sake and the people who took his
[1:43:42] Revelation from God became the living
[1:43:44] Epistles read and known of all men for
[1:43:45] their generation yes so here again God
[1:43:48] God chose a man and through that man
[1:43:50] through John Wesley he he delivered
[1:43:53] through that
[1:43:54] man a message to to the Bride of his age
[1:43:58] yes and that was sanctification am claim
[1:44:00] to be a Christian you better start
[1:44:02] living likewise I mean that that was
[1:44:04] basically in so many words and the
[1:44:07] people listened to what God was speaking
[1:44:09] through him and they Sanctified
[1:44:10] themselves they cleaned up their lives
[1:44:12] and they began to live lives of Holiness
[1:44:14] and
[1:44:15] Purity when the method has failed God
[1:44:18] raised up others and so it has gone on
[1:44:19] through the years until in this last day
[1:44:21] there's again another people in the and
[1:44:23] who under their Messenger will be the
[1:44:24] final voice of the final age amen yes
[1:44:27] sir the church is no longer the
[1:44:28] mouthpiece of God it is it is his own
[1:44:30] mouthpiece so God is turning on her he
[1:44:33] will confound her through the prophet
[1:44:35] and the bride for the voice of God will
[1:44:37] be in her
[1:44:38] amen it's not just the prophet it comes
[1:44:42] to us right now we are the to be the
[1:44:45] final voice we are to be the final
[1:44:47] expression of God to this age amen what
[1:44:50] was the revelation God had given to
[1:44:52] brother Bram he says you are the sons of
[1:44:54] God you were a part of God from the
[1:44:55] beginning and because you were a part of
[1:44:57] God now you have come into manifestation
[1:44:59] because now you have come into
[1:45:00] manifestation and you are the part you
[1:45:02] are a part of God now you have to start
[1:45:04] living as as as a part of God Amen you
[1:45:07] have to realize who you are and what you
[1:45:09] are you have to realize what dwells
[1:45:11] inside of
[1:45:13] you I mean it you know it's
[1:45:16] it's what dwells inside of me it's the
[1:45:20] lust it's everything God is is amen
[1:45:24] dwells here not in fullness
[1:45:28] no we have electric circuits electric
[1:45:31] circuits is tied to a fuse box the fuse
[1:45:33] box will allow so much amperage to flow
[1:45:36] through it right okay I know we have in
[1:45:38] our trailer we have 10 amps 15 amps we
[1:45:41] have one that's 30 amp and 40 amp
[1:45:44] depending on the size of the wire
[1:45:47] actually um but
[1:45:53] in that F in there in theory you can
[1:45:56] access all of the power of God in
[1:46:00] America because of the the way wires are
[1:46:03] all connected the limiting factor is the
[1:46:05] fuse
[1:46:07] box well in us there is no between with
[1:46:10] us and God there is no fuse box right
[1:46:13] amen okay we have access to everything
[1:46:16] God Is
[1:46:18] Right what we speaking it can be him
[1:46:21] himself speaking through us there's no F
[1:46:24] but it the limiting factor is your
[1:46:27] ability to believe amen if you don't
[1:46:29] have much Faith you got a 5 a fuse yeah
[1:46:33] it doesn't take much to trip it yeah but
[1:46:35] then you start all of a sudden getting
[1:46:37] to know God and beginning to understand
[1:46:39] who you are because of Calvary and it
[1:46:40] already goes back to the Cross amen it's
[1:46:44] it's it's amazing to people that in in
[1:46:46] this message they have forgotten Calvary
[1:46:48] amen everything I need I find at the
[1:46:51] cross everything if I need healing there
[1:46:54] stripes if I need peace he paid for it I
[1:46:57] need salvation he paid for it for
[1:46:59] Redemption he bought me he redeemed me
[1:47:01] at the cross because I was a part of him
[1:47:03] everything I need is at the cross
[1:47:05] everything without exception true so I
[1:47:09] always go back to the
[1:47:10] Crossen because that that's my typos to
[1:47:13] God and every and everything that that
[1:47:14] that that he is
[1:47:16] amen yes
[1:47:20] sir it goes on ladies in church AG he
[1:47:23] says but now now he's standing in the
[1:47:25] midst of the church he stands there
[1:47:26] revealing who he is in this last age he
[1:47:29] calls himself the author of the creation
[1:47:31] of God this is another creation this has
[1:47:33] to do with the church this is special
[1:47:35] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:47:37] of that church the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:47:39] created his own
[1:47:40] bride God created you yes warts and all
[1:47:45] yes all of your mistakes and all of your
[1:47:47] shortcomings and all all of the the
[1:47:49] problems you have in your personalities
[1:47:51] and it's part of you
[1:47:53] that was in there God created you with
[1:47:55] that yes some of that you have to
[1:47:58] overcome some of that you have to bury
[1:48:00] some of that you have there's something
[1:48:02] within all of our lives there
[1:48:04] continually TR we're continually trying
[1:48:06] to overcome our flesh we're continually
[1:48:08] trying to overcome the the the the the
[1:48:10] the the um the nature the animal nature
[1:48:14] okay that we that we were born with amen
[1:48:16] okay we're constantly trying to overcome
[1:48:18] that and the only way to overcome that
[1:48:20] is to yield to The God Who dwells in US
[1:48:22] he can he is the only one that can
[1:48:24] overcome it but we have to yield to him
[1:48:27] in order for that to happen anyway amen
[1:48:31] he go of him it says l a body hast thou
[1:48:33] father prepared for me God not God not
[1:48:35] Mary provided that body Mary was the
[1:48:38] human incubator and she carried the holy
[1:48:40] child and brought him to birth he was a
[1:48:43] God man he was the son of God he was of
[1:48:48] a new creation man and God met and
[1:48:50] joined and he was the first of a new
[1:48:52] race he was the head of this new race
[1:48:55] and we have to realize this pertains to
[1:48:57] us yes you accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:49:00] savior you repent of your sins yes you
[1:49:02] go through water baptism declaring
[1:49:04] you've died to yourself and if your
[1:49:07] repentance was sincere then God will
[1:49:09] come and and God by his holy spirit he
[1:49:11] will come and inside of you amen the
[1:49:13] holy spirit is not the third person of a
[1:49:15] trinity the holy spirit is is is the
[1:49:18] logos now coming and living in you amen
[1:49:21] and so when you receive the the Holy
[1:49:23] Spirit when you receive that logos
[1:49:24] dwelling inight what are you you are the
[1:49:27] God man or the god woman because now God
[1:49:31] himself lives inside of you the same way
[1:49:33] it lived inside of Jesus Christ the same
[1:49:35] way lived in Paul and Barnabas and all
[1:49:37] the rest of the people in the same way
[1:49:39] he lived in brother
[1:49:40] Bram there's no difference here right
[1:49:43] the difference is our ability to be able
[1:49:45] to yield to The God Who dwells in US yes
[1:49:49] we become the limiting factor and that
[1:49:52] limiting factor because of our lack of
[1:49:53] faith right brother R goes on he says
[1:49:56] this new creation is not is not an old
[1:49:58] creation made over it could not be
[1:50:00] called a new creation it's exactly what
[1:50:02] it says it's a new creation it's another
[1:50:04] creation distinct from the old one out
[1:50:07] of every Kindred tribe of nation he has
[1:50:09] proposed a new creation he was the first
[1:50:11] of that creation he was God created in
[1:50:14] the form of man talking about Jesus
[1:50:16] Christ yes now by his Spirit he is
[1:50:19] creating many sons unto himself God the
[1:50:21] Creator creating himself a part of his
[1:50:23] creation amen God is creating himself in
[1:50:27] you yes he's transforming your character
[1:50:31] he's he's molding god worketh in me to
[1:50:33] willing to do of his good pleasure God
[1:50:35] is creating me into His Image amen I'm
[1:50:37] to be conformed to the very image of
[1:50:39] Jesus Christ yes but I have to be
[1:50:42] willing to submit to that process amen
[1:50:45] and that here again that that that
[1:50:47] become part of the problem but he said
[1:50:50] but he goes on he says this is the true
[1:50:52] revelation of God this was this was his
[1:50:57] purpose the purpose took form through
[1:50:59] election that is why he could look right
[1:51:00] down through the last age when when all
[1:51:03] would be over and see himself still in
[1:51:05] the midst of the church as the author of
[1:51:07] this new creation of God his Sovereign
[1:51:10] power brought it to pass by his own
[1:51:13] decree he elected the members of this
[1:51:16] new creation he predestinated them for
[1:51:19] the adoption of children according to
[1:51:20] the good pleasure of his will and by his
[1:51:23] omniscience and omnipotence he brought
[1:51:25] it to pass amen there's nothing about us
[1:51:29] right there's nothing about me doing
[1:51:33] this is all a work of God Amen and we
[1:51:35] have to understand this we have to be
[1:51:37] willing to submit to this yes you take a
[1:51:41] uh I I don't work with Clay but I work
[1:51:43] with we need to same glass and some
[1:51:45] other thing but but if you what I've
[1:51:47] seen with people with with with Clay
[1:51:49] what they do is they take a a lump of
[1:51:51] clay just
[1:51:53] piece of mud okay they throw it on a
[1:51:57] wheel they have in their mind what this
[1:51:59] is to be right and so they by molding
[1:52:03] and shaping and turning it around and
[1:52:05] around they are they are taking their
[1:52:08] image and bringing this plump of of mud
[1:52:11] into that very image amen well what's
[1:52:14] God doing with us he's taking this lump
[1:52:16] of mud and he's molding and making it
[1:52:19] into His Image amen but the mud has to
[1:52:22] be willing to submit right okay um the
[1:52:26] mud obviously doesn't have a choice but
[1:52:28] we do yes and so God is God has to work
[1:52:32] on us and he and he will put
[1:52:34] circumstances in our path to help us
[1:52:37] conform to His Image amen okay right
[1:52:44] yes the rising of the sun brother R he
[1:52:47] says he says that's what he proved
[1:52:49] Hallelujah that's what es proved he
[1:52:51] wasn't only the word word but he was God
[1:52:53] himself the Dynamics in the word he says
[1:52:56] and now the whole world has to recognize
[1:52:59] that he's alive again yes and that's why
[1:53:01] God had to send a
[1:53:04] prophet it I mean I was raised in the
[1:53:06] Baptist Church nothing wrong with the
[1:53:09] Baptist
[1:53:10] Church but God to me was was something I
[1:53:15] read
[1:53:16] about oh yeah there's something about
[1:53:19] something called a god there's something
[1:53:21] about he Jesus talks about this about
[1:53:23] himself and that about himself and talks
[1:53:25] about different creatures and creators
[1:53:27] and different men know yeah he did nice
[1:53:30] things to different this one he you know
[1:53:32] but it's it was just in the
[1:53:35] book and the preacher would get up and
[1:53:37] the preacher would start telling us
[1:53:38] about this wonderful God who who's
[1:53:40] benevolent and he's going to be nice to
[1:53:42] you and he's going to supply this and
[1:53:44] Supply that okay but he dwells out
[1:53:48] there no brother Bram says no no it's
[1:53:51] not out there right here amen you have
[1:53:54] to take the god that that it's talked
[1:53:56] about in here and bring him into you
[1:53:58] amen and then when you take this God and
[1:54:00] put him inside of you and you begin to
[1:54:02] realize everything that he is now dwells
[1:54:05] inside of you amen that makes the
[1:54:07] difference yes it brings us one step it
[1:54:11] it it takes us from God being like I say
[1:54:14] out in the universe some place and this
[1:54:16] that and the other it takes and makes
[1:54:17] God to become a reality to us this is
[1:54:21] what I saw in the Prophet this why I saw
[1:54:22] in brother B that's that's why I listen
[1:54:24] to him that's why I I you know I have
[1:54:27] confidence in the man I could see God
[1:54:29] living through that man right well how
[1:54:32] could a man stand there and the
[1:54:34] thousands of times could he sit there
[1:54:36] and he could tell people where who they
[1:54:37] were where they live what they were
[1:54:39] coming where you know the problems that
[1:54:41] they were facing and the disease that
[1:54:43] they were they having go how could a man
[1:54:46] do
[1:54:47] that he had never seen these people
[1:54:50] right but he could yield himself to the
[1:54:52] God that was in him and because of the
[1:54:55] god dwelling in him could reveal to him
[1:54:57] what this person's name was where they
[1:54:59] live what their address wasn't the
[1:55:01] doctor that you know the always oh I see
[1:55:03] you I see you oh yeah you're have I see
[1:55:05] this doctor he's you know he's kind of a
[1:55:07] baldheaded man big thick glasses and
[1:55:09] stuff oh and he's talking to you oh he
[1:55:11] says you have this and this and this and
[1:55:12] this wrong with you and and he described
[1:55:15] the doctor he described the doctor's
[1:55:16] visit he even heard what the doctor was
[1:55:18] saying right okay that's not a man right
[1:55:23] yes that's God am amen well okay um and
[1:55:28] and I know other ministers and all of a
[1:55:30] sudden God speaks to them God gives them
[1:55:32] Visions God you know God God speaks to
[1:55:34] them in in in in the way that God deals
[1:55:37] with that individual well God deals with
[1:55:39] me in the way in my own way you know
[1:55:42] like I say when he wants to speak to me
[1:55:44] he has to wait till I'm almost asleep
[1:55:46] that's so any time he can actually get
[1:55:47] through my brain keeps
[1:55:50] okay but then he can get
[1:55:53] through because I'm I'm studying for a
[1:55:55] sermon I figure something's missing
[1:55:57] something's missing I keep thinking
[1:55:58] thinking thinking just as I'm drifting
[1:56:00] off to sleep that's what's missing to
[1:56:04] get up and right right right right but
[1:56:07] still not quite right and TR try to go
[1:56:09] back to sleep and this is I'm drifting
[1:56:12] off oh yeah that's the other piece of
[1:56:15] the puzzle so get up right right right
[1:56:16] right right you know and then when I get
[1:56:18] up in the morning I can look at my
[1:56:19] scribbles and oh yeah this is what God
[1:56:21] was trying to show me then I can put it
[1:56:23] all together I don't know how he works
[1:56:24] with other ministers but that's how
[1:56:26] that's how he deals with me but see God
[1:56:28] speaks to me in that way and there are
[1:56:31] other times all of a sudden we're doing
[1:56:34] something and all of a sudden I
[1:56:36] feel we need to go see this
[1:56:39] person it's just impressed upon me I
[1:56:41] need to go and see this person I need to
[1:56:43] go pray for this person he's not
[1:56:46] speaking to me but all of a sudden I
[1:56:48] have something that comes upon me and
[1:56:50] he's trying to direct me he's trying to
[1:56:52] say you need to do something I'm calling
[1:56:55] you to do something so that you can go
[1:56:57] and you can minister to this
[1:57:00] individual okay even if it's God's
[1:57:02] leading and God takes us there then when
[1:57:04] I'm there then it's no longer me being
[1:57:06] there now it's God doing whatever he
[1:57:09] wants to do through me to that person
[1:57:11] amen and it doesn't limit it to me or or
[1:57:14] the ministers this happens to a lot of
[1:57:16] people lot of I mean this is the Bride
[1:57:18] of Jesus Christ we are the body of God
[1:57:20] we are the body of which God self dwells
[1:57:23] amen and it's not just the third person
[1:57:25] of Eternity no it's the logos that's the
[1:57:26] essence of everything God is yes that's
[1:57:29] what you have access to because that's
[1:57:31] what lives inside of you
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:36] amen he says now the whole world has to
[1:57:39] recognize he's
[1:57:40] alive and he being the groom the bride
[1:57:44] has to come forth because it's a part of
[1:57:45] him and it can only be the manifestation
[1:57:48] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:57:51] anything that was spoken of the bride
[1:57:53] because she is flesh of his flesh and
[1:57:54] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:57:56] of his power she is him a man and woman
[1:57:59] are one and a woman taken from his sight
[1:58:02] she had taken the spirit the feminine
[1:58:04] Spirit from him and that's why God
[1:58:06] created two bodies that's why Adam was
[1:58:08] living in two bodies because she was a
[1:58:11] part of him always well we always were a
[1:58:14] part of Christ we always were a part of
[1:58:15] God now we've come into manifestation
[1:58:18] and so here again this is the unity that
[1:58:20] Jesus Christ was talking about to his
[1:58:21] disciples
[1:58:22] I want you to be one the same way that I
[1:58:24] am the father are one what was it the
[1:58:26] father dwelt in him the same way that
[1:58:28] the father dwelt in him he says that's
[1:58:30] the same way I'm going to live I'm going
[1:58:31] to dwell in you and I'm going to dwell
[1:58:33] in you and I'm going to direct you and
[1:58:35] I'm going to guide you and I'm going to
[1:58:36] speak through you the same way that the
[1:58:37] father is doing this through me and this
[1:58:39] is where we have to come yes amen not
[1:58:43] just the ministry right the bride all of
[1:58:46] us this is where we have to come
[1:58:49] amen and and and it is I brother R says
[1:58:52] see Jesus said at that day you'll know
[1:58:55] that I'm in the Father the father is in
[1:58:57] me I in you and you in me it's God in
[1:58:59] you all that God was he poured into
[1:59:01] Christ and all Christ was he has poured
[1:59:03] into the church so it's God above us God
[1:59:05] With Us and he says now it's God in us
[1:59:07] he said is God condescending coming down
[1:59:10] making his way that he could get back
[1:59:12] and bring his people back to me to make
[1:59:14] manifested sons of God like they had
[1:59:17] them in the Garden of Eden the whole
[1:59:19] world is groaning and waiting for that
[1:59:20] hour for the manifestation of the sons
[1:59:22] of God this is where we're getting
[1:59:26] to why is the world in a turmoil why are
[1:59:28] the judgments falling Upon This World
[1:59:31] why do we have to go through what we
[1:59:32] went through in North Carolina because
[1:59:34] it's God's judgment on this world yes
[1:59:37] well okay if it's time if God's judgment
[1:59:40] is being poured out upon the world and
[1:59:42] we're getting to the time when there
[1:59:44] when the Rapture is supposed to take
[1:59:45] place I need to become I I'm we are
[1:59:49] supposed to be coming to the
[1:59:50] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:59:52] daers of God Amen where God so lives in

[2:00:25] Father the father's in me I'm in you and
[2:00:27] you in me oh I love that Satan gets so
[2:00:30] angry with that see the Oneness of God

[2:00:34] and all that Christ was he poured into
[2:00:36] the church and there you are it makes
[2:00:37] them all
[2:00:39] one

[2:00:47] manifested because he was a son because
[2:00:49] he was begotten but but it was just a
[2:00:52] tabernacle for him to live in no man has
[2:00:55] seen God at any time but the only
[2:00:57] begotten of the father declared him God
[2:00:59] built himself a house a body to live in
[2:01:01] to come down so that we so that we could
[2:01:03] touch him so that he could manifest
[2:01:05] himself to the world Amen Jesus Christ

[2:01:11] that he could come and become our
