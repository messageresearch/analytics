again praise the Lord Jesus amen Psalm number 306 amen we'll sing this uh Jesus on the inside praise the lord we have it on the stream amen help me sing this we don't sing it very often but it seemed very appropriate for U um the subject that we're going to speak on and the Lord put on my heart so we're going to try to sing it amen you used to sing this a lot years ago when I was uh younger but uh just haven't sang in a lot in a while so anybody know this song Yes amen we'll sing it together then praise the Lord Jesus on the inside like I said m is not keying me up because he's not used to playing it because we don't sing it very much so I'm going to try my best to start it and I know he'll find it even if it's in kez he usually finds it so amen it's Jesus on the working toward the outside making a difference in my life it's Jesus on the inside working toward the outside making a difference in my life well it's the Holy Ghost on the inside working toward the outside making a

from our soul to our spirit to our body and it's making a difference in our lives amen if it's not making a difference if you don't see a difference then there's a problem I'm afraid maybe that Jesus might not be on the inside if because if he's in there he's going to make a difference praise the Lord and the more we die to ourselves the more he has preeminence amen so how many would say today Lord just let me die amen just let more and more of me more and more more I'll say I'll say more and more of Newton Bennett amen die so that more of you Lord Jesus can work towards the outside make a

to our thinking we must have the mind of Christ amen I can recall in the scriptures where you made a statement for it sounds to a lot of Believers that it's it doesn't sound right but we know your word is always right amen Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated and Esau the birthright didn't mean anything to him and one day he was starving had just come back from hunting and Lord he sold his

we'll just get right to the scripture amen we'll start back where we left off the Lord's willing I'll probably background a little bit where we left off from last week I just trust the Lord to uh speak today amen from this word as if any of us speak amen yes that includes me if any of us speak it's just us speaking it means nothing amen but when he speaks and yes through any of us when he speaks then it carries weight carry substance amen because it's his word not ours praise the Lord Jesus thank amen so we're going to go back to Psalms chapter 51 again Psalms chapter 51 vers 5 read that verse of scripture as we did last week amen Psalms 515 amen thankful to be a child of God amen amen thank you Lord praise God Amen Psalms 515 we're going to turn and begin our scripture reading there amen but before we do could we just bow our heads for another word of Prayer amen Praise Your Name Lord Jesus thank you Father for abiding with us Lord you not just abide with us but you abide in US Lord those that are uh predestined before the foundation of the world come to that specific time in our lives whatever it may have been whatever year it may have been whatever age we were God to receive your Holy Spirit to receive your truth to be born again Lord and a change taking place in our lives God what it means to be a child of God will never even we I don't think we can humanly grasp what it means Lord to us but we are so very thankful and our human abilities as limited as they are father we we thank you so much for what you've done what you've given who you are your blessings in our lives father what would we do without you God oh Lord we' just be lost and dying in this world like the rest of people but Lord you've given us hope you've given us strength you've given us Faith you've given us what we need to continue to press this battle to continue to carry on Lord with the message that you have given us Lord that is Christ in us the hope of glory amen so Lord may you once again now come Lord and accomplish in this service what you had sent it forth for speak through these lips words you'd have us to hear anoint lips Lord Lord anoint our ears speak to hear Let God that's the only way God that what you want to be done here today is going to be done to anoint us Lord to receive your word for that word to become a part of us and live in us and through us and Lord let us become more and more obedient to that word let us become more and more dead to ourselves Lord that more more of you can live in US Lord forgive all of our sins bless our precious brothers and sisters around the world Lord God who um uh need a touch from you help in every way God we're just seeking and looking for you God to bless us bless those who weren't able to make it today we just commit ourselves Lord in this service into your hands remain be part of it this beautiful communion service that we're about to partake of but Lord we just trust in you to speak to us from your word first and God we just uh give it into your hands believe everything is going to be done in according to your perfect will as we ask it in the precious and lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen Psalms chapter 51 verse5 Psalms 515 behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me you can be seated if you'd like amen I want to go back to other to uh one other scripture that we read in St John chapter 3 uh I'm I'm going to read a couple of scriptures here just right off to just kind of background where we left off from last week uh to get us caught up to this place uh I I know I went probably through more detail than you as a mature Born Again body of Believers needed but there was a a visitor in our midst and I kind of probably described things and went through some things a little more in detail uh hoping maybe that it it didn't confuse her uh so that maybe it would be something that she could grasp instead of uh just coming out and thinking that you know I don't know what he was talking about so uh we laid the scripture in there so to make sure that uh it it takes hold and of course uh I don't know who watches this uh after we're done so uh anyway uh so if it if it seemed a little repetitive to you please forgive me but uh it it is always of course to get us to a specific point that we're headed towards amen and that is our subject of adoption which is what we're going to talk on today so I want to go back to the second scripture we read again uh I'm not going to read the whole thing just just uh St John chapter 3 one verse verse 7 the most important verse St John 3 verse 7 Jesus told U uh Nicodemus at night Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again amen amen you must be born again so before this walk again can ever take place before it can ever begin there has to be a new birth amen before you can ever take your first breath before you could ever take your first step before you could ever take B take your first bite of food you had to be born yes amen naturally to do the same thing spiritually you have to you must be born again that's the only way you can even begin on this journey and that as we said last week is just the beginning of our journey amen that is just the beginning of our journey uh I want to go back over to First John and and go back to there real quick because I want to go in a little more detail about this I didn't do last week uh purposefully uh just for the sake of time uh but uh this week I want to go in a little more in depth about the process that we talked about and look at it scripturally and were it types and shadows in the Old Testament we uh mentioned it just a little bit briefly uh but maybe a little more in detail today but first John chapter 5 I want to read the two verses of scripture I'm not going to read the whole thing again but just two verses first John chapter 5 uh two verses 7 and8 and background this as well John said for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one amen now you can't dispute that you can't deny that unless you just decide to ignore the scripture but the scripture says they are one you can't have three and make them one and that's what trinitarians try to do they say there's three persons in but they're all one no if there's three persons they can agree in one but they're not one amen if there's three persons you got three personalities there's three people there's three entities there's three indiv idual that's three it's not one amen but the Bible says that the three are one amen they're one now uh as as we saw this and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one they're not one but they work in continuity as one yes amen because they agree in one the the spirit the water the blood brings forth that three-step process we know of a new birth getting to a a a a new being and that three steps is what we talked about uh of course last week justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost those three steps they agree in one which makes us uh as individuals uh that we claim to be born again uh one individual of these three that agree because the process of these three bring you to one place so they agree in one this these three bring you to a place of Salvation these three bring you to a place of New Birth amen that's what these that's how they agree in one that's how they bring to one but the father son the Holy Ghost the Father the word the Holy Ghost words logos Christ those three are one praise the Lord that we talked about last week I read this quote I'm going to read it again key to the door brother said see the holy uh the Holy Spirit stays right right straight with the scripture right straight with the scripture amen so when you come up with a Doctrine a belief a thought or as brother denst talked about in his prayer people that try to interpret the word it's got to be according to the scripture and it can't be according to one verse it can't be according to one chapter it's got to be continuity through it continually Genesis to Revelation it can't just be um a a a scripture here or there I've told U uh I believe I've mentioned this before a brother I knew in Florida he talked to so many different things doctrines and things and well brother bam said this and brother bam said that I said but yeah brother you have to run that quote with the rest of the quotes right you have to run that quote with uh uh with the rest of the message and you have to run that quote with the spirit in which it was spoken yeah and that's a lot of times what is missed even with the scripture it has to be believed uh preached in the in the way that it in the spirit that it was brought and a lot of times that's forgotten a lot of times people go off on tangents because they find one quote but now if you take that quote out of context out of the spirit of it if you take it out of the context the spirit of it then you can get your C the tree picking grass right if you put it in continuity with the rest of the scripture then it flows perfectly you can take that puzzle piece and put it exactly where it belongs because it's not misinterpreted it's not misplaced it's not misunderstood it's exactly what the word says well not what not what uh people would say they mean but what it says and they miss that the the interpretation of that because they don't follow it through right so it becomes garbled to them so when brother bam says see the Holy Spirit stays white right with the the scripture it's not just one quote here or there it's not just a verse here or there you could take a certain verse I think even brother green uh made this statement that you could take two scriptures and make a Doctrine out of it um and I believe it was uh uh Judas went and hung himself and you take another and says now you do the same thing and you can make a doctorine say well Judas is car went hung himself you go do the same thing and didn't he say that I think brother green used to say say that yes they say you can make a Doctrine you just take a couple of scriptures and you misplace them you take them out of the spirit of the of the uh and the continuity the the context and you can make it sound anything you want yeah and people go on limbs because of things like that and misinterpret or misplace the things that even the quotes are saying or that the scripture is saying so that's why you know brother BR said the Holy Spirit stays right with the scripture and it's got to go you can't you can't take one and not fit it into the old you can't take a New Testament scripture and not place it in the Old Testament the Old Testament was just the type and Shadow of the new right amen so that's what we're going to talk about in just a minute so it has to stay scripture Genesis the Revelation it's faith in that that unlocks every mystery amen amen the Bible said first John 5:7 there are three that bear record in heaven we just read it father word which is Christ the Holy Ghost these three are are one there are three that bear record in heaven water blood spirit these three are not one but they agree in one amen now you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost they are one but you can be justified without being Sanctified right you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost sanctification is by the blood through the blood comes life and the Holy Ghost is the power of God see through the power that is given to the church the bride the people that power that is given see you can you can be anointed of the Holy Ghost on your flesh and not be born again right but you can't be born again and not having an anointing of the Holy Ghost right amen if he is in you he is with you praise the Lord but that that anointing can be with you you and you not be born again praise the Lord that's why they only agree in one see you can have one without the other the justification sanctification as brother B just said here you can have one without the other right but if you've got the father you've got the son you've got the Holy Ghost these three are one you can't have one without the other because they're one praise the Lord people say well I A lot of times they'll they'll they'll garble even Christians even pastor pastors I've heard ministers they'll say well you know uh this one is Allah and this one is uh whatever they call their different Gods uh and and well yeah but we all worship God no no no no no we don't well they worship all of that's their God they're they're worshiping God no you're not right if you worship the one true God then you if you have the true God you've got the son yes you've got the son you've got his Spirit good you can't take and say well you know we're worshiping God and they're worshiping God and they're worshiping God they're just we're just all worshiping God it's all okay cuz we're all worshiping God no we're not amen you can't have one without the other because they are one you can't split them up and say okay well you can have God we're going to take Jesus they don't believe in Jesus well then you can't have God right you you can't have God if you don't have him amen because they're one praise the Lord so it it it it GS me honestly when I hear Christians ministers even saying well they just we just we're all worshiping God political people sometimes say that you know they have to say that because they want to try to get in favor with everybody because they want their vote right they say well we're all worshiping God it's okay doesn't work that way Saints amen can't have one without the other praise the Lord amen when uh me and my wife become one many years ago but she can be at the supermarket and I can be at work amen praise the Lord Jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father I can't say that I can't say when you've seen me you've seen Sonia that's not true amen there's a lot of people that's known me in my life they've never seen or known my wife at all never met her of any kind couldn't tell you what she looked like stand Al line they wouldn't have a clue who she was amen same as her she's met people probably never met me amen wouldn't pick me out of a lineup because we're not one amen we agree in one sometimes but we're not one God you understand see that God the Father the Son the Holy Ghost they are one am amen and you cannot have one without the other when Jesus said you've seen me you've seen the father he's just telling them we are one yes amen praise the Lord they are one the others they agree in one but they are one so we got this the the the new birth the the process of the new birth uh Peter gave it to us on the day of Pentecost I'll read it again acts 238 we know it Peter said unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise to you and your children uh and to all that are fall for as many as the Lord Our God shall call the repent be baptized filled with the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Born Again amen remember the baptism makes the way for the person of Christ himself amen the three-step process the three steps it come that leads to Calvary it's those three steps that brings us now brother Ram said and I've seen people try to use this to uh to in my opinion throw others off even ministers in the message that brother vam said that full obedience to the word entitles you to the token and people think that that means and I I've heard people say it that that means that you have to uh you have to come to every you have to go to you have to come to a place of of human Perfection then to get the Holy Ghost you can't do anything wrong you can't make any mistakes you can't fall in any way if you fall you're lost or backslid or whatever they want to call it I I I personally I'm I'm not a big fan of the word backslide uh but anyway we'll we'll leave that on the shelf for another time but but but when they get to that place and talk that like that it it it kind of uh uh it kind of makes me uh it makes people feel less than what they are it makes people feel like they have to have they have to have human Perfection before they can even receive the Holy Ghost and that is not true right Amen brother all brother B was talking about is full obedience to the word the word he's talking about for the new birth is acts 238 yes that that's the full obedience to the word repentance there must be full complete repentance baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in the name of some titles but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ entitles you to the Token yes that's full obedience to the word when you fully obey that word you are entitled to the Token are you going to make a mistake after you might make a mistake in the next 10 minutes after Haven got it that's not likely but you might or a bad thought the devil might drop some kind of thought in your mind 30 minutes after your after the birth yeah amen now it's not it's it's not your fault not your mistake you just throw that in the uh Delete category but we're still human we're still in this sticky flesh you're still going to we're still going to make mistakes we're still going to uh be human right amen but people would think that you've got to you've got to come to some human Perfection when Jesus said be ye therefore perfect as her father in Heaven is perfect he means it means full of full age of maturity amen of of a of a full age and how are you going to come even at that how are you going to come to the place of full maturity of a complete mature Christian until you first got the Holy Ghost right amen it it's it's sort of a it's sort of a subth thought of uh excuse me if I've got this wrong and if you watch this and it offends you I'm sorry but the Thunder Doctrine where thinks that you have to have every one of those completely perfected in your life before you can get the Holy Ghost we talked about that when we went through this their thought is each one of these steps if I if I if I recall this correctly if I'm wrong please forgive me uh as far as the people that believe that Doctrine but there are people I know that believe that you have to have that complete Perfection the statute of a perfect man completed in your flesh before you can even get the Holy Ghost my contention is how are you ever going to get to the completion of that in your life unless you've got the Holy Ghost amen I can't do it right none of I human I've tried to we probably all tried to but we can't do it without him amen how can I ever forgive or show godliness or brotherly kindness to someone that has treated me like trash yeah another believer if you will yeah amen how can I have that if I can't if I don't have the Holy Ghost how am I ever going to show brotherly kindness to the brother that's destroyed me and talk about me and put me down and ridiculed me and made fun of me or whatever amen how am I ever going to be able to do that I can't do that in myself right I can only do that because he lives in me that's the only when he takes now my flesh might rise up immediately because I get angry or upset but when you take time to settle down it's like that time I mentioned that brother green talked about when brother bam he wanted to talk to brother bam and he said okay we'll talk talk about that later and brother green walked through the room and brother Brown was sitting there on the couch with his feet across the couch he says now brother Perry about your problem he thought you know he's the one that brought it up and took him by surprise he said sit down here he said now you've got to do the same thing I do didn't even tell him what his problem was but you know he didn't have to yeah he knew what the problem was but he said you've got to do what I do now what a revelation yeah to know that brother brandham was what just a man and he's got to do it the same way amen live it the same way and that's the only way to bring this flesh under subjection he said now when you can come to yourself remember that's the most important part when you can get a hold of yourself you say Lord forgive me for thinking like that Lord forgive me for acting like that and make it right amen somebody might say something about you or put you down or whatever and you might rise up and you might be angry about it it might upset you you might even act in a way that you shouldn't have I've done that before but when you get to yourself and you get to the place it's just you and God you can come to yourself that was brother Ram's words brother great you can come to yourself then you can begin to expound these attributes in your life amen and it can only come from having a new birth can only come from being born again can only come from the life of God in you only way it can come now these three steps to justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost we talked about the most dangerous spot we're going to get to that here acts 238 repent be baptized receive the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the same thing that happened the new birth with with God's original bride the children of Israel with God's original bride his children uh uh in the beginning when they came out of bondage which is what we all did amen we all come out of bondage yes when we came to the Lord cuz we were all we all thought we were free we all thought we were Liber we all thought well I can do whatever I want whenever I want however I want whatever I'm free I can drink I can cuss I can gamble I can live a righteous life doesn't matter I'm free I can do whatever I want amen I'm free to do we all thought we were free we were never more in bondage than we were at that moment right amen the only Liberation the only Freedom that comes is when you give your life to Christ yes amen and Christ frees you amen now you still you can still live however you want you can still do whatever you want you can still drink and cuss and Gamble and you can still do all those things you just don't want to anymore amen God takes the want to away amen praise the Lord amen when the wants to when the want to is gone it doesn't it's it doesn't mean anything you know can I say I'm going to be brutally honest about myself I was talking to uh I've mentioned the guy that lives here in town name's Doug's on our team uh kind of being a little self-destructive drink smokes and uh just does stuff that you know it just like it doesn't seem like he really cares if he lives or dies sometimes I told him I I said did not even care I mentioned I mentioned the other day about the thing he's talking about the liver and the money he cared more about the money that he did his liver that's the same guy and I was talking to him the other day and uh uh I I said you know I I remember um a time when I got drunk when I would drink I was way younger than the legal drinking age but I guess nobody cared I'd go in the bar with the guys I worked with and sit right there with the rest of them and you know know they didn't seem to care they' give you as much as you want uh get blind drunk I remember going home I remember driving myself home well I don't remember driving myself home that was the problem but I remember later that I was at one place at one time and the next time I'm home and I think how did that happen how did I even get home and I told him I said in that PL in that place at that point before me and Sonia got married uh the Lord started working with me amen cuz even at that time and and the one two hadn't gone yet but even at that time I started thinking this is just stupid why would anybody do this anything could have happened between to me between point a and point B why would anybody ever get themselves like that why would anybody ever do that I don't understand the stupid thing is I did it again and didn't remember and I um I remember falling down in the bathroom and hitting the little door stopper thing at the bottom of the door and it goes you know those I remember that uh why my par didn't come out of the room I don't know but I got myself got into the room went to bed and I thought I this is just stupid why do you do this first thing I never never like the taste of beer never in my life I drank it anyway but I never liked it never liked the taste of liquor hated it did never like the taste of it it's horrible but it did it anyway it was a thing to do it's kid you free drink do whatever you want it's right there you could be cool I never liked it to start with and the second time like this is this is just stupid and and this is common for people this becomes comedy for people to talk about in stories I I even even some of the guys on the team that talk about stories like that and I just sat there I've sat there before I've said why would you do that anything could have happened to you between here and there I know the Lord was watching over me but I didn't know that then but even then I thought why do you do that this is just stupid you don't even like it to start with why would you drink it well the others are drinking it this is what they're doing you know blah blah so and so and honestly I didn't quit but I basically quit I even I even got to the place to where the guys I worked with they were older a lot older than me they were like yeah we're taking on a bachelor party before I married Sonia said no no I'm not going yes we're going to take you no I'm not going to go and they said we're taking you whether you like it or not and I finally got to the place I was I was 19 I was a kid I was 19 19 years old and I thought no I'm not going to go and they said we're taking you whether you like it or not and I thought okay I said but I'm not going the night before my wedding I'm not going the night before it's got to be the night before the night before got to be two nights before I'm not doing it you can put me in shackles I'm not going the night before so we come to an agreement cuz I was just I was wasn't going to do that anymore Saints I just wasn't going to do it it just me as even as a kid I know I look at it now and I know God was dealing with me amen and I don't know why I'm saying all this maybe it's speaking to somebody but I I thought why I'm doing all this I was not going to do it again but they they persuaded me they pushed me they basically forced me I said okay just not going to be in the night before my wedding the night before the night before okay and uh did it again and that was it that I was drunk and that's the last time never did it again amen I I just quit it's like and I wasn't I didn't give my heart to the Lord I didn't I wasn't a Christian in in my opinion I didn't live for God I wasn't doing it because of that I wasn't doing it because he took the want away stuff's disgusting anyway I don't know why anybody would drink it but anyway it there was no taking the I just wasn't going to do it period I didn't care her with with I don't care what they said I don't care I wasn't I wasn't worried about any of that so me and my wife got married I i' never do that again and I think why do people do that but I can look back and know Saints I know that it's just God in my life it's God watching over you God protecting you God being with you the whole way even to the point before you're born again and God you think God takes the want away I I didn't even want it even before I gave my heart to him amen I didn't I didn't care to do it me and Sonia would go to a Mexican restaurant and have a margarita or something like that it wasn't like that cuz we weren't Christians we weren't living for God we were just worldly people went with my brothers and all that and I was not I was but by the time I got 21 where I could legally drink I quit drinking but it it was just the point that God take God that watches over you and takes care of you and protects you and helps you and and watches over you and to the point that when when you get to that place even of a new birth it just seems so simple it seems like I I've had people that come up and say well you know they think if they if they become Christians or they commit to the Lord or they give their heart to God or they repent they got to give everything up well I I can't smoke anymore then I can't drink anymore I said I didn't tell you to quit smoking or drinking I said I I just said give your heart to the Lord just repent and give your heart to the Lord I didn't tell you to quit doing this stuff just give your heart to God Amen that's all you got to do if you give if you truly give your heart to God and you truly repent God will take it away God will help you it may not be immediately I got criticized I think I've told you before a brother that had a good heart he loved the Lord he came to church he was faithful he brought his family but he still smoked but he came up to me one day and he wanted to get baptized I said okay I said it's just like this sister that was here the other day she said well what do I need to do first I said exactly what the scripture says repent amen you fully repent to the Lord You're you are truly sorrowful for your past life and your past in your Disobedience and you repent from that and get baptized he's obligated to give you the Holy Ghost amen the new birth amen if you do that did she ask me that and and and that's what brings Christ into your life yes amen that's what makes the difference so it's it's like when she asked me when I tell people so well I I got to quit so he wanted to get baptized and uh uh I said okay and he said well you know and I went through the same thing we discussed it talked to him about it he had a sincere heart he loved the Lord and so he came forth and we took him and baptized him in a retention pond in Florida St Augustine Florida to baptized him in a retention p and I got criticized by people in the church right well one specific person because I baptized a man that was still smoking and I think what better way to clean the man up than to put him under the faucet amen amen how do you get mud off of you go in the shower and you wash off what better way to help wash them clean than under the SP it amen amen let him set under the word let him set under the spirit let him sit under Christ let him sit under the water and let God wash it all the way amen amen I said plus I believe I can't remember if it's Billy Paul but uh I I remember the story where uh this guy did the same thing brother Brandon baptized him he still smoked and people people criticized brother Bram for baptizing a man that smoked he said well you're not brother brandom I said well neither are you but I said one time uh the guy wanted uh cigarettes and he wanted to buy cigarettes and brother Brandon went down and saw some brother and he said now here's some money he said I can't I can't take God's money uh to buy this man cigarettes amen but if you would go take a carton of cigarettes buy a carton of cigarettes take him up to the man hand them to him and say these are for brother brandham he said we do that he said yeah brother BR I'll do that he went and bought the carton cigarettes took his money not brother R's money took his money went and bought the carton cigarettes he hand them to the man in the hospital bed and said here now these are from Brother brand he said the man never smoked another cigarette in his life am never even touched the carton that he just bought for him never smoked another one amen you don't know what it does what it takes it's God but you just give your heart to the Lord don't worry about the rest right God will take care of it amen just get them out the SP it let God was them clean yes that's what God that's his specialty is cleaning them up but the worst place a person can be is is in a place where they've been Justified and Sanctified they feel like they're okay but they haven't gone and got received the Holy the Holy Ghost they haven't been born again so we got in the in Israel as we talked about the same type as we have the scripture let's go through this if we can real quick in the scripture to the New Birth that they had remember we talked about God gave them a Promised Land a physical land that they were to go to and inhabit and take over right amen we talked about that last week that was their placement that was their inheritance that was their adoption a place that they were to go to it was their Promised Land remember what our Promised Land is Our promised land is the Holy Ghost amen God promised us the Holy Spirit repent be baptized and you shall rece be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost amen that's our promis L that's the promise God gave to us but for the three-step process that we go through in Repentance and baptism the the the children of Israel did the same thing in their justification they went that they came out of Egypt with Moses that was their justification they came out of the World when they came out of the world through Moses they became justified in their own place now they weren't subject to the Egyptians they weren't slaves to the Egyptians or any of that they came out of sin they came out of the world it's just like uh the glass in the chicken yard remember the glass in the chicken yard you can take the glass out of the chicken yard and it's Justified it's no longer in the chicken yard amen it's just set here it's just a glass setting here amen it's still full of whatever substance was in the chicken yard which you can imagine but it was but it's Justified it's no longer in the chicken yard yarden it's not clean yet it's filthy and not fit to use but it's not in the world anymore right that's Justified amen when you come out you uh and no longer part of it is justification when they came out of Egypt they were Justified they did that under Moses when they came across the Red Sea Into the Wilderness through Moses again amen sanctification uh in uh coming across even a representation of water if you will they didn't they didn't get wet because the Lord parted the Red Sea but as they came across the Red Sea Into the Wilderness into the place that they were supposed to be going they uh that was a sanctification that was a place of of a cleaning up amen of getting themselves ready you take the glass and you clean it up amen that that's sanctification amen you Justified it by taking it out of the chicken yard you sanctify by cleaning it all up and getting every all the uh chip chicken droppings off of it you clean it make it all nice and beautiful uh pristine condition that's sanctification amen they came through when they came through the Red Sea and now when they come through the Red Sea Into the Wilderness they got into a very dangerous position because God sent some witnesses over for them to go over in into their Promised Land but there were ones that come back with bad reports with evil reports they said there's no way we can take that because there's Giants over there that make us look like grasshoppers they even brought back on these uh I forgot what they call them but the the sticks that They carried on their shoulders from person to person 68 feet apart amen they had fruit fruit as evidence from the land big grapes and all that They carried on these stage on these on these poles they had evidence look Saints they had evidence that the promis land was exactly what God said it was and told them it was theirs go get it I'll be with you praise the Lord but they got into the most dangerous comfortable position they had the Egyptians were behind the Egyptians were destroyed in the Red Sea they come out Sanctified feeling good worshiping God and thought everything was great they got so comfortable they got so eased and Zion they got so it become natural to them that they that they become it seems like they become disinterested and going ahead into the promised land that God had promised them they were happy they were content they were at a place that they thought this is a good place we're happy here everything's good God blesses us and all this is this is great I go to church and I pay my TI and I live the way you know and and and and everything is good and sat there in the most dangerous spot I imagine Judas thought the exact same thing judas's carrot s the great same thing God sent him out and he went out and saw demons cast out and miracles take place when they came back rejoicing I guarantee you judas's carrot was just yelling and scream and worshiping as loud as any of the others amen he was happy about that he was he was a part of them he was one of them amen but there was there was something in Judas that was missing that was the desire to go into that land to go into that promised land to go into the depths of the word to go into the depths of the Holy Ghost to receive the Holy Spirit he could not do it so when he got Justified like I said St John 17 17 Jesus says sanctify them Lord by your word amen and so at that point sanctification came and they became eased and comfortable they became so comfortable that even Peter the most staunchest speaker of the group lied cussed and denied Jesus Christ three times denied even knowing him three times they got that they had gotten that so far out but there was still something in Peter that stood there with him and watched him and saw what was going on Amen Judas went and sold Jesus out for 30 pieces of silver and went and killed himself amen because he couldn't go on into the furtherance of of of of the birth being born again the Holy Ghost he could not go into the upper room children of Israel they got EAS in Zion they became comfortable in the wilderness the glass is clean yeah it's beautiful but what good is a clean glass do if you don't use it it's just an ornament it's just a decoration I know my wife gets a lot of coffee cups with the scriptural sayings on them and stuff and she loves them and she puts them up on the shelf for display and stuff we never use them she never uses them amen but when you come in there and you look and you see the sayings it's encouraging amen the the the sayings on the cups sometimes I look at them sometimes I read them sometimes I don't but sometimes I read them and they're encouraging amen when you can you sit there and the word is sitting right in front of you amen so those are nice when she gets those gifts but there's still uh the the the the writing is good but what good if is a glass again we probably got glasses in our cabinet we hadn't used in years I what's the point in taking and cluttering up a cabinet if you don't even use it what good is a clean glass if you don't use it amen there's got to be a usage to the glass hence comes the Holy Ghost amen amen what's the what the Holy Ghost fills up the glass amen it puts it into use not just a beautiful glass setting there all clean yeah it was in the chicken yard yes it's nice and clean and that is a great thing that is wonderful God is a miracle working God but what good does it do if it's not full of the Holy Ghost that God can use it God didn't clean God didn't justify you out of the world and sanctify and clean your life up just for you to sit on a Pew and do nothing just for us to sit at home and do nothing just for us to not witness or talk to anybody or be a use of God in any way amen God didn't clean you up just to be a non onal log he cleaned you up to be put into use that's what the Holy Ghost is for yes the Holy Ghost puts movement in your feet it puts a a a purpose in your heart that you can walk with that you can talk with that you can live with with that you can be the person that God wants you to be because you're not just Justified and Sanctified you're filled with the Holy Ghost now it's God leading your life not you the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of God Amen God directs your steps God directs your path God shows you tells you leads you it's God that does it now I that's being born again led by the spirit of God I've had people say well should should we go down here on the corner and preach I said said if God tells you to do it you better do it amen right if God doesn't tell you to do it you might get arrested I don't know right that's assumption brother R talk about uh venturing forth without Authority sometimes he would say that people say well come here brother brandom or come here or do this or go to this place these people really need you these people are crying out for you well that's all fine and good but I don't go anywhere unless God tells me to and when God tells me to go there I go post haste because I know he's going to be with me right I don't care what demons are over there I don't care what witches warlocks I don't care what spirits that are B to battle I don't care what's going on with their government I don't care if God sends me he will take care of me yes he that's a full glass that's someone that has the Holy Ghost and when the children of Israel cross over Jordan into the Promised Land by Joshua this time not Moses amen cuz Moses was disobedient to God he smoked the rock instead of speaking to it God said you will not be the one to lead them Joshua steep forward LED them across Jordan which was their baptism which was their the the the Holy Ghost which is also you also know Jordan represents death Jordan means death death to what death to me death to you amen death to ourselves so that Christ can live in us so Christ can take over over our lives it's no more us but it's him that's death going across Jordan they went across Jordan and a lot of times we don't we talk about the Red Sea but God did the exact same thing to Jordan for them amen God can do it no matter what anybody says amen it's our own thinking it's our own reasoning it's our own Humanity that gets in the way so many times but they walked over into the promised land and what did they face they faced the the thing that God told him this big humongous City with all this this this wall that was so thick you could run three chots a breast across Race Across the top of the wall it was so big amen friends have you ever woke up have you ever got to a place in your life where you've come up to an obstacle that had so that was so insurmountable that three chariots could run across a breast and a Race Across have you ever come across a wall like that in your life not physically I'm not talking about an actual city with a wall I'm talking about in your life yes amen I think we probably all have would you come to that wall do we give up do we quit do we not take the city anyway because on the other side of that wall we'll just say this because it it's what we talk about the most physical healing because on the other side of that wall is your healing yes amen the only way to get on the other side is for the wall to be tore down amen they come up to Jericho and they got to the place that the wall where they were murmuring and complaining just like they did the Red Sea just like they did oh how many times the children of Israel just murmured and complain but now we got a new generation coming up we got a new leader and Joshua hears from God and God tells him exactly what to do around the city and go around blow the trumpet he then go around he comes up this day and he says oh I I don't think we're going to be able to get this done and God says talk to that created son Joshua looks and says son stand still gave them enough light for them to continue to do what God told him when they blew that trumpet that last time the walls fell fat right amen amen the walls didn't fall down in big hunts of concrete friend the walls fell flat yes because they marched straight across into that City they didn't have to come crawl over big Bowers and stuff with their swords and Spears and Armory and people they didn't have to climb and crawl all over that stuff no the walls fell flat and they walked right into that City yes and took it over praise God Rahab was so convinced that she told him that she said would you spare me and she she took care of the couple of the spies and uh said you put this token out if we see that token will pass over you you will not be a part of the Judgment praise the Lord amen oh Saints when God looks at that token there is no judgment there is no condemnation amen because you have the token you have the promise you have the the Holy Spirit the right amen that God's G you to that land it entitles you to every Redemptive benefit in the scripture when you've got the Holy Ghost when you've been born again when they went into that promised land and they took it over they had every right to that property didn't matter who it belonged to didn't matter who occupied it it belonged to them because why God said so amen they can have all kinds of Deeds over there they can fight left and right they can say Gaza they can say the uh uh uh the Gaza Strip and all this is this the Palestinians and the Israelis but I'm going to tell you what friend I don't care what Dean says I care what God says and God said it belongs to uh to his people to Israel amen doesn't belong to Ishmael it belongs to Israel the promised son they can fight all they want but it doesn't matter because God said so and that's all that matters and when God speaks that settles it and they are entitled to every Redemptive benefit that is a part of it yes amen you friend are entitled to every Redemptive benefit of being a born again child of God Amen don't sell God short don't sell yourself short make that Wall come down don't make it a struggle let that Wall come down flat you walk right across into that promise and know that God is going to be there with you praise the Lord cuz he's the one that takes care of it he's the one that watch over you amen it's healing you need if it's salvation you need if it's a holy ghost you need if it's uh inspiration if it's encouragement whatever you need God is there to give it yes amen don't don't don't let the devil defeat you in that yes God will take you take care of it and every and now that glass is full and God's going to use you now in that Promised Land the justification the sanctification the holy ghost that was the beginning that just got him to the place that just brought him in into that place now they've got to live there amen thank God we've made our Promised Land that's great but now you got to live there what you going to do you got a whole life to live you got generations of people that's got to live here now amen so God told Joshua and Joshua started doing what he started placing every one of them in their place from this place to this place it becomes kind of starchy and boring maybe if you will to read or to listen to but the bottom line is God had every one of them in their position in their place even to the Levites even to the the the priesthood levitical priesthood he had their position set up for them to minister to all those people all the tribes all in in uh and all perfectly placed he put them in their position amen and that's exactly what God does for us amen yeah I've been born again at the Holy Ghost I I I've reached my Promised Land but now you've got a a placing of suns to take place a a a fullness of a word when when brother Brandon brought forth the seals it opened up and exposed everything that had been hid from ages and generations that people had probed that and tried to get to and and and try to think but that fullness of that word came and the whole the entire scripture became open it it was it was there for a fullness for for the placing of of the body of Christ now it's time for you to take your place where is your place amen amen where is my place whatever it is that God has for you in your life walk in it yes amen that's the placement of the Holy Ghost that puts you in that place in that land where where you're supposed to be amen praise the Lord when God places us there then it's it's up to him to lead us and guide us in that in that way amen God leads us praise the Lord now I was going to get into this next part fol but 's just kind of got way uh let let's let's read this let's just read this one scripture and uh and we'll move on to the Lord's Supper in Ephesians chapter 1 uh wait not sorry uh Romans Romans chapter 8 not EPS Romans 8 Romans 8 I want to read a lot here but I'm just going to read a couple of verses and we'll close because um I want to get started on the Lord's Supper the communion here today amen not in a hurry but uh I know we get tired and all but Romans chapter 8 verse 22 and this is going to be several parts anyway so we'll just pick it up next time Romans 8:22 for we we know we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now amen and I will say even until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it or that is to say the Redemption of our bodies the Redemption what is the Redemption of our bodies these things that the Holy Ghost is working out to amen the Redemption of these bodies is when it culminates in a body change amen all of creation is waiting for that manifestation of the sons of God to the place of fullest adoption to the place where that adoption is complete amen and God takes us home amen everybody's in their place everybody's in their position everything is made right everything's where it's supposed to be it's in the body of Christ how it's supposed to be that's when God takes us home that is to say the Redemption of our bodies our bodies then we say are redeemed they come to the place of redemption we're already redeemed amen but we actually have a body change yes and we go on a Rapture yes and God takes us home that's the Fulfillment that's the Pinnacle of that adoption we've reached the place in Christ where Christ desired for us and God saw in his mind before the foundation of the world it reaches and then all the creation why is all creation groing because when that happens amen that is the beginning because it won't happen immediately because then tribulation sets in and all but that's the beginning to getting back to the place where all of creation was in the harmony that it was in in the Garden of Eden amen rose bushes will have no more Thorns those of you that are desert lovers and love all these stickers and thorns and all out here I'm not a fan myself but if I'm sorry but they're all going to be gone amen it's not supposed to be that way amen the the there's not going to ever be a dog chase down a cat again there's not ever going to be a cat chase down a mouse again amen there's there's there's not ever going to be a lion hunt down a gazelle anymore that that's all gone that was never in the beginning it was never in the original creation but when sin came in all of creation fell but the manifestation of the sons of God in this full Redemptive place where our bodies go into Rapture when and after the tribulation when God Burns it all off it brings nature back to the place it was supposed to be so when we come back to live here when we live here all of nature will be the way it was supposed to be Amen in Perfect Harmony perfect continuity everything perfect amen Perfection no sin thank you Lord no unbelief amen because everything will be the way it's supposed to be that's why all of creation is groaning and waiting as we are groaning and waiting for that Redemption of our bodies amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen Lord willing next week we'll get back to to this and pick up here where we left off yes and get back to that place uh to finish that thought I wanted to get to but we will so amen so pray the Lord bless you amen I'm thankful to God's mercy amen he loves us yes he does we just want to make sure Saints we don't fall short of who we are we don't fall short of the position that God gave us amen the the the placement that God I've had so many people say but but brother than you I don't know what I'm supposed to do I don't know what my position is I don't know what my placement is the only thing I can tell you I mean others can see gifts in your life or things like that and may have an idea just based on your character based on your actions based on your talents and things maybe uh what your placement might be what what God has for your life uh nobody can tell you that best thing I can tell you is find a closet somewhere amen find a closet find a quiet place find but go to your prayer spot go and talk to God about ask him say Lord I just I I want to know sometimes I've had people tell me that and I know who that person is and what their life is and I said and I'm like well brother can't you see this can't you see that and like I just thought that was just a a normal thing that people do I said no people don't do that but you do it why do you do it because God's called you to that I didn't realize that I just did it because I thought it was a good thing to do or the right thing to do or whatever why do you think that because God put it in your heart God's leading you God's showing you and people take their place and sometimes don't even realize they're actually living in their adoption and don't even know it they're living in the position God put them in the good part about that is that if they are that means that they just they've been they're being led of God they've let the Holy Spirit lead their lives and they and he's LED their lives into the place that they're actually living their adoption and even might not realize it yes amen I've I've had people like that too but God knows and if there that question Amen Let God answer it amen the best thing I can tell you is just it's the advice I would give people when they ask me about a spouse do I look look for a wife do I look for a husband I said if you go diligently looking you'll find one but it's not likely going to be the one God has for you yes just live your life yes that's all you can do live your life live your life as a Christian obedience to God and his word and let your footsteps be ordered of God and God will put you in the right place at the right time with the right person yes if that is his will yes amen amen at the right place the right time it's the same thing if you don't know you just walk just obey God just live your life for God and walk your footsteps order of God and God will put you in the place and the position what you're supposed to be what you're supposed to do amen when I first became a minister I didn't think it was the a bazillion miles from my mind that I would ever end up back in Tucson and it was a gazillion miles away that I would ever live in Florida or move to Florida I didn't want to move to Florida honestly I didn't want to move to Tucson but when God but when God says go do you go and do but you want to or not whether you like it or not um but when you know it's God I will say I have argued with God plenty of times in my life but when I know it's something that serious and I know it's him I've never argued yes amen and and truth be told my wife has never argued with me amen as much as she might not have wanted to she never argued amen that's the will of the Lord of course she would definitely not argue with coming back to Tucson that would she would have never argued about that but she's never because we are if we say we are one in this yes amen that's the best advice I can give people and tell them amen be a Christian live your life live a good humble simple Christian Life that's it it all goes back doesn't it amen praise the Lord let's get into the communion service Psalm number 16 I like to sing this just the first verse as we do amen did you turn the streaming
