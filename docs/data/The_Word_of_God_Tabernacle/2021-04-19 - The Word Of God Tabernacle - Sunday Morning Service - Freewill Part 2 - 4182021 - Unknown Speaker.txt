prayer or sorry testimony from sister matisse this morning uh the person that she had been praying about to help find a a home everybody yeah uh his name is derek he got accepted into a rooming home yesterday and he wanted to start and on top of that he wants to start growing like greens i guess plants and things to supplement his income and god had placed someone in there the house manager works in a nursery that does that sort of thing and um wants to introduce him to other nurseries to help him you know keep growing uh some plants that's that's really awesome of the lord and the way he works things so he's gonna start growing things and he has a place to live now so that is amazing she says it took him six months to find the right place with the right training built in so i praise god for that anyone else and i just want to ask people if they could keep it in their prayers to lead and guide me because when i go down there it takes so much time that i have to go in do what i've got to do and then get out of there before dark it's hard for me to drive home and um and and there just really isn't time he's he's you know because of his chemistry and stuff he's so there i just have to make time to go over there or talk to him on the phone or something to try to get other people maybe over at love divine or somebody that's over in that area i can tell you where he's at if he's on your heart to go and mentor this brother he needs fellowship he needs mentoring this is god's beloved he's given his heart to the lord he doesn't know where to go what to do where to turn to he needs mentoring brothers and it's gonna be out of your way it's gonna be probably way out of your way you know i don't know how important it is to you but if you can if god puts it on your heart i pray he does um i'll tell you where he lives and uh you know that god would just help him leading guide him and and he wants to be baptized and he wants the holy ghost and there's only one place i know where he can guarantee get the holy ghost now i had to wait 18 months after i was baptized because i just didn't get it but god said he would baptize immediately that people would be over in dawsonville georgia in that baptism and there is videos of god honoring his word and so he wants to go and i don't want to take a chance on him with the way he thinks of going to into the baptismal somewhere and then waiting 18 months or you know to get the holy ghost i want i want him to be successful so that he can start this this right way you know and um so i just please i covet your prayers yeah i'm sure well yeah definitely anyone else this morning testimony or something special um i went to go visit my sister she's home now and she wanted to for me to give a praise on her behalf she um passed all her tests that they gave her before she was released from the therapy facility and uh she was on dialysis but you know when she went to the hospital and she had that all those complications so anyway she uh is doing very well and i asked her about her kidney because she had a kidney transplant yeah before all this happened and she said that the doctor said that she does not have to do dialysis however that her new kitten amen thanks she thanks the lord and her prayers i also took a prayer cloth to her that brother bennett and sister and it gave me and i pinned it on her last week right before she left her the facility and i asked her you know if she still had she's god bless you um sing this song before hope it's a blessing i didn't know until about 60 seconds ago exactly

honoring his word good through together in his name we honored his word made the step i'm here today trusting him to be with us and i believe he has i believe he is i believe he will amen as he continues to have his will and way in this service let's just continue to give ourselves into his hands for that purpose amen praise the lord god is he sweeping through this place do not pass me by amer amen my prayer every week lord just come sweep through this place just like the day of pentecost every one of us be blessed receive feel that spirit touched healed whatever direction leadership whatever you're looking for amen that god will fulfill that purpose in your life amen remember it is an individual walk it's based on each one of your lives and each one of your hearts and your dedication to the lord and where you are with him and that's all he can use all god can use is what you give to him you give it to him he'll take it he'll use it if you withdraw that part from him or you keep it from him or you oh i can handle it i can take care but i can do it myself no you can't thank you we haven't learned that by now friend we're in a world of hurt but we know that if we just put it in his hands and trust him with it it may take longer than we want longer than we expect but if god will take care of it he will he will handle it amen he'll make it work together for our good because we love him we trust him amen praise the lord so at this moment uh brother art had texted me this morning and asked if we could uh lay hands on him i want to do it now before i i felt that to do it now instead of after the service was over uh there's kind of a faith bank i feel especially i didn't know mike was going to sing that song but after that song and fill in the faith bank and the spirit of god moving right now i believe it's a very good time to have where the ark come up and uh let's lay hands on him if you're a believing brother if you want to come and lay hands on them with us you're welcome to come we're going to pray the lord would touch him you know it takes a lot uh you don't see very often and especially message christian world people admit right that they have a problem right they admit that they have a spirit that's on them that they just can't shake on their own and they really need help they need prayer they need something from us as individuals so art come on ahead amen praise the lord and uh appreciate you your honesty and your desire and your integrity [Music] amen we're just believing that the lord's gonna heal you deliver you of this uh it takes you and your heart of what you decide and what you believe but this is the best first step that you can make that you admit it and then we come here together we hold you before the lord and believe that god's going to touch you now heavenly father father our brother art has come here lord with an open heart he's confessed to something in front of this congregation lord that he's struggling with a spirit that's on him father that he just can't seem to get control over shake on his own lord lord with this precious family setting here lord this body of believers god we're believing father today as we bind our faith together with him as believers laying our hands on him as your word says lord thanking you god for the promise of your word that if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover we believe lord that this sickness of this demonic spirit has kept that's uh kept control over our brother for so long god is going to be broke right now in the name of the lord jesus christ satan you have been exposed and you have no right here to this man of god you have no right to his home to his family to his children and we rebuke you in the name of jesus christ to take your hands off of him and lord to you be the glory honor and praise father for helping and blessing our brother art now and we commit him to you in vic in in victory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen amen praise the lord you believe that today amen i believe it i believe it's done i believe it's finished i believe art's the new man now that that that doesn't mean that that there won't be a that devil come to try to tempt yes stronger but we know that greater is he that's in us and he that's in the world yes amen greater is he that is in our greater sea that's in shariah yes raising those children in the nurture and admonition of god that there is in this world amen so victory in the name of jesus christ i want you to understand something i i hope the things that you know i hear so often that you know if god's real words is miracles i hear people say i've been going to church and just don't see things happen i hear people say that all there's going to be a quick powerful word i hear all these uh looking for all these signs and all these things friend and god keeps moving around us and i don't want us to lose a uh aspect of what god's doing yeah of of the things that god is doing in our church and in our midst and with our families and the the blessings that god's given us yes uh you know where's that book of acts friend it's happening just just don't lose that uh attraction that thought of what god's doing here you realize last week i mean i i know we still have prayer requests those things were struggle we struggling we trust god we believe god you know but there was two outstanding miracles last week that were testified in this little room yes and i don't want us to lose uh the the the perspective of that yes amen sister julie and my daughter sister tabitha and the miracles that god has performed in their lives do you know that some of you may not know this but tabitha went to a doctor that actually said she had lupus now that's just a devil that's just another fancy name for a devil yes but god has touched and healed her people want to look around and say oh you got to go overseas or something there's no there are miracles happening right now you don't know how some of you may not know how sister julie has suffered over the past i don't know how many weeks or months it's been with this thing that the lord's touched her with now it's it's just the miracles that god is doing in our homes and our families and our midst delivering and healing and blessing us and i i again i just want to make sure we understand what's going on around us yes what god is doing and the things that god is touching us with the miracles he's here [Music] don't don't uh don't think he's all he's here right now he's here today he's here in our lives you know i haven't heard anything necessarily new about the building except that they're still in the process of moving over so we can have our own place but do you realize that the the lord basically funneled us to this place and that uh outside of maybe the first or second service or something like that every time mike is always first one to get here he comes in this place is exactly like we left it hallelujah you know that when me and my wife met this man the general manager here he had this all set up as a conference room that he told us that he rents his place regularly this place gets he told us this place gets rented on a regular basis and i thought okay well you know as long as we can have that sunday morning he said no we haven't had a sunday morning in a while and at that moment they had a facility they had a thing going on next door because it was too large for this room here but do you know ever since we've been in here except for maybe one or two services every time we come in here it's exactly the way we left it i can only believe that nobody's renting this building because we're here god is keeping this place for us i don't even know if anybody even comes into this room maybe to vacuum outside of us on sunday mornings now right now god will bless the man for allowing us and cutting the price and allowing us to have the facility and all but god is taking care of us yes even though we're a little uncomfortable now and we're in an interim place and we're not where we want to be god is blessing us here god is blessing our services i don't know about you but i feel him every time i come in here i do and god is blessing us even here and keeping all the other out all the week they're not renting this place anymore so again i i want you to realize what the lord is doing let's let's don't lose perspective of that yes god is blessing us god is moving god is moving in our church and our lives our families in this bride internationally god is blessing us i believe friend that we're living on borrowed time i mean i really do i mean brother branham said uh the coming of the lord is overdue that's not 55 plus years ago but i just i believe at this moment that the mercies of god has probably never been any more manifested than they are today with this with the bride still being here and the mercies of god still being on this earth to find that last seat or whatever it is that god has before we go home whatever space of time we're in we know the rapture rapture's in process i'm ready to go home our bodies we're changing moment by moment day by day yeah but uh but god is moving god is doing something it's it's it is miraculous that's just a derivative of the word miracle miraculous what god is doing it's it's uh i i i i just feel so overwhelmed sometime at the presence of god and what god's doing amen and don't lose perspective the testimonies last week and then there's other testimonies but i know those two those those were just miracles yes yeah just absolute flat-out god-ordained miracles and uh i thank him for it you heard me get a little emotional uh over both of their testimonies last week but you don't know how i've been before the lord prayed for the two of them too and all of you but uh you know it just it really it really meant a lot to me and it means a lot to me to to see what god is doing in your families to see what god is doing in your lives and it does something to a pastor i can't it's can't explain it but it just it really it really touches my heart so i appreciate that appreciate god appreciate his goodness i love you all amen and all that you do also last week before we get into the scripture i'm gonna go to part two of the free will we started last week but um i failed to give a little more detail i had a prayer request written down for zach to write to read of my good friend brother mike holloway you all know brother mike he came and ministered for us a year or so ago he was down um ministering for someone in cottonwood and i persuaded him to come down this way before he went up that way because they flew into phoenix and he visits us on a thursday night i don't know how many of you were there uh heard it was uh it was when we were still off cortero but anyway he's the precious brother he's the one who did all the graphics for my book free of charge uh and uh he he had that heart issue that we supposed to have the surgery on they postponed the surgery and the doctors talked to him and asked about how he's doing he says i'm i'm fine he doesn't feel like there's anything wrong with him now and the doctors they're just wanting to reschedule it but his primary doctors first doctors like well i think you need to go get re-examined maybe the lord has done something maybe you don't need surgery anymore so brother mike is in the process of determining where the lord would send him for the next examination to see uh and prove the miracle of the lord that touch his heart because it was a dire situation i mean it was uh it was life and death really you start talking about the heart you know uh it's a dire situation so to let you know um i'll i'll try to keep in contact with him i'd love to have him come and minister for us sometime in the near future i had it planned on my heart maybe if the lord willing when we get in our new place to have some dedication services uh we won't be bound to this room or to the other church or to any of their regulations or time frames so we can have church whenever and however and whatever all we want so i just thought to do that maybe and see where the lord leads that but please continue remember brother mike and mike holloway i just trust the lord's touched him and healed him and he doesn't even have need surgery amen so i'm looking forward to having a wonderful testimony for you again in the near future so praise the lord god bless you let's stand if we could you say well brother you've already used up 20 minutes of the hour that we have well micah talked to the lady outside again and we don't have to give the church up the building up quite at noon so so we have an extra hour or whatever so i don't want to abuse the privilege that they give us but um but i'm thankful that we don't feel quite so stressed to look at that clock so i'm thankful that they said to us you know as long as nobody else is using it as long as it's not rented anybody else you're welcome to it so well we'll just take advantage of that amen so genesis 1 we'll begin uh there reading at that part uh person scripture again as we did last week genesis 1 verse 26 i was so inspired last week i was so just my skin could hardly hold me actually um i really preached to you more than i really taught this and i really had it on my heart to do more of a teaching of this than than a preaching but however the lord leads yes just do how we feel led to do but for uh genesis chapter one we'll begin reading verse 26 but let's bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could lord jesus we thank you so much lord for what you've done for us god lips cannot even begin to express how much we love you and appreciate you and thank you for all that you do for us god every day lord and the great miracles and things that we testify of and lord even the little things father sometimes things that you do for us god in the unseen world that we never even know about you keep us from accidents you keep us from germs or diseases you keep us and protect us so many times lord and we just thank you for it we thank you for always being with us never leaving or forsaking us and for this time in this place this facility that you've provided for us god may you bless father the remaining part of this service may your hand be upon each one lord those that may be streaming today those that are here in person god may you just bless us and keep us by your perfect will we believe god that you've come today lord to minister to our hearts and lives for father if you don't meet with us here god i know you've already here but speak to us lord if you don't speak to us then none of this is really we could just find the denny's next door and go have a nice fellowship father but you god come and speak to us once again from your precious holy word lord inspire us and strengthen us and show us in there where we need to be in you god draws closer to you let that word god come through a revelation to our hearts to make us more like you in your image become that very word lord to the revelation for this day yes and lord we thank you god for each one that has come may you bless them exceedingly we rebuke every demonic spirit that we try to hurt or hinder and infiltrate this service in any way but god knowing your presence here and feeling it god that devil doesn't have a chance and i thank you father for blessing us today thank you for healing us thank you for answering our prayers our requests our needs god we just committed to you lord and ask your blessing upon now this reading of your word father as we enter into it solemnly respectfully but believing god that you're going to speak to us in your precious holy name we pray the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse 26 god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let us let and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all of the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and you can be seated if you'd like we read the last few verses as well last week but i just felt would just stop right there and uh go enter into the next service i will tell you so make sure i don't forget about it but i appreciate your prayers uh we had the ministers meeting in phoenix last week or last week yesterday and it went uh it actually went really well i was very pleased i was i got a lot out of the brothers that spoke there not everybody spoke but uh there was about 50 brothers there uh probably 10 or 15 of them weren't really ministers maybe deacons or something like that at the church for a while or uh that kind of thing and uh many were there from phoenix there weren't that many pastors from tucson uh there was three or four of us and tried to remember but uh anyway that's irrespective of what what the meeting was about it was a real blessing i enjoyed it me and brother roger went down together we left a little early brother roger has meetings on sunday saturday nights as you know uh that he does his uh streaming so we left a little bit early so we could get back to benson uh to have his service there but it was really well i appreciate your prayers it went really good i felt a lot of unity i felt a lot of love uh fellowship so appreciate your prayers about that and and they're supposed to have it every other month uh we'll see how that goes the lord willing i plan to go to the next one uh i'm not here uh to convince anybody that my doctrine is right i'm not going to those to can try to talk them brothers into believing the way i believe or see the way i see it right um but then that's all a part of free will amen if i can i'll just take a minute you know uh everybody looks at those things a different way if you don't understand that to that point then just read the four gospels right i challenge you when you're when you have a chance just read through matthew mark luke and john consecutively three times through and see what each one of them say and see how they say it and how they describe the exact same situation from each one of them not only do each one of them have a unique perspective on it but they come from a unique background about it uh each one had their own lives and and the type of profession they were and the type of life they lived and where they came from and the kind of parents they had and that type of thing you know um i i could uh i could bring this pulpit in the middle of the room because on wheels i'd do it but and i just and you can surround it and say okay which one what what do you see every one of you would say you saw this you saw that probably no two people in this room would have the same answer right because you're looking at it a different perspective that's a part of free will god give you that as a part of your free will so that you can have that determination based on who god has made you who are you to be able to fulfill what god has called that he wants done today now for you to see it in a certain way you need to see it that way to do what god wants you to do and this person needs to see it from their perspective to be able to do it the way god wants them to do it you see all that evolves all that is exactly a part of god's uh uh god's free will in our lives because he gives us see you can't even fulfill the purpose that god's put in your life and if you didn't have free will you couldn't do what god put you here to do if you weren't on a free moral agency basis you couldn't do it because god gives you the ability to determine based on what god has revealed to you the point that god wants you to make in the play the part that god wants you to play all of that every bit of that goes into your free will now that doesn't mean the person on this side of the platform is right and the person on the left side is wrong that's where we get into problems we get into problems because someone says oh no it is absolutely this way and there's no way it could be this way now there is a a derivative from the word that is not scriptural and i'm not talking about that i'm talking about that that is pure word but that is looked at it in a different perspective and look at this god is infinite god is eternal and there's no way any one of us any group of us are ever going to be able to fully comprehend the mind of god brother branham clinton and all of the gift and the and the revelation that god afforded to brother branham not nobody can in our human pee little brains there's no way we can but what we can do is accept the way this person over here sees it and except the way this person sees it not off the word and it's got to be with the word okay but you're just looking at it from this way and this person's looking at it from this way now if this person over here doesn't say oh no you're wrong brother it's not like that it's like this and you're wrong for believing that that's where the problem comes right that's where you have contention if this person over here would say oh well brother i you know i never saw it that way well you know that that that that goes in and this person chimes in and they say oh yeah i see it like this and you and and the two of them are like wow yeah i never thought of it that way right i never looked at it with that perspective every one of them comes in together and then you can get really a truer picture of what it really is right if you only look at it at one angle you only have one angle of the picture but if you get that man's angle of the picture and this person's angle of the picture and this person's angle of the picture you could say okay well praise the lord i know exactly what this pulpit looks like now amen i know exactly from all angles from every perspective from every point of view i could without seeing it i could draw a perfect picture of this pulpit based on everyone's uh description of it it's that simple the problem comes in the disagreement and say oh no it it it's not like that i i i'm looking at it this is what i see so you're wrong no he's not wrong he's just seeing it from over there right if he could just accept and say well you know i never sought from that angle amen it would be so much better it would be so much easier it would be it would give the devil so much less room to to operate in our midst right but see to understand you god put you in that position to see it from that perspective your whole life has been that way we went into adoption i had three or four services on that about adoption and and the five-fold ministry and see why is there a five-fold ministry if there's no free will if we don't have a choice why is there even a full ministry right there wouldn't be any reason to be a five-fold ministry because you wouldn't have to have different gifts you wouldn't have to have differing ministering gifts because if there's no free free will then one one person or one gift or one that you just lay it out the way it is and that's just the way it is but there's but but each one of them has its own gift right each one of them would see it based on that gift from a different angle a different perspective and that goes back into your birth it goes back to the predestination and when it goes back that far you can realize who's in control of this it's not me it's not you it's not some other brother church or brother adam god is in charge of it amen he predestinated it yeah and if he predestinated from before the foundation of the world then your birth is no accident right who your parents were was no accident right where you were born where you grew up what atmosphere you lived in is no accident it's all predestined by god based on his what for knowledge but it's done that way you had the parents you lived in the place you went to the church you were born again you were baptized all that happened to to bring about the person you are for the fulfillment of the purpose in your life all that's free will every bit of that is because you're a free moral agent look at the scripture here and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion okay now if i have something i can give it to you and if i give it to you then you'll have it yep understand god said let them have so what's he doing he's taking something that is his possession and he's giving it to them right so they can have it that very word that very five-letter word is free will in itself because why would god give you something to have if he was just going to control you with what he's given you i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna give you my phone but you can't use it don't you touch it don't you text on it don't you call anybody but you can have it oh you're not you can't have it unless you're gonna let them use it all right i'll give you this pen but don't you get right with it what's the point in giving it to them then right what's the point letting them have it god had it and he gave it so they could have it and when they had it god knew that based on that determination of free moral agency that they would do with it what he wanted them to do with it right now he knew whether they would or wouldn't of course amen all that was predetermined again by foreknowledge in god's mind but he gave it to them because so they with their free will would use it and do what god wanted them to do with it but it was theirs to have you understand if you give something to somebody and and tell them not to do something with it you really didn't give it to them if god had given something and then made you do it a certain way well you really don't have it that's just god forcing you to do something it's just god making you do something you don't really have it but when you have it you are by your determination a free moral you can do what you want to with it right and that's what god said you have dominion so now what you need to do adam is use that for what the purpose that i called you to use it for everybody's then on that same basis every man from that point every person from that point has been on that basis nobody's been separate from that it has been given and had and now you have god didn't give it to adam and then the next that came along said no no no you can't have it no everyone if god gave it to him see remember brother aaron said if he did it for one person one way and did it a different way the next person he's not god right he had to do it to the next one the exact same way he did it to the first one yes and when he did it to adam that way he had to do it to the next one that way right and on down the line to you and every person that was born on this planet earth the same affirmation that adam had in the beginning had to be or god's not god but it was all work to be in his perfect plan this is what i'm giving you to have well if they if he wasn't if he didn't have free will why would god give it to him what's the point i make you do something god's not making you it's it's based on your free will see free will and predestination are not competing factors i'm kind of laying a little bit i'm kind of laying a little bit of the foundation from last week and still uh just speaking what the lord puts on my heart they're not competing factors right free will and predestination do not compete with each other they are companions with each other right because the predestination of god is based on his foreknowledge thus the two cannot compete the two complement each other yeah because when it gets to the place that in your life do you realize that that we kind of ended with this last week but do you realize that you can be in god's perfect will while you're living in his in living in his permissive will you can be in god's perfect will while living in his uh permissive will right yeah because we know that everything on this earth and everything that has happened by creation from the very beginning from the fall of uh of sin in the garden of eden until today has been in god's permissive will amen it was never meant to be god's perfect will for for all this to happen the way it's happened the diseases and the germs and the hospitals and the police and all everything the hospital that ambulances that was never supposed to be dying there was never supposed to be a death it was never supposed to be a child with cancer there was never supposed to be none of that was supposed to exist it's in this is satan's eden living in god's permissive will all those creations in god's purpose permit permissive will but you in the middle of that can find yourself in in god's perfect will for your life so you can live in god's perfect will while everything else in this world is a permissive act you understand see where mortal humans born in sin shaped iniquity come the world's speaking lies every one of us but by the free will that we have we can be we can become born again a part of god's plan we can enter into from the permissive will of god into god's perfect will but that's our choice that's our decision that's our free will to put us in that position we have to make that decision we have to make that determination we have to have that self-will to be in the place to where we are in god's perfect will yet while still in this permissive place that's and that's based on our the determination that we have towards god right living in his perfect will while everything else around us is going on in his permissive will right amen now if we as individuals devolve into god's permissive will for a certain time or a certain element or whatever that's based on your decision as well that's right your personal life may devolve from his perfect will into his permissive will by a choice that you made by a decision by your free will you devolve from that perfect will of god by a decision or a choice down into his permissive will and now you're living in his permissive will desiring to get back into that perfect will which if you're a child of god will come to pass because god already foresaw it god foresaw it that way if it wasn't to be foreseen or weren't going to happen that way then god would have never allowed you to be in that position to begin with it just never would have happened you never would have accepted him to begin with amen now people say they accept it when they really don't that was that but that in itself is free will that in itself is a decision that in itself is the purpose uh that that each one of us can determine in ourselves which where are we going to go what are we going to do there's people that think that god forces you to do stuff god makes you do stuff god doesn't make you do anything right it's our choice amen now that's the good shepherd a good shepherd leads a bad shepherd drives right a good shepherd leads his children and that's the good shepherd jesus christ is the good shepherd by leaving his children he doesn't drive you he takes your free will and he leads you amen he leads you in the place that that he wants you to go but because you made the decision and choice of your free will that you wanted to do that for whatever purpose hopefully it was because you love the lord jesus with all your heart that you wanted to serve him and live for him then you're being led by him but being led by god is still your free will sure people said well god made me no no god's not making i know david said he maketh me to lie uh uh in green pastures but that word in the bible is the same as we say god forcing you to do something right now making me to do something he he may in in oh i forget the scripture but it it says god made us zio made uzziah to prosper but that doesn't mean that god forced him that way it just mean that the that the circumstances by his decision process caused him to be a prosperous person god didn't force him to be but by the by the will of his of his own self and the desire to follow the truth he was he was led into prospering it was it was the it was the absolute result of what was happening you get into science and you say well if this if this happened does this happen and you can come out with this uh if there's a reaction there's an equal and opposite reaction or something like that uh there's there's the two forces that come together well if you put these two forces together let's just say uh hydrogen and oxygen if you put hydrogen and oxygen together what happens you get water h2o it's just a resulting effect of the fact of those two things coming together well god's not making that that's just a part of the process god didn't make us god doesn't make us it's just the resulting effect that that comes from our decision right god coming over here that that great faction that comes and sweeps in our decision meets that and then you got a result blessed prospering laying in green pastures by the still waters that's the resulting effect amen see now if that great faction god comes and sweeps in there and an opposing faction comes and and and opposes it then there's a different reaction that takes place and not a good one there's there's no prospering in that one there's no laying by still waters in that one amen but when that but when that equaling faction comes and meets it but see that equaling faction is your decision that equaling faction is your choice that equaling faction is your will your desire see a lot of people say they desire for this result but they don't do what it takes to get to that result right well that's their free will that's their choice they choose not to do this and they get mad when it doesn't happen the way they think it should but you didn't do what it took to get it to that place yeah that's right if you put hydrogen with something else other than oxygen you're not going to get water you say well i want water well then you got to do it the right way your choice has to be i'm going to do it this way so you can't make that choice or that decision that free will and expect it to be one way when that's not the way of the prescription that god laid out for it right won't work so you see if you want that resulting effect you've got to be willing to make that right choice that right decision to follow that right path that that free will purpose that god put there you got to be willing to go that direction you got to be willing to go that far you got to be willing to do what it takes and sometimes the price is hard sometimes what you're wanting in life what you're expecting to see is not just gotten from a two-minute prayer in a five-minute five-minute fast right right it doesn't come with the result of that there's got to there's sometimes it takes more than that yes right you understand but it's got to be that of your will to meet that so the result is the prospering yes so the result is the resulting that you want to get from it that's us friend that's not god am i that's not god so we to understand the power that god has given into our hands and the and the power of the result of our decisions is monumental is is far beyond i think what a lot of us actually believe understand and the more i delve into it it goes way far farther than i ever even imagined right the things that i was seeing and looking at their i i thought wow that that actually that actually goes right into what we're talking about that that fits right in this wouldn't happen if it weren't for free will if god didn't give you what you needed knowing what you would decide and your decision was there your choice was there to put you in that situation then the result won't be what god was intending for you for your life see i wanted uh uh god has you here for this purpose we talked about a little bit last week god's got you here for this purpose amen that adoption bringing us to that purpose that purpose really is just the predestination that prejudice that predetermined purpose that god had for you but if you're if your choice doesn't meet that it's not going to work right it's not going to uh result in in the part or the reason that god puts you here and god wants you here so understanding if if there was no free will you could not do what god's put you here and called for you to do you couldn't do it unless god just forced you to do it or god just made you like god's the great puppeteer up there you know moving us over to do something that's that's beyond what the bible teaches us that's not god god's not a puppeteer up there moving you all around and it's based on our decisions yes see and and and looking at calvinism and harmony armenianism again you know calvinism was based on the the the theory the thought that that man was saved by god's choice alone it was which which basically eliminates free will which obviously goes off to a tangent on one side now part of that is true yes god did choose us absolutely but you can't say that it's god's choice only there's got to be free will that's determined in there right because we're free mortal agents but armenianism said well it's it's it's god's it's man's free will to choose he can determine and choose what what he wants to do but if that's the only way that that you see it then that eliminates predestination that gets rid of predestination there's no pre-determining anything at that point because you take away a god out of the mix and say well let's buy my works it's it's by my way see uh you go one side from you start well you start making free will and predestination competing factors at that point you start making them opposing factors when you do that and they're not to be composing opposite uh competing factors they're c they complement each other in god's kingdom not not against each other so you got to take what calvinism said yes there is predestination yes there is god's choice but he put man on free moral agency so the man would choose yes the man's going to choose but god but man's choice isn't negating god's predestination you have election fighting against god's free will you have the grace of god fighting against works of man you have holiness fighting against legalism and and and then which way do you go and there's people that that actually i know people that are in the message that you know the way they think that it should be gone is is legalism you know you you gotta you gotta force and pound the people into living right don't you dare do this don't you dare do this have this go there live this wear this have somebody at the door with a tape measure is your heel right is your skirt right is your hair right right that's legalism the only way you're going to get into heaven is if your skirt's down to your ankles hogwash i say that knowing that we know the right way to dress right but it's hogwash to think that just because you got a dress down to your knees or down to your ankles that you're that's that's your ticket into the kingdom of heaven that's not your ticket to think that while i i got my hair you know down to my knees oh that's not gonna get you in oh i gave up gambling what about the bar you go to every other week i mean it's just one thing or the other it's legalism is not going to get you there right amen and holiness can't fight against legalism right holiness is just a standard of life that we choose to live that we desire to live under because god's word amen amen and we desire to do it because we love god and we love god so much we would not want to disappoint him in anything that said if that's in his word right then you have no competing factions now you just got complementary holiness brings a life of what others would say is legalism no no no no it's not legalism it's it's a it's a standard of holy living that i desire to live because god's word says so and that's my choice legalism is i'm going to make you do something i'm going to force you to do it this way i'm going to send you to hell if you don't that's legalism and trust me friend i've heard plenty of that preaching yes in this message i've heard plenty of that preaching i just pray that you get enough holy ghost in you that you know how to do it how to operate it now and and everything that's with it because see it's not me it's you it it's god's relationship and your relationship with him it's you're the if when the lord takes me the rapture there's nobody going to be grabbing my coattail right and i'm not going to be grabbing anybody's coattail you go on your own am i so it's up to you it's up to your determination that's why my prayer is that you have enough holy ghost to know what to do how to do it where to go not go to live a holy life amen not legalism not making you do something see and and the competing factions that calvin and armenia had there just brought more contention and confusion when you can just simply open the bible which i want to go to ephesians to start with here and see what god is is speaking god's purpose behind this the balance to it you know we preached and had that message uh where scripture means scripture anybody remember that scripture meets scripture yeah and the foundation that really i took was a calvinism in armenianism and and marriage and divorce and brother senate brother baron said they got this faction that goes and they take this and they go so far off that way and this one comes and counters that and they go so far off this way and both of them are right but both of them don't have the they both have truth but they don't have the absolute truth where's the absolute truth it's down the middle right it's down the middle that's why god sent a prophet to take those loose ends from this one from this one this one and time all together and bring them to a bride yeah and help them understand yes god has choice yes it's predestination but he also puts your own free moral agency to decide and determine your decision the the glue that holds that together is again god's foreknowledge that's the glue that holds it together see election won't fight against free will when you have a revelation of of foreknowledge they won't fight with each other if you have a revelation of foreknowledge they don't compete with one another when you understand god's foreknowledge god knew it all from the beginning amen so it could all be predetermined remember last week we talked about we'll read the scripture here in just a minute uh that i want to go to in romans but ephesians now ephesians 1 1. paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god by the will of god so what does that tell us that means that god had a will for paul back before the foundation of the world and everybody had a purpose for him he said well paul was saul he even had to change his name he was such a scoundrel he had to change his name had to had to put him on his face there by the by the pillar of the cloud that that shone down on him and put and knocked him off his horse put him on his face had to change his name he was such a bad fellow yeah but look at what god did for him because see god remember god told ananias he is a chosen vessel what made him that chosen vessel he was an apostle by jesus christ by the will of god by god's will amen now god's will doesn't negate our will you understand god's will our will his will they do they're not competing factions one does not nullify the other amen the what happens to a believer is our will melts into his will amen so that all becomes the same will yes amen amen that's why that's why paul was an apostle amen it wasn't his will to do that he was happy sitting at the feet of gamalion putting other churches out of business he was happy getting rid of christians he was happy putting stephen to death right he was content but god had a different plan yes he did amen god had a different plan he said well god struck him down i mean how could he refuse that while he struck the men that were with paul down too but they didn't see it right they didn't accept it they didn't believe it they had a choice just like he had right amen but god's predestination knew paul wood that's what made him the chosen vessel by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus that's us grace be to you and peace from god our father from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as chose us before him before the foundation of the world now notice that he bless us with spiritual blessings based on his choosing of us you see that he blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according to as he hath chosen us in him the blessings come because of the choosing of god's choice god's choosing us is what brought the blessings according as he hath so you see that according as he has is telling us that we're blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places because of the choosing according to the choosing that he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world now how would he know that because he's god amen that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will again his will does not compete against our will we just by his foreknowledge was chosen and predestined for that purpose because god knew that we would do it yes god knew that we would accept it right and that's his or his will becomes our will we want to do it because we decide because we want to do it and that's exactly god can look friend god can have angels and cherubims around him by the millions all the time holy holy holy lord god almighty he could make them force them cause them to do any part that he wanted them to but he wanted a people who would choose him and live love him and live for him because they wanted to not because he forced them to right thus we were predestined to that purpose amen that predestination put you in the place that you are that predestinate caused you to see this pulpit from this angle and you from this angle and you from this angle and me from this angle understand that predestination is what caused that to be that way yeah god deals with everybody different i've said this to you many times friend god wasn't up there before the foundation of the world deciding who he wanted to to fulfill this purpose here and just cut each one of you out as cookie cutter christians right we're not a slab of dough that god's taking the same mold and stamping each one of you out right we're all different but we're all different for a reason for a purpose what did brother green always say bear with one another's bear right bear with one another's bears what he always said and there's truth to that to understanding you're different god's called you for a different purpose and that's why you're doing you look at it from a different angle because you're different and that purpose is being fulfilled because you're different amen amen and if we could just understand that we could come together as a body of believers so much better than what we do now amen not to just dismiss one another but but trust one another enough to know that god god's dealing with you to see this a certain way right amen and then you look at it i told you many times when i was in florida i had a brother who had certain doctrinal beliefs and i didn't agree with it but i didn't dismiss him i didn't put him out i didn't even say he was wrong i just said brother i'll pray about it i'll study it i'll see what the lord shows me and i did that for months and he on and on we'd go fishing or go out to lunch or something and he said well i said brother hi you know i i'm still praying i'm still you know and it just come one time at lunch and i said i said brother you keep asking me that and not i mean he wasn't it wasn't like he was a pest it was sincere and we were discussing the bible and the lord and uh and it wasn't every day you know we're talking about months going by and finally i i just i i got to the place that the lord was showing me things that was different that was pulling me away from what he was seeing and i just had to tell him brother i'm sorry but the more i pray and the more i study the more i read the farther i get from where you are i wanted to hopefully try to see something that would bring it into perspective that we could agree together on a scripture or whatever it was doctrinal or but it just wasn't there and that's okay and i will tell you this i love that brother to this day i never told him he was wrong and then i can remember he never told me i was wrong now he finally left the church because he didn't feel like he was being fed because i wasn't i guess revelated enough so he finally left but we stayed friends and and all but he did finally leave the church but i never told him he was wrong he never told me i was wrong i just didn't see it that way and i still don't and i'm further now than i was then away from where he is so but that's just the way that is he's as far as i'm concerned he's still my brother and i still love him i do anything for him i believe he would me too that's the way it should be see that's the way it should be see because god's got that purpose there god's got that purpose here that's why again in the adoption i talked about how important it is to understand and know where you go to church and who your pastor is brother newton bennett's not the only one that i i believe that preaches this message that preaches what i i believe i preached the truth i'm i'd be a hypocrite if i stood up here and knew i was lying to you but i i don't do that i would never do that right i honestly this just came to me and i know it's going to be a strong statement i'd rather go to hell to do that right hallelujah i would then to deceive you or be a hypocrite or try to lie to you i'd rather go to hell so it's not that but god has different people for different people different pastors for different people different and and that's the way it's supposed to be and that's good that's not bad that's good amen amen i i understand and i used to be to the place hey you know we're all believers in this message why can't we just meet at the convention center there's thousands of us to just be one big huge happy group it doesn't work that way there's different ones for different reasons for different people because we're we're not cookie cutter christians and every and again to me every bit of that goes right back to a person's free will goes right back to a free moral agency our choice your decision people go to church for all kinds of frivolous reasons oh my family goes there oh my i have friends that live there oh i've been going there for 30 years i don't know where else to go well you know get god instead of religion amen that's just tradition and that's not that's just religion that's not god pray that's where god wants you to be ask what god said i'm not talking to you personally specifically i'm just saying in general you know don't just go there because you went there for 40 years don't just go there because your mom and dad went there or you go there because that's where god sent you and that's where god wants you and that's where god's gonna bless you that's what matters that's nothing else your friend when it gets down to the end of it nothing else really matters yes that's just it but it again it boils down to our decision we're predestinated predestinated to that point see amen i want to read one more scripture again it's after 12 i don't i don't want to take advantage of them but um i do want to go to another scripture romans chapter 8. we'll begin reading with verse 28. and i'll read this last scripture see what the word the lord takes from there god's predestination folding into man's choice power of transformation october 31st 1965. then adam deliberately listen what brother branham how he verbalizes this adam deliberately knowing he ought not to done it walked out with his wife and did this act knowingly deliberately well that's not free choice free will i don't know deliberately purposely knowingly knowing he ought not to walked out with his wife did the act of course we know that was just a type of jesus but all this is has god's unfolding predestined planned in it amen which finally but not but and look what brother braham says now he says which finally he would have come to it anyhow he would have come to it anyhow well that just sounds like god's just a puppeteer well you're going to go this way whether you want to or not no no no that's not it he would have come to that anyhow because that was god's predestined plan based on god's foreknowledge so even if it wasn't then it would have eventually come to that place brother brown saying because god knew that it would god knew that it would god knew that there would be people that would come on this earth that would have the choice decision that would not choose him right they would not want him the world's full of them today that would not want him or his word or his ways and they and he knew that but he knew that there would be that little group he knew that there'd be that little flock that chosen people that would choose him and want him above any and all else and they would be willing to live any kind of life and do any kind of way that he led them into because they wanted to amen that's powerful to me friend which finally he would have come to it anyhow he would have come to it anyhow but that's just because of god's poor knowledge but see people can take that and say well see god's gonna force you to do it anyway whether you want to or not no that that's just complementary to the scripture but god knew he would see but see it had to be that way the wisdom of god caused this this thing that displaces attribute to be a savior father healer you've heard me preach on that he says he just let them out there on free moral agency to let them act he couldn't make them do it and still be a just god but he could put them on equal with him and free moral agency and let them do it themselves and he knew they would do it right and so then you see when adam lived with she brought forth twins one of them was of satan one of them was of adam which was of god cain and abel each one choice decision if there was no choice in decision then why was one boy one way and one the other romans tells us that god loved jacob and he hated esau before every boy was born does that make him unjust does that mean there's no predestination that mean a man doesn't have a free will or a choice to decide this means god do yes amen is this all it means it just means god knew romans 8 28 time's getting away so let me get here and he and we know we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he all he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified so you see here as we were talking before there's a process to this that we unfold is on our human brains to try to comprehend or god revealed to us there's a process of it not all of this are the same but they all work together okay see the four knowledge the predestination the calling the justifying the glorifying they're all different parts but they all work together they all work together to bring together the person that you are today amen and all of this brings us into the place that that we desire to be this to fulfill this scripture i want to be one to fulfill this scripture i believe you want to be one fulfill that scripture because we choose to and want to be you can read that same scripture millions people in the world today and they wouldn't have anything to do with it they call it fiction or whatever they might say all wouldn't want to do that or i wouldn't want to live that way or whatever their decision or choice but they choose not to you chose to do it because you want to and your want to comes from a desire for god because you love him amen amen because you love him those ye justify he glorifies what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us yes he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him so freely give us all things who who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justified it right who is that to condemn is it christ that died yet rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god and make it uh also make an intercession for us paul is getting very demonstrative in this scripture and with those who may be listening or in his writing and telling the roman church who who can do this who can combat this who can come against who can say no now people can but you see the result right people can choose oh i don't want to do that what then you suffer the consequences right you suffer the results as you're a little child we become we're very dependent on our parents and that's what god i think god said unless you become his little child well he wants us dependent on him and trusting in him she can't do it in herself even though we have our own choice we still trust and believe in him we still need him and need his help our choices don't put us in that place hydrogen doesn't make water it needs the oxygen at the same time to make it water you say well then people say well then i don't need god i have my own choice i can make my own way i can do my own things yeah you can but you won't make water you won't reach heaven amen you won't get salvation you won't have the holy ghost you won't live a victorious life amen well i can do this but you need god to come and bring that complimentary factor in there that's the only way that water could come and the ostrich yes amen but he wants it by our free will decision that god wants us to bring who can lay anything to the charge of god's elections it's god that decides you know jesus christ had free free free moral agents as a kin folk jesus was a free moral agent amen amen he said well now wait a minute brother newton he was here because he was supposed to die for my salvation yeah he did that but you know what else he said he said i lay my life down i pick my life back up again yes jesus said i could call 12 legions of angels right but he chose chose decided not to do it right he said nobody takes my life from me i lay my life down that was his choice that was his decision wasn't an easy one too knowing what he had to go through you think about the garden of gethsemane he's sitting there and his sweat became as drops of blood can you imagine sweating drops that big or whatever drops of blood are that was pretty big amen in agony knowing what he was facing but he chose to do it he chose to do it and said i could have i could have called 12 legions of angels and they would rescue me right amen but he chose not to because he wanted his decision to be for you for your good for your betterment for our salvation that's why he chose what he chose amen thank you jesus yes amen praise the lord let's stand if we could i know you're probably thinking i want brother newton how much further can you go with this but i have a whole at least another point or two i want to make in this amen because people then start thinking you know god made a certain person do a certain thing because of something that he did with them or to them but understand even if god does that it doesn't change their choice it doesn't or should i say their ability to choose amen their ability to choose yeah see circumstances may work themselves around and be something that's discomplementary but you still have a choice you still have a decision you know somebody somebody could do something bad to you and and it would harden your heart or make you feel in a derogatory way towards that person but you still have a choice as to what you're going to do about it or not do about amen are you going to destroy them as well are you going to slander them as well amen they're still choice you say but but they did this and it caused my heart to be this way towards them it's their fault no it's not that's right you still have a choice you still have that choice amen amen lord willing maybe next week 482 listening this to the lord today before we go i'm learning to lean amen i trust and believe no matter how long or how far we go in this how close we get to god we're still learning amen amen as humans as mortals we're still learning god help us [Music] and i [Music] yes i'm learning to lead i'm learning to leave [Music] i'm finding more power than i ever dream [Music] on jesus i found peace [Music] that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm finding more power than i ever [Music] amen just lean on him friends yes amen he'll never do you wrong praise the lord ask him pray god what would you have me do yes what would be your will for me lord amen and my decision will be to do that amen so oh i don't i don't know what he's going to say though uh well then you're not a willing heart it's that simple i don't want to go there lord how willing are you to serve him then how close do you want to be to him sometimes it's not easy sometimes it cuts deep sometimes it rubs against the grain but god will bless it amen god will bless it praise the lord i'm so thankful i never imagined i when the lord told me so many over 20 years ago to come back to tucson and help brother green i had would have had no idea that this would have ever come to what it is today here but i'm so thankful because god has blessed us so richly amen oh my friend i just sometimes you lose you lose the words to say you know thank you just isn't good enough anymore praise you is just it just doesn't do it lord give us another language to praise you with amen amen praise the lord another tongue something amen god bless you appreciate each other today amen remember in prayer again i said i had my hair cut friday went with brother john he had talked to the other realtor uh nothing really new to report except they're still in the process of trying to get over to their other facility so that's the main thing that's that's mainly what i'm looking for unless the lord put something else uh some other place that comes up that the lord wants us and that's fine too but uh you know unless unless i hear uh the other place isn't gonna work out they're gonna stay where they're at that would be an issue but uh they're still in the process and they're still working and so we'll just get to that place and as the lord leads and this is whatever his timing is we'll do what he asks us to do man remember brother roger sister monica um brother sister monica brother roger's wife's going to be leaving a week from thursday to go to south africa for six weeks so please remember to be the first time she's seen her family since this pandemic mess started they had just came back last time they went they were going to church with us at that time in february a year ago so it's been over a year and so she hasn't been back she's got some passport green card stuff to work out when she gets back there and all and visit her family her dad is supposed to have an operation as it turns out it wasn't planned this way but as she found out the other day as it turns out when she's there right after she gets there dad's supposed to have an operation and i apologize i can't remember what before but uh he's supposed to have an operation so but remember her in prayer remember him in prayer she'll probably just fine he's the one that's going to be a wreck six weeks without his wife and all that she does for him and us and the business and scheduling and stuff but anyway just remember her in prayer or them if you would the lord would just bless him brother john went down to visit with them this morning that's why he's not here so just remember that in prayer remember the prayer requests everything before the lord and trust him the moving of his spirit and each one of us amen praise the lord god bless you love you appreciate you thank you for coming today pray something was said to bless you uh unless something changes lord willing we'll be here again next week so amen so god bless you michael would you dismiss us some prayers do lord jesus we come to you once again at the close of the service lord thank you for this beautiful day again you've given us some time and fellowship around music song and then around the world and learning from you about you and praising your name lord jesus yes may you be with us as we go our separate ways because you say surely it's been good to be in the house of the lord may our light shine brighter each and every day in the world around us that is one last person lord that you have that maybe it would be our purpose to bring them in so that we can go home and lord as we the bride make ourselves ready lord that we would do so as you would have us to do so we could go yes when you would call us okay thank you once again keep us all safe until the next appointed time we ask everything in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen excuse me but one other thing i meant to mention uh our ryan bravos and uh tap to zach had a desire to have a little evening of music together singing music and not sure exactly how that's going to evolve but just pray for him if you would i'm very thankful people have something on their heart to do something for the lord or get together or you know i mean people get together and have drinking parties and gambling parties bad parties uh but they want to get these young people want to get together and sing about the lord and worship the lord and that's just awesome i remember when we first moved to tucson at the tabernacle we were going different houses on friday nights having music and playing and having little snacks and stuff went for different houses and that's it was nice i enjoyed it fellowship and uh the ortiz would have it and then brother dave fritz would have it and then henry's had it and anyway so just pray for them if you would uh god would just lead them guide them and be according to his will and bless it amen so god bless you you're dismissed sister she of course
