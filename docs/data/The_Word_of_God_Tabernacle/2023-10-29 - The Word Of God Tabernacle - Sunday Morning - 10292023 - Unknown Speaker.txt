up the hand unspoken request Lord knows all our hearts today amen I'm not sure of her sister is always miss her amen and of course the Pats are dealing with what they're dealing with amen so God is mindful let's stand to our feet if we could we'll just take these needs of the Lord and pray ask for the den if you would do that Lord Jesus we come before you yes Lord by faith knowing that you hear and answer our prayers amen yes Lord search our hearts this is the late hour we see the scriptures of we see the Gentile dispensation is about to close and Lord let us be right with you of a word bride that you're com Jes let us Lord with that word bride father and we know that this is the greatest age of deception religious Spirits father trying to get a hold even of the people that identified with this message yes God lord they have a hard time just obeying your word they bring forth every excuse It's like your Prophet said it's not the big things we do for God it's the little things we leave undone yes Lord and father humble our hearts God Jes makes us small father you said in your word he that humbl himself shall be exalted amen you resisted the proud but give Grace unto the humble thank you Lord lord it's your life in us that gives us the power to be Overcomers it's us being yielded to you wanting to be out of the way dying daily dying all day to ourselves recognizing that our own selves is our greatest enemy and Lord we can do nothing in ourselves we can produce something so religious and so gratifying maybe to the world but you know our heart better than what we know of ourselves Lord speak to our hearts you are given us more time to be ready to repent and be right with you you're coming for a bride that's been sealed with your Holy Spirit father there's no excuse for any of us to compromise with your word oh Lord I I saw several times in the message that your prophet preached he several people came before him for prayer and he discerned their Spirit he says Jesus you're not a hitchhiker I can tell you have a genuine Spirit yes and father a hitchhiker he explained is going from post to post there's always something for every little uh inspiration that they can find unsettling running from post to post not having a place of worship where they can stand and back up the the work of God and and stick with the pastor oh Lord these religious spirits will get us into the regions of the lost if we don't repent speak to our hearts open up our hearts our understanding to where we stand with you may our reflection be you father Christ in us our hope of glory and Lord there are request there are people that are sick my in-laws my Leah's mom is her stepdad Lord they need a touch from you and Lord if you don't touch them it might be a time that they you'll take him home and Lord we have talked to him above all that everyone that needs a touch may your healing virtue Waters Flow we believe that you will heal and meet our heart's desire according to your riches and Glory father everyone every request that was spoken that lord it's not something that you will do or can do you've done already and we claim it we stand on your word we stand on your promises we claim complet and total healing and deliverance and above all including my in-laws if those that are sick in body if they're sick in their soul they haven't accepted you as Lord and Savior may that be the most preing issue in their lives may you bring them to the place of repentance for the hours late you're coming is knocking at the door and Lord may we have a love and burden for the L yes Jesus may we have a love for one another may we put ourselves last put you first and other second then father bless each and everyone who made an effort to be here may our hearts burn within us as you meet with us along the way this morning God Amen in your name we pray name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord God bless you you can be seated amen I want to give a quick testimony uh again I always forget to ask for prayers but you know I'm flying out this afternoon and I know you pray for me and I trust and know you will again I appreciate it so but I want to give a testimony and thank the Lord Jesus for moving this place out I don't mind saying of course y'all have heard me Proclaim it here publicly uh but every every time I come in here and pray I've ever every time I lay my hands against that wall and I command them to leave and they're gone amen praise the Lord did the same thing for the tattoo place amen so thank God he answers prayer amen he is a he is a god of Miracles and it may may not have looked right but I I worked in that place I've done electric for him and put lights up and stuff and I wanted to tell that man so badly you're not going to be here that long so don't bother but I didn't do it I refrained uh don't want to create any friction or anything but uh we all knew it wasn't going to be there long amen so praise the Lord uh again it's another one of those things in today's world I have never and I maybe I'm just ignorant but I've never heard of a tattoo shop going out people get tattoos all the time everywhere all over I've never heard of a smoke shop going out I mean all the things that in this world today and the smoking and the paraphernalia and the ecigarettes and the legalizing of marijuana and all that all that paraphernalia he sold all that stuff but God is greater amen amen so praise the Lord Jesus I'm happy about that amen so as a result uh I'm going to by hopefully maybe in the next month or so I'm going to ask Craig maybe if we can have a meal over there just like we did there that one time so we got a little we got some room over here next door so we'll see I'll talk to him about it he's kind of want me to do him a favor now with our nonprofit apparently there's U all those uh containers that they moved off the border that cost us millions of do taxpayer dollars and the government uh wanted us to move them whoever I don't know I I get lost in all that's just anyway so now they're having to sell all those 10 20,000 containers uh and with a nonprofit you can buy them without going to auction you can just buy them straight out they're like $2,000 a piece anybody wants one let me know if you want one on your property or something you need to have for storing stuff or something it's just like those regular containers that you get that they ship stuff in uh we put all our stuff in them on our job sites we call them aonics that we but they're very secure but anyway they're selling them for like 2,000 a piece uh to nonprofits and so Craig wants to buy some I think his son wants to buy some I think his son is looking at buying a couple of them and turning it into a house uh which a lot of people do there's a whole place down here off Congress there's a whole uh shops and everything they're all made of those conx ever one of have you been there huh the Box yeah I've walked by them they have shops and stores and all they're all made out of those things so they're selling them so uh hopefully this will put uh us on his good side so amen when I ask for next door maybe we'll be all right with that so amen so just want to give God the glory and praise for that amen praise the Lord Jesus one more we want to sing amen before we change the order of the service song number 579 amen just any day now praise the Lord just any day now amen praise the Lord just got the chorus in the book if you're home but amen hopefully maybe you can see the words on the screen just any day now praise the Lord I believe that thank you Jesus just any day the Lord is coming he'll be ruring for you and me for I've been watching and I've been waiting just any day now his face I'll see each time I stop and take the time to look around me I see the signs of his appearing everywh the things he said would come to pass are now before us and I feel the strange excitement in the air just any day now our Lord is coming he'll be turnning for you and me oh I've been watching and I've been waiting just in day now his face I'll see I like this verse now oh there's this longing in my heart for his appearing I'll gladly Leave Behind these trials here below for this journey has been long and I'm so wey but Lord somehow I feel I'm so much closer Home oh just day now our Lord is coming he be returning for you and me hallelujah oh I've been watching and I've been waiting just any day now let's that last verse again oh there's this longing in my heart for his appearing I'll gladly leave Behind these trials here below for this journey has been long and I'm so wey but Lord somehow I feel I'm so much closer Home oh just day now our Lord is coming he'll beur for you and me oh I've been watching and I've been waiting just any day now his face I'll [Music] see amen hallelujah just any day now Saints praise the the Lord and I believe as we all believe that it is right at hand hallelujah amen thank you Jesus praise the Lord amen we want to go ahead and change the off the service now uh I meant to also make a announcement that um U that we had talked to had been had had had talk to Craig about the some of the smoking and stuff that goes around and the marijuana smell and stuff but they put out uh this memo I sent you a text of it uh a memo about the no smoking policy uh the only place that it is allowed to smoke and I know we don't but I'm just saying uh for future reference or if you see any anything let me know the only smoking they're supposed to be on this property is way back over here in this corner uh they have to supposed to go around the side of the building and down there's a there's a place right down there there's a metal container down there there's not supposed to be any smoking on the property in the buildings in the bathrooms uh there's anything done it's supposed to be in that back corner and whatever they smoke is supposed to be uh the residual whatever is supposed to be thrown in that metal container so um I say that so that if you notice anything different uh continuing last week was kind of a was uh sort of a an apex to it I guess a final straw if you will because I guess we different ones have smelted on and off uh in the bathroom and stuff but somebody was out with front over here U and it was so bad art and tried didn't want to take their kids out to bring them in church right away because of that and so anyway uh that that is the official stance every every tenant got one one of these so if you see anything at all let me know uh if you can I verify who maybe it's coming from what shop or what business I'll make sure and let Craig know because it is not supposed to be that way so just let everyone know amen so let's stand to our feet if we could now we're going to turn in our Bibles to Matthew chap 11 going to continue where we left off a couple of weeks ago Amen on the simple God and you'll pardon me for a minute I forgot my phone so the phone I record the messages on so Matthew 11:25 it's not where it normally is I don't know what I did with it amen but it's being recorded in him so praise the Lord Matthew 11 verse 25 amen before we read the word we just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus father we're so very thankful again of another beautiful day that you give us thank you Lord for the health strength and life in our bodies thank you for the desire in our hearts Lord to come forth to be in the house of God today and Lord just learn of you and expect you to meet with us expect you to speak to us expecting you to do the exceeding and abundantly Lo Lord above all that we could ever ask or think we thank you Lord today for those that have come for those who may be watching Lord for all that you've done for us through this week Lord we are truly a blessed people God I want to thank you again father for moving this place out next for honoring our word Lord as you promis that you would do God lord it means so much that we stand to our feet Lord and declare something and see you do it Lord it just means something to us father to know that you're mindful of us that you love us that Lord this is your house God you are you are not a guest Lord you are the permanent prominent resident Lord and we are here God to honor you we thank you Father for uh all the that you've done for us and given to us and Lord we just commit the remaining part of this service in your hands father may you just speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear and strengthen and help each one of us Lord for what you would the purpose that you would have this to be done God we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you for it Lord we commit ourselves to you now ask these blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Matthew 11: 25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee uh oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes praise the Lord you can be seated if You' like uh keep your Bibles there I got a few scriptures I want to go through that I want to read to begin off with amen but uh uh the first one's going to be in Isaiah Isaiah chapter 1 Isaiah chapter 1 want to speak today and continue on the thought that we've had uh this will be God in Simplicity part five uh God in Simplicity part five I want to speak on the foolishness amen talk about God being simple so simple it looks foolish to the world Amen and it's amazing how many things that especially in the New Testament it talks about the foolishness that man thinks is foolish but God uh uh lives in amen and dwells in and how he operates and acts and does looks foolish to the people of the world Amen so God and simplicity part five uh will speak on the topic of the subtopic of foolishness now Isaiah chapter 1 I want to read two verses of scripture uh 19 and 20 Isaiah 1 19 and 20 amen if ye be with willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord ha spoken it amen you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it now let's go over to Revelation I got a couple places in Revelation I want to read beginning with verse uh chapter 19 Revelation 19 amen Revelation 19:15 give you a minute to find it there Revelation 1915 amen Revelation 19:15 says and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treaded the wine press the fierceness the wrath of almighty God out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword amen over Revelation one now Revelation one I got one verse of scripture I want to read there Revelation 116 amen Revelation 116 and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two EDG sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength I think we kind of get in the pattern here through throughout the scripture of out of God's mouth cometh sword two-edged sword because it's a two-edged sword for cutting coming and going amen no wasted motion with God it's a two-edged sword coming and going out of God's mouth goeth this two-edged sword now to pick up our subject now I want to go to First Corinthians uh chapter 1 amen 1 Corinthians chapter 1 I want to take this scripture to pick up our subject and we will as we've read these other scriptures they were just for the laying down of the foundation that we will obviously be speaking on and uh getting to through the scripture First Corinthians hopefully this will kind of tie it together there's there's other scripture uh that we did not read second Thessalonians it talks about the sword that goes out and destroys them is the sword of God it's the same the same thing that gives light to us is Darkness to the world to the unbeliever to those that will not believe or the foolish as the Bible says amen and that's the word of God Amen what comes out of God's mouth is the word of God praise the lord it's just uh spoken of of course through the scripture as the sword that comes forth the sword that devours amen now look uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 we're going to begin reading with verse 17 1 Corinthians 1:17 for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel amen preach the gospel the gospel is what the good news the good news of what the word of God yes amen God sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the cross the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness foolishness which is our subtitle today to them that perish the preaching of the Cross is foolishness the preaching of the word is foolishness that's that seems outstanding considering that the christiandom world most go by the word they they say anyway they Proclaim that this word is what they live by it's what they go by what they preach is the word of God but the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God so you notice again the very thing that gives life to those that believe is the very thing that brings death to those that do not right amen those that do not believe they consider it foolishness to the world we are foolish we are we we the way we act the way we live is foolishness to the world they don't understand a lot of times why we do the things that we do why we act the way we do why we don't do certain things why we don't live certain ways why we don't say certain things why we don't eat or drink certain things amen they call that foolishness I think I told you one time uh the the the the guy that was the Cragin on our job that's a good friend and all now he he told me one time he said I never met a preacher that or a minister that didn't drink right that's what we have now that's what he told me now how many he's ever met in his life I don't know he didn't divulge the number but he said I never I never met a preacher didn't drink amen so to to to them it's foolishness Amen to us it's righteousness to us it's Godly to us it's a way of life to us it's what we do because we want to live a life according to God's word and in pleasing to him and to us it becomes a desire it becomes a desire to those that are filled with the spirit to want to live that way to want to be like that and the thing that they're called Holy Roller foolish uh what nuts whatever they may call us it it it it becomes to us as a badge of honor honestly does to me anyway I consider it a privilege to to be talked about to be made fun of now he wasn't saying that to make fun of me I I think he actually was saying it to make fun of them the ones that the ministers that drink I think he's he was actually telling me that because it it was kind of like building me up to the place that uh you live a life I've never seen any other preacher live before right that was kind of what I got got out of it but it's a badge of honor that we take that that we would be called that but to the world it's foolishness but to us it's righteousness to us it's life to us it's everything amen and we hold it as such because it's in our heart to be so Amen to the world to them that perish it's foolishness but us but unto us which are saved it is the power of God the very same vehicle amen the very same vehic vehicle that saves us destroys those that don't believe those that refuse to believe those that cannot believe those that perish amen 19th verse now for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise again if there's any more of scripture of God living and revealing himself in Simplicity God being a simple god making himself simple we'll say to us amen this is it I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will'll bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of the world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the of this world absolutely yes others look on it and think it's something outstanding others look on it and think that's such a wonderful thing I and I'll put it like this uh uh brother bandam talked about television and he said television could have been one of the greatest inventions man has ever known right but it became a curse I'll say the same thing to these cell phones to the internet to social social media all those things those things all be could be absolutely wonderful great things but people have absolutely ruined them serpent seed has taken the inventions of those things that could really be a help and a blessing and brought them to be a curse yes you look at it today and all that has become a curse amen I I've gone uh places like when I went to uh I I usually often always carry my Bible with me uh I go to church and all but um uh when I went to Brother Rogers to his service there I didn't have my Bible with me so I used my phone it was a blessing I have my phone to be able to follow in the scriptures amen I I feel kind of funny having my phone out in the middle of church but I trust he knew what I was doing I was not uh looking up the news I was following along in scripture see it's a blessing that way it's something that can be good to us a lot of times nowadays if I listen to the message I'll listen to it on my phone yeah yeah amen most of the time sometimes on my tablet but usually on my phone I listen to the message it's it becomes a great blessing that way but how much other things of Filth and garbage and and betrayal and I mean it just it's just a huge whole world of nothing but of garbage and filth that's just destroying people's lives could be a blessing is not God takes the wisdom of the world not godly wisdom but the wisdom of the world and made it foolish to us we look at it and say how foolish that was why would somebody do that others look at it and think oh that's a great thing it's like uh uh I've seen I've gone in h stores or restaurants and uh uh behind the counter or or a waiter waitress that have you know tattoos all over them and and I've heard people come and say oh that's a neat tattoo or tat or whatever wow what does that mean what what's that of and they're explaining it and they're going all this I'm thinking I'm looking at that thing how horrible ugly that is I don't care how perfect a a design or or Artistry that just looks absolutely hideous to me I told my wife the other day I said for brother brandham uh because I guess I don't see it as much anymore for brother brandham it was a woman smoking a cigarette you remember brother Brown talked about seeing a woman smoking a cigarette was the most degradable thing thing You' never seen well it's the tattoos to me I see a especially a woman I see woman with tattoos on them like that it just it just I just grips my I don't know how to say it just tears me up I know they don't know better and and I know if God got it got a hold of their heart that change and you know and all that but it just it's just they look at it and think oh that's beautiful that's Artistry that's that's in membrance of my husband or my parents or whatever and it's a memorial or something I think it's like putting a bumper sticker on a Rolls-Royce that's that's my opinion of it but and then but the world looks and oh that's so beautiful it looked hideous to me Amen to those that believe now that is just nothing more than an example of what the scripture is telling us God where is the wise where is the Scribe thep Of The World God had made the foolish had made foolish the wisdom of the world Amen the wisdom of the world looks foolish to us for after that in the wisdom of God 21st verse now for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe praise the Lord through the foolishness of preaching through the foolishness of what the sword that cometh out of his mouth amen the word that cometh out of his mouth what is it that's any different Saints if that exact same word comes out of your mouth today to the world it's foolishness but to them to believe it is salvation Amen to to preach the gospel and whatever now I know is talking about an audible Ministry I know it's talk about a uh uh Paul preaching and those that are ministers that are God Called to preach the word to stand behind a pull pit or whatever it is but Saints I want to tell you today it is as much your life as it is anybody that stands behind this P pit your life that ministers to the world is is valuable because you are living written Epistles read of all men right that the world sees the sword that comes out of God's mouth is the word that you live and your living and your breathing and your speaking it's the word of God the literal sword if you will that comes out of God's mouth that preaches to the rest of the world it's God ministering it's you God ministering through you the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe what we're doing this morning to a lot of the world is considered foolishness why would you come and do this why would you come and give your time why would you broadcast this why would you spend your time why would you spend your efforts and all that you do to to keep this church going to make this a place where people can come and get out of the world it's foolishness to the world world yes preaching the gospel oh he hasn't said anything to me oh that's just a a a something to try to get you to to to be scared they're just trying to control you by fear no just trying to preach the gospel amen amen just trying to preach the word and if it's in this word it's the word of God that's coming out of mouth the the mouth of God now what did Isaiah say he said to those that would believe and obey they shall be blessed by this sword by this word those that disbelieve and disobey will be destroyed or consumed by this sword amen so you believe obey praise the Lord it is life to you the preaching of the Gospel is life it saves those that will believe 22nd verse for the Jews require a sign the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ CHR crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness foolishness the Simplicity of Christ has always looked foolish to people it looked foolish when he was here the Simplicity of Christ and his message has always look like foolishness to man man always has looked upon that to think that that was uh that how foolish that is but a true man of God a true minister of God will preach the word every every time not his own ideas not something from some Seminary he'll preach the word of God and the true pure unadulterated word of God is what is what he'll say only what he'll say 24th verse but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God to those who are what called Praise the Lord those that are called because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men foolishness of God is wiser amen the weakness of God is stronger than man for ye see your calling Brethren how that not many wise uh wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen praise the Lord Jesus amen amen it doesn't get any more so than me so thank God for that God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty I was talking to my crew the other day I forgot how it came up but they were talking about being baptized and and one of them said they had been baptized of course in the Catholic church when they were a little kid and then they're supposed to be confirmed I didn't even know what all that was but I guess when you get 18 or something you got to be confirm then I I don't know which is water what makes a difference but they sprinkle you when you're a baby so that saves you in case you die as a baby uh and I got to talk to him and I said well I said do you really think God is so mean now I'm probably paraphrasing us thing said exactly like this I said you think God is so mean that he would send a little child that doesn't know right from wrong good or bad to hell if they die before they understand these things and none of them knew what to say hallelujah amen something is so simple you you would think that it would be grasp by the most nominal Christian to think why would God judge a child who's not been sprinkled judge a child to hell if they die before that point in their life he is such a mean and wrathful vengeful God he would send a child like that to burn in hell and they didn't even know right for wrong yeah I it seems simple to me but see when you give that to people they don't understand that well well we do it just in case just in case what I I I that where where we started our church they baptize babies I talked to them about it so why do y'all do that they had a little PL pamphlet that explained it I read kind of part of the pamphlet it's like well it's better to be safe and sorry I said what kind of faith is there in that right right I I I I'd rather not take the chance chance of what disbelieving God's word it just didn't make any sense see they grasp at things they know not of but when you bring them a simple gospel they they they don't grasp the understanding so well that makes sense but but I'd rather be safe and sorry yeah it's just it's just a sad state that people got to but that's the wisdom of the world versus the foolishness of God to think how how simple it is that if a child dies before getting to that age all babies go to heaven that's pretty simple am God is not going to judge a child and they might not be predestinated they might not be uh a bride right but they God's not going to send them to hell right they'll they'll be granted life they may be bride maybe not they be be on the outside workers outside the city I don't know that's up to God to sort out but they don't go to hell right I mean it was something that simple that that would that would confound their their only foundation of Christianity really is Catholicism uh that's all they knew and and that's that's what they go by and then confirm when you're 18 I anyway it it was just it was I I cut the discussion a little short but they did just didn't know what to say you get to the place where you you bring a simp of God's word and it confounds people because they hadn't been taught that they have never heard that but when they listen to it it makes sense if they haven't been overly clouded with all of the Dogma that comes from a church or an organization or a preacher they haven't been clouded with all that they can look at it and say that that is simple that makes sense to me it's like we were talking last week and I implored you let let's don't take something that we see like that and say okay this is absolutely th that you know uh I've been through that in 30 years of Ministry for people had come forth and they said oh c th this is it this is that this is that one you know from the Bill Clinton and and Y2K and uh the red heers and the stars and all the things I've heard so much of it friend and people say well this is it this has got to be it to the point that some people just have actually said on this exact date in complete contrast to the scripture right this exact day this is the day that the that the Rapture is going to take place doesn't happen right yeah there's no repentance there's no I'm sorry there's no I was wrong it's just move on to the next day whatever that is right and it's just a sad thing Saints my thing is just the Simplicity of God let God unfold it the way he is in his mind he's got this picture all perfect laid out it's unfolding the way he wants it to just let him do it the way he wants to do it and just be a good humble simple Christian live a good humble simple life live a righteous Godly life before the Lord and before your a fellow man and let God sort all the rest out god'll bring it to pass now I know Israel's are time pieace and we talked about that last week we know that we can look and feel the pull that's coming in our hearts that we can't be much longer amen but we don't know for sure this is that Hillary Clinton and and now Camala Harris and whatever it is I don't know maybe it may be I don't know uh we we make again I hate to get back on this but people make it a thing that that they that they this has got to be this woman it's got to be the president god brother Brandon never said that right right they they they start they get so consumed with this that they start adding details onto the actual uh message onto the actual prophecy or onto the actual exhortation brother Bram was giving and they start adding things brother Bram never said this woman was going to be present he just said a powerful woman was going to rise up in a powerful position he even said it could be the Catholic church right so we make things out of something that's not there amen and we run off on a tangent on and you end out on a limb somewhere and God's moving on Amen praise the Lord let let me read this again 27th verse but God ha chosen God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty in of course not in in the world Mighty in the world and base things of the world and things that are despised ha God chosen yay and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his in in his presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen in the Lord It's foolishness to man but we believe it we believe it we know it's the truth yes unfortunately it seems like that in general not I don't throw everybody into this pot but in general it seems like most people are drawn to a personality instead of to the word they're drawn to a great oror someone who looks good or something like that instead of the word of God in general and unfortunately that's not where God is now a person I'm not saying a person uh can't preach the word and have a good personality I'm not saying somebody can't preach the pure word and be a good orator amen but you don't draw to a personality you draw to the word amen I don't I I believe I trust and I pray and I believe my family's not here because I'm the pastor right I believe they're here because because they believe that I preach the word and this is where God has sent them amen not because I actually had brother Potter one time of Reuben he come and he admonished me he said I appreciate your I believe it was him he said I appreciate your stand uh and letting your dog cuz my cuz when Tabitha was going to church after I started the church over here on Coro she kept going to Brother Martin stro right and I told her you go where God tells you to go I didn't make her stop and leave I didn't make her feel ashamed or something that she she needed to come over here because I'm her daddy no she goes where she feels led to go she goes where God sent here she goes where she feels that the Lord's feeding her right amen and I and I trust and believe that should be the same way with everybody not a personality not cause they're my family not because of this I've heard a lot of that happen Saints but you go where God tells you to go and God will bless you amen God will feeds you with the word not because of a great personality or great oror or because I'm a little more energized because I'm a little more happy or because I'm a little more uh vocal and and and and and physical with it all no because the word's being preached the bottom line is youve take away all the other stuff that's the only thing that matters amen I know sometimes uh my voice gets a little exuberant I don't intend it to be that way I really don't it just something that gets in my heart and when it comes out that's just the way it comes out uh my wife tells me sometimes you got you're you're too loud sometimes I say I can't help it I'm sorry you get up there and preach and see how you feel let the Holy Spirit and anointing get you and see what happens to you right amen when it comes that way Saints sometimes you just can't sit still sometimes you got to get up sometimes you got to throw your hand sometimes you got to get loud sometimes you speak in Tong sometimes you clap amen but it's the power of God it's not us doing it it's God doing it and when you let him do it it flows and everything works just perfect the way God intended it amen God has a purpose God has a plan you've heard brother Pat's testimony I think he's told it here before when he was at the Tabernacle one time and the Lord moved on him and said get up and run around the the the pews and he just sat there and himself he wasn't going to do it amen and he said the guy right next to him a couple minutes later the guy right next to him got up jumped around went and run around the pews Hallelujah brother Pat refused to do it so God moved on to the next guy that would amen and he did now what purpose served I don't know that's not me to that's not me to understand why did why was it what was the point I don't know but God whatever God tells you to do you do it amen the best you build it's not out of order amen praise the Lord but we do it according to what the spirit of God is moving on us to do it looks like foolishness to the world sometimes I've seen people look around and SN can't be foolishness to to God's people if it's God doing it amen let's look at this the world falling apart I isn't that the truth am prophetic message uh world falling apart he he preaches this a few times I believe this one's in New York New York 1963 that's the way it was at the beginning the very thing started the whole system of sin was because somebody Eve Satan produced a better plan than God's he produced wisdom they eat from the Tree of knowledge you know brother Ram says another place she went looking for wisdom what have we said before you go looking for something friend I guarantee you'll find it and you might find it in the devil in his playhouse but you'll find it right amen because it might not be the word it might not be God's will that's right amen but if you want to you go looking you'll find it oh oh well I'd rather not dress this way well if you go far enough you're going to find a place to where you dress the way you want to well I don't I don't really want to uh act like this or do well you just go far enough you keep hunting you're going to find a place that tells you oh you don't have to do that oh you don't have to go there oh you don't have to act like that you go far you'll find it amen and you say oh well there it is that's that's that's exactly what I've said this whole time and God's trying to feed you the word and blind you do it amen looking eating as he said from the Tree of knowledge wisdom always takes you away from God faith brings you back to God you don't know God by your great wisdom no that is of the world it's foolishness to God but it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching the word the sword coming out of God's mouth it's a sword regardless amen who is the mouthpiece of God today it's not me I'm a part of it it's his bride that's right amen out of you comes a short sord now obviously there's an office that's held here that that's in that esteem as well that preaches the word amen that falls in that category uh probably in a in a greater light because of the calling but God's called us all but his foolishness to the world the world looks at you especially sisters going through the mall or whatever looks foolish but it's God right brother Pat was talking to us was talking we had we had lunch Thursday and he saw some program or something that uh that they put out a question to a group of people whatever it was and and and asked and put a picture said and ask and had this woman with their hair all cut off and probably shorter than Zach's or maybe even mic's I don't know but uh put it out said is this appropriate for a haircut for a woman over 60 and a lot of people look at that oh that's absolutely low maintenance don't have to mess with it now I I think when I look at that and I say that's that's the attitude of of unbelievers yes period but when I look at it and I see the sisters and I I know what my wife went through and especially early uh that's a whole another story my wife had long beautiful thick hair and then through menopausal and her hair my wife has took such pride in her hair and trying to strengthen it and trying to make it grow and trying to get it thicker and trying to make it look better you know a lot of people just well just shave it all off that's what the world say looks foolish when the world looks and says is this appropriate a Christian looks and says I got to do I want to do everything I can to make it as beautiful as long as thick as as I possibly can your glory to the Lord amen amen is't that right your glory to the Lord your glory your your your honoring of your head yes and a Christian says I want to make it as pretty and as beautiful and as thick and as long and and and the world's out there saying what excuse can I have to cut this mop off yeah that's what the world's saying but a Christian doesn't act that way and it looks foolish when you go out there and you see the rest and what it is with these women nowadays I don't understand are completely shaving their heads of course that's scripture the Bible says you might as well be shaven if you're just going to cut it at all so I guess they're just fulfilling scripture but baldheaded women it uh how many times in my young 57y old life am I going to say never did I ever imagine I would ever see something like this it's happening almost daily anymore Saints it's happening now through the foolishness of the preaching of the word amen the foolishness to the world is through foolishness the preaching of the world uh of his word but it's to save the Lost Amen to save the L lost praise God so God always uses something foolish and simple that's why it goes over people's heads right it's too simple and and I can I can grasp that when you when you really think about it how could something of such great value be free nothing in the world is like that nothing's free period stick of gum's not free unless somebody happens to give it to you and then it wasn't free somebody had to pay for it but how can something of such great value be free it just boggles the mind a normal human mind has difficulty as I understand grasping the concept that salvation is free amen yeah it doesn't cost you anything right and yet your soul is worth 10 million worlds my praise the Lord but it's free I I I see where people get CAU how could something be free in that context when he called let me finish this now when he called his disciples if he would have chosen caus and the great priest they had trained for that hour they couldn't see him obviously there had been something to brag on they had their doctor's degree and everything but he goes down and he gets ignorant men fishermen who couldn't even read their own name or write their own name that he might take uh that he might take nothing and make something out of it amen remember the foolishness of God is greater than anything man's ever known the weakness of God is stronger than the strongest man could ever produce praise the Lord even the great St Paul said he had to forget all he ever know that he might find Christ Christ praise the Lord dying well that saints that had just become such a thing to me anymore dying dying dying daily amen we die of course we give our hearts to the Lord and we give ourselves over to the Lord as a lamb would but there's just something about that dying every day amen dying every day praise the Lord and look today people don't want a pastor unless he can talk just proper make all of his nouns and pronouns boy that puts me way out and if that be so I couldn't get in no pull pit amen because I don't even know the difference between a noun and a pronoun I might a little bit but it's fuzzy and the only thing that I know is I know him and that's all that I care to know amen praise God that's the quote I'm reading amen I'm doing it because I feel so U like me saying it that's all I care to know for he is my noun he is my pronoun he is my life now the things we want to know is him but you see our religious system has adopted the educational system and took and tried to take place of the Holy Spirit that's what they've done to take place of the holy spirit amen we look like fools to the world but to Jesus Christ amen oh it's it's the wisdom praise the Lord because again like we said a couple weeks ago it's not our way it's his way it's not our will it's his will it's not our mind it's his mind praise the Lord man can't comprehend it the bride is growing closer into it but the world they'll never they they can't because it is so contrary every day everything the world does government vention science medicine grows further and further away from God amen I'm not complaining against any of them I live in this Cosmos but it all gets us gets the world further and further away from God yes praise the Lord to one day you won't even need a car you just travel as a thought amen won't have to worry about the atmosphere and fossil fuels and whatever else amen I've heard scientists talk about saying oh the world wasn't made to have this many people well that's true it was only supposed to be designed for those that were in the Lamb's Book of Life amen only those who are in the Lamb's Book of Life are supposed to be the ones that are supposed to be here which probably excludes you I don't want to be judgmental but there's a very good chance it does not include the one who actually made that statement that's all God made it for him and his children yeah praise the Lord wasn't it wasn't to be made for serpent seed it wasn't to be made for unbelievers it was to be made for Christ and uh for God and his children amen praise the Lord Hebrews let's go I got two more scriptures I want to read and we'll close here Hebrews 4:12 we know this very very well Hebrews 4:12 you might even could quote it for the word of God is quick and Powerful that word quick just means alive it's living the word is living amen doesn't mean it's fast it means it's Living Praise the Lord it is living it is quick powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of sunder of Soul and Spirit which we preached on few years back actually on the cero church we delved into that a little deeper which I won't do today piercing even to the dividing aund of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and marrows and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart praise the Lord Discerning the thoughts and intense another quote let me read recognizing your day in its message look at this foolishness you want to talk about foolishness amen some God had to take something foolish to Open the Eyes of a blinded Prophet if you will balam never recognized the angel of the Lord until the mule spoke in tongues amen right all know the story right it brings that image to your mind every time I hear any kind of excert of this story I can see that mule between that between his Stone pillars and and him sitting there banging back and forth that's I picture that every time uh Bam could not recognize that well that and the mule looking back said why are you whipping me would you stop that I'm trying to help you amen that's what I see mu just speaking I have been a good mual to you I've been good to you I've done everything you asked and now you're beating me for no reason and I'm trying to help you yeah that's the same thing people do today too Bam could not recognize that an angel was standing in his way a blinded preacher could not recognize that it was God standing in his way trying to keep him from selling his GI for money so when he came out and the donkey spoke to him God said if it weren't for that dumb mu you be a dead man right now that's right oh bet that donkey got fed good that night he would if his mine and when the mule spoke in a human voice then balum recognized that it was the angel standing in the way keeping him from doing what he was doing oh praise the Lord amen the foolishness what does that look like to man that looks like craziness do you imagine if God did well if if the world did that today and a donkey opened his mouth that probably take him and try to put him in the circus or sell him on eBay or something I got to talk him you well he only spoke in tongues one time he's only going to speak in tongues once you can sell him for a million bucks but he's only going to speak in tongues this one time so it's already been said done and know it's over praise the Lord so one more one more scripture Ephesians chapter 6 uh starting verse 12 amen so bam got off easy in that case but God taking the foolishness of a mule trapping the prophet right there and not going any further mine it's just uh it's it's uh it's quite a story I I like the truth the fact of it is that it actually happened it's true uh I just I we haven't had a pet for a long time but I could just imagine when we had a pet if Rosie or something had opened her mouth and said something uh how would you feel if your dog brother Dennis it would uh it would take you back for sure amen Ephesians chapter 6 ver2 let's read this for wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness the world against spiritual wickedness in high places even though we probably spent the larger part of our energy on the those things that are nominal instead of the things that are spiritual right fighting the things that are natural fighting the things of the flesh coming again instead of fighting the things that are spiritual everything you see that's going on in this world today all these the the evil and the wickedness and all the protest and everything I mean how a person can stand on the side of somebody that would behead a burn a baby I don't get but it's a spirit yes there's a spirit there Saints and we read last week where that Spirit comes from and we know where this spirit is going to lead to I told the Lord yesterday when I was praying in here I said God I know we've preached about this I've read it in scripture I've heard brother BR talk about it I just never realized how hard it was going to be on me to see this country devolve into the place it's getting to right it it's hard I never realized how hard it was going to be to see these things happening and for Israel coming Under Siege Now by so many fronts the turkey pres I think it's the turkey president now is saying I told you one of his high ministers U uh said something derogatory about Israel now I read this Thursday or Friday now the country of Turkey is declaring Israel war crimes against Israel for fighting back for having their women raped and their children beheaded right they are the war criminals see friend and turkey is just North just on the other side of the Mediterranean just North of Israel on all sides remember what the scripture said on all sides I just never realized how hard it was going to be on me personally on on my Humanity on my civility on my flesh on my spirit to see this unfold it just it it's hard sometimes you you want to and my flesh wants to strike back right but it's unfolding is the way God's word said it would and it's going to continue to do so so God help me amen God help us to see it happen I've had people say well if that person is supposed to be the president for this to all unfold let it happen that's hard that's easier said than done right it is to me anyway amen it is it is to me anyway so I'll just leave it there we wrestle not against flesh and blood seed 13th verse wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that that me that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and if this isn't the evil Day friend I don't want to be here when it comes right amen and and honestly we won't be amen when this finalizes and Armageddon unleashes we won't be here right and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girded with the truth having on the brush the breastplate of righteousness we went through every one of these one time too and explained them all and your feet sh with the pration uh preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and listen and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God amen amen the sword of the spirit which is the word of God the word of God God ch chose it not us God chose me amen why I don't know I've told you before when I was in high school I would take an F on a oral report before I'd get up in front of a class of K kids would not speak absolutely refus to I even had one teacher I think it's my English teacher said you know you're going to fail I said I don't care I'm I'm not getting up there and I wouldn't why why God do I don't know you know I always say God takes the strength of you and you're raising and put you in in the position the things in the we went through all that in the adoption series but I think sometimes God takes some of the weaknesses the places where you're the weakest to show that he's the one in control right not you amen because without him Saints I would be paralyzed to fear right now sure to stand in front of you in that camera and going to be on YouTube really new been wouldn't do that that's God some people say oh that's uh uh whatever no no I I I never wanted any part of it I've told you my testimony but I'll leave that again for another day but God sometimes he'll take the weakest part of you and use it just so he can prove to you that it's him doing it not you amen today Christ reveal in his own word today so confused about the evidence excuse me evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot listen now he cannot Satan cannot bring that word word by word why because it's the word that come out of the mouth of God Amen praise the Lord it cannot come he cannot bring it like that because he's not built for it he's not not a Believer amen not called Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift amen tongu prophecy uh interpretations all the gifts all the things that shine out that people always try to want to Major on Satan can impersonate any one of those but he cannot bring this word word by word yes amen he can impersonate the best oror he can impersonate the best speaker he can impersonate the most greatest personality he can impersonate the most emotional he can impersonate any that but he cannot impersonate the word that's why I say when you break all that down and you take all that away it BR it boils down to the word amen what's the word I told you before me and my wife we used to be in services and people shouting screaming carrying on ministers up they're all emotional he's carrying on and these people shouting and screaming and amen and you get outside and I look at my wife and I'm like what is he talking about and we're not novice Saints and look and say what is he talking about we got our church and say oh and they're still just shouting and say yeah that was a wonderful yeah that was a great message I'd ask them what did they say I don't know but it was wonderful how was it wonderful because you got a tickling up down your spine that did you no good only the word is what builds you and brings you and and reveals itself and makes you what you are amen only the word and that's the thing that Satan cannot do is bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden and that's where he's always failed that's where then the tapes on they talked about the the message false anointed ones which we Minister on a couple times here they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still be a devil it's the inside now remember Jesus said all the father had given me no man can come to me except the father draw him first that's simple salvation friend that's a hard thing that people can't understand how could something so great be so fre how can something of such great value cost me nothing amen praise my praise the Lord just my life I give my life to him amen but I do it freely I don't do it because he makes me to I I do it because he tells me I have to or I'm going to hell no no I'm not I don't do this to dodge hell I do this because I love it amen I love it and that's why we do what we do because we love him it's our love towards him now that's foolish to the world right it looks like foolishness in preaching people may be in that barber shop this morning may think they're in there and and and no telling what they I hope not but it's foolishness to the world they look at it and think why would somebody act like like that why would somebody talk like that they don't understand amen but to the world it's foolish to the bride is life to the believer it's life amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could it
