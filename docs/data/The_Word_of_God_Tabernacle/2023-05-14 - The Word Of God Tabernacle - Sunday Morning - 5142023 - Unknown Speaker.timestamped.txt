[39:45] in the arms of Jesus
[39:48] praise the Lord go ahead and turn to the
[39:51] scripture now amen if we can stand to
[39:53] our feet
[40:03] I'm gonna go over to First Kings
[40:17] read the scripture First Kings
[40:21] very familiar scripture just happy
[40:24] Mother's Day as Mike said to all the
[40:27] mothers to all the potential mothers who
[40:29] future mothers who have written name uh
[40:33] incur amen
[40:35] praise the Lord but uh we'll just take a
[40:39] little
[40:39] a little thought on the Mother's Day
[40:41] topic that we have here and of course
[40:44] as uh
[40:46] brother random told us and I adhere to
[40:50] Mother's Day kind of in the world is
[40:52] more of a racket than anything because
[40:55] every day really should be a Mother's
[40:56] Day
[40:58] and how special mothers are to us
[41:01] carrying every child regardless of the
[41:03] circumstance or situation
[41:05] under a heart for nine months you know
[41:07] there's there's going to be that there's
[41:09] going to be that attachment regardless
[41:11] of what it is and it just lays into
[41:14] perspective uh what we live with today
[41:17] in this world
[41:19] and what's going on in the world today
[41:21] so I'm going to title this so many
[41:23] different titles but looking upon and
[41:26] reflecting on Godly women and Godly
[41:29] mothers and looking in the world today
[41:31] and all the things that's going out
[41:33] there and the motherhood if you will
[41:36] that's out there I titled this the heart
[41:38] of a real mother
[41:40] the heart of a real mother so First
[41:42] Kings chapter 3 is where we're going to
[41:44] go to Solomon the story of Solomon and
[41:47] two women that you all very familiar
[41:49] with and draw our context from today
[41:53] amen before we do this is by our heads

[45:05] amen amen
[45:07] amen
[45:08] I will read this uh
[45:12] uh we'll read this story here is again
[45:14] all very familiar to it but
[45:17] um First Kings chapter 3 uh we're gonna
[45:21] begin reading with verse 16. First Kings
[45:25] chapter 3 verse 16.
[45:29] amen I think uh as I as the lord gave me
[45:34] this title here it it this is the first
[45:38] story that came to my heart because to
[45:41] me this probably as much as any biblical
[45:44] story that would that would pertain to a
[45:47] mother or a motherhood uh exhibits the
[45:51] heart of a real mother as much as
[45:53] anything does any story in the scripture
[45:55] any reality of this Bible uh this one
[45:59] does so let's read it as we go through
[46:01] now First Kings chapter 3 verse 16 then
[46:04] came their two women that were harlots
[46:07] unto the king and stood before him the
[46:10] one woman said oh my Lord I and this
[46:12] woman dwell in one house and I was
[46:15] delivered of a child with her in the
[46:17] house and he came to pass the third day
[46:19] after that I was delivered that this
[46:21] woman was delivered also and we were
[46:23] together there was no stranger with us
[46:25] in the house save uh save we too in the
[46:29] house
[46:29] and This Woman's child died in the night
[46:32] because she overlaid it and she arose at
[46:35] midnight or basically in the middle of
[46:37] the night not necessarily at 12 o'clock
[46:40] but in the middle of the night and took
[46:42] my son from beside me while thou
[46:45] handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom
[46:48] and laid her dead child in my bosom and
[46:51] when I Rose in the morning to give my
[46:54] child suck behold it was dead but when I
[46:57] had considered it in the morning behold
[47:00] it was not my son which I did bare the
[47:04] and the other woman said nay but the
[47:06] living is my son and the dead is thy son
[47:09] and this said no but the dead is thy son
[47:12] and the living is my son thus they spake
[47:15] before the king
[47:17] then said the king the one saith this is
[47:20] my son that liveth and thy son is dead
[47:23] the other saith nade but thy son is
[47:25] death and my son is living
[47:28] and the King said bring me a sword and
[47:30] they brought a sword before the king and
[47:32] the King said divide the living child in
[47:35] two and give half to the one and half to
[47:38] the other
[47:39] then spake the woman Whom The Chill the
[47:41] living child was unto the king for her
[47:44] vows yearned upon her son and she said
[47:47] oh my Lord give her the living child and
[47:50] in no wise slay it but the other said
[47:53] Let It Be neither mine nor thine but
[47:56] divided then the king answered and said
[47:59] give her the living child and in no I
[48:01] slayeth she is the mother thereof and
[48:05] all Israel heard of the Judgment which
[48:07] the king had judged and they feared the
[48:10] king for they are respected and
[48:11] reverenced him for they saw that the
[48:14] wisdom of God was in him to do judgment
[48:16] you could be seated if you like again
[48:20] probably as much as anything now there
[48:22] was others there's other instances
[48:25] situations that really display the heart
[48:28] of a true mother a true Godly mother a
[48:30] true Christian mother but this is the
[48:32] first one that came on my heart that was
[48:34] really exemplary of what a real a real
[48:37] true mother for the heart of her son
[48:40] will be amen the real true heart of a
[48:43] mother for her son would want the best
[48:45] for that child would want the best for
[48:48] uh for her son or for her daughter thus
[48:51] she would want whatever it would mean
[48:53] even if it meant for that child to be
[48:56] away from her she would rather her child
[48:59] be away from her and be prosperous and
[49:02] blessed and Alive than actually to be
[49:05] with her and so that's the real heart of
[49:08] a real mother now you see all kinds in
[49:10] the world today but we're talking about
[49:12] the heart of a real mother now I want
[49:14] you to notice uh that a lot of times get
[49:17] skipped over in this story but the fact
[49:19] is when these two women came before the
[49:22] king the scripture says that they were
[49:25] both harlots both of them were amen so
[49:28] as you would think as a harlot would be
[49:31] as you would imagine that that person as
[49:36] we would
[49:37] imagine today or or talk about or uh uh
[49:42] uh display that that that person would
[49:45] be someone of ill Fame someone that
[49:48] didn't have uh the right kind of heart
[49:51] or the right kind of spirit or the right
[49:55] kind of person to want what would be
[49:58] best for their child in other words
[50:00] motherhood and the perversion of a human
[50:04] Spirit can become perverted even
[50:07] regardless of the this feminist spirit
[50:10] that God put which we'll get to a little
[50:12] bit later into the woman even with that
[50:15] feminist Spirit which was put in the
[50:17] woman for a reason even with that that
[50:20] Spirit can be perverted remember the
[50:23] human spirit the mind can be perverted
[50:25] and even with that you'd think well uh
[50:28] neither one of these women would really
[50:30] care that much because you see today uh
[50:33] the same thing and you you see actual
[50:37] normal what considered normal healthy
[50:40] people aborting or uh abortion is just a
[50:44] pleasure word they put to murder because
[50:47] actually abortion is just murder just
[50:50] like a fancy word the devil likes the
[50:52] fancy word stuff that's evil up you know
[50:54] like uh like cancer is just a devil amen
[50:58] it's just a demonic spirit is what it is
[51:01] and just like they fancy of murdering an
[51:04] unborn child with the word abortion so
[51:07] uh you you see millions and millions of
[51:11] that you see if uh turn up in trash bins
[51:14] and uh left on doorsteps and uh all
[51:18] kinds of things happy you think well how
[51:20] could the heart of a mother do that with
[51:22] the heart of a real mother couldn't do
[51:24] that wouldn't do that amen or wouldn't
[51:27] throw them in the river or put them in
[51:28] the trash bin they may give them up for
[51:31] adoption if a mother feels like that
[51:33] she's not able to appropriately take
[51:35] care of that child again that goes to
[51:38] the heart of a mother to rather have
[51:40] that child away from her but Prosper
[51:43] than to have that child uh uh began or
[51:47] or or
[51:48] whatever condition that they think would
[51:51] be derogatory for that child every
[51:54] mother would want the best for that
[51:55] child unless that spirit is perverted
[51:57] you think well the the heart of the
[52:00] heart the the heart of a harlot would
[52:02] already have been perverted but not
[52:04] necessarily right remember the woman at
[52:07] the well
[52:08] the woman at the well does not describe
[52:11] scripturally what her life was like
[52:14] before that period but if you go listen
[52:16] to the dramatization and things that
[52:17] brother random said about her in two or
[52:20] three different places we don't know
[52:22] what that poor girl went through to
[52:24] bring her to the place that she had all
[52:26] of those husbands amen we don't know
[52:29] what she went through we don't know what
[52:31] her life was like it may have been
[52:33] starvation or do this we don't know we
[52:37] don't know what kind of a mother she had
[52:39] that drove her maybe to that point but
[52:42] we do know that when life came when
[52:46] truth came when it presented itself to
[52:49] this woman she received it so there had
[52:52] to be something in her amen you
[52:54] understand what I'm saying there must
[52:55] have been something in her in that woman
[52:58] at the well that when Christ came and he
[53:01] explained to her who he was and her eyes
[53:03] were open she recognized who she was and
[53:06] ran in the city and testified everybody
[53:08] she could find amen so regardless of
[53:11] whether she was a harlot or not her
[53:13] heart wasn't her heart was not corrupted
[53:16] amen her heart was not corrupted that
[53:20] sounds strange but it's true now if you
[53:22] look at this other woman
[53:24] it would appear as though her heart had
[53:27] been corrupted because even though it
[53:29] was her child that she laid over and
[53:31] died look at her attitude when it came
[53:34] to murdering This Little Child right she
[53:37] said I don't care kill it
[53:40] divided half and give apart to me an
[53:43] apartment now what kind of a heart would
[53:45] speak to that right amen now you can see
[53:48] even the difference in the two women
[53:51] right there
[53:52] although they were both harlots the
[53:55] hearts of those women one had the heart
[53:57] of a mother the other didn't
[53:59] because even a true mother would want
[54:02] the child of the other mothers uh the
[54:05] child of the other mother to be helped
[54:07] and blessed too
[54:09] because that's the heart of a real
[54:10] mother it would not say uh if my baby's
[54:14] dead your baby's gonna die
[54:16] see that's a corrupted heart yes even
[54:19] though both women were harlots one heart
[54:22] was was still good
[54:25] we would say because she had that heart
[54:28] of a mother the others wasn't even with
[54:31] her son dead she still wanted the other
[54:33] one dead
[54:34] amen that's not a pure heart but the
[54:37] heart of a real mother stepped forward
[54:39] and said no don't don't kill it give the
[54:43] living child to this woman
[54:46] let the Child live whatever it is even
[54:48] if I have to be without him and of
[54:50] course the wisdom that God had given
[54:52] Solomon so that Solomon in in that
[54:56] wisdom said let's kill the baby we'll
[54:58] find out who the real mother is and the
[55:01] real mother said no don't kill it and
[55:03] Solomon said that's the mother
[55:06] amen
[55:07] mom could we use some of that wisdom
[55:09] today yes
[55:11] get some of that judgment in the world
[55:12] today he got to understand this is the
[55:15] real mother this this woman has the
[55:18] heart of a real mother this one does it
[55:20] amen this one is and a real mother would
[55:23] want her child to live and to prosper
[55:26] and be blessed regardless of what it
[55:28] would cost her regardless of whether it
[55:31] meant that she was going to be separated
[55:33] from that child she still wants what's
[55:36] best for that child now
[55:39] um
[55:39] as Mother's Day is and we'll go over I
[55:43] want to turn over to Genesis chapter 3.
[55:47] amen
[55:49] God purposely
[55:52] in the Garden of Eden God made the man
[55:57] and he made the man with the masculine
[55:59] and the feminist spirit
[56:02] but when God made the Manna help me
[56:06] he took out of the man the feminist
[56:08] Spirit into the woman
[56:11] so you understand when God made the man
[56:15] that helped me
[56:17] he took the feminist Spirit out to put
[56:20] it in this in the female so that the
[56:24] female would have that part of the
[56:26] feminist Spirit to be able to uh
[56:30] accomplish to be able to uh live out the
[56:35] part of of life that was to
[56:38] that was the cause for the feminist
[56:40] Spirit uh the the nurturing and the
[56:44] compassion and the kind of love see
[56:46] there there's there's there's
[56:48] no outside of God there is no match to
[56:54] love outside of a mother's love
[56:56] there's you cannot match a mother's love
[56:58] a real Godly True Mother you can't match
[57:01] your love you can't match your mother's
[57:03] prayer of mother's prayer for her child
[57:06] prevails to God I believe is much or
[57:08] more than any prayer
[57:10] God hears those prayers those prayers
[57:13] continue to reverberate I believe the
[57:16] prayers of my mother continue to
[57:18] reverberate for me
[57:20] she's gone on to her reward I'm still
[57:24] here I believe my mother's prayers is
[57:26] still going on before the Lord the love
[57:28] that she had the heart of that real
[57:30] mother towards her son towards her
[57:32] children of course I'm the only one left
[57:34] but George towards me is still
[57:36] reverberating today it's still having an
[57:39] effect today amen
[57:42] that's that's the part of what God took
[57:45] out of the man and put into the woman
[57:49] the what it what it would be to
[57:52] accomplish that
[57:54] in two individuals instead of one
[57:57] individual
[57:58] because it was the responsibility of one
[58:03] individual at one time that was Adam
[58:06] everything that was to be accomplished
[58:09] and the masculine and feminist Spirit
[58:11] was to be done by one person
[58:14] but when God made a help mate he took
[58:18] that feminist spirit and divided that if
[58:21] you could say job up
[58:23] and the man was to accomplish and live
[58:26] out the masculine part of the job that
[58:28] was to be accomplished in in Eden and
[58:31] the woman was to accomplish the part
[58:33] that was to be done by the feminist
[58:35] spirit
[58:36] through through the woman
[58:39] and that's where the motherhood comes
[58:41] from
[58:42] God did that for a reason God did that
[58:46] for a purpose there's a reason now I
[58:48] know uh it's probably not the same
[58:50] anymore but when I was growing up uh my
[58:54] mother would get upset with me but my
[58:56] mother never disciplined me
[58:58] uh that probably is not necessarily the
[59:01] right thing to do but my mother never
[59:03] disciplined me my mother never spanked
[59:06] me that was only my dad
[59:08] and I don't know how many times I I was
[59:11] according to my dad I was a pretty good
[59:13] boy so uh it didn't happen a whole lot
[59:17] of times but my mom used to tell me
[59:19] where your father gets home
[59:21] why because the part of that was to be
[59:25] accomplished by him right the part of
[59:27] what she had accomplished by her and she
[59:31] said where did you go father gets home
[59:32] would you like a peanut butter jelly for
[59:35] lunch
[59:37] because he's going to discipline you but
[59:40] I'm going to make you lunch
[59:43] amen so that so that was the masculine
[59:47] part the man amen right or wrong
[59:49] probably not uh probably not politically
[59:51] correct anymore but I was
[59:54] my my dad was a disciplinarian and my
[59:58] mother made me lunch uh because she was
[1:00:01] the nurturer she was the one that loved
[1:00:04] she was the one that was there that was
[1:00:05] compassionate and and uh and look Beyond
[1:00:09] those things but my dad knew that I
[1:00:11] needed not that she didn't know but
[1:00:14] needed the correction
[1:00:16] so it worked both ways amen amen the job
[1:00:19] of raising Newton Bennett was
[1:00:21] accomplished by two people the man and
[1:00:24] the woman
[1:00:24] now
[1:00:26] you see what's happening in the world
[1:00:27] today
[1:00:29] now brother random told us 50 years ago
[1:00:31] 60 years ago that it's not juvenile
[1:00:34] delinquency it is
[1:00:37] parent delinquency
[1:00:39] and the more the time goes by the more
[1:00:42] you see it the more it becomes prevalent
[1:00:45] the more you recognize it
[1:00:48] um
[1:00:49] the more you see that one parent homes
[1:00:52] just don't do it or no parent homes it's
[1:00:56] like my Capri sometimes a man has to be
[1:00:59] mom and dad sometimes a woman has to be
[1:01:02] mom and dad
[1:01:04] uh and and that's sometimes works out
[1:01:09] I've there's uh people I know in fact
[1:01:13] one guy that's a senator in South
[1:01:16] Carolina now he's a black fella Scott uh
[1:01:19] Senator Scott I forget his name but uh
[1:01:22] he talks about if I remember right he
[1:01:24] talks about being raised by his mother
[1:01:26] see but how many times that that is an
[1:01:30] anomaly how many times is it though that
[1:01:33] when it's only the mother that's there
[1:01:35] to raise the child that the child loses
[1:01:38] that sense of masculinity and and
[1:01:43] one and and usually goes one of two ways
[1:01:47] it either reverts back and becomes more
[1:01:49] into an effeminate Spirit or it goes out
[1:01:52] and it just it it overdoes the masculine
[1:01:55] part and kills people and Bullies people
[1:01:58] and uh all those things see it was it
[1:02:02] was my point is that the raising of the
[1:02:05] child was meant to be done by the man
[1:02:07] and the woman
[1:02:09] there was it was meant to be a a a a
[1:02:12] male and a female there now of course
[1:02:15] sometimes things happen and uh that
[1:02:17] can't be done but optimally that's the
[1:02:20] way it's supposed to be so when God here
[1:02:23] in Genesis chapter 3 separated that
[1:02:26] Spirit let's look here
[1:02:28] amen because
[1:02:30] um
[1:02:31] would dabble a little bit in in the
[1:02:35] things that's going on in the world
[1:02:36] today but let's look First Genesis
[1:02:39] chapter 3 verse 17. now this is after
[1:02:42] the fall of course
[1:02:47] Genesis 3 17
[1:02:49] and unto Adam he said because thou has
[1:02:52] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[1:02:55] has Eden of the tree of which I
[1:02:57] commanded these saying they thou shall
[1:03:00] not eat of it cursed is the ground for
[1:03:03] thy sake and Sorrows shall thou eat of
[1:03:06] it all the days of thy life now remember
[1:03:09] as we said the other day we read this
[1:03:11] God did not curse Adam he cursed the
[1:03:13] ground for Adam's sake amen so when so
[1:03:18] when God cursed the ground
[1:03:20] now you know that God God in the
[1:03:23] beginning said let there be created the
[1:03:25] Earth the heavens and everything that
[1:03:28] was therein
[1:03:29] but when he did that he took from what
[1:03:32] he created to continue his creation he
[1:03:36] created botany life he created animal
[1:03:38] life he created human life
[1:03:40] and so much so that when the fall came
[1:03:43] when uh when this took place
[1:03:48] um let's just continue reading
[1:03:52] thorns and Thorns also in thistle shall
[1:03:55] it bring uh forth to thee and thou shalt
[1:03:58] eat the herb of the field and the sweat
[1:04:01] of thy face shalt thou eat bread till
[1:04:04] thou return unto the ground for out of
[1:04:07] it was thou taken for dust Thou Art unto
[1:04:10] dust shalt thou return
[1:04:12] now when if God cursed the ground
[1:04:16] then everything that was from the ground
[1:04:19] is cursed also
[1:04:22] when when Adam fell that's how we know
[1:04:25] that when Adam fell all of creation fell
[1:04:30] you say well how can botany life fail
[1:04:33] because body life dies off every year
[1:04:37] and it never was intended to be that way
[1:04:41] it'll it'll raise back again bring back
[1:04:44] another spring another leaves more fruit
[1:04:46] but it dies out during certain periods
[1:04:50] of time most of them do anyway the
[1:04:52] grassers uh trees and things like that
[1:04:55] and it it it it it doesn't have that
[1:04:58] Everlasting as it was to be to begin
[1:05:00] with animal life of course we know does
[1:05:03] amen you see the animal life before the
[1:05:06] animal well and body like rose bushes
[1:05:09] they didn't have Thorn stickers the
[1:05:11] cactus and everything that that didn't
[1:05:14] exist before the fall uh everything
[1:05:17] became gnarled up and and
[1:05:21] sticky if you will uh animal life same
[1:05:25] thing you never had a a lion eating of
[1:05:29] eating a lamb
[1:05:31] you never had these animals attacking
[1:05:33] each other we got
[1:05:36] um falcons fly around our building and
[1:05:38] those Falcons will come and catch
[1:05:40] another little bird and eat it
[1:05:42] I I didn't think of Falcon would ever do
[1:05:45] that but it does they do they come and
[1:05:47] catch them I see them they catch them
[1:05:48] and they they'll they'll kill the little
[1:05:50] bird and eat it
[1:05:51] and it never would have done that and
[1:05:54] look at human life I accumulates human
[1:05:56] all the time not necessarily in
[1:05:57] cannibalism but murder and uh and and
[1:06:01] saying horrible things about each other
[1:06:04] and running down one another's character
[1:06:05] and hating one another and you see it
[1:06:08] happen all the time in human life
[1:06:10] all of creation fell so the so when God
[1:06:14] cursed he cursed the ground for Adam's
[1:06:17] sake and said from thus that you came
[1:06:20] and dust you'll return amen when it was
[1:06:24] cursed all of creation was cursed all of
[1:06:27] creation fell Saints but I want you to
[1:06:30] notice something
[1:06:32] even though animal nature animal life
[1:06:36] has been cursed even though animal life
[1:06:38] doesn't have a soul
[1:06:42] I would put most animals against a lot
[1:06:46] of women today as a mother
[1:06:49] sometimes I feel like
[1:06:52] you had these uh Jungle Book stories of
[1:06:55] or Tarzan Tarzan was raised by
[1:06:57] supposedly raised by apes or uh uh a
[1:07:02] little baby Raised by Wolves or
[1:07:04] something sometimes I wonder if that's
[1:07:05] not better than some of the women today
[1:07:08] amen unfortunately look at it
[1:07:10] the the greatest babysitter you got
[1:07:12] today you can't hardly go in a
[1:07:14] restaurant today and some kids not
[1:07:15] watching a monitor monitors are the uh
[1:07:18] the number one babysitter for kids today
[1:07:20] and I I I'm sorry I don't I just
[1:07:25] um uh I know I was raced at a different
[1:07:28] time but I just don't know that there's
[1:07:30] anything on there that is so necessary
[1:07:32] that you can't have a child sit at a
[1:07:34] dinner table without pitching a fit
[1:07:37] without watching some Mickey Mouse or
[1:07:39] something
[1:07:41] uh just how is that training a child
[1:07:43] yeah
[1:07:44] yeah it just doesn't make sense to me
[1:07:46] you don't see the animal doing that
[1:07:49] amen well they can do it well they race
[1:07:54] they raise the child by the nature that
[1:07:57] they have
[1:07:58] amen most animal nature and that's
[1:08:00] that's and that's in a fallen condition
[1:08:04] and without a soul the animal doesn't
[1:08:06] have a soul but yet still unfortunately
[1:08:09] seems like a lot of animals do a better
[1:08:11] job than people would do at raising
[1:08:13] their own child but look at the other
[1:08:15] look at here now
[1:08:17] um
[1:08:18] out of the ground
[1:08:20] um
[1:08:21] uh that tilled out return unto the
[1:08:24] ground for out of it was thou taken for
[1:08:26] dust Thou Art and to dust shalt thou
[1:08:28] return and Adam called his wife's name e
[1:08:32] because she was the mother of all living
[1:08:35] and Adam also in his wife
[1:08:39] unto excuse me unto Adam also unto his
[1:08:43] wife did the Lord God make coats of
[1:08:46] skins and clothe them now notice
[1:08:49] God did not and it was never that we
[1:08:52] ever saw nothing we ever heard in the
[1:08:55] scripture about an animal dying or body
[1:08:58] life or anything else until after the
[1:09:02] fall
[1:09:03] after the fall
[1:09:05] after judgment has been laid God laid
[1:09:09] out the judgment and the serpent of the
[1:09:11] woman to the man
[1:09:12] cursed the ground only at that time
[1:09:16] that you read an animal with slain
[1:09:19] and God did it
[1:09:20] God is the one now who slain the animal
[1:09:24] they met a lot of people want to say uh
[1:09:26] different things about killing animals
[1:09:29] and things it never was so in the
[1:09:31] beginning it was not supposed to be that
[1:09:33] way but nor was a human supposed to die
[1:09:36] Noah's body life supposed to die or had
[1:09:39] thorns and stickers on them all of this
[1:09:41] none of this was supposed to be from the
[1:09:43] beginning but after the fall is when you
[1:09:47] read for the first time that an animal
[1:09:49] dies and it dies for the most noble
[1:09:52] purpose God Did It for sacrificial
[1:09:55] purposes
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:57] God did it but it was only after the
[1:10:00] fall that God did it right now what is
[1:10:02] happening now what is happening in the
[1:10:04] world today
[1:10:06] now they're changing they're trying to
[1:10:10] change roles
[1:10:12] the man is is working so hard in in many
[1:10:18] places to become the woman
[1:10:20] and the woman has worked so hard to
[1:10:23] become the man
[1:10:24] you see it even in the world today and
[1:10:27] and the things that uh that's that's
[1:10:30] promoted and pushed out there to to make
[1:10:33] the male more feminine
[1:10:36] well that's all for a purpose it's all
[1:10:39] to a reason Saints amen is to completely
[1:10:43] first of all abolish the the family
[1:10:47] Dynamic and to crush motherhood
[1:10:51] because when you've crushed motherhood
[1:10:53] you've crushed your nation
[1:10:56] look what brother random said here
[1:10:59] um this isn't one of the questions and
[1:11:00] answers but he said and the backbone of
[1:11:03] Any Nation is Womanhood
[1:11:06] when it comes to morals
[1:11:08] and when you break motherhood look what
[1:11:11] he said now when you break motherhood
[1:11:14] you've broke your nation
[1:11:17] well what do you expect to happen in the
[1:11:18] world today then
[1:11:20] the whole focus and aim of the devil and
[1:11:23] upon this country and upon humanity is
[1:11:26] to First destroy the family but then to
[1:11:29] break the woman
[1:11:31] to break motherhood
[1:11:34] and when it's done then the nation's
[1:11:36] finished right right and you look at it
[1:11:38] today where does it stand
[1:11:40] you have people that are that are still
[1:11:43] good people you have Christians and used
[1:11:46] to have people that are just good people
[1:11:48] I mean people that are good people and
[1:11:50] and and they take care of their children
[1:11:53] and they're they're not necessarily a
[1:11:55] bunch of roustables and and
[1:11:58] you know just
[1:12:01] going out to bars every night and that
[1:12:03] kind of they're good people they might
[1:12:05] go to a nominal church or might not go
[1:12:07] to a church or they might go Christmas
[1:12:09] and Easter but they raise their kids
[1:12:10] right they want them in a good school
[1:12:12] and they want their kids raised right
[1:12:14] and not indoctrinated in school but but
[1:12:17] taught in school and so that they're
[1:12:19] they're children raised to where they're
[1:12:22] proud of their posterity they want to
[1:12:24] continue the family lineage but it seems
[1:12:27] like and probably because it seems like
[1:12:30] the negative is pushed out pushed out in
[1:12:33] front so much that that it's it's become
[1:12:35] an overwhelming thing that it's it's
[1:12:37] gone the other direction
[1:12:40] uh I I I you see all kinds when you go
[1:12:44] to an airport uh there's there's all
[1:12:47] kinds of people so malls uh airports
[1:12:50] things like that
[1:12:52] um you you can almost see the past 200
[1:12:56] years in an airport uh you can see
[1:13:00] poodle skirts and uh you can see hairdos
[1:13:05] from the 50s and you can see uh just
[1:13:08] about anything up up to Modern today to
[1:13:11] where sometimes you look at it and it's
[1:13:14] almost like they started in the 20s and
[1:13:16] they finished in the 2000s
[1:13:19] from from top to bottom or bottom to top
[1:13:21] and I'm not making fun of them that's
[1:13:23] just all they know see that's that hell
[1:13:25] horse rider uh we're living in the day
[1:13:27] of the Revelation 5 the pale horse rider
[1:13:30] where all those mixed up colors is all
[1:13:32] together is taking all that from here
[1:13:33] and all that from there and it's mixing
[1:13:35] all together there's no when I was going
[1:13:37] to school there was an identity there
[1:13:39] was certain specific identity it was
[1:13:40] stupid but it was an identity
[1:13:42] uh and probably every uh child going
[1:13:45] through school uh High School had some
[1:13:48] certain identity uh that looked
[1:13:51] ridiculous and stupid uh and ours did
[1:13:53] too but it was an identity today there
[1:13:56] isn't you don't see one you I I've been
[1:13:59] when I was driving I'd be about high
[1:14:01] school and and see kids coming out of
[1:14:03] high school you see all kinds of kids
[1:14:06] used to be uh when I went to school it
[1:14:09] was used it was usually one or maybe two
[1:14:12] things you see a kid look like one or
[1:14:15] two things whatever it was Amen in the
[1:14:17] 80s but now you see kids come out and
[1:14:20] some have hair down here and some shape
[1:14:24] it some I have just it it's just all
[1:14:29] mixed up uh it it just there's no
[1:14:33] identity anymore because it's all mixed
[1:14:36] together it's all mixed up and it's just
[1:14:38] the situation of the world and and how
[1:14:41] we're living I think when I and when I
[1:14:44] see
[1:14:45] uh at a store or something I see a dad
[1:14:49] go down the go down the the aisle and
[1:14:52] he's got him a ponytail or something
[1:14:54] down here you look and that little boy
[1:14:56] his little boy's got the exact same
[1:14:57] thing
[1:14:59] you go on you you see a
[1:15:02] a a a woman she's got tattoos all over
[1:15:06] and I see this little girl and what she
[1:15:08] got little tattoos now they're probably
[1:15:10] the little fake ones that but she's got
[1:15:12] tattoos on her thing how what chance
[1:15:14] does that portal and girl have with a
[1:15:17] mother like that
[1:15:18] what chance is that little boy got with
[1:15:21] a father like that
[1:15:22] and it just it just speaks to the parent
[1:15:25] delinquency again that there is in the
[1:15:27] world today right the parent delinquency
[1:15:29] and the Heart of the mother and I I'm
[1:15:33] not going to declare it officially but
[1:15:35] to me it looks as though the heart of
[1:15:37] the mother is broken in this nation
[1:15:40] the heart of the mother is broken in
[1:15:42] this nation to the point that less than
[1:15:45] 50 I heard statistics lately less than
[1:15:49] 50 percent of women today chroming
[1:15:51] growing up at a high school college want
[1:15:54] to be mothers
[1:15:56] less than 50 percent want to have
[1:15:58] children that's a sad State of Affairs
[1:16:01] friend now part of it they claim is
[1:16:03] because of climate change and they don't
[1:16:05] want any more children but
[1:16:08] whatever the reason less than 50 percent
[1:16:11] of girls today growing up when I was
[1:16:14] growing up it was it was a foregone
[1:16:17] conclusion
[1:16:18] it just it just happened the
[1:16:22] girl wanted to be a mother they had
[1:16:25] little baby dolls and carried around and
[1:16:27] mother little plastic little molded
[1:16:29] pieces of plastic they bothered them
[1:16:32] because it was in them to do
[1:16:34] it was in their heart to want to be a
[1:16:36] mother the whole time and she's
[1:16:37] mothering this little piece of plastic
[1:16:38] trying to shove this little bottle of
[1:16:40] just to mother this piece of plastic and
[1:16:42] there's nothing in it amen but
[1:16:45] but that's what she wanted to do
[1:16:47] nowadays it's it's it it barely exists
[1:16:51] if at all
[1:16:53] now look what's happening
[1:16:55] Romans chapter 8 in the spirit Realm
[1:16:58] Romans chapter 8 I'll pose here in a few
[1:17:00] minutes
[1:17:05] Romans chapter 8 what is what is
[1:17:08] happening in this in the spirit realm
[1:17:10] now
[1:17:11] the the spiritual battle that that's
[1:17:13] that's going on
[1:17:15] the and and the spiritual battle for
[1:17:17] your children is now becoming a physical
[1:17:19] battle
[1:17:21] you hear it all the time
[1:17:23] the devil's after your kids
[1:17:26] the devil's after your children you've
[1:17:28] got to protect your children now more
[1:17:31] than ever yes there there are more
[1:17:34] organizations today uh out in schools
[1:17:40] teaching them and telling them your
[1:17:43] parents don't need to know your parents
[1:17:45] should know there's there's actual uh
[1:17:49] political leaders saying that the
[1:17:51] children don't belong to the parents
[1:17:54] the political leaders of this country
[1:17:57] are saying that children do not belong
[1:17:59] to the parents they belong to the
[1:18:01] community
[1:18:04] friend more than ever now is the time to
[1:18:06] guard to protect
[1:18:08] but what's happening in that Spirit
[1:18:10] realm of Romans chapter 8
[1:18:14] we see what's taking place for us now
[1:18:16] Romans 8 18. for I reckon that the
[1:18:20] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:18:22] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:18:25] which shall be revealed in US
[1:18:27] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:18:30] creature or creation
[1:18:33] the earnest expectation
[1:18:36] of the creation is waiting for the
[1:18:40] manifestation or the revealing the
[1:18:43] unveiling of the sons of God
[1:18:46] the manifesting of the sons of God
[1:18:50] the unveiling of the sons of God all of
[1:18:54] creation is groaning and waiting for the
[1:18:57] sons of God to begin to manifest to
[1:19:00] begin to unfold and reveal
[1:19:03] why
[1:19:05] for the creature was made subject to
[1:19:07] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:19:11] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[1:19:14] because the creature itself also amen
[1:19:19] creation itself also shall be delivered
[1:19:23] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:19:26] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[1:19:28] Amen when the sons of God when the
[1:19:31] children of God begin to unfold begin to
[1:19:34] reveal begin to manifest all of creation
[1:19:37] is happy
[1:19:39] because creation itself will be
[1:19:42] delivered from this bondage praise the
[1:19:45] Lord it'll go back to the way it was
[1:19:49] for we know that the whole creation
[1:19:51] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[1:19:54] until now
[1:19:55] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:19:58] which have the first fruits of the
[1:20:00] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:20:03] ourselves waiting for the adoption that
[1:20:05] is to say to wit that is to say the
[1:20:08] Redemption of our bodies
[1:20:11] the Redemption of our bodies friends if
[1:20:13] we are that close if we believe and feel
[1:20:17] that we are that close to the point of
[1:20:20] the Redemption of our bodies a rapture
[1:20:23] then where are we at today yes in
[1:20:26] regards to the manifestation of the sons
[1:20:29] of God where are we God's children are
[1:20:32] beginning to manifest themselves show
[1:20:35] themselves in who they really are and
[1:20:37] look the darker the world gets the
[1:20:39] greater the light shines on the true
[1:20:41] Christian
[1:20:42] the crazier you look the more odd you
[1:20:46] look the more peculiar you are but the
[1:20:49] brighter the light shines because
[1:20:51] everything else is getting so dark all
[1:20:54] of the world is going uh in in a chaotic
[1:20:58] condition
[1:21:00] but God
[1:21:01] has his children
[1:21:03] God in the spirit realm has those that
[1:21:07] believe that are becoming the manifested
[1:21:10] sons of God
[1:21:12] they're revealing and unveiling who they
[1:21:16] are as sons of God yes not just words
[1:21:20] not just letters on a page but a living
[1:21:23] representation of Jesus Christ on the
[1:21:26] Earth today yes a manifestation of of
[1:21:31] God's children to show and to bring
[1:21:34] because when this happens
[1:21:36] the the blending over from this world
[1:21:40] that we live in into eternity will come
[1:21:43] to fruition and all of creation will
[1:21:46] come back to the place that it was in
[1:21:48] the Garden of Eden
[1:21:50] amen the line will lay down with the
[1:21:53] lamb yes there'll be no more thorns and
[1:21:55] thistles no more Cactus like this no
[1:21:59] more thorns on the rose bush
[1:22:01] botany life animal life human life will
[1:22:04] all back come back to the place that it
[1:22:06] was originally meant to be amen through
[1:22:10] this as this manifested sons of God now
[1:22:14] I want to read one more
[1:22:17] uh scripture
[1:22:21] uh over in Exodus
[1:22:28] and we're going to close
[1:22:31] Exodus chapter 2
[1:22:33] beginning with verse 1.
[1:22:38] Exodus 2 1.
[1:22:43] and there when a man of the house of
[1:22:45] Levi
[1:22:46] and took to wife a daughter of Levi
[1:22:50] and the woman conceived and bear a son
[1:22:53] and when she saw him that he was a
[1:22:56] goodly child she hid him three months
[1:22:58] she hidden because Pharaoh had put out a
[1:23:01] decree because the the Israelites were
[1:23:05] so blessed the Hebrews were so blessed
[1:23:07] God was with him so much that they
[1:23:09] multiplied and prospered and multiplied
[1:23:11] and prospered
[1:23:12] and the race of the rose of a pharaoh
[1:23:15] who knew not Joseph and the promise that
[1:23:16] that Pharaoh had made to Joseph in his
[1:23:18] in his posterity to come and live in
[1:23:21] Goshen that they they they they became
[1:23:24] such a mighty uh people Pharaoh was
[1:23:28] afraid that they would rise up against
[1:23:30] pharaoh and against Egypt and take over
[1:23:32] the place
[1:23:33] so he starts telling the middle they
[1:23:35] bring him in bondage and they put them
[1:23:37] in hard bondage and and they start
[1:23:39] turning them into slaves and he tells
[1:23:42] the he tells the midwives that deliver
[1:23:44] the Hebrew children uh when they're
[1:23:47] delivered if it's a female keep it alive
[1:23:49] but if it's a male kill it
[1:23:52] so now
[1:23:55] jacobeds
[1:23:57] son Moses is born
[1:24:00] she sees he's a goodly child and hides
[1:24:02] him for three months so he doesn't get
[1:24:03] killed now of course
[1:24:05] The Midwives feared God too so they were
[1:24:07] holding back killing the the men
[1:24:09] children as well but she hid Moses three
[1:24:14] months
[1:24:16] but when she can no longer hide him she
[1:24:18] took him uh she took for him an archival
[1:24:22] rushes out dogged it with slime and with
[1:24:24] pitch put the child they're in and she
[1:24:26] laid it in the flags by the riverbank
[1:24:29] River Brink Rivers Brink
[1:24:31] and his sister stood afar off Miriam to
[1:24:35] be at what would be done to him
[1:24:38] the daughter of pharaoh came down to
[1:24:40] wash herself at the river and her
[1:24:42] maidens walked Along by the Riverside
[1:24:44] and when she saw the ark among the flags
[1:24:47] she sent her maid to fetch it and when
[1:24:51] she had opened it she saw the child and
[1:24:53] behold the Babe wept now see if this if
[1:24:57] there's anything in the heart especially
[1:24:59] the heart of a woman it's going to have
[1:25:02] compassion for that child regardless of
[1:25:04] if it was against the pharaoh's edict
[1:25:07] regardless of if it was a Hebrew or
[1:25:09] whatever
[1:25:10] her heart went out the baby's crying the
[1:25:15] baby wept and she had compassion on him
[1:25:17] and said this is one of the Hebrews
[1:25:20] children
[1:25:21] but she had such compassion that her
[1:25:23] heart reached out to this child and took
[1:25:25] it unto herself now notice this
[1:25:28] as I close
[1:25:31] God
[1:25:33] would have allowed this to happen so to
[1:25:37] the place
[1:25:38] that we don't know how many Hebrew boys
[1:25:41] were killed before after Moses
[1:25:47] but if Pharaoh had not you said this is
[1:25:51] the tender hand of Jehovah now
[1:25:53] amen the tender hand into Jehovah a lot
[1:25:55] of people say
[1:25:56] why would God allow such a thing
[1:26:00] why would God allow the pharaoh to put
[1:26:03] out an Egypt edict to kill all the
[1:26:06] Hebrew boys
[1:26:08] well if that edict wasn't there she
[1:26:10] would have never hid Moses
[1:26:12] if that edict wasn't there she would
[1:26:14] have never put him in that uh in that
[1:26:17] River
[1:26:18] to be found by Pharaoh's daughter to be
[1:26:21] put and raised in the how of Halls of
[1:26:23] Egypt right under the pharaoh's nose who
[1:26:26] was supposed to be the deliverer of the
[1:26:29] people that he just put in bondage
[1:26:32] amen you try to write a strip like that
[1:26:35] friend it doesn't work that way but God
[1:26:38] knows what he's doing
[1:26:40] God knows exactly what he's doing even
[1:26:42] when it becomes a hardship it looks like
[1:26:44] sometimes to us God can see remember the
[1:26:48] vision of faith God can see further than
[1:26:50] we can he knows the end from the
[1:26:52] beginning that's right you think this
[1:26:55] looks cruel but if it hadn't been for
[1:26:57] that eating from that fair hero and
[1:26:59] don't know how many Hebrews you how many
[1:27:01] Hebrew mothers lost their son they'll be
[1:27:04] with them in eternity but I don't know
[1:27:07] how many there in this life that they
[1:27:09] lost
[1:27:10] but if it hadn't been for that none of
[1:27:12] the other story of Moses would have ever
[1:27:13] would have ever happened
[1:27:16] amen amen God started right there how
[1:27:20] did God start the Deliverance of the
[1:27:22] children of Israel he started it with an
[1:27:25] edict from the heart of pharaoh to kill
[1:27:28] the Hebrew boys
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:32] that just sounds rational but God knows
[1:27:35] exactly what he's doing amen how could
[1:27:38] we even begin to question why and how
[1:27:40] God does things because he works all
[1:27:42] things together for our good and our
[1:27:44] vision of faith is not right here our
[1:27:46] vision of faith is in the future our
[1:27:48] vision of faith is through the
[1:27:49] eternities friend and what does it
[1:27:52] matter I've said this a few weeks a
[1:27:53] couple months ago
[1:27:56] remember all children go to heaven
[1:28:00] and if all children go to heaven and you
[1:28:03] get to spend eternity with your child or
[1:28:06] with your son daughter over there
[1:28:09] what better thing
[1:28:11] I would rather have my children through
[1:28:14] eternity than here on this Earth
[1:28:16] I'm thankful God give give them to us
[1:28:19] but one of them is with the Lord
[1:28:21] and I know we know we'll see him again
[1:28:28] as much or more to me than if he was
[1:28:30] said
[1:28:31] his congregation
[1:28:33] amen
[1:28:34] because I'm going to be with him on the
[1:28:36] other side
[1:28:38] they will be with them on the other side
[1:28:40] and God knows that
[1:28:42] and he takes care of us is the tender
[1:28:45] hand of Jehovah maneuvering and making
[1:28:47] any what did he do he he used the heart
[1:28:50] of a mother to bring this about
[1:28:54] he got into her heart to cause her to do
[1:28:57] this to realize I would rather have my
[1:29:00] son raised enough
[1:29:03] wherever else I'd rather I'd rather risk
[1:29:05] him to the crocodiles in the Nile River
[1:29:13] I'd rather risk I've trusted my God and
[1:29:16] put him right in the hands of pharaoh
[1:29:18] and the and the Allah pharaoh
[1:29:20] praise the Lord and not only that
[1:29:23] but
[1:29:25] the the woman found Miriam and Miriam
[1:29:29] led her to her mother who actually
[1:29:33] nursed her own son because of her act
[1:29:38] she still got to nurse Moses
[1:29:41] praise the Lord because God's mindful
[1:29:44] Ness God knows exactly what he's doing
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:49] in this message Mother's Day 1959
[1:29:52] brother Graham said you know a man like
[1:29:54] Moses if he could credit anything to his
[1:29:57] character it was because he had a
[1:30:00] god-sent mother
[1:30:01] and God used that mother's heart
[1:30:04] to to bring this that whole thing about
[1:30:08] you know it was she that prayed Jocko
[1:30:12] bed
[1:30:13] and had long for this baby
[1:30:15] and when he was born she was the one who
[1:30:19] cooed him cuddled him built the ark

[1:30:22] her poor heartbreaking her only little
[1:30:26] baby outstanding
[1:30:28] um
[1:30:29] the most outstanding little chunk that
[1:30:32] was in all the world
[1:30:34] and how a mother likes any baby but this
[1:30:37] special little fella and then in her
[1:30:39] heart she knew that he was born for a
[1:30:42] purpose and then he had to take place
[1:30:45] and place him in the very dinner the
[1:30:47] crocodiles in the Nile River by faith
[1:30:50] she did it knowing god was able to take
[1:30:52] care of him and to summarize the love of
[1:30:55] a mother and the actions of the
[1:30:56] character of her faith for Faith does
[1:30:59] not Place itself upon the sifting
[1:31:01] shifting Sands Faith rests solidly upon
[1:31:05] the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal word
