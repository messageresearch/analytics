[54:04] christ we pray amen amen
[54:07] amen matthew
[54:09] chapter 26 i'll read one verse
[54:11] subscription that will let you be seated
[54:13] i got a few more that
[54:15] the story that i want to read
[54:16] but um
[54:19] let's let's just read verse 39
[54:21] amen let's read verse 39 so matthew 26
[54:24] 39 and he went a little further and fell
[54:27] down on his face and prayed saying oh my
[54:30] father if it was if it be possible let
[54:32] this cup pass from me nevertheless not
[54:35] as i will but as thou will
[54:38] you be seated if you like
[54:40] amen
[54:43] now we know that god doesn't
[54:45] predestinate based on his will
[54:47] but god does have a will
[54:49] god does have a purpose
[54:51] god does have in his heart something for
[54:53] all of us yes and i do believe saints as
[54:57] we talked about last week and heard
[54:59] brother dennis praying and you know in
[55:01] our hearts and in our lives we can give
[55:04] perspective to the things that we know
[55:07] in the word and the and the prophecies
[55:09] that we've heard
[55:10] and we know that what god brought to our
[55:12] prophet and what he spoke and the
[55:14] prophecies he gave us and we exhorted
[55:16] that last week a little bit as he talked
[55:18] about watching russia and the things
[55:20] that's going on today and even as that
[55:22] prophecy went forth it was the soviet
[55:23] union it wasn't russia
[55:26] uh but but we do know and we do
[55:29] recognize that even when the perspective
[55:31] of that happens we don't try to make
[55:33] that fit anything i talked about that a
[55:36] little bit last week we see things
[55:38] happening but we i don't know that
[55:40] that's exactly that god does
[55:42] amen and if it is praise the lord i
[55:44] might have my opinion of it and it might
[55:46] be right it might be wrong but it
[55:48] doesn't matter because the number one
[55:50] thing that we always do
[55:52] number one that we always do is keep
[55:55] your eyes on christ amen amen keep your
[55:58] eyes on jesus praise the lord that's the
[56:01] number one thing amen to watch russia i
[56:03] believe you can watch i believe you can
[56:05] uh uh get the perspective on that while
[56:08] you keep your eyes on jesus but the
[56:10] number one thing that we always do is
[56:12] keep our eyes on jesus
[56:14] amen keep our eyes on christ now let's
[56:16] go back to the 36th verse i want to read
[56:18] through this story
[56:20] amen we all know the story very well and
[56:22] it's just a thought that came on my
[56:23] heart the other day
[56:24] um
[56:26] just trying to find something in the
[56:28] mind of the lord of what he might speak
[56:29] to us about and the lord took me back to
[56:32] last week when i made a couple of
[56:33] comments about you know it's no time to
[56:35] play church
[56:37] it's no time to fool around this is no
[56:38] time to straddle offense this is no time
[56:41] to act like a christian in church and
[56:44] and live like the world when you're not
[56:46] this is no time to pretend this is no
[56:48] time to put on heirs this is no time to
[56:50] be pretentious this is the time that we
[56:53] come and we're sold out to this
[56:56] we are sold out soul mind body spirit
[56:59] everything we are everything we've got
[57:01] to this because this is this is
[57:04] everything amen this word this this life
[57:08] uh this spirit it's everything it's all
[57:10] it's all in all to us
[57:12] but look down
[57:14] then jesus 36th verse then jesus cometh
[57:17] that are then cometh jesus with him unto
[57:19] a place called gethsemane
[57:21] and said unto the disciples set ye here
[57:24] while i go and pray yonder and he took
[57:27] with him peter and the two sons of
[57:29] zebedee
[57:30] began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[57:33] said unto them my soul is exceeding
[57:35] sorrowful even unto death carry ye here
[57:39] and watch with me
[57:41] and he went a little further and fell on
[57:43] his face and prayed saying o my father
[57:46] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[57:48] me
[57:49] nevertheless not as i will but as thou
[57:51] will
[57:52] and he cometh unto the disciples and
[57:54] findeth them asleep and saith unto peter
[57:57] what
[57:58] could you not watch with me one hour
[58:00] watch and pray that you enter not into
[58:02] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[58:05] but the flesh is weak
[58:07] he went away again the second time and
[58:09] prayed saying o my father if this cup
[58:12] may not pass away from me except i drink
[58:15] it thy will be done
[58:17] and he came and found them asleep again
[58:19] for their eyes were very heavy he left
[58:22] him and went away again and prayed the
[58:24] third time saying the same words then
[58:27] cometh he to his disciples and saith
[58:29] unto them sleep on now and take your
[58:31] rest behold the hours at hand the son of
[58:34] man is betrayed into the hands of
[58:35] sinners
[58:36] rise let us go let us be going behold he
[58:40] is at hand that betrayed me now i want
[58:42] to focus on that 39th verse which is of
[58:45] course what we started off with and
[58:47] seeing
[58:48] when jesus coming to this place
[58:51] uh coming to to the place where it's a
[58:55] show down there in the garden of
[58:57] gethsemane this was a showdown with
[59:00] with with christ the spirit of god and
[59:03] the flesh of the man of jesus that was
[59:06] that was warring against each other and
[59:08] we know what that war is about we fight
[59:11] that war every day
[59:12] we fight that war every night with the
[59:14] spirit of christ that is in you god
[59:17] living his life through you and your
[59:18] flesh and the humanity and the carnality
[59:21] of your flesh warring against each other
[59:24] brother adam talked about that uh
[59:26] that old indian chief
[59:28] and uh
[59:29] they said how you doing chief he said
[59:31] well uh it's like a war going on inside
[59:34] me he said it's like a white dog and a
[59:36] black dog and they keep fighting each
[59:38] other
[59:39] and oh
[59:40] and he asked him said well chief said
[59:43] which dog's winning he said well it
[59:44] depends on which one i feed the most
[59:47] amen so if if the white dog is going to
[59:50] win then the white dog is the one that
[59:52] gets fed if the black dog's going to win
[59:55] then the black dogs are the ones that's
[59:56] going to get fed it's that war that
[59:58] constantly continued romans 7 paul
[1:00:00] talked about it that continuous war
[1:00:03] between
[1:00:05] people and law and grace even that
[1:00:08] people get mixed up and confused all the
[1:00:10] time people mix up law and grace
[1:00:12] especially if there's no revelation to
[1:00:14] it but the bottom line of this is that
[1:00:17] when jesus come to this showdown he
[1:00:20] himself in his flesh had to die to
[1:00:23] himself yes amen the only way that the
[1:00:26] will of god could
[1:00:28] could be manifested was that he died to
[1:00:31] his flesh that he died to himself that
[1:00:34] he humbled himself to come under
[1:00:37] subjection to the perfect will that god
[1:00:40] had predestined before the foundation of
[1:00:43] the world he had to die to that
[1:00:46] and look
[1:00:47] the way that he was able to do that look
[1:00:49] at the scripture the way it is read
[1:00:52] jesus came then with peter the sons of
[1:00:54] zebedee to the garden of gethsemane and
[1:00:57] when he came there he he admitted to
[1:01:00] them that his soul was exceeding
[1:01:02] sorrowful unto death
[1:01:04] but he said now carry here so he had
[1:01:07] them there
[1:01:09] but then the bible says that jesus had
[1:01:12] to go further
[1:01:14] and i believe that that would be an
[1:01:16] exhortation for all of us today now
[1:01:19] i i struggled with
[1:01:22] something to title this so just come up
[1:01:24] with something simple
[1:01:26] i believe today
[1:01:28] probably as much or more than any day
[1:01:31] as far as a wholesale group of people
[1:01:34] called the bride
[1:01:35] and the individuality of every human
[1:01:38] that's in that bride
[1:01:40] god's whispering to each one
[1:01:43] come closer amen
[1:01:45] come closer yes i believe christ
[1:01:49] wants us
[1:01:50] drawn closer to him
[1:01:52] i believe this is the hour the time more
[1:01:54] so than any now it's always been that
[1:01:57] way through the annals of time god's
[1:01:59] people and the fellowship that god had
[1:02:01] all through the old testament god
[1:02:03] desired to have fellowship with his
[1:02:05] people but there was a chasm that was
[1:02:07] thrown between god and man and the only
[1:02:10] way to even become acceptable in god's
[1:02:12] eyes was to follow that law
[1:02:15] but when the law was broken by the blood
[1:02:17] of jesus
[1:02:18] and that chasm was bridged by the blood
[1:02:21] of jesus god brought man and god back
[1:02:24] into fellowship again that we can become
[1:02:27] one again that we can have that
[1:02:29] communion again and ever since that time
[1:02:32] the cry has continually been come closer
[1:02:36] yes just come closer you know if you
[1:02:39] want more of god there's more of god for
[1:02:40] you that just proves there's more of god
[1:02:43] for you
[1:02:44] a man calls that deep calling to the
[1:02:45] deep if that deep is calling there's got
[1:02:48] to be a deep out there to respond
[1:02:50] because if the maker did not put
[1:02:52] something to call for it there it
[1:02:54] wouldn't be there to be responded to
[1:02:57] god wouldn't have put it there to begin
[1:02:58] with if there wasn't something out there
[1:03:00] to quench it amen and god's god's got
[1:03:04] that in each believer but i believe the
[1:03:06] cry that god is saying is come a little
[1:03:08] closer with jesus in the scripture jesus
[1:03:12] had to go a little further
[1:03:15] and when he went a little further he
[1:03:17] fell on his face and he prayed god if
[1:03:19] this cup could pass let it pass
[1:03:23] but if not thy will be done
[1:03:26] three times
[1:03:27] three times he did this even to i
[1:03:30] believe luke's the the one that writes
[1:03:33] that his sweat became as drops of blood
[1:03:36] now there's
[1:03:39] a little contention sometime that people
[1:03:41] would say that jesus
[1:03:44] sweated blood out of his pores but i
[1:03:46] don't think that's what the scripture
[1:03:48] says
[1:03:49] the scripture says his sweat became as
[1:03:53] it were
[1:03:55] it didn't say it was
[1:03:57] it said as it were so i believe his
[1:04:00] sweat was dripping off his body as a
[1:04:04] drop of blood wood
[1:04:06] so his sweat
[1:04:07] just like not just beads of sweat like
[1:04:09] most of us get sweaty or little beads of
[1:04:12] sweat but drops of sweat were falling
[1:04:14] off of his body like it would if he were
[1:04:16] bleeding
[1:04:18] the drops were coming off the sweat in
[1:04:21] such agony but jesus himself
[1:04:24] had to get to the place the flesh of the
[1:04:27] man
[1:04:28] jesus the only part of god brother and
[1:04:31] said the only part of god that could die
[1:04:34] was the flesh of christ that flesh was
[1:04:36] in such agony because of the pain that
[1:04:39] he was about to go through
[1:04:41] and he knew the pain he was about to go
[1:04:43] through but yet john tells us that jesus
[1:04:46] said i lay my life down and i pick it up
[1:04:48] again i have power to call 12 legions of
[1:04:52] angels that could take me off of this if
[1:04:55] i wanted to so his death as agony as it
[1:04:59] was came
[1:05:01] willingly
[1:05:02] he did it willingly because he knew what
[1:05:04] the price would be for your soul
[1:05:07] yes the price for your soul was the
[1:05:10] blood of christ and the life that was in
[1:05:12] that blood would come back on the
[1:05:13] worshipper but now if jesus had to do
[1:05:16] that what about us today
[1:05:19] if jesus had to come to that place and
[1:05:21] what about us yes if if jesus had to
[1:05:24] come to where he had to go a little bit
[1:05:26] further he had to go a little bit deeper
[1:05:29] to completely die listen to that now to
[1:05:32] completely die to that flesh jesus
[1:05:36] himself had to go a little bit further
[1:05:39] yes a little bit further three times he
[1:05:41] went in to pray in agony
[1:05:44] three times what about us if he had to
[1:05:46] do that to completely die to that flesh
[1:05:49] what is it for us today amen amen listen
[1:05:52] to this
[1:05:59] in desperations
[1:06:02] our dear lord jesus himself in the
[1:06:05] world's greatest battleground gethsemane
[1:06:09] cried out in despair
[1:06:11] should he take the sins of the world or
[1:06:13] should he just remain on earth with his
[1:06:15] beloved disciples
[1:06:17] what he wanted to do
[1:06:19] but watch his humility now there's where
[1:06:22] we're going to get to it just a minute
[1:06:24] amen because there's no way of dying to
[1:06:26] yourself unless you're willing to become
[1:06:28] humble
[1:06:30] amen and look
[1:06:32] humble
[1:06:34] humility is not something you do
[1:06:38] there's a lot of false humility today
[1:06:41] right that people come up and
[1:06:43] and they act all humble and pious and
[1:06:46] righteous and
[1:06:48] and
[1:06:48] maybe
[1:06:50] present themselves a certain way
[1:06:52] but humility isn't something you do
[1:06:56] humility is something you have
[1:06:59] humility is a is a defining
[1:07:01] characteristic of an individual
[1:07:04] because humility will bring you into all
[1:07:08] of the promises that god has given
[1:07:10] through his word
[1:07:11] the only way to reach any of them is to
[1:07:14] become humble amen amen humility
[1:07:17] humility to dying out to yourself
[1:07:21] jesus himself look brother said watch
[1:07:24] his humility as he humbled himself
[1:07:30] the god of all heaven and earth
[1:07:33] humbling himself
[1:07:35] becoming obedient to death even the
[1:07:38] death of the cross
[1:07:40] my humbling himself
[1:07:43] not my will but thine be done
[1:07:46] humble himself to the word the promised
[1:07:49] word of the of the god of heaven notice
[1:07:52] then he went a little further and if he
[1:07:56] went a little further how much more are
[1:07:58] we
[1:08:00] to go a little further now that's great
[1:08:02] exhortation for us today saints all of
[1:08:04] us
[1:08:05] if he had to go a little further what
[1:08:07] about us
[1:08:08] today doesn't that fall our lot that if
[1:08:12] we really desire
[1:08:14] to be a christian to be a child of god
[1:08:18] if we really desire the promises of
[1:08:20] god's word now look
[1:08:22] all the miracles all the things god's
[1:08:24] all those things in the operations of
[1:08:25] the holy spirit those are all going to
[1:08:27] happen
[1:08:28] because until the spirit of god is
[1:08:30] lifted off these gentiles and goes back
[1:08:33] to the jew the operation that spirit is
[1:08:36] still going to be in effect
[1:08:38] it's always going to be that way until
[1:08:40] it's gone it'll it'll be that way but
[1:08:43] i'm not talking about that
[1:08:45] those are great benefits that we get
[1:08:47] from being a christian and obeying god
[1:08:49] and living for god and being obedient to
[1:08:51] his word but those things are are
[1:08:53] available to anybody if they'll believe
[1:08:55] it
[1:08:57] i'm talking about something that that
[1:08:59] brings you into
[1:09:01] into complete unity and complete
[1:09:04] fellowship and a oneness with christ
[1:09:08] a oneness with christ
[1:09:10] against the spirit they're all fine
[1:09:13] but they're you don't even have to be
[1:09:15] repentant to have a gift of the spirit
[1:09:18] the miracles the blessings all that god
[1:09:20] does all those things those are
[1:09:22] wonderful saints but that we're talking
[1:09:24] about something beyond that we're
[1:09:26] talking about something that brings you
[1:09:28] into a dying of your own self that
[1:09:31] christ can have his fullness and the
[1:09:33] purpose and the will that he had
[1:09:35] predestined for you before the
[1:09:37] foundation of the world yes every one of
[1:09:39] us a union a fellowship a togetherness
[1:09:43] he had to go a little further yes i
[1:09:46] believe we do too yes
[1:09:48] i believe every one of us i believe a
[1:09:50] challenge if we could have
[1:09:52] 2022
[1:09:54] is to get closer to the lord jesus this
[1:09:57] year yes amen god has paid the price he
[1:10:00] has done what he's supposed to do
[1:10:03] just like he had done here in the
[1:10:04] scripture god had done the work
[1:10:07] jesus is the one that had to go forward
[1:10:09] he is the one that had to press in to
[1:10:12] receiving
[1:10:14] death to himself see because christ had
[1:10:17] to die spiritually before he died
[1:10:19] physically
[1:10:20] he had to die to his human spirit first
[1:10:24] before he died in his flesh and laid
[1:10:27] down his life
[1:10:29] we have to do the same thing
[1:10:31] only way to be able to go a little
[1:10:33] further with god is in humility the only
[1:10:36] way that we can even get closer to god
[1:10:38] is to die more to ourselves yes is to
[1:10:41] die more to our will is to die more to
[1:10:44] our desires is to die more to our
[1:10:47] purpose and and what we want
[1:10:50] it's not what we want it's what he wants
[1:10:52] yes
[1:10:53] what do you want lord what is your will
[1:10:56] what do you want me to do if christ had
[1:10:58] to go further what about us
[1:11:01] how much more he says now ought we to go
[1:11:04] a little further
[1:11:06] my mind
[1:11:07] you know one of the worst places a
[1:11:09] person can get to is complacency right
[1:11:12] yes it's one of the worst places a human
[1:11:14] can get to is become so complacent now
[1:11:17] i'm not talking about contentment that's
[1:11:19] different
[1:11:20] being content being complacent are two
[1:11:22] totally different things
[1:11:24] being content with what god has done for
[1:11:26] you and what god has given you and where
[1:11:27] you are blessed that's one thing but
[1:11:30] being a complacent to where oh i i have
[1:11:34] reached that pinnacle i have reached
[1:11:36] that plateau i don't need to go any
[1:11:39] further i don't need to i'm completely
[1:11:42] dead to newton bennett
[1:11:44] then you know what you're done with god
[1:11:46] or let's just say god's done with you
[1:11:48] because you'll never go any further with
[1:11:50] christ until you are willing to give a
[1:11:52] little more yes until you're willing to
[1:11:54] die a little more jesus was at the end
[1:11:57] here
[1:11:58] he didn't just give a little more he
[1:12:00] gave everything
[1:12:02] he gave all he had he freely laid down
[1:12:04] his life and gave everything he had
[1:12:06] and he did it no fault of his own
[1:12:09] because of us
[1:12:11] now how much more should we do that
[1:12:13] see notice the scripture says here in
[1:12:16] luke that he prayed earnestly oh brother
[1:12:18] sister if jesus had to pray earnestly
[1:12:21] how much more have we got to pray
[1:12:24] earnestly
[1:12:26] god help us if christ the god of heaven
[1:12:29] made flesh had to pray earnestly how
[1:12:31] much more are we sinners saved by his
[1:12:33] grace to pray earnestly
[1:12:36] if the decision thrown the son of god
[1:12:39] into despair
[1:12:40] what will it do to you and i
[1:12:43] yeah desperately he says we cry yes cry
[1:12:47] to the lord
[1:12:48] desperately
[1:12:50] what does it say in isaiah
[1:12:52] god sent forth the marking angel that
[1:12:54] said mark those who are signing and
[1:12:57] crying the abominations and desolations
[1:12:59] done in the land
[1:13:01] how many in our hearts i'm not whether
[1:13:03] you share tear or not but in your spirit
[1:13:05] in your heart are crying and agonizing
[1:13:09] over the sin in this world today
[1:13:12] don't let it make us cynical friends
[1:13:14] don't don't let it make us uh uh
[1:13:19] to where we just well they just get what
[1:13:21] they deserve
[1:13:23] if we got what we deserved every one of
[1:13:25] us would burn in hell
[1:13:28] that shouldn't be our desire
[1:13:30] our desire our cry oh god if there's
[1:13:33] some way lord
[1:13:35] that you could just move on
[1:13:37] this person these people
[1:13:40] this world this country
[1:13:42] oh my
[1:13:43] we know what the fate of it is we know
[1:13:45] what the end of it is we know at the end
[1:13:46] of the bible we know what the word says
[1:13:48] but that doesn't change the desire that
[1:13:50] we have
[1:13:52] jesus christ went to calvary died shed
[1:13:54] his blood gave his life because he knew
[1:13:56] that there would be a handful of people
[1:13:58] through the annals of time that would
[1:13:59] receive him accept him and take that
[1:14:01] blood and him as their salvation yes he
[1:14:04] knew that he knew the far majority of
[1:14:07] the of the world would not receive it
[1:14:09] would reject him spit on him make fun of
[1:14:12] him and have nothing to do with him
[1:14:14] billions of people reject him
[1:14:19] but he did it anyway right
[1:14:21] i've made this statement
[1:14:23] often and i'll make it again
[1:14:26] if i was the only human
[1:14:28] ever walk this ball of dirt
[1:14:31] that would have received it and accepted
[1:14:33] it he would have done it anyway
[1:14:37] if you
[1:14:38] were the only person
[1:14:40] to walk this ball of dirt that would
[1:14:43] have accepted jesus christ as your
[1:14:45] savior and received him
[1:14:48] and the
[1:14:49] perpetuation of your sins he would have
[1:14:51] went to calvary just for you yes
[1:14:55] one person out of billions
[1:14:58] he would have still done
[1:15:01] that's how much you mean to him
[1:15:03] that's how much i mean to him he would
[1:15:05] have done it anyway
[1:15:07] but he had to do it in humility he had
[1:15:09] to die to himself
[1:15:11] the only way he could be able to rise
[1:15:14] back up from that was to die to himself
[1:15:20] the lower
[1:15:22] and the more humble you get
[1:15:25] the closer you get to god
[1:15:27] humility now not false humility right
[1:15:30] not someone that that acts
[1:15:33] you know
[1:15:34] i just i mean actual humility
[1:15:38] one of the biggest misconceptions that
[1:15:41] people have
[1:15:43] the struggle between pride and humility
[1:15:46] i actually heard a brother one time
[1:15:48] preach on bride pride
[1:15:51] i guess that's okay it's not something i
[1:15:53] would preach
[1:15:55] because the war with pride and humility
[1:15:58] i understand the premise of it i
[1:16:00] understand the point of of being able to
[1:16:03] stand your ground and take your place
[1:16:05] and know who you are yes
[1:16:07] but if it doesn't if that does not make
[1:16:10] you more humble
[1:16:11] then you've got the wrong spirit yes
[1:16:14] because no matter what god does for you
[1:16:17] and no matter what god reveals to you no
[1:16:19] matter what god blessings shine upon
[1:16:22] your life no matter what miracles
[1:16:24] perform and what healings god does if
[1:16:27] you don't take those things and make
[1:16:29] your and it make you more humble
[1:16:32] then you've got the wrong spirit
[1:16:34] amen i'm sorry friend but i've seen
[1:16:37] people that they take it and they walk
[1:16:39] around with it like a badge of pride
[1:16:42] like i am better than you friend if it
[1:16:44] not for the grace of god i'm walking the
[1:16:46] streets today
[1:16:49] amen amen
[1:16:52] if not for the grace of god yes
[1:16:54] that's why although
[1:16:57] i'm not happy about all the homelessness
[1:17:00] i don't blame them
[1:17:03] some of them probably do it i know some
[1:17:05] of them do it on purpose they don't want
[1:17:07] the responsibility but a lot of them
[1:17:09] there's
[1:17:11] these people should be taken care of and
[1:17:13] helped
[1:17:14] not just handouts but a way to get their
[1:17:16] life back where they can live a life
[1:17:20] but if it weren't for the grace of god
[1:17:22] where would any of us be that's right
[1:17:23] yes
[1:17:24] so we can't put anybody else down
[1:17:27] because it's not our doing anyway it's
[1:17:29] his ammo it's what he's done for us it's
[1:17:32] where he's brought us but if we can
[1:17:34] humble ourselves the lower you get
[1:17:38] the more humble you get not prideful
[1:17:40] humble that you get
[1:17:42] now there's there's nothing wrong for
[1:17:43] standing with what you believe
[1:17:46] there's nothing wrong with standing
[1:17:47] forth and speaking the truth
[1:17:50] there's nothing wrong with that people
[1:17:51] may think that you're prideful with it
[1:17:53] but you're not prideful you're just
[1:17:54] speaking the word
[1:17:57] people thought that about christ
[1:17:59] when jesus come forth even with pilate
[1:18:01] look at the conversation we spoke last
[1:18:03] week or read last week jesus had with
[1:18:06] pilate you would think jesus was the
[1:18:08] most smug prideful person there is
[1:18:11] oh you'd have no power if my father
[1:18:13] didn't give it to you
[1:18:15] does that not sound practical
[1:18:18] you're denigrating
[1:18:20] probably the most powerful man on the
[1:18:22] earth at that time by saying you
[1:18:23] wouldn't have any power off it wasn't
[1:18:25] for my father to give it to you right
[1:18:27] i mean
[1:18:28] but that's the truth
[1:18:30] jesus didn't say it with pride he said
[1:18:33] it with humility
[1:18:35] he expressed it with humility and the
[1:18:37] same thing is
[1:18:38] that we have that we do today
[1:18:40] it's got to be with humility
[1:18:42] humility what is humility
[1:18:45] i gotta i want to
[1:18:47] read a couple of scriptures
[1:18:48] philippians chapter two
[1:18:52] i honestly had
[1:18:54] a lot of scriptures
[1:18:56] and i did not want to
[1:19:00] and this wasn't even one of them
[1:19:02] but
[1:19:03] when i was studying through it and when
[1:19:05] the lord took me a certain direction
[1:19:07] this scripture came to my mind amen
[1:19:12] philippians chapter 2
[1:19:14] verse 1.
[1:19:16] let's read it carefully closely now
[1:19:18] philippians 2 1
[1:19:21] if there be therefore
[1:19:23] any consolation or consoling
[1:19:27] comfort
[1:19:29] in christ
[1:19:31] if any comfort of love
[1:19:34] amen because love's what comforts
[1:19:36] you can't comfort somebody unless you
[1:19:37] love them
[1:19:39] not really
[1:19:40] you might can
[1:19:42] express a falsehood for a little while
[1:19:44] make them feel a little bit better but
[1:19:45] they won't be comforted
[1:19:47] not true comfort
[1:19:48] of love if any fellowship of the spirit
[1:19:52] if any bowels and mercies now we know
[1:19:55] that just basically means the tender
[1:19:56] mercies
[1:19:58] your tender
[1:20:00] it's like a yearning
[1:20:02] from the depths of your soul
[1:20:04] that that bowels when it goes into the
[1:20:06] bowel it's like a it's like a depth of
[1:20:08] love not just filial love not just a
[1:20:11] surface uh love
[1:20:13] but a depth love a love that comes from
[1:20:16] the inside not a flesh love right
[1:20:21] bowels and mercies amen now remember
[1:20:24] jesus said blessed are the merciful
[1:20:27] for they shall obtain mercy great told
[1:20:30] you this before you want mercy
[1:20:33] i want it
[1:20:34] i need it yes well if i want it i'm
[1:20:37] going to be willing to give it right
[1:20:38] yeah if you're willing to give it that's
[1:20:40] humility you can't give
[1:20:42] mercies to someone unless you humble
[1:20:44] yourself to that person right
[1:20:47] amen you understand
[1:20:49] you must humble yourself to that person
[1:20:51] if you to be willing to give them mercy
[1:20:54] in their life you must humble yourself
[1:20:56] to that person
[1:20:58] you must humble before them
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:02] fulfill ye my joy
[1:21:04] that ye be like-minded having the same
[1:21:07] love being of one accord of one mind
[1:21:10] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:21:14] vainglory
[1:21:15] but in lowliness of mind listen now
[1:21:19] in lowliness what is that humility
[1:21:22] in humility in humility and loneliness
[1:21:25] of mind let each esteem other better
[1:21:29] than themselves
[1:21:31] let each esteem other better than
[1:21:34] themselves
[1:21:35] now i'll say this for a few moments
[1:21:38] brother branham is gone
[1:21:42] and
[1:21:43] so i can't pin this rose on him
[1:21:46] but
[1:21:47] i've met in my life
[1:21:49] in ministry
[1:21:53] i i used to have a count
[1:21:55] dozens i'll just say dozens
[1:21:57] dozens maybe even a hundred
[1:21:59] people that personally knew brother
[1:22:02] branham
[1:22:03] personally knew him
[1:22:05] now i want you to understand something
[1:22:07] the only way that you can influence
[1:22:10] somebody else's life and we are
[1:22:12] christians
[1:22:13] and we want to
[1:22:15] express our lives as christians
[1:22:17] we want other people to become
[1:22:19] christians and so we express ourselves
[1:22:22] to those people so that they might want
[1:22:25] what we have
[1:22:27] to become christians themselves
[1:22:29] so they escape the
[1:22:32] the judgment of hell
[1:22:34] so that maybe even if they're just a
[1:22:36] worker outside the city they're not in
[1:22:38] hell
[1:22:39] something
[1:22:41] something to help somebody
[1:22:43] to help them in some way but friend
[1:22:45] you'll never be able to help somebody
[1:22:48] unless you humble yourselves to that
[1:22:50] person yes i don't care who they are
[1:22:52] i don't care street walker homeless
[1:22:54] person drug addict gambler
[1:22:57] i don't care who they are
[1:22:59] unless you're willing to humble
[1:23:00] yourselves to that person you can't help
[1:23:02] them
[1:23:04] and you're not going to help that person
[1:23:06] with your doctrine yes right
[1:23:09] those people that you try to witness to
[1:23:11] and speak to and talk to they don't care
[1:23:13] about your doctrine

[1:23:18] true
[1:23:19] born-again holy ghost-filled christian

[1:24:10] they're all over the place people are
[1:24:12] looking for another church

[1:24:17] looking for an experience
[1:24:19] they're looking for a way to get to
[1:24:21] jesus christ and you are that way and
[1:24:24] it's not through your doctrines through
[1:24:26] the humility of christ in your life
[1:24:28] speaking to that person and humbling
[1:24:30] yourselves before them to show them the
[1:24:33] real living jesus christ
[1:24:36] amen that's the only way you'll get to
[1:24:37] them
[1:24:38] that's the only way they'll see it and
[1:24:40] you may be
[1:24:42] the only christ that that person will
[1:24:45] ever see
[1:24:47] that's right you may be the only one
[1:24:50] why
[1:24:51] if that's the case
[1:24:53] then god help me
[1:24:55] that when i meet that person
[1:24:57] i present myself in a way
[1:24:59] that i humble myself to them to show
[1:25:02] jesus christ to that person all that i
[1:25:05] possibly can to help them
[1:25:07] since i've been putting up that panel at
[1:25:09] mary's
[1:25:11] thursday night and went by uh uh friday
[1:25:14] and
[1:25:15] people walk down the street all the time
[1:25:17] people couple people come up to the
[1:25:19] house
[1:25:20] one guy was there the other day and
[1:25:22] i i started talking to him
[1:25:25] and he asked me he said
[1:25:29] because the work was being done by
[1:25:32] part of the work was being done by
[1:25:34] sister priscilla's sister's husband
[1:25:36] mario some of you may know him you
[1:25:39] probably know marianne her sister she
[1:25:41] came to church here last time we had
[1:25:42] communion
[1:25:44] her husband was out there working
[1:25:46] and the guy came and he wanted some work
[1:25:48] done and i said well
[1:25:50] his wife's sister goes to our church
[1:25:53] and we got to talk and he said so you
[1:25:55] were the pastor i said yes sir i am
[1:25:57] he said and you worked for a living i
[1:25:58] said got to pay the bills
[1:26:00] i said yeah you better believe i do i'll
[1:26:02] work my fingers bloody to take care of
[1:26:05] my family in this church
[1:26:07] i'll do everything i can to keep it
[1:26:08] going amen
[1:26:10] and he said he was so used to
[1:26:14] those
[1:26:15] prosperity ministers talked about this
[1:26:18] guy he put him in a certain way that
[1:26:22] almost like he was his pastor but he
[1:26:24] wasn't happy about it
[1:26:26] prosperity minister he had this great
[1:26:28] jet i said well i don't know about
[1:26:30] planes you got to talk to my son about
[1:26:31] that he's the pilot
[1:26:33] and he was a pilot for delta but
[1:26:36] but you just
[1:26:37] my point is you try to reach a person
[1:26:40] where they are and humble yourself to
[1:26:42] that person and speak to them in a way
[1:26:44] that you might reflect christ
[1:26:47] that they might come to recognize hey
[1:26:49] there's something real here feel the
[1:26:51] spirit of god on them
[1:26:53] that gets harder and harder now because
[1:26:55] the closer you get to somebody the
[1:26:56] further they back up
[1:26:58] no no get away
[1:27:01] it's hard to get the closer you get to a
[1:27:02] person the more they can feel that
[1:27:04] spirit from you the more they feel that
[1:27:06] presence the spirit of god
[1:27:08] that draws people in you know
[1:27:10] sure it does that draws people in
[1:27:12] because there's that that humanity that
[1:27:14] was created by god that wants to go back
[1:27:17] to that amen that devil's got them all
[1:27:19] in his cages and just like an animal at
[1:27:22] the zoo he's got all these people in
[1:27:23] cages but you know god
[1:27:26] all of us came from him
[1:27:29] there's a soul in there that's worth 10
[1:27:31] million worlds
[1:27:32] that soul's calling and wanting to go
[1:27:35] back there
[1:27:36] but we but that but that humility that
[1:27:40] brings us to that place see
[1:27:42] paul said here
[1:27:45] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:27:47] vain glory but in lowliness
[1:27:50] in humility
[1:27:52] let each esteem other better than
[1:27:55] themselves
[1:27:56] now it didn't say for me to do
[1:27:59] humble myself before my congregation
[1:28:02] or before my brothers and sisters or for
[1:28:05] you before each other it said esteem
[1:28:08] other better than themselves well what
[1:28:11] is other
[1:28:12] another human yes
[1:28:15] humanity
[1:28:16] a person
[1:28:18] esteem better than themselves remember
[1:28:21] when you're living your life for others
[1:28:23] you're staring heaven in the face
[1:28:25] now we do it with wisdom obviously of
[1:28:27] the lord but when you're living your
[1:28:29] life for others you're staring heaven in
[1:28:31] the face
[1:28:33] praise the lord
[1:28:34] now some people misconstrue that and
[1:28:37] think that that means that every
[1:28:39] homeless person down every corner
[1:28:41] they're supposed to give them a ten
[1:28:42] dollar bill does not mean that right
[1:28:45] if the spirit moves you to do it you
[1:28:47] better do it right right the spirit
[1:28:50] moves you to give you leftovers from the
[1:28:51] restaurant to them do it if the spirit
[1:28:54] moves you to give him a bottle of water
[1:28:56] do it yes
[1:28:57] amen because it's god's calling it's
[1:29:00] god's leading not mine
[1:29:03] i'm saying she'd go broke giving twenty
[1:29:05] dollar bill to every person on the
[1:29:06] street down there today yeah
[1:29:08] it doesn't mean that
[1:29:10] but when you humble yourselves to that
[1:29:12] person
[1:29:14] and you humble yourselves to each other
[1:29:16] and esteem each other better than
[1:29:18] themselves remember the story oh that
[1:29:22] i was getting to a point a minute ago
[1:29:24] and i'm gonna say that before i get to
[1:29:26] this
[1:29:27] i've known dozens maybe a hundred people
[1:29:31] that personally knew brother brown
[1:29:34] thank you for bringing back back lord
[1:29:36] that knew him personally that spent time
[1:29:38] with him even like brother pat
[1:29:41] i'm not talking about people that were
[1:29:42] just in a service i'm talking about
[1:29:44] people that knew him personally that
[1:29:47] talked to him and sat down with him or
[1:29:48] had a had a interview with him or
[1:29:50] something
[1:29:53] probably dozens if not maybe 100 people
[1:29:56] and all kind of doctrines
[1:29:59] all kind of thoughts
[1:30:02] one
[1:30:03] believed he was god
[1:30:06] one others baptized in his name
[1:30:09] these people
[1:30:10] they preached this doctrine these group
[1:30:13] over here they preached this
[1:30:15] and and all the i just say a hundred all
[1:30:17] the hundred
[1:30:19] all all different thoughts that they
[1:30:21] have
[1:30:22] all different doctrines
[1:30:24] are all derived from a message
[1:30:27] from brother browner's ministry
[1:30:29] from this message they all derived from
[1:30:31] that
[1:30:34] but the one thing i could disseminate
[1:30:36] from every single person
[1:30:39] and you'll probably hear the marbles is
[1:30:41] brother pat nods his head
[1:30:44] from every person that i've talked to
[1:30:49] the one common denominator that they
[1:30:51] gave me about brother brown
[1:30:53] was his humility
[1:30:56] even when he walked out on stage
[1:31:00] with his usually bible tucked under his
[1:31:02] arm
[1:31:03] when he walked out on the platform when
[1:31:04] he walked out wherever they were
[1:31:08] the one common denominator
[1:31:11] of all the doctrines all the everything
[1:31:13] up they they try to spread everything to
[1:31:15] me tell me this brother brandon this and
[1:31:17] brother brown and all those things and
[1:31:19] all that
[1:31:20] that's all fine and good that's all
[1:31:22] their parts to play
[1:31:24] but the one thing
[1:31:26] that every one of them said
[1:31:28] was the most humble man they had ever
[1:31:30] met anybody
[1:31:32] that was brother branham's defining
[1:31:34] characteristic
[1:31:36] his humility
[1:31:38] friend that needs to be our defining
[1:31:40] characteristic
[1:31:41] it was jesus defining characteristic i
[1:31:44] preached the first time i preached to
[1:31:45] tucson tabernacle we were visiting from
[1:31:48] from florida 1998
[1:31:52] december convention 98
[1:31:55] i just turned
[1:31:56] 33. i sit in there
[1:32:01] down from the down from the platform
[1:32:03] from the pulpit
[1:32:05] say where sister matisse is
[1:32:08] you know if we were there like five six
[1:32:11] rows back on the end
[1:32:13] and the lord spoke to me and said that
[1:32:15] he's gonna it was it was the meetings
[1:32:17] for brother where brother green said you
[1:32:19] brothers be ready because i'm just gonna
[1:32:22] call you out of the audience
[1:32:24] and he did that night he called uh ron
[1:32:26] peterson
[1:32:28] he says to just be ready because i'm not
[1:32:30] i'm not i didn't announce who's going to
[1:32:32] be ministering
[1:32:33] and every night is going to be somebody
[1:32:34] different or whoever i feel led to do it
[1:32:36] lord spoke to me and said he's going to
[1:32:38] call you tomorrow night
[1:32:40] and i you talk about shaking in your
[1:32:42] boots
[1:32:44] i just turned 33 and first time really
[1:32:46] i've been at a tabernacle before but
[1:32:48] first time with any i guess you'd say
[1:32:50] prominence or
[1:32:52] got to meet brother green
[1:32:54] you talk about there's hundreds of
[1:32:57] people there
[1:32:58] i never spoke before that many people
[1:33:00] before god said he's going to call you
[1:33:01] tomorrow night
[1:33:03] i went back to the hotel room and i was
[1:33:05] up i was sitting in chair my mom was
[1:33:06] trying to we spent the room together and
[1:33:08] she was trying to sleep and
[1:33:11] and the lord just gave me scripture
[1:33:12] after scripture this is the first
[1:33:14] scripture he gave me
[1:33:16] the two most influential men in my life
[1:33:19] jesus christ number one and brother
[1:33:21] brown
[1:33:23] yes sir sure enough the next night
[1:33:25] brother perry green got up there and he
[1:33:26] talked about this young man from florida
[1:33:28] and he said i'm going to have him come
[1:33:30] and speak
[1:33:31] i grabbed my bible i got up there i said
[1:33:33] i knew he was going to do that because
[1:33:35] god told me that last night he was going
[1:33:36] to call him
[1:33:38] and this is the scripture the lord give
[1:33:40] me
[1:33:41] because i began to take the things that
[1:33:44] we know that that we read in the
[1:33:46] scripture about jesus
[1:33:48] everything he did was for somebody else
[1:33:50] yes everything
[1:33:52] jesus didn't do anything for himself
[1:33:54] right and then he he put food in his
[1:33:57] body and drink to keep his body alive
[1:33:59] but he kept his body alive to help other
[1:34:02] people yes so even his food his drape
[1:34:04] weren't selfish
[1:34:06] he humbled himself he humbled himself to
[1:34:08] humanity
[1:34:10] not just to his disciples but to his
[1:34:12] humanity to everyone
[1:34:15] and
[1:34:16] i started thinking about so many of the
[1:34:18] things i had heard and stories i had
[1:34:20] been told
[1:34:22] and the one story that stood out to me
[1:34:24] because it was at that meeting with
[1:34:25] brother greene remember the dark story
[1:34:29] you tucson tabernacle people remember
[1:34:30] the dark story brother green used to
[1:34:32] tell yeah
[1:34:33] he said i'd get up and
[1:34:35] uh uh play darts and he said uh
[1:34:39] he he watched brother branham and
[1:34:41] brother branham he hit a bull's eye
[1:34:43] every single dart
[1:34:44] hit hidden bull's-eye every dart
[1:34:47] and brother green sat there and he
[1:34:49] watched
[1:34:50] so he got up and he challenged brother
[1:34:51] branham he says you want to play a game
[1:34:53] he said yeah come on let's play
[1:34:55] and he said when i threw a four brother
[1:34:58] brown threw a five
[1:34:59] or
[1:35:00] however darks go is it high or low i
[1:35:02] can't remember
[1:35:04] high
[1:35:05] high score wins
[1:35:07] no
[1:35:08] low score wins no thanks i forget anyway
[1:35:12] every everyone that brother green threw
[1:35:14] brother branham threw one just worse
[1:35:17] than that one whatever it is
[1:35:19] threw one just worse
[1:35:21] one time brother green said i took a
[1:35:23] dart and i just slung it off the board
[1:35:25] all together and he said brother branham
[1:35:27] did the same thing
[1:35:32] he said now i don't get it brother
[1:35:33] branham
[1:35:34] he said i sat there and i watched you
[1:35:37] and i watched you play darts over and
[1:35:38] over and every single dart went the
[1:35:40] when you're playing me
[1:35:43] you can't win
[1:35:45] he said brother green i know what i can
[1:35:47] do
[1:35:47] i don't need to prove it to you or
[1:35:49] anybody else
[1:35:50] he said if there's any joy in winning
[1:35:52] why don't i let you
[1:35:54] enjoy friend that just
[1:35:57] i mean
[1:35:58] you think well that's a story no that
[1:36:00] was the man's defining characteristic
[1:36:03] he meant that he did that from his heart
[1:36:06] purposefully escaping other better than
[1:36:09] himself yes
[1:36:11] oh my
[1:36:13] dares i say because i've liked it my
[1:36:15] entire life but sports has ruined this
[1:36:18] country probably as much as anything has
[1:36:20] right because the competition of being
[1:36:23] driven to beat the next person
[1:36:25] well that's
[1:36:26] that is
[1:36:28] absolutely contrary
[1:36:31] from the scripture and how we're
[1:36:33] supposed to act
[1:36:35] there's nothing wrong with winning i i
[1:36:38] played media
[1:36:39] a
[1:36:40] volleyball game and
[1:36:42] landed head first in the concrete to get
[1:36:44] a ball
[1:36:48] but brother branham said if there's any
[1:36:49] joy in winning well i'll let you enjoy
[1:36:51] it
[1:36:52] amen
[1:36:54] well see that's why people look
[1:36:56] sometimes and they're like
[1:36:57] you know it doesn't bother you to lose
[1:36:59] not a bit
[1:37:01] so that's not healthy why not
[1:37:05] i i don't need to win everything
[1:37:07] i don't have to be the first person all
[1:37:09] the time
[1:37:10] i don't need to be the best at something
[1:37:12] and even if i was what difference does
[1:37:14] it make if i have to show it off to you
[1:37:17] well that's not humility
[1:37:20] and i'm not telling you if we ever have
[1:37:22] a supporter you go play volleyball to
[1:37:24] throw the game
[1:37:26] and then play
[1:37:27] but
[1:37:28] the defining characteristic is the
[1:37:30] bottom line is the humility yes
[1:37:33] esteeming other better than themselves
[1:37:36] and that's the point esteeming that
[1:37:38] person that's the way christ lived his
[1:37:40] life when brother roger was here that
[1:37:42] thought hit me and i i actually tears
[1:37:45] come down my face i don't think he saw
[1:37:47] it
[1:37:48] i started crying to think about what he
[1:37:51] did in his life
[1:37:53] how he lived his life
[1:37:56] he did not live his life for himself
[1:37:59] right
[1:38:00] he did not live his life for his wife or
[1:38:02] his children he lived his life for the
[1:38:05] people yes
[1:38:07] and that's what a that's what a servant
[1:38:09] does
[1:38:11] that's exactly what a servant does the
[1:38:12] best they can
[1:38:14] none of us are perfect we try to strive
[1:38:16] to the best we can but that humility is
[1:38:19] what brings it about it's what brings it
[1:38:22] to that forefront friend i believe
[1:38:24] that's why the bible talks about if
[1:38:25] somebody
[1:38:26] if you give to somebody give not expect
[1:38:28] expecting get back
[1:38:30] yes amen don't expect to get it back and
[1:38:33] if not that's fine
[1:38:35] but if you give just give give from your
[1:38:37] heart give freely give willingly give us
[1:38:40] unto the lord right we're going to give
[1:38:42] it to the lord and say hey god you know
[1:38:43] that money i gave you the other day i
[1:38:44] want it back
[1:38:48] no
[1:38:50] you give it that's why the bible says
[1:38:51] that you give it and don't expect that
[1:38:53] way if it never comes back you don't
[1:38:55] worry about it right
[1:38:57] there's no problem
[1:38:59] there's there's no
[1:39:00] contention there there's no wedge for
[1:39:03] this for the devil to get in because
[1:39:05] it's gone you forgot about it don't
[1:39:06] worry about it god will take care of you
[1:39:08] right
[1:39:09] yes god will take care of you and that's
[1:39:11] all that really matters
[1:39:13] not that five ten twenty hundred dollars
[1:39:15] no god will take care and supply your
[1:39:18] needs according to his riches
[1:39:21] so give it unto him that's just an
[1:39:23] example okay
[1:39:25] that's just an example of that esteeming
[1:39:28] others better than themselves i'm
[1:39:30] talking about
[1:39:32] god help us me
[1:39:35] the point of my life
[1:39:37] in getting closer to god you don't get
[1:39:40] closer by your doctrines
[1:39:43] your doctors don't bring you closer to
[1:39:44] god
[1:39:46] how you get closer to god is to die more
[1:39:49] to yourself
[1:39:51] that's how you get closer to god because
[1:39:54] that's the buffer that was the buffer in
[1:39:56] the garden of eden that was the buffer
[1:39:58] through the entire old testament as the
[1:40:01] buffer that humanity has had is this old
[1:40:03] body of clay that separates and brings a
[1:40:06] division between god and man if this
[1:40:09] body wasn't here friend we'd be in the
[1:40:10] presence of the lord
[1:40:14] we are anyway you know what i'm saying
[1:40:17] this body
[1:40:19] so when this
[1:40:21] how many places does the scripture talk
[1:40:23] about how many times does paul talk
[1:40:25] about mortifying the deeds of the flesh
[1:40:27] what does that mean that means dying
[1:40:30] killing yourself now paul himself said i
[1:40:32] die daily
[1:40:34] well what is death death is humility
[1:40:37] it's dying to christ it's dying to the
[1:40:39] word it's dying to but it's not just
[1:40:42] dying to him and his will is dying to
[1:40:44] other people
[1:40:45] it's humbling yourselves before others
[1:40:48] esteeming other better than that better
[1:40:51] than yourself right amen
[1:40:54] and what does it the mind of christ let
[1:40:56] this mind be in you which is in christ
[1:40:58] jesus look not every man on his own
[1:41:00] things but every man also on the things
[1:41:03] of others there's things that shape all
[1:41:05] of our lives
[1:41:07] there's things that mold our lives
[1:41:08] there's things that that that brings our
[1:41:11] lives together
[1:41:14] and in everyone
[1:41:16] in putting on the mind of christ
[1:41:19] and humbling himself to that point then
[1:41:21] you've got a book of acts all over again
[1:41:27] praise the lord
[1:41:28] not just not just us not just this
[1:41:30] church
[1:41:31] the body yes this city this state this
[1:41:34] country the world
[1:41:36] god's bride internationally
[1:41:39] we're all one
[1:41:40] we're all one together in him
[1:41:43] identified masterpiece of god he said i
[1:41:45] think it's when we can get together with
[1:41:47] this type of fellowship it does
[1:41:50] something to us
[1:41:51] and that just that just reminded me of
[1:41:53] the sometimes we have the dinner and the
[1:41:55] fellowship together
[1:41:56] i love that so much
[1:41:58] amen well that's kind of what he's
[1:42:01] saying here this type of fellowship it
[1:42:03] does something to us that's why i love
[1:42:05] sundays
[1:42:06] i love coming together or being in
[1:42:08] church here like this
[1:42:10] that draws us closer to each other
[1:42:13] and as we get closer to each other we
[1:42:16] also get closer to god
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:20] how to get closer to god getting closer
[1:42:22] to one another how do you get closer to
[1:42:24] one another humble yourselves before
[1:42:26] each other die to yourself
[1:42:29] let the mind of christ be in you esteem
[1:42:31] other better than yourself amen amen
[1:42:35] praise the lord getting closer to god
[1:42:38] getting closer to each other
[1:42:39] brings us closer to god
[1:42:43] for jesus said in so much that you've
[1:42:44] done to the least of these my little
[1:42:46] ones you've done it done to me
[1:42:49] he said i got a little boy joseph
[1:42:50] sitting here billy's sitting here two
[1:42:52] dollars sitting back there white
[1:42:54] he said if anybody had something that
[1:42:56] you want to do real nice i would rather
[1:42:58] you do it to my children to my family
[1:43:00] than do it to me
[1:43:02] and so i feel maybe as a parent
[1:43:04] and he's the source of
[1:43:06] parenthood i think that that's the way
[1:43:08] god feels we serve him
[1:43:12] we serve him
[1:43:14] as we serve each other
[1:43:17] that's how we serve god
[1:43:19] how to do that
[1:43:21] humble yourself
[1:43:24] humility
[1:43:26] lowering yourself
[1:43:28] amen before others
[1:43:30] submitting yourselves to one another
[1:43:32] amen not necessarily not in the doctrine
[1:43:35] so much
[1:43:36] amen but but in the spirit
[1:43:39] colossians
[1:43:40] i'm going to close here just a minute
[1:43:41] colossians chapter 3
[1:43:44] verse 1
[1:43:45] if you then be risen with christ seek
[1:43:47] those things which are above
[1:43:50] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:43:52] of god set your affection on things
[1:43:54] above not on the things on the earth
[1:43:56] for if ye are dead for ye are dead and
[1:44:00] your life is hid with christ in god
[1:44:04] praise the lord you are dead
[1:44:07] and your life is hid in christ or with
[1:44:11] christ in god
[1:44:13] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:44:15] then shall we he also appear with him in
[1:44:18] glory amen amen
[1:44:20] again paul said i die daily
[1:44:25] we die daily to ourselves
[1:44:28] james
[1:44:29] chapter four
[1:44:31] james 4 1 for whence come wars
[1:44:34] fighting's among you listen now
[1:44:36] the opposite the antithesis the opposite
[1:44:39] of this is
[1:44:41] whence comes wars fightings among you
[1:44:44] come they not hints even of your lusts
[1:44:47] that war in your members
[1:44:50] well that's not humility
[1:44:52] so why is there fight
[1:44:55] why is there aggression
[1:44:58] pride
[1:45:00] arrogance lusts
[1:45:03] the actual opposite of humility
[1:45:06] you see it going on in the world today
[1:45:10] russia put would have never gone in
[1:45:13] to ukraine if he didn't feel like he
[1:45:14] could have taken them
[1:45:16] but i think honestly and i'll just say
[1:45:19] this honestly
[1:45:20] i don't think the man cares
[1:45:24] i think we're so close to the end this
[1:45:27] man does not care right i don't think he
[1:45:31] cares as long as he's hit out in some
[1:45:32] bunker somewhere he doesn't care about
[1:45:35] his own people
[1:45:38] brother branham said it could be
[1:45:40] a crazy man one day walking by push that
[1:45:43] button right and we have safeguards in
[1:45:45] this country to prevent that but never
[1:45:48] said it would happen here but he's
[1:45:49] talked about that in russia yeah
[1:45:52] i don't know what safeguards they have
[1:45:53] you have to have two or three people
[1:45:54] with cards and
[1:45:56] and combinations and stuff for them to
[1:45:58] all do everything in continuity together
[1:46:00] one person can't push a nuclear but
[1:46:03] not in this country you're not supposed
[1:46:04] to right from what i know anyway
[1:46:06] but i don't know it's that way in russia
[1:46:08] but brother graham talked about that
[1:46:09] pushing that one crazy person somebody
[1:46:12] pushing that button
[1:46:14] i don't know
[1:46:16] but remember
[1:46:17] before one bomb can ever drop
[1:46:21] we're going to be gone
[1:46:23] bride will be gone saints but i don't
[1:46:25] think he cares it's just a lust that he
[1:46:27] has it's just the desire of the flesh
[1:46:29] that he has
[1:46:30] see he wants to go back to stalin and
[1:46:32] khrushchev and all this
[1:46:33] but those days are passed see there was
[1:46:36] a time and an anointing at that time
[1:46:38] where there was supposed to be war and
[1:46:40] commotion
[1:46:42] and a driving of the jews back to their
[1:46:44] homeland in the revelation seven the
[1:46:47] whole the angels stopped it
[1:46:50] world war ii stopped and they don't know
[1:46:52] why nobody well we know why because the
[1:46:56] scripture says so god said stop yes the
[1:46:59] angels went down there and stopped it
[1:47:00] and stopped just like that
[1:47:03] that was that time this is not the time
[1:47:05] for that
[1:47:07] the world is going to be overcome next
[1:47:10] by the beast and the beast doesn't come
[1:47:12] in through war and fighting right the
[1:47:15] beast comes in through peace and love
[1:47:17] and harmony yes
[1:47:19] the humility and you see the whole
[1:47:21] country now the whole country the world
[1:47:23] the world's not thirsting for war the
[1:47:26] world is thirsting for peace
[1:47:29] unity
[1:47:30] let's come together
[1:47:32] let's do this together in harmony that's
[1:47:34] the anointing today and that's the
[1:47:36] anointing that's going to bring the
[1:47:38] priest to his
[1:47:39] to his place
[1:47:43] that's what's that's what's going on now
[1:47:46] don't forget though
[1:47:48] what's going on behind the scenes yes we
[1:47:51] know what's going on behind the scenes
[1:47:54] the christian is being pushed out the
[1:47:56] real true christian the fanatical
[1:47:59] christian
[1:48:00] you know anybody that follows the letter
[1:48:02] of their of their holy writ is
[1:48:05] considered fanatical
[1:48:09] most uh
[1:48:10] muslims
[1:48:12] hindus
[1:48:16] the al-qaeda and
[1:48:18] and isis and those they kill the infidel
[1:48:21] you know why because that's what their
[1:48:23] holy word tells them to do right they
[1:48:26] follow that to the t others come along
[1:48:28] and melt it down and say oh no that's
[1:48:30] not what it means that's not what it
[1:48:31] says yes it is
[1:48:34] people get on the mormons because men
[1:48:36] have four and five six wives
[1:48:39] now why logically i have no idea
[1:48:42] they're just crazy
[1:48:45] i i
[1:48:46] that
[1:48:47] just logically blows my mind
[1:48:49] five or six lord help i'm thankful for
[1:48:52] the one i've got and i'm gonna keep her
[1:48:54] and that's it
[1:48:56] but they do that why because that's what
[1:48:58] their holy writ says and people call
[1:49:01] them fanatical because they follow the
[1:49:03] letter of their holy word
[1:49:07] we're called the same thing friend
[1:49:09] we're called fanatical holy roller
[1:49:12] whatever tag they want to put on it
[1:49:14] today everybody's got a label for
[1:49:16] something they don't agree with right
[1:49:17] you know if you don't agree with a
[1:49:19] certain thing or you know that it's
[1:49:21] against the word of god or something
[1:49:22] well they're going to label you
[1:49:23] something
[1:49:24] you know
[1:49:25] there's labels all over the place so
[1:49:27] they got a label for it
[1:49:29] but you're considered fanatical because
[1:49:32] we follow this word exactly like it's
[1:49:34] written
[1:49:35] if the bible says that moses staff was
[1:49:39] turned to a snake friend that stealth
[1:49:41] was turned to a slave amen
[1:49:44] if the bible says janice and james did
[1:49:46] the same thing by their magician's trick
[1:49:49] that's exactly what happened
[1:49:51] if moses stayed then ate up the other
[1:49:54] two snakes that is exactly what happened
[1:49:59] and we believe that
[1:50:02] now there's a lot of people out in the
[1:50:03] world today they don't oh this was a
[1:50:06] metaphor oh this was an allegory oh it
[1:50:08] wasn't meant to be just like that and
[1:50:10] they melt it all down and preach away
[1:50:12] the truth of god's word and just become
[1:50:14] a bunch of jellyfish renegades
[1:50:18] sorry but that's just the truth yeah
[1:50:20] amen
[1:50:22] but god's word is the truth god's word
[1:50:24] will never fail god's word doesn't lie
[1:50:26] and if it says it it's true
[1:50:29] it's right it's real
[1:50:31] that's why we follow it
[1:50:33] because what's in us identifies to
[1:50:35] what's on these pages
[1:50:37] which is christ and he is the word
[1:50:40] praise the lord and we humble ourselves
[1:50:43] through it
[1:50:44] thy will be done lord
[1:50:47] amen thy will be done
[1:50:51] there's wars
[1:50:53] fightings
[1:50:55] let me finish james four and then i'll
[1:50:56] close
[1:51:01] even of your lust that war in your
[1:51:03] members ye lust and have not ye kill and
[1:51:06] desire to have and cannot obtain
[1:51:09] you fight in war yet ye have not because
[1:51:12] he asked not
[1:51:13] ye ask and receive not because ye ask
[1:51:16] amiss that ye may consume it upon your
[1:51:19] lusts
[1:51:21] ye adulterers and adulterers know ye not
[1:51:23] that the friendship of the world is
[1:51:25] enmity with god
[1:51:28] friendship with the world is enmity with
[1:51:31] god
[1:51:33] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[1:51:35] the world is the enemy of god i'm not
[1:51:37] saying don't have friends that's not
[1:51:39] what it's saying right that's saying
[1:51:40] that you coming into and becoming light
[1:51:43] in the world that's what it's talking
[1:51:44] about amen living living like the world
[1:51:49] do you think that the scripture saith in
[1:51:51] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us
[1:51:53] lusteth to envy
[1:51:56] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[1:51:58] saith god resists that the proud giveth
[1:52:00] grace and to the humble yes submit
[1:52:02] yourselves therefore to god resist the
[1:52:05] devil and he will flee from you
[1:52:08] draw nigh to god
[1:52:10] praise the lord
[1:52:11] draw nigh to god and he will draw mine
[1:52:14] to
[1:52:14] you cleanse your hands you sinners and
[1:52:17] purify your heart she double minded be
[1:52:19] afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[1:52:22] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[1:52:23] joy to heavenness humble yourselves in
[1:52:26] the sight of the lord and he shall lift
[1:52:28] you up yes amen
[1:52:31] he shall lift you up
[1:52:33] i'm not looking to be lifted up by man
[1:52:36] i'd rather god take me by the hand the
[1:52:38] man pat me on the back but how many
[1:52:40] times do people live their lives for the
[1:52:42] accolades for the for the power
[1:52:45] for for the the popularity for the money
[1:52:48] for the padding on the back
[1:52:51] that's not what we're here for friends
[1:52:53] that's not what god put us on this earth
[1:52:55] to do
[1:52:56] let each esteem other better than
[1:52:59] themselves and humility oh yes it is
[1:53:02] absolutely contrary to everything the
[1:53:05] world teaches us from childhood
[1:53:09] but god has given us the way of escape
[1:53:12] and that is from the world that is his
[1:53:14] word amen amen one more humble thyself
[1:53:17] he said
[1:53:18] uh he talked about methodist church
[1:53:19] listen how he talks about the methodist
[1:53:21] church here july 1963
[1:53:25] the organization of the methodist church
[1:53:26] which is a fine bunch of people in that
[1:53:29] methodist church don't you never think
[1:53:32] they're not they are
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:36] sometimes i wonder if we don't think
[1:53:38] that about the other message churches
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:49] god help us brother graham said
[1:53:51] those
[1:53:52] people there are good people and don't
[1:53:55] ever think they're not right right amen
[1:53:58] we should think the same thing friend
[1:54:00] yes
[1:54:02] sometimes it seems like though that
[1:54:04] even message church to message churches
[1:54:06] don't feel that way about each other
[1:54:08] right much less about the methodist or
[1:54:10] baptist or catholic or whatever they are
[1:54:13] friend i've met a lot of catholics in my
[1:54:15] life and i've met a lot a lot of really
[1:54:18] nice good catholic people yes
[1:54:21] good people
[1:54:22] absolutely
[1:54:24] there are five bunch of people in that
[1:54:26] catholic church there are fine bunch in

[1:54:37] crosses their path that may be the only
[1:54:39] christ they see
[1:54:41] they'd be the only light they ever get
[1:54:43] in their entire life right
[1:54:45] that one glimpse it's coming from you
[1:54:48] yes
[1:54:49] help us lord amen
[1:54:52] you just keep flashing that light in
[1:54:54] humility and sweetness not in your
[1:54:56] doctrines

[1:54:59] prophet in humility and sweetness
[1:55:03] let's all grow closer to god by humbling
[1:55:07] ourselves amen
[1:55:09] amen let's stand

[1:55:37] and carnality and everything that it
[1:55:39] tells you to
[1:55:45] the bible even says it's better to
[1:55:48] suffer
[1:55:49] loss and fault take fall
[1:55:52] than to fight over it
[1:55:54] i'm paraphrasing of course
[1:55:57] it's better to suffer loss
[1:55:59] and be defrauded

[1:56:09] that's good if you're right then what
[1:56:10] are you fussing about you're trying to
[1:56:12] convince yourself or the person you're
[1:56:13] fighting
[1:56:15] sometimes i think people are trying to
[1:56:16] convince themselves they're right first
[1:56:19] because he gets so dramatic and so mad
[1:56:22] oh it's it's my way or not and then
[1:56:24] that's you go back to the anointing of
[1:56:26] the world today everybody's got to be
[1:56:28] right
