[0:00] introduced at niacia by the catholic
[0:03] church and trying to split god into
[0:05] three pieces and say three different
[0:08] gods and three personalities you can't
[0:10] have three personnel they say he's one
[0:12] god with three personalities you can't
[0:13] have a personality without having a
[0:15] person right amen so it's so they
[0:18] basically chop them into three pieces
[0:20] but he's one god
[0:22] and that that understanding and
[0:24] revelation was to be brought forth in
[0:27] this last day in this eagle age
[0:29] and the anointing of the flying eagle
[0:32] was supposed to be a prophetic age which
[0:35] son of man is prophet
[0:37] a prophetic age to reach the heights to
[0:40] be able to see the things that have been
[0:42] hid down through the ages and
[0:44] generations was to be made known and
[0:46] manifested revealed in this last day so
[0:49] we know that not only was satan revealed
[0:52] not only was satan exposed to the church
[0:55] ages but we also know that jesus christ
[0:58] was revealed to his bride and who he is
[1:01] yes amen now the revealing of that son
[1:03] of man we know has happened today so
[1:07] that revealing brings us to the point of
[1:10] now the day that we live yes now brother
[1:13] branham's been gone off the scene almost
[1:15] 56 years yeah and i've told you how it's
[1:18] easy for me to figure that out because
[1:20] he passed away right after i was born
[1:22] and i know i'm about to turn 56 so i
[1:24] know he died he's been gone almost 56
[1:26] years so it's easy for me but 56 years
[1:30] so in other words i don't keep track of
[1:32] brother from how long he's been gone i
[1:34] just remember because of that fact but
[1:37] that puts us in position now 56 years
[1:41] since the revealing of the son of man
[1:43] well and then that's the case in what
[1:45] day are we living well jesus said
[1:49] again two very divine defining
[1:52] characteristics
[1:54] of the days that jesus
[1:57] referred to that was going to be like
[2:00] today
[2:01] now the first one of them we know as he
[2:03] said was in the days of noah
[2:06] okay in the days of noah now we know
[2:08] about noah we know about the ark and the
[2:11] 120 years building the ark and and the
[2:14] tribulation and the rain and the flood
[2:16] and we know we know all those things but
[2:19] look what jesus put down as as those uh
[2:23] characteristics that was going on in the
[2:25] andaluvian world before the flood
[2:28] very
[2:29] defining characteristics that jesus
[2:31] considered that jesus brought profoundly
[2:34] as something that was that was contrary
[2:37] to him contrary to
[2:40] god the word
[2:43] and that was they did eat
[2:46] they drank
[2:47] they married wives and they were given
[2:50] in marriage
[2:51] those are the four things rally is three
[2:53] things because one is encompasses the
[2:57] two but the one is eat and drink well i
[3:00] think well what's so unusual about
[3:02] eating and drinking don't we do that to
[3:04] survive but that's not the point that
[3:06] jesus was making because the point that
[3:09] he was making here was the eating part
[3:12] was the gluttonous part they weren't
[3:14] just eating to sustain life they were
[3:16] eating to substance they were eating in
[3:19] a gluttonous manner
[3:21] and the drink is not just an iced tea or
[3:23] an ice water it was uh a drunkenness
[3:28] giving themselves over to wine into
[3:31] strong drink and becoming drunkards
[3:34] or as the scripture refers to as wine
[3:37] bibbers
[3:38] so when they were talking about eating
[3:40] and drinking he was referring to the
[3:43] overindulgence of of gluttonous eating
[3:46] and and becoming drunk and becoming a
[3:49] wine biver
[3:51] and two of course we know of very uh
[3:53] stark uh identifications of things that
[3:56] are 100 percent against god and his word
[4:00] amen
[4:01] so those are two things that he gave as
[4:04] he talked about no the other was
[4:06] they married wives they were given in
[4:08] marriage well you think well i married a
[4:10] wife
[4:11] uh
[4:13] her dad brought her down and give her to
[4:14] me in marriage but if you go back and
[4:17] you see what brother branham said about
[4:18] it he talked about as it was in the days
[4:21] of noah where they were marrying a given
[4:23] in marriage and marriage and giving in
[4:24] marriage and over and over and divorced
[4:26] and marriage and divorce over and over
[4:28] and that's exactly what uh that even
[4:31] that jesus was talking about in the days
[4:34] of noah
[4:35] it became to where marriage and divorce
[4:38] was irrelevant to people
[4:40] there was no sanctity to it anymore
[4:43] a lot of people in into marriage vows
[4:46] and they have no sanctity they have no
[4:48] uh no
[4:50] conception of the fact of what they're
[4:52] doing and binding themselves together as
[4:56] one flesh forever
[4:59] when i counsel people and there's those
[5:01] that are here that i've counseled that
[5:03] they'll tell you
[5:04] i i tell them when you go into a
[5:07] marriage and you say i do you do it with
[5:10] the understanding that the word divorce
[5:12] does not exist right
[5:16] now i say that understands people in
[5:18] here spend divorce okay but i tell them
[5:20] you go into this
[5:23] with the understanding that the word
[5:25] divorce does not exist
[5:29] the concept of being divorced is not it
[5:34] null and void doesn't exist
[5:37] if they're coming to this together
[5:39] to understand that this is supposed to
[5:41] be a union that is supposed to be
[5:44] something that lasts
[5:46] your whole life
[5:47] join together in one flesh
[5:50] but
[5:51] but my but my point then being is like
[5:54] it is today look how it is today
[5:57] it doesn't mean anything to people
[5:59] anymore
[6:00] marriage and marriage vows mean so
[6:03] little anymore to people they'll just
[6:06] say well i'm going in and thought like
[6:08] it's not getting me another one
[6:10] people enter into agreements like that
[6:12] with the thought process well i just if
[6:15] this just doesn't suit me then i'll go
[6:16] get me another one
[6:18] now i know things happen that are
[6:20] unforeseen and divorce does take place
[6:22] but you don't go into it looking for
[6:25] that
[6:25] right but there are people today that
[6:27] believe that marriage is so uh
[6:30] is not an institution
[6:32] right it's just something that you do
[6:35] let's go to dinner oh great yeah let's
[6:38] go to dinner oh let's get married okay
[6:41] let's have a picnic yeah that sounds
[6:43] great uh let's get a job or let's go to
[6:46] work or this whatever well let's just
[6:48] get married it's just it's just the
[6:50] thing people do there's no sanctity to
[6:52] it
[6:53] and i believe that's the part that jesus
[6:55] was talking about they entered into
[6:57] these things and and of course marriage
[6:59] today has got to the place to where uh
[7:02] not even half of them survive
[7:05] it probably way less less than half
[7:07] anymore that actually survive even if
[7:09] they've gone 10 15 20 years sometimes
[7:11] you hear about people 25 30 years
[7:13] getting divorced yeah i'm thinking
[7:15] you're 65 who'll have you
[7:18] you know yeah but
[7:20] like my wife says there's somebody for
[7:22] everybody uh and we've come to find that
[7:25] to be true in a lot of cases
[7:27] but
[7:28] somebody for everybody i mean i got hurt
[7:30] so that proves that point but
[7:33] the sanctity of it i think is the issue
[7:35] that jesus is talking about and that
[7:37] brother branham was talking about right
[7:39] the sanctity of marriage it doesn't it
[7:41] it is an inner it wasn't entered into at
[7:44] that time
[7:45] it would with the sanctity that it
[7:47] should have been yeah uh
[7:50] and today i believe today in a lot of
[7:52] ways in a lot of places a lot of people
[7:54] it's not entered into today it just
[7:57] becomes a big celebration you hear
[7:59] sometimes the people they spend fifty
[8:01] sixty thousand dollars on a wedding in
[8:03] three weeks they're divorced
[8:04] they're separated right because it's not
[8:07] just not entered into with that with
[8:09] that reverence with that humility and
[8:12] with that love see
[8:14] the the love should begin in a marriage
[8:16] the love and the marriage should begin
[8:18] with the love of each individual with
[8:20] god
[8:22] if the love of each that individual is
[8:24] for god first then their union is going
[8:26] to survive
[8:28] because they because they come together
[8:30] in that love of god
[8:32] together with the love of each other
[8:34] but it's the love of god that binds them
[8:37] amen amen and that's and
[8:40] that divining characteristic that that
[8:43] jesus gave for us to understand in the
[8:46] days of noah yeah the flood and all
[8:48] those things happen but the wickedness
[8:51] that he was talking about see here
[8:53] brother man says the world's falling
[8:55] apart again
[8:57] he said these episodes has been on the
[8:59] earth since the days of noah
[9:01] we find out when god had noah the
[9:03] prophet of righteousness going forth
[9:05] with his message
[9:07] there was an episode of immorality in
[9:10] that day as the bible says
[9:12] eating drinking marrying giving in
[9:15] marriage
[9:16] we find out gluttonous and immorality
[9:20] and so forth taken place in that day
[9:24] and then the world fell apart because
[9:26] the people rejected the message of god
[9:28] for that day
[9:29] noah was a prophet anointed if god sent
[9:31] of god with a message from god he gave
[9:34] the people a warning before the judgment
[9:36] came and they snickered and laughed and
[9:38] made fun of it
[9:40] scoff the whole world system fell apart
[9:42] in that day and they drowned beneath the
[9:45] seas that's right why because they
[9:47] rejected the message of the hour right i
[9:50] mean brother random even talked about uh
[9:52] and i'm sure it's a hundred times worse
[9:54] some things of course we're sheltered
[9:55] from because we don't involve ourselves
[9:58] with that part of the world
[10:00] but he talked about uh
[10:02] those times where they would have
[10:04] couples all together and and and all of
[10:06] them would throw their keys and a hat
[10:08] and he said and the men would come up or
[10:10] the women would come up whoever it was
[10:12] and they'd just grab a key and whoever
[10:14] keys they pulled out that's the person
[10:15] they stayed with that night
[10:18] just the immorality friend
[10:21] and that wasn't in noah's day although
[10:23] it was the noah's day
[10:25] that he was talking about that for his
[10:27] day
[10:28] well if it was like that 60 years ago
[10:30] what do you think it's like now
[10:33] i have no idea because again i don't
[10:35] acquaint myself in those circles i have
[10:37] no idea what those people do but it's
[10:40] i'm sure in the increase of the sin it's
[10:42] got to be worse than it was then
[10:45] oh my
[10:46] but that's the one
[10:48] the thing that jesus was referring to
[10:50] brother branham was referring to
[10:52] gluttonous immorality taken place in
[10:54] that day because they rejected the word
[10:57] amen very much we swear we see it
[11:00] swirling around us today friend now who
[11:02] is the second one the second one we know
[11:04] is that likewise also as it was in the
[11:06] days of life
[11:08] the days of lot now we know a lot
[11:10] we know about the things that happen in
[11:12] sodom and gomorrah and lot and abraham
[11:15] rescuing him and
[11:16] of course lot lot already had it in his
[11:18] heart to go become a part of the car
[11:21] become a part of the city
[11:23] uh
[11:24] la had a chance to go anywhere he wanted
[11:26] to
[11:27] when abraham and lot's herdsmen began to
[11:29] fight will be amongst one another and
[11:31] abraham came to the place they realized
[11:33] there had to be a separation abraham
[11:36] told lot look lot
[11:38] we got country all around us you go
[11:39] wherever you want to go
[11:41] lot looks out he sees the big city of
[11:43] sodom and he says i believe i'll go down
[11:45] there
[11:46] amen who's going to choose that so it
[11:48] was already in his heart to do
[11:50] but but lot then went down to sodom
[11:53] purposely to live there brother adam
[11:55] called him the bear of the city
[11:58] but lot was there in sodom we know those
[12:01] things now
[12:03] the first two characteristics that he
[12:05] gives about law are the same
[12:07] characteristics he gave about noah
[12:10] so i would imagine those two
[12:12] characteristics are very important
[12:14] because he began noah with eating and
[12:17] drinking and he begins lot with eating
[12:19] and drinking right
[12:21] same thing
[12:22] the eating of gluttonous the drinking of
[12:25] of of drunkenness
[12:27] wine bidding amen becoming a drunkard so
[12:31] those situations still fit with noah and
[12:34] with lot the eating and drinking but now
[12:37] there's a difference here
[12:39] he says
[12:40] they did eat they drank they bought they
[12:42] sold they planted they build it he
[12:44] doesn't say anything about marriage and
[12:46] divorce
[12:48] not with lot
[12:50] why do you think that maybe maybe
[12:53] that jesus didn't refer to the marriage
[12:56] and divorce in lot state like he did in
[12:58] noah's day
[13:00] now not that it was a new spirit
[13:04] but the prevalence of that spirit had
[13:06] become so strong in lot's day
[13:10] that god refers to it he doesn't talk
[13:12] about the marriage and divorce
[13:15] but if you notice the one thing when you
[13:17] think about sodom and gomorrah and the
[13:19] moralities of the of the men and women
[13:22] in that city that day what's the number
[13:24] one thing you think about
[13:27] homosexuality that's right well there
[13:29] was no marriage in divorce because they
[13:31] weren't marrying women
[13:34] they were just coming together in such
[13:35] an immoral way that that that's the
[13:39] characteristic that god defined for it
[13:43] when when lot when or when the two
[13:46] angels went down to lot when those two
[13:49] male angels went down the lot the men
[13:52] came in and they wanted to know those
[13:54] men
[13:55] the angels of god
[13:58] michael and gabriel brother branham
[14:00] called them at one point
[14:02] he wanted to have they wanted to have
[14:04] relation with those men
[14:05] and and lot's like no no no leave these
[14:08] are my guests leave them alone i'll send
[14:11] you my daughters and they said no
[14:14] we don't want the women we want the men
[14:19] now friend if that's not what we're
[14:20] talking about today i don't know what we
[14:21] are talking about right i don't know
[14:23] what we see around in the world today if
[14:25] we don't see that as a whole cell
[14:27] even
[14:28] acceptance right
[14:31] of that spirit today i don't know what
[14:33] there is that's right
[14:35] even an acceptance by what we call
[14:38] or define ourselves as a christian
[14:41] nation of course less and less people
[14:43] are defining it at that yeah i'm one of
[14:46] them
[14:47] as we got to that point yeah are we a
[14:50] christian nation anymore
[14:52] i mean when we think about the things
[14:54] that's being defined down through there
[14:56] and the the acceptance of that kind of
[14:59] immorality the acceptance of the
[15:01] drinking uh you you look at any more and
[15:05] you see churchgoers and ministers and
[15:08] and people that proclaim to be
[15:10] christians wearing crosses and all this
[15:12] and you can't hardly watch a newscast
[15:14] but they don't talk about drinking a
[15:16] beer right or going out to the bar
[15:19] or or something to that effect got a
[15:21] cross talking about god and jesus and
[15:24] they're this great dividing christians
[15:26] and they're going out afterwards to drop
[15:28] a few
[15:29] right
[15:30] that's the defining characteristic thing
[15:33] if that it is exactly now as it was then
[15:36] it now
[15:38] it's grown since if you think it was
[15:40] anything like that when brother brannan
[15:42] was here
[15:43] oh man
[15:44] if you considered or called yourself a
[15:46] christian i don't mean a catholic or a
[15:48] denomination had gone off or something
[15:50] but i mean you really considered
[15:52] yourself a christian that was something
[15:54] that wasn't even in the conversation
[15:57] that that did that just did not happen
[16:00] if you were a godly child of god and you
[16:02] loved the lord and you claimed christ as
[16:04] your savior that
[16:06] drinking was not even considered right
[16:09] now understand
[16:11] spirits are still spirits
[16:14] and we're still humans
[16:16] and those spirits will pull on you
[16:18] amen that's why you need to be we all
[16:20] need to stay fortified as much as we can
[16:23] behind the blood
[16:25] stay under that blood stay under christ
[16:28] stay in his word
[16:30] and let those spirits say we're trying
[16:32] to drive them on you bounce off and go
[16:34] somewhere you said i'm a child of god
[16:37] satan i don't do that right i don't live
[16:39] like that
[16:41] but the eating drinking and look the
[16:43] homosexuality there
[16:45] that that one driving force i want to
[16:47] read this quote because i want to get
[16:49] into the next part with some other
[16:51] scripture because as i began to look at
[16:53] that yesterday i didn't think a whole
[16:55] lot about it all these times i've read
[16:57] the bible
[16:58] and and and i've studied it and it just
[17:00] was never something that struck me you
[17:03] know usually in the message you go to
[17:05] revelation or you go to saint luke 17 30
[17:08] even thus as in days and son of man uh
[17:10] it'll be when the son of man is revealed
[17:13] that's that that scripture that we think
[17:15] of
[17:16] brother branham his ministry and and
[17:18] christ coming and revealing himself
[17:21] showing himself to uh to a group of
[17:23] people for this last day we had to have
[17:25] that saints to go in a rapture
[17:27] that had to be known that had to be
[17:29] revealed before there could ever be a
[17:30] rapture how do you think of the group of
[17:32] people would ever have a body change to
[17:34] go into rapture if we didn't even know
[17:36] who jesus christ was
[17:38] have a truth of the godhead of christ
[17:40] and his word
[17:41] how how could that ever have happened so
[17:43] it had to be but it was going to be at
[17:45] the end time
[17:46] the end time because only at the end
[17:48] time is there to be an alive and remain
[17:51] group
[17:54] all the other ages they all went by the
[17:56] way of the grave
[17:57] this last day is the only day the only
[17:59] group that's going to have an alive and
[18:01] remain group no other age had that
[18:03] so this last day very important
[18:06] amen the faith that it takes
[18:09] to realize where we're standing
[18:11] in the days it was in the son of man it
[18:14] is today look what brother brown said
[18:16] here in this day the scripture is
[18:17] fulfilled but when i started looking at
[18:19] that now uh uh
[18:21] it led me to several other scriptures
[18:23] things i want to i want to bring to you
[18:25] now this day this scripture is fulfilled
[18:29] he said how about in our priesthood
[18:32] he said tonight i got a piece of paper
[18:34] over in los angeles california of where
[18:36] a bunch of clergymen baptist
[18:38] presbyterian ministers
[18:40] brought a bunch of homosexuals in and
[18:43] practiced homosexual saying they were
[18:45] trying to win them to god oh gosh
[18:50] that's like sliding up to a drunkard in
[18:52] a bar and say hit me bartender and try
[18:54] to witness to the guy sitting next to
[18:56] you
[18:58] oh do you know
[18:59] do you know jesus
[19:02] two or three drinks later
[19:04] i i i thought i knew him oh i see him
[19:06] now
[19:07] well yeah cause you're three sheep ten
[19:09] sheets to the wind
[19:11] you're drunk as a skunk now that's why
[19:12] you're seeing all kinds of stuff now

[19:18] things i want to see
[19:20] a a a a vision or something i want to
[19:23] see god who you know you keep taking
[19:25] that stuff you're going to see all kinds
[19:27] of things things you might not want to
[19:29] see too yes but that's like saying it's
[19:32] like going up next to a drunk and start
[19:34] drinking with them and try to win them
[19:35] to christ
[19:36] oh well come on in all you're doing is
[19:38] inviting that spirit into your life
[19:41] right
[19:42] in spite inviting that spirit onto your
[19:44] flesh and the weakness of your flesh
[19:46] what do you think is going to happen you
[19:48] lay an adult a better the dog that's got
[19:51] fleas you're going to come out with
[19:52] fleas
[19:53] that's just the way it is
[19:56] he said trying to win them
[19:58] to to christ try to win them to god he
[20:01] said when that's one of the curses of
[20:03] the hour
[20:05] the law he says the law even arrested
[20:08] those men
[20:09] and now where are we at our whole system
[20:12] has rotted out from under us
[20:14] i've seen the increase in homosexual
[20:16] across the united states has increased
[20:18] 20 to 30
[20:20] over last year think of that man living
[20:23] with man just exactly like they did in
[20:26] sodom right well if it was that way in
[20:29] 1965 what is it today
[20:31] right right
[20:32] my friend think about where we're at
[20:35] what day are we living today
[20:38] i mean
[20:39] unless you're just in that
[20:41] and around all that and a part of that
[20:44] you don't it's hard to understand the
[20:46] depth of it i mean just think about this
[20:49] for a moment
[20:50] i believe every one of us as adults
[20:53] understand how corrupt and how immoral
[20:56] the government has been for years
[20:58] years all my life probably and more
[21:02] but now as it comes to this end time
[21:05] as it's
[21:07] waning itself closer to the time of our
[21:10] departure
[21:12] it's becoming more and more prevalent
[21:14] it's becoming more and more under the
[21:17] cover as you will
[21:19] back in the day it used to be uh that
[21:21] that they were just immoral and
[21:23] unethical and they were just a bunch of
[21:25] croats but they kind of did it to where
[21:27] the public didn't know anything about it
[21:30] they kind of did it the world only a few
[21:32] people would know or something would
[21:33] leak out here or something would leak
[21:35] out there and then they would come up
[21:37] and dismiss it as putting you down as a
[21:39] conspiracy theorist
[21:42] oh
[21:42] that's nothing to it they're just
[21:44] conspiracy theorists and then everybody
[21:46] changed that person
[21:48] when the truth of it is under the cover
[21:50] is absolutely true
[21:52] corrupt rotten to the core yes right but
[21:55] now they don't care right
[21:57] now they absolutely don't care
[22:00] i mean look
[22:04] and i i don't guess we're streaming this
[22:06] yes it's streaming
[22:08] i'll say it anyway the president of the
[22:10] united states will get up and lie right
[22:13] square to the american people and you
[22:15] know for an absolute fact that the man's
[22:18] lying
[22:19] and they don't care right
[22:22] they do not care right
[22:25] all the corruption and all the things
[22:27] that's coming out from under the cover
[22:29] they put it right in your face and they
[22:31] do not care right that's right and one
[22:34] of the big reasons they don't care is
[22:35] they know that most of the media will
[22:37] not even touch it right yeah they won't
[22:39] cover it they won't expose it they won't
[22:41] tell what the real truth really is the
[22:44] underlying theme of it friend
[22:46] it's it
[22:48] it's that rotten of a day our whole
[22:50] system brother adam said whole system
[22:53] from underneath us is rotten
[22:55] yep
[22:56] whole system is rotten man
[22:58] amen
[22:59] increase i didn't finish this quote here
[23:02] let me finish it he said just exactly
[23:04] like they did in sodom
[23:06] increase in crime
[23:09] how about today
[23:10] juvenile delinquency what hour are we
[23:13] living
[23:14] this day this word of prophecy is being
[23:17] fulfilled
[23:18] 60
[23:19] uh 56 years ago over 56 years ago
[23:23] because that was february
[23:24] now where are we at today if that's the
[23:27] way it was then look at the it's brother
[23:29] branham talked about increase of crime
[23:31] what would brother brown say today with
[23:33] the increase of crime
[23:35] when a woman would just come in with a
[23:36] hat and a scarf and a and a mask on and
[23:39] just steal a woman's purse right out of
[23:40] her buggy and just walk out with it
[23:44] i've seen
[23:45] videos of people in california now they
[23:48] can steal up to a thousand dollars and
[23:50] walk out the door and you can't do a
[23:52] thing about it
[23:55] the law is on their side
[23:57] on the side of the criminal
[24:00] they got videos of people packing up
[24:02] bags of stuff and just walking out the
[24:04] door with it yeah what do you think he'd
[24:06] say today is he treats a crime in 1965
[24:09] what do you think he'd say today with
[24:10] those things going on
[24:13] juvenile delinquency who's doing most of
[24:16] this
[24:18] juveniles
[24:20] some adults mostly young people
[24:23] stealing they don't care because they
[24:25] know that nobody else cares
[24:27] they know that nobody's going to do
[24:29] anything about it they know that the
[24:31] police aren't going to get there the one
[24:32] part of this story you don't know baby
[24:35] is that zach and tabitha called the
[24:37] police pinged her phone knew exactly
[24:40] where her phone was set in the starbucks
[24:42] it's at speedway uh
[24:45] and six waiting for four hours for the
[24:48] police to show up
[24:50] they never showed up five times
[24:52] five hours
[24:54] and the police never showed up
[24:57] a woman a policewoman drove around to
[24:59] get her a cup of coffee
[25:02] they're sitting there waiting for the
[25:04] police and a policewoman comes around to
[25:06] give her a cup of coffee
[25:09] so they ran out the door and flagged her
[25:11] down and said hey we need a police
[25:12] officer they finally went to the house
[25:15] and of course all she got her phone back
[25:17] but that's all they would it meant to
[25:19] they just found the phone in the parking
[25:20] lot somewhere you know so that's all
[25:22] they could admit to that's all they
[25:23] would admit to her give her back she got
[25:25] her phone back
[25:26] five hours they waited
[25:28] you know why i don't and i'm not i'm not
[25:30] faulting the police
[25:32] i'm faulting all the other stuff that
[25:34] goes on around here that just all that
[25:36] just gets pushed under the rug now yes
[25:40] it used to be when i drove when i was
[25:41] first started to drive a car if you
[25:43] didn't come to an absolute complete stop
[25:45] at a stop sign the police saw you you
[25:47] got a ticket
[25:49] i don't care if he is turning right or
[25:51] not
[25:54] they will give you a ticket right
[25:56] nowadays people don't must they hardly
[25:58] sometimes don't even break they just hit
[26:00] the gas when they turn right
[26:02] or or or even when the light turns red
[26:05] i've said it a traffic light yeah and
[26:08] and my light turned green and there's a
[26:11] three to five second delay between
[26:13] lights my light turned green and three
[26:16] more cars would go in front of us yeah
[26:19] oh yeah
[26:20] how red do you think their light had to
[26:22] be
[26:23] but it doesn't matter
[26:25] nobody does anything about it
[26:27] increase a crime it's on the rampage
[26:30] friend
[26:31] it pays to make sure you protect
[26:33] yourself watch out amen
[26:35] and
[26:37] uh and take care of yourself amen but
[26:40] that increase your crime is today it's
[26:42] where we're living right it's the days
[26:44] of sodom
[26:46] now i want to delve into this last part
[26:48] the days of luck eating and drinking
[26:52] we we know the homosexual but now let's
[26:54] look at the next part of this
[26:56] he said they eat they drank they bought
[26:59] they sold they planted they built it i
[27:00] thought well what is the big deal about
[27:02] that
[27:03] i buy and sell
[27:04] stuff i've had a house built i've
[27:08] planted trees
[27:10] but the reference here is so far removed
[27:14] from a simple
[27:16] act of life that we do
[27:18] that this that he was giving
[27:21] was something that was
[27:24] not just simply
[27:26] an act of living your life
[27:30] it this is a symbolic reference
[27:34] to
[27:35] people
[27:36] that were living their lives as if
[27:39] though there was no god right
[27:41] and that's the point that he's making
[27:43] here these people were living their
[27:45] lives
[27:46] as if though there was no god
[27:49] now
[27:50] that's the way a lot of people live
[27:51] their lives today now they'll tell you
[27:53] they believe in god
[27:55] they'll go to church
[27:57] they'll tell you they believe in jesus
[27:59] they'll tell you that they're saved but
[28:02] they live their lives like there is no
[28:04] god
[28:07] if they believed that there was a god
[28:09] then they would obey god's word right
[28:12] yes
[28:13] and that's the difference
[28:14] they lived their lives as though there
[28:16] is no god and the greater portion of the
[28:19] population of this world today
[28:21] live their lives as though there is no
[28:23] god
[28:24] and that there is no god working
[28:27] watching
[28:28] they devoted their entire lives to
[28:32] earthly things
[28:33] yes
[28:34] that's the way they live their lives
[28:37] they live their lives in devotion to
[28:39] earthly things buying selling building a
[28:42] planting building they live there their
[28:45] whole lives is consumed with the vanity
[28:48] of what they themselves can do what they
[28:51] themselves can accomplish who they
[28:53] themselves are rather than the fact that
[28:56] we are nothing but sheep
[28:58] led by the shepherd
[29:00] that our thoughts opinions feelings mean
[29:03] absolutely nothing outside of christ in
[29:06] his word amen
[29:08] but they're a group of people
[29:10] and i say group but the reference and
[29:12] lot to today
[29:14] the majority not just a group
[29:18] are living their lives
[29:20] as if though there is no god
[29:22] they live their lives as though god's
[29:24] not watching them that god knows
[29:26] everything that's going on
[29:28] makes me wonder about this santa claus
[29:30] business when they started that years
[29:32] ago the catholic church
[29:34] and
[29:35] the naughty list
[29:37] have you been good or bad
[29:39] the the what is however that christmas
[29:41] song they sing is it being good or bad
[29:44] to to try to keep kids in line oh the
[29:47] santa's watching santa's not watching
[29:49] nothing because there is no santa right
[29:52] but there's a god watching you there is
[29:54] an all-seeing eye that's watching you
[29:56] but people live as though that doesn't
[29:58] matter they don't care
[30:00] there's no god there they say that they
[30:02] believe him but they live their lives as
[30:04] though he's not right
[30:06] amen now let's go over to uh
[30:09] um
[30:11] the scripture here
[30:14] there's a couple of scriptures i want to
[30:16] read
[30:18] before we follow up with that in in
[30:21] genesis chapter 6
[30:29] the scripture in genesis chapter 6 i'm
[30:32] just going to read one most of genesis 6
[30:37] gives us the
[30:39] the foundation that we need in what
[30:41] jesus was saying as it was in the days
[30:43] of noah
[30:45] but verse 5
[30:47] in my opinion mostly sums it up
[30:51] genesis 6 5
[30:52] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[30:56] was great in the earth
[30:58] and that every
[30:59] imagination of the thoughts
[31:03] of his heart were only evil continually
[31:06] right
[31:08] the thought the imaginate look at look
[31:10] at this now not his words
[31:13] it's time to talk about his actions of
[31:14] course
[31:15] that that's just a result of what you're
[31:17] thinking
[31:19] the imagination
[31:21] of the thoughts
[31:23] not just your thoughts
[31:25] but the imagination of the thoughts were
[31:28] in their of their heart were evil
[31:30] continually no wonder god said if if
[31:34] every man's heart is imagination is evil
[31:37] continually no wonder he wiped it away
[31:39] amen
[31:40] it even repented god that he made man
[31:44] but he saw in noah man that walked with
[31:46] god that we talked about last week right
[31:48] a man that walked with god and god found
[31:50] grace and as god
[31:52] as noah began to preach the word his
[31:54] family believed and when it was time the
[31:56] boat was the ark was done the those that
[31:58] believed his message went in the ark and
[32:00] were saved from the from the judgment
[32:02] right amen the rest were destroyed
[32:05] but that's the
[32:06] the
[32:07] characteristic of noah's day
[32:10] the wickedness of man was great and the
[32:13] imagination of every thought was evil
[32:16] continually
[32:18] now let's look at lot
[32:20] and
[32:22] now a lot
[32:23] you can go back and read it if you like
[32:26] chapter 19 in genesis is a very uh very
[32:29] descriptive about the days of lot and
[32:32] and the angels going down there and all
[32:34] the things that unfolded but invert but
[32:36] in chapter 13 genesis 13
[32:41] there's one verse
[32:43] that to me summed it up one verse just
[32:47] like in the andalusian world here with
[32:49] lot
[32:50] genesis 13 13 but the men of sodom were
[32:54] wicked and sinners before the lord
[32:57] exceedingly
[32:59] wicked
[33:01] and sinners before the lord exceedingly
[33:05] and look at where you find this about
[33:07] sodom
[33:09] you find it in 1313 what did brother
[33:12] brown say the number of the united
[33:13] states was
[33:15] number 13.
[33:16] this is genesis 13 verse 13
[33:20] where the wickedness of solomon
[33:22] so have we returned back to sodom again
[33:24] amen oh i think if god doesn't destroy
[33:27] this today he'll have to raise sodom and
[33:28] gomorrah and apologize right forsaking
[33:31] them believe to see
[33:32] amen
[33:33] that's the truth
[33:35] now
[33:37] let's go over to ecclesiastes
[33:40] chapter we're going to begin reading in
[33:42] chapter 2.
[33:46] and i want to finish this up
[33:48] with that thought of vanity you ever
[33:50] ready collegiate ecclesiastes yes
[33:53] well the beginning of ecclesiastes is
[33:56] the pat's last name
[33:59] you ever thought of that echoes
[34:01] e-c-c-l-e-s echols that's ecclesiastes
[34:03] that's their name ecclesiastes if you
[34:06] read ecclesiastes you know it means the
[34:08] preacher or or the preacher
[34:10] and and he spends a lot of time speaking
[34:13] about vanity
[34:15] talking about vanity and when i saw this
[34:17] about the the the building and the the
[34:20] planting and and and all the the
[34:23] frivolous way that people were living
[34:25] their lives
[34:27] i i believe that's why you see such an
[34:29] increased home and homelessness too
[34:32] the way people the the way people live
[34:34] their lives today they just don't care
[34:37] we went by we now now you know what's
[34:39] everywhere but this just struck me me
[34:41] and brother roger were coming from a job
[34:43] at grant and silverbell we were coming
[34:45] west on grant got right to the
[34:47] interstate and got on the interpa the
[34:48] underpass to turn left to get up on the
[34:51] interstate and it was a woman homeless
[34:52] ladies that corner is full of homeless
[34:54] people normally but she was sitting
[34:56] there after people were working their
[34:58] corners she was sitting there
[35:01] underneath the shade next to the
[35:03] the wall
[35:04] uh
[35:05] and around her was just it's like she
[35:08] had taken a section of the landfill and
[35:11] put it around her
[35:13] yeah and she was just sitting in the
[35:14] middle of garbage
[35:16] filth
[35:18] nastiness
[35:19] i i really felt sorry for the woman
[35:23] probably self-inflicted a lot of wounds
[35:25] today are self-inflicted i i don't
[35:29] i don't feel less sorry for
[35:31] self-inflicted wounds because they're
[35:32] still wounds yeah but when they're
[35:34] self-inflicted there's a limited amount
[35:36] of things you can really do
[35:38] right
[35:40] yeah
[35:41] you
[35:42] i could have gave her 10 bucks and she
[35:44] had about 10 more dollars worth of trash
[35:46] to put around her
[35:47] be it a
[35:48] cup from circle k
[35:50] or a candy bar wrapper or an empty bag
[35:54] of chips or something it's just 10 more
[35:56] dollars worth of trash around her
[35:59] unfortunately
[36:01] but it's the it's the flippant nature
[36:04] it's the
[36:05] disregard for the really for the
[36:08] sanctity of life
[36:10] and i
[36:11] that that's very strong
[36:13] but i feel very strong about that
[36:16] a lot of people have a very uh
[36:19] a passive nature about the gift of life
[36:23] right about the uh about the fact that
[36:27] god has blessed you with a day to live
[36:30] to have a life
[36:32] to to feed yourself and to work and
[36:35] enjoy life and have a family and
[36:38] and do things that life can afford you
[36:42] children grandchildren and a family and
[36:45] and live your life have a little money
[36:48] see another part of the country or world
[36:50] go on a little vacation have something a
[36:53] little extra whatever not over
[36:55] indulgence of course but you know god
[36:57] blesses us and we're thankful for that
[37:00] but just something but it's it's just an
[37:03] attitude
[37:04] really for the lack of
[37:07] appreciation for the fact that these
[37:09] people are alive
[37:14] if they felt that they would they
[37:16] wouldn't live that way
[37:17] my opinion now some i understand some
[37:21] uh there's mental issues and some drug
[37:24] abuse issues and alcoholic issues and
[37:27] things like that and uh but to me friend
[37:29] that
[37:30] we should take care of people who can't
[37:32] take care of themselves mentally
[37:34] we should take care of people who are uh
[37:36] who are hooked on there should be there
[37:38] should be facilities and places they can
[37:40] go if they're hooked on drugs or alcohol
[37:42] yeah there should be a place for the
[37:44] veterans there should be a single
[37:46] homeless veteran in this country
[37:48] anywhere period if you're a veteran we
[37:51] should take care of you because you took
[37:52] care of us
[37:54] that's my opinion
[37:56] now people now most of the group that's
[37:58] left is just people who don't care and
[37:59] they just they just live that way
[38:01] because they want to
[38:03] they just don't care they want to be
[38:04] homeless they don't want any
[38:05] responsibility they don't want to have
[38:06] to be told what to do they don't want to
[38:08] have to get up and go to a job every
[38:10] morning they don't want those things so
[38:12] they just live
[38:13] the way they live
[38:15] and i'm sorry but those again are
[38:17] self-inflicted wounds
[38:20] amen
[38:21] but now ecclesiastes building on that
[38:23] thought ecclesiastes
[38:26] the vanity the living your life
[38:29] uh
[38:31] as as though there is no god
[38:34] ecclesiastes two and one
[38:36] i said in mine heart
[38:39] now i'm gonna stop there
[38:42] because that's a very
[38:45] profound
[38:47] few words
[38:49] if you go and you look in the scripture
[38:51] just at those four words
[38:53] uh five words i said in my heart
[38:58] now when uh when that scripture is
[39:01] written when those words are said
[39:03] it's in reference to someone who is
[39:06] completely
[39:07] self-reliant
[39:09] and does not believe or trust in any god
[39:13] i've said in my heart what is the one
[39:16] place in the bible i'm going to test you
[39:18] you can answer this if you want
[39:20] there is
[39:21] no wrong answer but i have something
[39:23] specific in my mind
[39:26] the one specific place that comes to
[39:28] mind when you hear that i said in my
[39:30] heart what do you think about there is
[39:31] no god
[39:33] in the scripture
[39:35] there is no god
[39:38] anybody else
[39:39] to give any place
[39:41] when it says i said in my heart
[39:44] who else said in his heart something
[39:47] huh
[39:48] there we go
[39:50] isaiah 14
[39:52] and in isaiah 14 verse 12 it said how
[39:56] are thou fallen from heaven o loose for
[39:58] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[40:00] to the ground which this week in the
[40:02] nation for thou has said in thine heart
[40:06] talking about lucifer satan
[40:08] thou has said in thy heart well friend i
[40:10] don't want to do anything
[40:12] in any way that would be a replication
[40:15] of something about the devil
[40:17] when it says he said in his heart i
[40:19] don't ever want to say anything in my
[40:21] heart
[40:23] you understand
[40:24] because this reference of the devil he
[40:27] has said in his heart
[40:29] i will ascend into heaven i will exalt
[40:31] my throne above the stars of god i will
[40:33] sit upon the mouth of the congregation
[40:35] and the sides of the north i will ascend
[40:37] above the heights of the clouds i will
[40:39] be like the most high
[40:41] satan himself
[40:43] has said in his heart
[40:45] so when you read it in ecclesiastes it
[40:48] begins with the phrase
[40:50] i said in my heart that is not a good
[40:53] beginning right that is a very
[40:55] self-serving
[40:57] selfish
[40:59] self-reliant
[41:01] attitude words
[41:03] there's another one that said that
[41:05] amen that's that's very prominent that
[41:07] we know of i'll read it to you
[41:10] and it's in several of the gospels but
[41:12] in saint luke chapter 12
[41:15] verse 19
[41:18] rich young ruler
[41:21] and i will say to my soul
[41:24] amen
[41:26] rich young ruler i will say to my soul
[41:29] soul thou has much goods laid up for
[41:32] many years
[41:33] take thine ease drink eat drink and be
[41:37] merry
[41:39] amen
[41:40] the same
[41:42] attitude the same disregarding attitude
[41:45] jesus gave spoke of specifically about
[41:48] the days of life right
[41:50] building
[41:52] planting
[41:53] living your life as though there is no
[41:55] god
[41:56] let's finish ecclesiastes i said in my
[41:59] heart
[42:00] go to now i will prove thee with mirth
[42:03] that's with with joy
[42:06] gaiety
[42:08] i will prove thee with mirth
[42:11] therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this
[42:15] also is vanity now what did brother
[42:18] branham say the spirit of america was
[42:21] frolic yes that's what he said amen
[42:24] i said i said of laughter it is mad and
[42:28] of joy mirth what doeth it
[42:32] i saw in my heart
[42:34] to give myself unto wine
[42:36] yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom
[42:40] or that is acquainting or resisting
[42:43] pushing away
[42:45] pushing away mine heart with wisdom so
[42:48] he doesn't want wisdom
[42:50] and to lay hold on to folly or
[42:52] foolishness
[42:54] so he's rejecting wisdom
[42:57] and embracing foolishness right
[43:00] till i might see what was the good for
[43:03] the sons of men
[43:05] which they should do under the heaven
[43:07] all the days of their life
[43:09] i made me i made me great works
[43:13] i builded me houses i planted me
[43:15] vineyards i made me gardens and orchards
[43:18] and i planted trees in them all
[43:21] of all kinds of fruits
[43:23] i made me pools of water to water where
[43:26] there with the wood that bringeth forth
[43:28] trees
[43:29] i got me servants maids and had servants
[43:32] born in my house
[43:33] also i had great possessions of great
[43:35] and small cattle above all that were in
[43:38] jerusalem before me i gathered me also
[43:41] silver and gold and the
[43:44] peculiar treasure of kings and of
[43:46] provinces
[43:48] i got me men singers and women singers
[43:51] and the delights of the sons of men as
[43:53] musical instruments and that of all
[43:56] sorts
[43:57] so i was great
[43:59] and increased more than all there were
[44:02] before me in jerusalem
[44:04] also my wisdom remained with me
[44:08] and shall i say their humility as well
[44:12] my wisdom remained with me
[44:15] and whatsoever my eyes declared i kept
[44:17] not from them i withheld not my heart
[44:20] from any joy from my heart rejoiced in
[44:23] all my labor and this was my portion of
[44:26] all my labor
[44:27] then i looked on all the works that my
[44:30] hands had wrought
[44:31] and all the labors that i had labored to
[44:33] do and behold all was vanity and
[44:36] vexation of spirit and there was no
[44:39] prophet under the sun
[44:42] live their lives
[44:44] as though there was no god right
[44:46] now
[44:48] i counted
[44:50] i don't know how this stood out to you
[44:53] but as i read this again this morning
[44:56] it stood out to me and i counted how
[44:58] many times in 11 verses he uses the word
[45:02] i
[45:04] yeah
[45:05] i
[45:07] 20 times
[45:09] in 11 verses
[45:12] the personal pronoun i was used
[45:16] that's shocking in 11 verses
[45:19] now that's not self-serving i don't know
[45:21] what it is
[45:22] i mean that's just that's just somebody
[45:24] who's completely dependent on themselves
[45:27] self-reliant egotistical don't care
[45:30] anything about god or the world that
[45:32] live their lives however they want to
[45:34] they're going to give their not deny
[45:36] their heart of any pleasure at all
[45:39] everything that they do they're going to
[45:40] do for themselves they're going to do it
[45:42] for the gain of themselves
[45:45] forget about whether it's helping
[45:46] somebody else
[45:48] that's not significant
[45:50] it's got to be something that's going to
[45:51] profit me or i'm not going to do it
[45:55] self-serving
[45:57] self-editifying
[45:58] living their lives as though there is no
[46:00] god
[46:01] but i want to give you another one i'm
[46:03] closing
[46:05] 20 eyes in 11 verses
[46:08] but guess how many how many other
[46:10] personal pronouns are in that same 11
[46:13] verses
[46:15] 24
[46:17] personal pronouns
[46:20] me
[46:21] let's see
[46:22] mine
[46:24] me
[46:25] my
[46:26] mine
[46:27] myself
[46:29] 24 personal pronouns outside of the 20
[46:33] eyes so in 11 verses now this ain't a
[46:37] good lesson friend
[46:38] in 11 verses
[46:41] 44 personal pronouns in 11 verses
[46:45] 44.
[46:47] now that's somebody that's egotistical
[46:49] self-serving doesn't care about anybody
[46:52] or anything else
[46:53] planting building living their lives is
[46:56] as though there was no god
[46:59] and that's the way the world is today
[47:01] right notice the far majority of people
[47:04] today oh you say oh there's all kinds of
[47:07] uh of nonprofits that help homeless
[47:09] people and help people that need
[47:11] assistance and all these things i wonder
[47:14] now i i don't i don't want to question
[47:17] this the sincerity of anybody
[47:20] i don't want to put words in anybody's
[47:22] mouth or
[47:23] or define anybody's heart's desire
[47:27] but i wonder
[47:28] how many of that
[47:30] of those people and that money would be
[47:32] given if it wasn't tax deductible
[47:35] right
[47:37] what does tax deduction do
[47:40] it gives them a benefit
[47:43] amen right and a lot of people say well
[47:46] instead of giving it to the government
[47:48] i'm just going to give it to this
[47:49] organization
[47:50] well are they really giving it of their
[47:52] heart
[47:54] if that's the attitude again i'm not
[47:56] going to question anybody's motive but
[47:58] if that's the attitude
[48:00] they're giving it because it profits
[48:04] them self-serving look at the world
[48:07] today
[48:09] you see it you can see it on the streets
[48:11] it's being taught to our children
[48:14] you see it prominently in the world
[48:16] today self-serving
[48:21] and and it's a spirit that's prevalent
[48:24] to the world
[48:26] and it's no wonder that the general
[48:27] populace doesn't have a trust in in
[48:30] churches and ministry today it's no
[48:32] wonder christianity has lost so many
[48:34] people over to buddhism and
[48:37] and and and uh all the other
[48:41] things
[48:42] other religions in the world
[48:44] yeah
[48:45] what is the
[48:47] what is the greatest portion of the
[48:49] mainstream christianity got to offer for
[48:52] the regular person today
[48:55] it's sad
[48:57] you go and see these big personal pop
[49:00] of personalities on tv and one guy is
[49:03] saying he needs to buy another jet he's
[49:04] already got four and another guy's
[49:07] streaming from his 12 million dollar
[49:09] mansion yeah
[49:13] it reminds me of brother branham when
[49:15] somebody tried to give him a cadillac he
[49:16] said how could i drive a catalog how
[49:18] could i take that car and drive up to a
[49:20] sick poor person's house and try to
[49:23] offer prayer for them
[49:27] now does that mean that god won't hear
[49:28] brother graham's prayer no but does it
[49:31] mean that that person he's going to may
[49:32] have a little less confidence because
[49:34] this guy is coming in with a thousand
[49:36] dollar suit and a 50 80 000 car
[49:41] that's why brother brain said i couldn't
[49:42] do it right now brother brown drove new
[49:45] cars there's nothing that
[49:48] but
[49:48] you understand my point right and it's
[49:50] no wonder that people's lives it's
[49:52] self-serving everything becomes
[49:54] self-serving yes
[49:56] when when everything about ministry is
[49:58] to serve
[50:00] not be self-serving
[50:02] it's to give yes i mean it it does my
[50:05] heart go when i hear the testimonies and
[50:08] like sister julian thanks for the
[50:10] support and the text and the love and
[50:12] the pouring out and everything and that
[50:15] that means a lot today yeah you're
[50:18] giving of yourself
[50:19] and you're giving of yourself not
[50:21] expecting anything in return
[50:23] amen i mean the thanks and appreciation
[50:26] is very nice and and thankful for that
[50:28] but you don't do it to expect anything
[50:31] right it's just like when you give as
[50:32] unto the lord see everything you do you
[50:35] do is unto the lord yes amen every
[50:38] we we sometimes lose sight of that
[50:41] you know
[50:42] sometimes i have to remind myself when
[50:44] it's 105 degrees outside my back is
[50:46] burning and my and my arms are hurting
[50:48] and digging a ditch and i'm thinking
[50:50] lord this next shovel's for you
[50:52] amen amen this next this next uh
[50:56] uh picking the ground is for you
[50:59] i'm not doing it for roger i'm not doing
[51:01] it for electrical business i'm not doing
[51:03] it for the uh for the customer i'm doing
[51:06] it as unto the lord amen
[51:08] sisters every time you turn on the stove
[51:10] you do it as unto the lord yes every
[51:13] single meal you make you're making for
[51:14] christ yeah
[51:17] you saw i'm tired of doing this and
[51:19] and my husband or my children or
[51:21] whatever you're doing it for god yes
[51:25] every time you punch that clock you
[51:27] punch it for jesus
[51:30] every witness that you do every text you
[51:33] give every good word that you speak
[51:36] every encouragement you give you do it
[51:38] as unto the lord yes
[51:41] amen
[51:42] now we do it with wisdom
[51:45] when you live your life for others
[51:47] you're staring heaven in the face yes
[51:50] not 44 pronouns and 11 they're personal
[51:52] pronouns and 11 verses
[51:54] amen it's all about him yes it's not
[51:57] about me it's not about i and that's
[52:00] what
[52:01] the days of life that's what jesus was
[52:03] talking about
[52:04] that's exactly what he was talking about
[52:07] and friend i'm here to tell you this is
[52:09] the rapture part 14. we're seeing it
[52:11] prevalent all around us everywhere today
[52:15] i i see very few pockets of of of
[52:19] individuals and or even groups or
[52:21] churches that don't operate under that
[52:24] premise
[52:26] it becomes about my foreign no more
[52:29] oh come to our church we're the only one
[52:32] that's got it
[52:34] that's just the same attitude friend
[52:36] that's the same spirit and it doesn't
[52:38] work that way it doesn't work with me
[52:41] and i believe the fact that you're here
[52:42] means it doesn't work with you either
[52:45] amen but we live our lives as unto the
[52:47] lord everything we do we do it for
[52:49] christ
[52:50] every every word every imagination every
[52:53] thought
[52:54] every word
[52:56] we do it as unto the lord yes amen
[52:59] which is the absolute
[53:01] contrast
[53:03] of what's going on in the world today
[53:04] yeah everything's self-serving yes
[53:09] when i first started driving
[53:11] um i first started here but back in
[53:13] north carolina
[53:14] well even here at that time
[53:16] you know in 1985 86 in the mid-80s
[53:19] you pull up to a a light
[53:23] and if
[53:24] or if you were trying to come out of a
[53:25] parking lot people pulled up the light
[53:27] people would let you out yeah sometimes
[53:29] you gotta wait two two and two and three
[53:31] light cycles or just pull out in front
[53:32] of somebody before you get out because
[53:34] nobody lets you out
[53:35] every once in a while i run across some
[53:37] that do
[53:38] but
[53:39] it's fairly rare anymore cut you off
[53:42] pull in front of you
[53:44] basically
[53:45] because they just want to be first
[53:47] i don't know i guess maybe their
[53:48] favorite episode of the flintstones is
[53:49] on or something i don't know
[53:51] but
[53:53] but
[53:54] it can't be because they're in that big
[53:57] a hurry
[53:58] because you pull right up behind it but
[54:00] the next traffic light
[54:03] it's just to get in front of you yeah
[54:06] it's that spirit it's that attitude me
[54:08] first in a lot of cases me only
[54:12] yeah and it's it's it's grip the world
[54:14] it's taken over
[54:16] amen and you can see it i i can come up
[54:18] with another
[54:20] 100 examples do you know what i'm
[54:21] talking about you see it tick tock and
[54:24] all that stuff all that it just
[54:26] encourages all that stuff yes amen self
[54:29] edification look at me
[54:32] and that's what it's become as it was in
[54:34] the days of lot
[54:35] that's exactly what it was in the days
[54:37] of life yes
[54:38] that prevailing spirit me first and god
[54:41] sunk them
[54:42] now what's going to happen to this world
[54:44] amen i don't know well i do know but i
[54:46] know what's going on to the bride and
[54:48] she's getting ready to go home amen amen

[55:18] god is so good to us isn't he

[55:41] curtain of time and came back and told
[55:42] us of the report so we got a little bit
[55:44] of knowledge about it but oh it's gonna
