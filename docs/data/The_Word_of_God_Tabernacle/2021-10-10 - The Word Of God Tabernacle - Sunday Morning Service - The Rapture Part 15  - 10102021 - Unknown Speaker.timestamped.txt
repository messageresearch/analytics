[36:46] chapter four
[36:48] we'll uh
[36:50] kind of pick up where we left off last
[36:52] time
[36:53] uh the lord willing so this is the
[36:55] rapture part 15.
[36:57] amen and i had a kind of a thought of
[36:59] the way that i was going to go today
[37:02] uh
[37:02] from a couple weeks ago of course the
[37:04] last couple of sundays of course we've
[37:06] had brother noel ministering for us and
[37:08] really enjoyed brother noel's ministry
[37:10] and brother noel's sister shirley being
[37:11] with us the past couple of weekends
[37:13] uh but a few weeks ago uh
[37:17] you know at my desk over here and
[37:19] uh but yesterday no this week sometime
[37:22] this week uh the lord put a message on
[37:25] my heart and i started listening to it
[37:26] brother branham and it really uh it kind
[37:29] of changed my fault for today so
[37:32] uh trust it be a blessing to you it's
[37:33] still along the same theme the same
[37:35] lines the rapture just be the rapture
[37:38] part 15
[37:39] uh
[37:40] won't be probably too awful long today
[37:42] but uh however the lord leads
[37:44] i know he's here
[37:46] he's felt his presence here today
[37:48] already amen
[37:50] praise the lord it's so special amen
[37:53] sometimes i feel like i'm just going to
[37:55] come out of my skin
[37:56] amen i gotta still feel that way a
[37:58] little bit so the lord helped
[38:00] uh
[38:01] almost down a little so we can uh

[41:26] amen rapture
[41:28] message of course we've now read this
[41:30] the 15th time because this is part 15 we
[41:33] read this at the beginning of each one
[41:34] of these segments
[41:36] amen and it just just grows greater and
[41:38] greater every time i read it and every
[41:39] time you look at it especially you get
[41:41] to that part where it says so shall we
[41:43] ever be with the lord
[41:45] amen i believe that's every one of our
[41:47] aspirations
[41:48] our goals our our aim and our purpose is
[41:53] to spend eternity with the lord jesus
[41:55] our savior our lord our god
[41:57] amen in this little this little blip of
[42:00] life that the lord give us here we're
[42:02] very thankful for and appreciate god's
[42:04] blessings to us
[42:05] but lord where uh but saints we're
[42:07] looking for the lord to take us to a
[42:09] place that's beyond this mortal leech no
[42:12] doubt we'll come back here on this earth
[42:13] and we'll live here after god's purified
[42:16] it and and uh and gotten all the sin and
[42:19] everything off of it and we come back
[42:21] and live here but uh but now that we're
[42:24] living in this place living in this
[42:26] earth we're living in this time that
[42:28] we're living in we can see the things
[42:30] that's going on around us and all the
[42:32] things that's happening to us and i i'll
[42:35] let you know right now
[42:36] that uh
[42:38] that message the lord put on hard to
[42:40] bring it back to this
[42:42] subject or this portion of this for
[42:44] today
[42:45] helps us recognize that we can see that
[42:48] the handwriting is on the wall
[42:50] amen the handwriting is on the wall
[42:53] today friend and that's what the lord
[42:54] spoke to me this week the handwriting is
[42:57] on the wall we can see the handwriting
[42:59] that's going on in
[43:01] in the world today and you know this
[43:03] handwriting is a very specific
[43:05] handwriting it's something that that god
[43:07] puts out there that god brings by
[43:10] revelation to those who would receive it
[43:12] and believe it and for that word to be
[43:14] revealed to them
[43:16] now we know that in the scripture
[43:19] and we'll turn over to daniel
[43:21] if you'd like to turn with me to daniel
[43:23] chapter 5 before i get too far ahead of
[43:25] myself
[43:27] that
[43:28] this
[43:30] story in daniel
[43:32] precipitated the
[43:34] the the message and the thought process
[43:37] of
[43:38] handwriting being on the wall
[43:41] there's something very specific about
[43:43] handwriting being on the wall and what
[43:46] it meant scripturally and and how the
[43:49] context came from it for us to recognize
[43:51] today exactly what that means
[43:55] now you'd look and say well there's
[43:56] handwriting on the wall and you know
[43:59] that might not mean a lot to some people
[44:02] but when you take it in the scriptural
[44:04] context we understand in that context
[44:07] that it has the connotation of judgment
[44:11] amen there's a connotation of judgment
[44:14] that follows the thought process of the
[44:17] handwriting is on the wall and when we
[44:20] say the handwriting is on the wall we
[44:22] understand that
[44:24] we know what we're talking about we know
[44:26] what is meant when we say the
[44:27] handwriting is on the wall is something
[44:30] that comes very obvious something that
[44:32] comes very blatant to to
[44:35] to those who are in the know
[44:37] if you are not in the know it is not
[44:39] obvious
[44:40] it is not blatant to those who are not
[44:43] in the know but if you are one of god's
[44:46] children if you are
[44:48] if you are a child of god you are one of
[44:50] the ones that is in the know that does
[44:52] know what is going on today and can see
[44:55] what that handwriting is
[44:58] what it means what it stands for and
[45:01] what we can see today that's going on
[45:03] not just in our country but in the world
[45:07] this country was supposed to be the
[45:09] beacon on this hillside of christianity
[45:12] of morals of of of of goodness of right
[45:17] that's what this country was founded on
[45:19] that's what it was built on that's what
[45:21] it's supposed to be
[45:23] it's supposed to be that that's sean out
[45:25] to the rest of the world that we stand
[45:28] as that
[45:29] at that pinnacle of morality
[45:32] of godliness of a christian nation
[45:36] but as it is falling down into the
[45:38] degradations that is satan's eden we
[45:41] know it is coming to the into the uh
[45:45] same level in the same uh thought
[45:48] process as the rest of the world
[45:51] the the the filth and and the uh the the
[45:55] the
[45:56] the sin that that is engulfed the rest
[45:59] of the world has taken over brother
[46:01] branham talked about of course the
[46:03] spirit of god traveling and going from
[46:05] country to country and and as it went
[46:07] from country to country each country had
[46:10] its opportunity at the gospel of christ
[46:13] each country had its opportunity at the
[46:16] holy spirit but as each country got that
[46:19] opportunity each country turned it down
[46:22] until it came into the west
[46:25] and it finally come and reached into the
[46:27] west coast into california and in this
[46:30] country
[46:31] and in this country turned it down
[46:33] we had our opportunity for him we had
[46:36] our chance and we turned it down and
[46:38] friend when you turn down god there's
[46:40] nothing left but judgment and when
[46:42] there's nothing left but judgment the
[46:45] handwriting is on the wall
[46:47] amen the handwriting is on the wall
[46:49] daniel chapter 5. let's read this here
[46:52] i want to read a fair part of this story
[46:55] many of you of course would know the
[46:58] story
[46:59] we're going to start with the first
[47:00] verse daniel chapter 5 verse 1.
[47:06] amen daniel chapter 5 verse 1.
[47:11] belshazzar the king made a great feast
[47:15] now as we read this think about this
[47:18] what's going on and we'll just say in
[47:19] our country today now you can talk about
[47:22] the rest of the world and encompass the
[47:24] rest of the world let's think about in
[47:26] the context of our country
[47:29] the country as brother tom had prayed
[47:30] the country because
[47:32] i i witnessed to what brother tom said
[47:35] there because it's it's my heart too
[47:38] what he what he prayed has been in my
[47:40] heart for for years now
[47:43] and
[47:44] and and having a heart that
[47:46] and i believe brother branham too did
[47:48] that you love this country
[47:50] that
[47:52] this country has meant a lot to me
[47:55] and i believe it has you too
[47:59] i believe it's still the best country on
[48:00] the earth
[48:02] but the perplexity of what we're going
[48:04] through now with knowing what's going to
[48:07] happen to this world to this country and
[48:10] yet have that still in your heart it's
[48:12] hard
[48:13] it's hard it's a it's a battle i fight
[48:16] almost every day i'll be honest with you
[48:18] almost every day i fight this battle
[48:20] because my heart wants to see it blessed
[48:24] and prosperous
[48:25] and wants to see it a godly nation
[48:28] my heart wants to see people come to
[48:30] christ my heart wants to see a godly man
[48:33] in the office
[48:34] my heart wants to see a government that
[48:36] has a heart of the people but it's gone
[48:40] and it will not return
[48:42] it is not going to return friends
[48:46] and when that happens there's nothing
[48:47] left but judgment and but it but it it
[48:50] it eats at your it eats at my heart it
[48:54] really does i hate to see it
[48:56] it it it it
[48:58] it troubles me all the time
[49:02] even though i know what's going on even
[49:03] though i know what's happening
[49:05] it it
[49:07] difficult but as we read this think
[49:09] about in the context of what we know is
[49:11] going on in our country today
[49:13] belshazzar the king made a great feast
[49:16] to the thousand of his lords
[49:19] and drank wine before the thousand
[49:22] belshazzar
[49:24] while he tasted the wine
[49:27] commanded to bring the golden and silver
[49:30] vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar
[49:32] had taken out of the temple which was in
[49:35] jerusalem that the king and his princes
[49:37] his wives his concubines might drink
[49:40] therein now this and
[49:43] when i when i started this i said we
[49:45] kind of continue on with where we were a
[49:47] couple of weeks ago
[49:49] and this is kind of that part
[49:51] because
[49:52] this again
[49:54] uh it is the attitude or the atmosphere
[49:57] of
[49:58] a people who are living their lives as
[50:01] is though there is no god
[50:03] remember last time we spoke here uh we
[50:06] took from luke and we'll probably go
[50:08] back to that scripture again today and
[50:10] they they eat drank married given in
[50:14] marriage they build it they they planted
[50:17] and basically remember
[50:20] where we took that word where it's the
[50:22] people were in the position of living
[50:24] their lives as if though there was no
[50:26] god
[50:28] and that's the way that's the way
[50:29] they're at today that's the way they
[50:31] live today and you see this is this is a
[50:34] representative of that this is exactly
[50:37] how belshazzar is doing
[50:40] living his life as if though there is no
[50:42] god
[50:43] and that's the way the world is today
[50:45] that's the way this country is becoming
[50:47] living their lives as if though there is
[50:49] no god right
[50:52] then they brought the golden vessels
[50:54] that were taken out of the temple of the
[50:56] house of god which was at jerusalem and
[50:58] the king and his princes his wives his
[51:00] concubines drank in them
[51:03] they drank wine and praised the gods of
[51:06] gold and of silver a brass of iron of
[51:09] wood and of stone
[51:12] as if though there is no god you say
[51:14] well we believe in god
[51:16] this country says that they've had
[51:18] churches around the country today full
[51:21] of people
[51:22] there's been auditoriums there's been
[51:25] thousands and tens of thousands of
[51:27] people that have attended church
[51:29] services across this country today
[51:32] you say i believe in god i believe in
[51:34] jesus i received christ but living their
[51:38] lives like there isn't a god
[51:41] there's a big difference in saying i
[51:43] believe him and i know him and live your
[51:45] life as a representative and reflection
[51:48] of the word there's a big difference
[51:51] they say we do but they live their lives
[51:54] as though they don't
[51:56] their testimony their lives don't back
[51:59] up their testimony
[52:01] and
[52:02] and this
[52:04] this is a microcosm this is a represent
[52:08] a representation of
[52:10] of that attitude of that thought
[52:15] let's party and have fun remember what
[52:18] brother branham said the spirit of this
[52:20] country is
[52:21] frolic
[52:23] amen
[52:24] frolic
[52:26] just living our lives without regard of
[52:29] other people without regard of of a god
[52:33] or being pleasing to to our lord jesus
[52:37] living living as if though none of that
[52:39] mattered
[52:41] and that's exactly what they've got here
[52:43] i believe they call it today live and
[52:45] let live
[52:47] that's that's kind of the mantra i guess
[52:48] they have we live and let live
[52:51] so you can be and do whatever you want
[52:53] just live however you want and it's okay
[52:56] i'm sorry friend doesn't work that way
[52:59] the handwriting is on the wall
[53:02] fifth verse in the same hour
[53:05] they're having this party now in the
[53:07] same hour that they're having this party
[53:10] came forth fingers of a man's hand and
[53:13] rode over against the candlestick upon
[53:15] the plaster of the wall of the king's
[53:17] palace and the king saw the part of the
[53:19] hand that wrote
[53:21] then the king's countenance was changed
[53:24] and his thoughts troubled him so that
[53:27] the joints of his lawns were loosed and
[53:29] his knees smote one against another
[53:32] rightfully so
[53:35] the king cried aloud to bring in the
[53:37] astrologers and the chaldeans and the
[53:39] soothsayers
[53:41] and the king spake and said to the wise
[53:43] men of babylon whosoever shall read this
[53:46] writing and show me the interpretation
[53:48] thereof shall be clothed with scarlet
[53:50] have a chain of gold about his neck and
[53:52] shall be the third ruler in the kingdom
[53:55] then came in all the king's wise men but
[53:57] they could not read the writing nor make
[53:59] known to the king the interpretation
[54:02] thereof
[54:03] look now
[54:05] then was king belshazzar
[54:07] greatly troubled and his countenance was
[54:10] changed in him and his lords were
[54:13] astonished now this great writing that
[54:16] we know obviously came from god because
[54:19] it came simply in the form of a man's
[54:22] hand and wrote on the wall
[54:25] but it wrote in plain view for everybody
[54:28] that was there partying to be able to
[54:31] see it
[54:32] every one of them
[54:34] they all were privy to what was what was
[54:36] wrote but they could not interpret the
[54:39] writing they had no idea what it said
[54:42] they had no idea what it meant
[54:44] and look friend the handwriting is on
[54:47] the wall today but people look at it and
[54:50] they have no idea what's going on you
[54:53] cannot read the handwriting unless you
[54:56] are of god
[54:58] only god's children can read that
[55:00] handwriting today
[55:01] they see it don't tell me the world
[55:04] doesn't see what's going on there's
[55:06] people all over this country they know
[55:08] exactly what's going on
[55:10] they can see it with their eyes but they
[55:12] don't understand it
[55:14] because they have no comprehension or
[55:16] understanding of godly things
[55:20] this could not be interpreted by the
[55:23] world it could not be interpreted by the
[55:25] worldly uh uh
[55:28] education or soothsayers or astronomers
[55:32] or or educated men
[55:34] in fact
[55:35] the more they got educated the further
[55:37] that took them away from it
[55:40] you have to be educated in christ
[55:43] in god
[55:44] so as this handwriting come from the
[55:46] only one that's going to be able to read
[55:48] that handwriting that's on the wall
[55:49] today is god's children
[55:52] god's children's gentleman is going to
[55:53] be able to read that handwriting we're
[55:55] the only ones that god's children's all
[55:57] the ones that's going to know exactly
[55:59] what's going on
[56:01] others see there's something going on oh
[56:04] they were standing here at the party
[56:05] they saw the hand
[56:07] they saw the handwriting but they had no
[56:10] idea what it meant
[56:11] the people see it today they realize it
[56:14] but they have no idea what's going on
[56:17] well friend we know what's going on
[56:20] god is getting his children together and
[56:22] there's going to soon be a time where
[56:23] there's going to be a body change and
[56:25] he's going to take her home to be with
[56:26] him and there's going to be nothing left
[56:29] in this world but judgment
[56:31] darkness
[56:32] when god's children leave here friend
[56:34] there will be nothing left but hatred
[56:38] and envy and strife there'll be no
[56:41] anointing you know even in the dark ages
[56:44] even in the time and of mortament where
[56:46] they had to give their lives they still
[56:49] died with an anointing
[56:52] they had an anointing of god that was
[56:54] there with them that helped them and
[56:56] encouraged them and bless them
[56:58] but when this bride leaves friend there
[57:00] will be no anointing
[57:03] people say oh if i have to go through
[57:04] the tribulation you have no idea what
[57:06] you're talking about
[57:08] every bit of love every bit of peace
[57:11] every bit of joy every bit of goodness
[57:14] everybody anything that's god and good
[57:16] and lovely is going to be gone
[57:19] and there will be no holy spirit
[57:20] there'll be no anointing
[57:22] the the presence of god will be dealing
[57:25] with the jews gentiles will be finished
[57:28] amen there's i say we're at this point
[57:30] now really where there's just
[57:33] i i don't want to say there's no more
[57:35] because that's up to god but
[57:38] brother branham said 60 years ago we
[57:40] were in a gleaning period
[57:43] what does that mean oh there's just one
[57:45] here

[57:57] tribulation there'll be nothing there'll
[58:00] be people who want to kill themselves

[58:04] the bible said they'll cry for the rocks
[58:07] and the mountains to fall on them and
[58:09] hide them but there won't be any hiding
[58:11] place
[58:12] there'll be no way they can't kill
[58:14] themselves
[58:15] i think i've told you before i think
[58:17] that's that that's probably where this
[58:19] zombie stuff came from
[58:21] people seeing into the future into the
[58:23] tribulation period where men will take
[58:26] shotguns and try to blow their heads off
[58:28] and they can't die
[58:30] they'll be walking around with half a
[58:32] head you say how's that possible i don't
[58:34] know
[58:36] but the bible said they won't be able to
[58:37] kill themselves that's right
[58:40] and you and and people oh i had to go
[58:43] through the tribulation oh friend make
[58:46] sure your heart and soul is right with
[58:47] christ today you don't want to find
[58:49] yourself in that period of time
[58:51] amen you don't want to find yourself
[58:53] here when god's children are gone when
[58:55] god has raptured his children home and
[58:57] there's nothing left here in the but
[58:59] tribulation and judgment
[59:01] friend that's what this writing was this
[59:04] handwriting that we're talking about was
[59:06] the handwriting of judgment
[59:09] amen let's skip down and see what
[59:11] daniel's now
[59:13] the the
[59:15] i believe it was the wife of belshazzar

[59:18] there's someone in the kingdom
[59:20] nebuchadnezzar named impel bells belted
[59:23] seizure but it's daniel
[59:25] and daniel is able to be able to
[59:27] interpret these writings
[59:29] so they call for daniel daniel comes now
[59:32] in the 20 let's start with the 22nd
[59:34] verse still same same chapter daniel 5
[59:37] verse 22
[59:44] and thou his son obel shazar
[59:47] hath not humbled thine heart
[59:50] though thou newest all this
[59:53] but has lifted up thyself against the
[59:55] lord of heaven
[59:57] and they have brought the vessels of his
[59:59] house before thee
[1:00:01] and thou and thy lords thy wives thy
[1:00:04] concubines have drank drunk wine in them
[1:00:07] and now has praised the gods of silver
[1:00:11] gold brass iron wood and stone
[1:00:14] which see not nor hear nor know the god
[1:00:18] in whose hand thy breath is
[1:00:21] and whose are all the ways has thou uh
[1:00:25] hast shall not glorified
[1:00:27] now glorified god now what is it today
[1:00:31] it's simplified today
[1:00:33] they don't go out and glorify and
[1:00:36] worship the gods of gold and silver and
[1:00:39] iron and stone they have one god today
[1:00:43] this country
[1:00:44] this world has one god today
[1:00:47] most the people who live in it have one
[1:00:50] god today and it's money
[1:00:54] most people in this world today worship
[1:00:57] money
[1:00:58] and that's all they care about
[1:01:00] that's all they want they'll get it all
[1:01:02] at all costs whatever they have to do
[1:01:05] whoever they have to cheat however they
[1:01:07] have to finagle
[1:01:09] all they want is the money
[1:01:11] and that's what they worship that's what
[1:01:13] their god is their god is money
[1:01:16] and that's how they live
[1:01:20] everybody
[1:01:22] cheats and steals and lies to get it
[1:01:25] the government just says hey let's just
[1:01:27] sign a piece of paper and we'll just
[1:01:28] fire the printers
[1:01:31] that's easy enough right
[1:01:33] we'll just get some more printers and
[1:01:35] we'll just start printing it
[1:01:37] well you know the law of supply and
[1:01:39] demand the more of something there is
[1:01:41] the less it's worth
[1:01:44] the more you print it the less it's
[1:01:45] worth
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:50] she's bankrupt
[1:01:52] do you know friend that we are at a
[1:01:54] hundred and this country
[1:01:56] is at 125
[1:02:00] of its gdp
[1:02:02] brother ram talked about her being
[1:02:04] bankrupt remember
[1:02:06] we are now at 125
[1:02:10] you know what that means
[1:02:12] that means all the money that they
[1:02:14] collect and all the taxes and all the
[1:02:16] money that comes into washington dc
[1:02:20] they spend
[1:02:21] 125 percent more
[1:02:25] every year
[1:02:26] than what comes in
[1:02:28] every year
[1:02:30] that means you're bankrupt
[1:02:32] how long would you and your family last
[1:02:34] if you spent 125 percent of what you
[1:02:36] took in every year
[1:02:38] how long would you last
[1:02:40] how long would your home be able to
[1:02:41] survive that
[1:02:43] amen you might stick it on a credit card
[1:02:45] here there get a loan or something but
[1:02:47] eventually friend it's going to overcome
[1:02:49] you and you're going to be so deep in
[1:02:52] debt you'll never be able to see
[1:02:53] daylight
[1:02:55] where do you think this country is at
[1:02:58] brother branham said theo castro did the
[1:03:00] smartest thing when he when he cancelled
[1:03:02] out the money
[1:03:05] who knows friend that may be one day
[1:03:07] you'll wake up one morning and they'll
[1:03:09] say we'll give you a dime for every
[1:03:11] dollar you turn in
[1:03:13] your dollars now worthless and unless
[1:03:16] you come and give us your money we'll
[1:03:18] give you a dime for every dollar you got
[1:03:19] and just wipe it completely out
[1:03:23] where would we be
[1:03:25] see it's all about control
[1:03:28] it's all about total control and if
[1:03:30] covet has done anything in this world
[1:03:33] it's helped the p the ruling class
[1:03:35] people understand that they can dominate
[1:03:38] and control the the normal natural
[1:03:41] everyday joe me and you
[1:03:45] amen but what they don't know is they
[1:03:48] can't control us because we're only
[1:03:50] controlled by one and that's the lord
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] they can't control us but they can
[1:03:55] control all the regular commoners the
[1:03:58] regular people keep under control
[1:04:01] and if you don't do this we're gonna
[1:04:04] penalize you or we're gonna find you or
[1:04:06] we're gonna throw you in jail
[1:04:08] whatever it is
[1:04:11] this is one thing has come to help them
[1:04:13] understand that they can take control
[1:04:15] over the people
[1:04:17] and that's exactly what they want to do
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:21] this has been a democracy for a long
[1:04:23] time
[1:04:24] no more i'm afraid that it's it's it's
[1:04:28] already crossed over the handwriting's
[1:04:30] on the wall and we are the ones that can
[1:04:32] read it
[1:04:34] the others look at it and say oh well
[1:04:35] this is okay this won't hurt we'll just
[1:04:38] succumb to this and we'll just succumb
[1:04:40] to and the more and more freedoms you
[1:04:42] relinquish the more that you have no
[1:04:44] freedoms at all
[1:04:47] and what have we told you all the the
[1:04:49] people around say well the government
[1:04:50] wants to give me all this money look the
[1:04:52] more money they give you the more they
[1:04:54] own you
[1:04:57] if they can get you dependent on them
[1:04:58] giving you money
[1:05:00] then they can control you
[1:05:02] that's exactly what they did in china
[1:05:04] here not long ago you know
[1:05:07] all these people are controlling the
[1:05:08] communist country they're all controlled
[1:05:10] by the government and when they get
[1:05:12] controlled by the government then then
[1:05:15] all the government has to do is say you
[1:05:17] do what we tell you or we'll just take
[1:05:19] your money away we'll take your food
[1:05:21] away we'll take your job away we'll take
[1:05:23] any bit of livelihood from you job wait
[1:05:25] a minute if you don't get this shot
[1:05:27] we're going to take your job away
[1:05:30] sound familiar
[1:05:32] that's cause this exact same spirit
[1:05:35] amen it might be packaged in a
[1:05:37] vaccination it might be bit packaged
[1:05:40] it might be packaged in in uh
[1:05:45] in a different package but it's the same
[1:05:47] spirit
[1:05:48] control take control over you amen
[1:05:55] 22nd verse let's go back to the
[1:05:57] scripture
[1:06:01] uh well we read 22-23 24th
[1:06:04] then was the part of the hand sent from
[1:06:07] him
[1:06:08] and this writing was written
[1:06:10] and this is the writing that was written
[1:06:12] manny manny tackle euphorson
[1:06:15] that is the interpretation of the thing
[1:06:18] meaning
[1:06:19] god has numbered thy kingdom and
[1:06:22] finished it
[1:06:24] that's that's pretty judgmental amen
[1:06:27] god has numbered your kingdom and has
[1:06:29] finished it
[1:06:31] tackle thou art weighed in the balances
[1:06:34] and aren't found wanting
[1:06:37] what is the what is the declaration of
[1:06:39] this allowed to see a church age
[1:06:43] rich and increase with goods and says do
[1:06:46] you have need of nothing when you're
[1:06:48] poor miserable blind wretched naked and
[1:06:51] what don't know it
[1:06:55] amen don't know it that's because the
[1:06:57] handwriting can only be read by someone
[1:07:00] that's that that is in tune with the one
[1:07:02] who wrote it
[1:07:04] just like the scripture
[1:07:06] you can only get the revelation of the
[1:07:08] scripture if you read it in the same
[1:07:10] spirit of the author who wrote
[1:07:12] it if you could get in the same spirit
[1:07:15] of the author you could have that word
[1:07:18] be revealed to you
[1:07:20] and the same one that wrote that is the
[1:07:22] same one that put the handwriting on the
[1:07:24] wall
[1:07:25] this is a this is a handwriting of
[1:07:27] judgment
[1:07:28] this is judgment that daniel's speaking
[1:07:31] to boshes are about you are under
[1:07:33] judgment belshazzar
[1:07:35] your country is under is under judgment
[1:07:39] and this is what the handwriting says
[1:07:42] he has met your kingdom and it is
[1:07:44] finished
[1:07:45] you have been weighed in the balances by
[1:07:48] god's balance and found wanting
[1:07:52] perez thy kingdom is divided and given
[1:07:55] to the medes and persians
[1:07:58] then commanded belshazzar and they
[1:08:00] clothed daniel with scarlet put a chain
[1:08:02] of gold in his neck and made a
[1:08:03] proclamation concerning him that he
[1:08:05] should be the third ruler in the kingdom
[1:08:08] and that night was belshazzar the king
[1:08:11] of the chaldeans slain
[1:08:14] amen that night
[1:08:16] the man's eyes never opened to see
[1:08:19] another day
[1:08:20] because of the judgment that had fallen
[1:08:23] upon his kingdom and him personally
[1:08:26] he was slain that night
[1:08:29] what are we looking at today friend if
[1:08:31] the handwriting is on the wall today
[1:08:33] what are we expecting what are we
[1:08:34] looking at
[1:08:36] i don't know how much longer we've got
[1:08:38] friend but it can't be much longer
[1:08:40] this world can't go on the way it's
[1:08:42] going this country cannot go on the way
[1:08:44] it's going
[1:08:46] the sin has become so
[1:08:48] this
[1:08:49] this entire world system is shot
[1:08:53] everything about this country is
[1:08:55] bankrupt morally financially in every
[1:08:58] way
[1:09:00] bankrupt
[1:09:01] what else is there left
[1:09:04] how much longer can it go i don't mean
[1:09:06] to be
[1:09:07] uh
[1:09:07] discouraging others because this isn't
[1:09:09] discouraging to a child of god this is
[1:09:11] lift your head up because your
[1:09:13] redemption draw at night
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:17] praise the lord do i love my life yes i
[1:09:20] want to see my grandchildren grow up yes
[1:09:22] my my family all of you i'm thankful to
[1:09:24] god but friend we got a whole nother
[1:09:26] place that's waiting on us
[1:09:29] amen i got a whole nother i got a whole
[1:09:31] family that's on the other side waiting
[1:09:34] it's going to be glorious
[1:09:36] amen
[1:09:37] it's going to be glorious
[1:09:41] that night belshazzar was slain and
[1:09:43] darius
[1:09:45] the median took the kingdom being about
[1:09:48] three score and two years old took over
[1:09:50] the kingdom now the important part of
[1:09:53] this too that i want to make sure and we
[1:09:55] understand is that this this handwriting
[1:09:58] was only for the for
[1:10:01] daniel to read daniel was the only one
[1:10:04] able to read it the rest could see it
[1:10:06] but only daniel could read it the rest
[1:10:08] can see what's going on but only god's
[1:10:11] children understand it amen only those
[1:10:14] that are born again have the holy ghost
[1:10:16] understand what's going on
[1:10:19] people talk about the elections and and
[1:10:22] the money problems and and all these
[1:10:24] bills are trying to pass and all the
[1:10:26] things that's going on around the
[1:10:27] country and
[1:10:28] and covet is still taking over the world
[1:10:30] but they don't understand it
[1:10:33] they can't they can't get a grasp of the
[1:10:35] realization of why it's there why this
[1:10:39] judgment this handwriting it's on the
[1:10:42] wall of judgment
[1:10:44] is striking this world is striking this
[1:10:46] country this country is the last one to
[1:10:49] go under
[1:10:51] i believe that this country when it was
[1:10:53] given all of its opportunities and given
[1:10:55] all of its blessings and god's spirit
[1:10:58] pouring out upon this country i believe
[1:11:00] is probably the biggest reason that when
[1:11:02] brother branham saw it in the vision it
[1:11:04] was burnt border to border and coast to
[1:11:07] coast
[1:11:08] this country
[1:11:10] destroyed border the border coast to
[1:11:13] coast
[1:11:14] amen destroyed
[1:11:17] brother abraham said that if he
[1:11:19] if god didn't destroy it he'd have to
[1:11:21] raise sodom and gomorrah and apologize
[1:11:23] for doing for sinking beneath the ocean
[1:11:26] he'd have to do that
[1:11:28] but the handwriting is on the wall the
[1:11:30] judgment has been set
[1:11:32] and this country this nation is under
[1:11:35] judgment but just as this nation is
[1:11:38] under judgment the people of god
[1:11:41] stand pure
[1:11:43] righteous
[1:11:44] holy
[1:11:45] as a judgment against this nation for
[1:11:48] what's going on
[1:11:50] the world could stand and say oh well
[1:11:52] everybody's like this everybody lives
[1:11:55] this way everybody acts like this
[1:11:58] everybody enjoys this music enjoys
[1:12:01] hollywood enjoys this over here and
[1:12:04] likes and gets involved in all this but
[1:12:06] the truth of it is that is not true
[1:12:10] not everybody does
[1:12:13] god's children are far removed from the
[1:12:16] things of the world
[1:12:18] remember
[1:12:19] caught up in heavenly places in christ
[1:12:22] jesus
[1:12:23] when the world around her is living like
[1:12:24] there is no god
[1:12:26] the only way that she can live is to
[1:12:28] know that there is a god
[1:12:30] and to live her lives according to the
[1:12:32] dictates of god's word so that god would
[1:12:34] be pleased with her and live in a
[1:12:36] dimension to understand that the things
[1:12:39] that are going on around her
[1:12:42] there's things that go on in this
[1:12:43] country today friend i never would have
[1:12:45] imagined
[1:12:47] there's things and i see people and how
[1:12:49] they live their lives the things they do
[1:12:50] to themselves i never would have
[1:12:52] imagined
[1:12:55] when i was a kid the only time you saw a
[1:12:57] tattoo was on a biker or or
[1:13:01] or
[1:13:02] someone considered a horrible roust
[1:13:04] about person
[1:13:07] and now you see his now there's all
[1:13:09] kinds of emblems of praying hands and
[1:13:13] crosses and christianity and stuff and i
[1:13:15] think quiet how people have been so
[1:13:18] deceived by the devil
[1:13:21] and thinking that mutilating their
[1:13:23] bodies is pleasing to god
[1:13:26] well it's a cross the lord would like
[1:13:28] that
[1:13:30] mutilate the temple of the holy ghost
[1:13:32] and that's pleasing to god
[1:13:35] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:13:37] friend and a lot of the garbage i see is
[1:13:40] just
[1:13:41] they think they're sacrificing
[1:13:42] themselves but all they're doing is
[1:13:44] creating a a
[1:13:46] a a
[1:13:48] an image of of
[1:13:50] satanic
[1:13:54] god
[1:13:56] but where is it at today
[1:13:58] used to be that when i was a kid you'd
[1:14:01] watch a popeye or something and he'd
[1:14:03] have a little tattoo because he was a
[1:14:05] sailor you know you get in the military
[1:14:07] and you have a little thing on on arm or
[1:14:10] something
[1:14:11] now it's all over the place
[1:14:13] and of course you know
[1:14:15] you see people and they wear their
[1:14:16] clothes way up here way down here or
[1:14:18] something because they got to make sure
[1:14:20] you see it
[1:14:22] you know they they put on half clothes
[1:14:24] because you know
[1:14:25] you got to see that cross that's up
[1:14:27] their thigh
[1:14:31] bankrupt yes
[1:14:33] judgment
[1:14:34] that's the place that we live today
[1:14:36] judgment it's under a
[1:14:39] it's under a spirit of judgment
[1:14:42] only god's children are the ones that's
[1:14:44] going to be
[1:14:45] in tune with god's spirit enough to be
[1:14:47] able to read the handwriting
[1:14:49] and recognize what's going on today and
[1:14:52] what there is is left
[1:14:54] i believe that's that's probably a
[1:14:55] reason a lot of people have been leaving
[1:14:57] us lately
[1:14:58] amen
[1:14:59] yeah
[1:15:00] covert or whatever it is
[1:15:03] uh i i heard a little baby uh died the
[1:15:06] other day i forgot what it was but even
[1:15:09] sister norm i think gave a testimony of
[1:15:11] a little another little baby the other
[1:15:12] day that had died
[1:15:15] and and
[1:15:16] and people
[1:15:18] not just
[1:15:20] of cola there's been a lot of that but
[1:15:23] for for different reasons
[1:15:26] god's taking i don't know why
[1:15:29] but there's a reason behind it there's a
[1:15:31] reason why we're still here
[1:15:34] but all this is for a purpose everything
[1:15:36] is being uh
[1:15:38] everything is being orchestrated up to
[1:15:40] the place that
[1:15:42] we're coming to this time where the
[1:15:43] alive and remain group take a body
[1:15:45] change
[1:15:46] and a rapture happens
[1:15:49] but it's going to be the alive and
[1:15:50] remain group's going to be a small group
[1:15:52] friend
[1:15:53] it's going to be a small group
[1:15:54] probably wouldn't fill up joel osteen's
[1:15:56] big auditorium down there
[1:15:59] amen but
[1:16:01] but there might be one in there you
[1:16:03] don't know it might be some i i don't
[1:16:05] know i don't want to put those people
[1:16:07] out in or that's up to god amen but i
[1:16:10] know it's going to be a small group the
[1:16:11] alive and remains going to be millions
[1:16:13] over there but this live and remain
[1:16:15] group she's going to be a small group
[1:16:17] and with different ones like brother
[1:16:19] angel and ruth and all different ones
[1:16:21] that we've knows been going on that
[1:16:23] it's going to be even smaller
[1:16:26] amen because those people would have
[1:16:27] been a part of that
[1:16:29] amen now let's go over to saint luke
[1:16:34] and let me finish with this because my
[1:16:36] time's getting away but let's go over to
[1:16:38] luke 17.
[1:16:44] but i think we can all agree
[1:16:46] this this world system is shot
[1:16:49] the the world system this country is
[1:16:52] shot
[1:16:53] uh people want to look to it and
[1:16:56] and and and we keep responsibility we
[1:16:58] work and we earn money and we we live
[1:17:01] our lives and god blesses us and that's
[1:17:02] the way we should do but this system is
[1:17:05] shot
[1:17:06] world system is done
[1:17:07] it it's it it's just shot there's no way
[1:17:10] of bringing it back
[1:17:13] our government it's just there's no way
[1:17:15] of bringing it back
[1:17:17] the reason it becomes
[1:17:19] the way it is now is because the light
[1:17:22] has been shined on it
[1:17:24] and and even in the light that's being
[1:17:26] shot on it
[1:17:28] their wicked deeds are being exposed
[1:17:32] but even with their wicked deeds being
[1:17:34] exposed they don't care
[1:17:37] there has been such a
[1:17:39] a creation of apathy on the on the
[1:17:42] american people
[1:17:44] that people have become selfish and
[1:17:47] self-centered to the point that they
[1:17:48] just don't care that's right
[1:17:50] people there are some people that'll
[1:17:52] speak up in the government and say well
[1:17:54] we need to be physical responsible
[1:17:57] because these bills are going to be paid
[1:17:59] by our children grandchildren great
[1:18:01] great grandchildren
[1:18:04] but they don't care
[1:18:06] they absolutely do they might say
[1:18:08] something but they don't care because
[1:18:10] their actions speak louder than their
[1:18:12] words
[1:18:14] what they do lets us understand that
[1:18:17] they just don't care
[1:18:19] it's right here it's right now they're
[1:18:22] not worried about tomorrow they're not
[1:18:24] worried about the next generation or two
[1:18:28] and and what have they done it's just
[1:18:30] been driven straight into the ground
[1:18:33] by godless society
[1:18:35] 1956 they turned god down brother said
[1:18:39] 1957 he said they turned god down past
[1:18:42] tense the message now what is left once
[1:18:46] you turn god down the handwriting's on
[1:18:48] the wall yes amen it's getting clearer
[1:18:51] and clearer all the time
[1:18:53] if the president or his administration
[1:18:54] were to come and ask one of us i think
[1:18:56] you'd tell them what the truth is will
[1:18:58] they listen to you
[1:18:59] they'd throw you in a rubber room think
[1:19:01] he's crazy
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:03] which is true i am crazy crazy for
[1:19:06] christ
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] and by the world standards i am crazy
[1:19:11] amen
[1:19:12] saint luke 17.
[1:19:14] let's begin with verse 30. look at this
[1:19:17] one more aspect because
[1:19:19] i want to use this the lord willing
[1:19:22] to take us into the next the next week
[1:19:25] the lord willing
[1:19:27] luke 17 30. even thus shall it be in the
[1:19:30] day when the son of man is revealed now
[1:19:32] we went through of course a couple weeks
[1:19:34] ago we went through the previous verses
[1:19:36] in the days of noah and the days of lot
[1:19:38] and looking at those things which we
[1:19:40] reiterated just shortly
[1:19:42] in the days but now i want to get to the
[1:19:44] rest of this
[1:19:46] i wanted to read the rest of this
[1:19:48] scripture when we were here last time
[1:19:50] but we just ran out of time
[1:19:52] so let's finish it up here in the next
[1:19:54] 10 15 minutes even though shall it be in
[1:19:56] the day when the son of man is revealed
[1:19:59] in that day he which shall be upon the
[1:20:01] house top and his stuff in the house let
[1:20:05] him not come down to take it away and he
[1:20:08] that is in the field let him likewise uh
[1:20:12] not return back remember lot's wife in
[1:20:16] other words
[1:20:17] it is not to be the
[1:20:20] the the
[1:20:21] dog to its vomit or the sow to its
[1:20:23] wallow
[1:20:25] we're moving forward
[1:20:27] forgetting the things that are in the
[1:20:29] past we press forward
[1:20:31] to the prize of the mark of the high
[1:20:32] calling in christ we don't look back
[1:20:35] so that time comes we don't say oh but
[1:20:37] lord i got to do this and i got to do
[1:20:39] this and i got to go here and i got to
[1:20:40] get this and i got to have this and i
[1:20:42] got to make this no no no no no we live
[1:20:45] our lives

[1:20:50] with the understanding that any second
[1:20:52] god could call us home
[1:20:55] and we leave here with no regrets
[1:20:58] with nothing undone if there's somebody
[1:21:01] that you need to make right with do it
[1:21:03] now
[1:21:04] if there's something you need to fix fix
[1:21:06] it now

[1:21:09] that you need don't leave anything
[1:21:11] undone
[1:21:12] there's something do it now
[1:21:15] live as if though every second could be
[1:21:17] that last second that god's gonna take

[1:21:23] comes you say i'm on the roof say don't
[1:21:24] know i don't need to go down and fix
[1:21:26] this i don't need to change this this

[1:21:29] need to go get prayed up lord i am
[1:21:31] prayed up i'm ready to go take me now
[1:21:35] you're ready
[1:21:36] that's the instant in season and out of
[1:21:39] season that's the that's the moment and
[1:21:41] twinkling of an eye
[1:21:44] less than a click
[1:21:47] and you're ready to go
[1:21:48] remember lot's wife you don't look back
[1:21:52] she had so much of lot still in her
[1:21:54] heart
[1:21:54] she had so much of the world even in her
[1:21:57] heart that she just couldn't bear to
[1:21:59] leave it
[1:22:00] maybe even some friends maybe her card
[1:22:03] party maybe her uh uh
[1:22:06] her
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:08] bingo games or something ladies you can
[1:22:10] hear them screaming
[1:22:13] oh that would tug at your heart wouldn't
[1:22:15] it
[1:22:16] but she turned and looked
[1:22:18] and it cursed her she turned to a pillar
[1:22:21] of salt
[1:22:22] now
[1:22:23] it's not the time to look back
[1:22:25] it's time to go forward
[1:22:27] now is that time
[1:22:28] god's calling us to a higher walk
[1:22:32] god is calling us to a higher plane
[1:22:34] godless god is calling us to live a
[1:22:37] godly holy christian filled a holy ghost
[1:22:40] filled life
[1:22:42] god is calling us to something
[1:22:44] more
[1:22:45] it's like we've said the past few weeks
[1:22:47] friend
[1:22:50] we're caught up in heavenly places
[1:22:54] when you look around and you can't
[1:22:55] understand why people want to scar their
[1:22:58] bodies like they do or put holes all in
[1:23:01] their bodies
[1:23:02] or or or listen to the kind of music or
[1:23:05] walk out on the street with
[1:23:07] a third a fourth a tenth dress
[1:23:13] i think i've used floss that's wider
[1:23:16] than some things some people wear out on
[1:23:18] the street today
[1:23:20] and you think
[1:23:21] the mental insanity
[1:23:24] that has struck a people that would
[1:23:26] actually go out into the uh
[1:23:28] to where other humans can see them
[1:23:32] looking like that
[1:23:34] presenting themselves that way
[1:23:37] i think what what can it be to cause a
[1:23:40] mind to get to the place that they're
[1:23:41] like that
[1:23:44] well no wonder they all soak themselves
[1:23:45] in alcohol every night no wonder they
[1:23:48] have to get liquored up and partied all
[1:23:50] the time
[1:23:51] because they can't handle reality
[1:23:54] they can't handle life
[1:23:56] so they got to do something
[1:23:59] because that's all they have
[1:24:01] oh friend
[1:24:02] let's get
[1:24:04] let's get uh
[1:24:05] caught up in christ
[1:24:07] amen let jesus be our portion let him be
[1:24:11] the place that we go that that lifts us
[1:24:14] up beyond all the cares of the world
[1:24:18] we don't understand why how somebody
[1:24:21] could think like that to do that why
[1:24:24] what is possessed a person's mind to
[1:24:25] think like that because they're
[1:24:27] creatures of the world
[1:24:29] they're creatures of this dimension
[1:24:31] they're creatures of satan's eden and we
[1:24:34] can't understand how somebody could
[1:24:36] think like that because we don't live in
[1:24:38] that dimension
[1:24:40] we don't live that way we don't live
[1:24:42] like those in in the same place that
[1:24:45] those people live
[1:24:46] we don't live like that i don't
[1:24:48] understand how they do that but it's not
[1:24:51] for me to understand
[1:24:53] because i don't live there i don't live
[1:24:55] in the same world these people live in
[1:24:58] we don't live in the same world we don't
[1:25:00] live in the same atmosphere these people
[1:25:02] live in remember brother adam said
[1:25:04] that we should have enough god enough
[1:25:06] faith to be able to speak another world
[1:25:08] into existence and live in it
[1:25:12] that's exactly what we do
[1:25:14] that's exactly what the bride of christ
[1:25:17] does every single day
[1:25:19] we create we speak and create another
[1:25:22] atmosphere that we live in
[1:25:26] and it's it's an atmosphere that this
[1:25:29] world doesn't know anything about
[1:25:31] they might look at you and think how
[1:25:33] crazy could a person be to look like we
[1:25:36] do and to dress like we do and to act
[1:25:38] like we do it don't go to places or
[1:25:41] don't do certain things they don't
[1:25:42] understand it
[1:25:44] but what they don't understand is that
[1:25:46] we're not creatures of this atmosphere
[1:25:50] we have spoken and created another
[1:25:52] atmosphere and that is where we live
[1:25:55] and the atmosphere we live in it doesn't
[1:25:58] have any resemblance to the things of
[1:26:00] this world
[1:26:01] and all that's going on in the world and
[1:26:03] the music and the way they dress and act
[1:26:05] and live and the stuff that interests
[1:26:08] people
[1:26:10] just the thought process of how to get
[1:26:13] from a to b
[1:26:14] in life
[1:26:16] is lost on people today
[1:26:20] i don't understand it
[1:26:22] but i'm not supposed to
[1:26:24] because i'm not i'm not in their world
[1:26:28] i don't live in their atmosphere
[1:26:30] they don't live in milwaurs
[1:26:33] we're creatures
[1:26:34] of of heaven
[1:26:36] were creatures of a different dimension
[1:26:38] remember lot's wife
[1:26:40] look now the rapture whosoever shall
[1:26:43] seek to save his life shall lose it
[1:26:46] whosoever shall lose his life shall
[1:26:48] preserve it i tell you in that night
[1:26:50] there shall be two men
[1:26:52] now what night there the coming of the
[1:26:54] lord
[1:26:55] the rapture
[1:26:57] this speaks of an international rapture
[1:27:01] list this the rest these last few verses
[1:27:04] these last few verses speaks of an
[1:27:06] international rapture
[1:27:08] to understand this rapture is going to
[1:27:11] be an international rapture
[1:27:14] amen we know enoch went as one man we
[1:27:18] know elijah was caught up that was one
[1:27:20] man
[1:27:21] we know jesus and
[1:27:24] the
[1:27:25] the old testament saints
[1:27:30] which will go over more at length
[1:27:33] but this rapture this last day rapture
[1:27:35] is an international rapture
[1:27:38] now look
[1:27:40] i tell you in that night there shall be
[1:27:42] two men in one bed
[1:27:44] one shall be taken the other left
[1:27:47] two men shall two women shall be
[1:27:49] grinding together the one shall be taken
[1:27:52] the other left two men shall be in the
[1:27:54] field and the one shall be taken and the
[1:27:57] other left
[1:27:58] notice this international rapture at
[1:28:02] that time
[1:28:03] there'll be people in the bed
[1:28:05] there'll be people in the field
[1:28:07] and there'll be people in the grinding
[1:28:09] at the meal
[1:28:11] there'll be daytime in one place
[1:28:14] it'll be nighttime in the other place
[1:28:17] it's an international rapture it's
[1:28:19] worldwide
[1:28:20] so it might be daylight to us
[1:28:23] it might be dark on the other side of
[1:28:25] the world
[1:28:26] but it'll be god's children wherever
[1:28:28] they are
[1:28:30] international worldwide so in one place
[1:28:33] when they're in the bed
[1:28:35] and the rapture takes place one will go
[1:28:37] and one will stay
[1:28:40] that's predestination
[1:28:42] that just proves god's predestination
[1:28:44] two are there one's left one stays two
[1:28:47] women grinding one goes one stays
[1:28:50] predestination
[1:28:51] in the field one goes one stays daylight
[1:28:54] dark doesn't matter where it is
[1:28:56] amen brother brahman said he believed
[1:28:58] between six and nine some morning dead
[1:29:00] in christ shall rise amen on that bright
[1:29:02] and cloudless morning the dead in christ
[1:29:04] shall rise the glory of his resurrection
[1:29:07] share
[1:29:08] amen
[1:29:09] in the watches he talked about that
[1:29:12] but this
[1:29:13] scripture helps us understand that it's
[1:29:16] not just a few people it's not just our
[1:29:18] church it's not just
[1:29:20] tucson or jeffersonville or the united
[1:29:22] states it's around the world
[1:29:24] god has people all over the world amen
[1:29:27] his children
[1:29:29] and they answered and said unto him
[1:29:30] where lord
[1:29:32] and he said unto them wheresoever the
[1:29:34] body is
[1:29:35] thither will the eagles be gathered amen
[1:29:38] it also tells us this in matthew chapter
[1:29:40] 24
[1:29:42] amen i can read through this real quick
[1:29:43] we'll close here matthew 24 verse 35
[1:29:48] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[1:29:50] word shall not pass away
[1:29:53] but if that day and hour knoweth no man
[1:29:55] no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:29:57] father only we don't know the day we
[1:30:00] don't know the hour but we know the time
[1:30:02] the season
[1:30:03] amen i believe we're in the season of
[1:30:06] the coming of the lord how many believes
[1:30:08] that in that in that rapture cycle
[1:30:11] praise the lord
[1:30:13] body change
[1:30:14] it's bringing us to a place that
[1:30:17] at that moment in twinkling of an eye
[1:30:19] it's it's instantaneous like that
[1:30:23] but but all the
[1:30:25] all the foundation has is being laid has
[1:30:28] been laid
[1:30:30] to bring it to that place
[1:30:32] amen it's not just something that
[1:30:35] uh that that just all of a sudden god
[1:30:37] whips up no this has been going on for
[1:30:40] for for generations for years
[1:30:43] god has been getting his children by his
[1:30:45] word
[1:30:47] through the message to a place where
[1:30:50] it's
[1:30:51] it's changing her glory by glory is
[1:30:53] changing her
[1:30:55] she's becoming more and more in his
[1:30:57] image more and more in his likeness
[1:31:00] the last thing to change is the body
[1:31:03] that's the last thing that changes
[1:31:06] the redemption of the body the changing
[1:31:08] of the body
[1:31:12] no man knows the day of the hour
[1:31:14] not even angels of heaven my father only
[1:31:16] but as uh but as the days of no worse so
[1:31:19] shall also the son of man be
[1:31:21] for as in the days that were uh before
[1:31:24] the flood they were eating drinking mary
[1:31:26] and given in marriage until the day that
[1:31:27] noah entered into the ark
[1:31:29] and knew not until the flood came and
[1:31:32] took them all away so shall also the
[1:31:34] coming of the son of man be
[1:31:37] then shall two be in the field the one
[1:31:39] shall be taken the other left two men
[1:31:41] two women shall be grinding at the mill
[1:31:43] once shall be taken the other left
[1:31:46] watch therefore for ye know not what
[1:31:48] hour your lord doth come
[1:31:51] but leave nothing undone
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:55] leave nothing undone always prepared
[1:31:58] always ready live our lives
[1:32:01] live our lives as if though it could
[1:32:03] happen any second
[1:32:06] but know this that if the goodman of the
[1:32:08] house had known in that and that watch
[1:32:12] in what watched the thief would come he
[1:32:14] would have watched and would not have
[1:32:16] suffered his house to be broken up
[1:32:18] therefore be also ready for in such an
[1:32:21] hour that ye think not the son of man
[1:32:23] cometh
[1:32:24] so then as a faithful and why uh who
[1:32:26] then is a faithful and wise servant whom
[1:32:29] his lord hath made ruler over his house
[1:32:31] to give them meat in due season
[1:32:34] uh blessed is that servant whom his lord
[1:32:37] look now
[1:32:38] blessed is that servant whom the lord
[1:32:40] when he cometh shall find so doing
[1:32:45] amen what's that that's being at the
[1:32:47] post of duty
[1:32:49] that's being at the that's being at the
[1:32:51] call of god in your life whatever that
[1:32:53] is

[1:32:59] day even

[1:33:03] know that nothing that you have is left
[1:33:06] undone you're right with the lord
[1:33:10] my heart is right my soul is right i
[1:33:13] have nothing left hanging out i don't
[1:33:15] have anybody to make anything right with
[1:33:18] i don't have any sins to be repentant of
[1:33:22] i'm ready lord
[1:33:24] when you call me whatever time and
[1:33:26] moment that is even if it's even before
[1:33:28] the rapture god if you take me before
[1:33:30] then i still want to be ready
[1:33:34] i still want to be in a place where i'm
[1:33:36] ready to go
[1:33:37] whatever purpose
[1:33:39] whichever way
[1:33:41] i i want to be ready
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:44] and be found faithful
[1:33:46] faithful to whatever god's called you to
[1:33:49] just be faithful to it
[1:33:51] you don't have to be a minister you
[1:33:52] don't have to be a song
[1:33:55] leader or
[1:33:56] be out front or be heard or seen or you
[1:33:59] don't have to be some popular or just be
[1:34:02] what god's made you that's all that
[1:34:04] matters
[1:34:05] because even though it might not seem
[1:34:07] significant it might not seem like it's
[1:34:10] important every portion of the body of
[1:34:13] christ is just as important and needful
[1:34:15] as the other
[1:34:17] that's why we stand in that place take
[1:34:20] our place amen
[1:34:22] the handwriting's on the wall friend can
[1:34:24] you see it
[1:34:26] you read it
[1:34:27] see what it's saying
[1:34:29] the lord is saying i'm coming soon and
[1:34:32] judgment is on this earth
[1:34:34] judgment is striking this country
[1:34:37] and we're in the middle of it today
[1:34:39] it's hard i told you it hurts me i hate
[1:34:43] to see it
[1:34:44] but we know it's going to happen we know
[1:34:46] it has to happen
[1:34:48] they turned god down
[1:34:49] and when you turn them down there's
[1:34:51] nothing but judgment
[1:34:53] god help us handwriting's on the wall
[1:34:55] today friend but i'm ready for a rapture
[1:34:58] you ready to go in a rapture the lord to
[1:35:00] take us let's stand if we could
[1:35:16] praise the lord
[1:35:22] the day and the hour we live
[1:35:24] we see all of it happening around us
[1:35:27] it's very obvious
[1:35:31] people don't understand it yes people
[1:35:34] don't understand you
[1:35:36] people around your life they'll never
[1:35:38] they'll never understand you
[1:35:40] people don't get it and they won't get
[1:35:43] it a lot of them won't
[1:35:44] pray they that they would yeah my heart
[1:35:47] is that they would
[1:35:48] but the fact of it is most won't
[1:35:52] and they won't understand it won't be
[1:35:53] able to comprehend
[1:35:55] because they live in a different world
[1:35:58] they live in a different dimension
[1:36:01] we're
[1:36:02] we're creatures of heaven yes
[1:36:04] god has called us from this world
[1:36:07] we're ready to go home amen
[1:36:09] whatever time god calls us be faithful
[1:36:12] to the post while we're here
[1:36:14] but whatever time it is
[1:36:16] we'll do what god calls us to do
[1:36:19] amen
[1:36:20] praise the lord jesus
[1:36:25] amen i'm so thankful that god is ever
[1:36:27] with us
[1:36:28] he's our very present help in the time
[1:36:30] of trouble knee amen
[1:36:34] amen
[1:36:37] let's sing this course number four
[1:36:39] 493.
[1:36:42] amen
[1:36:44] i want to live the way he wants me to
[1:36:46] live
[1:36:48] thank you jesus
[1:36:50] today yes lord let me live the way
[1:36:53] you want me to live
[1:36:56] make it possible
[1:36:57] because friend there's no way that we
[1:36:59] could ever
[1:37:01] please the lord
[1:37:03] but outside of
[1:37:05] the ability to be able to do it
[1:37:07] it's the only way we can do it right
[1:37:09] it's the only way we can
[1:37:11] come remotely close to being
[1:37:14] right in god's eyes
[1:37:16] it's that mercy it's that blood
[1:37:19] that brings
[1:37:21] it
[1:37:21] makes the opportunity that we can do it
[1:37:24] amen
[1:37:25] praise the lord
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:41] until there's just
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:38:12] the way
[1:38:14] he
[1:38:15] wants me
[1:38:16] to live
[1:38:19] i want to give
[1:38:23] until there's just
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:40] oh
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:51] amen thank you jesus at your desire
[1:38:53] today
[1:38:55] he wants us to live
[1:38:57] live our lives to be pleasing to him in
[1:39:00] every way
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:02] praise the lord jesus
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:06] amen lord richly bless you
[1:39:09] i appreciate each one coming being here
[1:39:11] today and then a couple things i want to
[1:39:13] mention to you
[1:39:15] brother pat had finished this
[1:39:19] life span of
[1:39:22] the
[1:39:23] individuals in the bible if you want one
[1:39:25] they're back uh in on the table back
[1:39:28] there i thought it's kind of interesting
[1:39:29] especially when you look at a couple the
[1:39:32] notes that brother pat put on the back
[1:39:34] here
[1:39:35] um
[1:39:36] just things that just never dawned on me
[1:39:38] you know
[1:39:39] um i'll read you the first one here says
[1:39:41] in 9 30 when adam died
[1:39:44] noah wasn't born but all the saints
[1:39:47] lived on the earth at the same time
[1:39:50] and you look at all this adam said enos
[1:39:52] all the way down i thought wow
[1:39:54] that's that's incredible to think that
[1:39:56] through that lineage all of them were
[1:39:59] all alive there at the same time anyway
[1:40:01] i i thought it was interesting but if
[1:40:04] you want a copy of it there's a few that
[1:40:06] brother pat brought her back on the
[1:40:07] table back there
[1:40:10] and then also uh remember this wednesday
[1:40:13] night will be the first mid-week service
[1:40:15] that we start
[1:40:16] uh we're gonna have wednesday night
[1:40:18] seven o'clock
[1:40:20] uh
[1:40:21] starting this wednesday night and

[1:40:52] car and helped all of all the sisters

[1:40:59] saying we need to witness we need to
[1:41:02] talk to this man and we need to
[1:41:03] interview him and find out what happened
[1:41:05] and they said there was no man in the
[1:41:06] car that's benny perry and that was

[1:41:11] who told me that story
[1:41:13] anyway he was at the minister's meeting
