jesus amen i didn't see any prayer requests back there but we do have a few to mention uh please continue to remember sister lydia uh the family you see sister lydia is not here today uh exactly tap the state home joel's still not feeling well had to cancel his birthday party friday night because he uh got to not feeling good so uh we went to dinner wednesday night for his birthday and he had crab legs which he loves to have so he enjoyed his crab legs wednesday but then thursday and started not feeling good so they cancelled his birthday party friday night and uh he's still congested coughing zach said he still he has a little tickle in his throat some in the morning so they stayed home watching so amen god bless you let's pray for them also sister norma as some of you may know sister norma tested positive for coveted wednesday she's doing fine she doesn't have any symptoms she's got a little runny nose from the allergies and stuff so she felt fine she wanted to come but she you know the fact that she tested positive she didn't want to offend anybody or make anybody feel uncomfortable so she stayed at home and is streaming today i said well fine with me if you come don't bother me but uh you know how it is so i just uh want to make sure that um everybody's comfortable and happy and so she stayed home today and is watching so thankful for that and if you noticed on the uh uh the church group website uh sister priscilla put in a prayer request to specifically well for the family specifically two for marcos and um serenity were in the hospital or gone to urgent care

would just touch and heal that completely sometimes i see my wife get up she can't even put her foot down uh her heels hood and hurting so bad so uh just that old mean devil he's just a liar anyway all there are lying vanities symptoms amen and we know the one that dissolves all doubt yes amen that's the one that we pray to look to today and believe in the name of jesus for these requests these needs today amen so art uh and also to let you know uh brother tom and sister karen aren't here today they had some friends come into town so they went to northside to be with some of the friends that

you are mindful for each and every one you're concerned you said to ask and you shall receive the desires of your heart and father we recognize the day in the hour that we're living how the enemy is fighting us harder than ever before to get us to the place of complacency and carnality and worldliness and and just any little measure that he can try to work in our lives to get us away from you but father you're the great and mighty conqueror you're our teacher father that as we yield our spirits to you your holy spirit can come in and have preeminence father i believe as our pastor said already that there are some that believe they've got all they can from you and and they've reached their goals with you and we know that's also a lie of the devil father when our bodies are changed then i can testify by your grace i am by your grace we've made it later and lord help each and every one as they reach out by faith to acquire to receive a portion from thee that they have needed for thou art our jehovah rapha our healer our great physician you're mindful of what we go through oh father there's no reason the devil should defeat any of us your word did not only come just written but it came in power and father we reach out for your healing touch for each and every one lord that need a touch from you for you are our high priest that can be touched by the feelings our infirmities amen and with your stripes we are healed it's a finished work you have acquired for us at calvary and we claim that father we claim all that we have need of bless each and every one yes may their hearts runeth over with your holy spirit may their joys be full father and lord you know the unspoken requests you know as we raise our hands and our hearts to you you know what we have need of father help us if anything to have a closer walk to have a more dedicated walk with you to be sincere we can fool one another we can fool the pastor but we cannot fool you you know where we're lacking father and by faith our faith is in you we walk by faith not by sight and faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen and we believe father we believe our victory is in you bless our pastors and bring forth your word lord use them to speak to our hearts and let our hearts be softened and ready to receive the portion of the bread of life you have in store for us this morning father grant the lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord you could be seated if you'd like amen gonna have it on the screen in song number 314 in the book if you want to turn into the book amen psalm number 314 that's just his way telling me he loves me it is a love beyond all human understanding even our only amen praise the lord jesus listen to me him now he lets me walk down roads of discipline he watches and he knows what's best for me the more i've tried the better he can hold me and change my life well that's just his way of telling [Music] beyond all human understanding and i will question trials that bring me to my knees that's just his way [Music] he loves me if i'm successful [Music] walking through this valley [Music] you give me strength to climb the [Music] highest and my greatest strength comes through my door is and my greatest joy is knowing that he can trust in me you only sing it now that's just his way of telling me he loves me oh it's a love beyond all human understanding and i will question trials that bring me to my knees [Music] me he loves me listening at second verse again but if i'm successful walking through this valley [Music] you'll give me strength to climb the highest here and my greatest strength comes through my darkest and my greatest joy is knowing that he can trust in me amen oh that's just his way of telling me he loves me [Music] well it's a love beyond all human understanding and i trials that bring me to my [Music] he knees me oh that's just his way of telling me he loves me it's a love beyond all human understanding [Music] and i will question trials that bring me to my knees that's just his way of telling me he loves me amen amen his ways are beyond our ways aren't they saints his ways better higher better than our ways amen it's beyond all human understanding the world has tried to search for thousands of years what love is about meaning of love and they haven't even begun to scratch the surface even us as christians recognizing the love of god in our lives just barely scratches the surface amen if we can think about what the lord just did for us personally amen and how the depth of that love and how deep it would go there it's a bottomless amen praise the lord jesus he loves us amen beyond any understanding that we could have yes praise the lord jesus and i'm so thankful for that aren't you amen praise the lord amen god bless you gentlemen today amen welcome good to see our tribe come in amen lord bless you we're going to go in the scripture now if you want to stand with me and turn in your bibles we're going to go over to isaiah chapter 64. amen isaiah chapter 64. praise the lord jesus some people just can't grasp the things that god does they don't make sense to us they're not sensible but they do to him sometimes the hardest things we have in life are the best things that we can that the lord can do for us that's why we trust him that's why we trust him because he knows best but it's like that song said even through the darkest of the valleys through that valley gives me the strength to be able to climb the next mountain i wouldn't make it to the peak of the next mountain if it wasn't for the trial of the valley amen that's where we draw our strength from praise the lord isaiah chapter 64. we're going to read a couple of verses of scripture amen thought came to me during the week this week and i feel like the lord put something together for us today so trust it be a blessing to you amen isaiah 64 read a couple of verses of description before we do let's just power our heads for a word of prayer and lord jesus father truly our greatest strength does come through our darkest trials the inspired person that wrote that lord is truly a revelation to us today we thank you lord for all that you do for us every day god and so many times we we do fail to thank you for the for the trials that we go through for sometimes what we would deem as a dark hour or something that's hard on our flesh lord but god many times the things that you do for us is to mold us and to shape us and to put us in the image that you want us to be and the likeness that you would have for us and that likeness is you the only way we can do that is to have the mount the mind of christ and to mold our flesh to mold our spirits to mold us into that image that lord we might reflect that today to let the world see that the love of god to us is shot abroad in our hearts reflected to this world to show that you are still jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we thank you lord for that time we thank you for uh the blessings that you give us lord so many times and lord that that that does mean the things that sometimes are difficult to us sometimes the things we don't understand but believe that you have all things in your hands and all things are working together for our good because we love you the only way that that would work is because we do love you not because we have some affinity for you lord are we your good god today and not tomorrow or i serve you today or not tomorrow no no no it's it's an unconditional love that we have for you god it's a sharing back of that unconditional love that you have for us and that unconditional love brings us into a place of believing god the unchanging god that you work everything for our good we thank you for it lord we pray god that you bless the remaining part of this service have your way in it lord we committed to you speak through this speaker these lips lord hear with the ears of each one of us today accomplish that that you would send it forth for father as we committed to you and it is for truly your glory and honor and we thank you god for all these that have come those who may be streaming lord may you be the focal point of everything that we do and say in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen isaiah 64 read beginning with verse six read a couple verses let you be seated but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there is none that calleth upon thine name that stireth up himself to take hold of thee for thou has hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities but now oh lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou art our potter and we are all and we all are the work of thy hand you can be seated if you like and as i was going through the lord was giving me scripture thing yesterday i ran into so many ways to title this so many titles that it could be but i stuck with the thought that the lord originally gave me during the week this week and so i'm going to title this today chipping away the pieces chipping away the pieces the thought of that that came to me during this week that uh that that at the end time and we know we all believe we're at the end time i believe we all believe we're at the end of the end time that how much time we have left is hard to determine we don't know my time might be up today and that's all that really matters to me is when i'm going but the time is at hand that we know that a rapture is about to take place in a wholesale uh uh exiting exodus of a group of people is going to be with the lord jesus the world will will be without us any longer and it came to me that i started thinking about that story that uh that brother random told a couple of places and of course is documented if you go and look it up on the internet you find this documented of where it was asked about the sculptures that michelangelo did the paintings at michelangelo dibus specifically the sculptures and he talked about david he talked about moses it was specifically when it was asked about david but i believe it would apply to as he did david and he did moses and these beautiful sculptures you ever seen the picture of them just outstanding i it just baffles the mind to me anyway someone who is uh who is devoid of any kind of creativity uh when i look at it and i think how could somebody take a huge hunk of rock and make that out of it it just it baffles me it's just incredible or take a a flat nothing black wall or canvas or something and and paint something so outstandingly realistic and beautiful and uh my wife can do that it just it just baffles me how people are that gifted that god gives them and can do and so it was asked david is his sculptures are just so beautiful and just so perfect and detailed it was asked to him uh you know how how did you ever get in your mind what david looked like or how did you ever get it in your mind how moses looked like to because we don't have pictures of them and we don't know what their images are it just has to be something that that was derived out of someone's mentality out of someone's thought out of someone's heart and it was asked how did you derive these of of what you felt like a moses looked like or what you felt like a david would look like and how did you take this big huge hunk of marble and just and just cute it all out and chiseled all the way to where this beautiful sculpture comes up and none of us know what david or moses looked like but we look at it now we identify that as david we look at that and we identify that as moses what what did uh what inspired you to to knock away and chip away all those pieces to bring those images to life he said that's easy now i'm paraphrasing of course he didn't say that but but let me just paraphrase a little bit that's easy he said david was always in the marble all i did was chip away the pieces moses was always in the marble all i did was chip away the pieces all i did was knock out everything that wasn't david all i did was knock out every piece of marble that wasn't moses and when i knocked every piece of marble out that wasn't moses there was moses when i knocked out every piece of marble that wasn't david there was david praise the lord now see when you get inspired about things like that it really gives you a little revelation especially when you have uh i'm it works i got to be careful sometimes because i handle hot wires and and i get excited sometimes when things like that and thoughts like that come to me not to cross some wires and end up myself a statue but uh so i have to be careful sometimes because when things like that hit it just excites you it excites me anyway and when it's just when it's hit i thought that's exactly it see because that's that that's god god had in his mind the image of you and the image of me yes and all that we've gone through this life all that god is doing for us is just chipping away the pieces that are that that was not the image that god has in his mind that's what we're going through this shall i say refining time where uh the chisel comes out and then maybe a polishing rag or or a sander or something to finish up the last details and see i believe that's exactly what's going on today a lot of times when a sculptor or a painter or or or even when you're doing a job or making a piece of furniture or painting a wall or something you'll go around after you're done and you'll look at it and you and you find a little spot you find a little default or a a little a mistake that you made or something and you go and you fine tune it so that it so that it really comes into the way it's supposed to look like a painting or or a piece of furniture or something or an automobile or or something that you're working on or something there's always a fine tuning that's to be done all those chipping away all that that god's chipping away in our lives is just bringing into the image that he already had in his mind you were already there saints to understand this now like like we've said before uh like the prodigal son the prodigal son was a son he was never not a son he was always a son from birth in his father's lords he was always a son and nothing he did changed that amen amen nothing he did change that he was always a son in god's mind you were always there yes god just had to chip away the pieces that's not you am i that's not that image of you that god made now i'm not talking about the flesh the the spirit of i'm talking about the real you that god's seen you before the foundation of the world god's just chipping all that god just he's just chipping away anything that's not you right getting rid of anything that's not you because we collect baggage friends we know that as we're young and we grow up and we're raised and and we're taught things and we learn things and we pick up baggage here we pick up baggage there and our humanity and our carnality like brother dennis prayed we gather all this baggage up and it comes to time where there's got to be a way to to get rid of all that stuff that we form into the image that god already had in his mind it's not a miracle to say that i'm being molded and shaped into the image of god i'm the clay he's the potter right it's not a miracle at that it's just that just like michelangelo god is just taking away everything in our lives that isn't us that isn't of that image that god had in his mind and if god chips it away then it's a necessity for it not to be there there's a reason why it's not supposed to be there if god's chipping away certain things in our lives whatever it is amen we all have again baggage things that tags along in our lives that that hinders us from reaching a certain level maybe or a certain place with the lord jesus or something like that god god comes and starts chipping those things away and getting rid of those things so that we're only we are only the image that god had in his mind before the world and he does that to all of us the bride worldwide when it gets to that image just like michelangelo did with moses and moses became so in the mind of michelangelo and he became so perfectly in that image he struck him on the knee with a hammer and said speak moses a piece of marble he expected a piece of marble to speak now you know sometimes really good artists kind of live on the edge of insanity amen that's why they cut off their ears and things like that this really good artists will live on the edge of insanity i think a really good artist is a very is a very spiritual person in a lot of ways and and someone who's in that in that place that they're they're between sanity insanity and we call it insanity but if you're a christian and you're a godly holy ghost spilled person that just takes you into a gift of the spirit it doesn't make you crazy people in the world think you're crazy but it doesn't make you crazy but if you're not and you're just a everyday person or like a michelangelo or someone not a born-again christian it'll tip you right over into a place of insanity it will and these places people get to that place and and for someone to have finished that sculpture and took years and whatever it did to get rid of all the pieces that wasn't moses and then to as people would say ruin it by chipping the knee out which brother adam always said was what made it the masterpiece to him but chipping that piece of that knee out and saying speak moses well that's probably just that that that man that guilt that had had just teetered over into the place of insanity whacking a piece of marble on the knee and saying speak it wasn't without divine intervention that marble was not going to speak now could it sure god they could speak just like you did the donkey just like he could anything amen god speaks every day through stuff and a lot of times we don't pay any attention but god's always speaking god's always talking god talked to brother branham through squirrels and fish and everything else god speaks to us all the time and he could have whacked him on the knee he could have spoken but uh it was it had it it had just come to such a reality it that that image that reflection that he that michael michelangelo had in his mind in his heart that image that he had been contemplating on and working on for years had finally come to manifestation it was there in front of him to the point that that image that all the pieces finally got chipped away that came into that image that he smelled it to say speak amen amen i believe god's got a bride yes that he's bringing into his own image amen he's chipping away all of the pieces yes and now that holy spirit is coming into our lives saying speak amen now that stroke is brought upon a group of people that not only are able to but have the authority and the right and the responsibility to speak that's right that is us today we have that right we have that ability and we in my opinion have the responsibility to be speaking today speaking what the word amen amen amen is that time brother brown preached 1963 souls in prison there's that time where there's a ministry going forth that is to the total loss when jesus died of calgary and went to hell he preached to the souls that were in prison he preached to those that were in hell that were eternally doomed and had no hope he preached to the souls that were there in prison yes amen and what's happened today now brother graham said over and over how many times and and when will it be but it will be yes that time where there will be a speaking to the souls that are in prison that have no hope yes they have no chance amen now again we we i never we never want to get in our minds that that this is that time we don't know but we do know there's a time and or that that this time is that time that we are to speak to speak that word not be silent but speak but of course we speak as he speaks and silent where he's silent that's the scripture we know that that's where a lot of times people get in trouble they want to just go do something well that's okay that that zeal is beautiful that's wonderful because there's so many people that just rather sit on the sea to do nothing but the wisdom behind it amen is is what's most paramount the wisdom behind when you speak what you speak who you speak to but the ability and the responsibility is there for us to speak the holy spirit is now striking the bride it is our time it's the bride time this is the bright hour that god has given us for us to speak amen to speak the word the revealed word of the hour that others may know what the truth of that word is now whether a person accepts it or not is their choice but that doesn't negate us speaking that word amen speak amen god still chipping away those pieces look this i i went ahead and printed this out god's only provided place of worship where brother graham tells one of the one of the places he talks about the story here he talks about going to los angeles at forest lawn i guess where the statue of moses is michelangelo it's the perfect statue he said all but on the right knee there's a nick about a half inch deep i was looking and pointed it out to me he said michelangelo has spent a lifetime of trying to make uh he was a sculptor trying to make an image of moses back in his mind he had in his mind what moses should look like he had that in his heart what moses should look like and then he spent his lifetime chiseling a little here rubbing a little there stand back and look at it year after year after year he worked on it finally when it was completed he stepped back and laid his big rag on his uh uh his hammer and his hammer and looked at the statue it was such a perfect image of moses that he had it in his heart till he got so beside himself he grabbed a hammer and struck it and hollered speak amen it's called michelangelo's masterpiece the great something in that sculpture that vision that he had of what moses ought to be he was only portraying it look a great portrayal of our father a portraying of our father who in his mind had that image of you what you should be who you should be what kind of person you should be amen how we sh how close we should be to god we talked about last week the lord calling closer well the way to get closer in that image the only way to get closer to god is to come more in that image right and the only way to come more in that image is for more pieces to get chipped away when more pieces get chipped away we come more into that image we come more into his likeness then the shadow becomes more in the real all the time amen it doesn't look much like a hand when it's out here but when it gets right here the closer it gets the more it comes into that image and that shadow becomes more into the likeness of the real thing well that's what god is coming bringing it closer getting rid of anything that's not us amen just getting rid of the pieces so that we come into that very image that very likeness winning wing it away getting a win uh getting uh getting it away from us amen we are that perfect image that god had in his mind you believe that we are that perfect image that god had in his mind i believe that i am that perfect image now satan wants to try to defeat you with all the things you do wrong and all the mistakes you've made in your life and all the things you come up short on the sins and the iniquities and all this other stuff just like uh isaiah said here oh god and our iniquities have drove us away like the wind but you oh god or our father amen you are the one who is the potter of this clay you are the one that molds us and makes us into the image that you desire for us to be amen now some people could look and say well it's it's it's making it what it what it wants to be well michelangelo just said it was always there i just got rid of what wasn't it amen i prefer that yet myself amen just getting rid of everything that's not god right saint john chapter 15. so don't let the devil defeat you that way since amen amen don't let him defeat don't let him defeat your faith like that that's the one thing that wants to defeat your faith defeat you from believing who you are because if you don't believe who you are you can't believe who he is right because the two are one and that image that god had this bringing together the two becoming one again if satan can defeat you in that and get you looking at the at the frailty of your flesh in the mirror then we'll fall short right amen don't look at that look at the mirror of god's word yes amen god's word saint john chapter 15. let's go at it this way now saint john 15 1 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that bringeth not fruit he taketh away okay so that's number one every branch that beareth not every well listen this every branch in me notice that jesus said every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh it away so what is he what is he referring to you think well if that's if if that's somebody that's in christ why would he take it away you ever thought of that because jesus said every branch that's in me in him amen you notice there's a lot of people around the world that claim to be christians that call on the name jesus that say they believe him as the ultimate almighty god but yet they don't live for him they don't serve him right they don't uh preach or believe his the word well those people are people that would claim to be in christ but they're not so they're not bearing the fruits of the word if they're not bearing the fruits of the word then god gets rid of them they're not a part of the family oh yeah they still continue on but they're not a part of the family right they're not a part of of christ they're not bearing the fruits of god if they're not burying the fruits then they're not of him and if they're not bearing fruits they're gone amen he says the father taketh them away so that's number one every branch in me that beareth not fruity taketh away every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now we all know that that that purging is well if you're the tree uh the purging is not a very pleasant experience to the tree because the purging is in the tree is a cutting away of the excess and dead limbs that are hanging on keeping the tree from producing more and better fruit because the tree is supplying to all of the the roots of the and the trunk of the tree is supplying everything that every a bit of branch and fruit of that leaves that that tree needs well if there's branches just hanging on and they're not bearing any fruit what's the point of them if they're not bearing fruit then he heals them all well if he hewns them off then that gives more that gives more of what's coming from the root to that that is bearing fruit so the purging is taking away any of those things in your life the baggage the chipping away the pieces of things that's absorbing time that's absorbing energy that is absorbing your attention getting away away with those things doing away with those things so that the important parts of your life that is bearing the fruit begins to bear more fruit better fruit how do you do that by getting rid of the things that aren't bearing fruit by getting rid of things in our lives that don't bear fruit or that are bearing not good or rotten fruit or even a limb that may be hanging there that's just dead you know what dead limb still gets stuff from the tree it just isn't getting enough to keep the to keep the limb alive so the the limb looks dead you ever looked at a limb and it looks just dead there's no leaves on it no fruit on it you go cut that limb off and and when you cut it off from the main vine we'll say it still looks like it has life in it i've done that many many times i'll look at it look just as dead as it can be now sometimes i grab it snap it right off you know there's it's just gone but a lot of times you'll grab one and try to and it won't snap because it still has life there it's taking life away from the part of the tree that's producing fruit a way to make the tree that's producing fruit produce better more fruit is to get rid of that that is supplying over to that that's dead why send something of substance to that that's not producing anything get rid of it that's that's what god does to each one of us to get rid of those things those unprofitable things in your life i know as a young man as a young minister i used to engage so many times in debates and i guess you could say arguments and doctrines and things like that and i just i finally i guess i got it at least a speck of enough wisdom i quit doing that i found out that it is very unprofitable and unfruitful and unedifying to me to sit there and argue with somebody about it right i i did now i know the bible says to reason and i still talk to people in reason scripture but that's not what i'm talking about i've been in places i've been in restaurants back east where people got in ministers in such discussions and i'll say argument the whole restaurant was watching them i was embarrassed because the whole restaurant was making fun of because they were yelling at each other fussing at each other like brothers this is not edifying right look if it's something that's not edifying why are you hanging on your life why are you keeping it why is it a part of your life if it's unfruitful and unedifying if that limb is dead or dying if it's not producing fruit in your life get rid of it kill it chip away those pieces so that the rest of that tree which we are the bride tree is is producing that fruit that that the rest of your life will be more fruitful if you heal off let let's i'm not going to say anything specific but if there's anything that's uh like taking effort from your life right that's becoming unfruitful why do you leave it don't let it hang on you get rid of it you know there's the parts of your life that are more fruitful you know there's parts of your life that are more edifying that bless you more that help you bless others more you know there's parts of your life that produce more fruit well if you take it away from there to to energize the other part that is being fruitful wouldn't it be more fruitful sure it would amen shipping off the pieces bringing it to where it becomes bearing more fruit more fruit look now let's continue it's purging he purges it chip basically that's chipping away the pieces perjugate is getting rid of anything that's unfruitful or dead which is unfruitful in itself now he says now ye are clean praise the lord amen that clean is uh is in a place of uh completion of perfection we would say maturity adulthood uh completion is reaching a place of full maturity oh we get to that place where we are clean clean through what the word it says you are clean through the words which i have spoken unto you what jesus said in saint john 17 17 sanctify them through thy truth that word is the truth brother branham talked about that being sanctified finding a place of sanctification cleansing well that's what they had done they had been cleansed well when you reach that place that that god comes and you you you repent and you're you're baptizing god fills you with the holy spirit you are cleansed god is using you and your life is producing the fruit of the spirit and now the fruit of that spirit is being manifested through your spirit through your body and so it's man of crush so christ is being manifested through your own flesh through your own body manifesting to others to see yes that fruit is showing itself and your life is being fruitful is that a part of the squeeze that people talked about for years and years 30 years or more i've been uh i lose count i was i'm coming up on 35 years of preaching and ministering and i i wonder i've always had a little different take on the squeeze as i've told you but could that be a part of that that we're talking about i know brother brown talked about the squeeze the ecumenical council but there's but that thing that brings us into that place of desperation our blink brings us into that place of uh of of complete surrender to the lord and faith and belief look we know that we're heading up something that the entire world has never seen before now exceed it as we talked about there with our messages in the rapture a few times along through the scripture we know it has happened but a wholesale rapture of a large group of people has never taken place a general catching away that we're talking about now so this last day alive and remain grouped which we all are now we've had a lot that's gone on but this alive and remain group now coming together to bring this place this bride this alive and remain to a place of such faith to receive a body change and to leave this planet without tasting death it's going to take something a huge down when you get to the statue of a perfect man you recognize that when it gets towards the top of that pinnacle when it gets towards the top of that pyramid it comes to a very peak of just a point there's down when you got faith there's all kinds of room at the base of the pyramid when there's faith there's all kinds of room right but when you get up to the very top and you've reached the pinnacle of that of that agape love when you've reached that pinnacle there's not a whole lot of room but it's got to get to that place that's the place we're looking to get to to leave here yes amen to leave here to produce something again as an elaborate group to produce something that's not been produced before by a wholesale group of people an international group of people that are alive that's doing something to bring us to a place to where we live here without tasting death that's what we're looking to well if it's going to get to that place then don't you believe there's got to be some perching yeah there's got to be some fine tuning there's got to be some chipping away of those last pieces the rubbing the polishing the the getting that image to the exact perfection that god saw it to be that mystical body of jesus christ of the bride internationally all of our brothers and sisters around the world coming together to form that image of that mystical body of christ well that goes back from the first church age this alive and remain group is the one to catch that amen because the dead in christ shall rise oh yes yes we know that they're there they're ready i'm looking forward just to that day but this salivary main groups we have got to come to that place of that that that cleanness that that perfection of image in jesus christ of becoming one with him so much they don't tell the two apart above so much they don't tell the two apart that's right that's your life that's your personal life that's in each one of us individually but as a group god's doing the same thing for all of us i know the bible says the bride has made herself ready and she is because she's taking the word and she's clothing herself with it but it's god that's doing the chipping away because he's the part we're the clay he's the one chipping away the pieces sometimes we get things that are very unpleasant to us amen very unpleasant uh things that might hurt here or hurt there but it's of a necessity because without that dark trial of that valley we wouldn't have the strength to get to the mountaintop right we wouldn't have the ability the faith to get to a rapture if one doesn't happen two won't happen everybody wants to talk to the mountain experience but nobody wants to go through the valley to get to it right but it's the only way to get to it is to go through the valley amen that purging that chipping amen is that is that a part of the squeeze do we see what's going on around us today is that a part of it i don't know amen but i believe this bride she's coming into that image because faith is comes by hearing and hearing the word and no matter whether you feel it you can tell it or you can uh tell somebody else about it whatever doesn't matter the words the word faith comes by hearing if you're hearing the prove the pure true word of god being ministered or as you read it and as god reveals it to you that brings faith it's bringing faith amen when you need it it'll be there it'll be there praise the lord there's a reason for it all god is positioning this bride for that rapture he's positioning her for that rapture matthew let's go over to matthew chapter 3. michelangelo worked on that sculpture for years and years but when it finally got to that place when it was completed in his mind that image had been completed he was so overtaken he struck it god's positioning this bride the same the same way we're being positioned uh to go in a rapture god is shaping us molding us cutting away more pieces amen matthew chapter three let's uh let's read beginning with verse nine john the baptist wasn't very nice to these uh religious people and think not to say within yours let's see verse 8 bring forth therefore fruits meant for repentance in other words you you say you're one thing but you don't show that you're that right if you're going to tell me you're something prove to me you're something don't just tell it to me show it to me bring me fruits if you say you've repented give me the fruits of your repentance that's where the rubber meets the road if you will amen and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able these stones to raise up children unto abraham now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is shewn down and cast into the fire everyone that's not bringing forth good fruit we just read over and john more fruit much fruit is shewn down and cast in the fire i indeed baptize you with water we'll come at this from another way now i indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire amen amen fire fire is that purger fire is a purger fire gets rid of sin fire gets rid of germs diseases fire pur cleanses things and the holy ghost and fire does the exact same thing in your life spiritually brings the cleansing i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chap with unquenchable fire now we've got another instance now this is a wholesale separation if you will the bible says not to be unequally yoked here is a here is a wholesale separation taking place john is saying here that jesus is coming and he will baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire and his fan is in his hand now it's not a fan like a ceiling fan or a fan you push it and blows air this is a this is a winnowing fan where it's like a little basket or a fork of some kind it has a handle on it and that fan you take and you winter the widows the grain purge the grain you take it and you you you dip into the weed and you sling it up in the air it's called winnowing or purging and what it does is the chaff or brother adam called the shock amen because you know the shock cannot be heir with the weak right amen can not right not air with the wheat the shuck is a protector of the wheat the shuck hangs on the wheat for a long time and looks just like the wheat at some point in the progression of the wheat's growth but the weed and the chaff are two different things and when the week comes to a place of maturity there comes that finalization of getting the we in prepare in preparation for use and so the widowing they take the fan the winnowing fan and go in the wheat and throw it up in the air and what that does is it causes the chaff the the shock as brother branham said to fly away from the wheat so that the wheat so that the chap blows away with the wind amen uh ephesians 4 blown away with every wind of doctrine amen that shaft blows away but the wheat is grounded the wheat has found its thai post it knows where it's standing in the word it knows who it is and what its place is and so it comes as it's grounded back to the earth when the chaff gets driven away with every wind of doctrine the chaff is blown away but the wheat comes down so that the only thing that's left is the true pure grain the wheat only not the chaff so there's a blowing away of the the chipping away of all the pieces that's just still hanging on there at the end even when the even when the wheat has has been harvested and brought in it still has to go through that winnowing process to where it gets rid of all the chow off the wheat so you only have genuine wheat look what look what he said here the fan is in jesus hand amen so he's the one winning he's the one that's throwing this wheat and purging this week and he's doing it he will in his hand he will surely amen not just flippantly not just you know uh oh part-time no he's gonna thoroughly in other words there won't be one single grain that will not be purged if you belong to god god's going to continue to purge you if you don't belong to god god will just leave you alone i said this many times i've seen a lot of people leave church i've seen a lot of people quit and go off or do things reject this message and whatnot i said and i've told you could ask my wife no i don't tell anybody specific but you can ask us and now now you'll see if this person is really a child of god and they're leaving they're leaving the truth they're leaving the message they're leaving christ they'll they will be miserable yes they're a lot everything in their life will go wrong almost everything in their life will go wrong now if they're not because god's gonna bring that person back where they're supposed to be now they may refuse it now we know brother ram tells us about times uh where people absolutely they still refuse it and god takes them god talked to brother brahm talked about and i know i'm going to miss some of the details but a man that drowned to death because uh uh because he let's just say he went before his time you know brother ham said you could go before your time but this but the reason that is is is because this person was not living for god and they were supposed to be and they were a child of god now i don't think this is a majority of people but this does happen brother branham taught us that it does that that there will be people sometimes that will just they just won't do it and their lives will be miserable their lives will be missed i believe my brother was one of those people my brother when he was a young boy he went to church all the time he was faithful as baptist church but he was faithful even when he was a young man felt he had a call in his life he went to my dad and said he felt he had a call in his life and my dad was very supportive and helpful and whatnot of course that time you were supposed to go to a seminary or whatever he was too young for that but you know you get to that place you're supposed to go to a seminary or something and become a baptist preacher minister whatever well he went on a little with his life and he got away from god and he neglected the call and he didn't follow through or do anything with it and he got married and his wife and they were living whatever life and stuff and uh and he just went away from god from that time his whole life friends i'll tell you his whole life was miserable except for one little portion he found a nice wife he had a boy and and god took her my brother was out driving a truck he was in boston or somewhere his wife died at home god took a car his next wife's next wife he married out three or four times he got married been burned when he was a kid he got burned 80 he had second and third degree burns over 80 of his body in 1967 something like that 80 of his body second third degree birds his flesh was just falling off his body he was supposed to die i remember being in the hospital the doctors and people wheeling my mother around on a wheelchair she couldn't even walk so distraught my brother was burning weeds in the back of his yard one time and he had a rag hanging out of his back pants and the rag caught on fire burned up his back of course that just brought him back to flashbacks he'd just get on the road to start walking my brother would he just walked he just he would just teeter over into that insanity and he just we just walked just aimlessly no purpose no reason he'd come back to himself he was delivering drugs one time he had a van he moved up into the mountains of north carolina but the job was down in charlotte so you had to drive back and forth all the time so he would drive down real early in the morning and pick up the drugs for drug stores not illegal drugs he'd pick up the drugs at the at the pharmacy wherever it was to distribute him to and deliver him to the drug stores and work his way all back up home again one time he was going around uh the mountains in north carolina my brother was a stickler about about the speed limit he went to speed limit all the time he wore his seat belt as religiously as any human i had ever seen in my life up to that point he wore his seat belt every single time he got in that van every time i never saw my brother not put his seat belt on for some reason when my brother when he was going through those mountains he did not have his seatbelt on nobody knows why he doesn't remember not having it on but it wasn't on and he went around one of them curves in the mountains of north carolina 50 miles an hour and a drunk coming hit him head on at 65. head-on the impact was so hard it threw him into the back of the van without a seat belt it was just one little just one little seat one little smaller than that just one little seat that you could sit in it says nothing there to hold it threw him in the back of the van but he hit him so hard his right shoe was stuck where the gas pedal was that truck that car hit him so hard it actually ripped the shoe off his foot didn't break his foot but took the shoe off his foot his shoe was so hard i had to go to the van and pick his shoes up it was so stuck in there i had to grab it and work my way to get that shoe out it was stuck in there so hard the lord spared his life again he was supposed to have his seat thrown on get out of his seat but only being crushed to death the lord spared him again but my brother's life was miserable miserable miserable miserable he'd have one sickness have another he'd have one miserable marriage after another he'd have another failure marriage after another son left and daughter didn't want anything to do with him he had a miserable i hate to say it that way but it's just the truth my brother had a miserable life and he he died 10 years ago or so probably longer than that time goes by so fast uh of a stroke died he went into a coma i said god don't take my brother till i know he's ready he was supposed to die that day he lasted a week and i felt a peace in my heart just like i did my sister i said okay he was gone that day passed away that day but he lived a miserable life god tried over and over and over to get his attention brother brown talks about that man who died he said why so and so did this happen he had started drinking and stuff said god took him home before he got too far out or something like that before he got too far away god took him home he died before his time but because he wasn't serving the lord people take that sometimes to seed and say well you can just die anytime no no no god's in control of these things don't don't forget that god's in control of this amen but but if you get so far out and you belong to him god will bring you home before you get so far out there's no coming back and god will allow and people will go because we're free moral agents to go out and like i said before you can ask my wife i've told her i said we'll see now if that person's life just goes all nice and rosy and fine and they're doing great and things are wonderful in life or things get better you know the rich young ruler when he turned god down he got richer right his life didn't get miserable he got richer so he found out he where his demise was where he ended up so we know he wasn't a child of god he got richer had to build more barns he had to tear down perfectly good barns to build bigger ones to hold all of his stuff but he wasn't one of them but you see and i've seen it before too people's lives will become so miserable that they will come back god wants to bring that person back where they're supposed to be their life will be miserable if they leave him amen if they leave him and that's where a a lot of people come to if a person leaves him their life gets miserable and they're just god's just trying to draw you back yes god's just trying to bring you back to where you're supposed to be and i should say most of the time it happens that way right amen it happens that will we come back to who we're supposed to be who god made us in the beginning what that image is that god saw he wants it to be that way yeah sometimes people have a hard time with that purging sometimes things of life get so hard they just can't stand it anymore and they leave sometimes those people leave because they're not god to begin with they look at romans 8 28 and they say this says it's supposed to work together for my good but it's only for those who love god amen if you don't love god it doesn't work right and people say oh i love god but then they they don't obey his word they don't live for him they don't do what the word tells them to do they they don't live by the dictates of his work how can you love somebody and then not obey them especially if they're to be your lord your master well you don't you say you do but you don't a lot of people just have an affinity for god oh they like god when when he's doing good for him and when everything's going great but when things are bad then then they turn their back on i've seen it so many times when things start going wrong in people's lives they quit going to church right the timings you come to church the most that should be the time you should cinch up that much tighter and get in there and fight that good fight get the strength from your brothers and sisters and from the ministering of the work and grow that strengthen because when you get to that next mountain you're going to be able to climb it right amen it's hard yeah it's hard but you got to understand it all works together for our good because we love him that's agape unconditional love so that no matter what happens lord i believe you i trust you that's hard especially when you're sitting there watching your first son die when you when you watch your first son take his last breath and you quote that someone had come up to me and quoted that scripture to me i might have punched him in the face i was hurt saints i'll be honest with you a lot of times people don't want to be honest that's just the truth i was hurt i was mad i was crying so uncontrollably i couldn't stop the water coming out of my eyes that hurt but you know you get to the place where you you find who you are you recognize what the blessings god has done for you and you finally like job did the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord amen and i'm thankful because the lord took our first son but then he gave us two children just like job job lost doubled what he lost to start with because then he had the other on the other side now we got our first son is on the other side waiting on us amen praise the lord amen jesus purging his floor now that's the part i was getting to before i started that uh purging his floor he will thoroughly purge his floor his floor these threshing floors were a uh or a a portion of ownership or identity a threshing floor was a place of identity and when it says that jesus thoroughly purged it's his floor that he's purging he's not concerned about and that might not be the right way to say it to not be misunderstood but it's like i said before me and my wife were responsible for our children if our neighbors children acted up that's their parents issue to deal with not mine amen now if they were in my house i would straighten them out but it's not my responsibility to raise other people's children god is responsible to his own he's not responsible to those that aren't his own if they're on his purging floor he's responsible for them he is the winner of his own not that not it's not his that's why i say it if they come in and they part of church and they leave and they they neglect this and they they turn their backs on god and the message whatever and their lives get better or greater or they're all happy and everything's fine i'll worry about that yes yeah that's the worst in my opinion that's the worst sign a person can have that they're not a christian they're not they don't belong on his floor because god will purge his floor god will continue to drive away that chaff away from his wheat as long as it takes it is whatever he has to do to do it but if it's not his floor it's not and i have a hard time saying this without it being misunderstood but it's not his responsibility they're not his understand so if they go out and they belong to him they're his responsibility that's his floor he's going to do the purging right he's going to do the winnowing amen because if we belong to him praise the lord well i just leave that's it's his floor and he'll gather his wheat into the gardener but he will burn up the chapel with unquenchable fire yes amen so where does that come to he said he will oh yeah you get to get to the white throne judgment who do you think is the one pronouncing that that satan and his followers go to hell who do you think is pronouncing that judgment he is you know amen remember the shock is not heir with weak amen the wheat belong to him the wheat are his amen praise the lord let me read this modern events made clear by prophecy the shuck held it but now the shock pulls away shut pulls away the shock pulls away it has to amen and remember 20 years has passed by and no more denominations has come out of this message and it won't we're at the end of denominations the wheat has taken its shape but what's the matter with the wheat now it must lay now we're at this end time now the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen to ripen before the combine picks it up before the combine picks it up it has to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen the presence of the s-o-n to ripen before the combine cuz so that would be the last process in this uh in this winnowing to bring the wheat to maturity to bring it to a place of use it's the last process laying the presence of the sun is the last process before the before it comes comes by to be picked up amen that's the last thing are we in that time yes this bride she's laying in the presence of the s.o.n waiting for that combine waiting for that call waiting for that time you know it used to be a time where before they had smelters that they would take the gold and they would the goldsmith would take the golden he would take a hammer and he would beat that gold and beat the gold and turn it over and turn it over and beat it until it until he can see his own reflection in it that's where you can see the purity of a metal by seeing your reflection in it and that beating would get all the dross all the material all of the pyrite anything that was in it that didn't belong there would be beaten out with the with the with the a beater's hammer would get rid of all the dross and all the thing out of the and it was done so that the man could see his own reflection that's what god is doing for us is getting rid of anything chipping out all the pieces that don't that aren't a part of that reflection that we reflect christ getting rid of everything that's not that reflection so that whatever's left is nothing but him am i amen that's all that needs to be left it's just him yes he gets rid of everything but him yes chipping away like michelangelo chipping away everything that's not david amen yeah we still have some refining god's still working on us god's still chipping away some pieces here and there god help us yes amen sometimes there are little things sometimes there but you know it's the little foxes that spoils the vibe yes sometimes just little things sometimes just bigger things sometimes it's hurtful things but god does it for a reason because he's getting us to that place of of a pure reflection of christ yes amen so when god looks at us he sees himself yes praise the lord let's stand if we could paul said despise not the persecutions the chastities of the lord even when we take communion he talks about it amen when we take communion he says that we don't take it unworthily so that we're not condemned with the world we judge ourselves so that we're not condemned with the world yes amen so when we judge ourselves we fix whatever whatever may be ungodly get rid of anything it's not like him yes amen so that we're not condemned with the ungodly praise the lord amen let's sing this little course again that we had sang earlier amen he didn't throw the clay away thank god he did amen you know he could have maybe he he had every right to but he loves us so much amen he loves us so much he just in his patience just molded us and shaped us amen aren't you thankful for that over [Music] a vessel i am today and it's all because jesus didn't throw the oh it's over and over he molds me and makes me [Music] a vessel of honor i am today it's all because jesus didn't throw the clay away one more time [Music] over and over he molds me and makes me [Music] a vessel of honor i am today it's all because jesus didn't throw the clay away amen a vessel of honor i can be today because he didn't throw the clay away the only reason only way that we could be vessels of honor vessels for him today yes just because he was patient loving kind and continues to mold us and shape us into his image into his likeness praise the lord brother branham said we are privileged to be invited to mold our character to meet his praise the lord i believe that's a challenge we all should be willing to take yes amen undertake because you know as the lord moves and shapes and chips molds you know we we could be resistant we can be resentful we can be hard-headed but we can say yes lord yes lord remember the flesh of jesus went to the garden three times three times to ask if the cup could pass from it yes amen now obviously none of us have anything as severe as being crucified on a roman cross but three times so you think about that yes god help us amen lord just let my will be molded to be yours yes let your image be reflected through me let you be able to see yourself in me it's all the pieces that aren't i will say newton bennett but it's not newton bennett it's whoever whoever i really am newton's just the name my parents gave me as a human here but whoever i am that molded that chip those pieces away that that reflect that image that he saw in his mind amen and truly look as as michelangelo worked on that statue to my opinion i was in the man's mind but to my opinion as he chipped on that marble i don't believe he ever saw anything but david amen i don't believe you ever saw anything but moses that's all he ever saw as he chipped and shipped and shipped he didn't see him he didn't see a hunk of marble he saw moses yes he saw david god didn't see you as you came into this world speaking lies he saw you as the image in his mind and as the pieces get chipped away that's all god ever sees because you're always a son yes never not a son i love that i just love that never not a son always a son no matter what you did what you went through what happened where you are what always a son if you were ever a son always a son praise the lord so thankful god doesn't see all the other stuff he just sees that emphasis yes amen praise the lord amen god bless you love you appreciate you i pray something was said to bless and strengthen you in some way today amen remember the prayer requests we had those who weren't with us today stressing the lord's hand upon each one and bring them back the next appointed time but appreciate each one of you being here and being with us today yeah i'll give a short testimony about what you said so when i was in prayer this morning a woman came to my mind who had been two years ago when alejandro died i went away to another state and and i met a woman who was giving a word of knowledge and other things to people just as they wandered in and out prayer room and when i came up to her she just started speaking to me and then she said she finished by saying wrap your arms around me and love on me like you would on jesus and the lord reminded me of many times that i've been in the service and i had just i just hugged him i didn't care who was looking i didn't care he was there and i was hiding and jesus reminded me of this woman this morning she was wearing pants and she looked about as worldly as you could look dressed like a man she had her hair back and god reminded me of god in the woman and how he was working on her and we don't always see that when we look at each other and i just it would just really bless me this morning and i want to bless you with it amen that's the truth too sister yeah we should we should see god in one another yes not just in ourselves but in one another amen that's true praise the lord amen i agree with that i appreciate each one of you that uh if you did uh mention something i put out a
