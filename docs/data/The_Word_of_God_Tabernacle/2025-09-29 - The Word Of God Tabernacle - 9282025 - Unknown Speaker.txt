Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. God bless you. Welcome to the house of the Lord today. There's a few still on their way.

We're so thankful for you, Lord. And we're thankful for your spirit in our lives. Thank you for leading and guiding us and helping us, Lord, along our journey, Lord. We know this journey, the time of this journey is running short. We know the world, God, is basically gone into chaos. It's gone into a a place, Lord, where there's just, as much as I hate to say it, there's just no return. &gt;&gt; But Lord, there is a return for your bride. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that is after you purify this world. That is after you get rid of all the sin, the degradation where even the atmospheres explode, Father, to make it a place fit for your holy children and a holy God to come and live again and rule and reign. Oh, what a wonderful time it'll be. Father, give us your grace once again today in this service. May you move in a supernatural way in our midst, God. For we need you desperately today &gt;&gt; to bless us, to strengthen us, to help us, to heal us, to comfort us, to give us your grace. Once again, we commit this service into your hands. We pray Lord as we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt, hinder, and infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory, honor, and praise for all that is said and done. Take full control, Lord, of every one of us at this service that all is said and done. May it be to you, Lord, for a sweet smelling Savior. We commit it to you now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord.

Got a few prayer requests to mention to you today. We're so glad to see Brother Ralph with us today, brother. God bless you, brother. Glad to have you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gotta bring Tim with you next. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Sister Lydia sat in that seat right behind you. &gt;&gt; That was her seat. The one right behind you. She took that seat every time she was here. So, Amen. Still miss her very much. But glad to have you, brother. Amen. Love you. Appreciate you. Brother Danny, as I uh texted you yesterday, is in the hospital. Uh we had prayer for him last week. His left foot, big toe on his left foot is extremely infected. Brother Dennis told me, uh, have you heard, have you had any more updates? &gt;&gt; No update. So, I can just give you what Brother Dennis told me then. Um, but he's in the hospital. Brother Danny's in the hospital. Uh, they're expecting they're going to have to take his left toe off, his big amputate his left big toe. Uh, brother Dennis said depending on how the antibiotics go and how it progresses, they may have to take all of his toes off of his left foot. So, please pray for brother, excuse me, brother Danny, if you would. He is desperately in need of our prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, just pray for him. Uh, what hospital is he? &gt;&gt; TMC. &gt;&gt; TMC. Amen. So, let's please remember brother Danny in prayer. He is a part of us. He's been here for many, many years. We love him. miss him when he's not here. Amen. But just pray that the Lord bless him and amen to touch him right now. Also, our precious little Alice fell yesterday and skinned her knee up or was it Friday? &gt;&gt; Yesterday she fell yesterday. Skin her knee up really bad. Uh Sharia text me and said that uh as she was trying to sleep uh she couldn't get to sleep. She was dizzy waking up and maybe had a little vertigo or something and just couldn't sleep. Sure, I was up with her. So, they stayed home today. Please remember them in prayers. Good to see sister Sheila and little Gabriel. Amen. Good to have you, buddy. Amen. Good to see you. Praise the Lord. But please remember sister Alice in prayer if you would. Also, u you want to remember brother Sister Pat in prayer. Got to visit with brother Pat Friday. He came by and spent some time here in the I guess office desk here um for a few hours Friday. So yeah, he seems to be doing good. He had an eye appointment. They put some drops in his eyes, so it was a little blurry, but uh the doctor said his eyesight was coming along. He was doing really well. He felt really good about it. Uh Sister Pat seriously needs needs very much Well, they both do. Uh they've both kind of entered into a transition period now uh where they're planning on selling their place and moving in with Rachel, their daughter, his daughter together and so she can try to look after him and take care of them. Uh and Sister Pat really needs our prayers that she regain her appetite. Uh she hasn't been eating, but please remember her in prayer. It's been a little difficult. Brother Pat told me, I hope this is okay, but brother T Pat told me that she fell the other day. Um, and because she was going to get up, go to the doctor with him, she fell and he wasn't able to get her up and she wasn't able to get herself up. So, a little at a time with an ottoman with a lower chair into the bed was able to finally eventually get into the bed. So, uh, please pray for them. They're going through a tremendous uh, change in their lives and of course healing in their bies. So please remember them in prayer. They desperately certainly desperately need our prayers. U the Lord will just touch them. I have not heard from sister Julie also text me said she did not get any sleep. Uh she was going to uh try to stay at home and get some rest today. So please remember her in prayer. She wanted me to say hello to Gabriel for her. So, in case I forget, after church, uh, Sister Julie said hello. She you'd been on her heart this week. So, it really touched her heart when you gave her a hug last week. So, but please pray for Sister Julie. Also, I didn't hear from Sister Norma. Not sure. Maybe she's just running a little late. So, I did not hear from Steve or Anna either. Uh, this is usually their off week. So, please remember them in prayer. Did not hear from them. So, We're just thankful the Lord's here. &gt;&gt; Glad to have Michael back to each one of you today. And we also want to remember um I failed to mention last week, so please forgive me, but I'm sure all of you already knew that brother Eddie Bisll, Edward Bisl, passed away a week before last. Uh, so I failed, excuse me, I'm sorry, but failed to mention it last Sunday, but please remember his family and church, all those affected by brother's passing. Of course, we're all getting to the age. Uh, you know, you just keep getting up there in years. And finally, those years uh those years take you and the Lord says, "Time to come home." &gt;&gt; Uh, it just signals to me though uh another soldier from the cross, another one of that generation. Uh, it kind of reminds me of Exodus, doesn't it? Another one of that generation is gone away now. Uh, so it's the new generation with Joshua that took that uh took that promised land. So, praise the Lord. Went over Jordan into the promised land. So, another one of that generation has passed on. There aren't many left. As far as I know, I think brother Charlie Cox is still alive. Uh, but I'm not sure there's many. I'm um talk to Brother Roger about that. I do. But, uh, they're they're going away, saints. And so, uh, that just signals something scripturally to me along with everything else we've been talking about. &gt;&gt; Like, uh, me and Dennis were talking, uh, we had lunch Thursday, uh, about I had mentioned to you about the turning point and, uh, Charlie Kirk had 3,200 uh, chapters of turning point in the country. I told Last week, the requests now have gone up to 65,000 requests. Not 6,500, 65,000. I heard as of Thursday, haven't heard since we talked about it, it was it was over 150,000. The last I heard requests. 150,000 requests. They're expecting to have a chapter of that group in every high school and college in the country. &gt;&gt; It that's just you talk about again Matthew 25, you talk about a a move of that nominal that nominal church saints uh that that nominal virgin. We're we're I just I can't help that just keeps coming back to me over and over again. So uh we just keep that in mind too. Keep that in heart. The Lord knows. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So &gt;&gt; amen. But that's all I have for prayer requests. Anyone else have anything on your heart? &gt;&gt; Yes. This Thursday will have a surgery &gt;&gt; and Um just pray that all go well by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. October second remember that for his wife Leah. Anyone else have an unspoken request and I'll stand. &gt;&gt; We're going to ask brother Dennis if you would take these. Lord Jesus, it's an honor once again to be in your house of worship, your house of prayer, &gt;&gt; your house with your word can be preached without compromise with the revealed word coming forth that has been delivered through your mighty prophet, brother Brandham. The shout to get a bride ready for &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord. And Lord, help us to always be in the spirit. Them that are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us to examine our hearts daily. For we know the enemy is fighting us harder than ever. The greater he that's in us than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. And you also said and you gave us that promise, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we have to have that faith to totally trust you in our lives for everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have to have the faith to believe that you could come any day now. that there's a bride that is walking in the precepts of your word, Father, that is Lord. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not ashamed of the gospel. And Lord, help us to love one another that much more. &gt;&gt; Grant it, God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Knowing that John says, we owe nothing to one another, but to love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, yes. Thank you, Jesus. Even with the people that are needy this morning, if we don't have your love, our prayers will be like a sounding uh uh drum and a tingling symbol. Lord, let us sincerely love one another. Unseen love as Paul said. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are needs this morning, my brother. It's a very serious situation, Lord. They might have to amputate all his toes, but we know that you're still our healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our Jehovah Rafa that can be touched by the feelings of our our infirmities. &gt;&gt; And with his stripes, we are healed. And we claim and believe total deliverance um for my brother going through this uh sepsis that's in his body and this um uh bad condition with his toes.

He's getting ready to do another job. give him strength throughout the week and use him once again, Father, uh to bring forth your word, knowing that faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God. It's not a time to play church. It's not a time to just uh be laxidasical in our walk with you. If we're not right, we're going to find ourselves in the great tribulation. Ask my heart daily, Father. May speak to all our hearts. In your precious and holy name we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. You can be seated if you praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Psalm number 675 in the book. Amen. Psalm number 675. We'll have it on the screen here for you. Praise the Lord at Calvary. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So thankful that it was all paid for for us at Calvary. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. 675. Now, let's sing. Years I spent in vanity and pride, caring not.

Where would we be without? &gt;&gt; Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The place where he paid it all. &gt;&gt; The place where he took my place. The place that changed everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a place that devil thought he had it. It was the place where the devil literally thought he had Jesus. &gt;&gt; I imagine he thought, "I've got him now. He's hanging up there and he can't come down." Oh, he could have, but he chose not to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he had you and me on his mind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He looked through history and he saw those that was to be purchased back to him. Amen. And though he could have called 12 legions of angels, he stayed there and he hung and died in shame at that precious place. &gt;&gt; And when he was done, he said, "It is finished." Praise God. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. You know, I'm trusting and praying one of these glorious days. Amen. &gt;&gt; We may be laying on a death bed. We might. &gt;&gt; But we can lay there and say, "It's finished." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I did what the Lord sent me here to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I run my race. I finished my course. &gt;&gt; Amen. ready to go meet him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's stand if we could. 28. And we're going to start on the five-fold ministry. This will be the last section as far as I know right now will be the last section uh of this series, the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. I saved it kind of last because so many times when people talk about adoption and position and placement in God, they always put those ministry positions up first and out front. And truly, ministry positions are out front and seen and heard more than anybody else. But &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're no more important. Amen. They are no more important. This five-fold ministry is no more important than every single person in their position in that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to talk about that place today. Amen. The five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord if we could. So now Romans 8. Going to begin reading with verse 14. But let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer if we could first. Thank you, Lord Jesus, again for feeling your presence and knowing that you're here, Lord, that you're real, God, that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, you're in our lives, leading and guiding us and helping us along the way, giving us strength, Lord, along this journey. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your blessings and love to us, watching over us and keeping us. Now, as we approach this precious sacred word, Lord, we pray that you would reveal to us what you'd have us to know and see in here. Lord, we may have read this portion of scripture many, many times, hundreds of times even, but Lord, that doesn't mean you can't reveal something in there to us, &gt;&gt; Lord. Even now, God. Even after we've read it before every service in this in this uh series, Lord. Uh even now, God, let's just I don't want to read it just as words on a page, but Lord, if there's something in there you want us to see, even now, God, reveal it to us. Show to us in there what you'd have us to see and know, God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, we just thank you, Father, for the word, for the revelation, the word, for a prophet of God, Lord, who would come into this world and basically sacrifice everything, Lord, to bring this message to a to a bride for this last day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the grace that you give us every day, Father. It is amazing, God. We commit the remaining part of this service now into your hands and pray that your Holy Spirit would have its preeminence. Open my mouth to say those things that would be your will, Lord, and shut them to anything that you would not have me to say today. May you have full control of all of us hear and speakers alike. We commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." &gt;&gt; The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. As we uh delve into this uh portion of the uh adoption as we read that and see that that the Lord give us. Amen. We want to go over and turn over to Ephesians. Amen. And and uh get over Ephesians starting here of that five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that five-fold ministry uh that the Lord uh has given us in this last day. Amen. So, Ephesians chapter 4, just read a couple of verses of scripture here. Amen. As the Lord would would show it to us. I want to start with verse one. Ephesians 4:1. Amen. Amen. We'll just read down through just see where the Lord takes us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4 uh verse one. I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another forbearing one another in love. &gt;&gt; And that's that's kind of a tough saying. Uh it's not something that most people would like to hear. Uh most people uh I would venture to say probably all of us are not in favor of being meek or lowly or longsuffering. Uh you know longsuffering means to suffer long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, nobody wants to suffer at all. Must less long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we must suffer long for what? Not me, but for one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I suffer for you. You suffer for me. &gt;&gt; We suffer for one another. The Lord suffered for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And still And still his longsuffering is beyond anything I can comprehend. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as he does, we are &gt;&gt; we long suffering. Forbearing. That also means to suffer. Forbearing one another in love. That also means to suffer with one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be suffrage if you will. endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. You know this is the only place in the scripture where the word endeavoring is used. The only place in the Bible where endeavoring is used. To in endeavor, amen means to strive means to be diligent. It means to press forward, if you will. To to press forward. Endeavor. Amen. to delve into uh uh uh deeply to work at to endeavor. Amen. So this this is this is can I say this is a job. &gt;&gt; This is work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is it work? Why why would it be work for me to endeavor to keep a unity of the spirit of peace, the bond of love? &gt;&gt; Why would that be so endeavoring? Because that endeavoring with the spirit of God in us is contrary to everything our human nature wants to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh we none of our humanity wants none of our carnality wants to endeavor with anybody, suffer with anybody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Be meekness. There's there's nothing about the human spirit that wants to be meek or lowly. the the human spirit as you notice for those without the Holy Spirit uh out in the world that everyone wants to be first. Everyone wants to be the best. Everyone wants to be the most known. Everybody wants to have the most popularity. Everybody wants most have the most power, have the most money. &gt;&gt; Amen. People want to be out and up and front and forward. That's human nature. Human nature wants to So you overcome the human nature. You unco you overcome the carnality by by by the loneliness of the spirit in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By the by the suffrage by the work by the endeavoring by the diligence that we give the work that we put into making sure that we can keep a unity of the spirit. It's work keeping the unity of the spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because human nature wants to say well if they don't believe like me then I don't want to have anything to do with them. In fact, a lot it's come to the place, at least in this country today, if you don't if people don't agree with you, they're just going to kill you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I mean, that's just just just becoming the way it is daily today. &gt;&gt; Uh I I think there's been shooting there's been shootings every day this week. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's been hatred and and murders every day this week. I just heard this morning coming over here that uh some man went into I I guess it was Mormon a church a Mormon church I think it was shot up a bunch of people and set church on fire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh just yesterday a guy in North Carolina from a boat shot up a restaurant. I think he maybe hurt some people killed. I don't know what happened. I haven't had time to look at all of it. Just the headlines I've seen. &gt;&gt; Amen off the coast of North Carolina. And we all know so many of things that's happened up to that time. The shooting in Dallas and killing a a a migrant uh that was held detained by ICE. Shot shot up the van, killed killed a guy, hurt a couple people. Amen. It just it it just got to the place that, you know, if if if you don't agree with me, uh then I I hate you. If you don't agree with me, I'm going to shoot you. I'm going to kill you. You don't deserve to live if you don't believe the way I do. &gt;&gt; That's where humanity's gotten to &gt;&gt; in a lot of ways. Now, not everybody. It's I would say it's more or less a fringe uh part of humanity, but it's still gotten that place. You said, "Well, that sounds awful bleak." Well, that's why the Bible tells us to endeavor &gt;&gt; to keep unity of the spirit. Endeavor work to work to keep the unity of the spirit. So many times it seems like we're we're so divided. Now, not each church. A lot of times, uh, we're pretty united in our little group here and maybe Tucson Tabernacles, they're probably fairly united in their group over there and Brother Rogers probably, you know, and Brother Doug and different churches just around in this city are probably fairly united within themselves. But how about the uniting of all of us together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about the uniting of that brother with that brother or that sister with that sister, that pastor with that pastor, that church with that church? You hardly see that. &gt;&gt; And it's getting to the place that it's not just here. &gt;&gt; It's getting more so to the place that it's in infecting uh the country. But see, that's the devil. That's the spirit of the enemy that tries to get in there. That's why it's work to keep unity. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to strive at it. You have to endeavor for it because the devil wants to do everything but keep you united in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And how do we keep you united in the spirit? in the bond of love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Above all things, above anything else, above any divisions, above any disagreements, above anything that I might not like about you or you might not like about me, I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Above anything else, I love you. Amen. And I can say that to anybody. Now, it might not be uh, you know, the kind of love I have for my wife, for example, but I love everybody. there. There's nobody that I want to see go to hell. There's nobody I want to see bad things happen to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nobody I I love every I love every human. I want to try to do anything I can to help any human that I can. Amen. Now, sometimes love's corrective. A lot of times, especially, love is corrective and it's it's not the the affectionate kind of love that a lot of people misconstrue love for. Most people just think that love is just the affectionate, but it's corrective. But that that doesn't mean I don't love them. &gt;&gt; And that's of course a lot of people are blinded to that. But we we work to keep the to keep endeavoring. We endeavor to keep a unity of the spirit. Amen. And the bond of peace above everything, friends. Above everything, I love you. Period. No matter what I disagree with or whatever, I love you. Amen. And that's the way it should be in the body, especially in the body of Christ. It should be that way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is one body. Fourth verse. Now, there is one body and one capital S spirit. Amen. That's his spirit. That's God's spirit. Not a third person in the trinity, but God's spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One spirit. Even as you are called and one hope of your calling. Now he's talking about being called three times. He talked about make sure that you walk worthy of your vocation. Amen. Which is your choosing, your picking. God's handpicked you. Vocation calling wherewith you are called. Amen. As God has called you. Now he says in one body, one spirit. Even as you're called, that calling is what? To the body. There's that one body and one spirit. And our calling is for that one body. Amen. &gt;&gt; In that one spirit unto the Lord. The Lord calls us in that spirit and one hope of our calling that we are called in that we are supposed to walk worthy in that we are supposed to fulfill. That when it comes our time, we can say the exact same thing that Jesus did. It is finished. Amen. He had a work to do. Correct? He did what he was supposed to do. And when he did what he was supposed to do, he hung there and said, "It is finished." Praise the Lord. His finish is a lot greater than my finish because he purchased all of humanity with his blood. But we all have that part to play to say it is finished. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The place where we get when we get on the other side, he says, "Well done, my good and faithful servant, entering into the joys of the Lord." Well done. It's finished. Paul said, "I shun not to declare unto you the whole council of God." Now, what does that mean? That doesn't mean Paul preached every single segment of the scripture. But what it does mean is everything that God gave him to bring, everything that God had him to do, everything that he was to fulfill in a as a prisoner of Christ, he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what that means. That's what in in all of our lives is what that is what that is to mean to us that we fulfill that we say then we can say it is finished. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That was in one hope of our calling of your calling of your adoption of your placement of your position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fifth verse now one Lord. Amen. That is indisputable although a lot of people will &gt;&gt; uh even though the Bible you know the Bible in several places refers to God as Lord and Jesus as Lord. Well, if there's only one Lord, then how can God and L and Jesus both be Lord? Because they're one. That's the only way. That's why the scripture says there's only one Lord. Amen. Because there's only one God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just, you know, the more you search the scripture, if you if the Lord reveals it to you, it's it's so simple. People talk about how complicated it is and how it contradicts and how all these people of all these years, I watched a couple of interviews that Charlie was talking to some kids and they would they would question about the Bible. And I heard uh one recently that said, you know, the the the Bible not written by God. A bunch of men wrote it. He said, "But a bunch of men that were under the influence of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. But there were all these men over this time. They they they they were over years. They didn't know each other. And uh I would have liked to have said, "Well, that makes the Bible more prophetic to me because every bit of it for men that didn't know each other for it to dovetail so perfectly together, Genesis to Revelation of these men who wrote it and didn't know one thing about each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. didn't live together. I mean, then it could have been more misconstrued. But you can't now to recognize to look over here and see what David said about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just the several places that he wrote, "Oh, they pierced my hands and my feet." He didn't know anything about that. &gt;&gt; But look what happened in the scriptures. It just coincides so perfectly together. That's why it's so beautiful. There's one Lord. Amen. One faith, one baptism. Amen. That means that Jesus Christ and Peter did not contradict each other. It can't because there's only one baptism. Amen. &gt;&gt; One God. Not two, not a dozen, not three. One God and father of all. Amen. Now, does that mean that there's a God and a father? But people try to use the conjunction the conjunctions to try to separate them. No, he's God and father because he's one God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I one God and father of all who is above all, through all, and in you all. But unto everyone is uh every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. And I'm thankful for that grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore of the gift of the Holy Spirit of Christ, wherefore he said, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Now, uh I I'm not sure we'll get into those gifts. We may at some point during this time. uh it would kind of make sense maybe if we did. But uh if you go over in Corinthians, you'll find out with the gifts it talks about the speaking in tongues and prophecy and helps and government and all the gifts of uh the spiritual gifts that's given unto the church. Well, he when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Amen. Gave gifts unto men. Now, if you notice, let's just read on, but I want you to notice something. Ninth and 10th vers. Now uh let me read the eighth again. Wherefore he says when he ascended up on high led captivity captive gave this unto men. Okay. Praise the Lord. Now now he that uh now that he ascended that is it but uh that is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things. But now notice those two verses are in parenthesis. Amen. So this is a if you will a statement that he's making that Paul's making to the Ephesian church. He's making this statement. Wherefore he send it up on high led captivity captive gist of men. He's making a statement and he offshoots that statement. Now you could you could bracket it off with quotations. You could bracket it off with with parentheses. You could bracket it off with commas, whatever way. Amen. This in my Bible, it's bracketed off with parentheses. &gt;&gt; So, he's making a statement and he goes and he adds some validity to that statement by saying, "He that ascended uh was was the same one that descended to the lower parts of the earth asking a question." And he ascended up far above all all heavens that he might fill all things. So he's adding an explanation or an addition to what his statement is that he uh was ascended up on high and led captiv captivity captive dead gives unto men. Amen. So his next two verses are an offshoot or a a explanation of what he's talking about. Amen. And questioning. So maybe uh we don't know. There could be people there that uh didn't quite understand what he was talking about or maybe disbelieved what he was talking about. So, as the spirit leads, Amen. probably how many times I do that. I I try to listen to the Lord uh when I'm up here and whatever the Lord gives me. You'd be surprised at how many messages I have here and I have all kinds of notes that I don't one note, one scripture out of the entire page &gt;&gt; because everything is what the Lord gave me. &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised how many I mean I could tell you but it's a lot. Amen. But but in in in the spirit in Paul in the spirit leading Paul there must have been a spirit there. You notice brother Brandham sometimes would preach or he would be in discernment or something and he would catch somebody's thought and he would stop and he would go to that thought or he would go to that person or or whatever that spirit led him to. Amen. And I can imagine that maybe when Paul was doing this as a as a a a prophet of God, apostle as he was reading, as he was giving this statement, uh he ascended up on high, left captivity captive, gave gifts to men. Maybe there was a question, maybe there was something there, maybe there was doubt. So what does he do? He goes on, he says, "Now he that ascended up, what is it? But he that descended first in the lower parts of the earth." See, that's a question. She's questioning to say if those of you are doubting this is the explanation. Praise the Lord about him uh ascended up on high and live captive cathic gave gifts to men. Now he's given explanation first is to a question. A lot of times when you're in reasoning with people or debating with people or trying to talk to reason with somebody, uh you you will do that. You'll you'll come off with a question. Well, what is it that now he ascended up uh what that but he descended first into the lower parts of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he explains that he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all that is is just an explanation if you will of what he's talking about. But now in the uh uh 11th verse he continues his thought. His thought continues from the eighth verse. So what I'm going to do, please forgive me if this offends anybody. I'm going to omit verses 8 and N. And let's read it again. Wherefore he said when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. He gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. Now, how does that sound? Sounds like a continuation of a thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without eight and nine, without the explanation of the ascending and descending, without that explanation, this the his this paragraph, this uh uh speech is this teaching he's giving flows a lot better really if you take those two verses out. Amen. Uh led cap captivity captive, gave gifts unto men. He gave some apostles. So see these are gifts of God. These are the gifts of God that God gives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know that the that the main gift that we've got, the gift of the Holy Ghost is that that God comes in us is the greatest gift we have. But upon that in in in the bringing of that spirit comes the gifts that God distributed unto men. Now remember these gifts are without callings are without repentance. These gifts and callings are without repentance. Right. Amen. So, a person can have that gift or have even that calling and still not believe it, still not uh uh accept it or use it maybe in uh a a way that's not godly, if you will, or use it in a way that doesn't edify God. That happens also. Amen. That's I I hear probably a lot of you probably like I do when you hear psychic, uh your eyes roll. Uh mine probably rolls so loud you can hear it at your house from mine. Sister when my eyes roll or brother Dennis how far you are away from us you could probably hear my eyes roll you say well and you heard the word psychic again &gt;&gt; cuz but but uh because if if not all of it at least 99% of it is fake and put on and people trying to make money but I don't deny the fact that there are people that may have a gift &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and they're using it for the devil are using it not to edify Christ, but they may have a gift. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they may have a gift to uh to be able to do the what they call psychic things uh that that are there that reading minds or whatever. A lot of people call brother a mind reader. A lot of people call brother Brandham a fortune teller or something like that. you know, bad names, devilish names, terms, um, that that would that would try to lessen the gift of God in his life. And of course, that was the devil. But I I don't deny that there's people out there that had that. But see, God, when go when he talks about when Paul's talking about this give giving gifts of men, this is a very specific reason he's talking about. He goes to the Corinthian church about all the gifts of tongues and prophecy and all those. But what he's talking about here now is a specific uh uh area of a five-fold ministry as we've come to affectionately known as brother Brandham called a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Five-fold prophet, teacher, evangelist, missionary, prophet. So this now he says when he led captivity captive, he gave gifts unto men. So these gifts are God-given. Amen. It's God gives these gifts. He gives the gift of uh he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers. &gt;&gt; So each one has that that gift. Those that are called has that gift. Amen. Uh you you know me and you know the way I feel and I I I don't believe that God made it. Not that a person can't preach or be edifying or helpful to people, but I believe that if you're called to be a pastor, that's what you do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't go out doing missionary work and evangelistic work. And &gt;&gt; if you're called to be a pastor, you're a pastor. That's what you do. &gt;&gt; A pastor's main function is to guard the sheep and protect the sheep and to feed the sheep. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's their job. That's pretty hard to do when you're 5,000 miles away for months at a time. When you're 10, 12,000 miles away in some other country on some other continent, it's kind of hard to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there's associate pastors and such like that and I would agree with that. Amen. But I'm a little more liberal with them than I am the pastor. The pastor's the pastor and then associate pastor, they should be in line together as much as possible. But the associate pastor gets a call to go out. the pastor's there. Amen. The pastor gets a call to go out, the associate pastor be there. But for to go to go six months out of the year, I don't agree with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh when I wasn't feeling well, uh you all know I got I wasn't feeling well a few weeks ago and had to cancel church here. Well, that Thursday night, that Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Brother Roger had some special meetings with a brother from back east and he called me and asked me if I would minister on Thursday. and I was planning on doing it. Uh but then I got to where I wasn't feeling well. So I I didn't I had to text him and tell him I wasn't going to be able to do it. Uh but he called and I said, "I would have no problem with that. &gt;&gt; I'd have had no problem going over and ministering him on a Thursday night. It didn't affect our service. &gt;&gt; And uh if there's something that God put on his heart, maybe I could help those people. But it's not like I'm going over for months at a time or something. That's a totally different thing. &gt;&gt; It's not like I you all know this. I don't actively call other pastors to come minister for us. I just I just don't do that. Now, obviously, if we did it now, only having a Sunday morning, they would have to leave their Sunday morning service to come here to do it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I I just I I and honestly, that's that's actually one thing I disagree with brother Roger about. uh truthfully he thinks they're kind of more interchangeable and a person can do this for a while and do this for a while and that's possibly so but not effective not as effective a pastor is effective as a pastor. &gt;&gt; He might can help somebody or he might can do some good as an evangelist but that's not his call. That's not where he's supposed to be. That's not what his ministry and his nature is geared toward. He's geared toward being a pastor. an evangelist geared toward being a pastor. I mean, not an evangelist. An evangelist shouldn't be a pastor, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I I've seen them and and an evangelist comes and he rips a place apart and he hits the street. Amen. That's what he does. He comes and tears a hide off of people and he's gone. And he goes and he goes and does this wherever he goes. That's what he does. the pastor comes along with the sav and he nurses things back to uh the way they should be. And I mean, brother Brandham kind of did all that whole thing in one meeting. You know, brother Brown rip the hot off of you one second and he's got the sav out the next. But that's what an evangelist does. &gt;&gt; And if an evangelist stays in front of a group of people as a pastor for a long period of time, people are just going to leap. Usually, people are just going to leap. They're not going to sit there every service and just get ripped apart every single service, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They need a little kindness. They need a little nurturing. They need a little taking care of. Amen. Which is what a pastor supposed to do because that's his job, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And you got teachers and uh missionaries who should be burning up the fields. Now, I know the missionary fields aren't what they used to be, but that doesn't mean God doesn't have missionaries or &gt;&gt; uh u uh or or teachers. Um we we still there's still a need for that. Amen. There's always in fact, Brother Brandham said, we'll have this need in this ministry, this five-fold ministry until the Lord comes. &gt;&gt; Right? So, uh, if if people try to, uh, denigrate that, uh, again, and I've made this statement before, I'll make it again. It baffles me how tape only people can be tape only people, right? &gt;&gt; If you're a tape only person and you're only listening to the tape, I'm sorry for the word salad, but I'm getting to a point. And you're you're only you're a tape only person and you're only listening to tapes. How are you not listening on those tapes when that tape is telling you to go to church and have a pastor? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And have live ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And have the five-fold ministry is supposed to be in effect until the Lord comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How are they missing that? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I really don't. Or they're not listening. &gt;&gt; Or or they don't play the tape that Lord that brother Brown talks about that. I don't know. I I'm not sure how that can be. But that's that what I get from it is he is that's exactly what brother Brandham's saying. In fact, let me read you this since I'm to it and again just like last week I'm moving in a different way. So whatever the Lord wants a question went came to brother Brandham on the questions and answers of the seals. The question was, would the bride of Christ uh have a ministry before the rapture? Now, the bride of Christ, it doesn't say brother Brandham. It doesn't say him. It says the bride of Christ. Now, if you think now, if a person thinks that brother Brandham was the only member of that bride, then okay, you're you're fine there. Amen. But I want you to know that if you believe, and I'm using this hypothetically, but if you believe that brother Brandham was the only bride member, that puts you out, &gt;&gt; right? That does it not? Cuz that makes Brother Brandham the only bride member. You're not bride because he's the only one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That puts you out by believing that, &gt;&gt; right? Again, stuff that seems sometimes like common sense just baffles me. &gt;&gt; It It really does. &gt;&gt; But now his point is, does the bride of Christ have a ministry after the uh uh would the bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture? Before the rapture. So, this is 1963 to 2025. Now, we're standing here in September. What does brother Random say? Brother Ram says, "Sure, that's what's going on right now." See, the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour. See the bride of Christ. Sure, she is she is consisting of apostles, prophets. She is not him. She is consisting of apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's a bride's ministry in the last day before the rapture. It wasn't all in brother Brandham. In fact, brother Brandham is saying here is for all of these to have in the bride of Christ with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He says that's the bride of Christ. Sure. She's got a ministry, great ministry, the ministry of the hour. And it will be so humble. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What's going on now? It's still going on. &gt;&gt; And it will go on until we all go home until the rapture. God, his bride will have a five-fold ministry. God will have a voice to his bride. Amen. Nothing wrong with listening to tapes. Obviously not. In fact, we all should uh listen to tape. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feed on that word. Get into that storehouse of that stored up food and and enjoy and eat. Amen. But then we come to church and let the Lord speak to us even fresh. A lot of times uh the fresh will just reiterate what God has already spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. which Peter said that in two or three places over in his gospels that he said we we come just to stir up your mind. We come just to bring back to you to bring back to your remembrance the things that we know to be the truth. We know we did not uh we we have not followed cunningly devised fables. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We followed a gospel, a truth, a word ministered and brought by God Almighty to a bride. &gt;&gt; And this bride in this last days has a ministry. What's her ministry? She g He gave some apostles. He gave some prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Amen. Now, let's look at this real quick. We'll go on. We'll probably come back to these because we'll probably eventually individualize these, but let's continue on for right now. Because there's three purposes. The Bible lists three purposes for this five-fold ministry. The 12th verse enumerates them. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of Christ. That is the three-fold purpose that God gave to this five-fold ministry. That is that is it is to accomplish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfecting of the saints, working in the ministry, and edifying of the body of Christ. Praise the Lord. Now, look, we can break these down a little bit. For the perfecting of the saints. Now, so many people get in their minds that that perfecting is to make a bride sinless. The blood of Jesus Christ makes the bride sinless. Amen. The blood has washed her clean. It's the blood that makes the bride sinless. &gt;&gt; He took our place so we could take his place. He shed his blood so we don't have to. He became me that I might become him. &gt;&gt; That I could take his place. That I could put on his robe of righteousness which is without a bl a spot, blink, blemish, or wrinkle. Amen. It's his that we put on. It's by his blood. Amen. That we put that on that be that we become sinless. Now, not in our humanity, not in our flesh, not in our carality, not in our bodies, not in our spirits, but in God's eyes through that blood, he sees a sinless, perfect bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sinless and perfect without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. That's the bride. Now, he is a human. Oh my my my I would hate to try to enumerate all of my faults. This wall's not big enough. These walls aren't large enough. There's not enough ink on the world to try to write down all of mine. But it doesn't matter &gt;&gt; because the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, it's not a sinless perfection that we we're we are in God's eyes at, but in our humanity, we're not sinless. In our carnality, we're not sinless. Here is humans. We're not sinless. No. Amen. It's not a perfecting of the saints in the sense that we become sinless. Amen. as humans because we're always always false sin come short of the glory of God always repenting asking God's forgiveness always needing his grace always needing his mercy always leaning on the blood always believing and expecting that that blood to still be on that mercy seat today making intercession on my behalf &gt;&gt; on our behalf it's still there perfecting of the saints simply means strengthening or edifying that's all it means means perfecting, dispering, uh is an edification. It's a strengthening. The the uh the work of the five-fold ministry is to bring strength to the bride. How does she get strength? From the word. &gt;&gt; From the spirit of God and from the word. The word revealing itself to you. The Holy Spirit revealing that word to you. We become edified. &gt;&gt; We become strengthened. Amen. Because of that word. That word brings life. That word brings strength &gt;&gt; and that's what the bride is to do. Now, it is the calling that God gives us in whatever position it's in. Like I said, an evangelist can help maybe if he's pastoring. What he says may be good and he may be a God- called minister. But look, if a person is not a God-led minister, God has no obligation. Listen to this real close now. If God if they are not a God called minister, God is absolutely not responsible for holding that person true to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if you're God called, if God is I if if God has called you, placed you, this is your calling, this is where God has you, God is obligated to take care of you. And that goes with any calling. That goes with any position. You're in your position. God has called you to this position. God's placed you there. God is obligated to take care of you. What's the saying that we've heard for so many times, for so many years? God's will can't lead you or his grace can't keep you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're in God's will, being led by his spirit in your place, in your position, God is obligated to take care of you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Scripturally obligated. But if you're out of that &gt;&gt; and say a man gets behind a pull pit to take a position he's not called to, God's not obligated to take care of that man. God is not obligated to keep that man right on the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if that man is not right on the word, then anything can happen really. &gt;&gt; I mean, I was going to be a little more polite, but the truth is anything can happen to that person &gt;&gt; and they can start preaching anything. They can start believing anything. Forgive me, saints, but it's just come to me. That could be the very reason a lot of these people are leaving the message, leaving the truth. Why? They weren't called to it to begin with. So, God wasn't obligated to hold them there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And that's a hard thought to think because I got some precious friends that I know personally that I love dearly that have left and went off away from this this truth, this message. And that hurts me deeply, but it carried very well. And and and people I thought were stout believers were were gallant ministers, were preachers of the truth, the gospel, and go away. Some pastors, Amen. I know in my mind right now, two pastors, three pastors, Amen. that have denounced this truth. &gt;&gt; Maybe. I don't know. I believe in my heart of hearts they're going to be saved. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. I really do. I I I absolutely refuse to believe anything different. &gt;&gt; But that could be the reason. I I don't know. It just came to me. But God is not obligated to keep a man if he's not in his God called position. God's not obligated to keep him straight on the word if he's not in his God called position. Perfecting now edifying, strengthening, strengthening of the saints by the word. The word brings strength. The word brings healing. The word brings blessing. The word brings comfort. The word what does the word not bring? &gt;&gt; Amen. all the goodness and things that the Lord gives us the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry to be working in the ministry to be a work of the ministry to be someone who works in it. So when someone something is needed, it's probably a little simpler with our small group, but nevertheless, you can understand nobody but my wife probably maybe Mike, I'm not sure because he was with us when he was in our home of how it affects a minister, how it affects a pastor, how that the weight of that is on that man 24/7. &gt;&gt; Yeah. of your well-being, your spiritual well-being, your position in Christ, your your wellness physically, everything about it. It it continuously weighs on a person all the time. Even if it's not on your lips or in the forefront of your mind, it's in your spirit and you know it when it comes up that it's there and you feel it. You say, "It's not grieving." It's not grieving. It's just something that pulls from you. &gt;&gt; It's something that pulls off of you. And and that pull is something that It it takes something out of a person. Uh takes something out of a man for in that position, but it's a work of the ministry. It comes with the territory. It's part of it. Again, you can ask my wife. She's lived in it, lived through it. She understands. She knows because she's seen it. Front row seat &gt;&gt; and then some. But it's a work of the ministry. It's a work. Ministry is a work. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of times, unfortunately, in the dynamic that we live in and and the world's economy and the way things go, you got most smaller churches, in fact, I don't know of any smaller churches like ours where the pastor doesn't work to make money, has to make a living. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, most do. You got a handful of them out there that are larger churches that are able to take care of a pastor. a pastor to just spend that time straight in that work of that ministry, straight in that 24/7 or all the time is studying or whatever praying. Amen. It doesn't always fall on all all of us that way, but still we do what we need to do. &gt;&gt; And God gives grace and I'm thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God gives grace just like the job I have now. Thank God God gave me that job and I'm thankful for it. And I know and believe that if it comes a time that the Lord says, uh, okay, the period for you to be there is over, he'll show me and and it'll be over. Maybe when I die, I don't know. But there is a work of the ministry that is a fulfillment of that five-fold ministry to work in that ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ. See, because the work of the ministry, the work of the ministry is to edify people. Not just themselves or not just therefore no more, but it's to edify the entire body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The entire body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Edify is to build up. In fact, I think I I printed it here. Edifying. To build up to to build a building is what he's talking about. To build a building. To edify. to build up to strengthen uh just as we talked about even with the uh perfecting of the saints edifying a building up building of a building brother talked about you know almost anybody could masonry a straight wall but it takes a true mason to turn the corner &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; he said why because we're not building a wall we're building a building amenifying to build up to to build up to edify the act The act of one who promotes another's growth in spiritual wisdom. &gt;&gt; The act of one who promotes another's growth in spiritual wisdom. Edifying to edify to bring edification. Now, when it says to edify of the body of Christ, that helps us all understand that when I'll just say me just for just not to use anybody out there. If if I get edified, it's a blessing to the whole body. &gt;&gt; If a brother over in Marishia gets edified, it helps us. If a bo if a if a brother in China gets built up and edified, it helps us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It helps the one over in Australia. It helps the one uh in in Russia because it's all an edification because remember what we just read. There is one body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One body. We're all part of that same mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. and in this one body we're all a part of needs the building up of that body into the edification of the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's who she is. Amen. That ministry that five-fold ministries to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray Lord bless that fivefold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's be in the call we're to be in. Be where God's called us. Be in that place where God's placed us. And let that edification come. Let that rapturing faith come. Let that build in this bride to the place that we that the the dead in Christ rise and we see our loved ones in here before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here or home or wherever. Amen. I don't believe it's long either. Amen. I sat in here the other day studying and reading and just something overcome me. I just I just sat there and looked ahead for just five minutes or more just waiting. Honestly, it just overcome me to a place I was expecting to see my son, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; My dad, my mom. I was expecting that. &gt;&gt; I was I had that kind of an expectation as I sat there. I don't know. Somebody thought I was in a trance. I I'm really not sure what happened around me, but it just came over me in that way. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's going to be just like that. &gt;&gt; Wherever we are, whatever time, it's going to be just like that. And they're going to be starting a period before us any moment, anytime. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every bit of this brings that edifying is is a part of that. It it it brings that along and helps that come forward and and and bring forward in in that body of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times I'm going to close here in just a minute, but a lot of times you don't see very many people or I haven't anyway seen too much teaching on the five-fold ministry. I I don't know why. In fact, I don't know that I've ever heard anybody except maybe brother Brandham preach on the five-fold ministry. Maybe you have. That's okay. Maybe you've heard me touch on it before. That's okay, too. Amen. But I haven't. I've heard they don't that people don't talk about so many times you unfortunately I'm afraid there's so many guilty of it that they don't want to talk about. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God makes special provisions and things along the way, but you know, u the reason a lot of times that things get scrupled up is is out of ignorance. &gt;&gt; Look and say, well, you know, how horrible things are and how horrible way people act and how horrible the mind. There are people that just because the Bible talks that people that receive the truth and reject it. Don't have anything to do with it. There there's people that they know and they don't care. But I just can't help but believe the majority of people are just ignorant. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And ignorance people, it's ignorance has become such a bad word. But ignorance isn't a bad word. Ignorance isn't isn't a harmful word. Ignorance just means you just don't know. How can you react on something that you don't know? If you don't know it, how can you, pardon me, know it? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If you don't know, you don't know. And a lot of people just don't know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Look what Brother Brandham said here. Adoption number two. What is the body of Christ? Some are apostles, some are prophets, some are teachers, some are evangelists, some are pastors. Is that right? He said we're called to. But others has gift of tongues, interpretation, tongues, wisdom, knowledge, miracles, working of miracles, all these great gift, different gifts. And what did they do? They practiced that a little bit. What? And let it run loose just like I don't know what one raise up and speak in tongues. The other one go back and talk blur blur blur blur blur. He said, "Uh-huh. Pastor a preacher preacher will be preaching making an altar call and somebody will raise up speak in tongues. Hallelujah. Praise God. And if the preacher happens to go on with his message as he has had the authority to do because if the minister's ministering and has the word and is bringing forth the word, he is the one of authority. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. No other no other gifted to rise up above that gift or to take over or interrupt that gift. Amen. Because that the word is the most is the most important part. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is more important than the tongues or the prophecy or the all that may be perfectly right and genuine, but if it interrupts what God is what God is doing and in the flow of the spirit and bringing the word, it's out of order. &gt;&gt; Brother said, if the preacher happens to go on with a message like that, being anointed, then the people say, "Oh, he's just an old backslider." He said, "See, but it's because they're not taught." because they're not taught. What does that mean? That means they're doing it ignorantly. Brings it to light in that in in that way. It makes me feel like, well, Lord, help me to make sure that what I do and the calling you've given me that they know and that they're taught &gt;&gt; and that they understand and can see scripturally the truth of it. No, not ignorance, but truth, reality. Amen. So, what does that do? That puts pressure to me. puts pressure on me to make sure that those that God's put in my spiritual care know and are taught and forgive me if I repeat myself. Forgive me if if if I'm redundant sometimes. Uh but I I I try my best to bring it the way God gives it and uh what he does with us from there. But I probably do sometimes maybe uh say something more than once or redundant about it. Uh truth is there's not not here. We have such a small group now. But there's times that you know that there's people that didn't get it &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You know that there's people that got interrupted. You know there was people that just weren't listening. &gt;&gt; You know there was people that forgive me but probably fell asleep maybe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That didn't get it. So maybe the Lord brings it back again. It becomes repetitive. And for those who are attentive and listen, it may sound repetitive, but uh it's the Lord's it's the Lord's word nevertheless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it brings it to us to edifying. Now, let me finish reading this and I'm going to close. Till we all we're at the 13th verse now. till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of his of the fullness of Christ. And Lord willing, next week we'll probably go over to second Peter and pick up that stature of a perfect man again a little bit, not teach on it, but just to recognize that the ministry, the five-fold ministry is to help bring it to that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. to the to the uh stature of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of man and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie and wait to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint joint supply. That's all of us. According to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying itself, the edifying of itself in love. Amen. the bringing of this body together in an edification of the pure word, the poor, the pure true unadulterated word of God, message of the hour, truth that God reveals and brings to us and things that God may even through the message bring the bride to a a different place than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the message that that was brought to us is one thing. Amen. There's a lot of things brother Brandon didn't talk about. He just like we said Paul, there's there's things in the scripture brother Brandon didn't talk about. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He may not have hit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of those things may be very good scriptural lessons that somebody through God's operating, God brings it, shows it to us, and it edifies, blesses us. Amen. brings strength to us, gives us strength for this journey because friend, we need more strength now in this journey than we've ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're living at the end time and now is the time to be fortified and strengthened more than ever. Amen. Let's stand if we could. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. By his grace, &gt;&gt; he brings by his grace he shows us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's by his grace that we can even stand today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus.

Praise the Lord Jesus. So glad there was something to cover &gt;&gt; and not just cover but annihilate every sin that could ever be held by charge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The grace of God &gt;&gt; through his blood give us something to sustain us and to take us beyond Amen. This human realm, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; this human flesh by God's grace.
