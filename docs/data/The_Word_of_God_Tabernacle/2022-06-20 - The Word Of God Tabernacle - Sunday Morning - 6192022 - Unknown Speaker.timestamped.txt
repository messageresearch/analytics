[18:35] remember one time one of the
[18:37] apostles might have been paul he says
[18:40] certain ones the preaching of the gospel
[18:44] did not profit them anything because it
[18:47] wasn't mixed with faith oh god help us
[18:50] lord to recognize the day and the hour
[18:53] that we're living in yes lord i can't
[18:56] remember your prophet said that it's not
[18:59] the big things we do for god it's the
[19:01] little things we leave undone
[19:04] and help us lord in our walk with you i
[19:07] believe that's very important yeah

[19:21] us have a prayer life that is worthy of
[19:24] the gospel let us be loving and kind one
[19:28] to another yes let your word become life
[19:31] in us father because lord there are
[19:35] needs of your people this morning
[19:38] and lord i also remember as i heard your
[19:42] prophets say that we know god cannot lie
[19:46] yes amen we come before you
[19:50] and and taking you at your word whatever
[19:53] we should ask believing we shall receive
[19:57] and brother brown said take god his word

[20:20] strengthens me and are there some that
[20:23] need a touch a healing touch from you

[20:30] high priest that can be touched by the
[20:33] feelings of our infirmities and with

[41:33] now may it all be pleasing to you in the
[41:35] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[41:38] amen amen
[41:40] amen romans chapter 1 3 verses 16 and 17
[41:46] amen paul says here now for i am not
[41:48] ashamed of the gospel of christ
[41:51] for it is the power of god unto
[41:53] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[41:56] the jew first and also to the greek
[41:58] for therein is the righteousness of god
[42:01] revealed
[42:02] from faith to faith as it is written to
[42:05] just shall live by faith
[42:07] you can be seated if you like
[42:13] i'd like to take my text from the 17th
[42:15] verse here today
[42:17] that last part of the 17th verse for the
[42:19] just shall live by faith i know it's
[42:22] something that
[42:24] that was
[42:25] martin luther's message but you know i
[42:27] think a lot of times some of the worst
[42:29] mistakes that we make especially in this
[42:31] message is that we say we're beyond so
[42:34] and so we're beyond luther we're beyond
[42:36] wesley and i understand that there's a
[42:38] word that god has brought to us in this
[42:40] last day through a message i understand
[42:42] that but it's like um
[42:45] uh
[42:46] when when you grow up and get older you
[42:48] become more responsible you become
[42:51] stronger you become smarter you become a
[42:54] more viable to do things in the world
[42:57] well when you do that you don't forget
[42:59] the things that you learned as a child
[43:01] you don't let go of those things and
[43:03] forget those things
[43:05] you just bring those things with you
[43:07] because those things are the things that
[43:08] makes you stronger when you get older
[43:11] and a lot of times i think we have the
[43:13] mistaken
[43:14] uh uh that we do when we when we kind of
[43:18] think well we've gotten past that yes
[43:20] but you can't forget about that amen you
[43:23] can't let that go because that is as
[43:25] important a part of our lives as a
[43:27] christian today as what we know now
[43:30] amen without justification where would
[43:33] we be today but my point today i really
[43:36] want to speak on a major on faith
[43:39] faith had become the thing that was a
[43:41] theme of my heart that i wanted to speak
[43:43] on today and yesterday the lord gave me
[43:45] the scripture of the just shall live by
[43:48] faith because when you take that into an
[43:51] overall
[43:52] understanding of our christian walk and
[43:54] our christian life it becomes paramount
[43:57] to us to recognize
[43:59] faith isn't it is not just an event of
[44:02] life faith is a life lived
[44:05] amen uh this that we live this this just
[44:09] shall live by faith it's a life that we
[44:11] live it's a livelihood it's a way of
[44:15] life it's not just an event it's just
[44:18] not something that we expect to implore
[44:20] on when somebody's sick or needy we
[44:23] don't just try to grab faith when it's
[44:25] convenient for us our life should be
[44:27] lived in faith
[44:29] everything about our lives is faith the
[44:32] fact that we take our next breath is
[44:34] faith the next time our heartbeat is
[44:36] faith the
[44:37] everything that we do in life we we do
[44:39] it by faith amen it's all in faith it's
[44:42] a life of faith but now the just are the
[44:46] ones who live by faith amen the just the
[44:49] just are the ones that are justified
[44:53] have been justified by the blood of
[44:55] jesus christ what is justified means
[44:57] well brother random put in very simple
[44:59] terms when he basically said that being
[45:01] justified means you never did it in the
[45:04] first place
[45:05] not that you were forgiven but that you
[45:08] did not do it
[45:09] it's like when we talked about last week
[45:11] back from deuteronomy
[45:13] when he said when god told moses there
[45:15] was to be no leaven for seven days in
[45:17] the household amen no eleven seven days
[45:20] in the household that meant no eleven
[45:22] not that you were forgiven of the leaven
[45:25] that came in no not the forgiveness but
[45:28] that there was no leaven
[45:31] you understand justified means it never
[45:34] happened you never did it
[45:36] amen now there there comes
[45:39] a caveat to that because we understand
[45:42] that the physical aspects of what we've
[45:44] done in life still remain amen i've told
[45:47] this story before that uh this analogy
[45:52] that a a person would try to
[45:54] uh go to
[45:56] a woman's house with just say a woman's
[45:58] house whose
[46:00] man's whose husband's life was destroyed
[46:03] because this man was a drug dealer
[46:05] and this man came to a sense and he was
[46:07] no longer a drug dealer so he comes to
[46:09] this woman's house and knocks on the
[46:11] door and says uh mama uh i i just want
[46:15] you to know uh your your husband's wife
[46:17] your husband's life's destroyed he's
[46:19] dead you killed her your children your
[46:20] home was all destroyed because i dealt
[46:22] your husband drugs but i never did it
[46:26] i just want you to know i never dealt
[46:27] your husband drugs you know what you're
[46:29] going to walk away with a bloody nose
[46:31] black eye or maybe worse
[46:34] because you did do it
[46:36] amen
[46:37] in this world in this life
[46:40] physically i've known people to go
[46:42] before judges that would say but you
[46:44] know judge my plea is that i never did
[46:46] it well i've got six witnesses over here
[46:49] that watched you do it
[46:51] i but i didn't do it yes you did do it
[46:54] but see the point of it is in the
[46:56] spiritual aspect in god's eyes you never
[46:59] did it so we can't go to seed with that
[47:02] and then and say well i never did do
[47:04] that well then you actually did do it
[47:06] but in god's eyes you never did it so
[47:09] the point of this being is that you're
[47:11] justified because god does not hold that
[47:15] to your account
[47:16] god doesn't hold it against you because
[47:19] in his eyes when he's been justified and
[47:22] annihilated by the blood of christ
[47:24] it never happened
[47:26] no leaven
[47:27] praise the lord didn't happen
[47:29] so in god's eyes it never happened so
[47:31] now
[47:32] although we may have done these things
[47:34] and we may have made these mistakes in
[47:37] god's eyes it never happened and i'd
[47:38] rather it have never happened in his
[47:40] eyes than in the world anyway
[47:43] amen
[47:44] i mean there's a lot of things i've done
[47:45] in life that i wish back and could wish
[47:47] i could go back and undo
[47:49] and change and wish i had not done that
[47:52] or said that or whatever but once it's
[47:55] done it's done
[47:57] it it's like i uh it's like you talk
[48:00] about when when you're verbalizing
[48:03] things and when you're saying words
[48:04] people aren't guarded with their words
[48:06] so much anymore but people try to take
[48:08] their words back the best you can do by
[48:10] taking your words back is apologize
[48:13] amen
[48:14] i go to somebody who i made
[48:16] said something i shouldn't have said and
[48:18] said well i never said that yes you did
[48:22] amen it's like the it's like the man
[48:24] trying to went to the priest and said
[48:26] how can i make all these things that i
[48:28] did wrong right
[48:29] how can i fix all these things that i
[48:31] said how can i take back all those
[48:33] things
[48:34] he said well i'll tell you he said take
[48:36] a uh take a basket of feathers and lay a
[48:38] feather on every door of the person that
[48:40] you think that you said wrong or did
[48:41] wrong
[48:42] go take the basket of feathers and lay a
[48:44] feather on every door amen
[48:47] monsoon season so
[48:49] now he came back to the priest and he
[48:50] said now i want you to go back and
[48:52] collect every one of those feathers from
[48:53] all those doors he said those pheasants
[48:55] feathers are gone by now
[48:57] they're blown away they're gone away
[48:59] people's picked them up
[49:00] they're not going to be there anymore he
[49:02] said neither can you take back those
[49:03] things that you said
[49:05] amen it's easier to go collect those
[49:07] feathers back than it is to put those
[49:08] words back in your mouth once they're
[49:10] out they're out
[49:12] once they're out you've said it it has
[49:14] its effect but in god's eyes and that's
[49:17] the most important place now in god's
[49:19] eyes you never did it in the first place
[49:22] being justified justified means you're
[49:25] guiltless
[49:27] guiltless praise the lord you can be
[49:29] brought before a tribunal of satan and
[49:32] all of his minions and you will be found
[49:35] guiltless because in god's eyes she
[49:37] never did it amen he's the supreme judge
[49:39] anyway
[49:41] in god's eyes she never did it you're
[49:42] guiltless amen so the just so now those
[49:46] that are guiltless those that have been
[49:47] justified those who live in a perpetual
[49:50] state of justification
[49:52] never did to begin with no leaven
[49:56] there's no leaven
[49:57] that sin
[49:59] leaves goes
[50:00] is annihilated by the blood of christ
[50:02] goes back on the head of satan and that
[50:05] mistake will lay on his head till the
[50:07] day of judgment so satan on the damn
[50:10] judgment will have to give an account
[50:12] for the things that happened in your
[50:14] life amen that he tricked you into doing
[50:16] this amen thou be accounted to him not
[50:20] you you never did it
[50:22] justified
[50:24] guiltless
[50:25] virtuous that's another one
[50:28] virtuous
[50:30] justified means to be virtuous undefiled
[50:33] even undefiled by sin undefiled by 11
[50:36] justified
[50:38] virtuous
[50:40] living
[50:41] the just now those are the people who
[50:43] live by faith so we understand not
[50:46] everybody lives by faith
[50:48] only the just live by faith only those
[50:51] that have been justified by the blood of
[50:53] christ
[50:54] to the annihilation of sin only those
[50:57] are the ones who live
[50:58] by faith in a perpetual existence of
[51:01] faith my whole life is about faith i
[51:04] believe that faith and i stand upon that
[51:06] faith and that faith operates in my life
[51:09] every single moment of my life
[51:12] now there's the faith of the scene and
[51:14] there's a faith of the unseen a lot of
[51:16] people everybody has faith we know that
[51:18] the bible says each man is dealt be
[51:20] measure of faith we know everybody's got
[51:22] faith even atheists can get healed from
[51:24] colds
[51:26] if
[51:26] an atheist get healed from a cold how
[51:28] did he get healed well he didn't get
[51:30] healed from the devil
[51:31] he got healed by god well what healed
[51:33] him he didn't pray to god and ask for
[51:35] healing so how did he get healed he had
[51:38] faith to believe yes not believing god
[51:40] he may have believed in his doctrine he
[51:41] may have faith in his medicine whatever
[51:43] that whatever it took to bring that man
[51:46] or that person's faith up to a level of
[51:48] receiving healing
[51:50] and that healing then comes because of
[51:52] that faith
[51:53] god has no respect for a person friend
[51:55] and we sometimes forget that but god has
[51:58] no respect for a person regardless of
[52:00] whether that person is justified a child
[52:02] of god or not
[52:04] god is no respecter person and that
[52:06] faith stands
[52:09] just like it does with anybody else but
[52:11] now the just
[52:13] live by faith
[52:15] their life is an example of the
[52:18] of the faith in jesus christ our lord
[52:21] amen amen that faith is that conviction
[52:25] that we have
[52:26] it's a conviction of course
[52:30] hebrews 11 explains all about that faith
[52:32] the things that are unseen
[52:34] the things that we
[52:36] can't see but yet we believe it
[52:38] we have faith in it faith seems to be
[52:40] one of those things that that
[52:43] is far-reaching for some people it seems
[52:45] to be something that people
[52:48] sometimes just can't get a grasp on
[52:51] can't understand
[52:53] but you know it's
[52:55] it's easier
[52:57] uh let me try to put it this way
[52:59] it is easier to have faith
[53:02] in the things that are unseen
[53:05] than it is to have faith in things that
[53:07] you can see
[53:09] but are contrary to your faith
[53:13] you understand
[53:14] it's easier to have faith in things that
[53:17] you cannot see or touch or hear or feel
[53:20] it's easier to have faith in the unseen
[53:24] than it is to have faith in things that
[53:26] you can see tangible
[53:28] but that are contrary to your faith
[53:31] right you understand because
[53:34] many times we ask god for things
[53:36] let's just take a sickness for example
[53:39] you just have a simple sickness it's
[53:41] easier to believe for something that
[53:43] doesn't exist than to believe that
[53:45] you're well when you're standing there
[53:46] with the symptoms of a sickness
[53:49] it is
[53:50] it's easier to believe in something that
[53:52] you can't see it's it's a we have prayer
[53:55] all the time and believe
[53:56] for things that that we're just trusting
[53:59] the lord in
[54:00] but when it's you how many times have we
[54:03] said that when it's you
[54:05] and that sickness is in your life or
[54:07] that that situation is in your life to
[54:10] have the faith that's going to reverse
[54:13] what you can feel what you can hear what
[54:16] you can taste what you can see
[54:18] your faith is to reverse that that's
[54:21] even harder
[54:22] to take it uh and and and put it bring
[54:25] it in a different direction well that
[54:27] faith will do that the faith will change
[54:30] the circumstances faith will change
[54:33] whatever is happening to match what you
[54:35] believe what you ask god for what you
[54:38] spoke to be real
[54:40] what you have spoke to be real
[54:43] your faith will change that
[54:45] it'll reverse its course it'll take a
[54:47] sick person and make them well it'll
[54:49] take a person to eat up with cancer and
[54:51] have them with no cancer at all
[54:54] amen
[54:55] faith will do that
[54:57] but it takes that unwavering belief that
[55:00] the just live in
[55:02] now
[55:04] we do that understanding that we follow
[55:06] in what we believe to be the will of god
[55:08] for all of our lives sometimes things
[55:10] happen that might go against what our
[55:13] or what we believe in faith and some
[55:15] people come up and say well you just
[55:16] didn't have a faith enough
[55:18] but you know if i ask god for something
[55:21] and i believe it's his will to do
[55:23] something contrary to what my heart is i
[55:26] want to follow what he wants what god
[55:29] wants it may be contrary to what i want
[55:32] but it doesn't matter what i want it
[55:33] matters what he wants and what he wants
[55:36] becomes what i want
[55:38] regardless of if it's going to be good
[55:40] for me or whether i want it to happen or
[55:41] not
[55:42] it may be contrary but it's what god
[55:44] wants that's where our faith meets god
[55:49] our faith meets god because our will his
[55:52] will or our will has molded from his
[55:55] will because we do what he wants us to
[55:57] do
[55:58] that's where our faith comes and when
[55:59] you're standing in what you believe to
[56:01] be the perfect will of god of your life
[56:04] there is no greater place you can be to
[56:06] have faith
[56:07] than to know that you're standing in the
[56:09] center of god's perfect will
[56:12] when you know you're there you can have
[56:14] faith in what you pray and believe
[56:16] amen i've told you the story about my
[56:18] sister many times i prayed for my sister
[56:20] to be well over and over and over and
[56:23] over and over prayed for my sister to be
[56:25] well she had cancer
[56:27] and i prayed for her to be well she got
[56:28] sicker prayed for her to be well she got
[56:30] sick
[56:31] see it's harder to have faith to believe
[56:33] she's going to be well when i can look
[56:35] at her right and i can see how sick she
[56:37] is and how sicker she's getting yeah
[56:40] it's he's easier to have faith when i
[56:42] don't see her the unseen then when i'm
[56:45] looking at it and have faith and believe
[56:48] she's going to be wealth regardless of
[56:50] what the circumstances look like
[56:52] because our faith has to master
[56:54] circumstance you know brother random
[56:57] says perfect i used to had this printed
[56:59] he used to had on my desk at the school
[57:01] at tabernacle
[57:03] perfect faith masters every circumstance
[57:06] yes
[57:07] every circumstance
[57:10] and i was driving home one night you
[57:11] know
[57:12] i think i told you a story from
[57:13] flagstaff to show low i was on the
[57:16] interstate and it came on my heart and i
[57:18] prayed for my sister again and god
[57:20] stopped me and said don't pray for her
[57:21] anymore
[57:23] i said lord i want my sister to be well
[57:25] i don't want to lose my sister i don't
[57:26] want her to die from cancer lord i want
[57:28] my sister to be well i'm going to keep
[57:29] praying for her because i believe you're
[57:31] going to heal her god said don't pray
[57:33] for her anymore
[57:35] i said why not
[57:37] he said because it's time for me to take
[57:39] her home
[57:41] he said and your prayers are keeping me
[57:43] from doing that
[57:44] that's what he told me
[57:47] and i said okay well not my will but
[57:49] yours be done i didn't want to see my
[57:50] sister go
[57:52] i didn't want to lose she's only
[57:55] 48 i think when she passed away so young
[57:58] i didn't want to see her go
[58:00] but it
[58:01] but it was her time
[58:03] god told me it was her time and i said
[58:05] okay lord
[58:06] i said then i'll no longer and then once
[58:09] before i was praying in faith
[58:13] and i believed
[58:15] but after the but after i knew when god
[58:18] spoke to me there now he doesn't always
[58:19] make it that real that's that's a very
[58:22] exceptional circumstance at least for me
[58:25] anyway maybe he does you more but in my
[58:27] life it was a very exceptional
[58:29] circumstance
[58:30] that the lord would speak to me like
[58:32] that but
[58:33] usually i believe when i'm praying it i
[58:35] believe i'm not going to talk to the
[58:37] lord and waste his time
[58:39] amen
[58:40] that sounds crazy when he dwells in
[58:42] eternity but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
[58:44] waste my time his there's no point if i
[58:46] don't believe i'm not gonna pray it i'm
[58:49] not going to say it you know friends
[58:50] when you sit down at a meal if you don't
[58:52] believe what you're praying when you
[58:54] pray over that meal don't just don't
[58:55] even it's time to do it right
[58:58] what's the point and that sounds crude
[59:00] and blunt but it's true
[59:02] you must have faith
[59:04] when you pray that when you bow your
[59:07] head before god and you ask you
[59:10] a petition whatever it is believe
[59:13] no
[59:14] there's not a devil in hell that's going
[59:16] to stop it from happening right nothing
[59:19] but when god spoke to me
[59:21] and i knew at that moment what his
[59:24] perfect will was in that situation i had
[59:27] every faith in the world to believe what
[59:29] god was doing and what he was going to
[59:30] do
[59:31] a month later my my sister was gone
[59:34] the lord took her
[59:36] probably about a month i think this is
[59:38] november that was she passed in december
[59:40] a month later she was gone after that
[59:42] but when i knew my point of the story
[59:44] was then when i knew that that's what
[59:46] the lord of the perfect will of the lord
[59:48] i've had people come up in churches
[59:50] before never hear
[59:52] never hear so don't feel
[59:54] that but never hear him but i've had
[59:55] people come up before me in churches
[59:57] when i preached and want to get prayed
[59:59] for and i would go before that person of
[1:00:01] the lord and i feel something come on
[1:00:03] the lord said
[1:00:04] don't pray blessings on this person
[1:00:07] and that's hard
[1:00:10] because you know brother branham said if
[1:00:11] god if god is trying to teach somebody
[1:00:14] and god has got a sickness on that
[1:00:17] person or allowed a sickness or
[1:00:18] something on that person god's trying to
[1:00:21] teach that person something and i go up
[1:00:23] and i and i command that demon that god
[1:00:25] allowed to be on there off
[1:00:27] i'll be responsible for what happens in
[1:00:30] that person's life and i've gone and god
[1:00:32] said don't don't pray blessings on that
[1:00:34] person
[1:00:35] amen you can pray over them and god's
[1:00:38] will and
[1:00:39] and all but don't pray blessings in
[1:00:42] whatever the situation healing or
[1:00:44] whatever
[1:00:45] i've had god do that to me but it
[1:00:46] doesn't happen often but i've had it
[1:00:48] happen before not here again but i have
[1:00:50] had that happen before because when you
[1:00:53] know what the center of god's perfect
[1:00:55] will is every situation it's a life
[1:00:58] lived
[1:01:00] not just an incident
[1:01:02] it's not something you reach out and try
[1:01:04] to get when you need it
[1:01:06] when you're expecting god's blessing
[1:01:08] healing or something it's a life lived
[1:01:11] faith is a life lived to those that have
[1:01:13] been justified by the blood of christ
[1:01:15] amen it's a life yes it's in every pore
[1:01:19] of our being
[1:01:21] to live by faith
[1:01:23] faith is a conviction
[1:01:25] faith
[1:01:26] is a fidelity
[1:01:29] fidelity
[1:01:31] just like justified was virtuous
[1:01:33] fidelity means that you're virtuous
[1:01:36] pure undefiled
[1:01:38] fidelity means that you stay
[1:01:41] pure to that one
[1:01:44] thing whatever it is
[1:01:46] usually we talk about fidelity in this
[1:01:48] life like a husband and wife
[1:01:50] a a man that's true to his wife is is is
[1:01:54] a fidelity to that wife
[1:01:56] he there's no he forsaken every other
[1:01:58] woman on the planet he doesn't look at
[1:02:00] another woman he doesn't desire another
[1:02:02] woman he definitely doesn't touch
[1:02:04] another woman
[1:02:05] his fidelity is to that woman he stays
[1:02:08] true to her that's what faith is
[1:02:11] it's like jesus talked about when he
[1:02:13] told them when the disciples asked that
[1:02:16] lord increase our faith
[1:02:18] god goes on and starts telling different
[1:02:20] uh stories about if you had faith the
[1:02:22] great of a mustard seed you could tell
[1:02:24] that mountain you could tell that
[1:02:26] sycamore tree you can tell this to be
[1:02:28] cast in the sea or move from here to
[1:02:29] there you can tell it what to do and it
[1:02:31] will do it
[1:02:33] that's faith
[1:02:34] if you have faith to create a mustard
[1:02:36] seed now what is a mustard seed mustard
[1:02:38] seed of course is the smallest of all
[1:02:40] seeds
[1:02:41] we know that a mustard seed is the
[1:02:43] smallest of all seeds but it is also a
[1:02:47] mustard seed cannot be mixed with
[1:02:48] anything else
[1:02:50] it has to remain
[1:02:51] virtuous
[1:02:53] a mustard seed has to be has to have
[1:02:56] fidelity it cannot be mixed and your
[1:02:59] faith cannot be mixed with anything else
[1:03:01] it has to stay pure it has to stay
[1:03:05] unfaint
[1:03:07] i don't know if you all know brother
[1:03:09] green used to go around and give out the
[1:03:10] mustard seeds i put a bunch of mustard
[1:03:12] seeds in 1917. that little dark spot in
[1:03:15] there underneath that yellow sticker
[1:03:17] that's a bunch of mustard seeds not just
[1:03:19] one
[1:03:20] that's a whole bunch of mustard seeds i
[1:03:22] never call it a canada but there's
[1:03:23] probably 20 or 30 mustard seeds just
[1:03:25] under that little
[1:03:26] sticker thing there i keep them there
[1:03:28] matthew 17 to remind me
[1:03:31] faith to grain of a mustard seed move
[1:03:33] mountains
[1:03:34] small yes but it cannot be mixed
[1:03:37] cannot muster cannot be mixed with
[1:03:39] anything else nor can our faith be mixed
[1:03:42] with anything else it has to be fidelity
[1:03:45] it has to be pure it has to be virtuous
[1:03:48] our faith has to be virtuous there can
[1:03:50] be no leaven
[1:03:52] none not a crumb
[1:03:54] there can be no doubt there can be no
[1:03:56] unbelief it has to be pure faith
[1:04:00] faith in god's word faith in the truth
[1:04:02] of what god's word is amen must be faith
[1:04:06] it's a life lived not a single incident
[1:04:09] the just live by faith now page over
[1:04:13] romans chapter 3
[1:04:20] romans chapter 3.
[1:04:31] amen romans chapter 3 we'll start
[1:04:33] reading with the
[1:04:34] verse 21
[1:04:37] but now the righteousness of god the
[1:04:39] righteousness of god
[1:04:41] what does that sound like
[1:04:44] sounds to me like god is righteous what
[1:04:46] is righteous
[1:04:48] righteous means someone who is in there
[1:04:50] ought to be conditioned
[1:04:52] to be righteous is to be in your
[1:04:55] rightful position your rightful place
[1:04:59] amen god is righteous correct because
[1:05:02] god is always in the proper position god
[1:05:05] is always in the proper place
[1:05:07] amen i told y'all about this job
[1:05:12] that i'm getting ready to take and
[1:05:14] the man asked me
[1:05:18] he said when we were talking about
[1:05:20] the putting the building together and
[1:05:23] all that we do to fix that and to build
[1:05:25] it
[1:05:26] and he said obviously there's things
[1:05:29] that we don't do correctly there's
[1:05:30] probably things that can be done better
[1:05:32] i said well are you god
[1:05:34] he said well of course not i said then
[1:05:36] there's always going to be a way to
[1:05:38] improve something because god's the only
[1:05:40] one that's perfect god's the only one
[1:05:42] that does it exactly the right way the
[1:05:44] first time only time every word every
[1:05:47] thought everything god ever does is
[1:05:49] perfect the first time it cannot be
[1:05:52] improved on
[1:05:53] it cannot be made better
[1:05:55] everything god does is exactly right and
[1:05:57] perfect so i got to minister to the man
[1:05:59] just a little bit
[1:06:00] but everything god does it's perfect
[1:06:04] always take your opportunities when you
[1:06:05] get them correct so
[1:06:07] but god is righteous now now the
[1:06:10] righteousness of god without the law is
[1:06:13] manifest
[1:06:14] being witnessed by the law and the
[1:06:16] prophets so the righteousness of god
[1:06:18] he's speaking up here is the giving of
[1:06:20] jesus christ
[1:06:21] jesus christ being the son of god that
[1:06:24] one that was in his rightful position
[1:06:27] so that righteousness of god
[1:06:30] came down
[1:06:31] and manifested itself before us
[1:06:34] now why
[1:06:36] amongst the many other reasons did his
[1:06:39] son come did jesus come to manifest
[1:06:42] himself here and do what he did in that
[1:06:44] position that god placed him now
[1:06:47] remember
[1:06:49] you can have no greater faith in your
[1:06:51] life
[1:06:52] than when you know that you're in the
[1:06:55] center of god's perfect will
[1:06:57] you'll have no greater faith in your
[1:06:59] life than when you know where you're
[1:07:01] standing with god that's when you have
[1:07:03] the greatest faith that's when you can
[1:07:05] stand on what you know is right now you
[1:07:07] can have faith and people do have faith
[1:07:10] other times other ways but you can have
[1:07:12] no greater faith than when you're
[1:07:14] standing why do you think brother
[1:07:15] branham could stand there like hattie
[1:07:17] wright and say
[1:07:18] you can have whatever you want
[1:07:22] you think a man would make a fool of
[1:07:23] himself in front of all those people
[1:07:25] with it being recorded and not have god
[1:07:28] speaking to him to tell that woman
[1:07:31] that he knew that through the
[1:07:33] righteousness of god that that word was
[1:07:35] going to be manifest to her because god
[1:07:38] gave it to him and him standing there in
[1:07:40] the middle of god's perfect will
[1:07:42] of course he knew it and he could speak
[1:07:45] it
[1:07:46] because he believed it
[1:07:48] faith living by faith and when he spoken
[1:07:50] and she spoke what she wanted what was
[1:07:53] her harsh desire god gave it to her
[1:07:55] right amen what better way to know to
[1:07:58] have that faith than when you're in the
[1:08:00] center of god's perfect will the
[1:08:02] righteousness of god
[1:08:05] amen jesus christ without the law
[1:08:08] jesus without the law is manifested when
[1:08:11] he manifested jesus came forth
[1:08:13] manifested remember that's to be made
[1:08:16] known to manifest something is to let it
[1:08:18] be known
[1:08:19] to show it to open it to reveal it
[1:08:23] jesus christ came
[1:08:25] manifested
[1:08:26] witnessed by the law
[1:08:28] the torah and all that were there the
[1:08:30] the pharisees sadducees and the prophets
[1:08:34] which uh even the righteousness of god
[1:08:37] which is by faith of jesus christ now
[1:08:40] the righteousness
[1:08:42] condescended and manifested himself
[1:08:46] without the law but before the law and
[1:08:49] the prophets
[1:08:50] that that righteousness
[1:08:52] which is by faith
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:56] now i can ask you to raise your hand to
[1:08:58] how many of you here believe that you
[1:08:59] are righteous
[1:09:01] or believe that you are the very
[1:09:03] righteousness of jesus christ i could
[1:09:06] ask you that
[1:09:07] i don't know how many hands i'd get
[1:09:09] raised
[1:09:10] being we're in church i might get a lot
[1:09:12] of hands
[1:09:13] but tomorrow afternoon after a day's
[1:09:14] work or something
[1:09:16] it might be a different story
[1:09:18] you know why because we're so obsessed
[1:09:20] with our mirrors
[1:09:23] we are so
[1:09:24] unfortunately and it is in this country
[1:09:26] in this world we are so obsessed with
[1:09:28] our mirrors
[1:09:30] quit looking at what you see in the
[1:09:32] mirror and look at what you see in the
[1:09:34] mirror of god's word amen don't look at
[1:09:36] what the devil tries to convince you or
[1:09:38] talk to you about that you are what you
[1:09:40] see in the mirror believe you are what
[1:09:42] god says you are amen
[1:09:45] and god says that you are righteous
[1:09:48] because the righteousness of god which
[1:09:50] is by faith of jesus christ well do you
[1:09:53] have faith that jesus christ was the son
[1:09:55] of god the lamb of god to come and die
[1:09:58] and shed his blood and take your sin
[1:10:00] away
[1:10:00] to justify you and to put you in his
[1:10:03] will
[1:10:05] do you believe that
[1:10:07] well if you believe that by the faith of
[1:10:09] jesus christ what does that make you
[1:10:12] that makes you righteous that puts you
[1:10:15] in your ought to be conditioned
[1:10:18] that puts you in your rightful place in
[1:10:20] the mind of god
[1:10:22] and that's and when you know that you're
[1:10:24] in your rightful place
[1:10:27] every devil of hell can come and try to
[1:10:29] convince you otherwise but you know that
[1:10:32] you're standing where you're supposed to
[1:10:34] be in god's word and will
[1:10:37] don't matter what anybody else says
[1:10:39] somebody can come by satan can incarnate
[1:10:42] somebody says oh now you shouldn't be
[1:10:44] going you shouldn't be doing you
[1:10:45] shouldn't be and you shouldn't amen but
[1:10:48] when god speaks to you it doesn't matter
[1:10:50] what they say
[1:10:51] it doesn't matter what anybody else
[1:10:52] tries to tell you doesn't matter how
[1:10:54] much the devil tries to convince you
[1:10:55] you're not the word says you are amen
[1:10:59] and that puts you in your rightful
[1:11:01] position
[1:11:02] you're in your right standing in the
[1:11:04] sonship of jesus christ
[1:11:07] and in your right position the sonship
[1:11:09] of jesus quit looking in the mirror
[1:11:12] just try to garner your faith
[1:11:15] look in the word
[1:11:16] amen look in the word that will bring
[1:11:19] you the faith that you need to tackle
[1:11:21] any challenge that might come in your
[1:11:23] way
[1:11:24] amen the righteousness even the
[1:11:26] righteousness of god the righteousness
[1:11:28] of god which is by faith
[1:11:32] of jesus christ do you believe in jesus
[1:11:34] christ
[1:11:36] well then where does that put you
[1:11:38] amen where does that put you i know we
[1:11:41] don't like saying it
[1:11:43] because the mistakes you made this week
[1:11:45] or this morning or yesterday or whatever
[1:11:46] it was or things you said or did or
[1:11:48] the traps you got caught in whatever
[1:11:50] forget that right
[1:11:53] you are justified yes
[1:11:55] what does justified mean
[1:11:58] you never
[1:11:59] did it
[1:12:00] satan is trying to defeat you with
[1:12:02] something that never happened
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] he's trying to destroy you with
[1:12:10] something that in the mind of god never
[1:12:13] even happened right
[1:12:15] praise the lord
[1:12:17] don't let him defeat you that way
[1:12:20] we are the righteousness of jesus christ
[1:12:24] by faith
[1:12:26] unto all and upon all them upon all them
[1:12:30] that believe and that's the same greek
[1:12:33] word as faith
[1:12:34] same word here of faith same exact word
[1:12:37] even though it says believe which sounds
[1:12:39] like
[1:12:40] to me when i see the word believe it
[1:12:43] sounds to me like a lesser word than
[1:12:45] faith
[1:12:47] to me
[1:12:48] that might not to you believe just means
[1:12:51] well i believe it
[1:12:52] faith is a step up to me but in the
[1:12:55] greek it's the exact same word i looked
[1:12:57] it up exact same greek word
[1:12:59] so there's no difference in the faith
[1:13:01] and belief so unto all them that believe
[1:13:06] there is no difference
[1:13:09] amen amen praise the lord
[1:13:12] oh god let that raise our faith
[1:13:14] let that bring us up to that place that
[1:13:16] we're supposed to live in you you know
[1:13:18] because we live brother brandon said 60
[1:13:20] years ago we're living so far below our
[1:13:22] privileges yes
[1:13:24] oh and i hate to say it today but
[1:13:26] we still are
[1:13:28] amen so far below our privilege as
[1:13:30] saints but there is no difference for
[1:13:34] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:13:35] glory of god being justified freely by
[1:13:38] his grace through the redemption that is
[1:13:41] in christ jesus
[1:13:43] the redemption now we've got a
[1:13:45] redemption that's taking place a
[1:13:47] purchase
[1:13:48] a purchased possession because being
[1:13:51] redeemed through the blood of christ has
[1:13:54] purchased you and brought you out of
[1:13:57] where you used to be
[1:13:59] amen in your sinful condition whom god
[1:14:01] has set forth to be a perpetuation
[1:14:04] through faith now the perpetuation
[1:14:07] through faith means that our faith
[1:14:10] helps us understand
[1:14:12] that god took our place
[1:14:15] he perpetuated on our behalf
[1:14:19] it's like this word
[1:14:21] is uh is coupled with the word used in
[1:14:24] the in the hebrew in the old testament
[1:14:26] for mercy seat
[1:14:29] that mercy seat that was there in the
[1:14:31] holies of holies
[1:14:32] was the place that the priest was to go
[1:14:35] to make intercession on behalf of the
[1:14:37] entire camp
[1:14:39] the entire group of people were to be a
[1:14:42] forgiven based on that mercy seat being
[1:14:45] present and every of course everything
[1:14:47] that god required of him to do and to
[1:14:50] say and to bring forth that mercy seat
[1:14:53] that blood of christ then on that mercy
[1:14:56] seat became that perpetuation it was
[1:14:58] forgiveness of sin for them
[1:15:01] and it is an annihilation of sin for us
[1:15:04] because he took our place
[1:15:06] we don't have to go to calvary
[1:15:09] every year every year
[1:15:11] i think even this past christmas you
[1:15:14] read about or easter
[1:15:16] you read about these people who
[1:15:17] voluntarily allow themselves to be
[1:15:20] crucified on a cross
[1:15:22] i think even a young man died this year
[1:15:24] somewhere
[1:15:26] from being crucified on the cross i
[1:15:27] think why would you do that he did it
[1:15:30] for you
[1:15:32] you don't need to do that you don't need
[1:15:34] to go there you don't need to suffer
[1:15:36] that he became our perpetuation
[1:15:41] he did it so we don't have to
[1:15:44] he became us
[1:15:46] so that we could become him
[1:15:48] the very righteousness of god himself
[1:15:52] the just living by faith
[1:15:55] because you must have faith to believe
[1:15:57] that because that's not something that's
[1:15:58] tangible
[1:16:00] you're not going to see that you're not
[1:16:02] going to feel that not with your hands
[1:16:04] you might feel it in your soul but
[1:16:05] you're not going to feel it with your
[1:16:07] hands
[1:16:08] you're you're not going to see it you've
[1:16:09] got to believe it because the word says
[1:16:12] so
[1:16:12] that's the beginning of our faith
[1:16:15] it's like the statue of a perfect man
[1:16:16] what's the bottom line the bottom
[1:16:18] foundation of that house is faith
[1:16:22] you try to build on anything other than
[1:16:23] faith and it will come up to the ground
[1:16:27] faith
[1:16:28] god sent forth jesus it doesn't say
[1:16:32] jesus but we know that from what he just
[1:16:34] said
[1:16:35] to be a perpetuation to take our place
[1:16:40] through faith in his blood and we
[1:16:42] believe that we accept
[1:16:45] that perpetuation remember a pardon is
[1:16:49] not a pardon unless it is accepted as a
[1:16:51] pardon even in the land even in the
[1:16:54] country
[1:16:55] a pardon is not a pardon unless is
[1:16:57] accepted as a pardon yes jesus came and
[1:16:59] became a perpetuation for our sin a
[1:17:02] perpetuation for our sin but unless we
[1:17:04] believe it and accept it by faith in
[1:17:06] christ through his blood it doesn't make
[1:17:09] any difference
[1:17:11] he didn't do it in vain because there's
[1:17:13] going to be somebody to believe it
[1:17:16] but we have to believe that
[1:17:18] the just believe that because it's his
[1:17:21] blood faith in that blood that helps us
[1:17:24] understand he took my place
[1:17:26] he took my place and he took my place so
[1:17:28] i could take his he became me so i could
[1:17:31] become him
[1:17:33] praise the lord
[1:17:34] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:17:36] remission of sin that is to remit to do
[1:17:39] away with praise god
[1:17:41] done away
[1:17:43] of sin that are passed through the
[1:17:45] forbearance of god to declare i say at
[1:17:48] this time his righteousness that he
[1:17:50] might be just and
[1:17:53] he might be just and the justifier of
[1:17:57] him
[1:17:58] me
[1:18:00] you
[1:18:01] him which believeth faith in jesus amen
[1:18:06] now are you one of them
[1:18:09] then put your place there put your name
[1:18:11] there yeah
[1:18:12] put your life in that scripture right
[1:18:14] there
[1:18:15] the justifier of you
[1:18:19] amen the justifier of you me which
[1:18:21] believeth in jesus
[1:18:23] because i believe
[1:18:25] i have faith i know
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:29] praise the lord
[1:18:30] where is boasting then
[1:18:33] it is excluded by what law of words made
[1:18:36] by the law of faith therefore we
[1:18:38] conclude that a man is justified by
[1:18:40] faith without the deeds of the law
[1:18:44] justified without the deeds
[1:18:48] is he the god of the jews only
[1:18:51] is he not also of the gentiles yes of
[1:18:53] the gentiles also
[1:18:56] seeing it is one god which shall justify
[1:18:59] the circumcision by faith and
[1:19:02] uncircumcision through faith
[1:19:04] so it's faith either way again no
[1:19:07] difference
[1:19:08] i know it was applied in a different
[1:19:10] context earlier but it's the same
[1:19:12] meaning
[1:19:13] there is no difference praise the lord
[1:19:16] circumcision uncircumcision it's all
[1:19:18] through faith
[1:19:20] believing
[1:19:22] do we then make void the law through
[1:19:25] faith god forbid yea we establish the
[1:19:28] law
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:30] by faith
[1:19:31] because we believe what god's word says
[1:19:34] now
[1:19:35] a man is justified with uh by faith
[1:19:39] without the deeds of the law thank god
[1:19:42] because they tried through an entire old
[1:19:44] testament for thousands of years to try
[1:19:46] to be justified in a law and it could
[1:19:49] not work
[1:19:50] a fallen man
[1:19:52] from the garden of eden could never be
[1:19:54] justified by deeds because there's
[1:19:57] nothing that could ever have made us in
[1:19:59] our flesh good enough to please the lord
[1:20:02] no matter how hard we try
[1:20:04] no matter what we do no matter what we
[1:20:06] give no matter how we live our lives no
[1:20:09] matter how far people seclude themselves
[1:20:11] or become monks or priests or put
[1:20:14] themselves in a building separate from
[1:20:16] anything else you're born with a fallen
[1:20:19] nature
[1:20:20] and there's nothing we can do in our
[1:20:22] flesh that would ever be good enough
[1:20:25] through any law or rules or regulations
[1:20:28] or beings
[1:20:29] to be able to please him to ever be able
[1:20:32] to reach a place of righteousness it's
[1:20:34] got to be by faith through the blood of
[1:20:36] christ and through that perpetuation
[1:20:38] knowing that he took our place yes
[1:20:41] that's the only way can't be by deeds
[1:20:44] but now look james chapter 2.
[1:20:51] now people look at that and they say
[1:20:52] well
[1:20:54] we can just do what we want then
[1:20:57] god god is okay with that
[1:21:00] he has amazing grace yes he does
[1:21:03] yeah his mason his grace is absolutely
[1:21:05] amazing but his grace is not to be
[1:21:07] trampled over
[1:21:09] his grace is not to be made a disgrace
[1:21:11] amen amen think well i can i can do what
[1:21:14] i want get away with it no no no it
[1:21:16] doesn't work that way i mean if you feel
[1:21:18] that way if you believe that you might
[1:21:19] as well just go up the catholic church
[1:21:20] or just go out of religion or god all
[1:21:22] together
[1:21:24] because it doesn't work that way right
[1:21:26] and well god i just i tell this lie god
[1:21:28] forgive me it doesn't work that way
[1:21:31] amen there's a difference
[1:21:32] between willfully doing something and
[1:21:35] not willfully doing something but maybe
[1:21:37] we'll talk about that another time but
[1:21:38] there's a difference
[1:21:40] amen the bible says if you sin willfully
[1:21:44] after having received the knowledge
[1:21:46] there remains no more sacrifice
[1:21:48] there is a willful doing it
[1:21:50] and then there's those mistakes that are
[1:21:53] made that are not willful done
[1:21:55] but the deeds can never save you
[1:21:59] no matter how much religions and people
[1:22:01] try to do it they still try to do it
[1:22:03] even
[1:22:06] i sometimes i hate doing this but
[1:22:08] i've met
[1:22:11] several people even that say they're in
[1:22:13] this message and they they still try to
[1:22:16] make it to heaven on their deeds
[1:22:18] me and my wife were sitting in a
[1:22:20] restaurant yesterday having some fish
[1:22:22] and
[1:22:23] song came on and said they're working
[1:22:24] hard to get to heaven
[1:22:28] and people love his country music song
[1:22:30] and people love that you know working
[1:22:32] hard what says heaven working hard who's
[1:22:34] working hard to get to heaven
[1:22:36] well first of all you can't get there by
[1:22:38] working hard
[1:22:40] am i it doesn't work that way right
[1:22:42] pardon the
[1:22:44] redundancy it doesn't work that way
[1:22:47] you can't work your way into heaven you
[1:22:49] can't get there by good deeds but
[1:22:53] that being said look what james says we
[1:22:55] know this scripture but i just want to
[1:22:57] read it 7 2 17
[1:23:00] even so faith
[1:23:02] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[1:23:07] faith is a living oracle
[1:23:09] that's why you can live in faith
[1:23:12] you can live the just can live by faith
[1:23:15] because faith itself is a living oracle
[1:23:17] it is a constant perpetual existence
[1:23:21] of a spirit life that god
[1:23:25] that comes out of god
[1:23:26] so faith is
[1:23:28] alive it's a living oracle
[1:23:30] but faith alone without works with it
[1:23:34] being alone is dead
[1:23:35] because
[1:23:36] if it's living
[1:23:38] if it's
[1:23:40] if it's a verb if it's an action there's
[1:23:42] going to be something to follow
[1:23:45] there's going to be examples there's
[1:23:47] going to be uh
[1:23:49] things that you can look and point to
[1:23:51] and and and examine as as an evidence of
[1:23:56] your faith
[1:23:57] and evidence if you will
[1:23:59] faith
[1:24:01] even so
[1:24:03] if not without works is dead being alone
[1:24:06] yeah a man may say thou has faith and i
[1:24:09] have works
[1:24:11] show me thy faith without thy works and
[1:24:13] i will show thee my faith by my words
[1:24:16] amen some people try to work their way
[1:24:19] to heaven
[1:24:20] and that's all they got is works deeds
[1:24:23] but if you truly have faith and believe
[1:24:26] god
[1:24:28] to me i know i know the bible says works
[1:24:32] deeds
[1:24:33] if you truly have faith
[1:24:36] it's it's not a work
[1:24:40] if you truly are living by faith
[1:24:44] even when things
[1:24:47] are
[1:24:49] examples
[1:24:51] that happen in your life through faith
[1:24:54] it's not a work not to me
[1:24:57] i don't consider it a word now
[1:25:00] james identifies it as
[1:25:02] a work and that's okay
[1:25:04] but i want you to express to you how i
[1:25:06] feel about it
[1:25:08] if you have faith and you're living
[1:25:10] godly in christ jesus and that faith is
[1:25:12] alive in you and it's the life that you
[1:25:15] live it's a part of who you are it's
[1:25:17] just living your life it's not doing a
[1:25:20] work
[1:25:21] it happens in your life because of who
[1:25:23] you are not because of what you do
[1:25:27] understand
[1:25:28] the
[1:25:29] the results of your faith
[1:25:33] if you're a born again christian living
[1:25:36] by faith just living by faith
[1:25:39] it is something that happens
[1:25:42] because it's a part of you yes not
[1:25:45] because it's something that you did
[1:25:48] a work to me is something that you do
[1:25:53] the rich um ruler was full of them
[1:25:55] wasn't he
[1:25:56] the rich young ruler had deeds probably
[1:25:58] outside any of us
[1:26:00] he was full of deeds and worse the rich
[1:26:02] young ruler gave money and did all the
[1:26:04] things in the church and uh
[1:26:06] all the things that he did brother
[1:26:08] braham talks about dramatizing the story
[1:26:10] he was he was a great man
[1:26:12] he was full of works but where'd he end
[1:26:15] up
[1:26:17] he did
[1:26:18] something
[1:26:21] now don't misunderstand me it is things
[1:26:24] that we do
[1:26:25] but it's not that we do it because it's
[1:26:27] a work we just do it because we it's
[1:26:30] just who we are yes i've told you so
[1:26:32] many times friend
[1:26:34] and i'll say it again
[1:26:37] i don't live the life of a chinese woman
[1:26:42] why don't i live the life of a chinese
[1:26:44] woman
[1:26:46] because i'm not a chinese woman
[1:26:50] i live the life of a white male
[1:26:53] and there's only one reason i live the
[1:26:55] life of a white male
[1:26:57] it's because i'm a white male
[1:27:02] i live my life because that's who i am
[1:27:05] it's not a deed that i do i don't go
[1:27:08] around faking every day to be a white
[1:27:10] man
[1:27:12] i don't fake or feign some kind of uh
[1:27:16] uh
[1:27:16] good misconception that i'm a white man
[1:27:19] i just live it because that's who i am
[1:27:22] and when you have faith and you live
[1:27:24] this faith in christ jesus all the
[1:27:26] things that become in your life as a
[1:27:28] result of that are just living your life
[1:27:33] yes it's things you do but it to me it's
[1:27:35] not a work
[1:27:37] work is something that you just you take
[1:27:39] out and you go and you do it
[1:27:42] but that's not what you do when you live
[1:27:44] it when you live it just becomes a part
[1:27:45] of your life
[1:27:47] you just walk down the street
[1:27:50] living your life
[1:27:52] and in your wake is the results of that
[1:27:55] life amen
[1:27:56] not a work
[1:27:57] not works not deeds but a result of your
[1:28:01] life
[1:28:02] if your life is godly in christ jesus
[1:28:05] the wake of your walk is going to be the
[1:28:08] results of who you are
[1:28:11] not what you do
[1:28:12] amen
[1:28:14] now if you are who you are you're going
[1:28:16] to do what you're supposed to do yes and
[1:28:19] what's left behind you all the results
[1:28:22] of that that james calls works and deeds
[1:28:25] are going to be there
[1:28:26] yes they're going to be there but
[1:28:28] they're only going to be there because
[1:28:29] that's who you are that's right it's
[1:28:31] because the life you live
[1:28:33] is because of the person that you are in
[1:28:36] christ jesus
[1:28:37] and that's the result of it
[1:28:39] praise the lord now that's the way i see
[1:28:42] it now
[1:28:43] we can call them works and deeds all we
[1:28:44] want that's fine i know what the bible
[1:28:46] says i just give you my example what i
[1:28:48] believe that when a christian lives
[1:28:50] their life what it really means to be a
[1:28:52] christian
[1:28:54] amen those things are what's left behind
[1:28:57] those are the things that are that are
[1:28:59] left in your wake when you do what
[1:29:00] you're supposed to do and live the life
[1:29:02] the way you're supposed to live
[1:29:04] amen your faith produces the deeds the
[1:29:07] just live by faith but you can't be
[1:29:10] justified without faith
[1:29:15] you take that to some scientist
[1:29:18] people stream and yell believe the
[1:29:20] science they yell and scream believe the
[1:29:22] science but how many how many
[1:29:24] genders do we have now
[1:29:26] i heard my partner say the other day me
[1:29:28] and michael went and got our hair cut
[1:29:29] monday and
[1:29:31] uh
[1:29:32] he said
[1:29:34] we were talking about it a little bit he
[1:29:35] said yeah god made man and woman
[1:29:37] democrats made all the rest of them
[1:29:39] that's that's
[1:29:41] probably not a good joke to tell behind
[1:29:42] the court
[1:29:46] but man and woman that's that's where i
[1:29:48] stand that's what i believe
[1:29:50] amen but god made
[1:29:52] that's what god made everything else is
[1:29:54] perversion
[1:29:55] but that's god's word now
[1:29:57] um
[1:29:58] let's go to colossians
[1:30:01] chapter 2.
[1:30:04] so you try to feed that to a scientist
[1:30:05] your faith
[1:30:09] your faith is what justifies you
[1:30:11] but you can't be justified without the
[1:30:13] faith
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:18] and your faith will produce the deeds
[1:30:21] colossians chapter 2 verse 4
[1:30:26] and this i say lest any man should
[1:30:28] beguile you with enticing words
[1:30:30] for though i be absent in the flesh yet
[1:30:32] i am with you in the spirit joining and
[1:30:35] beholding your order and the
[1:30:37] steadfastness of your faith in christ
[1:30:40] as ye have therefore received christ
[1:30:43] jesus the lord
[1:30:45] so walk ye
[1:30:46] in him here we go now
[1:30:49] walk ye in him so what does it become
[1:30:51] becomes a wall
[1:30:53] it becomes a light it's just a life
[1:30:55] lived amen walking in him rooted and
[1:30:59] built up in him established
[1:31:02] in the faith
[1:31:04] established again
[1:31:06] a life
[1:31:07] the just shall live by faith rooted
[1:31:10] built up in him established in the faith
[1:31:13] as ye have been taught abounding therein
[1:31:16] with thanksgiving
[1:31:18] it becomes your foundation
[1:31:20] it is your foundation
[1:31:23] if you're a christian
[1:31:25] built on the model of the statue of
[1:31:27] perfect man your foundation must be
[1:31:29] faith
[1:31:30] rooted grounded built up from there
[1:31:33] in that faith that faith is what becomes
[1:31:36] the foundation of everything you do
[1:31:38] second corinthians chapter five
[1:31:43] verse 5
[1:31:45] now he that hath wrought us for the
[1:31:47] selfsame thing is god
[1:31:49] who also has given us the earnest of the
[1:31:52] spirit
[1:31:54] therefore we are always confident
[1:31:56] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[1:31:58] the body we are absent from the lord for
[1:32:00] we walk
[1:32:02] by faith
[1:32:03] we walk by faith
[1:32:06] not by sight
[1:32:08] our walk
[1:32:10] living
[1:32:11] the just live by faith
[1:32:15] our walk is faith
[1:32:16] amen that's how we walk faith not by
[1:32:20] what we can see
[1:32:21] amen one more i'm going to close here
[1:32:23] hebrews chapter 10 verse 22
[1:32:27] let us draw near with a true heart
[1:32:30] in full assurance of faith having our
[1:32:32] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[1:32:34] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:32:36] let us hold fast the profession of our
[1:32:39] faith without wavering for he is
[1:32:41] faithful that promised and let us
[1:32:43] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:32:46] love and to good works
[1:32:48] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:32:50] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:32:52] is but exhorting one another and so much
[1:32:55] more as you see that day approaching
[1:32:58] amen as we live it as we walk it
[1:33:01] it is our lives it is who we are
[1:33:04] amen the just shall live by faith
[1:33:08] it's how we live
[1:33:11] martin luther brought it out as a rebuke
[1:33:13] to the catholic church
[1:33:14] who majored in all the works all the
[1:33:17] deeds
[1:33:18] you can't even be a christian you can't
[1:33:20] belong to catholic church or whatever
[1:33:21] the thing is unless you're just full of
[1:33:24] all the things you do that are right and
[1:33:26] good
[1:33:28] and all those things are good
[1:33:31] all those things are good to do the
[1:33:32] things that are right and good
[1:33:34] amen but what was it
[1:33:37] what would it be like then
[1:33:39] to try to compare that to jesus walking
[1:33:42] in the temple with platted ropes and
[1:33:44] beating him out of the temple right
[1:33:47] oh my
[1:33:48] was that love you better believe it was
[1:33:51] love
[1:33:52] some of the greatest love ever shown
[1:33:54] amen outside of calvary of course
[1:33:56] was the love that he showed that was
[1:33:58] corrective to those people to try to
[1:34:00] make them
[1:34:01] do what is right he took the ropes and
[1:34:02] flatted them and beat him out of the
[1:34:04] temple
[1:34:05] making that temple making that sanctuary
[1:34:08] that house of god into a den of ill
[1:34:11] refuge
[1:34:13] god set him straight jesus went and beat
[1:34:15] him out and he said well now that was
[1:34:16] that good deeds was that good works
[1:34:20] in the might is a man probably not in
[1:34:23] the eyes of god absolutely
[1:34:26] because he was protecting that sanctuary
[1:34:28] yes he was trying to protect the
[1:34:30] sanctity of that holy place and he beat
[1:34:33] them out because of how they were acting
[1:34:34] and what they were doing
[1:34:36] amen that's why we like to respect our
[1:34:38] sanctuary when we leave because we
[1:34:41] expect this this is where we meet god we
[1:34:43] have god everywhere but this is a
[1:34:45] special place in time that we come
[1:34:47] together to meet the lord jesus and we
[1:34:49] want it to stay that way yes it may not
[1:34:51] have looked righteous it may not look
[1:34:53] like good deeds or works to the
[1:34:55] to man
[1:34:57] but to god that was a righteous as jesus
[1:34:59] did while he was on this earth
[1:35:01] it was to be the
[1:35:03] mind of god
[1:35:05] perfect will of god
[1:35:06] when you're in the center of god's
[1:35:08] perfect will
[1:35:10] nothing else matters you can have the
[1:35:12] faith to believe
[1:35:13] when jesus went to the garden of
[1:35:15] gethsemane his sweat became his drops of
[1:35:17] blood but he did that why because he
[1:35:19] even asked if this cup could pass but he
[1:35:21] knew what that will was
[1:35:23] and in that perfect will
[1:35:26] he could stand and believe and walk to a
[1:35:28] calvary be crucified
[1:35:30] shed his blood give his life for us
[1:35:32] because he knew
[1:35:33] i mean how's the song go when he was on
[1:35:36] the cross i was on his mind
