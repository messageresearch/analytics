I'm going to start back here got a few more parts of this that I want to bring to you on the Holy Ghost the holy spirit amen this is part eight the Holy Spirit part eight praise the lord we got like I

Ghost in you that makes him a defeated spirit amen praise the Lord in your life amen now Satan we know is already a defeated foe but in your life personally he is a defeated foe because of the new birth yes amen because of the spirit living in you praise the Lord Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 though we want to begin reading before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus father we're so very thankful Lord again of this beautiful day this place you give us Lord of your spirit in our lives for you God coming into this place once again sweeping through

word once again to our hearts and let let it be accomplished the purpose that you have for this service today as we all committed into your hands For Your Glory and Honor we commit it Lord and we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis 3 21. unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them amen you can be seated if you'd like praise the Lord the scripture that we read before every one of these times recognizing the significance of the holy spirit in our lives and the significance of what the Lord Jesus God Almighty did back in the Garden of Eden Way Back in Genesis 3 to show to us what he was going to continue to do down through time amen now this is the holy spirit part eight I want to talk about a defeated enemy amen who is our enemy we only have one enemy it's not one another it's not the church down the street it's not your mama daddy it's not your brother or sister it's the devil it's the only enemy we have saints he is the only one that wants to send you to Hell he's the only one that wants to destroy your life he's the only one that wants to take every bit of joy peace happiness love and anything good away from you is the devil right amen he's the only one he's the enemy but praise the Lord today I want to talk about a defeated enemy an enemy that has already been defeated before we get back to the word I want to go to Genesis chapter 22 now but before we get back to that I want you to recognize her think in your mind what kind of a battle would it be like what kind of a war would it be if we win against an army that absolutely had no fighting Spirit they had no Weaponry they had no intelligence of how to fight a war they had nothing on their side to be able to fight against would that be much of a fight no amen wouldn't be much of a fight you look at David and Goliath look at David and Goliath for a minute Goliath was a huge massive individual with with fingers and hands the size of that could go all the way around a basketball not even just Palm it 14 inch fingers and uh the massiveness that the the man's head would touch a basketball rim he was so massive and Little David coming out little ready David just insignificant to the world didn't look like much amen but the truth of it is even though David looked like the puny individual the Ruddy little boy that he was he had more Authority and more power and excuse me of this thing but in his little pinky then Goliath had in his entire massive being yes amen because he had God by his side he had the Lord with him he had he had uh the almighty with him following him now goliath he was almost ashamed to fight this little boy but that little boy said today I'm gonna take your head off and I'm gonna feed your flesh to the fowls of the air did he do it amen why because Goliath was already a defeated foe because God was with David amen amen Goliath didn't have a chance I don't care if he had sores and swords and and Shields and all that the Bible says he had made absolutely no difference all it took was one small smooth stone that David took out of the local Creek and he sung and it hit David right in the head the only spot that David had emptied or that Goliath had empty that David could have hit to bring the man down he was armored from head to toe but that one spot and that one spot is exactly just like God guiding a tree or a car through water guided that stone right to Goliath's forehead amen there was no battle to it there was no war to it it no Goliath didn't even take his sword out of a Sheen it was no battle Goliath was already defeated what do you think it would be today if we went against a an army that had no that had no guns they had no bullets they had no intelligent individuals to teach him or show him how to fight they had they they didn't have enough of anything to I mean there would be no there would be no there would be no war to that there would be no battle we sang a song that the Bible says that Satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom he made a devour friend but I want you to tell I want to tell you today to the Bride of Jesus Christ those that are born again and filled with the Holy Ghost Satan is a toothless lion he is a meow of a roar because he has nothing against the bride he has already defeated when was he defeated at Calvary Satan Was Defeated at Calvary now that Calvary experience of that Holy Spirit coming back on you has made you more than a conqueror it has made you the Victorious One it has made you to overcome all of the walls of the enemy because he is a defeated vote let's look at this now in Genesis chapter 22 we're going to go back and talk about Abraham again Genesis 22 verse 15. Genesis 22 15 and the age of the Lord now this is after Abraham had been faithful to God to offer Isaac as a sacrifice and God provided Abraham a lamb instead of his son to sacrifice and because it is obedience the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing our bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sandwiches upon the seashore and remember who we talked about those words amen it's not just a literal seat of Abraham but the spiritual Seed of Abraham which is us today which includes the bride because we go you go over Romans and find out that it tells us that that promise wasn't just for Abraham but for those who would believe it is to us through the Royal Seed of Abraham Jesus Christ we have become now Heirs of that promise amen what's the promise that by sea shall possess the Gate of his enemies praise the Lord thy seed now we are part of that is that our uh our heritage is that our lineage that we are a part of the faith Seed of Abraham that this promises to us that we now possess the gates of our enemy praise the Lord let's continue on amen and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice so Abraham returned unto his young man and they rose up and went together to Bear sheep and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba now if you have any kind of consternation about this if there's any doubt let's go to the New Testament Matthew chapter 16. amen some people today for some reason they don't want to obey the Old Testament they don't want to listen to the Old Testament for some reason to some people the Old Testament isn't a part of the Bible anymore I'm not sure where people get that from or they think the Old Testament doesn't exist anymore or the Old Testament isn't pertinent anymore but let me tell you today Saints the Old Testament is just as much God's word as the New Testament amen amen right praise the Lord Matthew chapter but if there's an issue there if anybody ever watches you got an issue with the Old Testament Matthew chapter 16. verse 17. Jesus answered her now Jesus asked him who do men say that I am now that's the background Jesus standing there with disciples and he said and he's asking them a question who the man say that I am what have you heard about me what have you heard that other people are saying about me who are they saying that I am Jesus answered and and Simon Peter answered Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou shock Simon barjona which means son of Jonah Simon son of Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it now what is this it not him but it because it's significant to understand what that is because without that understanding without that Revelation you can't understand or know by revelation of whom or on what the church the foundation of the church is built on you have to know what that is see and it is not a person amen people want to say like the Catholic Church want to say that the church they are the true church they say is built on Peter because Jesus then said that thou art Peter which means little Stone so they say that that church was built upon Peter and they claim him as the first pope that's what they believe yeah but Peter is not an it I mean even this world of all the political correctness and and and pronouns that people want to be uh uh identified in is still not a person even in all the gender identity stuff today it is still not a person now I know it was on the TV show of Adam's Family doesn't it but that's fiction that was fiction it is not a person listen now Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven revealed it and I say unto also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it's again it's what is this it that the church is built upon they again Peter Catholic Church will say pomp eater many people want to say it's Jesus that the church is built on and we understand the foundation of the church is Jesus but if you don't understand by Revelation who Jesus is then it's irrelevant to you it doesn't mean anything to you unless you know who Jesus is and if you think Jesus is just the first second or third person whatever they put him as in a in a godhead or in a trinity then you don't understand or have a revelation of how this Foundation is established it's established because of the Revelation the it is the revelation of who Jesus is yes yes the revelation of Jesus Christ being God Almighty is what God founded this church that Revelation not cutting him up in the three pieces not putting him in as the second person of a godhead not trying to include him in some Trinity but Jesus Christ is God Almighty amen amen that was his ignition and Upon This Rock Amen the rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is this church is founded the Revelation who Jesus is amen and you can go back and look there wasn't a single person baptized through history until uh until the Catholic churches form a nicia Romans 3 20 A.D there wasn't one single person baptized in the name of the titles of the followers on the Holy Ghost everybody through the scripture and on was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is actually a name amen which is actually the foundation by which this church is built anything other than that friend is not on the right foundation right your foundation is a seeking sin their Foundation is unstable but the foundation that this church the bride is built on is the foundation that Jesus Christ is God almighty amen he's the one in the same praise the Lord now look now that church is built on that Revelation it's built on that foundation and that church that bride today now a church is a called out group amen it means called out separated but the bride is called out from the church the literal Church of the world has been called out from the world but the bride has been called out of the church she is called out into a bright age for this last day she is a called out group of the called out amen the bride now built upon that built upon it that Revelation I will build my church and this bride this church the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against him why not because because she is the she is the the GateKeeper of the gates of hell amen what did what did God tell Abraham you will possess the gates of your enemy you possess you have the ownership of the front door of Satan's owned docile domicile you operate and own and have leadership over whether Satan can come or go oh think about that for a minute that's not just a frivolous promise things to understand that if Satan doesn't tell us what to do we tell him what to do right right now he obeys us now not because of who I am Newton Bennett but because of the life that's in me remember it's the life behind the name amen when the soul is fought and and God the Holy Spirit lives and he's sealed in there Amen in a place it it affects the spirit it's the nature of the spirit and into the body it's that new birth that separates you that makes you separate that's why the Vagabonds you could not tell that Spirit what to do because all he had was a Jesus who Paul priests and I'm afraid that's the same that a lot of people have today they only have enough Jesus to get them in trouble they only have enough Jesus to make their lives miserable friend if you're gonna come into this if you're going to do this if you're gonna be born again if you want to be a part of the body of Christ if you want to be a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ go with it don't don't go in a halfway am I don't say I want to dip a toe in or or half it half out that's the most miserable kind of life that you could ever live right amen it needs to be all in or all out now look when Jesus said that that gates of hell would not Prevail against that Revelation amen of Jesus Christ the foundation that this church this bride is built on he said and I give I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven now it's not a literal key you take out of your pocket and say I want to go on my front door it's not a literal key it's an authority it's a power-up through Authority that that God is giving to Peter God is saying Jesus is telling Peter down I am giving unto you the authority of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loosed on Earth shall be loosed in heaven now that scripture ought to settled baptism for anybody that cares anything about the scripture amen because God gave Peter people said well I do it the way Jesus said well Jesus right here gave Peter the keys that whatever he bowed on Earth was bound in heaven well if Peter come out with the keys and said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ don't you think that's what we ought to do amen he's the one with the keys he's the one with the authority he's the one that Jesus Christ said whatever you found here is bound in heaven I will honor what you do here I'll honor there now why did God give Peter that kind of authority because he knew Peter had the character to handle it correctly he knew that Peter wouldn't do anything outside of the word or anything outside of the spirit of Christ that would cause reproach amen that's why I gave him the authority now where does that Authority belong today amen if he was in the beginning there at the beginning of and Pentecost the spokesman of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came that that Authority simply passed through down Through the Ages that every single every single age had the exact same authority to this last stage this last stage now you can say because of the uh the the victory that she has won over sin over Satan now possesses The Authority the keys to the kingdom of heaven praise the Lord a new birth brought you into possession a a a a a born-again experience the Holy Spirit living in you brought that experience to your life only that will bring it to you the world can't give it there's no job can give it there's no government can give it the president can promise all he wants but he can't give this nobody brother random could not give this right right amen this has to come as your relationship with Jesus Christ personally Mom and Daddy can't give it Amen brother sister can't give it it's got to come personally to you by God Amen this key now this key is ownership this cave brings ownership because when it comes the possession of the gates of the uh of the enemy the gate you shall possess the gates of your enemy is that the promise to those of the face seed belongs to us now to those with authority of the revelation of who Jesus Christ is it belongs to us this Authority now you tell the devil whether he can come or go you tell the devil what to do people always thought you know devil go devil give me back devil do this at the other Satan uh he can only do what you allow him to do amen you have that Authority he is he is a defeated enemy to those who have the Holy Ghost now you can't do it if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're like the Vagabonds you again I assure you in the name of Jesus who Paul preached come out of the man back upon you ran out of the house wounded and naked because that Spirit looked at him and said I know Paul and I know Jesus but I don't know you what what was different about him because Paul had some Jesus was some and this man didn't have it he didn't have the Holy Spirit right he wasn't born again he didn't have this Authority and and friend if a person if you don't have it don't try it because it doesn't work amen but if you've got it and you're born again you possess it it belongs to you take what's yours it's your Authority amen Satan can't even go home unless you allow him to can't even go to his own home without your permission because you possess the Gate of the enemy praise the Lord you tell him where to go and where and where not to go you tell him what to do worried about this satin and family and things friend no no you possess it it belongs to you yes it's your Authority you take a hold of it your health your strength your life your blessings your peace your joy it's yours bounded on Earth is found in heaven amen look at this quote now possession to get at the end now we are more than conquerors pretty praise the Lord sorry I couldn't get my printer to work got a brand new printer it won't work I think it's the user more than it is the printer but anyway uh we're just walked right into it as an inheritance praise the Lord it means it belongs to you what is an inheritance amen if you if if your daddy died and left you a million dollars and you went to probate and the lawyer says your daddy left you a million dollars here it's yours to say well now I I don't think so that's probably not true I don't believe that uh he didn't have a million dollars uh uh whatever he wouldn't have left it to me it doesn't matter but if the judge says that it belongs to you friend it belongs to you but it's only yours when you take possession of it right it's not yours until you take possession of it when you take possession of it then it becomes yours amen praise the Lord it's your inheritance more than conquered now we are defeating now we are dealing with a defeat defeat sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated oh my wish I was twice my size now maybe I feel twice as good we are disputing with a conquered enemy that's my point Saints listen don't dispute with the devil you don't have to ask permission you're not devil would you please no you command him you tell him it's your Authority amen if you had that life if the life is behind the name you have that Authority you tell him whatever's bound here is bound in heaven amen you speak it it will be done you believe that now that with that power comes character you must have the character to go with it right amen without without that character you say I want this room to be filled with 100 bills amen doesn't work what's because that's not the character of Christ all right amen the power with the character look no wonder Paul could say when they was building a block to chop his head off he said oh death where's thy sting show me where you can make me swim or scream grave where's your Victory and you think you'll mold me out there I'll point to you an empty one over there and uh and I am I am in him he'll raise me up at the last day a defeated enemy the Royal Seed of Abraham praise the Lord listen now the Royal Seed of Abraham now the natural seed could not point to that but the Royal seed can conquer already look now already conquered praise the Lord that's what I want us to understand already conquered he's already conquered Saints amen he's already conquered for he has gone before us and conquered every gate for us he is now after 2 000 years he stands in the midst of us the mighty conqueror now not only did he conquer sickness he conquered Temptation he conquered every enemy he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he rose again two thousand years later here he stands Among Us this afternoon I will say the exact same thing here he stands Among Us this afternoon identifying himself as the mighty conqueror he is still here alive his promise as the Royal Seed of Abraham as we are that Royal Seed of Abraham by birth by New Birth we are the Royal Seed of Abraham that possess the Gate of the enemy praise the Lord not only is he defeated came to go home even not unless you let him if you let him then maybe he could go home he can't go home unless you let him praise the Lord let's go over to Galatians chapter 3. now we're talking about the Holy Spirit this whole thing is about the Holy Spirit the new Earth amen to understand what does that give us what does that what does that give us the rights to amen but we have to understand it belongs to us and it doesn't it but it's not ours until we take possession of it amen you about you have to take possession of it Galatians chapter 3 verse 6. amen even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham they that are what of the faith yeah those that are of the faith are you of the faith today you identify with this okay then the same are the children of Abraham well if you're the children Seed of Abraham then that promise belongs to you that promise belongs to you just as much as the natural Seed of Abraham that came forth That Couldn't actually take literal possession of what we own today amen they have possession of what they could for their day but today is the day that you own every bit of it it's your inheritance as the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed in Abraham so then they which are they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham you got any doubt the scripture plainly lets us know what belongs to us what our inheritance is what our position is what our possessions are belongs to us amen you don't have to fret over all the other stuff it's ours amen if if your family owned Walmart you could walk into Walmart you could take out anything you wanted now not shareholders and all that but if you just you owned it outright if you're on the corner store if you own this Denny's right here it belongs to you 100 belong to you you could walk that walk in sit out ask for the most expensive Meal which probably isn't very much a Denny's and you can get the most and and eat every minute and walk out the door it's yours belongs to you I can walk in and I can tell the kitchen help they're not working like they should I could tell the waiter they didn't do a very good job I I because it belongs to me it's mine you understand and when you take possession of it it shows that you believe that it's yours see some people it seems like are scared to take possession of it because when they take possession of it it makes them responsible and unfortunately today there's a horrible Spirit around the world of people not wanting to take responsibility for things uh they can Loot and still in cheat but it's somebody else's fault they can kill people and they can injure people and can push people in the Subways and they can cheat and steal and hit people upside the head with the ball back but it's somebody else's fault uh it's it's I my upbringing or I was cheated here or this have and excuse everything away there's no accountability right right every little Nuance in a person's life there's some kind of a medical diagnosis to call it the jqpf19723 and what is that I have no idea but they're probably going to come up with this one day because of some kind of a disorder now don't get me wrong I know that the Humanity's getting rotten friend but it comes a time where a person has to take personal responsibility for their own actions right and unfortunately today a lot of people don't want to take responsibility because once you take possession of it you're responsible for it amen your your family might own this Denny's but if you don't do it and treat it and and present it correctly it will fail and it won't be anybody's fault but yours right right you ever heard of the the phrase the book stops here not one of my favorite phrases but that's the truth it comes a place in time where somebody's got to take responsibility because there's always somebody every human walks this planet has someone they have to answer to yeah amen and that's God very much everybody I don't care who they are I don't care where they come from I don't care what Authority his position they have I don't care if they're the smartest richest most powerful doesn't matter every human answers to at least one and that's God people don't want to take that Authority because they don't want the responsibility friend would rock with the responsibility with that power comes great responsibility to handle it properly they meant to handle it correctly but if you're born again you're not the spirit of God then God lives in you then you can trust and believe that what is Wing uh uh manifested out of you what it what is being manifested out of you is in accordance to the word of God Amen the spirit of God the truth of God used to be that back in the 80s I believe 90s they had that little bracelet wwjd what would Jesus do right you don't ever see him anymore but it's very true Unfortunately today you hear a lot of the other uh what would this person do or what would that person do or what would this burn I don't really care what that person would do I care about what he cares about what would he do yeah how would he do it yeah yes amen honestly I don't even want to do it the way brother random did necessarily I want to do it the way he did how does he want it done that's what I want now now understand I believe that what brother random did was in accordance to what he wanted to do but my relationship isn't with me brother Bradham and him my relationship with me and him praise the Lord that's where my authority comes from praise God not because brother Branham said but because Jesus said amen thank God that we know we have a prophet that said what he said yes praise the Lord so as I just did we can quote things understanding that that wasn't brother branham's Authority that was God's Authority yeah that was from Christ the word that's why it all matches up perfect amen kids to understand the devil doesn't control you you control we act so many times like the he controls us amen he doesn't control us we control him look at this real quick I'll read another one out of authority the token Shreveport look now in him is all fools in him is all the fullness of God all the fullness of the promise when we're baptized into him by New Birth we have every promise that God lay at our fingertips every promise we just read Simone no sin in there no death in there and even sickness can't stay in his presence yes praise the Lord aren't you glad of that not even sickness can stay in his presence praise the Lord if Satan then puts his hands to you and tries to tempt you into something you hold your token in your hands and show it that you are a redeemed product of Jesus Christ I am that purchased possession I belong to him amen amen that token must be on display it's not good if it's just out there you have to have possession of it let your unadulterated Faith wave that token there and say I am the product that Jesus Christ bought and sickness please I am that problem I belong to him and Satan has no authority over me that God does not allow amen none zero Romans chapter 8. I got a couple more scriptures I want to read Romans chapter eight verse 1. there is therefore now you know how I love that word right yeah there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no condemnation if you're in Christ no condemnation as you walk after the spirit and not after the pledge no condemnation in you at all now Satan is going to try to come and condemn you but there's no condemnation I don't care what Satan tries to do and now is a Perpetual now existence it always is and now is not a tomorrow it's not a yesterday it is a noun right now no condemnation you're in Christ no condemnation Satan tries to come and bring you condemnation you know what to tell him display have your token on display let it know you are the purchased product of Jesus Christ you hear Brother Branham say I've said to myself take your hands off of God's Property why because he has no right being on God's Property amen when you have that authority to command him to go because you tell him where to go you tell him what to do for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do it is we that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh because he was sinless if he lived a perfect sinless life in the human flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit what is the righteousness of the law Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ is the righteousness of the law and if Jesus Christ lives in you you are now righteous as he is righteous clothed in his righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish you got to believe that Saints yes Humanity has a tendency to look on the negative all the time I do it look on the mistakes look on the things you did wrong look on the little slip-ups and that's what the devil's gonna try to make you focus on but that's not who you are amen you are Christ veiled in flesh praise the Lord the righteousness of the law for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are at the Spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit the spirit of God capital is not your own human spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness again getting to our trial being the soul of man is what lives body and spirit they can be subject to the things of the world amen subject to not ownership but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from uh from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken or make alive your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you made you a lot by his spirit that lives in you now that now you have become more than a conqueror you are the one that possessed the gates of the enemy you are the ones that has the Keys of the Kingdom you are the one that owns all the promises that God has given us to be able to have ownership of responsibility to that you live a a Victorious Life in Christ Jesus an overcoming life you live an overcoming life because Christ in you praise the Lord let me read this one more to you the this is the token message in Jeffersonville amen here's what you want to believe for see you want your own safety you believe for your safety and then apply the token for the whole family apply the token for the whole family see you say how can I do that brother Brown says claim it claim it it's yours say it verbalize it audibly let the devil hear it let God hear it let your own ears hear it everybody claim it it's yours belongs to you your inheritance not the devils claim it if it worked for you then the word then you and the word becomes one see then it works for both of you you and the word are one then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones just like Rahab did we talked about lahat Rahab last Sunday it was last week week before I lose track talked about ahem uh Rahab what did Rahab do she used a token and put the token on display now if she had taken the token that they had asked her to display and kept it in her living room she would have been destroyed don't matter what the promise said don't matter how and what they had who she had in her home if the token wasn't displayed there was no promise the promise was null and void at that point the token had to be on display before the promise would be enforced and once the token was let out the window it was on display for all of them to see then everything her and everyone in her house was saved everybody praise the Lord not just her everybody and they told her bring your family bring your dad bring your mom bring your siblings bring them all whoever you want bring them in this house amen just like the Paschal Lamb they put the door on the lintel the post everybody that was inside there was saved whoever it was they believed they were saved Rahab her family was saved why because she applied the token she didn't just talk about it she didn't just give him a nice story she applied the token she put it on display friend we don't come to meetings like this just to have fellowship and just to talk about God and we want to apply that word to our lives apply that token to our lives to our families amen if Satan then tries to put his hands to you oh wait excuse me applies to your father like like Rahab she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brother's sister and got all of them in say Lord you apply it say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter I claimed them in Jesus name Satan you turn loose praise God you on them you have possession amen why because Satan doesn't have a literal hole with the door on it and a lock that you possess you possess the entryway the gate is an entryway understand again it's an entryway and every one of us have a game an entryway into our lives entryway into our hearts entryway into our minds we all have these and those gates are the gates that heapses that we possess now they're ours they belong to us and it'll belong to the devil the entryway to your mind Satan doesn't own it you do in your way to your heart Satan doesn't own it praise God these are all Gates these are all intrude these are all ways of access and you refuse access then what can he do he's powerless if he has no access that's why when God sealed when God sealed the holy spirit in your soul he sealed the devil the devil out the devil has nuts you're born again the devil has no access to your soul zero he cannot get in there praise the lord we talked about that last week get them all in see I'm going after my son daughter claiming Satan turn them loose I'm coming after him I apply the token oh holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter there I'm going uh to her now you're anointing upon me he will do it praise the Lord let's go to Ephesians I'm going to close here in just a minute Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians 2 1 you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses in sin where an entire past you walked according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience Satan the devil among them also we all had our conversation in time passed in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others remember what that nature was that nature was your soul the soul is the nature of the spirit amen it's that nature that caused you to sin to live that way now your nature is God Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit your nature now is of God then everything that comes from that is of god amen once you were dead in sins but now you are dead to sin sin has no hold over you anymore praise God and boy we could go to First John 3 but we're going to keep going here but God who is rich in Mercy that'll probably be God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins dead in sins hath quickened us again there's that word made us alive together quickened is to make alive with Christ praise the Lord by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show his exceeding Riches of the grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship praise the lord we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them praise the Lord one more I'm going to close first John chapter 4. first John chapter 4 I need you to be wow verse 3 and 9. beautiful we'll go again maybe Sunday after next I think is for that scripture first John 4 4. ye are of God little children that's the first most pertinent are

yes if you are born again the Holy Spirit listens then greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world it's hard to understand sometimes when you don't grasp the triunity of the human being of the body spirit and soul and understand that we make up three distinct different personalities if you will all right but we are one first amen the soul the spirit and the body body is the only thing you can see it's the only thing we kind of hold to but that because that's the only thing we can see but the thing that God's most concerned about is The Soul Man Who Am I praise the Lord where is that soul holds Authority before God and holds Authority before the death you want his key you you had the key you have ownership and rights and possess the enemy's gate don't let him come and tear you up like that yes don't let the devil come and try to take your family don't let the devil come and try to rile you up don't let the devil put sickness on you don't let the devil put depression and defeat in your mind don't let the devil come and try to take over your life like that greater is he that's in you amen amen and if you don't have him get him yes if you're not born again there's a way that every one of us anybody that would come and give their lives to him you know receive this that greater is he that is in you that he is in the world amen let's stand if we could if you don't have it now it doesn't work but if you do have it friend let me tell you it works because it's not you doing it it's God's promise it's the promise of God's word you said well if God does it let God do it no he's using you to do it do it amen God's done it do it easily does it all the time but he's using you he's helping us understand that he is such a defeated enemy that he can use the likes of me to to defeat the Devil and friend if he can use the likes of me he can use the likes of anybody praise the Lord you just got to believe display that token let Satan know who you are let Satan know who you belong to amen he has no choice he has to back off praise the Lord amen let's sing this course amen before we close here today if anyone has a need of prayer we'd be happy to pray with you today

from our heart we can sing it with faith knowing that we hold possess the Gate of the enemies we hold and possess the Keys of the Kingdom amen you control your own game you control your own entryway
