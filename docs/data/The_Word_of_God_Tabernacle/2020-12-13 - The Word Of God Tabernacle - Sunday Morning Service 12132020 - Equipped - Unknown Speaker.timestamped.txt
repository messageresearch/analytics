[28:19] going to kill her
[28:22] i was going to bring that up as well
[28:24] thank you john yes so
[28:26] um yeah i'm like i came down with what
[28:29] seemed like a cold or something she
[28:30] didn't get a fever anything but just
[28:31] runny nose and things really
[28:33] uh congested but uh she's all cleared up
[28:36] now
[28:36] uh and just thank the lord that he held
[28:38] her and touched her and
[28:40] all the symptoms are gone she's
[28:41] completely 100
[28:44] another testimony i want to give is uh
[28:46] last monday
[28:47] uh me and tafta went in for her
[28:49] appointment uh we had mentioned that she
[28:51] had
[28:51] um been getting having some pain in her
[28:55] throat or left side of her throat um
[28:57] just underneath the jawline here
[29:00] and other things going on with her that
[29:02] we thought may have been
[29:03] being caused by whatever is up here
[29:06] going off her throat but
[29:08] the doctor looked at all of her lymph
[29:10] nodes and thank the lord they didn't
[29:12] find anything wrong with uh with her at
[29:14] all
[29:15] amen so thank you some of her lymph
[29:17] nodes are bigger than other ones and
[29:19] her gland or like a saliva gland or
[29:22] something like that is bigger than the
[29:23] saliva gland on this side so
[29:25] um you know that may be what's kind of
[29:27] bothering her but it's nothing to be
[29:29] concerned about
[29:29] just some some parts of your body are
[29:31] bigger than other parts so
[29:33] um just thank the lord that uh you know
[29:35] nothing was found and i believe that the
[29:37] lord
[29:37] has held her and is uh still you know
[29:40] working on her
[29:41] and just removing all the pain from her
[29:43] man uh thank you for your prayers on

[35:57] that's right there's no secret
[35:59] people may deny it people may make

[36:21] people from time to time look into a
[36:22] loved one's eyes and say i don't know
[36:24] what i would do without you
[36:26] but you know friend if i could just look
[36:28] him straight in the eye i believe i do
[36:29] when i look at you
[36:31] but uh i don't know what i'd do without
[36:33] him yeah i don't know what i would do
[36:35] without him i'm thankful
[36:36] i mean my little testimony i appreciate
[36:38] the lord uh
[36:39] blessing me with another year tuesday
[36:41] i'll be double nickels
[36:43] or i say a double portion of grace
[36:46] amen amen i remember back in uh i
[36:49] probably made
[36:52] some people quench a little bit but when
[36:54] i i came we came i was pastoring in
[36:57] florida came to the tucson tabernacle
[36:59] for the convention
[37:01] and um brother ron peterson got up to
[37:05] speak
[37:05] it was the service it was the time that
[37:07] brother greene was just going and
[37:08] telling all the ministers be prepared
[37:10] because i'm just going to walk down the
[37:12] aisle each night and point at you
[37:14] and you better be ready and while
[37:16] brother
[37:17] in the first night was ron peterson and
[37:19] he got up and spoke and the lord spoke
[37:21] to me while he was speaking and said
[37:22] he's going to call on you tomorrow night
[37:25] and i'm thinking i brother green didn't
[37:27] know me i didn't know brother green i
[37:28] just
[37:29] met him for a few minutes basically
[37:32] and i got home and or got to the hotel
[37:35] and when i got to the hotel the lord
[37:37] gave me the subject and the scripture to
[37:39] read and to give for that night
[37:41] for the next the next night and
[37:44] so sure enough brother green came down
[37:47] and
[37:47] pointed at me he started talking about a
[37:49] young man from saint augustine florida
[37:51] pastoring and all and he called me up
[37:54] and
[37:55] i saw i knew you was going to do that
[37:56] and knew exactly the scripture
[37:57] everything the lord wanted me to read
[37:59] but the point getting to is that
[38:03] when i did that i was 33 so
[38:06] i made the proclamation at the time that
[38:08] i was double perfect
[38:10] 33 2 3 twice so i guess now i just feel
[38:14] like i've got a double portion of grace
[38:16] amen amen be 55 tuesday so i'm thankful
[38:20] that god has blessed me with another
[38:22] year and and friend i i
[38:24] if there's another human on the planet
[38:26] more blessed than i am i don't know them
[38:29] i've never met them you probably feel
[38:31] the same way
[38:32] but you can feel that way because that's
[38:33] you but i feel this way because it's me
[38:36] amen and how blessed i really am and i'm
[38:39] so very thankful that
[38:41] god has been so good to us amen amen
[38:43] god's been so good he's been good to me
[38:45] and i'm so very thankful he's always
[38:47] with us amen amen praise the lord god

[39:14] i want to read my first scripture the
[39:15] lord uh i actually thought
[39:17] you know last week for two months or so
[39:20] the lord had us
[39:21] coming out of the old testament and then
[39:24] last week it was the new testament and
[39:26] uh and i thought it was going to be the
[39:28] new testament again today but when i was
[39:30] in prayer this morning the lord gave me
[39:31] this scripture to start this off
[39:33] didn't change the subject didn't change
[39:35] the title or
[39:37] the way it was going but altered the
[39:39] direction if you will so amen so we're
[39:42] going to start in first samuel today but

[41:38] amen amen amen amen first samuel chapter
[41:41] 17
[41:43] amen i'm not sure if i gave you the
[41:44] chapter my apologies
[41:48] i must not have because i hear a lot of
[41:49] pages turning first samuel 7
[41:52] chapter 17
[41:55] amen and we'll begin with verse 37
[42:00] first samuel 17 37.
[42:03] david said moreover the lord that
[42:05] delivered me out of the paul of the line
[42:07] and out of the paw of the bear
[42:09] he will deliver me out of the hand of
[42:11] the philistine
[42:12] and saul said unto david go and the lord
[42:15] be with thee
[42:16] saul armed david with his armor and he
[42:18] put on him a helmet of brass
[42:20] uh put a helmet of brass upon his head
[42:22] he also he armed him with a coat of mail
[42:26] david girded his sword upon his armor
[42:29] and he is say to go he hesitated
[42:32] for he had not proved it and david said
[42:35] unto saul i cannot go with these
[42:37] i have not proved them and david put
[42:39] them off
[42:41] and he took his staff in his hand and he
[42:42] chose him five
[42:44] smooth stones out of the brook put them
[42:46] in the shepherd's bag which he had even
[42:48] in a script
[42:49] and his sling was in his hand and he
[42:51] drew near to the philistine you could be
[42:53] seated
[42:54] now if you'd like the lord add his
[42:56] blessings to the word
[42:58] right amen amen
[43:01] now i want to speak on a simple subject
[43:04] today
[43:05] for some reason because now i want to go
[43:08] we can let's just go ahead and move over
[43:10] if we could to ephesians chapter
[43:12] 4. the lord keeps bringing me back to
[43:15] ephesians 4.
[43:18] um i keep thinking that
[43:21] what the lord's wanted to be said is
[43:23] said
[43:24] or maybe it's just not being said within
[43:26] the time limits that we have
[43:29] but for some reason in different ways
[43:31] for different reasons the lord keeps
[43:32] bringing me back to ephesians 4
[43:34] which is where i was going to start the
[43:36] the subject the service today
[43:38] was ephesians 4. so i want to go back
[43:40] and read ephesians 4
[43:42] uh begin with verse 10 just as we did
[43:44] the other day
[43:47] ephesians 4 uh verse 10
[43:50] and um and we'll we'll revert back to
[43:53] david and
[43:54] saul here in just a moment but ephesians
[43:56] 4
[43:57] um verse 10 is where i want to draw my
[44:00] text now he's
[44:01] uh verse 10. he that descended is the
[44:04] is the same also that ascended far up
[44:07] above all heavens that he might fill all
[44:09] things
[44:10] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[44:13] some evangelists and some pastors and
[44:15] teachers
[44:16] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[44:18] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[44:20] the body of christ who we all come in
[44:22] the unity of faith
[44:23] of the faith and the knowledge of the
[44:25] son of god into a perfect manner to the
[44:27] measure of the stature of the perfect
[44:28] the fullness of christ that we
[44:30] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[44:32] and fro and carried about with every
[44:34] wind of doctrine by the slight of men
[44:36] cunning crafting is whereby they lie in
[44:38] way to deceive so my subject today
[44:41] is going to be one simple word that is
[44:43] equipped
[44:44] equipped and when um well oddly enough
[44:48] was in prayer yesterday
[44:50] and talking to the lord about what he
[44:53] would have you to bring for today
[44:55] which i often do on saturdays even if i
[44:57] already have a thought or something i
[44:59] feel like that i want to bring
[45:00] or a subject or scriptures or something
[45:04] i usually on saturdays i talk to the
[45:06] lord as i
[45:07] do and i asked him you know about sunday
[45:10] and today and
[45:11] and the lord brought me back to this
[45:13] again and the subject that he put on my
[45:15] heart was the word equip
[45:17] and when i thought about equip uh it
[45:20] brought me back to this scripture
[45:22] because if you if you go and read as as
[45:25] as we've said several times the 12th
[45:28] verse the five-fold ministry is given
[45:32] for specific purpose
[45:34] that purpose is for the first thing it
[45:36] says is for the perfecting of the saints
[45:39] now we know also that that means of
[45:41] course the
[45:42] uh the maturity or the growing up or the
[45:46] reaching to the level of completeness or
[45:48] fully furnished but it also means
[45:50] equipped or to give equipment to or to
[45:53] equip
[45:54] someone or somebody so this
[45:57] word perfect also means to equip so
[46:00] when my mind was going back to this to
[46:03] this word equipped
[46:04] and being equipped because friends as
[46:07] you all know
[46:08] we're at the end time uh we're at the
[46:10] end of this
[46:11] world scene and we're at the end of the
[46:13] time of the bride's
[46:14] venture upon this earth as sojourners in
[46:17] this land
[46:18] we know that we're at that point now to
[46:20] what day and time month year we don't
[46:22] know
[46:22] but i believe we're at that time and i
[46:25] don't think
[46:26] anyone would disparage that i believe we
[46:28] all believe that we're at the end we're
[46:30] at this time where the lord is
[46:31] soon going to be calling his bride home
[46:34] uh well if the lord is going to be
[46:35] calling his bride home
[46:36] something's going to happen to the bride
[46:38] to bring her to the place
[46:40] in a in a in a way of faith that's going
[46:42] to cause
[46:43] her bodies to be changed as we talked
[46:45] about the other day to go in a rapture
[46:47] to meet the lord in the air
[46:49] uh and and as it has been many times on
[46:53] my heart and mind and
[46:54] i i think back at conversation i have
[46:56] with people and
[46:57] sometimes people say we go to church and
[46:59] we hear the word and we go home and
[47:01] you know it seems like very routine
[47:03] right uh
[47:04] and and sometimes it can feel like a
[47:06] routine sometimes it can feel like we
[47:08] get in a rut
[47:09] but you know if you're going to church
[47:11] and you're obeying the word of god
[47:13] and the word of god is being preached
[47:15] not the word of a man like we said the
[47:16] other day
[47:17] because the word comes the word has to
[47:20] be the word of god it can't be
[47:22] hybrid it can't be mixed with man's
[47:23] ideas opinions
[47:25] it can't be brought from some seminary
[47:27] or some man's doctrine or some man's
[47:29] thought that he thought up whenever he
[47:31] did it has to be the pure unadulterated
[47:34] word of god
[47:34] which we know comes from the pages of
[47:36] this bible which we
[47:38] also know from the pages of this bible
[47:40] come the message of the hour
[47:41] or what we know to be the present day
[47:43] truth amen
[47:44] that present day truth was to come to
[47:47] equip a people
[47:48] amen that word which is the word that
[47:50] word to be able to give
[47:52] people what they need to be able to be
[47:54] ready
[47:55] when god calls them to go home brother
[47:58] banham said that rapturing faith
[48:00] lies in the messages amen i've said this
[48:02] before so
[48:03] i'm just going to say it again if you
[48:05] disagree with me you can disagree
[48:06] if you dislike me for saying it you can
[48:08] you're well pleased to do so
[48:10] but i don't understand why everybody
[48:12] wants to go seeking with every other
[48:14] minister
[48:15] and every other uh evangelist or every
[48:17] other prophet
[48:18] so-called hiring prophet out there i
[48:20] don't understand
[48:21] why everybody wants to garner all their
[48:23] food from all these
[48:24] uh tbn ministers when brother madam said
[48:27] that the
[48:28] if you believe this word and you believe
[48:30] this message if rapturing faith lies in
[48:32] that message
[48:33] why are we going other places amen
[48:35] that's right there's not
[48:36] rapturing faith out there rapturing face
[48:39] right here am i well if it's here why
[48:41] are we going out there
[48:42] that's right you said well i get a
[48:44] cookie or a crumb of bread or something
[48:45] why do you want to get a crumb of bed
[48:47] when we got a whole loaf
[48:48] right right yeah you got a whole factory
[48:52] right that you fake as much bread as you
[48:55] want
[48:56] why it's like brother branham said it's
[48:57] like the little mouse in the gardeners
[48:59] of egypt
[49:00] thinking you know i got to eat this
[49:02] sparingly because i'm going to run out
[49:04] right right and that mouse has probably
[49:05] got enough
[49:06] got enough grain in that garner uh
[49:08] that's a granary to take care of him and
[49:11] 50 generations of rats right
[49:15] but we treat it like you know what we
[49:17] just want to get no
[49:18] it that that's god we're at a place in
[49:21] time
[49:22] we're beyond crumbs we're at a place and
[49:26] time of this life where we're beyond
[49:28] all all the things that's that that you
[49:31] know well brother branham said i know he
[49:33] said it
[49:34] and i'm not saying we're past brother
[49:35] branham trust me because of this message
[49:38] but we're the bride is to a place now
[49:41] the rapture's
[49:42] at hand amen and there's got to be
[49:45] something that brings this bride to the
[49:47] place of being equipped
[49:48] to go in the rapture right and that
[49:51] equipment
[49:52] comes from the word right now if the
[49:55] bible
[49:55] says that the fivefold ministry is sent
[49:59] to equip a group of people then we must
[50:03] know that that
[50:04] fivefold ministry is to serve that
[50:07] purpose
[50:08] by preaching the word of god right
[50:11] to equip her to give her the equipment
[50:14] to be able to
[50:15] use to go forward with amen
[50:18] some people believe that that that
[50:21] brother branham was the only one
[50:22] sent to equip abroad no i disagree with
[50:26] that wholeheartedly friend
[50:28] and you won't find that in the message
[50:30] and you won't find it in this bible amen
[50:33] but some people believe that that
[50:34] brother branham was the only one that
[50:36] was sent to equip a bride
[50:38] i beg your pardon friend the bible says
[50:41] that a five-fold ministry was sent to
[50:43] equip a bride
[50:45] there was a five-fold ministry sent to
[50:47] bring perfection
[50:48] to that bride maturity through the word
[50:51] and that equipping that
[50:53] that gives her the tools she needs so
[50:56] even if it sometimes
[50:57] seems routine and it shouldn't be that
[50:59] way
[51:00] yes sir but if it seems that way
[51:03] understand
[51:03] you're obeying the word right the word
[51:05] is being preached
[51:06] that word will not return void if it's
[51:09] not going to return void then what's it
[51:10] doing
[51:12] it's doing something in your life it's
[51:14] doing
[51:15] something in your spirit and your soul
[51:17] is doing something to you
[51:18] if you won't return void it's
[51:20] accomplishing what god sent it forth for
[51:23] whether you feel it smell it hear it
[51:26] taste it
[51:26] it doesn't matter amen it's doing
[51:28] something to us
[51:30] right and what is it doing it's
[51:31] equipping us
[51:33] it's giving us the equipment that we
[51:35] need
[51:36] now if you go back to saul and david
[51:39] you see that david stepped forward
[51:41] because he was tired of hearing this
[51:43] uncircumcised philistine
[51:45] curse the armies of the living god and
[51:48] he said how dare he
[51:50] through those uncircumcised lips curse
[51:53] my god
[51:54] i'll take care of him i'll take him down
[51:58] you let me at him he doesn't stand a
[52:00] chance
[52:01] and it don't matter how big david was
[52:03] didn't matter how little dave
[52:05] or how big goliath was or how little
[52:06] david was
[52:08] and as david come forth he had to
[52:10] convince saul
[52:12] saul had brought himself to a place so
[52:15] far that god had
[52:16] uh uh that that god had distanced
[52:19] himself from saul and actually repented
[52:21] for every making saw in charge
[52:23] but he david had to convince him
[52:27] that he was going to be able to take
[52:29] care of goliath
[52:31] well once he convinced him because god
[52:33] had been with david
[52:35] took care of the bear took care of the
[52:37] lion that was the
[52:38] rehearsals that david needed to be able
[52:41] to have the faith to believe that he
[52:42] could go take care of this goliath
[52:44] he said well this man is going to be
[52:46] nothing more than that line and that
[52:47] bear
[52:48] well those were david's rehearsal those
[52:50] were what david need to give him the
[52:52] strength and the courage
[52:53] to step forward to this uh to this
[52:56] listing that's just his rehearsal
[52:58] well friend what do you think he was
[53:00] being equipped
[53:02] god was equipping david with what he
[53:04] needed
[53:05] just being a shepherd boy just living
[53:08] his life
[53:09] just being who he was sometimes things
[53:12] sometimes people think oh we now
[53:14] we need to go up into some hell in
[53:16] heavenly realm and and we need to grasp
[53:18] all this and bring all this down and all
[53:20] this celestial stuff and make everything
[53:23] spiritualized
[53:24] friend it's just a matter of living your
[53:26] life for god and just being a christian
[53:29] just be a simple humble christian
[53:32] and in his simple humble life david as
[53:35] the
[53:36] as the shepherd god was equipping him
[53:40] but david wasn't doing anything
[53:41] supernatural right he wasn't doing
[53:43] anything out of the ordinary
[53:45] he wasn't praying to go into the third
[53:47] heavens or
[53:49] he was just being a shepherd he was just
[53:52] taking care of his flock
[53:53] that's all he was doing but god in all
[53:56] that
[53:56] david was doing god was equipping him
[53:58] right god was preparing david for what
[54:01] he was going to face
[54:03] so god sent him a lion and and and
[54:06] and then david rose up with the strength
[54:08] and took the line by the bear
[54:09] by the beard and slew it then god sent
[54:12] david a bear
[54:13] david did the same thing took that bear
[54:15] and killed him
[54:16] right right got the sheep and brought
[54:18] him back into the fold
[54:19] took care of his flock that's just what
[54:22] he was supposed to do
[54:23] that was his livelihood that's what he
[54:25] did right that was his life
[54:26] right people think well i've got to do
[54:29] this i got to go here and i got to do
[54:31] this and i got to get this they got to
[54:32] have that
[54:33] just be who you are just be led of god
[54:37] give how make sure that that
[54:39] relationship you have with jesus christ
[54:42] is is pure and right and it's a daily
[54:45] communion with him
[54:47] and let god lead you whatever god wants
[54:50] you to do he'll show you
[54:51] he'll tell you you have to do something
[54:53] extraordinary
[54:55] right just trust god he'll equip you for
[54:57] what you need
[54:58] amen so when david come to the to the
[55:01] to the real test when david come while i
[55:04] say real test david had a lot of tests
[55:06] i think actually goliath was nothing
[55:08] today but i think david's real test was
[55:10] when his own son came out to kill him
[55:12] right
[55:12] right that that to me uh that to me
[55:16] was uh was david's greatest test i think
[55:19] people say well you know the man spit on
[55:21] david and they want to take his head off
[55:23] he said nope
[55:24] god told him to do that i think that was
[55:25] a great test i was a test
[55:27] greatest test is when the man's son
[55:29] tried to kill him to me
[55:31] my opinion but when he come before
[55:33] goliath and he come before this great
[55:35] test
[55:36] now god's equipped him saul finally
[55:39] believes him
[55:40] or at least lets him go and then saul
[55:43] tries to equip
[55:44] david not knowing david was already
[55:47] equipped right
[55:48] he didn't need saw's equipment he needed
[55:51] god's equipment
[55:53] right he didn't need man's equipment he
[55:56] needed god's equipment amen
[55:57] and god had equipped david so when saul
[56:00] tried to put all this equipment on him
[56:03] even he waited he he couldn't go
[56:06] and he said i i can't go like this this
[56:10] is not
[56:10] my life this is not what guns done for
[56:13] me this is not how god's led me this is
[56:15] not what god has produced in my life
[56:17] and he got rid of all that and he took
[56:20] his shepherd's staff
[56:22] and he grabbed five stones right that's
[56:25] all he needed
[56:26] why because he was already equipped
[56:28] exactly god had already equipped him
[56:31] what did he equip him with the faith
[56:33] amen
[56:34] he equipped him with the faith to be
[56:36] able to face the giant
[56:38] right that's the equipment david needed
[56:40] right for his faith to get to the point
[56:43] that's why he said
[56:44] that bear that a circumcised list is
[56:47] going to be the same as that bear in
[56:48] that lion
[56:49] well how'd he speak he spoke that by
[56:50] faith right amen he didn't know that
[56:53] because it hadn't happened but he knew
[56:55] it by faith
[56:56] and by faith that it already happened so
[56:58] he quit in my faith so he just took his
[57:00] staff and the five stones and he went
[57:01] forth to meet the giant
[57:03] he just put one stone in slung around
[57:05] bam dunk gone over okay he's cut his
[57:07] head off it's
[57:08] finished and just keep marching on
[57:13] people are celebrating and shouting and
[57:14] screaming oh that's wonderful great
[57:16] revival time
[57:17] but it was just life to david that's all
[57:20] it was
[57:21] amen and david was equipped because god
[57:24] equipped him
[57:25] man will try to equip you but god man
[57:28] can't equip you for what god wants to do
[57:30] for you
[57:31] god has to equip you for that yes and
[57:33] god
[57:34] sent a fivefold ministry to bring that
[57:36] equipment
[57:37] amen amen it's a five-fold ministry
[57:41] that perfects the saints equips the
[57:45] saints
[57:46] for the work of the ministry and again
[57:48] to build up
[57:49] to edify the body of christ not tear
[57:52] down
[57:52] not ridicule not put down right not beat
[57:56] up
[57:56] right but to edify and to lift up that
[57:59] body of christ amen
[58:00] to bring that body of christ to a place
[58:03] that in themselves
[58:04] they know they have the faith to meet
[58:07] the challenge yes
[58:08] if a minister is not raising a
[58:10] congregation by edification or building
[58:12] up
[58:13] to equip them with the understanding of
[58:15] faith that they themselves when they
[58:17] need that
[58:18] giant can slay them amen they don't have
[58:21] to call the pastor right although you're
[58:22] welcome to
[58:23] your next call absolutely or any brother
[58:25] or sister
[58:26] or put on facebook or put on a text or
[58:28] an email or
[58:29] whatever you want to do that's fine and
[58:31] dandy but you know that you've been
[58:33] equipped
[58:34] am i and that you have been edified and
[58:36] built up in
[58:37] faith to the place that when you meet
[58:39] that giant it has no
[58:41] chance amen right when you meet that
[58:44] devil it has
[58:45] no chance right they know they have no
[58:49] chance
[58:50] but they come anyway and you know you're
[58:52] the winner
[58:53] but they still keep coming but you are
[58:56] equipped you
[58:57] are built up to the place that you know
[59:00] that you can take care of it when the
[59:02] time needs yes you can take care of the
[59:04] enemy when the time comes when he comes
[59:06] in like a flood god raises up that
[59:08] another standard
[59:08] and all you do is take that smooth stone
[59:10] and whack him right between the eyes
[59:12] down he goes again
[59:13] amen down he goes again amen
[59:16] it's your faith not david's at your feet
[59:20] praise the lord because you're equipped
[59:22] now the word
[59:24] the word gives us the equipment because
[59:26] that's what the fivefold ministry is
[59:28] supposed to do is to bring the word of
[59:29] god
[59:29] right faith comes by hearing and hearing
[59:31] the word of god
[59:32] amen how can anybody know what the word
[59:35] says unless they have a preacher
[59:37] right is that what romans says right
[59:39] it's a preacher that brings the word
[59:41] it's it's the preachers the minister
[59:43] that brings the faith that equips
[59:45] the congregation that equips and and you
[59:48] may not realize but the the
[59:50] ministry is being equipped at the same
[59:51] time right
[59:53] we're being equipped at the same time
[59:54] because we're just like you
[59:56] yeah you know we're just human just like
[59:58] the rest of us
[59:59] we're all human we're being equipped at
[1:00:01] the same time because this is god not us
[1:00:04] right this is the gift of god not the
[1:00:06] gift of man
[1:00:07] this is not something that man's
[1:00:08] equipped it it's not something to go
[1:00:10] into a seminary in god this is god's
[1:00:11] equipment amen
[1:00:12] and god equips us for what he wants done
[1:00:15] right
[1:00:16] man gets you put for all they want to
[1:00:17] get done but god equips us for what he
[1:00:20] wants done
[1:00:21] amen praise the lord and that equipment
[1:00:24] god brings
[1:00:25] brings us into his place his position
[1:00:28] now what is it 13th verse now
[1:00:30] till we all come into what
[1:00:33] a unity of the faith amen
[1:00:36] well the fivefold ministry is an
[1:00:38] international ministry right
[1:00:41] the brother of adam as he says he didn't
[1:00:44] literally go seven times around the
[1:00:45] world but
[1:00:46] went this message seven times around the
[1:00:48] world messages all over the world now
[1:00:51] i mean in all kinds of places and books
[1:00:54] and tapes and tablets and whatever else
[1:00:56] they can
[1:00:57] stream it they can hear it from all
[1:00:59] kinds of places in the united states and
[1:01:01] around the world
[1:01:02] they can hear it they can pull this up
[1:01:04] they got youtube over in ghanda they can
[1:01:06] pick it up
[1:01:07] and and watch it right all over the
[1:01:10] world
[1:01:10] yes this ministry is an international
[1:01:13] ministry
[1:01:13] because this bride is an international
[1:01:15] bride right so this
[1:01:17] faith for this bride has got to be an
[1:01:20] international faith it's got to be a
[1:01:23] unity
[1:01:24] of faith not just us here not just
[1:01:26] tucson or arizona in the united states
[1:01:28] it's faith
[1:01:29] and the unity of it has to be
[1:01:31] international right
[1:01:32] that's why the same word has to be god's
[1:01:35] word
[1:01:35] now see if man's word is mixed in there
[1:01:38] then it's going to be different church
[1:01:39] to church
[1:01:40] place to place is going to be different
[1:01:42] god's word is going to be changed it's
[1:01:44] going to be altered hybrid
[1:01:45] it's going to be different but if it's
[1:01:47] god's word god's word is
[1:01:49] the same it does not change if it's
[1:01:51] god's word and these
[1:01:52] men are preaching god's word then the
[1:01:55] same results are going to come
[1:01:56] whether you're in china or africa or
[1:01:58] asia or india or russia or the united
[1:02:00] states
[1:02:01] it's all going to be the same so we're
[1:02:03] all going to come
[1:02:05] this bride is all going to come to a
[1:02:08] unity
[1:02:09] of the faith amen a faith that's going
[1:02:12] to do what to her
[1:02:13] it's going to cause her to go in a
[1:02:15] rapture it's going to cause a body
[1:02:17] change
[1:02:17] and we're going to leave this place
[1:02:20] because the unity of it
[1:02:21] of the bride internationally now i guess
[1:02:25] maybe that's why the lord keeps bringing
[1:02:26] me to that place
[1:02:28] but look for a moment because the word
[1:02:31] now the word
[1:02:32] does equipping and we know the word just
[1:02:35] a couple of things the word does
[1:02:38] the word is a sharp two-edged sword
[1:02:41] that gives you something to fight with
[1:02:43] right it's also
[1:02:44] faith the word gives faith so if the
[1:02:47] faith if the word spoken in faith
[1:02:49] brings faith by revelation because faith
[1:02:52] is a revelation
[1:02:53] to take that two-handed sword remember
[1:02:55] when brother branham had that vision
[1:02:57] right here in sabino canyon
[1:02:59] and that sword struck his hand what did
[1:03:01] that voice tell him
[1:03:03] it was the sword of the king it was the
[1:03:06] sword
[1:03:07] of the king which was the word which is
[1:03:09] the word brother brown said that
[1:03:11] and we know that's what the word says
[1:03:12] yes the sword is the key
[1:03:14] is the word so if the sword is the word
[1:03:17] but then he said
[1:03:19] that it takes a strong hand of faith you
[1:03:22] remember that
[1:03:22] yes amen go back and i believe he said
[1:03:24] in the breach you go back and listen
[1:03:26] brother says but it takes the sword is
[1:03:29] there friend
[1:03:30] right but it takes the strong hand of
[1:03:32] faith
[1:03:33] to take it to the heart of the enemy
[1:03:35] amen right amen
[1:03:36] takes a strong hand of faith to take it
[1:03:39] to the heart of the enemy
[1:03:40] well how do they have that by the
[1:03:42] edification
[1:03:44] by the building up by the equipping
[1:03:47] or perfecting of the saints that's what
[1:03:51] happens
[1:03:52] is this this is not in vain this morning
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:56] this is not routine this morning this is
[1:03:59] not
[1:04:00] uh uh uh something that we just push off
[1:04:03] and say well it's just a
[1:04:04] it's a part of my life no no no no it
[1:04:07] can't be a part of our lives right
[1:04:10] if this you hear me today if this is a
[1:04:13] part of our lives then our lives are for
[1:04:15] nothing
[1:04:18] because this can't be a part of our
[1:04:19] lives
[1:04:21] this must be our life amen
[1:04:24] god is not a part of my life he is my
[1:04:27] life
[1:04:28] god cannot be a part of your life oh
[1:04:31] i'll slot him in here
[1:04:33] well he's not a news program or some
[1:04:35] television
[1:04:36] station trying to decide when they're
[1:04:38] going to pro god is
[1:04:40] your life or he's nothing right right
[1:04:43] he's life or nothing so he's not a part
[1:04:46] of life you just slot him in when you
[1:04:48] have time for him right you know
[1:04:49] he is life right that's right his life
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:52] and if he's here and he's speaking then
[1:04:56] god is
[1:04:56] giving us the equipment that we need
[1:04:59] yes now look at the word equip i looked
[1:05:02] it up
[1:05:03] the word equip means to supply with the
[1:05:06] items necessary
[1:05:08] for a particular purpose to prepare
[1:05:12] someone yes to prepare now it may seem
[1:05:16] as i said before
[1:05:17] routine it may seem like it's
[1:05:20] uh on and on
[1:05:23] and it's just something that uh that
[1:05:25] well it's sunday morning we go to church
[1:05:28] it's so far beyond that for me right
[1:05:30] amen yes
[1:05:31] if the word is being projected if god is
[1:05:34] here and pleased if his spirit is moving
[1:05:37] and his word is being ministered by the
[1:05:39] word and the spirit then god is bringing
[1:05:41] to pass
[1:05:42] in us what we need so when the time
[1:05:45] comes
[1:05:46] we don't have to search for it it's
[1:05:49] already there it's already about
[1:05:50] right the faith's already there the
[1:05:52] words already there
[1:05:54] you might not can recall uh a a
[1:05:58] book page line right chapter or verse
[1:06:01] but you know it
[1:06:02] am i you know it because it's not a word
[1:06:05] on
[1:06:06] ephesians 3 1 is a word on a page
[1:06:10] that word what it says is in you as
[1:06:14] a living word no matter whether it's
[1:06:17] ephesians 3 1 or not
[1:06:19] that's a written letter that letter
[1:06:21] kills but when that letter comes real in
[1:06:23] you it's a living word then
[1:06:25] amen it's not just words on a page and
[1:06:28] when god comes and speaks that
[1:06:30] and reveals it it becomes alive in you
[1:06:33] you might not feel it you might not know
[1:06:36] the difference friend
[1:06:37] but the result is being manifested
[1:06:40] period because that's what the word says
[1:06:43] yes it has to be
[1:06:44] whether you feel it or smell it or any
[1:06:47] of your senses declare it doesn't matter
[1:06:50] it's happening it's happening now if a
[1:06:53] person comes
[1:06:54] and they're just napping her this is
[1:06:56] their favorite nap time or
[1:06:58] they're just coming you know for other
[1:07:01] reasons and they really don't care and
[1:07:03] they're not listening that's different
[1:07:04] right now they'll not re it'll still not
[1:07:06] return void
[1:07:08] but they might actually be worse than
[1:07:10] they are better oh boy but
[1:07:11] a true christian a born-again christian
[1:07:14] someone who is here
[1:07:15] because of the beckoning of the lord and
[1:07:17] his word and desire to hear the word of
[1:07:20] god priests and let that word come into
[1:07:22] their lives
[1:07:23] it will manifest in them what god said
[1:07:25] it would do yes
[1:07:26] it will perfect the saints it will
[1:07:30] edify the body of christ it will bring a
[1:07:33] unity of
[1:07:34] faith it will supply the
[1:07:37] items necessary to you
[1:07:40] yes for a purpose yes and what is that
[1:07:44] purpose our ultimate purpose anyway
[1:07:46] there's multiple purposes to this
[1:07:48] obviously yes but the the main
[1:07:52] end result purpose is for body change to
[1:07:55] go on a rapture yes
[1:07:57] to leave this world that's the main
[1:07:59] purpose
[1:08:00] of course it comes as a sword now the
[1:08:02] sword comes so you have something to
[1:08:04] defeat the enemy with while you're here
[1:08:07] amen and the strong hand of faith to
[1:08:09] take it to the heart of the enemy
[1:08:11] right praise the lord that's where the
[1:08:13] edifying comes
[1:08:14] you're perfected you're built up
[1:08:16] equipped
[1:08:17] bring the faith you see the dual purpose
[1:08:20] now the equipment of perfecting
[1:08:23] and the faith of edifying to take
[1:08:26] that word and bring it to the heart of
[1:08:28] the enemy
[1:08:30] to equip and prepare us for a rapture
[1:08:33] amen because all those
[1:08:34] those are just our homework that's
[1:08:36] that's just what god's doing for us now
[1:08:39] david had the line and the bear that was
[1:08:40] his homework
[1:08:42] amen joel has homework and when because
[1:08:45] joel goes to school
[1:08:47] when we went to school we had homework
[1:08:49] yes well the homework is just something
[1:08:51] to help us that when we get back to
[1:08:53] school
[1:08:53] we know what we're doing right right oh
[1:08:56] yeah i remember that
[1:08:59] that that's just something tangible
[1:09:00] natural that you can pull
[1:09:02] pull on but you say well yeah i and then
[1:09:05] when you see it in a test
[1:09:07] then when the real test comes you say oh
[1:09:09] yeah i remember that yeah that was that
[1:09:10] hard work and you know the answer you've
[1:09:12] got it there
[1:09:13] there it is simple you pass the test
[1:09:15] right amen
[1:09:17] some people do better at it than others
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] i'm a hard learner but the lord's always
[1:09:22] blessed it
[1:09:23] right my wife would get mad at me
[1:09:26] because she said i've studied my brains
[1:09:27] out and got a d
[1:09:29] and i fooled around in class and got a c
[1:09:32] i didn't do anything i'd read i'd read
[1:09:35] listen
[1:09:36] uh this is probably not good
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:40] especially for the young people for ajo
[1:09:41] kids if you're watching close years
[1:09:44] i'd read the front the middle and the
[1:09:46] back of a book
[1:09:48] and i'd write a full book report on it
[1:09:49] and get a b wow
[1:09:52] i don't know how but that's just the way
[1:09:54] that's just
[1:09:56] just for some reason uh i'd be kind of
[1:09:59] like micah you know he's
[1:10:00] god's just like i just got to get you
[1:10:02] out of here and get you out of school so
[1:10:04] he made a way for it to be able to done
[1:10:07] and
[1:10:08] i i just i didn't like to read so anyway
[1:10:11] but
[1:10:12] but the purpose of what what the school
[1:10:16] is is to equip you the purpose that
[1:10:18] god's got is to equip you
[1:10:21] the school equips you to try to do good
[1:10:23] out in the world
[1:10:24] and get a good job make some good money
[1:10:26] and so on and so forth
[1:10:28] god's equipping is to get us ready and
[1:10:31] to keep us
[1:10:32] in his purview so that we are
[1:10:35] uh godly christians wherever we go
[1:10:39] if we're tending sheep as david did
[1:10:43] whatever we're doing god takes care of
[1:10:46] it
[1:10:47] god equips us because we allow our lives
[1:10:50] to be
[1:10:51] filled with the things of god wherever
[1:10:54] we go what we do we allow ourselves to
[1:10:55] be filled with the things of god
[1:10:57] that equipping now to supply those
[1:11:00] things necessary for that purpose
[1:11:02] that purpose is to go home amen that's
[1:11:05] the ultimate purpose
[1:11:06] to prepare us to go home that's the
[1:11:09] ultimate purpose
[1:11:10] that god has now second timothy chapter
[1:11:14] 3
[1:11:21] 2 timothy chapter 3 verse 13.
[1:11:27] listen now god talking to timothy says
[1:11:30] but evil men
[1:11:32] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[1:11:35] deceiving and being deceived now that if
[1:11:38] that's not
[1:11:39] a a reprimand uh prophecy of today i
[1:11:44] and it may not have necessarily been
[1:11:46] that way but that's exactly the way it
[1:11:47] is today
[1:11:48] right evil men seducers shall wax worse
[1:11:51] and worse deceiving
[1:11:53] deceiving and being deceit i heard
[1:11:56] somebody the other day
[1:11:58] in politics telling some other
[1:12:00] politician
[1:12:01] well don't say it like this because
[1:12:04] people don't like it when you say it
[1:12:06] like that
[1:12:07] and they'll disagree with you and vote
[1:12:09] the other way
[1:12:10] right say it like this
[1:12:13] so that it deceives them into thinking
[1:12:17] that you're saying something you're not
[1:12:19] right
[1:12:20] right and i thought maya that's not a
[1:12:22] politician to the mayor of the bone i
[1:12:24] don't know what there is
[1:12:26] i mean don't don't just tell them what
[1:12:29] you think
[1:12:30] tell them what they want to hear right
[1:12:32] and and word it in a way that you make
[1:12:34] it do whatever you wanted to do then
[1:12:36] see because once you get in that seat
[1:12:38] then you can call
[1:12:39] shots you can do whatever you want to
[1:12:40] right right i thought
[1:12:42] my isn't that just and then when i saw
[1:12:44] this word deceived it just made me the
[1:12:46] evil men
[1:12:47] seducers wax worst words deceiving
[1:12:51] being deceived but listen now but
[1:12:54] continue thou
[1:12:55] in the things which thou has learned has
[1:12:58] learned
[1:12:59] equipping and has been assured of
[1:13:02] knowing of whom thou has
[1:13:04] learned them whom has thou learned them
[1:13:06] now hasn't learned them from me
[1:13:08] thou hasn't learned them from perry
[1:13:09] green thou has learned them even from
[1:13:11] william branham
[1:13:12] you have learned them and been equipped
[1:13:14] by them from god
[1:13:18] just like all the rest of us have just
[1:13:20] like i'm equipped by god just like
[1:13:22] brother branham was just like brother
[1:13:23] greene was
[1:13:24] all equipped who brings the equipment
[1:13:27] he's god's equipment
[1:13:28] man doesn't know i have to slice that
[1:13:31] that's why
[1:13:31] that's why i pray usually on saturday
[1:13:33] lord what would you have me say
[1:13:34] something
[1:13:35] i have no idea what you need amen i have
[1:13:37] no idea what god wants indeed to say for
[1:13:39] this day
[1:13:40] right so i if i don't know then
[1:13:43] what good is any of this but he does he
[1:13:45] does and when he gives it
[1:13:47] and he ministers the gift it's him
[1:13:50] that's him
[1:13:51] praise the lord so he's saying remember
[1:13:54] from whom thou hast learned them
[1:13:56] and that and that from a child that has
[1:13:59] known the holy scriptures which are able
[1:14:01] to make the wise
[1:14:02] unto salvation through faith which is in
[1:14:05] christ jesus
[1:14:07] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:14:09] god
[1:14:10] and is profitable for doctrine for
[1:14:12] reproof for regret
[1:14:14] uh for correction for instruction in
[1:14:17] righteousness
[1:14:18] that the man of god may be perfect
[1:14:20] thoroughly
[1:14:21] furnished unto all good works amen
[1:14:24] perfect same word and thoroughly
[1:14:27] furnished
[1:14:28] well the word furnish is basically the
[1:14:30] same as the synonym if equipped
[1:14:33] when you're being equipped with
[1:14:34] something you're being furnished with
[1:14:35] something
[1:14:36] you're being given something something's
[1:14:38] being imparted to you
[1:14:39] so that you can utilize that at a
[1:14:41] specific time that you're going to need
[1:14:43] it
[1:14:43] right we bought these chairs in here
[1:14:46] because we knew that we had church
[1:14:48] there's going to need to be a place for
[1:14:49] everyone that comes to sit down
[1:14:51] right right now you put them to use
[1:14:56] now the seats are being utilized for the
[1:14:58] purpose they were furnished in here for
[1:15:00] amen praise the lord i seem so simple
[1:15:03] friend i don't mean to simplify
[1:15:04] that to that point but but that
[1:15:08] thoroughly furnished can help us
[1:15:09] understand spiritually
[1:15:11] where we are spiritually where we are
[1:15:14] now
[1:15:15] we could have bought these chairs and we
[1:15:17] could have set them in here
[1:15:19] but if nobody come to set in them what
[1:15:22] purpose do they serve right
[1:15:24] right they have to be utilized before
[1:15:26] they fulfill their purpose
[1:15:28] that's why you are here that's why you
[1:15:30] come and sit in them
[1:15:32] because now you utilize the purpose they
[1:15:35] were purchased and put here for
[1:15:37] that's what the equipping does it brings
[1:15:40] it
[1:15:41] it not just equip but there has to be a
[1:15:43] utilization of the equipment
[1:15:45] right right which is what i want to get
[1:15:47] to next there's got to be a utilization
[1:15:50] of that equipment
[1:15:51] uh let's go i already i quoted this
[1:15:53] scripture
[1:15:54] romans i was going to read the romans we
[1:15:57] talked we already
[1:15:58] uh uh are already paraphrased that
[1:16:02] uh i'll read it quick through here
[1:16:05] because
[1:16:06] i had it written down so uh romans 10 14
[1:16:09] if you want to write it down
[1:16:10] how then shall they call on him and whom
[1:16:12] they have not believed and how shall
[1:16:14] they believe in him to whom they have
[1:16:16] not heard
[1:16:16] and how shall they hear without a
[1:16:18] preacher amen
[1:16:20] how shall they preach except they be
[1:16:22] sent well there's a lot of people out
[1:16:24] there probably that do try to preach
[1:16:26] that aren't sent they do it for ulterior
[1:16:28] motives usually different reasons
[1:16:30] popularity money as it is written
[1:16:33] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:16:35] preach the gospel of peace bringing glad
[1:16:37] tidings of good things that feat
[1:16:39] is possession of course footsteps
[1:16:41] possession but they have not all obeyed
[1:16:43] the gospel
[1:16:44] for as i said the lord uh lord who hath
[1:16:47] believed our report
[1:16:48] so then faith come by hearing and
[1:16:50] hearing
[1:16:51] by the word of god hearing by the word
[1:16:53] of god through who
[1:16:55] the preacher amen the minister faith
[1:16:58] comes by hearing the word
[1:16:59] now faith also comes when you speak it
[1:17:03] when you read the word faith it still
[1:17:05] generates faith you understand correct
[1:17:07] but the the scriptural prescription for
[1:17:10] it
[1:17:10] is for the fivefold ministry to bring
[1:17:13] the pure word of god
[1:17:14] in settings like we have here today to
[1:17:16] bring a unity of faith
[1:17:18] that's why these settings like this
[1:17:20] happen all over the world
[1:17:22] all week long depending on where you are
[1:17:25] right
[1:17:25] what time it is brother roger comes and
[1:17:27] he has a 9 30 service in here 7 a.m
[1:17:30] or 7 p.m i think in africa where he
[1:17:32] reaches most of his people
[1:17:34] at uh on sunday mornings it's it's in
[1:17:36] the evening over there
[1:17:38] see but it doesn't matter i mean what
[1:17:40] what does time matter
[1:17:42] the gospel's the gospels but now these
[1:17:44] chairs are here
[1:17:47] and they're not being utilized what's
[1:17:48] the purpose of it a person could come in
[1:17:50] and say well why do we even have these
[1:17:52] let's just sell them and get rid of them
[1:17:53] i could use the money on something else
[1:17:55] i could do something else if this
[1:17:57] building beautiful building that's been
[1:17:59] uh put together like it has for this
[1:18:01] purpose to be able to come and meet
[1:18:03] together like this
[1:18:04] and what good would it be if nobody came
[1:18:06] right what good would it be if it wasn't
[1:18:08] being utilized
[1:18:10] to where it could serve the purpose that
[1:18:12] it was furnished for
[1:18:14] amen well let's go to uh uh
[1:18:17] first corinthians i believe that's where
[1:18:20] i want to go
[1:18:21] first corinthians 14. hmm
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:34] i'm gonna i'm gonna come back to that
[1:18:35] one let's go over to revelation
[1:18:41] revelation chapter 19
[1:18:48] because we're talking about the
[1:18:49] utilization of it
[1:18:51] the utilization of the furnishings the
[1:18:54] unit the utilization of the equipment
[1:18:56] now if we've all been equipped with
[1:18:59] something
[1:19:01] that doesn't mean that um
[1:19:06] it is for the equipment's for you
[1:19:10] uh the equipment's been given to us
[1:19:14] i fight for me i fight for you
[1:19:18] but you fight for you you fight for your
[1:19:20] family we fight for one another
[1:19:23] but i can't put you in heaven you can't
[1:19:26] put me there you can't put your
[1:19:28] family there you can't put your brothers
[1:19:30] sisters mom dad
[1:19:31] spouses children grandchildren you can't
[1:19:33] put them there right
[1:19:35] they can't put you there right the
[1:19:37] equipment has to be utilized by the
[1:19:39] individual
[1:19:41] now you know you could sit there and as
[1:19:44] as brother dennis said early
[1:19:45] and i believe in faith and i absolutely
[1:19:48] believe this that leah's going to be
[1:19:49] sitting there
[1:19:50] yes i believe that when we were at the
[1:19:51] other place i still believe it
[1:19:53] and it whether the fact that she's there
[1:19:55] not there now doesn't matter
[1:19:57] right right that's just circumstance i'm
[1:19:59] not bothered with that that doesn't
[1:20:00] matter amen
[1:20:01] so the utilization of her seat is still
[1:20:04] uh
[1:20:04] not being taken care of until she comes
[1:20:07] and sits in it right
[1:20:08] then it'll be utilized for the purpose
[1:20:11] that it was sent for you say well
[1:20:12] there's
[1:20:12] some books and stuff like that but
[1:20:14] that's not what they were put here for
[1:20:16] they weren't put here for songbooks and
[1:20:17] tissue boxes and stuff they were put
[1:20:19] here for you to sit in
[1:20:21] for people to feel them that's why
[1:20:22] they're here yes and you could put that
[1:20:24] stuff on the floor
[1:20:25] amen don't put your bible on the floor i
[1:20:26] don't like amen right don't put the
[1:20:28] don't put it don't ever put your bible
[1:20:30] on the floor put anything on your body
[1:20:32] my dad taught me that when i was a
[1:20:33] little kid and i and i tell you
[1:20:36] i i've been places at times and i think
[1:20:38] where there's no other place to put it
[1:20:39] or there's no other place to set
[1:20:41] something and i try to put it in
[1:20:42] and i just can't do it i'll hold on to
[1:20:46] something before i'll put it on my bible
[1:20:47] wait amen
[1:20:48] i'll hold my bible before i put it on
[1:20:50] the floor yeah just don't do that
[1:20:52] anyway but these books and these uh
[1:20:55] tissue box they can sit anywhere these
[1:20:58] seats are for you
[1:20:59] these seats are for people see utilize
[1:21:02] them
[1:21:02] now revelation 19
[1:21:06] let's read uh beginning with verse five
[1:21:11] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:21:13] saying praise our god
[1:21:15] all ye his servants praise our god all
[1:21:18] ye his servants
[1:21:19] and ye that fear him both small and
[1:21:21] great
[1:21:22] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[1:21:25] great multitude
[1:21:27] and of the voice of many waters and as
[1:21:30] the voice of mighty thunderings
[1:21:32] saying alleluia for the lord god
[1:21:34] omnipotent reigning
[1:21:37] praise the lord amen amen i believe
[1:21:40] we're going to do that here too
[1:21:42] amen but i'm looking forward to doing it
[1:21:43] there as well
[1:21:45] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:21:48] honor to him
[1:21:49] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:21:52] the marriage of the lamb has come i
[1:21:55] believe a prophet spoke in 1965
[1:21:58] november thanksgiving message in
[1:22:00] shreveport louisiana invisible union
[1:22:03] of the bride of jesus christ amen
[1:22:07] let us be rejoice be glad give honor to
[1:22:09] him for the marriage of the lamb
[1:22:11] is come and his wife
[1:22:14] had made herself ready
[1:22:18] so what good does the equipment do if
[1:22:21] you don't use it
[1:22:23] right what good is being equipped with
[1:22:26] something you never utilize
[1:22:28] well god's not going to equip you
[1:22:29] something with something that you're
[1:22:30] never going to use
[1:22:32] god's not going to give you something
[1:22:33] that's just going to be a waste of time
[1:22:35] that you're never going to
[1:22:36] need but if the bride made herself read
[1:22:40] think about this if in ephesians chapter
[1:22:43] 6
[1:22:45] in ephesians chapter 6 says that we
[1:22:47] should put on the
[1:22:49] whole armor of god well the whole armor
[1:22:53] with god we know we can go through it
[1:22:55] find out we did one time one service but
[1:22:57] the point of that scripture i want to
[1:22:59] get to
[1:23:00] is the part that says put on
[1:23:03] right we put
[1:23:07] on the whole armor amen that's your job
[1:23:11] god has given to you the five-fold
[1:23:13] ministry has
[1:23:14] is out there giving and equipping people
[1:23:18] now the equipment is there but it takes
[1:23:20] you to take it and utilize it
[1:23:22] and use it and do something with it
[1:23:24] because the bride has made
[1:23:26] herself ready put
[1:23:29] on the whole armor of god yes
[1:23:32] the ministry equips her so she can put
[1:23:35] on the whole armor of god
[1:23:37] and make herself ready
[1:23:40] praise the lord amen now if you read the
[1:23:42] whole armor of god of course
[1:23:44] that speaks more of a warfare type of
[1:23:46] armor but that same armor
[1:23:48] is the same word that cloaks this bride
[1:23:51] in the pure word of god that is the
[1:23:54] righteousness of the saints
[1:23:55] amen amen
[1:23:58] that's what we started this service with
[1:24:01] there's power in the blood
[1:24:02] yes that blood that stands there on that
[1:24:05] mercy seat
[1:24:06] taking your place it stands there on
[1:24:09] your behalf
[1:24:10] and takes your place so you can take his
[1:24:13] place
[1:24:15] because that blood is wiped your slate
[1:24:17] clean invisible union
[1:24:20] it has made you guiltless justified as
[1:24:23] though you had never done it in the
[1:24:25] first place
[1:24:26] well if you never did it then what is
[1:24:29] this equipment for
[1:24:30] is to dress you is to prepare you
[1:24:33] is to get you ready and equip you now
[1:24:36] now the bride makes herself ready
[1:24:39] you don't come to church and say oh i
[1:24:41] did my penance i come to church or i
[1:24:42] watch the streaming or
[1:24:44] i did my pen so okay good now leave me
[1:24:45] alone i got the rest of the week to
[1:24:47] myself no no no it doesn't work that way
[1:24:49] amen right it doesn't work that way yes
[1:24:51] i have nothing to myself everything i
[1:24:53] have is god
[1:24:54] amen yes people i mean you know the
[1:24:57] bible talks about
[1:24:58] tithes and offerings and ten percent
[1:25:00] every bit of it's god's
[1:25:02] amen right now he said well ten
[1:25:03] percent's god's no all of it is his
[1:25:05] mind he's just allowed you to be a
[1:25:07] steward of ninety percent
[1:25:08] right yes that's all that's all that is
[1:25:11] amen
[1:25:12] he owns all of it it's all his my whole
[1:25:15] life is his everything is his
[1:25:16] not just a couple hours on sunday right
[1:25:19] it's all his
[1:25:20] amen that equipping that god gives to us
[1:25:23] that equipment that he gives to us
[1:25:25] is to prepare us so that we put on that
[1:25:28] garmer
[1:25:29] garment so that we put on that armor so
[1:25:31] that we equip
[1:25:32] ourselves or take the equipment use the
[1:25:35] equipment
[1:25:36] and and prepare ourselves for the battle
[1:25:40] for the rapture for for everything that
[1:25:43] god has

[1:26:51] amen but but we're not taught we're
[1:26:54] being equipped with what god's purpose
[1:26:56] is for us
[1:26:57] we don't use man's tools for god's
[1:27:00] purpose
[1:27:01] right we use god's tools for god's
[1:27:03] purpose
[1:27:04] and if he said by my stripes you're
[1:27:06] healed that's it you are healed friends
[1:27:09] period you're healed if he is by his

[1:27:22] believe you're born again if you believe
[1:27:24] you're filled with the holy ghost that
[1:27:25] just means you've utilized the equipment
[1:27:27] god gave you
[1:27:29] that's as simple as that now
[1:27:32] utilization of that equipment still
[1:27:34] continues on with where we are today
[1:27:37] that voice that voice that speaks out
[1:27:42] now the voice he's talking about here
[1:27:46] he said the voices i heard were the
[1:27:48] voice voice singular
[1:27:50] of a great multitude well that multitude
[1:27:54] was right raising their voice in unity a
[1:28:00] unity of what a faith
[1:28:02] the voice of many waters many waters
[1:28:07] now brother brahm explains to us that
[1:28:09] this was the ministry
[1:28:11] the word going forth but he declares it
[1:28:15] as
[1:28:15] one voice what's that one voice saying
[1:28:19] that one voice is god's voice ringing
[1:28:22] through a mini-member
[1:28:23] uh a body to say the same thing around
[1:28:26] the world
[1:28:29] but it's one voice because that voice is
[1:28:32] raising in unity
[1:28:33] it's saying the same thing
[1:28:36] praise the lord the voice of of mighty
[1:28:40] thunderings
[1:28:41] saying hallelujah for the lord god
[1:28:43] omnipotent look at this
[1:28:44] reigning look at this in the patmos
[1:28:46] vision brother branham addresses this
[1:28:49] voice in many waters he said what does
[1:28:52] waters represent
[1:28:54] you want to mark it down turn to
[1:28:55] revelation 17 15 you'll find the bible
[1:28:57] says
[1:28:58] waters which also sickness multitudes
[1:29:01] people's all
[1:29:01] tongues all right voice what a horrible
[1:29:05] thing he says for a drifting soul on the
[1:29:07] sea of life
[1:29:09] no pilate to guide him loose floating
[1:29:11] with the tides
[1:29:13] to hear the roar of the great cataracts
[1:29:15] the falls
[1:29:17] what a horrible thing it would be for a
[1:29:19] soul drifting
[1:29:21] the voice of many waters what is that
[1:29:24] voice
[1:29:25] it's the judgment the voice of the
[1:29:28] ministers through the holy spirit
[1:29:30] that's cried out to the people in every
[1:29:32] age
[1:29:33] standing there amen praise the lord
[1:29:37] equipping preparing
[1:29:40] ministering also that voice of judgment
[1:29:45] that's calling out because what becomes
[1:29:47] a voice of deliverance to the believer
[1:29:50] is a voice of
[1:29:50] judgment to the unbeliever the same word
[1:29:54] that saves you is the same word that
[1:29:56] condemns the unbeliever
[1:29:58] amen voice of many waters cried out
[1:30:02] thickness multitudes
[1:30:04] the voice of those seven stars in his
[1:30:06] hands of every church age
[1:30:07] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:10] baptism in jesus name speaking in
[1:30:12] tongues power of god the resurrection of
[1:30:14] christ
[1:30:14] second coming divine judgment the voice
[1:30:17] of many waters come forth
[1:30:19] this one he looked like the son of man
[1:30:22] many waters what'll it be
[1:30:24] to know that you said in a meeting heard
[1:30:27] that you should get right with god and
[1:30:28] receive the holy ghost and a drifting
[1:30:30] soul to hear that voice speak out
[1:30:34] in that meeting and you said in that
[1:30:35] meeting and heard the judgments of god
[1:30:37] priests and you refuse it
[1:30:39] right oh god it's the same voice
[1:30:43] that voice in many waters equipping is
[1:30:46] that same voice that's speaking out
[1:30:49] and still speaks out to people today
[1:30:51] repent or
[1:30:52] perish repent and get right with god
[1:30:56] amen or you'll be drifting lost on the
[1:30:59] sea of life
[1:31:00] no pilot to guide no way to go
[1:31:04] horrible thing drifting oh god
[1:31:07] there's souls out there today like that
[1:31:09] friend
[1:31:11] god help us to be able to do our part to
[1:31:13] maybe bring
[1:31:14] some of those souls in amen help some of
[1:31:17] those souls here
[1:31:19] and to see birth pains brother brown
[1:31:22] said the bible said his wife
[1:31:24] has made herself ready at the end of the
[1:31:27] age
[1:31:27] how did she make herself ready to
[1:31:30] becoming his wife
[1:31:32] and what does she what kind of garment
[1:31:35] she has on is his own
[1:31:39] word she was dressed
[1:31:43] in his righteousness amen in
[1:31:46] his word his word
[1:31:49] is her garment his word is her equipment
[1:31:53] his word is what the ministers bring to
[1:31:57] equip and to get a people ready
[1:31:59] yes a unity of faith a coming together
[1:32:03] now what happens when there's a voice
[1:32:05] that's out there that's screaming and
[1:32:07] crying
[1:32:08] in in in the wrong direction
[1:32:11] what if there's a voice that's calling
[1:32:12] people off and going and follow me
[1:32:16] come to this church or whatever it is
[1:32:19] out in the world today
[1:32:22] it's that uncertain sound brother graham
[1:32:25] talked about an uncertain sound that
[1:32:27] speaks out right the old testament
[1:32:30] when it was time for this people to do
[1:32:32] something they didn't just
[1:32:33] they didn't text one another they didn't
[1:32:36] email
[1:32:36] each other they didn't pick up a phone
[1:32:39] cell phone
[1:32:41] they had a trumpet that blasted out and
[1:32:43] that
[1:32:44] trumpet could reach the ears of millions
[1:32:47] across through those valleys and those
[1:32:49] deserts
[1:32:50] and out in the forest regions and
[1:32:52] echoing off the rocks and around
[1:32:54] everybody can hear it
[1:32:56] but if that trumpet is being sounded it
[1:32:58] would be sounded in a specific
[1:33:00] way to tell them whether they go into
[1:33:02] war or whatever the the situation
[1:33:04] gathered together whatever the situation
[1:33:06] was a feast that trump it would sound
[1:33:09] well what if that trumpet sounded and it
[1:33:10] didn't sound
[1:33:12] to tell those people what was going on
[1:33:14] what if an
[1:33:15] army was approaching and about to
[1:33:17] slaughter them
[1:33:19] and the trumpet sounded that it's time
[1:33:21] for a feast
[1:33:23] everybody would be gathering with paper
[1:33:25] hats and
[1:33:27] blow things and they would and a wars
[1:33:29] coming up with
[1:33:30] swords and and devices to kill them with
[1:33:33] they're not ready for battle right
[1:33:36] because the
[1:33:36] the trumpet gave a wrong sound
[1:33:40] the people heard it as they sound a
[1:33:42] festival a party
[1:33:44] when the sound of war is taking place
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:47] when an uncertain sound comes how do
[1:33:49] people know to prepare themselves
[1:33:51] right that's where the voice of the true
[1:33:53] ministry comes the present day
[1:33:56] that brings through a through a
[1:33:58] five-fold ministry
[1:33:59] right in first corinthians 14
[1:34:03] verse 6. now brethren
[1:34:06] first corinthians 14 6. now brethren if
[1:34:08] i come unto you speaking with tongues
[1:34:10] what shall i profit you except i speak
[1:34:13] to you
[1:34:13] either by revelation or by knowledge or
[1:34:16] by prophesying or by doctrine
[1:34:18] in other words i just come jibber jabber
[1:34:20] to you even if it's true
[1:34:22] godly holy ghost tongues what prophet
[1:34:24] what does that do for you
[1:34:25] how does that profit you you don't
[1:34:26] understand i've heard hundreds if not
[1:34:29] thousands of people speak in tongues
[1:34:30] in my life mostly back in the 70s but
[1:34:35] nevertheless i've heard lots of people
[1:34:39] speak in tongues i've never once
[1:34:42] understood any of them not saying i
[1:34:45] couldn't i could if the supernatural
[1:34:47] came and god
[1:34:48] uh i mean i've heard several testimonies
[1:34:51] like this but brother
[1:34:52] brother greeting and used to tell the
[1:34:53] testimony he went to uh
[1:34:55] to mexico i believe it was or south
[1:34:57] america anyway wherever it was
[1:34:59] in spanish speaking and and some sister
[1:35:02] would come up and she was speaking
[1:35:03] spanish he understood her in english
[1:35:05] he spoke in english and she understood
[1:35:06] him in spanish i mean that's absolutely
[1:35:08] that's god
[1:35:09] yes i mean that's just supernatural of
[1:35:11] course but if you're just sitting in
[1:35:12] church like this somebody rises up and
[1:35:14] a gift manifests itself in tongues you
[1:35:16] know i've never understood anybody
[1:35:18] right that has said that never i don't
[1:35:21] have the gift of interpretation or at
[1:35:22] least it's never manifested itself in me
[1:35:25] to actually understand to interpret that
[1:35:28] i know people who have
[1:35:30] but i have it i don't understand what
[1:35:33] they're saying
[1:35:34] that's what paul's saying if they're
[1:35:36] just if they're just speaking in tongues
[1:35:38] you can understand what they're saying
[1:35:40] he said it's more profitable if they
[1:35:42] come to you
[1:35:43] if if if he is saying speaks to you
[1:35:47] uh by revelation knowledge prophesying
[1:35:50] doctrine something in the english
[1:35:51] language of the language you understand
[1:35:53] that profits you
[1:35:56] and even though and even things without
[1:35:58] life-giving sound whether pipe to harp
[1:36:00] except they give a distinction in the
[1:36:01] sounds
[1:36:02] how shall it be known what has piped
[1:36:04] your heart like the trumpet right
[1:36:06] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:36:08] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[1:36:10] battle
[1:36:11] how do you know if you don't know what
[1:36:13] the trumpet's saying
[1:36:15] right right so likewise you accept ye
[1:36:18] utter utter by the tongue words easy to
[1:36:20] be understood how shall it
[1:36:22] uh be known what is spoken for ye shall
[1:36:25] speak into the air
[1:36:26] in other words you just speak out it
[1:36:28] doesn't mean anything
[1:36:30] right you could go out in the middle of
[1:36:31] that parking lot not a soul within
[1:36:33] 100 yards and you can talk all you want
[1:36:37] you can jabber and you can blabber you
[1:36:39] can say whatever you want but
[1:36:40] it's not going to do anything it doesn't
[1:36:42] amount and nobody hears you
[1:36:44] nothing's being accomplished no one's
[1:36:46] being equipped no one's being helped no
[1:36:48] one's being blessed
[1:36:50] amen now if you want us down in the
[1:36:52] corner and
[1:36:53] god's called you to preach the gospel
[1:36:55] there'll be somebody to hear you
[1:36:56] right but if you just go and just talk
[1:36:58] it it's not gonna
[1:37:00] it's not gonna profit anything well it's
[1:37:02] just the same thing
[1:37:04] if somebody comes in there and they call
[1:37:06] themselves a minister or
[1:37:07] they try to take the word of god they're
[1:37:09] just speaking their own ideas or they're
[1:37:11] just speaking what they got out of a
[1:37:12] seminary or
[1:37:13] they're just some man's opinion or
[1:37:15] thought or idea or made-up prophecy
[1:37:17] if they're just speaking that he says
[1:37:19] just like speaking in the air
[1:37:21] doesn't mean anything there's nothing
[1:37:24] profitable to that
[1:37:25] there's nothing helpful there's nothing
[1:37:27] equipping about that
[1:37:28] it's an uncertain sound but when this
[1:37:30] word comes forth
[1:37:32] you are born again you have the holy
[1:37:34] ghost and that word comes forth it
[1:37:36] witnesses to that spirit that's inside
[1:37:38] you amen and that word quickens in you
[1:37:40] and you become a living word amen
[1:37:42] now you're the you're the living
[1:37:44] embodiment of jesus christ the word
[1:37:46] manifested in the flesh that you are
[1:37:48] sitting in today
[1:37:50] right and you take god's equipment
[1:37:54] and make it work yes for whatever you
[1:37:57] have need
[1:37:58] whatever the lord is calling you in your
[1:38:00] life whatever god wants you to do
[1:38:02] yes and it may not be the same thing for
[1:38:06] your entire life
[1:38:07] right god may call you for something for
[1:38:09] a short period of time
[1:38:10] and he may leave out of that and call
[1:38:12] you for something for another period
[1:38:15] sometimes we get this opinion feeling
[1:38:17] that that you know once something is
[1:38:18] said it's set in stone no god can do
[1:38:20] whatever he wants to whoever wants
[1:38:21] whatever he wants hi everyone
[1:38:23] that's god amen i mean we talked about
[1:38:26] this building
[1:38:27] i i we trust and we pray and we put a
[1:38:29] lot of work and money in all of the
[1:38:30] building and it's a nice place and i
[1:38:32] love it and i hope we're here for a long
[1:38:33] time
[1:38:34] but god may call us something else
[1:38:35] tomorrow i don't know
[1:38:37] right that's up to him i don't believe
[1:38:40] he will but
[1:38:40] that that's his choice but whatever's
[1:38:43] next or whatever else comes god's
[1:38:45] equipped us for it
[1:38:46] right god has prepared us god has made
[1:38:49] us ready
[1:38:50] amen made us ready the fivefold ministry
[1:38:54] is to edify
[1:38:54] amen is to perfect equip build up
[1:38:58] get you to the place if i can leave you
[1:39:02] with this thought
[1:39:02] to get you to the place to get us to the
[1:39:05] place
[1:39:06] god to get us to the place with the
[1:39:08] equipment he's given us
[1:39:10] that when the challenge comes we have
[1:39:13] what it takes to meet that challenge
[1:39:14] right amen we have what it takes to meet
[1:39:17] that challenge
[1:39:19] god rises in our life you speak the word
[1:39:22] and and that that devil has to obey what
[1:39:24] you say
[1:39:25] yes that's right that devil has to obey
[1:39:28] what you say
[1:39:29] because it's your word by god through
[1:39:32] the equipment he's given you
[1:39:34] it's not just to stand up like the
[1:39:36] vagabond you and say oh well just go
[1:39:37] away because
[1:39:38] this is i say who jesus and paul
[1:39:41] preached no no no
[1:39:42] right i come to you in jesus name
[1:39:44] brother you can just preach no no no
[1:39:46] it's got to be yours got to be you your
[1:39:48] equipment don't use my equipment yes sir
[1:39:50] use yours right god's equipped all of us
[1:39:53] and we've been equipped that's why
[1:39:57] that's one big reason the the five-fold
[1:40:00] ministry is so essential
[1:40:02] that god has given us today to be able
[1:40:03] to equip us and get us ready
[1:40:06] to go into a rapture yeah it's a little
[1:40:08] more challenging under today's
[1:40:11] uh uh current circumstances to have a
[1:40:14] five-fold ministry come through
[1:40:16] but uh but god still takes care of his
[1:40:19] own yes
[1:40:20] amen so people can put it all on brother
[1:40:23] branham all they want but that's not
[1:40:24] what the bible says
[1:40:26] right that's not what brother branham
[1:40:27] said right right brother madam said god
[1:40:30] never ordained a mechanical device to
[1:40:32] preach the gospel
[1:40:33] right he ordained man to do it amen and
[1:40:36] he didn't say he ordained
[1:40:37] me although he did ordain brother
[1:40:39] branham too he didn't put it on himself
[1:40:41] he put it on
[1:40:42] god to man amen
[1:40:47] use that equipment that god's equipping
[1:40:48] us with amen
[1:40:50] and don't just think why it's just
[1:40:51] church is just routine it was this we
[1:40:53] sing a few songs
[1:40:55] and we got up and went home and whatever
[1:40:57] no no no
[1:40:58] god is doing something every time we've
[1:41:00] gone to church
[1:41:01] every time god spoke to us every time
[1:41:03] we've heard the ministry speak not just
[1:41:05] from this pulpit or from me
[1:41:07] amen but from the bride internationally
[1:41:10] amen god's equipping us that sword that
[1:41:14] you have
[1:41:15] to fight the enemy with that faith that
[1:41:18] he's given you to take it to the heart
[1:41:19] of the enemy
[1:41:20] and that unity of faith to bring this
[1:41:22] bride internationally together
[1:41:24] for a rapture amen go home amen
[1:41:28] to go home unfortunately
[1:41:31] it seems as though there's certain
[1:41:33] facets of this message
[1:41:35] that are trying to get away from the
[1:41:37] five-fold ministry
[1:41:38] actually in some cases put down or
[1:41:41] denigrate the five-fold ministry
[1:41:43] right but i'm here to tell you what
[1:41:45] brother branham said
[1:41:46] amen and what the bible says amen amen
[1:41:50] yes maybe should have said that the
[1:41:51] other way what the bible says what
[1:41:52] brother branham said yeah brother brahma
[1:41:54] just said what the bible said right
[1:41:55] right
[1:41:56] amen to equip us
[1:41:59] might not feel that way but when it
[1:42:01] comes up
[1:42:03] that equipment that you need you have
[1:42:05] you raise up and you

[1:42:10] you take care of goliath amen praise the
[1:42:12] lord let's stand if we could
[1:42:22] you know what would it what what would
[1:42:23] it have been for noah
[1:42:26] i mean what would it have been for noah
[1:42:28] if god had said
[1:42:30] build me an ark and noah and told him
[1:42:33] exactly how to build it
[1:42:36] and it was nothing within a thousand
[1:42:39] miles
[1:42:40] of what noah needed to build the ark
[1:42:42] with
[1:42:43] how what what purpose would that have
[1:42:45] served right
[1:42:47] and then god would get mad at noah
[1:42:48] because he didn't build it
[1:42:50] no no no god doesn't do that yes if god
[1:42:54] calls you to something he's equipped you
[1:42:56] for it amen he's giving you the
[1:42:58] equipment
[1:42:59] and if god is calling us saints as a
[1:43:01] bride
[1:43:02] to a rapture that means he has equipped
[1:43:05] us to go in the rapture amen

[1:43:22] it'll be there amen amen
[1:43:26] david absolutely 100 percent had the
[1:43:30] ability to take
[1:43:31] care of goliath long before he ever met
[1:43:34] goliath
[1:43:35] but there was no point in doing it or
[1:43:38] utilizing it
[1:43:39] until he came together when it came to
[1:43:43] goliath
[1:43:44] then he was able to rise up and use what
[1:43:46] god gave him
[1:43:48] he met the challenge that's where we're
[1:43:51] at
[1:43:52] amen that's where we're at praise the
