TRANSCRIPT
========================================
morning saints lord release the lord rich bless you this morning welcome to the house of the lord i appreciate each one of you being here today let's just stand to our feet if we could invite his presence trust him to be with us today as he always is amen but we desire to manifest himself in a powerful supernatural way for us yes amen we're in great need amen place that we live today and things that's going on in this world this country we need him now more than ever amen praise the lord brother angel would you pray for us this morning to him every one of us yes and and deal with this and only how you can do it because we need you to make these changes in our lives yes we're just this little flesh right now but there's going to be a glorious day just rejoice and be glad that we're back home with you so father we just come before you in the name of our lord jesus christ asking that today just be another amazing day with you and yes yes that you just lead us in god as each and every day forgive us of our mistakes and let that love be applied to us every day yes in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen you could be seated if you like i mean you may not have noticed because um the caretakers in all the building got here a little about about the same time i did actually uh but the building was vandalized last night when i left here yesterday and prayed i prayed over this place or protect it and keep it with everything going on and everything in an attack on the attack on life the attack on churches the attack on just the sanctity of life itself is is happening in this country rampantly now and so i prayed over this place but the people down at the end down here the massage place got their window busted out got their door knob busted some kind of mess was written on the door it was so incoherent i couldn't even really understand it a couple words of it uh busted their doorknob and stuff busted the doorknob on the bathroom back here fortunately the guy came in and got the door knob replaced so you won't even notice that there's anything happen to the bathroom but the doorknob was busted that they weren't able to get into any place but the lord came up kept us in this place safe nothing happened here so thank you i'm very thankful for that but uh it just reminds us to let us know that we continue to uphold this place and the blessings the lord has given us here and expect him to continue to watch over us amen he gave us this place amen he's obligated to take care of us and he has and i believe he will praise the lord so with everything going on saints uh it's never more time to be diligent about the lord yes be in prayer supplication we may have gotten a little stay of grace this week our country as a whole if you will with the with the lifting of the federal murder mandate they've had for almost 50 years so now that that federal has been lifted of course now it doesn't do away with abortion uh but it's to each state now each state can decide what they want and the people of their state can elect the representatives they want to represent them to uh face that situation of they dumb dumbed it down i think this was one of the biggest mistakes that people even christians made years ago by calling it abortion let's call it what it is it's murder and murder sounds harder than abortion fetus sounds a lot better than a human but the fact of it is now that that's happened who knows maybe the lord has extended his grace a little bit longer now for our country don't know believe it's imminent still and we all know that we feel the power the moving of god and how lawless this is getting uh but god protects his own yes god's gonna take care of his children amen and god bless donald trump maybe i shouldn't say that i'm sorry but he's he put those three judges on there and if it weren't for those three judges this would not have happened yes so you say what you want like and hate him whatever god put him in his place so god put him there for a reason so just like joe biden is there for a reason he was there for a reason and if it was this reason if it was nothing else but this reason that we have that little bit of grace again uh the federal mandate of murder has been lifted then praise the lord amen amen god knows what he's doing we might not recognize it right off it may be years down the road but god has his hand on it and i thank god for that amen i also want to apologize uh last week i made a little lighthearted i guess you'd say joke here probably shouldn't have done that but i didn't mean to offend anybody about the political thing and god made man and woman i i i didn't feel just nobody said anything to me nobody said it offended them but i just felt like i needed to say something and if it did offend anybody i apologize i know there's some people that aren't here that were here last week but i don't feel like it did but if it did i apologize i'd keep politics out you know at least as much as possible but um anyway the truth of the matter is it's still the same god only created a man and a woman yes that's it so where you go from the rest of that that's fine but i'll trust and believe the lord jesus he takes care of it all so he is in our lives watch over us protect us keep us amen let's enter our service today with this song amen in song number 629 in

anything did you have a psalm amen so we're going to get right to the word of god today amen genesis chapter 2 amen so thankful his presence is so near and dear to us genesis chapter 2 we'll begin reading with verse 21 amen before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious lord jesus kind heavenly father as we approach your throne of grace once again lord boldly knowing father that to have annihilated alleviated done away with every sin or iniquity or wrongdoing that could ever be held our account lord that's the only way we can approach your throne boldly father

believing that your hand is upon our lives the watchovers protect us keep us lord we thank you god for the blessings that you've given us for this day in this hour lord we look around and see how tumultuous things are getting and how lawless things are becoming lord especially even in our country how bad it's getting lord but we can walk we can talk we can live daily with a peace in our hearts

you give us today father we want to serve you that much more that much greater that much closer to you lord god today and i pray that as your word would come forth today that it would seep down into our hearts lord and reach down into there to to bring out those things that lord we desire most in life and that is the holiness and righteousness and godliness that you are and that you are in every one of our lives yes thank you for the blessings of these people that have come today those who may be streaming we just believe lord that you're going to be present as you are now to speak your word father to speak it in power and in manifestation to bring forth healing god from the preaching of your word to increase faith lord through the ministering of your word that all things will be done away with that's contrary lord to you or to your spirit we rebuke every demonic spirit in the name of jesus christ you try to hinder her infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done thank you lord for your presence we thank you lord for what you've done for us doing and going to do you commit the remaining part of the service fully totally completely in your hands and ask it in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen amen amen praise the lord genesis genesis chapter 2. uh we'll just read through the 25th verse and then let you be seated genesis 2 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh and said thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father his mother shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be and they shall be one flesh and they're both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed you could be seated if you like uh creation of man in the creation of the woman uh the woman being brought out of the man we know i want to read a couple other scriptures before we uh really delve into this now i want to continue on with chapter 3 verse 1. amen as we've gotten to this creation of the woman and um i want to speak on something today that um that i've talked to you about and that came on my heart this week and this weekend it probably is maybe a little controversial to some people uh to me uh and of course some things the lord revealed to me this weekend uh alleviated a lot of that in my heart because as you know and as i've said saints uh if i don't feel like i have a full revelation of what the lord is intending to bring i just i don't i don't bring it i don't preach it i'm not going to do that and i say that because i have done that in the past years ago uh never here but years ago when i was living in florida i think i told you before i would preach something just because i heard another minister preach it early in my ministry and and i was watching a video one time of of a brother and minister and i was taking notes and i was thinking wow wow and the lord spoke to me and he told me to stop doing that uh i could go to you in all the detail but when the lord told me to stop doing that i stopped doing it i stopped really even listening to other ministers now if i'm in another church or somebody else is preaching or preaching here or something that's different but to get a video or audio or something out once in a while somebody said well this is just outstanding i'll listen to it or watch it or something but i don't make it a habit i don't get online searching other churches and other uh streamings and things like that um i probably wouldn't do it anyway but i the primary reason is that the lord told me not to yeah so i don't and the lord tells you not to do something you don't do it right if he tells you to do something you do it man so he tells me not to do it then i don't do it so unless it's something i feel that the lord has settled in my heart and brought a revelation of it um then i put it on the shelf until that time comes but now i want to continue so we've got the creation here uh man has been created he was created a spirit man god had put him in flesh planted him in the garden of eden in in in a flesh body just like a tree uh david as we know talked about man being planted like a tree by the rivers of water and adam being planted in the garden of eden like a tree that was there god brought forth man and then from the man god brought forth a woman and she was called woman by god because she came from the man she was not a part of the original creation she was something that god had brought out of the original creation uh adam was in the original creation at this time uh the woman as will referred to her here was not actually called eve as you know adam did not give eve her name until after the fall eve did not receive her name until after the fall until after she was impregnated right that's the only time adam called her eve for the simple fact that eve the name eve is the mother of all living and because she was the mother of all living because of what had just happened he called her eve so the twins that she was carrying was her to bring forth so that at that time is when uh adam named her eve so at this point still just the white the woman if you will uh naked not ashamed that we're living in a place of holiness of course now the third chapter first verse now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made now i want to reiterate to you as i have in the past look at the word subtle the word subtle means beguiling trickery but it also means sensible now i've said this before but i just want to reiterate to you to bring it that back to your remembrance the word subtle doesn't only mean beguiling it doesn't only mean trickery and conniving it means sensible so the device is that the enemy this helps us to understand the devices of the enemy so we can see now as the devices of the enemy were in the garden of eden are the same today if they were subtle trickery conniving and sensible then they will be the same today right so what he was bringing to her made sense it made sense to her as she processed it it made sense to her so as she was subtle made sense coming but but the sense he was bringing was for deception amen for deception it's just like god created the heaven and the earth god created all the medical things he created all the scientific everything the scientists learned and everything that scientists come up with but you see out of all that is god's creation how man has taken that and twisted it against god and tried to prove by god's creation that he doesn't even exist they've taken his own creation to try to prove he doesn't exist right so you see making sense is not revelation revelation sometimes is not sensible to the human it's not has god ever revealed something to you through his word through the message that you look at and say well that just doesn't make sense but god's revealed it to you so you know it's right i've listened to brother brown sometimes and i think you know that just doesn't make sense but then when when you look in the word and god reveals it to you and you can put it in place you say well it's not supposed to make sense it's god god's ways are so much higher than ours god's faults are so much higher than ours man our little p brains can't even begin to comprehend the mind of god yes we can't even begin to approach or even think about approaching the mind of god in that way so what looks and sounds sensible to us which usually elicits the faculties of our see case still smell here or our reason conscious infection memory of our spirit those sensible things aren't the things that contact god right it's not the things that god's concerned about it's not the things that we are concerned about the things we're concerned about is of the soul the real person that you are that part of god that god planted in you before the foundation of the world that soul that was an attribute of god that was in god's mind before the foundation of the world you were part of god that's why he planted that seed in you which we probably won't get to today planted that seed in you that became you who you really are not this guy not the one you're looking at not the seed tastes still smell here the spirit and and concentrates infection memory but that that contacts god amen praise the lord that's sensible now that's the thing that that that is beguiling that's the thing that beguiles today that's the thing that throws people off because they can't understand because they're only looking at the word of god through and i say this to try to lay a foundation so give me a moment but they they try to approach god on an intellectual level they try to worship god they try to serve god with their minds instead of their hearts right they try to attack or or approach god's word with an intellectual understanding instead of revelation of the spirit and when you try to do that the only way you can can filter through it is to try to make it make sense to your intellect and if it's making sense to your intellect a lot of times i almost say this made strange but a lot of times if you're trying to make sense to it to your intellect it's probably wrong yeah that's right right because it's got to come by revelation yes and the problem that a lot of times people have is they don't approach the word by revelation they approach it by an intellectual conception and when you approach it by then i don't mean just denominations i mean people that's in this message and try to approach the word the message with an intellectual conception instead of by revelation of god's word yes and see when it's not sensible then people can't receive it but we don't receive it because it makes sense we receive it because god reveals it to us god shows it to us now does some things that we read through make human sense sure it does but a lot of the more deeper things that god brings to us that that comes from the very depths of god's mind and even through a prophet today a lot of times doesn't make common sense because this is because it's following along with god's word why would god do this and see people blame god for those things too they took us well let's just say yuvaldi for an example where was god when those children are being murdered it doesn't make sense but see when you have a revelation to understand what's going on then then it becomes a revelation you're gonna say well it makes sense then that's just our human word but it's god revealing himself is god helping you understand who he is and to grasp the mind of god to be able to get into the mind of god so that these things become something that's a part of you not just your intellect see brother random i thought about ministering this at some time but but brother brandon brought a part where in the beginning a little dramatization that when the fall in heaven took place and and satan god gave satan a choice do you want the han or do you want the the heart or the mind right satan took the mind right god took the heart so satan inherently is going to use the mind to deceive well how is he going to use the mind to deceive well he's got to make it make sense to you just like he did even the garden of eden he has to make it make sense there's got to be something that takes you beyond what is the revelation of the word to cause you to do what is against the word now that being said let's continue on remember something that is against the word also remember adam was the original creation of god eve came from adam she was not the original creation she was she was a she was a a feminist spirit that god took out of him so that he would not be alone that he could have a help mate a wife a companion now he was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made now understand this is the serpent the serpent was the instrument that the devil used this is not the devil okay this is not the devil this is a serpent this is a created being of god an animal that was there that god had created amen amen he was just the leak that the devil was able to use to bring the begotten right okay i hear people all the time eve had sex with the devil no she didn't that satan is a spirit being right he was a flesh being you can't have a flesh being having a relationship intimate relationship with a spirit being like that it doesn't work he had to incarnate himself in someone that could do it and that was the serpent right the only seed that could cross that was the only seed that god created in in pardon this word but in god's evolution it was the only place the only one had a seed that could mix with the human was the serpent you go lower than that serpent down to the monkey the gorilla whatever his seed won't mix none other will mix and of course the serpents won't now either because god cursed him on his belly right but he's the only one that can mix so and the one that satan could use to beguile eat eve did not have relations with the devil in that capacity this is a serpent that has been incarnated by the devil and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now that's a question question is to eve to the woman by the serpent god has said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden he's questioning her and the woman said unto the serpent now notice nowhere before this does it say because we just read the creation of a woman nowhere in the scripture does it say that god told eve not to partake of that tree of that fruit nowhere he didn't tell her he told adam right amen but she knew what it was how did she know because her head told her yes because adam told her only way she could have known he said well how do you know that the bible doesn't say that how else do you think she knew what god said except that adam told her amen she wasn't of the original she was living on adam's experience that god told him the most dangerous place that you can be today especially young people the worst place that you can live today is on your mom and daddy's experience right right even if they have a good godly experience you cannot live on their experience you cannot live on your children's you cannot live on your spouses you cannot live on your grandparents you have to live on your own experience right man now eve didn't have it at the time saints but there is no excuse for any of us today not to have our own experience with the lord jesus i don't have to live my life in a certain way because brother branham said right i live my life the way i do because god said so to me personally not to him to me but to me personally god's got to speak to you personally so you have your own experience you have your own relationship you have your own uh spirit of god in you without it you are deceivable yes yes if you're only living on someone else's experience you're you are deceivable look at this eve knew she said the woman said not eve the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat it neither shall ye touch it lest she die how does she know that how did she know that only two people there that could have told her right and that's out she couldn't have known it any other way god didn't tell her and if you go over to the curses after they fail god doesn't hold eve responsible for that he held adam responsible for that right you notice the curses the only curse god gave the woman is i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring four children thy desire to be sure that husband and he shall rule over thee that's that's the penalty that god laid on her yes he didn't say because you did what i told you not to do no he told adam that the next says unto adam because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife has not uh and has eaten of the tree which i commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it curses the ground so god held him responsible for what he told him not eve adam adam was held responsible for it so adam had to be the one to tell eve and eve then relays this same message oh i i got a quote for you serpent the quote is we can eat of every fruit but not the one in the midst of the garden oh i got a quote people in this message got quotes coming out the years friend we got enough quotes to paper this wall plus amen but where is the experience yeah that's right amen she had plenty of quotes she could quote adam verbatim oh this is what god said it was a quote from adam this is what he said but where was the experience amen and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as god knowing good and evil now is that true did the serpent lie to her serpent didn't lie to her that's absolutely true that's exactly what happened when they partook of the fruit that's exactly what took place he wasn't lying to them he was just deceiving them he was taking god's own words and using it against them right just like people do today yeah it god's own creation and try to prove that he doesn't exist he was taking god's own words and deceiving her with it he twisted it just a little bit just enough to make her believe oh that makes sense oh that sounds good that sounds appealing amen and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and then it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he didn't now they've both partaken of it but there's a difference in the two adam the word original creation spoken word of god was the word himself if the woman a byproduct someone that came out of the original creation not a part of the original creation thus deceivable amen deceivable why because she had what she had adam's experience not her own look at this now first timothy first timothy chapter 2. first timothy chapter 2 verse 11. first timothy chapter 2 verse 11 says this let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam look at this now adam was not deceived adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression adam was not in the transgression right eve was adam was not deceived eve was now i wanna i didn't know what the title is so i'm just gonna call it willfully versus deceived because there's a difference in doing something willfully and doing it by deception eve did it because she was deceived into doing it she was not of the original creation she was a byproduct of the original creation now that the woman was in the beginning you see why it's such a blessed thing for a sister especially to be born again and to live a godly holy ghost-filled life saint amen i always attend to the fact that y'all have the greater blessing in my opinion people always talk about how brother brown was a woman hater and priest against women no no no he preached against ungodly women right so what does that mean for the godly sister you godly sisters what does that mean for you to me it's the greater blessing amen for you to be able to live above that and and to be obedient to god his word it is a greater blessing it is i i don't say it's easy it probably isn't anything easy about it but the greater blessing in my opinion i believe but adam was not deceived why was adam not deceived well adam did the same thing she did adam partook of it just like she did she did it from the serpent and she gave it to him she fell and he fell so what's the difference adam was the word adam being the word could not be deceived he knew exactly what he was doing he walked out into that sin knowing what he was doing it was deceived she didn't do it purposely eve did not though she didn't bring about the fall of all the humanity and the sin and everything that happened she didn't do that because she wanted to she didn't do that because she desired to it wasn't a part of her she was deceived into doing it but being deceived she was able to bring the transgression now adam had to pay the price for what he did because god told him you do this and this is what's going to happen you do this and this is what's going to happen now did god do what he said he was going to do absolutely adam fell when adam fell all of creation fell and when all of creation fell it fell into a sin condition and brought it to the place we know it to be today that's why every one of us is coming and through a sex act into a sinful life every one of us born in a sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lives that's why there needs to be a transformation that's why there has to be a a a a redemption a a purchase of a of a perfect sacrifice's blood to bring us back into fellowship with god again yes that's the only way it could happen god was able to do that by bringing it forth his own son the second adam but adam notice she was not the word excuse me eve was not the word she was a byproduct of the word and she took upon herself what she was told and she lived by it until she was able to be deceived when she was deceived she created the transgression and adam seeing that transgression fully knowing what he was doing walked out into sin to redeem her to bring her back because god he knew god would have killed her if he didn't become sin himself right he took upon himself that sin dares i say now this is not scriptural friend but this is how i see it i i and i'm i'm not saying brother brown said this i'm saying it to me that was a righteous act you say how could that be going and doing what he did and falling in sin and causing all creation to fall was a righteous act if god if adam had not done that god would have destroyed his wife it was a it was a precursor of jesus christ yes it was jesus christ i wide open walking into sin and taking sin on himself to redeem his lost bride it was the only way it could be done the very righteous act of god becoming sin hallelujah saved us amen him becoming me so that i could become him he took even to his bosom and he became sin himself so that she would be redeemed knowing that they would be ejected knowing they would be separated from god he knew that god would still do what he said he was going to do but he was not deceived he was not in the transgression because he was not deceived being not deceived then there's not a transgression it's it's the thing that helped me the most saints is is a lot of what the lord's been giving us here yeah and recognizing who you are knowing there's no leaven no living no sin there's no sin accounted to you now we have to go back in our minds as i delve a little deeper into this we got to go back into our minds and recognize thought about drawing it again but i figured you all had it in your minds go back again to that trying to be we are trial beings we are body and spirit who live in a fallen condition but we are also soul down on the inside of the inside is the soul of man and that soul that's where 10 million worlds is the property that god is concerned about not this body not even the human spirit but the soul of man now the body in that condition the mind that satan chose can be deceived it can be because our bodies have not received a body change to be word bodies yet when their word bodies cannot be deceived because the word cannot be deceived amen the soul that god has converted that god has taken permanent residence in by the holy ghost sealing his own presence in there cannot be deceived which is who you really are now the body the mind the flesh the spirit can be deceived it can cause you to do things you should not do trapped mistaken into doing but that's why we have that sacrifice of the blood still laying on that mercy seat still taking our place still making intercession on my behalf it's there it's still there when we ask and call for god for repentance now i want to get to something before we close today i hope i can this is probably going to go into next week but i want to try to get to something because i want to attack a very misunderstood scripture but we'll get to that but to understand that as the word you cannot be deceived right and people try to say well uh i i'm perfect i have no sin in your flesh and your spirit you cannot say that right that's why that sacrifice is still there for us yes and when people try to get get away with that blood to do away with the blood what do you do about the situations of our bodies and our spirits that have not yet been redeemed not not the completion or the fulfillment of the redemption when the blood of jesus christ dripped the chemical of the blood and the life of the blood came back upon the worshiper lives in you and takes permanent resident and has changed your soul you're a new creature but the chemistry of the blood that drift into the earth actually redeemed this earth by that blood back to the original owner well who did where did you come from where did this thing come from from dust thou art told dust your return well if this body came from that dust and that blood has dripped into that dust then what does that do for you it has redeemed your very body spirit and soul but the body and the spirit have not been completely not been completed yet right amen we're still living in this sin world and this time body and this sinful condition but we will be because the price has already been paid amen your soul now that's a different story your soul is where god comes and lives that's where he's living now if you're born again the holy spirit lives in you and that's where his residence is and his body and his spirit remember satan chose the mind is still corruptible yes it can be corrupted that's why we have that thank god for the blood amen flowing rich and free that covers me that annihilates that sin that does away with that sin praise the lord amen thank god for that now before we go to this next scripture i want to read this to you blasphemous names november 4th 1962 now here they are he is now a son of god but he makes a mistake he knows he's doing wrong that's adam now remember adam was not deceived why because the word cannot be deceived amen the word the word cannot be in the transgression because it's the word amen adam was not in the transgression because he was the word it's like brother adam talked about a sinner can't sin because that's what he is you ever hear brother branham say that right again a sinner can't sin because he is sin that's just who he is amen i hate to do this again but if if i am who i am then it manifests itself regardless of what else other things might be going on or happen or i try to pretend or i am who i am you are who you are amen and you do what you do because of who you are you live the life of live you live because of who you are a sinner lives a sinful life because he's a sinner it's what he is amen a dog doesn't live the life of a cat because he's a dog he doesn't pretend to be a dog he doesn't say hey look i'm a dog he's a dog right he's not a cat so he doesn't go around meowing and even if he did you look at him and probably put him out of his misery thinking what's wrong with this dog meowing like a cat but he's a dog and you know it's a dog sinner's a sinner he doesn't sin it's just who he is he's just living his life he's just being who he is amen you understand so the word it can't transcript the word can't be transgressed or the word is not a transgression adam could not transgress because he was the word he knew what he was doing amen i hope that understand that now he said but now adam was not deceived the bible said so uh we just read it adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived was in the transgression adam walked with eve because it was his wife same as christ not deceived by satan but walk in to death with his bride praise the lord thank god he did thank god he did i'm glad jesus was willing to be able to walk out into into death to save me because that's where i was if that's where i was there would be no way he could have got to me unless he went into sin himself adam there's no way adam could have gotten his wife where she was at when he found her there was no way he could have brought her back without going out to get her without going where she was god couldn't god couldn't bring us back to himself unless he was willing to become one of us and go out to where we were he went out and got us and brought us back to himself that's redemption he got us and brought us back to to where he is where we should be the only way he can do that is to become sin himself praise god he was not deceived he walked in to death with his bride praise the lord he went to be with his bride so he could redeem his bride adam knew he was wrong so he walked out with e amen but there was a lamb provided as he said amen listen to this now invisible union listen very closely streaming recording here in person when i read this it struck me so to my core visible union 19 november 1965 you know was one of the ones he preached for the thanksgiving meetings at jack moore's in louisiana the complacent the complete total insanity this world will go into right away it's almost there now i think we can take almost out of that the complete total insanity this world will go into we'll take out will this world is in it's there now right how many would agree the complete total insanity of this world that's over almost 60 years ago well if he said it was almost there now where is it now right complete total insanity mine why you see the footsteps of it there it is marching right out on the street marching right on the street scrolling stuff on people's doors down here busting their windows out throwing trash everywhere there's a whole huge big balance i didn't tell you that whole big pile of trash out in front of them here this morning too everywhere it's all out on the street marching everywhere right up down um total insanity do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and being yet civilized wow i don't know that it was meant to be that way but how prophetic is that that we're living this today humans doing things that you wouldn't think they would do and be a civilized person yeah a human doing the things that they're doing today on and on we could go see all this she lost how did she do it because it was a subtle instrument called the church that was in the garden of eden a subtle person the devil walked into church just like he did the garden of eden and deceived her into it why could it be deceived what could that church be to see jesus on the outside knocking go look at revelation 3 jesus on the outside knocking of that church this layout to see a church this church agent we're in jesus is on the outside of nothing why is he outside knocking they chose intellect instead of the word of god they chose the mental conception of god a teaching a learning of god instead of god revealing that word and letting god move into your life and and just accepting some tongue speaking instead of actually the new birth of the holy spirit coming and taking rest of your soul the best evidence i know of that you've got the holy ghost is you live the life of god if god is in you you live the life of god yes brother banham said the spirit of beethoven was in you write music and play piano amen yes if the spirit of steven spielberg was on you right you direct movies of people killing each other and trying to find treasures and all this stuff that's what you do because that's the spirit that's in you that's right that's the way you live if you have the spirit of one of these hip-hoppers out here today you to come down the street to church this morning boom boom boom speaker's so loud and put your heart out of rhythm of course you probably wouldn't be headed to church if he's doing that but you never know you never know how people go to church i don't i don't condemn them i don't i don't imagine you'd be coming to this church like that but if that's who you were that's what spirit should be that's what you'd be doing you'd be doing the exact same thing i sit here on saturday and i listen to that stuff next door i have to turn my fan on and stuff so i can't hear it it helps but it's that's just what you do that's who you would be you had the spirit of white earth you would you uh you you'd kill the mcclary brothers or whatever you you had to go okay corral fight because that's who that's the spirit that's in you but if you have the spirit of god what do you do you do the things of god according to the word not according to what you think it says or what you think it's going to be you do what's right according to the word amen not my opinion so that spirit so that church now he said that devil is walked in because the church is deceived how could she be deceived because she wasn't the word to start with amen only once it can be deceived now we're talking about i'm not talking about your human flesh we're talking about the spirit realm we're talking about the soul of man only way that a person can be deceived in their soul is to not have the holy ghost right it's to not be born again because if you're born again you become the word you cannot be deceived right amen amen the only way there could be deception is because there's it's not word and all that can be shaken will be saints amen walked into the church just like he did the garden of eden deceived her into it she is deceived the woman see brother man says now she don't mean to be wrong eve didn't mean to do wrong it wasn't willfully the bible said in second timothy he goes on again she was deceived and deceived as when you will is not when you willfully do it is when you are deceived into doing it understand only way she could be deceived doing it the only reason she did it wasn't willfully she didn't mean to call us what she did she didn't mean to start that whole ball rolling she didn't mean for all this to happen but there's a place we know of that's paved with great intentions amen i think we probably i don't have any of us know that because you know the place is paved with good intentions hell is the place that is paved with good intentions right i had great intentions but where is it leading me amen no let's move on because i really want to get to this last part tip for today she didn't do it willfully she was deceived into doing it that's exactly this and now as i finish this quote that is exactly what happens today she's been deceived by television by magazines by these people all these fine things are going out on the street modern girls modern girls look at these magazines and all these pictures and look out on the street the clothing in the shops and how satan that great instrument of hell has come down among the people and deceived him into those things they think that's the right way to be and it's getting filthier all the time it's getting more and more ungodly and demonic all the time the look the dress the hair the weary look at i'm gonna delve into this for just a second but look at if you if you watch the news or you see anything about the news feed phones whatever if you look and you see all the protests i want you to look at about 90 of the people that are pro-murder and 90 of the people that are pro-life i'd almost guarantee you 90 of the people that are pro-life look more like us yes 90 of the people that are pro-death and murder piercings all over tats all over hairs blue green blue purple yellow green uh butch to whatever it is that's just and i that's just an observation not a judgment not judging that's just again that's just who they are they're just living the spirit that they are amen so i'm not condemning them that's god will do that if they die in that condition but i just want you to see the observation and talking about violent acts because of this being overturned well who's surprised about that the very thing that they're voicing their opinion about is a violent act murdering an unborn child is a violent act so of course if they're advocating the murdering of a little child you think a violent act of painting or busting a window or burning something down you think that bothers them the whole premise of it is a violent act right so you notice it's what you got today television magazines people on the street social media i'd say today tick-tock friend if you got tick-tock please take it off your phone or your tablet or whatever i don't ever tell anybody what to do but that is facebook's bad enough instagram and all that and whatever i have a facebook i'll never look at it but i have one but that that stuff is so horribly demonic it's just terrible and that that's for another story but the influence that is out there and you notice who it's working on gaining control over it's mostly the young women it's most of the young women that these kardashians and all this garbage is trying to gain the image of the of the young girls today to try to say oh this is the way it's supposed to be this is how it's supposed you're supposed to look this is what normal is today if that's normal friend take me now that is not normal right it's becoming normalized by this country by the world but that is not normal all the things they see on social media and musicians and all this stuff and nails out here and eyelashes out to here and it just it's i i've seen movies of egyptian fans that are smaller than some of these women's eyelashes it's sad 110 degrees she's like would you move a little closer and blink fast because that's what it's gotten to be yes and who how i look at my wife they think how who can think that's normal who can even think that looks good right in my day probably a lot of our days when i was growing up if a guy looked all freaky a girl would have nothing to do with him if his hair was cut all crazy or earrings or uh all this stuff a girl wouldn't have anything to do with a guy like that so guys didn't look like that and vice versa if a girl's hair was pink or something a guy would guys i do wouldn't even look at the girl must touch her having to do with her now i'm not judging i'm just letting you see the observation how things have changed and you notice the character of the people is what i'm getting to that are on the one side of the character it looks like mostly not all on the other side and how different it is amen and how different it is and i will say this this decision that happened on thursday friday this decision will further divide this country yes absolutely will this is one of the most divisive issues if not the most divisive i know and why in the world people fight so hard for it there's got to be a demonic spirit behind it yes or they wouldn't scream and yell and fight so hard for it i mean i look and i think and i know i'm looking from a certain perspective but i think what is the big deal because really the truth is it didn't outlaw abortion it just outlawed the federal government from saying it right amen so you know there's got to be a demonic spirit behind it what is that is death right yeah ronald reagan even said look at the people that are pro-abortion if they're screaming and yelling about a pro-abortion they're already alive yes the people that are yelling screaming about it are the ones that are already alive they've already made it into life it just says none of it makes any sense but it's not supposed to not to us anyway it doesn't make any sense but you see the spirit that's behind it amen the spirit that's behind it that's the whole thing deceived now let me finish this oh i did finish it deceived radio television look at those things that's garbage that's demonic scenes this music today this boo boom stuff and all this it just i i couldn't even begin to repeat some of the lyrics wouldn't want to if i could but it's just horrible it's just horrible stuff let's go to a scripture now because i gotta i gotta wrap this up uh hebrews chapter 10. i got two more scriptures i want to get to in a few next few minutes again i'll try to wrap up here real shortly hebrews chapter 10 verse 24. these next two scriptures to me are two very misunderstood scriptures and i want to by the help of the lord uh bring i believe what the lord's revealed to me about it hebrews 10 24 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another that's encouraging one another uplifting building up one another and so much more as you see that day approaching and we do for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins no more sacrifice for sins i don't know i'm going to be able to do this in the time of god if we sin willfully disbelieve mr mark willfully after having received the knowledge of the truth that sin is not a simple uh trip backslide mistake this sin is a a leaving a departing from the established truth that has come to your understanding and your attention you know of it because it says after that you have received the knowledge of the truth that doesn't mean you just heard it you received the knowledge of truth it's different to hear something than to receive it and people receive things all the time i can go take a pen and drop it in your lap and the pen can sit there but you haven't received it i gave it to you it's your opinion you can take it and use it but you haven't received it until you pick it up and put it in the use right and say this is my pen see so when you receive something it's different than just hearing something okay so it says if you have received the knowledge after you've received the knowledge of truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins sacrifice what is that sacrifice sacrifice that began in the garden of eden just after adam and eve fell when adam and eve failed god came down and they said where he said where are you oh here we are we were naked we hid ourselves so who told you were naked and after they went through all the things we just read about it god took two sheep before adam and eve could come out from the bush god took two lambs and he slew the lambs and he threw the sheepskin into them so they could clothe themselves in a bloody sacrifice that was the only way they could come out from the bush now they were still banished from the garden of eden they were still separated but god gave them a way to come into his presence again and that established a precedent that all through the old testament when god told moses that this is how it's going to be acceptable to me an innocent one has to give its life so that you can be able to be received by me again not together like it was before the fall but acceptable received it took the lamb the paschal lamb jesus the perfect sacrifice to shed his blood to bridge that a gap to bring man and god back in fellowship together again but that sacrifice that was there for adam and eve that they took to themselves god made that sacrifice and that precedent was to continue on to even to today amen even to today through us for us that bloody sacrifice still there for us yes clothes that covers me clothed in amen that bloody sacrifice now if they're if they're if you sin willfully after having now what is willfully willfully means you purposely knowingly you weren't tricked into it you weren't connived you weren't anything you saw something you received it and you said i don't want to have anything to do with it and you walk away from it that's sinning willfully not deceived into it but willfully you walk away from it there's no more sacrifice for sin now what how not what hap this to me this thing now friends this brings in the perfect light when when paul told them in the roman church about the grace of god and they told him they asked paul well can we just go sin then now you see where that nicolaitan catholic church how it comes into play and they said shall we just go sin because the blood of god is he's just gonna forgive me anyway the attitude sensible that the christian world has today oh that makes sense yeah well god will just forgive us anyway we'll just go do whatever we want to do friend you keep doing that you're going to cross that line to where there's no more sacrifice for your sin yes because paul told them god forbid because you take the grace of god and you make a disgrace out of it you keep crossing that line remember that story brother bam told about that girl when he was in service she's sitting down there and she's snickering and whatever she's doing and god uh brother brown pointed at her a couple times says what about you young lady and she just sat there got all mad at him brother man finally looked at her and said young lady this could be your last opportunity to come to god this could be your last chance she didn't come up she got mad at brother branham how dare you embarrass me in front of those people like that call my name out point at me like that how dare you do something like that god brother brad i'm sorry on the street not too long after that smoking a cigarette bottle of whiskey he recognized her or she recognized jay parson remember me he said yeah he said you know what you told me that night could be my last chance she said it was she said that was my last opportunity to come to god she had spurned god's mercy long enough she had crossed that line she crossed that line to where there was no more sacrifice for that sin she said i could see she want to hit on my cigarette my liquor bill bam said you ought to be ashamed of yourself she said i could parse and i could see my mother's soul frying like a pancake in hell it wouldn't bother me a bit that's how bad she got but when you spurn god what is left it does that's exactly what a lot of this world this country is is falling into right now it's gotting into that it's getting into that place yes where they can literally see i i don't want to keep harping on that but you understand that sacrifice you sin willfully continue and people say oh well god i just forgive me god will forgive me i'll just keep doing this and living this way god will forgive me they'll get to the point to where there'll be no more sacrifice for that sin amen but for a fearful day of looking for the judgment of god no more sacrifice sinning willfully purposefully continuing to do it and know they say well god will forgive me well that's different see but now you think about the soul of man heart of man the and the flesh of man flesh man wants to do something but if the soul is born again it commands to that spirit to that body no don't do that that's against god's word now you get a little temper or get a little upset or motion or something and do something or say something you shouldn't or make a mistake or a slip up or something and you make a mistake you say you go to god and say god forgive me i didn't mean to do that reminds me of that time brother bring talked about when we went to brother branham about his lustful imaginations brother tell us brother green tells that behind the pulpit about his lustful imaginations brother random said sit down pray and sit down with the food couch he said now you've got to do what i do you the prophet of god william branham i have to do what you you even know what i'm talking about oh yeah i know exactly what you're talking about i'm a man too i'm a red-blooded male just like you are you have to do what i do as soon as you get a hold of yourself oh god forgive me i don't mean to be like that i don't want to do this tonight it's different amen that's not someone who has received and willfully purposefully walked away from it and made a mockery of it really right there's a difference yes there's blood there's sacrifice that remains for that sin for that wrongdoing because god knows our minds our bodies are still able to be corrupted but the soul cannot be it's the word of god amen there's no more sacrifice people get that wrong so often friend i want to go to another one just another page over hebrews 12 and i'm going to close i want to get to a whole nother side of this subject but it'll have to be next week but i want to leave you with this hebrews 12 verse 15. it's another scripture i hear so many times that people say these these and they reference this scripture because somehow the devil will make you live in fear oh have i crossed that line have i made that mistake how have i gone so far brother graham said if there's still a heart in you that wants god and that wants to do what right wants to get then there's something still there pulling you yes there's something still there that's bringing into it and if that pull is in your heart give in to it yes let god bring you in because that's the whole point he went out of sin to bring you in for is to bring you back in if that pull is there there's something there it's speaking to you it's trying to get you to that place obey that pull obey that voice let god pull you in but now people look at the scripture they say now um hebrews 12 15 looking diligently lest any man fell of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears people have asked myself how could esau have been seeking repentance so diligently and with tears that he would be rejected well look at the scriptures the scripture answers that because people think you can get past that line and still have a repentant heart but be lost no that's not what it said look what it says esau who sold out his birthright for a more morsel of me for he knew for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing so the point of it is did he repent because he lost his blessing or did he repent because he was really sorry it's like my wife says all the time she said nobody's sorry until they get caught on every time she's told me that people are sorry until they get caught when it is keep doing and living and being and doing and and they just live this whole evil life and then when they get caught they're like oh i'm so sorry i didn't mean to they're only sorrowful when they get caught see esau got caught he sold his birthright he was only sorrowful he was only repenting because he wanted the birthright that's why god said he saw jacob love and he saw hater before the boy was born because he still had no respect not for god but he was repenting because he was sorrowful that he didn't have the blessing because it was afterward when he would have inherited the blessing that's when he's like oh my i'm not getting the blessing oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't mean to that's the same thing people do that they they they serve god because they're scared of him or they don't want to go to hell you don't serve god because you want to dodge hell you serve god because you love him you don't repent because you want something out of it you repent because you're truly sorrowful if nothing else comes from it you're really i'm very sorry sorrowful and it won't do it again right that's what repentance is that wasn't his repentance his repentance was after he realized he was not going to get the birth he's like oh i'm so sorry now and and ask forgiveness in repentance cried for it i want that birthright well people aren't sorry until they get caught he got caught then he was sorry it's too late then and god knows a person's heart god knows where that place of repentance is coming from and people think oh you can cross that line and you can still want to repent and god won't receive your repentance no no it doesn't work that way god does receive a genuine purposeful in your heart filled repentance god absolutely will receive right but something like this to say oh i want to repent so i can get my birth right back that doesn't work with god it might work with humans it might work in our judicial system and all around but it that doesn't work with god because god can read your heart and he knows that that repentance is true or not and his tears oh sure anybody can cry tears i could stand here right now and cry tear for you if you want me to i can any people can bring their emotions into a place that you can have tears coming out of your eyes almost anybody can do that some people maybe not but most people can that's just emotion right but something of repentance is in the heart in the soul repentance doesn't come from your flesh your spirit it comes from your soul amen that's what his desire was that's what his heart was he sinned against the word and he paid the price for it and he didn't really repent because if you read later where he met with jacob again there was nothing in his life even remotely repentant so god knew it wasn't that he was weeping and crying he really wasn't sincere in his repentance he was just repenting because he wanted the birthright amen and some people become christians because well some people start coming to church just because they're like hanging around good people because of the spirit that right a godly person projects a good spirit and they like being around that and feeling that because whether they're godly or not or have the holy ghost they can feel that presence they can feel that spirit and they like being around it some people come because they're just trying to dodge hell some people come because it's just they think it's just a covering i'm okay because i'm religious i even told craig years if they had to come fix the thing was leaking again and i talked to him the other day i forgot maybe it was saturday um about the place now he's asked me how he liked it and it asked was growing and i said but you gotta understand i'm not i'm not probably a typical religious pastor more people that's fine and good i said but i don't look for numbers the thing i'm most concerned about is the spiritual welfare of my congregation getting closer to god getting more like the lord jesus having your life closer to him becoming more sold out to him every day that's the thing that matters to me the most spiritual health is way more important to me than how many people are here but god blesses us god takes care of us god provides amen pays the bills praise the lord so he was happy about that amen so thank god god blesses us so it's not a matter of numbers of people but where's your life with god amen it can't be you can't live on an experience of he said she said oh well my grandparents were my parents are i'm in the message because of this or i believe this because so and so said no no no no don't don't live your experience on what brother branham said or some quotes or or or or even what this says live it because this is in here not here don't live because this is here you live because it's here that's what that's when you know you've you've been changed you're a new creature right amen let's stand if we could so many people are only only sorrowful and repentant when they get caught of their mistakes but there is a true repentance and that true repentance is a real sorrowful repentance that reaches to god that he respects and that he honors amen and he does it by giving us his holy spirit amen that's his identification people go get baptized and that's our identification to him that we've accepted him but his identification that we he's accepted us is when he puts his life in us amen praise the lord jesus remember power without character satanic the character's got to be there praise the lord let's sing this hey man we've sang it many times it's your heart's desire i want to live it the way he wants me to amen praise the lord jesus [Music] i until there's just no more [Music] oh [Music] the way he wants me to live until there's just no [Music] till there's just no [Music] he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more to

with new resolutions all the time break them within 15 hours of when they make them but i want my resolution to be i want to live the way i'm going to live the way he wants me to live praise the lord jesus amen marcos [Music] little marcos not quite as little anymore but if you want to come up with your dad we want to have prayer we had prayer for marcos here a couple of times amen when he was going through the surgery and everything he was going through in the hospital and wasn't sure if he was going to live and they did have to take his leg remember he wants a rededication of his life before the lord so we're going to pray for him and little marcos together amen let's just bow our heads lord jesus yes father is this man and son has come before you today i believe in his heart lord he wants to give his heart to you lord has been confessed that in his heart he feels a pull to your lord jesus and wants to dedicate and consecrate ever that much more to you father and i believe lord that you're not done calling lord you're still calling you're still pulling you're still bringing people into you and i pray that you'd move on their hearts lord today god that this be that day this be that moment of typhos god that they've surrendered their hearts and given their lives into your hands and you fill them with your holy spirit god use them lord jesus and bless them and keep them according to the moving of your spirit for their lives and help them in all the days that come lord whatever however long we might have and however long they might have still on this earth god we just commit them to you lord may you just bless them and take them into your arms now grant them your grace father as we commit them to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord god is good isn't he yes still the same today amen so many people want to have it done and over with him but god's still calling god's still pulling amen they might all come here might not all be a part of this church or whatever he's still calling yeah he's still pulling he's still god amen i believe we'll be until that last seed comes in yes that'll be a time to go home so yes amen god grant us a little more grace in this nation with that reprieve doesn't change the prophecy border border coast to coast we know it still will be amen but just maybe a little bit more maybe there is somebody in this country maybe there's more to come maybe there's others that maybe hear this truth maybe there's somebody in our path somebody to come in our path i ask god with this new job i'm about to take lord if there's somebody there if there's if that's the reason i'm supposed to be there somebody to talk to wouldn't do something somehow lord just let it be amen we just want to be vigilant about our father's business amen praise the lord i pray something was said to bless and strengthen you today of the lord lord willing i'll try to finish this next week we'll see what the lord has but we just
