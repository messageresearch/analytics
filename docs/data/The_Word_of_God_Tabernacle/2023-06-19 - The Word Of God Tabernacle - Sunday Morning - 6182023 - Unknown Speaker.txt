have here I actually several things to during the service but only one that uh that I had here one of them was we want to continue to remember sister sheily as she's still on her trip visiting with please remember her prayer she's due back Tuesday I believe late late so please remember her in prayer I know she's sad uh that she's going to miss sister Green's funeral but I remember Sister Sheila

so and and potential fathers like my son and Joel and Gabriel So amen don't point at me it just uh I'm thankful that the Lord blesses and Happy Father's Day to our Heavenly Father and for most of all amen Zach so happy Father's Day to all but that's all the prayer requests I have here you have an unspoken request at him let's stand to our feet if we could we'll take these knees to the Lord Jesus and how does the request you put out your friend so the the husband of my co-worker Chris uh the other one surgery they took all of his lower intestine out and some of this prostate out went through very well he was only in the ICU for two days before they moved into a regular room all is going well so far doing a little bit better than most so it wasn't exactly strong going into this so it's I believe our prayers are definitely helping him through amen praise the Lord pressure going up to the Lord amen I miss my dad love my dad 30 years ago January he passed away it's hard to believe I can keep track of it in my older age especially because he was born the year that Tabitha he was he passed the year Tabitha was born half the spot half is about to be 30 so so I know this is my dad's 30th year I wear my you know I always wear my tie in honor my dad he loved Tigers so I wear my tiger top my tiger tie on Father's Day so man I love my dad dearly and be reunited very soon I believe brother Dennis would you take these Lord we bow our hearts and heads in unison of the faith yes Lord Jesus to a living God thank you Father God is mindful of our needs yes and Lord I can recall as I've read in the scripture that two went into the temple to pray and one was a Pharisee one was a publican and the Pharisee justify himself all the good works he had done and how much tithes he paid and how much good he did to the people and he truly got his own reward right there yes the one uh Publican he couldn't even lift up his head his eyes to you and he said forgive such a sinner's eye yes the Lord made that speak to our hearts for you resist the proud and give Grace unto them amen let us walk a humble and dedicated and consecrated life Lord I was speaking to my brother and he he was saying I'm I'm trying I'm I'm doing better but father it's a word that you have to completely have control in our lives we have to Die daily as Paul said get ourselves out of the way that you may finish the work that you started in amen says yes he has become a good work we'll complete it against that amen thank you we believe it father to help us to get ourselves out of the way to be dead to ourselves how can we cause our pastor innocent already Abraham he sought for a city whose Builder and maker was God a continuous City it's not one that was here in this Earth but being a prophet in you there was a great City to come you know eventually to the promise of your children thank you Jesus help us to be sincere in our work with you Lord I heard a saying that really spoke to my heart this week thank you if Satan with the power that he had could deceive a third of the Angels how much more can he deceive one of us and Lord we have to be fortified with your word Lord we have to check daily if not hourly let Lord within our hearts we're staying with your words yes Lord amen the word the revealed word for the hour not some gospel that man wants to interpret or some of revelation of man's own interpretation but the truth of your word for this day yes Lord the Lord there are needs amongst your people this morning Father you we know that you said Cass all that cares upon you for you cared for us Lord greater heareth in us than he is in the world and be with our sister Sheila father yes our heads back Tuesday you're blessing her with a good trip yes better traveling mercies watch over keep her safe father and all the unspoken prayer requests Lord you know the hearts of your people yes Jesus you says that you did life in giving us the desires of our heart you said us that your Joys may be full if two shall agree is touching anything it shall come to pass that's your word that's your problem we take you at your word father We Believe grant them all the harsh desire may their cup from us Jesus may you just put a joy in our hearts of worship in our heart give you praise honor and Glory that you have met our needs according to your riches and Glory Hallelujah pastors he brings forth your word use them to speak to our hearts May our hearts be open to receive it Father for I believe in in agreement with our pastor that your coming is knocking at the door yes Lord father we need to be ready there's no Second Chances there's not a a do-over oh Father we must make things right with you right now and be ready when you come as a thief in the night to call his Home Father God Amen Lord thank you precious and holy name we pray in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like appreciate everyone's prayers I had a good week last week thank you for Moving Service up last week that helped me a huge difference uh flights were a little bumpy there and back but I felt fine the Lord blessed me so I didn't worry about it and I appreciate your prayers my knees getting a lot better it's almost 100 percent it's probably around 90 percent maybe now just every once in a while feels something it kind of I actually started feeling a little better each day even as I was working every day so I'm thankful for that the Lord has been good and appreciate your prayers even in that situation sister Norma had a testimony she wanted me to read so I'll read that to you now it says uh praise report thank you all for praying for Amanda she had surgery Wednesday and and thirds she had surgery Wednesday and Thursday uh had to go back into surgery due to not being able to I'm guess avoiding for bladder says Boyd avoiding her bladder and had severe pain doctors found that she was bleeding and removed 22 ounces of blood from her pelvis they just charged her from the hospital Friday but she had returned to the hospital Saturday because her heart was racing racing while she was resting she had surgery again yesterday they thought she was bleeding according to the CAT scan but found that her stomach was dying where doctors had stapled it but no gangrene so the doctor removed that part of her stomach I want to thank the Lord in Praise uh want to thank and praise the Lord that he had mercy on Amanda and was with her pleased to teach you to pray for her complete healing sister normal amen that prayer and thank and thank God for his for the testimony for his goodness for his hand on Amanda and answering prayer amen God is always mindful isn't he yes Lord sister Batiste put something up here said if anyone wants to have text to you dreams Visions news I find important to let her know the notification uh as you all know sister green passed away um before we've seen her last song Sister Green passed away this past week 15th um it was a tremendous loss to the world of course but it was not unexpected falling ill for a while I don't know is circumstances surrounding it but of course this degree will be great in this just a screen touched a lot of lives that's lives matter in this room uh so Micah had mentioned and I had thought it'd been on my heart to maybe ask in whatever few minutes we have here now if anyone has something they'd like to say about sister green I don't know you know I sent the I sent the thing out uh the obituary that the funeral is Tuesday at noon I plan to go I don't know if anybody else does but my intention absolutely is to be there unless you just really I I'm not telling you what to do but it's supposed to be at Eastlawn unless you just really feel impressed to go I probably wouldn't maybe stream it uh Eastland does not have a very large facility and there's probably going to be a lot of people there now I could be wrong about that maybe people are still scared of covet or something I don't know but that's what I'm thinking but I'm going to go so I planted my wife is not but I do plan to go so and be there it's at noon on Tuesday so if you would like to go and be a part of that at Salon of course by the grain about all the barrel plots and of course he bought the mausoleum spots there for his family so I'm assuming sister green will be in the mausoleum there that's adjacent to the plots that brother green had purchased there kind of the Tucson Tabernacle section so I'm assuming she'll be in there but that I imagine that'll probably be private like it was with brother green but if you'd like to go Tuesday at noon at Eastland uh to pay your respects if you'd like to do that but you have a forum here so if you'd like to if you have something you'd like to say about Sister Green feel free she always had a smile for everybody she always paid attention listened yes she is interested in anything you said amen amen you could play the piano but never have enough music lesson yeah like our piano player yeah yeah amen see she was a sweet person she was and she was always a on some kind of diet but it didn't seem to she was always trying to pushing on to her husband but he just was too busy to do that yeah okay through God bless sister anybody else [Music] sister green was a lady of Lindy's yes wonderful woman amen um I wrote her a little note and I asked her could she give me the words to a certain song songs and instead of giving it to me she's saying every one of the songs you know so maybe another Sunday or whatever and and then brother Queen over the pulpit gave me some advice not and nobody knowing it though just I miss him and they're wonderful people amen and I know we will see her again me too there amen amen sister green was really an inspiration to all of us that knew her I knew her since 1974 when I became a part of Tucson Tabernacle she was always a delight had a smile like a brother said and she had a beautiful voice a lot of y'all weren't there brother Greene told her to rest her voice when she was 50 years old and he was afraid she was going to lose it her voice she never lost it she was a blessing could sing like an angel at any time that she was called upon and I'm going to give testimony in this respect in 2009 I had my knee replaced and she heard about it and she was giving me vitamins and like a brother said she knew a lot about eating right and giving me special stuff and out of her own kindness of her heart she was you know helping me to get ready for my surgery and that was a hard surgery and yes I'm we all gonna miss her we missed brother green and um it's going to be a reunion like we can imagine when we see all our loved ones in the other side yeah God bless you praise the Lord amen that's getting closer so true so much closer anybody else amen she could absolutely sing she had one of the most beautiful voices two of my favorite singers probably she's probably my number one but I enjoy sister Sally do too she has a pretty voice but sister green just had that elegant her voice felt her personality her her voice was that elegant uh voice that was indicative of her personality and who she was but I wrote a little something I put a little something in the uh the website of Eastlawn I put a little thought that had come to me right there to write for her but uh I I probably am sure I will get a platform or a forum to say my feelings about sister green so I'm going to use this platform in this forum and it will be streamed to my thoughts about Sister Green is it on sorry I thought I had it on this is this would be if if I was able to speak this would be uh at least there's so much you can say but uh on November 17 1934 the world was blessed with a jewel Sister Janice green not only sang like an angel but she lived the life of a child of God the consummate pastor's wife that fulfilled her calling with humility dignity and Grace for nearly 50 years she stood by her husband's brother Perry greenside and together their International Ministry touched the lives of millions you would be challenged to find someone who spake ill of her and you would be even more challenged to find someone that she spoke ill about she loved the Lord Jesus in this message with all her heart she fought the good fight she kept the faith and now she is gained her reward may the Lord Jesus rest her Gallant salt till we meet again in peace amen that's the little thought that I had about sister green and she will be sorely sorely missed precious sister yes I'm assuming that they will that she will sing at her funeral because the last few funerals that she sang at everybody kept requesting and the last one I was at that I heard Sister Green sing with sister Sammy that was the last time she said the same thing she said everybody always asked me to sing for their funeral she said who's going to sing for my funeral and where and all of us are like you are so I hope they allow sister green through tape CD whatever to sing her own funeral yeah I I personally think that would be tremendously appropriate and I would guarantee you pretty much not that we scale this that in that way she would probably be absolutely by far the best person that could do it so um I I I'll miss her I love sister green very much she was so precious and she was so faithful and she was I mean we're all human but you know in times where you pin roses uh it's that time so the world has become worse but Heaven has gotten better amen from Sister Green's past I have one more song I want to sing we'll go ahead and sing it um uh song number 354. let's have it on the I have it on the screen here amen I have a source I have a source [Music] that takes me through when life is [Music] the blood [Music] those precious bodies [Music] said my name will I be leaving I just claim those preciousness [Music] [Music] peace that all he is [Music] they're just for me for all my sins my sickness and my dreams when I need healing I just claim those precious thoughts say last verse again oh I dare you not know how others [Music] oh yeah [Music] together as I do where there is [Music] amen [Music] [Music] those precious blessings were made they're just for me for all my hands [Music] in my pain when I need healing I just claim those precious thoughts say one more time now oh I claim the blood Jesus [Music] those precious blessings [Music] for me amen for all my sins my sickness [Music] I disclaim those precious Bloods days amen hallelujah thank you Jesus for that precious blood amen thank you Lord amen so thankful God his Precious Blood thank you Lord amen let's all stand if we could we'll change over the service now we're thankful of the moving of God here today Saints praise the Lord amen he's wonderful isn't he in Jesus [Music] amen we're going to go over to Genesis chapter 3 again can you read one verse of scripture here Genesis chapter 3 we're going to read verse 21. amen we enter into the today man appreciate each one testimonies comments thoughts about Sister Green and we're very precious [Music] look forward to meeting again in glory amen [Music] amen what a wonderful God we serve so thankfully he's good to us amen we had quite a few La out last week sister Sharia and it happened in his acting family so thank the lord they're all healed better doing good here with us today so praise the Lord for that amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 before we read let's just buy our heads for another word of Prayer for precious Lord Jesus we're so thankful God of your grace and mercy Lord the love that you give Lord I I just believe it's that that Grace that just swept sister green Soul right out of her body and took it home it's that Grace Lord that'll see us through to bring us to the finalization of Our Lives one day whether it be by a Rapture or whether it be by the breath leaving this body one way or the other Lord we're coming to meet you yes and Lord It's the only thing that blood that Grace that Mercy that's the only thing that will be there to stand in our place it's the only thing that can take the sin to take the guilt away from us Lord that we can stand Guiltless and be robed in your righteousness and without a spot wrinkle or blemish father only that's that's the only thing that'll bring us into that place that'll take us into your presence Lord we're so thankful father of your blood we're thankful of this word Lord that you've brought to us and revealed to our hearts we're so thankful Lord of this day an hour that we live Lord to know that God soon and very soon we are going to come home to be with you we thank you Lord for this time this place with these people for all that you've done for us Lord speak through these lips the words you have us to hear anoint each one of us Lord live and hear God that you would accomplish whatever you have for this service today we thank you Lord for coming into US Lord into this place sweeping through here with the power of your spirit Lord filling that pulsation in me even now God knowing that Lord we here today feel the same way Lord and just trusting you to speak to us to accomplish that did you have for us Lord and that Lord we lead this place closer to you Lord more like you God that will be able to celebrate you Lord Jesus in the continuance of our lives in whatever time we have left blessed now you're the remaining part of the service so we committed to you and Lord trust you in all things now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen thank you Jesus chapter 3 verse 21. amen unto the unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and and clothe them you could be seated if you'd like uh we're going to start back and continue on with the thought that we've left the last couple of weeks speaking on the holy spirit amen of course as I've told you uh many times I I major on the Holy Spirit my Ministry my desire for that and recognizing the importance of it and how vital it is into in in all of our lives and not just the token that takes us home but the Holy Spirit that's in us to lead us and guide us in all his truth to lead us in guide us into all righteousness it's the only thing that can do that is the Holy Spirit the only thing that can live the life through us is the holy spirit amen so uh it's that it that utmost vital importance Amen to understand and and and bringing into recognition of a lot that people Miss skew from the holy spirit thank God for a prophet thank the Lord that brother Branham came and brought a truth to us to understand a lot of stuff that you hear today is so far removed from what we know the scriptural truth of it is that uh that they move away from it in fact a lot of the Christian a lot of the world today just have the Holy Spirit as the third person in the godhead and thank God we know better than that that's probably the most Foundation of our faith and belief is understanding that there's one God yes there's one Lord there's one Faith there's one baptism amen praise the Lord his brother green used to say you can't feed three Gods to a Jew amen but to a Believer you can't do it either amen they know that there's one God he is the living Risen Savior amen that Holy Spirit that came out from God back on the believer now let's go to Saint Matthew chapter 27. we'll read a verse of scripture here continue where we left off last week we left off with the Paschal Lamb uh we'll go back to that for just a brief moment because I've mentioned to you there was something in there that I wanted to get to but just didn't have the time to finish it up last week uh that we want to get into today that is coming from that position but notice remember last week we spoke and read the scripture several places uh that the Paschal Lamb was supposed to be an innocent lamb it was supposed to be held up for four days to test its Purity uh to check to test for no floss there were to be no flaws no blemishes it had to be scripturally precedented to be able to fulfill the purpose that God had called for amen if there was a lamb that did not meet those qualifications then it was not suited to to meet the the uh the the sacrifice that God had called for and if Jesus Christ had not met that qualification it would not have been uh good either so we we understand that that land that was to be held up for four days to make sure it was out without blemish without fault without mistake Jesus Christ of course was tested and his life tempted above all temptation and through his ministry three and a half years going on the fourth year that his life was tested and his life was brought before the public and he was looked at and found Flawless and how many scriptures does it talk about not just his disciples but remember we read about judas's carrier and talking about innocent blood we read about pilate's wife uh Heathen unbeliever and his innocent life and his Purity we read about Pilate and his uh proclamation to all of Israel that this man was innocent and he would add innocent blood and of course then we read the scripture where the Centurion Soldier looked up at him and all the things going on around him at his crucifixion and said surely this was the son of God Amen passing that test making that uh a scriptural precedent to understand that Jesus Christ fulfilled every scriptural precedent to meet the the requirement to be our sacrifice amen amen again we'll read back uh Matthew chapter 27 we'll just read the one from pilate here the 24th verse when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but that rather a torment was made an uproar you see the same thing happened today I mean it doesn't have to be a majority of people it just has to be a little group of people that's loud enough that they shout down everybody else that happens today well this was happening here pilate gave up they got in such an uproar amen they were in such a you can imagine how many people just Jesus life touched how many people were blessed and helped and ministered to and healed because of Jesus ministry you imagine if the commoner would come up there and try to give their voice over to the few that were in charge and tell them this man is innocent and give testimony of all the things he had done well they do just like Pilots trying to set Jesus free and they're shouting him down they're saying this man is innocent he is Guiltless he should be the one that I let set free and they're like No And they shall count it down to the point that pilate just gave up pilate said I give up when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing he gave up but the rather of the torment uproar was made he took water washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person CE to it but he is not innocent because he's the one that had the power he's the one that had the authority he's the one that could have said yes or no regardless of what the Uproar was right pilot was the one in charge he could wash his hands to the couch come home and he'll never get that blood off of his hand because he was the one that had the authority and the power to set Jesus free or to crucify it was all in his hands regardless of what everybody else said amen it was on him it was his decision he could have done it one way or the other but thank God there was a reason why our savior had to go to Calvary there was a reason why they had to make a torment there was a reason why those Jews had to have their eyes blinded they had to have their theirselves blinded to who Jesus was so that they would have him crucified because it was only then that that blood could be shed that we could have Redemption and the shedding of that blood not only moved into the into the Gentile having their day of redemption we know those from from now the past 2000 years ish that we've had our time but that it will go back to the Jews eventually so we look at it and I uh we think what a horrible thing it is but if it hadn't been for that where would any of us be none of us would have a chance if that innocent lamb a lot of people come and say well that's just cruel to offer these Lambs to offer these goats and Bulls whatever they offer that's just cruel to kill these animals but what about the man Jesus Christ innocence of any charge of any crime that was ever laid to his door he was innocent of it and they killed [Music] had not been for that precious blood that come out of his his veins if it had not been for the blood cell of Jesus Christ almighty God being broke then that then that day of that Holy Spirit would have never been able to come back on the worshiper again yes amen praise the Lord remember the blood the blood cell of the animal with no soul was only able to cover the people at the time but the blood cell of God that was broke was able to bring back a life into the life from the blood that came back into the believer that change that made them new creatures amen praise the Lord let's go to let's go to Acts amen chapter 2. we'll get to this last this last part I wanted to say from Exodus and before we close today but let's go to Acts chapter two let's read about that blood cell that was broken that light that left that blood because remember the chemistry of the blood of Jesus dropped onto the Earth and redeemed the Earth back amen amen that was lost in the Garden of Eden lost in the hands of who Satan that chemistry of that blood dropped upon the Earth to redeem this Earth back but the life that was in that blood went back before almighty God and then came back in the form of the holy spirit amen just like Jesus said it would yes Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come now I the Lord's inspired me on that to understand and some of what was actually said today has been an influence to that because when you when you use the phrase fully come that means that something has been in progress it just hasn't reached its full it's foolish yet amen but when this was fully come so that means that something had already been in progress amen whether they knew it or not The Works had already been moving God had already been working God had already been moving and doing these things and moving this along but it took this one place and this one time with this 120 people that that was fully come it reached its consummation it reached his end it fully came and they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting Saints I want to tell you every week I pray for us in this place in our service that's one of my go-to scriptures Lord fill all this house where amen it filled all the house where they were they were and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them amen so this Pillar of Fire came down and it lit upon each one of them as it clothed itself as it separated itself it separated itself in a way that each one got a lick a fire amen each one got a liquor fire as it close it as it claved itself and and broke itself apart onto everyone remember at one time it was just on one person Jesus Christ amen but when Jesus died I told you the story about the spiders in Florida remember uh were like Satan thought he had he was going to kill Jesus and it's gonna all be over I told you the story of the woman killed that big spider in Florida she didn't see the egg sacked underneath him when she smacked it in 200 eggs when all the spiders went all over the place she had a mess amen when when Jesus died when he moved upon them to crucify Jesus Christ all he did was cause that blood cell to be broke and come and then break himself on millions of people then amen now I not only had one man Jesus Christ he has millions around the world that he's got to deal with yes he's probably Satan's probably thinking at this point my I should have tried to deceive more Angels than a third I had thirds not even enough anymore but we'll read a little bit when you get down to the True Believer amen what the Bible says about this day amen what we deal with in fighting those enemies but that that that that pillar fire amen that low cost came down upon that Congregation of people and it broke out upon them now notice this is in semblance of the day of the Paschal Lamb when it was 120 people in that one room they were in one place one Accord 120 of them that's hard to believe the 120 people can come in one Accord but it does happen it can't happen yes amen and it can happen again today yes where thousands or Millions however many is going in a Rapture that that they will all come together in one place at one time and that place is the shed blood of Jesus Christ it's not Tucson unlike a lot of people used to think when brother Branham was preaching or Jeffersonville or whatever it's around the world the bride is around the world but she is in one place because that one place is Jesus amen she's in Christ that is her one place what is her one a quarter or one Accord is the word or one according she agrees on the word of God the message of the hour that's her Accord so she's in one place in one according Fred listen friends Saints God is going to call this bride home just like he did there amen one place one Accord at this time it was just a breaking forth of uh uh the holy spirit that that fire that low gloss that came down in and then broke out on each one but that's not our day today our day is brother Madam said it's not a day of looking for Great Waves of revivals our day is the day that you are the Revival and it's time to go home yes that's our day praise God that's the day that we're living now this cloven tongue or this a fire that came down like like a tongue that clove amongst each one that broke itself apart amen and lit upon each one of them let's look at this because this will probably bring us into our next uh subject next week came a rushing Mighty Wind filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them now that's an anointing an anointing of the holy spirit is when it comes and falls on you you feel it on your flesh even in your spirit maybe there's a A tingle in your spine or the hair on your neck stands up or or a tear comes out of your eye or there's there's a shaking or something or or or whatever it might be I've seen people roll on the floor I've seen people scream I've seen people singing tongues speaking tongues I've seen people raise their hands and dance in the spirit I've seen women have Caravans around a church to where bobby pins laid all over the floor when they got done I've seen all kinds of them but it's the spirit that moves on them to brings them to that place it's that spirit that moves it that that that causes them to to act in that way amen it's an anointing amen that's the anointing it's on them I feel that anointing on me and I thank God that anointing is still fresh today it still falls on us when you talk about now I want to clarify this and we'll maybe get into it more next week but I want to clarify this when people talk about and when brother Anna mentioned a a refilling now I know the word filling means to fill but look at the difference between the rich virgin and the foolish virgin you say feeling what does a feeling mean well there's a difference between being anointed of the Holy Spirit and having it on your flesh or even in your spirit and being born again with the person of Jesus Christ Living in your soul there's a difference at the day of Pentecost the Spirit came and set upon each of them as an anointing and is a conjunction for first and as a conjunction which joins the two parts together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they were all filled so it wasn't just something that came on them it was something that went in them and that is what separates the True Believer from the rest of the world that's what's separate the the born-again experiences what separates a true Christian from the lake believes or the unbelies that's what separates the presence of God so when you ask God for a refilling you're not asking God to put his life in you anymore because that's done that's finished right the the Ephesians said you are sealed until your day of the Eternal destination when the Holy Spirit comes and you are born again you are sealed the god brother Adam said God seals the holy spirit in you and seals the devil out amen nothing gets in and nothing gets out until you get to your destination yes and for him we are not there yet right yes God did not seal you to rip the seal off and say I'm taking my Holy Spirit back no when you have reached his approval then you are sealed and it's done in Spanish so when you ask for a refilling you're not talking about your soul right you're saying God pour on me that Holy Spirit again that anointing fresh that's what a baptism is a lot of people use the phrase baptism of the Holy Ghost well a baptism is simply an immersing amen we'll get to it another time uh as we go through this but a baptism is simply an immersing it's not a baptism is not a born-again experience right baptism is just an immersion if you get baptized literally in water that water goes over you it doesn't go in you amen it doesn't go in you it just it just immerses you in it well that's what the on part of this holy spirit is it's a baptism it's an immersing in them to work to where when they got this spirit they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance they begin to act in crazy ways and knocking out the walls to where people looked at them and thought they were drunk they weren't just speaking in tongues they were acting like they were drunk to where everybody thought outside thought they were drunk so what are these what is going on with these people and of course is the spokesman Peter that comes out and says they are not drunk like you think they're drunk on the Holy Ghost amen this is just the third hour of the day but this is that that Joel said then in the last day he would pour out his Spirit on All Flesh not in All Flesh but on All Flesh so as the anointing covers All Flesh that doesn't mean everybody is born of that Spirit they just have that anointing so they're able to operate the exact same way I'm starting to get into the next service so I got to quit that uh they're able to operate that way just because of an anointing the anointing falls on them and that's but that's the difference you have the anointing just like it was in the day of Pentecost an anointing that fell and came on them and then you had that same anointing that same spirit it's not a different spirit it's not a different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost different uh uh uh applications one it can come on and go in they were all it came on them and they were all filled with the holy spirit so you got the on and in not just the on unfortunately a lot of people probably most people just have the on they don't have the end right yes that's why you had the situation that you had with and and people talk about I believe it was Luther that could still smoke and and drink and whatever how he lived his life he he wasn't the minister of sanctification right he was only the minister the restoration prophet of uh of justification that just shall live by faith that was his ministry he ministered and he nailed it down and he he knelt it to the thesis to the to the to the door in Wittenberg Germany amen for the whole world to see this was his stand amen like brother bam said how it was a miracle how he could protest the Catholic Church brother and said that that's one thing he said but how the man could keep his head above all the fanaticism that followed his message that was the that was the thing and that's and I believe brother Brown obviously was speaking of himself not that he could come against the the normal intelligency of the of the of Christianity or Christian Dome itself but that he could rise his head above all the fanaticism of the followed his message calling him God baptizing in his name the imitations and things of FBI coming to his services and trying to uh uh show him as a fraud and people coming up on the platform and saying they had stuff they didn't have and you know all the fanaticism and things that went around him people acting like they were prophets and and praying for people and staggering around like brother Branham did and all these things oh friend look it's just it's just an imitation of the real yeah but brother Ram was talking about keeping above all that fanaticism right oh what would it be today I mean we have to know who we are to make sure we stay above all that fanaticism amen and people claim to be say they are and so forth and so on so forth but we know that by the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit God revealing himself to you because remember we've said this before brother Adam said if you have the Holy Ghost not an anointing but you are born again you have a level of discernment amen it may not be your your uh a prolific gift but you have a level of discernment to know what is right and wrong and what is God and what is not and what is what is even 99.9 God but one tenth of a percent the devil but one tenth of a percent leavens the whole loan praise the Lord but we had the discernment to know Amen in whom we believe whom we follow what we stand for what it means to us that's the importance of the Holy Spirit living in you not just an anointing an anointing will take you to your flesh brother Ram said don't don't jump any higher than you can live amen you can jump and dance and scream and shout to the anointing but when the when the rubber meets the road when your feet Hit the Floor are you a born-again Christian who lives a Godly life out in everything else that's going on around here or do you just fall right in with all the rest of everybody and everything else going on amen notice Luther he could do that because it was it was that time yet let me read a scripture and we'll get back to this because that's that's kind of where I want this next part of this message to go so let's read this before I get past it Saint John chapter 14. uh verse 17 just to solidify what we had just talked about Jesus himself now uh Saint John 14 17. let's just start with 16. and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever okay abide with you now look Jesus was with them was he not he wasn't on them but he was with them now you notice now you've got Jesus Christ in human flesh was with them then when he was crucified his life came back and was on them and in them that covers every Jesus covered every aspect of human life amen with on end Jesus Christ he will abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth which is the word whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and conjunction shall be in you praise God the and conjunction once again is joining these two parts together of on and in Jesus telling them this is what's going to happen then when that then when that day fully came it was already in operation praise God it was already working God was already doing it of course he had been doing it since he since Genesis 3 21 when he took the sheepskins and sleuths in his mind he was already working the work but when it fully came on that day of Pentecost that's when the Fulfillment of Jesus words here became fulfilled amen they came they came to pass they came to to fruitions the words of Jesus Christ now let's go back before we get back to and I'll probably use that to jump start next week but let's go back to Exodus let me finish this Exodus chapter 12. back to the Paschal Lamb again the Passover Lamb and I want to talk about something that's been a sort of a source of misunderstanding in the message and I'll be perfectly honest I'll be blunt with you uh there have been times that it it uh I didn't understand it but as I've told you before all of you should know what does brother Newton do when he hits something he doesn't understand he puts it on the Shelf yeah right amen God I I don't I can't reconcile this I don't understand it um whatever I know Lord that that whatever time you'll do you show it to me amen and when that time comes and most of the time that might work this way for you too I don't know but when that time comes for me I'm reading or I'm praying or something a lot of times it's just been praying right there um that that the Lord will just drop it to me you know what I do then I go over to that shelf and I take it off and I plug it right where it goes in the word amen and the message and then I'm like how beautiful that picture then becomes amen how beautiful that picture looks then when you can plug that in there and say yes now I get it it's just the Lord revealing it it's not an understanding you're not learning I'm not learning anything new as far as uh intellect but it's God revealing it because I'm not looking for it most of the time in fact I can't remember one time I'm not looking for it I don't go over and take it off the shelf and try to say okay and try to figure it out I don't normally do that I'll leave it up there until the Lord just dropped something I said There It Is that's it praise God that's that's what had been been on my heart thinking about looking at praying about and there it comes amen when you least expect it the Lord brings it down the 12th chapter Exodus chapter 12. let's go back to this the Passover Lamb because again I want to get to something that is has been somewhat controversial if you will the Lord's speaking to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first of the month of you of the Year to you and again we know that's April uh speaking unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for it house now you take it on the 10th day not the first day amen which means that they killed it on the 14th left up for four days I know brother random at one place or so he said 14 because it says kill him on the 14th day but they didn't take it until the 10th amen so it's only four days a lamb for a house we went all that last week and if the household be too little for the lamb let him take his neighbor Nixon to his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make account for the lamb we went over that last week your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out of the sheep for from the goats and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening amen shall kill it in the evening now that's a that's the scripture part we went through the innocent we went through and talked about found the scripture we recognize Jesus fulfilling each scriptural precedent now not just here that's this is all we'll probably get into with this but through the Old Testament many places David how many scriptures how many times did David crying out in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit or the inspiration of God uh not the Holy Spirit speaking through him of what was going to happen at the crucifixion and Jesus Christ in his life and his ministry how many times through there but we know that Jesus fulfilled those Jesus fulfilled every scriptural precedent that was set out for him to fulfill amen the testing the trying amen the the pure the Innocence Hunter uh the the four days now it says to take in the 14th day of April the whole congregate the holistic of the congregation of Israel shall kill it when in the evening time what did we talk about last week what is the evening time when are the evening time start now it could be subjective if you look at it in nominal terms if you go outside and look at it you say well I think the evening starts at six well let's start from six in the summer or in the winter amen amen amen does it start when the Sun is setting officially there's supposed to be an official sunset to me Sunset is when the sun the crest of the the end of the sun is past the Tucson mountains that to me Sunset that's evening time but that's subjective because it never fits what the official sunset time is supposed to be so what it some people think the evening time is nine o'clock 10 o'clock that's evening it's pitch dark and now it's evening time so what is it it's subjective to almost everybody but we know by scripture spiritually not normally now but spiritually we know scripture what the evening time is because Peter told us on the day of Pentecost Peter's filled with the Holy Ghost and he said this is what we read about Joel that in the last days amen this would be poured out on All Flesh now there is a difference look now there's a difference in the evening time which we've been living in and the evening time light they are synonymous but they are different amen because they lived in an evening time they lived in the last days as Peter said as Joel said the last days we know that this is the last stage this is the end of it being as subjective as it is but we know scripturally that we are living in the last days in fact we know now we are not just living in the evening time weed because of a message that God brought to us through a prophet we are living in an evening time light amen praise God because light is what shed upon the upon things we don't know and brings light to it to bring it manifest they didn't have that they had the they had Christ they had the holy ghost at the day of Pentecost they were speaking in tongues the spirit was moving they had the Holy Ghost in them on them and they were moving about but they did not have listened closely now they did not have the evening time light because there were still many things in this word that had not been made light yet that had not been made manifest and the only way you can bring something to manifestation is to shine light on it that's the purpose of the evening time light amen so we're not friends today just living in the evening time we are living in evening time light praise God yes they've been in the evening time because this has always been progressing yes amen when the fullness came what is that fullness going to be for us amen well God sent a prophet to bring a message yes to unveil when this when the seals were preached friends there wasn't one thing in the scripture that was left unknown now there'll be things that God unfails to us through eternity but things that God put in here for us to know the reasons that God has for us to see it through the evening time light has all been manifested praise God God has done that so we could see it so we could know it amen that's why we're leaving they didn't have it in in Paul's day in Luther's day in Wesley's they didn't have it through Martin's day that light came to manifest all truth now it started to break itself out with loser now through the Dark Ages uh we'll talk about in a minute that that Spirit was bound that wasn't able to move but when the restoration prophets came along these reformers I should say came along Luther a little light was shed and a little bit was manifested to show wow this is this is what the scripture says not necessarily what it means because that's what a lot of churches want to preach to people is what they think the message or the scripture means uh we really want to know what the scripture says and when Luther read it and said the just shall live by faith that was it amen justification found its place because a little light would shine upon it it opened itself up and he could see it and he preached it and we can see it the same today amen amen justification just shall live by faith when Wesley came along a little bit more like with Sean it brought out a light of sanctification a life that should be lived that is in the place of being Sanctified to where you're you are proud of the life you live to call yourself a Christian Amen to be to live a Sanctified life now most methodists probably don't even have a clue what that even means but but sanctification is just the second work of Grace from justification they Shone a little more light to help us understand there's more to it than just justification and now we see that in this last time when when it promised again to pour out the spirit in this last time and this evening time when the light was beginning to shine itself brother random was born God was bringing forth the truth of his word a little bit of light continued to shine forth amen and in brother Brown's Ministry light was shining forth so then when that word came and it began to understand it wasn't just justification it wasn't just sanctification although we have to have both you don't forget about either one of them you don't discount either one of them we need both of them to get to the third part and that's the Holy Spirit yes when that light was shot and that that Veil came off and it manifests in itself we could see this light this truth and then when the uh to me the the consummation of that when brother random went was about to come out and preach the seals wrong again which he preached it wrong the first time say brother Newton how do you say brother ran preached wrong because he said he did right yeah and people want to worship him as God I don't know how you're going to reconcile that but that's your choice brother Branham said he was wrong yes now if brother Adam's your God you got a God that can be wrong amen you're watching listing that's the truth if you believe brother Brown is your God then you've got a God that can be wrong because brother Brown said he was wrong but then when the Holy Spirit came or he could come out the first day and showed him the truth praise the Lord that changed everything amen when the light came and it opened itself up and you could see it oh praise the Lord it makes everything it illuminates everything it makes everything so much greater and brighter and different anybody ever had problems with your eyes I know I see several eyeglasses obviously I'll look at you right now you just look like a bunch of blurry blobs amen the first time I went and I checked out and and the doctors flipping those things has this better this better this better and I'm like wow that's how that looks amen isn't this so much better than this when life Shone on something ah I know even in the job we do now sometimes before the electricity gets in there we don't have lights you got temporary lights or something it's real dark when the Sun goes down in the winter time the sun went down early it got dark and you're trying to work on something I can't even see this and I go get a little light I put it on my head and I seriously oh okay now I know what I'm doing it changes everything yeah and it working on the car you're Pat saying right now you shot a little light on you like yes okay I see that's what the word is that's what can you imagine brother Adam in that little room when God revealed the Holy Spirit came and showed that to him yeah bye I just I I'm surprised there's still walls on that house I'm surprised there's still a roof he didn't just blow it right off hey man you think when God does that and that Light of Christ illuminates something and makes it real to you it just changes everything amen praise the Lord that's what the evening time light does and the evening time light shines brighter than any other time because the evening time the light is brightest when it's the darkest light shines the brightest in the evening time now let me read you a quote that again a little bit of the confusion because people well let me just read it first and the token message in Jeffersonville he preached like four of them but this is the one in Jeffersonville the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days here he goes he says 14 days it's only four on the 10th day to the fourth day again if you're if God if brother Brahms your God your God can make mistakes that's it's it's four days scripturally then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time he says you get it the token now here it is the token never came into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me it's the evening time my message I'm dying I'm going moving out the evening time of the gospel and we've come up through justification so forth but this is that kind the token has to be applied I told you last Sunday uh it's something to speak to you about it's got to be done if we're going if we're ever going to be done it's got to be done now because we see the Wrath is already it's about ready to pass through the land and if it was then in 1963 what in the world you think would see when we go out and look at this world today yeah mine everything from under that token of that's not under the token he says from under the token but not under that token will perish that blood now the statement that brother Bradham made I again I use in in the South I hear ministers preaching about the token not even being in existence the holy spirit being in existence until the evening time because theoretically that's exactly what he said the token never come in existence until the evening time but that's not how do I put this without sounding wrong the pure interpretation that is not what brother Branham was and I hate to say the word meaning but that's not the point brother Brown was trying to make he wasn't trying to make a point that now is the only time that the Holy Spirit was in existence amen because we know and that's the thing about for me when I hear these brothers saying oh now is the only time the Holy Ghost it baffled me because I look at the scripture which is where I go I don't try to battle somebody with the message uh brother Ram said brother Ram says you can say brother random said until the cows come home it's one here one there but if we got to go back to the scripture because that's where he went yes what does the scripture say and the scripture says that on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came down and came on them and in them so how do we say that right now he said the evening time and the evening time is the time that the only time the Holy Spirit would be working or the only time it would be in existence now I just kind of gave it away didn't I uh that would be in existence let's go look at a scripture here which helped me a lot when you look at Revelation chapter 9. because remember the Paschal Lamb was killed in the evening time but what did y'all but what did Peter say about Joel this is the evening time this is the last days amen that or you will say the evening time of humanity what's the evening time for the Gentiles but it was the evening time of humanity it was the world was coming to a close yes he say these are the last days that's what we look at not last days for Gentiles not last days for Jews but last days for Humanity amen all the way through these are the last days because he's speaking both you and Gentile so it couldn't have been one or the other and knowing scripturally it couldn't have been one or the other it had to be the evening time of humanity the last couple of days so when that when when the lamb was killed and that Paschal Lamb was killed in the evening time when Jesus Christ was crucified in the evening time because that's when he was killed Jesus Christ was killed in the evening time of the day and in the evening time of humanity with a couple of days left a thousand years is one day amen one day it's a thousand years at the end of this after his death burial and Resurrection was when the day of Pentecost struck now we've got an understanding scripturally of the last days amen the last days frankly too one day is a thousand years amen twos now those last days bring us to understand that in the in in the evening time of humanity that's that that was the beginning of it that was that evening time as it continued to roll on that evening time was was coming forth now with a destination time last days because the the lamb was killed in the evening time this is the evening time light message as brother Ram said but the evening time started there so how do we say that the that the Holy Spirit never never come into existence the token never come into existence until now when we can look in the scripture and see what God did back even on the day of Pentecost we just read it amen now Revelation chapter 9. let's read a couple of scriptures here we'll get hopefully get a little better revelation of it uh as it as it helped me amen Revelation chapter 9 verse 13. and the sixth Angel sounded and Heard a Voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God same to the sixth Angel which had the trumpet loose the Four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates and the Four Angels were loosed and they which were prepared they were there prepared just means they were there there was a reason why they were there they were there they were prepared for a specific hour day month and year for to slay the third part of men amen purpose and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and I heard the number of them two hundred thousand thousand I think I've mentioned to you before if you do the math of two hundred thousand thousand is 200 million 200 million demons 200 million that were purposed to destroy that was their whole point to bring destruction to bring death now these two hundred thousand thousand demons were bound at one time and the instruction came to the sixth Angel to go and loose them and let them go it talked about the four angels and the army that was there was 200 million amen Horseman it says demons to cause death destruction were there that we're loose now look what brother Brown says here in the Feast of the trumpets he said while this group down here has got 200 uh has got has got 2 000 now again he he means two hundred thousand thousand has got 2 000 bound at the river Euphrates and has been bound for 2 000 years been bound for two thousand years also also that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2 000 years under martyrmont back there and under the church ages it has been found the Holy Spirit has been bound not at the river Euphrates but that the doors of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems now if you reconcile this and the Scripture it helps you understand when brother Graham says it did come in existence until the evening time what he's talking about is they were bound remember you so how could that be well think about Daniel for a minute how much did Daniel pray and not got an answer okay amen 23 days 22 days what was it 21 days prayed prayed prayed prayed no answer God where are you now I know it's a shorter time frame but he didn't get an answer but when the answer finally came and that angel broke through to Daniel what did he tell him he said it was resistance right right there was these demonic spirits that were keeping me from getting to you amen not paraphrasing of course amen so when people say well how could that be bound well that's exact same way the Satan had had such control over the church and Christendom that the Holy Spirit could not move right it was bound at where the Holy Spirit was bound at the door of Creeds and dogmas yes it could not move now were there little were there little uh groups that came out of there that had the Holy Spirit absolutely out of every age but the spirit could not move like it moves today amen because the evening time light it could not moved in because it was bound now when brother Adam said it didn't come into existence pardon me but that's not exactly what he's trying to get across he's trying to help us understand the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost and it moved among the people and through the first church age but there was a little blackening out and in the second Church age it was even blacker third fourth Church age he was completely black almost completely black to the point that that Spirit could not move it was bound that's what he's talking about now in this last time when there was a loosening to take place and the light was to come upon the bride for this last day that Spirit came and poured out once again on Azusa Street and continues to do so today now unfortunately or fortunately through that time God has pulled out bride many have gone on many have passed on like a preciousness degree have passed on but there's many of us left yes some of us may yet still taste yet but there are going to be a group regardless of where this place goes friend regardless of what happens in the rest of humanity or to the consummation there's going to be a group that is going to be caught away amen there's going to be a group of people that's going to make a Rapture yes that's not going to taste their human bodies they're not going to taste dead amen that spirit that was so prevalent back in Pentecost that got drowned out down through the church ages and we know there was a purpose for that it was bound it didn't just come into existence now it was let loose again praise the Lord there was a move of spirit and it didn't start overnight it started back in the Dark Ages and then when the Reformation took place and then they started printing they started building Gutenberg started building a printing press where they could take the Bible that was forbidden by the common man to read they could take the Bible and they could Mass produce it and get us to the hands of the people and then a Wesley would come and then a Luther would come along with the justification and protest in the Catholic Church the West he would come along and protest the whole thing the Bible started getting into the hands of the Common Man and a and a restoration started taking place to where it hit on the day of uh uh on the Zuzu Street on that day and the spirit was loosed again not because because of the because of the people the spirit of God it was found but it started to loosen itself it didn't happen at once but a little bit of light was Sean and in a little bit more like and now he's living in a daytime friend a a date where that evening time light is shining brighter than ever am I now what I see is starting to Wing back again we've had what they've called the Jesus movements and and uh denominations being taking a back seat a little bit when charismatic churches started coming forth again and rising and people with all kinds of gifts and stuff and these the anointings and and but it's all starting but the focal point is not the gift the focal point is not the on the focal point is the in the word the revelation of the word because he is the word and we are to become the word his bride will be a word bride because that's the only thing he can marry is the word bride because he is the word I can't marry a turtle because I'm not a turtle amen although some people are doing that today but some people are even marrying themselves I'm like knock yourself out I mean good luck trying to procreate with yourself but people want to marry themselves that that's their choice amen I'm some people Mary a garment or an animal I mean Scott's so perverted but in God's terms I can't marry a turtle because I'm a human God can't marry anything but the word because he is the word amen that's it and that's what she is going to be so in the midst of all this it is waning back to where the focus of the of the purity of the uh the unhybrid word of God has been taken off again the focus has come off the word they're still a bride that it's going to hold to this word that's going to hold to this truth it's going to hold to this message it's going to believe with everything that's in them regardless of what happens out in the world regardless of what all of the nominations now they're not denomination anymore but they have a denominational spirit and charismatic churches and what all that's I have nothing against any of them if they can try to help somebody or bring somebody in or give them just as much as they know then let it get let them give it to them but there will be abroad that'll be born again and they'll have the spirit of God living in them and the word will be the thing that's there that is their meat that's what they care about that's their Paramount that's their that's everything yeah because this is Jesus Christ yes this is what's Christ but the word in word form amen the word of God so as it's waning back away again and we knew it would I mean brother Brown quoted Paul when he said Grievous wolves would come in upon my party and they've done exactly that upon brother Brown is the party Grievous wolves come in and they say this that and the other even in the message yes all kinds of things are said and done and under the auspice of of the message under the auspice of Christianity it's amazing the stuff that people will bring under that auspice of Christianity Today and say I'm a Christian and then they live like a devil I just they live like a devil but they say they're Christians they go to church probably faithful to church a lot I'm probably very faithful to church and go and say they aren't but that's not where it's at this is where it's at everybody this is where it's at that's why if this church never existed again if we never had another service here if I was never able to see any of you or you see anyone in here ever again it's you and amen you take that away from so many people you take the message away from people or or you take all these crutches that people have away from them they have nothing but if everything's taken away from you you know what you've got yes you've got him because that's what your relationship is now your relationship isn't Church you and God or the message you and God or your spouse or your pastor you and God it's you and God Amen you and God Alone amen amen this evening timeline has come to shine light on this word so that it can be revealed to us so that we can see things that God opens our eyes to see things that many people probably maybe even want to see but can't see I can't see blind God help us in that we are in that place right now yes we're we're really what 57 going on 58 years since brother Brown passed away and we're we're right at that crossroads to me amen where it goes from here is up to the person to the world or to Christ the world's going to stay down and go their way but we're going up the bride's going up amen let's stand if we could so when people say the Holy Spirit didn't come into existence until the till the evening time and that's a pure quote absolutely exactly what he said check to make sure what they they know what they're talking about the Holy Spirit was absolutely in existence from the day of Pentecost till today but it got bound it couldn't move like we feel it like we know it to move today it was bound because of the Creeds and dogmas the teachings of what were their teaching were the Creeds and dogmas come from it wasn't the anointing it's the word Creeds and dogmas don't come from an anointing it comes from the word Satan's not worried about you feeling a tingling on your flesh he doesn't want you to get the revelation of the word amen the Crete and dogmas comes from a hibernation of the word and that's how the spirit gets bound because the word is not free it couldn't move they didn't know wasn't not wasn't their fault to say necessarily we of course went through the Dark Ages went through the fox book of Martyrs and those things you meant they couldn't they didn't know that those those brothers and sisters didn't have this bible to read all they had was what the priest told them and the priest told them believe what we tell you and then when they started getting the Bible in their hands for themselves they started to find out that the priests were lying and all this money and all this Penance and all his Indulgence not even scriptural amen my mind but praise God for an evening time life amen amen praise God for an evening timeline amen I wanted to sing a song that sister green sang and I'm trying to find it I forgot to write it down and it was one of my favorites that she sang 247.
