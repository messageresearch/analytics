[14:19] aren't with us today. Uh, kids got sick
[14:21] this week and apparently she got it the
[14:24] other day, too. So, uh, please remember
[14:27] them. They're not going to be here.
[14:28] They're out today. Sister Sheilia a text
[14:30] and said that she had gotten an ox in
[14:32] the ditch this morning trying to get
[14:34] that out. Um did not specify but the
[14:36] Lord knows.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So sister Shul is not with us
[14:39] today. Please remember her in prayer.
[14:41] Remember the Pats uh of course sister
[14:45] Karen and brother Tom's in the mountains
[14:47] now and we just part of us. So we want
[14:50] to continue to remember them in prayer
[14:51] of course. Uh also, uh as you probably
[14:55] all know, Sister Dorothy went home to be
[14:57] with the Lord this week, uh up in the
[14:59] White Mountains. We had every every
[15:02] every intention. In fact, I told my wife
[15:04] the other day, um I think it was maybe
[15:08] after last Sunday's service when she was
[15:10] in hospice care, uh that we were
[15:12] planning to go to the funeral, but they
[15:15] made the funeral on the exact same day
[15:17] as Sister Lydia's. Uh, so we're not
[15:20] going to be able to attend Sister
[15:22] Dorothy's funeral. Uh, regrettably, I
[15:24] wish we could. Uh, I would have I would
[15:28] have loved so much to have honored
[15:30] Sister Dorothy's life and precious
[15:33] sister she was to be there uh for that
[15:36] family and she will greatly be missed.
[15:39] Saints, I know I've said this several
[15:41] times with other people, but the world
[15:43] became a worse place to live when Sister
[15:46] Dorothy passed away.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. because one more precious, good,
[15:51] decent, honest, godly person has left
[15:54] this earth. Amen. And she was one of
[15:57] them. It was u I could eulogize her for
[16:02] just a minute. It was a special thing to
[16:05] go up there and minister for those
[16:07] people and walk out uh on that platform
[16:10] and see sister Dorothy's smiling face
[16:13] out there.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, and to hear her amens was, uh,
[16:18] very special because she just loved the
[16:20] Lord.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Uh, she loved life, but she loved the
[16:24] Lord. Uh, I don't know that I think I
[16:26] don't think I ever saw I'm sure she did.
[16:29] I don't think I ever saw Sister Dorothy
[16:31] Frame. I I don't think I ever saw her
[16:34] without a smile on her face. Me
[16:36] personally anyway. Again, I know she I'm
[16:38] sure she did. We all have emotions of
[16:40] sadness and disappointment and all, but
[16:42] I she always had a smile on her face.
[16:45] When we went outside after church, she
[16:47] was smiling. She was laughing. Uh some
[16:50] might call it giggling, but she was just
[16:52] happy. She was just a very happy person.
[16:54] Uh it would just meant so much to see
[16:56] her smiling face out there. When you
[16:59] said something, she would just light up.
[17:00] And
[17:01] &gt;&gt; uh it was it was an absolute honor to
[17:05] minister to Sister Dorothy. you will be
[17:08] missed so very much so. But remember the
[17:10] family in prayer. Um we know them very
[17:13] well obviously, but please remember them
[17:14] in prayer. Um that the Lord would just
[17:17] bless and comfort them. Uh the service,
[17:19] the memorial service for Sister Dorothy
[17:21] will be this coming Saturday, this uh
[17:24] 16th. Uh so please remember that in
[17:26] prayer again. Unfortunately, we won't be
[17:29] able to go because Sister Lydia's
[17:31] services this Saturday um this coming
[17:34] Saturday morning at 11:00 a.m. at Tucson
[17:37] Tabernacle. So, this Saturday, August
[17:40] 16th, at 11:00 a.m. at Tucson
[17:42] Tabernacle, uh Sister Jennifer, although
[17:45] we haven't gotten with her yet about the
[17:47] complete details, uh they have asked for
[17:50] use of the fellowship hall. Uh so, I I'm
[17:54] sure the intention of that is they're
[17:55] probably going to have fellowship and
[17:57] all afterwards. So, if you're able to
[18:00] come, able to stay, uh I'm sure they
[18:02] would appreciate that very much. So, um
[18:06] please uh uh please go if you can and
[18:09] obviously we will be there.
[18:12] So, please pray for the family too if
[18:15] you would. Uh the Lord would just bless
[18:18] and help them. That's the prayer
[18:20] request. Does anyone else have a prayer
[18:22] request on your part today? Remember,
[18:24] Micah is not with us obviously. Um
[18:27] sometimes he you know when he's here and
[18:30] playing he kind of hopefully drowns me
[18:32] out a little bit but uh we're back to
[18:35] the way we were he started
[18:37] &gt;&gt; uh acappella.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh Lord bless it. He receives
[18:44] it anyway.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I pray he receives it
[18:48] as worship to him as a sweet smelling
[18:51] savior. But remember him. Uh he sent us
[18:53] some pictures. He's doing good. Just
[18:56] pray the Lord bless his trip, give him
[18:57] traveling mercies, continue to keep him
[18:59] safe there. Amen. Anyone else then
[19:02] before we
[19:04] Yes.
[19:08] She'll be traveling back to
[19:11] Chino Valley.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Sister Katrina in prayer,
[19:22] sister Norma's granddaughter.

[19:35] &gt;&gt; His widow.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; She had a problem starting Lindsay. She
[19:41] was growing up for two days.
[19:46] And we don't know if it's an after
[19:48] effect of what passing up, but she don't
[19:53] know either. It it just came on Sunday.
[19:57] She's doing a little better. I wanted to
[19:59] see her.
[20:01] I called her before I came to church.
[20:04] She's still not moving around real well.
[20:08] She lost her equilibrium.
[20:12] Her memory is not real good. affect her
[20:15] in a lot of different
[20:19] &gt;&gt; certain prayer. Amen. Appreciate your
[20:22] prayers for me this week. It was a rough
[20:24] week again. Hot humid. Um even when I
[20:29] took my clothes out of the suitcase
[20:31] yesterday for mom for some wash them
[20:33] were still wet.
[20:35] But anyway, uh that's in the past. It's
[20:38] done. But I I appreciate your prayers.
[20:41] Do not know where I'm going next week.
[20:42] haven't been assigned next week yet. I
[20:45] don't think it's going to be Houston
[20:47] again. It shouldn't be. Uh but anyway,
[20:50] uh not sure where we're going. So, we'll
[20:52] just have to let you know about that uh
[20:54] sometime this week whenever the
[20:55] arrangements come. But do appreciate
[20:57] your prayers for that. Anyone else then?
[21:01] Praise the Lord. Have an unspoken
[21:02] request
[21:04] to death stand if we could. Amen.
[21:07] Appreciate those you are able to be here
[21:09] today. Brother Dennis, would you take us
[21:11] to the Lord?
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, it's a privilege to be
[21:15] in your house once again.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; You said when two or three are gathered
[21:19] in your name, you'll be in our midst.
[21:21] That's what makes every service father
[21:24] to know that your holy spirit holy
[21:26] presence will abide with us will
[21:29] strengthen us will encourage us will
[21:33] give us the ability as the prophet said
[21:36] we come to the house of God to hear the
[21:39] word of God to become better Christians
[21:42] to become better prepared for a rapture
[21:46] and I believe it's very very soon father
[21:50] &gt;&gt; and Lord you have put us in a race. It's
[21:52] like uh scripture says, he that's begun
[21:55] the race uh run that you may obtain the
[21:58] prize. And father, that prize is for
[22:01] everyone that'll endure to the end.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Eternal life with you, Father.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us to recognize the devil
[22:10] and all his tricks. Lord, to look unto
[22:13] thee, the author and finisher of our
[22:15] faith. Yes, God. to trust you in all
[22:18] that we do, knowing that our walk with
[22:21] you has begun with faith and grace. Our
[22:25] continual walk will be by faith and
[22:28] grace.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; And our ability to be in that rapture,
[22:32] if we're still here, will be by faith
[22:34] and grace.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; And and knowing that that which is not a
[22:39] faith is sin.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; And Lord, let us put you first in
[22:43] everything that we do. Just like this
[22:46] saying goes, if you're not if you're not
[22:48] Lord of all, you're not Lord at all.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Then Lord, we want to be better
[22:54] Christians.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; We want to live our life for others.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, God.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; There's a dying world that needs to
[23:01] receive a savior, Jesus Christ. Yes,
[23:04] Lord.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; And may we be that written epistle read
[23:08] and known of all men.
[23:10] We'll be so salty they'll thirst for the
[23:13] Jesus Christ that's in our lives.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; And Lord,
[23:18] there are several that are sick this
[23:21] morning. Father, they need a touch from
[23:24] you.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; You know who they are. They've been read
[23:28] out and they been shared and I can't
[23:31] even remember. But, Father, you do.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; You're mindful of each and from the
[23:37] least to the greatest. They're all the
[23:39] same in your eyes.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Lord, we call you on the
[23:43] scene. Thank you, Lord, that you
[23:45] minister to their needs. For thou art
[23:48] and a high priest that can be touched by
[23:51] the feelings of our infirmities. Yes,
[23:53] Jesus.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; And with your stripes, we are healed.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; And Father, you are a great physician.
[23:58] We believe complete and total
[24:00] deliverance, a healing touch for them
[24:03] that need it at this time. And for my
[24:06] brother and sister Julie that need a job
[24:09] working from home, you know the right
[24:11] job.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; You're our Jehovah, the Lord that will
[24:16] provide.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, may you just come in this scene
[24:19] and bless them with the the right uh
[24:23] work at home job that they'll be able to
[24:25] take care of their financial needs.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; And Father, bless each and everyone that
[24:32] had an unspoken prayer request. Lord,
[24:36] may ye their cup runth over. Thank you.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Knowing that faith cometh by hearing,
[24:41] hearing the word of God. And Lord, we're
[24:44] reaching out. We're believing. We know
[24:47] as we heard from the sermon last week,
[24:51] Father, that we're in a fight.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; You put us in the basis of free moral
[24:57] agency.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[24:59] &gt;&gt; God will test us. You will put us in a
[25:02] position. What decision are we going to
[25:05] make for you or for the devil?
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we got to fight for every inch
[25:10] of ground that you have given us. It's
[25:13] Joshua was given the promise. Whatever
[25:16] foot you step on, that land belongs to
[25:19] you. But Joshua, I'm not just giving it
[25:21] to you. I'm not just put it right before
[25:24] you. You must fight. Fight the good
[25:27] fight of faith and believe. We're here
[25:30] to fight and believe the best for one
[25:32] another. Yes. For them that are
[25:34] backsliding. For them that are still in
[25:37] sin. For them that refuse to line up to
[25:40] the word. Lord, they're your children.
[25:43] Deal with our hearts. Deal with them.
[25:45] Father, bring them to the place of
[25:47] repentance and total
[25:51] submission to you. Father,
[25:53] &gt;&gt; bless. He's tired, but he's a faithful
[25:56] laborer of the gospel. use them to speak
[25:59] to our hearts through your word. Father,
[26:02] in your name we pray, name the Lord
[26:05] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[26:09] seated if you'd like. Amen. We're going
[26:12] to go over to song number 360
[26:16] in song book. I'm assuming the streaming
[26:19] is working. I hope it is. Anyway, nobody
[26:22] has said anything,
[26:25] but I got it turned on, so I hope it's
[26:28] working the way it's supposed to be
[26:29] working.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; But, uh, I guess we'll see. Anyway,
[26:35] Psalm number 360. Greater is he that's
[26:38] in us than I in the world.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for that. Amen.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it. We'll start with the
[26:49] chorus here. Amen.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me.
[26:57] Greater is he that is in me.
[27:00] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[27:05] is in the world. Well, Satan's like a
[27:10] roaring lion roaming to and fro
[27:16] seeking whom he may divide. The Bible
[27:20] tells us so.
[27:23] Many souls have been his prey to fall
[27:27] and some we are
[27:30] that God has promised us today his over.
[27:38] Greater is he that is in me.
[27:42] Greater is he that is in me.
[27:45] Greater is he that is in me.
[27:49] than he that is in the world.
[27:53] And on the day of Pentecost came a
[27:57] rushing mighty wind.
[28:00] It blew into the upper room and baptized
[28:05] all of them
[28:08] with the power gater than any earthly f.
[28:15] Well, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm
[28:19] going to let the whole world know
[28:23] that greater is he that is in me.
[28:27] Greater is he that is in me.
[28:31] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[28:35] is. Let's sing that last verse again. On
[28:39] the day of Pentecost came a rushing
[28:43] mighty wind.
[28:45] It blew into the upper room and baptized
[28:50] all of them
[28:53] with the power greater than any earthly
[28:58] foe.
[29:00] Well, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I
[29:04] want to let the whole world know
[29:08] that greater is he that is in me.
[29:12] Gater is he that is in me.
[29:16] Gater is he that is in me
[29:20] that is in the world. Yes, greater is he
[29:25] that is in me.
[29:27] Greater is he that is in me.
[29:31] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[29:36] is in the world.
[29:39] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[29:42] Jesus.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm so glad he lives in us.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; The world is overcome because of the God
[29:50] that is in us.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is overcoming power. Thank you,
[29:56] Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord. Anyone
[30:00] have a testimony or something on your
[30:01] heart today?
[30:06] Just want to open if anybody has
[30:08] something on your heart. Amen.
[30:11] Yeah, brother Dennis.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, you know how the Lord just
[30:16] blesses me with his pennies.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Hasn't done it very often the last
[30:20] couple of years.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Um, when Leah was checking in July 10th
[30:25] for her surgery, there was a penny right
[30:28] in front of me and talking to the
[30:30] receptionist.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; So, I made a remarkable. Someone left
[30:33] you a tip. Here's a penny. She looked at
[30:35] me like, where did that come from? I
[30:38] said, "Thank you, Lord. I know my wife
[30:40] is going to be all right." Yes, I felt.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm gonna say this real quickly,
[30:45] brother. I didn't know Sister Dorothy
[30:47] sounds like a real godly sister,
[30:50] &gt;&gt; but when I was in New Mexico, I had a
[30:52] sister that lived in Walsenberg,
[30:54] Colorado, 100 miles from the church.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; And she would drive and she would be
[31:00] there early, earlier than anyone,
[31:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:04] &gt;&gt; And she was poor as dirt. Had 16
[31:08] very poor, but she paid her tithe.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; And that's I know you probably felt this
[31:13] way. That's one person I felt I
[31:15] shouldn't take.
[31:16] I knew she did it for the Lord.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; She was blessing. Sister Lily through.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; And she she was alive, she'd be in
[31:25] herund 102 or something, but that
[31:29] reminds me when you said yes.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Remind me of sister.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful. Amen. That's
[31:36] beautiful.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Very good. That's beautiful. That God
[31:40] has children everywhere.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; I just want to say I talked to sister's
[31:48] daughter and you know told her I'm sorry
[31:50] that service but we had prayed that
[31:53] sister would suffer.
[31:57] I know that.
[31:59] And she said that Dorothy had asked God
[32:02] to take her sleep and that's how she
[32:04] went. honored her heart to just go to
[32:07] sleepacefully.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we heard one minute she was
[32:11] in the next minute.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. She really was. Praise the Lord.
[32:36] Amen. She will be missed. Anyone else?
[32:41] Praise the Lord. Let's stand to our
[32:42] feet. Then we're going to go to the
[32:44] service, go to the word and continue
[32:48] with our thought of adoption. This will
[32:50] be part 24. So we'll go to Romans
[32:52] chapter 8.
[32:55] Romans chapter 8.
[32:58] Going to begin reading there again.
[33:01] Amen. Romans 8:14.
[33:04] Praise the Lord.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 14. Before we read, could we
[33:11] just bow our heads for another word of
[33:12] prayer? Lord Jesus, very thankful,
[33:15] Father, again, of your blessings to us,
[33:17] Lord. So thankful for this word. Thank
[33:19] you for the revelation of this word.
[33:21] Thank you, Lord, for showing this word
[33:23] and Lord, planting it in our hearts,
[33:25] Lord. that God not only you are the word
[33:27] but we becoming the word Lord in this
[33:30] mortal flesh in our human beings God we
[33:34] know that more and more we need God
[33:36] especially as we see that day
[33:37] approaching Lord that we want need you
[33:40] more and more we need to be in church
[33:42] more and more need your word more and
[33:44] more God and Lord let that word Father
[33:46] have its preeminence in our hearts and
[33:48] lives show it to us reveal it to us
[33:51] again even today
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Lord as you would speak to us Father
[33:55] Lord, may you just take this word and
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, let it find its uh bedding ground
[34:00] in the avenues of our hearts. Lord, may
[34:03] it not return void accomplish in us that
[34:05] that we need for it today. For we need
[34:07] it, God. We need it more than ever.
[34:09] Lord, may you just speak to us from it
[34:11] now, God. We'll thank you and praise you
[34:13] for all that you've done. Lord, all that
[34:15] you're doing now, continue to do for us.
[34:18] We commit the remaining part of this
[34:19] service, this word into your hands.
[34:21] Speak Lord through these lips the word
[34:23] you'd have us to hear. Father, anoint
[34:25] all of our ears to receive as God this
[34:28] will be accomplished as you sent it
[34:30] forth. We ask it in the name of the Lord
[34:32] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; And Romans 8 again verse 14. For as many
[34:39] as are led by the spirit of God, they
[34:41] are the sons of God. For you have not
[34:43] received the spirit of bondage again to
[34:45] fear, but you have received the spirit
[34:46] of adoption whereby we cry ab father.
[34:49] The spirit itself beareth witness with
[34:51] our spirit that we are the children of
[34:53] God and of children then hes of God and
[34:57] joint hes with Christ. If so be that we
[34:59] suffer with him that we may be also
[35:02] glorified together. Amen. You can be
[35:05] seated if you'd like. Amen. So again as
[35:08] we say this will be adoption part 24.
[35:12] Amen. And this uh subtitle will subtitle
[35:15] is uh abide in your calling.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:19] Amen. Adoption part 24. Uh, abide in
[35:23] your calling. Praise the Lord. So, as we
[35:26] finished last Sunday, we want to go back
[35:28] over as we finished off kind of try to
[35:31] kickstart for today last Sunday. I want
[35:33] to read again in 1 Corinthians chapter 7
[35:37] and uh read these verses of scripture
[35:39] over again if we could uh and start to
[35:42] draw a little bit uh more out of this.
[35:44] abiding in our calling. Again, uh as
[35:48] last Sunday, uh this will probably be a
[35:50] fairly short service, but uh as the Lord
[35:52] leads, Amen. Just want to be uh be his
[35:56] instrument, whatever he has for us to
[35:58] do. Amen. Whatever he wants to be said
[36:00] or done in this service.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want. Praise the
[36:04] Lord. So, we're going over to 1
[36:05] Corinthians chapter 7.
[36:08] Amen. We'll begin with verse uh
[36:12] 17. Let's start with verse 17. Amen.
[36:16] 1 Corinthians 7:17. But as God hath
[36:19] distributed to every man, as the Lord
[36:22] hath called everyone, so let him walk
[36:27] and so ordain or ordain I in all
[36:30] churches. Is any man called being
[36:33] circumcised? Let him not become
[36:35] uncircumcised. Is any man called in
[36:38] uncircumcision? Let him be circumcised.
[36:41] Circumcision is nothing, and
[36:43] uncircumcision is nothing, but the
[36:45] keeping of the commandments of God, that
[36:48] every man abide in the same calling,
[36:52] wherein he was called. Art thou called,
[36:55] being a servant, care not for it. But if
[36:58] thou mayest be made free, use it rather.
[37:02] For he that is called in the Lord, being
[37:04] a servant, is the Lord's free man.
[37:07] Likewise also, he that is called being
[37:10] free is Christ's servant.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Ye are bought with a price. Be not ye
[37:15] therefore uh be not ye the servants of
[37:18] men. Brethren, let every man wherein he
[37:22] is called therein abide with God.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abide with God. Now, as I read
[37:31] through this, I want to break this down
[37:33] a little bit as we look into this. Uh
[37:38] I uh before I do that, I got a I got a
[37:41] text from brother Roger uh Collins,
[37:43] which uh I haven't talked to him uh but
[37:46] just the one time last week when I was
[37:48] working, but um he had mentioned of
[37:51] course we knew and I had we had prayer
[37:53] for him, his family last week with his
[37:55] mother's passing. But I had also found
[37:57] out that he told me uh I knew she was
[38:00] close, but uh sister Wheeler, the older
[38:02] sister Wheeler, uh was uh very close to
[38:07] passing as well. And uh I learned that
[38:10] from brother Dan uh Evans, pastor of the
[38:12] tabernacle, when I was talking to him
[38:14] about having the service over there for
[38:16] Sister Lydia. And he had told me about
[38:18] that, but I didn't know she had passed.
[38:20] But uh brother Roger then text me and
[38:22] told me that sister Wheeler had passed
[38:25] away as well on the exact same day as
[38:27] his mother.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; So his mother and sister Wheeler, both
[38:31] wives of deacons at the two at the
[38:34] Brandom Tabernacle, passed away on the
[38:37] same day.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; And it Yeah, it it is to me it's a wow
[38:41] to realize that these things don't
[38:43] happen. I I these aren't coincidences to
[38:45] me.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Uh that that this would happen. And of
[38:48] course he mentioned that I think that's
[38:50] the biggest reason that he told me about
[38:52] that or mentioned that was that we me
[38:55] and brother Roger liking that word that
[38:56] we don't consider things like this
[38:58] happening when the Lord does things and
[39:01] when heaven is moving and things are
[39:03] happening uh when God is continuing to
[39:06] let things come to pass here as they
[39:08] have here on on earth and we've seen how
[39:11] many people even godly good people
[39:14] passing in the past uh couple of weeks
[39:16] or so
[39:17] &gt;&gt; right Uh it it just gets you it just
[39:20] gets you to the point to understand the
[39:21] Lord is doing something. We're we're
[39:24] this thing is winding down. We're
[39:26] getting to an ending of this. Uh, and
[39:28] I'm I'm not sure as we've said so many
[39:31] times and I know brother Dennis has had
[39:33] it in his prayer several times and has
[39:35] been mentioned and talked about several
[39:37] times of uh of how close that we are to
[39:40] a rapture, how close we are to an end in
[39:43] this world, to an end of this time and
[39:45] to a ushering in of the tribulation and
[39:47] the bride going in a rapture um to to
[39:52] make sure that we're ready. Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But I I I've got I've
[39:57] gotten to the point that um uh I I I'm
[40:00] more into the uh the thought of the
[40:04] adoption uh than I am necessarily about
[40:07] where I know Brother Brandham said it
[40:09] many times and we've said it, I've said
[40:11] it uh to make sure you're ready or get
[40:14] yourself ready or something to that
[40:16] effect, but the truth of it is really
[40:18] you're a Christian or you're not.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; You're born again or you're not. Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; You belong to God or you don't. You're
[40:24] part of the bride or you're not. You've
[40:25] been called or you haven't.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Uh and all all the bride all the bride
[40:30] to me really is doing is just living
[40:33] their life in the calling God's called
[40:35] them,
[40:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:36] &gt;&gt; They're they're just uh it it's not a
[40:40] matter of scrambling to do something
[40:42] different. It's not a matter of calling
[40:45] all night prayer meetings. all. There's
[40:47] nothing wrong with that, but it's not a
[40:49] matter of of scrambling things around to
[40:52] try to uh do this and do that and let's
[40:54] have church more and let's do this more.
[40:56] So, you just live your life. Brother Bam
[40:58] said, "If I knew he was coming today, I'
[41:00] tomorrow I'd plant my potatoes today."
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; I would I just want to be found faithful
[41:06] at my post. Amen.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; That's all it is.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's all life is. That's all
[41:11] the end of this is going to be. That's
[41:13] all the rapture is going to be about.
[41:15] We're going to be about the father's
[41:16] business and God's going to call us
[41:18] home.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; It might be in church. It might not. You
[41:23] might be on your job. You might be in
[41:24] your living room. You might be having
[41:26] dinner. God's going to call us.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And I believe anytime we'll see our
[41:32] loved ones appear before us. But it's
[41:34] just a matter of it's just a matter of
[41:36] of of of living your life.
[41:40] Be godly. Be a Christian. be be what
[41:44] God's called you to be. Do what God's
[41:45] called you to do. Amen. And when it time
[41:48] is for us to go, he'll call us.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; And we'll go.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it's it it's
[41:55] although we try to make it sound like
[41:57] it's you know uh you know this thing to
[42:02] try to get a little extra juice or
[42:05] something. Just just be the Christian
[42:06] that you are.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Just be the person God made you. Just be
[42:11] just be found faithful at your post.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do what God's called you to do. Be
[42:17] who God's made you. That's that's the
[42:19] best thing you can do. Amen. And then
[42:22] when you get on the other side, he'll
[42:23] say, "Well done, my good and faithful
[42:26] servant. Enter in enter ye into the joys
[42:28] of the Lord.
[42:30] Be found faithful at the post." Praise
[42:32] the Lord. So part of that so that that
[42:35] all to me uh having said all that boils
[42:38] right down to what we've been talking
[42:40] about and this subject that we've been
[42:43] uh delving into for several actually two
[42:47] or three months now uh on adoption.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And making sure that our calling and
[42:52] election is sure. Making sure that we're
[42:55] in our position. We're in our place.
[42:57] We're dwelling in our calling. We're not
[42:59] interested in trying to be someone else.
[43:02] We're not interested in trying to enter
[43:03] into someone else's calling or someone
[43:06] else's uh position. We're we're just
[43:08] trying to be faithful at what God's
[43:10] called us to do.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Even if it as as uh Paul said here, even
[43:15] if it's just being a servant or whatever
[43:18] the capacity that is. I'm sure he didn't
[43:20] mean God servant just being someone who
[43:22] is a servant here on earth, which really
[43:25] truthfully as a Christian, we're all
[43:26] servants.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; We all serve one another every day. We
[43:30] should. Amen. in our prayer life and in
[43:32] our uh life of concern and calls and
[43:35] texts and church and things that we do
[43:38] with one another, we all do for each
[43:40] other as servants to one another.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Uh as we serve the Lord because as we
[43:46] serve one another, we serve the Lord.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; And that's all a part of what God has
[43:50] called us to do
[43:52] &gt;&gt; in our lives. But let's go back to this
[43:55] and and look uh because this this really
[43:59] is the foreground of what we just said.
[44:03] All that we said just sums up here in
[44:05] this in this reading again. So let's
[44:08] let's go back to the the 17th verse
[44:10] again. But as God had distributed. So
[44:13] God has distributed to every man, every
[44:16] person, every being, each person. It
[44:20] should say God has distributed to each
[44:23] person as the Lord has called each
[44:27] person. Amen. God has called each
[44:31] person. And a calling is nothing more
[44:34] than a bid, an invitation,
[44:38] uh something that God, if God has bidden
[44:40] you, as God has invited you to come,
[44:43] that is a calling. That is what or that
[44:46] is what it means to be called. Amen.
[44:49] That's not the calling itself. That is
[44:52] to be called is to actually receive an
[44:55] invitation.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; The calling doesn't come. Remember when
[44:59] we talked about the children of Israel?
[45:01] We know the children of Israel were
[45:03] called because they were God's people.
[45:05] But we also realize as they were called,
[45:08] they uh they responded to that
[45:10] invitation, but their calling wasn't
[45:13] made clear until afterwards.
[45:16] Amen. Kind of follows the same line of
[45:19] of receiving the Holy Spirit. You you
[45:22] receive the Holy Spirit after you have
[45:24] you received since you believe after you
[45:27] believe. The calling, the invitation
[45:29] goes out. Amen. And we know that many
[45:32] are called, but few are chosen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; So the invitation goes out to many, but
[45:39] the but the the choosing is God's
[45:42] choosing.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The picking out.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; People will respond to an invitation,
[45:47] but God's the one that picks out. God's
[45:49] the one that chooses.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; So it's it's God that's the one that
[45:55] that does this work. So as we are called
[45:58] to everyone to each one as the Lord has
[46:00] called each one. Amen. So let him walk.
[46:06] Amen. Walk. That that that
[46:10] gives an indication of an action.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; It gives a an invoca an indication of
[46:17] life. Amen. of living, of occupying,
[46:22] of being busy, of being about the
[46:25] father's business. To walk means that
[46:28] you are actually doing something. Amen.
[46:31] You're you're putting you're putting
[46:33] feet to the to the faith. You're putting
[46:36] steps to your testimony. You're doing
[46:38] something about it. Yes.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And when God calls you as as his call
[46:43] is, you receive that invitation. He
[46:46] says, "So let him walk. So let him abide
[46:50] in that. So let him live in that. So let
[46:53] him be occupied in that position, in
[46:56] that place. Let it be your life. Don't
[46:59] let it just be a maybe a one-time thing
[47:02] or something, but live in that. Live in
[47:05] what God's called you to do. Be the one
[47:07] that God has called you to be."
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Because it's a life. Amen. It's a life.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let every man, let
[47:15] every po person, let each one as it
[47:17] says, amen, live in that call.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; And so ordain I in all churches.
[47:26] Is any man called being circumcised?
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any
[47:33] man called in uncircumcision? Let him
[47:36] not be circumcised. And now we kind of
[47:38] touched on that a little bit last week,
[47:40] but to me, this basically means that if
[47:43] God's called you to do something, do it,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what somebody else has
[47:48] said. It doesn't matter what somebody
[47:50] else has tried to talk you into. It
[47:52] doesn't matter what somebody else has
[47:54] done. Oh, you're uncircumcised. Well,
[47:56] how could you be, you know, that that's
[47:58] horrible? Or you're you're circumcised.
[48:00] Why would you be circumcised? Well,
[48:02] Paul's just saying neither one matters.
[48:05] Just do what God told you to do. Be the
[48:08] person God has called you to be because
[48:11] that's all that really matters in the
[48:13] end.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. There there's not a
[48:16] grading system that we have
[48:20] of one another. God is the one that
[48:22] judges us.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; God is the one that determines that. Not
[48:26] not one another. Amen. I know that that
[48:29] the Bible says to judge one another, but
[48:31] not in the capacity of realizing that
[48:34] we've been in God's will. I don't want
[48:36] to be to the point, let me say it this
[48:38] way, to the point that I have no desire
[48:41] to be in your will.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; I don't I I have no desire to be what
[48:48] you want me to be.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; My only desire is to be what God wants
[48:54] me to be.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. I only want to do what God has
[48:57] called me to do.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And if God's called me to do it, then
[49:01] God will bless it. If I walk in it, God
[49:04] will bless it. Amen. Regardless of
[49:07] whether we got uh a church full or
[49:10] whether we've got a half a dozen,
[49:12] doesn't matter. That's what God whatever
[49:14] God's calling is. Amen. He said uh in
[49:18] that little parable, if you're you're
[49:20] you're faithful to the little things,
[49:22] then he'll bless you in the bigger
[49:23] things. But that doesn't even really
[49:26] matter
[49:27] &gt;&gt; because I just want to do what he wants
[49:29] me to do. Whatever that is,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's what that calling,
[49:34] that's what that position that God is
[49:36] calling wants us to do is to be in the
[49:39] place that he wants us to be.
[49:41] Circumcision, fine. Unircumcision, fine.
[49:45] Amen. I I have no thing with that. I
[49:48] know years ago um even brother Green I
[49:52] heard to a point it was before I really
[49:54] even knew brother Green knew of him but
[49:57] uh to know him that there was that time
[50:00] back in the what maybe 80s late 80s 90s
[50:03] something like that where uh there was a
[50:06] big push through the message that if you
[50:09] if you wanted to be a minister in this
[50:11] message you couldn't have facial hair.
[50:13] Amen. Did you remember that brother
[50:15] Dennis? Did that come brother? I I heard
[50:17] now I didn't hear him. I didn't hear him
[50:19] personally, but I heard brother Green
[50:21] used to propagate that. Amen. Good or
[50:24] bad. I mean, I know I I know people
[50:26] today that are still the same way. I
[50:29] know a brother I know a brother pastor
[50:31] church. He won't let a man come if he's
[50:33] got facial hair. He won't let him come
[50:34] preach. Amen. No matter who he is.
[50:38] And And it And it swept through. And I I
[50:42] I understand their point of view, but
[50:47] who am who am I to I I I can't find
[50:50] anywhere that says that if you do, you
[50:52] can't preach.
[50:53] I've never found it. Amen. U I I I
[50:59] haven't found a quote. Brother Random
[51:01] talked about it. Brother Ram talked
[51:02] about clean shaping. But uh to me,
[51:05] Dennis and Danny are both clean shaped.
[51:08] They're not they're because they're
[51:10] trimmed and look nice and not all
[51:12] scraggly and whatever. But then brother
[51:13] Brandham turns around and talks about
[51:15] being scraggly himself or John the
[51:17] Baptist coming out all scraggly and I
[51:19] mean you know uh you being what God told
[51:23] you to be.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's all that matters to
[51:27] me. I've had brothers come and preach
[51:28] for me beard down to here
[51:31] cuz I it to me when I even I've heard
[51:34] and people talk about that and brothers
[51:35] and all I have fellowship with them and
[51:37] I love them but you know um and I've
[51:40] always been this way but mainly because
[51:42] my wife hates facial hair so not on me.
[51:47] Let's put it that way. So be careful
[51:49] these hate Dennis and Danny but uh on
[51:52] me. Uh, so I don't I don't usually I
[51:57] have never grown anything more than a
[51:59] couple weeks because I know she doesn't
[52:00] like it and I I I don't care to have it
[52:04] or not have it. So I like I defer to
[52:06] her. If she doesn't like it, then it
[52:07] gets shaped. But I don't do it for any
[52:10] other reason. So when I was uh uh going
[52:13] around the ranks and people was talking
[52:15] about this and this was like a big deal,
[52:17] I I to me in my spirit, I never I never
[52:19] I never understood there never was
[52:21] something that was uh a thing that I
[52:24] felt like, well, brother, if you're
[52:26] going to preach here, you better shave
[52:28] that face.
[52:31] I I don't I I just was I never saw that.
[52:34] I never could believe that. I thought,
[52:35] if you want to have a beard, I have a
[52:36] beard. I don't care. Amen. You're
[52:38] welcome to come on. you preaching this
[52:40] gospel, you can come preach.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; That's all that mattered to me. But you
[52:45] see what people get. You mean I even
[52:48] remember u uh I'm not going to call
[52:50] names, but uh a visiting minister went
[52:53] to another church and the the the son of
[52:57] the pastor was talking about becoming a
[53:00] minister and getting into the ministry.
[53:01] And that and that brother, that visiting
[53:03] minister told him said, "Well, if you're
[53:05] going to preach, you better shave that
[53:06] face.
[53:10] Okay,
[53:11] being circumcised, who cares?
[53:13] Uncircumcised, who cares? I mean, you
[53:16] know, it just boils down to a lot of
[53:19] times people's feelings and beliefs and
[53:21] thoughts and uh as long as you're
[53:24] preaching the gospel and God's called
[53:26] you and ordained you and you're
[53:27] ministering that truth of that gospel,
[53:30] that that's all I care about. That's all
[53:32] that ma to me. I can see that that's
[53:35] that's all that matters.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I believe brother Green
[53:39] changed that obviously later in his
[53:41] life. That was that was 30 plus years
[53:44] ago. So
[53:46] a lot of ch things change since then.
[53:48] And I just use that as analogy for for
[53:51] people that say, "Well, you know, if
[53:53] you're uncircumcised, you're not coming
[53:55] here.
[53:56] If you're circumcised, you're not coming
[53:58] here." Paul's saying, "Who cares? Just
[54:01] do what God told you to do."
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Be the person God's called you to be.
[54:05] That's all that matters. Amen. Because
[54:08] you get down to the next verse, he says,
[54:11] "Circumcision is nothing and
[54:13] uncircumcision is nothing to me." Again,
[54:16] can we go back to my analogy? The facial
[54:18] hair is nothing. The no facial hair is
[54:21] nothing to me. Doesn't matter. Amen. It
[54:25] is nothing. But the keeping of the
[54:29] commandments of God.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That matters.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That matters. keeping
[54:36] the commandments of the Lord. That
[54:39] matters. Making sure that you're living
[54:42] by the word, living by his spirit,
[54:45] living by the dictates that God has put
[54:47] in your life. And that's what matters.
[54:49] Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Is being and doing what God has called
[54:51] you to do.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Being. Amen. Let every man now let
[54:55] everyone each one
[54:59] as the as the scripture says here let
[55:01] every man abide praise the Lord abide in
[55:06] the same calling wherewith he was called
[55:09] that abide means to remain
[55:12] &gt;&gt; to remain in that calling. Amen.
[55:14] Sometimes it's not always in the same
[55:17] place. Uh you know I I've pastored in
[55:20] Florida. I've pastored in Tucson. I've
[55:23] pastored in Xolo. I've been associate
[55:25] pastor in North Carolina. I've been
[55:27] associate pastor brother Green. I'm uh
[55:30] there's things that the Lord has uh done
[55:33] in life. It doesn't mean that uh which
[55:36] when I was young, I used to think, you
[55:38] know, I I would go grow up, I get a job,
[55:42] and I'll have that job the rest of my
[55:43] life. I'll go and have a church and I'll
[55:46] have that church the rest of my life.
[55:48] I'll have this this just this just this
[55:50] just this just this just this just this
[55:50] just this just this just this just this
[55:50] just this will be all that it is all
[55:52] that it is and it's been it's there
[55:54] hasn't been anything further from the
[55:56] truth.
[55:58] I haven't had a ton of jobs, but uh the
[56:00] one job I thought I was going to be at
[56:02] till I retired uh I was there 10 years,
[56:06] which I guess is a long time by today's
[56:08] standards, but I was there 10 years. And
[56:09] but when God called me to leave, Amen.
[56:12] And I had a lot of people fuss at me
[56:15] because it was in the beauty and barber
[56:17] supply industry. Amen. I was a purchaser
[56:20] of beauty and barber supply products.
[56:22] Amen. that supplied beauty and barber
[56:25] supply uh beauty and barber shops around
[56:27] the that area, that region. And I had
[56:30] people criticize me for it and and say,
[56:33] "You shouldn't do that. You you
[56:35] shouldn't be working for a company like
[56:36] that." I said, "How do you know what the
[56:39] company you're working for stands for?"
[56:40] Right?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Do you really know? I even had a brother
[56:43] come and criticize me. I said, "What do
[56:45] you do?" He said, "He delivers uh he
[56:47] drives a delivery truck where he
[56:49] delivers chips and stuff." I said, "Oh,
[56:51] okay. Well, what kind? He said, "Well,
[56:53] they have these kind of chips and these
[56:55] kind of chips." I said, "Do you realize
[56:57] that that these chips are owned by
[56:58] Annheiser Bush?
[57:01] You're distributing chips for a for a
[57:04] beer company for an alcohol? You're
[57:06] working for an alcohol? How dare you?
[57:09] You should not do that. You should quit
[57:11] immediately."
[57:13] And it was a decent paying job. He
[57:14] wasn't about to quit. And I told him, I
[57:16] said, "Don't don't criticize me till you
[57:19] know."
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't know. God gave me
[57:22] this job.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; God sent me from Tucson to Charlotte
[57:26] with this job and God gave me this job.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; That I should I should not had that job.
[57:33] That's just the absolute truth. There's
[57:35] no reason for me to have had that job.
[57:37] Amen. I used to work there in the
[57:39] warehouse. I was a warehouse picker. I
[57:42] picked stuff and for to ship. Amen. I
[57:45] moved to Tucson. go back a year later
[57:47] and all of a sudden I'm next in line for
[57:49] the purchaser who's the he's about to
[57:52] retire.
[57:54] There was no reason for me to have that
[57:56] job. I had no qualifications.
[57:59] I had no schooling. I'd never been to
[58:02] college. I walked into Puma Community
[58:05] College one time and walked out.
[58:08] That's as close as I've come to getting
[58:10] a college education. I had no qualific.
[58:14] And he hired me, paid me a lot of money.
[58:17] hire me for this position. I should not
[58:19] have had that job. I told people God
[58:21] gave me this job.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; When God tells me to leave, I will
[58:25] leave.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; And when God told me to move to Florida
[58:29] and start that church, you know what I
[58:31] did? I left.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; It's that easy.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; God says do it, I do it. When God says
[58:39] don't, I don't. When God says go, I go.
[58:42] When God says come, I come. I do what
[58:45] he's whatever he leads me to do. And he
[58:47] gave me that job and he blessed me in
[58:49] that job until he told me it was time to
[58:51] leave.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And when it was time to leave, I left.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; I gave the man, the president of the
[58:57] company, uh, that hired me about
[58:59] resignation, he accepted it. Amen. I
[59:02] came and I told the entire uh, uh, uh,
[59:06] sales staff. We had like a hundred
[59:08] hundred salespeople from Richmond,
[59:11] Virginia down into southern Georgia.
[59:15] We had I forgot how many and but this
[59:18] was the regional and I went in and I
[59:20] told them that I was retired, that I was
[59:23] uh quitting, that I was resigning, that
[59:25] I was starting a church in Florida and
[59:27] all this. And those people when I when I
[59:29] finished talking for just a couple of
[59:31] minutes, I started walk out the door,
[59:33] they gave me a standing ovation.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] The entire sales staff gave me a
[59:38] standing ovation.
[59:40] I walked out and I walked out. I said,
[59:41] "Lord, they're not standing for me.
[59:43] They're standing for you."
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's that's all that any
[59:47] of us are.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; We deserve no human accolades. It's what
[59:51] God does for us.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Any if there's anything good, it's
[59:54] attributed to him.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Anything that's blessing is attributed
[59:58] to him. It's all him, not us.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's absolute truth. Amen.
[1:00:04] And I got down to Florida and the
[1:00:06] believe the message believer smacked me
[1:00:08] in the head and says, "What in the world
[1:00:09] are you doing here? You shouldn't be
[1:00:11] here. You should blah blah blah do this
[1:00:13] and do that and if you come here and do
[1:00:14] this." I actually had a pastor that told
[1:00:17] me, he said, "All right, well, if you if
[1:00:18] you do this and we'll preach you and
[1:00:21] stuff like this," I said, "God did
[1:00:22] that's not what God called told me to
[1:00:24] do."
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; God didn't tell me to come and go to
[1:00:27] your church and and for you to preach
[1:00:29] me.
[1:00:31] This is what God told me to do. this is
[1:00:33] what I'm going to do. And by God's
[1:00:35] grace, that's what I did. It wasn't
[1:00:37] easy. Amen. But God blessed it.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; God never put you in the easiest place,
[1:00:44] but he put you in a place that he's
[1:00:46] called for you and he's going to bless
[1:00:47] you there. That's what matters is being
[1:00:50] blessed in where God bless blesses you
[1:00:52] and abide there. But see, notice the
[1:00:56] calling never changed. Even though the
[1:00:59] place changed, even though the
[1:01:01] situations changed, the calling never
[1:01:04] changed. Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Never changed. God called me to be a
[1:01:08] ministry. He called me to be a pastor.
[1:01:11] And that's never changed. And I've done
[1:01:13] my best by God's grace to abide in that
[1:01:15] call,
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; to live in that call, to remain in that
[1:01:19] call, to not depart from that call.
[1:01:23] Whether it's capacity of a a pastor or
[1:01:26] associate pastor, whatever it is, I've
[1:01:28] tried my best. Said what God's told me
[1:01:30] to do, that's what you do.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Abide there. Live there. Amen. Don't
[1:01:37] Well, you know, that was good for a
[1:01:39] while, but I think I'll do this now.
[1:01:40] Well, that was that was okay, but I
[1:01:42] think I'll go over and dabble in this.
[1:01:44] And, you know, I I think I'll uh you
[1:01:47] know, whatever it is.
[1:01:50] and and and you know try to be something
[1:01:54] you're not.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bless you
[1:02:03] no matter how hard you try to be
[1:02:06] something you're not.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; If you belong to God,
[1:02:12] God is going to make the circumstances
[1:02:14] work in your life to put you in the
[1:02:16] place where you're supposed to be.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and after all the thing that
[1:02:22] happened uh and when brother Green
[1:02:24] passed away and all uh I come to
[1:02:26] realization
[1:02:28] uh what what God was doing where where
[1:02:32] God wants you to be and and that's the
[1:02:35] only thing that matters.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; When God told me to start the church,
[1:02:43] I didn't ask him how many people are
[1:02:45] coming.
[1:02:46] I didn't care. wasn't my concern.
[1:02:51] If God calls you, you do it.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; And the rest, whatever God has to come,
[1:02:56] that's fine. He does that part. That's
[1:02:59] not up to me. That's God's job. But all
[1:03:02] I know to do is to try to abide in that
[1:03:05] call. Live in that call. Be that one
[1:03:08] that God has called me to be. Amen. To
[1:03:12] abide. And that's what the abide means
[1:03:14] to stay there.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Remain there. Be steadfast in that
[1:03:18] calling. Amen. Don't waver in it. Let
[1:03:20] every man abide in the same calling
[1:03:23] wherein he was called. Art thou 21st
[1:03:26] verse now. Art thou being called? Art
[1:03:29] thou called being a servant, care not
[1:03:31] for it. But if thou mayest be uh be made
[1:03:35] free, use it rather because God will
[1:03:38] bless you in it. For uh for he that is
[1:03:42] called in the Lord, being a servant, is
[1:03:45] the Lord's free man. Likewise also, he
[1:03:47] that is called, being free, is Christ's
[1:03:50] servant. Ye are bought with a price, be
[1:03:54] not ye the servants of men, because we
[1:03:56] belong to God.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Brethren, let every man wherein he is
[1:04:00] called
[1:04:02] uh therein abide with co wi with God.
[1:04:07] That call that calling. Now the calling
[1:04:11] is actually something different from the
[1:04:14] call. Being called is just an
[1:04:17] invitation. But your calling is your
[1:04:20] vocation. It is what God the position
[1:04:24] the placement the adoption where God
[1:04:27] wants you to be. What part of the body
[1:04:30] are you going to play? You're invited to
[1:04:33] become a part of the body. Yes, that's a
[1:04:35] call. Amen. But your calling is what
[1:04:38] part, what position, what placement are
[1:04:41] you going to do? What part of the body
[1:04:44] are you going to be?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's sad today. It seems like
[1:04:50] that and and cons can sort of understand
[1:04:53] why
[1:04:54] uh and I've heard many ministers talk
[1:04:57] about how disarray the bride is. I've
[1:05:01] never agreed with that. um uh to the
[1:05:05] point that brother Brandon would talk
[1:05:06] about, but you know, for people to say
[1:05:08] that the the bride was in such disarray,
[1:05:12] I said the message people may be in
[1:05:15] disarray, but God's bride is not.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Uh there's a difference in God's bride
[1:05:21] and the people that are in this message,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Just because you're in this message
[1:05:26] doesn't mean that you're bride.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And just because you're not in this
[1:05:29] message doesn't mean you're bride or not
[1:05:31] bride. Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Uh if you're in this message, uh yeah,
[1:05:37] there there there there can be a mess.
[1:05:41] It can look like a mess.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times you look and say,
[1:05:45] well, you can kind of understand, I
[1:05:47] mean, how is how is the leoty ever going
[1:05:50] to get in its position unless the
[1:05:52] leadership's in its position? Right.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; The leadership's got to be in its
[1:05:57] position first before the leoty can ever
[1:05:59] get in their position because they're
[1:06:01] the ones in the leadership position.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; You think how and they talk about how
[1:06:07] that uh people should be in their uh
[1:06:10] their position and and make sure you
[1:06:13] come to church and pay your ti and all
[1:06:14] that. And that's all true and right and
[1:06:16] good. But how is h how do you bring that
[1:06:20] across in a place where you're not even
[1:06:23] where where the where the leadership's
[1:06:25] not even in its position?
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; If the leadership's not properly
[1:06:29] positioned, how are the people going to
[1:06:31] be
[1:06:33] the people in this message are going to
[1:06:35] be in the position God's called them to
[1:06:38] be in?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Because that's God's calling, not man's
[1:06:41] calling.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. man's calling would say you you
[1:06:45] you come here and you do this. But God's
[1:06:48] calling is is different. And and when we
[1:06:52] do what God calls us to do, then we're
[1:06:54] we're where we're supposed to be
[1:06:56] regardless of what any man or anybody or
[1:06:59] any woman or whatever says. Uh we want
[1:07:03] to be in that position. Amen. So, how is
[1:07:06] it that uh a a church can be in its
[1:07:10] position the way it should be if the the
[1:07:13] person in leadership is not?
[1:07:16] Amen. It's got to be it. It has to be
[1:07:19] wholly in its position for it to work
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; for them to all to abide in the calling
[1:07:24] God's called them.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a lot of times where
[1:07:30] politics comes in. People
[1:07:33] get so much into politics and things
[1:07:35] that uh uh it it throws everything out
[1:07:40] of cater.
[1:07:43] Let me read this to you
[1:07:48] influence.
[1:07:50] Brother Vam says, "I was reading the
[1:07:52] history of Martin Luther's history said
[1:07:54] it wasn't so much of a mystery that
[1:07:56] Martin Luther could protest the Catholic
[1:07:58] Church and get by with it, but that but
[1:08:00] to hold his head above all the
[1:08:02] fanaticism that followed his message,
[1:08:04] his revival." That's right. Hold
[1:08:07] yourself, listen,
[1:08:09] hold yourself clean and clear to your
[1:08:12] calling. Remember calling, calling is
[1:08:15] vocation.
[1:08:17] Hold yourself clean and clear. Amen.
[1:08:21] Stay with God's word and don't move for
[1:08:24] nothing.
[1:08:27] Abide.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; And stay abide in your calling. If he'd
[1:08:33] give you a job out there as a farmer,
[1:08:35] farm good.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you at it. And pay your tithes
[1:08:40] and whatever it is, your offerings to
[1:08:42] help the ministry go on.
[1:08:45] If he made a mechanic out of you and
[1:08:48] blessed you in that work, stay with it
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; and thank him for it. See, you just
[1:08:54] abide where God calls you. Now, see, I
[1:08:58] mentioned that
[1:09:00] this is the kind of thing that helps me
[1:09:02] a so much because I I I mentioned about
[1:09:07] that job I had in North Carolina and was
[1:09:10] purchasing manager. I think the job that
[1:09:13] I'm in right now is the same way.
[1:09:15] And I I had I there was no reasoning why
[1:09:18] I should be in this position. There's no
[1:09:20] reason why I had this job. There's no
[1:09:23] logical explanation as to why an old man
[1:09:27] like me would be doing a young man's job
[1:09:29] in this position and uh and and doing
[1:09:32] this and working. There's just no
[1:09:33] reason. There's I I I have had so little
[1:09:39] uh labor experience that it it would
[1:09:44] defy logic to hire me in a position like
[1:09:48] that. I worked a couple years with
[1:09:50] brother Roger helped helped a lot. I
[1:09:52] mean, I learned things that he showed
[1:09:54] me. Not near what I do now, but I
[1:09:57] learned some things when he showed me.
[1:09:59] But there's no reason to be in this
[1:10:00] position. Amen. But I know one thing for
[1:10:04] a fact. God gave me this job.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; God put Julie in the right place at the
[1:10:09] right time. Put Tom, who's my upper
[1:10:11] upper boss, in the right place the right
[1:10:13] time and brought all this together. Why?
[1:10:14] I don't know. That's God God did it.
[1:10:17] That's all I know. I God gave me this
[1:10:19] job. So when I look at this and I know
[1:10:23] what God has done, I look and I say,
[1:10:25] "God bless you at it." See, he said,
[1:10:26] "Pay your tithes, whatever it is,
[1:10:28] offerings, ministry." He said, "If he's
[1:10:30] made you a ca a mechanic out of you and
[1:10:34] bless you at that work, stay right with
[1:10:36] it and thank him for it."
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I try, although it gets
[1:10:41] very difficult sometimes, not to
[1:10:43] complain about the heat and humidity and
[1:10:46] things like that. Uh the elements, it
[1:10:50] gets rough sometimes. But I know that
[1:10:52] God's called me to that job. I know he
[1:10:55] has. So when when I look at this and I
[1:10:57] say
[1:10:59] and and he says, "God bless you in that
[1:11:01] work. Stay with it.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Thank him for it." So thank you, Lord.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You just abide where
[1:11:15] God's called you. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:11:18] I'm thankful for that. For that's
[1:11:21] because that's what God It's It makes no
[1:11:23] sense. I even I've even talked to other
[1:11:26] guys on other teams and on our team and
[1:11:29] they give their story of how they came
[1:11:31] to work at Mr. and how they came to do
[1:11:33] this job and my Tom grilled them and
[1:11:38] made them turn in applications and and
[1:11:41] resumes and had to find out what they
[1:11:44] did and what their background was and
[1:11:46] all this stuff. They they had to meet
[1:11:49] all these qualifications to for him to
[1:11:51] even consider them. You know what he
[1:11:54] asked me? He said, "When can you start?"
[1:12:01] We're even walking through the tunnel
[1:12:03] there. We went in Sire. We're going to
[1:12:05] the tunnel. He said, "Yeah, we weld all
[1:12:06] this together." I said, "I've never
[1:12:08] welded in my life. Don't know anything
[1:12:09] about." He said, "Don't worry about it.
[1:12:10] We'll teach you."
[1:12:13] I even told him, "I haven't done this. I
[1:12:15] don't know how to do that. I've never
[1:12:16] done that. I didn't know you could do
[1:12:18] that." They've got tools to do that. I
[1:12:21] have no idea. don't matter. When can you
[1:12:24] start?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And all these other guys, I said, they
[1:12:28] tell me what they had to go through. He
[1:12:30] didn't even ask for a resume. He didn't
[1:12:32] ask for an application. He didn't ask
[1:12:33] for none of that.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; He basically just said, "We do this,
[1:12:37] this, this, this, and this. He wants the
[1:12:38] job. This is what it pays." I'm like,
[1:12:42] "What?"
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; No logical reason, saints.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when when God does it, a lot
[1:12:51] of times it defies logic.
[1:12:54] But when you but that's when you you
[1:12:56] know it's God.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know it's God. God's doing it.
[1:13:01] You could try to try to press yourself
[1:13:03] into something and push yourself into
[1:13:05] something and force something to happen,
[1:13:07] but when God's doing it, it's just
[1:13:09] there.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; God just brings everything together and
[1:13:12] makes it work. It just dubtales and it's
[1:13:14] just beautiful, perfect. It works the
[1:13:16] way it's supposed to. That's God. That's
[1:13:19] when God does it. Amen. Stay with it. He
[1:13:23] said, "Stay with it. Thank him for it.
[1:13:26] Just abide where God's called you."
[1:13:29] Praise the Lord. Spirit of truth. Now,
[1:13:32] 1963,
[1:13:35] he said, "I would rather
[1:13:38] uh he says when?" Let's see. He said, "I
[1:13:39] would rather
[1:13:42] I would rather go and have a church with
[1:13:44] 50 people in it in the will of God than
[1:13:48] to go have 5,000
[1:13:50] out of the will of God."
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Me, too.
[1:13:58] I'd rather have 50 in the will of God
[1:14:00] than 5,000 out of the will of God. Sure.
[1:14:03] God can do more with a man in his will
[1:14:06] in one hour than he could do with a man
[1:14:10] out of his will in 50 years.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could do more with a man
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; in one hour in the will of God than he
[1:14:23] can do with a man out of the will of God
[1:14:25] in 50 years.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful things.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he is stumbling and
[1:14:33] staggering, shoots like he says in the
[1:14:36] dark. But when a man is really in the
[1:14:38] will of God and knows his calling, he
[1:14:41] abides there. He should abide there,
[1:14:45] stay there, live there, be there. Like I
[1:14:49] said, God's called some apostles,
[1:14:52] prophets, teachers, evangelists,
[1:14:53] pastors. He's called some that speak in
[1:14:55] tongues, that prophesy, that have gifts
[1:14:57] of government, helps, healings. Uh he he
[1:15:02] has farmers, he has housewives, he has
[1:15:04] builders, he has mechanics, he has
[1:15:06] office people, he has people that work
[1:15:09] with their hands, people that work with
[1:15:10] their minds. He has he has people that
[1:15:13] are wealthy and people that live from
[1:15:15] paycheck to paycheck, but they're never
[1:15:18] forsaken.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Their seed never begging bread because
[1:15:22] God always provides.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; It may be laboring out in the hot sun.
[1:15:26] It may be in a beautiful airond
[1:15:30] conditioned office building, but don't
[1:15:32] despise where God's put you.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Don't despise where God's placed you.
[1:15:38] Amen. Let God show you. When a man is
[1:15:40] really in the will of God and knows his
[1:15:43] calling, stay there.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Abide there. Now, is it going to be
[1:15:46] forever?
[1:15:48] No. Not Not likely. I mean, I I don't
[1:15:51] personally think I as far as my job, I
[1:15:54] don't think I could personally do this
[1:15:55] job for a whole lot longer. Uh it's very
[1:15:58] physically taxing, but uh but whatever
[1:16:00] God gives strength, I said, Lord,
[1:16:01] whatever you give strength to do, that's
[1:16:03] what that that that's what we do.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You give grace, you give strength,
[1:16:08] and you show and uh when God makes it
[1:16:11] work, then it works.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Don't ever We should
[1:16:16] never try to expect more out of other
[1:16:20] people than we're willing to give
[1:16:21] ourselves.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Always seem to want others to do other
[1:16:27] things and not not carry our load.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you expect others to do it, you
[1:16:35] should be willing to do it as well.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go over to Ephesians now.
[1:16:40] I'm gonna close here in just a minute.
[1:16:42] Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:16:54] Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 4,
[1:16:56] let's begin reading verse one.
[1:16:59] Ephesians 4:1. I therefore the prison of
[1:17:03] the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy
[1:17:07] of the vocation wherewith ye are called.
[1:17:09] Work worth walk worthy. So it's not just
[1:17:13] the walk, just the living, just the
[1:17:16] being occupying.
[1:17:18] It's the walk worthy, amen, of the
[1:17:22] vocation wherewith God has called you.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Faithful to the post with all loneliness
[1:17:30] and meekness,
[1:17:31] with long suffering, forbearing one
[1:17:34] another in love,
[1:17:37] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:17:40] spirit in the bond of peace. That sounds
[1:17:42] like a lot of work.
[1:17:44] Amen. Did you hear these words?
[1:17:46] Loneliness,
[1:17:48] meekness,
[1:17:50] longsuffering. That even has suffer in
[1:17:53] it.
[1:17:55] The root of the word of this is suffer.
[1:17:59] Longsuffering.
[1:18:00] Forbearing
[1:18:02] one another in love. Endeavoring.
[1:18:06] And that sounds like a lot of work.
[1:18:10] It is to keep the unity of the spirit in
[1:18:14] the bond of peace.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; A lot of work but we keep it there. Uh
[1:18:19] there is one body and one spirit even as
[1:18:23] you are called in one hope of your
[1:18:26] calling. Called in one hope of your
[1:18:28] calling. Now listen to this. I'm going
[1:18:29] close
[1:18:32] uh influence again. And he said, "And we
[1:18:33] find we find that uh we find that as
[1:18:37] long as this king felt that way, God
[1:18:40] blessed him." Now, I think he's gone
[1:18:42] back to Uzziah again. Uh this quote, I'm
[1:18:45] trying to remember. I believe he's
[1:18:46] talking about Uzziah again. When he felt
[1:18:49] that way, God blessed him.
[1:18:52] The scripture says, "As long as Usiah
[1:18:55] sought the Lord, God made him to
[1:18:57] prosper."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; God blessed him. But when he got to a
[1:19:01] place that he wanted to not abide in his
[1:19:04] own calling, he wanted to take the
[1:19:07] calling of something else. And he
[1:19:09] thought because that God had blessed him
[1:19:12] that it was all right that he could do
[1:19:14] that. But just because God has blessed
[1:19:17] you one place, which as we have found
[1:19:20] out, if God is blessing you in that
[1:19:24] place is your calling, abide there.
[1:19:27] Why do you want to go do something else?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; If you get the thought, well, God
[1:19:32] blesses me here, he'll bless me over
[1:19:34] here, too. No, not necessarily.
[1:19:37] Amen. Even if you're a child of God, God
[1:19:40] doesn't necessarily going to bless you
[1:19:42] over here when you're not supposed to be
[1:19:45] in that position. He'll bless you where
[1:19:47] you're supposed to be, but that doesn't
[1:19:49] mean he's going to bless you in a place
[1:19:51] that you try to take over that you're
[1:19:53] not supposed to be.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; And that's what Uzziah did. He was the
[1:19:57] king and God blessed him and he restored
[1:20:00] the kingdom back and God blessed Uzziah
[1:20:03] continually. But when he decided that he
[1:20:05] wanted to take the office of a priest,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; God didn't bless that.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he thought, I'm the king. God
[1:20:14] blesses me. I can go do this because
[1:20:17] God's blessings are with me.
[1:20:20] Not when you're doing something you're
[1:20:22] not called to do.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he doesn't he didn't bless him
[1:20:28] in the position that he was not called
[1:20:30] to be in. That's the priest's office,
[1:20:32] not his. He was called to be the king
[1:20:35] and God blessed him as king. He blessed
[1:20:37] the priest as priest. But if the priest
[1:20:39] tried to be king, he wasn't blessed.
[1:20:42] Josiah tried to take the place of
[1:20:43] priest, he wasn't blessed.
[1:20:46] You see what happened to him too?
[1:20:49] He said, "Now look,"
[1:20:53] he wanted to take call him something
[1:20:55] else. He thought because that God had
[1:20:58] blessed him that that was all right. He
[1:21:00] could do that. But how sadly we we he
[1:21:03] said, Brother Bram said, we make them
[1:21:05] mistakes.
[1:21:07] Oh, how bad. You absolutely be honest.
[1:21:10] You mustn't do nothing unless God has
[1:21:13] directed you to do it.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] and proves it and vindicates it and you
[1:21:19] know that it is God that's done it.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; It's all him. You know he's done it.
[1:21:27] Usually man usually man of God God has
[1:21:31] uh God has to run him down and catch the
[1:21:33] real man of God.
[1:21:35] It ain't those guys that wants a whole
[1:21:37] lot of something to do a whole lot uh
[1:21:40] with. uh you'd hardly tell what they uh
[1:21:43] would do with if they received it. Amen.
[1:21:46] In other words, uh the the true called
[1:21:49] man, God has to make him do it. God has
[1:21:52] to basically force him into that into
[1:21:55] that position into doing that.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, usually if a man's want
[1:22:01] to do it and he's shoving himself in
[1:22:03] that position, he's putting himself in
[1:22:05] that place, he's probably not called to
[1:22:07] do it,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God when God calls, he
[1:22:11] calls him and as brother Brandham said
[1:22:13] here, he basically has to force him to
[1:22:15] do it.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Make all circumstances work to where it
[1:22:19] comes to that place.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You know how much easier it be just to
[1:22:22] set back just I mean it's not this easy
[1:22:25] but uh to not preach, to not minister.
[1:22:30] Amen. I I I've set congregations and I
[1:22:34] I've I've been ley I've been uh
[1:22:37] associate pastor and uh I've sat and
[1:22:40] listened a lot and I've ministered a lot
[1:22:42] and uh you know in preparing and getting
[1:22:46] ready and making sure
[1:22:50] you know that the Lord's going to meet
[1:22:53] you there and uh what is said uh is thus
[1:22:57] sayeth the Lord out of out of the
[1:22:59] scripture out of the
[1:23:01] Uh there's a lot of responsibility.
[1:23:04] Amen. There's a lot to it. Brother
[1:23:06] Dennis has done both done both as well.
[1:23:08] He knows. Amen. It's quite different.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; But God blesses where he wants you to
[1:23:15] be.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where God brings you to. Praise
[1:23:20] God. And and that's when God when God
[1:23:22] does it, then you know that it's right.
[1:23:25] It's he brother. He says here, usually
[1:23:28] has to run a man down and catch the real
[1:23:32] man of God. It ain't those guys that
[1:23:34] wants a whole lot of something to do a
[1:23:36] whole lot with you. You uh uh you'd hard
[1:23:39] to tell what they would do with it if
[1:23:42] they got a hold of it anyway.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times I've come to find out
[1:23:48] that's true. Amen. But God usually has
[1:23:51] to catch his man like Moses and Paul run
[1:23:55] him down. Amen.
[1:23:57] uh to run him down to set uh to get
[1:24:01] glory out of his life, let him become a
[1:24:03] prisoner of the Holy Spirit. Amen. And
[1:24:05] scripturally, we see how that's true.
[1:24:08] Amen. How that God
[1:24:11] brings you into that position.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a child of God, a lot of
[1:24:15] people just do whatever they want and
[1:24:17] however and uh and things. But when God
[1:24:20] when God brings you along and places and
[1:24:23] makes the circumstances and organizes
[1:24:25] everything to put you in a position to
[1:24:27] put you in a place I mean going back to
[1:24:30] this job I have now I think even when
[1:24:32] sister Julie first told me I went over
[1:24:34] to help with your battery I think or a
[1:24:35] truck or something and she said u you
[1:24:38] know u this this man's going to call you
[1:24:41] from mister about a job and I'm like no
[1:24:45] I don't I don't I don't I'm fine with
[1:24:47] brother Roger. I don't want another job.
[1:24:48] I don't I'm not looking to get anything
[1:24:50] else. And she says, "Oh, well, I've
[1:24:52] already told him now." She already told
[1:24:55] him about you. I said, "Well, okay. If
[1:24:56] he calls, I'll listen to him." I wasn't
[1:24:58] expecting anything out of it. I wasn't
[1:25:00] expecting anything to come of it. Uh but
[1:25:03] when God makes everything work and bring
[1:25:04] the circumstances to a place and it's
[1:25:07] there in front of you and you feel led
[1:25:09] of the Lord, you do what God tells you
[1:25:11] to do.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; You you you bring it to that place. If
[1:25:14] you if you try to force yourself and
[1:25:17] make yourself now as a Christian, Amen.
[1:25:19] Not talking about nominal. We're not
[1:25:20] talking about the world. They do
[1:25:22] however, whatever, whenever
[1:25:25] they they're they have their boss. And
[1:25:28] he's not the same as my boss.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Um but when God leads a Christian, when
[1:25:33] God leads his people around, he brings
[1:25:35] it into the place where he where he can
[1:25:38] get the most out of you. What you're
[1:25:40] ordained to do, what God's called you to
[1:25:42] do. As we've said many times, God God
[1:25:46] has placed all of us in positions with
[1:25:49] different family and different uh people
[1:25:51] in our lives and different friends and
[1:25:53] different areas of the country and
[1:25:54] different nationalities and speaking
[1:25:56] different languages and everything that
[1:25:58] God has made in our lives and brought us
[1:26:00] up has has brought us to a place that
[1:26:03] God can use us where he wants us to be.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the fulfilling that God
[1:26:09] now we just need to abide there. Amen.
[1:26:12] Remain there. stay there. Amen. No,
[1:26:15] don't mean it's always going to be in
[1:26:16] this building or in in in in this
[1:26:19] church, whatever God calls. That's uh
[1:26:22] that's where we want to be.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where we want to go. And
[1:26:26] just abide in that place, in that call
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; as God has called you. Amen. Let's stand
[1:26:32] if we could.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; That place that God has put us and
[1:26:46] called us and ordained us.
[1:26:50] Amen. That's that's where we want to be.
[1:26:52] I believe all of us as Christians would
[1:26:54] realize that that's where God blesses us
[1:26:57] the most.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That we realize that's where our lives
[1:27:01] are enhanced is when we're in that place
[1:27:04] where God wants us to be,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; where God has called us. There's nothing
[1:27:09] else like it.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:27:14] Amen.
[1:27:16] Let's sing this course 3:16. We know it
[1:27:19] by heart. Amen. Before we go today,
[1:27:22] Praise the Lord. 3:16. Sanctuary. Lord,
[1:27:26] prepare me to be a sanctuary. I just
[1:27:28] want to be what he wants me to be. Amen.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:33] Lord, prepare
[1:27:35] me
[1:27:37] to be a sanctuary,
[1:27:44] pure and holy,
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:49] tried and true,
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:54] with thanksgiving,
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:59] I'll be a living
[1:28:06] sanctuary
[1:28:10] for you.
[1:28:15] Yes, Lord, prepare
[1:28:18] me
[1:28:20] to be a sanctuary,
[1:28:27] pure and holy.
[1:28:32] tried and true
[1:28:38] with thanksgiving
[1:28:43] I'll be a living
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:49] sanctuary
[1:28:54] for you.
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:59] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, let that be our testimony
[1:29:04] today.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Let that be our portion. Let that be our
[1:29:08] life.
[1:29:10] Let that be our call. Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As God has called each
[1:29:15] one of us to be in that calling, to be
[1:29:17] in that position, to be in that place.
[1:29:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[1:29:22] today.
[1:29:25] Pray something was said to bless and
[1:29:27] strengthen you all today. Amen. And just
[1:29:29] remember the prayer requests that we've
[1:29:31] had the memorial services coming up this
[1:29:34] Saturday for Sister Dorothy and Sister
[1:29:37] Lydia. Again, 11 o'clock Saturday
[1:29:40] morning at 11 o'clock at Tucson
[1:29:42] Tabernacle, Sister Lydia's memorial
[1:29:44] service. Amen. We'll have there. So,
[1:29:47] please remember that in prayer as well.
[1:29:49] Amen. And again, I'll I'll just have to
[1:29:51] get in contact with with each one this
[1:29:54] week to find out to see where I end up
[1:29:57] going next week. One of the uh one of
[1:30:01] the uh minor drawbacks to this not
[1:30:04] knowing.
[1:30:05] I don't I don't like the not knowing
[1:30:08] part, but uh I guess it just comes with
[1:30:11] it. So, but uh Lord knows. So, we'll
[1:30:15] just do all that we can with what the
[1:30:17] Lord gives us. continue to pray with
[1:30:19] that.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, amen. So, just
[1:30:22] remember these prayer requests and uh
[1:30:25] remember the families of those who
[1:30:27] passed and of course, Brother Roger, I
[1:30:29] know, has gone back east. I'm sure he's
[1:30:32] gone back east. I hadn't talked to him,
[1:30:34] like I said, but I'm sure he's back east
[1:30:36] uh with the arrangements. They were
[1:30:38] supposed to, I believe, and turn his
[1:30:40] mother in Jeffersonville.
[1:30:42] She lived in Georgia, so um they have to
[1:30:46] transfer for her body back to
[1:30:49] Jeffersonville.
[1:30:50] So, I'm sure they're back there now. And
[1:30:52] of course, Sister Dorothy's family and
[1:30:54] Sister Lydia's family and u Sister
[1:30:57] Wheeler's family and so many uh it seems
[1:31:00] like been passing lately. So, but Amen.
[1:31:03] But we're all in his hands.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And trust him, his perfect will
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; in all of our lives.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you today. Amen.
[1:31:13] Appreciate each one coming. Anyone have
[1:31:15] anything before we're dismissed?
[1:31:20] Amen. So, God bless you. Bless you.
[1:31:22] Amen. Love you. Appreciate you today.
[1:31:24] Let's just bow our heads. We're
[1:31:26] dismissed in a word of prayer now. Lord
[1:31:28] Jesus, very thankful, Father, of your
[1:31:31] grace and mercy to us. Thank you, Lord,
[1:31:33] for speaking to us, being with us, Lord.
[1:31:36] Thank you, Father, for the service you
[1:31:38] give us.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the word and for
[1:31:41] your life. Thank you for being with us,
[1:31:44] Lord, and helping us through this time,
[1:31:46] God, and letting us see, Lord, that you
[1:31:50] you've called us, Lord. If it's your
[1:31:53] calling, it's your placement, it's what
[1:31:55] you have for us, Lord. It's what we want
[1:31:57] to do. We only want to do what you would
[1:32:00] have us to do, Lord. We only want to be
[1:32:03] what you would have us to be.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So, may you grant that to each of us,
[1:32:07] Lord, for we need it now more than ever,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, in this world that we're living
[1:32:11] in. is we're getting ready to move on,
[1:32:14] Lord, from this mortal reach. We're
[1:32:17] getting ready to press forward, Lord,
[1:32:19] out of this place, God, looking for our
[1:32:21] loved ones to appear at any time, God,
[1:32:24] as we're ready, Lord. We just will we,
[1:32:26] as brother Brandham said, we'll just
[1:32:28] keep planting our potatoes, Lord.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; We'll just keep living our lives and
[1:32:32] being who you have us to be.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may we be everyone found
[1:32:36] faithful at the post of duty, God, when
[1:32:39] you call us.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, bless us now. Keep us safe.
[1:32:43] Keep us healthy and strong in your
[1:32:45] service. Lord, move upon every request
[1:32:47] and need. Help those that are needed
[1:32:49] today and grant traveling mercies, Lord,
[1:32:52] as we commit them to you. Give us grant
[1:32:54] us traveling mercies on our way home
[1:32:56] today and watch over us. We commit
[1:32:58] ourselves to you and ask your blessings
[1:33:00] and all that as we go. In the name of
[1:33:02] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[1:33:08] today.
