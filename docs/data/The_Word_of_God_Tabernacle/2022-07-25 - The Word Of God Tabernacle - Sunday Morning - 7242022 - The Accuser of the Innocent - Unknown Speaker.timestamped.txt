[21:22] upon your prayer requests anyone might

[21:26] bring to your attention i got a text
[21:29] early this morning from uh brother
[21:31] dennis that um
[21:33] with the weather and all it always uh
[21:36] affects
[21:37] uh his joints mostly his back knees but
[21:40] this morning he's had a lot of pain in
[21:43] his back uh with the weather barometric
[21:46] pressure changes and all it really hurts
[21:48] his back desperately bad so uh he's at
[21:51] home streaming today
[21:53] he also asked prayer for his wife leah
[21:56] she had a difficult week with the
[21:57] depression anxiety but
[22:00] said that the lord touched her towards
[22:01] the end of the week so she is doing
[22:03] better but wanted us to pray for her
[22:06] and uh that situation as well just
[22:08] praying for the lord's complete
[22:09] deliverance for both of them amen
[22:11] there's no reason i understand our
[22:13] bodies get old and they react to things
[22:16] and things of nature and but there's no
[22:18] reason a child of god needs to put up
[22:20] with just because the barometric
[22:22] pressure changes it
[22:24] affects or hurts our bodies amen
[22:26] i believe the lord is more than able to
[22:28] touch and heal and take this from our
[22:30] precious brother also uh brother danny
[22:32] woke up this morning and said that he'd
[22:34] woke up with a bad headache and
[22:36] congestion
[22:37] so he asked us to pray for him as well
[22:40] so let's pray for brother danny
[22:42] the pats brother pat also texted me this
[22:44] morning and then had another water pipe
[22:46] broken
[22:47] so their ops is in the ditch this
[22:49] morning so they're not able to be with
[22:50] us so please pray
[22:52] it seems to be happening fairly prolific
[22:55] prolifically with them now that they're
[22:58] they
[22:59] this is the third or fourth time the
[23:00] pipes of their house have burst so
[23:03] um i don't know if it's older and
[23:06] house is older pipes are older so i
[23:08] don't know if that pressure's just
[23:10] finding the weak spots that it can find
[23:12] and it just springs a leak and
[23:15] then they have a mess under the house so
[23:18] uh
[23:19] just pre please pray for them the lord
[23:21] would just help him to be able to get it
[23:23] fixed cheap or
[23:24] himself if
[23:26] able to and
[23:28] and just
[23:29] share up the rest of them so this
[23:30] doesn't happen anymore like i said this
[23:32] three or four times
[23:34] hasn't kept them out of church until
[23:35] today but
[23:37] they've had this happen three or four
[23:38] times over the past few months so i just
[23:40] pray that the lord would just
[23:42] move on that and they won't have this
[23:44] problem anymore
[23:46] uh got a couple requests from sister

[24:12] but sister norma writes that her
[24:14] potassium level was low and the doctor
[24:16] ordered potassium
[24:18] uh and i guess she had been taking it so

[24:25] but sister carol feels the disease is
[24:27] behind her and thanks everyone for

[41:43] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[41:44] pray amen
[41:47] amen
[41:48] revelation chapter 12
[41:51] we're going to begin reading with verse
[41:52] 7
[41:54] and there was a war in heaven
[41:56] michael and his angels fought against
[41:58] the dragon
[41:59] the dragon fought and his angels and
[42:02] prevailed not neither was their place
[42:04] found anymore in heaven
[42:06] and the great dragon was cast out that
[42:08] old serpent called the devil and satan
[42:10] which deceiveth the world the whole
[42:13] world
[42:14] he was cast out into the earth and his
[42:16] angels were cast out with him and i
[42:19] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[42:21] has come salvation and strength and the
[42:24] kingdom of our god and the power of his
[42:26] christ for the accuser of our brother
[42:28] brethren is cast down which accused them
[42:31] before our god day and night
[42:34] they overcame him by the blood of the
[42:35] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[42:38] they loved not their lives to death unto
[42:40] the dead
[42:42] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[42:44] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[42:46] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[42:48] has come down unto you having great
[42:50] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[42:53] but a short time
[42:55] amen you can be seated if you like
[42:58] and we want to take a text of scripture
[43:01] from here if we could
[43:04] amen god bless james good to see you
[43:06] friends amen
[43:09] glad to have you today to have each one
[43:10] of you and we want to take a text
[43:13] there's so many texts from here that uh
[43:15] that i want to take but the lord gave me
[43:17] something a few weeks ago a couple
[43:18] months ago whatever it was
[43:20] that i wanted to bring to you today and
[43:23] uh it has to deal with and i with
[43:26] let's see which
[43:27] it was uh the tenth verse
[43:30] it says the
[43:32] the accuser of our brethren but i wanted
[43:34] to
[43:35] title this because the thought that came
[43:37] on my mind before i actually got the
[43:39] scripture
[43:40] was the accuser of the innocent
[43:43] amen so that's what the title is going
[43:44] to be today this scripture this message
[43:47] is the accuser of the innocent praise
[43:50] the lord now we know that the scripture
[43:52] says here he is the accuser of the
[43:54] brethren but i want us to put into
[43:57] perspective
[43:58] the thought of the innocence of the ones
[44:02] that he is accusing
[44:04] because the thing to get across today
[44:06] and understand is just because there
[44:08] have been accusations laid does not mean
[44:12] that that person is guilty amen amen
[44:14] just because there are accusations
[44:17] doesn't mean that there is guilt because
[44:20] many times and of course by the spirit
[44:22] of the enemy there can be accusations
[44:25] laid about god's children and about
[44:27] god's people that is not true
[44:30] amen that the devil does now obviously
[44:33] there are things that are right and true
[44:36] and things that should not happen and
[44:38] things that should not be happening but
[44:40] the accuser we understand today is not
[44:43] your brother or sister the accuser today
[44:45] is not the church next door the accuser
[44:47] today is the devil
[44:49] there's only one accuser and that's
[44:51] satan now let's go back to the scripture
[44:54] and look here because there's so many
[44:55] little nuances in the description so
[44:57] many things that uh come out then that
[45:00] stick out to us to to see here
[45:02] especially for this last day that we
[45:04] live now seventh verse there was a war
[45:06] in heaven michael and his angels fought
[45:08] against the dragon and the dragon and uh
[45:11] fought in his angels so we recognize
[45:13] here that satan is not alone
[45:16] satan does not do his bidding by himself
[45:19] he does have what we consider her called
[45:22] or scripture calls fallen angels those
[45:25] that were angels of the creation of god
[45:27] from the beginning that to believe the
[45:30] tale of the devil that believed what he
[45:32] said and followed him and his ways so
[45:35] those
[45:36] not only was satan cast down upon the
[45:39] earth at this time but also all of the
[45:41] angels that he had deceived which was
[45:44] the third of the angels in heaven he
[45:46] deceived of all the angels in heaven
[45:48] that were cast out with him so he's not
[45:51] alone in this bidding satan doesn't do
[45:54] this by himself now of course he is the
[45:56] orchestrator of all of it he is the
[45:58] originator of all of it he is the father
[46:01] and the uh
[46:03] and the beginner of this but all that
[46:05] comes forth isn't just
[46:07] him doing it he has angels he has
[46:10] minions he has demonic spirits that are
[46:13] all around the world that are doing the
[46:14] very thing that he wants them to do and
[46:16] that's to bring destruction into your
[46:18] life
[46:19] now a lot of times the accusations that
[46:22] come
[46:23] as we see here this uh this dragon that
[46:26] has his followers uh these accusations
[46:30] that come are many times things that uh
[46:34] that are that are things that are of the
[46:36] guilty
[46:38] uh because
[46:40] an accuser usually has a motive
[46:43] an accuser i'll just say a false accuser
[46:46] because that's what the scripture says
[46:48] about it and that's basically the point
[46:50] i want to get to is false accusation
[46:52] not real accusation but false accusation
[46:55] and false accusation even
[46:58] based on the blood of jesus christ
[47:01] amen amen you know that the blood of
[47:03] jesus christ will have absolved you from
[47:06] something if you repent god's forgiven
[47:08] you and has been washed in the blood
[47:10] it's in god's seeing forgiveness it
[47:11] never is accounted to you anymore
[47:13] justified as though you've never done it
[47:15] in the first place so when the accuser
[47:17] comes to accuse you of something that
[47:19] christ has put in the sea of
[47:20] forgetfulness you are innocent
[47:23] you didn't do it
[47:24] you're not guilty of it he can accuse
[47:26] you of it he can dig up something from
[47:28] your past he can try to make remind you
[47:31] of something or somebody else but the
[47:33] truth of it is if it's under the blood
[47:35] of jesus christ it does not exist in the
[47:37] mind of god so when the accuser comes
[47:40] before god and tries to accuse you of
[47:42] that he looks down and he says that
[47:45] you're guiltless
[47:46] you're innocent you never did it
[47:49] amen that's the beauty of the blood of
[47:51] christ that's the beauty of the accuser
[47:54] of the innocent the innocent now the
[47:57] innocent may be you never did it
[47:59] it never happened the innocence may be
[48:02] that yeah you did do it but the blood of
[48:04] jesus christ annihilates it you've never
[48:06] done it in the first place in the mind
[48:08] of god either way you're innocent
[48:11] you've never done it because the one
[48:13] that we're more concerned about whether
[48:15] uh
[48:16] we are found guilty of it uh or held
[48:19] accountable to us
[48:21] is not necessarily one another but it's
[48:24] to god
[48:25] i want to be innocent in god's eyes
[48:28] that's the that's the first place the
[48:29] first thing that matters to me is being
[48:32] innocent in god's eyes people can accuse
[48:34] me of all kinds of things and friends as
[48:36] you know
[48:37] as a human mortal i've done all kinds of
[48:40] things wrong i've done all kinds of
[48:42] things the devil can accuse me of i've
[48:44] done all kinds of things probably even
[48:45] this week or said or thought things that
[48:48] the devil could accuse me of
[48:50] but when god put them in the sea of
[48:52] forgetfulness they cannot be held
[48:54] against me i didn't do it i'm innocent
[48:56] of it so when satan comes to try to
[48:59] accuse you god looks and says i don't
[49:01] see anything
[49:02] they're guiltless but that's to those
[49:05] who are of course those that are born
[49:07] again
[49:08] filled with the holy spirit the blood of
[49:10] jesus christ that annihilates all the
[49:12] sin the sin doesn't exist is never there
[49:15] to begin with in the mind of god so
[49:17] satan cannot accuse you of it he can go
[49:20] to your brother
[49:21] he could go to your sister he could go
[49:23] to some a neighbor or somebody else and
[49:25] accuse you all day long and that person
[49:27] may remember that you did that thing and
[49:30] they may be able to forgive you but god
[49:31] didn't just forgive you he forgot it
[49:35] doesn't even exist praise the lord now
[49:37] look satan has his angel satan has those
[49:41] demonic spirits that do his bidding
[49:43] around the world today we know that in
[49:46] any willing subject
[49:48] that any one of these spirits can get
[49:51] into
[49:52] that person can become a willing subject
[49:55] and possess to those spirits
[49:57] now sometimes those spirits are extreme
[50:00] like we have when jesus uh walked out in
[50:03] the in the city of
[50:05] uh
[50:06] uh their desiring or nazareth i forget
[50:09] the name of the city and jesus stepped
[50:11] out and this man here is possessed of
[50:13] many devils devils a legion he called it
[50:18] legion which is many multiple
[50:21] and that demon saw jesus come off the
[50:24] boat
[50:25] and he said jesus son of god what have
[50:28] you to do with us
[50:29] you've come to torment us before our
[50:31] time
[50:32] if you're going to cast us out of this
[50:34] man cast us into those swine
[50:37] and jesus just looked at him and said go
[50:41] that's all he said
[50:43] according to i believe it was matthew's
[50:44] account
[50:45] he just jesus said one two-letter word
[50:49] everything else all the all the
[50:52] pronunciation all the the declaration of
[50:55] their their demise and what was going to
[50:57] happen to them and who they were what
[50:59] they were there for they did it
[51:01] themselves
[51:02] they they proclaimed all of this
[51:04] themselves and they just said jesus if
[51:07] you're gonna cast us out cast us into
[51:09] the swan and jesus just said go
[51:11] that's all he had to do one two letter
[51:13] word send all that leads to the devils
[51:16] out of that man and into that swine this
[51:18] wine course ran down the hill into the
[51:20] sea and they all died
[51:22] but spirits don't die
[51:24] the pigs died
[51:26] but the spirits don't die the spirits
[51:28] just find another willing subject to go
[51:30] to
[51:31] amen and those spirits continue to move
[51:33] around the world today
[51:36] finding willing subjects
[51:38] finding those that are unprotected by
[51:40] the blood of christ those that don't
[51:42] have the holy ghost and he finds those
[51:45] people to work in
[51:46] and one of the first and foremost things
[51:49] that those spirits try to do outside of
[51:51] destroy the world which they're doing a
[51:53] very good job at
[51:55] uh outside of that is to accuse those
[51:58] that belong to god
[52:00] that's
[52:01] that's one of their first and foremost
[52:03] jobs is to accuse those that are
[52:06] innocent
[52:07] to lay accusation at the feet of those
[52:10] that belong to god
[52:12] to try to get you to believe the devil's
[52:16] bidding
[52:17] whoever is saying it or whoever is doing
[52:20] it whoever's become that willing subject
[52:22] or subjects
[52:24] willing to do that and to do the bidding
[52:26] of the devil to try to get you to
[52:28] disbelieve and to try to get you to
[52:30] doubt or disbelieve who you are
[52:33] now if you're a christian and you're
[52:35] born again you have the holy ghost then
[52:38] you belong to god
[52:39] you're his
[52:41] you're a godly person you live according
[52:44] to the scripture and that accusation can
[52:46] only be laid based on your humanity it
[52:49] can't be laid based on the fact that
[52:50] you're a godly person that's your holy
[52:52] ghost field that in your very innermost
[52:55] being your desire is to live for god
[52:58] it's not to live in the world now we do
[53:00] things that are wrong we make mistakes
[53:01] we're human again in our humanity and
[53:03] our our brain our spirit uh but but god
[53:06] allows
[53:07] for the understanding of that of course
[53:09] because jesus himself came as our
[53:11] kinsmen redeemer to go through all that
[53:14] we go through
[53:15] there there's not a temptation that we
[53:18] face that he didn't face
[53:19] a pain an egg an agony a
[53:24] loss of family a death
[53:26] jesus faced it all
[53:29] he knows what it's like when you go
[53:30] through all those things so he knows
[53:32] when you in your humanity get to those
[53:35] places he understands that's how he can
[53:37] intercede on our behalf
[53:39] that's how the blood works because he
[53:41] can intercede based on what he knows and
[53:44] what he already went through and of
[53:46] course his
[53:47] infancy because he's god
[53:50] he knows all things he knows the end
[53:52] from the beginning
[53:53] the devil and his angels now these
[53:55] angels
[53:56] these these these demons well we say
[53:59] angels fallen angels these demons
[54:02] find those willing subjects those demons
[54:04] try to find orchestrated of the devil
[54:07] they try to find
[54:09] people that are
[54:10] that are willing subjects and
[54:13] unfortunately saints uh i hope i'm not
[54:16] speaking out of turn but it seems like
[54:19] today there are a lot of willing
[54:21] subjects for these demons to find
[54:23] themselves in to be able to get in to
[54:27] manipulate and to do what they do in
[54:30] this world and in each person today now
[54:32] 8th first
[54:34] satan prevailed not neither was their
[54:36] place found anymore in heaven
[54:38] and the and the great dragon was cast
[54:41] out
[54:42] that old serpent called the devil satan
[54:44] which just now look at this
[54:46] which deceiveth the whole world
[54:50] amen that's why we can't be a part of
[54:52] the world
[54:53] that's why god has called his bride out
[54:56] of the world
[54:58] because the whole world has been
[55:01] deceived by satan
[55:03] and those demonic spirits the whole
[55:06] world has that's why you cannot be a
[55:09] part of the world
[55:10] you as a child of god cannot be a part
[55:13] of this cosmos of this world order
[55:16] because you're a child of god because
[55:18] the whole world
[55:20] has been deceived by this devil by this
[55:23] by these spirits
[55:25] they've been deceived but that does not
[55:28] include you
[55:29] it does not include those that are that
[55:31] are a blood vault born again filled with
[55:34] the holy ghost god's children it does
[55:36] not include you
[55:38] because you're not a part of the world
[55:40] god has called you as an exodus out of
[55:43] the world
[55:44] just like god has called a bride out of
[55:47] the church
[55:48] amen and made her his own
[55:51] she's been elected she's been
[55:53] predestined she's been called she's been
[55:56] set
[55:58] as god's chosen amen just like a man
[56:02] picks a wife
[56:03] just like a man picks a bride
[56:05] he rejects the billions of other women
[56:08] that are in the world and he takes them
[56:10] to his bosom one specific woman
[56:14] that he loves that he wants to spend the
[56:16] rest of his life with that he wants to
[56:18] take unto himself
[56:20] that's special
[56:22] every every every other woman
[56:25] means nothing in this capacity to this
[56:27] man except that one woman
[56:30] he chose her he picked her he elected
[56:32] her the woman picks the man too but
[56:35] speaking of christ and his bride now
[56:38] he picked her he chose her as a part of
[56:41] him
[56:42] amen so she's not a part of the world so
[56:45] there's no deception because you're not
[56:47] in the world
[56:49] but the world friend the whole world
[56:52] has been deceived
[56:53] and is being deceived by this enemy
[56:57] he deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[56:59] out into the earth and his angels were
[57:01] cast out with him and i heard a loud
[57:03] voice saying in heaven
[57:05] now has come salvation strength kingdom
[57:07] of our god the power of his christ for
[57:09] the accuser
[57:11] of our brethren is cast down the accuser
[57:14] which accused them before our god day
[57:17] and night notice what he did to job
[57:19] notice how he accused job all the time
[57:22] oh he'll curse you to your face oh he'll
[57:24] do this god if you just take a hand off
[57:27] of him and i'll i'll show you what i'll
[57:29] do to him
[57:30] accusing day and night
[57:32] and that's exactly what he still does
[57:34] today
[57:35] sometimes he uses willing subjects to do
[57:37] it sometimes he just accuses you of
[57:39] things and jesus looks and and it may
[57:42] have been again it may have been
[57:43] something that you may have done as a
[57:45] human
[57:46] amen but when you come before the lord
[57:48] and you ask forgiveness you repent and
[57:50] that thing is washed in the blood it
[57:52] never happened doesn't it doesn't exist
[57:54] when god looks at it the awesome power
[57:56] and i don't you know
[57:58] most of you know me i don't even like
[58:00] the word awesome
[58:01] but
[58:02] the awesome power of god to be able to
[58:05] forget
[58:07] can you imagine
[58:09] we think in ourselves god can do
[58:11] anything and he can
[58:13] but the power of god to forget it ever
[58:16] happened
[58:18] amen
[58:19] i'm thankful he has that kind of power
[58:21] praise the lord right to forget any of
[58:23] those so that is annihilated doesn't it
[58:26] it's not held to your account anymore
[58:28] amen
[58:29] because in the garden of eden from the
[58:31] very oh my
[58:32] we can get way back can't we uh
[58:35] satan started this ball rolling when he
[58:38] misrepresented the word to eve
[58:40] he started this ball rolling and from
[58:43] there is where you came
[58:45] you didn't do that but you came as a
[58:47] result of that
[58:49] so you were trapped into this body you
[58:51] came into this world that's why every
[58:53] human ever lived has to have the
[58:55] opportunity to salvation everybody or
[58:58] god's not a just god right now it comes
[59:01] to that individual now whether you're
[59:03] going to accept it or reject it
[59:06] amen if you accept it and you get
[59:09] born again filled with god's spirit and
[59:11] under the blood of christ praise the
[59:13] lord if you don't that's the person's
[59:15] choice
[59:16] but god doesn't hold you responsible to
[59:18] that that's why the grace come in so
[59:21] bountifully and beautifully by the blood
[59:23] of christ that grace came in
[59:26] to take care of the things that you
[59:28] weren't that you didn't do
[59:31] you weren't in the gardev to to do what
[59:34] they did you didn't start this ball
[59:36] rolling you just came into this world as
[59:38] a result of that that's why the grace of
[59:41] god come so bountifully
[59:44] to show that we can have that redemption
[59:46] now that we could come back to him
[59:48] through that blood now satan is there as
[59:51] the accuser
[59:53] the accuser now look at this the accuser
[59:56] is someone
[59:58] who claims
[1:00:00] i like that's the word that i want to
[1:00:02] emphasize on to you here now the accuser
[1:00:05] is someone who claims
[1:00:08] a person has committed offense or done
[1:00:11] something wrong
[1:00:13] that's what an accuser is it's a claim
[1:00:16] an accusation is a claim
[1:00:19] is to say
[1:00:20] that by my authority you've done
[1:00:22] something wrong
[1:00:24] and then they go and they tell a judge
[1:00:26] or they tell somebody else or they tell
[1:00:27] the police or call the police or
[1:00:29] something i claim i accuse this person
[1:00:32] of have done something wrong
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:36] that's what an accuser is has committed
[1:00:38] an offense or done something wrong but
[1:00:41] it does not mean just because somebody's
[1:00:43] laid an accusation at your feet does not
[1:00:46] mean that you did it does not mean that
[1:00:48] you're guilty of it even if you did
[1:00:50] again and your humanity did it in the
[1:00:52] blood of christ in his mind you never
[1:00:54] did it so when this accuser is before
[1:00:57] god day and night trying to accuse you
[1:01:01] he falls on deaf ears because you never
[1:01:04] did it
[1:01:05] he is the accuser of the innocent look
[1:01:08] he continuously
[1:01:10] does this over and over and over that's
[1:01:14] how he tries to defeat you that's how he
[1:01:16] tries to get you beat down to try to get
[1:01:18] you to to think that you're less than
[1:01:20] who you are in christ because if you're
[1:01:23] a son of god if you're a child of god if
[1:01:25] you're born of god and god has accepted
[1:01:28] you and elected you you are as god on
[1:01:31] this earth
[1:01:33] god has put himself in you
[1:01:36] and all the attributes that come as a
[1:01:39] representation of him come with it
[1:01:42] because it's his spirit it's his life
[1:01:45] that he has put in you
[1:01:47] and now that spirit living in you
[1:01:49] operates and lives by the spirit of god
[1:01:52] through his word
[1:01:54] and that word then speaks through your
[1:01:56] life
[1:01:57] it manifests itself it reveals itself it
[1:02:00] shows itself through you
[1:02:03] you become accepted in that light so
[1:02:05] when the accuser comes before god and
[1:02:07] tries to accuse you of things that never
[1:02:09] happened
[1:02:11] and look
[1:02:12] most of the time
[1:02:14] you ever been accused of somebody that
[1:02:17] of something that you didn't do
[1:02:19] has anybody i just you don't have to
[1:02:21] raise your hand or anything but has
[1:02:23] anybody ever accused you of doing
[1:02:25] something you know you never even did
[1:02:27] i mean let's just forget about
[1:02:30] the blood of christ and and forgiveness
[1:02:32] and but did you just never did it to
[1:02:34] begin with
[1:02:37] i have
[1:02:39] you ever had somebody or somebody's
[1:02:42] plural
[1:02:44] try to do everything they can
[1:02:47] and almost make it their life's mission
[1:02:49] it seems
[1:02:51] to find dirt on you
[1:02:54] to find something wrong with you
[1:02:57] this there's got to be something going
[1:02:59] on we've got to find something against
[1:03:02] this person there must be some kind of
[1:03:05] some friend if you dig long enough
[1:03:07] you're going to find plenty
[1:03:09] because we're all human right but it
[1:03:11] seems like so many times
[1:03:14] that the accuser is someone who is the
[1:03:17] most guilty about what they're accusing
[1:03:19] the the person for
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:22] you ever notice that
[1:03:24] they accuse somebody of something
[1:03:26] they're guilty of doing
[1:03:29] but they but but see they're forgiven
[1:03:32] that that's gone and done away but then
[1:03:34] they accuse other people of the exact
[1:03:36] same thing
[1:03:38] or something that's along the same lines
[1:03:41] you say well
[1:03:42] i i don't do this yeah but you do this
[1:03:46] right oh well you know and then excuses
[1:03:49] come but that's what an accuser does
[1:03:51] that's exactly what the devil does
[1:03:55] he makes the accused the accused
[1:03:59] look so guilty that there's no way that
[1:04:01] they can be forgiven
[1:04:03] but the blood of jesus christ we know
[1:04:05] annihilates all sin
[1:04:08] nothing helps but usually the guilty is
[1:04:10] the one that's actually the the one
[1:04:13] that's to blame
[1:04:15] they're probably the one doing the thing
[1:04:17] they're claiming the other person has
[1:04:19] done or is doing
[1:04:21] because of their
[1:04:23] because that's the accusation
[1:04:26] that they they want to
[1:04:29] find something
[1:04:30] it's like that uh it's like that
[1:04:33] attitude i kind of even wrote some of it
[1:04:34] in my book it's it's kind of like that
[1:04:36] attitude of sean freud of people
[1:04:41] certain people now remember
[1:04:44] we're not accusing any brothers we're
[1:04:46] not accusing any sisters we're not
[1:04:47] accusing any churches we're not accusing
[1:04:49] anybody but the devil
[1:04:51] that's all
[1:04:52] the devil the devil is the one to take
[1:04:54] the hit here not a brother or sister or
[1:04:56] a church the devil is the accuser
[1:04:59] now
[1:05:00] but as he would find a willing subject
[1:05:05] the willing subject maybe that person
[1:05:07] that just for some reason
[1:05:09] again
[1:05:10] and i'll ask the question is anybody
[1:05:13] that you've ever met in your life
[1:05:15] that
[1:05:16] just
[1:05:17] you meet them or or you speak to them or
[1:05:20] for for whatever reason
[1:05:22] even if it's just for five minutes that
[1:05:24] person just hates you
[1:05:27] you don't know why
[1:05:29] and they may not even be able to tell
[1:05:31] you why
[1:05:33] maybe you're just
[1:05:35] such a good person
[1:05:37] they hate you so much for it because
[1:05:39] they feel guilty because they're not
[1:05:43] maybe
[1:05:43] you live the kind of life they wish they
[1:05:46] could live and they feel like they can't
[1:05:48] and in yourself you can't
[1:05:50] you have to have the holy spirit to live
[1:05:52] the kind of life that a born-again child
[1:05:53] of god does you have to have the holy
[1:05:55] spirit but they're mad at you for that
[1:05:58] oh well then we've got to find anything
[1:05:59] that we can find against this person
[1:06:02] you go to a job or lived on or worked on
[1:06:04] a job
[1:06:05] and and profess you're a christian have
[1:06:08] you ever gone to a job professor or
[1:06:10] christian imagine going on and working
[1:06:12] at a job and professing to be a minister
[1:06:15] and say you're a preacher a pastor you
[1:06:18] think people look at you just because
[1:06:19] you say you're a christian go there as a
[1:06:22] minister and see how people look at you
[1:06:26] it's amazing but
[1:06:28] it's that it's that
[1:06:30] spirit and then that's the point i'm
[1:06:33] trying to get to is that spirit that
[1:06:35] that gets on to people that does this
[1:06:37] and for some reason that person just
[1:06:40] hates you
[1:06:41] or persons or they're going to find
[1:06:43] something they're going to accuse you
[1:06:44] somehow they're going to dig and dig and
[1:06:47] dig and dig they're going to try to find
[1:06:48] whatever they can dig up to accuse you
[1:06:50] of something
[1:06:52] but remember the accuser is the devil
[1:06:55] amen that's the accuser first peter
[1:06:58] chapter 5.
[1:07:00] i just want to read one verse of
[1:07:02] scripture
[1:07:10] first peter chapter 5 verse 8.
[1:07:17] be sober
[1:07:19] be vigilant sober just means temperate
[1:07:22] it doesn't mean
[1:07:23] don't drink alcohol it just means to be
[1:07:26] don't don't let your temper get the best
[1:07:28] of you it means
[1:07:29] stay calm if you will
[1:07:31] don't get beside yourself be sober be
[1:07:34] vigilant
[1:07:35] because your adversary the devil as a
[1:07:38] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[1:07:41] he may devour
[1:07:43] that's why we always make sure that we
[1:07:45] watch
[1:07:46] and pay attention and that we are
[1:07:49] that we're walking in the oracles of
[1:07:51] god's word and that we're living the
[1:07:54] life
[1:07:55] as best we can as pleasing to god
[1:07:59] nothing to cross his word nothing to
[1:08:01] hurt him nothing that would cause
[1:08:04] you to be flagged as guilty
[1:08:08] but
[1:08:08] soberly vigilantly because satan's going
[1:08:11] to continue to do this friends that's
[1:08:13] why we're always watching always
[1:08:15] protecting always keeping because we
[1:08:17] don't want to get ourselves to the place
[1:08:18] that that to give any room of the devil
[1:08:22] any wedge in that door that satan could
[1:08:24] use to try to get in to destroy your
[1:08:27] character some way because again even
[1:08:29] though it shouldn't be done it is done
[1:08:32] all the time
[1:08:34] where people destroy one another's
[1:08:35] character over whatever right it
[1:08:39] shouldn't be done but remember there's
[1:08:41] going to be willing subjects
[1:08:43] yeah there's going to be willing
[1:08:45] subjects that these spirits will will
[1:08:47] infiltrate themselves in and will
[1:08:49] operate through
[1:08:51] and those are the kind of people that
[1:08:52] are going to be uh
[1:08:55] the accuser if you will now let's go to
[1:08:58] saint john chapter 8.
[1:09:08] we know very well we are not the only
[1:09:11] ones
[1:09:13] that
[1:09:13] satan does this to
[1:09:17] when jesus christ came himself from the
[1:09:20] very first time that he came forth
[1:09:23] and was acknowledged by others around
[1:09:25] him there were men there were
[1:09:27] organizations there were pharisees
[1:09:30] sadducees scribes that absolutely hated
[1:09:32] jesus
[1:09:34] and i imagine though it does not say
[1:09:37] if you were to go ask any of them why do
[1:09:39] you hate this man so bad what did he
[1:09:42] ever do to you
[1:09:45] how has this man hurt you
[1:09:48] he's
[1:09:50] only spoke good things he's only spoke
[1:09:53] righteous things
[1:09:54] he's only he's never brought sickness
[1:09:57] only healing he's never brought death
[1:09:59] only light
[1:10:00] he's only been here to be
[1:10:03] good
[1:10:04] to be an example of good to be a holy
[1:10:07] righteous god why do you hate him so
[1:10:10] much
[1:10:12] look
[1:10:14] we'll get to that in a few minutes but
[1:10:15] look at saint john uh chapter eight
[1:10:17] verse four
[1:10:18] they say unto him master
[1:10:21] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[1:10:23] very act
[1:10:25] now moses in the law commanded us
[1:10:28] that such should be stoned
[1:10:30] but what sayest thou now look
[1:10:33] these men
[1:10:35] they already have caught this woman
[1:10:37] they're already blood thirsty they're
[1:10:40] ready to bash your head in as quickly as
[1:10:42] they can with rocks because they're
[1:10:44] following a law which they by the law
[1:10:46] were commanded to do
[1:10:48] they were ready to do this they were
[1:10:50] they knew what the word was because they
[1:10:52] told jesus moses in the and the
[1:10:55] commandment and the law told us this is
[1:10:57] what we're supposed to do to her then
[1:10:59] why haven't you done it
[1:11:02] right why didn't you do it why did you
[1:11:04] bring her here
[1:11:06] you caught her in the very act why
[1:11:08] haven't you already done what you say
[1:11:10] moses told you to do why didn't you do
[1:11:11] it well look at this
[1:11:14] what says thou
[1:11:16] this they said tempting him
[1:11:19] amen remember because they hate him
[1:11:21] they absolutely hate jesus
[1:11:23] they said this tempting him that they
[1:11:26] might have to accuse him they're trying
[1:11:28] to set him up
[1:11:30] they're trying to put him in a position
[1:11:32] that they can bring a railing accusation
[1:11:35] against him that's how much they hated
[1:11:37] him
[1:11:38] that's how much they wanted to try to
[1:11:39] destroy him
[1:11:41] was to try to bring this accusation
[1:11:43] against him now we know that was never
[1:11:46] going to happen until it was time for
[1:11:48] jesus to offer himself up which he did
[1:11:50] which he told pilate he said i could
[1:11:52] have 10 late 12 legions of angels come
[1:11:54] and take me down right now take me away
[1:11:57] from here just one word
[1:12:00] those angels are sitting there flaming
[1:12:02] swords drawn ready to take over at just
[1:12:04] a hint of jesus saying something they
[1:12:08] would have pulled him away from them
[1:12:10] he would have rescued him
[1:12:12] but that's not the purpose he came here
[1:12:13] for amen he came here to die
[1:12:16] to shed his blood to redeem us
[1:12:19] but they hated him
[1:12:21] hated him
[1:12:24] tempting him
[1:12:25] they're trying their best to dig up dirt
[1:12:28] they're trying not just to dig up dirt
[1:12:30] they're trying to create dirt
[1:12:33] they're trying to manufacture something
[1:12:36] they normally would have destroyed this
[1:12:38] woman they normally would have stoned
[1:12:40] her to death because they said here they
[1:12:43] already they knew that that's what moses
[1:12:45] said to do and not no doubt that's
[1:12:46] probably what they've done every other
[1:12:48] time they've done this amen
[1:12:51] but they wanted to tempt him they wanted
[1:12:54] to try to find a place to accuse him of
[1:12:56] something now i'm sure nobody in here
[1:12:58] has ever had that happen to them
[1:13:02] lay a trap
[1:13:04] satan lays a trap
[1:13:07] be careful
[1:13:08] amen because those traps will get you if
[1:13:10] you're not careful
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:14] but they just wanted to accuse him
[1:13:16] but jesus stooped down and with his
[1:13:18] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[1:13:20] heard them not
[1:13:21] so when they continued asking him he
[1:13:23] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[1:13:26] that is without sin among you let him
[1:13:28] cast the first stone at her
[1:13:30] first catholics donut her and again he
[1:13:33] stooped down and wrote on the ground
[1:13:36] did you imagine what was going through
[1:13:37] their minds at that time
[1:13:39] now it's been a great debate
[1:13:42] never says in the scripture but it's
[1:13:43] been a great debate on what jesus was
[1:13:45] writing on the ground what do you think
[1:13:46] he was writing on the ground
[1:13:48] you think he was naming every one of
[1:13:49] those men that were standing there with
[1:13:51] a stone
[1:13:52] you think maybe he was putting their
[1:13:54] names down and the things they were
[1:13:55] guilty of
[1:13:57] what do you think that what do you think
[1:13:58] he was writing i don't know
[1:14:00] they're probably up for great debate
[1:14:02] anybody can say well he could have been
[1:14:04] doing this he could have visited but he
[1:14:05] could have been but the result is what
[1:14:07] we're talking about
[1:14:09] he without sin let you cast the first
[1:14:11] stone entered
[1:14:13] stoops down and he starts writing again
[1:14:15] and they which heard it
[1:14:17] being convicted by their own conscience
[1:14:21] went out one by one
[1:14:23] beginning at the eldest even unto the
[1:14:25] last and jesus was left alone and the
[1:14:27] woman standing in the midst
[1:14:29] when jesus had lifted up himself and saw
[1:14:31] none but the woman he said unto her
[1:14:33] woman
[1:14:34] where are those not accusers
[1:14:36] hath no man condemned thee
[1:14:39] she said no man lord
[1:14:41] jesus said to her neither do i condemn
[1:14:43] thee
[1:14:44] go and sin no more
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] you've been rescued
[1:14:50] you've been declared innocent
[1:14:52] that that you've done has been done away
[1:14:54] with now don't go do it again right amen
[1:14:57] stay pure of that thing
[1:14:59] don't go do it again don't
[1:15:01] go and sin no more don't don't don't let
[1:15:03] this thing come on you now
[1:15:05] that's the worst thing and he tells one
[1:15:07] later said the lord or worse thing come
[1:15:08] upon me amen but her accusers were gone
[1:15:13] they had no more satan found
[1:15:16] willing subjects
[1:15:18] he brought them to this place and their
[1:15:20] purpose in their mind was to us to
[1:15:22] accuse him but why what was their motive
[1:15:26] what was the motive they had
[1:15:28] i see i
[1:15:30] i bring all this out to help us
[1:15:32] understand
[1:15:33] in our minds
[1:15:35] in our lives with other people with
[1:15:38] things that we have faced in life friend
[1:15:40] what is the motive
[1:15:42] what's the reason if we desire to try to
[1:15:45] go to cue somebody why
[1:15:48] what is your point what is your endgame
[1:15:50] what are you trying to accomplish
[1:15:53] does it raise us up to see other people
[1:15:56] torn down
[1:15:58] that's shot and freud
[1:15:59] that is the pleasure of getting uh
[1:16:03] something out of watching somebody else
[1:16:05] fall
[1:16:06] the joy the happiness that is sad
[1:16:10] yes
[1:16:11] that is a demonic spirit friend
[1:16:13] to get joy out of watching somebody else
[1:16:16] fall
[1:16:17] now
[1:16:20] i had someone call me one time
[1:16:24] because he did something
[1:16:26] and i told him i said
[1:16:28] you're wrong
[1:16:30] you shouldn't do this you're wrong
[1:16:33] that person called me later
[1:16:35] and they said
[1:16:36] oh brother i appreciate if you don't
[1:16:38] tell so-and-so
[1:16:40] i said that's not my job
[1:16:42] that's not my job to tattletail
[1:16:46] it's god's job if god wants it to be
[1:16:49] exposed he'll do it not me
[1:16:52] now that that doesn't happen every
[1:16:54] single time because there has been times
[1:16:56] the lord has
[1:16:57] in uh uh has
[1:17:01] pushed me to say something
[1:17:03] but that wasn't that position i wasn't
[1:17:05] there to tell that tear that person down
[1:17:06] my motive wasn't to destroy that
[1:17:08] person's character
[1:17:11] it wasn't
[1:17:12] so what is the motive what's the reason
[1:17:15] when those things come and they come to
[1:17:17] you and others bring them to you what
[1:17:20] would be the reason why
[1:17:22] why are they
[1:17:23] desiring to destroy you why do they feel
[1:17:26] like that they get lifted up more just
[1:17:28] because you get torn down
[1:17:31] that's that's what happens in government
[1:17:34] which is probably the most corrupt
[1:17:37] institution in this country today is
[1:17:39] government right
[1:17:41] that sounds like government or corporate
[1:17:43] business
[1:17:44] i'll get a promotion if this person gets
[1:17:47] torn down
[1:17:48] but how what kind of a place is that in
[1:17:51] the kingdom of god
[1:17:53] what kind what kind of situation
[1:17:56] what does that serve
[1:17:58] in a body of christ
[1:18:01] others may be trying to do it to you but
[1:18:03] look saints god is your protector
[1:18:07] god is the one that watches over you god
[1:18:09] is the one that takes care of you
[1:18:11] not anybody else not somebody down there
[1:18:14] god does that
[1:18:16] leave it in his hands let him take care
[1:18:19] of it you might look and say but i don't
[1:18:21] understand it's not necessarily meant
[1:18:23] for you to understand you just got to
[1:18:25] believe it
[1:18:28] david even said lord why did the wicked
[1:18:31] prosper so
[1:18:34] he didn't get an answer
[1:18:36] i don't have an answer
[1:18:38] i can't tell you that all i know is that
[1:18:40] god has a purpose and everything that
[1:18:43] god does he serves and i'm his child
[1:18:45] and everything that he does works out
[1:18:47] for my good american
[1:18:49] everything i i might not understand it
[1:18:51] might not be able to explain it but i
[1:18:53] know it does
[1:18:55] sometimes things have happened 20 30
[1:18:57] years ago in my life and i might come to
[1:19:00] a realization someday i'm sure that's
[1:19:02] never happened to any of you either you
[1:19:04] come to
[1:19:05] realization one nation when no wonder
[1:19:06] that happened over here like that
[1:19:08] because god was bringing me to this
[1:19:10] place or this thing or to do this or for
[1:19:12] this purpose
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:16] and then we fret about it we worry about
[1:19:18] it we go back and forth and
[1:19:20] people and things and accusings enough
[1:19:23] and and what does it actually amount to
[1:19:28] what does it bring us see what are we
[1:19:30] trying to accomplish what are we trying
[1:19:32] to get to
[1:19:34] satan is continually accusing us
[1:19:37] day and night
[1:19:39] day and night and he's deceived the
[1:19:40] whole world but day and night accusing
[1:19:43] us
[1:19:44] of
[1:19:46] something you did not do
[1:19:48] accusing the innocent
[1:19:51] now this woman was guilty
[1:19:53] she was guilty as convicted she was
[1:19:55] caught in the very act
[1:19:58] the law said what her punishment was
[1:20:02] and those men there as righteous men of
[1:20:04] the of the torah was there to execute
[1:20:07] that that moses told them to do
[1:20:10] they weren't out of bounds
[1:20:14] look they weren't out of bounds but
[1:20:15] their motive in bringing the woman to
[1:20:17] jesus was what was out of bounds if you
[1:20:20] will
[1:20:22] because they just wanted to tempt him
[1:20:24] they just wanted to try to find
[1:20:25] something to accuse him to try to make
[1:20:27] him look guilty or try to make him look
[1:20:29] like a bad person
[1:20:31] oh with jesus then we can bring him
[1:20:33] before the council now because he did
[1:20:35] this
[1:20:36] he said this and he did
[1:20:38] walk like this see
[1:20:41] to try to make him look guilty when they
[1:20:43] themselves were so guilty that when he
[1:20:46] told them if you don't have any sin in
[1:20:48] your life go ahead and throw the stone
[1:20:51] one by one they had to drop it
[1:20:54] because they knew what kind of life they
[1:20:56] lived and who they were
[1:20:58] friend every one of us has sinned and
[1:21:00] comes toward the glory of god
[1:21:02] amen every one of us
[1:21:04] let's look at this next
[1:21:06] scripture with jesus over john 18.
[1:21:14] there should never
[1:21:17] never
[1:21:18] be a joy in our heart
[1:21:20] if we see somebody fall
[1:21:22] never
[1:21:24] if there is saints
[1:21:25] we need to find a place and start
[1:21:27] praying
[1:21:28] and asking god lord take the spirit out
[1:21:30] of me because that's not right
[1:21:32] you certainly
[1:21:34] if you were in their place you certainly
[1:21:36] won't want them doing the same thing
[1:21:40] we should never get joy from someone
[1:21:43] else falling
[1:21:46] john 18.
[1:21:48] they finally accused him they finally
[1:21:50] got him to this place now 28th verse
[1:21:54] john 18 28
[1:21:56] then led they jesus from from uh
[1:22:00] from campus unto the hall of judgment
[1:22:03] and it was early and they themselves
[1:22:05] went not into the judgment hall unless
[1:22:07] they should be defiled
[1:22:09] but that they might eat the passover
[1:22:11] pilate then went out unto them and said
[1:22:15] what accusation bringing against this
[1:22:18] man
[1:22:19] he's looking at some reason that he's
[1:22:22] there with jesus what is this accusation
[1:22:26] and look what they said
[1:22:28] they answered and said unto him
[1:22:30] if he were not a male factor we would
[1:22:33] not have delivered him unto thee
[1:22:37] that's no evidence
[1:22:39] that's no reason
[1:22:41] they didn't tell him why
[1:22:43] they just said well if he wasn't guilty
[1:22:45] we wouldn't have brought him here
[1:22:48] well i mean pilate said i think that's
[1:22:50] not my job
[1:22:51] you're supposed to tell me what did he
[1:22:53] do
[1:22:54] why is he here
[1:22:57] why did you bring him to me
[1:22:59] there's got to be a reason oh well if he
[1:23:01] wasn't guilty we wouldn't have brought
[1:23:03] him here that's not a that's not a
[1:23:04] reason
[1:23:06] what did he do
[1:23:08] see they couldn't tell them
[1:23:11] they had nothing against him oh yeah
[1:23:14] he's a man and call himself god well
[1:23:16] they got that absolute backwards because
[1:23:18] he was god calling himself man
[1:23:20] or being a man
[1:23:22] they got that backwards anyway but
[1:23:25] they couldn't even give pilate a reason
[1:23:27] why they brought him there
[1:23:29] just that he's guilty
[1:23:31] he's a male factor he was the male
[1:23:33] factor he wouldn't be here
[1:23:36] nothing nothing of substance
[1:23:38] then said pilate unto them take he him
[1:23:41] and judge him according to your law then
[1:23:43] excuse me added to them
[1:23:45] the jews therefore said unto him it is
[1:23:47] not lawful for us to put any man to
[1:23:49] death so you're telling me that you're
[1:23:51] wanting to kill this man and you can't
[1:23:54] even tell me why
[1:23:57] you can't even give me a reason
[1:23:59] no evidence
[1:24:01] no accusation you're telling me you
[1:24:04] think this man deserves to die for what
[1:24:09] what did he do
[1:24:11] but see that wasn't it
[1:24:13] they just hated him
[1:24:15] hated him without cause
[1:24:18] he didn't do anything but good and holy
[1:24:21] oh sure it made him mad because it
[1:24:23] crossed every bit of their religious
[1:24:26] diadem
[1:24:27] but he didn't do anything wrong he
[1:24:29] didn't make any mistakes
[1:24:31] he lived a perfect sinless life
[1:24:34] they had nothing to accuse him of and
[1:24:37] they still wanted to kill him or what
[1:24:40] what did he do
[1:24:42] you take him and judging them well we
[1:24:44] can't put a man to death oh what do you
[1:24:47] want to kill him for he didn't do
[1:24:48] anything
[1:24:50] mine
[1:24:51] see how it is
[1:24:53] so you ever get in that position saint
[1:24:57] or we have been before
[1:24:59] you understand
[1:25:00] the spirit that drives that
[1:25:02] amen again it's not it's not the person
[1:25:06] it's not a brother or sister it's it's
[1:25:08] the devil
[1:25:09] it's the devil amen and yes i'm not
[1:25:12] going to stand here and say the devil
[1:25:14] doesn't need to be exposed he does
[1:25:17] amen i'm not saying that the devil
[1:25:19] should just be left in his own play land
[1:25:21] no the devil does need to be exposed
[1:25:24] i mean that's what the opening of the
[1:25:25] seals was all about was expose the enemy
[1:25:27] to expose the devil all of his things to
[1:25:29] the church ages and all that he's done
[1:25:30] up to this time and going to do
[1:25:33] see
[1:25:34] but they had no reason to put him to
[1:25:36] death
[1:25:39] 32nd verse that the saying of jesus
[1:25:41] might be fulfilled which he spake
[1:25:43] signifying what death he should die
[1:25:46] then pilate entered into the judgment
[1:25:48] hall again and called jesus and said
[1:25:50] unto him art thou the king of the jews
[1:25:53] jesus answered him sayeth thou this of
[1:25:55] thyself or did others tell it of thee
[1:25:57] pilate answered i am i a jew that old
[1:26:01] nation and chief priests have delivered
[1:26:03] the unto me what hast thou done see he
[1:26:05] still doesn't even know what they what
[1:26:07] he's done
[1:26:08] he's asking jesus now because they
[1:26:10] couldn't the accusers could not even
[1:26:13] tell him what they were there what he
[1:26:14] was there for
[1:26:16] what have you done he still doesn't know
[1:26:18] jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[1:26:20] world if my king were of this world then
[1:26:22] would my servants fight and i should not
[1:26:24] be delivered to the jews but now is my
[1:26:27] kingdom not from hence
[1:26:29] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[1:26:31] a king then
[1:26:33] jesus answered thou sayest that i am the
[1:26:35] king
[1:26:36] to this hand was i born for this cause
[1:26:38] came into the world that i should bear
[1:26:40] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[1:26:43] of the truth heareth my voice that's the
[1:26:45] people that are not of the world
[1:26:47] because they hear his voice
[1:26:49] not the voice of the world
[1:26:51] not the voice of the devil in this
[1:26:53] demonic spirit but his voice
[1:26:55] i hear his voice not of the world pilate
[1:26:58] said unto him those all immortal words
[1:27:00] what is truth
[1:27:02] people say it today
[1:27:04] exactly the thing that people looking
[1:27:06] for today
[1:27:07] people of the world people everywhere
[1:27:09] around the world people in religious
[1:27:11] denominations and religious uh churches
[1:27:14] places all around still asking this
[1:27:16] question what is the truth
[1:27:19] and dares i say it i don't mean to go
[1:27:21] out on a limb here but
[1:27:23] unfortunately it seems like the greater
[1:27:24] portion of the religious world
[1:27:27] doesn't even know the answer to this
[1:27:29] question
[1:27:31] they still try to find an answer
[1:27:34] in
[1:27:35] some
[1:27:36] phrase
[1:27:38] or soliloquy or
[1:27:41] when they can't
[1:27:42] they they don't see and realize
[1:27:44] that truth is not a word
[1:27:47] it's not an answer it's a person
[1:27:51] the truth is standing before pilate
[1:27:54] and he doesn't even know it
[1:27:56] he's telling it he's asking
[1:27:59] truth
[1:28:00] what is truth now could jesus just stood
[1:28:03] there so well you're looking at it
[1:28:04] because he was true he is true
[1:28:08] and when he and when he said this he
[1:28:11] went out again unto the jews and said
[1:28:12] unto them i find in him no fault at all
[1:28:18] even judged by the ones they took him to
[1:28:21] was still guiltless
[1:28:23] i i'm the judge i judge him righteous he
[1:28:27] hasn't done anything you can't tell me
[1:28:29] he's done anything he's not told me i
[1:28:32] haven't seen anything there's been no
[1:28:34] evidence this man is guiltless
[1:28:37] he's done nothing wrong i find no fault
[1:28:40] in him
[1:28:41] but
[1:28:42] you have a custom that i should release
[1:28:44] unto you one of the passover we
[1:28:46] therefore that i release unto you the
[1:28:47] king of the jews then cry they all again
[1:28:51] saying not this man but barabbas
[1:28:54] now barabbas was a robber
[1:28:57] they'd rather have the robber
[1:28:59] they'd rather had the person that really
[1:29:02] was guilty of something
[1:29:03] of someone that had actually done wrong
[1:29:06] and had wronged other people
[1:29:09] that's who he had in prison they'd
[1:29:11] rather had jesus
[1:29:14] who'd done nothing wrong
[1:29:16] and they could not find any fault
[1:29:18] against him and pilate could not find
[1:29:20] any fault against it he was guiltless he
[1:29:23] had done no wrong
[1:29:25] my
[1:29:28] ever been in that situation
[1:29:31] you think what have i done
[1:29:33] right
[1:29:34] what mistake have i made
[1:29:37] i've had people lay in accusation
[1:29:39] against me
[1:29:41] and they look me square in the eye after
[1:29:43] laying these accusations and say well do
[1:29:46] you have any accusations for somebody
[1:29:48] else
[1:29:49] like are you kidding me
[1:29:51] are you seriously asking me that as a
[1:29:53] son a child a child of god you're asking
[1:29:55] me that question
[1:29:57] i i i don't know how to answer that
[1:30:01] you think if i know something against
[1:30:03] this brother or sister whoever i'm going
[1:30:05] to tell you or i'm going to expose it or
[1:30:07] i'm going to broadcast this on the news
[1:30:09] or a billboard or somewhere
[1:30:13] are we christians or are we
[1:30:17] ungodly
[1:30:18] government whatever
[1:30:20] who who do we think we are
[1:30:23] not paraphrasing i didn't say all that
[1:30:25] i'm like absolutely not i don't do that
[1:30:28] i think we're somewhat the words i said
[1:30:30] i don't do that even if i knew something
[1:30:32] i'm not going to tell you
[1:30:38] i just don't understand it
[1:30:41] but i do understand
[1:30:43] that satan
[1:30:44] is continuously accusing you before god
[1:30:46] day and night
[1:30:48] and he's accusing the innocent
[1:30:51] because in god's eyes you never did it
[1:30:53] in the first place
[1:30:55] amen let me read one more scripture
[1:30:57] we'll close here romans chapter 8.
[1:31:06] romans chapter 8.
[1:31:12] let's start with verse 12 31.
[1:31:16] what shall we they what shall we then
[1:31:18] say to those things
[1:31:21] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:31:25] my mind
[1:31:27] he that spared not his own son but
[1:31:28] delivered him up for us all
[1:31:31] how shall we not with him so freely give
[1:31:34] us all things
[1:31:37] who
[1:31:39] shall lay anything
[1:31:41] to the charge of god's elect
[1:31:45] who
[1:31:47] it is god to justify it and remember
[1:31:49] we've already talked about justification
[1:31:52] is it though you've never never done it
[1:31:53] in the first place
[1:31:54] it is god that justified so who can lay
[1:31:57] anything
[1:31:58] to the charge of god's elect
[1:32:01] it's god to justify it it's not you that
[1:32:04] justify it it's not me that justified
[1:32:06] it's not the devil
[1:32:08] it's not a church it's not a pastor it's
[1:32:11] god
[1:32:12] god does the justifying you can bring
[1:32:14] all the accusations you can level all
[1:32:16] the accusations you want against but if
[1:32:18] god's done the justifying you are
[1:32:21] innocent
[1:32:23] never did it in the first place
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:26] not held to your account
[1:32:28] because god finds no record against you
[1:32:31] for that
[1:32:32] no record you know where it goes it goes
[1:32:34] right back on the head of satan where it
[1:32:36] lays of the dead judgment because he is
[1:32:39] the accuser of the brethren
[1:32:41] he's the one from the very beginning
[1:32:43] that caused this whole thing this whole
[1:32:45] this whole ball rolling he started it
[1:32:48] generated it now as that sin lifts off
[1:32:51] and is counted against uh not against
[1:32:54] you it goes back to him
[1:32:56] now he's guilty of everything that he is
[1:32:59] accusing you of doing
[1:33:01] exactly
[1:33:02] so many times
[1:33:04] what the devil does
[1:33:07] he's guilty of something he's accusing
[1:33:09] somebody else of doing but the bible
[1:33:11] says who shall lay anything to the
[1:33:14] charge of god's elect
[1:33:16] amen
[1:33:17] again that does not mean that the devil
[1:33:19] stays
[1:33:20] unexposed because the devil does need to
[1:33:23] be exposed
[1:33:24] when when
[1:33:25] something is prolifically
[1:33:29] demonically
[1:33:33] hurting other people
[1:33:35] then the devil should be exposed
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:41] and god will deal with that
[1:33:43] right
[1:33:44] god will deal with that but satan is
[1:33:46] continuing to accuse you all the time
[1:33:49] in heaven day and night accusing you all
[1:33:51] the time but he's accusing the innocent
[1:33:54] he's guilty of the very thing he's
[1:33:55] accusing you of doing
[1:33:57] he's guilty of the very thing that he
[1:33:59] says that we are guilty of
[1:34:01] when god and the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:04] has made us guiltless
[1:34:05] has set us free has justified us as
[1:34:08] though you never did it in the first
[1:34:10] place
[1:34:11] praise the lord
[1:34:12] i think it's time we i think it's time
[1:34:14] we take all our shovels out that we that
[1:34:17] people keep digging up stuff from
[1:34:18] people's past and bash the devil's head
[1:34:20] in with them
[1:34:22] quit using them to dig up all this other
[1:34:24] dirt over here but just take it and just
[1:34:26] whack him one good time
[1:34:28] amen let him walk away with a few lumps
[1:34:31] on his head that's not gonna stop him
[1:34:32] but it might make you feel a little
[1:34:34] better
[1:34:35] amen
[1:34:37] praise the lord you know every time we
[1:34:39] lift up our voices to worship him every
[1:34:41] time we pick up this word and read it
[1:34:43] every time we bow our heads in prayer
[1:34:45] every time we put a tape on every time
[1:34:46] we come to church every time that we
[1:34:48] obey the word and god it's a bash in his
[1:34:51] head yes amen praise the lord every time
[1:34:53] that devil tries to come to you and say
[1:34:55] well you know go do this he said no
[1:34:57] devil satan get behind me
[1:35:02] let him leave with a few lumps amen
[1:35:04] he deserves it
[1:35:06] he deserves it you know we like to talk
[1:35:08] in the physical about spiritual elements
[1:35:10] but it still applies amen
[1:35:12] praise the lord he deserves it
[1:35:15] because he's still accusing you and he
[1:35:17] won't stop
[1:35:18] and he won't stop
[1:35:20] praise the lord day and night
[1:35:22] amen but thank god he's accusing the
[1:35:25] innocent
[1:35:26] guiltless praise the lord let's stand if
[1:35:28] we could
[1:35:44] satan is guilty
[1:35:48] he has his
[1:35:50] demonic spirits out there to try to
[1:35:52] bring deception
[1:35:55] to try to destroy you with it
[1:36:00] but thank god god has already made a way
[1:36:02] for us
[1:36:04] amen praise the lord

[1:37:21] song i'm talking about
[1:37:24] if any of you know where that is
[1:37:30] the blood
