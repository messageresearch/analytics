[33:16] this service in the name of the Lord
[33:18] Jesus Christ we pray
[33:20] amen and Exodus chapter 3 we'll just
[33:24] read a u first five verses here Exodus 3
[33:29] 1-5 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro
[33:32] his father-in-law the priest of Midian
[33:35] he led the flock to The Backs side of
[33:37] the desert and came to the Mountain of
[33:39] God even to HB the angel of the Lord
[33:42] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[33:44] of the midst of the uh out of the midst
[33:47] of a bush and he looked and behold the
[33:50] bush burned with fire but the bush the
[33:53] Bush was not
[33:55] consumed Moses said I will now turn
[33:57] aside and see this great sight why the
[34:00] bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw
[34:03] that he and when the Lord saw that he
[34:06] turned aside to see God called unto him
[34:10] out of the midst of the Bush and said
[34:11] Moses Moses and he said here am I and he
[34:16] said draw not hither uh uh nigh hither
[34:20] put off thy shoes from off thy feet for
[34:22] the place where on thou standest is Holy

[34:44] day one day at a time one step at a time
[34:47] one heartbeat at a time and they live
[34:49] their lives the way they live their
[34:50] lives and so many times we all live our
[34:53] lives the same way and that's the way
[34:56] the Lord intended us for to live our
[34:58] lives but you know as each year unfolds
[35:02] and starts into a new year it it starts
[35:05] getting people thinking normally most
[35:07] people think about and reflect upon what
[35:10] the last year held and and what the last
[35:13] year was for them and what it meant to
[35:14] them and what they went through and and
[35:16] all and and what they wanted to change
[35:18] maybe to come in the new year uh what do
[35:21] I want to change in my life for the new
[35:23] year a lot of times people call it a
[35:25] resolution a new New Year's resolution a
[35:28] lot of people make resolutions I don't
[35:30] know how much people do that anymore but
[35:32] used to be a big thing people would make
[35:34] resolutions I remember when I worked in
[35:36] Charlotte uh in office and people would
[35:39] come in the office the next day that
[35:40] they came in after a new year started
[35:43] and everybody had a re resolution they
[35:45] were going to do this they were going to
[35:46] change that and this is going to be
[35:48] better and this is going to be better
[35:49] and uh this is going to be different and
[35:52] everybody always had a resolution and of
[35:54] course by the time January basically
[35:56] faded out a lot of people had already uh
[36:00] had already uh lost that resolution they
[36:04] they they no longer were falling in that
[36:07] resolution whether to stop drinking or
[36:10] stop smoking or exercise more or go to
[36:12] church more or whatever it was uh
[36:15] everybody seemed to have some sort of a
[36:17] resolution something that they wanted
[36:20] when they started into the new year and
[36:22] and and there's nothing wrong with that
[36:23] Reflections good to start a new year and
[36:26] would I do different and what would I
[36:28] change and how would I want to make
[36:30] myself better or be better or uh how
[36:33] would I want to make other lives better
[36:35] other people uh have more quality of
[36:38] life something uh that that's different
[36:41] uh that that would change a person's
[36:43] life uh that would be something that
[36:46] would when that year ended they would
[36:48] reflect back on in and say I'm glad I
[36:50] did this and I'm glad I changed that and
[36:53] I'm glad I kept doing this or whatever
[36:55] and and made that sort of a resolution
[36:57] but you know uh I think that resolution
[37:01] or or it should be more than a
[37:03] resolution it should be something that's
[37:05] in our hearts as Christians but it
[37:07] should be that thing that brother
[37:08] brandham said that I'll read here as
[37:11] brother brandham preached in the stat of
[37:12] a perfect man he made this statement and
[37:15] I believe it's true I believe it's true
[37:17] for all of us as as we all ENT enter
[37:19] into a new year uh I believe this is
[37:22] important and it's pertinent for all of
[37:24] us uh brother Ram said see we've escaped
[37:28] now uh he's talking about uh uh Jesus
[37:32] addressing to the Church of scripture he
[37:34] had just read and that's why and that's
[37:36] why we're here this morning is to find
[37:39] out God's way what is God's requirements
[37:43] he says there's not a person in here
[37:45] that loves God but what wants to be more
[37:49] like Christ amen now I believe that's
[37:52] probably the best as we would still call
[37:54] it a resolution as anybody can have to
[37:57] want to become more like Christ and
[38:00] brother Bram giving the benefit of the
[38:02] doubt of course to everybody sitting
[38:04] there he prefaces obviously by saying
[38:07] that loves God uh any person here that
[38:10] loves God but want but what wants to
[38:14] become more like Christ amen more like
[38:18] Christ and that's probably the best
[38:20] thing that we could say about this today
[38:23] is that we want to become more like
[38:24] Christ that's the whole thing to have a
[38:27] closer walk with the Lord to be closer
[38:30] to him and in in in every way to become
[38:32] more like him amen now he said it's laid
[38:36] out here every Christian I'm an old
[38:38] veteran look at brother and sister kid
[38:40] here they're probably the oldest in the
[38:42] building but if I asked them what is
[38:44] your greatest heart's desire I'm sure
[38:47] it'd be to be closer to God when you
[38:50] learn of Christ there's something about
[38:52] him that so loving that you just try to
[38:56] get right into him amen just get right
[39:00] into him now there's something about us
[39:03] in every way in every year there's
[39:06] always the thing that we look at that
[39:07] was something that was of a significance
[39:10] in our lives that Drew us to the Lord
[39:13] and uh we read the account that Moses
[39:15] had Moses went through his life you know
[39:17] all about the supernatural thing of
[39:19] Moses life but this one event that took
[39:22] place that Drew Moses to God it was the
[39:25] one thing that that uh that was you
[39:28] could say was a an outstanding thing it
[39:31] was a miracle something Supernatural
[39:33] that had happened in Moses life because
[39:35] the Bush was burning looked like it was
[39:37] on fire but it was not being consumed so
[39:40] he decided that he would turn aside from
[39:43] everything else to go look at this bush
[39:45] to examine this bush to see what was
[39:47] going on with it and when God saw that
[39:51] he turned aside to go see the bush God
[39:53] then spoke to him God put Moses is in
[39:56] the position now a lot of times people
[39:59] say well I did this or I did that God
[40:02] always see man remember what brother Ram
[40:04] said brother Ram said man never went
[40:07] looking for God God has always come
[40:10] looking for man even from the beginning
[40:12] In the Garden of Eden when man and uh
[40:15] when when a man and woman fell uh and
[40:18] they tried to hide themselves or tried
[40:20] to separate themselves that God come
[40:22] down and he was looking for man it's
[40:24] been that way ever since God has always
[40:27] been looking for man so people could say
[40:29] I did this that no God always is the
[40:32] instigator God is always the one that
[40:35] starts the thing to bring us to a place
[40:38] that he can speak to us or show us
[40:41] something or some way to get our
[40:42] attention he used the burning bush to do
[40:45] that for Moses and when he got Moses's
[40:48] attention and Moses decided Moses had to
[40:52] make the conscious decision that I'm
[40:54] going to go and forget everything else
[40:56] I'm going to turn aside I'm going to
[40:58] shoe everything else and go to see what
[41:01] this bush is about and when he got there
[41:04] he stepped on the Holy Ground and God
[41:07] began to speak to him and when God begin
[41:10] to speak to him it's just like brother
[41:11] brandom said here it's when God gets a
[41:14] hold of your heart something takes place
[41:17] when God it's just something about him
[41:19] when God gets a hold of you and changes
[41:21] your life that brings you into him that
[41:24] wants you that makes you want want to
[41:26] desire more of him and then at that
[41:29] point when that Turning Point takes
[41:32] place then man begins to seek God man
[41:36] begins to read their Bible and pray and
[41:38] seek the Lord and trust God for
[41:40] everything that there have that they
[41:42] have need of by faith believing that
[41:44] that God is going to take care of them
[41:47] that that God is going to be with them
[41:48] so as we enter into a new year as we
[41:51] enter into
[41:52] 2024 we can know by faith that God is
[41:55] going to to be with us that God is going
[41:58] to take care of us we turn aside from
[42:00] everything else and we follow after him
[42:03] and that event that comes in our lives
[42:05] now in that our lives have been changed
[42:08] there's always events in our entire life
[42:12] that that cause us to continue to move
[42:14] forward to continue to grow closer to
[42:18] continue to become more like God there's
[42:21] always that something in our lives now
[42:23] it shouldn't take the turning over of a
[42:25] new year to do it but a lot of times
[42:27] again that reflection of the old year
[42:30] what could I have done different or what
[42:31] could I have changed or what could I
[42:33] have made better or how could I have
[42:34] been more like God or just anything that
[42:37] you can think that that would that would
[42:39] bring you forward into the new year I
[42:42] know a lot of us and our congregation is
[42:45] getting up in years and all of us are
[42:47] getting older but there's something
[42:50] still that drives us in our hearts that
[42:53] wants us to press forward and continue
[42:55] to to walk walk that walk that God has
[42:58] put before us the steps that God has
[43:00] ordered for us so that we can become
[43:03] more like him so that in our lives our
[43:05] lives can reflect Jesus Christ and just
[43:08] as Moses did at that time there at that
[43:12] place Moses became a new person we
[43:15] became new people and every day it's a
[43:18] renewal amen not just a new birth which
[43:22] we've talked about so much recently
[43:23] which is absolutely of the most
[43:26] importance because you can't have a
[43:27] renewal unless you have the new birth a
[43:30] renewal continually well this time of
[43:33] year we kind of reflects upon that that
[43:35] we kind of look back and say Lord what
[43:38] could we have done different what could
[43:40] we have done better how could we have
[43:41] been closer to you how could we have
[43:43] been more like you what can we do to
[43:45] change what can we do to get closer all
[43:48] those things go through our heads
[43:51] because because we love the Lord and as
[43:54] brother randam said I don't believe
[43:55] there's a a person out there or person
[43:57] in here that that that would say in your
[44:00] heart that you love God and that you
[44:02] want to get closer to God Amen look uh
[44:05] let's go over to Acts chapter
[44:10] N I want to look at Acts chapter n
[44:17] now Acts chapter n another story of a
[44:20] great man Moses got
[44:24] his Moses lived a good good life Moses
[44:26] was a good man raised in the hallowed
[44:29] Halls of Egypt and all that he went
[44:30] through now we going to talk about
[44:32] another man another another righteous
[44:34] man another man you couldn't put a a
[44:37] finger on his life a man that lived to
[44:41] every bit of of what the the the Torah
[44:45] the the the teachings of the high priest
[44:47] and all that they had that they had done
[44:49] had been through that lived it to a te a
[44:54] model Christian if you will he wasn't
[44:57] Christian obviously but
[45:00] uh a model of what uh would be
[45:04] considered uh a Pious Christian today
[45:08] amen Paul Saul Saul was a man that was
[45:12] that that was just like that but as Saul
[45:15] went through his life Saul thought he
[45:18] was doing great Saul thought he was I
[45:21] I'm sure Saul probably thought he was
[45:23] right dabbing the center of God's
[45:25] perfect will I imagine Saul probably
[45:28] thought that that he was doing God a
[45:31] service when he was going and putting
[45:32] out others that were of the way of of
[45:35] Jesus he was putting them out of he
[45:37] probably thought he was doing exactly
[45:39] what he was called to do he probably
[45:41] thought he was right Cent right dead
[45:43] center in the God's perfect will but God
[45:46] had something different for Saul amen
[45:49] chapter n Acts chapter 9 verse
[45:53] one and Saul yet breathing out
[45:56] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[45:59] Disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[46:01] priest now remember the scripture also
[46:03] says that they will kill you thinking
[46:06] that they're doing God of service right
[46:08] amen kill you now that doesn't mean they
[46:10] take a gun or a or a knife but they kill
[46:13] your character amen they use the tongue
[46:16] to kill a person's character is just as
[46:18] good as dead Jesus said you hate a
[46:22] brother without a cause you've murdered
[46:23] him already so
[46:26] here of obviously this day they would
[46:29] imprison them and kill them today they
[46:31] just imprison them and kill them with
[46:33] their tongues but it's the same result
[46:36] actually it's even worse amen even worse
[46:39] but see how he saw breathing out
[46:42] threatening as a Slaughter doing it as
[46:45] the scripture said that they would do it
[46:47] to you thinking that they're doing God a
[46:50] service we're doing God a service by by
[46:54] by slandering this person by ridiculing
[46:57] this person by belittling or putting
[46:59] this person we're doing God a service
[47:02] that's exactly what people think they
[47:04] believe they're in the middle of God's
[47:06] perfect will but Saul had something God
[47:09] had something in store for Saul second
[47:12] verse and desired of him letters to
[47:14] Damascus to the synagogue that if he
[47:17] found any of this way whether they were
[47:19] men or women he might bring them bound
[47:22] unto Jerusalem and as and as he
[47:26] journeyed he came near
[47:28] Damascus and suddenly there shine round
[47:32] about him a light from Heaven suddenly
[47:36] just like it was on the day of
[47:38] Pentecost remember the day of Pentecost
[47:41] suddenly there was a sound suddenly
[47:44] there was a cloud suddenly as they were
[47:46] sitting there the Holy Spirit came in
[47:49] there and lit upon each one of them
[47:52] suddenly just like here in the upper
[47:55] room did it to uh to Saul Paul who who
[47:59] didn't was not able to receive that
[48:01] Upper Room experience he received it
[48:04] here which proves that you did not have
[48:07] to be in the upper room at that time
[48:11] with 120 to receive an upper room
[48:14] experience amen and millions since his
[48:17] time have received an upper room
[48:20] experience by God suddenly coming into
[48:24] your life into your heart
[48:26] he suddenly there shine right around
[48:29] about him a light from heaven now Paul
[48:32] Saul was a smart man uh educated sat at
[48:36] the feet of Melia learned uh uh all the
[48:40] things brilliant smart man even talks
[48:43] about through the scripture how he could
[48:45] speak to the people with great swelling
[48:47] words of wisdom he could use his
[48:50] intellect to try to uh to try to Spur
[48:53] the intellect of people but he chose not
[48:55] to do that he chose to speak just calm
[48:59] and plain just like God gave it to him
[49:02] to reach down to the hearts of man not
[49:04] to their intellect he could have done it
[49:07] because he was a smart man intelligent
[49:09] man uh knew the Torah in and out knew
[49:11] the word in and out so when he saw this
[49:15] he knew there was something about it it
[49:18] all of a sudden struck his heart God saw
[49:22] in the middle of living what he I
[49:25] believe he believed was probably the
[49:27] perfect life that he could live under
[49:29] the high priest living that perfect life
[49:33] he believed that he could do this he
[49:36] believed that he could uh continue to
[49:38] lead that life but God had a different
[49:40] plan for for Saul God had a different
[49:43] plan for Paul even changed his name as
[49:46] we know God had a different plan so when
[49:49] that came amen
[49:52] notice Moses turned aside to see this
[49:56] great sight but God shined a light down
[50:00] upon Paul amen upon Saul and stopped him
[50:03] in his tracks and he heard a voice
[50:06] speaking and that voice said Saul Saul
[50:09] why persecutest thou me as he fell to
[50:13] the Earth amen as he as Saul fell to the
[50:16] Earth he heard that voice crying out
[50:19] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me now
[50:22] this was not an ignorant man smart man
[50:25] he could remember look in this in in his
[50:29] word in the Torah he could look and he
[50:32] could remember that same thing that same
[50:35] light that led the children of Israel
[50:37] out of Egypt is that light that's
[50:39] shining around him and he knew there was
[50:41] something about it and when it struck
[50:43] his heart when it struck his heart it
[50:45] was some a voice that spoke just like
[50:47] the voice spoke to Moses the boy spoke
[50:50] to Moses and said Moses this is Holy
[50:53] Ground take your shoes off he speaking
[50:55] to Saul and says Saul why are you
[50:57] persecuting me amen now Mo Saul spoke
[51:04] back and said who art thou Lord now he
[51:08] wasn't called just anything Lord he was
[51:11] too well talk too well schooled he was
[51:14] too much uh uh of a of a Godly Man at
[51:18] that point to called anything
[51:21] Lord uh again this was a righteous man
[51:24] this was a Saul is a godly man God just
[51:28] had to have took him on a Twist took him
[51:31] on a turn from where he was going so he
[51:34] knew that there was something about that
[51:36] you never would have he never would have
[51:38] called it Lord unless he knew that that
[51:40] was the same thing that he had read or
[51:42] knew of back in the old T back in back
[51:44] in his in the Torah he would have known
[51:48] that's why he says who art thou Lord
[51:51] Lord amen see that's a very significant
[51:54] word a lot of people people don't take a
[51:56] lot of credence to nowadays for some
[51:58] reasons it seems to be overused but the
[52:00] word Lord means that that that that Lord
[52:03] is Lord over you that Lord is your owner
[52:08] that Lord is your ruler that Lord is the
[52:12] person that you obey that's what Lord
[52:15] means that's extremely people say the
[52:18] Lord Jesus Christ that means Jesus
[52:21] Christ is our Lord so when he says Lord
[52:24] he's addressing him with reverence and
[52:26] humility Lord who art
[52:29] thou and he said I am Jesus whom thou
[52:33] persecutest it is hard for thee to kick
[52:36] against the Pricks and he trembling and
[52:39] astonished said Lord what Willl thou
[52:42] have me to do and the Lord said unto him
[52:44] arise and go into the City and it shall
[52:47] be told thee what thou must do simple
[52:50] conversation conversation between him
[52:52] and God didn't last a few seconds maybe
[52:55] a minute when he just said Lord what
[52:58] what would you have me to do see God had
[53:00] already gotten a hold of his heart
[53:03] already got his attention made him
[53:05] recognize you've been going along all of
[53:08] your life you've been doing all these
[53:10] great things you've learned and you've
[53:13] you you've you've studied and you know
[53:15] the Torah and Paul studied the Torah so
[53:19] much that he was even accused of being a
[53:21] crazy person for studying so much in the
[53:25] scripture I forgot who it was that
[53:27] accused Saul Paul of being a crazy man
[53:30] said you're going mad you you study too
[53:34] much you read too much you're going
[53:37] crazy Paul you need to stop some of that
[53:39] you need to cut back a little bit he
[53:41] says oh no no no I'm in my right mind I
[53:43] know exactly where I'm at amen he
[53:46] studied see he knew it so much God said
[53:49] okay it's time it's time for you to make
[53:52] that turn amen and Moses remember wrote
[53:55] most of the Old Testament amen you had
[53:58] of course the the the time and the laws
[54:00] and but Moses is the one that put the
[54:02] laws down Genesis Exodus Leviticus and
[54:04] all he's the one that Moses wrote as
[54:07] brother brandom said most of the Old
[54:09] Testament now Paul sa ended up having
[54:12] God changed his name to Paul ended up
[54:14] writing most of the New
[54:16] Testament because God had to have
[54:18] another a change for them something a
[54:21] turn amen and a lot of times a lot of us
[54:25] go through those things that we that
[54:27] that in our lives that we want to change
[54:30] that we want to do something whatever
[54:33] what we need to do to become more like
[54:36] God uh again the call today uh what what
[54:42] would we be willing to do or give up or
[54:45] whatever in our
[54:47] lives to become more like God to become
[54:51] closer to God of of what degree of
[54:55] importance is it to us uh to become more
[54:59] like God how important is it to us to
[55:02] become closer to God look I want to read
[55:05] you something brother brandom said
[55:11] here look he said now trying to do God a
[55:15] service streetport
[55:18] Louisiana this is one of the services of
[55:21] the Thanksgiving meetings there at Jack
[55:23] Moors in 1965
[55:25] November
[55:27] 1965 brother Bram says while every head
[55:30] is bowed every ey is closed all across
[55:32] the nation raise your hand here in the
[55:34] visible audience and out there too and
[55:36] I'll offer a prayer for you that's all I
[55:38] can do I cannot feel it God bless you I
[55:42] cannot feel it God bless you and you and
[55:44] you I cannot feel it God bless you hands
[55:47] going up he says visible audience
[55:49] everywhere feel it feel me Lord feel me
[55:53] thank you sister he's doing the call God
[55:55] God bless you Sister he says now uh I've
[55:57] caught the most of the sincere trying to
[56:00] be uh uh I want to raise my hands with
[56:04] you he said now listen he said oh Lord
[56:09] never let me come to a
[56:13] standstill amen that's
[56:16] important as brother bham was
[56:19] recognizing how easy it is for us to
[56:21] become
[56:23] complacent for us to come uh uh come to
[56:26] a standstill a place that we think well
[56:29] everything's great I'm doing fine
[56:31] everything's good uh I'm a good
[56:33] Christian I got a good family I got a
[56:35] good church and all these things got a
[56:37] good job all these things are great and
[56:39] just and just kind of get stagnant with
[56:41] the Lord to kind of come to a standstill
[56:43] with the Lord that's why the question
[56:46] then of what importance is it to us that
[56:50] we get closer to God in this new year
[56:53] how important is it to us that we walk a
[56:56] higher walk that we walk a closer walk
[56:59] of what importance is it brother R said
[57:01] Lord never let me come to a standstill
[57:03] so what does that mean that means that
[57:05] we always until we draw our last breath
[57:09] should be trying to walk more and more
[57:11] and more like the lord always growing
[57:15] always getting closer always getting uh
[57:18] uh bright in that brighter light that
[57:20] the Lord would shine upon us look now he
[57:23] says Lord let me never come to a
[57:26] standstill the importance again the
[57:29] importance of Lord let me grow in you
[57:33] this year amen Lord let me grow in you
[57:36] this year let me come closer to you this
[57:39] year whatever it is whatever it takes he
[57:42] says continually Lord let me stop not
[57:46] stop at one thing let me just move on
[57:50] Lord till I've completed everything that
[57:54] you Ed ordained me to complete praise
[57:57] the Lord I believe that should be all of
[57:59] our desires if there's if the Lord gives
[58:02] us breath in our bodies that the Lord
[58:04] has something for us to do if the Lord
[58:07] still got us uh viable and living and
[58:10] breathing and then then God God's not
[58:13] done with us God has something he wants
[58:16] us to do he says help me to complete
[58:21] everything that you ordained for me to
[58:24] do
[58:25] oh praise the Lord I say the same thing
[58:27] Lord help me regardless of the price
[58:32] regardless of the cost regardless of the
[58:35] criticism how hard the cross is I
[58:39] remember the cross that you bore Lord no
[58:41] matter how hard it is Lord help me to be
[58:44] able to fulfill everything that you
[58:46] wanted me to do wasn't easy wasn't easy
[58:50] for Paul here for Saul amen the first
[58:53] thing that happened to him look again we
[58:55] know first thing that happened to
[58:57] him Jesus told him arise it'll be told
[59:01] you what to do and the men which
[59:03] journeyed with him stood speechless
[59:05] hearing a voice but seeing no man they
[59:07] heard something but they didn't know
[59:08] what it was it was
[59:10] indistinguishable and Saul arose from
[59:12] the earth and when his eyes were open he
[59:15] saw no man God blinded him but they led
[59:18] him by the hand and brought him into
[59:20] Damascus now God's getting ready to do
[59:22] something to him amen and what is he
[59:25] doing he's sending somebody over to Saul
[59:29] to be able to speak to him to bring his
[59:32] his his vision to a place that's changed
[59:36] this had to be a drastic change things
[59:39] man remember Moses Moses left the
[59:42] hallowed Halls of Egypt to go out to
[59:44] become a shepherd and God is now going
[59:47] to call Moses back to Egypt to finish
[59:50] what he started could you
[59:52] imagine that
[59:55] uh is not is not hard to understand but
[1:00:00] sometimes that happens sometimes God
[1:00:02] will send you back to where you started
[1:00:04] to finish what you started amen and God
[1:00:08] had Moses started and God and and Moses
[1:00:11] spent 40 years back there and now God's
[1:00:12] sending him back to do it now God is
[1:00:15] having ananas to go speak to Saul so he
[1:00:18] can finish what God started in him amen
[1:00:23] he was there three days look now Mo uh
[1:00:26] uh Saul was there three days without
[1:00:29] water without uh drink or water without
[1:00:32] sight and neither did he eat nor drink
[1:00:35] and there was a certain disciple at
[1:00:37] Damascus named ananas said to him uh and
[1:00:41] to him said uh said the Lord in a vision
[1:00:45] ananas and he said behold I am here Lord
[1:00:49] the Lord said unto him arise and go into
[1:00:52] the street which is called straight and
[1:00:55] inquire in the house of Judas for one
[1:00:57] called Saul of Tarsus for behold he
[1:01:00] prayeth amen
[1:01:03] notice God made sure to let ananas know
[1:01:08] that Saul was in their preying amen
[1:01:11] because look and and has seen a vision
[1:01:15] and see God's trying to help ananas
[1:01:18] preface this visit with helping him
[1:01:21] understand because ananas knows what
[1:01:23] kind of man saw has
[1:01:25] been and I seen in a vision a man named
[1:01:28] ananas coming in and putting his hand on
[1:01:31] him that he might receive his
[1:01:34] sight then ananiah an ananas answered
[1:01:37] Lord I have heard by many of this man
[1:01:41] how much evil he hath done to thy Saints
[1:01:44] at Jerusalem now ananas saw what Saul
[1:01:47] was doing is evil but I I'm sure Saul
[1:01:52] like a lot of people believe what they
[1:01:54] were doing was in accordance to the will
[1:01:56] of the Lord right God's
[1:02:00] will ananas looked at it God obviously
[1:02:03] looked at it said I've seen what evil he
[1:02:06] has done to thy Saints at
[1:02:09] Jerusalem and I yeah and I'm sending you
[1:02:11] down there to go talk to him he probably
[1:02:14] didn't want to be within a 100 yards of
[1:02:16] salul uh and here Heath Authority from
[1:02:19] the chief priest to bind all that call
[1:02:22] on thy name but the Lord said unto him
[1:02:25] oh I like this part now the Lord said
[1:02:28] unto him go thy way for he is a chosen
[1:02:32] vessel praise the Lord aren't you glad
[1:02:35] to be a chosen vessel of the Lord amen
[1:02:39] he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my
[1:02:43] name before the Gentiles and Kings and
[1:02:46] the children of Israel for I will show
[1:02:50] him how great things he must suffer for
[1:02:53] my name name sake God is going to show
[1:02:57] him and and try to ease anan's mind that
[1:03:03] he could go down and speak to Saul that
[1:03:05] he could pray for Saul that Saul would
[1:03:07] get his vision back what happened when
[1:03:09] Saul got his vision back God changed his
[1:03:12] name God changed his name to Paul which
[1:03:15] meant that the guy that was there before
[1:03:17] is no longer alive that man died Saul is
[1:03:21] dead and Paul took his place and Paul's
[1:03:25] a new man revised in the Lord with a
[1:03:28] revelation of Jesus Christ and the truth
[1:03:31] of the word for his day so he knew that
[1:03:34] God was doing a work and God also said
[1:03:36] even through this I will show him what
[1:03:39] he must suffer for my name's sake now I
[1:03:41] got one more
[1:03:43] scripture Philippians chapter
[1:03:50] 3
[1:03:52] amen chapter uh uh Philippians chapter
[1:03:57] 3 look
[1:04:01] now the seventh
[1:04:04] seal as we finish this up here the
[1:04:07] seventh seal brother bam says and I'm
[1:04:09] sure that you've noticed the things
[1:04:11] that's been happening this week of
[1:04:13] course quite a event there with the
[1:04:16] seals opening I'm sure you noticed that
[1:04:19] little Collins boy laying there dying
[1:04:21] the other night that little uh leukemia
[1:04:24] girl God is still a supernatural being
[1:04:28] amen heals leukemia heals the little boy
[1:04:31] dying amen how much more could he heal a
[1:04:34] need or heal any situation that you're
[1:04:37] going through the kingdom of God is
[1:04:39] coming and it's becoming more from the
[1:04:42] negative to the positive as it has been
[1:04:46] well look Saint if he said this 1963
[1:04:49] March
[1:04:50] 1963 that it's becoming more the kingdom
[1:04:53] of God coming more from the negative to
[1:04:56] the positive all the time what should
[1:04:58] that do to
[1:04:59] us what should that cause in our lives
[1:05:03] what should it speak to us about if the
[1:05:06] kingdom of God is coming more negative
[1:05:08] to positive all the time how should that
[1:05:10] affect us how should we want more and
[1:05:14] more to become more of the from the
[1:05:17] negative to the positive all the time
[1:05:19] and what does that mean that means that
[1:05:21] this life is a shadow of his it's a NE
[1:05:24] negative of his his is the positive
[1:05:26] we're moving from that negative from
[1:05:29] that uh uh uh from that shadow into that
[1:05:33] light into that positive where Heaven
[1:05:36] and Earth embrace one another where we
[1:05:39] as a people of God are changed and
[1:05:42] raptured into a new whole
[1:05:44] dimension praise the
[1:05:46] Lord praise God you know brother random
[1:05:50] said if you want more of God there's
[1:05:52] more of God for you so if there's a
[1:05:55] thirst there to desire for more of God
[1:05:57] that just proves that there's more of
[1:05:59] God for
[1:06:00] you it's becoming more from the negative
[1:06:03] to the positive as it has been and he
[1:06:06] said now now that ought not choke people
[1:06:10] from justification to sanctification to
[1:06:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost here it is
[1:06:14] see we're drawing just closer just
[1:06:19] drawing closer to God all the time just
[1:06:24] drawing closer to God all the
[1:06:28] time we can make it a resolution we can
[1:06:30] make it whatever we want sin but the
[1:06:33] fact is that our desires our heart's
[1:06:35] desires and as we come into a new year
[1:06:38] would should be to want to be more like
[1:06:41] God to be closer to God of course if you
[1:06:44] come closer to God you're going to be
[1:06:45] more like God Amen can't help to do that
[1:06:49] you get to the place to just in a in the
[1:06:51] natural uh when you get a married couple
[1:06:54] couple together they start spending more
[1:06:56] and more time together the more time
[1:06:58] they get together the more they become
[1:07:00] to be like each other uh I've heard and
[1:07:03] thankful for my wife uh it hasn't
[1:07:05] happened but people say that couples
[1:07:08] even start to come to look like each
[1:07:09] other amen physically again I'm sure
[1:07:14] she's happy that hasn't happened in our
[1:07:16] marriage but uh a lot of people that's
[1:07:18] what that they start not just acting
[1:07:20] like each other or coming together like
[1:07:23] same but start looking like each other
[1:07:26] well if that's just something that
[1:07:28] people observe medically or
[1:07:29] scientifically or whatever in the
[1:07:31] natural world what would it be for God
[1:07:33] and his children spiritually to become
[1:07:37] more like him to look more like him to
[1:07:39] become more In His Image my my look
[1:07:42] Philippians now chapter 3 we'll close
[1:07:45] with this Philippians
[1:07:47] 3 verse
[1:07:49] 7 but what things look Paul's now saying
[1:07:53] all the that the L Lord had put him
[1:07:56] through all that he had done and all
[1:07:58] that things that had happened in his
[1:08:00] life but what things were gained to me
[1:08:04] those I counted for I counted loss for
[1:08:09] Christ amen might have been something
[1:08:12] that happened good to him or good for
[1:08:14] him but those things he counted lost for
[1:08:17] Jesus Christ amen mine yet doubt yay
[1:08:22] doubtless and I count all all things but
[1:08:24] lost for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:08:26] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:08:29] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:08:32] count them but dung that I may win
[1:08:37] Christ praise the Lord in Christ alone
[1:08:41] will I glory amen yes though I could
[1:08:45] pride myself in battles won
[1:08:49] amen and be found ninth verse and be
[1:08:52] found in him not having my own
[1:08:55] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:08:57] that which is through the Faith of
[1:08:59] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:09:03] by faith that I may know him amen that I
[1:09:09] may know him and the power of his
[1:09:12] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:09:15] sufferings be made conformable unto his
[1:09:17] death now here's the here's the scary
[1:09:20] part here's the here's that part that
[1:09:22] brother bam warned against becoming
[1:09:25] stagnant or or or at a standstill as he
[1:09:28] called it that thing that people think
[1:09:31] they've reached to this certain place
[1:09:33] they've reached to this certain level
[1:09:35] they've gotten this certain Revelation
[1:09:37] or whatever it is and and and they just
[1:09:40] stay there and they become complacent in
[1:09:43] that instead of continually moving
[1:09:45] forward in
[1:09:48] Christ look now if by any means I might
[1:09:52] attain unto the res resurrection of the
[1:09:55] Dead not as though I had already
[1:09:57] attained either were already perfect but
[1:10:01] at but I follow after if that I may
[1:10:05] apprehend that for which also I am
[1:10:08] apprehended of Christ
[1:10:10] Jesus Brethren I count not myself to
[1:10:14] have
[1:10:15] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:10:19] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:10:21] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:10:24] which are
[1:10:26] before I press toward the mark for the
[1:10:29] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:10:32] Christ Jesus amen what a great
[1:10:35] resolution you want a resolution at all
[1:10:38] something that you're going to stick to
[1:10:40] stay with that's going to become a part
[1:10:42] of your life let that be it amen it's
[1:10:46] hard to do and of course all the
[1:10:49] negative and all the worse and all the
[1:10:50] hard all those things that are bad
[1:10:53] Satan's going to to continually try to
[1:10:55] bring them up before you and throw them
[1:10:56] in your face every mistake you made
[1:10:59] everything you may have thought bad
[1:11:01] whatever it might have been the devil's
[1:11:02] going to always try to Drudge that stuff
[1:11:04] up but Paul said with the great wisdom
[1:11:07] of God forgetting those things which are
[1:11:11] behind I pressed toward a few hours
[1:11:14] we're starting a new year now pressing
[1:11:17] forward forward Not Looking Back
[1:11:20] remember what the Bible says about
[1:11:21] looking back dog to its wallow
[1:11:26] uh a dog to its vomit pressing forward
[1:11:30] amen pressing forward to the
[1:11:34] calling the High Calling of Christ
[1:11:39] Jesus that should be every one of our
[1:11:41] calls
[1:11:42] today amen for a high calling for a
[1:11:46] higher walk for a closer walk with the
[1:11:48] Lord to become closer to the Lord Jesus
[1:11:51] as this year continues to to as wind
[1:11:56] down as the New Year ushers in to become
[1:12:00] more like him should be all of our
[1:12:03] desires to be closer to him whatever it
[1:12:07] takes the Lord has brought us along Long

[1:12:45] Year's
[1:12:47] resolution whatever you want to say
[1:12:49] about it call it it's
[1:12:52] inconsequential the result results is
[1:12:53] what
[1:12:54] matters the results is what matters what
