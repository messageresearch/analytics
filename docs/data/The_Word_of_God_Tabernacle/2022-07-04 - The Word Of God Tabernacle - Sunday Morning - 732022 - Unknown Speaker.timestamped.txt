[10:50] appreciate the lord helped us to have a
[10:51] good time and

[11:19] the lord glory and praise for that
[11:22] being with us and watching over us amen
[11:24] let's stand to our feet now if we could
[11:26] go to the scripture we're going to go
[11:28] back where we left off last week
[11:32] amen
[11:34] hebrews chapter 10
[11:38] hebrews chapter 10 actually left off
[11:40] with hebrews 12.
[11:42] but we're going to start back at hebrews
[11:44] chapter 10 which is kind of the
[11:48] basis of where our thought came from on
[11:50] this message of willing versus deceived
[11:53] or willfully versus deceived
[11:58] amen so we'll try to lord willing we'll
[11:59] just try to pick up where we are they
[12:01] are willing versus disease this be part
[12:04] two
[12:05] amen but again hebrews chapter 10
[12:08] uh we're going to begin reading with
[12:10] verse
[12:13] 24.
[12:18] amen hebrews 10
[12:20] verse 24.

[13:18] that we come here for believing that
[13:20] you're going to speak to us now from
[13:22] your word lord you're going to show us

[14:44] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[14:46] pray
[14:47] amen amen
[14:49] amen hebrews chapter 10
[14:51] uh we'll begin reading with verse 24
[14:55] amen and let us consider one another to
[14:57] provoke unto love and to good works
[15:01] not forsaking the assembling of
[15:02] ourselves together as the manner of some
[15:05] is but exhorting one another and so much
[15:08] the more as we see that day approaching
[15:11] for if we sin willfully after that we
[15:13] have received the knowledge of the truth
[15:16] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[15:19] sins
[15:20] but a certain fearful looking for a
[15:22] judgment
[15:23] for for of judgment and firing
[15:26] indignation we shall devour the
[15:28] adversaries amen you can be seated if
[15:31] you'd like
[15:33] [Music]
[15:38] so
[15:38] again continuing somewhat where we left
[15:42] off last week amen and examining the uh
[15:45] thought that the lord had given me on on
[15:47] the difference between
[15:49] willfully doing something or being
[15:51] deceived into doing something uh or
[15:54] willfully versus deception we went to
[15:57] adam and eve last week which of course
[15:59] began the
[16:00] the beginning of it in the bible and the
[16:02] whole creation as we know it falling
[16:05] under this uh that we see in the
[16:07] differentiation that god placed between
[16:10] adam and eve uh he put that
[16:12] differentiation over in timothy as well
[16:15] to let us know that
[16:16] one was of the word and the other was
[16:18] not the one was deceived and the other
[16:21] could not be deceived amen we recognize
[16:24] adam as the word could not be deceived
[16:26] because the word cannot be deceived
[16:28] the deception was what brought the
[16:30] transgression amen not the
[16:33] not the stepping out of again like i
[16:35] said that that i felt was uh that was
[16:39] that was more of a righteous act
[16:41] actually even though it was a
[16:42] transgression or even though it was
[16:44] against what god had told adam he did it
[16:46] to go save life to preserve his wife and
[16:49] to bring his wife back to himself uh so
[16:52] he did it knowing what he was doing and
[16:55] then she did it because she was deceived
[16:57] into doing it but the deception came
[17:01] because of the lack of there being a
[17:04] in a original creation or the word
[17:07] herself
[17:09] now that propagates us to back to uh
[17:12] hebrews chapter 10 and hopefully lord
[17:16] willing takes us on a little further
[17:18] i go back to this scripture
[17:21] because i kind of felt like i went
[17:23] through it probably a little faster last
[17:25] week than maybe i should have and
[17:28] hope i didn't leave any lingering
[17:31] misunderstandings or
[17:33] questions or things that uh troubled you
[17:36] about it but
[17:37] maybe the lord willing would try to
[17:39] because the rest of this
[17:41] that i want to get into today
[17:43] really should be brought
[17:46] with what we preached on last week so we
[17:48] have to
[17:49] we have to bring last week into this
[17:51] week to be able to finish this up
[17:54] because all of it runs together and if
[17:56] we can't see how the progression of that
[17:58] happens and what we are in christ and
[18:01] what we uh mean to him what he means to
[18:04] us and us being in him and him being in
[18:06] us which he said when he was here
[18:09] uh if we can't grasp or understand that
[18:11] or have a revelation i should say of
[18:14] that that what that means to us in our
[18:16] lives and really it's pretty difficult
[18:18] to struggle with
[18:20] it's kind of like the difference between
[18:22] law and grace
[18:23] and a lot of the christian domain and
[18:26] christian religion today
[18:28] have done away with law they the the
[18:31] law's been done away with well it has in
[18:34] an aspect but then it hasn't otherwise
[18:37] and i don't want to get into that
[18:38] because that's a whole nother 6 8 10 12
[18:40] 15 sermons but
[18:42] it's kind of like that and if you can't
[18:44] grasp the understanding of what it is to
[18:47] be a child of god and to be born again
[18:50] and have the holy spirit living in you
[18:52] and through you to understand
[18:55] scripturally uh
[18:57] the incompleteness of that fulfillment
[19:00] then it's really hard to understand this
[19:02] all
[19:03] right so if i can't lay down the
[19:05] foundation well enough for us
[19:08] understanding the completeness of that
[19:11] new birth and what it really means to us
[19:13] and and then it becomes a struggle to us
[19:16] so
[19:17] it brings us here then to hebrews
[19:19] chapter 10
[19:21] and of course verse 26 for if we sin
[19:24] willfully
[19:25] after that we have received the
[19:27] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[19:29] no more sacrifice for sins now i went
[19:32] into this a little bit of detail last
[19:34] week and i want to again revisit that
[19:37] maybe a little slower maybe a little
[19:39] more in a teaching vein uh than kind of
[19:43] preaching and rushing through it last
[19:44] week but if we sin willfully now we know
[19:47] what sin is sin is unbelief sin is a
[19:51] transgression sin is to miss the mark
[19:55] and and
[19:57] he's saying here that if we sin
[19:59] willfully or we purposely uh we of our
[20:03] own accord we wanted to
[20:06] uh
[20:08] uh transgress that or sin willfully or
[20:11] turn our back on and then walk away from
[20:13] it
[20:14] willfully
[20:16] that willfully is purposefully
[20:19] knowledgeably of your own accord of your
[20:22] own free will you've received this
[20:25] now i've used that as
[20:28] also a
[20:29] an example that brother branham gave us
[20:31] about the holy ghost
[20:33] uh he said
[20:35] you know he talked to it with uh
[20:38] lee vale and and in himself and he
[20:41] prayed about it and and all these things
[20:43] that people have well the initial
[20:45] evidence of the holy ghost is speaking
[20:47] in tongues well it can't be that because
[20:49] that's just a simple gift of the spirit
[20:51] that you don't even have to be born
[20:52] again to have right
[20:54] well the most perfect evidence you can
[20:57] think of is love what brother brahma
[20:58] said there's a lot of the kind old
[21:00] priests and brother bran brother
[21:03] in jesus day that would have outdone and
[21:05] outshined jesus and made into one
[21:08] there's a lot of kind old priests and
[21:10] out there today they
[21:12] buddhists oh my if you want to go just
[21:14] on love alone
[21:16] uh the buddhist probably outshines the
[21:18] christians into one
[21:21] amen because but that's but that's all
[21:23] they have
[21:24] that's all they have to give and and
[21:26] they give it as an affilio and not an
[21:28] agape love right because it's not a love
[21:31] from god but
[21:32] uh so you think well that can't be it he
[21:34] thought well brother branham still i'll
[21:36] just stick with that for a little bit
[21:37] and then the lord straightened him out
[21:40] brother branham said the holy ghost came
[21:42] and straightened me out on this
[21:45] god told brother branham to an angel
[21:48] through that messenger that it was not
[21:51] speaking in tongues it was not love it
[21:54] wasn't all these other things it was the
[21:56] ability to be able to receive the word
[21:59] of the day amen to receive the word
[22:03] now that's a different than a drunkard
[22:05] sitting on the back pew and coming in
[22:08] and listening and walking out you say
[22:09] hey man did you enjoy that oh yeah that
[22:11] was a good sermon by the preachers and
[22:14] he's well where you going now well
[22:15] there's a bar open down here i'm going
[22:16] to go get drunk
[22:19] would he did he receive anything
[22:22] he heard it
[22:23] he may have been able to quote it he may
[22:25] have even been telling his buddies about
[22:27] it down at the bar but did he receive it
[22:30] see you have to receive something when
[22:33] you receive something it becomes a part
[22:35] of you
[22:36] it's like i've used the analogy to pick
[22:38] a pen
[22:39] i could take a pen and put it in any one
[22:41] of your labs
[22:42] and you could look at that pen but see i
[22:44] give you that pen but
[22:46] it's not yours until you actually take
[22:48] it and put and take ownership of it and
[22:50] start using it and put it in your coat
[22:52] pocket and take it home with you that's
[22:55] when you receive it to yourself just
[22:57] because it dumps up in your life doesn't
[22:59] mean you received it but this says that
[23:01] the people that are sinning willfully
[23:04] have received that knowledge they've
[23:07] actually received it to themselves and
[23:09] they've decided willfully purposefully
[23:12] to turn their back on it right
[23:15] to sin willfully after having received
[23:18] it now how many times does this happen
[23:21] after having received the knowledge of
[23:22] truth there remaineth no more sacrifice
[23:26] for sin
[23:27] no more sacrifice from sin as i said
[23:30] last week paul put it in the way that
[23:32] people
[23:33] claim the grace of god the grace and god
[23:34] of people go the grace of god the grace
[23:36] of god is the most outstanding thing
[23:38] we'll ever know in our lives the grace
[23:40] of god that is prominent and permanent
[23:42] in our lives that grace
[23:44] is bountiful goes beyond anything that
[23:46] we can imagine but there is a place
[23:49] where you can take that grace of god and
[23:51] make a disgrace out of it by
[23:54] willfully sinning after receiving the
[23:57] knowledge and walking and turning away
[23:59] from it
[24:01] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[24:03] sin what happens the sacrifice is
[24:06] removed at that point we talked about
[24:08] crossing that line
[24:10] brother bantam told that little girl or
[24:13] that that young lady
[24:14] this may be your last chance
[24:16] and she didn't come up and afterwards
[24:18] you remember the story we talked about
[24:20] it brother mentions it three or four
[24:22] times and in the messages he talks about
[24:25] how he met this lady out on the street
[24:26] and uh she's smoking drinking and
[24:29] offered him a drink offered him to smoke
[24:31] and he said you should be ashamed of
[24:33] yourself he said you know parson you
[24:35] told me that could have been my last
[24:37] chance she said it was
[24:39] she said after that time i could now see
[24:42] my mother's soul fried in hell like a
[24:45] pancake and it wouldn't bother me
[24:47] you want a drink want to smoke see
[24:49] that's where she had gotten right she
[24:51] had that chance sinning willfully no
[24:54] more sacrifice when adam sinned when
[24:58] adam fell
[24:59] there was a sacrifice that was given god
[25:02] gave adam a sacrifice
[25:05] he took the sheepskin the sheep he
[25:07] killed them and threw the sheepskin in
[25:09] for adam and eve to be able to walk out
[25:11] into his presence god provided a
[25:14] sacrifice for him but it wasn't the
[25:16] ultimate sacrifice thus he still paid
[25:19] the penalty for his actions
[25:22] and all of creation has paid the penalty
[25:24] ever since
[25:26] but he did receive a sacrifice an
[25:28] ability to be able to come in uh uh out
[25:32] from the bush again a way that god could
[25:35] wink at that ignorance he no longer
[25:38] weaks in ignorance but but a time where
[25:41] by god's accepted way through the death
[25:44] of an innocent one that god accepted
[25:47] that person and winked at that ignorance
[25:49] but that sin remained
[25:52] that sin was still there because all the
[25:54] blood of the bull and the goat did was
[25:56] just cover that sin right that's all it
[25:59] did
[26:00] now i could take uh i could take this
[26:03] bottle of water and i could cover it up
[26:05] of course the duct cover completely had
[26:06] to cover my phone up
[26:08] you said well is there a phone there
[26:10] i don't know i just covered it up does
[26:12] anybody know if there's a phone is the
[26:13] phone still there
[26:15] a magician would come and it would be
[26:17] gone maybe i don't know that's the works
[26:18] of the devil anyway but i could cover
[26:21] that up but see the phone is still there
[26:23] even though i covered it up and you
[26:25] might not be able to see it it's still
[26:27] there
[26:28] and that's all there all the blood of
[26:29] the bulls and ghosts it was just cover
[26:31] that but it was still there right the
[26:34] the consciousness of it was still there
[26:36] the thought of it was still there the
[26:38] desire of it was still there
[26:40] so there had to be something come that
[26:42] was a greater sacrifice to annihilate
[26:46] that sin so that the man has no more
[26:49] conscience of the sin amen amen no more
[26:53] conscience of the sin which we'll get to
[26:55] in a little bit
[26:56] that there would be no more conscience
[26:57] of sin
[26:59] there then
[27:00] when there's conscience
[27:03] when there's that that's before the new
[27:05] birth because remember that's that's the
[27:06] dividing point a person that is born
[27:09] again and a person that is not born
[27:11] again that's the dividing point
[27:14] that sins willfully
[27:16] they said well i just
[27:18] do whatever i want not go to the
[27:20] confessional booth or uh say the hail
[27:22] mary's or whatever it is or or or or
[27:25] even in charismatic or even in the
[27:26] message well i just do whatever i want
[27:28] god will forgive me anyway
[27:31] i just live however won't god will
[27:32] forgive me anyway you're willfully
[27:34] purposely walking out with that attitude
[27:36] with that heart
[27:38] well that's exactly like we were talking
[27:40] about with um
[27:42] esau last week
[27:44] that's the exact same thing esau had in
[27:46] his heart
[27:47] that's the exact same way esau
[27:49] approached it again hebrews chapter 12.
[27:52] i'll read it again to you
[27:55] hebrews chapter 12
[27:56] of verse 15. looking diligently lest any
[28:00] man fell the grace of god lest any root
[28:02] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[28:04] and thereby
[28:05] many be defiled
[28:07] lest there be any fornicator or profane
[28:10] person as esau
[28:13] who
[28:14] so the bible's calling esau
[28:16] a fornicator and profane person
[28:19] like esau or as esau who for one morsel
[28:23] of me sold his birthright so what made
[28:26] him a profane person that he did not
[28:28] value that birthright
[28:30] the birthright to esau meant nothing to
[28:33] him
[28:34] and that's what that's what made him a
[28:36] profane person
[28:39] for one morsel he sold of meat he sold
[28:42] his birthright for ye know how that
[28:45] afterward listen now again like we said
[28:48] last week afterward when he would have
[28:51] inherited the blessing
[28:54] when he would have inherited or when he
[28:57] would have gotten his birthright
[29:00] that's when he desired
[29:02] to repent
[29:04] see
[29:05] afterward when he would have inherited
[29:07] the blessing he was rejected
[29:11] for he found no place of repentance
[29:13] though he sought it carefully with tears
[29:15] people say well how could god if someone
[29:18] carefully is looking to repent with
[29:20] tears how could god reject that
[29:22] sacrifice how could god reject that
[29:24] because because the repentance that was
[29:27] offered by esau was not sincere right
[29:32] he offered his repentance
[29:35] based solely
[29:37] on the fact that he was sad or mad or
[29:40] upset about not receiving the birthright
[29:43] he wasn't upset about his wrongdoing he
[29:46] wasn't repenting of his wrongdoing he
[29:48] was repenting because he got caught
[29:52] he did what was wrong and he had to pay
[29:55] the price for it
[29:57] that's why he was repenting
[29:59] it's like it's like i said last week my
[30:01] wife says all the time
[30:04] people get caught they come out and you
[30:06] see them that oh i'm sorry oh i didn't
[30:08] mean to do that everybody's sorry when
[30:09] they get caught
[30:11] oh i didn't mean to kill those hundred
[30:13] people
[30:15] over the past 50 years
[30:18] well you know you could have stopped at
[30:19] the first one if you really didn't want
[30:20] to do it but see people are they're only
[30:23] repenting a lot of times only repentant
[30:26] when they get caught or when they have
[30:28] to pay the penalty when they have to pay
[30:30] the price so their repentance isn't
[30:32] based on the sorrowfulness of their
[30:34] actions it's based on the fact that
[30:36] they're having to pay the price for it
[30:38] now
[30:39] now they're sorry
[30:41] they're remorseful now that's where esau
[30:43] was that's not the kind of repentance
[30:46] god's looking for that's not the kind of
[30:48] repentance that god accepts that's why
[30:50] he sought it tearfully because he lost
[30:53] his birthright was where the tears were
[30:55] coming from
[30:57] his tears weren't coming because he
[30:59] loved the lord his tears were coming
[31:01] because he lost his birthright that's
[31:03] where the tears were coming from
[31:05] and he said those tears of sorrowfulness
[31:09] because he was repenting well he wasn't
[31:11] repenting
[31:13] in his heart
[31:14] he wasn't sorrowful for what he had done
[31:16] see because the scripture says
[31:19] afterwards when he realized
[31:22] that he wasn't inheriting the blessing
[31:25] that's when he started repenting
[31:28] it's the same thing for a lot of people
[31:30] they expect to receive something from
[31:32] god but where is their heart because
[31:34] that's that's what god accepts
[31:36] the words are fine the actions are fine
[31:38] the altar is fine but where is the heart
[31:41] because that's what god pays attention
[31:43] to
[31:44] if you're repenting are you repenting
[31:46] because you got caught are you repenting
[31:48] because you're afraid you're going to go
[31:49] to hell are you repenting because you
[31:51] love the lord jesus and you never want
[31:54] to do anything else to ever hurt him
[31:55] again
[31:56] and that's your heart's desire right
[31:59] not that you might not slip make a
[32:00] mistake but your heart's desire
[32:03] now this only comes to a new birth then
[32:06] your heart's desire is to never hurt him
[32:08] again
[32:09] now look this is what brother adam says
[32:11] about his about him and his wife
[32:15] this is a questions and answer series in
[32:17] uh uh of may of 1962
[32:20] he said i'm not true listen now and and
[32:23] listen to this in comparison to esau
[32:26] story i am not true to my wife because
[32:30] i'm afraid she'll divorce me
[32:32] i'm true to her because i love her
[32:36] it's that simple
[32:38] amen people
[32:40] they might repent or they go to church
[32:42] they do a little penance or whatever it
[32:43] is just based on the fact that they that
[32:46] they're afraid to get caught or they got
[32:49] caught or whatever the situ not because
[32:51] they love god
[32:52] not because they're truly sorrowful for
[32:55] their actions
[32:56] that's then that's true repentance from
[32:58] the heart see brother graham says i
[33:00] don't do this because i'm afraid she'll
[33:02] divorce me i do it because i love her
[33:05] and there's your bottom line
[33:07] there's no other woman in the world but
[33:09] her that's the reason i'm true to her
[33:12] i if i've done a mistake
[33:14] and i thought i did something wrong come
[33:17] to her say me to honey honey i didn't
[33:20] mean to do that she'd forgive me
[33:23] i know she would i'd forgive her because
[33:26] i love her i'd forgive her she'd forgive
[33:29] me but i wouldn't do it for nothing in
[33:31] the world because i love her too much
[33:34] amen
[33:35] now you've got a relationship
[33:38] that's
[33:39] man and wife that's that's filial love
[33:41] that's humanity that's not even that
[33:44] that
[33:45] it is a type it's a shadow
[33:47] of of approaching the kind of love and
[33:51] affinity and affection there is between
[33:53] god and man or between god and you let's
[33:56] make it personal
[33:58] between god and you this is approaching
[34:01] that
[34:02] but this is just a man and a woman
[34:05] in our humanity in our filial love if
[34:08] feeling of love will make a man or woman
[34:10] act that way towards one another what do
[34:12] you think it is then with the love of
[34:14] god amen the agape unconditional love of
[34:18] god yes wow
[34:20] powerful
[34:21] but that's how much he loves you
[34:24] but that is also how much we should love
[34:27] him
[34:28] and if we love him like that then we
[34:31] conduct our lives that way
[34:33] we live our lives with that in that
[34:36] capacity
[34:38] because that's where our love is
[34:40] amen a lot of times it's desires in life
[34:43] that drive people
[34:45] most people
[34:47] people most of the time they do what
[34:48] they want to do
[34:50] no matter what they say oh i meant to or
[34:53] i should have or i going to or
[34:56] most people are going to do whatever
[34:58] they want to do
[34:59] and that comes to christianity that
[35:01] comes to come at a church that comes to
[35:03] living their lives right that comes to
[35:05] everything most people are just going to
[35:08] do whatever they want to do
[35:10] and that's usually what it boils down to
[35:13] but
[35:14] but a true born-again christian
[35:18] is not concerned about what they want
[35:20] they're concerned about what he wants
[35:22] yes they're not concerned about pleasing
[35:24] themselves they're concerned about
[35:26] pleasing the lord
[35:28] and and again just in a small now he
[35:31] doesn't put it in here i'm going to
[35:32] finish this quote in a minute but to put
[35:34] it in a natural perspective again
[35:37] uh
[35:38] i lived my life
[35:41] and i
[35:42] and i i lived it in a way as a as a
[35:44] young man and going to school and
[35:46] everything i did and driving around and
[35:49] the places i went and the things i did
[35:51] and
[35:52] and the friends i kept and all that i
[35:54] did as a young man and and and my
[35:57] concern was to numero uno
[36:00] it was me
[36:01] that was my concern
[36:03] then i met my wife
[36:06] who became my wife
[36:08] then i met sonia and things changed
[36:11] slowly now it didn't all happen at once
[36:16] the desires of my life became what's
[36:18] going to make her happy
[36:20] the desires of my life became how can i
[36:23] fulfill or make her life better
[36:26] amen
[36:28] if you've been married you know what i'm
[36:29] talking about
[36:30] your whole desire is now
[36:33] falling in that capacity towards that
[36:36] person now again that's just a natural
[36:38] effect of of a greater
[36:41] stronger power of god pulling us to him
[36:46] but my desire then and as we got married
[36:48] and got older and had kids
[36:51] our desires became
[36:53] what can i do to make her happy
[36:56] i mean friend i i'll just be honest with
[36:59] you i i was a mama's boy
[37:01] i was a spoiled rotten brat although i
[37:04] would fight my own my sister tooth and
[37:06] nail when she called me that
[37:08] i was i was youngest i was eight years
[37:12] difference i was full of breath i i i
[37:15] could walk in the door and shed every
[37:16] piece of clothes and walk into the
[37:18] shower my mother would pick every piece
[37:20] up she wouldn't tell me to do it i
[37:23] didn't do that but i could
[37:25] she would have picked every i i i i used
[37:28] uh a i used a towel throw it on the
[37:31] floor and just
[37:32] my room was a mess and
[37:35] all those
[37:36] things is
[37:38] just a mess i didn't even learn how to
[37:40] toast bread
[37:42] i probably could boil water but i
[37:45] couldn't boil an egg because i didn't
[37:46] know how long to boil it for
[37:48] i bowl an egg you'd probably take it
[37:50] down the bowling alley here use it
[37:52] that's because i didn't know any
[37:54] honestly i was spoiled i didn't know
[37:56] anything
[37:58] i really still don't hardly but
[38:00] uh but that's her fault now but but as i
[38:04] got as we got married
[38:06] i i no longer left my clothes thrown out
[38:08] all over the place because i knew what
[38:10] it
[38:10] because i knew that did make her happy
[38:13] she's not my maid she's not my footstool
[38:16] she's my mate
[38:17] she's my wife i love her
[38:20] and then picking up my junk is going to
[38:22] make her health happier picking up my
[38:24] clothes and that's going to make her
[38:26] happier then that's what i'm going to do
[38:29] and
[38:30] she probably knows it as much as anybody
[38:32] i've changed
[38:34] drastically from the time i met her to
[38:37] the time we got married and even after
[38:39] that because you learn
[38:41] you learn and see it became more about
[38:44] her than it did about me
[38:46] before i met her it was all about me
[38:48] after i met her the more and more i got
[38:50] to know her the more and more i wanted
[38:51] to be with him the more and more i loved
[38:53] her the more and more i wanted her to be
[38:54] happy the more my life changed
[38:59] and the same thing happens as a
[39:00] christian
[39:02] in a greater way of course
[39:04] because you realize who where your love
[39:07] really lies and it's to the lord you
[39:09] don't want to do anything to ever hurt
[39:11] him no you don't come to church or pay
[39:14] your tithes or
[39:16] have your prayer time or read your bible
[39:18] you don't do all those things just
[39:19] because you're trying to dodge hell
[39:22] you do it because you love the lord
[39:25] you don't live the life you live because
[39:27] it it would look bad if you did if you
[39:30] did whatever you wanted to do or
[39:31] wherever you wanted to wear what would
[39:33] people say about me who cares i care
[39:35] about what he says about him
[39:38] then it becomes about what can i do to
[39:40] make him happy what can i do to please
[39:42] him how can i live my life that's going
[39:44] to be pleasing to him
[39:46] and everything changes see then there's
[39:49] no then there's no sin willfully
[39:52] there's no willful sinning
[39:54] thus there's the sacrifice that
[39:56] continually lays there so that when a
[39:58] mistake does happen
[40:01] when you do fall in a hole or get in a
[40:04] trap
[40:05] make a mistake say something humanity or
[40:07] emotions or something
[40:10] there's a place of repentance
[40:12] there's a sacrifice there's blood that's
[40:14] on that mercy seat and god hears that
[40:16] prayer it answers and there's it
[40:19] and and even in our human flesh even our
[40:22] human abilities is completely wiped away
[40:25] annihilated
[40:26] as if it would never happen
[40:28] esau didn't have that
[40:31] unfortunately and i hate to say this but
[40:32] a lot of people today don't have that
[40:35] their desire is not because they love
[40:38] the lord
[40:39] now look
[40:41] he said i wouldn't do that for nothing
[40:43] because i love her too much
[40:44] it isn't because i didn't think she
[40:46] would forgive me it's the idea that i
[40:48] love her so much in the first place as
[40:51] long as i love her like that now now
[40:53] listen he's gonna break this down from
[40:56] his relationship to his wife to our
[40:58] relationship with the lord so listen
[41:00] closely
[41:02] as long as i love her like that i'll
[41:04] never do it and if she loves me that way
[41:07] she's supposed to she won't either
[41:10] and and you love the lord with all your
[41:13] heart
[41:14] amen
[41:17] let that
[41:18] really take its hold for us today saints
[41:21] if you really love the lord with all
[41:24] your heart i'm going to ask you to raise
[41:26] your hand but you know you love the lord
[41:28] with all your heart
[41:29] amen
[41:31] you don't have to worry about these
[41:33] things
[41:34] if you make a mistake
[41:36] you don't sin willfully
[41:39] you've just done something wrong you've
[41:41] slipped back a little
[41:43] true you was up there in fellowship and
[41:45] you dropped back down here into this
[41:48] mess again
[41:49] a slip-up mistake
[41:51] now we've talked about this several
[41:53] times but i want to go over to first
[41:55] john again
[41:57] first john chapter 3 one of my favorite
[41:59] chapters in the scripture
[42:05] first john chapter 3
[42:09] we'll begin with verse 1.
[42:19] amen behold what manner of love the
[42:22] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[42:24] should be called the sons of god
[42:27] therefore the world knoweth us not
[42:29] because it knew him not
[42:32] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[42:35] it does not yet manifest or appear
[42:38] what we shall be
[42:40] but we know that when he shall appear
[42:43] we shall be like him for we shall see
[42:46] him as he is
[42:49] and every man that had this hope in him
[42:52] purifieth himself even as he is pure
[42:55] whosoever committeth sin
[42:59] transgresseth also the law for sin is
[43:03] the transgression of the law
[43:06] now where does that come from
[43:09] amen
[43:10] understanding the differentiation
[43:13] between body spirit soul remember your
[43:16] body your spirit is human flesh can be
[43:19] corrupted
[43:20] the soul if you're born again
[43:23] if you're born again your soul is the
[43:25] resident of god
[43:27] god's seed the word of god god himself
[43:31] present in your soul
[43:33] that is what your soul is it is god that
[43:36] sees
[43:37] if god is in there that's the word
[43:40] it's the same as it would have been or
[43:43] was in the garden of eden with adam
[43:46] adam was the word
[43:48] he could not transgress he could not be
[43:52] deceived because he was the word
[43:55] if that who created him god himself
[44:00] is in you by new birth
[44:03] then the same thing exists in you
[44:07] now not talking about your body not
[44:09] talking about your spirit we're not
[44:11] excusing sin and wrong doing
[44:14] amen so we get that straight
[44:16] there is no excusing of sin or
[44:19] wrongdoing or mistakes there's no
[44:20] excusing it
[44:22] but in your soul
[44:24] there is no place if god is in there to
[44:28] be deceived because it's the word and
[44:30] the word cannot be deceived yes there's
[44:32] no place to transgress because it's the
[44:35] word
[44:36] amen it's the pure
[44:39] holiness of the word now the body spirit
[44:42] can be
[44:44] still flesh spirit can be but that soul
[44:48] which is god's property which
[44:50] god is
[44:52] concerned about the most that soul
[44:55] is born again it's of god
[44:57] then it cannot
[44:59] cannot be deceived
[45:02] can't no more no more than god can be
[45:04] deceived because that's who's living in
[45:07] you that's who you really are to begin
[45:09] with we spoke on this we've had a three
[45:11] or four part series on that who am i
[45:15] who am i who are you
[45:17] understanding that will help you
[45:18] understand what this is saying to us
[45:21] whosoever committeth sin
[45:24] transgresseth also the law for sin is
[45:27] the transgression of the law
[45:30] and you know that he was manifested
[45:33] listen now he jesus was manifested to
[45:36] take away our sins and in him
[45:39] is no sin or as i've said before i don't
[45:42] mean to change the word but it could
[45:45] read he was manifested to take away our
[45:48] sins because he was had no sin
[45:52] that's the only way he could take away
[45:54] our sin because he had no sin that's why
[45:57] no other person revelation chapter 5 can
[46:00] come forth nobody else could come forth
[46:03] and take that book but jesus christ
[46:05] because everybody was born in sin shaped
[46:08] iniquity come the world speaking lives
[46:10] everybody has sinned and come short of
[46:12] the glory of god except for jesus christ
[46:14] himself that perfect sacrifice because
[46:17] he had no sin he could take my sin and
[46:21] become sin himself and actually go to
[46:24] hell for me
[46:26] hang on a cross and go to hell for me
[46:29] praise the lord why would he do that
[46:31] except for the purpose that you would be
[46:34] sinless
[46:35] praise god amen to take away your
[46:38] mistake to take away your sin to
[46:41] annihilate the original sin in the
[46:43] garden of eden
[46:44] praise the lord amen that that sin would
[46:47] be annihilated by his own precious blood
[46:49] that he would take that on himself and
[46:51] become that sin so you could become the
[46:54] very righteousness of god
[46:56] remember what that righteousness is it
[46:58] is a person in their own in their
[47:00] rightful place
[47:02] and there ought to be condition
[47:05] and that's spiritually
[47:06] spiritually in the place that you ought
[47:08] to be in the mind of god where god saw
[47:11] you before the foundation of the world
[47:13] that's where you are now that's your
[47:15] awful that's your rightful position
[47:18] amen because that's god's position in
[47:20] your mind
[47:21] and excuse me in his mind that's where
[47:23] we were his thoughts his attributes
[47:26] he was manifested to take away our sin
[47:29] because there was no sin in him
[47:31] amen whosoever abideth in him abideth in
[47:35] him sinneth not sinneth not
[47:39] whosoever sinneth has not seen him
[47:42] neither known him
[47:45] little children that no man deceive you
[47:48] he that doth doeth righteousness is
[47:51] righteous
[47:52] even as he is righteous god is righteous
[47:57] god is the only righteous one
[47:59] so if god is the only righteous one and
[48:02] that god lives in you
[48:04] that is the only thing that puts you in
[48:06] the position that you should be in his
[48:08] mind before the world began
[48:10] in that righteousness of god a righteous
[48:14] person you see i'm not righteous i'm not
[48:16] looking at your flesh we're not talking
[48:18] about your spirit we're talking about
[48:19] the soul of man that god is taking up
[48:22] resident that you're born again
[48:25] you become a new creature
[48:27] all things are changed
[48:29] when you become a new creation
[48:33] he that doth righteousness is righteous
[48:35] even as he is righteous
[48:38] so that that's the only thing that makes
[48:40] us righteous
[48:41] he that committeth sin list this now he
[48:44] that committeth sin is of the devil
[48:48] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[48:51] for this purpose the son of god was
[48:53] manifested that he might destroy the
[48:56] works of the devil what was the works of
[48:58] the devil the works of the devil was to
[49:01] unbelieve to sin from the beginning what
[49:04] was it that the devil did
[49:06] his very heart according to the
[49:08] scripture
[49:09] his very heart called him to transgress
[49:12] god's word why because he wasn't the
[49:14] word
[49:15] right he could transgress because he
[49:18] wasn't the word
[49:19] and his whole point was to cause you to
[49:22] be deceived to cause the world humanity
[49:26] to be deceived so that this world would
[49:28] fall in sin just like he wanted to but
[49:31] where is this sin from
[49:34] it's from his heart
[49:36] he desired it
[49:38] but what does he do to a child of god
[49:41] all he could do remember
[49:43] what was he given
[49:45] brother brahm said god gave the choice
[49:47] you want the heart of the mind he took
[49:48] the mind so where is that deception at
[49:52] it's up here
[49:54] it's in your body it's in your spirit
[49:57] that he deceives you with that's the
[49:59] work of the enemy that's why it says if
[50:01] you sin
[50:03] if you commit sin
[50:05] if you live in sin
[50:07] it's of the devil
[50:09] right that's why we don't live in sin
[50:10] amen because why
[50:13] whosoever is born of god does not ninth
[50:17] verse
[50:17] whosoever is born of god does not commit
[50:21] sin now
[50:24] the
[50:25] i don't know if you have scofield but in
[50:27] my scofield note
[50:29] that
[50:30] commit is practice sin
[50:34] whosoever is born of god does not
[50:36] practice sin but i want you to notice
[50:39] because to me
[50:42] it's not the practicing of sin it's the
[50:44] heart that he's talking about
[50:47] it's the soul
[50:49] it's not the practice of sin the
[50:51] practice of sin is something that you do
[50:53] with your hands your body your mind your
[50:54] spirit
[50:55] that's the practice of sin i'm not
[50:58] talking about the practice of sin i'm
[51:00] talking about being a sin being your
[51:03] heart your soul not being transformed
[51:07] changed born again
[51:09] see if it hasn't been born again then
[51:12] you still live in sin like you were and
[51:14] your very desires are to sin
[51:17] your desire you want to
[51:19] you desire to
[51:21] your whole life is well i'll i'll just
[51:23] do this god offer and people live as
[51:26] christians like that right
[51:28] oh well god god will just forgive me
[51:30] i'll just go ahead and do this anyway
[51:32] i'll just you know god god forgive me
[51:34] it'll be okay you know the grace of god
[51:37] is powerful yes it is but you don't take
[51:39] it and make a disgrace out of it or
[51:41] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[51:43] your sin
[51:45] amen
[51:46] listen that's the scripture
[51:49] whosoever is born of god it's not a
[51:52] practice of sin now look at the rest of
[51:54] the scripture and i can use the
[51:56] scripture to refute scofield's note here
[51:59] for his seed remaineth in him and he can
[52:03] not sin
[52:05] now that has nothing to do with a
[52:08] practice over here he says practice
[52:10] that's not what he's talking about
[52:13] no he does not sin because he cannot sin
[52:17] how can you not sin
[52:19] because your heart has changed your your
[52:21] soul is changed you're a different
[52:24] person you're a new creation you can
[52:26] your soul can no more sin from the
[52:29] desires of your heart than god himself
[52:33] because god is the one that's the
[52:34] resident of your soul
[52:36] right
[52:38] no wonder you cannot sin where's that
[52:40] sin and so uh i i'm perfectly sinless in
[52:43] your body in your flesh and your spirit
[52:46] we make mistakes all the time
[52:51] that's why brother brown put a cross in
[52:53] his car
[52:55] brother you remember the story brother
[52:56] green told he's sitting there with
[52:58] brother branham and this beautiful nice
[53:01] looking
[53:02] mexican lady come walking across the
[53:03] street and he just followed her all the
[53:04] way across
[53:06] he said now brother green remember now
[53:08] that's that's what we need to guard
[53:10] ourselves of
[53:11] something to that effect and he put that
[53:13] cross in his car and he sees things like
[53:15] that he look at the cross right amen
[53:17] because he was a blessing he was a blood
[53:19] man he was a human male
[53:22] subject to light passions just
[53:25] just as it says it's uh
[53:29] the old prophet was elijah was james 5
[53:32] tells us elijah was a man subject to
[53:35] like passion
[53:36] well so was uh so was brother brown
[53:40] so in that in that spirit
[53:45] you make mistakes
[53:47] your emotions get the best of you
[53:49] sometimes or you get caught in a trap or
[53:51] make a mistake
[53:52] those things happen friend
[53:54] to all of us but it happens in our body
[53:57] our spirit that's why that blood is
[53:59] there on the mercy seat right make
[54:00] intercession on our behalf but the soul
[54:02] of man cannot sin
[54:05] you are born of god
[54:08] yes
[54:09] that born of god identifies to us what
[54:13] is not sin
[54:15] and that's your soul
[54:16] you don't get reborn in your flesh
[54:20] i mean nicodemus thought that i entered
[54:22] into my mother's womb the second time
[54:25] he had no revelation of what jesus was
[54:27] trying to tell him
[54:28] not in your flesh you're not born again
[54:30] in the flesh we didn't sing those songs
[54:33] born again in your spirit
[54:35] no it's your soul
[54:37] that gets born again that seed of god
[54:39] that remains in there
[54:41] that's god himself
[54:43] when that seed comes to life it's god
[54:45] it's no more it's no more the devil it's
[54:47] god that lives in there and you cannot
[54:50] sin because you're born of god born of
[54:53] god how by a new birth
[54:56] your soul
[54:58] has been changed
[55:00] you're a new creature in christ yes
[55:02] you're no longer the man
[55:03] or woman you're no longer the person
[55:05] that you were
[55:07] amen
[55:09] look at this
[55:11] then jesus
[55:13] then jesus came and called
[55:16] 1964. but on this
[55:18] when we really place our hands upon our
[55:21] sacrifice now look this is the
[55:23] differentiation between what we're
[55:25] talking about with esau
[55:27] and and probably a lot of people today
[55:30] the differentiation
[55:32] you really place your hands upon your
[55:34] sacrifice jesus
[55:36] and feel in your heart that you are
[55:38] guilty and you know that you're doing
[55:40] wrong
[55:41] amen there's the difference
[55:44] the blood of that sacrifice the life
[55:47] that was in the blood was god himself
[55:50] the light that was in the blood was god
[55:52] himself so he comes back upon you the
[55:55] holy spirit
[55:57] you become a son of god then with no
[56:00] more conscience of sin
[56:03] praise god
[56:04] we'll get to that in just a second
[56:06] no more conscience of sin
[56:09] we wanted to lay down the foundation
[56:12] the
[56:12] of the sinlessness
[56:15] of a child of god of a born-again child
[56:17] of god you're sinless
[56:19] what's sinless your soul
[56:22] who you really are
[56:24] this guy makes mistakes all the time
[56:25] that's why the blood's still there
[56:28] that's that's why i in my humble opinion
[56:31] i think some ministers get it off a
[56:32] little bit and they want to take the
[56:34] blood off the mercy seat and there's no
[56:36] need for the blood anymore
[56:38] because they
[56:39] they they don't see the differentiation
[56:41] to understand that your soul has been
[56:43] redeemed and god lives in there and you
[56:45] are the word in your soul but your body
[56:47] and your spirit are still corruptable
[56:49] again doesn't excuse sin
[56:52] does not excuse anything that we may do
[56:55] wrong or think wrong
[56:57] doesn't
[56:58] but you're still human
[57:01] and that humanity part of you we still
[57:03] need that blood
[57:05] yes amen we still need that forgiveness
[57:09] we still need that perpetuation
[57:11] that perpetuation that takes our place
[57:15] amen we still need that the soul has
[57:17] been redeemed it's sealed
[57:20] when the bible says he's sealed unto
[57:21] your destination you're sealed
[57:23] there's there's nothing to get nothing
[57:25] else can get in there nothing else can
[57:28] come out you are sealed until your
[57:29] destination that's it
[57:31] when brother adam talks about a
[57:33] refilling of the holy ghost he's not
[57:35] talking about your soul
[57:37] a refilling is not in the soul when
[57:39] you're born again you're sealed that's
[57:41] it you don't need anything else in there
[57:44] nothing more nothing less a refeeling is
[57:46] an anointing
[57:48] it's an anointing that falls on your
[57:50] flesh on your spirit
[57:52] that refilling of that anointing we can
[57:54] we get one new birth but many real
[57:57] feelings
[57:58] many anointings many times god comes and
[58:02] falls on us in our services or at home
[58:05] or wherever we are god falls on us and
[58:07] we feel his presence well that's what it
[58:09] means
[58:11] amen that's a refilling that's god's
[58:13] anointing falling on you the soul is
[58:16] sealed it's done it's finished
[58:20] you don't need any more of god in your
[58:22] soul
[58:24] the seed of god that was born
[58:26] came forth as god in your soul that's it
[58:29] spinach
[58:30] praise the lord
[58:32] so the armenians the calvinists
[58:35] i believe it's a calvinist believed in
[58:36] the eternal salvation but then they
[58:38] believed in it the way that you could
[58:40] well i'm going wherever i'm going so i
[58:41] just act to live however i want you
[58:44] you can't do that and the armenians will
[58:46] scare everybody to death and say well
[58:48] now if you make one wrong move you're
[58:49] going straight to hell
[58:52] you got to find a balance like we
[58:53] preached that's where scripture meets
[58:55] scripture
[58:56] you've got to find a balance to
[58:57] understand yes there is a truth to
[58:59] eternal security but that's after you've
[59:01] received the holy ghost and been born
[59:03] again
[59:04] and that is settled
[59:06] but now we still struggle with this body
[59:08] so you got the armenians now they got
[59:10] truth to that yes we need to live our
[59:12] lives as holy and righteous as we can
[59:15] according to god's word and not do
[59:16] anything that would be displeasing to
[59:18] him
[59:20] amen that's what
[59:21] that that so they both have a truth but
[59:23] they got to draw it out to where it it
[59:25] works scripturally
[59:27] to fit for our lives amen there is a
[59:30] eternal security
[59:32] but it's that soul
[59:34] look now let me finish this
[59:37] the blood of that sacrifice the life
[59:39] that was in that blood was god himself
[59:40] he came back upon you in the form of the
[59:42] holy spirit you become a son of god then
[59:44] we have no more conscience
[59:47] again we'll get to that no more
[59:49] conscience of sin
[59:51] he that's born of god listen now born of
[59:54] god we just read the seed of god is in
[59:56] you you're born of god the new birth the
[59:59] holy spirit
[1:00:01] all the
[1:00:02] explicitives adjectives we've been
[1:00:04] describing
[1:00:05] he that is born of god does not commit
[1:00:09] sin
[1:00:11] praise the lord
[1:00:14] he can't
[1:00:15] sin
[1:00:17] why he can't transgress because that's
[1:00:19] god in there right that's the word in
[1:00:21] there remember he couples it just like
[1:00:23] john did here
[1:00:25] born of god
[1:00:27] the new birth
[1:00:29] not talking about your flesh spirit the
[1:00:31] new birth
[1:00:32] see born of god does not commit sin he
[1:00:35] can't sin because the seed of god is in
[1:00:39] him
[1:00:40] he cannot sin just like adam in the
[1:00:43] garden of eden
[1:00:45] praise the lord amen oh think of it
[1:00:47] friend he has no more desire of sin at
[1:00:50] all no more desire of sin at all
[1:00:52] so long as you're desiring sin listen
[1:00:56] now
[1:00:59] so long as you're desiring to sin
[1:01:02] you're guilty of it right amen
[1:01:06] but when you have no more desire
[1:01:09] if you do anything wrong
[1:01:12] then you don't do it willfully
[1:01:15] hebrews 6 if we send will after
[1:01:17] receiving the knowledge of the truth
[1:01:19] remains no more sacrifice for sin sin
[1:01:21] willfully
[1:01:23] so if you continually want to sin
[1:01:26] willfully
[1:01:28] there's something wrong with your
[1:01:29] experience yes
[1:01:31] something wrong with your experiences
[1:01:34] there's not a oh well
[1:01:36] it's okay it'll be okay
[1:01:38] god forgives us god forgives sin god
[1:01:40] will uh god will wipe it away god will
[1:01:43] do away with it
[1:01:44] the grace of god will take will take
[1:01:46] effect over that but then
[1:01:50] but then they make it but then making a
[1:01:52] disgrace out of it
[1:01:54] out of god that's making it this way
[1:01:56] then it becomes no more sacrifice
[1:01:59] for sin
[1:02:00] let's go over to back to hebrews chapter
[1:02:02] 10 again
[1:02:06] we'll close here in just a few minutes
[1:02:11] hebrews chapter 10 again let's go to the
[1:02:13] first verse this time
[1:02:18] see how uh paul put these in the same
[1:02:22] chapter here how they were
[1:02:24] codified into the same chapter
[1:02:27] hebrews chapter 10 verse 1
[1:02:30] for the law having a shadow of good
[1:02:33] things to come just a shadow now
[1:02:36] and not the very image of the things
[1:02:39] can never with those sacrifices which
[1:02:41] they offered year by year continually
[1:02:44] make the comers there unto perfect we
[1:02:47] already mentioned
[1:02:48] we talked about that it was just a
[1:02:49] covering just covered their sin the sin
[1:02:51] was still there it just covered it
[1:02:54] see
[1:02:55] so that no sacrifice is coming
[1:02:58] irregardless of god
[1:03:01] instituting
[1:03:02] this sacrifice himself
[1:03:05] god is the one that brought and
[1:03:06] instituted
[1:03:08] these sacrifices he did it first in the
[1:03:10] garden of eden
[1:03:11] and he came with moat to moses with the
[1:03:13] law
[1:03:14] and the paschal lamb and thereafter how
[1:03:17] this sacrifice would be that would be
[1:03:19] acceptable to god but those sacrifices
[1:03:22] that they brought year after year after
[1:03:24] year
[1:03:26] even though it was acceptable by god did
[1:03:28] not make the worshiper perfect right
[1:03:31] they still had
[1:03:33] that conscience of sin
[1:03:37] second verse for then would they have
[1:03:39] would for then
[1:03:41] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:03:45] because that the worshipers once purged
[1:03:48] should have no more conscience of sins
[1:03:52] no more conscious look at this
[1:03:55] the
[1:03:56] worshiper which would be us
[1:03:59] we are the worshipers
[1:04:02] we are his children we are the ones that
[1:04:04] come offering spiritual sacrifices to
[1:04:08] god as the worshipper
[1:04:11] once purged
[1:04:15] cleansed
[1:04:17] eradicated
[1:04:19] done away with every sin and wrongdoing
[1:04:23] by the burning out of the holy ghost and
[1:04:26] fire
[1:04:27] of the nature that you were born with
[1:04:30] annihilating
[1:04:33] that holy ghost that that holy ghost and
[1:04:36] fire that that
[1:04:38] comes and burns that out
[1:04:40] annihilates every sin that could ever be
[1:04:43] held against you
[1:04:44] does away with it purge no more a part
[1:04:47] of it
[1:04:48] you have nothing to do with sin anymore
[1:04:51] it's it's done out of your life by the
[1:04:54] holy spirit that god sends
[1:04:56] that annihilates that
[1:04:58] which gave the human the chance
[1:05:01] because in the beginning we didn't have
[1:05:02] a chance
[1:05:04] because it wasn't our fault
[1:05:06] that adam and eve fell
[1:05:09] wasn't our fault
[1:05:10] they're our parents though or our great
[1:05:13] great great whatever back
[1:05:14] they're our parents though
[1:05:17] so when humanity fell because of adam
[1:05:21] and even the guard of eden then we came
[1:05:23] as fallen beings
[1:05:25] but it wasn't our fault so god made a
[1:05:27] way
[1:05:28] god made an exception
[1:05:30] for us to be able to
[1:05:32] have our sins done away if we desired
[1:05:35] and we followed with his word god would
[1:05:37] annihilate those sin the purging of that
[1:05:40] sin the purging of the worshippers sin
[1:05:43] brought god into the present view
[1:05:46] of righteousness
[1:05:49] so as he is righteous we are righteous
[1:05:52] because he's the one who made us
[1:05:54] righteous
[1:05:55] praise the lord have now
[1:05:57] no more conscience
[1:06:00] of sin
[1:06:01] it's not a conchable thing
[1:06:04] look at what the greek says on those on
[1:06:06] this word conscience i was just gonna
[1:06:09] read it but
[1:06:10] uh
[1:06:11] but i felt i wanted to print it because
[1:06:13] the more i read it the more it become
[1:06:16] real to me so i'll read it to you it's
[1:06:19] the greek on the word conscience here
[1:06:21] where it says he has no more conscience
[1:06:23] of sin and i think well what does that
[1:06:25] mean
[1:06:26] what is my conscience
[1:06:29] you know people say things ways on their
[1:06:31] conscience
[1:06:32] or my conscience would tell me not to do
[1:06:35] something
[1:06:36] it's a person's uh
[1:06:39] innermost thought process of conscience
[1:06:41] from the heart
[1:06:42] but look at what the conscience says now
[1:06:45] in the greek the definition here
[1:06:48] conscious the soul
[1:06:50] that's the first thing to think
[1:06:52] the soul
[1:06:54] as distinguishing between
[1:06:57] what is morally good and bad
[1:07:02] understand
[1:07:03] the conscience is the soul
[1:07:06] distinguishing
[1:07:08] between what is morally good and bad
[1:07:12] prompting to do the former
[1:07:15] which is good and shunned the ladder
[1:07:18] which is bad
[1:07:19] commending one which is the good
[1:07:23] and condemning the other
[1:07:26] by the conscience
[1:07:28] but now
[1:07:30] recognize the scripture
[1:07:32] says we have
[1:07:34] no more conscience
[1:07:37] of sin
[1:07:38] where the soul weighs
[1:07:41] morally what's good and bad
[1:07:44] well why would we have no more
[1:07:46] conscience of sin
[1:07:48] if we're children of god to weigh out
[1:07:51] what is morally good and bad
[1:07:54] because in your soul
[1:07:56] you're a new creature right there there
[1:07:59] is no weighing of good and bad there's
[1:08:03] only the word
[1:08:06] there's only the good
[1:08:08] there is only god you don't way
[1:08:12] to do something bad you just don't do
[1:08:15] the bad right there's no more weighing
[1:08:18] of that conscience
[1:08:20] because there's nothing to weigh
[1:08:23] you understand
[1:08:24] because to a child of god to that has
[1:08:27] been born again
[1:08:28] the conscience of the sin has been
[1:08:30] annihilated because all that is there is
[1:08:34] god in the word amen perfect
[1:08:37] holiness righteousness godliness that's
[1:08:40] the only thing that's there there is no
[1:08:42] weighing of the bad
[1:08:44] there is no bad
[1:08:47] now your humanity now
[1:08:50] your your brain
[1:08:53] and what you've been raised to know or
[1:08:54] believe what is morally good or bad is
[1:08:57] still there but the conscience of the
[1:09:00] soul
[1:09:01] is gone there there's there's there's no
[1:09:03] more way
[1:09:05] the sin question has been answered
[1:09:09] there is no more guilt
[1:09:12] right there is no more unrighteousness
[1:09:15] there is no more ungodliness
[1:09:18] it's all god in his word
[1:09:21] you as who you really are
[1:09:24] your soul
[1:09:25] so there's no more conscience of sin
[1:09:28] because there's nothing in you to want
[1:09:31] to sin to do sin to commit sin no more
[1:09:35] to say there can't be a deception
[1:09:37] because it's the word it's god
[1:09:40] well there can't be a conscience of sin
[1:09:42] where there's god because all that god
[1:09:44] is is good
[1:09:46] there is no morally bad
[1:09:49] there's nothing to weigh
[1:09:51] understand there's nothing there to
[1:09:53] weigh back and forth in your soul why
[1:09:55] because you've been born again
[1:09:57] all that's in there is this
[1:09:59] yeah it's just the word yes there's no
[1:10:01] bad
[1:10:02] it's just god
[1:10:04] it's just the word
[1:10:05] so you don't worry about that because
[1:10:08] you've been born again yes you're a new
[1:10:10] creature in christ jesus now can we see
[1:10:14] can we see and understand the willfully
[1:10:17] versus the deceptively can we weigh and
[1:10:19] understand
[1:10:21] the difference between being born again
[1:10:23] and a person that is born again and
[1:10:25] someone that is not right
[1:10:27] the desire to sin
[1:10:29] the willfulness of sin the walking out
[1:10:32] into sin purposefully
[1:10:36] the soul desiring to continue to live in
[1:10:39] sin
[1:10:40] to continue to live the ways of the
[1:10:42] world and the things that are wrong
[1:10:47] do we see and understand how those
[1:10:49] things get weighed and weighed in god's
[1:10:51] mind
[1:10:52] and who we are in god
[1:10:55] if we are a child of god
[1:10:57] if god lives in us and
[1:10:59] our very soul is god himself we're born
[1:11:03] of god
[1:11:04] there cannot be
[1:11:07] any more sin in there
[1:11:09] there cannot be
[1:11:11] any more conscience or weighing of what
[1:11:15] is morally good and bad because it's
[1:11:16] only god
[1:11:19] there is no bad of god
[1:11:21] it's only him
[1:11:23] praise the lord there's no more
[1:11:25] conscience of sin
[1:11:28] the worshipers been purged
[1:11:31] have no more conscience
[1:11:33] no more conscience of sin
[1:11:35] but in those sacrifices third verse now
[1:11:38] there is a remembrance again they
[1:11:40] remembered it now
[1:11:41] there's a remembrance again made of sin
[1:11:44] every year
[1:11:45] their desires weren't changed
[1:11:48] they lived in the same capacity that
[1:11:50] they were born in sin shape iniquity
[1:11:52] called the world speaking lies
[1:11:54] for it is not possible that the blood of
[1:11:56] bulls and goats should take away sin
[1:11:59] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:12:02] he said sacrifice and offering doubt
[1:12:04] what is not but a body has thou prepared
[1:12:06] me and burn offerings and sacrifices for
[1:12:09] sin thou has had no pleasure
[1:12:13] no pleasure
[1:12:15] and there is no pleasure of sin to a
[1:12:17] child of god
[1:12:18] there's pleasure of sin to the world
[1:12:20] but there is no pleasure of sin to a
[1:12:22] child of god because he has no more
[1:12:24] conscience of sin right
[1:12:26] he's born again
[1:12:28] amen once just like ephesians 2 said i
[1:12:31] was going to read it but we'll skip over
[1:12:32] that
[1:12:34] once
[1:12:35] ephesians said once we were dead in our
[1:12:38] sins
[1:12:40] now we're dead to sin
[1:12:42] praise god because of the righteousness
[1:12:44] of jesus christ one more the
[1:12:47] god who is rich in mercy 1965 he that's
[1:12:50] born of god does not commit sin
[1:12:53] the worshiper once purged has no more
[1:12:56] conscience of sin no more desire to sin
[1:13:00] because remember there's no way
[1:13:03] your soul's not weighing good and bad
[1:13:05] anymore there's no there's not even a
[1:13:07] conscience no desire for sin no more
[1:13:11] conscience no more desire to sin the sin
[1:13:14] question is over
[1:13:16] you become a part of god in christ and
[1:13:19] christ has died to redeem you
[1:13:22] praise the lord
[1:13:23] now if you're born again that's who god
[1:13:25] has made you
[1:13:27] the same question is over
[1:13:30] the difference of people struggling back
[1:13:32] and forth of willfully i'm a child of
[1:13:35] god have i gone too far i've made that
[1:13:37] mistake have i done this willfully or
[1:13:41] by deception well
[1:13:44] you can make mistakes in your flesh sin
[1:13:47] sakes but if you're born to god
[1:13:49] that's god
[1:13:50] god makes no mistakes
[1:13:52] god has no sin
[1:13:54] you're born of him you belong to him
[1:13:57] that's who we are in him
[1:13:59] and people wonder oh
[1:14:02] did i
[1:14:03] and and say no try to get you to believe
[1:14:05] that oh well all these things i i did it
[1:14:07] because i wanted to why you you might
[1:14:09] have walked into something wide-eyed but
[1:14:11] that didn't mean you had the desire for
[1:14:12] it there's a difference
[1:14:16] there's a difference in saying well you
[1:14:18] know
[1:14:18] i made this mistake and you know i knew
[1:14:21] what i was doing and that doesn't that
[1:14:23] doesn't condone it
[1:14:25] seems
[1:14:26] that does not make it right
[1:14:28] especially even in the ministry that
[1:14:30] does not make it right
[1:14:32] there's there's penalties that still
[1:14:35] come with that
[1:14:36] you will reap what you sow
[1:14:39] and if you sow the bad you're going to
[1:14:41] reap that
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:44] because that's where it comes from
[1:14:47] but if you're born again you're a child
[1:14:49] of god amen you're a part of god
[1:14:52] you belong to him
[1:14:55] he that is born of god can not sin yes
[1:15:01] amen no more conscience of sin yes
[1:15:04] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:15:21] praise the lord
[1:15:23] thank god
[1:15:24] he has made the way
[1:15:29] amen let's sing his little song
[1:15:38] amen i'm a new creation
[1:15:40] praise the lord aren't you glad of that
[1:15:42] it's a new creation
[1:15:44] because fortunately
[1:15:46] the soul inside is what dictates to the
[1:15:48] spirit
[1:15:50] and then the spirit dictates to the body
[1:15:53] so the soul bringing the flesh of the
[1:15:55] subjection causes the flesh to fall in
[1:15:58] line with the word
[1:15:59] which is what the soul is yes the word
[1:16:02] amen amen so the flesh and the spirit
[1:16:06] come in line to the word yes amen
[1:16:11] and listen this now
[1:16:13] hallelujah
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:28] thank god he justified me
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:39] i'm a new creation
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:56] that's what i am

[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:28] is
