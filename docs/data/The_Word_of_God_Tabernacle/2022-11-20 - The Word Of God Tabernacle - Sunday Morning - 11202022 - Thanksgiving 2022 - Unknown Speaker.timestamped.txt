[20:29] Paul says it Remains the Same to this
[20:32] day and Lord help us to recognize the

[21:31] all it's John Peter and Paul said that
[21:35] to love one another above all and to
[21:39] love you first
[21:41] everyone else second to put ourselves
[21:44] last but father there's a tendency if

[32:43] to give it a testimony but I do want to
[32:45] take the time whatever we need this
[32:47] morning and I just felt led that I
[32:50] believe we're all thankful and we all
[32:52] have a lot to be thankful for amen and
[32:55] um
[32:56] the we live in a country we live in to
[32:59] express our love we're able to express
[33:01] our thankfulness to what God's giving
[33:03] saints that they Thanksgiving was a born
[33:07] of course it didn't become a national
[33:09] holiday until a hundred years later but
[33:11] it wasn't born based on the fact that
[33:14] they came to a place that a new land
[33:19] that they didn't know anything about or
[33:21] made new friends or that they they were
[33:24] thankful because they had come to a
[33:26] place that they felt like that they
[33:28] could worship God the way they wanted to
[33:31] worship God how and when and the way
[33:34] they wanted to worship god without the
[33:36] oppression of nicolaitan's systems
[33:39] lording over them they wanted to read
[33:42] their Bibles and freedom without being
[33:44] scared of a church or a government
[33:47] chopping their heads off or taking their
[33:49] children from them they were thankful
[33:51] because they had a freedom and liberty
[33:53] of God that's why they were thankful not
[33:57] for the Bountiful Harvest they had or
[34:00] all the things that may have come with
[34:02] it but they were thankful for one thing
[34:05] even unfortunately it seems to have
[34:07] waned a good bit that they were thankful
[34:09] of one thing and that was that they had
[34:11] come to a place that they had the
[34:14] freedom to worship God in the way that
[34:16] they wanted to amen praise the Lord but
[34:20] if anybody has a testimony something on
[34:22] your heart that you'd like to give glory
[34:24] and praise to the Lord this morning
[34:26] oh I about about three weeks ago I lost
[34:31] my car key
[34:33] and so I took this little purse thank
[34:36] you so much so about three weeks ago I
[34:39] lost my wallet that I made my tea to my
[34:42] car and I took this little wallet it's
[34:45] got four
[34:46] three zippers in it two on the front and
[34:49] one in the back and this thing and this
[34:51] little pouch in the front there's
[34:53] nothing you can't put much in it a
[34:56] couple cards a little bit of coin and
[34:59] paper and I dumped that thing out and
[35:03] the pockets are only like two inches
[35:04] deep except the back one I dumped
[35:07] everything out
[35:09] to look
[35:10] and um and uh and I just pleaded with
[35:14] the Lord I need that key I don't know
[35:16] where it is
[35:17] and
[35:19] I went into my wallet for something
[35:22] and there was my key it just appeared

[36:28] so tired and and he would just give me
[36:31] like the horoscopes of color and

[36:41] realized I've seen in the spirit
[36:44] that's so blessed me we just think these
[36:48] things are common
[36:50] and and that always just stuff in my
[36:53] hair it's just you know and then I
[36:56] realized it's not oh God is giving us
[36:59] these things to teach us to train
[37:03] to train to that he's really there all
[37:05] the time and he's and to press him yes

[39:37] okay well welcome it's a pleasure to
[39:40] have you thank you for being here
[39:43] um when I fly and go into Minneapolis
[39:46] which we've been doing since August
[39:48] I go in to the airport
[39:52] and I put all my stuff because I learned
[39:54] to do this years ago and flying I put
[39:57] everything out of my pockets even though
[39:58] I got pre-checked on it doesn't matter I
[40:00] put all my stuff in a baggie and put it
[40:02] in my briefcase everything except for my
[40:04] license because you got to give them
[40:06] your license at the registrate at the
[40:08] reservation desk you got to give your
[40:10] license at the TSA and uh and then I and
[40:13] then I have to give my life show my
[40:14] license when I get the rental car so I
[40:17] put everything in but my license so my
[40:19] license comes out of my wallet so I took
[40:21] my license and I always I'm always you
[40:24] know wanting to go and so I had my
[40:26] license I put my wallet in the little
[40:28] change area cup area and hand my license
[40:33] to the people and get the car and they
[40:35] lift the gate and I just take my license
[40:36] and set it next to my wallet and then
[40:39] pull off and then when I get to the
[40:40] hotel I take my license and put it in
[40:42] there but this time first time that I
[40:45] had somebody riding with me the other
[40:46] one of our guys and we had flown up
[40:49] there together and he was riding with me
[40:51] and when we got there before I had set
[40:53] my wallet uh we saw our boss come in
[40:56] with another person at the exact same
[40:58] time the hotel parking lot and then he
[41:00] thought a part of this car had the
[41:03] charger in it but it wasn't and I
[41:06] thought you know it's probably this this
[41:07] right right here is probably a phone
[41:09] charger so I took my wallet in my uh my
[41:12] driver's license out and you know with
[41:14] all the confusion everything I didn't
[41:15] put it in there so we got out to go get
[41:18] our luggage and stuff out of the back of
[41:19] the car to go meet with them I forgot to
[41:21] put my wallet and my license in my
[41:23] wallet and I'm sure they fell out in the
[41:26] parking lot but I didn't even realize it
[41:27] until the next day at lunch when I got
[41:31] my wallet out to go pay for lunch my
[41:33] license was going on so where are they
[41:35] and I went back I looked everywhere and
[41:38] then it snowed all sudden it snowed
[41:40] every day
[41:41] we were there it snowed every day sun
[41:44] came out for probably a total of two
[41:46] hours in the entire week uh 15 degrees
[41:49] Friday so it was It was kind of brutal
[41:54] but it snowed every day I woke up Monday
[41:56] morning to go to work it was snowing and
[41:58] there was some snow on the ground and I
[42:02] didn't think but I didn't think anything
[42:03] about it because it was until lunch that
[42:05] day and so I went when we got back I
[42:08] went and I looked around and it was
[42:10] nowhere to be found I looked in
[42:11] everything and Sony was saying look here
[42:13] I said oh look there six times uh look
[42:16] here I looked there eight times look
[42:17] here I looked there four times I looked
[42:19] everywhere and I did the same thing like
[42:23] Lord just put in my wallet that's
[42:26] or have somebody find it and so I was
[42:30] downstairs asked the lady no nobody's
[42:32] turned anything in and so some of you
[42:36] that thinks she led the sisters know or
[42:38] different ones know about it and went to
[42:41] prayer and so after lunch on Tuesday I
[42:45] told my boss I said if you don't mind I
[42:46] finished eating I said I'm going to go
[42:48] to the hotel and check around because it
[42:51] had gotten to it had gotten to a balmy
[42:54] temperature of 33 that day so uh things
[42:58] to melt but the scrapers had been
[43:02] scraping the parking lot
[43:04] so I went kicking around in these big
[43:07] huge these piles where they had plowed
[43:10] everything to and it was no I couldn't
[43:11] find it anywhere and so I looked back
[43:14] and I I retraced my steps six times from
[43:17] where I knew we parked the car and I
[43:19] knew it was in the parking lot I mean I
[43:20] knew that's where I had I dropped it it
[43:22] had to be there uh because I could trace
[43:25] it up to that point
[43:27] um it's like everybody says you know
[43:29] where'd you uh where's the last place
[43:32] you found it or words the last place you
[43:33] had it where I lost it
[43:35] no
[43:38] that's kind of a silly question but I
[43:41] knew so I traced myself back to there
[43:43] and I knew it had to be there but the
[43:46] scrapers would come by and people that
[43:47] walk through there and I looked here
[43:49] when I kicked snow all over the place I
[43:51] did I did everything I knew to do so
[43:53] assumed in time he said just go ask the
[43:55] lady of the desk one more time so when
[43:57] asked to lay at the desk she said what's
[43:59] your name and I told her and she picked
[44:01] it up so here it is
[44:03] I don't know who turned it in uh it's
[44:07] been it's been straight uh the scraper
[44:11] scraped it somehow I don't know where it
[44:13] was where they found it I Nast in care
[44:15] uh just thankful that because I spent a
[44:19] good 24 to 36 hours wondering how I was
[44:22] going to get home
[44:23] because you got to give you your license
[44:25] that's the only picture ID I had an
[44:28] advice like we have uh you have passport
[44:31] yeah home on my file cabinet
[44:34] didn't do me any good I tried to order a
[44:36] license I was going to get Sonia to go
[44:38] get some license for me and mail it to
[44:40] me next day or something anyway but uh I
[44:44] wasn't worried but I was trying to
[44:45] figure out well if how am I going to get
[44:48] home
[44:49] it's one thing to lose them and then go
[44:51] to the MVD and get some more it's
[44:53] another thing when you're out of town
[44:54] you're going to fly out in a few days to
[44:55] try to get back home so I'm thankful for
[44:58] rewards uh LED somebody to find them to
[45:02] bring them to them and so and thank you

[45:41] um mostly you know
[45:44] the testimonies that I give are mostly
[45:46] about the car I don't know if anybody
[45:48] who knows about what happens with the
[45:51] car but
[45:52] I was driving my old Fort the other day
[45:55] and
[45:55] and uh
[45:57] it started shaking and I thought well
[46:01] I just had a flat tire fixed and that
[46:04] was probably out of balance so
[46:06] I kept going at all I go to the entire
[46:08] store and get them to rebalance it um
[46:11] in the uh
[46:15] luckily I'd gone down the super highway
[46:17] and then I and then I got on the side
[46:19] road I went down to the service road
[46:21] again when I pulled up on I-10 and I not
[46:26] pulling up the Ina ramp there it came
[46:29] loose damn it was done
[46:32] and and
[46:34] it was stuck the trans I knew because it
[46:37] flopped the trans the
[46:39] driveshaft hit the floor and I said oh I
[46:43] know I've broken my rear universal
[46:46] and I thought wow just yesterday I was
[46:49] thinking
[46:50] when I had this flat tire I took my
[46:53] tools out and I didn't put the tools
[46:55] back in the Drone and I had a spare
[46:59] universal joint in there as well I could
[47:01] have fixed it you know I didn't so
[47:04] I had to
[47:06] get a wreck or so
[47:08] called the police got the record the
[47:10] police came in the record came and
[47:13] called me home and
[47:15] we finally got it back in the garage and
[47:17] and I grow alone right now the yoga
[47:20] broke in half so I couldn't have fixed
[47:23] it but
[47:24] it's just
[47:25] the Lord is always with me amen amen I
[47:29] believe he's got hedges around all of us
[47:32] yes amen
[47:34] and anything could have been worse it
[47:37] could have been
[47:38] doing 75 when it absolutely yeah it just
[47:42] when I pulled up and stopped and yeah so
[47:44] it's so lucky amen it's pieces that I
[47:48] have and I can fix it yes it just takes
[47:51] time but it's the same way I just
[47:54] continue my testimonies it happens every
[47:57] day yeah amen the sink
[48:01] see it wouldn't work anymore so I pulled
[48:05] the sink all apart
[48:07] and I tried two or three different
[48:09] drains and that oh it just wasn't
[48:11] working and
[48:12] so I had already bought some drains and
[48:15] I went back and uh
[48:17] they gave me so much money back for this
[48:19] simple little drain it gave me a relics
[48:23] uh
[48:25] intricate one which seems like it would
[48:28] have cost more for less and gave me
[48:30] money back and I said wow that was great
[48:32] and we don't put it on and it's leaking
[48:35] and I said Lord you know I guess it
[48:38] keeps leaking keeps like well I keep
[48:39] tightening it I I just could hear him

[48:43] tighten it and then the next day it'll
[48:45] be leaking and I tighten it

[48:49] and then
[48:50] and uh this is just supposed to be a
[48:53] simple repair you know and I just unplug
[48:57] the drain would have been good enough
[49:00] but
[49:04] so in the middle of the night I checked
[49:07] it because I didn't want it to be
[49:09] dripping all night long you know it was
[49:11] a thing and I'd tighten it again with
[49:14] that pair of pliers and crack another oh
[49:17] no I broke a plastic piece in there now

[55:57] I said I'll go back to this like okay
[55:58] maybe you dropped it
[56:01] down

[56:04] says I cannot find the money she said I
[56:08] take my my purse

[57:25] me
[57:27] and um
[57:29] I just knew that I could always speaking
[57:31] into existence but I thought if I do
[57:33] that people are gonna think I'm crazy
[57:35] I'm not gonna explain this to to
[57:37] everybody so I held on
[57:41] and that week

[57:46] checks from people in places where I
[57:49] didn't know maybe money

[58:01] husband used to see you need to write

[1:02:24] well what happens with minister's wife
[1:02:26] well I'm going to tell you something
[1:02:27] that happened with the little car
[1:02:29] incident
[1:02:30] I was going to meet one of the sisters
[1:02:32] for lunch and so you know you just going
[1:02:35] back today oh this is just great this is
[1:02:37] fun well I went to park Mexico car and I
[1:02:40] noticed it was sticking out just a
[1:02:41] little bit but I can make it I pulled in
[1:02:44] I was like I heard a noise I was like oh
[1:02:46] right really you know this is how
[1:02:48] pastors like things I'm human too I was
[1:02:51] like oh really really you know I was
[1:02:53] just sitting there okay I'm gonna get
[1:02:54] out and see if I did anything so I got
[1:02:57] out and sure enough I scraped the car
[1:02:59] and of course I have a white car and I
[1:03:00] have a black car it doesn't have to be
[1:03:02] magic
[1:03:03] it sounds like oh great so like for a
[1:03:06] split second you know the devil wants to
[1:03:07] say hey you can just walk away you can
[1:03:09] just go pack somewhere else you won't
[1:03:11] they don't know but then but God says
[1:03:13] really you know better than that okay so
[1:03:15] of course I backed out pulled back in
[1:03:17] like I should so I had to go find this
[1:03:20] person in a restaurant you know what
[1:03:22] crazy person walks around do you have a
[1:03:23] car give him a card you know it's not
[1:03:24] like a guide you're just gonna help me
[1:03:26] find a person so I just walked in and I
[1:03:29] said okay that looks like the people
[1:03:31] something to something so I walked up to
[1:03:33] him and I said Do you happen to have a
[1:03:34] black car and they're like yeah we do
[1:03:36] how'd you know no I don't know and I
[1:03:40] said I think I hit your car and you know
[1:03:42] you don't know how a person's gonna
[1:03:43] react I'm like oh this is okay let's go
[1:03:45] look at it you know for a second like
[1:03:48] okay everything's a meeting so like we
[1:03:50] go out there and they looked it over and
[1:03:52] she had two other people with her and
[1:03:54] you know people can change stories and
[1:03:56] whatever but she was all oh it's gonna
[1:03:58] be okay I think I know someone who can
[1:03:59] fix it the other people are like you
[1:04:01] should be saying that no and so I was
[1:04:04] like oh right my insurance is going to
[1:04:05] go up
[1:04:06] I don't know what I'm gonna do I have to
[1:04:08] tell my husband I just wrecked my car
[1:04:09] you know all this goes through your head
[1:04:11] right let me talk about God you're gonna
[1:04:13] have to help me I'm gonna have to help
[1:04:15] me with this situation I gotta have the
[1:04:17] right Spirit I'm a person that have the
[1:04:18] right attitude so you know I asked the
[1:04:21] lady I said well you want to change
[1:04:22] insurance no we'll be fine everything
[1:04:24] will be fine well God said just take all
[1:04:26] the pictures stay honest do everything
[1:04:28] you're supposed to do and so I did that
[1:04:30] I took all the pictures I took her
[1:04:32] license plate and he said just always
[1:04:34] stay honest so right I wrote down every
[1:04:36] detail I knew and everything that they
[1:04:39] said
[1:04:39] and that lady tried to contact me three
[1:04:41] times and just ignored her because you
[1:04:43] know you don't know what they're doing
[1:04:45] you don't know that person they don't
[1:04:46] know me so the insurance company kept
[1:04:48] calling me but the insurance name wasn't
[1:04:50] putting them on the phone and with all
[1:04:52] the scamming and stuff I was like I'm
[1:04:53] playing this room that they knew my name
[1:04:56] and they knew there was an incident but
[1:04:58] they didn't see when it happened so I
[1:05:00] was like okay I'm not answering that
[1:05:01] well a month later I got a letter in the
[1:05:03] mail that had the same number I said oh
[1:05:05] this is legit
[1:05:06] and so the next time they called I talk
[1:05:08] to him and he said well just tell me
[1:05:09] everything that happened and how it
[1:05:11] happened and so I didn't and the whole
[1:05:15] thing cleared up again to pay for
[1:05:17] anything I didn't have to my interest
[1:05:19] didn't go up they falsified the date
[1:05:22] that happened
[1:05:23] so just one little
[1:05:25] detail changed the whole situation for
[1:05:28] me but you know God likes to just see
[1:05:30] what are you gonna do in the situation
[1:05:31] how are you going to handle that
[1:05:33] situation even the Master's wife you've
[1:05:34] gotten to go oh
[1:05:36] no but something says don't do that stay
[1:05:39] honest stay true and so I'm just
[1:05:41] thankful that we have that voice that
[1:05:43] says do the right thing and when you do
[1:05:45] it you sound okay you kind of go oh my
[1:05:47] gosh everything's gonna go you know my
[1:05:49] insurance is going to go up everything I
[1:05:50] said be crazy but it didn't so then the
[1:05:53] other thing that happens to me I think
[1:05:55] I've told you all anybody who doesn't
[1:05:56] know I drive senior citizens around for
[1:05:58] appointments and doctors appointments
[1:06:00] and errands
[1:06:01] I have one lady that she's so good to me
[1:06:04] I've had her for two years and when we
[1:06:06] talk we talk a lot about faith she goes
[1:06:08] to a Methodist Church I'd come here and
[1:06:10] she's constantly saying well what do you
[1:06:12] believe what do you do and so we just
[1:06:14] talked and I told her one time this was
[1:06:16] like four months ago I said okay we got
[1:06:19] she has a wheelchair I'll walk her
[1:06:21] and I said every time we go we can't
[1:06:23] find a parking spot
[1:06:24] you know the parking part is full of
[1:06:25] people who can park
[1:06:28] handicap has three or four they always
[1:06:30] get full when I have appointments with
[1:06:32] her we're like
[1:06:33] okay let's drive around it comes open
[1:06:36] because she had a hard time walking so a
[1:06:38] lot of times I have to stop behind cars
[1:06:39] let her out and keep the blinkers going
[1:06:42] and people are kind of going what are
[1:06:43] you doing I'm trying to get this lady in
[1:06:45] the store no so we do that and one day
[1:06:47] she's like you know I'm tired of this I
[1:06:49] said you know I am too we're just going
[1:06:51] to pray from now on anytime we have an
[1:06:53] appointment no matter where it is we're
[1:06:54] gonna find a spot
[1:06:56] yeah sure
[1:06:59] she's coconut milk I said Kenny it's
[1:07:01] really gonna happen I believe it so the
[1:07:03] first couple appointments will get there
[1:07:05] right perfect you know and there's van
[1:07:07] parking that there if anybody knows
[1:07:09] there's band parking in this regular
[1:07:10] parking we always see the vampire
[1:07:12] because there's extra space so I said
[1:07:13] okay we're gonna need to be specific we
[1:07:15] need a van parking and she said okay she
[1:07:18] still had that question well now for
[1:07:20] myself she's like are you ready to go I
[1:07:22] know we're gonna need a spot so you
[1:07:24] never know and we have been for the last
[1:07:25] four months anytime we go to an
[1:07:27] appointment that's about a board
[1:07:28] scheduled or what we're doing we're just
[1:07:30] pull in and we're good to go and
[1:07:31] sometimes it's just mindful of every
[1:07:33] little thing we do amen
[1:07:36] praise the Lord amen amen yes anybody
[1:07:39] else
[1:07:41] yeah I will
[1:07:45] he doesn't mind
[1:07:49] um I just like to give everyone else a
[1:07:51] chance
[1:07:53] most of the time anyway but just
[1:07:57] thank the Lord for all those blessings
[1:08:00] and everything he does and providing and
[1:08:02] as you all know the job that he gave me
[1:08:04] and the circumstances surrounding
[1:08:06] finding the job he had to basically
[1:08:10] make me poor so I can move in with my
[1:08:14] parents so I can be on the side of town
[1:08:16] to leave the correct safe way to see the
[1:08:18] sign of the insurance company that I
[1:08:20] would call to then be hired and become a
[1:08:22] part of
[1:08:23] just all these little things that he had
[1:08:26] to
[1:08:28] do
[1:08:29] perfectly for it all to work amen and
[1:08:33] for the gifts he's given me the
[1:08:36] abilities he's given me the
[1:08:38] understanding the knowledge of wisdom
[1:08:40] sometimes people will ask me to do
[1:08:42] things or ask me questions that I've
[1:08:43] never occurred before and I just know
[1:08:46] the answer
[1:08:48] whatever that channel he's given me
[1:08:51] that he allows me to operate in
[1:08:53] sometimes
[1:08:55] then to further the insurance story that
[1:08:58] Mom was telling because I'm their
[1:09:00] insurance agent now
[1:09:03] I can see the back side of the insurance
[1:09:04] thing and the lady that she was talking
[1:09:06] about opened a claim
[1:09:08] um with her insurance company to contact
[1:09:10] Mom's insurance company so there was an
[1:09:13] open claim that they were trying to get
[1:09:15] money but the date was incorrect and
[1:09:18] some of the details about the incident
[1:09:21] were Incorrect and ultimately at the end
[1:09:24] of it the claim was officially closed
[1:09:27] without payment so it didn't affect the
[1:09:31] so there's a little bit more interesting
[1:09:34] on the back end that happened that
[1:09:36] she didn't mention but just overall
[1:09:39] keeping this healthy it's been pandemic
[1:09:42] has been going on for 2
[1:09:44] . none of us have
[1:09:47] covered
[1:09:49] who've been in the positive
[1:09:51] I've been in groups of people that later
[1:09:53] have tested positive I went to Las Vegas
[1:09:57] I've been in groups of people I went to
[1:09:59] a reptile show yesterday where people
[1:10:01] were cramping and I just thank the lord
[1:10:02] for keeping us all safe
[1:10:05] amen praise the Lord yeah I want crowded
[1:10:09] airplanes every other week
[1:10:12] and they're all full
[1:10:14] every flight is almost completely full
[1:10:17] of airports airplanes full full the God
[1:10:21] God keeps us
[1:10:23] and videos
[1:10:24] I'm sorry that's a hedge yes yes exactly
[1:10:28] amen praise the Lord and I prayed I
[1:10:31] thought I've told y'all before I prayed
[1:10:33] that over every one of you too
[1:10:37] emails
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:42] it's a good thing Sonya took pictures
[1:10:44] too she took pictures and sent the
[1:10:46] pictures because I believe if I remember
[1:10:47] they were claiming damage that didn't
[1:10:50] happen correct and since she had taken
[1:10:52] pictures uh it just showed that
[1:10:55] everything that these people were trying
[1:10:57] to just get money was wrong
[1:11:01] and don't the pictures have a date yeah
[1:11:04] yeah so that they are date encrypted
[1:11:06] yeah I don't if you send it to somebody
[1:11:09] I don't know if the date goes through to
[1:11:11] the person you send it to but you
[1:11:12] haven't proved that that's the date and
[1:11:15] time that it was taken correct
[1:11:17] so amen just listen to that still a
[1:11:21] small voice you never know we oftentimes
[1:11:24] gets in places and we just don't
[1:11:26] understand Lord mama here wise it's
[1:11:28] going on why is this happening to me
[1:11:29] Lord why is this happening to me
[1:11:32] God just listen I'm just trying to get
[1:11:34] you in the position to bless you if you
[1:11:37] just let me move you and let me get you
[1:11:39] in that place I just want to get you to
[1:11:41] work to this place where I could bless
[1:11:43] you and
[1:11:45] it and he does
[1:11:48] amen he does we just trust him praise
[1:11:51] the Lord amen we'll stand to our feet
[1:11:53] now I want to read a couple of
[1:11:55] scriptures
[1:11:56] amend no service that's complete without
[1:11:58] the reading of scripture
[1:12:00] thank you Lord
[1:12:03] and I do appreciate your continued
[1:12:05] prayers of
[1:12:08] to my knowledge we're supposed to go

[1:12:28] lot of the cold the way it was in the
[1:12:30] snow so and it did again it did
[1:12:33] literally snow at some point every
[1:12:36] single day Monday Tuesday Wednesday I
[1:12:40] don't think it stopped now some of it
[1:12:42] was very light it didn't accumulate very
[1:12:45] much but it stowed every day if uh if
[1:12:50] you don't like snow but the good part
[1:12:52] about this this job though the way the
[1:12:54] Lord worked it out we ended up with
[1:12:57] three extra guys on our team from
[1:12:59] another team because they wanted to take
[1:13:00] this Thanksgiving week off they were
[1:13:02] supposed to work this week so they want
[1:13:04] to take this week off so they worked
[1:13:05] this past week with us so they could
[1:13:07] take this week off and those guys were
[1:13:10] available but 95 percent of what we had
[1:13:14] to do on this job was all inside
[1:13:16] it was all inside the tunnel or inside
[1:13:19] the back room in fact Monday I had to
[1:13:21] pull cable on a man lift in the back
[1:13:24] room I had to pull cable it's like one
[1:13:26] of the first things we did Monday and
[1:13:28] the sweat was pouring off of me because
[1:13:30] I was up on this man lift and the heater
[1:13:33] was blowing right on me so it actually
[1:13:38] sometimes was the opposite extreme
[1:13:41] but I again my job because there's a lot
[1:13:44] of outsides and inside and outside of
[1:13:46] stuff to do so but
[1:13:48] um uh the Lord has just been good to
[1:13:50] take care of us so I'm thankful for that
[1:13:52] yeah amen
[1:13:54] amen second Corinthians will turn down
[1:13:55] chapter four
[1:14:00] second Corinthians chapter four verse
[1:14:02] eight I won't be very long like I said I
[1:14:04] like I like kind of making this and it's
[1:14:06] really encouraging to hear all the
[1:14:08] testimonies and miracles and things that
[1:14:10] the Lord does for us and
[1:14:13] um a lot of times some things that we
[1:14:15] don't probably even would say some of
[1:14:18] the testimonies I heard here today you
[1:14:20] probably wouldn't have give that
[1:14:21] testimony in church
[1:14:23] uh but now you give it for all of us to
[1:14:26] hear and what a blessing it's been and I
[1:14:28] see the acclimation in everybody's faces
[1:14:31] involvements being
[1:14:32] encouragement and uh I I think it just
[1:14:35] really helps us I really do I know it
[1:14:38] helps me so uh but I believe it does
[1:14:41] help all of us to to uh and honestly
[1:14:44] just in the
[1:14:46] few years this Church's existence we
[1:14:48] could probably write a book for things I
[1:14:51] even I said the other day uh if the Lord
[1:14:54] had not miraculously healed Tabitha
[1:14:56] there's no way for me to add another
[1:14:57] baby yes with the autoimmune lupus
[1:15:00] whatever the Dev the devil did the
[1:15:03] doctor for saying if the Lord hadn't
[1:15:05] completely healed her of that there's no
[1:15:07] way Ruth could be here yeah no but
[1:15:10] praise the Lord amen God is a miracle
[1:15:13] working God she is amen thank you Lord
[1:15:16] for this church
[1:15:17] amen amen I am thankful for that I'm
[1:15:20] very thankful
[1:15:23] God's good a lot could go with that but
[1:15:26] the best thing is God is good let's bow
[1:15:29] our heads for a word of prayer if we
[1:15:30] could Lord Jesus it has certainly been a
[1:15:33] wonderful time father hearing about all
[1:15:35] the acclimations and the praise and
[1:15:37] think I trust it's been a sweet smelling
[1:15:39] savior to you Lord you've received it to
[1:15:41] yourself Lord from our hearts because it
[1:15:44] wasn't that how the world would say uh
[1:15:47] coincidence or luck uh if these are
[1:15:51] coincidences then then it these
[1:15:54] coincidences transcend the coincidence
[1:15:57] and it only gets to the place that it's
[1:15:59] you it could only be you Lord and we're
[1:16:01] thankful to you for it and when you want
[1:16:03] to
[1:16:05] give our lips and voice to the Miracles
[1:16:09] and to the things that you do for us and
[1:16:11] done for us and God we just want to
[1:16:14] thank you for it
[1:16:15] I want to give you praise and honor
[1:16:17] glory and then this season of
[1:16:20] Thanksgiving which probably I guess if
[1:16:22] there's a holiday I enjoy the most and
[1:16:24] Lord because it helps me get to the
[1:16:28] place that we want to reminisce and and
[1:16:31] go back to those things that we voice of
[1:16:34] how thankful we are to you yes yes just
[1:16:36] like they were at the time they came and
[1:16:38] Lord gave thanks to you for coming into
[1:16:41] this country into this land and being
[1:16:43] thankful for it a place that they could
[1:16:46] call home that they could call a place
[1:16:49] to worship you in the freedom and
[1:16:51] liberty that that you give Lord to be
[1:16:53] able to do it without the thought or
[1:16:55] fear of Oppression or uh of dominating
[1:16:59] over lord and we had that freedom yet
[1:17:02] today although a mark of the beast is is
[1:17:06] moved forward even into this country
[1:17:08] father you've given us your bride the
[1:17:10] ability to to still do that and to give
[1:17:13] you thanks and praise and we're thankful
[1:17:15] for that we're thankful for all that
[1:17:17] you've done for us Lord uh like sister
[1:17:20] Teresa said would probably be the same
[1:17:21] for all of us we could stand here all
[1:17:23] day probably and think of the things and
[1:17:25] when we finish that testimony another
[1:17:27] one comes in our heart and they finished
[1:17:29] out and another one comes in our heart
[1:17:31] and Lord it could just be that way on
[1:17:33] and on for what you've done for all of
[1:17:35] us today and but God we just want to let
[1:17:38] you know how much we love you how much
[1:17:40] we thank you and praise you you've been
[1:17:42] so good to us Lord and we just uh invite
[1:17:46] your presence once again to continue to
[1:17:48] be with us root over us and speak to us
[1:17:51] and through us through this word Lord
[1:17:52] that it would manifest itself to us once
[1:17:55] again this lesson you give Lord that we
[1:17:57] come to you Thanksgiving in our hearts
[1:18:00] Lord have the remaining part of this
[1:18:02] service Lord under your full control as
[1:18:04] we commit it to you now the name of the
[1:18:06] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[1:18:09] second Corinthians 4 8
[1:18:13] um I'll read one verse of scription then
[1:18:15] I'll let you be seated I just want to go
[1:18:17] to verse 15.
[1:18:20] uh I want to read beginning at eight but
[1:18:22] I will just read 15 I'll let you be
[1:18:23] seated second Corinthians chapter 4
[1:18:27] verse 15. for all things are for your
[1:18:30] sakes
[1:18:32] that the abundant grace might through
[1:18:34] the Thanksgiving of uh the Thanksgiving
[1:18:37] of many redowned to the glory of God so
[1:18:41] you can be seated if you like
[1:18:43] I didn't I did not read that verse that
[1:18:47] has Grace in it at the same time the
[1:18:49] grace came through the door
[1:18:52] praise the Lord but look this verse
[1:18:55] actually had Grace I I almost felt like
[1:18:57] I was summonsing you when I said Grace
[1:19:00] and you came through the door well
[1:19:02] braceable there's a reason for it amen
[1:19:05] but let's go back to verse eight uh
[1:19:08] again just for a few minutes I want to
[1:19:10] read beginning at verse 8. I want to
[1:19:12] read through the rest of this uh the
[1:19:14] focus of course is on that 15th verse
[1:19:16] that I just read there we are troubled
[1:19:18] on every side yet not distressed we are
[1:19:22] perplexed but not in despair
[1:19:24] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:19:27] but not destroyed
[1:19:29] always bearing about in the body the
[1:19:31] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:19:33] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:19:36] our body for we which are uh we live are
[1:19:40] always delivered unto death for Jesus
[1:19:42] sake that the life also of Jesus might
[1:19:45] be made made manifest in our mortal
[1:19:48] flesh that's the third time it said that
[1:19:50] now
[1:19:51] in our bodies our bodies mortal flesh
[1:19:53] it's a third time so far
[1:19:57] in our mortal flesh 12th verse now so
[1:19:59] then death worketh in us but life in you
[1:20:02] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:20:04] according to as it is written I believe
[1:20:06] and therefore have I spoken we also
[1:20:08] believe and therefore speak knowing that
[1:20:11] he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[1:20:13] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[1:20:16] present us with you for all things are
[1:20:19] for your sakes that the abundant grace
[1:20:22] might through the Thanksgiving of men
[1:20:24] you were down to the glory of God for
[1:20:26] which cause we faint not but through our
[1:20:28] uh through our own though our outward
[1:20:31] man perish yet the inward managed
[1:20:34] renewed day by day for our light
[1:20:36] Affliction which is but for a moment
[1:20:38] worketh up work it for us a far more
[1:20:41] exceeding and eternal way of Glory while
[1:20:44] we look not at the things which are seen
[1:20:47] But to the things which are not seen for
[1:20:49] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:20:51] but the things which are not seen are
[1:20:54] Eternal amen now again for a few minutes
[1:20:56] I want to put focus on that 15th first
[1:20:58] so let's let's go back and revisit that
[1:21:01] for a moment because that's what the
[1:21:03] subject is that I want to speak of and
[1:21:05] the subject of what we in our
[1:21:07] testimonies were today and that is for
[1:21:10] for all things or for our sakes
[1:21:14] that listen now that the abundant grace
[1:21:18] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[1:21:20] we've heard the Thanksgiving of many of
[1:21:23] us here this morning
[1:21:24] redound or that is to multiply or or
[1:21:28] abundantly be to the glory of God so our
[1:21:32] Thanksgiving and what our Thanksgiving
[1:21:35] is and the Thanksgiving of our lips to
[1:21:38] the Lord is to magnify and to re and to
[1:21:43] uh uh redound as the scripture says to
[1:21:46] the glory of God the whole thing about
[1:21:49] this was to give glory to God it wasn't
[1:21:51] to give glory to any man it wasn't give
[1:21:54] glory to a pastor or anybody is to get
[1:21:56] all of it is to give glory to God so the
[1:21:59] grace of God
[1:22:01] through our Thanksgiving
[1:22:04] multiplies and re and and redowns to the
[1:22:08] glory of God God gives the grace God
[1:22:12] gives us the blessings God shines his
[1:22:14] light God's with us all the way God
[1:22:16] never leaves or forsakes us God always
[1:22:19] gives these things but it's always given
[1:22:21] by our Thanksgiving to the glory of God
[1:22:25] Amen so when we give thanks to him it is
[1:22:28] to glorify the Lord Jesus it's not to
[1:22:31] put a spotlight on us and I hate to say
[1:22:33] this but I have heard people from time
[1:22:36] to time uh different ones you give a
[1:22:38] testimony and you would think that they
[1:22:40] were the ones that did it uh they does
[1:22:43] this on the eyes of God we're special
[1:22:45] but we're not special in the eyes of
[1:22:47] understanding of who we are as
[1:22:49] individuals God is no respecter person
[1:22:52] but we're not any more special we're not
[1:22:55] any more better we're not any greater
[1:22:58] we're just the children of God and we
[1:23:00] love God and that Glory of God that we
[1:23:02] shed that through our Thanksgiving then
[1:23:04] abounds to the Lord to his glory to his
[1:23:08] glory and honor that's what our that's
[1:23:10] what our testimonies are supposed to be
[1:23:12] that's what our uh giving thanks to God
[1:23:14] is supposed to be it's supposed to be to
[1:23:16] his glory not mine to his glory uh I'm
[1:23:20] nothing special
[1:23:22] God knows that but all that we do gives
[1:23:25] to his glory so if if what we do abounds
[1:23:28] to the glory of God then that is uh that
[1:23:32] is praise to him and that's what we
[1:23:34] should give is always praise to him not
[1:23:36] something to draw attention to ourselves
[1:23:39] oh look what God done for me uh look how
[1:23:41] God's uh done this for me and it's all
[1:23:45] about me me me and it's nothing about me
[1:23:47] it's not about you your testimonies were
[1:23:49] beautiful but it's not about you it's
[1:23:51] about him because that's where the glory
[1:23:54] goes no glory on any of us we're just
[1:23:57] thankful and humbled to God that he does
[1:23:59] it to us for us amen and he gives us the
[1:24:03] very desires of our heart yeah amen
[1:24:05] believing in faith doesn't always happen
[1:24:08] the way we wanted to it doesn't always
[1:24:10] happen the way we think it's going to
[1:24:11] doesn't always happen the way we wanted
[1:24:13] to but God will do it according to his
[1:24:16] word according to get his will and
[1:24:18] purpose that is better for each of us
[1:24:21] you know a lot of times we ask God to do
[1:24:23] things for us and if he were to do it
[1:24:25] exactly the way we wanted it and exactly
[1:24:28] when we wanted it and it would probably
[1:24:30] be to our detriment
[1:24:32] but he does it the way he knows it
[1:24:34] should be done he did notice it when
[1:24:36] it's supposed to be done so it doesn't
[1:24:38] work it works to his glory but to our
[1:24:41] betterment because all in all things are
[1:24:44] as the scripture said there for our
[1:24:46] sakes amen God does it because he loves
[1:24:48] us yes we return our Thanksgiving to him
[1:24:51] not to brag but because we love him if
[1:24:55] God didn't do another thing ever if not
[1:24:58] one more thing that God would do in our
[1:25:00] lives we'd still love him yeah amen
[1:25:03] because our love is not based to him on
[1:25:05] what he's done for us it's based on the
[1:25:08] fact that we love him because he exists
[1:25:10] because of who he is
[1:25:13] I love my wife and I don't love her
[1:25:15] because of what she can do for me or
[1:25:16] what she can give to me or or be to me I
[1:25:20] love her because she is
[1:25:23] I mean when when you've reached a place
[1:25:26] in life where you understand that that
[1:25:29] true unconditional love and you
[1:25:32] recognize well why do I love him why do
[1:25:36] I love her why do I love the Lord
[1:25:39] because I would be asking a lot of
[1:25:41] people why do I love them
[1:25:43] I don't know I just do
[1:25:45] why do you love God because he's done
[1:25:47] this or he's done this or because all
[1:25:49] the testimony is that why you really
[1:25:51] love God no you don't love him because
[1:25:52] of those things
[1:25:54] amen you love him because he is yeah
[1:25:56] that's unconditional love
[1:25:59] if there's a reason for your love then
[1:26:02] your love is conditional it's based on
[1:26:05] this thing
[1:26:06] but if your love is not loved because of
[1:26:10] something they did or said or what it's
[1:26:12] just based on the fact that they are
[1:26:14] that they exist then that's
[1:26:17] unconditional love
[1:26:19] which means regardless of what
[1:26:21] conditions change your love doesn't
[1:26:24] change
[1:26:25] God's love doesn't change for us no
[1:26:27] matter what we do now that doesn't give
[1:26:29] us license to just go openly live in a
[1:26:32] sinful life but no matter what we do God
[1:26:34] still loves us
[1:26:36] that's unconditional love he sent his
[1:26:39] son Jesus his shed his blood that was
[1:26:41] unconditional love he shed it for those
[1:26:44] who trample all over it he said it for
[1:26:47] those who despise it and will reject it
[1:26:50] he shed it for those who wanted nothing
[1:26:53] to do with it but he shed it for them
[1:26:54] anyway
[1:26:55] amen he did they don't want it they're
[1:26:59] not going to get it they don't they
[1:27:00] don't have anything to do with it now I
[1:27:02] know brother Randolph said God came to
[1:27:04] redeem those that were redeemable but
[1:27:06] and that is true that was the ultimate
[1:27:08] purpose but John 3 16 tells us that God
[1:27:11] so loved the world he gave his only
[1:27:13] begotten son and whosoever believed
[1:27:15] so it's for anybody brother Adam said if
[1:27:18] the devil were to walk through that
[1:27:20] blood he'd be your brother right
[1:27:22] well that's not the grace of God I don't
[1:27:25] know what it is if that's not
[1:27:26] unconditional love I don't know what is
[1:27:28] amen amen but if your love is based on a
[1:27:31] condition oh it's my daughter because I
[1:27:33] gotta love her it's my wife so I gotta
[1:27:36] love her it's so-and-so then that's
[1:27:38] conditioned you've based it on that
[1:27:41] condition see but if there's not a
[1:27:42] condition that's unconditional I just
[1:27:44] love you because of just because
[1:27:47] I remember what what do you explain how
[1:27:49] do you explain that
[1:27:51] well how do you how do you explain love
[1:27:55] if you're I don't remember if our kids
[1:27:58] ever come and asked us but what would
[1:27:59] you do if your child came and said uh
[1:28:01] mommy what is love Daddy what is love
[1:28:03] what do you tell them
[1:28:04] I mean I guess you try to give them some
[1:28:06] kind of an explanation but can you
[1:28:08] really explain what it how can you
[1:28:10] explain faith
[1:28:12] he said well I could give a little
[1:28:13] explanation but could you really break
[1:28:15] down what faith really is how do you
[1:28:17] know God exists how do you know God
[1:28:19] exists
[1:28:21] how do you explain that you give a
[1:28:23] little explanation of what you think
[1:28:25] yourself about how do you really explain
[1:28:27] how God that God exists amen you can't
[1:28:31] go down to Walmart and buy it
[1:28:33] you can't go inherited anywhere you just
[1:28:36] you just believe
[1:28:37] you just have faith you just have love
[1:28:40] just because he exists and he exists in
[1:28:43] you and if he exists he exists through
[1:28:46] me then the love of God exists through
[1:28:48] me then the faith of God exists through
[1:28:50] me and I believe it because of the faith
[1:28:52] that exists
[1:28:54] exists amen and it rebounds it magnifies
[1:28:58] it multiplies to the glory of God
[1:29:01] that's why God wants to live his life
[1:29:03] through you God wants to continue to
[1:29:05] ultimately uh take control so that our
[1:29:10] lives are a reflection of him to his
[1:29:13] glory
[1:29:14] to his grace not my accomplishments
[1:29:17] nothing I've done Amen brother Pat said
[1:29:21] I'm thankful that this church well
[1:29:23] friend I know I'm the pastor and I guess
[1:29:26] I'm the founder but it doesn't have
[1:29:28] anything to do with me right right it's
[1:29:30] God
[1:29:32] I if I would have refused to done what
[1:29:35] God Said do
[1:29:37] he'd have brought somebody else right
[1:29:39] right somebody was going to do it
[1:29:42] somebody who's willing
[1:29:43] and that's no glory to any one person
[1:29:45] that's nothing to me that's it's God God
[1:29:49] does it all and all the glory and praise
[1:29:52] goes to him amen Psalms 95
[1:29:56] a man who knew a whole lot about giving
[1:29:59] praise to God right a man who had a lot
[1:30:02] to be thankful for even though he went
[1:30:05] through the things he did even though he
[1:30:07] hit that low point with Bathsheba and
[1:30:10] and Uriah and baby dying and all those
[1:30:14] things and God not allowing him uh to
[1:30:18] sit on that Throne of like uh uh that
[1:30:22] that he said he would sit on the throne
[1:30:23] of David with his son Solomon wood uh
[1:30:27] God promised David that that
[1:30:31] Solomon would be that one to continue to
[1:30:34] carry that into prosperity and as we saw
[1:30:37] the other day brother Graham said that
[1:30:38] was the greatest time that they ever
[1:30:40] knew no Wars and uh the the King was uh
[1:30:46] a man that had a heart for the people
[1:30:48] and uh he wanted to be there to help
[1:30:50] them because remember what was his
[1:30:51] prayer to the Lord he said God I don't
[1:30:53] want riches I don't want wealth I don't
[1:30:55] want all these things I just want to be
[1:30:57] able to judge your people I just want to
[1:30:58] have the wisdom to be able to do that
[1:31:00] and said and God said because you've
[1:31:02] asked for that and not wealth is riches
[1:31:04] I'm giving you both
[1:31:06] amen amen and that was the greatest
[1:31:08] prosperity of time but all that David
[1:31:10] went through he still was a man that
[1:31:13] could be thankful for the for the
[1:31:14] goodness of God in his life amen Psalms
[1:31:17] 95 let's look at this
[1:31:19] we'll start we'll just read a few verses
[1:31:21] of it call oh come let us sing unto the
[1:31:24] Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the
[1:31:28] rock of our salvation and I've heard
[1:31:30] people say that certain people shouldn't
[1:31:32] sing I've heard people say certain
[1:31:34] people shouldn't play an instrument or
[1:31:36] something like that uh they say well the
[1:31:38] the Bible says to make a Joyful Noise
[1:31:41] well yeah it says a Joyful Noise
[1:31:44] and not just a noise a Joyful Noise well
[1:31:47] the joyfulness which ironically people
[1:31:50] kind of chuckle at it doesn't say just
[1:31:53] make a noise it says Make a Joyful Noise
[1:31:55] so so-and-so shouldn't sing because
[1:31:57] that's just noise but it's not for your
[1:32:01] enjoyment although we do enjoy the
[1:32:04] worship of the Lord the Joyful Noise is
[1:32:06] when it's to him right I don't care what
[1:32:08] it sounds like amen and don't get me
[1:32:11] wrong I love them with all my heart but
[1:32:13] brother Graham couldn't carry two in the
[1:32:15] Tim bucket amen amen you listen to it
[1:32:17] song he is off key pretty much every
[1:32:20] time I've ever heard him saying
[1:32:22] forget some of the words throws them off
[1:32:25] into timing I don't know how
[1:32:27] musicians kept up with him because he
[1:32:30] was starting the wrong place at the end
[1:32:32] of the wrong place and be off key and
[1:32:34] but but it was to the glory of the Lord
[1:32:37] amen amen it was to the glory of the
[1:32:39] Lord and that and that's the point that
[1:32:42] that David is making it was a Joyful
[1:32:45] Noise because it was to the rock of our
[1:32:48] salvation
[1:32:49] amen wasn't it wasn't to us it wasn't to
[1:32:53] those standing there it was nice to hear
[1:32:55] but it's to the Lord Jesus Amen Let Us
[1:32:58] come before his presence with
[1:33:01] Thanksgiving
[1:33:02] Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms
[1:33:05] for the Lord is a great God and a great
[1:33:08] king above all gods in his hand are the
[1:33:13] Deep places of the Earth the strength of
[1:33:16] the hills is his also the sea is his and
[1:33:20] he made it and His Hands formed the dry
[1:33:23] land
[1:33:24] hi oh come let us worship and bow down
[1:33:29] let us kneel before the Lord our maker
[1:33:32] that's giving the glory to him and
[1:33:34] that's the whole point that we have here
[1:33:36] let's go to another one here
[1:33:38] so we enter into his gates with
[1:33:40] Thanksgiving and uh and with praise I
[1:33:43] got it on the same page here's Psalms

[1:34:26] God it is he that hath made us and not
[1:34:28] we ourselves it's not us has nothing to
[1:34:31] do with us it's all the praise to him
[1:34:33] amen Thanksgiving to God the title of
[1:34:37] our message today Thanksgiving to God
[1:34:39] it's all about him not not me not us we
[1:34:42] are we are his people and the sheep of
[1:34:45] the of his pasture enter into his gates

[1:35:06] his truth is good his truth is worship
[1:35:09] His truth is Faith his word gives us
[1:35:13] Faith amen and helps us that we are
[1:35:16] thankful for the grace of God that
[1:35:19] abounds in us to his glory
[1:35:21] amen First Chronicles
[1:35:25] let's go to First Chronicles chapter 16.
[1:35:32] amen First Chronicles chapter 16 verse
[1:35:35] 33.
[1:35:41] Chronicles is after Kings
[1:35:46] First Chronicles chapter 16 verse 33.
[1:35:51] then shall the Trees of the wood sing
[1:35:55] out at the presence of the Lord amen
[1:35:58] trees of course David also God through
[1:36:02] David also Compares us to trees amen he
[1:36:06] shall be like a
[1:36:08] tree planted by the rivers of water amen
[1:36:11] then shall the Trees of the wood sing
[1:36:14] out at the presence of the Lord also
[1:36:18] a tree in the forest
[1:36:21] the same thing
[1:36:22] because he cometh to judge the earth now
[1:36:26] remember you go over to Romans 8 you see
[1:36:30] that all creation has been groaning and
[1:36:33] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:36:36] sons of God because knowing that God's
[1:36:40] creation knowing that that that would
[1:36:43] bring about what they lost from the
[1:36:45] Garden of Eden Garden of Eden was
[1:36:48] perfect
[1:36:49] body life animal life human life every
[1:36:53] aspect of God's creation was absolutely
[1:36:55] perfect
[1:36:57] there was no sin there was no lies there
[1:36:59] was no death it was absolutely perfect
[1:37:03] and creation itself including ourselves
[1:37:07] who know and part of God's creation but
[1:37:10] creation itself even body life and
[1:37:12] animal life
[1:37:13] longing and waiting for that time to
[1:37:17] come because they know when it does that
[1:37:19] it brings this uh this creation back
[1:37:22] into its perfect place again
[1:37:24] back into its perfect status that it was
[1:37:27] at the beginning of the Garden of Eden
[1:37:29] when Perfection reigned the animal the
[1:37:33] the the lion could lay down with the
[1:37:35] lamb
[1:37:36] didn't have to be worried about eating
[1:37:38] them
[1:37:39] you didn't have to worry about going in
[1:37:40] uh uh uh getting a rose off a rose bush
[1:37:44] to be stickered by it or the desert or
[1:37:47] something like that didn't exist was
[1:37:49] perfect amen perfect
[1:37:52] that's why the presence of the Lord is
[1:37:56] the the Trees of the woods sing out the
[1:37:58] presence of the Lord because he cometh
[1:38:00] with judgment to the Earth
[1:38:02] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[1:38:05] good for his mercy endureth forever
[1:38:09] David said that many times over and over
[1:38:11] in the in the Psalms and say ye save us
[1:38:15] o God of our salvation and gather us
[1:38:19] together and Deliver Us from the Heathen
[1:38:21] that we may give thanks to thy holy name
[1:38:24] and glory in thy praise blessed be the
[1:38:28] Lord God of Israel forever and ever and
[1:38:31] all the people said amen and praised the
[1:38:34] Lord amen and praised the Lord that's
[1:38:38] one reason I'll enjoy coming together so
[1:38:40] much Saints we come together in this
[1:38:42] place that's Sanctified and set aside
[1:38:44] for the service of the Lord to come in
[1:38:47] and out of the world and to set with
[1:38:49] those of like Precious Faith sister
[1:38:51] Lydia said of like Precious Faith to be
[1:38:54] together amen and Worship the Lord I I
[1:38:57] it would be uh it would be outstanding
[1:39:01] if every one of you could stand up
[1:39:03] sometime it probably wouldn't work that
[1:39:06] way but and see sometimes what I see
[1:39:09] from this perspective and and on your
[1:39:12] faces and in the atmosphere of this
[1:39:14] church and of course Mike is not in his
[1:39:16] head because he sets up here and sees
[1:39:18] the same thing yeah and the worship and
[1:39:20] not just the worship from your mouths
[1:39:23] but the worship from your heart that you
[1:39:25] can feel is just it's tremendous because
[1:39:29] that's the worship of the Lord that's
[1:39:31] and he receives that amen the Lord
[1:39:33] perceives that it's Thanksgiving that we
[1:39:36] give
[1:39:37] being thankful everything that we did
[1:39:40] this afternoon or this morning every of
[1:39:42] the test it was with Thanksgiving
[1:39:44] we give it to the Lord because it's in
[1:39:47] our heart and how thankful we are to God
[1:39:49] it shouldn't take because we should come
[1:39:52] every day should be a Thanksgiving amen
[1:39:54] uh but at least every Sunday when we
[1:39:56] come in together from out of the world
[1:39:58] together together like this is a
[1:39:59] Thanksgiving of course but when it comes
[1:40:01] to that place of a national holiday and
[1:40:04] we have a remembrance as long as this
[1:40:06] nation Stills observes it uh because
[1:40:09] there's there's people that are coming
[1:40:11] against it now but as long as it's there
[1:40:14] doesn't matter because in us it's always
[1:40:16] going to be there the Thanksgiving but
[1:40:19] it's a reminder to us it's a reminder to
[1:40:23] us that of how thankful that we really
[1:40:25] are to God and it's a reminder like
[1:40:28] sister Teresa said you'll probably all
[1:40:29] write a book
[1:40:31] about the things we could go on and on
[1:40:33] about what the Lord has done for us and
[1:40:35] probably go from one Miracle to another
[1:40:37] of how God has been with us and done
[1:40:39] with us and and friend people of the
[1:40:42] world would say well that's just a
[1:40:43] coincidence well you know I'd like to
[1:40:45] come have some scoffer come up here and
[1:40:48] hear all the Miracles and all the
[1:40:50] testimonies for our own end and say
[1:40:52] that's a coincidence that's coincidence
[1:40:54] coincidence it's coincidence it gets to
[1:40:57] the place friend that it's it cannot be
[1:40:59] coincidence anymore
[1:41:00] The Coincidence would transcend the
[1:41:03] coincidence
[1:41:04] it's just not possible it's not feasibly
[1:41:07] humanly possible to believe that all
[1:41:10] these coincidences that just could
[1:41:12] continue to unfold and keep happening
[1:41:14] there's a God behind it there's a God
[1:41:17] somewhere that controls it all and it
[1:41:19] brings it to pass amen and lets it
[1:41:21] happen and and blesses us with it praise
[1:41:24] the Lord because it's him that controls
[1:41:26] it one more scripture Psalms 116 verse
[1:41:30] 12.
[1:41:31] we'll start with verse 12. psalm 16 12
[1:41:35] what shall I Render unto the Lord for
[1:41:38] all his benefits toward me
[1:41:41] what shall we in other words what shall
[1:41:43] I give back
[1:41:45] what shall I give in return for what God
[1:41:48] has done for me
[1:41:49] Fred how could we ever
[1:41:52] give enough back to him for what he's
[1:41:55] done for us
[1:41:56] if I lived a million lifetimes I
[1:41:59] couldn't give back to him what he's done
[1:42:01] for me in one instance
[1:42:03] it's just not possible and that's what
[1:42:06] David I believe that's how the scripture
[1:42:08] reads and he's saying what shall I
[1:42:10] Render unto the Lord what can I give to
[1:42:13] him amen of all the benefits he's given
[1:42:16] me
[1:42:18] I will take the cup of Salvation and
[1:42:21] call upon the name of the Lord
[1:42:23] I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in
[1:42:26] the presence of all his people
[1:42:28] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:42:31] death of his Saints oh Lord truly I am
[1:42:34] thy servant
[1:42:35] I am thy servant and the son of thine
[1:42:38] handmaid thou has loosed my bonds I will
[1:42:41] offer to thee the sacrifice of
[1:42:43] Thanksgiving give me nice kids I will
[1:42:46] offer to thee the sacrifice of
[1:42:48] Thanksgiving and will call upon the name
[1:42:50] of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the
[1:42:54] Lord now in the presence of all his
[1:42:55] people in the course of the Lord's House
[1:42:58] in the midst of the old Jerusalem praise
[1:43:01] ye the Lord
[1:43:03] amen what can we do
[1:43:06] what can we give what can we say
[1:43:10] what could we ever accomplish
[1:43:14] sister Teresa did a lot of good things
[1:43:18] but you can't work your way to heaven
[1:43:19] right and there's no way to ever get
[1:43:22] enough
[1:43:23] for what God has done for us yes and all
[1:43:26] the good deeds people spend their lives
[1:43:28] with good deeds
[1:43:29] we do good deeds and we do as the Lord
[1:43:32] gives us to do as the Lord provides for
[1:43:34] us to do as the Lord leads us to do we
[1:43:36] do as we do on as unto him but whatever
[1:43:39] it is is unto him
[1:43:41] we do it as we do it unto him so what
[1:43:44] can we give there's nothing we have to
[1:43:45] give
[1:43:46] there's absolutely nothing so what do we
[1:43:49] do Lord
[1:43:50] I I pray that you accept my feeble
[1:43:53] prayer my my praise to you my
[1:43:57] Thanksgiving to you
[1:43:59] because I am truly thankful Lord and
[1:44:01] when you express that in a group of
[1:44:04] people like this and let it ring of
[1:44:06] course to us but to the Lord
[1:44:09] God looks at it and he says now that's
[1:44:10] my son
[1:44:12] that's my daughter amen it's not
[1:44:15] something that you have to do something
[1:44:16] that you have to give it's like having
[1:44:18] regular children even amen we weren't
[1:44:21] looking for anything to give be given in
[1:44:23] return amen but when the when your baby
[1:44:26] comes up and hugs and says I love you
[1:44:28] Daddy
[1:44:31] that that's what else do you need right
[1:44:34] amen it's nothing we can give him but we
[1:44:36] do can give him our we can't give him
[1:44:38] our thanks amen we can continue to offer
[1:44:42] him Thanksgiving with our actions with
[1:44:44] our lives with the things we do with our
[1:44:47] worship when we come into His presence
[1:44:49] in this place and we come into here
[1:44:51] worshiping him and singing songs of
[1:44:54] worship and Thanksgiving to God Amen
[1:44:57] when you're sitting there and gorging
[1:44:59] ourselves over the wonderful food that
[1:45:01] we're probably gonna have Thursday just
[1:45:03] continue to remember and be thankful for
[1:45:06] what God has done for you amen not
[1:45:09] necessarily the food and the family and
[1:45:12] the atmosphere and all those things but
[1:45:15] the fact that God has chosen you
[1:45:18] that God has amen put something in our
[1:45:22] hearts God has given something in our
[1:45:25] lives to want to worship him with Amen
[1:45:28] to praise him with you praise the lord
[1:45:31] it's all the things like brother Dennis
[1:45:33] is talking about and coming to church
[1:45:35] and and tithing and offering and giving
[1:45:38] and what we give of ourselves and what
[1:45:40] we give of our time and what we give of
[1:45:42] our intelligence and all the things that
[1:45:45] we do like those those are all gifts
[1:45:46] from God that God's gift to us that we
[1:45:49] just return back to him and it just
[1:45:52] boils down to the fact that friend you
[1:45:54] just you can't out give God I mean I
[1:45:57] don't I don't mean to say that what the
[1:45:58] Lord wanted me to give to brother Noel
[1:46:01] was like I regretted uh but you know it
[1:46:05] was something unusual
[1:46:08] having no idea
[1:46:10] when I sat there and I'm opening these
[1:46:12] letters for my trip and I opened this I
[1:46:14] said what is this who is this even from
[1:46:18] it was almost the exact same amount that
[1:46:21] you give what you give to the Lord it
[1:46:23] returns back to you yes Saints 104 and
[1:46:26] it doesn't have to be monetary but just
[1:46:29] the blessings of God that he gives and a
[1:46:32] sound mind and body and blessings and
[1:46:34] the strength that God gives us it's just
[1:46:36] it's beyond measure but my dad taught me
[1:46:39] years ago years and years ago he said
[1:46:42] God shovels bigger than yours
[1:46:45] amen you can't out give God because his
[1:46:48] shovel's bigger than yours amen
[1:46:51] praise the Lord so all that we give to
[1:46:54] him
[1:46:55] amen it's just it just giving right back
[1:46:58] but we thank him for it don't we it's
[1:47:01] the grace of God Amen through the
[1:47:04] Thanksgiving of many
[1:47:06] that abounds to the glory of God
[1:47:09] amen so we took the grace of God this
[1:47:12] morning
[1:47:13] amen we we we multiplied added the
[1:47:17] Thanksgiving to him for it and we gave
[1:47:20] him praise amen glorified him with it
[1:47:23] praise the Lord let's stand if we could
[1:47:27] everything
[1:47:31] so with that Happy Thanksgiving to
[1:47:33] everybody
[1:47:34] I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving
[1:47:36] together
[1:47:37] amen
[1:47:39] it's uh it's a time of
[1:47:42] celebration of Thanksgiving that God has
[1:47:46] blessed us with amen I'm thankful for so
[1:47:50] many things
[1:47:51] I'm I'm thankful to live in this country
[1:47:53] where we still at least as of right now
[1:47:56] we still have the freedoms to worship
[1:47:58] them and to meet like this and to have
[1:48:01] our Bibles and to read them and to live
[1:48:03] according to the dictates in our hearts
[1:48:05] of the Lord so amen I'm thankful for
[1:48:07] that amen thankful for all of you I'm
[1:48:11] thankful for the blessings of your lives
[1:48:14] in my life amen your your life enhances
[1:48:18] my life and I appreciate that and I
[1:48:20] thank God for that amen never would
[1:48:23] imagine in a million years but God knows
[1:48:25] how to orchestrate and bring it all
[1:48:27] together so praise the Lord thankful to
[1:48:30] God for that amen let's sing this course
[1:48:33] we probably all know what I think we
[1:48:35] have

[1:50:12] amen
[1:50:14] amen praise the lord well speaking of uh
[1:50:18] giving
[1:50:19] praise to the Lord with the fruit of our
[1:50:21] lips and making a Joyful Noise let's
[1:50:25] continue to pray for a song leader
[1:50:28] amen if you would sometimes I I forget
[1:50:31] about it and just kind of get into the
[1:50:33] mode of doing it but it would sure be a
[1:50:36] blessing if we had a good song leader
[1:50:37] and someone that could carry a tune
[1:50:40] would be really nice I'd appreciate the
[1:50:43] Lord and then and it would help me too
[1:50:45] but good there's nothing like a good
[1:50:48] anointed god-called song leader amen so
[1:50:52] please I'd continue that we would just
[1:50:55] continue remembering praying for that
[1:50:56] too amen I haven't heard sorry we'll
[1:51:00] give thanks for the one we have too well
[1:51:02] thank you brother I appreciate that I'll
[1:51:05] keep torturing you if you keep coming
[1:51:07] but
[1:51:09] no I haven't heard from anybody about
[1:51:11] Christmas
[1:51:12] so
[1:51:14] unless somebody says something or
[1:51:15] something changes we'll have service on
[1:51:17] Christmas Day Christmas day is Sunday so
[1:51:22] sure
[1:51:27] a Believer like us and it's going to be
[1:51:29] family and there's going to be
[1:51:31] commitments and I'm just being honest I
[1:51:35] just and that's what I want you know and
[1:51:37] um
[1:51:39] right but I also have a wife yeah please
[1:51:44] so if it's going to be something that
[1:51:46] you're going to be spending with your
[1:51:47] family and going to not be able to be
[1:51:49] here that's okay we cancel that's fine I
[1:51:51] just want to make sure that
[1:51:54] um
[1:51:54] you know we we have service we're going
[1:51:57] to have service and I get 15 picks on
[1:52:00] Christmas morning we're not coming well
[1:52:03] let me know now you know if you're going
[1:52:04] to plan something you're going to have
[1:52:06] something or you're
[1:52:08] we'll cancel
[1:52:09] okay
[1:52:19] and so okay then that that sounds fine I
[1:52:23] knew it would be a difficult thing and
[1:52:25] Sunday uh Christmas mornings are and I
[1:52:28] mean it always has been in my home in my
[1:52:30] family and Chris Christmas mornings are
[1:52:32] just kind of a thing where you come
[1:52:33] together in your family and you
[1:52:36] I I truly understand that so then we'll
[1:52:40] just cancel that Sunday morning
[1:52:41] Christmas day then we'll be canceled the
[1:52:44] other thing I haven't heard anything out
[1:52:45] about uh and I will put that notice out
[1:52:48] so everybody knows you aren't here in
[1:52:50] the text so that everybody remembers
[1:52:53] that remembers that but I haven't heard
[1:52:55] anything else about a dinner either
[1:52:56] anybody has any opinions or thoughts or
[1:52:59] anything about that
[1:53:01] uh if not it's okay
[1:53:03] I think uh what Tina done um last time
[1:53:08] and not you paying the bill I'm not
[1:53:11] saying that we can pay it was good
[1:53:13] fellowship with such a variety of food
[1:53:17] yes and uh amen it was easy to please
[1:53:20] everybody it should go back to the you
[1:53:24] know go guard around yeah that's my you
[1:53:27] know and we like you said we don't
[1:53:29] really have the place you know to have
[1:53:32] yeah so I might ask Craig just to see
[1:53:35] but if nothing comes up like that then
[1:53:37] it used to be in North Carolina there's
[1:53:39] like a clubhouse in every little
[1:53:42] neighborhood
[1:53:43] so there's these clubhouses all over the
[1:53:45] place so you can rent them you don't
[1:53:46] have anything like that here that I know
[1:53:48] of uh these little town club houses they
[1:53:51] had this we call them and all these
[1:53:53] little towns
[1:53:56] apartment was well they even have them
[1:53:57] but they're just there and people rent
[1:54:00] them out or whatever but they won't have
[1:54:02] anything kind of like that I'll ask them
[1:54:04] and see if there's a place here that we
[1:54:05] could it have to be convenient though we
[1:54:07] couldn't go like on the second floor at
[1:54:09] the building next behind us uh and if
[1:54:12] not then maybe we'll do something like
[1:54:13] that
[1:54:14] uh what were the dates again if it is
[1:54:19] safe
[1:54:21] 30 people coming to your house 30.
[1:54:25] when you offer free food people come out
[1:54:28] there
[1:54:29] well I'm not making them all that food
[1:54:33] we had we had the church when we had the
[1:54:36] church school a TLC uh the only way you
[1:54:40] could get teachers parents to come to
[1:54:42] parent-teacher conferences all for free
[1:54:43] pizza
[1:54:44] yeah if you had no free food three
[1:54:47] parents showed up you had free food a
[1:54:49] hundred of them showed up
[1:54:56] for
[1:54:58] fourth or 11th
[1:55:03] uh well wait a minute
[1:55:09] no it had to be the fourth or fourth or
[1:55:12] the 18th
[1:55:14] I can't do the 11. there had to be the
[1:55:17] fourth of the 18th
[1:55:20] how would the fourth work
[1:55:23] how about I put a text and you can just
[1:55:24] text me back what works for you best
[1:55:26] instead of trying to have you stand and
[1:55:28] discuss it here
[1:55:29] but the fourth will probably be better
[1:55:31] because it's not that close to Christmas
[1:55:33] it's not so close to Christmas that it
[1:55:37] s uh conflicts
[1:55:39] and it's still a couple of weeks away
[1:55:41] and if we just do like the Golden Corral
[1:55:43] and yes I will be paying for it so
[1:55:46] that's not up for negotiation
[1:55:49] um
[1:55:51] then it would be the four
[1:55:53] okay so okay so mark that mentally and
[1:55:58] check your calendars or whatever you do
[1:56:00] and see if something if that would work
[1:56:03] um if it's not let me know if that works
[1:56:05] then we'll attend Sunday after church
[1:56:07] yeah
