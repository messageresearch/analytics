walks with me amen yes number three let's sing that [Music] there's an anointing in them amen it draws us closer to god and of course like i said last week god lets us know what pleases him and what doesn't what types of music pleases him and what doesn't yes he always lets me know that the flesh me like a certain type of music i'm sorry brother what's on my heart uh then you know certain type of music you know i remember you know how brother uh green had pardoned uh a certain situation that was going on in the church because of the music and the style of the music that had changed me and brother anthony milano i don't know if you all remember him oh yeah we had caught that before it even has probably even so and i know you know that's and he always checks me on that that kind of what pleases him and what doesn't amen and the flesh may get to go on with that you know what i mean there's two natures we know that the spiritual side is the outside uh and so that the spiritual side lets you know to me god to me how he deals with me that side and this is god's side the other side of the world inside he lets me know that music is just something about it it is a lot of it won't be in heaven amen that's what he do that's how he shares it with me yes so uh you know and i i say and i i come to the conclusion lord nevertheless not my will but i will be done amen can i say something about that to verify that i always have a song on my heart it's not always something i can bring here but it's always for my situation or something i wake up with it i want to sleep with it i work with it and it always changes throughout the day and i know that my angel does always behold the father's face so i know where that music is coming from and it's not boogie woogie it's heaven's amen that's true yeah the holy spirit certainly uh right it divides it that's exactly right amen let's sing that with all our hearts to him let's just stand could we sing that and prepare for our prayers [Music] and the voice [Music] the son of god [Music] he talks with me and he tells me i am [Music] no [Music] he speaks and the sound of his voice [Music] within my heart [Music] i am [Music] has ever known [Music] his voice to me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] has ever known amen praise the lord jesus aren't you thankful for that amen aren't you glad he walks with you talks with you he's with you everywhere you go he promised to never leave us or forsake us amen but he would be with us all the way even to the end i believe he's with us every step of the way amen i'm singing and praying thanking god for being such a good friend to me you know times that you know that you need somebody times you know you need to have somebody to talk to there's times excuse me when there's times that you know that you need to have somebody with you you need to have somebody there amen you know there's times in your life where you just got to have somebody else with you and you know regardless of what else anybody else is doing you know that that drops down in your heart and tells you i'll be there i am there and you know he's there amen that becomes that that's the have to know that he is with us and then sometimes you even feel his presence moving in your spirit you feel his presence all around you and know that he's real amen although the darkness of the world and those demons try to come in and press you out jesus comes and raises the standard against that amen praise the lord and you know he's there he walks with you talks with you praise the lord it reminds me of my wife's one of my wife's sayings uh footprints on the sands of time he looked back and saw the one set of footprint and thought lord why did you leave me during the darkest hardest time those footprints are mine amen amen those aren't your footprints those are my footprints amen praise the lord and i'm there's nothing to substitute for that friend no nothing amen nothing you won't find anything in the world you won't find anything in your finances your judgment uh your houses your cars your lands you won't find anything like it yes amen praise the lord so what do we need all that we need is him all that we need is him seek ye therefore the kingdom of god and his righteousness and he'll add all these other things to you amen but he still never leads us or forsakes us praise god so thankful for that amen god bless the house of god today appreciate each one of you coming being here today trust the lord bless you richly and have a good day amen it's uh the devil's satanic day and i guess they can do that they always claim you know it's for the children i think my if there's anything in the world you want to keep your children away from it's that right yes for the children my goodness i mean adults might know better but keep your kids away from that mess but to the day that the country celebrates satan that we i can celebrate something else amen so happy anniversary to my wife i will go say halloween happy anniversary 49 years ago today my wife came to the united states so we always celebrate this day well celebrate it you know thank god for that day that he brought her here uh to come have her amen and must be together so 49 ago today amen the lord brought her to the united states and i'm so thankful for that so that's that's the day to me october 31st is that to me so praise the lord so i celebrate it based on that fact uh they can do whatever they want if you want some candy i'll go buy you to walmart buy some candy and you can even say well don't say trick-or-treat that's devil there there's spirits behind that friend you remember brother green called us about abracadabra right and the father-son ghosts and the wicked the demons that follow those things it's the same thing with that is it follow that right amen and i'm thankful i thank god this morning dude he got rid of that place do you imagine all the demons that hover around those places and amen but thank god we have the freedom and liberty to to serve him and have a good service today and have his holy spirit sweep through this place just like it did on the day of pentecost yes did you come with that expectation today yes amen i did i stood here this morning and pray for that come to of course i do that every service but the street through here like he did on the day of pentecost because when he did that he filled all the house right and he sat on every one of them and it went in everyone praise the lord that's what i want amen jesus now if you have your bibles we'll turn over to uh first thessalonians chapter four first thessalonians chapter four um we're getting down i believe to the winding winding down part of this the rapture we're in the rapture part 18 and then the rapture part 18 first thessalonians chapter 4 would begin of course with verse 13. we're actually going to begin to look at this scripture to teach on this morning so first thessalonians 4 13 before we let us by our heads again for another word of prayer father god we thank you so much lord for the blessings that you give for the love the grace the the mercy lord everything that you are you give to us lord we're we're just the beneficiaries of the benefits of heaven god that you unleash upon us every day we thank you god for the truth to know that when the world is in darkness and gross darkness the people god there's still a light that shines there's still that gospel light that shines lord through your children today and that light that comes from your gospel and illuminates to reach one of us father to show into this world that there is still light there is still a truth there is still a god upon this earth there is still a moving of the holy spirit that is moving through each and every one of us father internationally a bride worldwide father to represent you in this last day lord to be your representative to be your example to be what you would live through us on a daily basis god we want to be that we desire father you would you would show us more and more god because lord is as more is given to us more is held accountable to us we're responsible for more father but lord we we welcome the challenge we relish the opportunity lord to take all the revelation all the word all the spirit everything that you give us father and multiplied a million times god and let your light shine wherever we go lord just help us father in this service we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt andrew and phil trade this service in any way that you get the glory the honor and the praise for all that is said and done as the world is celebrating satan today as this well the country i don't know if the world celebrates it but i know our country celebrates satan today although the celebration of satan goes on every day all around the world father we celebrate you god it's you father that we celebrate we've come here today out from the world lord and out from the things of the world in this building that you provided for us lord to celebrate you to celebrate your resurrection to celebrate your word to receive that revelation and what you have to be done and said thank you for those that have come today may you bless them exceedingly may may you bless those who may be streaming today or those who may not have been able to make it for whatever reason we thank you so much for your grace and mercy your blessings and love and may what you have desire to accomplish in this service today be accomplished through us we ask it in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them with your us sleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen you can be seated if you'd like i i i failed to mention and i sincerely apologize for uh not writing down sister norma uh husband ronnie is not feeling well uh he's kind of been in and out of feeling bad better feeling bad and he's not been for the past couple of days he's not been feeling well i'm assuming uh believing that sister norm is probably at home with him trying to take care of him and help him so please remember brother ronnie epperson if you would that lord would just touch him not necessarily physically the physical touch can come after the spiritual touch spiritual touch is what we desire more than anything for our brother and uh believing he's going to be here just like leah and different ones and families sitting next to sister norma in church here soon and very soon amen but he has been under the weather a little bit so just pray for him if you would now we're going to start this uh from verse 16. i want to go back and read uh what we just read read now the 18th time uh every time that we begin this rapture segment that uh the lord has given us uh each time and i want to major on verse 16. let's go back to the other portions of the verse because verse 16 deals specifically with the shout the voice the trump and i want to begin that today i don't know how long it's going to take i have things the lord give me on the shout and i actually brought it down a little bit from i tried to condense into one service i just don't know that that's going to be possible but i kind of thought maybe each shot voice trump would take a service i'm not sure but uh however the lord leads that's what i want to do but that's what i want to begin on today is to shout the voice to trump of course we know the shout is the first thing that takes place but let's go back to verse 13 because i want to i want to background and hit some highlights of this particular scripture reading before we get to that point okay so uh let's just do that first we'll just take a few minutes but i would not have you to be ignorant brother now paul is is writing here to the church at thessalonica uh about this particular event of the advent of the coming of the lord this particular coming of the lord and and when he begins to approach the subject he tells them first of all he says i would not have you to be ignorant now ignorant is it doesn't mean you uh uh know something and have a differing or a bad opinion about it ignorant means you don't know right right amen and you know brother branham said that a lot of times people don't know how to do certain things he actually tell it specifically about tithing and offering but he said they don't specifically know how to do certain things because they haven't been taught right right right yes uh and that that being taught right means a lot yes because being taught right helps a person uh beyond the point of ignorance because if you're taught right you can't claim ignorance because if your ignorance means you don't know but if you've been taught right that means you know now it's your uh it's in your lap to decide what you're going to do with it at that point but paul's saying i don't want you to be ignorant about this fact i want to teach you properly so you know what is about to unfold what we are to expect what we're looking to amen and i believe that same christ for today now i don't believe any of us in here reach the level of ignorance i believe we've all been taught right through the years and read the scripture and the lord has revealed it to us but understanding his point here is that it there needs to be a teaching on it it needs to be taught right so there's not an ignorance about it concerning them which are asleep now of course he's talking about those that have passed on uh died i don't usually if you've ever noticed my verbiage when i talk about somebody that we say or the world says died i don't normally use the verbiage died especially when we're referring to a christian i i say praise passed on or passed away because i don't believe a christian can die uh their bodies might go to the grave but that body even is gonna come up again one day right so i just don't believe there's death to a christian so i very seldom use the word death so paul here is saying asleep jesus used the same phrase he said use the same word falling asleep they when life needs their body it's a matter of going into a state of rest or being asleep that she saw not now listen i want us to see this part very closely especially since so many people have been falling asleep in this time right this particular point that paul's making concerning them which are asleep that is sorrow not now that's that sorrow is excessive grieving that's uh we know the bible says there's a time to mourn right amen there's a time to live there's a time to die there's a time to mourn uh there's a time to weep there's there there is that time but when that time is past paul is i believe paul is referencing to a continual excessive grieving over a particular individual or something now obviously there's the morning that we have in the grieving but the sorrow that some people have reached to the place of a lack of faith right because their grieving is for whether that person is if they'll never see them again now of course a lot of people don't believe that when you die that you will ever see that person again that's it the finality that's all there is to it but but paul's trying to give us some encouragement that that the heaviness of our grieving doesn't continue to perpetuate it doesn't continue to carry on we get to the place where we realize although we mourn and we grieve and we miss that we don't continue to sorrow for that person because we know that they have hope and we have hope that they died in christ don't sorrow as those who have no hope there's a lot of people that die that that die without christ right and when they die without christ what hope do they have right and the ones that are alive and remain at that point that that are relatives or loved ones of those people and they passed on with no hope they grieve and sorrow heavily because there's no more hope of further advancement in the lord because once life leaves this body that's it that's the dividing point that's the separate i've always said if there's life in the body if there's breath in the lungs there's hope but when that breath is gone then that's the end of it that's it that's the finality of it and paul's saying now don't sorrow like those who have no hope don't sorrow like the unbeliever don't sorrow so much in greece so heavily it gives the the implication that you'll never see that person again because we do have a hope that we will see them again amen so don't be ignorant over the fact that when those die in christ that we won't see them again we will see them again they're just asleep right and when they when when christ rose it just proved that we will rock those that taste death they will rise as well and and don't sorrow to the point that it becomes so grieving heavy greedy because that heavy grieving to that point will actually disturb your spirit right and if that heavy grieving disturbs your spirit then that makes you less than what you should be that brings you to a place where you drop down to a level that you're less useful maybe that's not the right verb it's a pardon but you become less useful to the lord than what you would be in your ought to be conditioned amen we've talked about that before god has us in our ought to be conditioned where we should be and anything sickness or or disease or affliction or or or this point of grieving that disturbs your spirit so much it brings you down or not or to be below where you should be right to serve god because it consumes you it takes over your thoughts it takes over your being it takes over your actions uh your waking moments your dreaming moments uh paul's saying we have hope and that hope is that we will see that person again that will we that we will spend eternity together you know that that's really the foundation just sharing something with you that is really the foundation of my prayers when i pray for your loved ones uh when i pray for your loved ones my prayer to the lord is that that that our family is saved so that we'll spend eternity together and based on that prayer of faith i believe that for all of our families for all of our loved ones i believe that those who are here and those who may have gone on already i believe that right amen not because i prayed it but just because of the faith that i have in god to honor a request of the hearts of his people right amen just like that place next door is gone he honored the request the hearts of his people this is no different friend he honored the request the hearts of the people so i believe that and the whole foundation of it is lord let them be saved so that we spend eternity together yes that they will raise together in heaven and that we'll be together again and spend eternity together isn't that the whole thing and now the whole point amen praise the lord so we don't sorrow as people who have no hope or those who know they have passed without hope amen for a christian there's hope and we believe that you can't look at the circumstances don't don't worry about what it might have looked like or what the circumstances might have presented themselves just look at the grace of god right implore the mercies of god if you want to look at anything like that look through the lens of god and through the grace and mercy of god friend it's more bountiful i know we preach about it we talk about it we sing about it we we give god glory for it but there is no way that we will ever be able to in our little human pee brains to grasp the the vastness and the all-encompassing nature of the grace and mercy of god we'll just never do it it just is not possible we we get a little glimpse of it and and what god's done for us and our families but there's just it just will never happen to be able to grasp the entire scope of what the grace of god means to us what it does for us and and our faith and our loved ones and and the whole the whole picture uh all of it combined together god's grace his mercy goes stretches and and reaches places we can't even imagine amen well it reached me so that proves that point in itself amen reach you didn't it amen praise the lord then is anything too hard for god no amen it's not so let's continue 14 first for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him praise the lord it's that simple that's what we're looking for that's what that's the next aspect of this that we're talking about i believe that we're looking for the dead in christ rising yeah amen now you don't wait for the dead in christ to rise to get right with the lord that's too late yes to me i believe that's too late because i believe if you're not ready getting christ right you won't see him anyhow right right and if you don't see him then what's the point right it won't be for you so the the the getting right is is is paramount right now your heart right with the lord right now filled with the holy ghost born again having god living in you through you being right with god right now is the most important thing amen even if the rapture doesn't happen today or in the morning you might not be here in the morning right i might not be here in the morning so it doesn't matter what the day of the rapture is what matters to me is when life leaves my body be right with god now that's the most important thing have your heart right with god right now amen because he may come in the morning he may come for me right now he may come for us before this service is over we don't know amen but we do know that those who are with the right with the lord then we will see them so that's what we're looking for those that god is going to bring back we've talked about the past couple of sundays that that god is going to bring with him amen and they're going to appear unto many and we will see them we will know them amen i believe at least my family i believe i know i know my dad and my mom and uh my son sister brother i'll know my family right and then there may be others that come up from years gone by i may not know amen but that's okay you know there was a time i didn't know any of you but what did i do what did we do we stuck our hand out god bless you it's nice to meet you right now i know you says amen it's pretty simple amen for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent or brother adam again said that word is hinder them which are asleep 16th verse now for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain which i refer to as the alive and remain group shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord now as we start his embarking on this shall voice trump now i i don't have any new or special revelations uh obviously like i said before when brother branham took the rapture message and he hit specific highlights he hit like six different things uh i haven't counted them i'm just guessing that that he just touched on and this is one of them the shout out the voice drum i don't say that i have anything uh new or better or different i don't believe there is but uh but just from the highlights and taking and breaking them down a little bit scripturally even if that's okay so today we we see that it starts with the voice so let me read this uh let me read this quote to you it's in the rapture message and brother graham says three things happen and we just said them to shout the voice to trump amen so the subtitle i guess to this would be the shout to shout the voice to trump a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before jesus appears the shout of voice of trump has to happen before this appears now jesus does all three of them while he is descending when he is descended brother brown says all three let me read this again jesus does all three of them when he's descending amen in his coming now somebody now that in itself would dispel so many other pentecostal i'll just say ideals the seminary ideals of just uh uh you know a boulder lightning or a clash of thunder or something like that uh and and bam there it is but we read the other day i think it was last sunday first of first corinthians 15 where it says in the moment the twinkling of an eye well now a moment is a period of time amen it may be to us a flash but remember a thousand years with us is just a day with the lord right so uh what does that moment mean to god right so what does it mean when people say oh it's all of a sudden bam there it is well that that's remember what we talked about the scripture isn't always as we read it like a newspaper right or a magazine or an article or something god has hid in here the things that he desires only for his bride to see because it's it's revealed it's written by the holy ghost and it's revealed by the holy ghost and if it's revealed by the holy ghost then only those that have the holy ghost is it going to be revealed to amen others look at it and say oh there it is that's simple well you know it's not because brother branham says jesus does the shout the voice and the trumpet while he is descending now that phrase where that word descending leaves you with an understanding that this is a period of time it's not just a boat of lightning and there it is right now you think about on the day of pentecost on the day of pentecost acts 2 says that suddenly there came but how long do we know because we don't know that it took for it to get to that point we don't know was it instantaneous well it was to them is it instantaneous for this well it will be to us but if we could pull back the cover to look beyond the curtain to see the spiritual aspect god i say this is my opinion god is likely already descending amen based on what brother branham said right obviously because to shout the voice of trump he does while he's descending and we know what the shout is let me finish reading this what is the shelf it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride now he says the bride but what he means is the alive and remain group amen now of course or this last day bribe there's there's people that have gone on in the lord that were in this truth and passed on before and they will resurrect who but there's also the alive and remain group amen so we we the word is said and i've done it i know hundreds of times brother brandon did it hundreds of times when we say the bride when actually we're talking about this last day the bride goes back all the way like we said before the bride goes all the way back to paul right for this new testament bride from the first church eight till today comes from everyone that died in christ through the through this these church ages it is the bride so when he says the bride he's talking about this end time bride this this end time group that that is under the auspice of that message that that was brought through brother brown now brother what is the shout so the question then is uh what is the shout the shout is the message going forth the message going forth so the shout is the message now a shout is a message right but the specific shout that we're talking about for this last time is that specific shout of the message that brother branham says it's the message going forward now a shout is a message you could shout a message out you can shout without a message uh you could you could you give out a shout it still has a message even though there may be no verbiage behind it it still would have a message they could could have uh uh could have a meaning to people who would shout out a command to an animal or something but a shout is a message it it sends something forth and the greek now this is the only place that this greek word is used in the new testament only place is this shout here and there's there's i didn't count them but there's dozens of the words shout in the uh or several i'll just say that shouts in the new testament and in the bible but this is the only one this word here is different from the others it says an order or command specifically a stimulating cry now i like that part of it that's that's actually that's stimulating christ the reason i printed that that stimulating cry when that voice rang out it wasn't brother branham there was something behind that voice of that man that stimulated something that was in you so when that message was spoke it stimulated something that was it that was within you and that stimulating cry as we know and called the message was something that spoke to you and ministered to you now there's people around the world that can listen to the exact same voice they can read the exact same book they can hear the same message and it means nothing to them remember i think it was billy paul gave the testimony uh some guy at work gave out a message book to another to a co-worker and the co-worker took it read it he came back said i don't want to read one more thing this man has to say don't give me any more of his books and the brother's like well what's the matter he said well that man and that book called me a buzzard and the man took the book and he said well that's funny because the same man in the same book called me an eagle right amen so the song it's a message that speaks to them to others it's just words you didn't just you're a buzzard that's sad to say but the identification of it is what happens when the message comes forth same thing when jesus came so who is the message to so if the shout come which was the message who is the shout to the shouts not to the whole world no the shout's not to uh just anybody that thinks they are a christian the shout is to the bride amen that's what the shouts for the shout is for the bride the show was a message and what did he say to bring forth the bride so there had to be something because again this is an international bribe so there had to be something that would unite this bride internationally underneath it the auspice we know about the jesus brother graham said that the christian worships under the auspice of the shed blood of christ amen so what is that auspice what is that umbrella that that is going to unite the believer from around the world in all nations kindred tongues people what is it that's going to unite them the message the shout the shout going forth is what unites him brings forth the bride for this last day that's what the that's what the point of the shout and the message is for who is the message who is the shout out the shout is christ the message is christ this is the message friend or a derivative of it this came from this if this came from this and this is christ then what is this if this produced this and they produced us then what does what does that make us amen the message the shout is the message the message is christ which is which is what i believe that's why brother branham said the jews would receive the message one day of course they'll receive the message because they'll their eyes will open they'll see who the messiah is and they'll uh they'll put on sackcloth and actually they'll mourn and lament that they they they killed their very messiah they'll receive the message because the message is christ the shouts to the bride it's the message to bring her together to unite her together it's that voice that cries out amen that cries out now let's go to matthew chapter 25. matthew chapter 25 and remember now brother branham said that jesus does all three of these descending now i say brother branham said the bible says that that's exactly what it says for the lord himself shall be sent from heaven with a yes i mean that's not just what brother brown says that's what the bible says amen the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout so it has to be while he's descending because that's what the bible says now if we think about this in the international context of of an international bride think about this uniting message this uniting shout before we get to matthew 25 think about this united this uniting shout this uniting message that's supposed to bring out all the believers under that same umbrella under that same office now we're we're fortunate we're blessed because we live in the united states we speak english brother branham from the hills of kentucky uh spoke english from the united states in fact i'm doubly blessed because he speaks my language hence hands totes carry fetch we know i know what all that some you may not i know what all that shiny up a tree i know exactly i was two years old saying up a tree i know exactly what you're getting some people overseas they have no clue what shitty what is that shitty that's not in their verbiage yeah they have no clue what that means but i do and thank god i am i'm glad i do now not that a person has to understand what shinny means uh over in marisha to be able to be in the bride that's not necessary but we're blessed to understand that we're blessed that it's in our language we're blessed to know what he's saying in english and we can listen to it without interpretation without filter without anything else right so we are but what is it now to the rest of the world i remember when brother brennan was born friend there was no internet there was no cell phones there was no email texting whatsapp none of that exists there was no facebook or met or whatever the guy is calling that now there was none of that that didn't exist in fact air travel was what non-existent car traffic was almost non-existent when brother brown was born now i'm not talking about what he was in the prime of his ministry i'm talking about when he was born right just didn't exist so how was that message going to get from the hills of kentucky to those brothers and sisters in singapore or like i said in marisha or in some distant south korean where how are they going to get it right but the message going forth that i i hope i'll get to today to to show that had i think had to get to a point to where this message and the gospel which is the message brought around the world internationally to reach every corner of the far reaches of this planet to every person i mean if you look at matthew 24 look what jesus said he said and this and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations then shall the end come right how is that going to happen it couldn't happen in history even though the earth was smaller at that time or you know parts of the world we didn't they didn't know about existed how would it happen how did it even happened in that way that we're talking about even when brother branham was born to have brought this about around the world right it couldn't now i believe we all could have been filthy rich if we just listened to brother brown because brother brown told us what the cars were going to be like he told us what the uh what the uh the increase in in technology would be amen i mean could you imagine i can imagine from when i was age having a phone in my hand like this didn't even know what a computer was muscle computer information from all over the world yeah it didn't exist when brother brown was here didn't exist even when brother adam died but the message carries on the message continues to reverberate around the world amen why it had to right to fulfill scripture and to bring everybody that's the believer that is the seed of god under that umbrella for the point of hearing that word and that seed coming to life being born again so that we get to the place that when this rapture takes place everyone that is his will hear it and know it amen be revealed to them right that shout had to go forth it had to continue to press forward amen and it still does and the message is still going forth yes amen brother john was talking about listening this morning amen that's it's it's still going forth because it has to amen it's got to bring that fulfillment matthew 25. i had to turn over there matthew 25. i know we've read this a couple of times but um there's a particular part in here we talk about the shout that we want to get to then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the room five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lambs while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry mate there was a shout that went forth a cry was made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him now when they were all slumbering all sleeping foolish and wise virgin alike they were all slumbering and sleeping at that time god sends a shout god sends a cry a message behold the lamb of god though you out to meet him that's exactly what the message does people want to say that brother grant appointed uh pointed them to himself brother i've never appointed anybody to himself he always pointed everyone to jesus christ always i challenged anybody now paul said follow me as i follow christ but i challenged anybody to show me or brother branham encouraged someone to follow him right amen i mean in the context that he was god right right now people still worship him as god baptized his name things like that but that wasn't his doing right no brother random always pointed to god that's why the message the shout the pride went forth to wake up that bride to wake them up and say behold there he is go out and meet him yes greet him well that was that's what the message was for it was to prepare a bride it was to wake her up it was to stir her it was to get her ready and prepared physically mentally emotionally to get ready spiritually of course to get her ready that stirring that come and stirred your heart that that uh uh stimulating cry that went forth as we said that stimulating shout that came forth to tell everybody we're here this is the time be ready don't miss it amen that shout that message that went forth that cry behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him and that was that was the cry that we were to have see and every significant move of god has always come with a shout right you think oh that shout was exclude this last day no it's not right amen that specific shout is yes this specific message through that specific prophet absolutely but every true move of god has always had a message has always had a shout out and has always had a prophet for god to speak through right amen amen always been let's go look at one numbers chapter 23 verse 16. numbers 23 16. now we we we have the scene of bail trying to convince balaam to get him to curse israel you know how it is now look we're all human numbers 23. we're all human we all make mistakes we all do things say things uh we all fall short from time to time things i'm not talking about backsliding we're just talking about in the flesh we're just human and how often would that slip up be in front of somebody else another believer or unbeliever or maybe someone who wants your demise someone who would relish to see you fall right is there anybody in your life like that that would they would be they would be happy if you were injured or hurt there's people like that friend and that's exactly who baloch was balak was that man to israel because israel and balak were at such odds and enemies and baloch couldn't come close to standing up to israel he had he had nothing to hold on to israel so he comes to this hireling prophet balaam and says balaam i'll give you this i'll do this for you if you'll just curse my enemy because see bam's prophecies were true and they came to pass amen even if he was a hireling prophet he was still a prophet and he was doing what he said still come in still standing today we know that amen whoever blesses israel is blessed whoever curses israel's curse probably the only probably the only thin thread that this country is hanging on with god is that we're still blessing israel right amen there were even there were even enough democrats that are out there that refuted some others to give israel and replenish israel with their iron dome system still even that mine so that's probably that that prophecy available is probably that one thin thread that this country is hanging by that that even has any kind of inkling of the blessings of god at all really but is that prophecy whoever's blessed is israel blessed we still bless amen i mean to a point not like we did but to a point still it still does so bailout goes to balaam and and tries to get balaam to curse israel curse my enemy because if you curse money because see that you know they they've made these little mistakes now balaam the they've made these little mistakes and they've done these little things and they've said these little things in the game saying of course see all those things have happened so god's probably mad at them now so since god's mad at them and they've made these little mistakes why don't you go curse them for me god's got to be mad at him so this is the perfect time that they've had little slip ups they've had make their little mistakes so god's got to be mad at them so go curse them and balaam says bring me seven altars set me up seven altars and then seven sacrifices and all and stand beside the stand beside the sacrifice and he says i'm going to go see if the lord will talk to me and god met him there talk to balaam all right said him don't you dare curse what i've blessed and basically everything the opposite of balak balaam had to say and bailout comes back and says what have you done to me you've done exactly the opposite of what i asked for now they're blessed even more it's okay baylor let's go to a different area let's go to a different church let's go to a different place maybe they're not as perfect as the other ones were oh we're all just as human as the next friend we all we all make mistakes and say things we're all human all right amen that that's why thank god there's forgiveness because there's there's the love of god and there's forgiveness and there's moving forward with god there's the bearing of the sin and the sea of forgetfulness and amen but hey let's go to the place because these this church over here they're worse than these guys maybe god will really curse them then 16th first let's read it and the lord met balaam again now this is second time remember balaam goes to him three times before god finally says just go do it do whatever you're gonna do you're gonna do it anyway and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and baylock said unto him what hath the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zipper god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent in other words what i said the first time goes what i told you the first time is what i meant i didn't tell you the first time over here to tell you something different over here that's why brother branham said if god does one way one time he's got to do it the exact same way all the way through he's not god amen and he said he's not a god that he would lie to the son of man he should repent what he said a minute ago is what he meant amen have he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good behold i have received command a commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it praise the lord israel is blessed god has blessed them no matter what they did no matter what they're going to do they are blessed and i have nothing i can do about it right that's right see i i i want you to get to a place from where you don't look at israel this in this look at yourself right yeah and then put yourself in their place i'm i'm a child of god i'm i'm a chosen of the lord i am a hand-picked selected by god child son and daughter a son of god friend amen put yourself in that place you are blessed regardless of what the devil tries to do or say you are blessed no matter what you did done going to do you are blessed and you will always be blessed because god has blessed you and god's not repenting from that god's not taking that back from you oh you made a little mistake i'm reversing my blessings no no no it doesn't work that way god is a god that does not take back on his word amen he stands on his word i cannot reverse it he has not been held iniquity listen this is the point i want to get to now he israel has not been held iniquity in jacob or god i should say uh has not been held iniquity in jacob neither has he seen perverseness in israel remember what does god see amen now look israel made a lot of mistakes right you go and read everything that israel did and coming out of egypt and all the whining and the complaining and the crying you look at all that israel did but what matters what matters what matters is what god sees what matters is what god looks like and what and what he's concerned with and what he saw is no iniquity in jacob neither has he seen in israel the lord is with him and the shout of the king is among them amen the shout of the king was in the camp the word of the lord was in the camp of israel now now you've got a dividing point even through the prophet balaam's words the difference between moses and balaam is that god was with moses and his people yes and the shout of the king was in their camp amen the message the word of god was with moses it wasn't with balaam oh he was a prophet he could prophesy in those things but god the word of god was not with him the shout was not with him the shout was with moses the message was with moses yes and god and moses and israel is who god honored because god was with moses god was moses was god's chosen vessel right god was moses was god's chosen man and that's who god was with even with moses's mistakes and failures god was with him now moses wasn't able to take the children over the promised land amen but he never stopped being a chosen vessel regardless you find them over in revelation 11 we read last week moses and elijah he was still god's chosen vessel not not balaam but moses the shout of the king the message the word of god was with israel god was with them god was leading them god led them by a pillar of clout by the day a pillar fire by night right because god was with them amen he was their chosen that's where the message was look now fundamentally i said look here fundamentally he said who do you say this is uh december 1964. he said now we all blow up the feasts he said uh uh the gang single quarter we're all one and they did the same thing balaam bam told them to we are all one we're all one big family and yeah they you know fundamentally they were but this shot wasn't with them amen the shot was with israel right there's the difference oh we all believe in one god see because moab moab was moab was the son of life amen moab was the product of lot and his daughter they were one they were one big family but they weren't one spiritually god wasn't with moab god wasn't with baylor he was with moses amen the shout was with moses fundamentally they were perfectly right watch balaam up there just as fundamental as any good baptist president maybe i shouldn't have read that today he come up there and there was israel that undenominated group that was a nation israel wasn't a nation it was a people at that time they didn't go uh they didn't want to go god's way after a while they wanted to be like the rest of the nations that's when they failed but they but he recognized balaam even recognized that the shout of god the message the word of god was with moses and israel it wasn't with balaam it wasn't going to be with bala because balaam told him god's done it and i can't reverse it i can't change it amen let's look at another one real quick i'm going to try to get this give me a few more minutes because i want to try to finish this shower i won't finish it because like i said there's so many other things you you go through every church every church age had a shower yes every church age had its message and it's messenger right you had the four gospels you had the four beasts you know the the the lion the ox the the eagle the man you had an anointing you had a message from each one an anointing that followed every one of them but that's all that's a whole other service or two if you will um but let's go to saint john if you gave me those few more minutes i could do like brother wilson does and asked for five minutes from everybody and that that's a that's a brother wilson henry's specialty and he used to pass our church two and three hundred people so can you imagine five minutes per person amen saint john chapter one we're gonna bring it down home finish this up saint john 1 19 talk about john the baptist now and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ now that's exactly what brother branham did although people still continue to follow him they still continue to follow john too he denied that but confessed i am not the christ and they asked him what then art thou elias he said i am not of thou the prophet and he answered no then said then to him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that said what sayeth thou of thyself he said i am the voice amen right of one crying in the wilderness now that voice comes with a shout right make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet ezias and they which were sent of the pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptizeth thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet because he had a message i answered them saying i baptized with water but there standeth one among you whom you know i'm not he it is who can coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe latchet i'm not worthy to unloose these things were done in bet bara beyond jordan where john was baptizing the next day amen praise the lord the message he had been espousing to the people showed up right the message he was telling them about preaching to them about and baptizing them in showed up next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world amen john the baptist forerunning the first coming of christ behold the lamb of god we just read that matthew 25 but matthew 25 is not john the baptist matthew 25's brother the cry that goes forth behold the bridegroom coming go you out to meet him amen that's the that's the introduction of the second advent that's the introduction of his next coming of the one we're looking for ammo this one was his physical corporal body coming and john the baptist was the messenger with the message to introduce that to the people when he saw him coming behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world there he is amen doesn't say but the invocation there uh the invitation go you go follow him amen amen he's the one i must decrease that he increased he's a lord because that was his message the introduction that was to bring it forth the the coming of the messiah the coming of the sacrifice that was his first coming that's why he had that john the baptist introduced or before ran that first coming now we know for the second coming was for reign amen the second coming brother brown full ran the second coming amen or the message the shout the message for run the second coming let me see here look away to jesus he said it's tightening we see it tightening friend don't we i mean i don't know how much longer this united states is going to have the freedoms uh that we have to worship the lord places all around the world don't have that freedom that we have today but you know you say well that's in the constitution friend all it takes is enough like-minded people to get rid of any document that we have right that's right they just get enough like-minded people and you say what that yeah that's gone done with right amen over it's tightening and then when it comes time the press comes to a place where you're pressed out when you're pressed out watch down what i'm telling in a few minutes watch the third pull then see it's absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church and i want to say this he said i've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 33 years ago on the ohio river 1933 he said rather he said everything has happened just exactly listen now he said i may not do it brother says i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world amen amen for sure why for a last day yes for a shout out a shout that goes forth as he is descending preparing his bride getting her those that actually have gone on and the alive and remain group ready you believe that message those each one down to the age they believe their message they live to their message they'll be there amen whether it's martin or luther or wesley or whoever it was message they live to that message they'll be there amen just like this last day bride this message that we follow we live that message will be there amen amen he said i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world for as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming that's why even when brother branham passed away the possibility of this message reaching the far reaches and corners of this world to every ear was not possible or shall i say very improbable in 1965 when he passed away but today with what we've got the technology and and of course donald that but the people that the lord has gotten and coming to the message around the world the books are printed the the audio the the translation and all the different languages oh sure they they uh a person whatever in the far reaches of another country they may have been able to have a book or something but they don't speak english right they may have gotten a tape but they don't listen they don't understand english what good was it to them but in this day with this message still going forth and all the translations and all the work that's been done to get the books to get the tapes to get the message into the hands of the people in their own native language no wonder the message had to forerun the second coming of christ yes because brother brown has been off the scene now for almost 56 years right but the message for run the shout for run the second coming of christ before run the second coming behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he uses a phrase actually from john the baptist amen in the rapture message amen in the rapture message i'll close he said you're not blind people you are sensible people let's settle this out with this now amen you're sensible people if i stood here and said those things for prejudice i say it because it's life because listen now he said because i'm responsible to god for saying it amen that's powerful friend you responsible to god what you what are you responsible to god for amen everybody's responsible to god something somebody yeah amen parents you have children you take it on yourself you're responsible to god for those children yes just like we were when we had children responsible to god for them i didn't care what all the others said i don't care what anybody advice whatever people would tell say advice but that's all fine and good friend but we were the ones responsible for our children not you right right amen not i don't mean you i just mean you generally not not all nobody else we were full of god when brother brown says i'm responsible to god that's a powerful statement and he says i'm responsible to god for saying it i must say it my message he said all the time knowing back there under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing that the message would come praise the lord had to come and here it is them seven seals open mysteries showing all those things what has happened he didn't know what he said but he knew that there would be a message come because that's what he that's what was told to him that's what his responsibility was to get that message out to get that message to the people the spirit of god told him store up that food he meant put that food store that food up in the storehouse why because we need it for today we still need it for right now for today we still feast on that word yes that fresh manna he said therefore and let me finish with this therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout that's i i didn't i know i'm looking at you but that's actually what he said that's not my part that he said that therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout calls the bride together an international pride yes the message the shout calling her bringing her together under under that one auspice amen praise the lord let's stand if we could amen well according to my phone i was only hours not that i think y'all worry about that but amen i guess maybe i do some too much but thank god for that for that message amen with that shout out bringing the people together bringing that bride together is the one thing that shout that message is the thing that brings that alive and remaining group together under that one spirit under that
