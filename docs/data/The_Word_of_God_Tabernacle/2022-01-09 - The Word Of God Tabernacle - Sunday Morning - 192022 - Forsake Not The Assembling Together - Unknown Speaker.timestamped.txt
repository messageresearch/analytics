[20:17] that
[20:19] amen he took a practice test this week
[20:21] and passed
[20:22] so i don't believe that this is going to
[20:24] be any different amen in fact the only
[20:26] difference it'll be is that his score
[20:27] will be higher
[20:29] amen but if it's like real estate when
[20:31] you pass your pass
[20:32] if you pass by one tenth of the point
[20:35] you passed
[20:36] if you fail by a tenth of a point you
[20:38] fail that's all they care about if you
[20:40] pass you pass you move on so
[20:42] but i believe i believe he's already
[20:44] he's gonna pass so but uh please
[20:47] remember him in prayer if you would you
[20:49] also uh last week you remember he put a
[20:51] prayer request for his friend
[20:53] uh
[20:54] he
[20:55] uh put it again here please continue to
[20:57] remember
[20:58] the lady i mentioned last week who at 42
[21:02] is expected by medical standards to die
[21:04] from the flu
[21:06] her name is amy and she is still alive i
[21:09] ask that if it's god's will she'd be
[21:11] made whole so i could use this as a
[21:13] witness and testimony to my friends
[21:16] amen so
[21:17] prairie requested that micah has on his
[21:19] heart if we can remember those we also
[21:21] had a we want to continue to remember
[21:23] brother charlie and sister teresa in our
[21:25] prayers
[21:27] the last report i got from sister teresa
[21:29] last night
[21:30] is she is feeling a lot better
[21:33] she said the doctors called her
[21:34] yesterday and said that pneumonia looks
[21:36] worse but she's feeling better
[21:39] so that's the main thing to me
[21:41] doctors can only read what they can read
[21:43] instruments can only say what they can
[21:45] say but we know by faith in god's word
[21:48] that he has already healed
[21:50] amen she's doing much better
[21:52] um
[21:53] he prescribed more meds but she's
[21:55] feeling much better today this was
[21:57] yesterday
[21:58] or last night
[21:59] she said charlie is
[22:02] uh has not really improved
[22:05] he does say he is ready to meet the lord
[22:08] he also is grateful that so many people
[22:10] are praying for him he's also
[22:12] uh what the doctors have said but i'm
[22:16] thankful that we hold brother charlie up
[22:19] in prayer that he's going to come out of
[22:20] that hospital
[22:21] yes that's my profession that's my
[22:23] confession brother charlie satello is
[22:25] going to come out of that hospital he's
[22:27] going to sit right back there again in
[22:28] this congregation and have church with
[22:30] us
[22:31] amen he has progressed he's come along
[22:34] uh
[22:35] at one point they had him on 100 almost
[22:37] 100 oxygen and he was still not able to
[22:40] breathe and
[22:42] saturate the oxygen
[22:44] but as the weak went along the oxygen
[22:46] level dropped even down to 70 percent
[22:49] the nurses dropped his oxygen to 70
[22:51] percent he started breathing on his own
[22:54] and his oxygen levels were staying good
[22:57] he he's no longer sedated to the point
[22:59] that he even called his brother
[23:01] yesterday if you're friends with david
[23:02] sotelo uh he put out a facebook that
[23:05] charlie called him
[23:07] and said to have people pray for him
[23:10] that
[23:12] not knowing that we maybe not knowing
[23:13] that we already have been
[23:16] intimately affectionately fervently
[23:18] praying for brother charlie amen and
[23:21] believing that god is i already see the
[23:23] improvement god's already
[23:25] it's already moving god's already healed
[23:27] him
[23:28] i believe that
[23:29] amen also sister sheila said uh
[23:32] yesterday that she is feeling a little
[23:34] better this was again yesterday uh still
[23:36] coughing a lot
[23:38] amen so please remember her in prayer
[23:40] you know how that
[23:41] coffin
[23:43] you know in your chest and your throat
[23:45] and all it's it's really difficult so
[23:48] please remember to continue to remember
[23:51] to pray for sister sheila also of course
[23:54] one prayer request that came up
[23:55] yesterday that
[23:57] most of you know about i sent it out
[23:58] brother angel right before church
[24:01] sent me an update about priscilla
[24:04] and he said they're still waiting on a
[24:06] hospital there at northwest urgent care
[24:08] still waiting on a hospital bed
[24:10] uh giving her antibiotics and pain meds
[24:13] but nothing has changed she's still
[24:15] bleeding internally and there's no
[24:17] improvement on the holes in here
[24:18] intestines yet
[24:21] we are waiting for bed to open
[24:24] so they'll transfer her immediately
[24:26] they've done all they can do for her
[24:27] where she's at so she really needs a bed
[24:30] to open up to get in uh for the
[24:33] physicians and all to really see her so
[24:36] he said please continue to pray for her
[24:38] she's in a lot of pain
[24:39] uh was up with her until a 9 a.m this
[24:43] morning and she just fell asleep he said
[24:46] uh he texted me at ten she had just
[24:47] fallen asleep at nine
[24:49] um
[24:51] and they're still praying that a bed
[24:53] comes open uh
[24:55] quickly
[24:56] so please remember her in prayer
[24:59] their surgery is a last resort
[25:02] because the surgery comes with some very
[25:05] high risks
[25:06] the doctors are very concerned that the
[25:10] what they call cocktail of
[25:14] sedation medicine they have to give her
[25:16] could kill her
[25:18] uh so please they're not sure her heart
[25:20] would be able to take it so please
[25:22] remember her in prayer so surgery is a
[25:24] very last option
[25:26] prayer is the first option
[25:28] best option and the most important
[25:30] option so we continue to hold sister
[25:33] priscilla and the family in prayer uh
[25:36] god would move upon and touch and heal
[25:38] her and raise her up out of that bed
[25:40] amen so we got some
[25:43] very serious illness
[25:45] amen that's going on in our family here
[25:47] but by god's grace and through his
[25:49] healing virtues they are well in jesus
[25:52] name amen amen praise the lord you have
[25:55] an unspoken request on your heart yes
[25:57] amen the lord knows all our hearts today
[25:59] amen the lord will bless you let's stand
[26:01] to our feet if we could

[34:40] we came from all over
[34:42] amen we're pretty much a representative
[34:44] of tucson the far east side southeast
[34:48] side
[34:48] west side
[34:50] northwest side southwest side amen
[34:54] i'm looking at the entirety of tucson
[34:56] here amen praise the lord amen because
[34:59] god's blessed us the center of tucson
[35:02] sister matisse lives right down here
[35:04] close to downtown now pretty close
[35:06] anybody amen we got it covered praise
[35:08] the lord you came from all over to come
[35:11] and be here today because you know why
[35:13] you didn't expect to come for me you
[35:16] didn't come for one another you came
[35:17] because you knew he would be here yes
[35:20] amen to meet with him praise the lord
[35:23] that's the number one thing praise the
[35:25] lord jesus
[35:26] amen micah gave me a little exhortation
[35:28] yesterday when he started to write this
[35:30] song down and i don't know if he wanted
[35:32] to give it or you want me to read it oh
[35:34] you can read it
[35:41] i'll read it then
[35:43] sometimes it's good for the person whom
[35:45] the thought came from to exhort
[35:47] uh themselves but as he was writing this
[35:50] song uh putting it in the computer to
[35:53] have projected up here we get to this
[35:55] last
[35:56] verse um
[35:59] best partakers of history as gems and
[36:01] his crown just shine you know micah's
[36:03] kind of a gemologist a little bit it's
[36:06] not officially but kind of likes gems
[36:08] and those things and when he was typing
[36:10] that i'll just write what he texts me
[36:13] um
[36:14] jim's in his crown of shine he said this
[36:16] came to me in gemology
[36:18] the brilliance of a gem now think of
[36:20] that the gem is you
[36:22] amen that jim is us that gemini's crown
[36:24] is us
[36:25] that gem is classified by what's called
[36:28] a reflective index
[36:31] the reflective index is a measurement of
[36:34] how the velocity of light which is him
[36:38] changes when light passes through
[36:41] a mineral or the gym
[36:44] you get it as that light passes through
[36:46] us the gem the mineral a high reflective
[36:49] index is linked to the dispersion of the
[36:52] light into the mineral which gives
[36:54] minerals such as diamonds their fire
[36:57] that's why they shine so brilliantly and
[36:59] that's why so many people like them so
[37:01] much
[37:02] to be a gem in his crown we need to be
[37:04] clean and pure
[37:06] so when his light hits us we reflect the
[37:09] brilliance that he is
[37:11] if we let our lives get muddled
[37:14] uh uh when his light hits us it's not
[37:17] going to shine reflect as brilliantly
[37:21] uh as it would to others yes amen
[37:25] you know i thought that was worth
[37:26] mentioning
[37:28] amen i did i wish he had done it i
[37:30] thought that was worth mentioning amen i
[37:33] agree with that that's so very true
[37:35] praise the lord isn't it
[37:39] joel
[37:40] i heard joel has a testimony do you want
[37:42] to come up here and tell it are you okay
[37:44] right there
[37:46] i think you could come up
[37:49] no
[37:50] you've come up in the same force before
[37:52] you sure
[37:55] uh on friday okay hold on
[37:57] hold on just a minute if you're not
[37:58] going to come up hold on a minute
[38:01] i want to make sure everybody hears you
[38:09] okay so friday night uh after the party
[38:13] i when uh my dad was cleaning up the
[38:15] wheels of my walker i just felt to walk
[38:18] and then i just started walking and now
[38:20] i can walk without a walk
[38:25] and i know that god would just kill us
[38:29] every ass
[38:30] amen praise the lord
[38:34] amen
[38:35] thank you lord amen do you all get that
[38:39] yes amen
[38:41] his dad went to clean off because he was
[38:42] at the
[38:44] birthday party for mariah friday night
[38:46] uh there peter piper and he's come and
[38:48] he's he's putting pressure on his foot
[38:50] but he's still got his walker and they
[38:52] take it home and he goes to clean i
[38:53] guess often joe's like i feel like i can
[38:56] walk
[38:58] that right i believe i could
[39:00] he walked into church amen
[39:02] praise the lord thank god for that
[39:05] amen
[39:07] so appreciate the lord's goodness amen
[39:10] praise the lord i was so good to him you
[39:12] know that infection could have got so
[39:14] bad he could have lost his
[39:15] ankle his foot his leg
[39:17] amen but god was merciful so thankful to
[39:20] that
[39:21] you know
[39:22] so many times people look at things and
[39:24] they think oh that is so horrible how
[39:27] could god have allowed that
[39:29] and i was on the job tuesday i gave this
[39:32] testimony a little bit on the if you if
[39:34] you saw the recording i put out
[39:36] wednesday night
[39:37] by the way it's still open to the public
[39:41] on our website but micah's going to make
[39:43] that into the congregation only
[39:47] part of our website so if you haven't
[39:49] seen it you want to and not have to get
[39:51] into that part of the website
[39:54] you go ahead and watch it
[39:56] but it is still available to the public
[39:58] uh wednesday night but i gave a little
[40:00] bit of it but tuesday we were in
[40:02] hereford me and brother roger was in
[40:03] here for doing a mini split on a house
[40:05] and we had to run some pipe around the
[40:07] house and
[40:08] uh it was in concrete so we take a
[40:12] hammer drill that's corded a lot of
[40:14] times because it drills into the
[40:16] concrete a lot easier
[40:18] killing yourself to put a hole so you
[40:19] can drill some concrete bolts or screws
[40:23] into to hold the pipe on the wall
[40:25] and
[40:26] we had done one side of the house we
[40:28] were going around the front of the house
[40:30] and so it was a corded drill so i
[40:31] brought the drill around and it got hung
[40:33] on
[40:34] the drop cord got hung in a little twig
[40:36] if
[40:37] it had been something significant i'd
[40:38] have walked over and you know lifted it
[40:41] up and it was just a little trick so you
[40:43] know how many times in my life i've done
[40:45] this with a drop cord and you and you
[40:47] pull on it to whip it up to get it over
[40:49] that thing to bring it to you well when
[40:51] i pulled to whip it it came loose now
[40:55] this is a 250 dollar hammer drill
[40:58] and the plug on it is about that big and
[41:01] that big around
[41:02] very thick very hard plastic and when i
[41:06] went to whip it and pull it it came
[41:08] loose and it came and hit me right there
[41:11] you see the spots
[41:13] uh there
[41:14] on my nose and on my forehead
[41:17] where that plug came and hit me right
[41:19] there it happened so fast i didn't even
[41:21] see it
[41:22] when i pulled i just felt a bam on my
[41:25] head didn't even see it
[41:27] and i thought what was that took me a
[41:29] second to figure out what had happened
[41:31] and i came to myself and i started to go
[41:34] back to work and blood just started
[41:36] pouring out on the ground like oh
[41:37] something's wrong here
[41:39] but
[41:40] once i and and
[41:42] i went to the van and cleaned it off and
[41:44] put a bandage on it so i didn't bleed
[41:45] all over everybody's stuff
[41:48] and
[41:49] you know it's been fine i kind of felt
[41:51] woozy when i was in the van
[41:54] because it hit me it hit me really hard
[41:56] right here
[41:57] uh as you can see i don't know how it
[41:59] did this
[42:01] did not even touch my glasses
[42:03] didn't even move them i didn't even have
[42:06] to adjust my glasses it hit
[42:09] so perfectly
[42:10] now that sounds odd considering what it
[42:13] did to me
[42:14] but it hit so perfect god
[42:17] those angels surrounding
[42:19] it
[42:20] guided that thing to hit so perfectly on
[42:23] my face that it didn't even disturb my
[42:26] glasses
[42:27] must last break
[42:29] and i went home and told my wife she
[42:31] said see that's why you pray i said i
[42:33] said i did that's why it didn't go here
[42:36] or here
[42:37] and as i started thinking i thought one
[42:39] inch either way and that thing would
[42:41] have put my eye out it hit that hard it
[42:43] would have shoved the glass right into
[42:44] my eyeball i mean
[42:47] it could have been very very disastrous
[42:50] uh if it broke my glasses i'd have been
[42:53] without my i couldn't have seen to
[42:54] finish the job i had to drive home from
[42:57] benson
[42:58] um god was just so merciful
[43:00] amen and people looked at that well my
[43:03] if you just
[43:04] shouldn't happen well things do happen
[43:07] things they do happen but if we're
[43:10] prayed up and we're trusting the lord he
[43:13] makes everything work together for our
[43:15] good and it just it just happened again
[43:17] that it hit so perfectly
[43:20] that it
[43:21] i just
[43:22] i bled a lot but other than that
[43:25] it it i i put a bandage on it and we
[43:28] kept working and finished to finish the
[43:30] job
[43:31] uh
[43:31] drove home and took a shower you know
[43:36] praise the lord that i thought
[43:38] i thought so much what a miracle it was
[43:41] yes i'm so thankful that god he one one
[43:44] is either way and it could have been a
[43:47] whole different story saints and i'm so
[43:50] thankful that god is merciful to us
[43:53] praise the lord so that's my testimony
[43:55] today i thank the lord he watches over
[43:58] us yes amen i and oddly enough i already
[44:02] had what i spoke on wednesday i already
[44:05] had on my heart to bring so this didn't
[44:08] have anything to do with what i was
[44:10] saying with him always being there
[44:13] that didn't have anything to do with
[44:14] this if i had already had that so it
[44:17] just it was
[44:19] just god god orchestrates it also he
[44:22] knows exactly how to do it where to do
[44:24] it and
[44:25] amen thank the lord he's good amen
[44:28] praise the lord
[44:30] just i don't know how people can't serve
[44:32] the lord jesus he's so good to us
[44:41] amen micah had a song you wanted to sing
[44:43] for so
[44:44] amen lord bless him
[44:56] uh there's been a lot of talk about the
[44:58] rapture and stuff in the last couple of
[45:00] weeks to be in the new year

[45:03] the coming of the lord

[49:54] may have noticed
[49:56] um thankful we uh
[50:00] craig fixed the heat for us
[50:02] i mean i had the heaters around i didn't
[50:04] i didn't even i never even forgot to
[50:06] mention to him that the heat wasn't
[50:07] working but i came in yesterday
[50:10] after our brother's breakfast
[50:12] and
[50:13] came in and
[50:15] pray in
[50:16] what i do in here on most of the day on
[50:19] saturdays and he had a note sticking on
[50:22] the
[50:23] thermostat it said the heat's working
[50:25] and so praise the lord
[50:27] i just
[50:28] i don't know how i just
[50:30] fought to check but
[50:32] checked and so now it's working so
[50:34] thank the lord for that
[50:35] makes it a little easier on me anyway
[50:37] not that you're necessarily
[50:38] uncomfortable but i had to come in and
[50:41] plug in two or three heaters and
[50:42] position them around so
[50:44] it was nice just to come push a button
[50:46] and there it was
[50:47] amen so i appreciate him doing that yes
[50:50] i mean he's supposed to do that as a
[50:52] landlord but
[50:53] sometimes that doesn't always work out
[50:55] that way so i appreciate him doing that
[50:58] amen now if you turn your bibles with me

[53:18] jesus christ we pray amen hebrews
[53:21] 10
[53:23] verse 22
[53:25] it says let us draw near with a true
[53:27] heart and full assurance of faith having
[53:30] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[53:32] conscience in our bodies washed with
[53:34] pure water
[53:35] let us hold fast the profession of our
[53:37] faith without wavering for he is
[53:40] faithful that promised let us consider
[53:42] one another to provoke unto love and to
[53:45] good works
[53:46] not forsaking the assembling of
[53:48] ourselves together as the manner of some
[53:51] is but exhorting one another in so much
[53:54] more and so much the more as you see the
[53:57] day approaching for if we sin willfully
[54:00] after that we have received the
[54:02] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[54:04] no more sacrifice for sins but a certain
[54:07] fearful looking for the judgment of and
[54:10] fiery indignation which shall devour the
[54:13] adversaries
[54:14] you can be seated if you like
[54:18] i don't want to take a thought of that
[54:19] that just kind of struck me here a few
[54:21] weeks ago
[54:23] that i believe the lord put on my heart
[54:25] and took me to this scripture and that
[54:27] is the 25th verse 25th verse which we
[54:30] have quoted many times which we say to
[54:33] one another many times
[54:35] which we use for the purpose of
[54:37] of of our assembling together one one
[54:40] thing that we use scripture wise of our
[54:43] assembling together for it says that we
[54:46] are not to forsake the assembling of
[54:48] ourselves together as the manner of some
[54:51] is but
[54:53] even that much more as we see that day
[54:55] approaching so that that came to me very
[54:59] strong with the things that's going on
[55:01] in the world today with what's happening
[55:03] around the world today now i want you to
[55:05] notice it it seems that
[55:07] that is a great influence
[55:09] and
[55:10] and what's happening and recognizing
[55:13] what the scripture says about it uh is
[55:16] significant to me uh but when you look
[55:18] at that and you see what's going on
[55:20] today and as the lord began to unfold
[55:23] this to me yesterday uh
[55:26] me and sonia had something to do
[55:27] yesterday afternoon she kept texting me
[55:29] says well when are you going to be done
[55:31] i'm like
[55:32] i don't know
[55:33] when i come here on saturday saints i
[55:35] don't know when i'm going to be leaving
[55:37] right
[55:38] however long it takes the lord to unfold
[55:40] this and bring this to me for today is
[55:43] how i'm going to be here
[55:45] that that's all i know so that's what i
[55:47] do and that's what i told him but as the
[55:49] lord began to
[55:50] unfold it things became so prevalent my
[55:53] mind and heart i started thinking
[55:56] it's amazing uh
[55:58] what is happening and and sometimes the
[56:01] devices that that the enemy uses
[56:04] that's contrary to the scripture
[56:07] uh and we've got to be aware of those
[56:09] things we got to be cognizant we need to
[56:12] have our spiritual understanding our
[56:14] spiritual acuity on high alert with
[56:16] what's going on because the devil lulls
[56:19] us so many times into accepting a
[56:22] lower part of what the scripture is
[56:24] trying to
[56:26] help us to do to understand to do one of
[56:29] those things is the assembling of
[56:31] ourselves together
[56:33] amen assembling together now i want you
[56:35] to see something here and i don't mean
[56:37] this in a wrong way so i'll probably
[56:39] have to expound it a little bit
[56:41] but it doesn't say church
[56:45] it doesn't right
[56:47] i just read it and i quoted it you want
[56:49] to read it again it says
[56:51] not forsaking the assembling of
[56:54] ourselves together as the manner of some
[56:56] is but exhorting one another and so much
[56:58] more as you see the day approaching did
[57:00] you hear the word church
[57:02] it does not say church
[57:05] but now that being said
[57:08] church that we have here a building of
[57:11] his house a place to come a designated
[57:14] place designated time designated purpose
[57:17] is always probably first and foremost
[57:20] paramount to our gathering together so
[57:24] i'm not negating the church part but
[57:27] it's also important that we gather
[57:29] together with those of like precious
[57:31] faith even if it's not church
[57:33] you think about the
[57:35] the word assembling the word assembling
[57:37] simply means gathering in one place
[57:40] amen like the sisters do when they go
[57:42] and have a lunch together it's good i i
[57:45] can't tell you how good that does my
[57:47] heart when i know the sisters are
[57:48] getting together to have a lunch and
[57:50] have fellowship and come together as one
[57:52] unit as one entity as one group as a
[57:55] representation of this congregation
[57:57] right uh and having a meal together it's
[58:00] it's it's following the scripture it's
[58:03] assembling together it's gathering in
[58:05] one place yes we had the breakfast
[58:08] uh the brother's breakfast sunday
[58:09] morning uh i hate that several of you
[58:12] weren't able to make it but uh me and
[58:14] brother dennis and brother danny had a
[58:15] good time yes yesterday morning but that
[58:18] that is a gathering together it is
[58:21] coming together it is a fulfilling this
[58:24] scripture really because we the three of
[58:26] us at least assembled together
[58:29] like precious faith
[58:31] amen it matters when we have our dinners
[58:33] together i really enjoy our dinners and
[58:35] and this is probably the most important
[58:38] reason not the food
[58:42] not the uh not having to go to a
[58:44] restaurant or whatever just just the
[58:46] gathering together part just being
[58:48] together all of us together as much as
[58:50] can come anyway together and be together
[58:53] and enjoy one another's company enjoy
[58:55] one another's fellowship and fellowship
[58:57] together and get to know one another and
[58:59] get closer together become a closer knit
[59:02] uh group and and that's a big part of it
[59:05] because that's that's the way this body
[59:07] is supposed to be that's the way this
[59:09] bride is supposed to be
[59:11] uh
[59:12] and things on top of that harmony's
[59:14] coming up this week you know i i don't
[59:17] know how much we'll be able to make it
[59:18] but i want to try to go to at least one
[59:21] but that that is another
[59:23] uh a fulfillment of this scripture of
[59:26] assembling together of those of like
[59:28] precious faith people coming together
[59:30] amen but the assembling together that
[59:34] that we have that we talk about here uh
[59:37] that that is a part of our church now
[59:40] there's obviously other assemblings that
[59:42] you can do
[59:43] uh
[59:45] we we have a gathering together of a
[59:48] bride internationally very much right
[59:51] we're not only the same building we're
[59:52] not the same state we're not the same
[59:54] country we're spread all over the world
[59:57] but we're assembled together
[59:59] we're assembled together under the same
[1:00:01] auspice of the shed blood of jesus
[1:00:03] christ we share commonality we share a
[1:00:06] same language we share a same desire and
[1:00:09] the same uh holy spirit and all those
[1:00:12] things in that comment that's that is
[1:00:14] that is a one place that one place is
[1:00:17] jesus christ
[1:00:19] so i understand that there are the
[1:00:20] gatherings together uh we have the
[1:00:23] streaming uh that people
[1:00:25] can gather together like that but
[1:00:28] there's
[1:00:29] and i understand that but there's
[1:00:31] nothing
[1:00:32] that can take the place
[1:00:34] of me looking in your eye and you're
[1:00:37] looking in my eye and us standing arm
[1:00:40] and arm face to face hand in hand
[1:00:43] fighting this good fight of faith
[1:00:44] there's not a substitute to it
[1:00:47] this country especially i imagine
[1:00:50] probably the world but this country has
[1:00:53] become since i was even born has become
[1:00:56] more and more urbanized as as time
[1:00:59] continues on
[1:01:01] people are coming closer together and
[1:01:03] getting closer uh in proximity with one
[1:01:06] another when i was growing up i couldn't
[1:01:08] imagine how houses that you see
[1:01:11] sometimes when you go around you could
[1:01:13] actually stick your arm out one window
[1:01:16] and the other person stick your arm out
[1:01:18] their other window and shake hands
[1:01:20] they're so the houses are so close
[1:01:22] together they could literally stand in
[1:01:24] their house and shake hands with one
[1:01:26] another
[1:01:27] and stick your hands out the window
[1:01:29] that's how close it is but people
[1:01:33] have never been more apart
[1:01:35] than in this day right
[1:01:37] they're coming closer together they're
[1:01:39] urbanizing more but they're but they're
[1:01:42] drawing further apart than they ever
[1:01:44] were
[1:01:45] used to be a time where um
[1:01:48] you'd go down the street or have
[1:01:50] neighbors you knew your neighbors
[1:01:52] you knew and it wasn't a snooping it
[1:01:54] wasn't anything like that it's just that
[1:01:56] you loved each other you appreciated
[1:01:59] them as a neighbor you're in a good
[1:02:00] neighborhood with good people and you
[1:02:02] loved one another you needed an egg
[1:02:05] a cake you went next door get an egg if
[1:02:08] they didn't have one you go to the next
[1:02:09] one cup of sugar whatever it was gallon
[1:02:12] of milk they would give it to you too
[1:02:14] right you see that today very rare i'm
[1:02:18] sure it probably does still happen to
[1:02:19] some degree but it's very rare
[1:02:21] of course it used to be back then where
[1:02:24] uh you didn't have a store every half a
[1:02:26] mile that if you could just hop the car
[1:02:29] go to the store a half a mile and you've
[1:02:30] got an egg
[1:02:32] you used to be you get in your car if
[1:02:34] you lived in a certain area a certain
[1:02:35] place like we used to you could you'd
[1:02:37] have to drive miles just to try to get
[1:02:39] some sugar or egg or something right so
[1:02:42] it was a little different
[1:02:43] but people used to know one another
[1:02:46] they used to fellowship they used to be
[1:02:48] a camaraderie there used to be a
[1:02:50] neighborhood they were neighbors
[1:02:53] and and in some degree it's kind of like
[1:02:55] that i know brother pat knows his
[1:02:57] neighbors i know brother pat's neighbor
[1:03:00] but
[1:03:00] by and far we've come closer together
[1:03:03] and drawn farther apart
[1:03:05] and that's exactly so that's
[1:03:09] identifying the world spirit
[1:03:11] and understanding that we ourselves are
[1:03:14] supposed to avoid that spirit as best as
[1:03:17] possible why because it's contrary to
[1:03:19] the scripture
[1:03:21] if it's contrary to the scripture you
[1:03:22] know it's not god
[1:03:24] so what is god just the opposite which
[1:03:28] is what the word says so if there's a
[1:03:30] spirit that's becoming prevalent in the
[1:03:32] world and we see this contrary to the
[1:03:35] scripture then we need to get away from
[1:03:37] that spirit and guard ourselves from it
[1:03:40] and one of those things is to be able to
[1:03:43] understand
[1:03:44] how important it is of the assembling of
[1:03:47] ourselves together
[1:03:49] of each one of us coming in one place
[1:03:53] at the same time arm and arm hand in
[1:03:56] hand together as brother and sister
[1:03:58] fighting this good fight
[1:04:00] it's important if you don't think it's
[1:04:02] important saints why is satan fight it
[1:04:05] so hard right
[1:04:06] yes
[1:04:08] he fights it so hard and he's making it
[1:04:10] more more convenient
[1:04:12] amen and and i i don't mind saying
[1:04:16] i have contemplated stopping the
[1:04:18] streaming yes
[1:04:20] but i'm not
[1:04:22] but
[1:04:23] it it becomes a convenience and it
[1:04:26] shouldn't become a convenience it
[1:04:28] shouldn't become an excuse it shouldn't
[1:04:30] be come to the place well we can instead
[1:04:33] of driving 15 miles to church we can sit
[1:04:36] here and just watch it
[1:04:38] no if it gets to that place
[1:04:40] it's gone yes right
[1:04:42] as far as me and the pastor of this
[1:04:44] church if he gets to that place in our
[1:04:46] lives and i'm not saying it has don't
[1:04:48] believe it has
[1:04:49] but i'm saying if it does it's gone
[1:04:52] right now streaming's over that's how i
[1:04:54] feel about it
[1:04:55] because i
[1:04:57] truly believe that that gathering
[1:04:59] together like we're doing right now is
[1:05:00] very important but it's very important
[1:05:03] at this point that there are people like
[1:05:05] the frajos like sister sheila and those
[1:05:07] and and others who tune in maybe that
[1:05:09] don't live here that want to see it and
[1:05:11] want to be a part of it and
[1:05:13] and and it'll stay there as a result
[1:05:16] but it can't be a substitute right
[1:05:19] kova can't scare people's and see
[1:05:21] copenhagen's been one of those things
[1:05:23] too
[1:05:24] what has coveted done covet has drawn
[1:05:26] people apart even more than they were
[1:05:28] before
[1:05:29] separated people apart even more than
[1:05:31] they were before
[1:05:33] dividing people even more than they were
[1:05:35] before yes arguing fussy complaining
[1:05:39] worried scared fear
[1:05:42] more than they were before
[1:05:44] people
[1:05:45] was it one of our stories yesterday
[1:05:47] maybe brother dennis brother danny i
[1:05:49] can't remember but somebody told me
[1:05:50] recently they went somewhere
[1:05:52] and and
[1:05:54] and this lady she had on well anyway
[1:05:56] she's living in a bubble
[1:05:58] and good for her that's fine i'm not i'm
[1:06:00] not
[1:06:01] i'm not criticizing her because if
[1:06:03] that's your faith level that's fine
[1:06:06] if that's your faith level then that's
[1:06:07] what you do that's that's that's okay
[1:06:09] i'm not complaining i'm not criticizing
[1:06:11] her for it but but
[1:06:15] you come
[1:06:17] in her presence
[1:06:18] and if i get the story right and i'm not
[1:06:20] can't remember if it was told yesterday
[1:06:22] and she's like no stop stop don't come
[1:06:24] near me
[1:06:26] i mean that that's the whole spirit of
[1:06:28] it
[1:06:29] and and
[1:06:30] that's a part of the result of what's
[1:06:32] happening with that demonic devil that
[1:06:34] spirit
[1:06:36] that's infiltrating in the people of our
[1:06:38] country that's dividing and ripping it
[1:06:40] apart even more
[1:06:42] just like
[1:06:43] it's trying to infiltrate or tries its
[1:06:46] best to infiltrate in the churches
[1:06:48] in the local assemblies
[1:06:50] and don't let it see because it's not
[1:06:52] supposed to be that way we're supposed
[1:06:54] to
[1:06:55] gather together with those of like
[1:06:57] precious faith
[1:06:59] satan loves to keep us divided right you
[1:07:02] know that satan will do anything he can
[1:07:04] to keep us apart right
[1:07:06] a roaring fire is a beautiful thing but
[1:07:09] if you take a coal out of that fire and
[1:07:11] set it over here that fire just blaze on
[1:07:13] but that coal will go dead in no time
[1:07:15] right
[1:07:16] because it's separated out yes
[1:07:19] and i'm sorry but streaming's not a
[1:07:22] substitute for that
[1:07:24] you've got to be in that fire yes
[1:07:26] you've got to be in that fire
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:31] i'll leave it right there let's go to
[1:07:32] another matthew chapter 18.
[1:07:37] another scripture matthew 18 19.
[1:07:45] their strength
[1:07:47] friends their strength that comes
[1:07:50] from being together
[1:07:52] we draw strength from one another
[1:07:55] that's why there's just the scriptural
[1:07:57] reference of laying hands on one another
[1:08:01] actually physically putting your hand on
[1:08:03] somebody it makes a difference yes amen
[1:08:07] um
[1:08:08] have you had any problems since the last
[1:08:10] time we lay hands on you sister try you
[1:08:12] look like that no
[1:08:14] when you
[1:08:15] passed out in the parking lot oh no
[1:08:18] no
[1:08:20] there's power that comes from laying
[1:08:21] hands on each other there's power
[1:08:23] not that not that god doesn't hear our
[1:08:25] prayers right i mean i would have loved
[1:08:27] and i asked sister teresa and she said
[1:08:29] no nobody's allowed to go see charlie
[1:08:31] because i was going to go i said i just
[1:08:32] want to go put my hand on him right
[1:08:35] but
[1:08:36] but even at that god god is touched by
[1:08:39] the feeling of our infirmities so
[1:08:42] he hears our prayers
[1:08:44] when we're not able to but there's
[1:08:46] strength to that yes there there's such
[1:08:49] a strength and well you ever heard the
[1:08:51] phrase strengthen numbers yeah right
[1:08:53] strength in numbers we bind together
[1:08:56] this shows us this this shows a a force
[1:08:59] a strength satan sees that
[1:09:02] satan sees you why do you think
[1:09:04] especially parents with children
[1:09:07] why because i say that because it
[1:09:09] happened to us
[1:09:11] why do you think that sunday mornings
[1:09:13] are always the worst mornings great yes
[1:09:17] everything can snap together during the
[1:09:19] week and the mornings can go fine and
[1:09:21] you can get them to school or whatever
[1:09:22] you got to do and everything plays along
[1:09:24] but when it comes sunday morning
[1:09:26] everything falls apart
[1:09:29] can't find the right clothes can't do
[1:09:31] this
[1:09:32] something that gets on the kid and that
[1:09:34] they don't want to get dressed or
[1:09:36] whatever it is something is nothing goes
[1:09:38] right on sunday morning
[1:09:40] not because that happened to us i know
[1:09:43] and we had to drive
[1:09:45] an hour to church so we know
[1:09:50] it's not easy it is a battle but the the
[1:09:53] worst of the battles on sunday morning
[1:09:55] why
[1:09:56] why do you think it's like that
[1:09:59] because satan does everything first of
[1:10:01] all to tear your spirit up
[1:10:03] right now
[1:10:04] he wants to keep you from coming
[1:10:07] but if you do press on and you do come
[1:10:11] he wants your spirit so tore up that you
[1:10:13] don't get anything when you're here
[1:10:16] to disrupt the flow of the holy spirit
[1:10:18] that's in here by your spirit that got
[1:10:21] so tore off that you're unable to
[1:10:23] receive what god wants to give to you
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:26] first of all he wants to keep you from
[1:10:28] coming period because he doesn't want
[1:10:30] you here because he knows their strength
[1:10:33] when we come together he knows that he
[1:10:35] knows we draw strength from coming here
[1:10:38] and being here together he knows that
[1:10:40] that's why he fights it so hard
[1:10:43] praise the lord so if it's like that we
[1:10:46] need to press further that much more to
[1:10:49] make sure we
[1:10:50] come against that spirit and obey the
[1:10:53] word and assemble ourselves together
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:58] there's strength to that saints
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:02] that's why he fights so hard
[1:11:04] that's why you see things happening the
[1:11:05] way you see it in the world it's a
[1:11:07] spirit it's a prevailing spirit matthew
[1:11:09] chapter 18 had you turned there verse
[1:11:11] 19.
[1:11:16] matthew 18.
[1:11:20] let's see order don't want to start here
[1:11:22] matthew 18 19.
[1:11:28] again i say unto you
[1:11:30] that if two of you agree together uh
[1:11:34] shall agree on earth as touching
[1:11:36] anything
[1:11:38] that they shall ask it shall be done for
[1:11:41] them of my father which is in heaven
[1:11:45] how many
[1:11:47] two
[1:11:48] now god that doesn't mean that god
[1:11:50] doesn't hear each individual's prayer
[1:11:53] that's not what he's saying
[1:11:54] but he's talking about how this how
[1:11:57] there is strength in numbers yeah right
[1:12:00] if one can face uh can chase a thousand
[1:12:04] two can chase ten thousand
[1:12:09] tell me there's not strength in numbers
[1:12:11] that is math that does not add up
[1:12:15] am i correct right
[1:12:17] if one can chase a thousand then two
[1:12:20] should chase
[1:12:21] 2 000
[1:12:22] so how does 2 chase
[1:12:25] 10 000
[1:12:26] right it's sort of like compound
[1:12:28] interest i guess
[1:12:29] amen it just rolls itself over
[1:12:32] 1 000 to 10 000 what would three do
[1:12:36] if they were together
[1:12:39] just three
[1:12:40] well he said the scripture says here
[1:12:42] that if any two
[1:12:44] come together
[1:12:46] touching anything agreeing on
[1:12:48] anything praise the lord well how many
[1:12:51] of us here this morning are agreeing
[1:12:53] together for brother charlie and sister
[1:12:56] priscilla and sister sheila and the
[1:12:58] sickness and the thing the prayer
[1:13:00] requests for micah and the different
[1:13:02] things that's been on your hearts and
[1:13:03] your unspoken if we all hear believing
[1:13:06] that and holding that before the lord
[1:13:09] how many devils can we chase out right
[1:13:12] praise the lord one thousand two ten
[1:13:14] thousand according to god
[1:13:17] that this those devils don't have a
[1:13:18] chance against us right none
[1:13:22] amen because that's the word two if you
[1:13:25] agree on earth is touching anything that
[1:13:27] ye that they ask it shall be done
[1:13:30] for them by my father which is in heaven
[1:13:34] praise the lord yes so that settles it
[1:13:37] for where two or three two or three are
[1:13:40] gathered together in my name
[1:13:42] there i in
[1:13:44] there am i in the midst of them yes now
[1:13:47] the biggest problem most people and
[1:13:49] you've probably heard me pray this
[1:13:51] several times but the biggest problem a
[1:13:53] lot of people have with this scripture
[1:13:55] is they don't gather in the name of
[1:13:57] jesus christ
[1:13:58] they come together in the name of a
[1:14:00] church or denomination or a pastor or
[1:14:04] some kind of nicolaitanism or some kind
[1:14:06] of worldlyism or whatever it is or
[1:14:09] or legalism they gather together under
[1:14:12] some other different kind of auspice
[1:14:14] than than the name of jesus christ and
[1:14:17] if it's in any other capacity in any
[1:14:20] other name it will not work
[1:14:24] it only works where two or three are
[1:14:26] gathered in his name
[1:14:28] that's when it works that's why we're
[1:14:30] here and we're here in his name in his
[1:14:33] name only not wigan brown no sir no sir
[1:14:37] we're here in the name of the lord jesus
[1:14:39] christ
[1:14:41] praise god
[1:14:42] that's when things begin to move yes
[1:14:45] because he's here
[1:14:46] because he promised he would be here
[1:14:48] yeah a lot of people think that big
[1:14:50] churches and huge congregations is a
[1:14:52] sign of god's blessings well if that's
[1:14:55] true the catholic church is the most
[1:14:57] blessed group on earth
[1:15:00] because they got the biggest prettiest
[1:15:01] buildings they got the largest groups
[1:15:04] they got the most members that there are
[1:15:06] of any group in the uni in the world
[1:15:09] under those criteria they're the blessed
[1:15:11] now the bible says where two or three
[1:15:13] are gathered right
[1:15:15] jesus said fear not little flock
[1:15:18] it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:15:20] give you the kingdom
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:23] praise the lord when they were in the
[1:15:24] upper room 120 of them he chose 12
[1:15:27] disciples always little numbers
[1:15:30] not this is not that there's anything
[1:15:32] wrong with a larger church i don't mean
[1:15:33] that at all
[1:15:34] but you can't measure the success or the
[1:15:37] blessings of god based on a building or
[1:15:40] the number of people
[1:15:42] amen brother branham talked about one
[1:15:44] man standing on the street corner eating
[1:15:46] soda cracker drinking branch water
[1:15:48] winning souls to god amen which is more
[1:15:52] important right
[1:15:53] a witch is more blessed yes amen
[1:15:57] john the baptist has come climbing out
[1:15:58] of the wilderness with locust and honey
[1:16:00] calming off his beard
[1:16:02] it looked like a wild man
[1:16:04] but he had something from god right
[1:16:06] who was more blessed the pharisees and
[1:16:08] sadducees who went up into their hollow
[1:16:10] halls of their kingdoms and their
[1:16:12] palaces and stuff and come out and and
[1:16:14] declare proclamation on john the baptist
[1:16:17] that you are wrong man and you are going
[1:16:19] to hell you were of the devil it did the
[1:16:21] same thing with jesus call him the
[1:16:22] eldest book
[1:16:23] right
[1:16:25] you're a man calling yourself god no he
[1:16:27] was god condescending into man
[1:16:30] but they failed to see it which one was
[1:16:32] more blessed
[1:16:34] they crucified him and hung them up on a
[1:16:36] cross
[1:16:38] cursed it it's him that hangs on on a
[1:16:40] tree right but which one was more
[1:16:42] blessed
[1:16:44] amen the one that was hanging there
[1:16:47] or the ones that did it
[1:16:49] amen you got we've got to watch what
[1:16:51] that that measurement where do we meet
[1:16:54] that measurement thing amen now that
[1:16:56] coming together see where two or three
[1:16:58] are gathered in my name that's the key
[1:17:01] in his name so we come together in his
[1:17:04] name that's the reason we're here we
[1:17:06] come together in his name let's go over
[1:17:08] to ecclesiastes chapter 4.
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:18] dear three are gathered in my name
[1:17:20] what uh
[1:17:22] what a beautiful thing it is that god
[1:17:24] gave us saints
[1:17:27] and made it to where we can do it and
[1:17:30] thank the lord we still live in a
[1:17:31] country where we're not threatened of
[1:17:34] persecution and imprisonment or death
[1:17:36] even for doing it yes yes praise god god
[1:17:39] give us nice vehicles god's provided for
[1:17:42] us for gas or whatever it is or
[1:17:44] transportation somehow god allows us to
[1:17:46] be able to get here
[1:17:48] yes amen
[1:17:50] thank god for it
[1:17:51] so
[1:17:52] under those criteria basically we are
[1:17:54] without excuse yes
[1:17:57] great amen god help us
[1:18:00] but
[1:18:00] it gives us strength and you know i
[1:18:03] believe you know what i'm talking about
[1:18:05] i'm not trying to tell you anything new
[1:18:07] i'm just trying to encourage us in the
[1:18:08] fact that we can
[1:18:09] guard ourselves against those spirits
[1:18:11] and try to get us laxadaisical and try
[1:18:13] to keep us away from the house of god
[1:18:15] right that's right and then try to keep
[1:18:17] us away from assembling together try to
[1:18:19] keep us away from being together with
[1:18:21] our brothers and sisters
[1:18:23] amen those of like precious faith
[1:18:26] fellowshipping loving one another
[1:18:28] spending time together you might not
[1:18:30] agree with everything they say
[1:18:31] amen in their fellowship but that's not
[1:18:34] the point the point is that in the
[1:18:36] spirit of god we're drawing that
[1:18:37] strength together from one another for
[1:18:40] the purpose of serving the lord amen
[1:18:42] ecclesiastes chapter four verse nine
[1:18:46] two
[1:18:48] are better than one
[1:18:50] now that's the bible
[1:18:51] you hear that in the world a lot of
[1:18:53] times but it's actually scriptural two
[1:18:56] are better than one
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] praise the lord i have that philosophy
[1:19:00] when i talk about candy bars or steaks
[1:19:03] two is better than one
[1:19:05] absolutely but
[1:19:06] scripturally it accounts to us to
[1:19:09] understand that two together
[1:19:11] is better than just one the one coal
[1:19:14] goes out very fast
[1:19:16] listen to
[1:19:17] listen to uh
[1:19:19] his his uh reasoning
[1:19:24] two are better than one because they
[1:19:26] have a good reward for their labor for
[1:19:28] if they fall the one will lift up his
[1:19:31] fellow
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:34] amen but woe to him that is alone when
[1:19:37] he fallen
[1:19:39] and friend we do
[1:19:41] fall
[1:19:42] yes every one of us
[1:19:43] we have
[1:19:45] very possibly will again right fall not
[1:19:48] backslide but just just
[1:19:50] fall in a place that we really need that
[1:19:52] encouragement and then like the eagle
[1:19:55] and the the eagle gets in this moping
[1:19:57] stage when it gets in its moping stage
[1:20:00] those other eagles come around and they
[1:20:02] they fly over that eagle and in smoking
[1:20:04] stage and they drop him down some food
[1:20:06] say here eat that it'll do you good
[1:20:08] it'll strengthen you if that eagle set
[1:20:10] there in that moping stage he alone he
[1:20:13] just dies right
[1:20:15] he'll just die but he's got some other
[1:20:16] eagle buddies that come and they get
[1:20:18] some flesh for them and they fly around
[1:20:20] and they drop it to them and they
[1:20:21] encourage them and they eat that and
[1:20:23] you'll give you strength and
[1:20:24] encouragement and get you into the
[1:20:26] heavens again see that's what we need
[1:20:28] that's what one of us what we do for one
[1:20:30] another and i don't know how many times
[1:20:33] that in the years of this congregation i
[1:20:35] know of particularly
[1:20:37] other places i have too but uh here i'll
[1:20:40] just say because it's us as this
[1:20:41] congregation has happened over and over
[1:20:43] again
[1:20:45] with the encouragement sometimes it's
[1:20:47] through calls or texts or something but
[1:20:49] there's nothing like being together
[1:20:51] right nothing like being here
[1:20:54] it seems like people getting
[1:20:57] listen to this circus
[1:20:59] it seems like people get into despair
[1:21:02] and then they and and so they don't come
[1:21:05] to church because they're in despair
[1:21:09] when the fact of the matter is by not
[1:21:11] coming to church
[1:21:13] makes your despair
[1:21:15] worse
[1:21:16] it's cyclical
[1:21:18] the despair
[1:21:20] will make a person not want to come to
[1:21:22] church but not coming to church will
[1:21:25] keep you in despair that's right
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:29] that's that's how it works
[1:21:32] if you're in despair
[1:21:34] being here with those of like precious
[1:21:36] faith and your brothers and sisters and
[1:21:38] encouraging is the best medicine you can
[1:21:41] have
[1:21:42] it's the best encouragement you can get
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:47] but if you sit at home and you stay at
[1:21:49] home that that that coal just sits there
[1:21:51] doing all it can to stay kindled
[1:21:53] it'll just get more despair more in
[1:21:55] despair
[1:21:57] if you get despair you come
[1:22:00] come to church yes
[1:22:02] i hate to use it as an example but you
[1:22:05] know when our first son passed away
[1:22:07] um
[1:22:08] we were in quite a despair
[1:22:11] right
[1:22:12] quite a despair
[1:22:14] and
[1:22:15] i
[1:22:16] i i will exhort my wife in this she
[1:22:19] missed one service
[1:22:22] she went to a c-section had a a child
[1:22:25] that passed a day and a half later and
[1:22:27] she only missed one church service
[1:22:29] there was no streaming then
[1:22:33] this is 32 years ago there was no
[1:22:35] streaming then
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:38] one service and i just exhort her for
[1:22:41] that
[1:22:42] because and i know you have your stories
[1:22:46] but
[1:22:47] i can tell you
[1:22:48] that
[1:22:49] she sat there
[1:22:53] and she probably got absolutely nothing
[1:22:55] out of the service
[1:23:05] outside of the fact that she was there
[1:23:08] she cried the entire time
[1:23:11] that's all she could do
[1:23:14] probably did a little myself
[1:23:16] but she cried the whole time
[1:23:20] but just being there
[1:23:23] and being in that presence
[1:23:25] and being with those people and feeling
[1:23:27] that
[1:23:28] spirit and that encouragement
[1:23:31] step at a time
[1:23:33] it got better better
[1:23:35] better
[1:23:36] i will say it got easier
[1:23:38] but it got better
[1:23:40] each time
[1:23:42] to help lift out of that despair see
[1:23:46] one good strong eagle you drop a morsel
[1:23:49] of meat down to the
[1:23:50] the moping the eagle that's in moping
[1:23:52] stage
[1:23:54] that one that's all nice
[1:23:56] but he needs more than that
[1:23:59] when they're that down in that despair
[1:24:03] it takes more than the one
[1:24:05] and
[1:24:07] that's what
[1:24:08] the scripture is trying to exhort us to
[1:24:10] understand
[1:24:13] that helps us more than anything
[1:24:16] you understand i have people who say
[1:24:18] well i'm depressed
[1:24:20] this the best place to be
[1:24:23] if you feel discouraged this is the best
[1:24:25] place to be right amen
[1:24:28] praise the lord
[1:24:30] two are better than one because they
[1:24:31] have a good reward if one fault
[1:24:34] lift up his fellow woe to him that is
[1:24:36] alone when he falls for he hath not
[1:24:38] another to help him up
[1:24:42] again if two lie together then they have
[1:24:45] heat
[1:24:46] but how can one be warmer alone
[1:24:51] and if what prevail against him
[1:24:54] two shall withstand him
[1:24:56] amen strengthen numbers
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:00] strengthen numbers
[1:25:02] and a threefold chord is not quickly
[1:25:05] broken or two or three
[1:25:09] if one can chase a thousand to ten
[1:25:11] thousand what can three do
[1:25:14] and a three-fold chord is just it's just
[1:25:16] a chord that's that's intertwined with
[1:25:19] each other
[1:25:20] it's not like three growths that are
[1:25:21] just together like
[1:25:23] but they're intertwined threefold is
[1:25:26] they're intertwined together they're all
[1:25:28] wrapped together
[1:25:29] like electrical wire
[1:25:31] they're all wrapped together they make
[1:25:33] one chord because they're all together
[1:25:36] that's what threefold is
[1:25:39] they're all that's the way they were in
[1:25:40] the upper room
[1:25:42] it went one night and one accord
[1:25:44] 120 up one minute and one accord
[1:25:46] i tell you that was quite an
[1:25:48] accomplishment friend
[1:25:49] for 120 to be on one mind at one accord
[1:25:51] i don't i
[1:25:54] that would be a challenge today yes to
[1:25:56] get 120 to be in one minute and one
[1:25:58] accord but that three-fold court is not
[1:26:01] quickly broken two's chasing ten
[1:26:03] thousand having these three chasing i
[1:26:05] mean it's not common mass you can't even
[1:26:07] really figure it out but
[1:26:10] but when that three-fold chord is
[1:26:11] together
[1:26:13] and make up one chord together
[1:26:15] friend that's that that is a formidable
[1:26:18] foe that satan cannot defeat
[1:26:21] he'll he won't leave you alone he'll
[1:26:23] keep coming against you but he can't
[1:26:25] defeat it
[1:26:27] and
[1:26:28] i
[1:26:30] more than almost anything
[1:26:34] like to see that in this church
[1:26:37] right with us
[1:26:40] that
[1:26:41] not three but however many we have 30
[1:26:44] that if everybody comes
[1:26:47] that are all intertwined together make
[1:26:50] one chord
[1:26:52] amen not not not a word of god
[1:26:54] tabernacle quarter jesus chord amen not
[1:26:57] a mutant being a chord not a way your
[1:26:58] brain above right jesus accord for jesus
[1:27:02] that's that's what we're to be yeah amen
[1:27:04] not because it's this church
[1:27:06] because i believe we should be that way
[1:27:08] for all believers around the world
[1:27:11] that's how we're going that's how we
[1:27:13] should exist
[1:27:14] here
[1:27:15] that's how we're all going to go
[1:27:16] together we're all going to go together
[1:27:19] we're looking for a rapture all the
[1:27:21] believers around the world the alive and
[1:27:22] remain group well the dead that have
[1:27:24] gone on we're all going to go together
[1:27:27] right as one yes
[1:27:29] all together so
[1:27:33] that togetherness
[1:27:35] that love is so important it's the love
[1:27:37] that bonds
[1:27:39] amen it's a three-fold chord that's
[1:27:41] wrapped around love is what's holding it
[1:27:43] together
[1:27:44] the love of the word a threefold court
[1:27:47] see
[1:27:48] is not quickly broken
[1:27:50] and we know that if they come together
[1:27:52] that
[1:27:53] that three together oh my
[1:27:56] better is a poorer let's let's move on
[1:27:58] from that amen let's go over to acts
[1:28:01] chapter 2.
[1:28:05] another scripture here i want to close
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:19] praise the lord i believe that's why
[1:28:21] david wrote in the psalmist that
[1:28:23] he inhabits the praises of his people
[1:28:26] he inhabits the inhabitants the praises
[1:28:29] of israel
[1:28:30] which is his people which we are his
[1:28:33] people
[1:28:34] he inhabits the praises
[1:28:36] we come in here and we worship and we
[1:28:37] praise him that that that brings the
[1:28:41] manifestation of his spirit real to us
[1:28:44] and then we feel the moving of that
[1:28:46] spirit in us
[1:28:48] amen not not that that spirit takes
[1:28:50] flight but it moves in and and becomes a
[1:28:53] part of us
[1:28:54] that's when faith begins to reverberate
[1:28:57] in you and when that faith reverberates
[1:28:59] then there's nothing impossible to god's
[1:29:01] children
[1:29:02] nothing then we take hold of
[1:29:05] of something in agreement god is bound
[1:29:07] to do it yes
[1:29:09] but that takes us together all of us
[1:29:12] together praying together the effectual
[1:29:14] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:29:16] availeth much yes the verb effectual
[1:29:19] fervent prayer of righteous people avail
[1:29:23] of how much more than just much
[1:29:25] right
[1:29:27] praise before the throne of god
[1:29:31] acts uh acts chapter 2 verse 42.
[1:29:36] look what they did in the book of acts
[1:29:38] now just after they received the holy
[1:29:40] ghost
[1:29:42] they've all been born again now received
[1:29:44] the holy ghost
[1:29:46] and they continued steadfastly
[1:29:49] in the apostles doctrine and fellowship
[1:29:51] in the breaking of bread and in prayers
[1:29:55] and fear came upon every soul and many
[1:29:58] wonders and signs were done by the
[1:30:00] apostles
[1:30:01] and all that believed were together and
[1:30:04] had all things common
[1:30:06] praise the lord
[1:30:09] sold their possessions goods part of
[1:30:11] them to all men as every man had need
[1:30:14] they continued daily with one accord in
[1:30:16] the temple and breaking bread from house
[1:30:18] to house did eat their meat with
[1:30:20] gladness and singleness of heart
[1:30:23] praising god and giving favor with all
[1:30:25] the people and the lord added to the
[1:30:28] church daily such as should be saved
[1:30:31] how did they do it
[1:30:33] together
[1:30:34] as a church
[1:30:36] as a group
[1:30:37] as an assembly how do we do it exact
[1:30:40] same way
[1:30:41] as a church as a group as an assembly we
[1:30:46] come together
[1:30:47] and being together causes that
[1:30:50] causes that faith
[1:30:52] that strength that that we need that
[1:30:54] boost that we need to continue to press
[1:30:56] on
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:58] it it's it's what makes the difference
[1:31:02] that three-fold chord
[1:31:05] amen that that roaring fire
[1:31:09] together
[1:31:10] we make a difference
[1:31:12] psalms
[1:31:13] we'll go to psalms i read one more
[1:31:15] scripture i want to read a quote to you
[1:31:17] and then we'll close psalms chapter 107.
[1:31:30] praise the lord psalms 107
[1:31:34] verse 1
[1:31:37] oh give thanks unto the lord for he is
[1:31:40] good for his mercy endureth forever
[1:31:44] the redeemed of the lord say so
[1:31:47] i just said it amen
[1:31:50] whom he hath redeemed from the hand of
[1:31:51] the enemy and gather them out of the
[1:31:54] lands from the east from the west from
[1:31:56] the north from the south
[1:31:58] here we are sitting here this morning
[1:32:00] remember when brother brown went i
[1:32:02] believe it was to the seals
[1:32:04] was it the seals
[1:32:05] he said look we got them from all over
[1:32:07] or no
[1:32:08] no i believe it was future home
[1:32:11] it was a future home message
[1:32:13] stopped he said look here look at how we
[1:32:15] got people from
[1:32:16] from this direction and then from that
[1:32:18] direction and then from this direction
[1:32:20] and then from that direction see
[1:32:22] i get that was why i guess the lord
[1:32:24] inspired me to put that they come
[1:32:26] yeah the east and west north south lands
[1:32:29] afar i labeled it here just in the few
[1:32:31] people we've got here
[1:32:33] pretty much every single part of this
[1:32:34] city represented right here
[1:32:37] you come in to this central location
[1:32:40] praise the lord amen right
[1:32:42] north south
[1:32:44] east west north south they wandered in
[1:32:46] the wilderness in a solidarity way they
[1:32:49] found no city to dwell in
[1:32:51] hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in
[1:32:54] them
[1:32:55] then they cried unto the lord in their
[1:32:57] trouble notice how it's it's together
[1:33:01] in their trouble and he delivered them
[1:33:04] out of their distresses
[1:33:06] and he led them forth by the right way
[1:33:09] and that they might go to a city of
[1:33:11] habitation
[1:33:13] all that men would praise the lord for
[1:33:15] his goodness and for his wonderful words
[1:33:18] to the children of men
[1:33:21] praise the lord
[1:33:22] why do you think god
[1:33:24] had instructed moses the original
[1:33:28] tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:33:30] why would god want
[1:33:32] moses to build that
[1:33:34] place if he didn't desire for them to
[1:33:37] come together in one place notice the
[1:33:40] children of israel that they were
[1:33:43] they were in a a
[1:33:45] central locale
[1:33:47] they were all there camping together in
[1:33:50] the wilderness
[1:33:51] but god still had moses build a
[1:33:54] sanctuary
[1:33:55] he still helped him build a place
[1:33:58] where god could come down into the holy
[1:34:01] place into the holies of holies and that
[1:34:04] the people could come in and they could
[1:34:07] gather and they could worship
[1:34:09] god put other
[1:34:11] uh
[1:34:12] uh people in charge and and set
[1:34:15] ministers and a priesthood in there to
[1:34:17] minister to the people
[1:34:20] so that they would come together to draw
[1:34:22] the strength not just from the word
[1:34:26] not even just from
[1:34:27] god's presence in that holy place but
[1:34:30] from one another
[1:34:33] why did god do that if there was if it
[1:34:35] wasn't a purpose and a strength to it
[1:34:38] we have a representation of that here
[1:34:39] today the only difference is that his
[1:34:42] holy place is us
[1:34:45] this is his house
[1:34:47] this is the place that we
[1:34:50] prayed over and is dedicated and
[1:34:52] consecrated to him
[1:34:55] service to him
[1:34:57] there's not going to be any bingo games
[1:34:59] and all mess in here we're never going
[1:35:01] to have suppers that that take up this
[1:35:04] sanctuary this is god's house
[1:35:06] this is a place of holiness and
[1:35:08] reverence yes the holy spirit is very
[1:35:11] timid yes very timid yes the slightest
[1:35:14] out of out of the way and that spirit
[1:35:17] moves away from them from you right
[1:35:20] amen that's why we do everything with
[1:35:22] reverence and holiness that's why even
[1:35:25] michael put up here in respecting the
[1:35:27] sanctuary after we've after we've
[1:35:29] dismissed right we got a place of
[1:35:31] fellowship we live in tucson friend

[1:35:35] usually beautiful even to step outside
[1:35:38] in fellowship and spend time together i
[1:35:40] love that i i i
[1:35:44] it just it does my heart good to see
[1:35:46] people that are together and
[1:35:48] fellowshipping and talking and enjoying
[1:35:50] one another's company and drawing
[1:35:51] strength from one another

[1:35:59] he did for joel the testimonies the
[1:36:01] testimonies that we have yeah they make
[1:36:03] such a difference to us yes amen they we

[1:36:08] encouragement it helps us
[1:36:10] amen
[1:36:12] praise the lord so
[1:36:15] god's given us this place and it's for
[1:36:17] that purpose yes
[1:36:20] and we need to keep it that way right
[1:36:23] and continue to
[1:36:26] this gathering together
[1:36:28] amen it's gathering together
[1:36:31] some of us go to jobs every day
[1:36:33] some of us
[1:36:34] um
[1:36:36] go to doctors or go shopping or there's
[1:36:38] there's all kinds of people all over
[1:36:40] wherever you go there's people
[1:36:42] there's people all over the place
[1:36:44] but there's nothing like coming into the
[1:36:46] place like this
[1:36:48] or calling a brother's breakfast or a
[1:36:50] sister's lunch or a church dinner or
[1:36:52] something
[1:36:52] and then you just come and it's kind of
[1:36:55] it's kind of like you come into that
[1:36:57] little bubble
[1:36:58] right we had a little well not a little
[1:37:00] but we had a like a six-person booth at
[1:37:02] denny's right here yesterday
[1:37:04] well yesterday in the morning and it was
[1:37:07] like we were just
[1:37:08] sealed off
[1:37:10] we were just we were away from the world
[1:37:12] all people people everywhere right
[1:37:15] but when the presence of god dropped in
[1:37:17] in our conversation and all that was
[1:37:19] there yes
[1:37:21] nobody else knew anything about all that
[1:37:23] it was just us in the lord
[1:37:26] it's beautiful yeah amen i
[1:37:29] personally draw great strength
[1:37:32] amen great strength from that
[1:37:35] and i i as i know
[1:37:37] you do maybe the lunches are
[1:37:40] the dinners we have here but it's all a
[1:37:42] part of it yes assembling ourselves
[1:37:44] together
[1:37:45] this is the centerpiece
[1:37:48] the our church times our church services
[1:37:50] is the centerpiece of that but off of
[1:37:53] that we have our other times we spend
[1:37:55] time together
[1:37:56] amen i'm so glad i'm so thankful i hear
[1:37:59] so many times people
[1:38:01] uh they go visit family and
[1:38:04] and their family and they love them but
[1:38:05] they're like i'm so glad
[1:38:07] to get away from there
[1:38:09] because they're not believers
[1:38:11] and and i say that sarcastically i guess
[1:38:14] but uh you know i've heard people say
[1:38:18] those type things because it's hard to
[1:38:19] be around and i'm so thankful my family
[1:38:22] we all we serve the lord very much amen
[1:38:24] all serve the lord together not
[1:38:26] necessarily at this congregation which
[1:38:27] i'm very thankful for that too but that
[1:38:30] we just
[1:38:31] all serve the lord
[1:38:32] amen we spent a lot of time together
[1:38:35] which i'm very thankful for for that
[1:38:37] reason and i'll draw strength from that
[1:38:40] amen i draw strength from being with my
[1:38:42] grandchildren my daughter my son-in-law
[1:38:44] my son my wife
[1:38:46] i draw strength from all of you all the
[1:38:48] time
[1:38:51] and i i'm gonna say something to you
[1:38:55] it i i draw a tremendous amount of
[1:38:58] strength seeing you sitting there
[1:39:00] and i draw a lot of strength here
[1:39:02] standing here seeing you sitting there
[1:39:04] this morning i do it makes
[1:39:08] me and my position and the spirit the
[1:39:10] lord give me
[1:39:11] it it blesses me so much
[1:39:17] and i try not to and the lord helps me
[1:39:21] but it's very discouraging when there's
[1:39:23] only one or two of you out there
[1:39:25] it i don't mind telling you it
[1:39:27] discourages me it does
[1:39:30] and
[1:39:31] and i and i that's that's something i
[1:39:34] have to get over because where two or
[1:39:35] three are gathered
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:38] uh i i've told you this one time before
[1:39:40] i read this
[1:39:41] when i was in florida
[1:39:43] and
[1:39:44] you know we had congregations sort of
[1:39:46] like ours 20 30 people and
[1:39:48] uh uh we had a little room where i
[1:39:51] studied and but it was kind of right
[1:39:53] next you could kind of see people come
[1:39:55] in as they come into church and you can
[1:39:57] hear the door open and
[1:39:58] hard you know just a handful
[1:40:02] of people
[1:40:03] and i got so discouraged sitting there
[1:40:05] and it was hard for me to even read the
[1:40:06] bible sitting there and and
[1:40:09] go over my notes and things and final
[1:40:12] preparation for the sermon and um
[1:40:15] and then god spoke to me
[1:40:17] and he said don't concentrate on those
[1:40:19] i'm probably paraphrasing this has been
[1:40:21] 25 years ago or 22 years ago something
[1:40:24] like that don't concentrate or worry
[1:40:26] about those who aren't here but focus
[1:40:29] on those that are yeah and i try my best
[1:40:32] to do that but i i have to be honest as
[1:40:35] a human being it gets discouraging when
[1:40:37] i step out and there's two three people
[1:40:39] it's hard but it but it conversely
[1:40:42] though
[1:40:43] uh i draw so much strength
[1:40:46] in seeing us here right we're together
[1:40:48] you mean why do you think i leave out
[1:40:50] there before anybody and shake your hand
[1:40:52] and try to greet you and say hello and
[1:40:54] i draw strength from that i draw
[1:40:56] strength from your handshake and from
[1:40:58] your greeting i do
[1:41:00] it makes a difference to me
[1:41:02] let me this i usually i meant to read
[1:41:05] this last week must have been a reason i
[1:41:06] didn't because
[1:41:08] the lord gave me a quote that i wanted
[1:41:10] to look up and it turned out that it was
[1:41:12] in
[1:41:13] this that i wanted to read last week so
[1:41:15] i said well praise god it must have been
[1:41:16] a reason i didn't read it last week not
[1:41:18] that i couldn't read it both weeks but
[1:41:20] it is the word to a church a word to the
[1:41:23] church brother adam gave in christ the
[1:41:24] mystery of god revealed i used to read
[1:41:26] this the beginning of every year
[1:41:29] i haven't done that here i'd like to do
[1:41:31] that but it's always a good reminder to
[1:41:33] us and i hope if you're streaming you're
[1:41:35] listening
[1:41:36] sitting here listening
[1:41:40] said love one another above everything
[1:41:42] love one another
[1:41:44] no matter what the devil tries to say
[1:41:47] now you're all one great big sweet group
[1:41:50] now but remember my warning see
[1:41:53] satan won't let it stay that way no sir
[1:41:56] he'll shoot everything if he has to
[1:41:58] bring somebody in to make his target
[1:42:00] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:42:02] set him down and cause him to fellowship
[1:42:05] with you under the quietness and things
[1:42:07] then he'll shoot that guy with some kind
[1:42:09] of poison stuff and he'll start through
[1:42:11] the church with it don't you take sides
[1:42:14] with it
[1:42:15] don't you have nothing to do with
[1:42:17] anything else you stay right loving
[1:42:19] sweet kind to one another
[1:42:21] pray for that man that he'll be saved to
[1:42:23] or that woman ever who it is
[1:42:25] just pray for them and stick one with
[1:42:28] another and stay with your pastor see
[1:42:30] he's the shepherd
[1:42:31] and give him respects he'll lead you
[1:42:34] through he's ordained of god to do so
[1:42:37] now do you remember that the enemy will
[1:42:39] come and when he does listen now when he
[1:42:43] does just cling that much closer
[1:42:46] together
[1:42:48] praise the lord
[1:42:50] and the one that the devil is using for
[1:42:52] an enemy will either get out
[1:42:54] get out or come in and be one of you
[1:42:56] that's all and that's
[1:42:58] exactly
[1:42:59] don't never clan among one or talk make
[1:43:02] yourself clannish
[1:43:04] we are one
[1:43:06] i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you
[1:43:08] i'm going to take you away because
[1:43:10] you're not a right hand he's my left
[1:43:11] hand i want him to stay there even a
[1:43:13] little tip of my finger i want it to
[1:43:15] stay right there every little part of my
[1:43:17] body stay right there
[1:43:19] god wants us as a body of believers to
[1:43:22] stay right exactly with one another
[1:43:24] right with one another now you've got
[1:43:28] tapes on that you've got tapes on what
[1:43:30] we believe you've got tapes on
[1:43:31] discipline the church
[1:43:33] how we behave ourselves the church of
[1:43:35] god how we got to come
[1:43:37] here together set together in heavenly
[1:43:39] places
[1:43:40] don't stay home
[1:43:43] probably said
[1:43:45] don't stay home if god is in your heart
[1:43:49] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[1:43:52] open out yonder get in here and
[1:43:53] fellowship with your brothers
[1:43:56] if you don't feel that way then i tell
[1:43:58] you it's time you get to praying
[1:44:00] because we're in the last days where the
[1:44:03] bible exalt
[1:44:05] i think he means exhorted oh it exhorted
[1:44:08] us
[1:44:09] too much more as we see that day
[1:44:11] approaching that day that is this day
[1:44:14] that day approaching to love one another
[1:44:17] with christian love and divine love to
[1:44:19] assemble ourselves together in heavenly
[1:44:22] places in christ jesus and love one
[1:44:24] another this will all men know you're my
[1:44:27] disciples when you have love one for the
[1:44:29] other
[1:44:30] that's right stay right together if the
[1:44:32] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[1:44:34] sister say lord don't let me ever have
[1:44:36] the root of bitter to spring up because
[1:44:39] it'll affect him it'll take the christ
[1:44:41] right out of my life
[1:44:43] that poison asset of malice jealousy
[1:44:46] hatred
[1:44:47] that'll just take the holy spirit right
[1:44:49] away from you it'll run him from the
[1:44:52] tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[1:44:54] god or drive it away from here
[1:44:57] hurt your pastor it'll do everything see
[1:44:59] don't you do that you just wax that much
[1:45:02] closer together draw up that uh
[1:45:05] take that buckle as the brother
[1:45:07] testified minister he said
[1:45:09] uh that vision the buckles the whole
[1:45:10] armor of god just put it on tighten up
[1:45:12] move right up close together uh to one
[1:45:15] another love one another anyhow talk
[1:45:17] nice about one another say nice things
[1:45:19] about one another and god will bless you
[1:45:22] yes
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:23] what a wonderful prescription
[1:45:26] like i said i used to read that every
[1:45:27] year every january it's a good reminder
[1:45:30] to us yes amen because the enemy can
[1:45:32] come in those spirits the devil he
[1:45:35] doesn't like us standing together he
[1:45:37] doesn't like us staying as one group it
[1:45:39] doesn't like us loving one another and
[1:45:41] being and saying good things about each
[1:45:42] other he wants to separate divide and
[1:45:45] bring division and hatred that's his
[1:45:47] whole
[1:45:48] motive
[1:45:49] yeah but if we do exactly that what
[1:45:51] brother branham is just talking about we
[1:45:53] see results
[1:45:55] makes a difference
[1:45:57] i don't want to become complacent i said
[1:45:59] last week saints i don't want to become
[1:46:00] complacent here
[1:46:02] i don't want to become complacent with
[1:46:04] my walk with the lord i'm going to
[1:46:06] always the best i can continue to grow
[1:46:10] more like him to become closer to him
[1:46:14] every day
[1:46:15] amen every day
[1:46:16] praise the lord and it helps when we're
[1:46:18] together like that
[1:46:21] to become more like him
[1:46:23] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:40] i truly believe the lord's here now amen
[1:46:42] amen
[1:46:44] he's here to do whatever we have need of
[1:46:46] here today
[1:46:48] whatever your desire
[1:46:50] whatever we need is a congregation yes
[1:46:52] we're here together brother bannon of
[1:46:55] scripture talks about
[1:46:57] the protection of the prayer the blood
[1:47:00] over a specific individual assembly and
[1:47:03] each church has it
[1:47:05] each church has it
[1:47:06] yes and when when one goes out
[1:47:10] and
[1:47:11] or they transfer to a a different
[1:47:14] assembly then they fall under the
[1:47:16] protection of the blood of that assembly
[1:47:19] whatever happens in this assembly to
[1:47:21] those who have counted themselves as a
[1:47:22] part of that group happens to the whole
[1:47:24] assembly it affects the whole assembly
[1:47:27] it makes a difference that's why we come
[1:47:30] together in that love and that unity and
[1:47:32] that peace and the sweetness the brother
[1:47:33] brown just hold on the holy spirit
[1:47:35] together loving one another pray for one
[1:47:37] another
[1:47:38] then you see things happen right and you
[1:47:40] see god move
[1:47:42] you see a person on a deathbed rise up
[1:47:44] and come out of there
[1:47:46] amen like brother charlie was

[1:47:51] told teresa

[1:52:16] world
[1:52:17] praise god i know there's
[1:52:20] very
[1:52:22] important stories that we read in the
[1:52:24] bible
[1:52:25] where
[1:52:26] single men have done outstanding things
[1:52:29] but a lot of times it takes it takes
[1:52:32] more than one
[1:52:33] two three group congregation
[1:52:38] if uh satan comes at you like a roaring
[1:52:40] lion
[1:52:41] and you're all by yourself over here
[1:52:44] weak and depleted
[1:52:46] how much chance you think that lion has
[1:52:48] it getting a hold of right right
[1:52:51] amen but if you're with a group and
[1:52:53] you're with people and you've been
[1:52:54] strengthened in the word
[1:52:56] speaking the whole and that whole group
[1:52:58] comes against that lion he didn't have a
[1:53:00] chance

[1:53:20] with them many times he says i'm not
[1:53:22] able to be with you in the flesh

[1:53:31] able to be there
[1:53:32] praise the lord

[1:53:38] spirit of this world today of this
[1:53:40] country especially and you see that's
[1:53:42] satan's eating that's why that's why

[1:55:41] so
[1:55:43] please remember us in prayer though
[1:55:46] it's a lot of spirits a lot of people a
[1:55:48] lot of men a lot of different ideas
[1:55:50] there's already been
[1:55:52] you know things said but that just man
[1:55:54] don't worry about that you just roll
[1:55:56] over the top and keep going
[1:55:57] but sure appreciate your prayers for
[1:55:59] that uh if you would remember the prayer
[1:56:02] requests we had here
[1:56:03] uh
[1:56:04] it's good to see sister norman back and
[1:56:06] well the lord touched her
[1:56:08] and so thankful for that
[1:56:10] god bless each one of you uh i also
[1:56:13] wanted to uh
[1:56:15] remind you
[1:56:16] as far as the restroom is concerned
[1:56:19] uh i keep the little heater in there to
[1:56:21] because the women's heater works good so
[1:56:24] i just turned it on when i come if it
[1:56:26] gets too hot you can adjust the knob
[1:56:28] i don't like coming in and out of the
[1:56:30] ladies room but just to do that
[1:56:32] but the men's room doesn't so that's why
[1:56:34] you see the heater in there if it gets
[1:56:35] too hot turn it off i don't ever go in
[1:56:37] there so if y'all happen to go in the
[1:56:39] men's room and it's getting warm or
[1:56:41] something you can just turn the heater
[1:56:42] off but it's really cold there in the
[1:56:44] morning so
[1:56:46] when i come in so
[1:56:49] just remember and i keep it unlocked
[1:56:52] so i see people grabbing the key you
[1:56:54] don't need the key uh i unlock it we
[1:56:56] only did it that one time when we had
[1:56:58] the dinner so that because that room was
[1:57:01] open but that room's not open anymore so
[1:57:04] uh just leave the bathroom door unlocked
[1:57:06] so i unlock it about 10 o'clock when
[1:57:08] people are starting to show up and just
[1:57:10] leave it unlocked for the whole service
[1:57:11] gets too confusing where's the key and
[1:57:13] some people come in with the key and
[1:57:15] they're in there and they got the key
[1:57:16] and somebody else comes in they leave
[1:57:18] lock the door and the people are stuck
[1:57:19] in there
[1:57:21] i guess you can lock it from inside just
[1:57:23] we just leave it unlocked during church
[1:57:26] so i unlock it just leave the key there
[1:57:28] and just come in and out and then when
[1:57:30] service is over uh
[1:57:32] sony goes and sprays it all down with
[1:57:34] lysol and
[1:57:36] we get our soap and lock it up and turn
[1:57:38] the heat off and stuff like that so
[1:57:40] um we'll just
[1:57:42] try to remember that
[1:57:44] keep the key in one place and it'll just
[1:57:46] be unlocked since that room is locked so
[1:57:48] you don't have to worry about that
[1:57:50] amen
[1:57:57] why does it always feel like i've
[1:57:58] forgotten something
[1:58:02] um
[1:58:08] god bless you love you appreciate you i
[1:58:11] draw a lot of strength from you
[1:58:13] amen
[1:58:14] i love you very much
[1:58:16] pray for you
[1:58:17] and your families
[1:58:18] amen god's so good to us i appreciate
[1:58:21] the lord helping me
[1:58:23] this week keeping me safe
[1:58:26] and i appreciate your prayers i wrote i
[1:58:28] put in
[1:58:30] i don't think i wrote it but i put in
[1:58:31] the recording i did wednesday night that
[1:58:33] i appreciate your prayers for me too
[1:58:35] because those are protective prayers
[1:58:37] that keep me safe too and brother rogers
[1:58:40] thank you for that because we do
[1:58:43] we do some work that's potentially very
[1:58:45] dangerous
[1:58:47] that that happened to usually was just a
[1:58:49] crazy freak thing
[1:58:51] that is like a one in a million thing
[1:58:54] uh you know
[1:58:55] you'd think
[1:58:56] you know be nicer if my one in a million
[1:58:58] was the publisher's clearinghouse
[1:59:00] showing up my front door but
[1:59:02] but it had to be the thing in the middle
[1:59:04] of the face but i'm thankful god
[1:59:06] kept that and he keeps all of us so so i
[1:59:09] appreciate your prayers for us
[1:59:11] amen god's good to us so god bless you
[1:59:13] pray something was said to bless you
[1:59:15] today and appreciate each one of you
[1:59:18] love the lord jesus christ
[1:59:20] amen
[1:59:21] praise the lord we will have we won't
[1:59:23] have wednesday but we will have a
[1:59:25] regular service here next sunday morning
[1:59:26] just like normal
[1:59:28] cancel sunday there's harmony's not
[1:59:30] until 3 o'clock or so it used to be in
[1:59:32] the afternoon so
[1:59:34] we're not i'm not concerned about that
[1:59:37] i would advise you if you are going to
[1:59:39] try to go to harmony to get there as
[1:59:40] soon as you can
[1:59:42] you know the tabernacle and how limited
[1:59:44] the parking is and if the attendance is
[1:59:46] anything like it has been in harmony in
[1:59:47] the past which i'm thinking is probably
[1:59:50] not going to be
[1:59:51] uh being the fact it's at the tabernacle
[1:59:53] and coven it's probably going to be less
[1:59:56] attended
[1:59:57] but the parking as you know the
[1:59:59] tabernacle is very limited so i would
[2:00:01] advise getting there
[2:00:04] or as early as possible if you could
[2:00:07] so that would help
[2:00:09] but anyway
[2:00:10] so god bless you love you appreciate you
[2:00:18] my gracious heavenly father lord god has
[2:00:20] come to you at the close of this service
[2:00:21] lord thank you for
[2:00:22] everything you've done for us through
[2:00:24] the week
[2:00:25] then
[2:00:38] you've given us and what you shine
[2:00:40] through us yes lord lord help us as we
[2:00:43] go our separate ways keep us safe
[2:00:44] through the rest of this week lord and
[2:00:46] may you bless harmony in the desert may
[2:00:48] it be a blessing to those who watch or
[2:00:50] attend father god and we commit
[2:00:52] everything into your hands and expect to
[2:00:54] come sunday should you tarry lord and we
[2:00:57] thank you and commit everything into
[2:00:59] your hands in the name of the lord jesus
