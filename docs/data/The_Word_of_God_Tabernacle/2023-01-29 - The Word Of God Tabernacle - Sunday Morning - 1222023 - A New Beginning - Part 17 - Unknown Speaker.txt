Beyond than what we could imagine yes amen of the heavens above the Earth beneath amen it goes beyond what any human could ever comprehend you know it was said one time and I guess it's a true story but the last verse that was wrote of the love of God was wrote on the wall of an insane asylum Man became so consumed with God's love that it drove him mentally crazy in our human bodies just can't comprehend praise the Lord amen one more before we go to the Lord in prayer amen Psalm number 404 this one is in our book here be on the screen as well for number four all I want to do is love him

amen what else in life is there praise the Lord I know a lot of people have a lot of things that they look to and Trust in and believe in but I don't know anything I don't want to know anything but him amen amen praise the Lord look of the Lord in prayer now we can take a couple prayer requests here um sister Norma texted me earlier this morning she's not with us today she's not with us today because Daniel Kathy I believe she just said Daniel tested positive for covet but then she wrote me back and said Daniel and Kathy uh are getting over covid but they still have a lot of cough going on so since she had been with them recently she and sister Norma herself not feeling any symptoms but decided to stay home as a precautions so please remember her please remember Danny and Kathy as well you know Kathy is Norma's daughter Daniel's the gentleman that built the pulpit here for us so we know them very well but please remember them in prayer if you would um also got a prayer request appear from brother Danny thank you buddy uh please uh prayers for uh prayers for these mass shootings to cease uh an analyst pointing out that sometimes when there is one in the same area it may increase encourage others to do the same we have had more mass shootings uh than than days of this year um assuming that means that means that uh this is the 29th day of the year there's been over 29 mass shootings they could they consider it's it's a little deceiving though they they consider in statistics a mass shooting is more than two people or more than three people I forget it's more than two or three people so I guess when a when a person goes into a home and kills two or three people is considered a mass shooting anyway not going to a Walmart or to a fair or something and shooting up people or shooting out of the top of a hotel building in Las Vegas thank you buddy it's just we're more than three people are shot by one person is considered a mass shooting any any and all is unacceptable but we do know we are living and still living and Satan's Eden but it doesn't change how we feel about it in our hearts amen and I agree with brother Danny would be wonderful have these things that they would stop so amen do you remember that let's remember that request in prayer also um we also have a very deep heart deep felt request from Brother Pat and sister Pat um he texted me the other day I told him I'd leave it up to him as he as how he proceeded to let everyone in the congregation know but for the Pat's grandson Patrick Echo Patrick Henry Echols III uh passed away two days ago uh family I guess found him dead uh he was a pilot and uh airplane pilot and a Christian believer so that's what brother Pat if you wanted to add anything brother Pat feel free to or if you just leave it with this grandson he's only 31 years old 31 years old forgot to write read that part to the excuse me 31 years old it's very much a tragic tragedy of course the namesake of brother Pat and that sees the third so brother Pat Ackles the third passed away a couple days ago so please remember the family in prayer brother Pat sister Pat and all the ones perfected with passing here uh obviously Pat Jr lives in Memphis Tennessee so this was in Memphis but the family of course I'm sure is grieving quite heavily as I'm sure brother and sister Pat are here so please remember them in prayer if you would amen foreign Lord Jesus with our hearts and heads and reverence to the great God that we serve as large we are aware of the conditions and environment that we're living in but above all you are with your people amen you said I will never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end and father we ask that you help us to be more sincere in our walk with you yes Lord to take inventory daily to see what we're lacking what we're falling short to improve in our prayer life and and to truly be a compassionate and and sympathetic to the ones that are hurting the ones that are sick the ones like our brother and sister uh had to have a loss of precious loved one Lord and we know Lord that you have called us to a great message they'll get a bride ready for a Rapture and when I heard your prophets say earlier this week it's not enough to say I believe the message we need to obey the message yes we need to let Christ come in amen we need to surrender totally to Jesus Christ and let him have preeminence Hallelujah and Lord It's Your Grace that has called us as we sing those songs already Grace called us your grace will keep us in Grace will take us home yes and Lord bless each and everyone has made an effort to be here Lord with the prayer requesters several that are sick that need a touch from the almighty God Omar we call you on the scene yes it is our great high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our memories and with your stripes we are healed amen hello are we claim their your healing virtue to flow and each and every one reclaim deliverance from the lives of the Devil he's working harder than ever before he's trying to convince us oh we got a lot of time oh just sit back and relax oh you got time to enjoy the world when your word tells us he's in love with the world or the things that are in the world the love of God is not in them and father speak to our hearts yes we want it be victorious when when it comes to serving you or walking in an epistle ready known of all men Lord I said days of old in the book of Acts people took heed then disciples have been with amen yes may that be our testimony father other help us

sister Matisse go ahead sister yeah um I went to the bus stop this morning and um and had the best fellowship and I did I thought I mean I hope church is just half as good this morning and what happened was I told the story of a person that had had a dream that he was dying to be entering into a race and he had his little tag on to his registration for the race and he put it on and he started to uh it was one of those triathlons where he had run and you swim and you know bicycle and everything and so he started off running just as hard as he could in this race and so he's getting along on the path and there's this old man in the path and he's just wanting to talk to him and so he he stops and he's gracious and he talks to him and then he's just getting so nervous inside and he says you know I'm sorry but I'm in a race and I've gotta get going and so the man graciously he says okay so he takes off and he runs and he's going as hard as he can and then he gets to the part where he's swimming and then he's swimming as hard as he can and he's just you know he's pouring it on and it's like the last part of the race and he's gotta and he gets to that and he climbs out of the water and he gets to the finish line and he looks down in his tag for it is missing he can't find his tag it can't be a a a contestant and so he all that effort for nothing it breaks down a new Wheats and this woman comes over to him and says you know somebody turned in your tag for you it was um it and he thought about it a minute and he realized it was the old man and he realized he met Jesus is on the path now I'm in the shower this morning and I'm thinking about the scripture that says run the race you know that we might receive the prize and I was just thinking when I thought well what is the prize you know just kind of General with me the Holy Spirit spoke back to me and he said the Holy Spirit praise the Lord amen wonderful it is to be faithful to run this race with patience amen praise the Lord no time to quit now you know the last mile of any race is the hardest mile amen is the longest hardest mile but we continue to press amen press this battle press forward keep going amen not a time to quit it had already been turned in for him at the beginning of the race amen that was the thing praise the Lord that Grace amen must be born again you have the Holy Ghost you've got the token praise the Lord yes amen let's see this one more song Amen uh it's song number 26 in the book we'll have it on the screen here amen let's just start with the importance yeah I

a it was a pretty hard week the cold we're outside this whole time in the elements and Thursday morning it was four windshield was 13 below yesterday or Friday the wind was 35 to 45 miles an hour blowing ladders over everywhere so it was a it was a it was a pretty tough week out in the elements but I'm thankful the Lord blessed us we didn't really have any rain or snow or anything until actually Friday night Saturday morning but it was pretty cold even the even the guys that normally are live in Wisconsin and more so used to it and and and all were saying this is bad so it was cold but the Lord blessed us I'm thankful to have gotten home yesterday and Laura brought us home safe so again I appreciate your prayers because um it it made it I believe it made what I had to do easier just knowing that the Lord was with me and then so and and that you were here praying for me it makes all the world a difference
