commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God richly bless you today amen I want to go into the Bible now on to the scriptures and excuse me I'll start to start our the video recording there so amen and so I want to go to the Bible start with the revelations chapter 10 I want to go back and start back where we had left off before I went back to North Carolina my mother passed away and we had gotten through the mysteries of God in Christ part four I kind of wanted to wait until we were face to face again and then we only had a couple of services of face to face so we're back to here again for right now Lord willing next week we can go back to I hope by the grace of God back to where we're having face-to-face meetings but I want to start back again on the mysteries of God in Christ so this was actually be part 5 and we had laid a good foundation I believe at the beginning for and we kind of touched on highlights of different ones but remember when brother Branham preached amidst the crisis of mystery God revealed he hid three notes that he wanted to get across to the people and remember what those three notes were those three specific things one was that he could reveal himself to his people to that he can have the preeminence in that body of believers and three to restore the kingdom back to its proper position again so as we've hit those highlights when we've gone through the foundation of that as I would say that message and of course others that he hid parts of mainly that one I just titled the mysteries of God in Christ we're going to pick back up again this would be part five but I want to talk today and get more in specific about God revealing himself to his people God revealing himself to his people so if there's going to be a subtitle it will be God revealing himself to his people and remember the last if you can remember the last service the last message we had your part four was about revelation it was about God revealing and the revealing of God in his word to his people and remember brother Ram talked about that we should be praying for revelation in Revelation is more important in our lives and maybe what we realize and those things and going through the scripture and seeing how important it is that revelation come revelation really by the Holy Spirit is what differentiates someone who has the spirit and is getting the spiritual knowledge of the word not a head knowledge of the word versus someone that just has a simple head knowledge we talked about Cain and Abel and and the revelation that Abel had versus Kane wolf the more excellent sacrifice to God God accepted Abel's and rejected Cain's kenya's was a very good fine perfect to the letter sacrifice but it wasn't by revelation and if it wasn't by revelation was according to God's Word that word that Adam spoke I believe to Eve and that hand that story that that trans transferred over to his - to Cain and Abel to one that word to one that message became a revelation to the other it was simple head knowledge it was simple understanding of it not revelation when came at it by revelation he recognized and realized it wasn't just what they had done but it was what good what was acceptable by God as being a revealed truth Cain accepted that word that message from it from Adam as just knowledge just is something as a surface issue a lot of times we look at things and they become surface issues and that's how we learn most of the time that we learn in this country we learn in this world we learn as humans it's all surface issues it's all facts and figures and things like that we look at data and we look at statistics and we look at everything is put in front of us to come up with a conclusion its scientific hypothesis and all those things that we come out we come up with a hypothesis because of facts things that we know information we've been given but that's not the way God operates God created science but God doesn't look to science to prove who he is we don't look to science to understand who he is we look to revelation we look to God revealing that word to us we look to God revealing himself to us once we see that word and once we understand what the revelation is to us then we act upon that revelation and that revelation becomes a part of us that just is that word becomes is that word is revealed and that word becomes revealed or revelation to us and becomes a part of us just like we understand and know who we are as human beings we know who we are in Jesus Christ has got to be by revelation it can't be tangible it's got to be something by faith because faith is a revelation if you just look on surface and say oh Adam and Eve had Botany life and they covered themselves in the fig leaves and okay well then I'll just offer a bottie life sacrifice and that'll be okay but see that's all King had was that surface issue of of knowledge Adam are able heard it and he heard what was acceptable to God was what God did in the Garden of Eden and what it took to be to be pleasing to the Lord and it was revealed to him as a son of God through Adam as he son of God what the truth really was and he offered to God that blood sacrifice that was acceptable to meet the sin that started the halt the whole ball rolling remember it was a sacrifice of a original sin of a blood transfusion or blood transferring of hemoglobin from the serpent to the woman well the only way to meet that sin was by the blood and that blood of a human of that of an animal that blood cell was broke to be able to meet that sacrifice to meet that that sacrifice to meet that sin it had to be this it had to be something that would meet it and body life wasn't enough killing a watermelon killing a cucumber killing a head of lettuce was not sufficient to meet the sin had to be blood because it was a blood transfer of sin I had to be a blood transfer to meet that sin so Abel understood that by revelation we got that revelation we saw that last time now I want to dig into this I know this is going to be a couple services so I'm trying not to rush and just take my time that's why I wanted to lay that well I wasn't intending to do it quite like that but the Lord laying that foundation revelation again of understanding because we are going to go back to the Garden of Eden again and look and go back to that point but I want to go back because we're starting back over with Christ and mystery God revealed all the mysteries of God in Christ part 5 so I want to go back to Revelation chapter 10 and again read that one verse verse 7 you have your Bibles read it with me but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets notice that again but you know when he began to sound the mystery of God should be finished I remember what we talked about that mystery what is that Street what is the mystery of God that was to be finalized or unfolded to the point of completion for for people to get that revelation for it to cause a body change and for this bride to go in a rapture it was to be a completion see that's all the other ages was never able to reach that they had their time and they lived their understanding of the revelation they live their anointing for their day but this is old this is the last day this is a rapture time so there had to be something come to finish to finish that mystery for that mystery to be revealed to be understood to unfold to a people that we could understand it that it could be something that and on that means spiritual understanding not physical understood that it can be revealed so based on that we know that that mystery so what is that mystery that was to be completed of revelation to a group of people for a body changed to take them in a rapture that mystery is Jesus Christ Christ the mystery of God revealed in Christ is all the mysteries that have been hid from ages and generations but Christ is that mystery singular we go again read it again the mystery singular of God that was to be revealed Jesus Christ who Christ is what he is today who he is to us he's not the second third tenth person of a Trinity He is God Almighty veiled in flesh he is a part of the the father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ the Godhead that makes up the completion of God as he's unfolded himself to us down through ages is to remember we talked about or even read that quote of the up the slowly unfolding mysteries poor of Jesus Christ condescending himself to bring us to this place of going in a rapture that mystery is Christ many people today miss on that mystery they don't have or understand spiritually understand that mystery who Christ really is when he asked his disciples he said thou art the Christ of Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou for flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father in heaven that has revealed unto you and upon this revelation I will build my church at revelation of who Jesus Christ is he's not a second person at Trinity he's not some subservient God God did not create himself or recreate himself He is God it's that part of God that came out that that has unfolded itself to bring a revelation an understanding to a group of people that we could see that and it be revealed to us so Christ is the mystery so you see again the foundation that we're building off of for this message and for the messages the subsequent messages that come from this and what brother Branham gave in Christ's mystery God reveal because remember again subtitle is God revealing himself to his people the number one thing that that brother Branham put in Christ and mystery God revealed to unfold that to the people God revealing himself to his people now how was God gonna do that when he encompassed all space time and eternity he's a spirit being that encompasses now how is he going to condescend or come to a place to work us and our human frailties and our limited human abilities are little pea brains because you you can't comprehend it like that the great Einstein and the great thinkers of of history great brilliant people of history that you've made inventions and and then all these things couldn't begin to touch what God really is and what God has done and bring us to this place of who we are and who he is to us so let's start on Rev at Revelation chapter 12 we'll just go over a pager Revelation chapter 12 and begin with verse 1 now again like I said to you I'm not gonna I'm not going to try to rush I'm not going to try to push all this into a service maybe 2 or 3 we'll see where the Lord brings it or we get it to here so but Revelation chapter 12 let's look at this real quick I just want to read a couple of verses and and and I'm sorry but I will apologize and let you know now they'll probably be some jumping around a little bit because there's so much of this that encompasses into that one focus of Christ that sometimes it's hard to bring it all in exactly chronologically and the way the Scriptures read read sometimes it's hard to bring it all out like that son I trust you indulge me a little bit but now Revelation chapter 12 verse 1 it says and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars now let's look at that for a few moments because this scripture brings a great transition this scripture brings a great understanding of that transition time of Jesus Christ let me go ahead read the second verse and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered now that was Jesus Christ this woman bringing forth Jesus Christ now we know that the Jews were have been looking for their Messiah for years hundreds thousands of years they have been looking for their Messiah so let's read this there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman a woman what does Woman represent we know woman represents church well this church is not Gentile Church this is the old Orthodox Church Israel that represents woman this woman a woman clothed with the Sun now we know what the Sun is that's the gospel that's that that's God Christ is the light that is the Sun the Sun coming forth and she is clothed with this so you understand that this woman now clothed with the Sun has has a transitional period coming because because the Sun on this Orthodox Church to saw this woman is beginning to come forward because she's clothed in it so she's coming forth she's bringing forth this child notice now that now as he came for his people rejected him we know that but it had to come forth to the time that it could go to the Gentile and then now then again back when God finishes that transgression of Daniel that it comes back to the Jews again but this woman now clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet now what is the moon the moon is a reflector what is it reflector reflects the Sun but the moon here represents the law but look what the law is now it's because remember the law was just a foreshadow of the grace of God and what God Christ was going to bring as he magnified that while he was here but see notice when when the law was there it was dominant over over humanity it over preached over well not Christianity but godliness you it dominated see they had to follow the law the letter of the law exactly the way it was but now as Christ has come close this woman the law where is it now it's under her feet the law is under her feet why because a new dispensation is about to take place the law becomes subservient because the law giver is now their clothing the woman and the and the moon is just a shadow of what of what was to come so now the shadow the shadowy moon is under the feet with with with the woman standing there clothed in the Sun so you see how this transition is taking place now the the moon is under the feet amen not not that it went away notice some people will say there is no law or the law went away no it didn't no it did still there but we know that the law became overcome were taken over by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ of God so it came subservient now the Bible says Paul said if you want to live by the law you can live up a law if you want to if you want to reject the grace and mercy of Jesus if you don't want to live by His mercy then then you're welcome to do that you can live by the law but you if you're if you live by one of it you got to live all of it if you're guilty of one of it you're guilty of all of it see if you want to choose that's fine but notice the transition it's putting the law under his feet and this woman this Orthodox Church is getting ready to bring forth and a transition is taking place to bring Jesus Christ and they depend and the crown of twelve stars is just the patriarchs you notice that the disciples the twelve disciples hadn't even been chosen yet because Christ hasn't even been born yet see that so that twelve you got the twelve crown of twelve stars was that was the old patriarchs the sons of Jacob see those those are those twelve stars but now notice in this transition in the second verse now she had this woman being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered so she as they had been crying for the Messiah all that time all those years he had been crying for the Messiah travailing in birth to bring forth this child Jesus Christ Christ being there for for him to come forth because remember Jesus even said in the Bible it does not say that he came for me it didn't say it came for you he told them he came for the lost sheep of the house of Israel now we understand the twofold purpose and the reasons other reasons beside that but Jesus himself said he came for the lost sheep of the house of Israel not the Gentiles now when he left and this message entered in and through Pentecost descent the the Jews to the Gentiles and the Gentiles received this message of course and and of course gave birth to Pentecost gave giving birth to the Gentile dispensation and the seven church ages that we have gone through now but Jesus himself said I come to the lost sheep of the house of Israel so when he came forward closes purpose of coming forth it was coming forth as this woman was travailing they were asking Messiah when the Messiah come forth would that priest do he held Jesus and dedicated and said my eyes have seen his salvation now I can die in peace I believe or something like that you know because that's what they've been waiting for now the Jews of course as a whole rejected him of course a part of the transgression again of Daniel 7 so he so he turns the disciples the message goes to the Jews to the Gentiles but that woman was waiting to deliver to bring deliverance of Jesus Christ now let's go over to Isaiah chapter 9 I wanna you know the scripture belt but I want to pick through this and and because remember we're talking about God and we're talking about God bringing himself into a place into a way that he could reveal himself to his people he said what God can do anything he absolutely can but he had to make it in a way that follows his word because he couldn't transgress is on word and I had to be in a way to where we could receive it there's only so much that that the human can take only so much that the human mind can take I mean you go back and listen to brother Graham said there's things that the Lord would give to him it just he just was just even too much for the human body Paul was caught up to the third heaven there's just it had to be in a way where it could actually be revealed and received by the people so as we talk about this God revealing himself because we can see remember about man said now if you can't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again because he's there so Isaiah chapter 9 let's read verse 6 in the context of what we just read now from revelation 12:4 unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace now how does that how does that sound like the second person of a Trinity does that sound like someone a description in the Bible does that sound like a description of someone who is not God when it says he is the mighty God the everlasting father does that sound like somebody that's that's not a part of who he really is and that is God himself well that's exactly what it says a child is born a son is given what is that that's that woman travailing in pain to give birth to that child revelation 12 - we just read see a Sunday now is born in Chosun is given the government upon his shoulders his name is wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father the Prince of Peace the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David which which that no one brings us to to which we will get into probably eventually Hebrews where talks about Melchizedek who had no mother no father no beginning and days no ending of life Amen who was that Melchizedek praise the Lord is what became the flesh Jesus the government and peace there should be no end amen remember no kissing no beginning of days no ending of life what is that that's eternal eternal had no beginning has no ending oh who is eternal God oh it's so good I guess when it's revealed to you it becomes a real simple doesn't it you look at you think out them everybody else now see this how does this not make as we would say since for everybody uh you know but when your eyes are enlightened and your eyes are opening you receive the revelation and it just becomes as simple as baptism you know we baptize it's funny because the world of the Christian world they will say that they should do everything in the name of Jesus until they go to baptize people they do everything in the name of Jesus till they go to baptize one of the most important things that you can happen in regeneration to be baptized and they dunk them and they put them in the name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost and that's not even a name father son Holy Ghost sink nation you've been baptized in the name Father Son Holy Ghost you mean been baptized the name of the Lord Jesus promised all you do the word or deed do in the name of the Lord Jesus II but it becomes simple then it's it just you think how can people not see this but they can't because our eyes are blinded they can't see it they and the Bible says the song Ian's 2nd 2nd Thessalonians 2 that their eyes are blinded is blinded to those that are lost amen the god of this world says have blinded their eyes there should be no end upon the throne of David and upon the kingdom to order and establish it with the judgment at justice from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this now we notice his child we noticed the son had been given was a fulfillment of what we read seed revelation 12 to this woman the Orthodox Church that was pained to deliver pain to bring forth the son pained to have this son come forth as they know we know as the deliverer Jesus Christ the son coming forth third verse now because notice we're getting to the revelation or a countenance ending see because the culmination of that was in the flesh man called Jesus verse 3 now went back to Revelation 12 verse 3 so we've we've completed that first two verses we've gone and saw in Isaiah where he prophesied almost 800 years before it ever even happened Isaiah prophesied I forgot them seven hundred and seventy some years I believe it is before Christ was born Isaiah's prophecy in it so bringing that fulfillment revelation 12:1 and 2 now looked at 3rd verse and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his head now notice the impersonation of this entity the counterfeit nature of this entity this red dragon as we know is the devil Satan Lucifer tainted evil this red dragon the devil seven heads the number of God the seven is the number ten orders and number seven upon his head notice the numerology there he's counterfeiting impersonating God those are all perfect numbers of God see seven 10 three five he impersonated that's that's the devil and he in his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born now we see this this red dragon Satan setting there and more than we can read about him I believe this Isaiah 12 we can read about it wanting to exert maybe 14 wanting to exalt himself above God wanted to be worshipped as God wanted to be exalted above God wanted to be exalted above the Most High we see this red dragon this devil Satan wanting to be worshipped as God wanting to be higher than God so he begins to minister his tail drawing these people his charismatic way of delivering his charismatic energy of of getting people getting the angels the third of the stars of the heaven that angels the third of the angels in heaven to be so charismatic and so in drawing of the people of those angels that he actually got them to believe what he was trying to tell them he actually got those angels to believe a part of them what he was telling them but what he was telling them was drawing them away from the truth drawing them away from God bringing them into his fallen condition that he that the hidden he was in barline deception deceiving those angels by his tail by his preaching by his ministry so charismatic so involving so on so engulfing getting the people getting them to believe he does the same thing today not just the Angels he does the same same tactics today such a well well-versed speaker it comes in with great flatteries he gains the confidence of the people forget the word forget the revelation forget the truth of the work he isn't he a magnificent speaker who cares what magnificent speaker they are if they're telling a lie don't listen to it if they're telling a lie it's wrong I don't care how beautiful the speaker they are I don't care how many peoples in the church how big the steeples and stained-glass windows makes no difference that's the devil in the beginning he's so beautiful elegant but you listen to what they say what they say doesn't match this word then you've got a problem get away from it you run from it his tail drew the third of the stars of heaven II he cast in the earth and now the dragon is standing before this woman the burner the woman Orthodox Church delivering Christ bringing forth the Messiah the deliverer and this devil this red dragon right there waiting anticipating this delivery remember Lucifer was God's right-hand man at one time he's anticipating waiting for this delivery standing there waiting for this child to be born so he could devour it him as soon as he is born to try to bring him into himself how did he do that well first thing you try to do is he had Herod Herod was a hateful jealous ungodly man and Satan had gotten any filtrated in Herod and Herod was sitting there waiting to kill that boy so much so and you know the story that made giant then coming and you know they realize that they've been a couple of years that that that he hated it so much he wanted to he wanted to devour this man child so much that he killed every man child from two year old and under every one of them he had of everyone killed just so he could try to get this one Jesus Christ he killed them all fortunately as we know as Christians God leads us and guides us and helps us and shows us you know sometimes it's not doesn't make any sense sometimes it's not understandable or why would I be doing this why would God leave me here why would God tell me this you know maybe Joseph and Mary were there maybe Joseph was thinking the same thing or while we're here now we got to go over here Oh Lord why don't we gotta go over here now why are you taking this over here why are we having to do that but see it's God in control it's God keeping and saving his own taking care of his own people so God sends him away so that they're not there when the slaughter comes Mary Joseph and Jesus are in another country he didn't find him because they're not there to be found God takes care of his own amen but Satan they are ready to devour that child as soon as it's born because he knew exactly what it was going to cost Satan knew exactly what it was going to take and he did everything he could to try to to kill that child as soon as it was born and then of course everything after that he did everything he could try to devour Jesus Christ because that was the Messiah that was deliver that was the child that was to come forth that transition that was to go from the all old law to the new grace from the old way of living to a new life to the blood of Jesus that was not the not the meaning of a sacrifice or meaning of a sin remember the blood sacrifice that was in the Garden of Eden I will read it hopefully we have time today to get to that part to read that to see where that sacrifice was met with the with the that sin was met with the sacrifice able by revelation realized it took blood Jesus our God killing the lambs in the Garden of Eden and throwing the bloody sheet skin into into a Adam and Eve was was indicative of that first sacrifice the first breaking of that blood cell of an animal to meet the hemoglobin blood sin original sin in the garden beating with the serpent but now it's going to take it had to take the blood of God himself dead blood cell of Jesus Christ that broke that released God was not something that just met the sacrifice or the that met the sin it was overtaking of that sin it annihilated that sin it didn't just meet the sin so that we can stand in and be okay with God again it annihilated that sin so we could become him praise the Lord the only way it could be that way they couldn't have done it under that old sacrifice there had to be the transition there had to be that blood not just to meet the sin but to annihilate the scene so that the worshiper then could become as him he became us so that we could become him and now it transitions into a place that this that we by revelation see who we are in him if we see who we are that that's enough to bring a faith to a group of people to go on a rapture there's no body change gonna come any other way faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God and not some denomination we're not just some seminaries word or some man-made idea of theology or dogma but the true revealed Word of God that's the only thing is gonna take a bride in a rapture that's the only thing that brings faith it's met right here Satan knew that Satan knew that that's why he did everything he could to destroy that child look now fifth first and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of God that she should feed there that that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred threescore days has three and a half years go back to revelation 11 three you see that three and a half years the tribulation time the time where at the marriage south of Gentiles are at the marriage supper of the Lamb of God comes at the end of that you got the two witnesses Moses and Elijah come down and it reveals himself and that's the Jews revelation 11 and this three and a half years is where she said at the end of that its word Zechariah said he comes and they realize who he was the transgression is removed and they realized who he was and they cry out put on sackcloth and ashes and said where do you get those scars and he said in the house of my friends and they realized as the people that they had crucified their own Messiah and it becomes a revelation to them their eyes are open and they see the message which we receive what is that message that message is Jesus Christ Christ the mystery of God that message has come to us has been revealed we see it by revelation is now coming to them that message what is the message the message is Christ the word is Christ coming to them so that they see the word they receive the word of their day we received the word of our day not awful books and tapes not because of brother Brandon but because God revealing himself who Christ is to us who he is to us and who we are in him amen it becomes a revelation truth it's what trans transitions us from this human natural life into a body changed to a rapture the gentleness you get that there are three and a half years this woman there one thousand two hundred threescore days has three and a half years they see that there was a war in heaven Micah seventh verse now Michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven praise the Lord the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil now we've got him we've identified him Amen just like we've identified God veiled in flesh as Jesus Christ he has a name his name is not father his name is not son his name is not Holy Ghost his name is Lord Jesus Christ we've identified this great red dragon now in the scripture this serpent called the devil and Satan there we are who deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him course we are to know that because up here revelation in the third verse that says our full force fourth verse his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth so we already knew that but now those we see that red dragon the devil Satan cast to the earth and his angels cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation strength the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they day who is they I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them they me you they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death and they did through the dark ages they gave their lives up by the millions therefore rejoice ye heavens and either dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he has but a short time praise the Lord for that and that time of this last day would be shortened according to Matthew that that Jesus told us but look at this one too the habit of the earth and of the sea inheritors of the earth antiserum ember revelation 10 7 we talked about when he put one foot on land and one foot on sea there it is it's a conquering it's a it's an overcoming of the earth and the sea Jesus Christ conquering the mighty conquer the earth and the sea made us more than conquerors now for the devil's come down having wrath because he know that his time is short so he's a busy guy he's a busy beaver he's working overtime because he knows he doesn't have but just a short time so what does he do he starts out right straight off in the Garden of Eden right when God creates man now he creates he animal life and botany life or botany life and then animal life and human life and the the evolutive if you want to call that of God's creation from Lois more bonding to the animal to the human the human now is is in that creation is is Adam God creates Adam as a spirit man well first of all God God created the heaven and the earth we can look at that I was going to do that next week but we can read your real quick right here because it'll give us that beginning here but we should know it all anyway just 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters see God spoke the power that spoken word coming forth creating heavens and earth galaxies universes whatever we want to term them or call them God created just by the simple word of his mouth now he had to have faith to believe it Hebrews 11:1 faith frame the everything that we see the worlds that we see God's the word by faith believe that find it but then the Spirit of God came and moved out amen the Spirit of God came and brooded over this earth there had to be that second part um this isn't the third part of the Godhead this isn't the this isn't God saying okay Holy Ghost now I want you to go down there and and and burn over that or no it's a Spirit of God not not a third person the Spirit of God I don't mean to be pointing to myself as God but the Spirit of God he pointed out the Spirit of God went forth out because remember God's a spirit anyway but the Spirit of God moved out and brooded over the earth and God then made man in his own image what was the image of God is a spirit man God's Spirit so he made man a spirit but then God took the clay of the earth and he molded it into a man just like the just like the trees of the ground rooted that man in the Garden of Eden and in the rooting of that man in the Garden of Eden he formed him into man but man didn't become a living soul until God breathed into him the breath of life then he was then he wasn't just spirit but he was also living bond man amen and then and then Adam had that had that that nature in him in the Garden of Eden comes forth as a man to rule over the earth he pulls those roots out of the ground and he starts to walk forth upon the earth as a living soul as a soul of man as a as a spirit man as a body man as a three oh three fold unity of the human element body spirit soul is the same as God flesh God spirit God flesh God Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost Trinity still the same God not Trinity but it's he's one God just like on one person see that's Adam become that now when Satan was cast out this red dragon on the earth he didn't go and try to convince Adam because Adam was a spoken word of God Adam was the first spoken word of God that God spoke and he came forth remember Jesus was the only begotten Son of God but Adam was the created son of God God created Adam in his own image in his own likeness breathe into him his old life the breath of life so Adam was the living embodiment of God upon this earth he was the a mature god of this earth he could speak you could name he could say you can do whatever he wanted to do this earth because he had complete supreme control animals body life nature everything Adam was in complete control of it because God called him and put him in that place to do that / for that purpose name the animals and what God did through now he was the complete embodiment he was that it may be complete he was that embodiment of God that he that he created that man and he looked and he was happy he was glad in fact he was so happy with that him he came down every day the Bible says and walked in the garden beat and talked without the cool of the evening live to ear that fellowship my or a beautiful picture if you can think of it for a woman talking and fellows shipping together but God recognized that he made an animal life he made which we are mammal humans he made animal life he made the male and the female but in the human life he'd only made the male Adam was the embodiment of God so what God did is we took out a he put Adam into asleep and he took from Adam oh my the beautiful picture of God bringing forth unfolding himself to us by revelation seen the work of God and through into Jesus Christ and the flesh of God being here walking among us he's showing us this by taking the woman out of his side but taking this church this bride out of his side he took Eve the woman not Eve the woman out of his side and turned then took this rib and made the woman out of Adam that's why she's called Wolfman because she's from the man and God formed her and made her to be a helpmate to add and this woman now being a byproduct was in the position just like animal life just like the serpent was subject to deception now he Adam was the created son of God Eve was a byproduct of that creation from his side notice Jesus when you hung at Calvary they pierce decided Comfort blood and water this bride the woman the helpmate the bride coming forth from Jesus Christ just a four figure of God showing the condensation of himself to where we as a people could see it and it be revealed to us that we can that we can know that was God showing himself to us the whole time back from Genesis 1 back from Genesis 2 3 the Garden of Eden God revealing himself showing when he's going to do we can look back now and see that my prophecy those of old who were belong to God could look forward by prophecy just like Isaiah said a son shall be of a child born a son is given he should be called counselor principes he was looking forward to see what was coming what was all therefrom even in the Garden of Eden what was coming forth but now this woman Satan sees not only can he work through the serpent but he can work through another byproduct called the woman and he approached her and began to talk and reason with her so that he could deceive her into causing everything that God had created and all the beauty and splendor that God had done and perverted causing every day to fall and be perverted which was to do what bring about the necessity of God to unfold himself to his people God to come and reveal himself to his people and show himself that he is the Almighty not just a third person saying in person the Almighty God so that that board that issued forth conquered the sin and of course we know in the garden in the Millennium man will live 1,000 years again never did it before but those Allah came to close 969 years but no man ever lived one full day a thousand years but we will in the Millennium because the curse is broken amen the fulfillment of that's going to take place at that time it's already been done but the fulfillment of that is going to be in the garden in the Millennium now let's get to this before I close here we'll have to continue on later but in Genesis chapter three verse one now we know that that Adam now has Eve now has the woman she's not Eva I always keep that remembers I drove that home to you before I want to remember that again she is not even she's just woman and that's how Adam refers to her as woman until after the fall born of his own flesh of his flesh life of his life see but now the serpent was more subtil more cunning crafty sensible then any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden I remember that deception remember Satan's Trinity of deception first is to bring doubt second is to hybrid the word third is to bring his own gospel he does the same thing today this is that doubt again yeah if God said now remember this is that were just in the third chapter of Genesis so god well from the first verse we just read it the God showing himself as the unfolding God and revealing himself to his people see but now this just in the third verse he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden see bringing down there's a question it's not a statement it's a question a lot of times people read that as a statement yeh had God said you not yet out of every tree of the garden no it's not a statement there's a question yeh had God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden question brings question to the woman the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruits of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst middle of the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she don't know how does she know this how does she know this how does she know that's what God said because if you go look at the Bible you see that God said that before the woman was created God said that before the woman's creative hoody teletoon Adam had an evening because Adam her head her husband her flesh-and-bone told her about it he's the one that relayed the message that done you won't find that in the scripture but if you look at it chronologically it you can see that how else was she know the other thing that I want to point to is this part here were in the 17th verse after the fall now God is speaking to the serpent then he spoke to Eve and now he's speaking to Adam so to solidify this in your mind that that this that her understanding had to have come from Adam because remember she is not a part of the original creation animal life is but there without a soul amen remember the conscience there the the soul of man the free will the the understanding they don't have a soul but now if this will solidify it look at the 17th first still in Genesis 3 he's already talked to the serpent and he's already talked to the woman and we can read it I won't get in to be able to get into it today but oh we can look at that later or you can look at it when we're done here look at the 17th verse and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake now - and very important points here one point I just want to hit a highlight of real quick he didn't curse at him he cursed the ground but the main thing I want you to see in this verse is that God told Adam has thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it now you go back in and we will but you go back and you read what he tells the serpent and what he tells the woman he does not tell either one of them that they transgressed his work he doesn't tell either one of them that they did what he told them not to do you notice it's not in their curse it's not in God's conversation with them only to Adam does God say that you did something that I told you not to do only Adam because only Adam was the one that received the original instruction of not to partake of it so what didn't even get it from God didn't tell me that God didn't say Eve you did what I told you not to do where did she get it she got it from the one that he told not to do Adam he said I commanded you not to do this and you did it but did you imagine and you could just picture that this man this perfect man and that has the most perfect most beautiful woman in my opinion ever to grace the earth outside of my wife of course that Adam had as as his helpmate as his wife in taking her arm and arm strolling through the most beautiful place ever existed on this planet we're going back to it face up Lord I'm so thankful we're going back to it but did you imagine him taking her and then going arm and arm together walking through the garden beam and he's tall and he's telling her oh look I not it's not Eve so he's not calling her Evie says look honey I I mean this I made this animal a tiger you're watching for a little bit you'll see has natures and why I named in that and you see this fruits of the tree all this this apples good it tasted it it's red and delicious sorry for the played on words but and eat it now and they're sitting there eating apples and and they keep going down and they said Oh we'll see this this is called a carrot and see this is called this tree and look at this beautiful flower see this rosebush and you can grab the rose because you know there's no forms on it yet if this beautiful smell this you know God took me through and we've walked through this garden numerous times honey and you know we just enjoyed our time together and I want you to enjoy it just like we have he'll be down this evening again as he always is but you know he told us other things that were not to do told me and as he begins to relay all those things to her he's telling her everything letting her know keeping her informed giving her the message giving her the message of truth giving her the message that God had give him and that's how she understood and that's how she says the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the guard but in the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she died she knows that house because her husband told her husband told her now I want us to see because I'm gonna pose here because I again and I know I man that I'm gonna have to break this up so we'll just stop it there but I want to continue on in the Garden of Eden because remember see Satan's kicked out of heaven and and look and see how many times not we probably pick them all love I'm not saying I know them all but God slowly unfolding that mystery slowly revealing to us what was to eventually be the coming of the Son of God Jesus Christ put a name on it Jesus put flesh on it in Jesus that reveals himself to us the revelation that God brings to us so that we could be able to see it today amen praise the Lord god bless you today I pray something was said to help you I probably need to get as far as I wanted to on this today but Lord willing next week I'll be able to get it a little bit deeper and a little more but I want to take my time than just give it as the Lord gives to me so I trust it was a blessing to you today and the Lord helped you with it now anybody I will say got a couple announcements to make but first of all let me just get this out of the way before I forget it but the family camp the family camp up in the White Mountains has been canceled due to so much of the kovat and especially in Phoenix a lot of the Phoenix people go up for that the family camp July 22nd to 26 that I've told you about before has been cancelled due to the such a wide spread of the kovat going on so these you remember I don't I hadn't heard he freed by if you were gonna go so but if you were you did not already know that family camp has been cancelled I also want to remind you the funeral Thursday I'll try to get those details to you this week the Lord willing also wanted to remind you that if you'd like to come today to the baptisms at the Sanctus house and their swimming pool three people that sister Matisse have been talking and witnessing to that just that gave a desire to want to be baptized so if you'd like to do that 4 o'clock at their house we don't know where it is just let us know if you want to come and want to be a part of it just let us know that and and then you could be a part of that with us if you'd like to do that also want to remember my precious wife she's a year older than she was the last time we were up here before you very thank for the Lord's blessed her with another year and another time to be together with her I know it's kind of surreal for her now she's as old as I am so we're we're equal again in age at least for another couple few months anyway so happy birthday to my wife love her very dearly we had a pretty heavy storm last night too that came through we've gone out for dinner and we come back and radical beds and came back and as emergency vehicles all over our complex and trees two or three big trees rooted up trees down and falling on apartments and limbs and stuff that was hitting just things everywhere we we had to go around the eye to go around the complex to get around the corner to come to even get to our apartment but we get over there's this big huge tree next to us and all this vegetation everything and we barely had a couple leaves on our porch so Lord just protected us and kept us and serving to appreciate the Lord blessing us with that now also next week the Lord willing my desire my intention is to have the full live in-person service again at the Holiday Inn at 11 o'clock so remember that if there's anything any different I'll let you know but Lord willing next week at eleven o'clock we'll start having services at the Holiday and again their own cartero if you don't know where it is just let us know several of you have been there already anyway so you know where it is but Lord willing next week unless you hear from me we'll be at the Holiday Inn at eleven o'clock next Sunday also it looks like the Lord has provided us a more permanent place we'll see how it goes still just trusting him but brother Roger and I did a job for brother Nate Garcia didn't realize who he didn't realize who he was just answer him to add off of the an ad in the paper for electrician we go do the work and find out it's brother Nate in his wife Teresa there you may know from the tabernacle well he bought building from his mother Lucy but they are no Lucy that used to be brother Mike Behar's old office his old insurance office own grant and taxi home country club just south of Grant or north of granite would be on the east side of the street and it's eleven twelve hundred square foot maybe but there's there's got to be some stuff done to it a couple offices removed we went looked at it me and brother Roger with him and we're all three very excited about the prospect of maybe this working out so brother Nate does some streaming so he used these streams at 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning and then brother Rogers talks about moving his service up to 9:30 and then us having an 11:30 and then we could just all three have the building of course brother Nate stream for the Roger stream so we would be the actual only church people that that are that are actually there so it's a Grant Country Club I would really appreciate your input on next weekend and that being is a prospect of a place to meet if that works so it looks like the Lord had just brought this together but I just I want to make sure that's true so I don't want to make sure everything works out fine with that it may be another month or two or something before we get everything done and get it ready to occupy we'll see what the Lord does with it but I want to let you know what what's going on and give you that update if you have

Lord richly bless you let's just take a moment to bow our heads for a dismissal prayer if we couldn't so aim in this bar hits Lord Jesus father were very thankful that you've blessed us with another beautiful day thank you Father for this service thank you for this time thank you for this ability to stream and have a way to get the message out Lord that you put on my heart for it it was probably
