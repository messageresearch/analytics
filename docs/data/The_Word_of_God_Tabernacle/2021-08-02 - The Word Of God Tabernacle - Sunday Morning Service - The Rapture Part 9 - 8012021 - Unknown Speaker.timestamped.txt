[43:45] chapter 4
[43:46] verse 13 we read these few verses again
[43:48] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[43:50] brother concerning them which are asleep
[43:52] that you sorrow not even as others which
[43:54] have no hope
[43:56] for if we believe that jesus died and
[43:58] rose again even so then
[43:59] all also which sleep in jesus will god
[44:02] bring with him
[44:04] for this we say unto you by the word of
[44:06] the lord that we which are alive and
[44:07] remain
[44:08] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[44:09] prevent them which are asleep
[44:11] for the lord himself shall descend from
[44:13] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[44:14] the archangel of the trump of god and
[44:16] the dead in christ shall rise first
[44:18] then we which are alive and remain shall
[44:20] be caught up together with
[44:21] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[44:23] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[44:25] the lord
[44:26] wherefore comfort one another with these
[44:28] words
[44:29] god bless you can be seated if you like
[44:32] amen appreciate the lord's goodness amen
[44:35] amen and
[44:36] i want to take another avenue of what we
[44:38] had spoke on last week
[44:42] we begin to speak upon the the
[44:45] conditioning or the resulting condition
[44:47] or the
[44:48] condition the rapturing condition that
[44:50] the world would be in
[44:52] when we're looking for that rapture to
[44:54] take place
[44:55] amen and you know down through the ages
[44:57] there's been
[44:58] little spots of this and little things
[45:00] of that and
[45:01] you know a little situations that's
[45:03] arose you say oh that scripture of that
[45:05] scripture
[45:06] but you know friend we can't just take a
[45:08] scripture or we can't just even take a
[45:10] small block of scripture
[45:12] if we want to look at what the lord's
[45:14] doing we have to take the entirety of
[45:16] the word
[45:17] and re-examine the entirety of that word
[45:19] with what we see that's going on around
[45:21] us
[45:21] and knowing the time that we live and
[45:23] recognizing the prophet and the message
[45:25] has been sent to us in this day
[45:27] and what he told us what god told us
[45:29] through that message
[45:30] and through that tate uh that that
[45:32] ministry that tape
[45:34] that we can put on and listen to today
[45:36] and recognize
[45:37] the day that we're living and and i
[45:40] believe that we're living in the day of
[45:41] the coming of the lord
[45:43] i believe we're leaving living in the
[45:44] seas of the coming of the lord this is a
[45:46] time
[45:47] and season of a rapture and that rapture
[45:50] is what we've all been looking for that
[45:52] body changes what we've been attaining
[45:54] to and
[45:54] and trusting the lord for and as we see
[45:57] the things that's going on around us
[45:59] is becoming more and more blurred about
[46:02] what's going on in the world but it's
[46:03] becoming clearer and clearer about what
[46:05] god is doing in his bride
[46:07] and that's the main focus that we need
[46:09] to continue to have
[46:10] is what is god doing amongst us what is
[46:14] god doing when you hear the testimonies
[46:16] just three in one service of the few
[46:18] that we have here today
[46:20] of god moving in our midst and proving
[46:22] to us
[46:23] that his word is true and if we have
[46:25] faith and believe that god's going to
[46:27] manifest
[46:28] what he said he would do we've heard it
[46:30] today we've known that we've had it in
[46:32] our lives
[46:33] but just the three times i want you to
[46:35] understand the witness that is
[46:36] yes three is perfection amen and the
[46:39] witness that has been given
[46:41] just this week of those few people it's
[46:44] uh
[46:44] of us just as few people that are here
[46:46] of what god is doing and helping
[46:48] increase our faith and build our faith
[46:51] because it's going to take that kind of
[46:52] faith for a body change
[46:54] but now as we look at the condition
[46:56] that's going on in the world today
[46:58] the best word i can think of that would
[47:02] uh identify what's going on in the
[47:04] country in the world today
[47:06] would be the word lawlessness
[47:09] lawlessness is what rules the day
[47:11] lawlessness is what's going on
[47:14] uh in a place that we use the thing that
[47:16] i used to think was
[47:18] very uh uh very much about laws and
[47:22] rules
[47:22] and and standards and and people
[47:26] keeping what's theirs and taking care of
[47:28] what's theirs and
[47:29] respecting what's other people's and
[47:31] what belongs to other people
[47:33] but it's got to the place now that uh
[47:35] they
[47:36] they want to try to make sure they keep
[47:38] you shackled down by their own
[47:40] constrictions especially with the things
[47:42] that's going on in the disease world but
[47:45] they want to keep you conformed to that
[47:46] while everything else around is going on
[47:49] like a swirling vortex of lawlessness
[47:52] when everybody else is invading
[47:54] everybody else's everything
[47:56] they try to keep you bound down to say
[47:58] well if you want to be protected you
[47:59] want to keep
[48:00] everybody else protected you want to
[48:02] make sure that everybody's safe and all
[48:04] well you know the number one thing to do
[48:06] then is to get rid of the criminal
[48:09] yes lawlessness start obeying
[48:13] start fulfilling or or uh
[48:16] holding up to the laws making sure the
[48:19] laws are
[48:20] are actually held up to and if they're
[48:22] not being held up to then there needs to
[48:24] be a consequence
[48:26] friend there can be a law all day long
[48:28] but if there's no consequence to the law
[48:31] it is if though it doesn't exist right
[48:33] if nothing
[48:34] happens when someone breaks the law if
[48:37] nothing
[48:37] happens to that person more times than
[48:40] not unless they get christ in their life
[48:42] they're going to continue their lawless
[48:43] ways and that's what's going on today
[48:46] lawlessness everywhere is even got to
[48:48] the place
[48:50] that the law of biology is becoming
[48:52] blurred
[48:53] so much that there's actually medical
[48:56] professions out there that say
[48:58] that there's men women and there's men
[49:01] and women and there's
[49:02] those that are in between or uh there's
[49:06] uh they can choose to be a man or they
[49:08] can choose to be a woman
[49:10] i it's become to where it's not even
[49:13] politically correct
[49:14] to say man and woman anymore
[49:17] it's just a person it's just an
[49:20] individual
[49:21] it's like reducing humanity to a glob of
[49:24] meat
[49:25] and that's just like that's all you are
[49:27] just completely
[49:29] denying true real honest biology
[49:33] that god made a man and god made a woman
[49:36] right and every human that's been born
[49:38] ever since then
[49:40] has either been a male or a female right
[49:43] but it's got to the place you can't even
[49:45] say mother's day anymore
[49:47] it's birthing person day
[49:50] now to me you say well brother newton
[49:52] now what's that got to do with the law
[49:54] that's the law of nature
[49:57] that's lawlessness in the fact that it's
[49:59] divine
[50:00] the defined the very fact of the law of
[50:03] god
[50:04] from the very beginning god made a man
[50:07] and then he made it one
[50:08] even in the animal kingdom you've got a
[50:10] male
[50:11] a a cow and a female cow how do you
[50:14] think god
[50:15] reproduces after the fall uh how god
[50:18] has allows the properties of
[50:20] reproduction to bring forth more cows
[50:23] because there's a male and there's a
[50:25] female right
[50:27] they even this just struck me
[50:31] i showed my wife the other day they're
[50:34] now coming out with new emojis
[50:37] that show a man pregnant
[50:41] now of course it's an emoji it's not an
[50:43] actual human because that's
[50:45] biologically ridiculous but it's defying
[50:48] the laws of
[50:49] god defying the laws of nature
[50:53] the things that god had set forth just
[50:55] complete lawlessness
[50:56] it doesn't even exist oh you can be
[50:59] whatever you want
[51:00] no you can't right that's right you're a
[51:04] man or you're a woman
[51:05] biologically you're born that way your
[51:08] chromosomes
[51:10] tell you whether you're a man or woman
[51:11] you you got an
[51:13] x or you got a y it's one or the other
[51:16] but the lawlessness see i mean can you
[51:19] imagine
[51:20] a phone emoji now i saw this on a
[51:25] news thing i don't know if it's on my
[51:26] phone or your phone or not that you can
[51:28] actually do it
[51:29] but they're actually coming out with
[51:30] those of an emoji you can use on your
[51:32] phone that shows a man
[51:34] pregnant on such filth
[51:37] lawlessness lawlessness rules today
[51:42] and that's where we're at let's go over
[51:44] to matthew chapter 24.
[51:52] i wanted to finish off today with
[51:56] a certain segment that i've been wanting
[51:57] to talk about since i started this
[52:00] rapture but it seems like every week the
[52:01] lord has had something else come up and
[52:03] i thought well
[52:04] i'll bring that in when i finish this
[52:06] today and then the lord just filled it
[52:08] up so much yesterday
[52:09] so i'll just have to be next week so
[52:12] we'll
[52:13] see what the lord does with it about
[52:14] next week but matthew chapter 24
[52:17] i don't want to tell you because uh um
[52:22] well i've mentioned it before you know
[52:23] it's not a secret but matthew 24
[52:26] let's start with verse one i i'm looking
[52:29] at a specific part of this and i was
[52:30] going to begin later
[52:32] down in 24 but i want to start with the
[52:34] first verse
[52:35] matthew 24 verse 1.
[52:41] talking about the end of the world
[52:43] talking about the end times
[52:45] talking about rapture time into the age
[52:48] and jesus went out and departed from the
[52:50] temple and his disciples came to him for
[52:52] to show him the building of the temple
[52:54] jesus said unto them see ye not all
[52:57] these things
[52:58] verily i say unto you there shall not be
[53:00] left here one stone upon another that
[53:02] shall not be thrown down
[53:03] and it happened didn't it amen
[53:07] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[53:08] the disciples came unto him privately
[53:10] saying
[53:11] tell us when shall these things be
[53:14] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[53:17] and of the end of the world says three
[53:19] questions
[53:19] you all know we've gone through this
[53:21] before but three questions the disciples
[53:23] ask him there
[53:24] tell us when these things shall be what
[53:27] shall be the sign of thy coming
[53:29] question number two and of the end of
[53:31] the world so we're talking about the
[53:33] sign of his coming which is where we're
[53:34] at question number two basically is what
[53:36] we're talking about
[53:37] the sign of his coming which is the sign
[53:40] the things we're talking about the
[53:42] condition of the world and the signs
[53:44] that were
[53:45] that we see that's going on around us
[53:46] the sign of thy coming
[53:48] and of the end of the world and the end
[53:50] of the world amen
[53:51] the end of the world as in the
[53:53] annihilation of the world order
[53:56] the burning over of this planet that we
[53:58] live on because we know that even when
[54:00] it ends
[54:00] that we're going to come and live here
[54:02] for a thousand years in the millennium
[54:04] on this earth right here right it's just
[54:06] going to be in a different condition a
[54:08] glorified
[54:09] cleansed condition amen
[54:12] and and of the end of the world and
[54:13] jesus answered and said unto them
[54:17] take heed that no man deceive you oddly
[54:19] that that's the first thing that jesus
[54:21] would say
[54:22] after there are three questions after
[54:24] the three questions was
[54:26] the first thing he said take heed that
[54:28] no man deceive you
[54:30] that's the first thing amen for many
[54:33] shall come in my name saying i am christ
[54:36] and shall deceive many now christ is
[54:38] just anointed
[54:40] right so what it's basically saying is
[54:42] many shall come in my name
[54:44] saying i'm an i am anointed i have an
[54:47] anointing i am
[54:48] an anointed of the lord right right so
[54:51] that's what christ
[54:52] is jesus is his name christ is anointing
[54:56] so he's the lord jesus christ okay he's
[54:59] lord father
[55:00] christ the anointing is the holy spirit
[55:03] so many who come to my name saying
[55:05] i am christ i got the anointing follow
[55:07] me
[55:08] see but that is going to deceive many
[55:11] now who will it not deceive it will not
[55:13] deceive those who have the holy spirit
[55:15] those who are born again
[55:17] cannot be deceived because they've
[55:19] become the word
[55:20] everyone else can be will be deceived
[55:24] and that's why you see so much of it
[55:27] going on
[55:28] and you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[55:30] wars see that you be not
[55:32] troubled for all these things must come
[55:35] to pass but the end is not yet so we
[55:37] said well brother newton has always been
[55:39] wars and rumors of wars have been
[55:40] fighting and
[55:41] i mean in the garden of eden caleb
[55:47] kane killed abel
[55:51] that's a an act of war it's not
[55:53] necessarily a war but it's an act of war
[55:56] can't kill a gable so he said well
[55:57] that's been the beginning well see
[55:59] notice here
[56:00] because a lot of people look at this and
[56:02] say well this is happening
[56:03] yeah but what else is happening what are
[56:05] the other uh
[56:06] uh indications the other signs that
[56:10] we're looking at
[56:10] well this is one of them but now jesus
[56:13] said but the end is not yet
[56:16] for nations shall rise against nation
[56:18] kingdom against kingdom
[56:19] and there shall be famines and
[56:21] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[56:23] places
[56:24] all these are the beginning of sorrows
[56:27] yes
[56:28] that's just the beginning then shall
[56:31] they deliver you
[56:32] up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[56:35] and ye shall be hated of all nations for
[56:37] my name's sake
[56:39] and that's the reason i see there's a
[56:41] lot of people out there say oh they hate
[56:42] me but why yeah
[56:44] see there's a people that's going to be
[56:46] hated for the for
[56:47] christ but there's others that are hated
[56:50] just because of their personality
[56:52] oh and they hate me because i'm a
[56:54] christian no they hate you because
[56:55] you're mean and ugly
[56:58] and that happens too many times a
[57:00] person's personality
[57:02] drives people away and people dislike
[57:04] them because of that reason now oh they
[57:05] persecute because of jesus no you need
[57:07] to be nicer
[57:09] you need to be a sweeter person you need
[57:10] to be more cordial and more inviting and
[57:13] and and and more loving to people
[57:16] sometimes
[57:17] and that's just that's a general
[57:19] conception i'm not talking about us here
[57:21] i'm just saying generally of course if
[57:22] the shoe fits wear it
[57:23] right if you are that way don't be that
[57:25] way amen
[57:26] but a lot of times people say oh they
[57:28] hate because of jesus no they they hate
[57:30] you because you're not a nice person
[57:32] a lot of times that happens but there is
[57:35] that group
[57:36] now those people that that they will be
[57:39] hated they will be despised they will be
[57:41] made fun of
[57:42] that's where the scoffers come from
[57:44] friend the scoffers come from those
[57:46] people that despise you and hate you
[57:48] because you do display and manifest uh
[57:51] jesus christ and they don't like it now
[57:54] a lot of times they don't like it
[57:55] because it condemns them
[57:57] a lot of times they don't like it maybe
[57:59] either other professing christians
[58:01] because they can't replicate what you
[58:03] have
[58:04] because they're not born again and if
[58:06] they're not born again
[58:08] they can't live the life that you live
[58:09] because you must jesus said
[58:11] you must be born again it's the only way
[58:13] to live that life the only way to be
[58:14] able to project that
[58:16] image and to be that kind of person is
[58:18] to be born again
[58:20] if you're not born again you can't do it
[58:21] and other people despise you because you
[58:23] do it oh you're just a goody goody
[58:26] oh you're you're just old-fashioned or
[58:28] you're just a holy roller whatever name
[58:30] or whatever
[58:31] thing they want to tag on us they tell
[58:33] you those things you know
[58:34] but the truth of it is they despise you
[58:37] because you're a godly person and
[58:38] they're not
[58:40] right maybe they hate you because
[58:43] they are condemned by your presence
[58:47] maybe they hate you again because they
[58:49] can't have what you've got
[58:51] they can't live that way there's a lot
[58:53] of people come and say
[58:54] oh i i i see that message but i can't
[58:58] live that way
[58:59] we'll get bored again and you will get
[59:02] the holy ghost and you will live
[59:05] because if you're born again you don't
[59:07] have any other way or reason or
[59:08] point or want to live any other way
[59:12] if you're born again you don't want to
[59:13] live any other way
[59:16] much less i can't live it and you can't
[59:18] live it because you're not bored again
[59:20] right i mean that's that's i hate to be
[59:22] so blunt for him but it seems like that
[59:24] the bluntness is
[59:26] it was kind of blunt last week too but i
[59:28] i just have to say what god puts on my
[59:30] heart
[59:31] you can look this ain't in my notes so
[59:34] that's just what the lord gives to me
[59:35] but that's just the truth yes
[59:37] amen that's the bottom line fact a lot
[59:40] of times that's the situation
[59:42] they will hate you but now
[59:45] verse 10 this is a point i want to get
[59:47] to
[59:49] and then shall many be offended let's
[59:52] just read through this and i'll go back
[59:55] and then shall many be offended and
[59:57] shall betray one another and shall hate
[59:59] one another
[1:00:00] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[1:00:03] deceive many
[1:00:04] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:00:06] love of many shall wax cold
[1:00:09] now we've got an abundance of iniquity
[1:00:12] correct that's what he said right
[1:00:15] because the iniquity shall abound
[1:00:17] so that brings an abundance of iniquity
[1:00:20] well what is iniquity
[1:00:22] iniquity if you look in this in the the
[1:00:26] definition iniquity is lawlessness right
[1:00:29] uh brother random says it two different
[1:00:31] ways he says lawlessness
[1:00:34] uh he said iniquity is doing something
[1:00:36] you know you should not
[1:00:37] do right that's iniquity but he also
[1:00:41] says iniquity
[1:00:42] is not doing something you know you
[1:00:44] should do
[1:00:45] right now so it's from both directions
[1:00:48] which basically
[1:00:49] the bottom line is it's lawlessness
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:52] lawlessness lawlessness or iniquity
[1:00:56] i looked up iniquity again and and there
[1:00:59] is a phrase in there that struck me this
[1:01:01] time that i guess i just hadn't seen it
[1:01:03] before
[1:01:04] but there's a part of that definition
[1:01:06] that actually says iniquity is a
[1:01:08] contempt for the law
[1:01:11] someone that actually has a contempt for
[1:01:14] the law
[1:01:14] yeah oh you see the law breakers today
[1:01:17] you see them running out well
[1:01:18] sometimes they don't even walk out they
[1:01:20] just fill up a big huge bag full of
[1:01:22] clothes and whatever
[1:01:23] they just walk out the front door they'd
[1:01:25] steal it
[1:01:27] and nobody stops them somebody in
[1:01:30] california tried to stop somebody from
[1:01:31] stealing stuff in a rite aid they shot
[1:01:33] the man dead
[1:01:36] part-time security guard he didn't need
[1:01:38] to lose his life over a few
[1:01:40] aspirin but he did just because he tried
[1:01:43] to stop
[1:01:43] somebody from stealing stuff out of the
[1:01:45] store yeah
[1:01:46] but they'll just help they'll keep it
[1:01:49] all up throw it on the back and just
[1:01:50] walk out the door
[1:01:52] yeah lawlessness a contempt
[1:01:55] iniquity a contempt for the law that's
[1:01:58] that's the very nature of what
[1:02:01] of what lawlessness is is a contempt for
[1:02:04] the law
[1:02:06] well they don't obey the law because
[1:02:08] they have a contempt
[1:02:09] they they hate the law oh that you got
[1:02:12] no law you have anarchy
[1:02:14] people just live and do however they
[1:02:16] want yeah but
[1:02:17] kill you no repercussions steal
[1:02:19] everything you got no repercussion
[1:02:21] right and then what happens you don't
[1:02:23] have a civil society then
[1:02:25] it's just it's just a free for all amen
[1:02:28] there's no law iniquity abounding
[1:02:31] so we see iniquity abounding now again
[1:02:34] remember this is still in the context of
[1:02:38] jesus explaining to the disciples or
[1:02:40] trying to answer the questions
[1:02:43] what uh what uh when shall these things
[1:02:45] be what is the sign of thy coming and of
[1:02:48] the end of the world the sign of the
[1:02:49] coming
[1:02:50] see this is all in that same context so
[1:02:53] the abundance here the abounding of
[1:02:54] iniquity is going to be in the context
[1:02:57] of
[1:02:57] jesus describing to them of what it's
[1:02:59] going to be like when he returns
[1:03:02] and that's what we got that's what we're
[1:03:04] looking at another
[1:03:05] thing that we see abounding today
[1:03:08] is is that iniquity but now why did the
[1:03:11] iniquity get so abundant
[1:03:14] now i told you last week and i do
[1:03:16] believe this
[1:03:17] that iniquity and the lawlessness that's
[1:03:20] going on
[1:03:21] didn't begin in the government it didn't
[1:03:23] begin with the defund the police
[1:03:26] it didn't begin with the contempt for
[1:03:28] law enforcement or any of that
[1:03:30] and and everybody makes mistakes
[1:03:34] uh sometimes a mistake especially when
[1:03:37] you're in the
[1:03:38] in the capacity of being a police
[1:03:39] officer sometimes your mistake is
[1:03:42] is taking a life yeah sometimes when
[1:03:45] you're a
[1:03:46] judge you might make a mistake and send
[1:03:48] an innocent person to jail
[1:03:51] sometimes being a juror you might make a
[1:03:54] mistake and send an innocent person to
[1:03:56] jail
[1:03:57] so sometimes mistakes have
[1:04:00] more great consequences than just saying
[1:04:03] what am i going to have for dinner
[1:04:04] tonight
[1:04:05] and eating something bad and staying up
[1:04:07] all night as a result
[1:04:10] now you don't feel good but you didn't
[1:04:12] send an innocent person to jail
[1:04:14] you didn't put an innocent person in the
[1:04:16] grave amen
[1:04:17] so it it's within the context you
[1:04:20] understand what i'm saying
[1:04:21] it's got to be within that context right
[1:04:24] right so it didn't begin there
[1:04:27] the lawlessness did not begin in the
[1:04:28] government it didn't begin with a
[1:04:31] a president or or laws or
[1:04:34] legislation it didn't begin there
[1:04:37] i said this last week lawlessness and
[1:04:40] the contempt for it began behind the
[1:04:42] pulpit
[1:04:45] in the churches amongst people who say
[1:04:48] that they're christians
[1:04:50] and with pastors who have no business
[1:04:52] being behind the pulpit
[1:04:54] yeah that won't call a spade a spade and
[1:04:56] whites white and black's black
[1:04:58] a man's a man and a woman's a woman amen
[1:05:01] right
[1:05:01] they don't want to say that they don't
[1:05:03] want to tell the truth
[1:05:04] so when they became watered down what
[1:05:07] happened to society
[1:05:10] see we're not reformers friend
[1:05:13] we're we're here to preach the gospel
[1:05:17] god commissioned his children for
[1:05:21] one purpose and that was not to reform
[1:05:24] people
[1:05:25] not to build hospitals not to build
[1:05:27] police stations
[1:05:28] not to uh uh have restaurants he called
[1:05:32] us for one thing and that is to preach
[1:05:34] the word
[1:05:36] not just me every one of us yeah now all
[1:05:39] those social activities and things
[1:05:41] they're nice
[1:05:42] and they have their place we need to go
[1:05:44] to school learn to read and write
[1:05:47] uh add and subtract um
[1:05:50] i i don't want to learn how what a
[1:05:52] horrible wicked person i
[1:05:54] am uh but i do
[1:05:57] i would like to learn how to read or
[1:05:59] write or do math
[1:06:02] we need hospitals they're important
[1:06:04] right we need
[1:06:05] police officers they're important we
[1:06:07] need our government they're important
[1:06:09] they're a part of our democracy in this
[1:06:11] country the greatest country in the
[1:06:12] world my opinion
[1:06:14] but god didn't call us as christians to
[1:06:17] do that
[1:06:18] right our job is to preach the word amen
[1:06:21] everywhere you go
[1:06:22] everybody you meet if you can if you
[1:06:24] feel led to
[1:06:25] everywhere you go your let your life
[1:06:28] minister
[1:06:30] if your lips don't let your life
[1:06:32] minister
[1:06:33] that you're you're a christian you're a
[1:06:36] godly person
[1:06:37] you're born again you're filled with the
[1:06:39] holy spirit let that let that
[1:06:41] word minister but the lawlessness began
[1:06:44] in
[1:06:44] church it began behind the pulpit
[1:06:46] because god didn't
[1:06:47] look this is satan's eden
[1:06:51] yes satan and we'll get to this in a
[1:06:54] minute but
[1:06:55] satan is the god of this world
[1:06:58] millions worship him and don't even know
[1:07:01] it yes
[1:07:02] he said oh they got an upside down cross
[1:07:04] or a pentagram or
[1:07:06] a dead chicken or blood on the door
[1:07:08] whatever
[1:07:09] and they say all these things all this
[1:07:10] all satanism
[1:07:12] that's just something that's blatantly
[1:07:14] brought to you by
[1:07:15] as satanism right satanism is anything
[1:07:18] that doesn't worship the true living god
[1:07:20] almighty jesus christ
[1:07:22] amen amen anything outside
[1:07:25] is satanism yes and it is satan
[1:07:29] amen and he is the god of this world yes
[1:07:32] all the systems of this world and
[1:07:34] everything about it is of the devil
[1:07:36] amen you hear an ambulance one down the
[1:07:38] road
[1:07:39] they're going to go help somebody but it
[1:07:42] is
[1:07:42] of the devil right yes thank god for
[1:07:46] them i'm glad they're there
[1:07:48] how many times we need them yeah but
[1:07:51] it's not
[1:07:52] our world this is not our world
[1:07:57] we're soldiers and pilgrims here saints
[1:08:00] all this economy and everything about
[1:08:02] the world order is
[1:08:03] of the devil yeah amen all of it
[1:08:07] god never god never intended us to rely
[1:08:10] on the government to get a social
[1:08:12] security check at the end of the month
[1:08:15] god never called us to rely upon
[1:08:17] medicare
[1:08:18] medicaid to help our medical expenses so
[1:08:21] that we can take care of
[1:08:23] going to the doctor and things that was
[1:08:25] never supposed to be that way
[1:08:27] god never intended for there to be a uh
[1:08:34] a bunch of give away let's just say it
[1:08:36] that way from the government god
[1:08:37] we weren't intended to be taken care of
[1:08:39] by the government we were intended to be
[1:08:41] taken care of by god
[1:08:42] yes all these social activities were
[1:08:45] supposed to be and
[1:08:46] should be given out and regulated by
[1:08:49] god's people the church yes
[1:08:52] and in a perfect society it works that
[1:08:55] way
[1:08:55] but as the society as the pulpit weaken
[1:08:58] as the churches became
[1:09:00] faithless they began to move over and
[1:09:02] and relinquish their rights and
[1:09:04] responsibilities over into the hands of
[1:09:06] the government
[1:09:07] right now there's nothing wrong with
[1:09:09] getting a social security check
[1:09:10] nothing in the world wrong with good
[1:09:12] because you put your money into it you
[1:09:14] should get it back
[1:09:15] right amen one of the worst social
[1:09:18] well i thought it was one of the worst
[1:09:19] social programs we had
[1:09:21] thanks roosevelt but now i see
[1:09:25] medicare medicaid they say they want
[1:09:26] social medicine
[1:09:28] i'm sorry i'm just giving you what's on
[1:09:30] heart
[1:09:32] and and i know what it's like in canada
[1:09:34] with socialized medicine
[1:09:36] and now i hear the things that they're
[1:09:38] doing
[1:09:39] in hospitals now when i was a kid the
[1:09:42] things they're
[1:09:42] saying in the hospital now is just um
[1:09:44] unconceivable
[1:09:47] the things they're doing with sister
[1:09:48] julie's uh dad they've helped him a lot
[1:09:51] and he's coming along and he's doing
[1:09:52] much better and
[1:09:53] actually i think he should be going home
[1:09:56] i think the best medicine for that man
[1:09:58] right now is to go home and be with his
[1:09:59] family and sleep in his bed and eat his
[1:10:02] food that's my opinion but if she were
[1:10:05] to take him out of the hospital she
[1:10:07] would lose all of her medicare benefits
[1:10:12] so you basically trapped
[1:10:15] it wasn't intended to be that way saints
[1:10:18] it was intended for us to take care of
[1:10:20] ourselves
[1:10:21] right the poor the needy
[1:10:24] the it used to be the poor and the needy
[1:10:26] they didn't go to the steps of
[1:10:28] the capitol they didn't go to their
[1:10:31] mailboxes
[1:10:32] they didn't go to the mayor's office
[1:10:34] they went to the churches
[1:10:36] yeah because that's where the help was
[1:10:39] supposed to come from that's the way
[1:10:41] it's supposed to be god's children are
[1:10:43] supposed to take care of their own
[1:10:45] it just doesn't happen that way right
[1:10:47] because it became so weak and faithless
[1:10:50] now praise the lord he's he's operated
[1:10:53] or
[1:10:53] opened up a way that we as his children
[1:10:56] even though have the social benefits
[1:10:58] that come with living in this cosmos
[1:11:01] we ourselves are becoming blessed with
[1:11:03] what god does for us every day
[1:11:05] by faith and the testimonies that we
[1:11:07] heard today
[1:11:08] amen amen medicine
[1:11:11] cannot help a man
[1:11:14] who has a growth in his back and is
[1:11:17] expecting and believing it to be
[1:11:19] non-cancerous
[1:11:22] doctor can't do that right right all the
[1:11:24] doctor can treat as the result
[1:11:27] it's cancer all i know to do is take it
[1:11:29] out and give you chemo
[1:11:31] amen but when you rely upon god
[1:11:34] you can know that god will say there's
[1:11:36] nothing to that thing
[1:11:38] right amen it is not cancerous praise
[1:11:41] the lord
[1:11:42] amen who in the world can any government
[1:11:47] facility today come and tell you where
[1:11:50] your purse is
[1:11:51] where your card is where your tool is
[1:11:53] and put it exactly where you would find
[1:11:55] it
[1:11:56] in a place you looked a dozen times
[1:11:58] before and it was not there that's right
[1:12:00] how many times have we done that amen
[1:12:04] and that's and we've had it happen
[1:12:06] numerous times
[1:12:07] it's just god yes and the testimonies
[1:12:10] are
[1:12:11] are just powerful that's the way it's
[1:12:13] supposed to be
[1:12:14] that's the way it's supposed to operate
[1:12:16] amen and that's what god does for us
[1:12:20] lawlessness iniquity has taken over it's
[1:12:22] abounding
[1:12:24] the abundance of iniquity has caused the
[1:12:27] love of many
[1:12:28] to wax coal now it doesn't mean anything
[1:12:32] for people like i said last week
[1:12:34] i i i see news reports of an old lady
[1:12:36] walking through a bus station
[1:12:38] and three or four teenagers just attack
[1:12:40] her and beat her to a pole
[1:12:42] steal her walker and her credit card or
[1:12:44] whatever piece of money
[1:12:47] i see a woman walk down the street in
[1:12:49] new york city and some guys walking past
[1:12:51] her just
[1:12:52] punches her right in the face and knocks
[1:12:53] her flat

[1:13:07] bullets flying everywhere
[1:13:08] yeah amen people knives killing
[1:13:12] because the the love is wax cold right
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:16] you know and and the division that comes
[1:13:19] from it

[1:13:22] quick and may say
[1:13:23] more about this after service but i'm
[1:13:26] going to say something real quick
[1:13:28] and i want you to hear me and hear me
[1:13:29] loud if you're here and if you're on
[1:13:30] streaming
[1:13:31] this covet thing is of the devil

[1:13:38] have allowed it but it's of the devil
[1:13:40] right and
[1:13:43] every aspect of it
[1:13:46] has come and i gave you this warning a
[1:13:49] year ago
[1:13:50] when we were still on country club
[1:13:53] every aspect of it is to try to tear you
[1:13:55] apart
[1:13:57] yes from the very beginning i told you
[1:14:00] that the devil was going to use this to
[1:14:02] try to divide us
[1:14:04] when the mass came along and everybody
[1:14:06] was divided in their corners mass no
[1:14:08] mass people
[1:14:09] i told you satan's going to try to use
[1:14:11] that to divide us
[1:14:14] now the vaccines are calm you got people
[1:14:16] that are vaccinated
[1:14:17] people that aren't and i told you that's
[1:14:20] what satan is going to try to do
[1:14:22] to divide us but friend i'm determined
[1:14:24] by the grace of god almighty
[1:14:26] that it is not going to do that here
[1:14:28] amen amen
[1:14:30] do not let that devil defeat you
[1:14:33] by dividing us and separating us and
[1:14:36] making us a powerless group
[1:14:38] right yes he's a liar
[1:14:42] the truth is not in him amen you do what
[1:14:45] you feel that to do with god
[1:14:47] yeah you get to shock they ain't nothing
[1:14:49] in the world wrong with that
[1:14:51] yes if you don't get it then fine it
[1:14:54] doesn't bother me a bit
[1:14:55] i don't have it and i don't plan to take
[1:14:58] it right but that's only because i just
[1:15:00] i don't feel to do it people do and
[1:15:02] that's fine i don't have a problem with
[1:15:04] that at all
[1:15:05] i love you with everything and and
[1:15:08] you're my brother my sister in the lord
[1:15:12] amen and that's all that matters amen
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:15] i trust you have the leading of the holy
[1:15:17] ghost in your life as i pray you trust i
[1:15:19] do
[1:15:20] and we'll continue on as a group and god
[1:15:22] and we're not going to let the devil
[1:15:23] defeat us with this and provide us with
[1:15:25] that's right
[1:15:26] amen i said it over a year ago i'm going
[1:15:28] to say it again today
[1:15:29] don't let it happen don't let the devil
[1:15:32] do it see
[1:15:33] that's the one thing that makes me
[1:15:34] believe that a lot all this is
[1:15:36] demonically controlled because of the
[1:15:38] spirits that come out of this thing yes
[1:15:40] you can recognize something if it's of
[1:15:42] god
[1:15:43] the type of spirits that are being
[1:15:44] manifested from this thing wouldn't be
[1:15:46] the way they are
[1:15:47] that's true it's only of the devil when
[1:15:49] it's when it's that kind of demonic
[1:15:51] spirit when people are out there saying
[1:15:53] that i wish everybody unvaccinated would
[1:15:55] die and get
[1:15:56] get away from us that is not a good
[1:15:58] spirit right amen
[1:16:00] amen when there's people out there that
[1:16:02] are well
[1:16:03] i i'm i'll go stop there don't let it
[1:16:06] divide us friend
[1:16:08] yeah amen amen don't let it defeat you
[1:16:11] praise the lord do you believe that the
[1:16:13] lord can can tell you brother john to do
[1:16:16] something and not tell brother
[1:16:17] dennis to do it that's correct yes i do
[1:16:21] i don't believe we're cookie cutter
[1:16:22] christians right amen
[1:16:24] i believe god can tell you to do one
[1:16:26] thing and tell me to do something else
[1:16:28] and god will protect us and be with us
[1:16:29] all right and then now what matters
[1:16:32] right amen but you see that hatred
[1:16:36] that's exactly what the devil's trying
[1:16:37] to do that's the spirit of the devil
[1:16:40] yes amen it's the spirit of the enemy
[1:16:43] but let's look how did it get that way
[1:16:46] that that'd be a question then how did
[1:16:48] it get to that point let's go back to
[1:16:49] the 10th verse
[1:16:51] that many shall be offended that's the
[1:16:54] first place it starts
[1:16:55] right somebody becomes offended they get
[1:16:58] the feelings hurt
[1:16:59] amen and oh my goodness don't we have a
[1:17:02] boatload of snowflakes in this country
[1:17:03] today
[1:17:04] they their feelings are on the tip of
[1:17:07] their nose
[1:17:08] and if you breathe on it the wrong way
[1:17:10] you offend them
[1:17:11] right they're so hurt so offended
[1:17:15] so torn apart
[1:17:18] it's just sad to know and to and to see
[1:17:21] this
[1:17:22] that's going on but people get offended
[1:17:24] so easy
[1:17:25] it is and it's something to guard
[1:17:27] yourself with
[1:17:29] if you've read my book you obviously
[1:17:31] know that whole scenario that i'm
[1:17:33] talking about
[1:17:34] but if that that offense is the first
[1:17:37] thing that comes
[1:17:39] getting a person's feeling hurt is the
[1:17:41] first
[1:17:42] point of separation that the devil will
[1:17:44] drive between two people
[1:17:46] or two groups of people that's true or
[1:17:48] whoever that offense
[1:17:49] will be the first wedge that'll try to
[1:17:51] separate you because as soon as you
[1:17:53] become offended
[1:17:54] then then you feel differently towards
[1:17:57] that person
[1:17:58] right and not in a good way
[1:18:01] and shall betray one another now offense
[1:18:03] leads to betrayal
[1:18:05] because a lot of times you get your
[1:18:07] feelings hurt somebody says something
[1:18:09] cross or something bad or somebody makes
[1:18:10] a mistake or
[1:18:11] somebody says something to somebody
[1:18:13] maybe the loose lips sink ships they
[1:18:14] shouldn't have
[1:18:16] and he shouldn't have said something and
[1:18:17] all of a sudden that person gets
[1:18:19] offended and most of the time
[1:18:21] that offended person is not going to go
[1:18:23] to that person to defend him and say
[1:18:24] look
[1:18:24] you offended me with that statement you
[1:18:27] offended i heard you said something
[1:18:29] about me and that offended me that hurt
[1:18:31] my feelings
[1:18:32] give the person a chance to recant and
[1:18:35] apologize
[1:18:37] and make it right but see the devil
[1:18:38] doesn't want you to do that right right
[1:18:40] so what's he doing he causes you as a
[1:18:42] human to take the path of least
[1:18:43] resistance which is what keep your mouth
[1:18:45] shut
[1:18:46] let your feelings all boil inside to the
[1:18:49] next
[1:18:49] available reliable uh uh source of
[1:18:53] ears to hear your complaint listens to
[1:18:56] you oh you should have heard what
[1:18:57] brother and brother so-and-so said about
[1:18:59] me
[1:18:59] right and all of a sudden you got
[1:19:01] somebody else who is a mutual friend
[1:19:03] now you've got them listening to the
[1:19:05] garbage that you have because you were
[1:19:07] offended
[1:19:08] amen and people get offended it's not
[1:19:09] the wrong being offended
[1:19:11] you shouldn't be but uh but but it
[1:19:14] happens
[1:19:14] yes but the worst thing to do is to go
[1:19:16] tell somebody else that you got offended
[1:19:18] by this person right
[1:19:20] and then of course there's you know
[1:19:22] nobody is a human we don't embellish
[1:19:24] anything do we
[1:19:25] we don't make this story bigger than it
[1:19:27] really was we don't do that
[1:19:31] of course that's the first thing we're
[1:19:32] probably going to do is embellish on
[1:19:34] oh they said so and then you add a few
[1:19:36] things and you know i was just thinking
[1:19:38] too that someone's on
[1:19:39] and then all of a sudden your
[1:19:40] imagination your thoughts and
[1:19:42] and then all of a sudden you've already
[1:19:44] made another enemy out of somebody who
[1:19:46] wasn't even offended this person 10
[1:19:47] minutes ago
[1:19:48] right and now what have you done
[1:19:52] you've betrayed your trust with that
[1:19:54] individual
[1:19:55] with somebody else and now that person
[1:19:58] goes to
[1:19:59] somebody else well eventually the person
[1:20:00] that was the original
[1:20:02] offender is going to hear about it and
[1:20:04] say well how dare he say that about me
[1:20:07] out there and then all of a sudden now
[1:20:08] what have you got you got a complete
[1:20:10] split
[1:20:12] people have been hurt offended now they
[1:20:14] betrayed one another and because they
[1:20:15] betrayed one another
[1:20:17] they begin to hate one another and
[1:20:20] that's a scripture
[1:20:21] events betrayal hatred that's the
[1:20:23] trifecta of satan
[1:20:25] to divide people to get offended then to
[1:20:28] betray one another
[1:20:29] so now all of a sudden you hate one
[1:20:31] another
[1:20:32] and you you separate and a lot of times
[1:20:35] you go and ask him say
[1:20:36] it's just like when me and my buddy when
[1:20:38] i was 10 12 years old
[1:20:39] we would have a knock down drag out beat
[1:20:42] each other to a pulp fight
[1:20:43] we'd get 15 minutes into it we'd get up
[1:20:46] and shake ourselves and said
[1:20:48] well what were you even fighting about
[1:20:50] right i don't remember
[1:20:51] let's go play basketball and that was
[1:20:54] the end of it all right yeah
[1:20:55] he just didn't even forget what what was
[1:20:57] it about i don't i don't know i don't
[1:20:58] remember
[1:20:59] you ask me well i don't know but i hate
[1:21:00] them but why do you hate them what do
[1:21:02] they do to you
[1:21:03] right well i guess nothing really but
[1:21:06] you what i heard
[1:21:08] that's the worst thing what i heard and
[1:21:11] you hear people and people say stuff all
[1:21:13] the time
[1:21:14] and it's just offensive it's hurtful it
[1:21:16] betrays trust and when trust gets
[1:21:18] betrayed then
[1:21:18] people start to hate one another and
[1:21:20] that's exactly what the that's the
[1:21:21] devil's stupid that's exactly what the
[1:21:24] devil wants to do
[1:21:25] to divide and separate god's children
[1:21:28] that's right
[1:21:28] i'm telling he's not gonna let we're not
[1:21:31] gonna let him do it amen
[1:21:32] amen amen we're not gonna let him do it
[1:21:36] then many offended betray hate and
[1:21:40] because everybody's hating one another
[1:21:42] then
[1:21:42] the lawlessness begins to abound the
[1:21:45] iniquity abounds
[1:21:47] because see the world out here and i
[1:21:49] hope this is no offense to you brother
[1:21:50] john
[1:21:51] but this world out here tells me i
[1:21:53] should hate him right
[1:21:54] and he should hate me and we should be
[1:21:57] at odds with each other just cause our
[1:21:59] skins different colors
[1:22:01] amen and then he should hate my wife
[1:22:04] because that
[1:22:04] she's a mexican sword brother dennis is
[1:22:07] lydia it's just normal whatever
[1:22:08] and we're all we're supposed to be all
[1:22:11] fighting each other
[1:22:12] right you know and hating each other
[1:22:16] because you know i've done nothing but
[1:22:18] oppressed people of color my whole life
[1:22:21] because i'm white so that's what i do
[1:22:23] it's nothing but to divide and separate
[1:22:27] it's out there to try to make you hate
[1:22:29] me me hate you
[1:22:30] you hate one another so that there's no
[1:22:33] love
[1:22:34] right there's no love of god and no love
[1:22:37] of humanity
[1:22:40] and you see it broadcast all over the
[1:22:42] world all over the country anyway
[1:22:45] newscasts all over the place
[1:22:47] disingenuous people that don't report
[1:22:49] the news anymore
[1:22:50] they just report their own propaganda in
[1:22:52] whatever way they want you to believe it
[1:22:53] yes and a lot of it is being driven all
[1:22:56] of it is being driven by the devil
[1:22:58] yeah to bring separation and hatred
[1:23:01] towards one another and a hatred towards
[1:23:04] humanity
[1:23:05] well friend if there's a hatred for
[1:23:07] humanity i don't think
[1:23:09] anything about taking stuff from you
[1:23:10] that doesn't belong to me
[1:23:12] i don't think anything about killing you
[1:23:14] or your children or
[1:23:15] or hurting you or knocking you out or or
[1:23:18] robbing you of your stuff
[1:23:19] it doesn't mean anything to me to walk
[1:23:21] in and take something that doesn't
[1:23:22] belong to me
[1:23:24] because i deserve it because
[1:23:28] i hate you you hate me
[1:23:32] iniquity lawlessness friend i am my life
[1:23:36] now i'm not saying it's never been like
[1:23:37] this before we've had it in the luvian
[1:23:39] world and the flood with noah but
[1:23:42] never been this way but in my life i've
[1:23:44] never seen it like it is today
[1:23:46] right never seen it the way it is today
[1:23:49] it's just amazing how satan and his
[1:23:52] eden has been able to take humanity
[1:23:55] and turn it into a a cesspool
[1:23:59] a cesspool of filth and that's the sad
[1:24:02] part of it
[1:24:03] but it's scriptural yeah it's supposed
[1:24:06] to be in the bible
[1:24:08] offense to betrayal the hatred
[1:24:12] the iniquity where the love grows cold
[1:24:16] and that that love is god's love yes
[1:24:19] grows cold
[1:24:21] yes well my friend you hardly ever see a
[1:24:24] filial human love for each other hardly
[1:24:26] anymore right
[1:24:27] much less a godly love they betray one
[1:24:30] another hate one ear
[1:24:31] and that's the the division the
[1:24:34] separation
[1:24:35] the the the hatred for humanity for
[1:24:39] the hatred for one another and you see
[1:24:41] the result
[1:24:42] and again it did not begin with uh uh
[1:24:47] the defunding the police or or a certain
[1:24:49] president or the government
[1:24:50] it began in the church yes
[1:24:54] weekless finalist ministers that won't
[1:24:57] preach the gospel
[1:24:58] and tell the people what god requires
[1:25:00] and expects
[1:25:02] to get people to an altar to a church
[1:25:05] but don't get them to jesus christ to
[1:25:08] not
[1:25:08] get them to a place that they become
[1:25:10] born again and filled with the holy
[1:25:12] ghost
[1:25:12] so that they leave behind just a simple
[1:25:15] thing of saying i'm a christian
[1:25:17] i go to church millions
[1:25:20] billions go to church right
[1:25:23] but not very many right are godly
[1:25:26] holy ghost-filled christians right
[1:25:30] that's scripture as well yes amen
[1:25:33] brother you not you don't know what
[1:25:34] you're talking about there's millions of
[1:25:35] words
[1:25:36] read the bible it tells you yes amen
[1:25:43] few they'll be that'll find this way
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:46] few that'll be and and as we get up to
[1:25:48] the end time
[1:25:50] the fewer it is yes you see it
[1:25:54] you see it the same as i do friend the
[1:25:56] lawlessness that's abounding
[1:25:58] going around denying god in his word
[1:26:01] denying the very principles
[1:26:03] that god built us as humans on
[1:26:06] denying the fact that there's
[1:26:09] to say to stay civil there's simple
[1:26:13] acts of obedience that we follow
[1:26:17] i i'm not gonna leave church today with
[1:26:19] a duffel bag and go down to the target
[1:26:21] and load up and walk out the door
[1:26:23] right you're not going to do that right
[1:26:26] but there's other people in
[1:26:27] other countries or other states other
[1:26:29] cities
[1:26:30] they are
[1:26:34] lawlessness and don't think anything
[1:26:36] about it
[1:26:38] let's continue on i'm not i'm not even
[1:26:41] going to get close to where i want to be
[1:26:43] today
[1:26:44] but let's go to 2nd thessalonians but i
[1:26:46] do want to read this scripture
[1:26:49] if i have any hope of
[1:26:52] continuing where i want to next week the
[1:26:54] lord willing
[1:26:55] and i do uh i want to get in contact
[1:26:58] with the brother i've mentioned
[1:26:59] to y'all before i want to have come and
[1:27:01] minister for us he was back in
[1:27:02] jeffersonville
[1:27:04] maybe he's back in tucson now i want to
[1:27:05] have him the next
[1:27:07] couple weeks or so as well
[1:27:10] so we'll see how that goes but have the
[1:27:12] lord lead i'll let you know
[1:27:14] however it turns out but let me read the
[1:27:16] god of this evil age
[1:27:18] as you're finding ii thessalonians
[1:27:19] chapter 2 what is it
[1:27:22] the world is heading to a climax
[1:27:25] now isn't that the truth there's a
[1:27:28] climax with the bride when she gets a
[1:27:30] body change goes in the rapture that's
[1:27:31] the climax for this world and the
[1:27:33] tribulation
[1:27:34] sets in and it all gets purified
[1:27:37] why the spirit of lawlessness notice how
[1:27:39] brother branham called it a
[1:27:41] spirit of lawlessness not just a
[1:27:43] physical act but an actual spirit
[1:27:46] of lawlessness moral decay scientific
[1:27:49] religion
[1:27:50] has led to the cage of every hateful and
[1:27:53] unclean bird as the bible says in
[1:27:56] revelation 18.
[1:27:59] he said what a warning now he reads
[1:28:01] revelation 18 but i'm not going to do
[1:28:03] that now i was going to read it at the
[1:28:04] end of this but we might not have time
[1:28:06] but lord willing will still somehow the
[1:28:09] cage of
[1:28:10] every hateful and unclean bird what a
[1:28:13] warning that
[1:28:14] throws the church exactly back to
[1:28:16] revelation 3 14
[1:28:18] to the laodicea age lawlessness
[1:28:22] real religious but lawless
[1:28:26] thou because thou sayest we have are
[1:28:28] rich and have need of nothing
[1:28:30] know us not that thou art naked
[1:28:32] miserable blind and know it not
[1:28:35] perfectly the scripture of this is
[1:28:37] perfectly the scripture of this
[1:28:39] age yes not for the scripture the age of
[1:28:42] daniel
[1:28:43] not for the ones the age of noah but in
[1:28:45] this last
[1:28:46] evil age amen the manifestation in this
[1:28:50] last evil age 2 thessalonians 2 1
[1:28:55] now we beseech you brother by the coming
[1:28:57] of our lord jesus christ and by our
[1:28:59] gathering together unto him
[1:29:01] that ye be not soon shaken in mind or
[1:29:03] troubled
[1:29:04] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[1:29:07] letter as from
[1:29:08] as from us as that the day of christ is
[1:29:11] at hand
[1:29:12] amen now look at this warning from
[1:29:16] from paul to thessalonica
[1:29:19] let no man deceive you by any means
[1:29:22] that sounds a little familiar didn't we
[1:29:25] just read that
[1:29:26] right now jesus just said that about the
[1:29:28] end time
[1:29:30] about the coming of the end in matthew
[1:29:33] 24
[1:29:35] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:29:38] that day shall not come except there
[1:29:40] come a falling away first and that
[1:29:43] that man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:29:45] perdition now we've seen that
[1:29:46] happen it's come in earnest it
[1:29:50] well it's come in great number maybe
[1:29:51] it'll come in earnest
[1:29:53] a little later i don't know but there is
[1:29:56] will be a falling away great you know
[1:29:59] what it says
[1:30:01] there shall come a falling away that for
[1:30:03] that day shall not come except there
[1:30:05] come a
[1:30:05] falling away first people leaving the
[1:30:09] truth
[1:30:09] people leaving the word people leaving
[1:30:11] this message
[1:30:14] denying it not believing it
[1:30:17] right saying all manner of thing against
[1:30:19] the prophet of course but
[1:30:21] we won't get into that but just leaving
[1:30:24] the word
[1:30:25] leaving the truth falling away
[1:30:28] well have you seen it as much as in this
[1:30:31] last day as it has the past
[1:30:33] since brother branham was gone does it
[1:30:36] say the last hundred years
[1:30:37] the falling away people leaving not
[1:30:40] leaving church
[1:30:42] not leaving uh going to uh their
[1:30:44] churches or even preaching but leaving
[1:30:47] the true revealed word yes right
[1:30:50] the people leaving by the hundreds
[1:30:52] thousands i don't know
[1:30:54] amen leaving it and they and they leave
[1:30:56] it on both sides
[1:30:58] they don't leave it just because they
[1:31:00] get away from it don't have anything to
[1:31:02] do with it
[1:31:03] they also leave it by going over and
[1:31:05] saying brother branham's god and
[1:31:06] baptizing in his name and all these
[1:31:08] other
[1:31:08] you leave the word both ways right right
[1:31:12] amen you fall away or go away from the
[1:31:15] word
[1:31:16] in either direction sometimes
[1:31:19] to combat the people that say brother
[1:31:21] branham was god they go so far the other
[1:31:24] way that they don't even want to speak
[1:31:25] his name
[1:31:26] yeah well not speak his name is like
[1:31:30] saying well i can't say peter or paul
[1:31:34] or phillip or nathanael or or any of the
[1:31:37] godly men in the bible or the prophets
[1:31:39] of the bible
[1:31:40] i can't even say paul anymore if i can't
[1:31:42] say brother branham you're right right
[1:31:45] amen that that's the way i feel
[1:31:48] am i so where does that put us that puts
[1:31:51] us in
[1:31:51] in it they either fall away one way or
[1:31:54] they fall away the other
[1:31:55] right but there won't be but a small
[1:31:57] group that stays with that true pure
[1:31:59] unadulterated word yeah
[1:32:01] amen amen that's this last day
[1:32:05] let no man deceive you because there's
[1:32:07] gonna come a falling away
[1:32:09] except there come uh
[1:32:12] a following way and that man of sin be
[1:32:15] revealed the son of perdition
[1:32:16] and we know that's what the message
[1:32:18] that's what the seals did
[1:32:20] right people said what was the seals for
[1:32:22] that's exactly what they did they
[1:32:24] revealed
[1:32:25] the enemy the greatest revelation of the
[1:32:28] scripture that
[1:32:29] exposed the enemy was when brother
[1:32:31] branham preached the seals the truth of
[1:32:33] the revelation of the seal
[1:32:34] yes he exposed them most people up to
[1:32:36] that time
[1:32:37] if not all christians believe that the
[1:32:39] horse rider on there in
[1:32:41] revelation 6 was jesus oh he's on a
[1:32:44] white horse it's got to be jesus
[1:32:46] even scofield has in his notes it's the
[1:32:49] purity has got to be jesus
[1:32:51] but it was the devil satan and
[1:32:54] that him being exposed so we know it's
[1:32:57] been revealed
[1:32:58] who opposes and exalted himself above
[1:33:01] all that is called god
[1:33:02] isaiah 14 or that is worship
[1:33:06] so that he as god amen
[1:33:10] he as god said in the temple of god
[1:33:12] showing himself that
[1:33:14] he is god this is satan's eating
[1:33:18] and satan is the ruler of this world yes
[1:33:22] satan is the god of this world
[1:33:26] let me read this because i'm going to
[1:33:28] have to close here
[1:33:30] god of this late evil age again notice
[1:33:32] how beautiful the scriptures tie
[1:33:34] themselves together in every age
[1:33:36] notice now when the church when the
[1:33:38] church world would not have the word of
[1:33:40] god to rule over them they accepted a
[1:33:42] murderer barabbas what did this do
[1:33:46] it exalted satan the god of this
[1:33:49] evil age to the place that he's always
[1:33:52] wanted
[1:33:53] again isaiah 14 tells us
[1:33:56] now listen for satan is not spoken as
[1:33:59] the god of
[1:34:00] any other age but this age
[1:34:06] this age he wasn't spoken of the god of
[1:34:09] noah's age
[1:34:10] he wasn't spoken of as the god of moses
[1:34:12] age he wasn't spoken of as the god of
[1:34:15] age of elijah but this evil age
[1:34:18] he said oh don't miss it he is the god
[1:34:22] of this evil age right worshiped
[1:34:26] by millions and billions of people
[1:34:32] worshipped by millions and
[1:34:35] billions of people and they don't even
[1:34:39] know it
[1:34:40] right but let's let the scripture
[1:34:43] uncover him this morning and let's see
[1:34:45] what we'll find from it know of it the
[1:34:48] god of this age
[1:34:50] it's the devil so the combating that we
[1:34:54] have
[1:34:54] is against that wickedness in
[1:34:57] high places against the demonic spirits
[1:35:01] that continue to infiltrate and hover
[1:35:04] around
[1:35:05] and try to do everything he can to get
[1:35:07] to the children of god
[1:35:10] you know my prayer i've told you what i
[1:35:12] pray for you saints
[1:35:14] that god will keep us hedged and
[1:35:16] protected that the angels of god that
[1:35:18] are encamped around about us
[1:35:20] would keep those flaming swords drawn
[1:35:23] ready for battle when any devil tries to
[1:35:25] penetrate past it
[1:35:27] yeah amen amen yes if that devil trump
[1:35:30] tries to come to get to you
[1:35:32] he's going to hit what brother brown
[1:35:34] said a billion million vote wire
[1:35:37] amen praise the lord that is feather
[1:35:40] singed
[1:35:42] when he tries to come and hit a child of
[1:35:44] god yes
[1:35:46] because god keeps you protected yes he
[1:35:48] does god keeps watch over his own
[1:35:50] yes amen if god let me say this
[1:35:54] i'm going to have to close here i'll
[1:35:55] have to pick it up next week
[1:35:58] if if if the lord allows
[1:36:02] and if there's something that comes well
[1:36:03] first of all you have to know you're a
[1:36:05] son or daughter of god
[1:36:07] right that's the first thing
[1:36:11] if you're a son or daughter of god and
[1:36:13] you've been born again and filled with
[1:36:15] the holy spirit
[1:36:16] then you are born with certain rights
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:20] and those rights are described here in
[1:36:22] god's holy word
[1:36:24] and you are entitled to every one of
[1:36:26] them yes
[1:36:28] and a part of that is god's watching
[1:36:30] over his own god
[1:36:32] protecting keeping you his children you
[1:36:35] must know that
[1:36:36] if you know that and you know god angels
[1:36:39] encamped around about you and you know
[1:36:41] that god's
[1:36:42] with you if something becomes you that
[1:36:45] is outside of what it should be then it
[1:36:48] it should be a time of self-examination
[1:36:51] yes
[1:36:52] i think right yeah lord why
[1:36:55] is this happening to me lord why do i
[1:36:59] feel this way lord why is my body
[1:37:02] going through this lord why is this
[1:37:05] taking
[1:37:06] place in my home or my family lord why
[1:37:09] when those things happen friend i
[1:37:11] believe it's a time of self-examination
[1:37:14] god why did you allow this a son of god
[1:37:18] to happen to me because there's going to
[1:37:20] be a reason
[1:37:22] if you're a son or daughter of god
[1:37:24] there's a reason why it's happening
[1:37:27] i think that's one of the best times to
[1:37:30] find a place and get along with god
[1:37:33] and talk to him and say lord did i
[1:37:35] offend you
[1:37:36] that i hurt you did i do something wrong
[1:37:38] did i offend somebody else
[1:37:41] lord is there someplace that i tripped
[1:37:43] up or messed up is there some
[1:37:45] something i did lord why has this come
[1:37:48] in my life
[1:37:49] right there's a reason why this is
[1:37:51] happening i lord i just want to know
[1:37:53] you just help me i'll make it right i'll
[1:37:55] do what i need to do lord i want to and
[1:37:57] maybe it's just for the fact that you
[1:37:59] can take that time to get with man
[1:38:01] maybe he didn't do anything wrong job
[1:38:04] didn't do anything wrong
[1:38:06] maybe you didn't say anything wrong
[1:38:08] maybe you didn't sin against him maybe
[1:38:09] he didn't sin against your brother
[1:38:12] maybe god just wants you to take that
[1:38:14] time to get along with him am i
[1:38:16] i remember a fairly well-known minister
[1:38:19] back east he's going to be with the lord
[1:38:21] now
[1:38:22] he preached for 20 years he fell on the
[1:38:24] tree hurt his back broke his back or
[1:38:26] heard it bad
[1:38:27] laid up in the hospital couldn't move
[1:38:31] and he testified afterwards he said i
[1:38:34] didn't really know god
[1:38:36] or this message until god put me flat on
[1:38:38] my back
[1:38:39] he said when god laid me out and laid up
[1:38:41] that hospital by myself all along
[1:38:44] laid on my back flat on my back hurting
[1:38:47] he said that's when i found god
[1:38:49] that really found god not just a you
[1:38:52] know an acquaintance of god
[1:38:54] but i really had a relationship he said
[1:38:56] that's where i found that's where i
[1:38:58] began to
[1:38:59] read and understand this message the
[1:39:01] lord reveal it to me
[1:39:02] it's when god had to they had to break
[1:39:04] my back to get me to see it
[1:39:09] if something is like that the maybe the
[1:39:12] lord's just trying to get your attention
[1:39:13] right maybe he only wants to get you
[1:39:17] to where you want to get on your knees
[1:39:20] along with him
[1:39:22] could be that's all it is but there's a
[1:39:24] reason for it
[1:39:26] and our responsibility lord what would
[1:39:28] be that reason
[1:39:29] amen what would be that reason
[1:39:33] the first thing that's going to come in
[1:39:35] a person's life is fear
[1:39:37] yeah and that's usually the thing that
[1:39:38] begins to grip people
[1:39:40] cause fear brother brahman said fear is
[1:39:42] one of the most
[1:39:43] powerful emotions it's like love love is
[1:39:47] love is the most powerful emotion when
[1:39:49] it's proper love
[1:39:51] but fear is one of the most demonic
[1:39:54] powerful spirits fear is that's why the
[1:39:57] devil uses it so much
[1:39:59] i brought this it came on my heart
[1:40:01] yesterday i found this
[1:40:05] brother branham wrote this book
[1:40:09] why do you think brother brown wrote
[1:40:10] this book
[1:40:13] because there were so many people scared
[1:40:15] of cancer right
[1:40:18] i mean doesn't that make common sense so
[1:40:21] many people were
[1:40:22] scared of cancer so many people came in
[1:40:24] the prayer lines
[1:40:26] fear scared of cancer that he actually
[1:40:29] wrote a book about it because of that
[1:40:34] that's my message today yes amen outside
[1:40:37] of
[1:40:38] the message hear the message
[1:40:43] don't fear say it there's absolutely
[1:40:45] nothing to fear
[1:40:46] amen god will take care of you yes amen
[1:40:49] god will watch over you
[1:40:51] god will bless you i know people have
[1:40:53] told me oh so-and-so believe that too
[1:40:55] i'm not responsible for someone's heart
[1:40:57] amen i'm responsible for me
[1:40:59] yes i'm responsible for what god puts on
[1:41:01] my heart to give to you and this came on
[1:41:03] my heart yesterday to give to you
[1:41:05] amen amen brother brown wrote a book
[1:41:08] because of it
[1:41:09] yes i don't think we need to i mean we
[1:41:11] could cross that out or
[1:41:13] take this cov id
[1:41:16] i don't know but don't fear yes that's
[1:41:19] the whole thing don't fear
[1:41:21] get the shot don't get shot that's up to
[1:41:23] you and the holy spirit doesn't matter
[1:41:24] just don't let the fear come in yes
[1:41:27] don't be afraid
[1:41:28] amen that's the worst thing that can
[1:41:30] happen because
[1:41:32] once that fear overwhelms you then
[1:41:34] satan's got you in his grip
[1:41:36] at least to that point he said well i'm
[1:41:38] a son of god i can't have oh yes he can
[1:41:42] amen it absolutely can if you allow him
[1:41:45] that little sliver to come in he
[1:41:47] absolutely will take advantage of it
[1:41:48] right yes
[1:41:49] amen praise the lord i'm going to
[1:41:51] continue this
[1:41:52] next week the lord willing we'll see but
[1:41:55] like i said i want to have that
[1:41:57] uh brother daniel evans come and
[1:41:58] minister for us i really enjoyed him at
[1:42:00] the minister's meeting and
[1:42:01] uh and what he had to say and i believe
[1:42:03] he's a man of god and maybe
[1:42:05] lord willing he had gone back to
[1:42:06] jeffersonville they're in the process of
[1:42:08] moving to two so i want to have him
[1:42:09] minister for us but let's stand if we
[1:42:10] could
[1:42:11] because i'm gonna i'm gonna end there
[1:42:15] for the day
[1:42:25] and maybe the next time then we come and
[1:42:30] we uh don't be here we'll meet over
[1:42:33] there
[1:42:33] yes amen praise the lord amen
[1:42:38] and you know me i'll probably still be
[1:42:40] preaching
[1:42:42] but only as the lord gives because
[1:42:44] that's that's all it is anyway because
[1:42:47] as you are as we all are we're only what
[1:42:49] god makes us
[1:42:51] can only be what god calls us to be amen
