[32:42] we might give us a little bit of filial

[36:41] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[36:43] pray amen
[36:45] revelation chapter 2.
[36:48] we're going to begin reading there now
[36:50] with verse 1
[36:52] chapter 2 verse 1
[36:55] and unto the angel of the church of
[36:57] ephesus right
[36:58] these things sayeth he that hold the
[37:00] seven stars in his right hand who
[37:02] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[37:04] candlesticks i know thy works and thy
[37:07] labor and thy patience and how thou
[37:09] canst not bear them which are evil
[37:12] thou has tried them which say they are
[37:14] apostles and are not and has found them
[37:17] liars since then for my name's sake
[37:20] has
[37:21] labored and has not fainted
[37:23] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[37:25] thee because thou has left by first love
[37:28] remember therefore from whence thou art
[37:30] fallen and repent and do the first works
[37:32] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[37:34] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[37:36] his place except thou repent
[37:39] but this thou hast that thou hate us the
[37:41] deeds of the nicolaitans which i also
[37:44] hate
[37:45] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[37:47] the spirit that overcometh will i give
[37:49] to eat of the tree of life which is in
[37:51] the midst of the paradise of god
[37:53] you could be seated
[37:55] now i'm i i felt
[37:58] um
[37:59] to take a subject tonight that i had
[38:01] taken at brother rogers when i was down
[38:03] there a few weeks ago
[38:06] and i titled it
[38:08] to conquer
[38:10] nicolaitanism
[38:12] to conquer
[38:13] nicolaitanism now i i realized that i
[38:17] the the irony of the title is not lost
[38:19] on me
[38:20] some because of the irony of
[38:23] the conquering nicolaitanism which in
[38:26] the word nicolaitan is the word nico
[38:29] which is to conquer
[38:31] so it seems a little backward but really
[38:34] when you dig into it it really isn't
[38:36] it's exactly what uh the true bride of
[38:39] christ is out to do
[38:41] exactly what the
[38:43] the the bride through his church age was
[38:45] called to do and of course the prophet
[38:47] of this last day was called to do was to
[38:50] crush and conquer nicolaitanism
[38:54] uh there are uh there's a few things in
[38:58] the bible that that god says he hates
[39:00] there's not many handful
[39:03] of things that god in the scripture that
[39:05] god says he hates
[39:07] nucleationism is the only thing i have
[39:09] found scripturally that god said twice
[39:13] he hates because he says that in verse 6
[39:16] and then he says it again in verse 15.
[39:18] amen two times god said he hates
[39:23] nicolaitanism so if if god said that he
[39:27] hates nicolaitanism or or the nicole
[39:29] action or the deeds of the nicholas and
[39:32] you know i think it uh it deserves a
[39:34] little examination to maybe find out why
[39:37] that that god hated nicoleton so much
[39:40] that twice
[39:41] even this entire bible you can count on
[39:44] one hand how many times god said he
[39:46] hates something
[39:47] that twice he said he hates
[39:49] nicolaitanism amen twice so so it
[39:53] behooves us to look and see why is it
[39:55] ism that god hates the most now we
[39:58] understand that that the word nicolaitan
[40:01] is to conquer the laity we understand
[40:03] that uh and and and that's not something
[40:07] that that i bring to you that you didn't
[40:08] know or this new to you probably i'm
[40:10] sure you uh knew that heard that and uh
[40:13] but the underlying
[40:16] causes in the underlying results of what
[40:19] nicolaitan represents i believe is what
[40:23] god hates the most
[40:24] because if you look here and you see at
[40:26] the church age so we'll just go through
[40:28] the church ages just a little bit just
[40:30] the first few here because uh that's
[40:32] where it begins in the ephesian church
[40:35] ace the ephesians was birthed forth as
[40:38] the perfect church
[40:39] it was the church that was born in the
[40:42] upper room where the 120 received the
[40:44] holy spirit all at one time they went
[40:47] out preaching the gospel and souls were
[40:49] added to the kingdom daily and three
[40:51] thousand that very day was added because
[40:53] of the ministry of peter so there's
[40:55] three thousand of them and of course the
[40:57] results of the
[40:58] others having the holy spirit there was
[41:01] uh
[41:02] it was that perfect church it was
[41:03] birthed forth it wrote a book of acts as
[41:05] it went along and
[41:07] and different souls were saved and
[41:10] people were healed and miracles were
[41:12] performed and we know what's in the book
[41:14] of acts so as ephesians was birthed
[41:16] forth as that perfect church is that
[41:19] church that of that member received the
[41:22] holy ghost all at one time
[41:24] went forth from that point and as it
[41:27] goes forth from that point remember as
[41:30] they go forth from that point each one
[41:32] of them wander out into satan's eden so
[41:35] of course at this world being satan's
[41:38] ears of jesus christ
[41:40] and that's the experience that brother
[41:42] branham exhorted us to have amen over
[41:45] and over again
[41:47] but the same thing exists today
[41:49] and people take advantage of that if
[41:52] they're not a god-called person they're
[41:54] absolutely
[41:55] one of the first things they're going to
[41:57] do is try to get people under them
[41:59] and by under i literally mean under not
[42:02] physically but spiritually under them
[42:05] where they can basically dictate and
[42:07] lord over and tell that person or people
[42:09] what to do and then those people fall
[42:12] into that because it's a
[42:15] you agree with me but it's
[42:17] nicolasism is an easy religion
[42:20] it's very easy
[42:22] because there's no responsibility
[42:24] attached to it there's no responsibility
[42:26] to the individual
[42:27] you ask them well you know about
[42:29] so-and-so i know what my pastor preaches
[42:33] well have you read this for one of my
[42:35] pastors read that for me well that's the
[42:37] same thing they said the catholic church
[42:38] was born oh we just do what the priest
[42:40] said of course then they didn't have the
[42:43] bible that they could read in their own
[42:44] language
[42:46] they didn't have a bible they could read
[42:48] they had no way to know what it said all
[42:50] they could do is rely upon their priest
[42:53] or their pope that's all they had but we
[42:56] have no excuse today friend
[42:58] we have the bible we have the message we
[43:01] have what has been sent to us to give to
[43:03] us for us to know that the leadership of
[43:06] the holy spirit is an individual basis
[43:10] for you as well as it is for me
[43:13] not you for me or me for you
[43:16] no it's for me
[43:18] and then it is for you
[43:22] amen not for my relationship i've said
[43:25] many times
[43:26] my relationship with jesus christ is
[43:28] just that
[43:30] my relationship with jesus and your
[43:33] relationship with him should not be
[43:35] between you brother branham and my
[43:38] relationship isn't between me my wife
[43:40] and god right see it that's it praise
[43:42] the lord and yours should be the same
[43:44] yours shouldn't be between me god and
[43:46] you amen no it's between you and him now
[43:50] god puts leadership in positions and
[43:53] places and churches things like that but
[43:55] leadership is not conquering a true
[43:58] leader will not conquer the people right
[44:01] he will simply lead right amen as one of
[44:04] them right that's all he does he leads
[44:07] as one of them doesn't conquer
[44:09] doesn't become above them doesn't become
[44:12] more important to them than them doesn't
[44:14] become
[44:16] and and i see it so many times
[44:20] uh my there's so many things i want to
[44:23] say but they get so personal i just i
[44:25] probably shouldn't say them but i've
[44:27] witnessed it so many times
[44:29] i've seen it and the tactics of it
[44:32] they're so sly and cunning
[44:35] just just like they came in jesus said
[44:37] you left your first love then that
[44:39] nicholas slid in there
[44:42] because they left their first love
[44:45] uh
[44:45] they they they entered into the next
[44:48] church age was wasmernia
[44:51] they went from ephesus to smyrna
[44:54] and brother branham said smyrnia was
[44:57] anointed for death
[45:00] and we're only talking about the second
[45:01] church age we're only talking about 300
[45:05] plus years after the death of christ
[45:08] after the day of pentecost basically
[45:10] give take a few days
[45:12] weeks whatever it is
[45:14] they were already anointed for death
[45:17] now we know that the root word of
[45:19] smyrnia is myrrh
[45:21] which is bitter
[45:23] uh
[45:24] which is and myrrh is something that was
[45:26] used as an embalming fluid to embalm the
[45:29] dead that's why
[45:30] they that one of the wise men the magi
[45:33] brought jesus murder
[45:34] it was an anointment of his death it was
[45:36] a representation of his death and that
[45:38] anointment that was that anointing or
[45:40] that an uh ointment that was there the
[45:43] myrrh was to represent his the
[45:45] bitterness of his death right because
[45:47] burr is bitter or uh myrrh is bitter
[45:51] and that smirnia had entered into a
[45:53] place of bitterness why because they
[45:55] left their first love look friend when
[45:58] when love has left you all you've got is
[46:00] bitter
[46:01] i don't care if you're a nominal bitter
[46:04] you're just uh
[46:06] uh angry
[46:07] uh resentful mean ugly bitter you're
[46:11] just just a bitter person people just
[46:13] become better that's why brother brandon
[46:14] said i don't want my life to be crowned
[46:16] with bitterness yeah because that's the
[46:19] way when you go through life and that
[46:21] love kind of fades away all when the
[46:23] love's gone there's nothing left of
[46:25] bitterness well the first church ephesus
[46:27] left their first love so what were they
[46:29] looking at
[46:31] a church full of bitterness
[46:33] church full of bitterness now that
[46:35] bitterness
[46:36] just made way for the third church age
[46:39] pergamus to come in
[46:41] and when pergamos come in
[46:43] the
[46:44] the nicolaitans let's go to the 15th
[46:46] verse such as jesus 2. god said in the
[46:49] 14th verse i have a few things against
[46:51] thee because thou has there them that
[46:53] hold the doctrine of balaam which did
[46:55] the same thing
[46:56] amen did the exact same thing who taught
[46:59] balak to cast a stumbling block before
[47:01] the children israel to eating sacrificed
[47:03] the idols to commit fornication
[47:06] he basically came out he couldn't curse
[47:08] him so he just said hey we're just all
[47:09] one why don't y'all just marry in why
[47:12] don't y'all just join in together with
[47:13] the moabitess and and all this
[47:15] heathenism and uh
[47:17] all this infidelity sure that's okay
[47:19] oh yeah we all belong together we're all
[47:21] one uh moab is simply lot who was uh
[47:26] abraham's nephew tended him to stay that
[47:28] way just like satan tries to do the
[47:30] exact same thing today because in
[47:33] conquering and trying to conquer the
[47:36] laity he tries to cause you to lose your
[47:39] identity
[47:41] you are
[47:43] if if he can
[47:45] lord over you conquer over you see
[47:49] the difference is jesus is our lord amen
[47:52] he lords over us because he's our lord
[47:55] but jesus does everything he can to get
[47:58] us to the place that we recognize who we
[48:01] are right in him that's right
[48:04] but
[48:04] satan does everything he can through the
[48:08] spirit of nicolaitanism
[48:10] to strip identity and who we really are
[48:14] and friend you can't have the right kind
[48:16] of faith that you need to have
[48:19] to walk through this daily life unless
[48:21] you know who you are
[48:23] if you don't realize who you are and
[48:25] where you are in christ you are no match
[48:28] for the devil right because it strips
[48:30] your faith yes how can you have faith
[48:32] how can you have faith in something with
[48:34] no foundation
[48:36] how can you have a foundation if you
[48:38] don't even know where you stand
[48:40] if you don't even know who you are
[48:43] you know one of the greatest
[48:45] one of the greatest of
[48:48] thefts of today
[48:51] one of the greatest thefts that go on in
[48:54] this world this country especially today
[48:57] identity theft
[48:59] stealing your identity
[49:01] that's just i'm talking naturally
[49:03] in the natural one of the greatest
[49:05] thefts that that thieves do
[49:08] i've said this many times uh
[49:12] stealing outside of the little petty
[49:14] stuff that you see in going and taking a
[49:16] thousand dollars of stuff out of the
[49:18] walgreens uh
[49:20] theft has become a white-collar crime
[49:22] yeah
[49:23] more than a blue-collar crime used to be
[49:25] theft was you walked in with a mask and
[49:27] a gun and you demanded money or
[49:30] something right going to a bank
[49:32] now they just punch a few buttons right
[49:35] hack a computer here or there or
[49:36] something and they try to take that
[49:38] money out of this system over here and
[49:40] put it into their system in cayman
[49:42] islands over here
[49:43] no guns no masks right that's the same
[49:46] thing
[49:47] the devil does the exact same thing
[49:49] today how do they steal your identity
[49:52] they don't come and rob your social
[49:54] security number from you and all your
[49:55] credit cards your all this and they
