prayer request to bring your attention the only one that I got today um the uh a text from Sister Julie she said their air conditioner is not been working right uh their apartment's been kind of hot uh the past couple of days they're supposed to come and work on it but uh they've been um almost without air it sounds like it's worked some but they're the average temperature of room their apartment's been like 80 degrees so U please remember to pray for them so they she's also having to work because were were they have to get work there's a lot of uh boxes and things that they have to move and things like that so uh just please remember them in prayer sister Julie asked for prayer for uh emotional mental physical Financial spiritual in every way so please remember them in prayer if you would or sister Krist and nie Maggie of course they all live together amen so please remember them in prayer if you would uh also I I don't normally do it I always forget but appreciate your prayers for me too and Sonia is going to be taking uh me and uh one of my work Partners up to uh Phoenix this afternoon so please remember us in prayer give us traveling mercies and don't get to Orlando till almost 1:00 am. in the morning so I'll get about maybe three hours sleep maybe so uh go to bed probably go to bed at maybe two get up at 5: so anyway appreciate your prayers for that Lord just uh rest a body in whatever time that we have amen I believe he can rest it as good in hours again in eight hours so I'm just trusting him for that so appreciate your prayers there uh that's only request that I had today so uh we certainly want to continue remember Sister Lydia sister Karen uh in prayer the Lord would just touch them and sister Pat Uh found out that they cancel sister Pat's surgery uh because the insurance company wants to make absolutely sure that rehab's not going to help her uh so it's just it's just sad how the insurance companies have gotten but anyway please remember her in prayer we know that the Lord's more than able to touch her heal her uh she won't have to have surgery so amen but remember them if you would in prayer the Lord just continues to touch the those physical needs and things that they've been going through amen sister Ken is still in the Care Facility so uh she's not at home yet so please remember her in prayer I know it's something that she really anybody does would want to go home sometimes it's not always advantageous for us to go home it's not to our benefit to go home but uh you know place like home amen so please remember her in prayer if you would uh sister lyy got her test back her CAT scans clean no cancer she's cancer free so praise the Lord but they still want her to take uh they downgraded uh the pills she was taking from 4 to two uh uh so we're glad of that and she is still taking lower dosage of treatments too so uh please just trust the Lord that that works out perfect and God just blesses her with that so amen anyone else you have unspoken request sorry my uh agency owner Sean she's going back to Chicago uh early early this morning for her mother's Memorial this and um some of you may know of a very popular position in town Dr rad um he's in the same area as Dr Cricket um but he he's a client of ours but also well phys plastic surgeon he they came home from England and their son was not

to our hearts today to watch and pray yes and you have spoke to Peter can you watch with me one hour and you know that's when you spoke those words the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak my and

praise the Lord amen wonderful I just love it when prayer requests become praise reports amen praise the Lord God is good go ahead brother D um I want to thank God for um turning our apartment complexes on there's better people now and it's a little more peaceful you've gotten all the rift raft out of there and it's a lot more comfortable it's gated now so it's been a blessing amen praise the Lord wonderful I want to thank the Lord last uh was it sunay Sunday night Monday night can't remember now that big storm came through and knocked over probably 15 Big Trees in our complex and it most the apartments were spared really I think all the apartments was SP just maybe one hit a little one of the walkways down hit some mailboxes crushed a couple of cars but everyone was safe and I'm thankful that uh we lost power for a few hours but it wasn't any worse than that so appreciate the lord always taking care of us and they uh year or so ago they chopped down one of the big trees right by our apartment and I didn't like it we love we like that tree it was nice good shape uh but I told my wife the other night I said well you never know why the Lord I mean he could have orchestrated those people to chop it down because that could have come crashed in on us the other night so you never know why things happen sometimes things happen the way we don't like them or things happen that we don't want to happen but God's always watching over us so we got to sometimes be careful of what we're critical of because it maybe the Lord orchestrating something to keep you safe so I'm thankful for that so praise the Lord for being good to us so amen let's stand to our feet if we could amen and we'll uh turn to the scripture we'll go to Isaiah chapter 54 Isaiah chapter 54 we'll just read one verse of scripture and I will be honest with you I was kind of influenced u i i I tried to dismiss it a couple of times uh just as something that had come in my mind but uh the Lord wouldn't let me do it and then yesterday when I come and sit down uh other scriptures came so I felt this was the will of the Lord but I was inspired uh by what happened last Saturday uh with uh a former president and and what had happened to him and the things that a lot of the things that seem to lead up to uh really keeping him safe that's the way I view it anyway so I guess different people view it different ways but that's the way I view it in fact uh he actually gave God thanks and gave God praise glory for saving him sparing him and I don't think I can't remember maybe it has in my lifetime any president giving glory to God for anything that I can remember anyway now I could be m mistaken and if I am you can tell me later but that's the first time I think I've ever even seen hardly a president elicit the name of God first of all but uh to acknowledge that he wouldn't even be here without God's the amazing grace of God I think is put or something like that anyway so uh I want to go Isaiah 54:17 so it's kind of inspiring to me uh because uh you can if you're a Christian you can see the hand of of God moving uh but we also make sure that we can see the hand of God moving in our lives yes amen and see how God Is Watching Over Us and keeping us and how many times and how many things and how many ways things could happen that God helps us with and prevents and takes care of us friends there's probably there's probably tens there's probably countless number of things that could happen to us that the Lord doesn't allow that we never even know about yes right that don't even ever you know the tree that's one thing that came to my mind but how many things like that the Lord does protecting us keeping us that we may not even know that it was the hand of the Lord orchestrating things in a different way to keep us safe yes and to keep us bless prosperous whatever it is so um Isaiah 54:17 I want to read just this one verse of scripture Isaiah 5417 very very familiar very popular scripture before we read it though can we just our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we are very thankful again lord of the grace that you give yes for the blessings and love that you show to us Lord and we're so appreciated Lord that we can know and have by faith that God your hand is upon us that you've blessed us you've helped us you've strengthened us along the way even through our frailties and our humanity and our mistakes and our ignorance Lord sometimes God you still everything that you do for us overrides every bit of that to keep us protected in your in your hands Lord in your protection we thank you Lord for blessing us again with another beautiful day for another service Lord to be here today God to worship and to praise you and God to give you thanks and praise for Lord without you none of this would be possible yes God I pray you bless these people those that have come today Lord those who may not have been able to make it those who may be streaming Lord may your hand of Mercy rest upon each one of us God we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is done and said here in this service and Lord I'm just so thankful of all the testimonies all the things that Lord that's spoken that we know that you do for us Lord but God it is given and orally that we can see your hand upon our lives and God we give you thanks and praise for it Lord so now we just pray God your your hand Lord would move on this service as you would see f God lord we are your instruments use us as you see fit and Lord give us that Grace Lord that we need for the remaining part of this service speak through these lips minister to our hearts our ears God and help us grow closer to you we just be careful to give you the thanks and praise for it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen one Ser one one scripture again Isaiah 54:17 says no weapon weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is in is of me sayeth the Lord you can be seated if you'd like and I wanted to speak on this is no weapon no weapon formed will prosper no weapon will prosper that was kind of the thought of the title that I wanted to bring but when I started looking at this scripture it really opened up to a whole lot more than just that if you actually break down to look at the scripture so many times uh it speaks of things in ways that uh many times we don't recognize or or understand or read thoroughly or read what it say uh I was be done on Earth absolutely but my my look at it is that when I when you break it down and you actually read what it's saying when he says in Earth I'm a part of that Earth that I want God's will to be done in not on I want his will to be done in this Earth because we are part of the earth our bodies come from the elements of the earth and I want his will to be done in earth as it has already been done in heaven as he has already seen it's already been in his mind before the foundation of the world God had that attribute of me who I was who I was to be come forth into this world to let his will that he's already seen be done in earth amen someone would say in the Earth or on the earth is the same thing not to me and if you go read the scripture exactly the way it says it really sometimes can open up things to you that you really didn't see before and when I read this scripture yesterday it it kind of exploded to me I just be honest with you it says no weapon that is formed against the against thee now notice what what Isaiah is saying here is that a weapon or weapons are being formed specifically against you right amen not just a weapon that's formed but it says no weapon formed against thee right so that weapon has your name on it that bomb that that uh uh whatever Satan's trying to devise against you has your name on it it is a signed for you but notice what it says that weapon that is formed against you personally and you know the devil has a I mean brother said he's got that punch coming right he's got that and he says he's entitled to that punch but that weapon that is formed specifically against you look now shall not Prosper praise the Lord now look a weapon a weapon is an instrument of War when when a when a weapon is formed against you personally that's a declaration of war that that weapon that has got your name on it that the devil has devised against you has your personal name on it has has been assigned for you specifically declaring war against you right amen I told you a couple weeks ago how I feel about that I told you exactly how I feel about the devil coming after me and I trust you feel same way devil tries to come after you he has nothing to do with me that devil has absolutely nothing to do with me has no control over me cannot do anything to me that God doesn't allow amen he has no right to me he has no rights to anything he has he has nothing on me he has nothing on you yes but there are weapons that are formed that they bring that are specifically tailored and detailed for you that's why that brother B talk Al about having that weak spot he says now he's got that punch coming and he's entitled to that punch and he knows exactly where your weakest point is that's why we are to try to keep that covered at all times right amen you know if a boxer goes into an arena that boxer studies his opponent for a long time yeah to find out his idioc secrecies and the way he operates and does he go right or does he go left or is he undercut or is he a jab guy what is what is his movements what is his tactics what does he do to try to get through just even maybe one single punch to to knock you out right and they'll study that and they'll make sure say well this guy comes into the right so the trainer is going to tell that guy he says now this guy comes into the right a lot make sure you keep that side covered right make sure you you do everything to make sure that now you want stay covered completely but that weak spot that weak point that you have to try to stay covered at all times because trust me friend the weapon he has formed against you and against you and against you against you is a different weapon that he has formed for me right and vice versa and all around is different because we're all different people we all have different situations life different weaknesses different weak points so every weapon that is formed is specifically formed for you to hit that spot that's what he's looking for the most and greatest vulnerability any good general of any War would want to try to make sure to hit the weakest spot that the opponent has so the other guy looks and says okay what is this guy when you're going when you're going on offense what is it that you want to that you want to do will an uppercut get him is he weaker on his right is he weaker on his left amen I know I did that backwards but that's because when you're punching from the right you're guarding with your left so anyway I just want to make sure say he doesn't know his left and his right yeah I do it's just when you're punching from the right you guard with your left so anyway so is he coming in and and which way can you get him which way can you attack him amen there's a midsection blow does that bend him over you know and try to figure the person out the the opponent out to know exactly where it looks friends that's exactly what the devil does yeah amen yes if not if but when he has his little minions out studying you he studies every part about you everything about you is studyed he knows exactly where you're weakest he knows exactly where your vulnerabilities are he knows exactly where to attack you sometimes win remember uh uh like I said I was kind of inspired by what happened uh Saturday a week ago uh I heard that this kid yes kid I I'm old enough now to call a 20-year-old kid this kid studied the place from what I hear now studied the place hid a weapon flew a drone over the location I mean this this kid did his homework yeah he knew he had had devised his plan to know when to do it where to do it how to do it and how he could possibly get the best opportunity to assassinate a president amen he had done his homework I give that to him smart guy from what I hear smart kid a very smart kid um uh very nice kid from what I hear but uh all that aside my point is he studied to make sure to get the best opportunity possible and look friend as a human that's one thing but look when we're fighting against principalities and spirits of the air that's a whole different ball game right that's a whole different situation to make sure that we know that we have every possible place that the devil could get to covered and taken care of and fortify fortify that place fortify it with prayer fortif it with with with discipline in your life fortify it with reading with with with h with listening to the word with every spiritual uh attribute you can Garner in your life make sure and keep that place covered don't let the devil get even just a wedge in there because all he has to do is get a wedge to open the door wide open that weapon now that's specifically for you it's got your name on it is is a declaration of war now if the devil is declaring war on you what are you going to do about it what is your reaction do we cower over in the corner and just beg the devil not to do we just lay down and just take it just just roll over just let the devil have the V what what are we going to do about it amen what do we do cuz we know the Bible says that this declaration of war that has G I can guarantee you every one of us here has a declaration of war with your name on it a weapon with your name on it the war has been declared trust me he's not just well the devil just doesn't look at you and say well uh they give their life to God they they they've been baptized they're a born again Christian so I guess I'll just leave them alone I nothing that's the last thing he's going to do right in fact you are the greater Target of anybody else amen anybody in the world you are the target you are the one she's looking to get to that weapon is an instrument of war is declaring war that weapon that is formed against you specifically you now look that weapon uh that is formed against thee oh I love this that weapon no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper so none of them no matter what which direction he comes from no matter what he tries no matter what weapon he puts your name on it cannot Prosper right it cannot come again now look the word Prosper means to succeed or to overtake you or overwhelm you so understand that weapon that is formed against you cannot overthrow you it cannot succeed against you it cannot overwhelm you because we know the we know the devices of the enemy and we have its answer and his name is Jesus Christ so no now notice this is this is even in this is in Isaiah this is the Old Testament right the the the the Bible the portion of the Bible that a lot of people I almost call them Christians but people want to throw away well the Old Testament that does that's the Old Testament that doesn't count anymore oh really okay then then I guess we just have to throw this whole thing out then so I guess the weapons that are formed against you will prosper them I mean it it just doesn't make any logical sense people just want to pick what they want to pick and take what they want to take and throw the rest away and then then that's their choice but I want to take it all amen what the promises of God are for me I want them and no weapon no weapon that is formed against you can overcome you can can overwhelm you can succeed over you no weapon formed against you shall prosper yeah and and the best part to me look now it says and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn is unrighteous of course but look what it says now it says this is I like that this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord this is their Heritage you know what a Heritage is it's an inheritance it's a possession it's your portion your inheritance is your heritage and this this no weapon formed against you shall prosper is our right as a Christian it is our right as a as he says as a servant of the Lord uh because Christ hadn't come yet but we look down and say as a Christian this is my Heritage this is my right this is my inheritance this is my possession God has given me to possess the fact that no weapon formed against me can prosper yes is my possession so what now what do we do about it amen at this point it doesn't matter what the devil throws against you it cannot Prosper it cannot overwhelm you it will not succeed against you whatever he throws why because we are walking with the Lord yes because our lives are HID in him am brother Adam said I want to be so hid in Christ that Satan can't even find me praise the Lord exactly that's where we should all want to be doesn't mean that that weapon won't be formed against you amen but it does mean that it cannot Prosper it's my right as a Christian amen my inheritance my my uh my possession my possession praise the Lord you understand it belongs to us let's go over to Deuteronomy no weapon shall prosper and like we talked about the other day with just a couple of the idios secrecies that saved the president's life the former president amen just just a matter of speaking to people looking forward would have died billboard a thing set up to to look at of a visual aid he turns his head to look at that that helped because it made a smaller Target but then when he moved his head just a little bit people can say what they want for him but I believe in God Amen I heard people this week say that it is unchristian to say that God is with you you what yeah I heard I've heard news commentators people that should have people that should never ever ever have a microphone in front of their face ever say that God saying that God is with you is unchristian I thought if there's ever anything that is Christian amen is saying that God is always with me amen they literally said that and and I don't know if they consider themselves a Christian they said they were raised Catholic I don't know but I thought how unchristian a statement that is we always say how and give glory to God how he's with us and protects us and watches over us but it shows you in in a microcosm if you will of of of the way some things are headed in this country and it's coming against more and more against the Christian Christian belief amen it is absolutely true that we believe as Christians that God is with us amen so however people look but it's like I said just the slightest the slightest Tilt at the very Nan the bullets being fired was the difference between an ear and an eye amen now again as a Christian you can't convince me God's not in control right you'll never convince me God's not in charge amen and understand that it doesn't matter how much pre-planning was done how well it was done how great it was orchestrated even by a 20-year-old kid how great it was how perfect it will seem to be and the whole situation scenario set up no weapon no weapon it doesn't matter how good the devil's done it homework work it doesn't matter how much Weaponry what kind of weapons it doesn't matter if that weapon is earmarked for the weakest spots you got in your life it canot Prosper it cannot succeed against you he cannot touch or take your life that's right amen amen what is there to be afraid of right amen there's nothing to fear when God is with us there's nothing to fear God is always with us amen refuting that very statement I will God Is With Us amen Deuteronomy chapter 31 let's start with verse one I was just going to read a couple of verses of scripture out of this but since we got a little bit more time Deuteronomy 31 let give a little bit more background as we go a little further ahead so verse one and Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel and he said unto them I am 120 years old this day I can no more go out and come in also the Lord has said unto me Thou shalt not go over this Jordan the Lord thy God he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and Joshua he shall go over before thee as the Lord ha said and the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sion and to OG Kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed and the Lord shall give them up before your face look at what God is doing shall give them up before your face that ye may do unto them according unto all the Commandments which I have commanded you amen now the promise is laid Moses give the promise I'm 120 I can't do this anymore plus God has said because of the smiting of the waters and all you will not go over but this is my people and my people will possess the land that I said they'll possess amen it don't matter the raming in the wilderness all the all that's done over new generations come forth um now is the time these are my people and I promised you to them to my people for Generations that they will possess this land and they're going to possess it Joshua the new general will now take you over into that land and cross over this Jordan to get into that land amen now this land God has G you I command it to you God has given you this land it belongs to you this is God's purpose and promise of your inheritance that this Belongs to You amen now it's time to go over and take it praise the Lord how I say that now now it's time to go over Saints we we've wandered in this Wilderness for how long we we we've preached this we've believed it we've heard it we've got had a Prophet come and gone it's been almost 60 years now where are we where where where has this bride gotten to today we've got new gener generation coming up one after the other you think well I was that New Generation I'm almost 60 now amen but look at the generations coming up what is there for them in this earth the way that it's going it's our promise God has given us that promise he said the Lord shall descend with a shout with the voice of the Archangel Trumpet Of God and the dead in Christ rise first and those that were alive remain will be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air amen where is that promise scoffers are out saying oh they've been saying that for years and years and years yeah they said it here too they red in the wilderness and roamed around but now it's come a time with The Changing of the Guard it's time to go over it's time for our possession now what do we do what do they do look at the ENC see it's already been told I I I am in this situation I am not going over Joshua is going to go over right he's going to lead you follow him and this land is the land that God promised you it's not something I promised you God gave you this land God's promised you this land God will be with you God will go before you God will even Smite all the enemies that try to come against you no weapon for formed against you will prosper now what do he said now what is he tell them sixth verse so be strong and of a good courage fear not amen fear not nor be afraid of them afraid of who they had enemies they were about to face but our battle is not that way anymore our battle is a spiritual battle yes amen do not be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee praise God he cannot fail he cannot forsake and he is always with us to take us over he will take us over into that Promised Land he gave them a promise hundreds of years before this he gave them that promise he told Abraham this is you're Are My People this is the land I've give it to you go get it amen hundreds of years where are we standing today this is this is God the quote the scripture I quote it is not my promise it's not brother Brown's promise this is God's promise God promised it to us now it's our time to be strong and of good courage and recognize that the Lord God is with us and cannot fail nor forsake us am did they go over and possess that land absolutely they possess it today how about us amen our promised land is the holy ghost that puts us in that place with him amen what about the victories that we have the victory that we have belongs to Jesus Christ amen amen because he it is that goeth before us what do we have to do be strong and of good courage yeah remember that God is with you no weapon formed against you personally can prosper cannot amen it might it might cause you to stumble a little might even cause you to fall but you know it won't stop you it won't overcome you it won't overtake you amen amen it won't overthrow you to where you just like a lot of people could I just I don't know how why God would do that I just I give up on him a lot of people do that no can't do it there's not a weapon form that can do that Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord has sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the Lord he it is that doth go before thee amen take this personally this morning I know I'm reading out of an Old Testament Deuteronomy but take this personally this morning and the Lord he is that doth go before you take that personally make that about you amen amen the Lord he is that goes before me the Lord he is the one of my protector he's the one that that that watches over us and protects us goes before us what is the one what is the one that goes before he's the one that clears the way he's the one that clears all the brush he's the one that clears all the enemy he's the one that clears all the obstacle he's the one that makes sure there's no landmines he's the one that make sure that everything is ready for you to continue to press forward to take the land he's already cleared it it's our time to take it now be strong and of a good Courage the Lord he ISAC doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed amen fear not Saints it's exactly the tactic that the government tries to use on the people of this country fear yeah scare tactics to try to conform you to what they want you to be and where they want you to go and how they want you to act but we are not to fear fear is not Faith fear defeats Faith but fear is dead When Faith exists you have faith to believe then the fear is gone you don't have to worry about it because you know what Jesus Christ has already done and said and given to you he's cleared the way no weapon form can Pro Prosper you are the one that is the Victor because he has made you more than a conqueror because he loves us gave his life for us I got one more scripture I want to read Ephesians chapter 6 God is with us he never leaves or forsakes us amen amen Ephesians chapter 6 praise the Lord Jesus Ephesians 6 let's start with verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord can we just close the Bibles and go home yeah amen dismiss be strong in the Lord praise God Amen that doesn't cause you to lift physical weights dumbbells car Bells nothing wrong with that doesn't cause you to do that no being strong in the Lord is a faith it's a faith based in your heart in your soul that rides over every other obstacle that Satan May throw in your way that the world may it's not fear there's no fear in faith amen finally my brethren be strong in the Lord amen that's a proc God help me I want to I I want to fulfill that scripture to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might so now it's not your might you're not fighting against with him on your own it's not your muscles it's not your intelligence it's not your uh goodness Badness it's God God's righteousness it's your inheritance that God has G you the power of his mind put on now it's our part now our part is to put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil put on the whole armor of God God give us the whole armor that we are to be able to take put on resist overcome amen amen so many times we lose our faith because we don't put on the whole armor of God or we feel that we fallen short on some part of that armor so somehow by not having what we feel would be adequate enough armor to put on we lose our faith our faith goes away because because at that point we start basing on ourselves yes the Bible says you put on the whole armor of God but we still do it in faith trusting God is there with us that's right amen for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principal against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places and we see it today greater than ever in my opinion wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and if that's not today I don't know when that day was and having done all to stand stand therefore when you've done all to stand stand praise the Lord I've done all to stand and you fall over you've done all to stand stand stand therefore having your loins gir about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness having your when we went over all these at one time we may have been back in cortero when we did all that and went over each part of this and the importance of all of it amen but we're just we read through it just read through it today your Lo gir about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith praise the Lord The Shield of Faith wherewith ye ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God all these lessons praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints staying in faith and believing this weapon this this armor the Lord has given us is to deflect defeat any Weaponry that can come against you no wonder the scripture says this is our inheritance no wonder the scripture says that there's no weapon formed against you that can prosper why you've got the whole armor of God on yes amen the whole armor of God if a part of it you don't feel as as strong as the other strengthen it they said well I'm not as strong in this area well then strengthen it don't use it as an excuse yeah a lot of times today people use a weakness they might have as an excuse for failure there is no excuse for failure if you're weak in an era you know you're weak strengthen it make it right get it better get it stronger that's the best thing to do the only way to overcome it is to be able to stop it amen make it right stand in the Lord with the promise of God's word and God's word will always as we stand in God's word God's word will always stand with you then what let me ask them what is it that we are afraid of what is it that we're scared of what is it that the what what instrument is it that the devil is able to use to defeat us he doesn't have anything he is a weaponless foe although he has the weapons he has but it can't Prosper so in our eyes we look and if it doesn't Prosper against you then uh then a a nuclear in the natural sense a nuclear bomb is nothing more than a PO Rock Amen because it can't it can't touch you anyway right amen he can explode it right on the Pinnacle your head have no no effect it won't do anything amen then then what is there to worry about what is there to fret over yes God's got it all under control God is taking care of us at every turn has God ever failed at any point because he can it's impossible we put all the whole armor of God yes Keeps Us protected Keeps Us shielded but we don't we don't fight this battle with our strength we fight it with his mind with his strength that weapon cannot that comes against you cannot Prosper yes amen I've heard several stories before too Saints of Brothers it's never happened to me but people Christians people I know that come up to situations dire situations I remember a brother one time um I don't remember all the details but he had a flat tire or something he was on the side of the road or he stopped to help somebody I can't remember what it was and the guy just came over and pointed a gun right in his face and pulled the trigger gun didn't go off wouldn't go off the guy tried it just wouldn't go off guy looks in the guy looks in the gun is full of bullets close it won't go off amen amen think about brother brandom brother br's going to take his life had a gun in his hand full of bullets put it to his head pulled the trigger wouldn't couldn't pull it with all the strength and might that he could muster up he could not pull the trigger on that gun he says God I can't even kill myself those gun across the room and it goes off but in his hand wouldn't go off amen reaches up to grab a power line voltage that would fry any anybody just knocked him out he woke up on the ground fine perfectly fine amen there's no weapon formed against you can prosper right amen God is with you praise Lord now not to say that happens to everybody but God watches after his own Saints and God does not allow anything to happen that's not according to his will for our lives We Trust him all things work together for our good because we love him amen and it works together for our good like we said before there's probably thousands of times that God is protecting us and watching over us and doesn't allow things to happen and we don't even know about no idea that this happened the way it happened because God was keeping something from happening to me never know it and then sometimes the things come up like we look at and say you know that that could have very may not know for sure but could have very well that could have been the hand of God yeah I believe it was the hand of God yes that Bas that's based on your faith some people look at that and say oh that's coincidence well first of all I don't believe in coincidence so that's out for me because there is no coincidence to me there's no luck there's no such thing as luck it's just take it out of the Webster dictionary doesn't exist there's no such thing as love no such thing as quenes God's in control of this God's in charge of this and when God is in charge and you believe God is there is no coincidence amen God's orchestrating the whole thing yes amen he may allow may not allow but it's up to him what he does yes praise the Lord but it's our faith to believe that he's in charge of us of everything that's going on of Our Lives it's time that we take our Promised Land it's time for us to G up our loins have the whole armor of God trust God in faith if we are as I believe we all believe we are on the precipice of going out of this place of leaving here don't see how we could stay here with it getting much worse than it is now yes then what does that say for us amen amen it falls my position Lord help me to fulfill the purpose that you put in my life as a part of that bride knowing that you're about to take us home to be with you about to go in a Rapture about to see our loved ones appear at any time amen amen remember no weapon formed against you can prosper yes amen I don't care if Satan's ear marked it for you I don't care if your name is is written all over it it cannot Prosper amen by faith we believe that amen let's stand if we could amen thankful that God give us the promise to understand there's nothing that can come against me that Satan can overcome me to Prevail against me Amen to overtake me to overthrow me to cause me to say I quit I give up no I love the Lord I believe I love him unconditionally so whatever comes goes I know that he works it all for my good and I believe him
