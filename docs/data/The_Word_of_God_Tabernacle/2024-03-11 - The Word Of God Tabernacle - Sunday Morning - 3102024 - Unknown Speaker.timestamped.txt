[24:11] hallelujah thank you Lord
[24:15] Jesus amen I want to read a few prayer
[24:18] requests to you this morning amen I
[24:21] didn't see me up there so uh just uh the
[24:24] few that I've gotten that we know about
[24:26] some that we know about haven't gotten
[24:28] anything else
[24:30] recently uh we obviously want to
[24:32] remember Sister Lydia sister Sheil in
[24:34] prayer uh they had their surgeries this
[24:36] past weeks they are both doing better
[24:39] both recuperating well sister Lydia has
[24:42] gotten her appetite back and eating
[24:44] again and feeling much better uh sister
[24:47] Sheilas of course was resting in home
[24:49] all week uh she's supposed to have her
[24:52] stitches out next week and just trust in
[24:54] the Lord that uh she's feeling good and
[24:56] believing that it's
[24:58] everything's healing well the way it's
[25:00] supposed to be they doctor got in there
[25:02] and found it had to go deeper than they
[25:03] anticipated but uh but believing that
[25:07] all was done all is well and that she's
[25:10] on the men and God's touching healing
[25:12] and healing is taking over amen praise
[25:16] the Lord so please remember Sister Lydia
[25:18] sheilia this morning we also remember
[25:20] Sister Karen her surgery is Thursday
[25:23] this Thursday the 14th so please
[25:25] remember her in prayer I know you have
[25:27] been
[25:28] but please continue to remember her in
[25:30] prayer I know she and I don't blame her
[25:32] probably would be a little apprehensive
[25:33] myself a little nervous uh brother
[25:36] Dennis has gone through similar
[25:37] procedure with the knee replacement this
[25:40] is a hip replacement but uh I imagine
[25:42] it's somewhat similar I would guess uh
[25:45] hers is probably maybe a little more a
[25:48] little newer uh as technology advances
[25:51] these surgeries get a little uh get a
[25:54] little different
[25:56] uh just like having a baby years ago
[25:59] when you had a baby you spent a whole
[26:01] week in a hospital now they barely keep
[26:03] you for a night uh if that unless
[26:06] there's some
[26:07] complication uh so they get you in and
[26:12] do their thing and get you out so which
[26:15] I don't mind so much U uh every one of
[26:18] you has been in hospitals I've never
[26:20] been a patient by the grace of God but
[26:23] uh we've all been there at least at some
[26:24] point in time and uh I don't know about
[26:27] you but the first first thing that
[26:28] happens to me when I walk in a hospital
[26:29] is man I want to get out of
[26:31] here I do not want to be in here uh and
[26:35] I know the P being a patient probably
[26:37] feels that much even that much more so
[26:40] um uh the I'm sure maybe the surgery has
[26:43] changed somewhat uh but just trusting
[26:45] she's supposed to have a sister Ken
[26:47] supposed to have an outstanding surgeon
[26:49] outstanding doctor or just trust in the
[26:52] Lord and of course she has the great
[26:54] position number
[26:55] one so just trus in the Lord to move on
[26:58] her bless and touch her too uh for the
[27:02] surgery this s please remember her in
[27:03] prayer also got a text from Brother
[27:05] Roger
[27:07] Friday uh that he was in bed all week
[27:10] sick burning up fever uh and brother
[27:13] Roger in bed he's disclosed to death
[27:18] brother Roger does not lay around uh so
[27:21] he must have been really really bad uh I
[27:24] texted him this morning though and he
[27:26] said he is feeling a little better he
[27:28] actually got out of bed yesterday uh I
[27:30] actually worked on a couple of toilets
[27:32] at their church that weren't working
[27:34] right uh so but he's still not 100% just
[27:39] trusting the Lord would touch him he
[27:41] actually text me Friday while I was in
[27:43] California asked if I could help take
[27:45] one or two of his services but uh I
[27:48] mentioned to you all last week about my
[27:50] right knee uh well Monday I did the the
[27:55] stainless so I'm up and down a ladder
[27:57] couple couple hundred times a day uh
[27:59] after Monday Tuesday Tuesday night my my
[28:02] right KN was like a softball it was just
[28:06] huge it's hurting it's hurting so bad
[28:09] right now but uh and and I think with
[28:12] all of my hobbling around it hasn't
[28:14] helped my left knee any either which was
[28:16] on the men and doing better uh so I do
[28:19] appreciate your prayers about that uh
[28:22] had a good week though outside of the
[28:24] excruciating pain uh I took proen a
[28:28] capalot to spr stuff nothing nothing
[28:31] helped the pain but uh I almost I I even
[28:35] text Brother Roger Friday I said well

[28:38] to have church I was hurting so bad uh
[28:41] but I worked all week I stood on my feet
[28:44] all week I had over 40,000 steps this
[28:47] week and that doesn't include the going
[28:49] up and down the ladder and stuff so I
[28:51] said if I can do if I can I can do this
[28:54] and the Lord will help you up here today
[28:57] with this this so I'm trusting him amen

[29:14] Wednesday afternoon I got evaluated and
[29:16] I and that was after hobbling around
[29:19] Wednesday and then Thursday and Friday I
[29:21] said I guess this review is not based on
[29:24] what's been going on lately he said he
[29:26] said Newton even crippled you're out
[29:28] working everybody else I said well I I
[29:32] don't know how cuz it hurts so bad but

[29:43] kind of enjoy doing that bending and
[29:45] getting it all in place and fitting in

[36:31] can find it because I I drive so far I
[36:34] don't want to drive without my license
[36:37] and I prayed and and our brother Newton
[36:40] prayed he knew about it and Leah says W
[36:43] you call the place that you were last so
[36:46] I was at a
[36:47] caretta and I called them and they says
[36:51] well describe we have a while to
[36:53] describe it and I says with dark t
[36:57] they says well tell me more said pull
[36:59] out the license it says Dennis G yeah
[37:02] come and pick it up so I picked it up
[37:05] and came right to church amen praise the
[37:08] Lord thankful for that God is mindful
[37:12] many times something like that would
[37:14] just disappear and never be seen again
[37:17] especially it seems like anymore today
[37:19] yes and well I got a little commical
[37:22] relief for you this morning uh somehow
[37:26] my
[37:27] phone daylight savings time got turned
[37:30] on so I was here an hour
[37:32] early an hour earlier than I normally am
[37:35] here I normally get here about nine
[37:38] o'clock and but the the funny part of it
[37:41] was not the getting up and getting ready
[37:43] and being here that wasn't any big deal
[37:45] but the whole time I was sitting there
[37:46] thinking it was 10:00 10:05 I'm sitting
[37:50] there and I'm reading my Bible and
[37:52] looking at the clock and it's 1010 and
[37:54] I'm like is it Sunday
[37:57] did I miss something did I enter an
[37:59] alternate Dimension or something
[38:01] nobody's here Dennis hasn't called Danny
[38:04] hasn't called I mean if they're not here
[38:07] at 10:00 and they haven't called the
[38:09] rapture's gone or something I'm thinking
[38:12] uh left behind I don't what I didn't
[38:15] know what was going on I got 20 minutes
[38:18] after 10 Oh I thought it was 20 minutes
[38:21] after 10 I got up sat like I always do
[38:24] right there I said well doing what I
[38:26] always do and for some reason it domed
[38:28] on me all of a sudden and I thought what
[38:31] if my phone is wrong and I looked up the
[38:34] clock and it was 9:20 not 10:20 oh my
[38:39] goodness I've been here this whole time
[38:42] thinking everybody had forsaken me or
[38:44] something nobody was coming to jerse
[38:46] today and nobody was letting me know
[38:48] they're not coming and finally thought
[38:51] oh my goodness I looked at my phone and
[38:53] Y it somehow the setting had got changed
[38:56] I don't know how it got changed so it
[38:59] switched daylight savings time and it
[39:01] was told me but I thought I said well
[39:03] I'm glad it's not
[39:04] fall if it was fall you guys would have
[39:07] been calling me where are
[39:09] you uh I wouldn't i' have been an hour
[39:12] late so anyway I'd rather be a little
[39:15] I'd rather be the early than the late
[39:17] part uh just the funny part of it was is
[39:20] just what was wondering what was going
[39:22] on it's 10 o00 and nobody was here 10:20
[39:24] nobody's here anyway thank the Lord amen

[46:00] Matthew 11 verse
[46:03] 25 amen kind of well not pick up where
[46:06] we left off we're kind of going to go a
[46:08] little bit of a different direction
[46:09] today but the same topic same subject if
[46:13] you
[46:17] [Music]
[46:20] will this will be God in Simplicity part
[46:23] two Bri vers the church part five
[46:27] amen God andity part 14 Bri versus
[46:31] Church part five amen let's look at uh
[46:35] let's start with again with Matthew
[46:37] 11:25 but before we do let's just bow
[46:39] our heads for another word of prayer
[46:41] amen Lord Jesus father God we're so very
[46:45] thankful Your Grace your mercy your love
[46:47] your blessings all that you give to us
[46:48] Lord every day we're So Unworthy Lord
[46:51] within ourselves God but it's not our
[46:53] worthiness that we look to anyway it's
[46:55] it's not our righteousness that we
[46:57] depend upon or lean upon lord it's yours
[47:00] it's you God and it's what you've done
[47:02] for us that we depend on that we look to
[47:04] that we trust in that we believe God
[47:07] today is still with us even right now
[47:09] this time lord and that's why one reason
[47:11] we come to this place church today
[47:14] trusting believing you to meet with us
[47:16] father and to speak to us from your word
[47:19] Lord the spirit that we feel and knowing
[47:21] god the pulsation of the Holy Ghost is
[47:24] sweeps through this place God oh that's
[47:26] such a wonderful thing to us Lord but
[47:29] God when that word comes and Lord that
[47:31] Revelation the spirit Lord brings that
[47:34] word life to us oh God it means more to
[47:36] us than life Lord Lord oh thank you God
[47:39] for that word thank you for the message
[47:41] thank you for truth thank you for your
[47:43] spirit Lord and thank you for Revelation
[47:45] to show to us in here Lord what you'd
[47:48] have us to see and know today God may it
[47:51] may you help us with it may it draw us
[47:53] closer to you more like you more in your
[47:55] image Lord because we're believing and
[47:57] trusting only in you we rebuke every
[48:00] demonic spirit that would try to hurt
[48:01] hinder and filtrate this service in any
[48:04] way that you get the glory honor and
[48:06] praise for all that is said and done
[48:08] father may you accomplish here Lord in
[48:10] this place today what you set this
[48:12] service forth before before the
[48:15] foundation of the world in your mind God
[48:17] the purpose that you had here for this
[48:19] today yield ourselves to you Lord and
[48:22] trusting that you'd speak to us and have
[48:24] your will and way in Jesus Jesus
[48:25] Christ's name amen amen amen Matthew
[48:29] 11:25 let's read
[48:31] here as we have every other time at the
[48:34] time at that time Jesus answered and
[48:36] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[48:39] Heaven and Earth because thou has hid
[48:41] these things from the wise and prudent
[48:44] and has revealed them unto bab amen you
[48:47] could be seated if you'd
[48:49] like amen I want to start delving some
[48:52] into Revelation we're getting over into
[48:54] revelation probably one of the greater
[48:57] which we have already hit on before in
[49:00] several
[49:02] Services probably the number one uh uh
[49:05] book of the scripture that that shows us
[49:09] the differentiation between the bride
[49:12] and the church amen the biggest thing
[49:15] that we see here the bride and the
[49:17] church as I said before probably the
[49:19] number one one of the things I would
[49:22] consider maybe the number one thing that
[49:25] varies
[49:26] makes a variance between the bride and
[49:28] the church is that the church goes
[49:29] through the tribulation the bride does
[49:31] not the church still needs uh a time of
[49:34] purging the bride does not the church
[49:37] still needs a time of cleansing the
[49:38] bride does not amen so the the
[49:41] difference between the church going
[49:43] through the ra going through the
[49:44] tribulation and the bride not amen but
[49:47] now I want to go over to Revelation
[49:48] chapter
[49:49] 17 amen and I don't and I don't want to
[49:52] feel like that I'm going to rush through
[49:55] this or or uh condense this in any way
[49:58] or anything like that but uh we just do
[50:01] the best we can Saints if I have to grab
[50:03] a chair you'll just have to excuse me uh
[50:06] but uh I I don't plan on doing that but
[50:09] just to let you know if that happens and
[50:11] you can understand but I want to start
[50:13] Revelation chapter
[50:15] one and uh and just start with the first
[50:18] verse uh and and and we can find in here
[50:22] exactly the the difference as well here
[50:25] between to between the bride and the
[50:26] church uh again let's start with the
[50:29] first verse and there came one of the
[50:31] Seven Angels the seven angels had the
[50:33] seven vials uh Angels which had the
[50:36] seven vials and talk with me saying unto
[50:39] me come hither I will show unto thee the
[50:43] Judgment of the great that Seth
[50:46] upon many Waters we know that of course
[50:49] is a denotation of female amen that sth
[50:53] upon many Waters people
[50:56] uh uh some of this becomes evident when
[51:00] you get to verse 10 11 through
[51:03] 18 uh some of the description of that
[51:06] becomes a little more real but if you
[51:08] know the scriptural uh types you
[51:11] understand that Waters uh
[51:14] multitudes glassy sea uh people
[51:18] multitudes amen so this great woman this
[51:21] great female that said It's oddly enough
[51:24] that this is the beginning of the of of
[51:27] women's month in this country uh that
[51:30] this message came up at this time was
[51:32] not planned just so that you know that
[51:35] um but U this woman great that
[51:38] Seth upon many Waters upon great
[51:41] multitudes of people with whom the kings
[51:44] of the Earth have committed
[51:46] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[51:49] Earth had been made drunk with the wine
[51:53] of her fornications they have been enti
[51:55] intoxicated with the stimulant of her
[51:59] illicit ways her doctrines her her
[52:04] dogmas uh these great Kings these
[52:07] inhabitants of the earth a great number
[52:10] of the inhabitants of the Earth have
[52:12] been made intoxicated have have taken
[52:15] into and drunken into the stimulation
[52:19] the wine the stimulation of her dogmas
[52:22] and because of this they've been made
[52:24] drunk upon or wearied outside of their
[52:29] normal comprehension wearied themselves
[52:32] Beyond normaly or beyond what truth
[52:36] would be because Dogma Doctrine Dogma is
[52:40] not is something that's man-made uh now
[52:43] obviously our we have a doctrine that we
[52:46] follow but a Dogma something that is a
[52:49] manmade something it's something that
[52:51] somebody came up with or or that they
[52:53] connived in a in a Seminary or something
[52:56] somewhere or in a
[52:58] denomination uh that that this woman
[53:01] this this woman is setting upon these
[53:03] people in other words by her fornication
[53:06] she has taken control over these people
[53:09] she has made them
[53:11] intoxicated they they partake in so much
[53:15] of her Dogma that they become bought
[53:18] into it uh shall I say they have become
[53:22] uh alcoholics right amen they become
[53:26] alcoholics they need they need to start
[53:29] or there already has been started they
[53:31] need to come to a different AA meeting
[53:35] amen and that is a gospel church a true
[53:39] gospel church that preaches the gospel
[53:41] of of Christ that preaches the true
[53:43] revealed word of the hour will
[53:45] absolutely help that person become uh uh
[53:48] get away from being a drunker or
[53:50] dependent upon the the the wine of that
[53:53] fornication amen
[53:55] uh they go to AA meetings all the time
[53:57] to get away from a physical alcohol they
[54:00] need to come to a church AA to get away
[54:02] from the spiritual alcohol uh the Dogma
[54:05] that this church is feeding them amen
[54:08] but they've all become drunk the drunk
[54:10] again outside of their own capacity see
[54:13] when a person gets drunk they lose their
[54:15] mental capacities right a little at a
[54:17] time but the more they intoxicate
[54:21] themselves the more they become involved
[54:23] and intoxicate themselves the more they
[54:26] take on the mark of the beast the more
[54:28] they become drunken the more they come
[54:31] outside of themselves it sort of goes
[54:33] back a little to what we talked about
[54:36] last week where I believe a lot of these
[54:38] people who look around and uh you see
[54:41] how the government's going and how the
[54:43] country is going and how people are
[54:44] going and and you wonder how could they
[54:46] be how would they and brother man would
[54:49] even make that statement he was talk
[54:50] about even a female say how could a
[54:53] regular normal thinking female walk walk
[54:55] out on the street without her skirt on
[54:57] Amen and we look at today and we say how
[54:59] could a normal thinking person think
[55:02] that that's okay right how would a
[55:04] normal thinking person think that we
[55:07] could put someone in the highest form of
[55:10] our government with absolute impunity
[55:13] they they can't this person cannot be
[55:15] fired the job they were appointed to is
[55:18] for
[55:19] life and doesn't even know what a woman
[55:22] is right she was a person was asked
[55:26] about to make this slip at her
[55:28] confirmation what a woman and she could
[55:30] not even give the definition of what a
[55:33] woman is now see we look at this and we
[55:35] say now how could a normal regular
[55:38] person think a thinking person think
[55:41] like that uh act like that why would
[55:46] they do these things why would they go
[55:48] out in public like that why would they
[55:51] talk like that and see but see you got
[55:53] to understand so many of they've been
[55:56] they've been drunken that they've been
[55:58] drunken off the fornication off the wine
[56:00] of the fornications of the spiritual
[56:04] fornication it's not a physical
[56:06] fornication it's a spiritual fornication
[56:09] it's a fornication it's a defiling of
[56:12] their
[56:13] spirituality with a Dogma with a church
[56:17] with a denomination that is outside God
[56:21] and His word right and they become drunk
[56:23] on it right now they've gotten to
[56:25] themselves to the place that they do
[56:26] things that are just simply
[56:28] unrecognizable or or or does or actually
[56:31] to me a lot of times is absolutely
[56:34] devoid of common sense right
[56:37] amen Common Sense doesn't even come into
[56:40] play anymore to the point that uh uh uh
[56:45] I think me and I think I was me and my
[56:47] wife me and Sonia went down to tun stone
[56:49] for one of our anniversaries and I was
[56:51] walking I think I may have even taken a
[56:52] picture of it but we went by and and you
[56:55] know they have all the novelty stuff
[56:56] they had these t-shirts that were made
[56:58] up and and uh one of the t-shirts said
[57:01] that I'm not going to say it exactly
[57:04] right but I'm going to paraphrase it
[57:05] based on what I've said many times
[57:08] Common Sense isn't so common
[57:11] anymore it doesn't seem to be anyway
[57:14] well a lot of people they lot people are
[57:16] just drunk they're intoxicated they're
[57:18] doing things and they think they're okay
[57:21] I believe a lot of times these people
[57:22] are doing things thinking that that's
[57:24] the right way to do it yeah right they
[57:27] actually literally believe that is the
[57:29] correct way of doing
[57:31] it I think a lot of people now let's
[57:33] bring it to the spiritual aspect I think
[57:36] a lot of people if they knew better they
[57:39] would not get baptized in titles of
[57:42] Father Son and Holy Ghost which you
[57:43] can't baptize in Father Son and Holy
[57:45] Ghost anyway because if you do that
[57:46] you're not even baptized but you don't
[57:48] understand the point right I don't
[57:49] believe they would get if they could see
[57:51] in the scripture but they've been so
[57:53] drunken off of this wine they they've
[57:57] been made to believe so long uh by the
[58:01] Distortion spiritually of God's word
[58:04] that they go into the water with a
[58:06] sincere I I give them the benefit of the
[58:09] doubt obviously I try to everybody I I
[58:11] hope everybody tries to do that with me
[58:13] so it's like Jesus said if you want
[58:15] Mercy give Mercy blessed are the
[58:17] merciful for they shall obtain mercy so
[58:19] if I'm going to expect to have mercy I
[58:21] want to give it I believe when people go
[58:23] into that water they literally are going
[58:25] in with a sincere heart they really want
[58:29] to show that they that they've accepted
[58:32] Jesus Christ as their savior as their
[58:36] Lord that they love and they go in there
[58:39] sincerely believing that that this is
[58:42] going to be what it takes to to be able
[58:44] to uh to make
[58:48] Heaven
[58:50] Unfortunately they just don't
[58:53] know um
[58:56] drunken denominations that will teach
[58:59] them and tell them that this is the way
[59:01] to do it this is so what Jesus said in
[59:04] Matthew 28 now how can you dispute with
[59:08] that and I believe people are sincere I
[59:11] believe they go in there sincerely
[59:13] believing that they are doing what is
[59:16] right but it's
[59:18] not amen and I believe that's uh it's I
[59:23] haven't God forgive me but I haven't
[59:25] been drunk probably since I was 19 years
[59:28] old but when you're outside of your mind
[59:32] uh the old Newton that's different now
[59:36] that the Dead Guy uh I got home one
[59:39] night don't even know how I got

[1:12:24] mystery
[1:12:25] to the name written
[1:12:28] mystery Babylon the

[1:12:38] well where do you think this Blasphemous
[1:12:40] names came from amen it started with
[1:12:43] them Catholic and it went from there
[1:12:48] right she had babies she had children
[1:12:52] and so those those names became
[1:12:55] Blasphemous names as they were derived
[1:12:59] from that original woman that rode that
[1:13:03] Scarlet colored
[1:13:05] Beast my
[1:13:07] mind she's a mother now so she has

[1:13:14] har uh harlots an Abominations of the
[1:13:18] earth it's the abomination of the earth
[1:13:21] people want to say that uh this person
[1:13:24] that person this entity that entity the
[1:13:27] Democrats say that about the Republicans
[1:13:28] in this country the Republicans say that
[1:13:30] about the Democrats in this country let
[1:13:31] me tell you who the Abomination is it's

[1:13:36] it is the
[1:13:37] devil that's the abom is the spiritual
[1:13:40] abom all this physical stuff going on
[1:13:42] that's just a blip on the radar we're
[1:13:44] talking about spiritual activity that is
[1:13:46] way more important that anything that
[1:13:48] you could see here or know in the
[1:13:50] Physical Realm amen that is the abom
[1:13:53] ination the Abomination is the spiritual
[1:13:56] aspect of it not the physical aspect of
[1:13:58] it behind closed doors this that they
[1:14:02] try that Satan tries to hide is the
[1:14:04] spiritual degradation that's going on
[1:14:07] the spiritual uh uh death that's
[1:14:10] happening through this fornication
[1:14:12] because remember God does not accept a
[1:14:15] harlot right he put his own people away
[1:14:17] for that Saints God put his own children
[1:14:21] away for that yeah he put away the Jew
[1:14:24] because of that because she Spirit she
[1:14:27] committed spiritual fornication now
[1:14:29] she's got to go now she has had and is
[1:14:32] going through this cleansing process to
[1:14:35] where eventually as we've said before
[1:14:37] there will be a finishing of that
[1:14:39] Abomination that's why God never does
[1:14:42] forget his people but they were blinded
[1:14:45] for a while so that the Gentile could
[1:14:47] see right amen now notice I I also just
[1:14:51] just as a little blurp here want you
[1:14:53] notice in the scripture she was
[1:14:56] according to the scripture she was
[1:14:57] blinded the Jew was blinded in Romans 11
[1:15:02] but she comes to receive sight through
[1:15:04] the two witnesses in in Revelation 11
[1:15:08] right amen Roman 11 took it away
[1:15:12] Revelation Revelation 11 brought it back
[1:15:16] wow praise the Lord amen but done that
[1:15:19] way so now God could graft Us in the
[1:15:22] Gentile bride
[1:15:23] that would believe praise the Lord now
[1:15:26] this Gentile bride is believing now the
[1:15:29] the the mother of Harless bom Ser now
[1:15:31] sixth
[1:15:32] verse and I saw the and I I haven't even
[1:15:35] got to where I wanted to go yet and I
[1:15:37] saw the woman drunken with the blood of
[1:15:40] the Saints
[1:15:42] drunken uh that is to take with excess
[1:15:46] to become
[1:15:48] intoxicated amen this this woman was
[1:15:52] intoxicated
[1:15:53] ated became excessive with the blood of
[1:15:58] the Saints blood of the Saints not not
[1:16:01] blood of the of the of the unbeliever
[1:16:04] let's just say blood of the Heathen
[1:16:06] blood of the Saints amen well they have
[1:16:09] in their own Catholic martyrology what
[1:16:12] was it 53 million that they claim murder
[1:16:15] during that uh the Dark Ages drunken no
[1:16:18] wonder she's
[1:16:21] drunken anybody I don't care how much of
[1:16:24] an alcoholic they are you go you you go
[1:16:28] drink what 100 kegs of beer whatever it
[1:16:32] is or uh however many fifths of liquor
[1:16:35] you're going to get
[1:16:37] drunk well this
[1:16:39] success of murdering people murdering
[1:16:42] one after the other murder murder murder
[1:16:45] murder I haven't even I should I hav
[1:16:47] have done that yet uh I still like math
[1:16:51] I always like math when I was a kid
[1:16:53] I wonder brother Pat you like math too
[1:16:57] uh let's figure I'm going to I'm going
[1:16:58] to look at the Dark Age period and see
[1:17:01] how many 53 million how many is that per
[1:17:04] day that they kill per day because the
[1:17:08] Dark Ages we have defined brother
[1:17:10] brandom gave it to us this period of
[1:17:11] time 53 million I wonder what that comes
[1:17:14] down to per day that they murdered I I
[1:17:17] bet you it's a large number amen let's
[1:17:20] don't do that right now but uh
[1:17:23] I bet it's a large number per day that
[1:17:26] they murder well no wonder they're drunk
[1:17:28] no wonder she's drunk with the blood of
[1:17:30] the Saints amen and with the blood of
[1:17:34] the martyrs of who
[1:17:36] Jesus amen Martyrs of
[1:17:39] Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with
[1:17:42] great admiration and the angel said unto
[1:17:44] me wherefore this thou marble I will
[1:17:47] tell thee The Mystery of the woman of
[1:17:48] the Beast that carried her which had the
[1:17:51] seven heads and 10 horns now now here we
[1:17:53] get to the Beast the Beast that thou saw
[1:17:55] us was and is not well we know that's
[1:17:58] the office of the pope now a lot of
[1:18:01] people want to say the pope is the Beast
[1:18:03] the pope is not the Beast the devil's
[1:18:05] the Beast the pope is the office of the
[1:18:07] Beast that the devil has control over
[1:18:10] right Amen to me it's kind I try to like
[1:18:13] to make that differentiation because
[1:18:15] it's like going back in the Garden of
[1:18:17] Eden when people say that Eve had sex
[1:18:19] with the devil no she
[1:18:20] didn't a man of of physical human woman
[1:18:24] cannot have a a relationship like that
[1:18:26] with a spirit right but I've had people
[1:18:30] say I've heard ministers say that it's
[1:18:33] not true she had relation with the
[1:18:36] serpent whom the devil had taken control
[1:18:40] over amen it's that simple amen amen now
[1:18:43] it's the same thing here that they
[1:18:46] they've had fornication this office with
[1:18:51] with whom Satan has taken control over
[1:18:54] Satan has taken control over the pap
[1:18:58] office that's why that uh it is who it
[1:19:02] is the ficaras Philly di in place of
[1:19:05] Christ uh the triple crown and all those
[1:19:08] things that we know uh of course I've
[1:19:11] done it here years ago where I spelled
[1:19:13] out the vicarious filia and shows we can
[1:19:15] see that it spells out 666 666 amen but
[1:19:20] it literally means in place of or
[1:19:23] instead of Christ right amen um Satan
[1:19:29] now incarnate in that Spirit now this
[1:19:31] Beast which thou saw us uh was and is
[1:19:34] not amen well that's exactly what this
[1:19:37] Pap of office is they have a pope he
[1:19:40] dies they elect another one he dies
[1:19:43] elect another one he dies was is not was
[1:19:46] is not was is not was is not still even
[1:19:49] to today was is not was is not and shall
[1:19:53] Ascend out of the bottomless pit now
[1:19:55] that's the devil not the Pope's office
[1:19:57] that's the devil the Beast remember the
[1:19:59] Beast is the
[1:20:01] office and uh shall go into predition
[1:20:05] and they that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:20:07] Wonder here's your mystery now and they
[1:20:10] that dwell on the Earth shall wonder
[1:20:12] whose names were not written in the Book
[1:20:15] of Life and the foundation of the world
[1:20:18] when they beheld the Beast that was and
[1:20:20] is not and yet is amen now you've got a
[1:20:24] group of people uh actually it calls it
[1:20:28] says the uh those that dwell on the
[1:20:31] earth uh that is pretty much everybody
[1:20:34] right I don't know anybody else I don't
[1:20:36] know anybody that dwells above the Earth
[1:20:40] uh that's pretty much every human that
[1:20:43] ever draw a breath right but there's an
[1:20:46] exception everyone that ever draw a
[1:20:49] breath except for an exception that
[1:20:50] exception is the people whose names were
[1:20:53] written in the Lamb's Book of Life or as
[1:20:56] it says here the book of life that was
[1:20:59] before the foundation of the world well
[1:21:01] the only book of life that there is that
[1:21:04] existed before the foundation of the
[1:21:06] world is that book is in God's mind and
[1:21:09] in God's mind were you from the
[1:21:11] beginning am amen that's the only one
[1:21:14] that existed before the foundation of
[1:21:16] the world was those names that was in
[1:21:18] God's mind back
[1:21:20] then those are the ones who have not
[1:21:24] been deceived praise the Lord so the
[1:21:27] ones that are deceived are the ones who
[1:21:29] were not written in the Book of Life
[1:21:32] from the foundation world so it's the
[1:21:33] whole world the whole earth becomes
[1:21:36] deceived by this except for those that
[1:21:39] were in him before the foundation of the
[1:21:41] world those that belong to him Christ
[1:21:45] the bride that's again that that is a
[1:21:48] separation Point amen the bride we were
[1:21:53] a part of him before the foundation of
[1:21:55] the world and we have it's like The
[1:21:58] Prodigal Son the prodical son was never
[1:22:01] not a son no matter what he did where he
[1:22:03] went how he how he conducted his life
[1:22:07] blew his daddy's money none of that
[1:22:09] mattered it was nothing that that boy
[1:22:12] could ever do to cause himself to ever
[1:22:15] not be the son of the man right could do
[1:22:20] it there's no way no matter what he
[1:22:23] could change his name he could go to
[1:22:26] court and get himself emancipated it
[1:22:28] doesn't matter whatever he tried to do
[1:22:30] didn't matter he was still the son of so
[1:22:34] and so hallelujah amen amen never was
[1:22:38] not a son Hallelujah you no matter how
[1:22:43] bad I was I was never not a son right I
[1:22:47] was always God's son it don't matter if
[1:22:50] I was passed out in the bathroom of a
[1:22:52] Black Angus Restaurant I was still a Son
[1:22:54] of God am amen I didn't look like it
[1:22:58] Hallelujah didn't sound like it didn't
[1:23:00] feel like it wasn't acting like it for
[1:23:02] sure but I was amen I just thank God
[1:23:05] that one day I come to the realization I
[1:23:08] wasn't that guy I'm this guy yeah amen
[1:23:10] praise the Lord and when I come to that
[1:23:12] realization I had to kill him so this
[1:23:15] one could live amen so he's dead praise
[1:23:19] the Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah so
[1:23:22] we're thankful that God did that for us
[1:23:25] so always a son in God's mind you were
[1:23:28] always there amen always there those
[1:23:31] names written they say well you got a we
[1:23:34] got a book here we got to read some
[1:23:37] names all that matters is what is in in
[1:23:40] God's mind amen it a physical book
[1:23:44] somewhere name somewhere God has it all
[1:23:46] up here right or I we say up here God's
[1:23:50] the spirit too but uh always in God's
[1:23:53] thinking God's mind to attribute a part
[1:23:56] of God just look at it that way only
[1:23:59] have to think about the brain or the
[1:24:00] head or the mind a part of God
[1:24:05] Amen and here is the mind which hath
[1:24:08] wisdom the seven heads or seven
[1:24:10] mountains we can finish reading all that
[1:24:14] amen you can read that we'll go uh well
[1:24:17] we probably won't come back to that
[1:24:18] later anyway I want to go over and read
[1:24:21] another verse to follow this this to
[1:24:23] follow this and it's the next chapter
[1:24:25] over chapter 18
[1:24:30] verse4 and there'll probably be some
[1:24:32] followup to this next week uh next week
[1:24:35] the next couple weeks there's a kind of
[1:24:38] a finalization I want to bring up of uh
[1:24:42] of a lot of this and we'll probably
[1:24:43] revisit this to some point uh then so
[1:24:46] Revelation 18 now verse four
[1:24:49] Revelation uh
[1:24:51] 184 now it says and I heard another
[1:24:55] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:25:01] who my people right praise the Lord who
[1:25:05] are his people hallelujah his people are
[1:25:07] the ones who are part of him before the
[1:25:09] foundation of the world his people are
[1:25:11] the ones that are in verse 8 178 that
[1:25:14] were names who were written in the Book
[1:25:16] of Life from the foundation of the world
[1:25:17] in God's mind a part of God come out of
[1:25:21] her mind who
[1:25:24] her don't be partaker of her sin don't
[1:25:27] be partaker drunken on the wine of her
[1:25:29] fornication come out of her my people
[1:25:33] and be not partakers of her sin that you
[1:25:36] that you receive not of her plagues
[1:25:38] that's exactly what the Bride of Jesus
[1:25:41] Christ has done she has come out of that
[1:25:44] system she has come out of those dogmas
[1:25:48] she has come out from being a part of
[1:25:51] receiving the mark of of the beast but I
[1:25:54] do want you to see something else so
[1:25:56] now the foolish virgin does not receive
[1:26:00] the mark of the beast either amen
[1:26:02] because remember the foolish virgin is
[1:26:05] exactly what it says they're virtuous
[1:26:08] right yes those that receive the mark of
[1:26:10] the beast are not virtuous people that's
[1:26:13] why they have a mark theyve received
[1:26:17] that Dogma they've received that
[1:26:19] Doctrine they've allowed themselves to
[1:26:22] come drunken on that amen the foolish
[1:26:25] virgin does not they are virtuous they
[1:26:29] have not committed fornication against
[1:26:33] the one they claim as their God Amen
[1:26:36] they just didn't become born again they
[1:26:38] just didn't receive the Holy Spirit they
[1:26:40] just didn't uh receive the indwelling
[1:26:42] presence of the holy spirit amen but
[1:26:45] they were undefiled they are virtuous
[1:26:47] people now notice it mentions four times
[1:26:50] if I remember right over here here that
[1:26:52] we just read four times about
[1:26:54] fornication amen how could you have
[1:26:57] committed fornication and yet be
[1:27:00] virtuous right amen so the foolish
[1:27:03] virgin even though they go in the
[1:27:05] tribulation they do not receive the mark
[1:27:08] of the beast they can't because they're
[1:27:10] virtuous scripturally they they maintain
[1:27:14] uh their virtue amen they cannot be uh
[1:27:18] it cannot be defiled by any other man by
[1:27:20] any other Dogma by any another
[1:27:22] denomination they cannot be defiled now
[1:27:25] let's go to Revelation chapter 9 I'm
[1:27:27] going to finish this up here uh here
[1:27:29] real
[1:27:32] directly the Lord help
[1:27:36] amen Revelation chapter
[1:27:40] n and I got one other scripture I just
[1:27:43] want to hit real quick uh because I'm
[1:27:46] not going to be able to get to the rest
[1:27:47] of this but uh but that's okay uh
[1:27:51] Revelation chapter chapter
[1:27:52] n one good thing I I I enjoyed when the
[1:27:57] Lord called me to be a pastor I used to
[1:28:00] do everything I could do to try to pack
[1:28:02] what the lord gave me into one sermon
[1:28:05] wherever I went I I uh and and when I
[1:28:08] first started pastoring I tried to do
[1:28:10] that again and it would get later and
[1:28:12] later I was like what am I doing I can
[1:28:14] finish this next week or I can finish
[1:28:15] this Wednesday night or or just really
[1:28:19] break it down and make six eight parts
[1:28:21] to it that's why we have God in
[1:28:23] Simplicity part 14 now amen but now
[1:28:26] Revelation 9 uh verse 13 very familiar
[1:28:31] scripture reading but let's look here
[1:28:32] and the sixth Angel sounded and Heard a
[1:28:35] Voice from the four horns of the golden
[1:28:37] altar which is before God saying to the
[1:28:41] sixth Angel which had the trumpet loose
[1:28:44] the Four Angels which are bound in the
[1:28:47] great river
[1:28:48] Euphrates loose them now that's the
[1:28:51] that's the
[1:28:53] instruction from God to this sixth Angel
[1:28:57] to loose those four Angels amen loose
[1:29:01] those four Angels which are bound there
[1:29:05] the Great River e phas and the Four
[1:29:06] Angels were loosed which were prepared
[1:29:09] for an hour day month and a year for to
[1:29:12] slay the third part of men and the
[1:29:15] number of the army of the horsemen were
[1:29:18] 200,000,000 and I heard the number of
[1:29:22] them the
[1:29:24] 200,000,000 demons now I mentioned this
[1:29:27] before because I did again I told you I
[1:29:28] like math so did the math on it you do2
[1:29:31] 200,000 pretty easy math it's 200
[1:29:34] million amen 200 million demons now I
[1:29:39] have surmised in my opinion that it is
[1:29:43] possible that those 200 million demons
[1:29:47] are the third of whom Satan deceived in
[1:29:50] heaven and were cast cast out into the
[1:29:52] Earth I don't know that brother Brown
[1:29:55] never said that uh that's just something
[1:29:57] that I think maybe would have
[1:30:00] been Joel asked us last night uh me and
[1:30:04] sofa how many angels do you think there
[1:30:06] are well I no idea whatsoever but I said
[1:30:10] well based on the math that if I think
[1:30:13] that the 200 million is a third then you
[1:30:16] got two more thirds which is 400 million
[1:30:19] I don't know that I said well then you
[1:30:21] got all different Angels there's not
[1:30:23] just one type of Angel you got different
[1:30:25] types of angels I thought 400 400
[1:30:27] million that's a lot I don't know but
[1:30:30] God knows and that's what matters but
[1:30:33] 200 million demons now now let's look
[1:30:36] why were those 200 million demons
[1:30:39] loed 200 million demons let's look at
[1:30:41] this Feast of the trumpets again I'm
[1:30:44] finishing here Feast of the
[1:30:47] trumpets brother said what has it done
[1:30:50] in the cunningness as he said he come in
[1:30:53] like flatteries and what has he done
[1:30:55] Satan Satan come in like flatteries we
[1:30:59] know that's exactly how the that's the
[1:31:01] devil's T that's actually the devil's
[1:31:03] number one tactic flattery and Beauty
[1:31:06] Satan uses Beauty and flatteries uh
[1:31:09] shooing I called it more than anything
[1:31:13] amen just get you comfortable make you
[1:31:15] feel good make it look good uh you know
[1:31:19] how if it feels good it looks good how
[1:31:21] can it be
[1:31:22] bad uh that's probably one of the number
[1:31:25] one signs that it is bad uh but anyway
[1:31:30] let's move on comes in like flatteries
[1:31:32] now what has he done he is bringing the
[1:31:35] Protestant ecumenical council of the
[1:31:37] world churches the spirit of antichrist
[1:31:40] upon both of them bringing them to the
[1:31:42] slaughter just like they did the other
[1:31:45] in the hour to call the bride how loosed

[1:32:07] it's spiritual these 200 million demons
[1:32:10] that were looed is not a physical demon
[1:32:14] however they do work just like we talked
[1:32:17] about the office of the Pope and Satan

[1:32:59] doesn't have right amen praise the Lord
[1:33:03] and even though he knows enough to know
[1:33:06] he can't get them he still keeps trying

[1:44:25] the word is so beautiful so pure amen
[1:44:28] now I wanted to
[1:44:29] mention uh my flight I'll go to
[1:44:31] Bakersville again next week my flight
[1:44:33] next week doesn't leave too early so
[1:44:36] church will be at regular time so I have
[1:44:37] to worry about that it's about uh since
[1:44:40] the time change it's a little it's about
[1:44:42] an hour earlier but it's 2 o'clock
[1:44:44] instead of 3:00 so it's basically so
[1:44:46] it's not uh not going to affect anything
[1:44:48] here don't have to worry about that um
[1:44:51] got Easter coming up the end of the
[1:44:52] month too amen so we want to remember
[1:44:55] that but what I'd like to do is the
[1:44:57] Sunday after Easter I want to try to
[1:44:59] have communion foot washing and we I
[1:45:02] wanted to do it end the last year and
[1:45:05] then kept getting put off and sicknesses
[1:45:07] and things like that uh so I want to try
[1:45:11] I leave Easter afternoon to go fly out
[1:45:14] supposed to uh so the next the next
[1:45:18] Sunday April 7th uh I want to try to
[1:45:21] have communion foot wash and maybe a
[1:45:24] lunch and if we can arrange that if I
[1:45:26] could get the place next door I'm sure
[1:45:28] if it's empty Craig will probably let us
[1:45:30] use it um he really likes us as he likes
[1:45:34] us as tenants
[1:45:36] so I think the fact that he likes us so
[1:45:38] much is the reason we're still here
[1:45:40] because he could probably get a lot more
[1:45:41] for this place than what we're paid uh
[1:45:44] so thankful God's giv us Grace there
[1:45:48] amen but uh so I'm going to I'll try to
[1:45:51] talk to him April 7th though please mark
[1:45:54] and remember your mind May uh April 7th
[1:45:57] I want to have I try to have communion
[1:45:59] foot washing and maybe hopefully a lunch
[1:46:02] next door uh maybe even before the Zas
[1:46:06] go back to the mountains maybe sister
[1:46:07] Karen will be feeling better and Lydia
[1:46:10] and sheilia and hopefully we can have
[1:46:11] everybody back uh together healthy amen
