[0:00] you for tuning in today reaching the
[0:03] lovely name of the Lord Jesus today
[0:05] another beautiful resurrection morning
[0:07] watching the beautiful doves fly out
[0:09] outside there outside our window and
[0:12] just enjoying the Lord's presence and
[0:14] enjoy the Lord's goodness in our lives
[0:16] so god bless you today we want to go
[0:20] ahead and start our service now as I've
[0:22] mentioned to you a couple of times in
[0:23] text this week we're looking for a
[0:26] couple of places now I've got something
[0:30] that we looks like most definitely can
[0:33] use at a conference room at the Holiday
[0:36] Inn don't want to begin starting until
[0:39] it kind of felt led to start maybe June
[0:42] 7th
[0:43] so maybe Lord willing we can do that it
[0:46] got a couple other fillers out we'll see
[0:48] what happens with those but one of them
[0:50] is in a more permanent place which I'm
[0:52] hoping we get I'd like to have more of a
[0:54] permanent place so we can just set up
[0:57] and be set up be our place and nobody
[1:00] else in there but us so just continue to
[1:02] pray for us and just trust the Lord's
[1:04] blessings upon that and just believe the
[1:07] Lord will just provide us he provided
[1:09] the other place it's his work so he's
[1:11] obligated to take care of it
[1:12] it's not our work it's his so if it was
[1:16] mine then I would be obligated to take
[1:17] care of it but it's his so he's
[1:19] obligated to take care of it he just
[1:21] leads us to guides us in the right
[1:23] direction to help so look a little
[1:27] probably look a little medium-rare to
[1:29] you to take I don't know how good the
[1:31] camera quality is but me and brother
[1:34] Roger did up another
[1:37] job Electric job I've been working with
[1:39] Bertha Roger enjoying this fellowship
[1:41] have been working with him I was a
[1:43] helper in his electrical Jobson we were
[1:46] outside all day Friday so it got a
[1:49] little red but God blessed us and helped
[1:52] us to be able to get everything done and
[1:54] God blessed us so we have a couple of
[1:56] prayer requests want to make you aware
[1:58] of as as as we go to the Lord today
[2:04] brother Dennis asked us we continue
[2:07] remember his wife Leah of course as you
[2:09] all know she's nurse working with the
[2:12] doctor whose office has stayed open
[2:13] during this entire period and just pray
[2:16] the Lord keep her hedged and keep her
[2:18] protected in him as well and brother
[2:21] Dennis also asked that we would remember
[2:22] him his back has been given in some
[2:25] problems and has been hurting lately so
[2:27] let's just remember him in prayer as
[2:29] well brother angel Frey who had sent us
[2:33] sent me a text tube and said he's asking
[2:36] prayer for God to help them his family
[2:39] draw closer and to be reflecting God's
[2:41] glory to all around them also for God to
[2:44] help his dad who's having trouble
[2:46] breathing and sleeping also for his
[2:49] brother to come back to a walk of life
[2:51] with the Lord a holy walk of life of the
[2:54] Lord for his mother-in-law to be
[2:57] protected and to be baptized soon forgot
[2:59] to apply that holy blood daily and to be
[3:02] manifesting as God's fruit in these last
[3:04] days let us speak for God to meet all of
[3:07] our needs in these last days and to just
[3:09] give God all his praise for all all God
[3:12] has done and all my family I also want
[3:15] to wish my mother-in-law happy 70th
[3:17] birthday and for God to bless all the
[3:20] church fan all my church family for we
[3:23] miss you all dearly god bless you all
[3:26] always
[3:28] - appreciate brother angel sending that
[3:30] and also sister Celia sent to request to
[3:33] continue remember her brother Harlan and
[3:35] prayer Harlan has had some supernatural
[3:38] things and of course through sister
[3:40] Celia as well things happen in his life
[3:42] and he's seen the hand of God move in
[3:44] his life and says that he can feel when
[3:47] the believers were praying for him so
[3:49] let's just continue obviously to
[3:50] remember him in prayer she also wanted
[3:53] me to mention that Gabriel's birthday
[3:56] he'll be five years old Tuesday so I had
[4:00] to birthday to Gabriel I don't know if
[4:01] are trying gay browse or watching but at
[4:04] birthday Gabriel if you are when you see
[4:06] this amen we love you and love you all
[4:10] of the Lord and just wish you a
[4:11] wonderful fifth birthday and the Lord so
[4:14] also sister Lydia had sent us a request
[4:16] for her niece Marie who has an unspoken
[4:21] prayer request but also wants to thank
[4:24] the Lord for bringing her son back home
[4:26] safe from the Middle East
[4:28] he is served serving in the Air Force
[4:30] god bless you so we want to remember
[4:33] that in prayer of his her niece Marie
[4:36] had a special unspoken request so we
[4:39] certainly want to remember that in
[4:40] prayer the God will just move upon that
[4:42] request and need if you have a request
[4:44] you didn't send it to me or something
[4:46] that's upon your heart or maybe
[4:47] something unspoken you know the Lord
[4:50] knows our hearts we lift our hands in
[4:52] church which is fine too but just giving
[4:55] something as a signification to the Lord
[4:57] you know it takes sometimes that little
[5:00] movement of significant significance
[5:03] that movement that we do that signifies
[5:06] to the Lord that we accept and
[5:09] acknowledge the fact that he sees our
[5:11] hearts and he knows our requests so if
[5:13] you have those things just keep them on
[5:15] your heart and we're
[5:16] go to the Lord in prayer now precious
[5:20] Lord Jesus thank you again father for
[5:22] your blessings to us today thank you for

[8:28] commit the remaining part of this
[8:30] service in your hands in the name of the
[8:32] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[8:36] praise the Lord god bless you today may
[8:39] have a little more issue with the camera
[8:43] mic forgot to put the battery in this
[8:45] camera but so we're just streaming with
[8:48] our regular old desk camera today so I
[8:51] apologize for maybe the blurring in and
[8:54] out but would just try to make the best
[8:55] of it as we can and just continue to see
[8:58] what the Lord provide going forward so a
[9:01] little thought the Lord put on my heart
[9:02] and wanted to give it to you I I want to
[9:06] continue on with the thought of the
[9:10] Christ mystery of God revealed or the
[9:12] mystery
[9:13] and God in Christ I wanted to continue
[9:17] that thought that we've left off when I
[9:18] went to North Carolina to visit my mom
[9:20] but honestly I really I really would
[9:23] like to do that when we have a permanent
[9:25] place more than just this streaming not
[9:30] that there's anything wrong with the
[9:31] streaming and I want to continue this
[9:32] streaming once we have a place a more
[9:35] permanent place but I just felt like for
[9:39] some reason I don't know I just felt
[9:41] like when we get a place that we can all
[9:43] be together again and see your beautiful
[9:45] faces and we just continue on that
[9:47] thought so
[9:48] just a couple of things that maybe the
[9:51] Lord helped us with and you know with
[9:53] the current conditions and things that's
[9:55] going on in the world and it seems like
[9:57] a lot of the midweek messages have been
[9:58] focused on that and maybe this is well
[10:01] today so I want to speak on a subject
[10:03] that I spoke on at our church here three
[10:06] or four years ago I guess when I say
[10:09] four years ago it's honestly I meant to
[10:11] check but I have to look again I believe
[10:15] Friday was our fourth anniversary four
[10:19] years ago Friday I think it was May 15th
[10:22] four years ago we've had our four year
[10:25] they anniversary it's just wonderful how
[10:28] you've put up with me this hump but
[10:30] God's been good to us hasn't he for
[10:31] years
[10:33] Mabel it was May 15th May 15th or maybe
[10:36] even today I'm not sure I got to go look
[10:38] my records again but I think it was May
[10:40] 15 so four years so about three years or
[10:44] so ago I ministered on this some of you
[10:46] may have remembered it but I want to
[10:48] talk about being pressurized and how the
[10:51] bride and going through this things as
[10:55] things that we're going through today
[10:56] and all that is happening in our lives
[10:58] is it's just to help get us ready and
[11:00] prepared to go in a rapture to be ready
[11:06] when God calls us home so that takes
[11:09] some pressurization to to get us through
[11:11] everything that's going on in the world
[11:13] today and prepare us to get ready to go
[11:15] home so let me just begin a scripture
[11:18] reading before I actually start here on
[11:20] the
[11:21] on the subject but in st. Loup Saint
[11:25] Luke chapter 22 is where I want to begin
[11:27] my scripture reading today you remember
[11:29] the topic here is being pressurized
[11:31] pressurized or the day of pressure st.
[11:34] Luke chapter 22 and if there ever was
[11:37] that they have pressure friend we know
[11:39] that's today st. Luke 20 to 39 and he
[11:44] came out and went as he was walk to the
[11:46] Mount of Olives and his disciples also
[11:49] followed him and when he was at the
[11:51] place he said unto them pray that ye
[11:54] enter not into temptation and he was
[11:57] withdrawn from them about a stone's cast
[11:59] and kneeled down and prayed now each one
[12:03] of these of course we know this is Jesus
[12:04] going to the Garden of Gethsemane and
[12:06] each account of this has a different
[12:08] accounting and some a little more
[12:11] descriptive this one I picked because of
[12:13] the description that because I believe
[12:16] this described it more adequately than
[12:19] of what the point I wanted to make today
[12:21] the other ones are quite outstanding as
[12:23] well if you want to go to Matthew 26 36
[12:25] or mark 14 32 those are still some very
[12:29] stark accounts of this Jesus the Garden
[12:32] of Gethsemane he was withdrawn from them
[12:35] about a stone's cast kneeled down and
[12:37] prayed saying father if thou be willing
[12:40] remove this cup from me nevertheless not
[12:43] my will but thine be done there we know
[12:45] of course he went a couple of times back
[12:48] and forth and of course Matthews account
[12:50] accounts more of those events than what
[12:52] Luke does here Luke was getting to a
[12:55] specific point and so he narrows it down
[12:58] and doesn't go to the back and forth
[13:00] Jesus went and prayed and come back to
[13:02] his disciples he went a little further
[13:04] which is something all of us could
[13:06] probably do from time to time go a
[13:09] little further a little deeper a little
[13:11] more consecrated Jesus went a little
[13:14] further
[13:15] and and and he was wrestling he was
[13:18] wrestling with the with the thought of
[13:20] what he was going to have to go through
[13:22] I believe the Matthew where the market
[13:25] count talks about him going through
[13:26] across the book Brook of Sidra maybe
[13:28] that was even John the brook of seed
[13:30] Ryan remember brother green telling us
[13:33] about how the when the sacrifice and the
[13:36] time of the sacrifice of the lambs and
[13:38] all the people would come and all that
[13:40] blood would run down through that Brook
[13:42] and as brother as Jesus cross over that
[13:44] Brook and seeing that huge flood of
[13:47] blood coming down through there you know
[13:49] at the strike a man's heart because
[13:51] remember God was mad
[13:52] Jesus was man as much as he was God
[13:55] Jesus wept he was he was both divine and
[13:58] mortal and so you can imagine the mortal
[14:01] part of him going across that brook and
[14:04] seeing all that blood coming down
[14:05] through them realizing what his ultimate
[14:09] destination was his destiny his destiny
[14:13] was that that part of that would be his
[14:15] blood that blood that would be running
[14:17] out of his veins and can you imagine the
[14:19] agony he was going through can you
[14:21] imagine the pressure that Jesus was
[14:23] feeling to fulfill the destiny that God
[14:26] had given him just think about how the
[14:28] the agony that a man a person in their
[14:31] humanity would feel realizing what
[14:34] they're about to go through so he's
[14:36] crying Lord if thou if this cup can pass
[14:40] for me if there's any other way that
[14:42] this can be done if there's any other
[14:45] way that what you want to get
[14:46] accomplished can be accomplished Lord
[14:48] would you do it that way I believe a lot
[14:50] of us have probably thought that
[14:52] ourselves Lord if there's any other way
[14:54] that you can do this any other way that
[14:56] this can be accomplished other than my
[14:58] involvement Lord could you do that that
[15:00] way but Lord but the Lord sends us here
[15:03] to do our part you know even brother
[15:08] Roderick were talking the other day
[15:09] about the bride's responsibilities and
[15:11] sounds like a good message really
[15:13] maybe get into that but the bride's
[15:16] responsibility you realize that when a
[15:18] man marries a wife he doesn't just carry
[15:20] her across the threshold of their home
[15:22] and throw all the cops and say okay you
[15:23] just sit there awhile know that she has
[15:26] a job to do
[15:27] she has responsibilities she has things
[15:29] that she does and her main focus is
[15:31] taking care of her Lord taking care of
[15:33] her King taking care of her husband
[15:35] that's her main responsibility and and
[15:38] but she's responsible to God for what
[15:41] God has put her to do and and all of our
[15:45] responsibilities our responsibility and
[15:46] this responsibility was his but yet the
[15:50] flesh of the man was crying Lord if
[15:52] there's any way this cup can pass for me
[15:55] let it pass did you imagine if you
[15:58] thought and knew that you were going to
[15:59] go through this situation I probably
[16:01] saying the same thing if not worse but
[16:05] yet he come to the place that he had to
[16:06] die to his flesh even in the midst of
[16:09] the great pressure that he was feeling
[16:12] at this time look at this this pressure
[16:14] was so great father if thou be willing
[16:16] remove this cup from me nevertheless not
[16:19] my will but thine be done now we know
[16:21] that was accomplished over a couple of
[16:23] times but again Luke narrows it down
[16:26] nevertheless not my will but thine will
[16:29] be done so he had to die to himself and
[16:34] there appeared an angel unto him from
[16:36] heaven strengthening him 44 first now
[16:38] and being in an agony he prayed more
[16:43] earnestly oh what a lesson for Saints
[16:47] what a lesson when the pressure is on
[16:50] when the desperation hits and the
[16:54] pressure is on is a time to enter into a
[16:57] more earnest a more desperate prayer
[17:01] Jesus got into an agony and he prayed
[17:05] more earnestly and his sweat as it were
[17:09] great drops of blood
[17:12] now I don't know there's any human ever
[17:15] entered into that kind of agony before
[17:17] but that's pretty severe now I've said
[17:20] this before and I've heard people say
[17:22] and I don't want to be contradicting and
[17:24] I don't want to argue with anybody but
[17:27] some people think that boy came out of
[17:29] him I don't believe that's what happened
[17:31] personally I believe that the Bible says
[17:35] his sweat was as it were great drops of
[17:41] blood his sweat not blood his sweat was
[17:45] as great drops of blood so his sweat
[17:48] coming out of him was like it would be
[17:51] great drops of blood snot little blood
[17:53] but that still think about the agony
[17:56] that Jesus was going through at this
[17:59] period of his life agony more earnestly
[18:02] his sweat was as it were great drops of
[18:04] blood falling down to the ground now if
[18:06] any man every / any person ever been
[18:08] into a place of the feeling pressure the
[18:13] whole way that the entire world was on
[18:16] Jesus soldiers the entire weight of
[18:19] every human ever comin whose feet at
[18:23] this soil from the from Adam to the last
[18:27] born man 10 seconds before was on Jesus
[18:31] shoulders to every human that would ever
[18:35] be born after his crucifixion was on his
[18:39] shoulders do you imagine the pressure
[18:41] the pressure of feeling of what he was
[18:45] about to do his sweat was as it were
[18:48] great drops of blood falling to the
[18:50] ground when he rose up from the prayer
[18:53] he was come to his disciples he found
[18:55] them sleeping for sorrow and said unto
[18:57] them why sleepy
[18:59] rise and pray lest she enter into
[19:02] temptation No
[19:04] to think about this great day of
[19:07] pressure and it is a great day of
[19:10] pressure I mean my goodness you see the
[19:13] world going crazy over the coronavirus I
[19:15] mean the world think the nation they're
[19:18] going going crazy over this of this one
[19:20] virus and we've had much more serious
[19:22] things hit the planet before but it
[19:25] seems to this one thing seems to have
[19:27] gripped people so much it's putting
[19:29] people under such great pressure think
[19:32] about the leadership of our federal
[19:34] government and think about the
[19:35] leadership of our national and and
[19:38] federal and local governments the
[19:40] pressure that's on them every life every
[19:43] person is that they're responsible for
[19:46] it's under great pressure and think
[19:49] about the the lives that that Christians
[19:53] are living - think about the place that
[19:55] we're at today and the great pressure
[19:56] that we're under to be able to do what
[20:00] God has called us to do to be led by his
[20:02] spirit and to do what His perfect will
[20:05] would be for us think about that great
[20:07] pressure but now I want you understand
[20:10] as I've said this before pressure is not
[20:13] always a bad thing
[20:15] pressure is a very important part of our
[20:19] everyday life you wouldn't get very far
[20:23] if there wasn't some pressure in your
[20:25] tires in your car you would go very far
[20:29] tires would be flat just think if you
[20:32] went to the sink and turn the faucet and
[20:34] no water came out why because there's no
[20:36] pressure you say there's plenty of water
[20:38] in the pipe but there's no pressure
[20:40] behind the water to get it through the
[20:42] party takes pressure every day in Tucson
[20:46] we live especially in the deep the
[20:48] season that we're coming up in it's very
[20:50] important to have some pressure in our
[20:53] lives because without it our air
[20:55] conditioners wouldn't work astronauts
[20:58] couldn't go in down our space people
[21:00] could go down in the depths of the water
[21:02] couldn't fly airplanes airplanes have to
[21:04] be pressurized so that we can form
[21:07] so pressure is a very important part of
[21:10] of our daily lives and the things that
[21:13] go on our lives without it we would be
[21:15] in a bad condition we would be in bad
[21:18] shape without pressure god but God and
[21:22] those are some positive things that we
[21:23] look at of what pressure is taking place
[21:26] every day and in certain parts of our
[21:28] lives and of course you can think of
[21:32] probably several other things but God
[21:33] also uses that pressure to get us
[21:37] prepared to get us ready to get to get
[21:40] us in the place that we need to be to
[21:42] serve Him and to live for him that
[21:45] pressure that he puts on our lives
[21:46] every day does what it without pressure
[21:50] you cannot find the weak spot in a tire
[21:54] you know or in a pipe or something this
[21:58] chain is only as good as its weakest
[22:00] link and if that weakest link is not
[22:03] shored up by putting it under pressure
[22:06] see if you just leave that leak that
[22:09] weak link there when the pressure really
[22:11] does come the serious pressure that link
[22:14] is going to break so what God does is he
[22:17] makes sure and tests us he makes sure
[22:19] tests to make sure whatever that weak
[22:22] link is if it's gonna break it's gonna
[22:24] break it that weak link and then if that
[22:27] weakly core or that one spot springs a
[22:30] leak or that one place and you tire
[22:31] springs a leak you know where to fix it
[22:34] you know how to shore up that weak spot
[22:38] and the only way that weak spot in your
[22:41] life can come forward is if there's
[22:44] pressure put on you and that pressure
[22:47] brings us to a place of acknowledgment
[22:49] to say God and this is a weak spot of my
[22:52] life I want this fixed you got what we -
[22:55] sure this place up I don't want this
[22:57] place to explode or a lot of people have
[23:02] a weak spot and then they explode into
[23:03] anchor or something we don't we don't
[23:06] want that to happen we want to make sure
[23:08] that there's
[23:09] places that that God wants to use for
[23:12] through us stay short up and stays
[23:15] pressurized and stays and stays covered
[23:19] so that that weak spot that is detected
[23:22] is is fixed is repaired God uses
[23:27] pressure to be able to do that God uses
[23:30] pressure in our life look what brother
[23:32] Branham said here in the mighty conquer
[23:36] he said after dr. Constantine come over
[23:39] liberate them from under the Roman
[23:41] persecution United the church to stay
[23:43] together there where we got Catholic to
[23:46] begin with when they did this the church
[23:48] lost more grounds in ten years than had
[23:50] gained all through the persecution if
[23:52] there's anything that makes Christians
[23:55] lazy think about this anything that
[23:58] makes Christians lazy it's when they're
[24:01] on a flowery bed of ease don't we don't
[24:05] have we don't have a persecution enough
[24:09] we don't have it hard enough always at
[24:14] the chain is strongest as its weakest
[24:16] link
[24:17] and a man under pressure is what he is
[24:20] when he's under pressure you are what
[24:23] you really are
[24:24] when you're under pressure we all of us
[24:27] we can show ourselves and flatteries and
[24:31] fineries and and put up a front facade
[24:33] and and make it look like something but
[24:36] you put a little pressure on it and then
[24:39] you find out what that man is really
[24:40] made of you can buy a beautiful tire you
[24:43] can buy the greatest best one that was
[24:45] ever made and you can put it on your car
[24:47] but if there's a defect in that tire it
[24:49] won't come out till you put a little
[24:51] pressure on it you realize hey this tire
[24:54] is is defective it's not right it was
[24:58] manufactured wrong something's wrong
[24:59] with it the only way you can find out is
[25:02] when pressure is placed on it that's why
[25:05] God uses that pressure see a man under
[25:09] pressure is what he is when he's under
[25:11] pressure that pressure helps us realize
[25:14] who we are
[25:15] it'll get everybody else
[25:17] realize who we are when the pressures
[25:19] really put on his real true
[25:22] characteristics will show when he or she
[25:25] what she is under pressure it brings out
[25:29] the real person it brings out the true
[25:31] individual when that person is under
[25:34] pressure get him all riled up
[25:37] stir it up and you'll see if the real
[25:38] man comes out if he's got a temper it'll
[25:41] show itself if he's meek generally it'll
[25:43] show itself but put him under pressure
[25:46] Watson he's got his children God puts
[25:49] his children under pressure to test
[25:51] whether there are any flaws in them and
[25:54] we all don't none of us won't floss and
[25:57] all of us want to be at the place and
[25:59] see that that's the problem I think a
[26:02] lot of us get to sometimes were too
[26:05] willing to accept our flaws we're too
[26:08] willing to think well God forgives that
[26:11] or God excuses that or God is okay with
[26:14] that but that's not true God doesn't God
[26:18] will forgive
[26:19] I'm not saying God's not forgiving I'm
[26:21] not saying God's not a merciful God full
[26:23] of grace I'm saying that God places us
[26:26] under that pressure so that if we can
[26:28] fix that so we can make that right don't
[26:31] accept it is just normal don't accept it
[26:34] is well it's okay with God it's okay
[26:36] with me it's not okay especially if that
[26:39] pressure keeps putting up putting you in
[26:41] the same position every time and you
[26:44] keep going up every time well if it was
[26:47] okay God wouldn't keep putting you in
[26:49] that same position every time he does
[26:51] that because he wants you to fix it he
[26:54] wants you to make it right
[26:56] he wants you to change it whatever part
[26:58] of your life for how it needs to be done
[27:00] to fix her to sure that spot-up God
[27:03] wants you to do it and see if if we get
[27:06] to that point where God does that then
[27:09] it helps us understand more it puts us
[27:12] at sea we can't accept it it's it's not
[27:15] acceptable don't accept any flaws she
[27:18] said well I'm here but what I'll do but
[27:20] of course we're gonna make mistakes
[27:21] that's not what I'm talking about
[27:22] this is talking about perpetual things
[27:24] that are weaknesses in our lives if God
[27:28] keeps putting you under that same
[27:29] pressure that same condition that same
[27:32] thing to test you for that same thing
[27:36] continually that means that he is not
[27:39] pleased with you being that way and we
[27:41] need to fix that
[27:42] don't make the acceptant of it buh-bam
[27:45] said here anything that makes a
[27:49] Christian lays you fiery betta bees God
[27:52] doesn't want to set on a flowery bed of
[27:54] bees he wants rugged Christians let's
[27:57] look at this quote here God has
[28:00] identified by his characteristics
[28:01] Beaumont 1964 today we got a bunch of
[28:06] hotbed plants called Christians somebody
[28:10] you have to spray in baby and pamper and
[28:14] humor and we'll give you a and we'll
[28:17] give you give me fellowship will you if
[28:21] you'll cooperate will you do this that
[28:24] oh you bunch of hotbed plants we need
[28:27] some genuine Christianity born of the
[28:30] Spirit of God that'll take no
[28:32] cooperation no nothing else
[28:35] they don't want nothing because
[28:36] Christians are rugged amen
[28:40] Christians are rugged they're they're
[28:42] not a bunch of hotbed plants you don't
[28:44] have to baby a Christian because they
[28:47] know who they are and they know what the
[28:49] pressure and when that pressure comes to
[28:52] them they're willing to accept it but
[28:54] they want to fix it they want to do
[28:56] something about it they want to make it
[28:58] right they want to take that spot in
[29:00] them and make it right and fix that spot
[29:03] look what David said
[29:05] a man of course under pressure we all
[29:08] are no one is exempt from it no some
[29:15] probably some of you maybe even probably
[29:17] feel like I get more than my share of
[29:19] pressure look friend we're all that way
[29:22] some short a little more than others
[29:25] some you can recognize it more than
[29:27] others but the fact in truth of it is we
[29:30] are all in some way shape or form under
[29:33] a great deal of pressure especially as a
[29:35] Christian you know no pressure in this
[29:38] life until you become a Christian when
[29:40] you become a Christian that's when the
[29:42] real pressure starts you look and think
[29:44] what the presence under a lot of
[29:45] pressure yes the billionaire is a lot of
[29:48] pressure yes it may not be because of
[29:50] finances but trust me they're under
[29:52] pressure suicide among teenagers
[29:55] wouldn't be the place it is the the
[30:00] child abuse and the abuse of individuals
[30:04] those things see when a person is if
[30:08] somebody's weak in an area and and I'm
[30:11] gonna pick one us men but if a man an
[30:14] ungodly man of course it is weak in an
[30:17] area unless say he has a temper most
[30:19] ungodly men do have a temper unless you
[30:22] say he has a temper and he has a he gets
[30:25] to the places that he gets so pressured
[30:28] so much pressure now he's not
[30:30] pressurized now that's the topic that
[30:32] we're talking about because I want to
[30:34] end up with that part I want to end up
[30:36] with the pressurized but when they get
[30:38] under pressure they're not pressurized
[30:40] so if they're not pressurized when they
[30:43] get under that pressure then they
[30:45] explode the explosions got to come out
[30:48] somewhere and then that's when you see
[30:50] domestic violence you see people
[30:53] treating their wives and men treating
[30:55] their wives or children and things like
[30:57] that and suicide and bullying at school
[30:59] and all kinds of things that come out
[31:01] because of all the pressure it comes out
[31:04] because they don't know how to deal with
[31:05] it
[31:06] they don't know where to take it
[31:08] or to put it they don't know how to how
[31:10] to deal with it some most of the time
[31:12] people go to drugs to find a bar alcohol
[31:15] or righteous living gambling or whatever
[31:18] people find all kind of ways to try to
[31:21] release that pressure but everybody's
[31:24] under pressure everybody and the
[31:26] greatest pressure is when you become a
[31:29] Christian you don't know pressure until
[31:31] you become a Christian till you become
[31:33] born again then you begin to realize
[31:36] that pressure amen that's that great
[31:39] pressure is added but look what David
[31:41] said let's go to Psalm chapter 61 Psalm
[31:45] chapter 61 we'll begin reading with
[31:47] verse 1 Psalm 61:1 hear my cry O God
[31:53] attend unto my prayer from the end of
[31:56] the earth will I cry unto thee when my
[31:59] heart is overwhelmed now look where he's
[32:01] going
[32:02] look where David's going from the end of
[32:05] the earth I will cry unto thee when my
[32:09] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[32:14] that is higher than iron and who is that
[32:16] rock that rock is Jesus well people
[32:20] don't have Jesus where they go to they
[32:23] go to their rock what is their rock to
[32:26] be drink could be gambling whatever
[32:28] people have a wrong people have a place
[32:30] to release it sometimes people get so
[32:34] much pressure they can't release it all
[32:36] they just killed themselves suicide
[32:38] people then became to kill themselves
[32:41] because the pressure just gets too great
[32:42] and and they can't release enough of it
[32:46] and it overwhelms them but David said
[32:49] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[32:53] that rock that is higher than I lead me
[32:56] to Jesus Jesus although Jesus takes care
[33:00] of the situation for thou has seen a
[33:03] shoe that has been a shelter for me and
[33:06] a strong tower from the enemy I will
[33:10] abide in thy tavern
[33:11] before ever I will trust in the covet
[33:14] cover of thy wings Sayla amen David
[33:20] where did David decided to go David said
[33:22] lead me to the rock you say take me to
[33:25] Jesus lead me to Christ help me to get
[33:28] to the place but brother knew you just
[33:30] told me you don't know what pressure is
[33:31] until you become a Christian that's
[33:33] absolutely right but when you get that
[33:36] pressure as a Christian you have a place
[33:38] and someone to take it for you you fix
[33:42] that you sure that place up you you
[33:45] fixed that weak link you plug up that
[33:48] hole you stop that anger that that that
[33:53] temper and and you fix it you shored up
[33:57] and you got someone you go to and you
[33:59] release that to the Lord
[34:01] you say God my heart is overwhelmed god
[34:05] help me lead me to a place of peace lead
[34:09] me to Psalms 23 lead me to that place
[34:11] and you know a lot of people they read
[34:15] Psalms 23 at funerals but to me friends
[34:17] Psalms 23 is that a live scripture
[34:19] that's a scripture of being alive not
[34:22] dead though I walk they in through the
[34:26] valley of the shadow he leadeth me
[34:28] beside still waters he layeth me down in
[34:31] green pastures
[34:32] there you go there's where your release
[34:34] is he meant your release is it gambling
[34:37] and drinking or beating your wife your
[34:39] releases laying in green pastures going
[34:44] by the still waters what a beautiful
[34:47] thing the people could just only realize
[34:49] Fran if we can just realize how
[34:51] important this pressure is to us because
[34:54] God's getting us pressurized that
[34:57] pressurization just like an airplane
[34:59] that airplane is not past pressurized
[35:04] then everybody in it would duck
[35:08] it's the it's being pressurized that God
[35:12] wants to bring us to that place where
[35:14] we're pressurized so when the pressured
[35:16] is does come in it doesn't make any
[35:18] difference when you fix that hole in the
[35:21] tire and you fill that thing back up
[35:23] with air all the pressure from around it
[35:26] in it's not going to matter because it's
[35:28] short itself up now it's ready to
[35:31] fulfill its purpose its purpose to get
[35:34] you from point A to point B in your car
[35:36] it's ready to do what it's supposed to
[35:38] do David say when I'm overwhelmed and
[35:41] leave me to that rock leave me to that
[35:43] rock that is higher than I when I can't
[35:47] control it when I can't help it when I
[35:48] can't do it God God you bring me to that
[35:51] place that seems like the corona virus
[35:56] and the lock-up has really gotten people
[35:59] on edge gotten people to the point of
[36:02] anxiety and the point of suicide and
[36:08] pent up and you know because it gets us
[36:12] to the place that that people just can't
[36:15] handle that pressure and they can't
[36:18] handle being in a place that's that's
[36:20] secluded in and and a lot of people's
[36:24] releases of that pressure have been cut
[36:27] off bar has been shut down gambling
[36:30] place has been shut down and places that
[36:32] a lot of people use for release been
[36:35] shut down what do people do then Jesus
[36:39] doesn't shut down Jesus is open 24/7 Oh
[36:43] a friend is just people just get to
[36:45] realize it's the only way to live it's
[36:48] the only life there is look at this
[36:50] scripture this quote here here he him
[36:53] spoke in Washington 1962 now if that gun
[36:57] brother man I was talking about the time
[36:59] that a brother brother man had always
[37:02] wanted her whether it be rifle this
[37:05] brother it knew that brother branham
[37:08] so you took one of the rifles that they
[37:09] hurt that I believe was a Remington
[37:11] company could bore it out to make it
[37:14] like a Weatherby rifle and he gave it to
[37:16] brother Brown said this this was this
[37:19] was taken from a Remington to become
[37:23] like a Weatherby rifle and so this is
[37:27] the this is brother Browns explanation
[37:29] of course brother branham goes and he
[37:30] tries to hunt or shoot with that
[37:33] reformed whether it be rifle reformed
[37:36] Remington - of whether me and the gun
[37:39] blows up in his face
[37:41] why was the why did it blow up in his
[37:43] face now see whether man is talking now
[37:45] now if that gun would have started from
[37:49] the beginning in Weatherby dyes and have
[37:51] been made a Weatherby rifle it would
[37:53] never have blown up talk about blowing
[37:57] on people go up to take see because it
[38:00] would have been a whether it be rifle
[38:02] there same kind of steel that made up
[38:04] their dyes and everything he'd come
[38:05] right out into the regular rifle that it
[38:07] should have been but being it was
[38:09] something else and just nothing and just
[38:13] not only converted but was perverted
[38:16] into something that it wasn't and that's
[38:19] what made it blow up
[38:21] you think about people the same way
[38:23] today you got hybrid religions people
[38:25] that think they have something they
[38:27] really don't and then when the real
[38:29] pressure comes they think oh I'm a
[38:31] Christian oh I'm a believer and then
[38:35] when the real pressure comes what
[38:36] happens to him they blow up why because
[38:39] they weren't made in the Wetherby rifle
[38:41] factory the human wasn't made and and
[38:44] borned again the spirit of god they
[38:47] weren't filled of the Spirit of God if
[38:49] they were never born again it doesn't
[38:51] matter what their testimony is doesn't
[38:53] matter what they say they are if they
[38:55] really aren't born again they have to go
[38:57] back to the factory they have to go back
[39:00] to the place whether they're supposed to
[39:02] get it from the beginning which is God
[39:04] and then
[39:06] that that die-cast in them exactly
[39:09] perfectly to be the image of Jesus
[39:12] Christ then when the pressure comes they
[39:15] won't blow up if they're taking this
[39:18] rifle this or or taking it from the
[39:20] exact steel and everything to be formed
[39:24] and made in the Wetherby plant the
[39:27] Weatherby factory to be a Weatherby
[39:30] rifle but every speck in every dimension
[39:34] and every way that a rather Weatherby
[39:36] rifle is made exactly to be pleasing in
[39:39] that whether it be a rifle way then it
[39:44] would have not blown up how you think
[39:47] about that people say the Christians
[39:50] would live all kind of lives people say
[39:53] they're born again and looked like the
[39:54] world people say they're born again and
[39:57] go to bars and drink and do all kinds of
[39:59] things friend I'm sorry it doesn't work
[40:00] that way
[40:01] you have to be in every way in every
[40:04] speck every dimension every part of a
[40:09] rifle of the weathering had to be
[40:10] exactly according to the specifications
[40:13] what every part of us has to be
[40:16] according every bit to the
[40:17] specifications if we don't meet these
[40:19] specifications then it's it has to it
[40:22] wasn't born in the right factory it's
[40:25] got to be born in the god factory then
[40:28] it won't blow up then it can be
[40:30] pressurized to not blow up brother BAM
[40:34] said not only converted from the Remy
[40:37] tool to a Weatherby but perverted from a
[40:40] Weatherby remington to whether we and
[40:43] that's the way we find ourselves along
[40:45] the road we find so many times that
[40:47] people just can't stand the pressure
[40:49] it's being a it's being a Christian is
[40:53] because they have never really died out
[40:55] to themselves and be reborn again made
[40:59] from the dies of God to stand below the
[41:03] pressure that comes against a real
[41:05] Christian you try to walk with a real
[41:07] saint of God and find that pressure hit
[41:10] against you like that
[41:11] you'll blow up and be back where you was
[41:13] to begin with but if you've been born
[41:15] again if you've been born again and
[41:18] really filled with God's Spirit then you
[41:21] are pressurized by God to stand the
[41:24] pressure
[41:24] that the world can put against it like
[41:27] that then you can stand the pressure
[41:29] then you can come against the pressure
[41:31] but look pressure is also something that
[41:35] can blow things up pressure is also a
[41:39] device that's used to to blow things up
[41:42] it creates such a pressure inside think
[41:46] of you know you probably think of bombs
[41:48] and stuff like that but just think of
[41:49] something simple like a balloon a
[41:52] balloon gets a lot of pressure in it but
[41:55] you know if you get past the point of
[41:58] that balloons capacity sometimes I don't
[42:02] know if you've ever done this but
[42:03] sometimes I've blown it up with helium
[42:05] and I thought just another shot of
[42:07] helium and that last little bit of shot
[42:09] of helium in the balloon boom sometimes
[42:12] I'll blow it up with my mouth I think
[42:13] just one more puff and you puff it boom
[42:16] that's it and just to all total took it
[42:19] was at its capacity you don't know that
[42:21] because you can't tell by the balloon
[42:22] but you brought that one more time in
[42:25] that boom that balloon blows up well you
[42:28] see Klee the same thing in the world and
[42:31] you think the same things with guns and
[42:35] bombs and and devices like that they
[42:38] blow up why do they blow up because the
[42:41] pressure inside gets so much that the
[42:44] container that it's in can't hold it
[42:46] anymore
[42:46] and then it blows up well think about
[42:49] what God's doing in this last day
[42:52] Hebrews chapter 12 because I want to get
[42:55] to something here on this and I get to a
[42:59] specific purpose here
[43:02] now go to go to Hebrews chapter 12
[43:09] Hebrews chapter 12 we're going to read
[43:12] that beginning with verse 25 Hebrews 12
[43:16] 25
[43:21] see that you refuse not him that
[43:24] speaketh for if they escape not who
[43:27] refused him that spake on earth much
[43:30] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[43:33] from him that speaketh from heaven whose
[43:36] voice then shook the earth but now have
[43:40] promised saying yet once more I shake
[43:43] not the Earth only but also heaven
[43:46] heaven and earth will be shaken heaven
[43:49] and earth is being shaken and this word
[43:53] get once more signified the removing of
[43:56] those things that are shaken as of the
[44:00] things are made that those things which
[44:01] cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we
[44:04] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[44:06] moved let us have grace whereby we may
[44:09] serve God except ibly with reverence and
[44:11] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[44:13] fire so what God saying God saying I am
[44:17] NOT just shaking the earth but the
[44:19] heavens also heavens and earth are being
[44:22] shaken for what purpose so that
[44:24] everything that can be shaken will be
[44:27] shaken and only the things that are
[44:30] steady in front and solid God will not
[44:34] be shaken down everything else is to be
[44:37] removed everything from your life that
[44:41] is not pleasing to the Lord is to be
[44:43] removed everything that that doesn't
[44:46] come to make you closer to him because
[44:49] the whole point is to make us more like
[44:51] him a whole thing is to get us closer to
[44:54] him you think about the pressure that
[44:56] Joe went through Joe get through this
[44:59] wine he didn't do anything wrong
[45:01] although his secret friends is his great
[45:04] friends thought he did
[45:06] the affair with ferret or Fairweather
[45:08] friends I guess you call them they say
[45:10] well he must have done something wrong
[45:11] you must know you didn't do anything
[45:12] wrong God was just proving something God
[45:15] was proving his servant and just think
[45:18] about the pressure that he went through
[45:19] God proving dis servant
[45:21] but in the end God made job closer to
[45:24] him
[45:25] God made job more like him Joe reflected
[45:30] and talked about and ended up at the
[45:32] place where he realized that what God
[45:35] didn't he because he was a child of God
[45:37] God wants everyone of us closer to him
[45:40] so all the shaking is to shake
[45:42] everything away is to shake down all
[45:45] things that have no stable foundation
[45:48] the only things that are going to remain
[45:51] after all this shaking is something that
[45:53] has a stable foundation and the only
[45:55] stable foundation there is is God I see
[45:58] Jesus Christ is the only stable
[46:01] foundation that there is you said I said
[46:04] God a lot of people say God a lot of
[46:06] people have their own gods but there's
[46:07] only one Lord Jesus Christ God Almighty
[46:11] amen
[46:13] that's his name Jesus that foundation
[46:16] that's the only foundation that will
[46:18] stand when everything else is being
[46:20] shaken so we have to be on that
[46:22] foundation pressurized pressurized to be
[46:26] able to withstand everything that comes
[46:28] out from around us so that you you
[46:31] understand friend you are predestined oh
[46:34] I want to read let me I'll read this
[46:35] scripture here in a minute
[46:36] but I'm on this thought you are
[46:39] predestined if you're a child of God you
[46:41] are predestined to a specific psi and
[46:46] that's as entirely go pounds per square
[46:50] inch you look on you tire you tile
[46:53] probably say like 35 psi that means that
[46:57] your tire is registered to accept the
[46:59] air inside it to the point of 35 pounds
[47:03] of pressure per square inch
[47:06] that's the place that God's put you God
[47:10] makes us all different some people can
[47:12] take a little bit more some people can
[47:14] take a little bit less but God knows and
[47:17] some people said well why does this
[47:18] person this way and why does that person
[47:20] have this or go through that or whatever
[47:22] God has everybody at their own specific
[47:25] psi we're not cookie cutter Christians
[47:27] I've gone through this before
[47:29] we're not cookie cutter Christians God
[47:31] hasn't stamped us all out to be exactly
[47:33] identical we're all different while
[47:36] different because we all have to play a
[47:38] different part we all have to play a
[47:40] different role we all have our things to
[47:42] do on this earth God just take the
[47:46] thoughtful ministry and pastors and
[47:49] teachers and evangelists and apostles
[47:51] and God has all those gifts for
[47:54] different reasons for different purposes
[47:58] any-any makes us all to be able to
[48:00] fulfill ministers that are called
[48:03] ministers not man called God called to
[48:05] fulfill that purpose just like we talked
[48:09] about Mother's Day last week there's a
[48:12] reason there's a purpose some people
[48:15] have one child some people two three
[48:16] four five ten twelve whatever
[48:19] different reasons God pressurizes us
[48:21] differently look at this let me read
[48:24] this
[48:27] let me read this quote to first
[48:28] Corinthians are not quote this scripture
[48:30] first Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12
[48:34] first Corinthians 10:12 wherefore let
[48:37] him that thinketh he standeth take heed
[48:39] lest he fall that there there there have
[48:44] no temptation taken you but such as is
[48:48] common to man common to man but God is
[48:53] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[48:55] tempted above that ye are able but will
[48:59] with the temptation also make a way to
[49:02] escape that ye may may be able to bear
[49:06] it
[49:06] God makes a way for you to be able to
[49:10] bear it
[49:11] God is there for you because God puts
[49:15] you in a position to be able to take
[49:18] that pressurization maybe your psi 70
[49:22] maybe the person next G is 50 maybe the
[49:26] person on the other side is 100 but each
[49:29] one God places because he knows who we
[49:31] are
[49:32] what we're able to do not do what we're
[49:34] able to take and not take God places
[49:36] that argue but yet is there to bring you
[49:40] out of it see the beautiful scripture
[49:42] God is faithful and will not suffer you
[49:46] to be tempted above that ye are able but
[49:48] with the temptation also make a way for
[49:52] you to escape now think God uses this
[49:55] pressure you can think in terms I've
[49:59] used this a knowledge before the terms
[50:00] of a toothpaste tube if you take and
[50:03] take the cap off a full toothpaste tube
[50:06] and you squeeze it in the middle well
[50:08] water is going to squeeze out because it
[50:11] can't take the pressure the pressure
[50:12] comes and it goes and squirts out or
[50:16] that just makes room of the tube and and
[50:19] this end of the tube the toothpaste
[50:21] binds up together closer and the
[50:23] pressure on the end of that tube becomes
[50:25] greater
[50:26] but what do they do they don't squirt
[50:28] out they bind together well the same
[50:32] pressure that God puts to cause now this
[50:36] may sound wrong to people but in
[50:39] Scripture
[50:39] the same pressure that God would put he
[50:42] puts on certain people to leave because
[50:46] they're not predestined they're not born
[50:48] again they're not ones to receive the
[50:51] truth they're not once it's been
[50:53] pressurized they're not once it's been
[50:56] born to get a fill of God's Spirit so
[51:00] God uses the pressure sometimes to move
[51:03] that person out but the same pressure
[51:06] uses to move some people out is the same
[51:09] pressure he uses to draw us closer to
[51:12] him to become more like him it's the
[51:15] same question he's might one move away
[51:18] from the other looks and it brings some
[51:21] closer to him that's what God wants from
[51:24] us you think about the the eagle the
[51:27] eagle is pressurized to be able to go
[51:29] into the heavens but God won't pressure
[51:31] God won't put anything beyond your psi
[51:36] God won't put anything on you tempt you
[51:39] above what your psi is that God is going
[51:43] to be there to take care of that for you
[51:45] and help you through it in every way now
[51:48] some people think I'm closing here but
[51:50] some people think well I can't stand the
[51:54] pressure to take pressure off of me but
[51:57] that's not scriptural either it's not
[52:00] scriptural to ask for God to take the
[52:02] pressure off let's look at st. John
[52:05] chapter 17 it's going to be my last
[52:08] scripture here today st. John chapter 17
[52:13] look at this st. John 17
[52:16] we'll begin with verse 15 look what
[52:18] Jesus prayed now Jesus has said yeah
[52:21] here interceding
[52:23] praying he says I pray not st. John
[52:27] 17:15 I pray not that thou should has
[52:30] take them out of the world but that thou
[52:33] should has keep them from the evil they
[52:37] are not of the world even as I am NOT of
[52:40] the world sanctify them through thy
[52:44] truth thy Word is the truth
[52:46] so what Jesus praying for us he says
[52:51] father I pray that you not take them out
[52:53] of the world
[52:54] don't take the pressure off just help
[52:58] them be able to bear it
[53:00] help them keep them from the evil one
[53:04] so it's not scripture to say God take
[53:06] all this pressure off now I can't stand
[53:08] this pressure yes you can if you're a
[53:10] Christian you're born again God would
[53:13] not put it on you if you couldn't bear
[53:14] it if you're a Christian God puts on you
[53:17] for a reason so don't say you can't
[53:20] because you can God put it there for a
[53:23] reason do you have to believe that hold
[53:26] it to your heart
[53:27] so he says don't take them out of it but
[53:30] help them through it so our prayer
[53:33] shouldn't be God take me out of this oh
[53:35] I can't stand this thought I can't bear
[53:37] this any longer
[53:38] yes you can't or he would have put it on
[53:40] you I can't say no say God just helped
[53:44] me get through it
[53:44] help me Lord I mean during that tunnel
[53:48] is it you can't even see the light at
[53:49] the end of there's a light there you
[53:51] know there is because you've gone
[53:52] through cleaning of tunnels yourself to
[53:54] know you know there's a light there you
[53:56] might not be able to see it but you know
[53:58] it's there and you see God just I don't
[54:01] want you to take me out and just help me
[54:02] through it there's a reason I'm in this
[54:05] position
[54:06] I'm a reason there's a reason I'm in
[54:08] this place god you're trying to
[54:10] pressurize me somehow to get me ready to
[54:14] bring me closer to you to make me more
[54:16] like you Lord to get me in the position
[54:19] that when it's your time to come and
[54:21] call me home whether it's by rapture or
[54:23] by the grave whatever it is that I'll be
[54:26] ready to go but friend that same
[54:29] pressure that we're asking God take me
[54:32] through the same pressures it's gonna
[54:33] put a bride in the rapture one day amen
[54:36] I believe it is we're gonna pressurize
[54:38] her out of here it's gonna bring her to
[54:42] the place of being pressurized you just
[54:45] like the eagle I just said just like the
[54:47] eagle to be pressurized the eagle
[54:49] there's no other bird can go that high
[54:51] like an eagle Hawk Falcon try to go up
[54:54] you disintegrate but a eagle its
[54:58] feathers are put in and its body is
[55:00] built to the place then it can go up
[55:02] into a heavens beyond the human sight
[55:05] sometimes I've set one time in Florida
[55:08] fishing on the end of brother Wayne's
[55:10] dock and I sitting there fishing
[55:12] enjoying my time of the Lord and an
[55:15] eagle comes off a tree I thought wow
[55:17] that's just beautiful and I take my eyes
[55:20] off for a minute watching the fishing
[55:22] and on I look up and that Eagles just
[55:24] circling and circling if this actually
[55:26] happened there eagle is circling and
[55:28] circling you know what they're doing I
[55:29] thought my that thing is just beautiful
[55:31] and I was fishing again and I look up
[55:34] again and I fish not look up and all of
[55:36] a sudden I'm looking up and that Eagles
[55:38] just circling and circling and circling
[55:39] and before I know it I can't even see
[55:41] him anymore
[55:42] he literally circled out of my sight I
[55:45] could not see it I watched him Circle up
[55:47] there I could not see him anymore
[55:49] because he's built for that
[55:52] he's pressurized to be able to see
[55:56] beyond things that other birds can't see
[55:59] God's putting us in heavenly places
[56:03] bringing us higher and higher as our
[56:06] consecration is to him like we said at
[56:08] the beginning of the service as our
[56:09] consecration is to him he's bringing us
[56:12] higher in those heavenly places to see
[56:15] things the rest of the world in Christ
[56:17] that the rest of the world can't see
[56:20] he's pressurizing us to be able to see
[56:23] that we are pressurized to be in those
[56:26] heavenly places to the rest of the rest
[56:28] of the world can't see them the rest of
[56:30] the world don't understand those things
[56:32] the rest of the world don't get those
[56:34] revelations of the word through the love
[56:36] letter God gave us they don't see those
[56:38] if Fred it it evolves beyond the brother
[56:43] branham said it brings you into that
[56:48] relationship with Jesus to work God is
[56:50] whispering sweet nothings to you not
[56:54] brother Branham said you nothing wrong
[56:56] with what brother and I said I'm not
[56:58] going beyond that I'm just saying if
[57:01] your only relationship is what brother
[57:03] Brown said you don't have a relationship
[57:05] your relationships with a dead man not
[57:09] with Jesus Christ I want my relationship
[57:11] with a risen Savior you get in those
[57:13] heavenly places friend you'll see those
[57:15] things that's the place of brother
[57:17] Branham got to then he employed every
[57:19] one of us to get to him it doesn't take
[57:23] some special gift you don't have to
[57:24] speak in tongues or have some prophecy
[57:26] or somebody say something over you you
[57:28] are if you're born again and you're a
[57:30] child of God you are in the place to be
[57:32] pressurised to get to that to where God
[57:35] reveals those things to you see things
[57:38] that the rest of the world they're not
[57:40] pressurized to see it they're not gonna
[57:43] see it
[57:44] the PSI that you're built to brings you
[57:46] to the place that you can handle those
[57:48] things amen
[57:50] that'll take you up in the rapture oh
[57:53] I'm so thankful friend God is working on
[57:57] us God hasn't give up on us
[57:59] he's still working on us he's bringing
[58:02] to that place and we continue to work
[58:04] for him
[58:05] now I know so many people and I'm just
[58:09] gonna skip this quote I know so many
[58:11] people and I keep hearing all the time
[58:13] everybody seems to be focusing on this
[58:15] coronavirus thing is the end all do all
[58:17] I just personally I don't I don't feel
[58:20] that way about it I know there's a lot
[58:23] of stuff going on I think I just believe
[58:26] this earth is preparing itself the
[58:28] government's everything is preparing
[58:29] itself to get into the tribulation the
[58:31] mark of the beast is getting itself to
[58:34] that place but you know what if we're
[58:37] here another 5 10 years she can
[58:39] understand that I believe this may be
[58:42] the last year but what if it's not I
[58:44] mean I thought that 20 30 years ago or
[58:48] so every year that I entered - I feel
[58:52] the same way but what if it's not what
[58:55] if it is another 10 years then we got a
[58:57] job to do it's another day God give us
[59:00] to do something for him another moment
[59:03] God's give us to be pressurized to be
[59:06] able to stand all of the wiles of the
[59:08] devil and everything that comes around
[59:10] is to be able to perform and to live to
[59:13] God's purpose whatever that is the
[59:17] purpose now you know part of it here I
[59:20] guess with the word of God Tabernacle is
[59:21] work still in our homes this
[59:24] stay-at-home order is lifted though that
[59:27] that's all been lifted we're going to
[59:29] get to the place that we're gonna have
[59:32] our own place of worship again and come
[59:34] together again Lord willin june 7th so
[59:39] we're getting ourselves to that place
[59:41] but there's something that God wants
[59:43] every one of us to do and that that part
[59:46] I'm not singing some great stratospheric
[59:50] supernatural whatever I whatever a
[59:54] little simple thing it is just like the
[59:56] little wash woman just like the little
[59:58] handbag whatever it is big small doesn't
[1:00:02] matter all pressurise to different PS is
[1:00:04] God's got it but your part is just as
[1:00:07] important as the next person's part just
[1:00:11] as important do you think my part was
[1:00:15] just as important as brother premise yes
[1:00:18] just as important because we're all a
[1:00:21] part of the same body of Jesus Christ
[1:00:22] you know one member is gone the whole
[1:00:25] body is maligned the whole body is
[1:00:29] deformed if one portion of it is out of
[1:00:31] whack it's out of kilter one portion
[1:00:34] that could be your portion we got to
[1:00:37] continue to do the part that God put us
[1:00:38] to and what he wants us to do and be
[1:00:41] that ready for when then when he calls
[1:00:43] us the rapture then we'll be ready to go
[1:00:46] be go home to be with him again praise
[1:00:51] the Lord
[1:00:51] so just continuing to member and
[1:00:53] remember in prayer don't ask God to take
[1:00:56] the pressure off of you just ask him to
[1:00:58] help you through it
[1:00:59] Lord just get me through it I know you
[1:01:02] wouldn't have put this on me if I wasn't
[1:01:03] able so you just get me through it Lord
[1:01:05] and help me God will do that I'll help
[1:01:08] you through it you just gotta remember
[1:01:10] trust him he meant a lot of to remember
[1:01:13] a lot of people explode a lot of people
[1:01:15] leave because he can't take
[1:01:17] but God has that there for a purpose
[1:01:19] amen praise the Lord god bless you I
[1:01:22] pray something was said to bless you
[1:01:23] today now Lord willing next Sunday we'll
[1:01:27] have another stream service like this
[1:01:29] one
[1:01:29] the following Sunday me and my wife's
[1:01:31] that is me and my wife 35th anniversary
[1:01:33] May 31st so there's a good chance we've
[1:01:36] been talking about getting out of town
[1:01:37] for that Sunday so we may not be here
[1:01:40] what I might do is is record something a
[1:01:43] little bit ahead of time or maybe an
[1:01:45] extra midweek or something for you for
[1:01:48] that Sunday always remember brother
[1:01:50] Roger streams from his place and he's
[1:01:53] been using brother Daniels facility on
[1:01:55] Saturday nights and Sunday mornings at
