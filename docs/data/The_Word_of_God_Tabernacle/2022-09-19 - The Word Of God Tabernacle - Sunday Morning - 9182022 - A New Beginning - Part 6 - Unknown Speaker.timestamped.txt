[27:14] Tabitha wrote a praise report here I
[27:16] want to read to you says I asked for
[27:18] prayer for a little uh a little while
[27:21] back for a friend who had an uh
[27:25] Echo topic pregnancy that needed to be
[27:29] surgically removed and lost one of her
[27:32] tubes during the process they've been
[27:35] praying for another child for a while
[27:37] before this happened and she is now
[27:40] three months pregnant with a baby boy
[27:43] Amanda so praise the Lord anybody
[27:45] remember that prayer request about this
[27:47] baby this situation amen and Lord now
[27:50] blessed him with a babe another baby
[27:52] three months
[27:54] three months pregnant with a baby boy so
[27:56] praise the Lord amen wonderful God is
[27:59] good isn't he amen the answer 's prayer
[28:01] so thankful Micah had a couple of
[28:04] testimonies he wanted to
[28:06] bring to our teacher too
[28:12] um so if
[28:13] most of y'all are here some of you are
[28:16] not when I asked a special request that
[28:18] I did off camera due to the nature of
[28:20] the information but the uh the mother of
[28:23] the daughter of surrounding situation uh
[28:25] is regaining custody of her
[28:29] um and I can because I work next door so
[28:31] I see him past my window every day
[28:33] and you can see the change that they're
[28:34] both much happier
[28:36] so I want to thank the Lord to continue
[28:38] moving in that situation whatever the
[28:41] Lord would have done with
[28:43] with all of that
[28:44] and for some weird the other day I was
[28:49] making tea and I had a Boiling Pot of
[28:51] water and so I was going to put it in
[28:53] this little tea maker that strains the
[28:55] water out after it's brewed and I was
[28:57] pouring the water in and in my head I
[29:00] was like I'm gonna end up pouring this
[29:02] on my hand like this but I have no other
[29:04] way to do this over the scene so
[29:06] really careful and the water I ended up
[29:09] pouring some on my hand I got ready to
[29:11] jerk away but it didn't hurt
[29:13] I I have no idea how it didn't hurt how
[29:17] it didn't burn me because it was
[29:19] literally boiling rolling boiling water
[29:21] that was pouring into something and
[29:24] poured it onto my hand and there was no
[29:26] pain no burn no redness
[29:28] so I don't know what happened but I
[29:32] wanted it other than those
[29:38] velocity
[29:39] financially and with work and everything
[29:42] and I upgraded my phone after four years
[29:45] of having it
[29:47] I needed to upgrade and then I was like
[29:49] I just don't want to pay a whole lot of
[29:52] money and then Verizon had a special and
[29:53] I happened to catch it during that
[29:54] special so a little things that the Lord
[29:56] does
[29:57] good things amen
[30:00] praise the Lord amen
[30:02] amen he didn't say it but I don't guess
[30:04] he Minds be telling them but you know he
[30:07] hasn't been working how long you been at
[30:08] that place now eight months since March
[30:12] silence he said six months boss already
[30:15] gave him a raise
[30:17] a raise
[30:18] and 30 percent of
[30:20] part of the agency
[30:24] this trip is coming up
[30:27] amen
[30:29] and it asked me the Lord because she
[30:33] the the agency continues to be extremely
[30:36] profitable even though they hired me
[30:38] even though we paid for new computers
[30:40] upgrade our internet and we're still the
[30:42] Lord's just blessing us and she's happy
[30:45] to share that with people she's very
[30:46] generous so I want to thank the Lord and
[30:49] I I wasn't originally going to say this
[30:51] but it's on my heart again
[30:53] a
[30:54] I wasn't always good with paying my
[30:56] tithes
[30:57] and that's I've always had it in my head
[30:59] I can't afford to but a brother once
[31:02] said you can't afford not to so I told
[31:04] the Lord that if he continues to help me
[31:07] get back on my knees I will be diligent
[31:10] and I have and he's blessed terrible
[31:15] amen praise the Lord
[31:18] [Applause]
[31:20] amen monetary yes but not all momentary
[31:24] too
[31:25] water on your hand could have been a
[31:27] hospital doctor bill you know
[31:29] God Watches Over Us in every way doesn't
[31:31] he amen it's the only place in the
[31:34] scripture where God says prove me and
[31:36] see if I won't do what I said I'll do
[31:38] only place amen prove me try me
[31:42] that's the truth uh we had this uh
[31:45] request of prayer for uh this lady Grace
[31:48] in North Carolina that Dave Williamson
[31:49] had sent in I thought I'd give you the
[31:52] other update since we're doing the
[31:53] praise reports uh the one that was sent
[31:56] in now this isn't Dave this is what was
[31:58] sent to him so this afternoon she Grace
[32:01] was talking
[32:03] complaining about her hair being a mess
[32:06] and wanted to get up and walk around for
[32:08] a while
[32:09] uh
[32:10] I think that's for ADHD kicking in if
[32:13] there is one thing for sure Grace is
[32:15] going to come through this with all the
[32:17] great determination she's got she's a
[32:19] fighter more than likely she'll be moved
[32:22] out of the ICU in a few days in a
[32:24] regular room Whenever there is an
[32:26] available bed I will update uh room
[32:29] number and all this stuff but anyway
[32:30] that's the main update of her condition
[32:33] now a woman that just over a week ago
[32:36] was in a self-induced coma medically
[32:39] induced coma
[32:41] and not expected to live
[32:43] so God is mindful don't tell me he's not
[32:47] a miracle working God
[32:49] amen people say oh that's just medicine
[32:51] oh she got to the hospital oh she got to
[32:53] the doctor friend we know the great
[32:55] physician yes amen you can get people to
[32:58] doctors all day long and the doctor will
[33:00] look and say there's nothing more we can
[33:01] do how many times you hear Brother
[33:03] Brown's testimony doctors come and say
[33:04] people come to him and say there's
[33:06] nothing more the doctors can do but then
[33:09] Dr Jesus steps in amen praise the Lord
[33:12] that's when things change amen that's
[33:15] when things are made right
[33:17] praise the Lord it's good isn't it he's
[33:20] so good

[39:51] Last Stand to our feet if we could we're
[39:53] going to go over to the Book of Genesis
[39:55] again we're going to continue with the
[39:57] thought we had
[39:59] um
[40:00] past few weeks past month and a half or
[40:03] so the new beginning this will be part
[40:05] six I'm gonna get into the atonement
[40:07] today
[40:09] um thought we'd be able to try to finish
[40:10] it in one service but the more I studied
[40:14] on it and the more I went it was not
[40:15] going to be possible to do it in one
[40:17] service so uh we'll probably again sort
[40:21] of maybe like last week maybe a little
[40:23] short of service today
[40:25] based on that uh for them and then
[40:28] brother Noel's coming next week so it
[40:30] will be the following week after that
[40:32] the first Sunday in October that Lord
[40:34] Willem will try to finish this but just
[40:37] trust in the Lord's helping all of it so
[40:39] and your patience and love and prayers
[40:41] which makes the difference too amen
[40:43] Genesis chapter 1 verse one before we
[40:45] read let's bow our heads for another
[40:47] word of prayer if we could
[40:49] Precious Jesus father it's a privilege
[40:51] to be here today thanking you so much

[41:10] beautiful day Lord I pray that you would
[41:12] have complete control of this service

[41:17] Spirit Lord would come once again with
[41:20] power and demonstration yes and do the
[41:23] exceeding and abundantly above all that
[41:24] we could ever ask or think anoint these
[41:27] lips Lord anoint the hearers and
[41:29] whatever you have purposed in this
[41:30] service today that would be accomplished
[41:32] as we commit it to you thank you for it
[41:34] Lord we just know God that without you
[41:37] none of this would be possible but we
[41:40] committed to you with all the all the
[41:42] love in our hearts that we can give Lord
[41:43] because you are absolute you are all in
[41:47] all we love you we thank you he would
[41:49] praise you today we committed now to
[41:52] your hands the main part of the service
[41:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[41:56] pray amen
[41:59] Genesis chapter 1
[42:02] verse 1 in the beginning God created the
[42:05] Heaven and the Earth
[42:07] the Earth was without form and void and
[42:09] darknesses upon the face of the deep the
[42:11] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[42:13] waters you could be seated if you like
[42:17] it's good to see each other Angel amen
[42:20] missed you buddy
[42:22] your family of course love you all amen
[42:25] so welcome
[42:26] you're welcome you look familiar to me
[42:29] if I see if I met you
[42:34] would I would there have been an
[42:35] occasion that I would have met her maybe
[42:36] your sister's funeral or something I
[42:38] mean you look familiar to me you have
[42:40] you been here
[42:41] okay well welcome anyway so yeah I
[42:44] appreciate you being here today
[42:46] Leviticus now we're going to go over to
[42:48] Leviticus chapter 23 try to pick up
[42:51] where we left off last time
[42:53] Leviticus 23 we went in Fairly good
[42:56] detail the first few feasts here we're
[42:59] going to go through this uh this Feast
[43:01] of atonement this uh sixth feast
[43:06] because there's a there's a great more
[43:08] detail uh in this Feast of course than
[43:11] the typhoons from the Old Testament and
[43:13] from the Jewish tradition to the
[43:15] spiritual application the bride the
[43:18] Gentile bride
[43:19] um and and just showing the goodness of
[43:23] God Amen the grace of God
[43:25] amen you know if you're rely upon works
[43:28] there's no Grace but if you're expecting
[43:30] God's grace then works are then works
[43:32] are done away with amen even though we
[43:35] work we don't work to Salvation we work
[43:37] because we work in obedience to God's
[43:39] word we don't work towards our Salvation
[43:42] our salvation's already paid for amen
[43:44] that's by his grace so we don't work to
[43:47] salvation but we trust in God's goodness
[43:50] and God's mercy and God's grace and the
[43:52] blood of Jesus Christ so uh the Jews
[43:55] eventually come to that place
[43:58] the Jews come to the place that they
[44:00] rely upon that as well they recognize it
[44:02] and and that's what this atonement is
[44:04] all about there's a six-fold uh now if
[44:07] you've gone and you were able to if you
[44:09] forgot to understand but if you were
[44:11] able to listen to Gabriel's six-fold
[44:12] Vision to Daniel then uh a lot of this
[44:15] will be very familiar to you although
[44:17] there are some things
[44:19] I'm not going to say is outside of what
[44:21] brother Brannon preached but something
[44:23] the Lord revealed to me so
[44:26] um I just pray that it's the Lord's will
[44:28] and it's a blessing to you so we'll
[44:30] start back at the 23rd verse though
[44:32] Leviticus 23-23
[44:36] um and we'll read through this Feast of
[44:38] atonement because remember the Feast of
[44:40] atonement comes in continuity or or
[44:43] together with the Feast of the trumpets
[44:45] it took the Feast of the trumpets to
[44:48] bring Israel back together again so that
[44:51] there could be an atonement because
[44:53] again I will reiterate God does not
[44:57] bless Israel outside their Homeland
[45:00] the only time God blesses His People
[45:02] Israel is in their Homeland the only
[45:04] time God deals with them is when they're
[45:07] in their Homeland so they had to have
[45:09] the seven trumpets to bring them back
[45:10] and remember these seven trumpets
[45:12] sounded what under our Sixth Seal which
[45:16] is the time that we're living now that's
[45:17] about to break loose in its fullness on
[45:20] this world uh through the tribulation uh
[45:23] these Seven Seals reconcile them back
[45:25] home again and they are home again
[45:27] remember we talked about uh their
[45:29] nationality and their flag and their
[45:31] currency and recognized by now what is
[45:34] called the United Nations as a nation so
[45:37] they that fig tree is in full bloom
[45:39] Saints we're not looking forward to
[45:40] bloom it is in full bloom so but that
[45:44] Feast of trumpets had to happen before
[45:46] there could be an atonement so God could
[45:48] deal with them so this 23rd verse now
[45:51] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[45:54] speak unto the children of Israel saying
[45:56] in the seventh month in the first day of
[45:59] the month again which is October uh
[46:01] their first month their seventh month is
[46:04] October the first day of the seventh
[46:06] month shall you have a sabbathy memorial
[46:08] blowing of trumpets and holy convocation
[46:10] you shall do no several work therein but
[46:13] ye shall offer an offering made by fire
[46:15] unto the Lord
[46:17] and the Lord speaking to Moses saying
[46:19] also on the tenth day of this seventh
[46:23] month now remember that atonement
[46:26] immediately follows those trumpets but
[46:29] there is a space of time
[46:32] amen there's the 10 days see a lot of
[46:35] times people forget about the seven days
[46:37] Nobles on the ark they forget about some
[46:40] things like these 10 days even though it
[46:42] was immediately following this now
[46:43] because that was to take place it was
[46:46] immediately falling but there is that
[46:47] space of time to where the trumpets blow
[46:50] Israel gets back in their Homeland
[46:51] before this atonement sets in and that's
[46:55] the lat that's the want to me that's the
[46:58] winding up of this last age and this
[47:01] Gentile Pride that's about to go home to
[47:04] the wedding supper that's this this is
[47:06] the winding up that last little bit of
[47:09] period that last 10 days is that last
[47:12] little bit of period that God's still
[47:13] dealing with the Gentiles getting ready
[47:16] to go back to the Jews already going
[47:18] back to the Jews we feel that anointing
[47:20] remember going that God's dealing but
[47:22] there is that period of time so that I
[47:25] believe and again I will tell you to me
[47:27] I believe we're in that period of time
[47:30] I do I believe that we are in that
[47:33] period of time between this between this
[47:35] fifth feast and this sixth Feast between
[47:38] the Feast of the trumpets and the Feast
[47:39] of the atonement
[47:41] the tenth day of the seventh month there
[47:44] shall be uh shall be a day of atonement
[47:47] it shall be in holy complication unto
[47:50] you and ye shall afflict your souls
[47:51] listen this very closely now he goes
[47:53] into some detail about this that is that
[47:56] is unrelated to the other Feasts
[47:59] ye shall afflict your souls and offer an
[48:03] offering made by fire unto the Lord well
[48:06] what is this afflicting their souls it
[48:08] is a time of Sorrow
[48:10] is the time of Affliction it's it's a
[48:12] time of reflection and repentance is
[48:14] what it is
[48:15] amen it's a repentance that Israel falls
[48:18] into that place of repentance to God
[48:21] they're sorrowful for what they're doing
[48:23] amen or what they did
[48:25] so they afflict their souls make a an
[48:28] offering of fire unto the Lord ye shall
[48:30] do no work in that same day for it as a
[48:32] day of atonement to make an atonement
[48:34] for you before the Lord your God for
[48:37] whatsoever Soul it be that shall not be
[48:40] afflicted in that same day he shall be
[48:44] cut off from among his people
[48:46] and whatsoever shall it be that doeth
[48:49] any work in that same day the same soul
[48:52] will I destroy from among his people you
[48:55] shall do no manner of work it shall be a
[48:57] a statute forever throughout your
[49:00] Generations in all your dwellings it
[49:02] shall be unto you a Sabbath abreast you
[49:04] shall afflict your souls
[49:07] in the ninth day now this was to start
[49:10] on the tenth day but remember the the
[49:12] noon day before starts that next day so
[49:16] the ninth day at uh the ninth day of the
[49:19] month of that seventh month at even from
[49:21] even unto even shall you celebrate that
[49:24] Sabbath or this day this Feast of
[49:26] atonement this afflicting of your souls
[49:29] this time of repentance now in
[49:32] reflecting on this time of atonement
[49:35] that we're going to start into and take
[49:38] the next couple of services on this
[49:41] reflection of atonement now I think we
[49:44] all kind of have an understanding of
[49:46] what uh an atonement is or to to to
[49:50] atone for something uh to to make amends
[49:55] or to make a uh to to make a wrong right
[49:59] amen that's what repentance is about
[50:01] that's what forgiveness is is for to try
[50:05] to make a wrong right to try to make
[50:08] amends somehow to atone for something
[50:12] that had been done uh erroneously before
[50:14] if something had been done done
[50:16] erroneously before and a person comes to
[50:19] an understanding that what they did was
[50:21] wrong they go to that person to ask to
[50:25] be atoned for so that their egregious
[50:28] actions would be forgiven them
[50:31] would be done away so that that would
[50:34] not be held against him anymore so this
[50:37] forgiveness is very important of course
[50:38] the repentance is the first the first
[50:40] part that's the most important thing the
[50:43] Forgiveness the Forgiveness brings about
[50:45] the atonement and that atonement is
[50:48] where God sets things straight with his
[50:51] people
[50:51] uh this is where God makes things right
[50:55] the the Jews is people and them they
[50:58] come together to make the things that
[51:00] have been done wrong correct and right
[51:02] to make amends for them amen so that
[51:06] they can be so that they can be atoned
[51:08] for so that they can recognize the
[51:11] atonement itself now the atonement was
[51:14] to be received should have under perfect
[51:18] condition would have been received by
[51:20] the Jews back when Christ came
[51:22] they would have recognized their Messiah
[51:24] they would have saw him as their messiah
[51:26] in the atonement that was made there
[51:28] from the very beginning the atonement
[51:31] was to be made and Jesus Christ come to
[51:34] be that atonement to be the one to take
[51:36] the place to right the wrong only Jesus
[51:40] Christ could have been the one to right
[51:42] the wrong he's the only one that could
[51:44] do it because every other man remember
[51:46] over in Revelation 5 there was no man
[51:49] worthy to take that book no man Jesus
[51:52] Christ the Lamb of God was the only one
[51:54] worthy of he was the only one worthy to
[51:57] take that book well what was in that
[51:59] book it was the names of the atoned
[52:02] those that will be those that were to
[52:04] have atonement done for them whose names
[52:07] were in that book
[52:09] I believe my name's there you
[52:11] Amen to be atoned for that atonement was
[52:15] to come from Christ was the only one
[52:18] worthy to take that float for atonement
[52:20] to atone for them praise the Lord so he
[52:24] was the only one that could do it no man
[52:25] could do it Moses couldn't do it John
[52:28] the Baptist couldn't do it all the great
[52:29] man that comes none of them could do it
[52:31] had to be Jesus Christ God's only
[52:33] begotten son that come on this Earth to
[52:36] make atonement and under perfect
[52:38] conditions the Jews would have
[52:40] recognized the Messiah that they had
[52:42] been looking for and praying for for
[52:43] thousands of years
[52:45] but their eyes were blinded we'll get to
[52:47] that part in a few minutes they could
[52:49] not recognize
[52:51] their Messiah they could not recognize
[52:53] this perfect atonement but that didn't
[52:55] do away with the atonement amen that
[52:58] didn't do away with atonement that just
[53:01] postponed the atonement for a different
[53:03] time that's why the trumpets had to
[53:05] bring them back together so that they
[53:07] could now eventually and were on the
[53:10] edge of it now received that atonement
[53:12] it meant to be atone to atone for their
[53:16] mistakes to atone for their wrongdoings
[53:18] now at this time
[53:22] God is dealing with them he has already
[53:25] taken the Gentile bride home in a
[53:28] Rapture of catching away however someone
[53:30] wants to bring the terminology catching
[53:32] away Rapture some people get funny about
[53:35] Rapture because they say oh it's not in
[53:36] the Bible Well it's the same word catchy
[53:39] if you say catching away it's the same
[53:41] phrase same word comes in the definition
[53:43] catching away God takes his Gentile
[53:46] Pride who he's been dealing with now for
[53:48] seven Church ages through that Feast of
[53:51] the wave loaf amen the Feast of
[53:53] Pentecost through that time God's been
[53:55] dealing with the Gentiles he's going to
[53:57] take her home to the wedding supper
[53:59] but at that for that three and a half
[54:01] years that tribulation sets in that last
[54:04] half of the 70 weeks of Daniel the last
[54:07] three and a half years that is to be uh
[54:10] that is to be the atonement for the Jews
[54:12] the Gentile bride God is done with and
[54:15] is moved into the into the Palace of God
[54:17] to a wedding supper now at the end of
[54:21] that wedding supper at the end of that
[54:23] time
[54:24] God then comes back and reveals himself
[54:27] to his people now look what brother
[54:29] Graham said about it in the first seal
[54:32] he said they didn't know now brother
[54:34] random he types this to to Joseph the
[54:37] story of Joseph we all know the story of
[54:39] Joseph and how God reveals him how God
[54:42] how Joseph revealed himself to his
[54:44] brother he put away the Gentile bride so
[54:47] that he could reveal himself to his
[54:49] brother because remember even then God
[54:51] only dealt with one at a time so he put
[54:54] the Gentile bride away done dealing with
[54:57] her at the moment to deal with his with
[55:00] his brother the the Jews so
[55:03] even then God only deals with one at a
[55:05] time even in the story of Joseph God was
[55:07] only dealing with one of them at a time
[55:09] right amen while the wife was in the
[55:11] palace he was dealing with his Brethren
[55:13] when he was away from his brother he was
[55:15] with his wife amen
[55:18] there and the revealing of himself to
[55:20] his brother was to be without the
[55:23] Gentile or removing or out beyond the
[55:26] camp as the Bible would say from the
[55:29] from
[55:31] Joseph revealing himself to his brother
[55:33] and that's where the story is picked up
[55:35] here
[55:36] he was uh talking to an interpreter
[55:40] Joseph was acting like he was an
[55:43] Egyptian sea and when it was made known
[55:45] he wanted to make himself known
[55:48] he kept looking at little Benjamin at
[55:51] 144 000 group that's my addition that's
[55:54] not in the quote that little 144 000
[55:57] that God promised out of Revelation 7.
[56:00] remember he dismissed his wife she was
[56:04] in the palace when he made his self
[56:07] known to his brother now look friend
[56:11] this is very important because this is
[56:13] about to take place now I don't have a
[56:16] day I don't have a time I don't have a
[56:17] month I don't have a year that's God's
[56:19] timing whenever he desires I just
[56:21] believe that we're in this season right
[56:23] we're at that time right now amen
[56:26] looking for our loved ones to appear at
[56:28] any time amen ready for a Rapture she
[56:31] was in the palace when he made himself
[56:34] known to his Brethren only one at a time
[56:36] and the Gentile bride the wife after
[56:40] Jesus being rejected by his own people
[56:43] he had taken a gentile bride and will
[56:46] take her from here to a palace in a
[56:50] Rapture to his father's house in glory
[56:53] for the wedding supper that's what's
[56:55] ahead for the bride a wedding supper
[56:58] amen that's where we go looking for that
[57:01] time when God comes wipes all the tears
[57:04] out of their eyes sets everything wrong
[57:06] that's right amen make everything your
[57:08] strongest right in the wedding supper
[57:10] and then continuing on with a quote now
[57:13] and we'll slip back down amen from that
[57:17] supper slip back down to make himself
[57:20] known to his Brethren the hundred and
[57:23] forty four thousand that little Benjamin
[57:25] group amen reveal himself to the 144 000
[57:29] win at the end of the marriage supper so
[57:33] as they go through the tribulation and
[57:35] Revelation 11 unfolds itself which I was
[57:37] going to read but uh forsaken time uh
[57:40] maybe next time we'll see uh through
[57:43] Revelation 11 where the two witnesses
[57:45] come Moses and Elijah and and all that
[57:48] unfolds with them recognizing what's
[57:51] going on and and see that that that
[57:54] I keep thinking momentum but that Spirit
[57:57] unfolding itself amen it's it's like God
[58:01] doing that quick work that quick
[58:04] powerful work for the Jews at that time
[58:06] unfolding itself
[58:08] um
[58:09] it began with that process
[58:13] and with that process came a recognition
[58:16] by the Jews that of what was going on
[58:20] they didn't realize it in its complete
[58:23] fullness until after Christ himself
[58:26] slipped down from the Gentiles and came
[58:29] and revealed himself to them personally
[58:32] amen people say the Jews will accept the
[58:35] message yes they will because Jesus
[58:38] Christ is the message
[58:40] and they will receive Christ he is their
[58:43] message amen and they'll look upon him
[58:45] and they'll realize what they had done
[58:47] and then they'll start mourn and they'll
[58:49] lament and they will and they will
[58:51] repent and and they'll they'll they'll
[58:56] work for that atonement in forgiveness
[58:59] for that atonement amen now look though
[59:02] let's go over to Daniel
[59:05] and see the things the that get into
[59:09] that six-fold purpose now
[59:13] of Gabriel's Vision to Daniel
[59:16] of the atonement that is to take place
[59:21] the only thing up to this time
[59:25] there's a few places in the scripture uh
[59:28] Exodus Leviticus especially where
[59:31] there's a reference to atonement
[59:33] but I want you to recognize something
[59:35] here that had came to my attention that
[59:39] I didn't recognize but that atonement
[59:43] there
[59:44] is different in the New Testament or how
[59:47] we know it today than it was in the Old
[59:50] Testament
[59:51] in the Old Testament atonement was
[59:55] put in a definition by men that come up
[59:59] with an understanding of what that
[1:00:01] definition would be and for the Old
[1:00:03] Testament before Jesus Christ came the
[1:00:06] perfect atonement that word atonement
[1:00:08] was simply covering or to cover up
[1:00:13] that's that's in the Old Testament
[1:00:15] that's what their atonement was because
[1:00:17] the blood we know that in the New
[1:00:19] Testament the Bloods of bullying goat
[1:00:21] bulls and goats could not make man clean
[1:00:24] it could not separate man from sin it
[1:00:27] could not wash away or annihilate sin
[1:00:30] all it did was cover it thus the
[1:00:33] atonement that they lived under in the
[1:00:36] Old Testament the old Torah was simply a
[1:00:39] covering for their sin it made it okay
[1:00:41] in God's eyes but it wasn't acceptable
[1:00:43] to God for for complete forgiveness
[1:00:46] there they had to receive the the
[1:00:49] perfect atonement Jesus Christ now we
[1:00:52] know atonement is something different to
[1:00:55] be atoned for as someone who took our
[1:00:57] place he atoned for us by taking our
[1:01:00] place in the Old Testament it didn't
[1:01:03] happen that way it was simply a covering
[1:01:05] and if you go look at the definitions
[1:01:07] you see atonement there just means
[1:01:09] covering but but in this atonement where
[1:01:14] it involves not bulls and goats it does
[1:01:17] not involve uh it involve animals and
[1:01:20] sacrifice of animals it involves the
[1:01:23] Jewish race receiving their Messiah unto
[1:01:27] themselves as that perfect atonement
[1:01:30] they receive him not not not an animal
[1:01:33] but Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] that brings not the Old Testament
[1:01:39] atonement of covering up but the new
[1:01:41] reality of the blood of Christ in that
[1:01:43] atonement annihilating sins
[1:01:46] not just covering it but divorcing you
[1:01:49] completely from sin so much so then in
[1:01:52] the Book of John it says that you that
[1:01:54] are born of God cannot commit sin
[1:01:58] praise the Lord
[1:02:00] because of the soul of man we know that
[1:02:02] we've gone over that cannot commit sin
[1:02:05] so much that atonement is so powerful
[1:02:07] friend it divorces you so much
[1:02:10] from darkness is from light
[1:02:13] it takes the it takes the red stain of
[1:02:16] sin and bleaches it white so that you
[1:02:18] can't even find it you can go back to
[1:02:20] the annals of the creation of that stain
[1:02:23] in your garment and it cannot be found
[1:02:25] by Satan or God or no one praise the
[1:02:28] Lord because his blood annihilates it
[1:02:30] that atonement does away with it not
[1:02:33] just cover
[1:02:34] praise the Lord the perfect atonement so
[1:02:37] I wanted to lay that as an understanding
[1:02:40] as we go through now Daniel chapter 9.
[1:02:45] Daniel chapter 9 verse 24.
[1:02:51] it's all just in this one verse
[1:02:57] Daniel 9 24.
[1:03:00] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[1:03:04] and upon thy Holy City
[1:03:07] for what purpose
[1:03:10] what's the point and remember the first
[1:03:14] three and a half of this is done through
[1:03:16] Jesus Christ Ministry
[1:03:18] and if we read the other portion of the
[1:03:21] scripture we see that in the midst of
[1:03:24] that atonement in the midst of that 70
[1:03:27] weeks is cut off
[1:03:30] so we have three and a half left and you
[1:03:32] go back to Revelation 11 again we talked
[1:03:35] about the three and a half years you go
[1:03:36] back to several places Revelation 12
[1:03:38] Revelation 11 where it talks about uh
[1:03:41] that 1203 score days has three and a
[1:03:45] half years I believe if I didn't get
[1:03:47] that number wrong it's exactly three and
[1:03:49] a half years by the Julian calendar of
[1:03:51] 30 days in a month 360 days in a year
[1:03:54] that's exactly three and a half years
[1:03:56] it's the remaining part of that three
[1:03:58] and a half years but notice that first
[1:04:01] half was under Jesus Christ's Ministry
[1:04:03] well
[1:04:04] Jesus Christ Ministry and Jesus Christ's
[1:04:07] life and giving his life was to be that
[1:04:10] perfect atonement that they were
[1:04:12] supposed to receive
[1:04:14] but he got caught off in the midst
[1:04:16] because they crucified him they didn't
[1:04:19] accept him they crucified him which
[1:04:22] we'll get to amen that cut it off in the
[1:04:24] mid so there's that three and a half
[1:04:26] that's still left
[1:04:28] well there's 70 weeks
[1:04:31] for the purpose of
[1:04:33] and let's read them
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:37] to finish the transgression
[1:04:41] make an end of sins
[1:04:44] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:04:48] and to bring in Everlasting
[1:04:50] righteousness
[1:04:52] and to fill up the vision and prophecy
[1:04:55] and to anoint the most holy now I want
[1:04:58] to get to as many of these as I can
[1:05:00] today but it's very unlikely that I kind
[1:05:03] of already pretty much set my mind we'll
[1:05:04] just do the first three if the Lord
[1:05:05] willing and time allows uh we'll just
[1:05:08] try to get through the first three uh
[1:05:10] the last two are probably the longest
[1:05:13] actually to get into but the first two
[1:05:15] are probably the most prominent ones so
[1:05:19] out of the issue cd6 these six finish
[1:05:22] the transgression make an end of sin
[1:05:24] make reconciliation for iniquity bring
[1:05:27] an everlasting righteousness cell
[1:05:28] division and prophecy anoint the most
[1:05:30] holy
[1:05:31] amen that's that six volt six-fold
[1:05:34] purpose Vision that Gabriel brings to
[1:05:37] Daniel here we just read That's six-fold
[1:05:40] now first one is
[1:05:42] to finish the transgression what was
[1:05:45] that transgression
[1:05:47] the transgression was Israel's blindness
[1:05:50] they did not recognize their Messiah
[1:05:52] their blindness well and God was to come
[1:05:56] to open their eyes to finish this
[1:05:59] blindness the the finish the
[1:06:01] transgression now we know uh a
[1:06:04] transgression is something that you do
[1:06:05] that you shouldn't do is to transgress a
[1:06:09] law or or a statute of something uh if
[1:06:13] you go and see the
[1:06:16] speed limit on the road is 45 and you go
[1:06:18] 50 you've transgressed that law
[1:06:22] you you
[1:06:24] 've come against that law to the point
[1:06:27] of being punished
[1:06:28] that's what the trend what a
[1:06:30] transgression is
[1:06:32] but God came through this to finish that
[1:06:37] transgression or that transgression no
[1:06:40] longer exists even in the mind of God to
[1:06:43] finish that transgression so let's go to
[1:06:45] it Romans chapter 11.
[1:06:53] Romans chapter 11 the blindness that
[1:06:57] Israel had was the transgression
[1:07:00] they would not have tried I don't
[1:07:02] believe now they would not have
[1:07:04] transgressed had they not been blind
[1:07:09] God allowed
[1:07:12] I take this stance
[1:07:14] and it may be a little different from
[1:07:16] some others
[1:07:18] but I kind of watched my verbiage here
[1:07:23] God allowed God sends a spirit of
[1:07:28] something let's just start there
[1:07:31] God if God sends the spirit or allows a
[1:07:34] spirit of something to come about let's
[1:07:37] just say even in our life
[1:07:39] if a spirit of something come now you
[1:07:42] are a free world agent
[1:07:44] you can receive that Spirit you can act
[1:07:47] upon it and you can do whatever that
[1:07:50] Spirit motivates you to do or not
[1:07:54] you don't have to do what this spirit is
[1:07:57] come on you to cause you or wants you to
[1:08:01] do you can reject that spirit
[1:08:04] God allowed his people Israel he allowed
[1:08:09] them to be blinded but to me how are
[1:08:12] they blinded they were blinded because
[1:08:14] and I have scriptural I can show
[1:08:16] scripture that that substantiates my
[1:08:18] belief here now but that God allowed
[1:08:22] them to be blind I know it says a spirit
[1:08:25] he sent them the Spirit of Slumber their
[1:08:27] eyes would not see and that thing but
[1:08:29] that that Spirit of that moved on them
[1:08:33] they allowed in their lives because
[1:08:36] their eyes were focused on something
[1:08:38] else
[1:08:39] they weren't expecting their Messiah to
[1:08:42] be born on the hepal of a cow's dung
[1:08:47] they weren't expecting their King and
[1:08:50] their Messiah to be born in a manger in
[1:08:53] a stable like an animal in a barn
[1:08:56] they weren't expecting that so when he
[1:08:58] comes forth they didn't even see him
[1:09:00] they couldn't even when he started to do
[1:09:03] the Miracles even when he was preaching
[1:09:05] now there are some of course that
[1:09:07] received it they were predestined to
[1:09:08] receive it and or they they shut that
[1:09:12] that that spirit
[1:09:14] amen because that Spirit came on all of
[1:09:17] them but it did not affect all of them
[1:09:21] did it
[1:09:23] that Spirit didn't affect all of them it
[1:09:25] didn't affect his disciples it didn't
[1:09:27] affect Paul and didn't affect a lot of
[1:09:29] the ones that came through at that time
[1:09:30] most of them it did
[1:09:32] most of the leaders
[1:09:35] most of the ones that were in charge
[1:09:36] most of the piety and the hierarchy it
[1:09:39] affected them they allowed that spirit
[1:09:41] because they had the Torah now this is a
[1:09:45] danger point now I'll tell you then
[1:09:46] people get into this today
[1:09:48] with this message they get it so figured
[1:09:52] out that when God does it a different
[1:09:54] way they miss it entirely yeah
[1:09:56] they don't see it they're blinded to it
[1:09:59] yes you see where I'm going they're
[1:10:01] blinded to it because they're so fixed
[1:10:03] on it's got to be like this God is gonna
[1:10:06] do what brother Bradham said
[1:10:09] yeah well there's nothing wrong with
[1:10:10] what he said there's nothing wrong with
[1:10:11] this scripture but there is a whole lot
[1:10:13] wrong with a lot of our understandings
[1:10:15] of it
[1:10:17] amen you can't have it so fixed in your
[1:10:19] mind that when God really does move or
[1:10:22] God really does fulfill a scripture God
[1:10:24] really does do it his way we miss it
[1:10:28] we got to be pliable and have our eyes
[1:10:30] open and expect it whatever God wants to
[1:10:32] do for it he can do it however he wants
[1:10:34] to do it he can do it if he brings a
[1:10:36] meal along to do it he can do it yeah
[1:10:40] yeah amen If he if he wants to speak
[1:10:42] through a mule to get his point across
[1:10:45] he'll do it right right he's done it
[1:10:47] before right
[1:10:48] yeah amen
[1:10:49] he could cause a wart to fall off your
[1:10:51] head and speak to you
[1:10:53] yeah amen
[1:10:56] anything God wants to do you can take
[1:10:59] your shoes off tonight your socks and
[1:11:00] your big toe talk to you tell you
[1:11:02] something
[1:11:03] now people might want to put you in the
[1:11:05] 13th floor of the hospital but
[1:11:08] God can do anything he wants to do
[1:11:10] that's why I know it's kind of sublime
[1:11:11] there but God my point is God can do
[1:11:14] anything he wants to do amen anytime he
[1:11:16] wants to do it let him do it don't get
[1:11:18] it so fixed in your mind don't get it so
[1:11:20] the words gotta be this where it's no
[1:11:22] way at all and then you miss it yeah
[1:11:24] yeah I believe that's what they were
[1:11:26] facing at that
[1:11:27] when God said that they were so fixed
[1:11:30] that when he came they missed him all
[1:11:32] together and when he done the Miracles
[1:11:34] it made him matter when he gave him
[1:11:36] ministering it made him matter when he
[1:11:39] told him I'm a man sin for God it made
[1:11:41] him so mad they put him on a cross
[1:11:45] even when he was producing the things
[1:11:47] the scripture said the Messiah would
[1:11:49] produce they hated him that much more
[1:11:51] for doing it right
[1:11:53] right you see how that Spirit could how
[1:11:55] that spirit is today
[1:11:57] amen against anybody that wants to try
[1:12:00] to do something good it seems like
[1:12:01] there's a spirit of hatred
[1:12:04] I want to call your name or put you in
[1:12:06] some kind of category of a you're just a
[1:12:08] horrible person because you do things
[1:12:10] that are so good
[1:12:12] that's just the mentality well that's
[1:12:14] the way they were with you they treated
[1:12:16] him that way and that's how they acted
[1:12:18] toward him and they and they missed him
[1:12:19] all together they missed it
[1:12:22] now with that background let's read this
[1:12:25] Hebrew Romans chapter 11.
[1:12:28] uh this
[1:12:31] oh my God
[1:12:34] there's so much in this chapter let's
[1:12:36] just go to the 25th verse
[1:12:40] it talks about the Wild Olive Tree and
[1:12:42] the team Olive Tree and and the the Wild
[1:12:45] Olive Tree Heaven branches of the tamola
[1:12:47] tree having branches broken off of it
[1:12:49] and then the wild olive tree branches
[1:12:52] were were tied into it to that root and
[1:12:55] that's a wild olives and Gentiles the
[1:12:57] tame olives and Jews and and God
[1:12:59] grafting in those Gentiles into that
[1:13:01] same Tree by that same root and that
[1:13:04] same root is Jesus to live off that same
[1:13:06] life 25th verse though see for I would
[1:13:10] not brother that ye should be ignorant
[1:13:12] of this mystery lest ye should be wise
[1:13:14] in your own conceits
[1:13:16] that blindness impart amen blindness and
[1:13:21] that that that blindness
[1:13:23] is
[1:13:25] obviously something that's a covering
[1:13:29] it's a shield
[1:13:31] amen uh you have different blindnesses
[1:13:34] today you have a blindness of someone
[1:13:37] who has no eyes
[1:13:39] you have a blindness of someone that has
[1:13:41] eyes but can't see
[1:13:43] you have a blindness of someone that has
[1:13:46] eyes and can see a little bit but are
[1:13:49] considered legally blind
[1:13:51] but you also have a blindness of
[1:13:55] covering
[1:13:57] if somebody puts a covering over your
[1:13:59] head you can't see
[1:14:01] you're blind you're not blind in the
[1:14:04] sense you have no eyeballs you're blind
[1:14:06] in the sense that you can't see what's
[1:14:08] in front of you because of the shield
[1:14:10] and that's the definition of this
[1:14:12] blindness
[1:14:14] they're covered there's a shield there's
[1:14:16] a covering to where they can't see not
[1:14:19] that they're not capable of seeing but
[1:14:22] there's something there that's causing
[1:14:24] them or keeping them from being able to
[1:14:26] see it that's that Spirit of Slumber
[1:14:28] through their imaginations of how God
[1:14:31] was going to the Messiah was going to
[1:14:32] come that covering that blindness again
[1:14:36] now in part now that means just
[1:14:39] temporary that means that blindness of
[1:14:42] that covering is there to accomplish
[1:14:44] something for a short period of time and
[1:14:46] it did
[1:14:47] it made the Jews not recognize their
[1:14:49] Messiah and crucify him and cut him off
[1:14:52] in the middle of the 70 weeks so the
[1:14:54] Gentile bride could be brought in and
[1:14:56] that's what we've been dealing with for
[1:14:58] seven Church ages
[1:14:59] and then from the day of Pentecost
[1:15:01] through that Feast of the wave loath
[1:15:03] that Feast of Pentecost to today God's
[1:15:06] been dealing with the Gentiles it's
[1:15:07] getting ready to fall back over amen so
[1:15:10] it's in part the blindness in part it's
[1:15:13] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:15:16] the Gentiles become in and when the
[1:15:19] fullness of the Gentiles be come in what
[1:15:22] happens to her she goes in the rapture
[1:15:25] she goes home amen
[1:15:28] 26 verse and so all Israel
[1:15:32] shall be saved as it is written there
[1:15:35] shall come out of Zion the deliverer and
[1:15:37] he shall turn away ungodliness from
[1:15:39] Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them
[1:15:41] when I shall take away their sins
[1:15:46] take away their sins now the finishing
[1:15:51] of that transgression
[1:15:53] brings us to what the taking away of
[1:15:57] their sins what is sin
[1:16:00] unbelief what did they not believe they
[1:16:03] didn't believe Jesus
[1:16:04] they were slumbered from it they were
[1:16:06] blinded from it they were their eyes
[1:16:09] were covered they couldn't see
[1:16:11] but Jesus came God
[1:16:14] this is my Covenant
[1:16:16] that I shall take away their sin
[1:16:19] the end of the transgression finishing
[1:16:22] of the transgression or the blindness
[1:16:26] two
[1:16:28] the taking away of their sin
[1:16:32] now what's the second thing
[1:16:34] the number two thing on the on the
[1:16:36] atonement the six-fold purpose Dan uh to
[1:16:38] Daniel to make an end of sin
[1:16:43] praise the Lord
[1:16:45] Amen to make an end of sin now what is
[1:16:48] sin remember sin is unbelief
[1:16:52] making an end of the fact that they did
[1:16:55] not believe Jesus Christ was their
[1:16:58] Messiah
[1:16:59] make an end of that sinner what did he
[1:17:02] say here he's going to take away their
[1:17:04] sin
[1:17:06] make an end of their sin that was the
[1:17:08] number two on the six-fold purpose so
[1:17:11] that they could recognize what they did
[1:17:14] what was their sin what was such a great
[1:17:17] sin that Israel did that brought about
[1:17:20] this in their in their lives and
[1:17:22] remember God deals with Jews as a group
[1:17:26] amen he deals with the Gentiles as
[1:17:28] individuals he deals with the Jews as a
[1:17:30] group
[1:17:31] what did they do that was so horrible
[1:17:33] that put them under this curse for 2 000
[1:17:36] years
[1:17:37] rev of Matthew chapter 27.
[1:17:45] Matthew chapter 27 To verse 24.
[1:17:51] let's start with the 22nd verse Matthew
[1:17:53] 27 22.
[1:17:57] this great sin of unbelief
[1:18:00] pilate saith unto them what shall I do
[1:18:03] then with Christ with Jesus which is
[1:18:06] called Christ
[1:18:08] they all say unto him let him be
[1:18:10] crucified
[1:18:12] now that's a great sin
[1:18:14] their unbelief LED them to killing in
[1:18:16] the most horrible way their very Messiah
[1:18:19] that they've been praying for for
[1:18:21] thousands of years it caused them to to
[1:18:24] actually sin unbelief
[1:18:27] to the point that they cried out to to
[1:18:30] pilate who was trying to let the man go
[1:18:34] his wife even told him said don't you
[1:18:36] dare have anything to do with this
[1:18:37] righteous man right she told him amen
[1:18:40] and like a man they don't listen to
[1:18:41] their wives
[1:18:42] I don't know why we're just done that
[1:18:44] way she wouldn't he wouldn't listen to
[1:18:46] his wife and he got involved anyway but
[1:18:48] she told him don't you dare have nothing
[1:18:49] and he washed his hands and then and we
[1:18:52] know scripturally there's no way the
[1:18:54] Bloods of Christ will ever be all part
[1:18:55] of the team yeah
[1:18:57] amen Through Time Eternity that blood
[1:18:59] will always be on his hands and his wife
[1:19:01] told him don't do it he did it anyway
[1:19:04] so he comes out and gets involved said
[1:19:06] what what do you want me to do with this
[1:19:08] man they uh this is the time that I can
[1:19:11] release any prison unto you let me just
[1:19:13] give you this man I tested my pride him
[1:19:16] he's a good man he's a righteous man
[1:19:17] he's done nothing wrong what do you want
[1:19:20] me to do with him let him be crucified
[1:19:23] didn't matter
[1:19:25] they were judged during an executioner
[1:19:27] all they wanted was to get rid of him
[1:19:30] amen great sin Saints let him be
[1:19:33] crucified and the governor said why what
[1:19:36] evil has he done
[1:19:38] but they cried out the more saying let
[1:19:40] him be crucified they didn't care if
[1:19:42] you've done evil or not they couldn't
[1:19:44] care they couldn't care if they could
[1:19:45] prove it or not
[1:19:47] sounds a lot like a judicial system
[1:19:49] today doesn't it yeah when they hate
[1:19:50] your friend they come at you with all
[1:19:52] blazes dog uh gun barrels blazing
[1:19:56] they're going to take you out if they
[1:19:58] have any chance at all and they don't
[1:19:59] care if you're guilty or not they hate
[1:20:01] you and if they hate you they want you
[1:20:04] crucified
[1:20:05] let him be crucified when pilate saw
[1:20:08] that he could Prevail nothing but rather
[1:20:10] a Tolman or an uproar now this caused an
[1:20:13] uproar uh
[1:20:15] burning down cities and stuff causing
[1:20:18] uproar was made
[1:20:19] he took water washed his hand before the
[1:20:22] multitude saying I'm innocent I know
[1:20:24] you're not of the blood of this just
[1:20:27] person see you to it then answered not
[1:20:30] just let him be crucified
[1:20:32] but he said they said let his blood be
[1:20:35] on us and on our children
[1:20:38] on our posterity on the ones in our
[1:20:43] loins that have yet to be born let his
[1:20:45] blood be on us and it's been there ever
[1:20:47] since
[1:20:48] amen that sin has been on them for over
[1:20:52] 2 000 years now
[1:20:55] and it's still there today it's about to
[1:20:57] be trans it's about to be forgiven uh
[1:21:02] it's about to be atoned for when they
[1:21:04] recognize it and they asked repentance
[1:21:07] oh
[1:21:08] just love the grace of God
[1:21:10] oh
[1:21:12] my friend or would any of us be today
[1:21:14] but for the grace of God God sending
[1:21:18] Grace it's also in Romans 2. I
[1:21:22] we read Romans 11 you go back and see
[1:21:25] that God extends to a people that lived
[1:21:29] by the operation of Works to Salvation
[1:21:31] he sent them Grace
[1:21:34] when there's no Grace in words
[1:21:37] and their whole lives their whole
[1:21:39] attitudes everything they did was about
[1:21:41] Works to the works of salvation
[1:21:45] and yet God still extends them their his
[1:21:48] grace
[1:21:49] think about Cain
[1:21:52] God himself told Cain if you'll do well
[1:21:55] I will accept you the very serpent seat
[1:21:58] of the Devil Himself right The Serpent
[1:22:01] and God said I'll accept you
[1:22:06] my friend
[1:22:08] is the grace of God is so powerful
[1:22:11] but they said let his blood be on us and
[1:22:16] thousands of years
[1:22:18] but there's about to come an atonement
[1:22:21] there's about to come a Reconciliation
[1:22:23] there's about to come or the the end of
[1:22:26] that sin is made now what is
[1:22:30] what brings about Sin
[1:22:33] sin I believe brings about uh an
[1:22:37] iniquity which is doing something you
[1:22:39] know you should not do or not doing
[1:22:42] something you know you should do I
[1:22:44] shouldn't Equity goes both ways
[1:22:46] if you look in the Bible the definition
[1:22:48] tells its lawlessness
[1:22:51] well what is lawlessness lawlessness uh
[1:22:54] effectively in its simplest form is
[1:22:56] doing something you shouldn't do
[1:22:58] but it's also not doing something you
[1:23:00] know you should do
[1:23:02] that's iniquity lawlessness so that
[1:23:05] iniquity so what is the third thing you
[1:23:07] can look back in it if you want to I
[1:23:09] just read it to you if you kept your
[1:23:10] place in Daniel there but the third one
[1:23:13] which is probably the last one we'll be
[1:23:14] able to get to today the third one is to
[1:23:17] make reconciliation for iniquity make
[1:23:21] reconciliation for iniquity to reconcile
[1:23:24] now another thing here to realize in the
[1:23:28] Old Testament versus the new verses
[1:23:30] before Christ after Christ Our common uh
[1:23:34] normal English language to reconcile is
[1:23:37] to bring two back together again
[1:23:39] Amen in its simplest form if two people
[1:23:42] are broken up they become reconciled
[1:23:44] they come back together again
[1:23:46] impossible I know the I know it says
[1:23:49] that in the Old Testament it says it but
[1:23:51] the definition of reconcile in the Old
[1:23:54] Testament is not to bring the two
[1:23:57] together again
[1:23:58] it simply it simply reverts back to the
[1:24:02] word atonement to make atonement for
[1:24:04] which is just covering or to cover
[1:24:08] but the true definition and sense of
[1:24:11] reconciliation or to be reconciled in
[1:24:14] our understanding scripturally by Christ
[1:24:16] today is that Christ and man have come
[1:24:20] one again
[1:24:23] that's what it means to be reconciled
[1:24:25] the two have become one there were one
[1:24:28] in the Garden of Eden
[1:24:29] sin by sin man fell there was a Breaking
[1:24:33] of God and man there was a great Chasm
[1:24:35] thrown between God and man
[1:24:37] but Jesus Christ bridged that Chasm with
[1:24:40] his own blood so that God and man could
[1:24:43] come back and fellowship again
[1:24:44] reconciled
[1:24:46] so when it's so reconciliation of the
[1:24:49] Jews they're high it can't be by their
[1:24:53] old law
[1:24:54] there had the reconciliation can only be
[1:24:58] by the Messiah that they crucified that
[1:25:00] we just read about
[1:25:01] that's the only way that them and God is
[1:25:04] his people can come back again as one
[1:25:06] like they were in the Garden of Eden
[1:25:08] even better if you will
[1:25:11] even better
[1:25:13] in the Garden of Eden man was uh was
[1:25:15] created amen he was just a flesh man now
[1:25:19] God and man had become one so much he's
[1:25:22] put his life in us the old God's Own Zoe
[1:25:26] literal life of God now lives in you and
[1:25:29] I right those that are born again
[1:25:32] that is even greater than when it was
[1:25:35] with Adam and Eve reconciled and he's
[1:25:38] doing that with his people
[1:25:40] to bring a Reconciliation for what they
[1:25:43] should not have done in the beginning
[1:25:45] they recognize their Messiah
[1:25:47] they recognize what they did they
[1:25:49] recognize uh that they crucified their
[1:25:52] very Messiah let's go over to Zechariah
[1:25:54] I'll finish it with this
[1:25:59] Zechariah Chapter 12.
[1:26:02] could be
[1:26:07] Zechariah Chapter 12
[1:26:09] now we'll start with verse 9.
[1:26:14] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:26:19] that I will seek to destroy all the
[1:26:21] nations that come against Israel we know
[1:26:23] all nations will come up against Israel
[1:26:25] uh at that time during the tribulation
[1:26:28] God said you'll come against them and I
[1:26:31] will pour upon the House of David
[1:26:35] and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:26:39] the spirit of Grace and of supplications
[1:26:42] again a people that lived to their
[1:26:46] salvation by words God's going to pour
[1:26:48] His grace on them
[1:26:50] amen and of Supplication and they shall
[1:26:53] look upon me whom they have pierced
[1:26:56] look upon him what He Slipped Away now
[1:26:59] he has slipped away at the end of the
[1:27:02] marriage supper got to the end of the
[1:27:04] three and a half years of tribulation He
[1:27:06] Slipped Away and he's gone down to his
[1:27:08] people again
[1:27:10] and they look upon me whom they have
[1:27:13] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[1:27:17] one mourneth for his only son and shall
[1:27:20] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[1:27:22] in bitterness for his firstborn
[1:27:25] I know that bitterness
[1:27:27] but that bitterness is what they're
[1:27:30] going to receive when they recognize who
[1:27:32] he is
[1:27:33] no more blind no more covering that
[1:27:37] period of impart that time frame that
[1:27:39] the impart they were to be blind is gone
[1:27:42] it's removed it's over they've reached
[1:27:44] the place of atonement the day of
[1:27:47] atonement this Feast of atonement that
[1:27:50] is going to reconcile for their iniquity
[1:27:53] bring them back one and they recognize
[1:27:56] him and they will remember
[1:27:57] and they and they're sorrowful and they
[1:27:59] repent amen God loves your repentive
[1:28:03] heart Saints
[1:28:04] they repent
[1:28:06] and they recognize who he is and in that
[1:28:08] day there shall be a great morning in
[1:28:10] Jerusalem as the morning of
[1:28:12] uh hadadrium
[1:28:15] in The Valleys of megidon
[1:28:18] and that uh and the land shall mourn
[1:28:21] every family apart the family of the
[1:28:23] House of David apart and their wives
[1:28:25] apart without the family of the House of
[1:28:27] Nathan apart and their wives apart
[1:28:28] family and half the Levi apart their
[1:28:30] wives apart Family of shimiah his part
[1:28:33] and their wives apart the families that
[1:28:35] remain every family apart and their
[1:28:37] wives apart but look at the 13th chapter
[1:28:40] first verse
[1:28:42] in that day
[1:28:43] praise God
[1:28:45] there will be a fountain open in the
[1:28:48] House of David
[1:28:51] to the Jewish people in the House of
[1:28:54] David there will be a fountain on who is
[1:28:57] this Fountain anybody want to guess who
[1:28:59] this Fountain is
[1:29:01] the praise the Lord his name is Jesus
[1:29:05] he's the one his name is Jesus he's the
[1:29:08] only one
[1:29:09] Jesus that Fountain will be open in the
[1:29:12] House of David and to the inhabitants of
[1:29:14] Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
[1:29:18] they because they recognized him then he
[1:29:21] will cleanse and make clean anybody who
[1:29:25] recognizes and repents and comes to him
[1:29:28] anybody
[1:29:30] if you believe it now if you don't
[1:29:32] believe it you're just an unbeliever an
[1:29:34] unbelieved to sin you're just a sinner
[1:29:37] but if you believe in an accept it which
[1:29:39] they're doing they repented and they put
[1:29:41] on sackcloth and Ashes and they repent
[1:29:43] and they recognize who he was and they
[1:29:45] and they come before him and that and
[1:29:47] God opens up this fountain
[1:29:50] this Fountain called Jesus who is full
[1:29:53] of love and grace accepts them and
[1:29:56] forgives them and ends the uh uh the the
[1:29:59] transgression the end of sin and the and
[1:30:03] reconcile them for that iniquity
[1:30:05] it was the iniquity that drove them
[1:30:07] apart
[1:30:09] it was iniquity that drove them apart
[1:30:11] because they did something they
[1:30:13] shouldn't have done
[1:30:15] but God is making reconciliation to
[1:30:17] bring them together let's drop down in
[1:30:20] the 13th chapter I'll close with this
[1:30:22] I will got a couple more scriptures in
[1:30:24] that Zechariah 13
[1:30:27] beginning with the sixth verse
[1:30:30] and one shall say unto him
[1:30:33] what are these wounds in thy hands
[1:30:36] then he shall answer those with which I
[1:30:40] was wounded in the house of my friends
[1:30:43] he was sent to the lost sheep of the
[1:30:45] House of Israel
[1:30:46] amen that's what he said
[1:30:48] he was called that Gentile serial woman
[1:30:51] a dog
[1:30:52] because she was there wanting Healy for
[1:30:54] her daughter
[1:30:55] you think oh how unjust no no
[1:30:58] no unjust is man's justice system
[1:31:01] Justice real true is God's justice amen
[1:31:04] and he called her a dog because she saw
[1:31:07] healing for her daughter
[1:31:09] but she was so desperate she finally got
[1:31:12] it
[1:31:13] and he said be it unto you
[1:31:15] amen be it unto you according to your
[1:31:19] your desires and she went home and found
[1:31:21] her daughter well
[1:31:23] but he was sent to the house of Israel
[1:31:25] his friends
[1:31:27] and those are the ones that pierced him
[1:31:29] we just read it let him be crucified and
[1:31:31] let his blood be on us and our children
[1:31:34] awake old sword against my shepherd and
[1:31:36] against the man that is my fellow Seth
[1:31:40] the Lord of hosts might this Shepherd
[1:31:41] and the Sheep shall be scattered and I
[1:31:44] will turn my hand upon the little ones
[1:31:46] and that's exactly what they did
[1:31:49] they scattered the sword was laid upon
[1:31:52] them in judgment and they scattered all
[1:31:55] throughout the world that they could go
[1:31:56] at the time they scattered all
[1:31:58] throughout the world that's why God had
[1:32:00] to bring them back together
[1:32:02] but when they did that God said I'll
[1:32:04] turn my hand unto those little ones it's
[1:32:06] 144 000 the little Benjamin group
[1:32:09] Revelation 7 again
[1:32:11] and it shall come to pass that in all
[1:32:13] the land saith the Lord two parts
[1:32:15] therein shall be cut off and died but
[1:32:18] the third shall be left therein and I
[1:32:21] will bring the third part through the
[1:32:23] fire and will refine them as silver is
[1:32:25] refined and will try them as gold as
[1:32:27] tribe and they shall call on my name and
[1:32:30] I will hear them I will say it is my
[1:32:32] people and they shall say the Lord is my
[1:32:35] God
[1:32:36] amen so the Jews go through the
[1:32:39] tribulation
[1:32:41] amen they go through that period of time
[1:32:44] they said it says they will be refined
[1:32:47] as silver is refined they will be tried
[1:32:49] as bold as tried
[1:32:51] why because they rejected him
[1:32:54] you say well the the Gentile go the
[1:32:58] bride go through no no no the church
[1:33:00] goes through that but not the bride
[1:33:02] she's received his atonement she's
[1:33:04] accepted him she's been filled with his
[1:33:06] Spirit she's been married to him now she
[1:33:09] belongs to him and he takes her home not
[1:33:12] he's not going to beat her up and then
[1:33:13] take her home
[1:33:15] the broad doesn't arrive at the marriage
[1:33:17] supper with a broke leg and a black eye
[1:33:20] amen amen and so I told you the other
[1:33:24] day about this the persecution squeezing
[1:33:27] stuff and people believe well they want
[1:33:28] to believe that's okay I got my own
[1:33:29] beliefs but I don't believe and I can
[1:33:32] show you in the scripture and a quote
[1:33:34] that God is not going to marry her and
[1:33:37] then beat her up so that she can go to a
[1:33:39] supper
[1:33:40] just go to the supper in a wheelchair or
[1:33:43] on crutches or with a black eye broke
[1:33:44] legs amen she is his beloved
[1:33:50] he takes her home and then all this down
[1:33:53] here Breaks Loose it's a tribute
[1:33:56] all the foolish virgin
[1:33:58] the Jews they all go because why they
[1:34:00] did not receive to the point of
[1:34:02] receiving the Holy Spirit the atonement
[1:34:05] to themselves before that time
[1:34:08] amen now there'll be some that will like
[1:34:11] the Jews during that time absolutely
[1:34:13] they'll see him they'll receive him just
[1:34:16] like the rep the witnesses of Revelation
[1:34:18] 11 they are killed lay in the streets
[1:34:20] and after a few days they rise up and
[1:34:22] they're resurrected they're raptured
[1:34:24] last Rapture of the Bible
[1:34:28] that happens to them
[1:34:30] but the bride she goes home in a Rapture
[1:34:32] before that takes place
[1:34:34] before all but chaos the real chaos and
[1:34:37] tribulation there's judgment going on
[1:34:39] friend we talked about that
[1:34:41] Sixth Seal is Unleashed it's going on
[1:34:43] now it's not broken it's totality yet
[1:34:46] but it will be but it can't be until God
[1:34:50] takes his wife home
[1:34:52] if God's gonna beat his wife up a bit
[1:34:54] why doesn't he just let her go through
[1:34:56] the tribulation then
[1:34:59] it doesn't happen that way right that's
[1:35:01] God's God loves your Saints amen he
[1:35:04] married you for a reason he's found you
[1:35:06] to be virtuous holy righteous without
[1:35:09] spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:35:11] because you've put on his righteousness
[1:35:14] amen we don't go through that time amen
[1:35:17] foolish virgin and all Jews they do
[1:35:20] because they they're the ones that have
[1:35:23] to be refined the bride is already
[1:35:25] refined she's already been found not
[1:35:27] guilty she's already been found in
[1:35:30] Perfection What Refinery does the bride
[1:35:33] need to go through when she's without
[1:35:34] spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:35:37] it's like a woman taking out a a dress
[1:35:41] shirt out of the closet that is
[1:35:43] absolutely perfectly pressed and try to
[1:35:45] iron the thing well what are you ironing
[1:35:47] for there's no wrinkles
[1:35:48] what's the point of ironing it if you
[1:35:51] want it to be warmer just stick it in
[1:35:52] the microwave or something put a oven I
[1:35:55] wouldn't leave it in there long but
[1:35:57] if you want it to be warm why would you
[1:35:59] iron something that has no wrinkles
[1:36:01] why do you refine something that's
[1:36:03] perfect
