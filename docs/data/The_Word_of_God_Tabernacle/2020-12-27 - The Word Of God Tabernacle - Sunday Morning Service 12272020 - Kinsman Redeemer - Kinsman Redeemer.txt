yes amen [Music] amen [Music] there's quite a few or two or three i should say so from uh sister shelia she asked that um we keep sister uh crystal mario who's experiencing her years her year of first without brother joel who passed on earlier this year from covid um her birthday was the 25th of december is that correct okay so same day as christmas so i'm sure that was a pretty difficult day for her yeah just ask that the lord would comfort her and uh she also asked that we pray for javi's girlfriend and uh which is selena's mom so that her name is selena and her mom so javi's girlfriend and her mother um so they both came up with uh positive covet test results uh earlier this week or yesterday so i want to remember them and sister shariah assal javi and his girlfriend uh over christmas i believe it was this so just a few days ago so that's why they decided to stay home today just in case you know they may have been you know contracted the virus but we just pray that the lord would protect them and you know from the sickness amen and another one from sister olivia as well she has a prayer request for herself she woke up with a scratchy throat and cough hoping it's just the allergies and you know that's why she didn't want to come in today just in case you know she doesn't want to affect anyone else if she has anything and also uh praise um for her sister uh her sister esther was released from the hospital yesterday after being readmitted uh for tests she is doing well and she thanks sarah went for their prayers i also want i remember sister lydia as well and uh there's more to sister sharaya's uh prayer request here now let me see so she was with uh javi and his girlfriend and her mom uh which were test positive for covid uh she was also with someone else who uh potentially was exposed to covid uh last week so uh they've been kind of sick and out uh the past couple weeks uh she's just praying that the lord would uh touch their family uh this morning uh does anyone else have a spoken prayer request yes bro that second one brother is roberta baggett oh okay roberta okay that is angela baggett's mother-in-law okay is roberta baguette old faggot's wife okay so we want to remember most everybody here knows the baggage sorry yeah at least that's the way i read it she said that angela's mother-in-law which would be roberta baggett so just so everybody's clear to understand because like i said every pretty much everybody in here mostly knows the baggage pearl and roberta baguette so yeah thank you brother yes so we do want to remember the bag and family in prayer as well so it seems that they've also tested positive for covid i'm not sure when but i just want to remember them too does anyone else have a spoken prayer request yes um i think she's like 12-ish elena she was rushed to the hospital history around 30 because she was starting to talk and wasn't incoherent and then she started drifting in and out of consciousness and she's been in the er all night trying to figure out what happened because spinal taps on her ct scans and now she's getting uh i think it's to check your brain to make sure they think she had a seizure but she's only like 12 or 13 years old what's her name elena okay so a friend of tabatha's daughter elena had a series of medical issues going on with her what was it yesterday yeah yesterday so uh they're testing her they don't know what's wrong with her they think she may have had a seizure for those of you who did not hear so just want to remember the lord to touch her and ask the world to touch her this morning anyone else have spoken yes okay thank um i believe it too so we just want to remember my wife uh prayer too just still having some some deals of uh unknown um i don't want to say sickness i don't want to claim anything on her but she's just having some odd symptoms here and there i just want the lord to to fully remove them all and i believe he is he's working on her yes amen um anyone else have a prayer request they want to mention to the church this morning if we could all just stand as we go to the lord and if we want to lift up our hands if we have an unspoken prayer request and just and the act of faith you know the lord is going to touch whatever need we have on our minds of hearts this morning uh brother dennis would you mind just taking these needs of lord please lord jesus we bow our heads and thankfulness for what you have done for us at calvary knowing without you we are nothing without you will surely fail but father you died on the cross and you gave us life and now we could stand as believers and say i can do all things through christ which strengthens me and father there are many requests of sickness even several that have coveted 19 and and in our sister that has problems something said she don't know what she's dealing with but above all we know you lord you are our great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with their stripes we are healed and father we don't take anything from the devil from our enemy we endure you satan in the name of our lord jesus christ to leave god's people to stay away from god's property we believe complete and total deliverance for each and every one that needs a healing touch and needs a uh encouragement and needs financial uh assistance whatever we have need of you we know by faith you are that everlasting fountain oh that shall never run dry and we come and dip our hands and drink to our our fullest content knowing father you don't want to see a defeated church you you want to see a church with power with with faith standing on your promises there's one thing you cannot do and that's fail and father with you all things are possible to them that believe and we believe together as a body we claim each and every one a total of victory whatever they have need of their hearts raised to you you know what they're going through may their joyous runeth over may you truly give them the touch what they have needed abundantly that truly we can say we've been with jesus in all glory all praise all honor belongs to you father

congregation you have a song you know what i'm special [Music] [Music] [Music] hey that's right does anyone else have a testimony or something yes sister normal i have a testimony last week i couldn't come to church it's been a while but i think my back was hurting me for a couple weeks my backside i i was hurting so bad that i felt sick and i my prayer group i asked him the phrase and i apologize to sister monica that he wasn't able to come i didn't want them to take offense i thought brother roger was gonna preach but i was seriously hurting and she said they would pray for me too and you know monday i was so much better tuesday it was gone amen yes faithfulness i have been sick for three years i have had bowel issues nobody knew what was going on with me and um i got desperate i thought i was dying to cancer i thought for sure i was dying of cancer i was diagnosed with a bacterial overgrowth in my contestants i have a friend and her name is miriam deanhart and people know her hair and she prayed with me one day and ever since then my symptoms have been dissipated amen very much every day although that symptom's gone or that sometimes god so i've been healed amen hey man anyone else have a testimony yes brother dance yes uh the other day a couple of days ago i don't even think i told my brother i was helping my wife uh hang a curtain kitchen window and i i needed just a little bit more height and i got the little step stool and all of a sudden i slipped and i went crooked and i hit the edge of the counter and and my wife heard the noise she ran downstairs and i should have been on the floor but i stood up and she said what happened i said i fell off that step and i i i thought i was going to really be on the ground but i i give glory to the lord amen and send his angels and it could have been a lot worse the way it sounded it should have been a lot worse than what it was and give the glory to the lord amen yes i was able to go and be with my family over the uh christmas holiday now i'd stayed with my sister and um god had been letting me see numbers uh i don't know for the last 10 years the number 33 you know on the clock you see these numbers i see five five five or eleven eleven four four four three three three but mostly uh 33 because he knew that it reminds me of the lord you know that right was crucified and so it reminds me of him you know to thank him and so forth and just say i appreciate you lord just reminding of god yes and he's let me see that so often am i so i mean with other brothers even you know we're sitting in the church and we're or or we're out at lunch or whatever it is you know this has been happening uh i don't know for maybe about the last 12 years brother roger shar uh brother merle good man just different brothers were you know with me at the time we're talking about one thing we're talking about a story or whatever what happened in our lives then when we get to the church the minister says the same thing or i'm listening to a tape at home the minister says the same thing you know what i mean uh so i appreciate that i mean you know we're not looking for the numbers you know at random looking for it you're just it's there that's right every time it's there so i i just thank god because he made he vindicated it yesterday you know before my sister as well as all the other times with the other brothers and so forth great uh it's god of course god's been reading your mail time and time again so i appreciate it i let other people that i'm with you let them see that you know what i

exactly what i'm telling you guys and she has the tv on the news and then and i'm telling her i'm explaining it just how i'm explaining now to you and i look over at 6 33 i said see there you go right

i'm gonna ask our congregation if you'll do this with me but um in 152 it's um i'll be listening to my name it's just the chorus that's all it is and i woke up singing that yesterday [Music] i'll be

special that he'd like to share at this time so amen god bless you i'm going to be using a soundtrack for this one if you know it feel free to sing a phone and it's a i had this song on my heart since daddy's been preaching about god and um i wish i could have sing it then but i didn't know it and i've been contemplating what day to sing it and if i was going to play piano or use soundtrack and then zach sent me the list today of the songs and then it just all goes together so amen opens up [Music] when david gathered a handful of stones where the soldiers had fallen he waited alone with a prayer and a little rock the giant fell right on the spot well that's what david prayed for and that's what david got oh you can't ask too much of my god [Music] she had so many regrets so often she failed what jesus knew still he forgave her of her sins and her life began to flow living water for no you can't ask too much and you cannot find a peace of mind that seems to leave [Music] and you can't ask too much of my god no you can't ask too much of my god upon the three hebrew children god smiled and when sarah was 19 god gave her a child now i believe the justice [Music] [Music] [Music]

praise the lord thank you brother michael yes amen so true amen never ending he said ask and you shall receive ask in my name and you shall receive amen amen she had mentioned it earlier today so i just wanted to see if she was uh up to doing it so um let's go ahead if anyone no one else has a testimony or song special we'll uh sing another chorus here before asking brother ben to come up um it's one we're all pretty familiar with i i feel like we'll try the verses but we'll start out with the first or just the chorus through it all it's a number let me get it it's in the song here number 670. [Music] through through it all [Music] right through it all [Music] in jesus [Music] i've had questions for tomorrow [Music] but in every situation god gave consolation that my trials [Music] and through it all i've learned to trust in jesus [Music] and i've been to lots of places and i've seen a lot of places [Music] is it all i've burned the trust in jesus i've learned to trust in god through it all [Music] and i thank god for the mountains [Music] a problem i wouldn't know [Music] in jesus [Music] oh through it all i've learned to trust in jesus through it all i've learned to depend upon his word yes through it all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust [Music] amen that your testimony today learn to be able to trust in the lord jesus and everything that he does i mean everything we go through everything he brings us through we know that regardless of what the circumstance or condition is god is always there amen amen we trust in him we believe in him and you know this has been a year that we've come through a lot yeah uh i preached a message a couple weeks ago blessed during the during the crisis and all that's been going on and god's just continued to bless us and bless his children and he'll continue to do so amen you know but it has been uh it has been some tough times there's been some rough roads but i'm thankful god's brought us through the mall amen just like sister crystal and sister sheila's testimony has gone through many of the things that she's had now with joel being passed away i'm doing the same thing myself today as my mother's would have been my mother's 90th birthday and when she turned 89 she was doing so well i thought my mom you're just gonna blow right past 90 three months later less than three months later it was gone so we just never know right but god is always faithful but as always true you know i sitting back there and just feeling the presence of the lord so strong today and all of your testimonies and your positive words and worship to the lord and micah got up and that song started singing in the presence of the lord i don't know about everybody else but i know in that corner the presence of the lord fell so strong and so uh so sweet so pure amen i don't know if uh kathy or sister or uh brother john felt it but it sure was there i know that just over overcame and engulfed me uh you know when you get like that you think lord now i need help to be able to preach today because uh you know sometimes you just could run around the building a dozen times but we're here because the word takes preeminence amen praise the worship's great and we enjoy the presence of the lord and worshiping him and his songs and all but the word takes preeminence sorry lord just i just asked the lord to give help to be able to bring the message today so thankful to be with you again this weekend i missed you last week so very much uh but send word to you from the uh from the group up in the white mountains they said to tell you hello and they appreciate you sharing me with them so that's those words that's their words so i just i just tell you that they don't have a pastor and you know me i don't go traveling i don't go seeking other pulpits and go around the world ministering i'm a pastor but those people that they had great need they don't have a pastor and so and i love them so dearly and i try to go help them when the lord allots and gives the time i just told him i said uh you know last time i was up there was january it was snow on the ground and 10 degrees or whatever and the windshield was below zero i don't know what it was cold i said it up there it was it wasn't that bad up there this this last weekend i said could we do this in july i'm not

through another uh christmas season and i felt like i i kind of did a little bit of a a message service last week but it really kind of was kind of was and it really was but you know when you talk about jesus christ and he is the theme of everything of our lives in the bible everything you do really is a christmas so it's a celebration of jesus christ and so we're here to celebrate him again today so i'm i i've just had something that came on my heart this week that i wanted to bring to you today and just trust and pray it be a blessing to you so i would ask continued prayer too for the prayer requests it was mentioned also remember brother roger and sister monica they're going to be moving tuesday to oracle so they're going to be going to a little higher country and taking their fifth wheel as most of you know they live in a fifth wheel and they're just gonna take their fifth wheel next tuesday up to uh oracle and park it there for uh however the lord long the lord has them there so just remember them in prayer friday will be their second anniversary their second anniversary this year they got married uh in south africa on january on december 12th which was their first anniversary and then they got remarried or got married again in the united states as the united states requires uh jeremy and angela did that too i actually married jeremy and angela here uh i don't

amen god's good to us amen yes amen love you today appreciate you appreciate you being on the streaming today let's stand to our feet if we could we're going to turn in our bibles to genesis uh genesis chapter 4 we'll read a few verses of scripture here in genesis chapter 4 that will let you be seated today amen so good to hear the testimonies of how good god has been to all of you it's just a witness to me of how god how good god's been to me and my family and how blessed we are and i'm so thankful god's protected us and kept us amen he's been so good to us and through all that's been going on this year and the covenant and you know me and i believe in the service of the lord god protects his own yes i believe that uh they uh told you i was in the white mountains this past weekend hardly anybody had a mask on it there uh in fact i had lunch with well everybody that came to church went to lunch together brother ron told me he said i don't even own one ron carpenter said i don't even own a mask and so i said well you wouldn't go anywhere in tucson because everywhere you go in tucson you have to have them they won't let you go in i said but that's not a battle i'm willing to fight you know i said that if they want to shut my church down we're going to have a problem right yeah i'll fight for that but 10 minutes in a home depot with a mask i don't really care about that but i think you know it is what it is and the circumstance we live in but i believe again the service of the lord god protects and watch over you say well brother you i know people's got in church well i'm not responsible for those people right i i i can't vouch for anything or anybody else i just know me my heart and the lord tells me and those that call me pastor so that's what i am responsible and do the duty bound to so uh the others i'm not saying they're not christians or not believers but you know that's that's up to the lord that's right whatever he does and whatever he does here we're just believing in trusting him yeah so we're thankful for that amen genesis chapter four let's just bow our heads if we could for another word of prayer before we read the word lord jesus father it has been good we can read the scripture close our bibles and say it's been good to been in the house of the lord amen well god it comes time now that lord you just looking for you to speak to us from this word lord the things you put on my heart and lord just expecting again for you that anointing to come and sweep through this place yes continue to keep your presence here lord and allow it god to anoint us so greatly of the speaker the here alike and lord that purpose that you have accomplished for this word for us for this day and for those that are in this building those that are streaming god i just pray that your holy spirit would move upon them as well as you do and have done here today god in this in this sanctuary in this place has been consecrated and set aside for your service lord we're so thankful god to feel your presence and know you to be real once again to hear the testimonies to hear the songs to sing the worship and god just know how real you are how good you are and yes lord we're just we're coming up it's hard to believe but we're coming up at the end of another year of 2020's about done but lord we're thankful god that there's nothing about you that is done you're continuing to bless your people and watch over and help us and with all this going on in the world lord you keep us you bless us you strengthen us and help us in every way god we give you thanks and praise for it so now we pray god that you take control the remaining part of this service speak to us from your word once again lord let this word not return void but again i pray you would accomplish that that you send it forth for whatever purpose reason for each one of us help that faith grow in our hearts to grow in our lives and may we become more like you yes in this day and hour that we live father through your word god and speaking to us let the holy spirit have preeminence god we just come in commit all this into your hands and thank you god for all that you've done doing and going to do in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen genesis chapter four tell you what's read one verse in genesis chapter three and why would you start in genesis chapter three verse 20 um 21. genesis chapter 3 verse 21 and unto uh unju adam also unto his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them you could be seated we'll just let you be seated there um read this uh scripture many many times uh the third chapter of genesis the third and fourth is is um uh something i i guess i go back to refer to it the lord takes me to a lot and this particular point of this uh i've taken various different subjects and gone into different directions with this very one scripture and kind of want to do that again today you think now what has this got to do with the birth of jesus uh i told you the other day uh you know we know that jesus wasn't born in december actually the world is starting to come out and recognize and is being televised and it's being broadcast that people know and churches are saying and they know that jesus was not born in december took them long enough but apparently they're finally coming to understanding it wasn't december jesus was born in he was born in the springtime when all lambs come forth he was the lamb is born in the springtime when all lambs come forth you say well what's this got to do with the birth of jesus and i think well you know we celebrate the birth of jesus if you celebrate the birth of jesus as a celebratory time life is life as it is and we in ourselves have life and we celebrate our lives every day of course we celebrate the life of jesus in us every day amen so that celebration is an everyday event but there's that one day that we set aside that normally we know what day we were born on you get a cake and you have presents and you get together and go to dinner maybe or different things because you celebrate well that was the day that person was born but we don't know that with jesus brother brown says april may we know springtime and i think about it like this and i told this to you a couple weeks ago but you know we don't know my wife doesn't know when she was born she picked her birthday uh she can tell you all the details of why she picked july 10th but we don't know we got a one in 365 chance of getting it correct but we don't know but we celebrate it on that day i understand so we take that time and we make that celebration because it's that one day we don't know what day it is but we take that day and we celebrate we celebrate the birth of jesus now don't believe in the worldism and the commercialism and trees and all that stuff but we do believe and are thankful for the birth of jesus so uh as we go into this uh portion of the scripture i'm hoping to try to finish this today but without keeping it too long but i want to start back again in genesis 3 21 and i'm going to read through and just follow with me here and and we'll just uh we'll just take this and jump start us into the subject that i want to talk about today unto adam also unto his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them so we know there in the garden of eden as adam and eve were hiding themselves from god they had created a buffer they like to use the bible says the word hide you can't hide from god so we know they couldn't hide from god but they created a buffer because they were in a condition now that was a falling condition and this fallen condition did not allow them to be in the presence of god they could not do that anymore god used to come every day and talk to adam lift to ear and they'd fellowship walk through the garden of eden and then have a wonderful time of fellowship together but then but when the fall took place and sin entered in the camp they could no longer be in god's presence like that so they created that buffer they hid in the bushes and the trees and separated themselves from god they created a buffer there but when god realized this he made the decision now this you say god make a decision well every decision god made has been right it's been perfect and it's been uh a final for for all eternity god decided that it would take the shed blood of an innocent one to allow them to come back into his presence again not like it was before but acceptable enough to god that they could be there with him at that time amen now that sin through the great chasm that great uh a gulf between god and man the sin entered now god because god can't dwell with their sin so that sin chasm threw a great gulf between god and man so they could not at that time have that kind of fellowship anymore so god in his uh of course godness uh through the wisdom of taking blood the breaking of a blood cell a lot of times you talk about in denomination and you sing about it and people look at blood and the flowing of the blood but it wasn't the chemistry of the blood that made the difference it was the life that was in the blood that made the difference the chemistry of the blood would have fallen onto the earth or onto an altar or wherever and that was one part of it but it was the life that was in the blood that was recognized by god not the actual drip of chemistry of blood now that played its part of course too but the life in the blood is what god recognized amen and when that blood cell was broke that was something that was acceptable to god an innocent lamb in this case took the place of what adam and eve had done now it wasn't enough to annihilate it because it was simply an animal's blood but it was enough to cover it so that it would take them to the next time just like through the old testament the the blood of the bulls and the goats and the lambs that never eliminated or annihilated their sin but it hid their sin to where it made it acceptable by god that was god's choice no man chose that no no person no church no pope no entity no pastor it was god's decision that it was going to take blood in the blood of an innocent one that was his choice so he took these uh these lambs and he made coats of skins out of these lambs for adam and eve he threw these bloody sheepskin into the bush for them to wear to come out again but then god had to banish them from the garden of eden because of the sin right now let's continue on and the lord god said behold the man has come as become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden the garden of eden cherubims with a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life that's a whole another message or two or ten in itself but i want to say on our subject today and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cain and salah had gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was the tiller of the ground in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the first of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the first thing of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain unto his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell now these sacrifices were reminiscent of what god had done for adam and eve in the garden of eden these sacrifices that of course revel matthew excuse me hebrews tells us that by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain why was it a more excellent sacrifice because the sacrifice that abel gave was by revelation right the sacrifice he gave was that was by faith and this faith this revelation that was in abel came not through the serpent seed but from god through adam because it was adam's need of abel that had the revelation that knew that when the garden of eden when god decided that it would take blood or the blood of an innocent one to satisfy or to accomplish what god was expecting to have for that time when abel got that revelation he used that revelation to offer his sacrifice to god because he knew that's what was acceptable to god it wasn't botany life it wasn't fruits it wasn't uh leaves it wasn't fig leaves it wasn't apricots it wasn't apples it wasn't oranges it was blood that's what was acceptable to god it took blood and abel offered a more excellent sacrifice by faith by revelation to god and this was acceptable to god he did not accept cain's sacrifice because cain's sacrifice had no revelation to it it only had human intellectual knowledge now everything about the altar and everything they did was exactly the same it was right it was acceptable but that's not what god's looking for this church this building all the the the cameras and the musicians and the singing and the chairs that's all wonderful and great we got it all set up nice friend but that's not what brings revelation that's what's not acceptable to god the chairs are fine friend the the the pulpit i love it i think daniel every day i think uh uh for making this pulpit and and the streaming the instruments and singing the book god blesses us but that's not where he's at that's right god is in revelation it's revelation that god's looking for it's in your heart by the holy spirit that god brings it to you that he accepts that sacrifice the sacrifice that we offer to him giving him praise with the fruit of our lips that's what acceptable to god all this could be out on the street corner all this could be in a homeless shelter all this could be in a a an extended care facility it could be anywhere it could be any chairs it could be any books it could be any music it could be any singing but it has to be with revelation it's got to be by faith it's got to be by the holy spirit that it offers unto god that's the more excellent sacrifice all the altering things that cain did all that was fine that that would god god that that's okay that's fine it could be here it could be all the uh all the religious move that cain did that was all perfectly fine but it was the sacrifice is what god was looking at the sacrifice he wasn't concerned with the altar the altar was one thing it needed to be done right of course but it was the sacrifice that god was concerned with and the sacrifice is what god's concerned with today it's not everything else all that's fine this is all acceptable to god he's pleased with it but it's the sacrifice that god's looking for it's the offering unto him by revelation and faith that we give that's acceptable to god amen he he did not accept cain's sacrifice but he did accept abel's sacrifice now people say well king was sincere absolutely it was sincere there's a lot of people out in the world today they're in churches all over the world they're worshiping hands up tears flowing and but they have but where is the sincerity you think well they're they are sincere but is god accepting that right is god receiving that is that worship by revelation is it by faith where is that worship what is it that's acceptable to god well see there's got to be something that god will receive and the only way we can know what is pleasing to the lord is about what the word tells us right what does the bible say that god is pleased with what we know he wasn't pleased with kings and we know why he wasn't pleased with cain's but we know he was pleased with abel's and we know why he was pleased with abel's so abel's sacrifice was by faith it was by revelation he could look back and realize what god had done in the garden of eden because god had done the exact same thing that abel did that was accepted by god cain didn't do that you want to be something that's acceptable by god you look at what the bible says and what's pleasing to the lord that's what we do amen that's cain and abel's sacrifice god made the decision that's what it was going to take that was god's choice now if that's god's choice that's what we follow others may follow all different other ways of trying to serve the lord right or to give to the lord and i'm sure they're doing it now the sincerity of their heart but if it's not by revelation it's not by the word it's not going to be acceptable to god they can't that the bible says they come to him on that day and say well we did this for you lord we did that for you lord we did this in your name we did this in your name jesus and he said depart from me i never even knew you right that's right they were sincere of course they were but it's got to take a revelation right it's got to take a sacrifice something that is acceptable by god we understand what is acceptable by god this was the beginning of a process that was to carry on even into the birth of jesus even unto this day that birth of jesus was a continuation of what god had started here in the garden of eden it was just a continuation god took the innocent lambs and sacrificed them so adam and eve could come out and to his presence again well jesus the birth of jesus was just a continuation of that because that was the beginning that god was showing us just just having that just lifting up off of that banner uh that blanket just a little bit just so he could see what his purpose was in redemption because there had to be something to redeem bring back adam and eve from where they had fallen to because see adam and eve and you know i i've explained this to you before but can i go in just a few minutes here because it goes with the subject but uh but adam and eve were let's just say they were right here adam was created out of the dust of the ground by the voice of god amen god spoken that come at them right period i believe god's way i believe that's how every human was supposed to come right they weren't supposed to come by procreation and birth from a woman they were supposed to be spoken i've been challenged by that before but uh but that's i when god does it one way one time that's what he does all the way through right birth by a woman is god's permissive will not god's perfect will right right adam was a spoken word being he came forth because god spoke him and he breathed into him the breath of life he took out of that perfect being and created the woman amen from the man and those two were standing there in perfect harmony in their ought to be conditioned you know i've said that many times and there ought to be condition the condition that god had created them and that we're supposed to be in god's mind so i put them at that level adam and eve were here because that's where god had created them that's where god had put them they're at this position when the fall came when the fall took place they fell they left where they were supposed to be and they fell to a lesser condition because of sin amen sin had put them in a fallen condition or a lesser condition than what they were supposed to be or in the place that god had created them in at the beginning they were supposed to be here you we god's children today are supposed to be here not down here yes you say well the world's getting worse yes it is but that doesn't mean we get worse with them amen and you say well we're better than they are but if they keep falling and you keep falling with them you say well we're better than they are but you're not where you're supposed to be am i yeah we're still supposed to be here no matter how far they go right the bride god's children are supposed to be in their ought to be conditioned here now we know we're still in bodies we're born in sin shaped and equally come the world speaking lives we understand that this body our spirit is subject to the elements of the world subject to satan's seed we know that but that's not what god's looking at am i that's not what god's looking for and that shouldn't be our main focus our main focus should not be how beautiful our hair is or how the new suit or how good we look together or how we are in church or wherever we go our main concern should be where is my soul what is the condition of my soul where is my soul at what level is my soul is my soul still in a falling condition or is it where it's supposed to be is it in its ought to be conditioned when adam and eve fell god had already began the process of bringing adam and eve back to where they were again that's called redemption right that's called bringing them from their fallen condition back to where they're supposed to be that redemptive plan began right here genesis 3 21 god made them coats of skins and clothed them so they could walk out into god's presence that began the process of redemption it did not put them back in their ought to be conditioned again but it put them in a place that was better than where they were but full redemption that's just the beginning of a redemptive process full redemption puts you back where you're supposed to be that's what full redemption is right and we know that in the continuation the birth of jesus that's where it brought humanity again the blood of jesus was able to bridge the gap it was able to bridge and bring a bloody bridge over that chasm so that man and god could come back into fellowship and unite once again heaven and earth brother adam said embrace one another heaven and earth kissed when jesus come forth because it was once again that time that god and man could come back together again to be able to put humanity and god's people back into an ought to be conditioned not physically spiritually because notice we're still in this falling condition the redemptive process had just begun we're in that redemptive process god has already redeemed our souls our souls are where they're supposed to be if you're born again and filled with the holy ghost your soul is where it ought to be but our physical condition is reaching to that place yes and it will get to that place whether it's by the grave or whether it's by a rapture this body change will happen you'll be in your ought to be conditioned in a glorified condition and then we'll leave this world amen amen one way or the other then we'll leave this world but that redemptive process had begun now i had to take according to the bible someone who was related to you to be able to bring you back let's go over to leviticus let's read this process of redemption now leviticus 25 speaks about it in length and in several parts it talks about land it talks about houses it talks about people it talks about servants indentured servants uh slaves if you will but i just want to focus on the land part of it now just for a few moments to to get to the redemptive part of it leviticus 25. now this is god's law okay this is man's law right this is god's law this is god's requirement it's not something that people look to today it's not something people follow today not in this country not anywhere that i know of maybe in israel i don't know if they still do that or not but they don't hear uh here if you buy a piece of property it's yours you own it free and clear done as long as you've got the money to pay for it you pay for it it's yours it belongs to you nobody can come take it from you nobody can force you to sell it to them legally maybe with a gun but they can't force you to sell it to them but it's a different situation because god sent the children of israel to a place that he had promised them the land that was flowing with milk and honey and god lets them know just like he lets us know all the time that all of this is his right yes everything is his i mean i told that we talked about that the other day a lot of times people are concerned with their wallets uh and but god owns it all right amen he just makes us stewards of 90 of it right right he owns it all but it's all his if he wants it here it is whatever it is it belongs to god well he lets them know that this is his see 21st verse so leviticus 25 21 he says then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years this is the law of the land he's telling them where he's telling them uh that every every seventh year they are to rest the land you're to harvest and grow and plant and for six years but in the seventh year the land was to have a sabbath the land was to have a rest and they weren't to plow or to plant anything in the seventh year so there so he's telling them so in the sixth year what i'm going to do now is similar to when they left egypt and they went into the wilderness and he sent manna to them now now god told him and through moses now you gather this manna every day except for the sabbath you rest the sabbath and don't gather on the sabbath but what i'm going to do is i'm going to send you enough manna on the sixth day that you can gather a double portion so that you won't have to gather on the seventh you'll have enough for both days right now that's a life of faith now there's people in the bible that did not have faith right so what they would do is they would try to go out on the seventh day because they didn't have to go what if it runs out oh well what if this happens what if that happens and you know that's the fear-mongering that goes on in the world today right you hear it on the news all the time you very seldom hear things on the news that says this this and this it says what if maybe could be possibly and they scare people to death over possibilities and might be good bees oh this could be the worst christmas ever well thanks for telling me i i had a little different plan but they scare people now but you know we live by faith but they scare people to death out here with that stuff right because they don't live by faith right so those are the people that would go gather on the seventh day well then they would get stoned of course but and so there were people that would try to try god's law and they would try to go gather and say well but what if we run out what if there's not enough well what if it spoils because you know if we if that night we gather that day anything that's left over spoils the next day so if we gather on the sixth it's gonna be spoiled on the sabbath we gotta get small in the seventh no god took care of that too yes amen the manna that god gave them on the sixth day did not spoil on the seventh he took care of them but they had to live by faith and believe right this is going to work the way god said it's going to work and friend that's the test of faith we get every day amen is it going to work the way god said it was going to work we have to believe that we don't have any signposts or scientific proof or medical proof we don't have any insurance or doctors and the president's not going to get up and say it so we have to believe in faith that what god said he would do he's going to do amen period when we have faith that way that we live that way job was the most perfect man according to the bible but yet job lived in fear so much he even said the thing he feared the most is what came on him right the thing he feared the most you know people can fear so much they'll actually develop the symptoms of something and not even have it right right because of the fear that comes on them it's a spirit yeah fear is a spirit and it's a spirit that is ruling this country it's a spirit that is ruling this world and i'm going to tell you friend don't let it rule you amen amen so what they were doing is god was telling them let the ramp the land rest on the seventh day and what i'll do is what you harvest on the sixth day will be enough for three days or three years excuse me what you harvest on the sixth year will be enough for three you'll let the you'll let it rest in the seventh and in the eighth you'll start planting and by the time that crop comes up what i gave you for the three years you'll be running out of that just in time for the other harvest to come and be able to to be mature so you can start eating that again so when god's telling them i command my blessings the six years shall bring forth those three years he's telling them i'll give you enough harvest in the sixth to sustain you through the next two into that ninth year and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat of the old fruit until the ninth year until your fruits come and it shall ye shall eat of the old store listen now he says the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine and i'm allowing you to live in it i'm giving it to you so you can enjoy it so you can be blessed in it it's a lamb formed with milk and honey but he's letting him know this is not going to be sold because it's mine amen amen for uh for ye are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land a redemption for the lamb amen now how does this redemption work let's keep reading if thy brother be waxing poor ah you mean you can have financial trouble anyway if thy brother be wax and poor and has sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it then let him count the ears of the cell thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that bought it unto the year of jubilee and in ghibli it shall go out and shall return unto his possession now this can sound complicated but it really isn't first of all we've established the land belongs to god right but let's just say gods give a portion of that land to me and i fall in a poor condition i have some financial difficulties could you imagine it's great that nobody ever the people has never had some but there's people that actually have had financial difficulties amen and if i had some financial difficulties i could take a part of this land and i can sell it to somebody else now it could be somebody in the church it could be brother dennis it could be brother danny it could be any of you or it could be somebody that's walking down the street this guy lives in this apartment across the street got ten thousand dollars to say okay i'll sell you this piece of land for ten thousand dollars then i sell it then i take that money and he takes that land and he utilizes it for whatever he wants to utilize it for he gets his at that time it's his land right right so he can use it for whatever he wants to use it for a lot of times they would take it and grace cow or sheep or they would use it to plant and to sow and to and to bring a harvest forth or something whatever you needed the land for you could use it for that land would be yours to utilize whatever way you wanted to because you gave me money for it so now it's yours this track here belongs to you to use however you want to but now if if uh uh my son i was gonna use micah but he went to the restroom if my son come up and he says okay now i want my daddy's piece of land back the person that bought it has to sell it to it because he's my kin he's related to me he's my son my wife could come i want my daddy's property back here's the money and and he the man that takes the increase of what he used for the land it's his but he could buy that land back and now it would be his because it was redeemed back because he was my ten now you couldn't come up to it and say now i want to i want to uh buy brother newton's land back no no i don't have to sell it to you understand i don't have to sell my land to you because i bought it from him and you're not a kinfolk to him right you have to be a kinfolk so you could come up and say some of you is not kind to me could come up and say i want to buy it says no i don't have to sell it to you i'm going to keep it i'm going to hold on to it but now if i got in the position then i could buy it back i could go to him and say i want my land back and he would have to sell it to me he has no choice no matter whether he was somebody who was related or a friend or if it was a stranger out in the world doesn't matter if i had the money and i could redeem that land back and i could pay him for it he would have to sell it back to me right he would have to that's his now the land can get sold based on the usage of it because every 50 years there was a jubilee and let's just say it was in the fifth year after the jubilee this man's got potentially 45 more years to use that land before he has to give it back he's got 45 years to use it so the land's going to be more valuable to him so i can ask more money for it because he gets to use it for 45 years but now if i sold it to him in the 45th year of jubilee then he would cost very much money because he's only got five years to use it because every 50 years the jubilee trumpet would blow and everything that was the way it was had to go back to its original condition right so i sold it to him in the 45th year he used it for five years in the 50th year when the jubilee trumpet blew that man had to give me my property back he didn't have a choice had to be restored in him hath bought it until the year of jubilee in that jubilee it shall go out and shall return unto his possession amen it has to come back yes amen so it has to be brought back to me now remember all this is god's right it all belongs to god that redemptive process of bringing that land back you understand to bring the land back it had to be a a a redemption that took place to redeem it back to where it once was it once was mine god chose it's his land he chose what to do with it it's my land it's my 10 acres i can deal with it what i want to but if i have to sell it for some reason or i lose it for some reason my kinfolk can buy it back and bring it back to me in my possession or on the jubilee it would have to come back to me that's redemption it was here it failed but at some point it has to go back here you buy a piece of land it's yours in perpetuity what well sorry uh i used to be a realtor it just means until forever it's yours forever uh or until you decide to sell it or entirely until you decide to give it away it's your land right you don't ever have to go back to the first you bought it from it doesn't ever go back to that personal list they come back and off you twice as much as i'm i mean it doesn't involve a former owner anymore but in god's law it's totally different that person can only possess that property for a certain length of time before that property has to go back to its original condition amen that's redemption has to go back now the kinsman part of this redemption is that person had to be kin folk to be able to purchase it back to its rightful position again well if they weren't ken folk how could it come back to its original condition somebody down the street could offer three times what he paid for it but he can't sell it to him well he could sell it but but the person that's buying it has to understand that it belongs to me right he could buy it from him and say okay i want the remaining 10 years on it and he said okay i'll sell it to you and he can sell it but it's got to come back to me eventually or if my son again comes up and says well you're the third person to buy it but i want it it's my dad's he had to let it go to him had to there was no choice had to be a kinsmen redeemer had to be someone that was kin folk to redeem that back to its original condition to its ought to be conditioned amen i like the ought to be better into its ought to be conditioned where it's supposed to be now not supposed to be according to god's uh according to man's laws or man's rules or what they have recorded down at the recorder's office no we're talking about what it is to god right what does it mean to god where is it in the mind of god because that's all that matters right and that's all we care about am i that's all that matters to us is that it belongs to god well when sin entered in the camp in the garden of eden that that belonged to god fell adam and eve fell all of creation fell the world fell everything went into a fallen condition because of the selling out of adam and eve adam to satan right when he sold it out to satan he lost inheritance in all of it now look what brother branham said here in the breach message if i can find the one i'm thinking about now pardon me a moment now in the breach he said now oh my now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty god now when adam lost his inheritance he lost his inheritance to life the picture that brother branham is drawing here is showing adam as the possessor amateur god of the earth everything that's in it and everything that's going to come forth from it right was in his possession who owns it god amen but he put his son adam in control of it and he said what this earth is what it represents what all comes from it is under your control which included you and i because just as adam was god's original way of doing it from the dust of the ground god called adam from the dust of the ground was each one of us supposed to be or are actually from the earth we are still that but because the original was everyone from it is amen you understand that right if the original one of something come from the earth whatever comes off of that came from the earth right right because that was the origin so we're all of the earth still but when adam had this under his control it was his inheritance the picture brother branham draws is he actually had the book of life in his hands the lamb's book of life i've explained this in in how i see this unfolding this creation adam was standing there with the lamb's book of life with every name of redemption in the mind of god before the foundation of the world because that's when your name was written on the land's book of life right according to the bible before the foundation of the world it's in his hand and as each decree time and season were to come forth that name was to come out it was to be spoken and come forth from the earth just like it was the first time why would god have changed his plan right let me ask you that again i've been challenged to people so my brother didn't say that but let me ask you how else would it have happened why would god have changed his plan from the first time when he did it of speaking out from the dust why would god have done it any different after that right i don't believe he would because he's god his first way is perfect yes procreation now and the bringing forth of life is a permissive will right not god's perfect right adam would this forfeited with this title deed in his hand the the last book of life was in his hand when he lost it and fell to satan in the garden of eden he lost it he lost that inheritance he lost his inheritance to the earth and everything that was coming from the earth which was the redemption of the man the the names that was in that book right because when his when he lost his earth he lost that too right the physical earth itself fell into the hands of the one he lost it to satan right that's why we still live in satan's eden this satan's eating still belongs to till still belongs to satan it's not rightfully his right but he's a squatter now to take control over in his way until until the time of that fullness of redemption finishes and then he has to let go of it right you notice the bible tells us god's plan of redemption when that fullness of that time and the fullness of that redemption takes place he has to let go of it physically take his filthy hands off of it yes but when this forfeited title deed with all the names of god's redeemed in it the land's book of life that went back into the hands of the original owner almighty god all the names that book went back in the hands of god amen that forfeited title deed now in the hands of the original owner almighty god the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when adam forfeited it then satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner god himself the book of life the last book of life satan's dirty hands could not take control over those lives you understand he could not take control over those lives he took control over the earth but he could not take control over god's redeemed over god's people over god's chosen he could not take control over those because of his filthy hands could not do it because those were god's people now in the story of ruth brings and draws out the redemptive plan beautifully because boaz was naomi's near kinsmen wow a few weeks ago we went through and talked about the book of ruth and in the subject of resting and being at rest and ruth resting and that then those stages of her resting and working and uh uh and rewarded and those steps the resting we rest in christ and that and we talked about ruth and what she went through and what she did and how boaz was that kinsmen redeemer because he was kinfolk to uh to naomi you know naomi's husband had passed away naomi's sons had passed away which one of them of course was ruth's husband had all passed away but ruth was a virtuous woman and they recognize ruth as a virtuous woman uh boaz speaks of it it talks about how she was a virtuous woman and the process that it went through excuse me i'm skipping things to try to put an end on this uh time's getting away from me but uh there had to be that way of bringing back what uh what naomi had lost when they had moved away but even though they had moved away it's still that that inheritance still belonged to them and boaz was working it and and boaz liked ruth and wanted to have ruth to himself and he said i'll redeem all that naomi has which would be ruth and all that she has but boaz says there's a a nearer kinsman than i am there's somebody that's closer there's somebody that's next in line before me they have rights to it first i can't just go and claim it when there's somebody else that has a better claim on it than i do right so he said at the city gate and he gathered together the man who was the nearer kinsman and ten witnesses of the city and he told this man the situation with naomi and the land that was the limitless and said uh you can redeem it because you're the nearer kinsman but if you don't redeem it i'm going to redeem it and the man says i'll redeem it and he says okay you can redeem it but you've got to know that if you redeem hers and you redeem naomi you're going to have to redeem ruth too and the man says i can't do that because that would mar my inheritance you understand he said that would mar my inheritance i can't redeem them to me because i can't take ruth to myself because that would mar my inheritance now who was that that had the greater chance at you before the birth of jesus sin fell in the camp right we were born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lives every bit everything we did was controlled by the devil we were born with a fallen nature the way the ways we live the places we went the words we spoke the things we did emulated everything that was satanic and ungodly we belong to him he was that nearer kinsman satan was right but when it come time for a redemption because he was only a squatter just like the earth just like the earth he was only a squatter he only had control over for a short period of time but when he come to be able to fully redeem it he couldn't do it because he's a devil and he can't redeem god's children as a kinsmen redeemer because he'd have to get rid of the devil to do it right right and jesus told us if satan casts out satan his kingdom is divided he can't do that if he destroyed the devil to redeem us where we're supposed to be because we're in the mind of god right that's where we're supposed to be he can't redeem you there's no way he could kinsmen take control over you because if he did that he would have to kill himself he would have to destroy the devil the devil not this devil can't destroy the devil so he has to relinquish his rights over and the birth of jesus came amen as a kinsman amen as a human he had to be a human god couldn't send an angel melchizedek the form of a theophany wasn't good enough had to be a human being had to be someone that was born into this world as the flesh of a human sinless flesh but the flesh of a human to be able to be kinfolk to you and i am to produce and to perform the act of redemption of bringing us back to himself right jesus was the only one that could do it now it wasn't the the the blood of a literal lamb or a bull or a goat but it was the lamb it was the blood of almighty god now the chemistry of the blood fell into the earth to redeem the earth back to god but the but when the blood cell was broke it released the life of god amen and the life of god come back into the worshipper amen and redeem the worshipper back now his life lives in us amen because he's redeemed us he could do it because he was in the rightful position to do it when when boaz uh said i'll redeem it and i'll take it because i can take ruth under myself she'll belong to me it won't mar i'm my inheritance we're kin folk and it won't mar mine he took his shoe off and and gave it to him as a sign of possession that's footsteps possession all through the bible you read footsteps possession it was a sign they did in israel took a show off and gave it to him because it was a representation for the whole city to see let this be known today that i have redeemed naomi i have redeemed ruth i have redeemed all that was theirs amen that belongs to me to me available yeah now when jesus uh revelation 5 you look when jesus came forth he took the book because he was the only one worthy to take what book that title deed of redemption amen the book because he was the only one worthy to take it satan's worth that satan's filthy hands couldn't take it because it there was no way he could redeem it without him not being a devil and that's who he was he could not redeem it or it would mar his inheritance what's his inheritance all those out in the world all this out here in the science education civilization that's all his inheritance satan's eating it's all his inheritance amen that's not god's inheritance right or god's inheritance jesus had to come forth continuing that plan of redemption god started in the garden of eden that was reflected in abel's sacrifice to be able to redeem his children back to himself the only way he could do it is that he was born right he had to be born jesus god had to form in the womb of mary a blood cell that would bring forth jesus christ that would live and die to redeem us back to himself go to hell and redeem those that were there emptied out paradise and had to uh adam and eve and and abraham and all had to release them and send them forth because his blood didn't just cover us for today all his blood went all the way back to the very beginning of this process all the way back to the garden of eden yes and redeemed every one of his that was his back unto him again amen he elevated and brought everyone back to their ought to be conditioned amen they're in that position now the only thing keeping us here is these kind bodies yes we're in this flesh we're in this sinful flesh our spirit's even subject to the world but god has already redeemed us the process in you personally has already begun when you were born again when god put his life in you that process had already begun amen now when these bodies take on the completeness of romans 8 tells us the completeness of that of that redemption in our bodies or that is to say the redemption of our bodies the changing of our bodies the bringing forth of our bodies unto his like unto his glorious body the fullness of that redemption well without jesus being born whether it's april whether it's may whatever day it was had to come forth and when he had to come forth he had to come forth to bring himself forth as that kinsman to redeem us back as our kinfolk because we belong to him he's a part of us now he's not kinfolk to everybody understand he's not kinfolk to everybody that's why he told that like we said we paraphrased it in matthew he said depart from me you that work iniquity i never knew you why because they're not kid folks right they're not his kin humans but not his kin we are his kin because our names were in that book of life that lamb's book of life that book of redemption that title deed that searches back through into the mind of god where god had you before the foundation of the world in his mind jesus had to be born as that kinsmen to bring to bring us back to him to fulfill the law of redemption to complete what jesus or what god had started there in the garden of eden and to bring it forth and friend we're at the we're at the end of this thing now where god's going to complete this yes he's going to complete this in this and then all that we're his are going to live together with him through eternity praise the lord that's his children but yet we still enjoy the blessings of being his kinman we still enjoy the blessings that god give us the testimonies how many testimonies we have beautiful god healings god delivering god blessing yes the testimonies that's living in the blessings of god right yes god showing his children how much he loves you amen he loves us just as much when we go through the dark times as he does when we go through the lifetimes he loves us just as much in the valleys as he does when we're on the mountain amen he's the same everywhere he's our god he he had to be born to be our kinsmen to redeem us back to himself and bring us back to that position again now spiritually our souls redeemed sealed by the holy spirit amen and it's out to be conditioned looking forward to the time as these bodies continue to lose this world continues to lose grip over our bodies over our spirits we become more and more like jesus christ we become more and more in his image we become closer and closer to him to the point that this this earth this cosmos this world loses grip on those on that on that group we call the variety internationally right amen and she looses her grip on that bride and the bride goes home yes hallelujah we go home to meet him in the air so shall we ever be with the lord amen amen praise the lord thank jesus thank god for his birth amen amen being being born he hadn't been born he couldn't have lived if he hadn't lived he couldn't have died he had to die he couldn't have uh come back if he had to come back we wouldn't have the holy ghost we'd have no hope yes amen yes praise the lord thank you lord thank you jesus amen let's stand today if we could so much more that i wanted to get to today but maybe lord willing another time god knows but understanding how why god did what he did yes through the process of god having to honor his own word god having to fulfill his own word there's not a situation that comes up today that god doesn't just say and come and say oh well i think i'll do this now no no no no god can't do that it has to be fulfilling in his word amen it has to be according to what god has already shown his decisions his words he's already done has to be according to his word he can't just say oh i think i'll do it this way today no we do that right god doesn't do that am i if god did it one way he has to do it all the way through yes so when god had a plan to redeem us back it had to fulfill his word amen amen and he already laid that for us to be able to follow uh thank god that we're in a day that we have the word of god that we can read and that we can uh uh have god speak to us through and reveal to us amen praise the lord so thank you it was days when they didn't have it friend right if you if you had a
