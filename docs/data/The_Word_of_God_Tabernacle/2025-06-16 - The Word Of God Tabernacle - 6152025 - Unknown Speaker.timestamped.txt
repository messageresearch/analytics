[26:39] I can't feel at home in this world
[26:43] anymore.
[26:44] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[26:49] you. If heaven's not my home, dear Lord,
[26:53] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[26:58] from heaven's open door, and I can't
[27:02] feel at home with this world anymore.
[27:07] Well, they're all expecting me. And
[27:10] that's one thing I know. I fixed it up
[27:14] with Jesus many years ago. I know he'll
[27:19] see me through. Though I am weak and
[27:22] poor and I can't feel at home in this
[27:27] world anymore.
[27:29] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[27:33] you. If heaven's not my home, dear Lord,
[27:38] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[27:43] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[27:47] feel at home in this world anymore.
[27:51] [Music]
[27:52] Just over in the glory land. We'll live
[27:56] eternally.
[27:58] The saints on every hand there shouting
[28:01] the victory.
[28:03] The song of sweetest praise drip back
[28:06] from heaven's shores. And I can't feel
[28:10] at home in this world anymore.
[28:14] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[28:18] you. If heaven's not my home, oh Lord,
[28:23] what do we do? The angels open me from
[28:28] heaven's open door. And I can't be at
[28:32] home in this world anymore.
[28:36] Oh Lord, you know I have no one like
[28:40] you. If heaven's not my home, dear Lord,
[28:45] what will I do? The angels beckoned me
[28:50] from heaven to open door. And I can't
[28:54] feel at home with this world anymore.
[28:58] No, I can't feel at home with this world
[29:02] anymore.
[29:04] [Music]
[29:07] Amen. Oh my that's the truth, saints.
[29:11] Amen. Amen. That is so very true. Praise
[29:14] the Lord Jesus. How can we feel at home
[29:16] in this world? Amen. This world has
[29:19] nothing for us. Yes. Praise the Lord. We
[29:22] realize that even in our hearts, in our
[29:24] souls, it's pulling us to a place that
[29:27] this is not our home. This is not where
[29:30] we will stay. This is not where we will
[29:32] rest. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[29:37] Going home time. Yes. Looking forward to
[29:40] that time. Amen. My whole life. Praise
[29:44] the Lord. Just living for the Lord.
[29:46] Waiting for that moment that he calls us
[29:48] to be with him. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[29:51] Amen. God bless you today. Amen. We have
[29:54] a a couple prayer requests to bring to
[29:56] your attention. Uh, brother Dennis wrote
[29:59] a request here for his wife Leah. Says,
[30:01] "Please remember my wife Leah in prayer.
[30:03] She has been uh very nervous and
[30:06] anxious. She told me that she told me
[30:09] that she believes something drastic is
[30:11] going to take place. She doesn't know
[30:14] what uh what it is and she has uh
[30:17] surgery coming up on July 10th and that
[30:20] has affected her as well. Amen. So we
[30:23] remember Leah in prayer. Uh I have to
[30:25] agree with Lee. I think something very
[30:27] drastic is about to take place. I think
[30:30] some drastic things are already taking
[30:32] place in this world. But in the
[30:34] spiritual world, it's going to continue
[30:36] to get more and more drastic as we get
[30:38] to that end. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's
[30:41] building, building, building. Amen. If
[30:43] you ever put a pot of water on the
[30:45] stove, you see that water just sets
[30:47] there and it just sets and sets. You can
[30:49] stand there and watch it. You go by the
[30:51] old adab of a watch pot never boils.
[30:53] Well, that's not true. I have watched a
[30:55] pot as it started to boil. But anyway,
[30:58] uh it starts changing and building and
[31:00] building and you see a bubble here and a
[31:03] bubble there and pretty soon the thing
[31:05] is just in a full over boil and
[31:07] sometimes it'll even boil over if it's
[31:09] high enough. Amen. And we're just at
[31:11] that place. Amen. We're just at that
[31:13] place. So I have to agree with her there
[31:15] and we want to remember her in prayer.
[31:17] Amen. Uh having surgery on July 10th. So
[31:20] we certainly want to remember her in
[31:22] prayer for that as we've known that
[31:24] she's has that. So, we just trust the
[31:26] Lord for that. Amen. Also, Brother Danny
[31:30] text and said that uh vagrance around
[31:33] his apartment kind of kept him from
[31:36] being able to sleep last night. So, I
[31:38] see he stayed at home, said he was going
[31:39] to be streaming. I trust he is. Lord
[31:41] bless you. Sister Sheileia said she
[31:43] wasn't going to be able to make it, but
[31:44] streaming. So, I trust she is.
[31:46] Hopefully, maybe Lord willing the Pats
[31:48] are. Amen. And just want to remember
[31:50] those who aren't here. Sister Julie and
[31:52] Sister Lydia
[31:55] is in the mountains. Amen. Praise the
[31:57] Lord. The bioasteros, they uh uh they
[31:59] had their children in the vacation bible
[32:01] school at Grace Community Church and
[32:04] they had come up with a whole program
[32:05] for the kids at the VBS and uh they're
[32:09] performing that this morning. So, they
[32:11] went over there to attend so their
[32:13] children could be a part of that
[32:14] program. So, uh please remember them in
[32:16] prayer. They're not out of church, just
[32:18] in a different place this morning. So,
[32:20] uh please remember them in prayer as
[32:22] well. Amen. So, but we're thankful for
[32:24] those that are here. Just a few of us,
[32:26] but we're here. Amen. And so thankful to
[32:29] the Lord for blessing us to be able to
[32:31] be here. Uh last week, I wasn't sure I
[32:33] was. Uh it was a pretty rough week. It
[32:36] was hot, tiring. Uh just really hot. Got
[32:39] dehydrated. Uh and to boot, the elevator
[32:44] at the air at the uh hotel we were
[32:46] staying at was broken. So I had to climb
[32:48] four stair four flights of stairs every
[32:50] day to just get upstairs. And after
[32:52] you've walked 6, eight miles during the
[32:54] day and stood on your feet for 12 hours,
[32:57] uh being in the hot 95, 99° sun, uh
[33:02] going upstairs is not the funnest thing
[33:04] to do. Uh Monday night, uh I got so
[33:07] dehydrated, which is my fault. Uh I
[33:10] should have taken care of myself better.
[33:12] Uh my whole body just cramped going up
[33:15] the stairs. I couldn't even hardly I
[33:16] couldn't hardly lift my leg to go up the
[33:18] next step. uh just to get up the stairs.
[33:21] It just was so sore and hurt so bad. But
[33:24] I'm thankful the Lord brings us through.
[33:26] Amen. He never said it would be easy. He
[33:28] just said he would be with us. Praise
[33:30] the Lord. So I'm thankful that he is
[33:33] always with us. Yes. Amen. So appreciate
[33:36] your prayers for that. Amen. It was it
[33:38] was a good trip. The flights were good.
[33:40] So all about that. So thankful to the
[33:42] Lord for that. Amen. Anyone have a
[33:44] request on your heart today you'd like
[33:46] to bring
[34:01] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:07] Congestion
[34:12] [Music]
[34:14] in prayer. Lord, just touch it. She's
[34:18] not singing, just a few of us. But my
[34:20] wife hurt her back this week, too. So,
[34:22] she's in a lot of pain. So, spasming
[34:25] actually spazzing, too. But she's
[34:27] faithful to be here. So, that's my wife.
[34:31] Uh love her so much. She loves the Lord
[34:34] Jesus. Uh and and I and I know she loves
[34:37] him more than she loves me. Uh because I
[34:40] can tell in her life. And that means
[34:42] that that means everything to me. Uh I
[34:45] hope I show that to her because but uh
[34:48] she's here and so thankful for that. But
[34:50] please remember her in prayer. Lord will
[34:52] just touch that um her back. So amen.
[34:56] Any unspoken requests Lord. Amen. In our
[34:59] hearts. Let's stand to our feet if we
[35:00] could. Amen. Take these needs to the
[35:02] Lord this morning. We ask brother Dennis
[35:04] if you would do that for us. Lord Jesus,
[35:07] it's an honor once again to be in your
[35:10] presence. Yes, it is Lord. Lord, you're
[35:12] the only great one. You're the one that
[35:15] were in our hearts. We made that effort
[35:19] to be here. Not to see one another
[35:22] necessarily or be seen of one another.
[35:24] Yes, Lord. But to see you be with you,
[35:27] to fill your presence, to fill your
[35:29] power, Lord Jesus. For we know there's
[35:32] power in the name of Jesus. And Lord,
[35:35] the devil's fighting us harder than ever
[35:38] when we see the so many signs displaying
[35:43] that your coming is very close. Yes,
[35:45] Lord. And even brother Brown taught us,
[35:47] you want to know what time it is, look
[35:49] at a clock. Amen. You don't want to know
[35:51] what day and hour they're living in.
[35:53] Look at Israel. Israel's under attack,
[35:56] Father. Yes, Lord. Oh Lord, what is
[35:58] what's going to take for some to wake
[36:01] up, Father? Yes, Jesus. If they're

[47:44] to thee.

[48:54] love him. Amen. Praise the Lord. We'll
[48:57] go ahead and stand to our feet. Amen.
[49:00] Just get into the word after that.
[49:03] That's just so beautiful. Just such a
[49:05] good intro and feeling the spirit of God
[49:08] move here with us.
[49:11] Amen.
[49:13] Just believing the Lord would
[49:17] be here with us. Amen. Let's turn over
[49:20] our Bibles to chap uh to Romans chapter
[49:22] 8.
[49:24] We're going to continue on with our
[49:27] adoption series.
[49:31] Praise the Lord. Talking about a great
[49:32] father. Amen.
[49:38] Thank you, Jesus.
[49:42] Now, Romans chapter 8,
[49:45] read a first few verses or we'll read a
[49:48] few verses of scripture. Amen.
[49:52] HBC Romans 8. We'll start with verse 14.
[49:56] Amen. Romans 8:14.
[50:00] Praise the Lord. Before we do, let's
[50:01] just bow our heads for another word of
[50:02] prayer if we could. Oh, how great you
[50:05] are, Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord. How great
[50:08] you are, Lord. Words can never even
[50:11] begin to describe how great you are.
[50:13] Yes. Our minds can't conceive it. Our
[50:16] hearts just can't uh can't receive it.
[50:19] We just can't understand it, Lord.
[50:21] somehow how great you really are, Lord.
[50:25] But we can feel it. We know God in our
[50:28] in our lives that you have done
[50:31] everything that's possible to bring us
[50:34] to bring humanity even Lord to those
[50:37] even who won't receive it. Still have
[50:39] the opportunity, still have the the uh
[50:43] uh capacity to receive it, Lord, if they
[50:46] just would. But Lord, it's for those who
[50:49] will. And Lord, we're so thankful today
[50:52] that you put in our hearts the desire to
[50:54] will, Lord, to receive the greatness
[50:58] that you are, the greatness that you've
[51:00] done. Lord, we just It's amazing how we
[51:05] delve into just the smallest little
[51:09] aspect of things in life. We we walk
[51:12] around sometimes like a proud peacock of
[51:15] all the things that we've gotten and
[51:17] accomplished in the word and revealing
[51:19] to us, Lord. And if we could just get a
[51:22] glimpse of how little we actually do
[51:24] know and how small that we really truly
[51:27] are, God, and how great and awesome and
[51:30] how tremendous, Lord, that you are,
[51:33] Lord, to just fathom that little bit,
[51:36] Lord, means so much to us. But you've
[51:38] given us in this life everything that we
[51:41] need, Lord, to get to you, Lord. Lord,
[51:45] to make a rapture, to make heaven our
[51:47] home, to be born again, to be filled
[51:49] with your spirit, and to go home to be
[51:52] with you one day. Yes. Lord, we just
[51:54] pray that you'd bless us, Lord. Bless
[51:57] this time as we change your the service
[52:00] now. Bless this word. Speak to us, Lord,
[52:03] from it. May it not return void.
[52:05] accomplish in it, Lord, what you sent it
[52:08] forth for. Whoever may hear it today,
[52:10] whoever may watch it in the future, God,
[52:13] may they be blessed by it, Lord. Not
[52:15] because of me or any efforts of ours,
[52:17] but Lord, it's because of you.
[52:20] Everything that you've done, all that
[52:22] you are and all that you've given. We
[52:24] commit it to you now, Lord, and ask your
[52:26] blessings. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:28] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[52:32] In Romans 8, we'll read beginning with
[52:35] the 14th verse here. For as many as are
[52:38] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[52:40] sons of God. For you not for you have
[52:43] not received the spirit of bondage again
[52:44] to fear, but you have received the
[52:46] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[52:48] "Aba, Father." The spirit itself beareth
[52:51] witness with our spirit that we are the
[52:54] children of God. And if children, then
[52:56] he hes of God and joint heirs with
[52:59] Christ. If so be that we suffer with
[53:01] him, that we may be uh may be also
[53:05] glorified together. Amen. You can be
[53:07] seated if you'd like.
[53:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, we're
[53:14] thankful again and we're going into a
[53:16] different, I guess, phase of this, if
[53:18] you will, or
[53:20] a different portion leading off of the
[53:22] manifested sons of God. We're now going
[53:24] to get into the uh subportion of the our
[53:28] position in Christ. Amen. Our position
[53:32] in Christ. So this would be adoption
[53:34] part 17. Position in Christ part one.
[53:38] Amen. And position in Christ is
[53:41] basically what adoption is. Your
[53:43] position in Christ is your adoption.
[53:47] Because we know that adoption is not the
[53:49] becoming of a son. An adoption is the
[53:53] placing of a son, which is uh as we've
[53:56] said several times, which is opposite.
[53:58] Of course, as we think of adoption in
[54:00] the natural world today, we think of
[54:03] adoption as the becoming of a son uh of
[54:06] someone adopting someone else into their
[54:08] family. a family adopting someone into
[54:11] their home and bringing them into their
[54:13] home and taking responsibility over that
[54:16] person's welfare in every way uh by the
[54:20] process of adoption by bringing them
[54:22] taking our name taking that family's
[54:26] name taking on that family's aspect and
[54:29] what that family offers and does and
[54:31] gives and and is everything about that
[54:34] family that person that comes in that's
[54:36] adopted becomes a part of that family.
[54:39] Amen. Now in that it also does allow the
[54:43] placement of that adoption
[54:47] uh in in the natural because that person
[54:50] comes and even though they're adopted
[54:52] and become a son or daughter, they also
[54:55] fulfill a placement in that home. They
[54:58] feel a placement in and so much that uh
[55:02] uh well it used to be in my day. I don't
[55:04] know how people do it today. I believe
[55:06] uh Tabitha does it, but uh when when you
[55:10] when you're raised up and you come up in
[55:12] a family, uh the the the the children
[55:15] have chores that that's what their their
[55:18] job is. They they they're do chores.
[55:20] They don't go to work and earn a
[55:21] paycheck and come home, but they have to
[55:23] take out the trash and they have to uh
[55:25] clean the litter box and they have to uh
[55:28] pick up after the dog or they have to
[55:29] clean the dishes or whatever it might
[55:32] be. mow the yard or uh pull weeds or
[55:36] whatever the chores. There's chores to
[55:38] be done. And each one each child that
[55:40] comes, an adopted child comes in and
[55:43] will f fulfill a position. It may be
[55:46] taking out the trash, whatever it is,
[55:48] something very simple. But they hold a
[55:50] position in that home because they
[55:53] belong to that family. See, the hardest
[55:56] part that children, I think, have today
[55:58] is parents don't parent their children,
[56:00] right? So their children don't feel a
[56:02] part of the family because they're not
[56:04] parented. They're just humans that are
[56:07] flailing about in the world and don't
[56:10] know what's up, down, which way to go.
[56:12] They don't have any placement. They
[56:14] don't have any position. They don't have
[56:16] any feel of accomplishment or belonging
[56:18] or achievement or purpose in life. So
[56:22] you see a lot of people just flailing
[56:24] around in life uh not knowing where to
[56:26] go or what to do. And uh probably a lot
[56:29] of that has to do with the drug epidemic
[56:31] epidemic and uh the fentanyl and the
[56:34] drugs and the alcohol and the uh the
[56:37] righteous living and all this cuz people
[56:39] are just lost, right? Uh our uh our job
[56:44] was next to a a well, it was in a
[56:46] commercial area, but there was a Napa a
[56:49] parts auto parts place right behind and
[56:51] where we had to park. And so we had to
[56:53] go into the dirt lot behind our facility
[56:56] to park and we'd have to leave out by
[56:58] that Napa every day come in and out. And
[57:01] uh almost every single day, almost every
[57:04] single time coming in or coming out, it
[57:06] was people laying around just homeless
[57:09] people, I'm guessing, just laying around
[57:11] in Napa on the concrete just laying
[57:13] there. Uh young men Micah's age uh with
[57:17] no purpose, with no meaning in life,
[57:20] completely lost, right? completely
[57:22] devoid of any value. They don't know
[57:24] what they're doing. They don't know
[57:25] where they're going. Their life is just
[57:27] ticking away moment by moment into the
[57:29] wasted abyss because they don't know
[57:31] where they're going or what they're
[57:32] doing. And they they probably never
[57:35] found a place. They probably never found
[57:37] a position. They never found a home. And
[57:40] someone that adopts a child into their
[57:42] home, as we've said before, can never
[57:45] disown that child in the United States.
[57:47] They can't disown them. They're part of
[57:49] that family. they are to they're to come
[57:51] in and have a placement in that home.
[57:54] When you come into the family of God,
[57:56] it's the same way. You always were a
[57:58] child. So, you don't become a child
[58:01] while you're here as in the spiritual
[58:03] sense. Cuz if you're a if you're a son
[58:05] of God, you always were a son of God. In
[58:08] the mind of God before the foundation of
[58:10] the world, you were a son of God. But
[58:12] you come into this world and find your
[58:14] place. Yes. Amen. What is your placement
[58:16] in that body? Amen. It's not to lie
[58:19] around uh on on the concrete of the Napa
[58:23] sidewalk, right? It's not It's not just
[58:26] to come in and fill and warm a pew every
[58:29] week, right? Or something. You're to
[58:31] have a place. You're to have something
[58:33] to do. And if people don't have that,
[58:35] they lose purpose. They lose meaning.
[58:38] And when when children aren't parented,
[58:41] they lose meaning. They lose purpose. U
[58:44] uh children aren't I'm sure there's
[58:47] probably homes because I've heard of it
[58:49] uh that that the children aren't given
[58:51] chores. They're not given
[58:53] responsibilities. They're not given
[58:55] placements. They're not given anything
[58:57] or shown anything or make them work to
[59:00] make them feel valued. They think,
[59:02] "Well, I love my child." If you love
[59:04] that child, you'll correct that child.
[59:06] You'll give that child something to do.
[59:08] You'll put him to work. You'll have him
[59:10] to where he has some value. Amen.
[59:14] Just letting a child flail about just
[59:16] makes that child feel worthless. And and
[59:19] people call people of the world today
[59:21] call that love. I love my child so I
[59:24] don't want them to do this or do that or
[59:26] whatever. That's not love. Right. Amen.
[59:28] Love is having them feel love to feel a
[59:32] po to fill a purpose to fill a
[59:34] placement. Amen. And that position. It
[59:38] may just be coming in and uh adopting
[59:40] that child and that and that child now
[59:44] uh has to take out the trash and mow the
[59:46] grass. That may be their place. Yeah. Uh
[59:50] that their place may be uh whatever it
[59:53] is in that home, but they have a place.
[59:56] Amen. They have a they have a position.
[1:00:00] They have something they're supposed to
[1:00:01] do. They didn't just come into that
[1:00:04] family just to flail about. They came
[1:00:06] into that family to contribute. Amen.
[1:00:10] And and that's the same with the
[1:00:11] spiritual life. We are everyone to be
[1:00:15] contributors. It seems like a lot of
[1:00:18] times especially in the message of
[1:00:19] course I say in the message I don't know
[1:00:21] a whole lot about the secular religious
[1:00:23] world and denominations but in the
[1:00:25] message like that it's it's all on the
[1:00:28] minister. It's all on the pastor. It's
[1:00:31] all on the ministry. And that couldn't
[1:00:33] be further from the truth saints. Amen.
[1:00:35] Because every single child of God must
[1:00:39] have their place. Amen. Must feel their
[1:00:42] place and know what that place is and be
[1:00:45] able to fulfill that place. Amen. That
[1:00:48] adoption is the placing of sons. The
[1:00:51] adoption uh that we're talking about
[1:00:54] that says here the spirit of God.
[1:00:57] See, we have received
[1:01:00] the spirit of adoption. That's that's a
[1:01:04] capital S there. That's Holy Spirit
[1:01:07] receive. So we have received the Holy
[1:01:10] Spirit of adoption. Amen. Which places
[1:01:14] us and tells us what position we're
[1:01:17] supposed to be in. May take a little
[1:01:20] time. May not be the very day that
[1:01:22] you're born again or or baptized or born
[1:01:24] again. May not be that very time. Right.
[1:01:26] Amen. It may take a little time to get
[1:01:29] to that place. I think I've told you
[1:01:30] this story before. Uh when I mentioned
[1:01:33] here a few weeks ago about when the Lord
[1:01:35] brought me into the ministry. Uh it it
[1:01:38] wasn't based on what anybody told me. It
[1:01:40] wasn't based on any prophecy. Although I
[1:01:43] I trusted them and believed that the
[1:01:45] people that did that and prophesied over
[1:01:47] me, but that wasn't that wasn't settled
[1:01:51] for me because God talks to me, right?
[1:01:53] Amen.
[1:01:55] He uses other people to talk to us. Yes.
[1:01:58] And that's not to nullify prophecy. I'm
[1:02:00] just telling you how the Lord speaks to
[1:02:02] me. Right? But then it was uh I was in
[1:02:05] the ministry. I forgot how five six
[1:02:08] years I was preaching uh and ministering
[1:02:13] uh for five six I believe it was six
[1:02:15] years. Uh and I didn't know finally
[1:02:19] somebody come up and said, "Well,
[1:02:20] brother, what what do you feel your
[1:02:22] calling is?" I said, "I'm a minister."
[1:02:24] "No, what is your placement?" "I don't
[1:02:26] know. uh at the time I hadn't even
[1:02:29] thought about the the the placement of
[1:02:32] uh apostles and evangelists and teachers
[1:02:34] and and pastors. I didn't even thought
[1:02:37] about that, right? I I was just I was
[1:02:39] just happy the Lord called me to the
[1:02:41] ministry and just trying to preach the
[1:02:42] word and just trying to spread the
[1:02:44] gospel as God shows it to me. That's all
[1:02:46] I knew. But it took a while. So, but
[1:02:49] after that person mentioned that to me,
[1:02:51] I started praying about it. Honestly, I
[1:02:53] started praying said, "Lord, what what
[1:02:54] is it that I'm supposed to do? What is
[1:02:57] my placement? Where where do you want me
[1:02:59] to be? And eventually uh without going
[1:03:03] through the whole story, the Lord
[1:03:04] eventually re revealed to me that I was
[1:03:07] supposed to be a pastor. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:09] That my nature, my calling, and my
[1:03:11] upbringing and everything the Lord had
[1:03:12] nurtured me to was bringing me to the
[1:03:14] point of fulfilling the position in the
[1:03:16] scripture of a pastor. Amen. In my
[1:03:19] ministry. And so, uh, I went to my
[1:03:22] pastor at the time and I told him, I
[1:03:24] said, "This is what I feel the Lord has
[1:03:26] has called me to do." So, uh, and and
[1:03:29] honestly, at that time, I actually told
[1:03:31] him, I said, "I'm not going to actively
[1:03:34] call other ministers to go, uh,
[1:03:36] evangelize, if you will. I'm called to
[1:03:39] be a pastor.
[1:03:41] Nothing. I I I now I see things
[1:03:44] differently than other people do. Um,
[1:03:47] and I know even my precious brother
[1:03:49] Roger disagree. This is one probably
[1:03:51] about one of the only things I know of
[1:03:53] that we kind of disagree a little bit
[1:03:55] on. Uh, but, uh, I think a man has a
[1:03:58] position and that's his position, right?
[1:04:01] Uh I don't I don't personally think that
[1:04:05] uh a man that's called to a position uh
[1:04:08] goes and evangelizes and he comes home
[1:04:10] and pastors and and then he goes out and
[1:04:12] he teaches a little and he comes back
[1:04:14] and pastor and he goes out in missionary
[1:04:16] work a little bit and he comes back to
[1:04:17] pastor and he's he's evangelizing he's
[1:04:20] missionary he's pastor he's a I I I
[1:04:23] think not that a person couldn't go not
[1:04:26] that like on Easter I couldn't go over
[1:04:29] and help brother Roger congre
[1:04:30] congregation one time, right? And
[1:04:32] minister for them. There's nothing wrong
[1:04:34] with that. I'm not talking about that.
[1:04:36] But this is my place. Amen. Amen. I'm
[1:04:39] not going to go spend six months in the
[1:04:41] missionary field because that's not my
[1:04:43] call. Right. Amen. I'm not going to go
[1:04:45] on the road and go to different churches
[1:04:47] around this country and try to
[1:04:48] evangelize to those people cuz that's
[1:04:50] not my call. Right. Amen. I was doing
[1:04:53] that at one time even being at the
[1:04:55] tabernacle. And honestly, truthfully,
[1:04:58] the point of it is uh uh God has always
[1:05:02] blessed me, but God didn't ble God has
[1:05:05] never blessed me like he does when I'm
[1:05:07] in my place. Amen. He never has. Amen.
[1:05:11] He's He's always been there and and he's
[1:05:14] never left me. I'm not talking about
[1:05:16] that. But it's never been blessed. You
[1:05:18] can ask my wife. She knows. He's been
[1:05:19] with me 40 years now. She knows. God has
[1:05:23] never blessed us like he does when I'm
[1:05:25] in my position. Amen. Amen. And I think
[1:05:28] when a man's called to pastor, he's not
[1:05:31] supposed to go running around
[1:05:32] evangelizing and missionary work
[1:05:34] everywhere. Yes. He should stay at home
[1:05:36] and pastor his sheep. That that's my
[1:05:40] that's my feeling. Amen. Now, I know
[1:05:43] there's probably uh upsets the apple
[1:05:46] cart of the message and a lot of
[1:05:47] ministers, especially some well-known
[1:05:49] ones that seem to go quite often, but uh
[1:05:52] I I tend to disagree with that. Yes.
[1:05:55] Amen. I I don't I personally I've said
[1:05:58] this before, I don't I don't personally
[1:06:00] believe that pastors should be going out
[1:06:03] in revival missionary uh evangelistic
[1:06:08] services.
[1:06:09] said, "Listen, sure." But the pastors
[1:06:13] are fulfilling every position, it seems,
[1:06:16] in the message. And someone who really
[1:06:18] has a true evangelistic calling tends to
[1:06:22] get pushed out, right? Someone who has a
[1:06:24] real missionary type calling sometimes
[1:06:27] it seems kind of get pushed out because
[1:06:31] it's taken over by the popularity of of
[1:06:33] of these people that are p that are
[1:06:37] called pastors. they say there are
[1:06:39] anyway uh that are pastors and and I I
[1:06:42] just I just disagree with that. Now when
[1:06:44] now that being said on the natural side
[1:06:48] if my job in my home or part of my job
[1:06:50] in my home as as a part of the family
[1:06:53] was to take out the trash and my brother
[1:06:56] came up to me and he said you know I'm
[1:06:57] going to take out the trash for you
[1:06:58] today. I'm gonna say thank you.
[1:07:02] I wouldn't as a kid I wouldn't have said
[1:07:04] no no no brother no you stay back. I'm
[1:07:07] taking this trash out. This is my I I'm
[1:07:10] the only one that could. No, you want to
[1:07:12] take it, you go right ahead. I'm not
[1:07:14] going to mind one bit. Amen. But the
[1:07:18] next time it's probably it's going to
[1:07:20] fall back on me again because that's my
[1:07:22] job. That's my position, right? Amen.
[1:07:24] That's where I'm supposed to be. That's
[1:07:26] where the Lord has placed me. And that's
[1:07:28] the same for everybody. Amen. It's the
[1:07:30] same in everybody's life. Now the
[1:07:32] five-fold ministry gets the lion share
[1:07:34] of the thought of adoption because of
[1:07:37] the placement of the ministering and
[1:07:39] what ministering position you fulfill.
[1:07:41] But this position in the body of Christ
[1:07:45] applies to every one of us. We all have
[1:07:47] a part to play in the body of Christ.
[1:07:49] Even if it's not ministering, it doesn't
[1:07:51] matter about that. Every single pi
[1:07:54] position has as important a placement as
[1:07:57] the ministry itself.
[1:08:00] We have our own part to play in in in
[1:08:02] every way. Praise the Lord. Um adoption
[1:08:07] uh this adoption, this position, this
[1:08:09] placement comes as we see it's is three
[1:08:12] stages.
[1:08:14] The adoption is the placement in the
[1:08:18] body of Christ. Our placement in the
[1:08:21] body. Amen. That's the first thing.
[1:08:23] Amen.
[1:08:25] God placing us in that position. Second,
[1:08:28] we abide in that position. We live in
[1:08:31] that position. We fulfill our lives, our
[1:08:34] calling or vocation in that position.
[1:08:37] Amen. Through our whole our lives are to
[1:08:40] fulfill that position. Amen. And God
[1:08:42] calls us to specific positions.
[1:08:45] Sometimes God calls us to positions and
[1:08:47] and sometimes people refuse to fulfill
[1:08:49] that position and God will just let that
[1:08:52] person go and and bring somebody else to
[1:08:54] fulfill it. Yeah. Amen. I remember I
[1:08:58] remember one time, not necessarily this
[1:09:00] is a position so much, but brother uh
[1:09:03] Pat told me one time that uh he was at
[1:09:06] the tabernacle and the spirit of God
[1:09:08] moved on him and said, "Get up and run
[1:09:10] around the pews."
[1:09:13] And he just sat there. He didn't do it.
[1:09:15] He I guess he just I don't remember if
[1:09:18] these are his words, but he just didn't
[1:09:19] do it. He refused to do it. He wouldn't
[1:09:21] get up and do it. Amen. Because see, we
[1:09:24] still for free moral agents. We can
[1:09:26] still do what we want. Right. Amen. We
[1:09:28] can refuse it. We can sat there. We can
[1:09:30] not not do what the Lord wants us to do.
[1:09:33] And brother P said, "I sat there and I
[1:09:35] didn't do it." He said, "And two or
[1:09:37] three seats down from him, all of a
[1:09:40] sudden after he refused to do it, that
[1:09:42] person jumped up and ran around the pew
[1:09:44] exactly like the Lord had told him that
[1:09:46] he was supposed to do." Amen. He didn't
[1:09:49] do it. So God moved on and found and got
[1:09:52] somebody that would. Now, you know,
[1:09:55] brother Patton says his testimony
[1:09:57] learned a lesson from that. You learned
[1:09:59] a lesson to say, "Well, I don't I don't
[1:10:01] want to say no to the Lord." And it
[1:10:04] might not be easy. The Lord might not
[1:10:06] call you to the most glamorous, best
[1:10:09] position. He might not call you to be
[1:10:11] the outfront ones and the ones that get
[1:10:13] looked at or talked about the most. He
[1:10:15] might not give you a position that's the
[1:10:18] uh that's the easiest. Amen. But God
[1:10:21] will bless you in it. God will be with
[1:10:24] you. And that's the most important
[1:10:26] thing. As you abide in that calling, as
[1:10:28] you abide in that vocation, God promised
[1:10:31] to be with you. Yes. And that's the most
[1:10:33] important thing. So we have the
[1:10:34] placement in the body. Then we have an
[1:10:37] abiding in that position within that
[1:10:40] body. And then we have the culmination
[1:10:42] of it which we just which well we didn't
[1:10:44] read it but we have read it several
[1:10:47] times before. And the 23rd verse it
[1:10:50] says, "Not only they but ourselves also
[1:10:51] had the first fruit of the spirit. Even
[1:10:54] we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:10:56] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:10:58] redemption
[1:11:00] of our bodies." The culmination we have
[1:11:03] the adoption placement the fulfillment
[1:11:06] abiding in and the culmination the going
[1:11:08] home. Yes. The changing of our bodies to
[1:11:12] it. Amen. As it says that is to say the
[1:11:16] redemption of our bodies. That's the
[1:11:18] culmination of that adoption. Amen. A
[1:11:21] body change, a rapture that puts us in
[1:11:24] that position. But when we're here, we
[1:11:27] do what the God we do what God calls us
[1:11:29] to do. Amen. Because we received that
[1:11:32] spirit. We received that spirit of
[1:11:35] adoption. Amen. That spirit that speaks
[1:11:39] to us uh that shows us the placement
[1:11:41] that we're supposed to be in. Amen. Now
[1:11:44] I read this at the beginning of adoption
[1:11:47] which uh I I like this quote but I
[1:11:51] wanted to read it again.
[1:11:53] Brother Bram says this. This is in
[1:11:55] adoption. This is at the very beginning
[1:11:58] of the adoption series when brother
[1:12:00] Brandham started to delve into the
[1:12:02] subject
[1:12:04] and he starts talking about Bible
[1:12:06] teaching. He says usually a little
[1:12:08] treacherous a little you know of kind of
[1:12:10] walking out on thin ice we call it. But
[1:12:13] we feel that maybe this is a point in
[1:12:14] time that it might be good to kind of
[1:12:16] bring the church uh to a complete
[1:12:18] understanding positionally
[1:12:20] of what we are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:12:23] Positionally of what we are. Yes. Amen.
[1:12:27] Now,
[1:12:29] and God may call multiple people to
[1:12:31] that. Amen. He may call uh in fact he
[1:12:36] does call multiple people to be pastors
[1:12:40] around the world in this body. He calls
[1:12:43] multiple people to be uh to speak in
[1:12:46] tongues uh if you will. He caused
[1:12:49] multiple people to have the help the the
[1:12:51] office of helps governments. He calls
[1:12:54] multiple people to those things. Amen.
[1:12:57] But now, that doesn't mean I'm supposed
[1:12:59] to pastor like uh the brother down the
[1:13:02] road. It doesn't mean I'm supposed to
[1:13:05] preach or be a pastor like a brother in
[1:13:07] another state or a popular brother or
[1:13:09] someone that has a large church. I'm not
[1:13:11] supposed to be that way. I'm supposed to
[1:13:13] be who I am. God raised me and and and
[1:13:17] uh posh positioned me to be who I am. He
[1:13:22] put me in the family that I was in. He
[1:13:24] put me in the life that I'm in, the
[1:13:26] place I lived. Everything about what God
[1:13:28] does, everything about what God does for
[1:13:30] you is to bring you to the place that
[1:13:33] you can fulfill the position that God
[1:13:35] wants you to fulfill. everything about
[1:13:37] your life, your upbringing, your your
[1:13:40] home life, your where you live, uh the
[1:13:43] state you live, the home you live, the
[1:13:46] neighborhood you live, the parents you
[1:13:48] had, the friends you had, the things
[1:13:50] that you ate, the things that you heard,
[1:13:54] the things that you were a part of in
[1:13:55] your life, the things that you saw and
[1:13:58] received into your spirit. Amen. All
[1:14:01] these things mold you and make you into
[1:14:04] uh that God puts there. It molds you and
[1:14:06] makes you into the person you're
[1:14:08] supposed to be for Christ. That's why
[1:14:11] Satan throws so many things in our way
[1:14:13] to try to pervert that way. Yes. Satan
[1:14:16] will try to throw So God wants you to
[1:14:18] see something a certain way and Satan
[1:14:20] will pervert that a certain way to draw
[1:14:22] your attention away from where God wants
[1:14:25] you to be molded to. Yes. He want God
[1:14:28] wants you to be molded into godliness.
[1:14:30] Satan wants to be wants you to mold you
[1:14:32] into perversion. Right? So you so to be
[1:14:36] molded into uh and and God will put
[1:14:39] things in our or Satan will put things
[1:14:41] in our lives. He'll put things in front
[1:14:43] of us. He'll he'll he'll call our
[1:14:46] attention to things that we'll see that
[1:14:48] we shouldn't see or hear that we're not
[1:14:50] supposed to hear. or even friends or
[1:14:52] even people in our lives that will cause
[1:14:55] us to go astray because Satan wants you
[1:14:58] to be perverted. God wants to bring you
[1:15:00] to godliness. Satan wants to bring you
[1:15:03] to perversion. So, as God is bringing
[1:15:05] you into all these things that we said
[1:15:07] that God brings and molds you into who
[1:15:09] you're supposed to be, Satan going to
[1:15:11] try to throw things in there to pervert
[1:15:13] that way. Yes. To try to keep you from
[1:15:16] becoming that person. Yes. or even if
[1:15:19] you get to that position, that thought
[1:15:22] of perversion will always be there.
[1:15:25] Right? Amen. Because of your spirit.
[1:15:27] Amen. And don't don't think for a second
[1:15:29] that Satan and his domin his de his
[1:15:32] minions won't continue to try to keep
[1:15:35] bringing that up in your spirit, too.
[1:15:37] Your remebrance so that you remember it.
[1:15:40] Satan won't let you forget those rotten
[1:15:42] things. Yet, people always wonder and
[1:15:45] and I think I found the answer. It's the
[1:15:48] devil. But people have always wondered
[1:15:51] why why do we forget all the great
[1:15:55] things, but remember the two or three
[1:15:57] horrible things.
[1:15:59] A thousand good things can happen to
[1:16:01] you. You can do a thousand good things,
[1:16:04] but the two or three bad things are
[1:16:06] always the things you remember. Why?
[1:16:09] It's the same with people. Exactly. It's
[1:16:11] the same with people. People always
[1:16:14] remember uh that they they don't often
[1:16:17] remember all the good you did. They
[1:16:19] don't of remember all the good that you
[1:16:22] said or uh but they'll but they'll
[1:16:24] always remember those horrible things,
[1:16:27] those two or three things, whatever it
[1:16:28] is. Amen. Because it's human nature.
[1:16:31] Why? Because Satan will continue to
[1:16:33] bring those things up all the time. Yes.
[1:16:36] Satan's not going to bring the good
[1:16:37] things up to you, right? Amen. You have
[1:16:40] to do that. You have to delve into your
[1:16:42] remembrance and remember those things.
[1:16:45] Amen. Because Satan's not going to do
[1:16:46] it. He's gonna always try to bring about
[1:16:49] the horrible things, the bad things.
[1:16:52] Praise the Lord. But we're supposed to
[1:16:53] be who we are. Yes. Not somebody else.
[1:16:56] We have to be who we are. We can't be we
[1:16:58] can't fulfill a position. I can't be a
[1:17:01] brother uh uh the the ministry ministry
[1:17:05] of another brother. I got to be who I
[1:17:07] am, right? I can't preach that brother's
[1:17:09] revelation. and I got to preach what the
[1:17:11] Lord's revealed to me. Amen. That's why
[1:17:14] God has different pastors uh for
[1:17:16] different people for different reasons.
[1:17:19] Amen. There's some people that's that
[1:17:21] that that is more adapt to have a
[1:17:24] congregation that just walks in off the
[1:17:26] street.
[1:17:28] That's not me, right? I honestly I could
[1:17:32] do it. I could walk into a prison and
[1:17:34] preach to people. I've done it before. I
[1:17:36] I could walk but that's not my ministry,
[1:17:39] right? My ministry is not preaching to
[1:17:41] people off the street. My my ministry, I
[1:17:44] found out, is is to preach to seasoned
[1:17:46] veteran message believers. And that's
[1:17:50] ultimately where God seems to always put
[1:17:53] me. Amen. Amen. And different people are
[1:17:58] different ways about that, but uh that's
[1:18:01] why somebody else is in the position to
[1:18:04] do that because that's who they are and
[1:18:07] that's what their ministry is. That's
[1:18:09] what they're best at, right? Amen. And
[1:18:12] praise the Lord, that's good because
[1:18:14] that's needed. But so is this. But you
[1:18:17] get somebody that's that's really good
[1:18:19] at going into prisons or introducing the
[1:18:22] message or Christ to somebody or
[1:18:23] preaching to just a bunch of people off
[1:18:25] the streets. You get them in a room full
[1:18:27] of people that are seasoned veterans and
[1:18:32] they they probably feel like they're
[1:18:34] being fed skim milk maybe. Uh because
[1:18:38] because this there's got to be substance
[1:18:40] to it. There's got to be meat to it.
[1:18:42] Amen. Uh but but that person is not
[1:18:45] really called to do that. Not that they
[1:18:48] couldn't, but that's not their calling.
[1:18:49] The calling is more over here. So you
[1:18:51] see it's it's different. And there's a
[1:18:54] and there's a reason why God does that.
[1:18:56] Amen. But we need to come, let me get
[1:18:59] back to this quote now, a complete
[1:19:00] understanding
[1:19:02] positionally of what we are in Christ
[1:19:05] Jesus. And sometimes I think that
[1:19:08] preaching is a wonderful thing. But I
[1:19:10] believe sometimes, brother Beler, that
[1:19:11] teaching goes beyond that. And yes, it
[1:19:14] does. It kindly especially to the
[1:19:16] church. Uh now preaching usually catches
[1:19:20] a sinner, brings him in under
[1:19:21] condemnation by the word. But teaching
[1:19:23] places a man positionally what he is.
[1:19:27] Places a man what? Teaching. Sometimes
[1:19:31] teaching can be a little on the dry
[1:19:34] side, if you will. Right. Amen. It could
[1:19:37] be uh a little more like being in back
[1:19:40] in a school class. But uh but that's
[1:19:44] what we take that positionally places us
[1:19:47] that shows us. Amen. What position that
[1:19:50] we take. But teaching places a man
[1:19:54] positionally what he is. And I like this
[1:19:56] is the part of the quote though. But we
[1:19:58] can right we can never rightly be able
[1:20:02] to have faith. There it is. until
[1:20:06] positionally we know who we are. Amen.
[1:20:09] Amen. If a person is being adopted off
[1:20:12] the off the street, wherever into a
[1:20:15] family, we we adopt you. Amen. Your last
[1:20:18] name is now so and so and this is this
[1:20:21] is this is your family. These are your
[1:20:24] siblings now. We are your parents now.
[1:20:27] You belong to this family. Right? Amen.
[1:20:30] But if that per if that person never
[1:20:34] feels received, if if they never feel uh
[1:20:40] loved or respected or or find a position
[1:20:44] in that home, if they can't find that
[1:20:47] position, how can they ever have faith
[1:20:49] that they really that that that that
[1:20:51] really was what happened? That they that
[1:20:53] that family really took them in and and
[1:20:57] really made them a part of that home,
[1:20:59] right? and made them a part of that
[1:21:01] family. Amen. How how can they have
[1:21:04] faith to believe that they truly belong
[1:21:07] in that family unless they feel welcomed
[1:21:10] in that family. Right? Amen. And the
[1:21:13] best way to know that you feel welcome
[1:21:15] in a family is that you've been p
[1:21:18] positionally placed in that family. Yes.
[1:21:20] You have a responsibility. Again, as I
[1:21:23] said, you have a responsibility. You
[1:21:25] have a position. You have a placement.
[1:21:27] you have a a vocation. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:30] Then you know that you're then you feel
[1:21:33] a part of the family. Right? When you
[1:21:35] feel like you're a part of the family,
[1:21:37] you have faith to believe this is my
[1:21:40] family. This is who I am. This is my
[1:21:44] father and I believe him and I believe
[1:21:47] what he said and I and and I'm his son.
[1:21:50] Praise the Lord. And you can have faith
[1:21:52] in that. And when you have faith, you
[1:21:55] have rightly have faith because you're
[1:21:58] in the position you're supposed to be
[1:21:59] in. You rightly have faith. Then you can
[1:22:02] believe for whatever you have need of.
[1:22:04] Yes. Amen. Because God our father has
[1:22:07] shown us and given us all everything
[1:22:09] that we can expect out of the scripture
[1:22:12] to bring us to those beautiful benefits
[1:22:14] that God has shown us and revealed to us
[1:22:17] is in the word. Amen. We are partakers
[1:22:20] of it. We can have faith in that now
[1:22:23] because we know we belong to the family.
[1:22:25] Yes, we know we're a part of the family.
[1:22:28] Amen. I'm not a pew warmer. I'm a part
[1:22:30] of the family. Yes. I have a position. I
[1:22:32] have a place. I have something that I
[1:22:34] do. I fulfill in the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:37] Whatever it might be. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:40] Whatever it might be, it could just
[1:22:42] maybe be a a housewife.
[1:22:44] It may be a mechanic, maybe a farmer,
[1:22:47] maybe a deacon, maybe a trustee. Uh it
[1:22:50] may be a gift of the spirit, a gift of
[1:22:52] helps or a gift of prophecy or
[1:22:54] something. Uh it it could be because God
[1:22:58] needs you there to be a supplier to be
[1:23:01] someone that's that's well that would be
[1:23:04] fall into helps too. But be a part a
[1:23:06] position to play a position. Amen.
[1:23:10] Praise the Lord. I personally think
[1:23:12] that's one of the reasons. I've talked
[1:23:15] about other reasons, but I personally
[1:23:16] believe that's one of the reasons, just
[1:23:19] one, that God calls us to pay tithe and
[1:23:22] offering to our congregation, to our
[1:23:25] church, because that makes us feel
[1:23:28] belonged. It makes us feel like we're a
[1:23:31] part of it. If you just come in off the
[1:23:34] street and warm a seat and you don't you
[1:23:36] you you don't feel like you've got a
[1:23:39] position, what good does it do, right?
[1:23:42] But when someone contributes, even if
[1:23:45] it's just a tithe or offering or
[1:23:47] something like that, when they
[1:23:48] contribute, they feel like they're part
[1:23:50] of it then. Amen. Amen. They're a part
[1:23:52] of that work. They're part of that
[1:23:54] group. They're a part of that family.
[1:23:56] And it makes them feel worth. And you
[1:23:59] got to feel worth saints. People have to
[1:24:02] feel worth. They've got to know that
[1:24:05] there's some worth to their life. Yes.
[1:24:07] And and I I I again I I believe what
[1:24:10] that's one of the reasons the Lord calls
[1:24:12] us to that scripturally because it helps
[1:24:14] us feel positioned. It helps us feel
[1:24:17] like we're a part of it like like uh uh
[1:24:20] it's ours. This is this is our this is
[1:24:23] not Newton Bennett's church. This is our
[1:24:25] church. And every church should be that
[1:24:27] way. I should be able, I know this is
[1:24:30] probably not true in ours and that's
[1:24:32] probably partly my fault, but I should
[1:24:36] be able to walk out that door and never
[1:24:38] return and this church will continue to
[1:24:40] go.
[1:24:42] I should, it should be that way. Amen.
[1:24:46] Church down the street, that pastor
[1:24:47] should be able to walk off the platform
[1:24:50] and walk out the back door and never
[1:24:52] show back up again. And that church
[1:24:53] would continue to go. Now, there'll be
[1:24:56] some things that need to be dealt with
[1:24:58] and taken care of and all that and
[1:25:00] positions to be fulfilled to fill, but
[1:25:04] it should just continue on because I'm
[1:25:06] not the church, right? Amen. That's why
[1:25:10] I've and I I'll I'll say this out of
[1:25:13] love and respect, but that's why I've
[1:25:15] never felt a pastor should just shut
[1:25:16] down a church. Right. Amen. Because he's
[1:25:19] just one position in that church, right?
[1:25:22] If you don't feel like you're a pastor
[1:25:24] anymore, or you don't feel like you can
[1:25:26] pastor anymore, or you don't feel like
[1:25:28] that uh uh that's your place anymore, or
[1:25:31] maybe God's sending you someplace else,
[1:25:33] get up and say, "I resign. God speak to
[1:25:36] you." Right? Amen. I love you, but God's
[1:25:38] calling me to do something else or
[1:25:40] calling me someplace else. And just move
[1:25:42] on. It's that simple. Because it's not
[1:25:46] your church. They are not your people.
[1:25:48] You don't belong to me. You belong to
[1:25:51] Christ. Amen. Amen. You're his, not
[1:25:55] mine. This is not my church. I'm just
[1:25:58] positionally placed here. Praise the
[1:26:01] Lord. That's the way it's supposed to
[1:26:02] work. I believe that's the way it should
[1:26:04] be. Amen. When I left Florida, I asked
[1:26:07] the Lord. I said, "God, these people
[1:26:09] have been without a pastor for years.
[1:26:11] Please don't take me and and not and
[1:26:14] these people not have a pastor for this
[1:26:16] to uh be like like uh Micah's prophecy
[1:26:20] to Ahab, you'll see like he said seen
[1:26:23] Israel scattered like sheep having no
[1:26:25] shepherd. Amen. And so the Lord put a
[1:26:29] brother's heart, a name on my heart and
[1:26:31] I prayed about it and I went and called
[1:26:33] the brother and that brother already was
[1:26:36] looking. He told me before I could say
[1:26:38] anything that he had already felt led to
[1:26:41] come to up to that to St. Augustine and
[1:26:44] to our church.
[1:26:47] God was already dealing in both ends.
[1:26:49] Right? So I got up and told the people I
[1:26:51] the Lord's called me to do this. I'm
[1:26:54] leaving. Amen. I didn't want to leave
[1:26:57] without a pastor or something. So, um
[1:27:01] th this is what I prayed. This is what
[1:27:04] happened. And and the the church voted
[1:27:06] and voted in another pastor and I left
[1:27:08] and the church kept going. Now,
[1:27:11] unfortunately, when that brother felt
[1:27:13] led to go back someplace else, he just
[1:27:15] shut the door, sold the church, I guess,
[1:27:17] took the money and just left
[1:27:19] and the church disbanded. Doesn't exist
[1:27:22] today. I don't agree with that. Amen.
[1:27:26] It's not the way it should be, saints.
[1:27:27] Yes. So many times it seems like that's
[1:27:29] the way it happens, but that's not the
[1:27:31] way it's supposed to be, right? That
[1:27:34] pastor is supposed to just fulfill one
[1:27:36] position. Say, "Well, it wouldn't exist
[1:27:39] without him." Okay, that's fine. But
[1:27:42] what if the Lord has somebody else to
[1:27:44] come in to take that position?
[1:27:47] Doesn't belong to him, right? Well, I
[1:27:49] put all my money into it. Doesn't
[1:27:51] matter, right? You wouldn't have a dime
[1:27:54] of that money if God had to give it to
[1:27:55] you to begin with. Right. So, it's not
[1:27:57] your money. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:01] Anyway, I I probably got off on a little
[1:28:03] tangent there, but to have faith Amen.
[1:28:07] to have faith rightly have faith. You
[1:28:10] have to know positionally who you are.
[1:28:13] That's how we have faith. You see so
[1:28:14] many people that seem to be struggling
[1:28:16] with faith. Well, you can go back to the
[1:28:19] message here and really realize and
[1:28:21] understand it's probably because a lot
[1:28:22] of people don't know who they are.
[1:28:25] Probably a lot of people don't even know
[1:28:27] for sure if they're even a Christian, if
[1:28:29] they're even born again. Amen. Don't
[1:28:32] even know. And that's a horrible, sad
[1:28:35] place to be in. Yes. If they don't even
[1:28:37] know they're a Christian, how can they
[1:28:39] have faith to believe that God's going
[1:28:40] to answer their prayer? Right? You can't
[1:28:43] rightly have faith until you know who
[1:28:45] you are. Amen. and that God reveals to
[1:28:49] you. Which brings me to the second
[1:28:51] quote, questions and answers in 1961.
[1:28:58] Amen. Forgive me for so much water. I
[1:29:01] was out in the desert working last week
[1:29:03] and I got so dry. Anyway, questions and
[1:29:07] answers 1961. Number three says uh how
[1:29:10] does just in case you might want to go
[1:29:13] look it up. How does one know that uh
[1:29:15] know their rightful position in the body
[1:29:18] of Christ? Brother Aaron says that's a
[1:29:21] good one. Very good. How does see that
[1:29:23] would be kind of a question among many
[1:29:25] of us here tonight and that's probably I
[1:29:28] mean there's only five of us but that's
[1:29:31] true probably with any local assembly,
[1:29:33] right? with almost any body of
[1:29:36] believers, any church.
[1:29:39] You say that's probably the kind of
[1:29:41] question amongst us, as brother Brandham
[1:29:44] said here, many of us here tonight. How
[1:29:46] do you rightfully know? Now, I'm
[1:29:49] presuming that this brother wants to
[1:29:51] know what position, what in Christ, what
[1:29:53] part of Christ do I play? Now, for
[1:29:56] instance, I'd say like this, brother, to
[1:29:59] uh to give you the best answer I know.
[1:30:02] Your position in Christ is revealed to
[1:30:06] you by the Holy Spirit. Yes. Well, that
[1:30:09] that's the perfect answer because we
[1:30:11] just read that we received the Holy
[1:30:15] Spirit of adoption.
[1:30:18] That the Holy Spirit would be the one to
[1:30:20] reveal it.
[1:30:22] The Holy Spirit would be the one to show
[1:30:24] that truth, that re that revelation. So
[1:30:27] if it's in the Holy Spirit, of course,
[1:30:29] then the Holy Spirit should show that to
[1:30:31] you. Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord. I I
[1:30:36] think of it this way.
[1:30:40] I've had a lot of people over the years,
[1:30:43] probably more sisters and brothers,
[1:30:46] young
[1:30:47] that would ask me, "How how do I know
[1:30:51] that this person is the right person for
[1:30:54] me?
[1:30:56] How do I know that uh how do I find that
[1:31:00] that person that God has for me?" And
[1:31:04] and I believe that's true. Amen. But how
[1:31:08] how do I know? How how do I know when
[1:31:11] that's the person? How do I know? I
[1:31:13] said, well, first of all, I would tell
[1:31:15] tell them first of all, I believe when
[1:31:18] you know, the Lord will show you right
[1:31:21] in some way, shape, or form. Even as
[1:31:23] I've said our me and my wife, when we
[1:31:27] met, I I can't explain it. I wasn't
[1:31:29] serving the Lord at all. Was I? I wasn't
[1:31:34] serving I wasn't a Christian bit more
[1:31:36] than anything. Uh I wasn't serving the
[1:31:39] Lord, but I was the son of God. And I
[1:31:43] can't explain it to you. I I I I tell
[1:31:45] people I said uh I I I can't necessarily
[1:31:49] explain it to you. Uh, I just knew it
[1:31:53] was just something that was down in my
[1:31:56] spirit that was down in the innermost
[1:31:58] part of Newton Bennett that knew that
[1:32:01] that that girl there was going to be my
[1:32:04] wife. I knew it. There was there was no
[1:32:07] way you can convince me anything
[1:32:09] different.
[1:32:11] Um,
[1:32:13] and that's the first thing I think God
[1:32:15] will show you. But the second thing is
[1:32:18] and and I got and and these I garner
[1:32:21] from personal experience that one and
[1:32:23] this one I said just be a Christian.
[1:32:28] That's the best thing you can do. Be a
[1:32:31] godly Christian. Amen.
[1:32:34] Give your life to Christ.
[1:32:36] Become a Christian. Get born again. Get
[1:32:39] the Holy Ghost in your life. And obey
[1:32:41] God in everything he leads you and shows
[1:32:44] you to do. Yes. and be a be a Christian,
[1:32:47] whatever it may do. One of the worst
[1:32:50] experiences I ever had in my life is
[1:32:52] when my parents drug me out to this
[1:32:54] desert.
[1:32:56] That's honest God's truth. I couldn't
[1:32:58] stand this place. I would just soon pull
[1:33:00] a bullet bullet in my brain if I
[1:33:02] couldn't get back to North Carolina. I
[1:33:04] didn't want to live. I hated this place
[1:33:06] so bad. That was the worst one of the
[1:33:09] worst things that's ever happened to me
[1:33:10] in my life. Amen. I hated it so bad.
[1:33:14] Amen. But what God was doing, I couldn't
[1:33:18] see or understand. God was bringing me
[1:33:20] out to this desert to meet my wife,
[1:33:25] to find her, to get her. And again, we
[1:33:29] should write a book, honey, on the
[1:33:31] things that God did to bring us
[1:33:33] together. It is absolutely a miracle. I
[1:33:36] wasn't even supposed to go to the school
[1:33:38] I was going to. I was supposed to go to
[1:33:40] a different school. I ended up in a I
[1:33:43] ended up as a as a 10th grader. I ended
[1:33:46] up in a ninth grade gymnastics class,
[1:33:49] gym gym class. I ended up in a ninth
[1:33:52] grade gym class as a 10th grader because
[1:33:55] that was the class she was in. I wasn't
[1:33:58] supposed to be in that class that I I
[1:34:01] just went I just went to the place and I
[1:34:03] just sat down. I just sat there. I
[1:34:05] didn't care. I didn't want to be there.
[1:34:07] I didn't want anything to do with it. I
[1:34:08] hated this place. I just want to go
[1:34:10] home. And finally, one of the teachers
[1:34:13] come around and said, "What are you
[1:34:14] doing?" I said, "I don't know. Don't
[1:34:16] care." "Where are you supposed to be?"
[1:34:17] "I don't know. Don't care." "Well, are
[1:34:20] you new?" "Yeah."
[1:34:22] "Well, you're supposed to be in class,
[1:34:23] right?" I said, "Far as I know." "Were
[1:34:26] you supposed to be, Jim?" "Yeah, I think
[1:34:27] so." Said, "Well, come on. You come to
[1:34:30] my class."
[1:34:32] Okay. I went and got to his class. I
[1:34:34] love ball. I love playing ball. Grew up
[1:34:36] playing ball. Amen. We went and uh uh
[1:34:40] and so I was in his class. All of a
[1:34:42] sudden, a 10th grader was in a ninth
[1:34:44] grader's class.
[1:34:48] You figure it out.
[1:34:51] And I love playing ball, but they
[1:34:53] selected they selected uh and was going
[1:34:56] to play ball, softball. And I I love
[1:34:58] playing softball. I love playing
[1:35:00] baseball. I grew up playing ball. So, I
[1:35:03] mean, that was just in my wheelhouse.
[1:35:04] But you know what I did?
[1:35:07] I sat on the bench and I watched them
[1:35:10] play. Didn't care. I didn't want to
[1:35:12] play. I don't want to have anything to
[1:35:13] do with it. I just sat there. Guess who
[1:35:15] else was sitting on the bench?
[1:35:18] That girl right there.
[1:35:20] Amen.
[1:35:23] You explain it. I I can't explain that.
[1:35:26] We're the only two on the bench. That
[1:35:29] whole game they they out there playing.
[1:35:31] one of my favorite things that I had to
[1:35:33] do in life. And I just sat there. I
[1:35:35] didn't want to be a part of it. But we
[1:35:37] started talking.
[1:35:39] Amen. When I left When I left North
[1:35:42] Carolina, when I left what then was
[1:35:45] junior high school, ninth grade, I was
[1:35:48] going to uh I was going to quit band.
[1:35:50] I've been in it since fifth grade. I was
[1:35:52] going to do something cooler. I wasn't
[1:35:54] going to be in band anymore. I was going
[1:35:55] to do that. I didn't want to do band. I
[1:35:57] was I was I was I was too uhh cool for
[1:36:02] that. Whatever you want to say. I I
[1:36:03] wasn't going to do band anymore. So I So
[1:36:07] but then I was there for two weeks in
[1:36:09] North Carolina. We moved out here.
[1:36:11] School had already started here because
[1:36:12] school starts here earlier and they
[1:36:14] already started here. So I went there to
[1:36:16] enroll. They looked at me and said,
[1:36:18] "Well, you can't do this. You can't do
[1:36:19] this. You can't do this. All these
[1:36:21] electives are all taken. All these
[1:36:22] classes are all full. What do you have
[1:36:24] left? I got to take one band.
[1:36:28] Really? So now I got to be in band
[1:36:30] again. Okay, I'll go. I'll be in band
[1:36:33] again. Guess who else was in band?
[1:36:39] Amen. I can't you can't explain these
[1:36:43] things, saints. So my so based on life
[1:36:46] instruction, I tell the young people,
[1:36:48] I'd said the first thing, Amen. be born
[1:36:51] again. Get the Holy Ghost. Be led of
[1:36:53] God. Do what he tells you, shows you. Go
[1:36:55] where he tells you. I said, "And God
[1:36:58] will put you in the position that you
[1:37:00] need to be in. And you will come across.
[1:37:03] You will at some point sometime somehow
[1:37:05] you will find the person that you're
[1:37:07] supposed to be with. Your paths will
[1:37:09] cross. You will come together. You will
[1:37:12] somehow. And with all the supernatural
[1:37:15] things uh that the Lord I know that if
[1:37:18] you're a child of God, God will bring
[1:37:20] this to pass. God will make this
[1:37:22] happen." Amen. He will bring you in the
[1:37:25] place to where you meet the person and
[1:37:27] you're in the position that God wants
[1:37:29] you to be in for the person that you're
[1:37:30] supposed to have. Amen. I feel the same
[1:37:33] thing about this subject. I think a lot
[1:37:36] of it is exactly the same thing here.
[1:37:39] Christ re the your position will be
[1:37:42] revealed to you by the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:44] Absolutely. being God and realizing and
[1:37:48] I knew and you have to know that that's
[1:37:51] what God's called you to do. That's what
[1:37:53] God wants you to do. That is your
[1:37:55] position. The Lord's revealed it to you.
[1:37:57] And then if you want to know whether
[1:37:59] it's the Holy Spirit or not, find out
[1:38:01] whether he blesses what you are doing.
[1:38:05] Amen. Now, not prosperity or monetarily.
[1:38:08] Amen. I've seen plenty of people have
[1:38:11] humongous churches and tons of money and
[1:38:14] prosperity and flowing in and all and
[1:38:16] what a bit more a pastor than uh uh than
[1:38:20] a skunk sprays perfume. Uh it just
[1:38:24] they're no more a pastor than than
[1:38:26] anything. You you listen and you see and
[1:38:29] they're just as evangelistic in their
[1:38:31] missionary in their ministry as as you
[1:38:34] would as you could even imagine. And you
[1:38:38] say, well, why are they why are they
[1:38:40] doing that? Why are they filling that
[1:38:42] fulfilling that position? Because it's
[1:38:44] convenient. Because it's easy. Because
[1:38:47] there's money. Oh, well, wait a minute.
[1:38:49] You Yeah. Yes, there's money. So, a lot
[1:38:53] of people think, well, why would you do
[1:38:56] something you're not supposed to do?
[1:38:58] You tell me. But prosperity doesn't
[1:39:02] always
[1:39:03] uh tell you or mean that it's God's
[1:39:05] blessings, right? But when God blesses
[1:39:08] you in something, you see the fruits of
[1:39:10] the labor. Amen. Amen. That's what you
[1:39:12] see. You see the productiveness. You see
[1:39:15] God moving in it. You see people's lives
[1:39:17] changing. You see how it makes you feel.
[1:39:20] Amen. Not because you can buy a new
[1:39:21] bigger house or a boat, but because God
[1:39:24] is blessing you and moving you into that
[1:39:27] place where he's continuing to reveal
[1:39:29] himself to you. And you can see in his
[1:39:31] word now, not that God will make you a
[1:39:33] popper, but you can see what God is
[1:39:35] doing in your life. and making it happen
[1:39:37] that way. Praise the Lord. I'm I'm
[1:39:40] praying right now the same thing for
[1:39:42] that place next door. Amen. Uh you think
[1:39:46] we You look and say, "Well, we only have
[1:39:50] a few people. Why would we worry about
[1:39:52] that?" But if the Lord told me to and
[1:39:54] the Lord said get it now, I would get it
[1:39:57] and he would pay the bill. He would the
[1:40:00] Lord would take care of that part of it.
[1:40:01] I wouldn't have to worry if he says do
[1:40:03] it. He does. He does it. Amen. Amen. You
[1:40:06] don't have to worry about it. But when
[1:40:08] but when you realize that you need to be
[1:40:11] in the position, the placement God's
[1:40:13] called us in, God reveal it to you and
[1:40:15] then he'll bless you in it. Amen. And if
[1:40:18] you stay in that, the Lord will continue
[1:40:21] to bless you in that. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:23] And reveal it and reveal it to you and
[1:40:26] show to you that that's where you're
[1:40:27] supposed to be. Now, let's go over to
[1:40:29] one more scripture. I'll close here in
[1:40:30] just a minute. Second Peter.
[1:40:36] Second Peter
[1:40:38] uh chapter 1.
[1:40:45] Amen.
[1:40:47] Second Peter chapter 1
[1:40:50] and I'll close here after this.
[1:40:55] Second Peter chapter 1 verse 10.
[1:40:58] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[1:41:01] diligence
[1:41:02] to make your calling and election sure.
[1:41:06] For if you do these things, you shall
[1:41:09] never fall. Amen. Well, to me that goes
[1:41:12] that goes along with the quote we just
[1:41:14] read. Brother Bram said,
[1:41:16] rightfully having faith. You rightly
[1:41:20] have faith, you won't fall. You know who
[1:41:23] you are, you won't fall. If you
[1:41:25] recognize the position that you're in,
[1:41:27] the Lord will always be with you and
[1:41:29] always bless you in it. If you do what?
[1:41:33] Give diligence.
[1:41:34] Amen. Be zealous. Be uh uh urgent about
[1:41:40] what your calling and election is. What
[1:41:43] you're calling. Calling is basically uh
[1:41:45] what it means. You are called to it.
[1:41:48] Amen. When I call you up on the phone, I
[1:41:51] call you. I don't call somebody else.
[1:41:53] I'm calling you. Right? Amen. When I
[1:41:56] call you, now sometimes we might have a
[1:41:59] wrong number and say, "Oops, I meant to
[1:42:01] call so and so." But a calling is just a
[1:42:03] calling. It says, "I called you." If I
[1:42:05] say, "I called brother Dennis." I called
[1:42:07] brother Dennis. So, why are you calling?
[1:42:10] Don't know, but I need to call you. So,
[1:42:13] I called him. Which leads us to the
[1:42:15] choosing or the election. The election
[1:42:18] is a is a choosing. Amen. I called you
[1:42:21] because I choose to call you. So, a
[1:42:24] calling is something that's that is is
[1:42:26] what it is. It's a calling. God's called
[1:42:28] you to that. It's God's calling. God
[1:42:32] says, "I want you here. I want you to do
[1:42:34] this." Amen. This is the position I want
[1:42:38] you to fulfill. Amen. And when I did
[1:42:41] that, I thought honestly uh I thought
[1:42:44] when I moved to Florida, I'd be there my
[1:42:46] whole life. I figured this is the Lord
[1:42:48] what the Lord wants me to do. I go and
[1:42:50] we'll establish a church. We'll have
[1:42:51] some people and we'll just have church
[1:42:53] until I die.
[1:42:56] But God doesn't always do it that way,
[1:42:58] right? And in fact, a lot of times God
[1:43:00] does it a different way. And the problem
[1:43:02] is a lot of people get a mis a
[1:43:04] misunderstanding that if God calls you
[1:43:07] to that, that's what you're always
[1:43:08] supposed to do from from now to
[1:43:10] eternity. And that's not always true,
[1:43:12] right? God might do it just for a few
[1:43:14] days or a few months or a few years. He
[1:43:17] might uh he might have somebody come and
[1:43:19] call and and that person stayed there
[1:43:21] for 50 years. Amen. But because that
[1:43:24] person came and established that church
[1:43:26] or whatever and was there for 50 years
[1:43:29] doesn't mean that you're supposed to be
[1:43:30] called to a place and be there for 50
[1:43:32] years.
[1:43:34] Because again, we're all different. Yes.
[1:43:36] Different reasons, different callings,
[1:43:37] different positions. Amen. That's that's
[1:43:40] why the Lord does what he does. That's
[1:43:42] our calling. When God calls you, God
[1:43:44] called you to that. And your election is
[1:43:46] the fact that God chose you.
[1:43:50] He called you because he chose you. God
[1:43:54] handpicked you. If you go look at the
[1:43:57] definition, that's basically what it's
[1:43:58] saying to handpick. God handpicked you
[1:44:03] specifically out of the entire billions
[1:44:06] of people on this planet to fulfill this
[1:44:09] calling that he's called you to. You are
[1:44:12] the one he chose.
[1:44:15] That's what the election is. To make
[1:44:17] sure that God's called you first. You
[1:44:19] know that God's called you. If you're a
[1:44:20] child of God, God's called you. And if
[1:44:23] God's called you, he's got a place for
[1:44:25] you. He's got something he wants you to
[1:44:26] do. He's got a place he wants you to
[1:44:28] fulfill. Amen. And God's handpicked you
[1:44:32] to do that. Yes. Amen. You say, "Well,
[1:44:34] but there's there's there's tens of
[1:44:37] thousands there's hundreds of thousands
[1:44:39] of mothers. Why did God pick me?"
[1:44:41] because God picked you to mother this
[1:44:44] person.
[1:44:46] Amen. You remember brother Green told us
[1:44:49] that brother Brandham told him that God
[1:44:52] had his daddy come over here and his mom
[1:44:54] come from over here just to breed just
[1:44:56] to come together to breed you. Remember
[1:44:59] he used the word breed like cattle uh to
[1:45:03] breed you.
[1:45:06] Amen. Amen. God called you, that mother
[1:45:09] to be the mother of this person or these
[1:45:12] people. Amen. He didn't call that mother
[1:45:15] to mother these people. He called you to
[1:45:17] mother these people.
[1:45:20] Amen. So that's why there's different
[1:45:22] ones that say, "Well, there's there's uh
[1:45:25] tens of thousands of of pastors. Why did
[1:45:28] God call me?" Amen. Because God called
[1:45:31] me to pastor this place right now. Amen.
[1:45:34] God called me to pastor here.
[1:45:37] He calls somebody else the pastor over
[1:45:38] there. You say, "Well, these people come
[1:45:41] here. Well, those people go there."
[1:45:43] Well, sometimes it gets confused and
[1:45:45] maybe people end up probably where I'm
[1:45:47] not supposed to be. But normally God has
[1:45:51] a specific pastor for a specific person
[1:45:54] or for specific people and the people
[1:45:57] are should be led of God to that place
[1:46:01] to sit under that pastor. Amen. when the
[1:46:04] person down the street is not supposed
[1:46:06] to come there and be under that
[1:46:08] ministry. They need somebody else for
[1:46:10] whatever reason. We don't know. You know
[1:46:13] the complexity of humanity, saints.
[1:46:16] Amen. We're not. That's the the one of
[1:46:18] the greatest mistakes people make is
[1:46:20] think that we're cookie cutter
[1:46:21] Christians.
[1:46:23] Amen. That we're all just perfectly
[1:46:25] exactly alike. No, we're not. Right? We
[1:46:27] are nowhere. There's no two of us that
[1:46:30] are anywhere close to being alike.
[1:46:32] Right?
[1:46:34] Amen. You put me and brother Dennis
[1:46:35] together. I love my brother. We agree
[1:46:38] greatly. We go out and have great
[1:46:39] fellowship together. Uh but he was born
[1:46:42] in a different nationality, born from
[1:46:45] different parents, born in a different
[1:46:46] state, had different friends, went to
[1:46:49] different schools, was exposed to
[1:46:50] different things than I was. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:54] But that doesn't change our
[1:46:55] relationship, but it makes us two
[1:46:57] completely different people. Right.
[1:47:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:02] That that's just a bit but because but
[1:47:04] God does that because one man can fill
[1:47:07] this position or one woman can fill this
[1:47:10] position where this woman can't do it
[1:47:12] right. Amen.
[1:47:15] That's why God calls us everyone
[1:47:17] different. Amen. Amen. We receive that
[1:47:20] spirit that God has. So we make sure
[1:47:23] that our calling and our election is
[1:47:25] sure. My calling. My election. Not
[1:47:28] somebody else's but my calling and my
[1:47:30] election. I don't want to try to be
[1:47:32] somebody else. I've done that before.
[1:47:34] I've I've confessed that to you before.
[1:47:37] Amen. That I've tried to uh tried to go
[1:47:40] and the popular ministry to preach what
[1:47:43] they preach. And I get through and have
[1:47:46] no more idea what I just preached and uh
[1:47:49] than if I was a blind man.
[1:47:52] And I'm like, this I can't I can't. This
[1:47:55] is not right. And the Lord showed me
[1:47:58] that's not right. Right. Amen. You
[1:48:00] preach what I showed you to preach.
[1:48:02] Amen. Amen. And then it and then when I
[1:48:05] come to understand a little more about
[1:48:07] what actually was being said, I look and
[1:48:10] I think that really doesn't fit the
[1:48:13] message, right? That really doesn't fit
[1:48:16] the scripture. You go back and say,
[1:48:18] "Well, I wish I hadn't preached that."
[1:48:19] But, you know, that's another another
[1:48:21] point. But I'm not that person and
[1:48:24] they're not me. I can't do what they do.
[1:48:27] But you know what? They can't do what I
[1:48:29] do either, right? Amen. That person up
[1:48:33] the street, they might have 10,000
[1:48:34] people in their church, but there's no
[1:48:36] way they can come and effectively pastor
[1:48:38] this church. Can't do it. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:42] Because they're not supposed to be here.
[1:48:43] They're supposed to be over there,
[1:48:44] right? And I'm not supposed to be I
[1:48:46] can't go effectively pastor that church
[1:48:48] because I'm not supposed to be over
[1:48:49] there. I'm supposed to be here, right?
[1:48:51] Amen. Now, can I pastor that church?
[1:48:54] Absolutely. Sure. I could. Amen. Could
[1:48:57] people keep coming and and and and uh
[1:49:00] have a full church or congregation?
[1:49:02] Absolutely. Sure. But where is it in
[1:49:05] Christ? That's what we want to do. We
[1:49:08] want to move forward in Christ. We don't
[1:49:10] want to just have church. We want to
[1:49:12] move forward in Christ. We want to be in
[1:49:14] our positions and continually to press
[1:49:16] forward in the position God's called us
[1:49:18] in. Not just to not just to come in out
[1:49:21] uh off the street and just have church
[1:49:23] on a Sunday just because we've got the
[1:49:25] place and we've got the time.
[1:49:28] Amen. We don't make time for God. Right.
[1:49:31] That's that's the most ridiculous thing
[1:49:33] I've heard people say. Right. We don't
[1:49:36] make time for God. God is my time. Amen.
[1:49:40] Amen. Anything else I fit into his
[1:49:42] schedule, right? If possible.
[1:49:46] Amen. And that's that's right. That's
[1:49:49] just that's who we are. Amen. I'm here
[1:49:51] this morning. We're here this morning
[1:49:52] because this is where God's called us.
[1:49:55] This is what we're supposed to do. This
[1:49:56] is where Amen. And regardless of
[1:49:59] anything else, this is what I'm supposed
[1:50:02] to do. This is who I'm supposed to be.
[1:50:04] Amen. And I want to fulfill it to the
[1:50:06] best of my ability. And I don't want to
[1:50:08] try to be somebody else. I don't want to
[1:50:10] do what somebody else did uh does. Amen.
[1:50:14] I used to, but I don't because God
[1:50:18] showed me I am who I am. We are who we
[1:50:20] are. And nobody else can take your
[1:50:22] place. Yes. Amen. Nobody else can
[1:50:25] fulfill your position but you. Amen.
[1:50:28] Let's stand if we could.
[1:50:34] Sometimes you end up like brother Brown
[1:50:37] talked about when people would
[1:50:40] um
[1:50:44] try to impersonate the gifts of the
[1:50:46] spirit that Lord had put in his life.
[1:50:48] Yeah. And the things that he did that um
[1:50:53] uh that that that was that was God
[1:50:55] called. It was God calling him to do
[1:50:57] those things.
[1:50:59] um
[1:51:03] people would try to impersonate. You end
[1:51:05] up with you end up with a bunch of
[1:51:07] impersonators.
[1:51:09] You end up with a bunch of people uh
[1:51:11] just acting and trying to be something
[1:51:13] they're not. That's just that's just
[1:51:16] ends up be carnal impersonations. Amen.
[1:51:20] Not not fulfilling the word of God, not
[1:51:21] fulfilling the spirit of God, not called
[1:51:24] by man, not appointed by man, but only
[1:51:28] by God. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's
[1:51:32] sing this chorus.
[1:51:35] Amen. I can't find it here, but Amen. We
[1:51:37] sing it many times, so we'll I'm sure we
[1:51:39] know it by heart anyway. Lord, prepare
[1:51:42] me. Amen. Prepare me to be a sanctuary.
[1:51:47] Praise the Lord. That's what I want.
[1:51:49] That's what we want for the Lord to
[1:51:51] prepare us.
[1:51:53] Because
[1:51:54] our whole lives, if we're a child of
[1:51:57] God, we were a child of God before the
[1:51:59] foundation. When we come in this world,
[1:52:01] God prepares everything we do, God's
[1:52:03] preparing us and getting us ready. Amen.
[1:52:06] To fulfill the position that God's
[1:52:08] called us to. Amen. Sometimes we're in
[1:52:12] the position that it's hard. It's not an
[1:52:16] easy position. Amen.
[1:52:19] But God blessed us and promised to be
[1:52:21] with us to help us through it. Amen. And
[1:52:25] that's what we want to do what he calls
[1:52:28] us to do. That's why when we get on the
[1:52:30] other side, it's going to be so good. We
[1:52:33] get there and he says, "It was well
[1:52:35] done,
[1:52:37] my good and faithful servant. Was well
[1:52:40] done. Enter into enter ye into the joys
[1:52:44] of the Lord."
[1:52:46] What words I desire to hear, saints, for
[1:52:49] the Lord to tell me was well done, my
[1:52:53] good and faithful servant.
[1:52:55] Amen. Let's sing this.
[1:52:58] Worship the Lord.
[1:53:01] Lord, prepare
[1:53:03] me
[1:53:05] to be a sanctuary,
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:11] pure and holy,
[1:53:16] tried and true.
[1:53:22] With thanksgiving,
[1:53:26] I'll be a living
[1:53:32] sanctuary
[1:53:37] for
[1:53:38] you.
[1:53:41] Yes, Lord, prepare me
[1:53:46] to be a sanctuary.
[1:53:52] Pure and holy,
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:57] tried and true
[1:54:03] with thanksgiving.
[1:54:07] I'll be a living
[1:54:13] sanctuary
[1:54:18] for you. One more time with all our
[1:54:21] hearts now. Yes, Lord, prepare
[1:54:25] me
[1:54:27] to be a sanctuary,
[1:54:33] pure and holy,
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:38] tried and true
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:43] with thanksgiving.
[1:54:48] I'll be a living
[1:54:54] sanctuary
[1:54:58] for you.
[1:55:03] Yes.
[1:55:04] Granted, Jesus. Yes. All we can do,
[1:55:07] Lord. Thank you. All that we are, we
[1:55:09] relinquish to you, Jesus.
[1:55:12] Lead us. Guide us. Help us. Show us.
[1:55:15] We're in your hands, Father. We need
[1:55:17] you. Amen. In every way. In every way.
[1:55:22] Praise the Lord. Amen. God is so good,
[1:55:25] isn't he? Amen. I love him so much. He
[1:55:29] means so much to us. Means so much to
[1:55:32] me. So thankful, Lord, in our lives.
[1:55:34] Where would we be without him?
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:39] So many times I see people
[1:55:42] Amen. even guys that would be on my team
[1:55:45] working and I think man that just in a
[1:55:49] certain way how they are. It just kind
[1:55:52] of reminds me of of Peter and you know
[1:55:56] Peter Peter was kind of a big mouth uh
[1:56:00] and always talking out of turn and
[1:56:02] bragging and stuff and and God told him
[1:56:05] said now Peter you know when you're
[1:56:07] converted now uh you you're you're
[1:56:10] saying all these things wrong to the
[1:56:12] point that I had to rebuke you and tell
[1:56:14] Satan to get behind me. Amen. But when
[1:56:16] you're converted then you can strengthen
[1:56:18] the brothers. So God took the strength
[1:56:21] that Peter had, his big old mouth, and
[1:56:24] on the day of Pentecost became the
[1:56:25] spokesman of the group. Amen. And spoke
[1:56:28] up, but it wasn't out of turn then. It
[1:56:31] was of the Holy Spirit. Was God leading.
[1:56:33] And I think sometimes I think my what a
[1:56:38] Christian this exists. Ju just give
[1:56:40] their heart to God. God got a hold of
[1:56:41] that man. He would just be unstoppable
[1:56:45] as a Christian, as a godly person. Amen.
[1:56:49] And I pray I pray I ask you pray pray
[1:56:52] for the the men on my team. Amen. I I I
[1:56:55] appreciate them. I mean, I've come close
[1:56:57] several times to saying I love them. Not
[1:56:59] sure I'm quite there, but I like them. I
[1:57:01] appreciate them very much. Uh and
[1:57:04] they're basically good men. Uh but they
[1:57:07] just need God. Amen. They need the Lord.
[1:57:11] Amen. So, I appreciate that. Appreciate
[1:57:13] the Lord's goodness. So, God bless you
[1:57:15] today. God bless. And u uh happy
[1:57:18] Father's Day. Father's one here this
[1:57:21] morning, brother brother Dennis. Happy
[1:57:23] Father's Day if you're watching. Uh
[1:57:25] brother Pat or brother Danny or
[1:57:27] whatever. God bless you. Happy Father's
[1:57:28] Day to you. Amen. And just pray it just
[1:57:31] be a blessed day for you. Amen. Also
[1:57:34] have a special day. But she's not here
[1:57:37] either. Sister Sheila is at home. She
[1:57:39] said she was going to be watching. It's
[1:57:41] her birthday. So God bless you, Sister
[1:57:43] Sheilia. Happy birthday to you. We Sarah
[1:57:46] need you personally if you were here,
[1:57:48] but we love you and appreciate you and
[1:57:50] happy birthday to you as well. Amen. So,
[1:57:53] God richly bless you. Thank the Lord for
[1:57:55] another year. Amen. Praise the Lord. We
[1:57:58] love sister and appreciate her so much
[1:58:00] being a part of our congregation here.
[1:58:03] So, God richly bless you. Amen. Bless
[1:58:05] each one. And we'll just uh be dismissed
[1:58:08] in a word of prayer. Uh, now next week,
[1:58:12] I know there's only a few of us here,
[1:58:13] but next week there's a very, very good
[1:58:16] chance. I've looked at the flight
[1:58:18] schedules and stuff. There's a very good
[1:58:19] chance that I will probably uh we'll
[1:58:22] probably have to move next Sunday up a
[1:58:25] half hour. Be the first time in a long
[1:58:27] time since I've had to do that. But, uh,
[1:58:30] we'll probably have to move it up next
[1:58:31] week. Uh the one flight that looks like
[1:58:33] it's going to be the one they'll pick
[1:58:35] for me probably is doesn't leave till or
[1:58:38] it leaves at 12:55.
[1:58:41] So 1:00 basically I've done one o'clock
[1:58:44] before but it's very it's very tight for
[1:58:47] me. So uh that's probably what will be
[1:58:50] happen. I'll probably uh say right now
[1:58:52] I'll let everybody know uh text you on
[1:58:55] Saturday or when I know of what's going
[1:58:58] on but it will probably just to prepare
[1:59:00] you probably have to be moved up a half
[1:59:02] hour next week. So, just please remember
[1:59:05] that if you would supposed to go to
[1:59:07] Idaho. Um, I don't know. It's probably
[1:59:11] be a little cooler up there maybe, but
[1:59:13] uh the job is uh is not a very is it's
[1:59:18] supposed to be a rough job. So, but um
[1:59:22] as my wife tells me all the time when I
[1:59:25] verbalize
[1:59:27] uh things like that, God can change it.
[1:59:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:33] Amen.
[1:59:35] And I believe that it is true. God can
[1:59:38] change that. It's supposed to be a very
[1:59:41] difficult job. U a dirty job. It's a
[1:59:45] It's an existing. It's not a new build.
[1:59:47] It's existing. So, they're always just
[1:59:49] filthy. It's amazing how disgustingly
[1:59:52] filthy a car wash can get. Uh but they
[1:59:55] do.
[1:59:57] And so,
[1:59:59] maybe is supposed to be uh probably a
[2:00:02] lot of long hours uh and hard work. So,
[2:00:06] but the Lord can change that. Yes. And I
[2:00:09] believe that. So, we're going to I I
[2:00:12] appreciate you praying together with me
[2:00:14] on that. Amen. So, Lord richly bless
[2:00:17] you. Amen. Love you. Appreciate you if
[2:00:19] you're watching still. God bless you as
[2:00:21] well. Amen. We'll be dismissing a word
[2:00:23] of prayer. Appreciate each one coming to
[2:00:25] be here today. Amen. With us. So, Lord
[2:00:27] Rich bless you. Anyone else have
[2:00:29] anything before we go?
[2:00:32] Anything on anybody's heart?
[2:00:36] Not we'll be dismissed. Ask Mike if you
[2:00:38] would
[2:00:40] pray.
[2:00:42] Gracious heavenly father come to you at
[2:00:44] the service. Father
[2:00:47] being with us talking to us and the
[2:00:51] songs.
[2:00:53] Thank you. Speaking to our hearts and
[2:00:54] allowing us to come together. Lord
[2:00:56] Jesus, once again, as we go our separate
[2:00:58] ways, Lord Jesus, celebrate our earthly
[2:01:01] fathers today, Lord Jesus, with our our
[2:01:03] friends and family, whatever you have in
[2:01:05] store for us, keep us safe through the
[2:01:07] rest of the week, till our next point
[2:01:08] time that we come together, we commit
[2:01:10] ourselves into our hands in the name of
[2:01:12] Lord Jesus.
