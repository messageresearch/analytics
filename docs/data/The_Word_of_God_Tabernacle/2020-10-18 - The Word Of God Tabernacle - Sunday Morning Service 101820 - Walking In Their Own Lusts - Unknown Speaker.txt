grant that to us one more time in this service today as we commit it all to you and ask this uh of your blessings and honor lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen jude uh we're just going to read uh i'll tell you what we'll just read one verse and i'll let you be seated because i want to read most of the chapter but we'll just let you be seated after uh we read the um let's see the 16th verse just read the 16th verse kind of catches jude in the middle of a thought here but uh we'll go back and and pick it up here after we let you be seated but the 16th verse says these are murmurs complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaking great swelling words having man's uh persons in admiration because of advantage you could be seated if you'd like now i just read that verse uh to draw the text from today because i just want to title this if we could walking in their own lust uh walking in their own lust kind of came to uh something yesterday and thinking about the times that we live and you know uh minister and of course pastor um you know there's there's quite a uh a buffet if you will of of things that the lord has given us in the word the message and uh subjects and things today and you know if if a person with an anointed gift and look at what's going on in the world today in our lives and in churches and take the scripture uh we can preach another 10 000 years you can take every god called minister take the bible circumstances the things going on and preach another each one preach another 10 000 years not not accumulative but all together another 10 000 years just on this little bit so uh there's there's much to cover but this is just something that came on my heart and and as i read through this and what jude said about this it really struck me as how prominent what he said here really speaks to in my opinion and i hope maybe to yours after today what's going on today and of course the great deal of the bible does but it's almost like jude uh gave a six o'clock news report last night of what's going on in the events of the world today very much uh so let's just go back to the third verse and we'll start there and uh we'll end up going back through 16th verse again remember the topic today of the subject the title is walking in their own lusts walking in their own lusts and think about that want to make sure that we in our lives that we don't do that that that's not something that we fall in micah check that camera it doesn't look like it's quite pointing this way is it okay yeah okay all right it looks like it's pointing down there i mean god bless you amen welcome to the streaming today jude the third verse let's begin reading here beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhorts you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints now of course we we one time tackled this uh um this subject of earnestly contending for the faith but that third verse uh is is quite outstanding considering that jude is putting so much descriptive adjectives in this verse if you look at it he says diligence common salvation needful for me to write exhorts you that you earnestly contend what was delivered i mean he's being very uh very poignant about what he's trying to get across to us and very descriptive about his adjectives and helping us understand what he's saying in his heart and why the holy spirit is moving him is very important and it's very important that we look at it and take heart to what is being said as a christian as a bible believer uh and a literal bible believer and what the bible teaches us that this is quite an outstanding thing that he's trying to tell us to make sure that we earnestly content our earnest we should be there and our contention should be there for that faith for the faith that was once delivered to the saints now that of course we know is falling into of malachi 4 5 6 and the turning of the hearts of the children back to the fathers again of that faith that was once delivered to the saints which that same faith today delivered to a bride takes her into a place not just where they were but into a body change into a rapture amen for there are certain men crept in unawares as we've said before uh i believe that those men came in crept in unawares because they blended right in with the group they they weren't recognized as an outsider or a demonic spirit coming and filtrating in a church or in a service because they looked and acted just like the rest of those that were there so those that come in that crept in they crept in unaware you didn't recognize it or unders or see it because they they looked and sounded and acted just like the rest of of of the group there who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness which is uh an unbridled lust is what lasciviousness is it is an unbridled lust or filth and these are ordained or preordained to this condemnation ungodly turning the grace of god now look what they turn into unbridled filth they turn the grace of god into unbridled filth that's how they walk in their own lusts they're walking in their own lusts not just an act understand this uh title that we take and when we get back to the 16th verse it's not just an act it's not just something that takes place these are literally walking this is the value of their lives is walking talking continually every day perpetually walking in their own lust not just caught up in a trap or a mistake or something like that these people literally are living this life of unbridled filth amen understand unbridled filth think of that keep all these things please in your mind and you think about what's going on in the world today and not just in the world think about even the christian as we call it today christian world or the church world the unbridled filth that continues to walk in amongst people completely devoid of conscience completely devoid of any christian or biblical value amen that's why it's so important if you look at this friend uh if you look at this to recognize how important it is can i just use a quote i just use the quote brother branham said if you don't get your children to god first rock and roll will get them every time now of course rock and roll is devolved in and i say devolved you'd think when it rocked right brother angel you didn't think you'd get any worse right well it did it's de-evolved down into hip hop and rap and all this other just filthy ungodly unbridled lust just filth disgusting horrible music well they call it music so i guess i'll have to team it that way too but the point being is when uh when a child is born when we are born we're born with the nature to continue to live by what the flesh affords us by the desires of the flesh because look friend we all know even the young people here you know it's easier to follow the whims and the lusts of the flesh than it is to obey god in his words right because obeying god in his word is harder and greats against your flesh more than if you just give in and just do whatever the desire of the flesh tells you to do right it's harder it is more of a struggle it's a fight that's why that's why he said we must contend contending is a fight contending is something that you have to struggle that you have to battle your way through and and and it's probably harder and i and there's i'll say probably i'll say it is harder today for young people than it was when i was a young person or when sister norma says lydia brother dennis or danny it's harder now than it was when we were kids that's right it's harder than when tabitha and zachary micah were kids it's going to be if the lord would tarry it's going to be harder for emma and and joel than is for you because of the unbridled filth that's going on in the world today right and the the desires that's out there to try to draw you and it's and it's going to draw because it's easier right right it's easier to give in to the temptation of the flesh it's easier to give in to just do what you feel like you want to do one of the most ungodly advertisements in my opinion in the entire world was when nike and in my opinion you can like nike or not i hate them but uh hate's a strong word but they they seem to stand for everything i stand against so but they came out with a slogan just do it oh that's about one of the most ungodly things that that that is ever just in three words has conjured up to deceive people into in into following along with that what does that mean that means if you feel like it just do it if you're if the lust of the flesh compels you just do it just give in doesn't matter it's okay just do it how how ungodly that is because it it it comes against everything that god is moving in our lives to bring us to to just do it no we don't just do it we do what god calls us what his word commands for us what his spirit is moving us to do not just what we think we should do or not what we're just what we feel like we should do but that's how much easier it is and if you don't have the holy ghost and if you're not born again friend you cave into that lust of the flesh every time amen every time let's continue to move on though that word lasciviousness you think about it it hits hard they turn the grace of god into lasciviousness they turn god's grace god's unmerited favor this is so sad his unmerited grace favor they turn into an unbridled filth because they make it like well you just do okay and you know just just live like you want to live and be like you want to be and and god will forgive you it's okay the grace of god will take care of it the blood of jesus christ will take care of it just live however you want it's okay and that's what a lot of the christian world does today they don't understand or see the value or the biblical reference or or truth of living a holy life right a lot of people call it uh legalism legalism is thinking that being living that way is going to get you to heaven we don't believe that but we do believe in living a holy life we do believe in living a biblical godly holy life so that god is pleased with our lives so that when our life is over we go to be with him amen but people have turned that grace into lucifer until unbridled filth that's horrible the grace of god but praise the lord there's a group of people that know how what the value of god's grace really is they know what the grace of god means to them and they know that they do everything they can as they obtain that grace of god to live according to god's word so that we are not displeasing to him they turn the grace of god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ so how do they deny him by denying his word right how do they deny his word by disobeying it you disobey god's word you deny god's word if you live however you want you're basically saying you don't believe what god's word says right if you if you preach some dogma that a church or a school taught you you're denying jesus christ because you're denying the word oh but he's standing up there talking about jesus but if he's talking about him in contrast to his own word he's denying the very god he claims to serve right right they're denying jesus by denying the word when you deny the word you deny the the the un the the undefiled uh uh uh word of god the the the present-day truth the message you deny that you deny jesus that's just that's just truth right um if a person decides to live an unbridled uh lust filth if they decide to turn the grace of god into lasciviousness if they decide that they you know just do it and you know you go into some booth and you pay repentance or whatever you get absolved by some priest and they cross you and stuff and that's okay you you're good you can go on filth they deny jesus christ they hold a cross around their neck with the crucifix on it and not just catholics but uh uh but others i don't mean to necessarily call out catholics but it's uh you know one of the more hypocritical ones around but anyway uh it's everywhere it's laden all over uh christendom it's late with it because if you deny god's word if you deny to obey god's word if you deny to live according to god's word you are denying jesus christ i will therefore fifth verse i had a feeling when i was going through this yesterday i'll just be perfectly honest with you saints i was when i was going through this yesterday and i read through uh jude i thought i don't know if i'll ever get through anything because i got a lot of notes and other scriptures here that i'll ever get to i i think it's going to take the whole time just to get through jude but anyway you pray for me amen uh i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having spared the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believes not so he destroyed the unbeliever so if god destroyed the unbeliever then what's going to happen to the unbeliever today exact same thing god doesn't change his pattern god doesn't change anything god is god amen amen he doesn't change his ways he doesn't change his uh tactics he doesn't change his uh uh ideas thoughts the way he did it one time he does it all the way so if he destroyed the unbeliever then he'd do the same thing today right same thing's gonna happen the thing that we pray for and and work towards is they help to try to make as many people believe as possible right and and by believing i mean they they don't just uh uh come to this church but they believe and live by the word yes jesus christ the word sixth verse and the angels look now the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation revelation 12. you go back and read it kept not their first estate but left their own habitations he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day you know brother adam talked about those fallen angels right uh being like luther wesley not the people the men themselves but those that came after them they brought forth the truth that truth then became denominated by what the church denominated under it the truth can't be denominated but the words that they took to denominate based on someone's opinion of what was said and they denominated that and when they denominated that it died and all those that were there under there fallen angels amen just like revelation 12 those fallen angels they were there in heaven had their first estate as angels unto god they believed the devil's lie and they fell down with him now the bible says jude says they kept not that estate they received everlasting change in darkness to the day of judgment that great day well if he did that to those angels which he created in that condition at that state what will he do to the unbeliever you know the bible says if if uh if if the righteous scarcely be saved where do the sinner and the ungodly appear that's right amen if the righteous are scarcely we'll just say barely we squeak in praise the lord i don't care if i squeak in as long as i'm in that's right and that's i mean i want to get in with blazes that's fine but if i squeak in as long as i'm in i'm fine i can be the bottom of the totem pole i can i could be the dirt of which the pole is on as long as i'm there the thing that matters the most but it says if the righteous scarcely be saved and scarce is just you know one out of a million or not very many see but at the righteous scarcity where did the sin and ungodly appear even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities about them and like manner giving themselves over to fornication going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire the judgment comes now we all know that sodom and gomorrah suffered a judgment of fire and brimstone pouring down on that city and completely destroying it right then it sunk beneath the sea that's right so we know that that fire there eventually quenched itself it's not deal burning today but what what jude is talking about is the individuals that live the lives that he's talking about giving themselves over to fornication going after strange flesh were set forth as an example and people want to get rid of that example today the sodom and gomorrah is as good of example today in what's going on in this world and what i know of scripturally amen and god destroyed it then what do you think god's doing now right god is destroying it now amen of the vengeance of an eternal fire so what's going on the city sodom and gomorrah the the fire of the city has been quenched what fire has yet to be quenched jude says the vengeance of eternal fire those that were living ungodly those that were living in unbridled lust and filth and i'm just not i'm not talking about just the filth of the flesh i'm talking about uh a a desire of flesh i'm talking about the filth of the disobedience of god's word that's as big of filth as there is the other is just a result of that unclean living is just a result of fornication fornication is just unclean living it's just a result you remember brother adam said only sin is unbelief right there's a lot of sins we consider but there's only one sin that's unbelief you do these things they're attributes of unbelief right right so one just it follows in in in the other so it's the same thing the vengeance of eternal fires the fact that those that were there living those kinds of life are still going to suffer that same vengeance that same suffering of eternal fire if he did it then he's still doing it today but it's a sad place my mind just gets filled with so many things let's go to the eighth verse likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities maya that's not that could have been that could have been the headline of the six o'clock news last night that could probably be the headline of the six o'clock news tonight it could have been a headline of the newspaper they printed this morning or on facebook or or what other other social media there is that could have been the headline almost every day what is it filthy dreamers defiling their flesh despising dominion people who don't like to be told what to do people who don't like laws people who don't like rules right speaking evil of dignities they don't they don't want a ruler they're anarchists they're burning down cities in this country they're looting buildings they're destroying lives they're killing people because they don't like authority they don't want to be told what to do they want to just do it they don't want to be they want to continue to live in the unbridled lasciviousness filth that they've been living in they want it to continue to stay that way and if you speak out against that they will hurt you or kill you or destroy your home or destroy your family or or or uh vandalize your home or business that's why so many people are quiet today because they don't want to be victims of that and our country's gotten so bad that if you try to defend yourself against that you'll go to jail right it's sad what it has gotten to but it's exactly according to the scriptures anarchists they don't want to be told what to do they don't want to have a law they don't want to have a rule they want to just live however they want they want to get rid of the police they want to be able to police themselves so you see how good that happens you know everybody talks about getting out of the wild west where there was a lot of policing of your own selves and you see how that turned out right and look what's happening today people just want to live do whatever they want to do live however they want to live and if you say anything about it or against it you are considered an enemy you are considered someone to be destroyed your life to be destroyed i read an article i'll just say this i read an article yesterday i believe it was yesterday where a dozen people or so was protesting in a city because they wanted freedom of speech they wanted the first amendment of our constitution to be exercised in every corner of this country and 200 people come and beat them to a pulp just because they were exercising their first amendment right to freedom to speak 200 of them come knocked a man's tooth or two out beat them up now of course they were outnumbered if they weren't if they'd done something they'd they would have gone to jail beat them up because they did not agree with freedom of speech right that's how sad it has gotten yes yes despising dominion and speaking evil of dignity he said well if trump wins be a great place deal oh if five wins you'll change everything and be a great place friend this place has been reserved for fire this place is reserved unto judgment right amen now one over the other may give us a little more time of grace but this whole place is set to be burned that's right because of this and it doesn't matter if one or the other gets in these people will still exist they will still hate the dignities they will still hate the dominion they will still want to continue to live in their unbridled lusts my mind yet michael look now michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuked thee amen that's about what it's got to today right and in the world that we live today it does not bring out railing accusations i guess they'll shoot you if you do but we just say lord it's in your hands yes amen you take care of it amen and he is and he will well if there's just one more god and all that's going on lord if there's just one more seed if there's just one more person i can help some way help me to help them help me to help them somehow if i can but these speak evil of those things which they know not there you go ignorant ignorance is not knowing amen stupidity is knowing and just not giving value to it ignorance is just not knowing they just don't know and that's the problem they speak evil of those things because they don't know right they just don't know and do they not know because nobody told them did they not know because they don't hear it anyplace else i mean you know some things i just don't want to say um they speak evil of things that they don't know about who is supposed to teach them how are they supposed to learn well there's a time or a man and a woman not two women not two men but a man and a woman come together and they procreate a child is born whose responsibilities that child born to not just the mother not just the father but the parents the parent is then by god's rule required to raise that child in the nurture and admonition of god and train that child and the way it is supposed to go right you're supposed to know this you don't know it why because you haven't been taught right you haven't been told and of course if all they listen to is something that sends them in one direction that's all they're going to listen to that's all they're going to know they're not going to know the other side and who's ever heard the phrase there's two sides to every argument pretty much everybody in here except maybe emma i've heard there's two sides to every argument right two sides to every argument but if you only hear one side you don't even know anything else right you don't even know they're ignorant of it they speak evil of it because they don't know right if they haven't been raised right if they haven't been taught right if they don't know jesus saints that's our responsibility to try to help them to come to know there is a better way there is a god there is a lord jesus that loves you and wants to take you into his bosom and make you his own and make your life beautiful and give you a life beyond this life i will have to give kudos to a lady that we saw i'll call her a lady and and coming from my lips that is a you take it from me that comes from my lips that is the best compliment a woman can get from you right that you're a lady and you have to be a lady and act like a lady amen otherwise you're just a woman i remember one time i was working at my purchasing manager job in north carolina and i went to the warehouse to do something i came out and we were doing having some construction done outside and and there was a woman out there and she was working she had her jeans on and she was just going at it you know just like a man and that couple guys came around me and i knew everybody and they're like man that's quite a lady out there i said that's not an old lady that's a woman but that's not a lady a lady wouldn't be out there doing that right anyway this lady she was standing on the corner out there at the campbell and prince we couldn't see her sign and sonia looked at it for a second she said that's in spanish i don't even know what it says but as soon as we started getting past it it looked like by the best we could see it said uh god loves you or jesus loves you or christ loves you christo uh i couldn't see it but whatever it was i thought well good for her she's actually out doing at least somebody might read her sign who didn't know that they might know now right they might not believe it but at least they might know it amen at least they know that's our job help us lord to spread the word to let them know so they know they speak evil of things they don't know but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves the flesh woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the heir of balaam for reward and perished in the game saying of core now there's a process that takes place there we'll go through that maybe the lord willing we'll go through that process in a minute there's a scripture and james that gives us that process it's it's incredible but it's true they go the way of cain we know how cain went killed his own brother they become greedy for filthy luker just like balaam did you know brother brown called balaam a hireling prophet called him a prophet now he was a prophet but he was a hireling prophet he was a man for sale his prophetic gifts were for sale unfortunately there's probably a lot of people god help us i got to be careful and say this but are you just for the money right they do this just for money they want money they want praise they want fame they want a hand clap they want to paddle in the back but they want the money they're looking to become rich at 12 million mansions right yes that does exist yes there's preachers that call themselves in this country that own five and six airplanes 12 million dollar mansions right so they go the way of cain they fall into the the the filth of balaam which balaam taught the taught the people now and balaam really was the epitome of the lasciviousness taking the grace of god which they lived under the law then but god still favored them god gave them a way see to be able to still be under the blood it wasn't the blood of christ but the blood of bulls and goats but it was sufficient that god made for them right but balaam come and hired a prophet and convinced those people that they were all family that they were all one and they were all together and that they should all come and be one big great sweet group friend it's not supposed to be that way that's not the way it was then that's not the way it is now right now there's a bride that's around the world and and and there's different pockets around and that's fine that's great it should be that way i mean if they were that way in the bible how do you think it's going to be any different today even paul and barnabas became so contentious with each other that they had to separate go two different ways right they created can i say this i don't mean this scripturally but metaphorically they created two different churches right they became two different pastors of two different groups paul went one way and barnabas went the other who did that god did that because with instead of two people going to the same group he sent two people to go to two different groups right so this gospel got spread twice as quick as if paul and barnabas says stay together that's right friends god knows what he's doing yes yeah amen i'm gonna preach on that here pretty soon lord willing i got a couple other things in my heart really burning maybe for the next couple of weeks but we'll just see how the lord does with that but now a balaam he goes after the way of cain with no cain balaam taught the people to commit fornication against god's word to go against god by saying we're all family we're all here we're just one falling off the money that baal gave him amen ungodliness and then perished in the gang saying of course right these are spots in your feast of charity in other words uh you can live an ungodly a lot of people i mean be careful there's people today that think that their good deeds are going to get them into heaven right they live like a devil but they do good things so they think the good things are going to outweigh the devilish life that they're living when a lot of people you understand the next phrase i'm going to say people will believe what you do more than they believe what you say right and i may have butchered that a little bit but that's basically the gist of it right people will believe you more of what you do than what you say amen so they might say one thing or they might be giving charitable things but over here they're living the life of the devil completely against the word well jude is just saying that all of this ungodly living is spots in their charity in all their good deeds their good deeds are spotted cankered rotten filled good deeds are good i'm not going to say anything of a good good news if somebody's given to a good charity that's that's doing good things for people that's wonderful and fine but that work that life that they live is the spot and the canker and the rot in all the good that they're doing when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clout listen he gets pretty hard now you think i've been hard listen to what jude says here clouds they are without water clouds without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth and what good is a fruit tree if it's not giving good fruit right go sit in it for shade maybe but you said are any tree for a shade what's a fruit tree good for if it's not giving good fruit right their fruits withered without fruit twice dead and plucked up by the roots that means they're finished twice dead yes separated but then plucked up from the root twice dead and plucked up from the roof someone plucked from the roof friend has no hope a plant that you plug from the root is dead it's gone it's not gonna live because the root is the life the root is where it gets the water the nutrients to feed the plant if the roots are plugged up it's dead it's gone it is worthless it is fodder for the fire right that's all it is and that's what he's calling these people raging waves of the sea foaming out of their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever mercy and friend if you're like me that hits you hard because you don't want to see anybody go to hell right you don't want to see anybody go to this place i know i've been preaching hard about this friend but not that doesn't mean i want anybody to do it that doesn't mean i want anybody to go there experience that i want everybody to hear this see this and turn their lives to christ amen forever and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him these are murmurs 16th verse again now these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts walking after their own lusts they're not to be told what to do they're not taught to be told how to live they're not to be told where to go they're not to be told how they're supposed to speak and do and live and say they're not to be told these things they live after their own lusts they live after their own dictates they live after their own purpose and their own will they're not giving over to the to to the uh life of a that gives life they're not they're not they're giving themselves to a god that wants to lead them and guide them into truth they're living their own lives they're murders walking after their own lusts their their mouths speaking great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage they've been advantaged money usually in today's life society money rules everything today right uh i mean the bible was certainly right on and jesus said it's easier to camel to go through the eye of the needle the rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven uh the the love of money is the root of all evil the love of money right you could have this room full of hundred dollar bills nobody know anything about it wouldn't hurt a soul but as soon as the first person found out about it told the second person and more people find out they'll be shooting and killing each and running over people out here and destroying people and killing them just to get in here to get a couple hundred dollars right yeah they would yeah to try to get much in here because of the love of money if you look at it government politics media everything everything is run by the greed of money everything right you say well it's for this purpose but what's behind that purpose it's usually going to be the love of money right usually going to be the love of money that's why brother branham said that uh and and i love america i love the united states best country of the world best country ever been or ever will be because we're about to finish this up but uh outside of god's kingdom of course but in this world but brother and said democracy is never going to work as good as it's done and as well as it's been for this country democracy doesn't work the only kingdom that works the only government that works is is a monarchy is a kingdom is the kingdom with a king that has the heart of the people if a king rules over his kingdom with the heart of the people as his royal ship as his rulership that that works right i think well that's perfect because that's exactly what god is god god is the king who has the heart of his people amen and everything that god does he does because and for his people right that's why everything works to our good because he loves us yes and if he loves us then it's going to work and that's what works amen and we're and we're going to that place we're going to that place amen while we're here i'll i'll because of the serpent's seat i'll stick with the democracy and the and the free uh the uh free market and the uh or the way our economy i'll stick with what we got now because of serpency you get rid of serpentine you got a whole different uh accountability then amen amen murmurs complainers walking after all us and they're now speaking great swelling words having men's persons and admiration because of advantage but beloved remember ye the words which we which were spoken before the apostles of our lord jesus christ now that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit they are not born again they don't have the spirit of god amen they might have a mere anointing but that anointing when it goes away or rubs off or lifts off of them they're simply a brute beast like the 10th first says in the natural as a brute beast they corrupt themselves right that's how they are corrupted let's find we'll see what jude is speaking of here second peter chapter three second peter chapter three santa ate about three fourths of my time second peter chapter three verse one this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance which is the exact same thing jude said really he said you would know these things uh peter also said um i think it's in the first chapter here that though that uh first peter 1 2 peter 1 12 where where i will not be neglige puts you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth here he says in both which i stir up your mind your pure minds by the way of remembrance again we're back to second peter 3 2 now that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of our lord and savior knowing this first first first and foremost that there shall come in the last days what days are we living we're living in the last days the these are the last days i don't know how many more days we have but of course the last days uh that we're living in we can uh we could say church ages or church days or into or out of the laodicean age into the bright age a day in which the bride lives that she's called out of a church because she's his bride the bride called out of the church amen okay in this last days it's that last day the bright age scoffers walking after their own lusts scoffers people that even if you show them sometimes now this is not to dissuage anybody from showing the right way but showing them the right way laugh scorn make fun of make light of say that you're old-fashioned say you're a holy role whatever name or adjective you know it's it's common today it seems like uh in the world or politics or whatever to call somebody a xenophobe or an islamic phobe or a homophobe or some kind of foe but everybody's a foe today you know and none of it's good you know except them they're not folks they don't have a phobia that you know you just have the phobia see all the people have the phobia so you're going to be labeled something and it's probably not going to be good because you follow god and most of the time with most people this is my honest opinion with most people their heart is and they have a soul that's worth 10 million worlds and that soul cries out for something and because they can't obtain it when they see someone that has it creates an anger and a hatred in that person because they see you and they recognize and i think they realize that there's people there that are good honest godly holy ghost filled the people that live according to the dictates of god's word and they can't somehow attain to that and they hate you for it right they're scoffers yes they scoff anything about it so what's the first thing someone does most people do it's human nature most people first thing they do when they reach a place that they realize they have they don't have something they probably need they put it down they make fun of it oh that's nothing that's no big deal oh there's nothing to that well they know there is they just can't get there they don't probably even want to get there but they know there's something to it they know there's something to the way that you live they know there's something to the way you dressed they know that you're that you're conservative god loving you live the way you talk the way you dress the way you do they know there's something to that that's my heart i could be wrong and there could be some out there that's just that just pure satan incarnate that don't but i believe i know every human born has a soul right and that soul to god is precious and we're 10 million worlds so if that's the case and god puts everybody on the same basis i just i just can't help believe that there's just something there they know that's right they can't attain to it so what do they do someone's deficient in an area what do they do the area they're deficient in they try to be little right they try to put down or say oh that's not important oh that that that doesn't mean anything oh you don't have to live like that a lot of churches will tell you that right you try to live and you find the dictates of god's word is for holiness and you live a holy standard oh you don't have to live like that you're under bondage that's what they'll do right because they themselves fail to attain to the place that they see and know there's something about your life it ain't just the way you dress it ain't just the way you talk it's not just the way you look or act it's not because there's places you won't go it's not because that you're faithful to christ his word and prayer and church it's not that it's that they know there's something there beyond all that right and they know that it's good it's honest it's pure it's holy it's righteous they know that but all they can do is attack oh you don't have to live like that you don't have to dress like that jesus loves you anyway right jesus loves you he just is concerned with what's on the inside yeah but if what's on the inside is going to manifest what's on the outside it proves what's on the inside and if what's on the outside is not reflecting jesus christ in the word then you can pretty well assume what's on the inside isn't jesus christ or the word amen that's right but all they can do is put it down scoffers they're walking after their own lust and they try to convince you to walk this way walk after your own lusts and you'll be happy just like i am they're not happy i'm sorry friend those people aren't happy it don't matter how much money they got those people are plum miserable and they know it but they try to hide it by detracting by deflecting by putting you down by trying to make you look like that you aren't what you say you are when you know god has called you to a higher walk you know god has called you to a higher calling god has called you to be his child and to live according to his word and they know that right they're mad because they can't do it right and they're scoffers because of it they make fun of you that's right talk about you put you down because of that oh you look silly you look foolish why don't you cut off that nasty hair you ever heard that anybody ever sisters you ever heard that i've had my family members told that i've had my mother told why don't you cut that nasty hair off by her own family right but what are they doing they're just lashing out because they don't live that way they know there's something to it because they see a life behind the hair amen they see a life behind the dress they see a life behind the godliness and holiness they see the life they know you're different right amen james i i do want to get to this i got four or five more scriptures and i'm about out of time but let's go to james james chapter one praise the lord amen i don't know how many times probably not micah so much but tabitha got asked in school why do you look like that why do you dress like that why is your hair like that you know is it your religion you know of course in pine top you they think you're mormons me and roger did a job the other day and the guy asked us are you mormons you know because mormons have a reputation of living being decent moral people and you know not being pierced and tatted everywhere so you know they're kind of kind of look like that clean and whatever you'd say and are you mormons not mormons just just godly bible-believing ministers christians you know but i can't tell you how many times she probably got asked that question just tell them i live my life according to the bible amen what the bible says that's how i try to live my life amen does that sound good amen or do your parents make you do that no my parents don't have to make me i want to that's where you need to be oh no my parents don't make me i live this way because i want to live this way i dress like this because i want to be pleasing to my lord i love the lord jesus he is my life and i want to be pleasing to it that's simple amen james 1 13 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god look at this right this is something a lot of people now of course message people mostly understand this but there's people out in the world that they actually literally think that god tempts them god may allow the devil to do something right god doesn't tempt a person that's what the bible says let no man say when he is tempted i'm tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth any man amen god doesn't do that right he might allow the devil to do something to you or attempt your test or whatever their tests come but they don't god doesn't directly do that see but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed so look at this progression here because i'll probably end with this maybe i have one more scripture anyway follow this progression here every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed right so the temptation comes when he is drawn away by his own lusts right he is tempted when he is taken away by his own lust and when you're taken away and drawn out of we'll say away from god the word the blood of christ then you become tempted and when you become tempted of your own lust through your own mind through your own spirit imagination affection reason memory then you become enticed that's the enticement the temptation is the enticement but you're not tempted or enticed until you allow yourself to be drawn away in your own lust right hide yourselves in the word friend and the temptation's not there right your own lust does not exist when you are hiding your life in the word amen temptation is not there the enticement is not there keep yourself in christ in the word and the temptation's not there even when the desire to strike back at somebody who has struck at you and trust me we're all in flesh we're all humans don't think that any of us are exempt from that because we're all in the flesh and human right you must resist that devil and flee from him right amen resist that devil get thee behind me satan and if somebody lashes out then you just you know you just stay godly and calm and just be the christian you are that way you're not tempted you're not enticed amen right you don't follow with your own lust that's the first step see if you don't allow yourself to get into that position you won't be enticed right then when lost but not the progression continues let's just say someone's been pulled out into their own lust then when lust has conceived now what is conception conception is when a seed has been planted right amen a seed is planted is conception whether with a child with a human when the seed is planted that's conception not bird conception so when the conception takes place after that lust the seed has been dropped well the seed is something that is planted that comes and and will come forth but it it that seed has life in it event that it's given life first it did not have life to it but when the seed drops in there's life now the life is going to be a representative of what the seed is and if the seed is a seed of enticement or temptation or lust then what is going to branch from that seed filth unbridled filth amen so the next progression after the temptation enticement is the conception then at lust brings conception a seed has been dropped a seed has been planted then it bringeth forth what that seed brings forth is sin unbelief brings forth sin and sin when it is finished brings forth death best thing to do don't re let yourself get into the place of the enticement the temptation but even in that point that lust because that lust will generate conception a seed will get dropped usually the seed will drop into your mind reach into your heart amen as a man think within his heart so is he would would drop down into a person's heart because that's where the sin uh comes from it can be conceived in the mind but it drops into the womb then it brings forth the life that whatever it is in it amen it doesn't understand it can be conceived in the mind but it doesn't bring forth life in the mind it brings forth life from the heart the life comes from the heart the bible doesn't say as a man thinketh he is no uh or in his mind think it in his heart so it can be conceived up here because you know these endless we have these big old ears and eyes and things and you know those things can bring forth lust and thoughts and stuff and it might be a seed dropped and conceived but then when that thing drops down into your heart then that seed starts bringing forth life because from the heart you begin to do and live and act and talk and it could be as quickly as let's just take the example i said someone is berating you or speaking angrily towards you it can be you've left by your own lust the seed is dropped and you're speaking something negative or saying foul words or being horrible to somebody before you hardly even know what's going on it can be that fast it can be just like this you say with this three-step process you know first i do it and it's a while and this happens and this happens no it can be just like this it can be that fast yes first thing stay guarded by the word amen don't let that come into your life into your heart and then stand forth because when it does that sin that's that that seed that's conceived that drops into the heart that brings forth life that life leads you to death right that life that seed that sin that is conceived brings death that's his progression the finish of it he says is when it bringeth forth death god help us i don't want to be dead what is death death is eternal separation from god i dares believe any of us in here none of us want to be eternally separated from god period amen regardless circumstances or where it goes comes nobody wants to be separated from god do not air my beloved brother do not err do not fall by the by this by the the desire of that sin the desire the lust that lust that lust is an inordinate sinful pleasure desire inordinate inordinate means unnatural right it's not a natural desire our natural desires are for jesus christ for god the word that's our natural desire really because of what our soul is see our our desire and when you're born in sin shaped naked economy world speaking lines all that we have is what's filthy of the world but then god has a a way of molding and shaping us from that point using our parents to mold in shape and bring us to that place that's why that's why so many times that's why that's why so many people are millionaires today offer writing millions of books on how to raise a child right and i'm sorry friend but ain't one of them right except this one right this is the only one that's right this is the only and best book on how to rear children yes all the others come from a seat of education and some man's thinking they're not all i'm right but they're all millionaires because they sold all kinds of books on how to raise children how to raise your child when priscilla and angel got all y'all set in here could stand up right now and tell you every one of you is different and ain't one book written except this one this holy bible that would actually orchestrate them and reason you properly none of them right ain't one because you're different than you and you and you and you joel emma me micah tabitha all different right you so people take a book and say oh i'm gonna raise my children buy this book and that those children might not even fit that book not even one iota and even if it did a little bit it's not probably not going to be for the next child the only one that works is this holy bible yes it's only when it works if you go outside the pages of this bible or you try to do anything different than what this bible says then you're going to have consequences right because you're continually fighting continually fighting against a child who has been born in sin right shaped in iniquity their nature is to lie to you yes and you're teaching them to be right you're trying to teach them what is the correct and right way the constant battle is going to be but my flesh wants to do this right my desire wants to do this the lost in my flesh is to be like this and the parents are like if you go that way you're going to be a horrible person and you're going to go to hell that's why we're trying to teach you so that you know and by god's grace if they finally do get to the asia they understand all that they're like i understand that right i get it it makes sense sometimes it comes a little earlier to some sometimes a little later but most of the time if it's done right they'll eventually get it and they'll eventually understand now parents aren't always perfect either so there's some things that probably never get understood because it probably wasn't correctly done to begin with but we do the best we can with i mean how many times with me and my wife like honey we did the best we could with what god gave us at the time and the information we had and everything we did the best we could in prayer and uh and then we just had you had to leave the rest of the lord yes amen i do want to read one more scripture though my times got away but galatians chapter 5. galatians chapter 5 i want to begin reading with verse 16. amen unfortunately it seems like a lot of times and and and i'll just say in the christian world a lot of people like to use the grace of god as a crutch for their lustful desires their lust lustly fleshly desires and how they want to live and be and do and act they use the grace of god as a crutch that helps them justify that galatians chapter 5 verse 16 this i say then listen very closely listen very closely this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen amen best advice now i mean i want to read some more here but that scripture basically sums it up what did he say what did paul tell the galatians walk in the spirit not walking in the lust see that's our title today walking in lust walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh if you get a revelation of that especially young people it will help you out in your life as much as anything amen the flesh listen very closely the flesh lusteth against the spirit that's right s that's capital s spirit of god not your own human spirit right the flesh lust against the spirit of god and the spirit of god against the flesh right amen and these are contrary to one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that you would but if you would be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness there's that word again idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies endings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have told you in the time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god shall not inherit the kingdom of god amen brother but the fruit of the spirit is love not human love people out here think they love they don't they might have a little filio for someone who's washed their back or something but they don't have love the only way you can have love this love is to be born again only way you can have this love is to be born again right because this love is god's love the only way you get it is from him when his indwelling presence comes in you through the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith how many of these attributes you see most people living today i hurt somebody yeah pretty hard to find right meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the afflict with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another or envying one another amen we walk in the spirit not in the flesh walk by the word not by our own lust we walk by the dictates of god's word not by what somebody told us in some school or seminary or government amen walk according to god's word and let god be our let god be our portion this is satan's evening all of civilization excuse me friend but all of civilization has fallen under this lust science education nothing wrong with having an education we need it to survive and live in this world medicine uh hospitals doctors most of them do good work great people give of themselves yes some of them make you know they make a decent living too but they give of themselves that's wonderful police are military wonderful people love them they do some of the most difficult jobs that exist on this planet policing other humans lostful desires right policing others lustful desires is not a desirable job but they do it and most of them don't get paid a lot of money either right this is not a huge compensation but all that's of the devil education schools now you go to school i'm not saying don't go to school don't learn schools education doctor's medicine hospitals police military it's all the devil amen all the devil this whole civilization has fallen into that lust because this is satan's evil right we are the minority this bride is the minority this bride is the is the small little flock that jesus said for us not to fear right little flock for it's god's good pleasure to give us the kingdom right amen the kingdom that we talked about all this time down from eve cain uh uh israel under balaam saul uh samson down to judas judas iscariot fell under this lust and became servants to it and live that life amen but god has called this bride this last day to live a higher life amen he's called us to live a higher plane he's called us to live the word that god has put in his word gentleness meekness temperance patience what is that those are foreign words today is that english you're talking yes patience temperance loving one another joy peace having temperance patience endeavoring to have unity that's that's a tough one today but it's still god's word amen amen all those things lust against your flesh spirit lust against the flesh amen but let's walk in the spirit so we don't fulfill those lusts amen praise the lord let's stand if we could praise the lord god help us to be more like him yes more like he calls us and his word to be hema that's one reason we read the bible we read the bible because that's what tells us what's pleasing to the lord yes that's what tells us what what uh how he lived how he did it what did he do when he was approached with people like that he faced scoffers not like this last day jesus had plenty of scholars the pharisees and sadducees hated jesus absolutely despised jesus but that was because he would have he was living a plain a level of righteousness that they could not do so what they do they just put it down they dismiss it by putting you down putting it down they put him down if they put him down and talked about him like that what do you think they're going to do to you if you love him and want to live like him and believe pleasing to him what do you think they're going to do to you right [Music] [Applause] amen me more like [Music] just give me your heart that's filled with your love and make me more like yes make me more like thee jesus make [Music] and give me your heart that's filled [Music] yes make me more like this jesus make me [Music] and give me your heart that's filled with your love and make me more likely now won't you live the way jesus wants me to live i want to give [Music] until there's just no more to give i want to love [Music] love till there's just no more let's sing it this way now i'm going to live the way jesus wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more to give i'm going to love love till there's just no more love hallelujah is that your determination today yeah amen you know friend it sure seems to give us a lot of insight if we just look at the scripture and we can identify and see what's going on in the world today get an idea of it but it becomes so clear when you see it in the word and you think lord keep me from that lord i don't want to be that way amen and the problem so many people fall into is that they think in their righteous indignation that they're going to meet that challenge on the same level that those people brought you don't meet people's challenges in the same way that they brought it because that makes you just like them you meet the challenge by the way of the word and christ and the way that god brings and meets that challenge not the way they do don't stoop to their level but rise above that amen and meet the challenge based on christ and his word and his spirit in your life and that's the best way to think about it it's the best way to deal with it i like the rest of you get so frustrated i guess is the best word to say with some of the stuff that goes on in this country i love today it's just it's hard horrible and disheartening but i can't get myself like they are because that makes me just like them i'm just on this side i'm just on a different side i don't want to be on a different side i want to be on god's side yes i want to be on his side amen meet the challenge not on your side but on god's side amen amen because lord knows people out in the world today are drawing their sides they're creating their sides and i've told you before i believe that division is is going to get worse i really do i think it's going to get worse it's got to get to the place that the american people are willing to submit everything of their rights and everything to a one entity and that in the bible we know of is the beast that's it and it's getting there yes it's getting there very quickly amen it's become so divided it's become so divided it's in the position that it's ready to be united amen and it's going to take that one person he's going to come through and he's going to say how wonderful how beautiful and how great and just give me everything not just all your money they've already garnered all the money in the world but give me now all of your rights give me all of your freedom he's already been out speaking against america he spoke against our voting rights he spoke against our our form of government he spoke against our form of economy what's he doing he's come he's ready to take it over that's right amen that's where we're at that's where we're living amen but don't be on north side be on god's side don't take either side take god's side amen god will fight your battles yes praise the lord amen god bless you pray something was said to bless help
