[29:37] okay but it's all right we already have
[29:40] our book built praise the Lord anyway
[29:43] amen but I'm thankful to be here and the
[29:46] songs we were singing was all about
[29:48] having faith and believing that God is
[29:49] more than able we talked about Jehovah
[29:52] Rafa and sha and he's all of these
[29:55] things but see that has to become a
[29:57] reality it amen can't be more than just
[30:00] a song yes it's just a song do you know
[30:03] good right but if you have the real the
[30:06] revelation of who he is and really what
[30:08] he is and what he plans to do for us
[30:11] amen that's what makes it difference yes
[30:14] while you're standing if youd open your
[30:15] Bibles to Hebrews the 11th chapter we'll
[30:17] read verse 11 verse 6 and the subject
[30:22] matter is it's it's faith and trust yes
[30:25] and they kind of go hand in hand one
[30:28] develops into the other one yes very
[30:31] true Hebrews 11 and6 without faith it is
[30:34] impossible to please him for he that
[30:36] cometh to God must believe that he is
[30:38] yes and that he is a reward of them that
[30:40] diligently seek Him amen and let's just
[30:44] pray Heavenly Father we have gathered
[30:47] together this morning to Worship You To
[30:50] Praise You Lord you're worthy of all
[30:51] praise because of who you are and Lord
[30:54] as we gather together we realize what we
[30:57] are because of you yes Lord that's what
[31:00] gives us the faith to believe the things
[31:02] told us through your word thank you
[31:04] Jesus Lord take me as your vessel this
[31:06] morning I pray and move me aside and use
[31:08] me you've given me a thought Lord and
[31:11] just help me Lord to deliver that which
[31:13] you placed upon my heart I ask it in
[31:15] Jesus Christ's name amen be
[31:22] seated as I've gone through the
[31:24] scriptures i' I've noticed that God
[31:27] deals with different people people in
[31:28] different ways because people are
[31:30] obviously
[31:32] individuals and and the way that he
[31:34] deals with them he has to get them in a
[31:38] situation Lord he can actually speak to
[31:40] them and the first one that I chose to
[31:43] to look at is is Jacob and Jacob to me
[31:46] is rather interesting
[31:49] character he I mean to him God was the
[31:51] god of his father I'm sure his father
[31:54] had told him all about the Miracles and
[31:56] the promises of God and and he could
[31:58] watch how God had provided for his
[32:00] father and all these other wonderful
[32:02] things yes but yet to Jacob God was the
[32:05] god of his
[32:06] father he had heard about him but he
[32:08] didn't know
[32:10] him and then we go down and we we we
[32:12] realize what Jacob had done to his
[32:14] brother Esau he had stolen the
[32:16] birthright and he had he had stolen from
[32:18] him all the other things which should
[32:19] have fallen to Esau and Esau set out he
[32:23] was going to kill Jacob right just out
[32:26] of anger and stuff and and then his
[32:28] mother came to to to to Jacob and says
[32:31] he you know your your your your brother
[32:33] is not very pleased with you and then
[32:36] you need to kind of separate yourself a
[32:38] little while until it cools down so she
[32:41] said why don't you go and visit with
[32:43] with her with her with her her dad up in
[32:47] Heron and he took the advice went to his
[32:50] dad dad gave the permission so he began
[32:52] his journey out of
[32:53] Palestine and there he it got to be
[32:56] evening time so he laid down to get some
[32:58] sleep and all of a sudden the Bible says
[33:01] says all of a sudden God appeared to
[33:04] Jacob as he laid there it says and
[33:07] behold the Lord stood above it and and
[33:09] God spoke to Jacob and said I am the
[33:11] Lord God of Abraham my father and the
[33:14] god of Isaac and the land wherein thou
[33:16] liest I will give to thee and to thy
[33:18] seed thy seed shall be as the dust of
[33:21] the earth and thou shalt spread abroad
[33:22] to the west to the East and North and
[33:24] the South behold I am with thee and I
[33:27] will keep thee and all all these places
[33:28] whether thou goest and I will bring thee
[33:30] again into this land for I will not
[33:32] leave thee until I have done that which
[33:34] I have spoken to thee of so God here
[33:37] appeared unto Jacob and he made a
[33:38] promise to him yes he says and and and
[33:41] this is in spite of Jacob God made the
[33:44] promise sovereignly to Jacob yes it
[33:47] wasn't Jacob had to do anything this was
[33:49] a sovereign promise from God to Jacob
[33:51] yes right and anyway so Jacob went on
[33:54] and he began to he went up to to Heron
[33:58] he he married um one one of his anyway
[34:02] he married one of the ladies that wasn't
[34:04] the one he wanted so he had to wait
[34:05] seven more days or years or whatever it
[34:07] was finally he get the other one and
[34:09] then he started having kids and I
[34:11] noticed between his two wives there was
[34:13] always arguments between the two who's
[34:15] going
[34:16] to have have relations with him that
[34:18] evening and stuff and so there's always
[34:20] this conflict within this house always
[34:22] his conflict yeah and then Jacob he
[34:24] would take care of his his
[34:26] father-in-law's shape and goats and
[34:28] cattle and whatever else and Jacob or
[34:31] Jacob's father-in-law began to change
[34:34] the stipulations you know you stay with
[34:36] me so long and we'll do this and we'll
[34:38] do that and we'll do this and we'll do
[34:39] that and finally Jacob realized after a
[34:42] while that his father-in-law really
[34:44] wasn't too pleased with him and that's
[34:46] when God spoke un Jacob and says it's
[34:49] time for you to head back home right so
[34:52] Jacob he began he he separated his
[34:55] flocks and his herds from his
[34:56] father-in-law's
[34:58] and then he began his
[35:00] journey his father-in-law decided to
[35:03] follow after him and began you know he
[35:05] was going to chastise him and who knows
[35:07] what and God spoke into under his
[35:09] father-in-law and says you be careful
[35:11] how you speak to Jacob you don't be good
[35:14] or bad to him you just behave yourself
[35:16] so to speak yeah but Jacob heard that
[35:19] Esau was coming with a band not just
[35:22] Jacob by himself to G him and say hey
[35:24] welcome your home right no no he was
[35:27] Jacob wasn't sure exactly what his
[35:29] brother had in mind with him and so he
[35:31] separated his F herds in the sheap from
[35:33] different he put them in different um
[35:37] anyway he separated him so they
[35:38] journeyed separately then he separated
[35:40] his kids and his wives and he sent them
[35:42] ahead hoping that all of this stuff that
[35:44] he had sent ahead of him you know with
[35:46] AAS with a peas
[35:47] Esau but it came to the place where
[35:50] Jacob began to realize that he was going
[35:52] to face his brother and he was afraid
[35:55] for his life yeah
[35:57] and and and Jacob God Jacob vow Jacob
[36:01] vowed vow saying God if you and Jacob
[36:03] when he when when Jacob F first met God
[36:06] he says Jacob out about and saying if
[36:09] God will be with me and will keep me in
[36:10] the way that I go and will give me bread
[36:12] to eat and remant to put on so that I
[36:15] come again to my father's house in peace
[36:17] then shall the Lord be my God yeah in
[36:20] other words God you have to make you
[36:22] made a promise to me and if you keep it
[36:26] okay then I'll let you be my God uhhuh
[36:28] but it wasn't until Jacob all of a
[36:30] sudden God sent down to the place where
[36:32] he was Afra for his life yeah amen and
[36:34] then Jacob called unto the God and says
[36:36] in Genesis 32 Jacob said oh go oh god of
[36:40] My Father Abraham and God of my father
[36:42] Isaac he was still God of his his
[36:44] parents he said the Lord which sayith
[36:47] unto me return to the country to thy
[36:48] Kindred he said I am not he goes on AR
[36:51] worthy for the least of all your mercies
[36:53] and all the truth that thou has showed
[36:55] unto thy servant he said deliver me I
[36:58] pray thee for the hand of my brother and
[37:00] the Hand of
[37:01] Esau because you said you and he and
[37:04] Jacob reminded God of his promise he
[37:07] said thou sayest I will surely do thee
[37:10] good and make thy seed as the sand of
[37:11] the sea right amen so then Jacob went be
[37:15] Jacob went and he be he tried to rest
[37:17] that evening because he knew that the
[37:19] following day Esau was going to be
[37:21] there and so Jacob was rest was left
[37:24] alone and there wrestled of ad with him
[37:26] until the breaking of the the day when
[37:28] he saw that he prevailed not against him
[37:30] he touched the hollow of his thigh and
[37:32] the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of
[37:34] joint and he as he wrestled with him and
[37:37] God spoke and and and God said unto him
[37:39] what's your name he said well it's Jacob
[37:42] and Jacob means deceiver and he was yeah
[37:45] right he said thy name shall be called
[37:47] No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[37:49] hast thou power with God and with men
[37:52] has prevailed Jacob asked and said tell
[37:55] me I pray thee thy name he said
[37:56] wherefore is it that thou would asked my
[37:58] name and he blessed him there and Jacob
[38:01] called the name of the place P for I
[38:03] have seen God face to face my life was
[38:06] preserved you know as I looked at Jacob
[38:08] and I began to
[38:10] realize God had made a promise to
[38:13] Jacob you come to church begin you know
[38:16] even as a sinner you come to church and
[38:18] and you begin to hear about this God
[38:21] begin to hear this God oh yeah we know
[38:23] God heals oh we know God protects and we
[38:25] know God provides and God does all these
[38:27] things
[38:28] and a lot of people when they come to a
[38:29] relationship with God they says well you
[38:32] know Lord we read in your word all these
[38:33] wonderful promises yeah well Lord if you
[38:37] will do this for me then I will accept
[38:39] you then I will let you be my God then I
[38:42] will follow you then I will do this and
[38:44] a lots of times God does what you've
[38:46] asked but then you forget the promise
[38:49] you made to him but see it comes this is
[38:52] how a lot of people start out but see it
[38:54] wasn't it wasn't until Jacob wrestled
[38:57] with God it wasn't until Jacob got to
[39:00] the place in his life where he wasn't
[39:02] sure of what tomorrow would bring yeah
[39:05] that all of a sudden he God then became
[39:07] a reality to them right and until God
[39:10] becomes a reality to us it's just a
[39:13] bunch of words sure even if God fulfills
[39:16] him well it could have been this
[39:17] circumstance well it could have been
[39:18] that circumstance well you know I wanted
[39:20] this and all of a sudden yet came to
[39:21] pass well that was wonderful great but
[39:23] also I I work for this and I did this
[39:25] and I did this and I did this and so we
[39:27] try to relate it to what we have done
[39:29] rather than putting the praise back to
[39:31] God we alone amen that's right but when
[39:33] you get down to the place where you have
[39:35] no
[39:36] options and you began to wrestle with
[39:39] God In
[39:40] Prayer but all of a sudden it takes on a
[39:42] whole different perspective sure amen
[39:45] because then you begin to realize I
[39:47] could not do this it had to be God Amen
[39:50] and then that God all of a sudden
[39:52] becomes your God yes and there's only at
[39:55] that point in time really does you begin
[39:57] to have a relationship or you have you
[40:00] begin to walk with with with
[40:02] God but here again like like like I say
[40:05] it we have to reach a point in our lives
[40:08] where we have to know that God did what
[40:10] God said he would do yes and then we
[40:12] wrestle with him where we get to
[40:14] actually know him and the more he begins
[40:17] to reveal himself unto you then all of a
[40:19] sudden we have this walk where
[40:20] eventually leads into a trust amen
[40:24] another one that I looked at was
[40:26] Moses now Moses to me is a very
[40:28] interesting character I mean his his his
[40:31] mother had taken him he was born I think
[40:33] after 3 months he put him in an ark and
[40:35] sent him down the river and then uh one
[40:37] of Pharaoh's daughters took him out of
[40:39] the out of the water and Moses began to
[40:42] be raised in in Pharaoh's household yeah
[40:46] and and and pH and and Moses's mother
[40:48] actually got to nurse him and during and
[40:51] and nursing uh I mean nursing with them
[40:54] we're looking at a year or two okay it's
[40:56] not something that that like like
[40:59] happens here in the states or whatever
[41:01] but all of a sudden she would have been
[41:02] able to relate to him at that age you
[41:05] know you're born as a you you are a
[41:07] special child yeah we pray to God for a
[41:10] deliverer we pray for God to to to to to
[41:14] to save us from pharaoh and for all the
[41:16] things which were going around us and so
[41:18] it must have been instilled within the
[41:20] mind of Moses there's a purpose for my
[41:22] life yeah amen and so when he got into
[41:25] when he began to be studying for the to
[41:26] be in Egyptian he could he was he was
[41:29] studying to become the next Pharaoh yeah
[41:31] I mean he was he became a man of Might
[41:33] he became a man of authority he became a
[41:35] man of power he would lead the armies
[41:37] and he would lead them and he would lead
[41:39] them into Victory yes it takes a strong
[41:42] man to be able to have the other people
[41:45] be willing to follow if you got a I I
[41:47] mean I was in the Army and there are a
[41:50] lot of officers that I didn't have much
[41:52] respect for you did because of their
[41:54] rank but there's a few men that I began
[41:57] that even in the Army I realized he was
[42:01] not only doing with the will of the of
[42:03] the military but yet they had a
[42:05] character within himself which made it
[42:07] so he also valued your life yeah right
[42:10] he says we have to go into battle we're
[42:11] going to fight a tough battle but he
[42:13] says we will go and we'll be Victor and
[42:15] he would pump us up yes but he he was a
[42:18] man I would be willing to follow sure
[42:20] because of the strength of character
[42:22] that he had well see Moses had to have
[42:25] this type of a character if he was going
[42:26] to an army it couldn't be somebody who
[42:29] would stutter and who who didn't have
[42:30] any confidence in himself and so one of
[42:33] these days he he went out to visit the
[42:35] children of of Israel and he wanted to
[42:38] tell them look at he say I've been
[42:39] raised up to be your deliverer yeah I
[42:42] have come and God has go God has shown
[42:44] me through my mother I am to be the
[42:46] deliverer and so but you have to trust
[42:48] in me yeah and they looked at looked at
[42:50] Moses well why should we trust in you
[42:52] yeah you know and so he killed one
[42:54] Egyptian and then when when that got to
[42:56] be knows right he he High tailed it out
[42:58] of town
[42:59] right but see God Moses was going to do
[43:02] it his way yeah you no God wants it done
[43:06] his way right yes and so he he went and
[43:09] and he started taking care of Jethro
[43:10] shape and the lady that he married
[43:12] brother B say she had a temper as bad as
[43:15] Moses did so it kind of Whitted him down
[43:17] a Nots right but finally he got to the
[43:20] place where he were where where God says
[43:22] okay Moses and this was took 40 years
[43:24] for God to prepare Moses and found 40
[43:28] years later all of it so he'd been 80
[43:29] years old I guess by that time and and
[43:32] so he all of a sudden got in a there was
[43:34] a bush that was burning this kind of
[43:36] attracted Moses's attention so he went
[43:39] over there and he began to look at it
[43:41] and God noticed and Moses had turned
[43:43] aside and uh then God began to speak to
[43:46] Moses yeah and says take off your shoes
[43:49] from off your feet you're Unholy ground
[43:51] amen Moses now met
[43:54] God and God began to relate un him yeah
[43:57] you are the deliverer I chose you from
[43:59] the beginning I chose you from your
[44:00] birth you are going to deliver the
[44:02] children of Israel amen and by this
[44:04] point in Moses's life he said well I I
[44:06] ain't going back uhuh I can't even talk
[44:08] straight he said I just I come out here
[44:10] with the goats just to have some peace
[44:11] and quiet because home is you know has
[44:13] his own issues but but we have to begin
[44:16] to understand it took the it took the
[44:18] experience of actually Moses meeting
[44:21] God before it changed Moses right God
[44:25] had to get Moses to the place where
[44:27] Moses no longer was a strong individual
[44:29] he was no longer a man who believed in
[44:31] himself he was a man who no longer could
[44:33] lead an army yeah U but now all of a
[44:36] sudden God says fine now you're in the
[44:37] position I want you because now Moses
[44:40] you have to rely upon me in order for me
[44:43] to be able to accomplish what I want
[44:45] through you amen and often this is the
[44:47] way we have to come this is the place we
[44:49] have to come in our own lives we have to
[44:51] begin to realize it all depends on God
[44:55] it's not about us and this this is one
[44:57] of the things that I've been impressed
[44:58] with in the my in the last few months it
[45:00] doesn't have anything to do with me
[45:02] right it all has to do with him amen as
[45:05] we stand as Ministers of the Gospel that
[45:07] is and me trying to put together my
[45:09] notes and coming up some inspiring
[45:11] message no it has to come to the place
[45:13] where I can become a a vessel I can
[45:15] become a channel through which God can
[45:16] flow to speak to the ones that he once
[45:18] spoken to amen because everybody else
[45:21] has needs everybody else has their own
[45:22] problems everybody everybody else
[45:24] approaches God often times in different
[45:26] ways through different Avenues yes true
[45:29] so we have to be able as as a minister
[45:32] of the Gospel we have to be we have to
[45:34] come to the place where we merely become
[45:36] the channel through which God can flow
[45:38] this is something brother brandom
[45:39] himself had to learn amen he had to
[45:41] learn to begin to realize that God the
[45:43] gift that God had given to brother
[45:44] brandham was not for brother brandham to
[45:46] use but it was a gift that God had
[45:47] placed in the prophet for God to use
[45:50] right and and here again we come down to
[45:52] the same thing in all of our Lives amen
[45:55] we're all individuals we're all people
[45:57] God has a God has a calling on all of
[45:59] our Lives it's not just to May me not
[46:01] just to minister not to stand before the
[46:03] people and preach but go but you each of
[46:06] you have a Ministry each of you have God
[46:08] living inside of you and what God is
[46:09] wanting to do he's wanting to use you he
[46:12] wants you he wants through you to go out
[46:14] and reach out unto other people amen you
[46:16] are the only God the people are going to
[46:18] see right the way you live the way you
[46:21] present your the way you live the way
[46:23] the way you act that that is how other
[46:26] people will perceive God yes and if you
[46:28] just act like everybody else well okay
[46:30] then there's no difference sure but it's
[46:33] like within the message we're supposed
[46:35] to God's car God is supposed to be
[46:38] living in us and so his character is
[46:40] supposed to manifest itself through US
[46:43] yes so there has to be some way where
[46:45] they distinguish us from the rest of
[46:47] Christianity amen and this and I I know
[46:50] when we lived in
[46:51] Israel people wondered why are we there
[46:55] well when we were in Israel the the the
[46:58] Jewish people when they saw what the
[46:59] denominational systems had had uh I mean
[47:02] there was mixed bathing and there you
[47:04] couldn't tell the Heaven from anybody
[47:06] else and the the different
[47:08] denominational systems would sit there
[47:10] and they would fight literally fist
[47:11] fight who is going to have access to the
[47:13] holy place first and uh so some of them
[47:16] would come out off bloody and and the
[47:18] Jewish people looked at this and they
[47:20] laughed and they believed in three Gods
[47:22] we only believe in one so we were
[47:25] different we in a lot of ways we were
[47:27] different and so the people began to
[47:29] look at us the lives that we lived and
[47:31] the way that we conducted ourselves am
[47:33] yes because we went there to represent
[47:35] Jesus Christ yes we weren't there
[47:37] representing a denominational system we
[47:39] weren't there representing any other
[47:41] group we were representing God himself
[47:43] yes and they could look at us and they
[47:45] realize there was something different
[47:46] about us and so because of the way that
[47:49] we lived all of a sudden people began to
[47:51] see aight of God that the denominational
[47:53] systems could not show amen yeah yes
[47:58] so we go on and and here again when we
[48:00] look when we look at Moses it goes on
[48:03] and it says not in the absolute brother
[48:05] BR says notice Moses had the fire the
[48:08] fire was in Moses because whatever Moses
[48:11] said it wasn't Moses it was God speaking
[48:13] amen and he performed a sign because the
[48:15] pillar of fire left the bush and come on
[48:18] Moses amen yes and see this is where it
[48:21] has to come now on us yes when we we say
[48:24] we've received the Holy Spirit what you
[48:27] received it's not the third person of a
[48:29] trinity no you have received the essence
[48:32] of everything God is amen that which
[48:35] lives inside of you is God every bit God
[48:38] right but you have to be learn how to
[48:40] listen to him you have to learn how to
[48:42] yield to him and until you begin to
[48:44] learn how to yield to him then you're
[48:46] we're no better than the Baptist we're
[48:48] no better than any other denominational
[48:50] system right but when all of a sudden we
[48:52] can take our lives and we can give it
[48:54] over to God when we meet God like Jacob
[48:57] had to meet God Jacob had to wrestle
[48:59] with God only after he wrestled with God
[49:02] that all of a sudden God become his God
[49:04] it no longer was the god of his fathers
[49:06] now all of a sudden he claimed that he
[49:08] claimed God as his God yes well with
[49:10] Moses he had he knew who he was his
[49:12] mother had told him who he was and so
[49:15] all of a sudden uh and when the fire
[49:17] came out of the Bush and entered into
[49:19] Moses that changed Moses so when he went
[49:21] into into Egypt what he had you know
[49:24] what did he have he had a stick in his
[49:25] hand Moses where are you going I'm going
[49:28] down to take over Egypt yeah uh where's
[49:31] your army I have it right
[49:34] here okay
[49:36] amen God had told him he says you got
[49:38] that stick there's a lot of power in
[49:40] that stick yes well I don't have a stick
[49:43] but the power of God's in here right but
[49:46] I have to learn to yield this to him
[49:49] amen so that he can do what he wants
[49:51] through me yes true looking under Jesus
[49:53] brother B makes this statement and
[49:56] that's what we ought to do today no man
[49:58] has got a right to preach until he is
[50:00] filled with the Holy Ghost right
[50:01] theologians and mathematicians so forth
[50:04] can't explain all that away from you but
[50:06] if a man has but if a man has ever been
[50:09] in the backside of the desert in that
[50:11] sacred spot and meet God like Moses did
[50:15] uh did there's no man could take that
[50:17] away from him he knows he was once there
[50:20] and this is where we all have to come
[50:22] also here in in our lives we have to
[50:25] meet him amen he cannot be a god out
[50:28] there anymore right he has to be the god
[50:30] in here he cannot be a God in the bush
[50:32] he cannot be a God in brother Bram he
[50:34] cannot be a God and the pastor no it has
[50:35] to come down to the god actually is in
[50:37] me right and we have to have this all of
[50:40] us have to have this true it's not just
[50:42] the ministry it's every single member of
[50:44] the congregation amen God has to be a
[50:47] reality to you true because only until
[50:50] he becomes a reality to you can he
[50:52] change you and can he live live his life
[50:54] and manifest himself through you amen
[50:56] amen I go on and another one the last
[50:59] one of the people I would I wanted was
[51:02] was Sol of Tarsus and a lot of way I can
[51:05] relate to
[51:06] Saul I was raised in a Baptist Church y
[51:09] they taught me all the Sunday school
[51:11] literature sure you know the time that
[51:13] Jesus lived oh it was nice time of peace
[51:16] and joy and and everything was green and
[51:18] everything was nice and everybody loved
[51:20] everybody else and everything was just
[51:22] all peachy and cream yeah well as I
[51:24] began to study I begin to realize the
[51:26] story taught me wasn't exactly true yeah
[51:29] because there was a time of drastic
[51:31] turmoil there were inra was under the
[51:34] the occupation of the Roman army and and
[51:37] there was crucifixions and there was all
[51:39] kinds of abuse the priesthood was um
[51:41] they were there but they weren't they
[51:44] were not following the word of God I
[51:46] mean how could they crucify him right
[51:49] yeah they gave Judas the money Judas
[51:51] gave it back to them oh we can't take
[51:53] this money now because it's the money of
[51:54] blood we can't put in the treasury no
[51:56] now we have to something I mean the
[51:57] hypocrisy exist is enormous amen well we
[52:01] look at at at denominational
[52:04] system the word says women shouldn't
[52:06] preach well God didn't mean what he
[52:09] said oh yeah he didn't well what else do
[52:14] you have in the Bible that you don't
[52:16] believe that he meant what he said right
[52:18] exact I mean it mix bathing well you
[52:21] know there has to be separation there
[52:22] has to be Holiness there has to be
[52:23] Purity oh God didn't mean that that was
[52:25] just for another the day excuse me how
[52:28] much of the Bible are you going to take
[52:30] away just start tearing out the pages
[52:31] right just leave the few paragraphs that
[52:33] you actually agree with Y but see God
[52:35] sent us a prophet to get us back to the
[52:37] word we we have to realize God sent the
[52:40] prophet to take and prepare a bride for
[52:42] a Rapture yes in order for the bride to
[52:45] be prepared for a Rapture that bride has
[52:48] to begin to live this word amen we have
[52:51] to take what God Said in that word we
[52:53] have to and not not only apply it to us
[52:55] but we have to have the God of this word
[52:58] living such in Us in which he is
[53:00] changing our very nature from the inside
[53:02] out until so we literally become the
[53:04] manifestation the expression of God Amen
[53:07] right so Saul when he when so Saul was
[53:10] on the road to Damascus he was
[53:11] persecuting the church he was going to
[53:14] take and bind them all up and haul them
[53:15] back to Jerusalem you know so they could
[53:17] be tried there and all of a sudden this
[53:20] light showed around about
[53:22] Saul Saul realized that was the same
[53:25] light that was in the burning bush yeah
[53:27] right right and all of a sudden a voice
[53:29] spoke out of that and says Saul why are
[53:31] you persecuting
[53:32] me and Saul was doing the best he could
[53:35] to serve the God that he believed in
[53:37] right but the God that he believed in
[53:39] was a God that he had heard about yes it
[53:42] wasn't a God that he knew but on the
[53:45] road to Damascus that changed yes all of
[53:49] a sudden he said Saul Saul why are you
[53:50] persecuting me how could I be
[53:53] persecuting you I'm trying I'm trying to
[53:55] eradicate this is this heresy that has
[53:57] invaded our our religion right he said
[54:01] who are you he says I'm
[54:03] Jesus he was persecuting the church yeah
[54:07] what is the church church is his body
[54:11] amen if people persecute us they're not
[54:13] persecuting us amen they're persecuting
[54:16] the body of Jesus Christ yes right so we
[54:19] have to understand that amen but see
[54:21] that experience with Saul changed him he
[54:25] went to Damascus got his eyesight got
[54:27] filled with the Holy Ghost and then he
[54:29] went out of town and he went a place
[54:31] where he could get the Scrolls and for
[54:33] three years I think it was he went there
[54:35] through the scroll and he had been
[54:37] taught them he he wasn't ignorant of
[54:39] these I mean he was a scholar but he
[54:41] went through and he went through and God
[54:43] began to take the Scrolls and began to
[54:45] open unto him the revelation of who he
[54:47] is God actually is right and from that
[54:51] point on we get in Philippians he says
[54:53] Paul says that I might be found in him
[54:55] not having my own righteousness which is
[54:57] of the law but that I might which is of
[55:00] the law but that which is through the
[55:02] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[55:04] is with God by faith and then he go that
[55:06] I might know him yes amen and know is
[55:09] not a is not a casual knowing right
[55:11] right it's knowing in the same way that
[55:12] a husband and wife knows each other it's
[55:14] an intimate personal relationship yes
[55:17] but see that's where we have to come in
[55:19] our walk it have we have to know him
[55:22] Amen in the same intimate personal
[55:24] relationship that a husband or wife wife
[55:26] knows each other where after a while my
[55:29] wife knows what I'm thinking most of the
[55:31] time I can start a sentence and she can
[55:32] finish it I haven't come to that place
[55:35] with her but she you know with with me
[55:36] anyway that that's the way but you know
[55:39] but here again but because of the
[55:41] relationship we know each other yes well
[55:44] this is how we have to come with God we
[55:47] have to know him amen we have to have an
[55:50] intimate personal relationship with
[55:52] Jesus Christ yes a casual knowing him we
[55:55] do just knowing the the stories of the
[55:57] Bible just knowing the life of the
[55:59] Prophet just knowing oh yeah God sent a
[56:00] prophet that won't cut it anymore no we
[56:03] have to come down to the same way that
[56:04] Paul was there has to be this intimate
[56:06] personal relationship right and only
[56:08] through that intimate personal
[56:09] relationship will there be the ability
[56:12] to to to develop Faith within God yes
[56:15] and this is what Jacob found when he
[56:17] finally wrestled With God all of a
[56:19] sudden God became a reality to him and
[56:21] then his walk with God began with Moses
[56:23] after after the burning bush all of a
[56:25] sudden now God became a reality to him
[56:27] and and that's was when the relationship
[56:29] began with Moses where Moses began to
[56:32] understand God we look at Saul and and
[56:34] saw after the after the Damascus Ro
[56:36] Damascus experience yes here again God
[56:39] became a reality to him amen he says now
[56:41] I really want to know him yes and so he
[56:44] would go through the scriptures and
[56:46] other places he said there's been a
[56:47] mystery that's been hidden from from the
[56:49] beginning of the scriptures all the way
[56:51] through when what is this great mystery
[56:52] it's Christ Living inside of amen amen
[56:55] praise the Lord having this intimate
[56:56] personal relationship where God so lives
[56:58] inside of you until it's no longer you
[57:01] living but now it's Christ Living and
[57:02] manifesting himself praise the Lord
[57:06] amen when I began to look at
[57:10] Faith I I I be I began to to to not
[57:15] question but I want to understand what
[57:17] exactly what you mean when we say have
[57:19] faith faith is believing for something
[57:21] is it learning or is it actually having
[57:23] faith in someone as I was going through
[57:26] in Ephesians 284 by grace are you Sav
[57:28] through faith and that not of yourself
[57:30] it's a gift from God Amen faith is a
[57:33] gift God gives you right it's not
[57:37] something that you just kind of think it
[57:39] up in your own mind no God gives you
[57:41] Faith yeah is a gift from God praise the
[57:44] Lord and the thing that we have to begin
[57:46] to understand what is this faith is
[57:48] supposed to produce brother Bram in
[57:51] Ministry
[57:52] explained he says at last just as long
[57:56] somebody asked how long does Divine
[57:58] Healing last brother ROM says it lasts
[58:00] just as long as Faith lasts amen
[58:03] salvation lasts the same way just as
[58:05] long as Faith last when you feel that
[58:07] you're not saved anymore then you're not
[58:09] saved for it's by faith that you're
[58:11] saved through Grace yes and so here but
[58:14] how how but here again to me it comes
[58:15] down to a relationship why do I believe
[58:18] that I'm that I that I'm saved because
[58:19] he says I am yes and I've met him that's
[58:23] right I've wrestled with him yes I've
[58:25] got to the place where I know God you
[58:27] said in your word that if I will accept
[58:29] you I will accept your sacrifice at the
[58:31] cross that you will you have saved my
[58:33] soul that point on there's no more
[58:35] question right true brother BR and his I
[58:40] be not afraid he says and I believe that
[58:42] healing is a finished work it's been
[58:44] completed for 2,000 years when Jesus
[58:47] when Jesus died at Calvary he saved you
[58:49] from sin and healed your sicknesses and
[58:52] every blessing and Redemptive blessing
[58:54] is yours by faith it's a work say it's
[58:57] yours amen if you can believe yes it
[59:01] praise the Lord that's the stickle amen
[59:03] do you believe it you actually believe
[59:06] that what God Said God will perform yes
[59:10] right Abraham got to the place where
[59:12] where Abraham yeah he they tried to
[59:14] produce a child and he got ishmail and
[59:16] that's problem we still have today
[59:18] because of ishmail right yes but then
[59:21] then when it got to the place in
[59:22] Abraham's life that he realized he could
[59:25] not produ child he realized that Sarah
[59:27] couldn't bear a child and and a
[59:30] paraphrase you know basically God says
[59:32] well now you know you can't now let me
[59:36] right well see often this is the way it
[59:38] comes with us in our relationship and
[59:40] Believing by faith when we reach the end
[59:43] of our line when we reach the place
[59:45] where we actually have no other hope no
[59:47] other options then God says okay now
[59:50] will you trust me right and generally
[59:52] when we make that transition in our
[59:54] faith when we begin to realize I cannot
[59:56] do this God now it has to be you doing
[59:58] this then all of a sudden then things
[1:00:00] change in our lives right
[1:00:05] amen and in my uh my new ministry
[1:00:08] brother vam says as far as God was
[1:00:10] concerned I was saved when Jesus died
[1:00:13] but it'll never do me no good until I
[1:00:16] receive it to me yes that he is the Son
[1:00:18] of God Amen and I've accepted him as my
[1:00:21] savior Divine Healing uh for you if God
[1:00:26] Divine Healing is for you if God will
[1:00:28] reveal that to you that it's for you
[1:00:31] amen but you just can't stumble at it
[1:00:33] it's got to come by a revelation and
[1:00:36] when it's revealed that by his stripes
[1:00:37] you are healed there's something Satan
[1:00:39] can never do as as as your younger
[1:00:42] brother from SS whatever that all the
[1:00:46] Devils couldn't move you sure he says
[1:00:48] when it's
[1:00:49] revealed and so it comes to the place we
[1:00:52] often I hear people say oh yeah I'm
[1:00:53] still believing for my salvation and
[1:00:55] that's good we have to do that but when
[1:00:58] it comes to the place in our lives where
[1:01:00] we are where it's a revelation to us yes
[1:01:03] no God you said I'm Healed and I believe
[1:01:05] it all of a sudden God begins to go
[1:01:08] beyond just a belief and all of a sudden
[1:01:10] to the place where God has revealed to
[1:01:12] me that I am healed amen then it changes
[1:01:16] things yes I mean it's like okay the
[1:01:19] example that brother BR that there was
[1:01:21] one lady he prayed for he told her who
[1:01:23] her name was where she had lived he said
[1:01:25] said that she had a stomach issue and
[1:01:27] and all these other things and so when
[1:01:30] she went home and she tried to eat all
[1:01:32] of a sudden her stomach still couldn't
[1:01:34] handle food and her dad her husband got
[1:01:37] on her case you're making a mockery of
[1:01:39] Christianity look at this you say you're
[1:01:41] here you can't eat any more than you
[1:01:43] could
[1:01:44] before and and even her pastor got on
[1:01:47] her case you're making a mockery of
[1:01:48] Christianity she says look at I stood
[1:01:50] before a man who did not know me he told
[1:01:54] me my name he told me where I live he
[1:01:56] told me what the issue was yes because
[1:01:59] he did that I believe right God has
[1:02:01] healed me I will confess that until my
[1:02:04] dying day praise the Lord but it comes
[1:02:06] to that it comes to the place where it's
[1:02:09] a revelation to you that God has done
[1:02:12] what God has said amen finally one day
[1:02:15] the the Holy Spirit went through the
[1:02:17] went through the neighborhood and all of
[1:02:19] a sudden that's when she got out and she
[1:02:21] she began to eat things that normally
[1:02:23] she couldn't
[1:02:24] eat that's when God honored her faith
[1:02:27] yes but if she listened to her husband
[1:02:29] and her pastor well you know well I
[1:02:31] guess maybe the prophet was wrong well
[1:02:33] maybe I guess he was just you know I I
[1:02:35] don't know I don't know what but anyway
[1:02:37] I guess I'm not I guess it was just
[1:02:39] encouraging words or something like that
[1:02:41] yeah God never would have healed her
[1:02:43] right it had to be a revelation amen it
[1:02:46] had to be the place where you actually
[1:02:48] know God has healed You by a revelation
[1:02:51] which God has placed within your heart
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:56] works with faith expressed brother bam
[1:02:57] says the same thing they do about Divine
[1:03:00] Healing they think well it's just a
[1:03:02] Hocus Pocus or something he says it
[1:03:04] isn't it's genuine unadultered faith in
[1:03:07] what God said to be the truth right and
[1:03:09] that anchors it amen now Faith is a
[1:03:11] revelation for God now Faith is a re
[1:03:14] there's where I want to stay there for a
[1:03:16] moment it's a revelation he has revealed
[1:03:18] to you by his grace it it's nothing you
[1:03:22] did you didn't work yourself up into
[1:03:24] faith you uh you you you ever have faith
[1:03:28] it's G if if you ever have faith it's
[1:03:31] given to you by the grace of God and God
[1:03:32] re reveals it to you therefore faith is
[1:03:34] a revelation amen it's not something you
[1:03:37] work up right it's not something you
[1:03:39] study and all of a sudden oh yeah hey
[1:03:41] that sounds good I think I'll believe it
[1:03:43] no no it has to come to the place where
[1:03:45] it's a revelation to you and sometimes
[1:03:47] we have to wrestle with God on that
[1:03:50] sometimes we have to really get down
[1:03:51] into prayer really begin to pray and
[1:03:53] really begin to seek the face of God and
[1:03:55] until so we enter into a presence where
[1:03:57] God is and then God has the ability to
[1:04:00] give us the Revelation to speak directly
[1:04:02] to us yes
[1:04:06] amen he goes on even in the Rapture he
[1:04:09] says but to the church the bride the
[1:04:11] Rapture is a revelation to her revealed
[1:04:13] to her that's the Revelation the true
[1:04:15] bride of Christ will be waiting for the
[1:04:17] revelation of the Rapture faith is
[1:04:19] something that has been revealed to you
[1:04:21] like it was to Abraham that could call
[1:04:23] anything contrary to what had been
[1:04:25] revealed him as though it wasn't so yes
[1:04:28] Abraham was looking for a city whose
[1:04:30] Builder make was God that's right he
[1:04:32] wandered all over Israel palesi looking
[1:04:34] for that City well I'm looking for that
[1:04:37] City also amen I'm looking for the
[1:04:39] changing of my body I'm looking for the
[1:04:40] Rapture and I it's brother bradam says
[1:04:43] it's the time of the Rapture is upon us
[1:04:45] amen the Rapture actually has already
[1:04:48] begun he says brother bradam says says
[1:04:50] you know um God will descend with a
[1:04:53] voice shout of the Archangel and Trump
[1:04:55] of God what was the voice he says it was
[1:04:58] this message this message was the voice
[1:04:59] to awaken the bride so the so the
[1:05:02] Rapture is a process we are in the
[1:05:04] middle of that Pro process right and
[1:05:07] even one of these days soon and I
[1:05:09] believe it's I'm hoping it's soon um all
[1:05:12] of a sudden I'll get the change in my
[1:05:13] body I will go from 80 down to 20 hey
[1:05:16] that's a pretty good change I think I
[1:05:19] and I will I will lose 100 pounds just
[1:05:22] like that that would be great too but
[1:05:24] but you have to begin understand it's a
[1:05:26] revelation to us yeah and the bride has
[1:05:29] to have this Revelation amen because
[1:05:32] it's the Revelation that God is going to
[1:05:34] come back that God is going to return
[1:05:36] and we are going to go enter into his
[1:05:38] presence and we're going to rule and
[1:05:39] reign with him for a thousand years it
[1:05:41] is this Revelation that keeps us pure
[1:05:43] praise the Lord why do we live for Jesus
[1:05:45] Christ why when when Jesus Christ rose
[1:05:48] from the dead and he came and appeared
[1:05:49] unto the disciples on the day of day of
[1:05:52] Pentecost and stuff before it he was
[1:05:55] resurrected and said why do you stand
[1:05:57] looking up in here he says the same one
[1:05:58] who's gone away he's going to come again
[1:06:00] and so he said wait until Jerusalem
[1:06:02] until you be endued with power from on
[1:06:04] high well this was great they were
[1:06:06] expecting him to come right
[1:06:08] back right that's what motivated them
[1:06:12] yes they didn't realize it was going to
[1:06:14] be 2,000 years before he came back amen
[1:06:17] God sent a prophet in this generation
[1:06:19] why to remind us no he is coming back
[1:06:22] yes this the message is the beginning to
[1:06:24] try to tell you to prepare yourself for
[1:06:26] that which is coming am because that's
[1:06:28] where we are at we have to be our our
[1:06:32] understanding of the message our
[1:06:34] understanding of God has to be more than
[1:06:35] just the Baptist Church there has to be
[1:06:38] more than just everybody getting
[1:06:39] together having a good time of fellow no
[1:06:41] there has to be a preparation in our
[1:06:43] heart for that which we know is coming

[1:07:41] has promised to me he's promised me a
[1:07:43] body change amen I am looking for that

[1:07:53] going to come to adoption where word is
[1:07:55] the same as the father speaking that is
[1:07:58] what is coming that there has to be a
[1:08:00] preparation in our lives to prepare
[1:08:02] ourselves for what he has said would be
[1:08:05] amen and if it's just a Sunday morning

[1:08:17] that will motivate you and it'll change
[1:08:19] your life into the very image of Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ amen that's why God sent the
[1:08:23] prophet to to prepare us for his coming
[1:08:27] to prepare us for a Rapture am amen
[1:08:30] Faith produces a trust how can you trust
[1:08:33] in somebody you don't
[1:08:35] know how can you trust in somebody to
[1:08:37] make a promise to you and uh well he
[1:08:39] made it last week and he hasn't
[1:08:41] fulfilled it this way you know maybe he
[1:08:43] never will and then the guy lies to you
[1:08:45] again lies to you again after a while
[1:08:47] you just figure we what he says doesn't
[1:08:49] mean nothing but see when God When We
[1:08:52] Begin we the only way that Moses could
[1:08:54] have a faith in God and trust God is
[1:08:57] because of the Miracles God did through
[1:08:58] him yes Jacob could only trust and faith
[1:09:01] in God because of of what he saw how God
[1:09:03] provided and protected him during his
[1:09:05] rest of his life this is what what what
[1:09:08] Saul began to realize that he can trust
[1:09:10] in God because God was living in him and
[1:09:13] God was manifesting himself through him
[1:09:15] and God was revealing himself to him but
[1:09:17] we have to have that same God being
[1:09:18] revealing him him revealing himself to
[1:09:21] us yes because only then will there come
[1:09:24] a change right yes amen like like in
[1:09:27] Romans it's in Romans 4 and and 21
[1:09:30] speaking about Abraham and being fully
[1:09:33] persuaded that what he had promised he
[1:09:35] was able to perform amen amen yes is
[1:09:38] that the relationship we have with God
[1:09:41] do I mean I look at myself how can I be
[1:09:43] en raptured how can I be the
[1:09:45] manifestation of the sons of God how can
[1:09:47] I speak as if God himself is speaking I
[1:09:49] I can't do that right not in my present
[1:09:52] State yes but I believe that what he has
[1:09:54] promised he has the ability to perform
[1:09:56] he has the ability to bring it to
[1:09:58] because he spoke it amen this is his
[1:10:00] word it's not our word why does he heal
[1:10:02] because he promised he would right yes
[1:10:05] well why doubt God cannot lie amen but
[1:10:08] you have to trust him you have to have
[1:10:10] faith in him you have to walk with
[1:10:13] him amen amen yes sir when when when we
[1:10:16] look here again look at Abraham you
[1:10:18] realize that the faith and the trust
[1:10:20] that Abraham had to take his son Isaac
[1:10:23] and to offer him that's right he
[1:10:25] realized that God he he had his life
[1:10:28] with God had come to the place where he
[1:10:29] had absolute total confidence and trust
[1:10:31] in
[1:10:32] God God says take your son Isaac
[1:10:35] sacrifice him
[1:10:37] right I'm sure he wrestled within
[1:10:39] himself but he was
[1:10:40] obedient finally he went up into the
[1:10:42] mountain he showed him and took the
[1:10:44] knife put the wood tied his son up put
[1:10:46] his son on the on the on the on on the
[1:10:48] wood and he he was going he was going to
[1:10:51] do it sure and God says stay your hand
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:56] he told his servants the son and I were
[1:10:58] going to go to the mountain and worship
[1:11:00] my son and I are going to come back
[1:11:02] right how God would perform that Abraham
[1:11:06] didn't know right God had not told him
[1:11:10] but in the last minute God provided the
[1:11:13] sacrifice to offer instead of his son
[1:11:16] amen God has a way of doing his things
[1:11:19] his way he doesn't consult me about
[1:11:22] these things amen he doesn't allow me to
[1:11:23] vote whether I want this or
[1:11:26] God is Sovereign he's going to do what
[1:11:27] he wants to but I have learned to trust
[1:11:30] in him I learned how to walk with him
[1:11:31] I've learned you don't I don't know what
[1:11:33] tomorrow will bring but I know you've
[1:11:34] already been there since you've already
[1:11:36] been there you know what I'm going to
[1:11:37] face so I'll just put my my hand in your
[1:11:39] hand will amen will follow praise the
[1:11:42] Lord see this is where we have to come
[1:11:43] in our relation we have to have absolute
[1:11:45] trust in the god that has called us yes
[1:11:49] amen I did a study on habac and and this
[1:11:53] my study of habac was about three four
[1:11:55] years ago and that changed my whole
[1:11:57] concept of what is
[1:11:59] faith faith is not believing for
[1:12:02] something faith is believing in someone
[1:12:06] amen yes if I God says he he he he can
[1:12:09] heal amen I have the faith to believe
[1:12:12] that what he has promised he is able to
[1:12:14] bring it to pass amen and in that I rest
[1:12:17] yes God said he would watch over me and
[1:12:19] protect me and provide for me he has the
[1:12:22] ability to bring it to pass right I
[1:12:24] don't
[1:12:25] yes I don't have the ability to protect
[1:12:28] myself I rely on him first thing we do
[1:12:31] when we sit into a car Lord I need your
[1:12:33] protection there's all these crazies out
[1:12:34] there driving around and I need you to
[1:12:36] watch over and also Lord because I'm uh
[1:12:39] I have my limitations and sometimes
[1:12:41] anyway um Lord you have to guide me and
[1:12:44] you know you take a steering wheel
[1:12:46] because sometimes I like to look at the
[1:12:47] scening that's not a good thing to do
[1:12:50] you're driving no but here again Lord
[1:12:53] I'm trusting in you to get from point A
[1:12:56] to point B amen and I really I trust in
[1:12:59] that I rely upon him yes sir and and he
[1:13:03] always takes care of that he he always
[1:13:06] he has always provided he has always
[1:13:07] watched over he has always guarded he is
[1:13:09] always protected Amen in Hab 2 and4 it
[1:13:12] says behold the soul which is which is
[1:13:14] lifted up is not upright or righteous
[1:13:17] before God but the just shall live by
[1:13:19] faith yes and and it says the soul which
[1:13:23] is lifted up it talks about a man of
[1:13:25] Pride yes yeah I'm too proud I don't
[1:13:27] need God's help I've done so well all by
[1:13:30] myself why do I need him right and so
[1:13:32] you know trusting in God for salvation
[1:13:34] you're not trusting God for healing
[1:13:35] you're not trusting God for your your
[1:13:37] livelihood you're not trusting for God
[1:13:39] for anything God say basic fine you
[1:13:40] think you can do it on your own good
[1:13:42] luck I will just leave you alone but you
[1:13:45] do what you want to
[1:13:47] do the thing we that I look at with in
[1:13:50] the world we're living in
[1:13:52] now we don't know what tomorrow is going
[1:13:54] to amen right we don't know what the new
[1:13:57] Administration is going to be able to
[1:13:59] accomplish we don't know what's going to
[1:14:01] happen in Israel we don't know what's
[1:14:02] going to happen in the Ukraine we don't
[1:14:04] know what's going to happen in Iran we
[1:14:05] don't know about the wars that are
[1:14:07] brewing in the minds of men we don't
[1:14:09] know about right the the large multitude
[1:14:13] of terrorists which have now infiltrated
[1:14:14] our countryes right I mean that's what I
[1:14:17] look at you see a different that that
[1:14:19] that's fine that's your prerogative I
[1:14:21] don't know about tomorrow right all I
[1:14:23] know is Lord I'm going to trust you yes
[1:14:26] for tomorrow yes I'm going to I'm going
[1:14:29] to come to a place in my life when I
[1:14:31] looked at habac and habac lived in a
[1:14:33] time of of great uncertainty yes the
[1:14:36] Assyrian Empire was on was was was was
[1:14:39] beginning its decline Egypt was was in
[1:14:41] was a vassel of of the Assyrian and so
[1:14:45] they went to help they went to help
[1:14:47] Assyria fight against Babylon and they
[1:14:51] lost and so and then and then anyway it
[1:14:55] it came to the place where this is the
[1:14:57] time that that that that habac lived he
[1:15:00] saw the the the hypocrisy of the priest
[1:15:02] who he saw there was no there was no
[1:15:04] justice there was no law there was no
[1:15:06] nothing right the the people that had
[1:15:09] the money they persecuted they wrote you
[1:15:11] know they they they they bled for lack
[1:15:14] of a better word the poor people I mean
[1:15:16] they took possession of their houses and
[1:15:17] their lands and all the other stuff
[1:15:18] until literally they owned everything
[1:15:20] and the poor people owned nothing and
[1:15:22] they just whatever the rich people would
[1:15:23] do out to them yeah right this is this
[1:15:26] was the this was the condition that
[1:15:28] habac Liv yes and God came to habac and
[1:15:32] says you have to trust me a proud person
[1:15:37] will not a proud person he really won't
[1:15:40] care he thinks he can do it on his own
[1:15:42] yeah well when the Babylonians finally
[1:15:44] invaded all of a sudden the rich people
[1:15:46] found out they had nothing right I think
[1:15:49] they marched a whole bunch of them just
[1:15:51] you know they they stripped them down to
[1:15:52] their birthday suit and they marched
[1:15:54] them all the way to where they were
[1:15:55] going literally they didn't have have a
[1:15:58] stitch of clothing they didn't own
[1:15:59] anything right right okay um this was
[1:16:03] the time when Babylon when
[1:16:05] Nebuchadnezzar came in that's when
[1:16:07] that's when Daniel was carried away into
[1:16:08] Babylon and all these other types of
[1:16:10] things but H but God had told habac he
[1:16:13] says because habac was afraid he was
[1:16:16] afraid he wasn't going to survive the in
[1:16:18] Invasion that was
[1:16:20] coming and he said well Lord how do I
[1:16:22] know I'm going to live and that's and
[1:16:25] God said you have to trust me amen right
[1:16:28] you have to have total confidence that I
[1:16:31] will do what I have said amen and the
[1:16:33] faith that from what I would be able to
[1:16:35] study and stuff the faith that God was
[1:16:37] requiring of habac was total Reliance
[1:16:40] between the creature and the Creator yes
[1:16:42] God provides for the birds God provides
[1:16:45] for the animals God provides for all of
[1:16:47] his creation amen he says trust me and I
[1:16:50] will provide for you also yes and when I
[1:16:53] studied habac I I began I asked God I
[1:16:55] says if I will do if I will trust you
[1:16:59] like you're asking
[1:17:01] habac will you take care of me the same
[1:17:04] way you promised to take care of habac
[1:17:07] and God spoke to me he said yeah and
[1:17:10] since then I minute rest amen I don't
[1:17:12] know what tomorrow will bring but I Know
[1:17:15] Who Holds Tomorrow yes praise the Lord
[1:17:17] do I believe he'll heal well sure yes
[1:17:19] how can I not believe amen and so when I
[1:17:22] have need of healing I say well Lord
[1:17:23] It's Your word it's your promise to me
[1:17:25] yes and so Lord now I'm expecting the
[1:17:27] manifestation of the healing amen well
[1:17:30] Lord you promised to provide for me
[1:17:33] well okay you said you would I'm
[1:17:35] expecting you to do that praise the Lord
[1:17:37] I know when we were in India there were
[1:17:39] times when really we were in a situation
[1:17:42] where uh well if it hadn't been for
[1:17:44] God's intervention we'd be shipped home
[1:17:46] in a
[1:17:48] bag and God
[1:17:50] intervened God watched over us God
[1:17:52] protected us yes and
[1:17:55] okay and and so I I have had to learn
[1:17:58] over the times of the our trips to India
[1:18:00] and trips to other places I I beg to
[1:18:02] understand what God was requiring and if
[1:18:05] I will take it I will put my total
[1:18:07] confidence and trust in him amen that he
[1:18:10] will fulfill what he said he would do
[1:18:12] for me amen and that's why I don't
[1:18:15] question healing right that's why I
[1:18:17] don't question my salvation amen that's
[1:18:19] why I don't question what's going to
[1:18:20] happen tomorrow because I'm trusting in
[1:18:22] somebody who's greater than than myself
[1:18:25] we have to realize we are the Bride of
[1:18:26] Jesus Christ we are part of something
[1:18:29] greater than ourselves we are part of an
[1:18:31] eternal Kingdom we are part of the of
[1:18:33] the of the body the the worldwide body
[1:18:36] of Jesus Christ we are a small segment
[1:18:38] of that body but still we are part of
[1:18:40] that body yes and he said he would watch
[1:18:42] over and he would protect that body he
[1:18:44] would he would provide for that body as
[1:18:46] a as a husband is supposed to provide
[1:18:48] for his wife and cherish and nourish her
[1:18:50] that's the way Jesus Christ does his
[1:18:52] church that's he does us yes but that
[1:18:54] has to be the reality right it just
[1:18:57] can't be words that oh that's nice no it
[1:19:01] has to come to the place where no God
[1:19:03] this is your word this is your promise
[1:19:04] to me amen and Lord now I'm relying upon
[1:19:07] you I'm relying Upon Your Grace I'm
[1:19:09] relying upon your mercy right I'm
[1:19:11] relying upon the word that you have
[1:19:13] given to me and Lord I'm trusting in
[1:19:16] that word because that word is you yes
[1:19:18] and if you made that promise in your
[1:19:19] word Lord that that means you made that
[1:19:21] promise to me because I am your child
[1:19:23] amen you are my father I am your child I
[1:19:27] I you you you you ordained me to be your
[1:19:29] wife you you chose you chose me as part
[1:19:32] of that of of the of the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:34] Christ amen and so Lord when I read
[1:19:36] about the Rel the when I read about the
[1:19:39] responsibility of the husband to the
[1:19:41] wife and realize that's your
[1:19:42] responsibility to me well Lord this is
[1:19:45] good amen you promise to nourish me and
[1:19:48] to cherish me and to take care of me and
[1:19:49] provide for me you promise to be my
[1:19:51] protector you Pro promise to be all of
[1:19:53] these wonderful things
[1:19:55] amen and that I I've learn I've come to
[1:19:57] the place where I rested this yes so
[1:20:00] it's no longer a struggle I mean I was
[1:20:03] concerned about the elections I I Adit

[1:20:06] Vietnam I I helped I saw people die for
[1:20:10] the for the freedoms that we have amen
[1:20:12] and I still believe that those freedoms
[1:20:14] have value yes abolutely amen because
[1:20:16] I've been in other countries and okay
[1:20:19] I've seen how I I've seen how other
[1:20:21] countries deal with their population
[1:20:23] yeah and the Lord I think in my opinion
[1:20:28] probably is wrong but he's given us a
[1:20:30] slight
[1:20:32] breather and that prob is wrong amen but
[1:20:36] all I know is that be as the bride he
[1:20:39] has predestinated us to be conformed to
[1:20:42] the image of his son yes he is watching
[1:20:44] over his bride to bring her to the place
[1:20:47] where we can be raptured where we can
[1:20:50] where we can all of a sudden become what
[1:20:51] he said that we are it's not telling
[1:20:54] trying to be become something that we're
[1:20:55] not it's not trying to become something
[1:20:58] which is unattainable right I mean I see
[1:21:00] these people that you know they can run
[1:21:01] a
[1:21:02] mile um yeah okay 10t 100 feet maybe huh
[1:21:10] that's my limit okay but these guys they
[1:21:12] can run miles that's not me but he's not
[1:21:15] asking me to run a mile amen he's asking
[1:21:17] me to trust in him and believe in him so
[1:21:20] that he can accomplish through me what
[1:21:22] his desire is for my life as part of the
[1:21:25] body of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:21:27] right God bless you amen praise the Lord
