people draws closer to you through it Lord and help us to realize in this late hour where we're living and who we are and you God we commit ourselves to you and ask your blessings on it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you have your Bibles now we're gonna turn over to Romans chapter 4 and begin our scripture reading there the last two Sundays as you know we spoke on justification and we got into some specific things about justification and some things that brother Branham talked about and as I mentioned to you a couple of weeks ago even even last week that we were going to try to get this subject to take us to our Easter Sunday so ender in our scripture reading for today so I mean let's go to this scripture Romans chapter 4 let's see we're gonna begin reading with verse 20 now amen says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness course you know talking about Abraham now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also amen so that includes us and includes me and you for it so it is for us too it's written for our second alone but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead the beautiful day that we celebrate every Sunday but especially on this Easter Sunday who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification Amen there's that word that justification that we'd been talking about and I want to of course spend the time a little bit on that last verse of 25th verse we go back into Abraham and talk about him for the but we all know the story of Abraham the faith that Abraham had and how it was imputed to him for righteousness through his faith and belief in God and that same imputation that God has to us that we can have that we could have that as the Lord has raised from the dead he was delivered now look at this the 25th verse I want to focus on now who was delivered for our offenses so what does that mean means that if he was delivered that means he was offered up he was given to now there's a specific person that that offered him up because Jesus himself said I have the power to lay my life down and I have the power to raise it up again he said if I called 12 legions of angels they would come and take me off of this cross they would deliver me from this persecution that he was going through but he was delivered delivered means that he was given over it means that it was somebody that brought unto something to somebody so he was delivered for our offenses amen remember I over in Isaiah 53 the Bible says in Isaiah 53 there priyad that it pleased God to bruise Jesus so what do you think this delivering came from God God's making a way so that we could be delivered of our offenses of our sins now that offenses same word that goes back to Matthew chapter 6 when it talks about forgive our trespasses forgive our sins forgive our debts forgive our offenses those are the same things the same words used Greek same derivative anyway the same root word of offense is sin it's unbelief so Jesus was delivered he was given up offered up for our sins for our fences for our trespasses and was raised again for our justification so as he was offered then he was raised praise the Lord we know he was raised on the third day as the Bible says is not the sufferers Holy One to see corruption so he had to raise before that corruption said it on a fourth day he's raised on the third day but he was raised for our justification so that raising of Jesus Christ coming up from the dead was to bring about in our lives a state of justification or a state of righteousness or a place of as we ought to be as we talked about with justification being justified as being righteous is putting that into our into our lives where it never happened in the first place if you're justified it never happened in the first place so if it never happened that puts you in a place of righteousness well that's not our righteousness that's his of course but that a place of righteousness is where we should be is that place God sauce again in his mind well Jesus was raised for our justification praise the Lord came back sent back the holy spirit he was raised for justice to send back the holy spirit so he could be born again fill with his spirit but it started again with him raising from the dead for our justification and justification he was delivered for our sins but then he was raised again to justify those sins to annihilate those sins I felt it be a little better today not to have the board you could remember the thing is there on the website if you want to print it out the little illustration that I gave but some people thought that my little 15-20 minute blurbs during the week it was a little better to have a little closer up so don't know why anybody won't see me closer up but that's okay so we just deal without the board today but you can think in your mind in the board you can think in your mind that picture that graph that we have of him raising again and justifying us so when Jesus raised from the dead it brought a justification to humanity and again remember that justification is only effective if someone accepts it that justification is only good if someone receives it if they believe it and they accept it for themselves that's why we have to come up their own free will that's why we have to come again Sol has to come of its own free will its own free decision God doesn't force anybody to serve Him God doesn't force anybody to love him he wants us to love him freely Amen just like I believe we too want in our lives people to love us of their own free will not to be forced into it don't want my children to be forced into loving me I want my grandchildren to be forced into loving me I want them to love me because they wanna love me because it's in their heart because it's their desire to want to love me that's what Jesus God wants to be loved of their own free will that's our own free will but justification brought Jesus raising brought justification to humanity so anyone that decides they want to receive it anybody that decides they want to take that justification for themselves can oh you see the many services today of course it's going on in the justification of the are the Easter services it's happening all over the world today through Christians and through this most holy time that we have here today but it has to come with the understanding that justification laid that foundation without Jesus raising from the dead that foundation could have never been laid so that foundation was laid he made a way for us to be able to enter into that now let's go over to first Corinthians I want to read here first Corinthians 15 beginning with verse 12 first Corinthians 15:12 I got the same audience I did last week my wife and my son I appreciate them both being here it makes a little bit better a little bit different but thankful that they're here to be here with us today now 1st Corinthians chapter 4 15 let's begin with verse 12 Paul speaking let's see if I get that right first yeah 1512 miss a little pulpit would be nice to have something a little bit higher here if you have anything let me know probably be here imagine we're going to probably do this more times at least the stay in order stay in place order is I guess till the end of the month but anyway now first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 12 now with Christ be priest list of this real close now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead now Paul was very familiar with this for the of this event because he was a Pharisee he talked about living to the very letter of being a Pharisee he was the Pharisee of Pharisees and the Pharisees believed in the resurrection the Sadducees however did not they would come and try to trick Jesus many times with questions about things in the resurrection and and also the Sadducees didn't believe so when Paul standing here talking about the resurrection he's talking about a tomb of the knowledge of things that he had known and studied for a long time but realizing he was speaking to people who may not believe that and his question is now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead so if they're gonna believe that Jesus rose from the dead I will say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead I can have no belief that there's not a resurrection of the Dead but believe that Jesus rose from the dead it just it just defies common sense of course but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain yay and we are found false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised it not up if so be that we that the dead rise not so now he's including everybody else now he's saying well if Jesus didn't race then what hope do the rest of us have if Jesus didn't raise from the dead then how are any of the rest of us expecting how are any of those that have that have fallen asleep they had fallen asleep in the Lord how are we how are they expected to raise the dead how are they expected to receive a life a new life at that point if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not Christ race so if Christ wasn't raised if the dead in Christ aren't going to race how is Christ raised the only reason the dead in Christ can't race is because Christ already risen he's risen to bring our justification so that the rest of us can be raised as well when Jesus came up he conquered death Ellen the grave and Paul's making this point and if Christ be not risen your faith is vain and ye are yet in your sins see here now now I know he was offered for our offenses but remember he was raised for our justification and Paul is saying now then they which are excuse me and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins so if we're still in our sins Jesus didn't raise we're still on our sins because Jesus raised to justified us Jesus raised to take away those tens Jesus raised to erase all of those things again and we accept it receive it he raised her to erase everything about that all of the things in the past all the passengers remember justification is is is a is an annihilation of past sin is it though you never did it it is a perpetual working in your life of all the things that you're going to do we don't know we repent and die daily but we don't know but that justification still stays there because Jesus still stays there if Jesus isn't still there on the mercy seat then what hope do any of us have but if he's still there and that perpetual grace the perpetual existence of the raising of Jesus Christ continues to annihilate the sin or the unbelief that may come in our lives the little things that we may do wrong that's why we ask forgiveness that's why we repent that's why Paul said again I die daily because the sacrifice is still there it is still proven that risen and that risen nature has brought us into the place of justification so we can be a righteous group he became us that we might become him he took our sin that we might take on his righteousness he did that by raising from the dead and if he didn't raise if there is no resurrection then we are still in our sins our sins are still on us we we are without hope but we do believe that Jesus raised him and we believe that Jesus raised to justify us Jesus raised to wipe our slate clean to annihilate all of those sins listen them if Christ be not raised your faith is vain and ye are yet in your sins God help us but we believe these risen amen then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished and all of those that will fall asleep in Christ will perish well hope is that what faith is there in the believing or thinking as a Christian that that's the end of it all there's no hope in that if Jesus didn't race and the rest of us won't race we can't but because he raised we raised with him amen if if in this life only we have hope in Christ listen this and and Lord will and I may have a little of sermonette if you will I'm not exactly sure what to call him yet next week during the week to bring to you on this - but listeners I'm trying not to get to that part because I want to stay on this subject and not keep it too long today but maybe you're celebrating a home hopefully your home maybe families come over I don't know that just it want to keep you too long to this beautiful Easter today but look now if in this life only we have hope in Christ and what is this life anyway what what is what is the meaning to this life this life is so temporal it's like a vapor I think James said it's you look at a boiling pot you see a vapor come up and it's there and it's gone but Paul says if we have hope in this only we have hope in Christ in this life only we are all men most miserable we're a miserable people if the only hope we have is the things that we see around in this world today or if we can't believe that Jesus if people can't believe that Jesus rose from the dead that he rose to bring justification in our lives that we - as we died in him our Rosina rising again in him then what hope - any of us have we have the hope of salvation we have the hope of justification because of what he's done we're still sinners we're still lost and dead in our sins if he did not raise but he raised so the dica justify us now look at an absolute let me read this in the absolute this is December 1963 Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ we find out I believe that we find out that he is our justification amen he is our justification God raised him up on the third day to justify our faith we are justified by faith remember the justification didn't come by works didn't come by the law came by faith we are justified by the faith alone so he came to justify our faith that we believe it and he raised him up to justify our faith what did he do then he sent him back the justifier because our faith believes it so we believe it I didn't see it none of us here in this room saw it I'm sure none of you helped air saw we didn't see it but we believe it we believe it happened because it's by faith that we believe it yes others did see it yes others did see Jesus after the resurrection before the Ascension yes there was people that spend time with him of course it's recorded in this Holy Bible that we read and we believe we have to believe it by faith you say well this one said and this one said it well we got to have faith to believe that what they're saying is true is still either way it's by faith so we believe that by faith and that way our faith is justified because our faith believes it see the Holy Spirit Christ come into it for our justification because we have raised from the dead from death unto life amen and we'll talk about that for a little bit but we got another scripture but let me finish this first so we raised because we have we have amen now since he's raised because he's raised he's justified us he raised to justify us because we've been justified now we were dead in our sins are now made alive because he annihilated the sin justified raised from death unto life now we are the sons and daughters of God sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Amen you know program said that's the place of adoption to the Christian the place that there ought to be conditioned that place of heavenly places is that place of righteousness where we set with Christ in those heavenly places and our adopted position in the placement that God put us in well first of course we're sons and daughters of God but we operate in those heavenly places on a perpetual basis because God has placed us in that situation he has put us in her ought to be conditioned sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus justified us by His resurrection amen justified us by his resurrection aren't you thankful the Holy Ghost will always point to the word if it points to a creed or denomination it is not the Holy Ghost he couldn't do that point away from his word when he died to confirm that word and make that word a positive he died so he could come ain't man himself into the word he is the quickening life that makes the word live again so when he died and rose again sent back the spirit that quickening power to live in us by the word in us to bring life that quickening life that makes the word live again that was his purpose of dying that he could still project himself through his bride and every and make every word though through every age at just exactly the way it's supposed to act he is the dynamics Amen Holy Spirit Christ is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics - the church is what apostles prophets teachers so forth he is the dynamics and that's the way it works and it's worked by a certain dynamic which is called like that he is the fire that fires off the gas he is the fire that's in the combustion chamber the gas the word is poured over the combustion chamber he is the one that sets her afire he is the one that confirms it he is the power he is the power of the Resurrection he is God he is the fire Amen without controversy said Timothy 3:16 great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh seen of angels received up into glory he was God come to take the sinners place yes sir God come to take the sinners place and when he God raised him up on the 3rd day was for our justification therefore exalted at the right hand of the Majesty on high he is the intercessor to make intercessions upon our weaknesses as we confess it to him and die out to ourselves placing his word back in us when when we die out to ourselves putting that word back in us the promise and our faith our faith makes that word live because Christ is in us the quicken ER to the word that makes the word live in us because we believe and the only way it can do that is because he raised two justify us and send his spirit back on us to quicken that word into our lives to quicken that word into our hearts now we are alive because he's alive and if we were to go by the way of the grace that quickening power still come back into that body one day and make it a perfect body a glorified body and raise it back up again I don't care if the elements of it are scattered out from here to China to Russia wherever it is God's gonna bring it all back together one day and bring that resurrection back to that place and friend I don't mind tell you I'm looking forward to that time amen you know the Bible says that's of course brother green taught us you know our loved ones will appear before us minimum of 30 days before we have the body change to go home and I'm looking forward to that resurrection to take us home looking forward to seeing my family again amen I'm starting to miss them more than ever now that my mom has passed I'm starting to miss my whole family more than more than I had before but I'm thankful God made away thankful that that Resurrection has taken place and God has made the way for each one of us to be raised in him now let's look at this raising in Romans chapter 6 will read first few first few verses here Romans Romans 6 chapter 1 now I want to get into another little part of this and recognize the the the resurrection and the resurrection on the Sunday not on a Saturday wasn't on the Sabbath it was on the Sunday first day of the week so we'll talk about that in just a minute I'm gonna get too much detail on it but just for a brief moment maybe we'll get to teaching of it a little bit another time Lord willing but Romans chapter 6 verse 1 says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin dead to sin any longer therein I remember there was a time when we were dead in our sins now after the conversion we are dead to sin they men there's a big difference in being dead in sin and being dead to sin that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death baptized into his death remember he was offered for our offenses he was given up at Calvary died the most cruel death a human ever died offered up so that so that and died so that we baptized in Jesus Christ were baptized into that death into that death therefore we are buried with him by baptism in death into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life praise the Lord you ever thought of that in the new we walk now we walk by our mortal flesh we walk in the newness of life where that newness come from it comes from justification they come from annihilating all of my past sins not the same person I used to be anymore I don't bear those burdens anymore I don't bear those sins anymore they're gone and done away with we were buried with him in the baptism boot print of Christ and raised from the dead by the glory of God even so also we walk in the newness of life and you think about that newness not just for a few moments I want to read a few a few more verses here I got down to the twelfth verse but let's talk about that newness for a minute and walking in the newness of life what is that newness mean the newness is is is a new beginning it's a it's a something that is brand-new you could say it's a starting over but new isn't really starting over you know you can you can buy something that someone previously owned and its new to you but it's not new so when he's talking about a newness of life he's not talking about something that belonged to somebody that you now possess he's talking about something that to you is new it's the newness of life so it's something that is in our mortal lives not spiritual in our mortal lives of course it is a spirit but I'm not talking about a spirit spiritually man I'm talking about a physically minute something that happens in our flesh that we walk see what the word says we walk in the newness of life and where do you walk you walk in your flesh you walk in your body in a newness in something that is brand-new now something that comes brand-new how many times has we could say a new beginning if you will a new beginning and people always talk about having a new beginning or starting over or starting fresh or starting new again well that new is something that's that that's that is new to you we walk in the newness of life wood if you look at the resurrection think again how Jesus was raised on Sunday Sunday's not the Sabbath Sundays not the seventh day Sunday is the first day but if you go over listen to and if you want we're all home maybe if you have time it's a long one but if you want to take the time and I'll encourage you to listen to future home future home the heavenly bridegroom earthly bride it's a little over four hours long I think but you go home and listen to it you see where brother branham invokes in Leviticus 23 I believe it he's talking about the laws in the days and that and the convocations and the gatherings and the the holy times and the feast times and and when he talks about getting into when it talks about Leviticus 23 many goes through that one through seven day period that brother branham tight to the church ages that one through seven days was the church age is rolling over one one to seven is one day they did this this I told you let's go get to teaching in it but you go back and read it first day second day things always something through to the seventh day but then in Leviticus 23 it goes over to an eighth day and it talks about having a holy convocation a holy gathering of people on an eighth day well what's an eighth day eighth day completely defies the pneumatics of the Bible the numerix of the Bible there is no eighth day God's not perfected in AIDS God's not completed AIDS he's perfected in threes he's completed sevens so that seven brought a completion when when that seventh brought a completion where does the eighth they come in well the eighth day or the first day or that son day amen we could say he's the Esso end day not just s you end day that son day was the beginning it was the newness it was the rolling over from time into eternity that a day of holy convocation is taking us from the seven church ages the 1st to the 7th there with those holy times in those feasts and and all over into a new day into a newness of life into a brand-new time and part of me if you will from the seven church ages rolling over at the end the bride age of course into the millennium there's a resurrection to take place to bring us all after the tribulation then the wedding supper of the Lamb into a millennium a day of of entering into perfect rest a day of entering into a newness not not the same old world not the same whole cosmos not the same old Church ages and living under those auspices but we're talking about living in a newness now that's just a type of it a type of this living newness of life is what we look forward to this is this is just a shell of what's to come this is just the beginning we're in the position now of receiving and living a newness of life which is just a shadow a shadow of a semblance of what's going to be when we get over there which is the notice the new beginning the the rolling over eternity rolling over again no more this cosmos no more this world we're talking about living to Jesus Christ and and and Christ the word being new creatures not just a newness of life here in this body but I'm talking about any brand-new body ain't no sickness no death no no what worried about loved ones going on or having aches or pains and and certainly not worried about any kind of coronavirus but a newness amen a newness of life look at this let's read the fourth verse again therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life amen Jesus was raised on a Sunday for a reason Saints he was raised on the first day for a reason he was raised to bring about an understanding that that eighth day is a new beginning it's a newness of life he began a new beginning and friend when this church a just roll over and time ends and gets into the Millennium of millenniums a thousand years a time period but that's the new beginning for us it's a it's a newness of life this is this is a shadow of it that we're living in now but that resurrection help us understand there's more to come this earth we read before visions one it is just the beginning that's just the downpayment it's just the earnest and we're standing here now and a newness of life in representation of what's going to take place of what's about to happen in our lives praise the Lord now I'm looking forward to that amen you know Bev and said a millennium all wrongs would be made there's a lot of not not a lot to talks about in the scripture about the Millennium brother branham doesn't talk with a whole lot about it but going to read look at the list of future home this week if you can it's just it's just tremendous and he talks about that rolling over and us going to our homes amen this is a shadow of but this is a shadow of it that we live we live in a newness of life because my old my old life is dead my old life is buried my old sins are done away remember that the quote we read last week buried done away with divorce out of memory even in God's even in God's mind even in God's memory let's move on that fifth verse for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection he Menten he's perfect what are we amen if we're in the likeness of his resurrection what does that make us oh my knowing that this knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin that's us how could a dead man sin if you dead to your sins how can you sin now what a brother man said the only one that can sin is a believer amen but they're dead to their sins how could a dead person sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead diet no more death has no more dominion over him who me you yeah oh Jesus Christ did it yeah but why was he raised why did he conquer death he'll only great why did he go through this so that we could - he made us more than conquerors born that he died he died unto sin once but in but in that he liveth he live to God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord let us not sin there let not sin therefore reign we're in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof remember still this body still the sticky nature that we still live with and still in this body we still live that but what are we we're now walking in the newness of life it's it's it's a starting over it's a new beginning place amen God has created for all of us we're sitting here listening to this and this creation that man has created and the things the abilities to be able to do this but don't get don't don't get comfortable staying home when we get back to normal once you're back in church again we still have to obey the word of gathering together so don't get too comfortable at home doing this now we may see where we go from here but don't get too comfortable with that let's read them let's read this quote here amen aren't you thankful of a new life the trial excuse me now the defense was the defense witness himself should know whether they are believers or not because he is the one that quickens the promise now how you going to get past that hot trial going on how you going to get past the Holy Spirit should know for he is the life that is in the word he's the one that quickens the word just like your spirit quickens your body and the body is quickened by the spirit you see we have on the board which we talked about see the the spirit quickens the body without the spirit the body is of no effect the body is dead and the word is dead without the spirit so the letter killeth right we know that Bible says the letter killeth the spirit giveth by it takes the spirit to bring forth the word to make it live he is the quicken er of that word which Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you what is that that's his word amen we spiritually partake of the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man we don't feed on the things of the world we don't feed of the even the Christian activities of things out of the world we're feeding off of something that's fresh we're feeding off something that is real we're feeding off of the current present-day truth amen and that present-day truth is the unfailing body word of the Son of Man that word that we eat on that we feed on it's not a dead of Karen is raised raised from the dead and brings life brings new life it's not dead it's a new life he is the quicken ER that makes a life of that word he is the defense witness and defendant amen how are you going to get past that in this court to understand it very well like that he is the quicken ER of the word makes that word live is that word that comes alive in us and when that word is alive in us then everything else is dead but we're alive in the word amen living he loved me what's that Tongo living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely he's coming again amen he's coming again he's coming to take us home to be with him st. John let's read this one more Scripture as I close here amen st. John chapter 5 amen st. John chapter 5 verses 20 we'll begin reading with verse 24 remember Jesus the Bible says Jesus appeared unto many the love the ones that Jesus brought with and they went into the city and appeared unto many doesn't say they appeared unto all who did they appear to I believe they appeared - just like they are going to appear in this day I believe they appear to those who believe those who are looking for those who want to save it if I'm looking for my son or my dad or mom whatever if I'm looking I believe that's gonna read I'm gonna receive that that's what I'm looking to I'm not just looking to the things of the world this is my home anyway but I'm looking to the things that are beyond here and the more and the closer it gets the more the greater the pull gets and that pole gets greater and the more I start yearning for that the more it becomes real to us and that's where we are today the reality of it he appeared unto many yes but not everybody and in and when they come they're not gonna appear to everybody it's not gonna be it's gonna be like a thief in the night he's not gonna appear to everybody it's not gonna be planes crashing and cars crashing and things like it's gonna be like a thief and then it's gonna happen in people to be or this person go are there's no telling you know it's just gonna be a disappearance to me maybe natural catastrophe or something we don't know but we do know that it's gonna be as a thief in the night and and the people the world I don't know anything about it those people are gonna be we're gonna be gone off the earth and they're not gonna know anything about it but those loved ones are gonna appear on too many to those who believe it's not gonna appear to the unbeliever it's gonna appear to those who justify those who believed those who received now st. John 5:24 this look I read this very rarely I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed passed from death unto life barely barely I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live amen because he raised they raised also because he raised will raise also amen because of that justification that brings us from a passing from death unto life life life eternal life immortal the life that God gives the life that brings everlasting joy in life to us to God's bride together with him Amen aren't you glad he raised I'm thankful God raised from the dead he's raising from the dead you know he couldn't raised if he hadn't been born he couldn't been and and lived and and gave his life and died and was scourged and lived in this life and gave his life and died and rose again but he rose again so that he could bring justification to our lives forgiveness of sin that forgiveness of sin puts us in that position with him in our ought to be conditioned justified is it though we'd never done it we did that by raising all those who would believe all those who would receive hopefully maybe if somebody's watching this and you haven't received it receive it now now it's the time to do it now it's the time of salvation receive it because he raised for that purpose he raised so that your sins can be done away with he raised so that she could be in the place of righteousness with him he raised to take our place so that we can take his now we said in heavenly places with him in newness of life amen and a newness of life praise the Lord not the same man I used to be not the same people we used to be but were one in him and a newness of life we walk different we act different we talk different because we are different it's a new it is a brand new I never was like this before but it's a new new in him Amen thank God for raising Jesus from the dead and bringing that salvation to us bringing that justification to us so that we can know what it is to have our sins annihilated by the blood of Jesus Christ amen aren't you thankful today praise the Lord I'm so glad that God gave us another beautiful Easter Sunday friend we don't know how many more of these really I would actually be surprised if we have another one amen as I am every time we have one won't be surprised if we have no but I'll be more surprised now if we do but we don't know we don't know how many times we're gonna be able to meet together we don't know what's gonna happen after this time everything is so up in the air and being clamped down and I told you the Lord warned me about things and what some of the things that I say on here so I'm very careful begin Lord will and we get back together there's some things I still want to still want to talk to you about so but god bless you I miss y'all today wish we were together on this Easter Sunday I wanted to have communion service maybe not on the Easter Sunday but maybe a week before a week after so Lord willing we get back together we can have communion some fellowship have a dinner and something that we can all be together just enjoy one another's fellowship again so but just be safe be healthy also did forget to mention a prayer request to you that's been real heavy on my heart for a couple of days some of you maybe not all of you know or remember a brother Dana thorn he'll he came to the tabernacle years ago he's a Border Patrol agent chaplain for the Border Patrol he came to the church one time and his Border Patrol vehicles and the kids all climbed it and he gave a little sermon about and showed a picture I think of like spaghetti and the relationship between a man and woman and things like that and he had been down in Sierra Vista of course Border Patrol and brother brother Robert Figueroa was his pastor and last time I was down there spoke brother Robert I got to see him and spend a little bit of time with him to talk to him but I have learned over the past couple of days that brother Dana has been arrested so I don't want to go into the details it sounds pretty serious but please pray for birthday and Tornillo I believe he was a man of God and just trust that all this is false somehow that all this will just wash out you know how the devil wants to trip any of us up and trick us up and and and even if some of the allegations are true whatever still the devil it's not my brother is still the devil but please pray for him I know he's going through a very hard time right now I believe it was Thursday he was arrested so down in serviced or Benson or with stone down there somewhere so please remember I'm con tried to contact brother Robert I haven't heard back but just remember him in prayer if you could Amen the Lord would just move up on him so but we love you all appreciate you thank you for joining in and being with us today and pray the Lord richly bless you on this beautiful Easter Sunday amen god bless you today
