[51:40] spiritual utterance that David gave is
[51:42] recorded many times several times uh in
[51:45] in almost to a te and in other ways uh
[51:49] all through the new script uh the New
[51:51] Testament
[51:53] amen testifying of Jesus Christ amen God
[51:58] the Father lord lord said unto my Lord
[52:01] Jesus amen sit thou on my right hand
[52:05] praise the Lord until what until all the
[52:07] all your enemies amen which is what the
[52:12] devil amen is your foot stol now if his
[52:16] enemy is a devil what's our enemy amen
[52:19] if the enemy is under his feet were they
[52:21] to us under our feet praise the Lord
[52:25] hence my servant today your enemy is
[52:28] under your feet praise God your enemy is
[52:32] under your feet I've had this uh written
[52:35] down somewhere I ran across it yesterday
[52:38] for a long time now amen and I looked at
[52:40] it and I thought Lord that that would
[52:42] just be that was really what burning in
[52:45] my heart amen the enemy is under my feet
[52:48] praise the Lord Acts chapter 2 amen
[52:51] let's read from here we're going to read
[52:52] a few of these amen look at this
[52:55] something help
[52:57] hopefully to build our faith amen
[52:59] hopefully to build our faith something
[53:01] that we can look to we know the word
[53:04] bring to our remembrance amen What the
[53:06] Lord Has Done For Us amen and doing amen
[53:10] not past tense but doing right now he's
[53:13] still a Healer Saints you believe that
[53:15] yes he's still deliverers amen he's
[53:17] still the same God Amen only thing has
[53:21] changed is us only thing has changed is
[53:24] time and people and all this other has
[53:26] changed amen you know I heard that uh
[53:30] that Arizona had voted to go back to
[53:34] until something else is done as far as
[53:36] what they call abortion I call it uh uh
[53:39] Fetti murder but they can call it
[53:41] abortion all they want that's just to
[53:43] lighten up the fact that they're
[53:44] murdering unborn children so vle murder
[53:46] is my uh the way I phrase it so they're
[53:49] going back to the 1800s and people are
[53:51] mad and saying that Arizona is taking us
[53:54] back to the Civil War times or whatever
[53:57] they said Civil War time I said well
[53:59] that's funny it was fine then what
[54:02] changed amen if it was right then it
[54:04] should be right now just because people
[54:07] have changed and time changed doesn't
[54:09] mean what's doing right has changed
[54:11] right amen if it was right then it's
[54:14] right
[54:15] now still the same praise the Lord if it
[54:18] was wrong then it's wrong now but they
[54:20] act like because time has gone on that
[54:23] it's okay now we have advancements we
[54:26] the advant the advant advancements of
[54:30] that specific subject have led us to
[54:33] understand that it's worse now than it
[54:35] was then because they know now that when
[54:38] when they say life begins we know when
[54:41] it begins but when they say it begins
[54:44] amen they hear the heartbeat and and the
[54:47] movements and feelings and those the
[54:49] thoughts and things that that a fetus
[54:52] has they know that more now than they
[54:55] did back then
[54:57] praise the Lord but if it was wrong then
[54:59] it's wrong now yes the only thing that's
[55:01] changed is people it's us ideas thoughts
[55:04] opinions well we progressed yeah we
[55:06] progressed where that's the sad part we
[55:10] progressed into denying God and
[55:12] rejecting anything that's right moral
[55:14] and ethical amen but now let's go to
[55:17] acts acts chap
[55:20] 2:33 I'm sure y'all know by now I am not
[55:22] a proponent of abortion or
[55:26] called Murder amen call it uh acts uh
[55:31] 233 let's let's start with 32 this Jesus
[55:35] ha God raised up whereof we all are
[55:38] witnesses therefore being by the right
[55:41] hand of God exalted by the right listen
[55:43] to this now because there are people
[55:45] that actually literally believe that
[55:47] Jesus is at God God is sitting there on
[55:50] a throne like we are here he's sitting
[55:52] there on a throne just like this and
[55:55] then Jesus is sitting right there by his
[55:57] right hand or in some places the Bible
[55:59] says on his left
[56:01] hand what that doesn't even make any
[56:04] Common Sense much l by revelation we
[56:07] understand what that right hand is and
[56:10] you don't have to necessarily have the
[56:12] revelation of what the right hand is
[56:14] because the Bible tells us what it is
[56:16] and it is right here therefore being by
[56:19] the right hand of God
[56:21] exalted amen it's a position of power
[56:24] it's a position of authority
[56:26] being at the right hand is a position of
[56:28] Power Authority that God gave to Jesus
[56:31] Christ amen amen to sit at his right
[56:34] hand or be it that place of authority
[56:38] amen we're going to read some more a
[56:39] little bit later amen just again stir up
[56:42] our remembrance having received uh right
[56:45] hand of God right hand of God
[56:47] exalted and he should be exalted in our
[56:50] lips every day amen amen and having
[56:53] received by the Father the promise of
[56:55] the Holy Ghost those he has shed forth
[56:58] this which you now see and hear for
[57:01] David is not listen now for David is not
[57:05] ascended into the
[57:07] heavens but he saith
[57:10] himself amen but we know how he sayth
[57:12] under the inspiration of course of the
[57:14] spirit of God the Lord said unto my Lord
[57:18] sit thou on my right hand amen even from
[57:22] someone who has has been explained here
[57:25] that
[57:26] has not ascended unto heaven but now has
[57:31] ascended to Heaven through the blood of
[57:33] Jesus Christ he had not as that time
[57:36] ascended because he had not you could
[57:38] not be under the blood of bulls goats
[57:41] and cows and heers and uh of of the
[57:44] blood of animals it had to be be the
[57:47] blood of Jesus Christ that was
[57:49] sufficient enough to bring all those
[57:52] that were uh uh that were Gods back then
[57:56] to be raised up and to be able to ascend
[57:58] with him amen so him even David saying
[58:02] the Lord said to my Lord sit down on my
[58:05] right hand until praise God I make thy
[58:09] foes thy foot stol and that's what we
[58:12] looking for amen amen all the enemy we
[58:16] we use it plal of course but that's just
[58:19] the spread of the devil the one enemy we
[58:22] have is the devil amen thy foes become
[58:27] thy foot stol praise the Lord your foes
[58:30] the thing that you that you worry about
[58:33] the most in life the things that come
[58:35] against you the most in life the things
[58:37] that give you the most trouble in your
[58:39] spirit in your body in your mind those
[58:42] things have become your foot stol they
[58:45] are under your feet understand Saints
[58:49] amen there's a song that um um some very
[58:52] dear friends of mine back in North
[58:54] Carolina used to sing in the in the
[58:56] title is under his feet I thought about
[58:57] singing it but I just didn't remember at
[58:59] all but a lot of the chorus goes when
[59:02] the waves are over your head remember
[59:04] they're under his feet praise the Lord
[59:07] kind of reminds me of the song that
[59:08] sister green used to sing it said from
[59:10] Heaven's point of view that big mountain
[59:12] you're looking at is not even a hill to
[59:14] him amen when you look at it from a
[59:17] different perspective when you look at
[59:19] it from a different point of view you
[59:21] can see that it's not what the devil
[59:24] makes it out to be am
[59:26] but he tries to Li likes to try to scare
[59:29] you amen make you fear fear takes away
[59:33] your faith amen fear and worry takes
[59:37] away your faith right Faith brings us to
[59:40] the understanding that all these things
[59:43] have nothing to do with me they're under
[59:46] my feet my enemies are my foot stol
[59:50] praise the Lord look now uh let me
[59:53] finish reading this uh until I make th
[59:56] foes thy foot stol therefore all the
[59:59] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[1:00:03] ha made that same Jesus whom he
[1:00:05] crucified both Lord and Christ Lord and
[1:00:10] Christ he is the ruler and he is the
[1:00:14] anointed one he is the anointed ruler
[1:00:18] praise the lord well who anointed him
[1:00:20] God did amen who made him in charge God
[1:00:24] did Hallelujah he become Lord amen and
[1:00:27] now he is our Lord if we believe he is
[1:00:30] our Lord he now has become both Lord and
[1:00:34] Christ let's go to
[1:00:37] Matthew Matthew chapter
[1:00:43] 17 let's read a few verses Matthew
[1:00:46] 17 some of you may already recognize no
[1:00:50] going amen Matthew 171
[1:00:57] praise the Lord and after six days Jesus
[1:01:00] taketh Peter James and John's brother
[1:01:02] bringeth them up to a high mountain
[1:01:04] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:01:07] and his face did shine as the sun his
[1:01:09] rment was white as the light and behold
[1:01:12] there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[1:01:15] take talking with
[1:01:17] him then answered Peter and said unto
[1:01:21] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[1:01:24] he recognized with something special
[1:01:26] going on Amen it is good for us to be
[1:01:28] here if thou wi let us make here three
[1:01:32] Tabernacles one for thee one and one for
[1:01:35] Moses and one for Elias but while he yet
[1:01:38] spake Behold a bright cloud cloud
[1:01:42] overshadowed them amen not the bright
[1:01:45] Sun now but a bright Cloud remember that
[1:01:49] same Cloud that followed the children of
[1:01:51] Israel amen same Cloud I believe that
[1:01:55] struck uh uh uh Saul down off his horse
[1:01:58] and they spoke to him I am Jesus whom
[1:02:01] now persecutest that cloud overshadow
[1:02:04] them and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:02:06] a voice out of the cloud which said this
[1:02:09] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:02:13] pleased hear ye
[1:02:16] him Jesus received in his Corporal body
[1:02:20] received his placement into this body
[1:02:24] amen into the body amen the body that we
[1:02:27] now know as the body of Christ it is the
[1:02:31] mystical body of Jesus Christ of whom we
[1:02:34] are parts of Praise the Lord that make
[1:02:37] that we make up God himself saying this
[1:02:41] is my son what is happening Saints it's
[1:02:45] like a man who has a company and his son
[1:02:48] has showed himself worthy and his son
[1:02:50] comes up and he comes before the entire
[1:02:52] company and he said my son has proved
[1:02:55] him himself worthy my son has proved
[1:02:58] himself to know everything about there
[1:03:00] is to know in here and he showed that he
[1:03:02] knows exactly what to do and how to run
[1:03:05] this company I now therefore transfer my
[1:03:08] authority and power of this company to
[1:03:11] my son now you listen to
[1:03:15] him praise the Lord amen not that the
[1:03:19] not not that the that the dad's voice
[1:03:22] doesn't have weight obviously but the
[1:03:25] transfer of that authority to sit on the
[1:03:28] right hand of authority that transfer of
[1:03:31] authority happened as God gave it and
[1:03:33] said now you listen to him hear ye him
[1:03:38] he is now Lord yes praise God he is now
[1:03:43] ruler he is now the one in charge you
[1:03:47] hear him listen to what he tells you
[1:03:51] praise God now he is Lord what is he had
[1:03:55] done made all the enemies amen all of
[1:03:58] our enemies are foot stol all of our
[1:04:02] enemies are foot stol when the Devil
[1:04:04] comes at you don't don't plead with him
[1:04:06] don't beg with him don't don't you can
[1:04:10] acknowledge Him if you want just enough
[1:04:11] to say get out of here but that's it
[1:04:15] don't even acknowledge his existence
[1:04:17] Satan has nothing to do with the child
[1:04:19] of God those Devils have nothing to do
[1:04:22] with me they have nothing to do with you
[1:04:24] amen now the Lord may allow certain
[1:04:28] things to happen for certain reasons a
[1:04:30] lot of times we may not understand that
[1:04:32] but God is always there to bless us and
[1:04:34] help and bring us through he is Lord we
[1:04:37] listen to him we obey his word amen I
[1:04:41] don't obey the word of William brandom I
[1:04:44] don't obey the word of any great man I
[1:04:46] love their words I love of course from
[1:04:48] the word of God they're preaching and
[1:04:50] all but I I I listen to God Almighty I
[1:04:55] try to obey Jesus Christ what Jesus
[1:04:57] tells me to do is what I have tried all
[1:05:00] my life that since I surrender to him
[1:05:03] that I could do I try to do amen I many
[1:05:06] times failed miserably I'm sure we all
[1:05:09] have to a point but we try to do the
[1:05:11] best we can to the detriment of even our
[1:05:14] own thoughts even our own ideas even
[1:05:17] even the things we want to do yes amen
[1:05:20] the places we want to live amen the the
[1:05:24] the the places we want want to go we
[1:05:26] don't know why God does certain things
[1:05:28] certain ways but we just try to follow
[1:05:30] him where he leads us CU he's what he's
[1:05:33] the Lord amen he is our Lord all the
[1:05:37] enemy is under our feet because of him
[1:05:40] because he has made us more than
[1:05:42] conquerors he has conquered made us more
[1:05:46] than conquerors praise the lord it's
[1:05:48] like that story that I can't remember
[1:05:50] maybe brother green told I heard it
[1:05:52] years and years ago of the great Boxer
[1:05:54] that was trained
[1:05:56] uh to box and he was strong and he was
[1:05:58] fit and he worked out got up at 4:00
[1:06:01] every morning and drunk 12 raw eggs
[1:06:04] every morning and uh uh did things that
[1:06:07] were uncomfortable to him and ate things
[1:06:10] he didn't like and uh did things that he
[1:06:13] didn't maybe necessarily want to do but
[1:06:15] he had to get strong he had to get fit
[1:06:18] he had to get uh ready for the battle
[1:06:20] because the guy on the other side of the
[1:06:22] ring is is probably trading as hard as
[1:06:24] he is guys he's training hard and he
[1:06:27] gets himself into Peak condition he gets
[1:06:30] faster he gets stronger he gets more uh
[1:06:33] able to take care of his opponent and
[1:06:35] when they come together in the ring he
[1:06:37] knocks the man
[1:06:38] out he stands there Victorious he
[1:06:42] conquered he destroyed the enemy he laid
[1:06:45] the enemy
[1:06:47] outsight and so he walks out of that
[1:06:49] ring and the promoter hands him a check
[1:06:51] 10
[1:06:52] million he goes home he's all happy he's
[1:06:55] Joy he's thankful all the sacrifice all
[1:06:58] that he did gave himself bloody beaten
[1:07:01] bruised swollen he goes up to his wife
[1:07:04] and his wife puts his hand her hand up
[1:07:07] there's the
[1:07:09] million amen she didn't train she didn't
[1:07:13] fight she didn't get bloody beaten of
[1:07:15] course now a good wife would have been
[1:07:17] there with him all the step all wait but
[1:07:19] she didn't do she didn't she didn't have
[1:07:21] to go in the ring and even get bloody
[1:07:23] beaten and
[1:07:24] swollen but but she was a beneficiary of
[1:07:27] what her husband had done praise the
[1:07:30] lord we are beneficiaries we didn't have
[1:07:33] to go to Calvary right we didn't have to
[1:07:35] hang in shame we didn't have to get beat
[1:07:37] bloodied and and drained of our blood to
[1:07:40] the backbone showed through we didn't
[1:07:43] have to go in shame and hang there in
[1:07:45] the most horrible death that human has
[1:07:47] has ever uh uh suffered before but we
[1:07:51] now enjoy the benefits amen we enjoy the
[1:07:55] benefit of all of what Jesus Christ did
[1:07:57] for us he gave to us amen part of that
[1:08:02] is understanding that all the enemy that
[1:08:04] comes against you Saints has is no match
[1:08:09] for you you understand that all the
[1:08:12] Satan can bring before you is no match
[1:08:16] to you zero they're under your feet amen
[1:08:21] there there are no match Jesus now God
[1:08:24] putting in Jesus hands look let's go
[1:08:28] back over Matthew
[1:08:30] 17 uh the end of the fifth
[1:08:34] verse this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:08:38] am well pleased hear ye him and he
[1:08:42] hadn't even gone to Calvary yet but he
[1:08:45] saw the submissiveness the willingness
[1:08:48] CU everything that he learned he learned
[1:08:50] through obedience all all the obedience
[1:08:53] he learned he learned through suffering
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:55] praise the Lord and when the disciples
[1:08:58] heard it they fell on their face and
[1:09:01] were sore afraid and Jesus came and tou
[1:09:03] him and said arise Be not Afraid and
[1:09:06] when they lifted up their eyes they saw
[1:09:08] no man save Jesus only and as they came
[1:09:12] down from the mountain Jesus charged
[1:09:15] them saying tell the vision to no man
[1:09:19] until the son of man be risen again from
[1:09:22] the dead there testifying to them Jesus
[1:09:26] he there would raise again from the dead
[1:09:29] solidifying our Easter sermon and even
[1:09:32] our last week what we talked about they
[1:09:35] knew Jesus had already told them they
[1:09:38] man may try to put me in the grave and
[1:09:40] no doubt I'm sure Satan celebrated when
[1:09:43] he thought he had him amen never
[1:09:46] realizing that he was conquered death
[1:09:49] hell and the grave praise the
[1:09:53] Lord let's go over to Matthew chapter

[1:10:48] authority and power that he has he's
[1:10:51] given instruction to his disciples to go
[1:10:54] ye with which I am one of I wasn't
[1:10:57] standing here in a Corporal body at this
[1:10:59] time but I am here as one of his
[1:11:01] disciples now telling me to go ye
[1:11:04] therefore and teach All Nations
[1:11:08] baptizing them in the name of the father

[1:11:49] and the Holy Ghost that they are to be
[1:11:52] taught to understand now do you think
[1:11:54] Peter understood did those that that
[1:11:58] instruction sure he did because when
[1:12:00] they come out on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:02] Peter said be baptized in the name of
[1:12:04] Jesus Christ amen he understood the
[1:12:08] instruction wasn't to say and of the

[1:12:15] only one the Lord Jesus Christ God
[1:12:17] almighty teaching them praise the Lord
[1:12:20] that's exactly what Peter did on the day
[1:12:23] of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came

[1:12:28] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:12:31] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:12:33] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:37] praise the Lord and that promises to us
[1:12:39] and to them whoever many is God will
[1:12:42] sin it's not my decision to determine
[1:12:45] who will and who won't that's God's
[1:12:48] determination he's the one who says is
[1:12:51] and is it not me praise the Lord now
[1:12:53] let's go over to First Corinthians
[1:12:56] First Corinthians chapter
[1:13:02] 15 prise The
[1:13:06] Lord thank you Jesus In Christ Alone
[1:13:10] amen Christ Al will our
[1:13:13] glory
[1:13:15] amen First Corinthians chapter
[1:13:18] 15 let's begin with verse
[1:13:21] 20 1 Corinthians 15:20
[1:13:28] but now is Christ risen from the dead
[1:13:31] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:13:34] slept for Since By Man Came Death by man
[1:13:38] came also the resurrection of the
[1:13:42] Dead for as in Adam all died even so in
[1:13:47] Christ shall all be made
[1:13:50] alive but every man in his own order
[1:13:54] Christ the first fruits afterward they
[1:13:56] that are Christ at his coming then
[1:13:59] cometh the end when he shall have
[1:14:01] delivered up the kingdom to God even the
[1:14:04] father when he shall have put uh put
[1:14:06] down all Rule and all authority and
[1:14:09] power praise the Lord for he must Reign
[1:14:14] till he had put all enemies under his
[1:14:17] feet another part now this isn't exactly
[1:14:20] the way David had said it like uh
[1:14:22] Matthew Mark Luke uh uh said but this is
[1:14:25] another variation of that exact same
[1:14:28] phrase that David Again David a man who
[1:14:32] hadn't even as they said as act said
[1:14:34] ascended into heaven
[1:14:37] proclaimed the Lord said unto my Lord
[1:14:40] set down my right hand until all the
[1:14:42] enemies become my foot
[1:14:44] stol praise the Lord here it is Saints
[1:14:48] for he must rain till he put all enemies
[1:14:52] under his feet praise God now look thing
[1:14:56] there's when when Jesus
[1:14:59] Christ
[1:15:00] died he rose again conquering death went
[1:15:06] death couldn't hold him he went to hell
[1:15:08] hell couldn't hold him the grave
[1:15:10] couldn't hold him the stone was rolled
[1:15:12] back he resurrected death hell and the
[1:15:14] grave were conquered and then when he
[1:15:17] did and then in the Conquering what did
[1:15:20] he
[1:15:21] tell the the spokesman of the group at
[1:15:24] the time Peter
[1:15:27] he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom of
[1:15:30] heaven and said Peter whatsoever you
[1:15:32] bound on Earth is bound on he in heaven
[1:15:35] whatsoever you loosed on Earth is loosed
[1:15:37] in heaven why that is the character of
[1:15:40] God with the power of God amen amen
[1:15:43] because remember uh the power of God
[1:15:46] without the character of God is satanic
[1:15:48] yes amen but the power of God with the
[1:15:51] character of God is godliness
[1:15:55] it's Holiness it's
[1:15:57] righteousness it's God moving through
[1:15:59] his people in the capacity that God
[1:16:02] would do if he were yet here in a
[1:16:04] Corporal body yes because he uses us to
[1:16:07] do it yes amen making all enemies
[1:16:11] putting all enemies under his feet now

[1:16:39] privileges we live so far below our
[1:16:42] privileges where we should live where we

[1:18:02] that Satan had death was from the Garden
[1:18:06] of Eden when he caused the Fall In the
[1:18:08] Garden of Eden death became the greatest
[1:18:11] tool that the devil
[1:18:13] had death because even he knew if all
[1:18:18] these people were even to serve God he
[1:18:21] still had them in the clutches of death

[1:26:50] walk it's the life we live amen it's
[1:26:53] happen all of us it'll continue till we
[1:26:56] continue to press forward and and and

[1:27:03] preached a few weeks ago a couple months
[1:27:05] ago the enemy comes in like a flood amen
[1:27:08] God raises the standard against you

[1:27:22] like the wave is overcome you amen but
[1:27:26] he is under your Fe praise the Lord amen
[1:27:29] we need to pray um Shai text me earlier
[1:27:33] and had mentioned that they've had some
[1:27:35] struggle because uh of dealing with the
[1:27:38] situation that's going on at home and
[1:27:40] they've fallen behind on some bills so
[1:27:41] please pray the Lord Make A Way amen God
[1:27:45] manifest somehow to them the need that
[1:27:48] they have to to overcome this situation
[1:27:50] because now Art's out of work and she's
[1:27:52] had to miss some work so
[1:27:54] um it's struggling today like we said
[1:27:56] last week uh 75 80% of the country is
[1:28:00] living paycheck to paycheck for when a
[1:28:02] paychecks gone what do you do yeah amen
[1:28:05] things get left off and not paid and it
[1:28:09] makes life even that much more difficult
[1:28:12] amen but we're going to believe together
[1:28:14] amen God is in God is going to bless and
[1:28:17] help bring through amen again as I said
[1:28:22] had some pretty dark times
[1:28:24] I think we've all had some pretty dark
[1:28:26] times in our lives but we know the Lord
[1:28:28] has brought us out of every one of them
[1:28:31] and blessed
[1:28:33] us I I I am I am personally blessed
[1:28:38] beyond measure that I can't even begin
[1:28:39] to explain I just give him thanks for it
[1:28:43] amen just give him thanks praise the
[1:28:46] Lord let's stand if we could
[1:28:55] amen Satan is trying to do everything he
[1:28:59] can to disrupt the things that the Lord
[1:29:01] is
[1:29:02] doing and honestly a lot of people try
[1:29:07] to make a move towards God and their
[1:29:08] life gets rough and they they turn
[1:29:10] around and say wellow you know I I
[1:29:13] should have never done this to begin
[1:29:14] with you know that's the best sign in
[1:29:16] the world you've got that God is with
[1:29:19] you yes
[1:29:20] because like we said a few weeks ago the
[1:29:23] devil wouldn't work anybody who's
[1:29:24] already got amen why please allow us
[1:29:31] personality why would I if I had a
[1:29:36] player let's just say the best
[1:29:38] basketball player in the world on my
[1:29:39] team why would I go recruit that
[1:29:43] player it would be worthless for me to
[1:29:45] go spend my time trying to convince this
[1:29:49] person to come be on my team when
[1:29:51] they're already on my team yes that
[1:29:54] would make no sense it's fruitless to do
[1:29:58] why would Satan try to recruit someone
[1:30:02] that he's already got on his team why
[1:30:04] would he work at making things so hard
