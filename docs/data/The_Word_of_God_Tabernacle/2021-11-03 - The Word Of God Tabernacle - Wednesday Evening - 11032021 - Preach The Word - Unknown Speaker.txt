care lord surrounded by your holy angels we just give you praise and thanks for it lord and commit this remaining part of the service into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen second timothy chapter four read the first four four verses of scripture beginning with number one it says i charge you therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not end or endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they hit heap to themselves teachers having itching yearns they shall turn away their ears from fables and shall be turned from the truth and should be turned unto fables amen you can be seated if you like amen i want to take a little subject today tonight of the beginning of the second verse preach the word right i saw something that brother branham said the other day and it just struck me so true that i felt like maybe this was something of a subject that he wanted us to get into tonight and for a wednesday night for uh encouragement short service just uh whatever the lord would have done tonight but uh the thought came to me and uh a priest the word based on that uh quote now i i got the quote i'm going to read it a little bit later but i want to lay a little bit of a foundation of where i'm going tonight and what the whole point of this is uh you know we're all kings and priests we're all ministers we may not every one or be called to stand up here uh to be behind the pulpit to minister the gospel as i'm doing now or as other ministers that have crawled around the world do but we are all ministers as brother pat said god sent him to his family and told him i sent you here to be a witness well that's ministering that's preaching your life is ministering uh to the people around you his life their lives him as sister pat's lives ministering to their family and that's exactly what we do every day that's what god called us for so our lives are ministering but the point that i want to get to tonight is that god called us to preach the gospel amen that's what our commission is that's what god has has called for us and commissioned us to do god didn't call us to tell people what to do he called us to preach the gospel amen he didn't call it see it seems like that people are always wanting to tell somebody else what to do and see the difference there and there's a big difference friend there's a big difference in me telling you what to do then preaching the gospel and then when you preach the gospel and you just lay the gospel out you let the word speak for itself right and then it's not you telling them what to do it's not you coercing them it's not you trying to convince them it's the holy spirit the word going forth and letting god convict that person and god come down and speak to that person and that's when you get a real convert you don't just get a better night you get a christian you don't get a branamite so to speak you get a christian and that's what brother branham endeavored to do was to preach the gospel not to tell everybody what to do and of course people were all the time asking brother branham what to do what should i do about here what's to do about here and you know i'm brother branham gave advice many times or maybe the lord give him something specifically for that person and and and that's a different situation because that's coming from god that's a gift of god right that's not something that you say okay brother branham's telling me no god is just using that instrument to speak to that person amen brother branham just happened to be that instrument i've seen god use instruments that work brother brown to do the exact same thing and if god uses a different instrument it doesn't matter what instrument god uses it's god doing it right but we all it seems like that that we had this in ourselves and you know i think a lot of times that so misunderstood as being legalists right now i know there there are plenty of legalists in the world there's plenty of legalists in this in this message in this move and amongst the believers in this message there's there's legalism there's no doubt about that but you know not but we i hope this doesn't sound too carnal but we get a bum rap a lot of times for being called legalists because so many times people look at this as is is is a list of rules and do's and don'ts and he told me to do this and told me not to do this no that's not our job right our job is not to have a list of dues and don'ts outside the door when you come walking in this sanctuary that's not our job the job is not to uh have it pinned up or broadcast or or put on our website or anything no the job is to preach the gospel that is the commission of the believer is to preach the gospel it's not to tell people what to do is to let the word speak for itself amen when you have somebody see because there's a difference there's a difference in in just preaching the word or giving them the word or letting your life right like brother pat was saying letting your life preach all you're doing is living the word amen all you're doing is letting that person see the gospel in action you might not say a word right but your life is preaching but watch it preaching it better be preaching the word jesus and we and that's the whole gospel that we're preaching because it's christ living in us it's not even uh it's not even trying to say okay you better live like me or you're going to hell see and that's the that's the attitude a lot of people get right i'm not asking people to live like me i'm asking people by the gospel to live like christ which is exactly what i'm trying to do is exactly what we're all trying to do but not to make somebody do it or force them or conform them into this image let god do that we're just called to preach the gospel amen look if you get somebody to do what you tell them to do you've created a convert to you right not to jesus right if i convince somebody to do it the because i told him to do it they become a newton convert not a christian they're just doing it because i told them to right but if you just preach the gospel and you let the word do the speaking for you and then let the holy spirit come and back that word up in that person's life then you're out of the picture it's between them and christ and that's what you want amen that's that's what we want we want a person not convinced because if i could convince them to do what i tell them to do then the next person that comes along with a better argument than me and surely the goodness there's plenty of them because i'm not very bright but it's probably a lot of people that have a lot better argument to try to convince somebody to do something a certain way but when the holy spirit comes when you preach the word and you let the gospel speak and the holy spirit comes and backs that up then you've got to convert to christ not to you and there's not a devil out of hell no matter what argument they got that's going to talk them out of that right right amen nobody will be able to talk to that because it wasn't reasoned into them if they didn't fall in line to some legalism they didn't obey some rule you tapped up on the wall or or taken as you had it to the deacons coming through the door that's not what it's about it's about a life it's about lives lived to christ not to a church not to a message not to an ideology but to jesus christ and the word amen then you've got a convert you've got somebody that will stand by that word regardless of what else comes amen you're not talking them into it you're not telling them what to do you're letting the word speak for itself that's this is the quote that brother adam said that kind of stirred this in me he says now this is in questions and answers 1954. um it's question 48 it says on here it's different than the other one anyway the question was brother bill please tell me how to obtain the baptism of the holy ghost now that's for brother that's a sincere request a sincere question tell me how to get ghost now listen to the rest of the question but hold that in your mind tell me how to obtain the baptism of the holy ghost it is my prayer excuse me it is it is by prayer surrendered life accepting it as uh as we do healing i know what it is to have faith for healing when you prayed for me here do you pray and lay hands on for the baptism of the holy ghost i was baptized in the name of father son the holy ghost please tell me if i should be re-baptized in the name of jesus christ as you spoke recently now as i read this question and i can't even remember how i came across it but as i read this question you know what i was expecting the answer to be from brother brown probably the same thing you might be thinking right now i was shocked when i read his answer i was expecting him to say oh absolutely brother you better go now and get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ because you've been baptized in the father son of the holy ghost you're not even baptized yet or something along that order but look what brother graham said he said now my dear christian friend i'm not telling you what to do amen praise the lord i i tell you what it busts my bubble when i read that answer it it shattered everything that i had imagined in my mind that brother graham was going to say in response to that he said i'm not telling you what to do i am only laying the scripture down amen now see that's the whole and that's what precipitated the whole thought here i'm not telling you what to do i'm only laying down the scripture telling you what the word says amen you have to make your own decision right i'm not telling you what to do you have to do what you feel convicted what you feel is what the holy spirit is doing in your life that's what you need to do not what i tell you to do because if you do what i tell you to do you become a brand of might right you become a brand i'm converted not a christian you do what the holy spirit's telling you based on the preaching of the word then you've got then you become a christian now you've got something that'll hold you right amen i like that see that that just got this i'm only laying the scripture down and it just thought i just made me think how many times we we even in our spirit we get to the place this person what to do we gotta tell them this and we gotta tell them that and we gotta convince them and we gotta uh that that's not the god called us to preach the gospel whether it's a word whether it's a deed whether it's a life whether it's behind a pulpit whatever wherever god called us to preach the gospel amen i'm not telling you what to do i'm just laying the scripture down amen you know and he said and you know what the holy ghost can come right now while we're speaking see he puts it off of himself onto the holy spirit the holy ghost is a gift of god that is the gift of god it could come while we're speaking if the people was taught right now we mentioned that a little bit sunday uh probably precipitated from this if the people was taught right some of you old timers here let me ask you something the old timer says been in the tabernacle watch when i baptize people listen this is really good when i baptize people and you ministers take this for an example i've taught these people till they had that life cleaned up before they went in the water what did he do he preached the gospel he didn't just convince somebody that they needed to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he didn't just tell this christian brother right here you got to go right now and get baptized in the name of jesus christ no he said i preached the gospel and i laid the scripture out so that they got their lives cleaned up before they even hit the water amen again that's something that right that's something that'll hold the person amen he said they had that life cleaned up before they even went to the water and i had them believing that god was obligated to keep his promise as soon as they was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ now you see how he throws in being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ without telling the brother you've got to do this you see i 1954. it's just outstanding this is god right it's just god and and it upsets so much of the alpha card of the of the normal way of thinking and and sometimes the way brothers preach and and try to convince people try to uh get people to to follow their rules and it's just so this is just so far removed from that amen it's outstanding to me the holy spirit was right there to receive it and when they come up out of the water they receive the holy ghost because he had them by the by the word into a place where their lives were cleaned up they were ready for baptism and when they came out of the water the holy spirit came on them amen and notice again he said baptized in the name of jesus christ he puts that in there so that they understand that's the scriptural baptism amen but he didn't tell the man what to do he just gave him the word and that's exactly what we're supposed to do give them the word right even john said what just give them the word test you know if you give them the word test you can find out where the person is you know brother brother green told that story about that man one time and and he was against the course of the branamites the people that uh followed brother bradham or were brother branham converts whatever you want to say and he was mad at them and he said oh uh uh uh i i don't follow any man uh i don't follow any man i i i never follow a man you all follow a man i never follow a man brother green said he got to talking to the man you got to find out that everything was about his wife and brother green looked at him and said you know sir you're right you don't follow a man you follow a woman all right here you go amen but usually somebody's following somebody the whole point of the gospel the whole point of ministering the gospel is to get us all to follow christ amen amen praise the lord say yeah you're not following the man you're following a woman when they come up out of the water they had the holy ghost shepherds teach your sheep get them in the bible amen teach them amen don't tell them teach them the difference yeah you agree with me now there's a difference there's only a few of us yeah you agree there i can't hear you if you're streaming but um you agree now you see what i'm saying you understand there's a difference between teaching them and telling them right amen there's a difference amen there's a there's a huge spiritual difference away from that old textbook of some church and get down here in the bible where god is taught right you won't and you won't have those troubles yes laying on of hands is how we can receive the holy ghost by some anointed person laying hands doesn't mean that's the only we can receive the holy ghost it is a way amen that's provided scripturally that people could receive the holy ghost amen it is possible that that is a way but as far as a minister pastor and and brother green has said this uh i remember many many times the pastor's not your holy ghost right right uh brother green would say this like i said many times he would say i am not your holy ghost and and i would say that too i am not your holy ghost your best friend or the person that led you to christ your brother branham is not your holy ghost the one that is to lead you the one that is to guide you the one is to bring you into all truth amen by the preaching of the word now the preaching of the word of course is is an integral part of it the preaching has to be done but again there's a big difference in teaching somebody and telling and telling somebody something right amen that's that's again that's the reason a lot of people mistake um you know our thoughts our fellowship is uh not uh specifically but you know christian believers i'll just say apostolic faith uh message believers that that were legalists because of that we're legalists we just have a bunch of rules and you know they they always get upset well we're free to do whatever we want to no you're just bound to the devil and you don't know it that's their biggest thing because they all conform to some kind of an image amen those images brother dan uh uh uh evans came and talked to us about those images amen those people had those images just like the image of daniel that the the three three hebrew children were supposed to bow down to amen supposed to bow down to daniel a lot of people today that they they want to pay homage and bow down to william brown oh my yeah what an image friend people make people make a person an image people make a church an image amen that image is going to be what they're going to worship until they die whatever it is and it's sad because those images is what is is where that legalism is built on amen and they're they're told what to do and they're going to do it they're going to that's it that's the same nicolaitan system that that uh that's been from the first church that the catholic church is built on that nicolaitanism amen now let's go to romans um chapter 10. amen i i i just the feeling the the thought the the point across but they've got a couple more scriptures i want to get to romans chapter 10 verse 12. amen romans 10 12 for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall how shall they believe in him of who they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher so there's got to be preaching right there's got to be ministering to get people to care to get people to be a place to where they are no longer ignorant they're taught they're taught the gospel but the teaching the gospel is not is is just preaching it's putting the word out there amen and how shall they preach except they be sent sometimes i think there's a lot of those but anyway uh as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things the gospel the gospel has to be preached amen it's got to be ministered it's scriptural that god calls uh men by the holy spirit anointing gift to to preach the gospel to minister the gospel in his capacity that god has those selected and chosen people that he's desired for whatever reason to be able to fulfill that office right and those people are to preach the gospel that's what their job is right amen that's that's all god's commissioned them to do is to preach the gospel amen and invisible union program says what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to christ just the same as the woman hands and as a woman drifts off with another man when the church goes off on an institutional program building programs schools and so forth brother bannon says i have nothing against them brothers brother branham said he didn't have anything against institutional programs nothing against their building programs or building their schools he said i have nothing against them they're all all right they serve their purpose but jesus never said to go build schools jesus said to preach the word that's what their job is that's what the commission of the church is that's what the commission of the pastor the preacher is to preach the word amen the bible didn't say to go build a school the bible didn't say to go build a hospital the bible didn't say to go build a bible school or some kind of institution it said preach the word that's the job that's the duty that's what god's given us to do now remember again brother man said there's nothing wrong with the school there's nothing wrong with the police department there's nothing left the gospel and the word in christ everything's all cattywompus and upside down amen the government's trying to take care of everything when it's not supposed to be that way and interfere in people's lives where they have no business interfere on the government and then the government dictates the way that the person is supposed to live that's that sounds like the bondage of the children of israel in egypt to me so much so that when there is israel came out of egypt they're like oh we had plenty to eat back there oh we had the flesh pots and we we had everything so good they forgot apparently that all the beating on their back had healed enough to where they forgot about it and they forgot about their gnarled up hands were so blistered and bleeding by making the pharaohs brick they forgot all about that when it all healed up they're like oh we wish we were back in egypt and that's the exact same thing happens today people the government gets in control see look friend when there's a when there was a person that needed there was a poor person it was the church's responsibility to take care of that it was the church's responsibility to help them and to feed them and to get them a job and to get them back on their feet and to get them to be a viable citizen again but the government has done nothing but created a bunch of laziness by giving everything to everybody and now people don't want to do anything anymore because they get everything for free right my wife was telling me she we had a friend that is from egypt and she's muslim and she wears a headdress and everything and she's a very sweet lady i drove her around for a while with lou my friend that would move to boston and she had cancer in her face and she's pretty deformed and all but she's just the absolute sweetest spirit to be a muslim i just she's just the sweetest lady lou went up to hug her one time because he didn't realize he went up to hug her one time and she said no no no i said no no we don't allow that you can't touch me i thought my christian could get a good lesson from my mother amen she said no no you're not supposed to touch me when i drove her around she wrote in the back and then she wrote in the back with her face covered wow right amen that that modest and that respectful and i thought my what an example we call our christians uh it's it's just a shame amen but but she told sonya this last time she was in town she comes back like every other every six months or so to get check-ups with her cancer stuff and all believe it or not we have i guess apparently some of the best cancer doctor in the world in tucson so that's why she comes here and she's doing really good by the way but she was telling my wife because she lives in egypt but she's telling her she driving around she's like wow there's homeless people there's these people all over the place what are all these people in there homeless people and my and she told my wife she says you won't see this in egypt you come over there you won't see all these homeless people and my wife said well why not she said because we don't give them anything the people who work and sacrifice and make a living don't hand out to those people so the only way they can survive is to go to work themselves right get a job become a bible citizen of their country i thought man we we're in bad shape in this country friend in more than one way amen oh and i thought that's exactly but that that's that's exactly what they want to do though that's exactly what the whole foundation of satan's eden is built on is to control you and take it all away from you so they can dictate to you what you can and cannot do it's just like i heard about china about six months ago they china went in there and said you got to do this this and this you got to put up a picture of of uh shay jay peng and you got to take down anything that has anything to do with religion or jesus or no pictures no bibles nothing of of god or religion or christianity you got to get rid of all of it or you won't get a dime from us wow and put them out and basically told them this is the way they're going to have to do and of course who's going to get a job at a communist country if you're labeled a christian amen that's when you sit at the table and you say the empty table you say thank you lord for the food that we're about to receive because you get nothing amen as bad as it is here we are still a blessed country right amen it's still a blessed country god never said go make schools god never said go make hospitals god never said go make police departments and all this other stuff that's all of satan's eating amen that's all satan's eating he said well we've got to get education yeah that's just because of the society we live in well who controls the society we live in the devil satan does that's why we have to do that but it was not so from the beginning it wasn't in god's plan god just said to the church now these others that they can go whatever they want but to the church preach the word preach the gospel amen that's where brother graham said now preach the word that's where they neglect it not make institutions hospitals so forth them is all right but that's not the church's duty their duty is to preach the gospel but we do everything else but that he said oh my help us lord amen and that's what it's got to be in a lot of places that it's not even the the gospel is not even preached anymore that's right even if there's a reference to it in a lot of ways it's nothing but watered-down idea of somebody got from some school or seminary which is a school preach the word so what does the preaching of the word do it establishes a person in the gospel not in your religion right yeah amen it establishes a person in christ and not in the word of god tabernacle i don't want you established in the word of god tabernacle i don't want to be established yet i want to be established in christ the word that's what the preaching of the gospel will do like brother branham said it'll bring that person to where their life is right just because the word's there the life is there the spirit to bring the word to life and the person then it changes that person's life amen that's what makes a difference not legalism not rules oh i've seen people not seen coming from the south front and now it's the bible belt and and all that goes with it all the tremendous right but there there there's so much legalism i'll just keep using that same word there's so much legalism there's so much uh do's and don'ts if you're if your dress is not down to here and and you know all the popping circumstances if if everything about you is not exactly right you can't even come in wow yeah that's true there's a church in town that has two pages of rules for women yes i've read them i got the copy myself with the letterhead that tells me what church it came from two pages just for the women yeah why is that preaching the gospel that's getting you a convert that's trying to convert you to that church not to jesus that's trying to convert you to that pastor that religion that they that uh pseudo religion they created in their own little environment there not to jesus christ when the gospel is preached it comes with power and manifestation and it changes lives that's when lives are changed and in that the whole point is for lives to be changed my life your life it's changed the preaching of the gospel because of the word having the preeminence in philippians chapter two i'm going to close here in just a minute philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore my beloved brethren as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but how much more in my absence look at this now let me start this over wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but but now much more in my absence so he didn't make them paul he made them converse to christ they became converts to christ not to paul because when paul wasn't there they were ever that much more a christian in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling well now that doesn't sound like i'm supposed to tell you what to do amen just like that quote we read about brother branham is it wasn't that brother brown was supposed to tell him to do it you work out your own salvation with the holy spirit moving in your life as the word is preached that's how you get results work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for with fear and trembling now a lot of people say that working out our own salvation but sometimes they forget that fear and trembling part that's not fear and trembling of me or a pastor or a church that's fear and trembling of the of god amen amen in the presence of god for it is god which worketh in you both to do both to will and to do of his good pleasure amen amen amen praise the lord now somehow somehow i forgot to print this so i brought it up on my phone so i can read it to you here it's in broken sisters january 1965. they never had to pump it or pull it there you go amen you don't have to prime people to worship god you don't have to convince people or or get a set of pom poms or hooray hooray go go left give me an a and left give me a right give me a j and give me an e and give me an s you don't have to pump and pull people prime them and and all the emotion that goes with it amen no notice they never brother said never had your pump and pull it or they never had to ask now how do we use this water because they knowed how to use it amen now he's he's typing a water spigot with the church so you understand and so as a man or woman what regardless of what creed or denomination he belongs to if he is thirsty for god he don't have to run back to the seminary like this anglian brother did or british brother last night have to go back and consult how to the how to the anglian church how he must use this great gift he has got speaking in tongues and how he must do this they would kick him out to begin with see he was thirsty so god just filled him right that's all there is to it is thirsting and then he just fills it you don't have to have any control somebody tell you what to do with it amen you don't have to have anyone control you you don't have to have somebody tell you what to do with it god leads each individual in the way he wants you to go god does yes well if you do what i tell you you're doing what you're leaving amen praise the lord we just preach the gospel he wants you to you're an individual yourself you are a part of god nobody can take your place and there's no way to have uh no way to have to go to somebody and say now i'll have to do this or i'll have to do that or i have to conform to this no sir god uses it uh the way that he wants to when you're thirsty uh you know enough to get a drink exactly amen and that's the way it's supposed to be that's the way god meant for it to be when you're thirsty for god when you're thirsty for god then god will fill you if you're thirsty for a church or denomination or a man or some gift then that's what you're going to get but if you thirsty for god god will fill you he promised amen he will quench that thirst he promised amen and i used the word quench a little lightly because i've been in 30 over 30 years and i'm still not quenched i still want more i still want more and more and more but as that thirst gets greater the supply comes greater then it comes from him yes it comes from him it's not a word of god tabernacle convert it's a convert to christ it's not a conforming to an ideology of a certain church or or to my way or thought is to is to conform to the gospel of christ by the preaching of the word let god do the change amen one more scripture i'll close here in mark chapter 16 mark 16. you know what he says most of you all of you here probably know mark 16. mark 16 14 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they said it means and unbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he had risen and he said unto them what did he say to them go into all the world and build a school going into all the world and and feed the hungry going into all the world and and uh have a hospital medical care all those things again all those things are fine but not what the bible says right right their commission was to go into all the world and preach the gospel all the world and tell them what to do tell them how they're supposed to live no preach them the gospel tell them what the word says right amen then you don't have to worry about whether if there's there's anything there because god confirms that yes amen because it's his word right it's not my word it's not your word it's his word if it's his word he has to be the one to confirm it praise the lord he confirmed it in each of us he'll continue to do the same thing preach the gospel to every creature praise the lord every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned amen that doesn't fall on us either if you preach the gospel amen he that believeth amen and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name that shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues amen cast the devil out next door amen they somebody throw a window through the walk through their window too wow anybody see that coming in i saw when i was coming in earlier today i got here about noon one o'clock something like that and somebody else thrown a rock i went and told craig big old hole right there i said i kind of got an end i told him i said i'll probably have a little inkling of who did it but that's none of my business i just wanted to let him know so we could get it fixed but anyway cast out devils amen that we've done that pretty recently here even sunday with shariah they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen praise the lord that's the gospel that's not the gospel according to william brown i love the gospel according to newton bennett that's the gospel according to christ amen amen praise the lord i'll just stop there that's our call that's our commission amen and honestly i have to admit there probably have been many times in my life i've tried to tell people what to do i've tried to tell them how to do it right and then there's probably some people that have followed that i don't know but it's not my job to tell them what to do it's my job to tell them what the word says to lay the scripture to that person amen not tell them there's a difference there's a difference in the spirit there's a difference in your attitude there's a difference in the reception of it right i mean you you know when somebody's preaching and when somebody's telling you what to do or when somebody's giving you the fundamental foundation facts of the scripture and when they're telling you you've got to do this and you've got to do that and live by rules and regulations and do's and don'ts you know the difference you can tell amen we've all been to school right i was a teacher for seven years and and i can tell you now my students knew the difference when i was trying to tell them something and when i was just teaching them what the truth was what the facts of the subject was amen there's a difference preach the gospel let your life preach that the word lived through you amen if somebody has a question give them the word if you don't know the word get in the word like brother branham said get in the word know the word let the word become you so did you know what the word says not not that you you you you have to do this you know this this is what the bible says right amen i like that quote brother graham says i'm not going to tell you what to do all i'm going to do is give you the word give you the scripture and then god's obligated if you belong to him the holy spirit will come in and confirm that word to your heart and you become a christian amen praise the lord let's stand if we could amen you know if you become if you become a convert because what i told you to do and i'm responsible for you amen i'm responsible for you if i'm the one that you're listening to if i'm the one that that convinced you and and and got you to believe my convincing argument i'm responsible for you but if you believe what the gospel says through preaching and you believe what this word says and you live the life you live because of what it taught you and what the holy spirit quickened to you then he is responsible for you not me that's why i said over five years ago now i felt that god led me to start this and that made it his church not mine amen this is not my church i uh i i know i have a lot of control over but i i do that based on what i feel led of god and i give all of us the opportunity numerous times for input and how you feel about it and what you think about a situation or how we should perceive this way and how we should proceed that way because it's not my church it's his church that we are the members of because we are the church amen i i don't mean that to sound like it shirks my responsibility or ours it doesn't shirk any of our responsibilities as part of this church but it's his church that's the bottom line amen this church is his any work he starts he's obligated to amen that that's uh uh i mean i that's the part i love amen because it's i just a part of him a part of that work amen and to to live it and to be it as he would have us to do amen praise the lord jesus amen you ever get a verse of a song and you don't know what the song the name of the song draw me nearer i knew if i thought of it long enough 38 i knew if i thought on it long enough the lord would bring it to me 38th amen we'll just sing like maybe the first verse first couple we're saying this yellow i believe you said this the other day bro didn't we i think yeah amen here we are again praise the lord [Music] i have heard thy voice [Music] so draw me here hear a blessing lord to the cross draw me nearer [Music] consecrate me now to thy service lord by the power of [Music] a grace hope and my will be lost nearer blessed [Music] lord [Music] there are deaths of love that i cannot know till i cross the narrow sea there are heights of joy that i may not reach till i rest in [Music] lord to the cross [Music] to thy precious [Music] amen that's the truth isn't it praise the lord and he wants to be more consecrated to him more dedicated to him draw me nearer to you lord jesus not to a church to a man pastor but to you lord draw me closer to you remember those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled yes what is the righteousness of christ god the word amen the gospel the gospel that we are to preach amen to propagate to other people amen thank you jesus i'm so thankful god makes a way for us god shines that gospel light into our pathways draws us closer to him and makes us more like him amen thank you jesus you love him tonight amen amen it's been so good to us hasn't he amen pray something was said to bless and strengthen some way tonight amen thank you for streaming if you've been with us tonight amen i pray the lord bless you as well amen we'll be back here lord willing sunday 10 30. well that's when it starts i'll be here a lot earlier than that but when church starts it's 10 30. amen if you feel to get here earlier praise the lord we'll read and pray and create an atmosphere amen see what god does amen thank you lord i um those may be streaming those i'll mention this again sunday but i talked to uh craig the the landlord the owner of the place and asked him if we could try to procure a little building a little space maybe about twice the size of the part that we got in the front here to have a little meal um i'm thinking i was thinking in a couple weeks but i started he asked me when i thought well maybe he said we probably could he'd have to re do some research i almost said well if you clean that junk out next door that'd be perfect but i didn't tell them but um i think it may be between thanksgiving and and christmas if that would work maybe this uh the 5th of december or the 12th of december or something like that on a sunday if it didn't work on a sunday we could try a saturday or something because my wife has raised the the concern of maybe or to keep food cool or things like that if we if we make it to where we do it on a saturday or something there's no worry of that you just come and that's we cover the purpose of bringing the food and then we eat fellowship and when and then go home so but anyway well i'll mention again sunday i just wanted to bring that before you tonight and those if you're still if you're still watching and uh think about that and pray about it and see uh what the lord might uh do for us but i did approach him and he said yeah that'd be fine he'd just have to find a place see what a date would be and we'll go from there so amen lord richard bless you appreciate each one of you appreciate you coming tonight as i said i know there's other streaming but it makes a huge difference when there's faces here to preach to so thank you for coming amen god bless you amen we'll be dismissed tonight amen god's been good to us isn't disney amen praise the lord brother pat would you dismiss us in prayer thank you jesus for coming here being with us today thank you for convicting us to come yes listen to learn yes jesus we need your revelation when we hear someone tell us something we go to the bible you've provided for us and we wait for your revelation to understand yes and speak to us we want the truth we love you lord jesus and we ask that you go with us as we go our individual ways keep us safe and healthy in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord god bless you tonight amen [Music] [Music] my
