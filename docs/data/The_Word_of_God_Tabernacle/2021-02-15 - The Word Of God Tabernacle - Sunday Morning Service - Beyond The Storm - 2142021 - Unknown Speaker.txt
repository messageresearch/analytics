via she asked that we uh please pray for my or her brother daniel uh he's in the hospital after suffering a stroke that affected his right side and then she also has another one she received a text another text from her niece about her sister esther she's back on the ventilator after uh being taken off for a day so just want to remember both these needs in prayer does anyone else have a need that they'd like to make known this morning yes sister i'd like to ask for prayer for my right my right shoulder has been hurting continuing for those of you who on the stream who may have not heard sister she was just asking for a touch uh for right shoulder she's been having some trouble for the last three weeks with it so please remember her and prayer brother john i thought i said yeah uh she made me uh think of the shoulder thing sister sheila uh yeah i've been having pain in my shoulders when i lay down at night so i don't know if it's a side effect of the medicine they give me for what happened to the left side of my face pain medication so maybe i'll try to stop taking that and see what happens because it's awful like the muscles it's something to do with the muscles when i'm relaxing so you can agree with me and prayer concerning that don't allow me to sleep much i don't know that's not good that's not good thank you prayer amen anyone else have a prayer request let's just stand as we uh ask the lord to intervene on these needs that we have this morning brother dennis would you mind i just pray out to the lord for these needs amen lord jesus we bow our heads and hearts together as a family of believers of light precious faith sitting together in heavenly places knowing that we serve a living god that is mindful of our needs in ourselves we can only do so much but we serve a god that can do all things that with you nothing's impossible and father there are needs that's been expressed several that need a touch with their shoulder problems we know that you're a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and by your stripes we are healed we're claiming that portion from thee you said in your word if two shall agree is touching one thing it shall come to pass you said ask and you shall receive knock and the door shall be opened and we believe father that each and every one will have their needs met as they have come faith believing come into this house of worship knowing that we are here for one reason and has to be better christians to be better prepared for a soon coming rapture and father our sister lydia had some real serious requests concerning her brother daniel and her sister father you know what they have need of and above all father as we believe the hours so late if they haven't accepted you as the lord and savior of their life lord may they first make that important most important decision of their life and lord may you come on the scene and touch them deliver them take away all that discomfort and all that they're going through father especially i hear her sister is back on the ventilator it sounds serious but father with you it's not serious father you can intervene and meet our needs according to your your riches and glory and father bless the remainder of our service bless our pastor as he labors faithfully to bring forth your word open our hearts father to receive from you what we have need of the hours late the world's fallen apart as peter said some say where is the coming of the lord things remain the same but we know that's not true we know peter was saying it's always a time to be ready speak to our hearts if you don't speak father we'll just remain laxatical and caught up in this little seeing spirit amen oh bless each and every one may we come out of this building different than what we came in may our hearts truly burn within us have we met with you along the way in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen thank you you may be seated uh just want to give a quick testimony uh i just want to thank the lord for being with joel during his tonsil tonsil sectomate uh this past thursday went well and he's recovering he's still in pain uh you know that's hurt him quite a bit uh now and then but uh just continue to remember him in prayer for a quick recovery but thank the lord it went well for him amen does anyone have a testimony this morning that they'd like to share yes brother dennis yeah quick testimony um this past sunday as i was going back and taking danny home to his apartment complex uh there's a a man that lives right above danny and he's real quiet he's indian but you know that's his uh heritage and uh usually when he sees you he just nods so we're coming and he he started speaking to us he said how are you doing i said good then he paused and says where do you go to church i said we i told him where we went i told him it's just down the street for where you live and um i said you're welcome to come anytime you know and he says great god bless you and he walked out i thought you see people are watching us closer than what we think and uh this man was really he's not that friendly india how are you doing you know but this time he took notice and what spoke to danny and my heart he's a christian i heard a testimony of a person that went to pray for somebody and the lord visited them right after this happened and said that's how you grow a church that was the healing that person received it and the lord jesus came in and says now that's how you start a church amen and anyone else have a testimony all right and i believe sister norma said she had a song special she'd like to share this morning so she would go ahead and come up and share it with us that'd be great for me because you know i'm nervous [Music] of cares [Music] you've [Music] do you know [Music] amen have you heard that he loves you and that he [Music] praise the lord amen is [Music] [Music] oh do you know my friends have you heard that he loves you and that he will love [Music] and then god bless you um i'll try this today um very popular songs so if you want to sing along feel free i was thinking this week because today being valentine's day having a love themed service and for some reason i i realized that the color that the world has chosen for love is red but do they realize that red's the color the blood that jesus shed for us amen that's the real meaning of love [Music] is praise the lord jesus who died [Music] is [Music] please and know how i love jesus how i love jesus it tells me what my father had every day [Music] shine all of [Music] whose loving heart can feel [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] first lovely [Music] i lift up my hands [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] see me love you [Music] to jesus [Music] sing it to him [Music] you lord [Music] love love you love you thank you let's sing that song love of god number 93 in the song book here praise jesus praise you jesus

oceans [Music] uh every day [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is is [Music] one more time [Music] is [Music] praise the lord purity of love simple four-letter word people talk about the world chirps about all the time of course they don't know what love is all they know is the filio that they feel the affection of another from one person to another amen but unless you've known the love of god you don't know what love is amen amen the love of god that passes all understanding that loved me when i was unlovable that gave his life for those who were redeemable by his love and by his love we now stand unconditional amen that's my favorite word when it comes to the love of god you've heard me say it probably many times but unconditional it's my favorite word when it comes to the love of god it is unconditional amen and if you have the love of god then that love that you show that's in your heart to others and to god is unconditional amen amen praise the lord it's without condition amen there's no um there's no quit pro quo there's no i'll do this if you do this and because you did this i'll do this no you look all right period love is because god is amen praise the lord and i appreciate his love he's been so good to me amen his unfailing love amen where would we be without it today saints praise the lord god bless you welcome to the house of the lord again today appreciate you coming being here and just trusting the lord brought you here and then we're gonna uh just have a continuance of a wonderful service filling his presence and knowing him to be so near so dear and just trust him to speak to us from his word now amen so let's stand to our feet if we could we'll turn in the scripture to matthew chapter 14. matthew chapter 14 is where i want to start reading with verse 22. matthew 14 22. chapter 14 verse 22. amen before we read the word of god though could we just bow our heads for another one word of prayer precious jesus we thank you again today lord for so much of what you've done for us everything you've done for us lord we wouldn't even be here if it weren't for you god forgiving yourself and dying at calvary and shedding that precious blood lord for that blood to still lay at that mercy seat there making intercession on our behalf taking our place that we might could take yours justifying us lord by that precious blood as though we had never sinned in the first place believing god that you are still present with us lord and never leave us or forsake us and we thank you father for this service for this time to come out of the world and out of the weather out of everything god that's around us and just come and have this nice sacred beautiful time together with ease of like precious faith expecting you once again to speak to us from your word we're so thankful god of what you've done for us through this week and lord if you would carry continue to bless us lord in the oncoming life that we live god that you've given us to live for you yes lord we are sheep to your pasture and god you lead us and guide us the way you would have us to go give us strength health and life in our bodies mind spirit soul that we can continue to press this battle and do the will of the lord jesus in our lives whatever it may be god lord may you just bless us and help us with it lord i pray that you would speak from your word to us today once again show us in here what you'd have us to see and know as we draw closer to you from it lord may you continue lord with your presence here and just sweep through this place continually lord and lord just bless us may your word go forth and heal those that are sick in bodies meet every need lord and strengthen us god again lord i pray that you bless them bless those that are streaming today lord those who do your bride internationally god wherever they may be bless them god and strengthen and watch over protect them provide for them keep us everyone hedged and protected lord god by your holy angels father from all the germs diseases afflictions the coveted lord in the name of jesus christ god we just thank you for all that you do for us and now god as we commit this and as we open this sacred word lord again and read from it father may you bless it may you bless it and reveal it to our hearts as we committed to you now the remaining part of this service in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen praise the lord will uh i'll just read one verse of scripture and then we'll let you be seated and before we uh and then come back and read the whole thing um let's just read the 32nd verse 30 set matthew chapter 14 verse 32 says and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased and you could be seated if you like but i do want to jump back over as you're having your seats i do want to jump back over to the 22nd verse just not leave you standing so long but the 22nd verse and and capture this entire story uh as it's given to us here is matthew's account of it now there's matt there's accounts of it mark and luth too but it doesn't go into the account of peter and peter's the one that i wanted to talk about at this point here today uh as of a couple of weeks ago uh i was in the position where uh i thought i was done with a certain scripture and then before i could get home the lord gave me uh more to go on that scripture kind of the same thing happened not exactly but it gave me the fault of uh even though i was looking at something else and starting a different series on after the storm last week we talked about the present storm and the storm that we're going through and what's happening in our lives what's happening in the world today uh and and the thought came to me of after the storm but then when i started studying it and i started looking at it and recognizing the day that we live there won't be now we all have of course our personal storms that we go through in life i'm not talking about that of course that can be coupled in with this but the storm i'm talking about of course is the overall storm that's happening in the world and what's happening in christianity and what's happening to god's bride internationally that's the main thing i want to focus on today so in focusing on that each one of our personal storms of course we know the lord blesses us and helps us we walk through them we see the light at the end of the tunnel god blesses us to reach that uh the end of that tunnel that into that storm and and there's nice calm sunshine it's beautiful on the other side but when i started thinking about the overall picture of this and what we're looking at in the world today there's not going to be an end to this storm uh there's not going to be and after the storm not here anyway so my focus became well then where do we go from there if there's not going to be an after the storm here because this world is going to end up in armageddon and burned in this nation as we know burn border border coast goes so that's that's where this is ending up in apostasy so there won't be that into that storm or the after the storm so what i look at then when the lord gave me the thought then is beyond the storm beyond the storm not necessarily after the storm but beyond the storm because even in the middle of the storm we still live beyond the storm amen so that's what i want to get into today is uh you might understand with this story of peter walking on the water but again let's go back to the 22nd verse and and begin reading there and again my subject today is beyond the storm beyond the storm last week we were in the present day storm we're beyond the storm we talked we want to talk about and straightway now this is of course after jesus fed the 5 000 and uh with the two loaves the five loaves and two fishes and uh and jesus straightway constrained his disciples to get into his ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had uh sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart away from everybody else to pray and when the evening was come the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea now you notice that while jesus entered into his prayer by the time that he got to the place of a completion of his prayer or his conver his conversation uh as we have that we spend time with the lord uh he went toward the ship he went to go in the ship but it was the fourth watch now fourth watch if you know scripturally is the last watch of the night they break the watch up of a knight into four different watches and the and the last watch the is the fourth watch so this was at the time again like we talked about last week before the breaking of day where that fourth watch is is when it is the darkest it is the darkest uh before the dawn of course so this fourth watch is that darkest time it's that darkest point now jesus having just prayed went to the was going to the ship but of course god always has a way of doing things and god always has a reason for doing things and he sent them ahead i believe for this very purpose right as he comes walking now if you go look at i can't remember if it's mark or luke's account one of them it talks about how many furlongs they were out in the sea if you and i did a little uh math on that yesterday and if you map it out it was about three miles according to what the bible says in furlongs the ship had gone and it was about three miles off the shore they had rode three miles into now the bible says this matthew's account says they were in the midst of the sea but according to i saw that again that matthew was about three miles out but jesus comes walking on the water up to the boat now a lot of times you'll see depictions of walking on water as it just as nice and calm as the concrete that we're standing on but i want you know that's not what the bible says right the bible says the waves were were whipping because the wind was contrary the wind was blowing the waves and the ship was being tossed back and forth so jesus wasn't walking on water like we look at a floor that's just flat he was walking on the top of the waves he was walking on top of the tumultuous water that was that was white capping so that it was coming over the boat that's the water jesus was walking on he wasn't walking on cold water friend he was walking on stormy water amen amen you understand what i'm saying he's walking on stormy water not just flat plain peaceful water everybody you know when everything's nice and peaceful and everybody's a christian and everything is good and everybody's happy and everything's pleasant good no it's in the middle of the storm that we look at jesus walking on the water when jesus comes to you in the middle of that storm he was coming to them at the darkest time he was coming to them at the at the worst time but he comes walking in a supernatural way amen how many times he come to you in a supernatural way you look and think how could this ever happen how could it go from here to here how could this ever uh be done or fixed or healed or whatever it is god comes in the darkest of times and walks the crests of the waste to make sure he gets to your boat right to make sure that you're taken care of in the fourth watch now he's coming to them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble seeing it as a spirit and they cried out for fear now notice these were fishermen and this is not the first time they had been on a boat in the middle of the sea that was tossing them and about to sink them right you go back to matthew 8 of course is accounted also in other uh uh books of the bible luke matthew luke mark but in matthew 8 they had already been in the storm but jesus had told them let's go to the other side jesus had told him that let's go to the other side well friend there wasn't enough waves there wasn't enough wind there wasn't enough water lightning thunder there wasn't enough devils could pour out of hell to stop that boat from getting to the other side you know why because jesus said something right and when jesus said so that made it possible that made it happen period whether they were on the other side yet or not he had already spoken it right and there wasn't nothing going to stop that boat from getting to the other side but they became fearful they became afraid because the winds were tossed in the boat about and it was up and down the wind the water was coming into the boat and guess who was sleeping in the boat jesus amen they are out there with tubs and dumping water out and they're scared to death and they're yelling and screaming and somebody's like go get jesus and they go down there and he's asleep right they have to wake him up can you imagine being in a boat he ever been in a boat like that anybody ever been in a boat that's that's uh got some waves going and is tossing or at least rocking you ever been out in the ocean on a boat i've been deep sea fishing i've been out on the ocean boat i i don't do that because it's not very i'm not very kind to me um i i tend not to keep my breakfast if i go out like that so i i tend not to do that i love to do it but give me a pond or a lake any day where it's flat like the concrete but when i get out in the ocean and those waves and you know it doesn't take long and i'm done so but but jesus is asleep and the waves are tossing the boat back and forth the waves are coming into the boat and he's sleeping so they have to go wake him up said jesus and he said oh my why you such little faith where is your faith now he doesn't say this scripture doesn't record this but could you just imagine he probably stand there say that look i just told you we're going to the other side did you not believe what i told you did you not trust me at my word i said we're going to the other side that's what's going to happen it doesn't matter how many waves there are it doesn't how much water comes into the boat we're going to the other side amen that's it and so jesus he comes up on the bow of the boat because of their lack of faith and he says when be still and the storm stops right the water comes wind goes away maybe the sun comes out and they're nice and calm then everything is fine and that's exactly what it is for people in their lives they just everything becomes calm and they're like oh okay good i can go to church again oh well you should have been going to church whole time space that's the you know it seems like the time that people quit going it's the time they should be going the most amen when the troubles of life strike and when things get hard the first thing you want to do is start coming i think that's that's when you should come you know let's pray for you lay hands on you something that's the best time to come it's when the waters are are tumultuous right right and and and the storm stopped well here now they're afraid it doesn't say they're afraid because of the storm it says they're afraid because they saw jesus and thought it was a spirit that that's what made them afraid according to this scripture they were troubled saying it's the spirit and cried out with fear just because they thought this is a spirit come walking on the water well in all fairness it does pretty much defy logic for anybody to walk on water right yeah that just i mean i've heard of it happening outside of this scripture of people individuals needing to an emergency situation get from one end of the lake to another and they walk across the lake i believe that's true anybody if you had the need and the situation rose and you had the faith you'd be able to do this exact same thing yeah amen i believe that but see they were afraid because of what they saw now these were fishermen i can't imagine as they went out of their boat on the sea every day that they didn't run into storms before that they didn't run into waves and the rockiness of the storm but the fear came because of the unknown the unknown fear that's and that's what gets a lot of people the unknown is what people are scared of a lot of people are scared to die when i was a little kid at one point i didn't want to die i was afraid to die i want my parents and family and i because it was something that's of the unknown right and a lot of people still today it is something of the unknown they don't know even christians sometime will come and say they don't know that it's of the unknown so the unknown is what they're afraid of not necessarily the death or the process of death or losing a loved one it's the unknown but i praise the lord jesus that today we've had a prophet of god that's gone beyond the curtain of time and told us exactly what it's like so it's not unknown anymore amen you can't fear what you know because you know it's there because jesus has already prepared a place for us yeah and we had a prophet go and and and record say it was like this and this and we can know exactly praise the lord there's no unknown but the world doesn't know that right how much of today is of the uncertainty as of the unknown the world today they think they have all the answers but the truth is they have no answers right they go from one point to the next point and it just just keeps getting darker and darker but why does it keep getting darker and darker with every decision to make with every election we'll say and it comes along and all the laws they pass and the mandates and all the things they do it just keeps getting darker and darker but why is it getting darker it's getting darker because this is the time of the finality of this world's history right it's also getting darker because they're not basing their decisions on scripture on the word they're basing their decisions on what they think is the right thing to do and what they think might get it from this point to this point and make it all better right the other reason it's getting darker is the motives the motives behind people is not for the people anymore the elected officials leaders people that are in a great big business have tons of money the motive is not for the little guy like you and me the motive is for how are they going to get richer how are they going to be able to sustain how are they going to be able to rise above this and get better that's what they care about it's my for and no more right a lot of times it's what it's become unfortunate in this world like i talked about the other day the love of money greed popularity power people out there today hungry for power they want power so much and this climate change situation has taken over in a lot of those venues where people have indoctrinated themselves i'm surprised that i don't drive around tucson today now i've seen certain churches in certain it says it's the church that church of tamra is actually right down here on the corner i have no clue what that even is but it's called the church of tamara i don't i don't know what that is but down here on floyd wells you just you go down country club turn left on flowing wells it's right there on the left church of tamra i don't know what that is there's another one over here on pima's got all kinds of gold stuff and emblems and stuff all over it uh between uh will mountain and croft on pima there's a some kind of church it says it's some religious organization but i'm i'm actually surprised and maybe there is i just haven't passed it that there's not a church out here today that says the church of the climate change it's become such a religion to people amen the church of climate change and that's they go to worship their climate change they bow down to their wind or wave or whatever they i don't know al gore maybe that's terrible i'm not sure maybe that's their person but anyway i'm surprised it's not but you you understand the power that's behind that i mean a lot of religious leaders it got me to thinking about a quote i read last week and i want to read it again that it talked about and brother branham said in many places about germ warfare and diseases and things that would hit this earth that the skin would melt off the people and the doctors would know nothing about but you know there's people out there today wealthy people powerful peoples those of whom i might know or have heard but i will not say on streaming but very powerful people they believe that this world should only have a half a billion people that means you've got to kill off six and a half billion people why are you going to do it yeah well you could start with covent amen you could start with coven but look at this brother madam said the oncoming storm we see the newspapers on coming storm when you go home tonight do me a favor read revelation 8 chapter you see the oncoming plagues and storms that's to hit this earth you know a lot of times we think uh we think things are just something that god just snaps his finger and all of a sudden supernatural gets there but you know god allows and manipulates the devil to be able to get into people to cause these things to happen sometimes because you know bible said brother brown said man will destroy themselves right man will destroy themselves and he said god will destroy those who destroys the earth so you think about scripturally now these things are about to hit the earth the plagues the storms as they hit the earth thunder's light is going to shake the heaven woes are going to pass over the nation men will rot in their flesh diseases will strike them the doctors know nothing about what is the best way that these people out here have in their minds to try to eradicate six billion people i'll just sneak out a little something here kill a little bit they call it population control you know unless you're in a third world country then they call it genocide but you know if we're civilized people we call it population control sterilize people in a way that they can't have children ovulate and kind of kill off some of the others that they you know they're not going to be worth much anyway like courses cloven has killed off a lot of the older people you know because they become expendable they're not important anymore you know reach a certain age and uh you know we don't need you anymore well i beg to differ but that's a whole nother subject but this whole thing is is is is the darkness that's driving it that the storm that's taking over that men are destroying themselves men people are causing these things to happen and they're killing all people on purpose to try to control they are so indoctrinated with this thing that they they they're killing people off and of course you get away with it because you know uh joe blow scientists over here might know about it but all a certain guy has to do is you know stick a couple meal in his bank account and dr joe blows my mouth gets shut you know oh i'm set for life now so whatever else happens you know of course the next one that might get it might be his daughter right or his father or whatever but you know i think if these people really want to do population control they should begin with themselves they don't want to do that though see that's a whole other thing they're not willing they're not that committed jesus was so committed to us into this uh we won't call it religion but uh to us that he gave himself right he died himself he was the one that was willing to because of what he because of who we were to to to die to bring us to himself to uh anoint and to bring this uh this move this this word to a place of putting it into the hearts of the people that we've become so uh filled with his spirit that we will do what he tells us to do amen amen it's not ethical uh unethical it's not immoral it's not unrighteous it's in the righteousness and truth of god's word so you see the contrast you see the waves capping jesus walking on the water now jesus is walking on the water then what is the next thing to happen is to calm everything down right amen that's what jesus does amen once the once the waves have come and the and the the appointed purpose has taken place then it comes right back down to where it was supposed to be but look what it says here when they were when they were afraid 27th verse now straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid amen and peter remember big now peter amen peter's always uh got something to say good bad and different peter's always got something to say remember that's why he became the spokesman of the group there that's why on the day of pentecost god used what uh peter's mouth would get him in trouble sometimes but god used that on the day of pentecost he was the spokesman and stood out there and told exactly what was going on behind him right what was happening with the moving and the feeling of the holy ghost he explained it to the people and said you can have it too right be baptized repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall have what they've got amen amen and it's just what the scripture said it's just what joel taught us it's just a fulfillment of that if you know the bible you know exactly what uh what what was going to take place well friend if we know the bible we know exactly what's taking place now what's going to take place today but look what jesus did jesus lived beyond the storm and i say that even though he was in the middle of the storm he lived beyond the storm because his wall was defiant to all of the elements that was going on around him he was walking on the water he was walking through the wind the waves the the uh the storm and everything that was going on around him oblivious to that just walking or cresting the waves going across so he was living walking above or beyond the storm right he was in it amen okay i hope you understand what i'm trying to say he was in it but he was beyond it because the elements weren't affecting him it may have been blowing his his uh coat or mantle uh and things like that he may have been getting wet probably was i'm sure he was so he was feeling the effects of it but he was living beyond it amen that's what the bride is to do today is to be in a place to live in a place to where you're living beyond the storm you're living beyond what's going on yes laodicea is going on yes we feel the effects of what's going on in this country and in our lives and in in the situations we feel the effects of all that but we live beyond that yeah yes amen we live beyond that hope under that makes sense now when jesus was there and he was living beyond the storm amen you like my our audition amen uh brother brother dennis donated a hoffman head to us and um we were going to get it reframed and sonia decided to fix the frame but i was tired of it being a blank wall so i just bought ours over so this is our pick this is actually ours that hung in our home and sonia's going to fix the other one to put up here so anyway amen i like it too so i'm glad you like it but now as jesus jesus is walking beyond the storm when he's uh living beyond the storm he's showing to the disciples how they should live and because we have to understand we look in the bible and we see the life of jesus we look in the message and we see what brother branham did and how he lived and and we think okay that was great that was jesus oh that was great that was brother branham jesus didn't live this to be for him only right brother branham was not an example by jesus christ for him to do that alone right those lives were examples that we were supposed to emulate if jesus lived it we can live it if jesus did it we can do it if jesus said it we can say it because god christ came so that he would be our example and as he's walking on the water to the boat he's doing it as an example to those that were in the boat all things are possible to you that's exactly what he told them nothing shall be impossible unto you well if he did that then what does that tell us today then that tells us that nothing is impossible to you nothing is impossible to me so what did peter do peter answered him and said lord if be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come that's the whole point he probably could have stood there and said how about the rest of you is peter the only one that's going to do it is peter the only one that has the faith now you know i have a scofield bible my school feel bible says jesus walks on the water and peter's little faith excuse me i'm sorry but it takes a lot more than just a little faith to walk on the water and that's exactly what peter did yes i know he began to sink but he walked on the water from the boat to where jesus was right that's what it says jesus just said come and he probably said where's the rest of you well i'm the rest of you come out here and meet me the ball will take care of itself right we'll take care it's all going to be fine why don't you just all come out here in the middle of the waves and let's just have a nice revival but see there was only one that could do it only one that had the faith the confidence to be able to step off that boat and walk on the water to where jesus was standing and that was peter so jesus said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus amen notice the water had not calmed yet so the water that peter was walking on was the exact same water that jesus was walking on and it wasn't like the concrete it wasn't like a flat surface this was waves and wind and it was a tumultuous time that he's walking and cresting the waves just to try to get to jesus amen amen the man just like you and i oh that was peter well what about us right amen aren't you a human too aren't you a believer too aren't you one of god's chosen aren't you uh one of god's children don't you have faith to believe then what about us now understand i'm not going to go out to silverbell lake and just try to walk across it that's not how it works but i believe if i was there and there was a need for me to have to get across their emergency or something i absolutely believe that be just like concrete yes just walk across it amen amen by faith believe what would jesus do if he was standing out there oh come on come on amen just come on and she and then peter got out of the boat and he walked up jesus right amen amen so that's not little faith to me so i i have an issue with schofield of course i have an issue with several notes of scofields in here but that one is another one peter's little faith no no peter walked on the waterfront it takes more than a little faith to walk from the water uh see we went to jesus but when peter got his eyes and saw the the blind bolsters he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me now we've all been there [Music] and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand caught him and said unto him and we've all been there too oh thou of little faith wherefore didest thou didst thou doubt where did you doubt what what came into this life jesus peter walked on the water but when as he began to sink jesus grabbed him and said you have little faith well what was that faith it was the lack of faith to continue on with what he was doing to continue on to walk just like jesus was walking now there's no account in here and of course mark and luke don't even account peter but there's no accounting here of how the two of them got to the boat some people say jesus carried peter some people believe peter walked on the water with jesus back to the boat we don't know i'd rather believe that he that when jesus picked him up and said where's your faith that he probably walked back with him and the two of them together walked back to the boat but that's just my opinion you can have your opinion that's okay because even if jesus carried him it's like the footprints in the sands of time you know there's two sets of footprints all of a sudden there's only one and you look back in life say well that was the hardest trial i had in my life and you've only one set of footprints why did you abandon me and the ones that said no that's my footprints i was carrying you amen amen could have been that too and that's fine if that's what happened that's okay but when they were coming to the ship i want you to see now when they came into the ship the wind ceased when they came into the boat it ended amen when jesus got there the wind ceased it stopped i also understand what peter was doing was even before the holy ghost had been given peter's faith and what peter was doing there was even before the holy ghost had fallen and come on to the people he still had the faith to believe at that time which shows you saints every man has dealt the measure of faith right people out here today they get healed how do they get healed if they're unbelievers or atheists and god's the one that's the healer because they have faith right they believe if they have belief whatever it is they have faith whatever it is that god uh that and god heals them because all healings of god they have to have faith when they come into the boat the wind ceased the storm stopped amen the storm stopped and then all of a sudden they're sitting there together then they were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god when they were gone over they came to the land of ganesha and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out unto all the country round about brought unto him all that were diseased and besought him that they might only touch the hymn of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole praise the lord perfectly whole so even if it was just for the briefest moment of time peter lived beyond the storm he walked on the water negating all the elements everything that was going on around the fact that it was on water which is impossible for humans to do outside of course supernatural he neglected all that forgot about all that kept his eyes on christ and he was able to walk on the water in the middle of all the elements the storm the way everything else that was going on beside the quota or the the uh thing that i told you last week mike had sent to me and says jesus was there the big storm going on behind him it says if you long as your eyes on me you can't see the storm don't keep your eyes on the storm keep your eyes on me amen that's a refocus and that's exactly what god wants us to do refocus to forget about and to look beyond i'm not saying forget i shouldn't use that i'm not saying forget about it because we're still here friends we're still a part of this world we still have a responsibility to it i'm not saying forgive but but live beyond the storm that's going on amen we feel the effects of it you say well how do i feel the effects of it well did they send you a stimulus check did you get it i see a fax uh tax time's up uh it's here are they gonna take money taxes out of your pay or you're gonna have to pay taxes that's the effects right and that's just simple uh dollars and cents that are a part of that uh scenario but it's still true it's that's part of the effects uh when they open up the board a bunch of illegals or whatever you're going to feel the effects people feel the effects i mean even if they're good people they take a lot of jobs and people feel the effects because they can't find a job i mean it's just that that's a whole other scenario but you understand you feel the effects of it regardless but we have but we're supposed to live beyond it right am i be beyond it amen i mean you you we're all here born again christians i believe we are trust we are for not i wouldn't leave this building until you got the holy ghost today that's exactly the hour that we're living friend you better be born again or it's not good news right but i trust you all have the holy ghost now holy ghost brings us into a different position with christ brings us into a different place with the word now look what brother branham said here in revelation chapter five uh it's number one june 61 he said but you see now we have by the holy spirit okay so our confession is we have the holy spirit all right well then this if we do this pertains to us by the holy spirit the earnest of our inheritance because we have been lifted up from the things of the world we have borne again been lifted up from the things of the world so you see where this is when you're when you're born again to have the holy ghost where you are living where we are supposed to live it's not out of the storm beyond the storm because there's not going to be an after right the after is when we're raptured gone home yes either uh death kisses us or or a body changing a rapture that's the end of our that's the end of that part of that storm for us but brother man said because we've been lifted up from the things of the world and we ride right along with the world but we're above the world you see what he said we ride along right with the world because we live here we eat drink and we live in the society in all of uh but we are above the world the bride those that are born again filled with the holy spirit are above the world beyond you know how to use that verbiage again beyond the world amen beyond the storm that's where our lives should be past that pe we get so engrossed in all the things that's going on sometimes we fail to remember who we are and where we came from right and that's not in this we're pilgrims and strangers here this that is not of this world we are not of this world if you're born again and have the holy spirit brother adam said we are above the world beyond the world what did we read that quote last week he talked about his wife said well we're americans these old man no we're not americans amen we're christians we're pilgrims and strangers in a strange land we live and ride along with it my birthright as far as a human is a as an american as a united states citizen and that right can will never be taken from me but but as a citizen of above i have a different home i have a different place that i'm going to something that it it that anoints me that's beyond the world right beyond this mortal reach beyond this uh beyond this cosmos see that's where we live beyond the world amen that's what our life should be that's exactly where god wants us to be beyond the storm above it all now brother dennis mentioned this in his prayer and i had this down as a scripture i wanted to read to you second peter chapter three brother dennis quoted just a small portion of second peter chapter three but i want to read the whole i want to read the whole chapter amen second peter chapter 3. now we can talk for the next 10 15 minutes and and hit highlights of things that we all know but bringing to our remembrance then what our beyond this is and and if you will even even we'll say after that after the storm after the storm that is affecting us that where we go to where what's happening to to this bride the second epistle beloved now i write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lusts in this now he puts a first to this but then he said first in the last days first in the last days they'll be scoffers walking after their own lusts trying to develop lead uh produce something from their own mind from their own lust it's their own desires it's their own feelings well this is what i want to happen this is what i think should happen but the truth of it is in the grand scheme of thing in humanity they may be right you got conservatives and liberals and they have completely poor opposites of what their ideals are of what this nation should be like but our polar opposite even beyond that is the whole thing is satan's eating right and our world has no resemblance to this world at all because what it really should be is not after what i think it should be or what my opinion of it should be or what i would like for it to be of my humanity but what does the word say what does jesus say what does his word say that's all that matters that's all that it boils down to is all that it matters is is that word what christ what the mind of christ what he wants for it that that's that's the whole thing see all these cities and buildings and stuff we've become so uh citified around to see all these huge cities everywhere everybody's moved into the cities used to be all spread out and people uh enjoyed the land and lived on the land now everybody's just coming in and conglomerate one of these big huge cities everywhere you just got a big pocket of people here and a big pocket of people there and a big pocket of people there you got all this land people there where nobody hardly lives because everybody wants to be in these big huge pockets these big cities and god never did ordain those cities began to be built by cain not by god's lineage not by adam not by seth cities were being were built or built off the lineage of of cain right that's when they built cities cess lineage adam gods is when they begin to call on the name of the lord that's his lineage what does that do well calling on him leads us into his path right what does he want we know this was created by him and for him or if it's created for him and he's a creator of it then lord what would you want what would you want my part of it here to be right because that's what matters to me what is my part of it what is your part of it that's what you ask the lord every day what is my part of it here today lord what do you want me to do today where would you send me the people scoffers walking after their own lust saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was then that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same water kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men so we know what's going to happen to the current world right he's telling us what happened to the andaluvian world he's telling us what's going to be the end result of this world so what is the result it's to be reserved unto fire against the day of judgment to judge and uh and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day as the lord is a thousand years a thousand years is one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day and and merciful as it is amen merciful as it is seeing then uh excuse me but the day of the lord will not come but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness for for if the sinner and the ungodly if the righteous scarcely be saved what are the sin and ungodly appear the righteous scarcely be saved amen looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens amen there we go amen that's that's where we're going beyond this after this we look for new heavens and new earth amen amen that's what we're looking for amen praise the lord wherein dwelleth righteousness so we can't be talking about here because there's no righteousness here right it's outside the bride anyway there's no righteousness in the world there's no righteousness in this world system cosmos there's no righteousness to it says obviously talk about a new heaven and a new earth a new place where righteousness is wherefore beloved seeing that we look for such things be diligent that you may be found in of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which we uh uh in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest and they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen amen praise the lord so he talked about what the andaluvian world talked about the current world and then he talked about what we're looking forward to as we still living in this world right beyond the storm looking at what we know scripturally a new heavens and a new earth amen well how are we going to be able to live in that new heaven and new earth well we got to have a new body right we got we got to be new people we got to be new creations new creatures in christ jesus first corinthians 15 51 says behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed it can't be talking about the unbeliever because the unbelievers aren't going to be changed that's right he's talking about all well what is that all believer all christian all spirit filled we shall all be changed in the moment and twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall say the sound the dead in christ shall rise incorruptible and shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption in this mortal must put on immortality beyond beyond friend amen amen so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption this mortal has should put on immortality this shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory oh death where is thy steam o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin the strength of the sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the glory victory through our lord jesus christ amen amen that's where we stand amen beyond the storm in the in the presence of jesus christ in the victory of jesus christ who giveth us that victory who has made us more than conquerors that loved us amen first thessalonians 4 we know the bible says trump of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first and we shall all gather together to meet him in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen and then he says comfort one another with these words amen comfort you one another with these words look at this i'm going to read this is it's a story brother branham tells you've heard the story about when he's on uh hurricane mountain i believe if i remember it's called colorado he that is in you i could be that i could have those details mixed up but the story he that is he tells the story several places but i wanted to read it to you amen he that is in you how many experiences have i had i pointed out out to the brothers brother palmer in them places where the eagle you know i've seen them rise up that day you know that the places where it all taken place in there it's a temporal a temperamental thing to me and there i've had so many great experiences with my lord up in those mountains so you just can't go there without seeing him he's just everywhere amen i set there then the sleet started the wind twisting like that and i said well i know the way down but i better get off of here right now so i looked down i couldn't even see the bottoms no more than clouds just whirling twisting sneak sleep blowing there it was the blizzard that was forecast for several days that a big blizzard was coming brother tom here not this tom tom simpson brother tom here brother tom simpson coming down from canada heard the forecast and he was advised not to go down to this part of the country because the forecast said it's going to be a blizzard where your brother tommy says i think that he said the blizzard was coming everybody had done set in for it well i put my gun under my shirt like this my red shirt like walking down the mountain i started i got about a half a mile from the saddle and oh my then big drops of snow like that wind twisting up in the mountain blowing i couldn't see the bottom no more i could see about 20 feet maybe 30 in front of me i know to come right down to this little what we call a little hog back little ridge should come off the creek and then i know to follow the creek and where to go if it got real bad and so then i started down and got about half the way down there was something said to me just as plain as you hear me stop and go back well i thought what was i thinking about maybe it's just my mind and i couldn't i couldn't mix it up another step forward david had fixed me a sandwich that morning and i tried i think he tried to even uh even with me for fixing his dad one one time of onion and honey ever had an onion honey salad i haven't either i don't plan to i guess if you're hungry and that's what you got that's what you do i've had onion and tomato marinated but never onion honey that's that's a new one that's all we had he said so he fixed me a baloney and i don't know what it was wrapped in there had it in my shirt a dunk on wet through my shirt i thought i'll just stop and eat this and it'll be all right then so i pulled out the sandwich about 10 o'clock and i started eating the sandwich and as i eat the sandwich i thought now i'll be all right and i started to move on but something said go back where you came from now again defying all logic defying all sensibility obeying a voice obeying a voice that's beyond our human understanding to go back into the teeth of the storm where he's trying to get out of right trying to come away from there on the boat screaming let's get out of this place and they see jesus coming in this and and peter decides he wants to get into the middle of the storm go right in where jesus is well the voice told brother branham go back well there's got to be a purpose to that what would be the purpose of of calling a prophet of god to go right back into the storm that was that would have killed him i mean legitimately i mean he talks about here we'll get into it just in the half hour or so it's no three inches i mean it's pouring snow a blizzard bring two three four five six feet of snow i mean he's a dead man to go back up there but the voice said go back right yeah that's living beyond the storm you're in the storm he's in the middle of the storm he said he's soaking wet he has to cover his gun to keep it from getting all wet and he's in the storm but he's living beyond the storm because the voice comes go back where you come from go back to that storm a half mile or more back up in the mountain into the dark timber where you can hardly see as far as that uh organ uh i don't know organ piano he's trying to make a comparison there which is kind of a hard one for us to do today but if you've been to the branham tabernacle you see the pulpit in the organ i had five feet six feet we'll say he said uh you could hardly see as far as that organ five six feet but i'm going to be an old man and i've been a christian now 35 years and i know no matter what how ridiculous it seems the mind of the lord do what the lord says yes amen that's that's the whole point of today's service amen living beyond this storm that's the whole point living beyond the storm is doing what jesus said living by the dictates of his word and if he speaks something to you personally amen do what the lord says and i turned and went back to the saddle feeling my way back all the sleep getting harder and harder getting darker and darker i sit down there and just put my coat up like this or my shirt over the scope again sit down i thought what am i doing here why would i come back up here and any normal human thinking person would think that any of us would if any of us even started going back up there but it'd have to be by faith amen and just by faith just like you think well why would peter call crawl off the bow of that boat because he had faith to believe he could walk to jesus right brother man i've heard that voice before that voice had talked to him many many many times and he knew when that voice spoke but you know how your mind is you know how the devil is the devil's in the middle of the storm too friend you have to understand the devil's in the middle of that storm too and he'll tell you all kinds of things to get you out away from what god's trying to get you to do right amen he said what am i doing up here i just have i just waited a few minutes and i started to get up again and just as plain as i'd ever want to hear a voice said i am the creator of heaven and earth i make the winds and the rain he said i took off my hat amen he said i said great jehovah is that you he said i was the one who made the winds to cease upon the sea amen i was the one who made the waves go down i created heaven and earth was not i the one that told you to speak those squirrels and they come into existence i am god now when a voice speaks to you listen now very closely now when a voice speaks to you watch the scripture if it's not scriptural leave it alone that's right he said i don't care how plain it is or what it says you stay away from it right amen that's that's the that's the guidewire that's the guideline is it scriptural right he said if it's not in the scripture leave it alone i said yes lord he said speak to those winds and storm and it'll go away now this bible lays before me which my life is in that i raised up i said i do not doubt your voice lord i said clouds snow rain sleet i rescind you your coming in the name of jesus christ go to your places and i said and i said that the sun must come out immediately and shine for four days till our brother's hunting trip is over and i'll leave with my brethren amen praise the lord i know a brother that was there at the time he's passed on since but he was a good brother good friend we stayed at their uh uh well in their yard in a travel trailer when we first moved to tucson arizona he still had the truck and camper that he used when he went up there hunting at this time with brother branham amen and he told me exactly the story too and he said now we brothers said all come down he said and they are all thinking man brother branham is just doomed up there because the whole mountain's just covered in the wind and snow and he's just pouring and it's piling up and then he said all of a sudden it just stopped the clouds went this way and this way and the sun came out and was out for four days solid amen amen now those brothers are going away and as those brothers go away others coughers come up right scoffers rise up and say oh this didn't happen oh this didn't happen that way oh look what brother branham said he contradicts himself amen scoffers i believe what he said even if i didn't have the eyewitness that i know personally i talked to was there and told me and he was very graphic and he was very emotional about it too he said it did exactly what brother brown said amen i was just gushing with the the wind was just gushing whoosh like that it started going whoosh whoosh and then it went few few and it stopped i can't uh give the graphics like brethren can but i try i stood still real still my brother uh up there and wondering what was happening the sleet rain stopped there come a wind whirling down through the mountains lifted up the clouds and one and one went this way east north west south and within a few minutes the sun was shining nice and warm he said that's the truth and god knows it's the truth i stood there just looking around my hat off i got numb all over i thought the very god of creation is all in his hands what he's telling me he said i picked up my gun wiped off the scope went and walked back down the hill and something said to me why don't you just stroll with me through this wilderness for a while amen just walk with me see god has a purpose yes god has a reason he'll stop all of nature just to perform what he wants to be done amen amen a blizzard that was gonna that would have destroyed them all stopped right there amen all of a sudden he said walk with me i said lord with all my heart that would be one of the greatest things i could do would be to walk with you so i put my gun on my shoulder i started walking through that never an axe laid to a tree in that virgin timber walking through there as i did i walked along down the game trails the goes on and tell the story but it's getting a little long if you want to go back and read it for yourself if you'd like to but i want to get to the end of this here he says even to uh when i come out of the mountains i stopped at filling stations and i said beautiful day three days later it never rained in that part of the country until the four days was over the sun shined every day is that right brethren he says they said amen not a cloud in the sky and i come out of the filling station i said sure beautiful day man says yes it is i said been awful dry said it the man said it's a strange thing the attendant said you know they told us it was going to be a great big glitch and all of a sudden it just stopped i come all down on new mexico line billy my uh and i my son went into a little place there that got some uh this morning left i said sure pretty day yes it is i said look uh look like you've been pretty dry yes it's been i said are you from here said no i'm from wisconsin somewhere said i've been out here about 20 years so i guess you could call it home i said uh you're a native then i guess so i said yes sir i said like looks like it's been awful dusty said you know the man said now the the attendant now god man says you know the strangest thing happened so we had a forecast that we was going to get a big blizzard a lot of snow and it actually started and then it just quit brother brown says you don't say you don't say just modest humble amen could have been somebody said well i did that right i called that to stop i called the storm to stop and cease you know that's what a lot of people try to do today yes self-promotion oh i'm the one that did i'm the one they call that what are they doing they're building themselves a platform they're not building jesus one they're leading people to themselves not to jesus but that wasn't brother branham brother branson said oh you don't say so really is that exactly how it happened amen but it happened exactly the way he said it would now the difference here you say well that's the example that was left what did brother branham do he just followed the
