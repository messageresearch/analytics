[10:58] God, again, of this beautiful day, of
[11:00] this life that you give, Lord, of the
[11:02] time that we have on this earth, Lord,
[11:04] just to live for you, God. We don't so
[11:07] many times we seem to take for granted,
[11:09] Lord, this life. We take for granted the
[11:12] time that we have here, Lord. And God,
[11:14] what you've given and done for us, Lord.
[11:16] But God, let us not take grant for
[11:18] granted one single moment that we have

[11:25] Lord, to serve you, to live for you, to
[11:28] witness about you, to worship you, God,
[11:30] to give you all the glory, honor, and

[11:34] &gt;&gt; Father, we in ourselves are nothing. We

[11:41] place.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[11:42] &gt;&gt; God. We are an unworthy group of people,
[11:44] Lord. But it's not our worthiness that
[11:47] we're uh depending upon, Lord. It's
[11:49] yours.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; It's your righteousness. It's your
[11:52] worthiness, Lord. And God, through that
[11:54] union with you, Lord, we have become as
[11:57] righteous as you are.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you, Father, for those
[12:00] that have come.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; We pray for those who may not be able to
[12:03] make it for whatever reason. Pray you
[12:05] bless those who may be streaming today.
[12:07] And we rebuke every demonic spirit that
[12:10] would try to hurt, hinder, infiltrate
[12:11] this service in any way that you, Lord
[12:14] Jesus, give the glory, honor, and praise
[12:16] for all that is said and done here
[12:18] today. We commit it to you now, Lord.

[26:08] Amen. God bless you today. Amen. Welcome
[26:11] to the house of the Lord.
[26:14] Amen. I have a couple prayer requests to
[26:16] bring your attention today.
[26:18] Uh, sister Sharia text me and said that
[26:21] her and Alice weren't feeling well
[26:23] today, but so thankful and glad to have
[26:24] brother Art Gabriel with us. Had you
[26:26] back doing brother?
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Good. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; You know your little son came up here
[26:32] the other day and we had prayer and
[26:34] yours dead. Did he tell you?
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; I believe from that moment, Amen. the
[26:40] Lord was going to touch you in this
[26:41] little faith there.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. Glory to God.
[26:45] Amen. So, let's remember Shariah Alice
[26:47] in prayer this morning home not feeling
[26:50] well. Uh, I did not hear from sister
[26:52] Julie yesterday. I'm not sure she hadn't
[26:55] been feeling well. I know that, but
[26:56] please remember her in prayer. I want to
[26:58] continue to remember Pats in prayer.
[27:00] Amen. And u brother Pat informed me that
[27:03] they are not moving. They're going to
[27:05] stay at their place and they're getting
[27:07] some projects done and doing what they
[27:09] can. It's still rough on them getting
[27:11] around. They still have a difficult
[27:13] time, but uh please remember them in
[27:15] prayer. They're so very thankful to have
[27:16] church and we're thankful to be able to
[27:19] have the streaming that they can be a
[27:20] part of. So, amen. We love and
[27:22] appreciate brother and sister Pat this
[27:24] morning. Miss them so very much when
[27:26] they're not here. Amen. But so glad and
[27:29] happy to have brother Danny back with
[27:30] us. Amen. Thankful the Lord blessed him
[27:33] and feeling better and able to get
[27:35] around. Amen. So,
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I guess it's I've never
[27:39] experienced, but I guess it can't just
[27:41] be a walk in the park to have all your
[27:42] toes removed off a foot. Uh but so very
[27:46] thankful the Lord spared his life. He
[27:47] was thankful. Text me. I remember. Amen.
[27:50] Just
[27:50] &gt;&gt; just a little bit longer and the doctor
[27:53] said he may be dead. So uh very thankful
[27:56] the Lord spared his life and he's back
[27:58] with us again today. So thankful for
[27:59] that. Amen. Good to have brother Ze with
[28:01] us.
[28:02] Brother Zeph uh may be aware of before
[28:05] service today that his wife uh was in
[28:08] need of prayer. Her name is Martha.
[28:10] Amen. So we definitely want to uphold
[28:12] her name in prayer special uh this
[28:15] morning and just trust the Lord is uh
[28:18] mindful from South Africa to Tucson,
[28:21] Arizona.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's please remember Martha in
[28:25] prayer as well. Also my wife informed me
[28:27] that the zincas don't normally come till
[28:29] January. For some reason, I thought they
[28:31] came a little before that, but uh
[28:33] anyway, we still love them, miss them
[28:35] when they're not here. So, please
[28:36] continue to remember them in prayer uh
[28:39] as they're not here this morning. Sister
[28:41] Sheileas said she'd be here today. I
[28:43] haven't got a text from her. I'm
[28:44] assuming she's on her way. So, uh Lord,
[28:46] just bless and uh be with her this
[28:48] morning. Anyone have a a request on your
[28:52] heart, something you'd like to make
[28:53] known to the church this morning?
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sister will be going to see
[29:01] and she found out that her
[29:12] &gt;&gt; doesn't sound good.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Amanda,
[29:21] Amanda's going in surgery Tuesday,
[29:23] right? The 18th, you said.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; No, she's going to see the surgeon.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; See the surgeon on Tuesday.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So remember I said
[29:36] seem I guess found out that her organs
[29:39] are connected together somehow. I don't
[29:41] know how that
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; So let's please remember her in prayer.
[29:48] I have a doctor appointment. Always
[29:51] appreciate your prayers. We always pray
[29:52] for one another.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Anyone else?
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother Dennis.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, my wife Leah, it's a testimony
[30:01] and a purpose. She went and saw the
[30:04] doctor this past Tuesday. They cleared
[30:06] her. She's doing fine from all those
[30:08] surgery. Uh, but she gets real tired and
[30:13] [clears throat] she's the type of person
[30:14] who likes to stay busy. And I tell her,
[30:16] "You're tired? Go rest." Sometimes
[30:18] she'll rest twice, take a nap twice a
[30:22] day.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; And um, there's some reason she gets
[30:25] tired easy. I I have my problem, but I
[30:29] don't get tired like she does.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; So, I'm real concerned about it. But the
[30:33] Lord knows one touch from him. It's all
[30:36] that matters.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[30:41] Anyone else remember brother Dennis's
[30:44] wife? They had brother Dennis in prayer
[30:46] with his foot still. Remember that.
[30:49] Anyone else have an unspoken request all
[30:53] of our hearts today? Let's stand to our
[30:55] feet if we could. Amen.
[30:58] Ask brother Dennis if you would take
[30:59] these seats to the Lord in prayer.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, it is once
[31:05] again a privilege to be in your house of
[31:08] worship. Your house of prayer, your
[31:11] house where your word is preached
[31:14] without compromise.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, God.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; The unadulterated
[31:18] word, the truth is brought forth in this
[31:22] little assembly.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Lord, my heart goes out
[31:26] to the people, the believers that are
[31:29] part of this congregation. As our pastor
[31:33] shared already,
[31:35] &gt;&gt; your presence is here because you said
[31:38] two or three are gathered. Thank you,
[31:40] Jesus. My name, I'll be in the midst.
[31:42] Hallelujah.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; I will meet you. I don't go by numbers.
[31:45] When there's at least two or three, I'M
[31:48] THERE. AND FATHER, WHAT IS IT WITH SOME
[31:51] PEOPLE that want to just abstain from
[31:55] receiving these blessings?
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, deal with their hearts.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; 10 hours late. The signs are upon us.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Your flashy red LIGHT IS MADE CLEAR. I'M
[32:08] COMING SOON for a bride that has made
[32:11] herself ready.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; And Lord, it's time to search our
[32:15] hearts. If there's any sin that easily
[32:19] beset us away from you, TAKE IT OUT OF
[32:22] US. It's not a situation where we say,
[32:25] "Lord, I I'm giving you my best." We can
[32:29] give him 99%
[32:31] AND STILL BE BOUND ON THE TRAIN OF HELL.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; OH, Lord Jesus, it took 1% that changed
[32:40] a a human race. And Lord, IT'S TIME TO
[32:45] TOTALLY COMMIT our hearts, our lives to
[32:48] you.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know, respect a person.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; You love all all of us the same.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you gave one person the Holy
[32:58] Ghost and obedience the to your word,
[33:02] you're obligated to do the same for the
[33:05] next person.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, it takes full commitment, full
[33:09] surrender. I wish this
[33:13] safe from the depths of our heart. I
[33:16] surrender all.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are needs this morning,
[33:20] Father.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; For thou art high priest that can be
[33:25] touched by the fillings of our
[33:27] infirmity.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; And by your stripes, we are healed.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Her need a healing touch. our sister
[33:36] Shariah and their her daughter and
[33:39] brother Art's daughter and father.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, u the PS that are just having a
[33:48] tough time getting around and just just
[33:52] relying totally on you for
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, God bless them. And uh Amanda
[34:00] going to see a surgeon. Lord Jesus,
[34:02] &gt;&gt; we just believe the best
[34:05] &gt;&gt; AS YOU TOLD JOSHUA that so strongly
[34:08] speaks to my heart. Joshua, the land is
[34:11] yours.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; GO POSSESS IT. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
[34:15] EASY.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a picnic.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; It's not going TO BE A WALK IN THE PARK.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; YOU GO POSSESS IT.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; You'll have enemies that'll try to
[34:26] defeat you. THEY'LL BE STRONG, BUT
[34:29] YOU'RE GREATER cuz I'm with you.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; LORD, WE POSSESS FEELING for each and
[34:35] one that needs a touch from you, Father.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Grant it Jesus.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we stand by your word. I just
[34:43] read in Jeremiah
[34:46] where you told the people, "If you seek
[34:48] me with all my heart, I will be found."
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Yes.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a coincidence, but Father
[34:57] Jeremiah had uh the priest Zephaniah
[35:01] speak those words to the people.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. And we have a Zephaniah this
[35:07] morning.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, a man of God, stand for your word.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I'm going to close with this
[35:15] in my prayer.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, this is the greatest message
[35:19] [music]
[35:20] you have sent at any time. Even you,
[35:23] Lord, you couldn't preach the revelation
[35:26] of the seal.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; You couldn't preach all these mysteries
[35:31] could it wasn't time. [music]
[35:33] &gt;&gt; And Lord, let us not take [singing]
[35:35] advantage cuz you're coming for a bride
[35:38] without spot and blemish. A bride that's
[35:41] walking
[35:43] precepts in line with your word. Oh
[35:47] Lord, we want to be that bride where you
[35:50] can totally reflect yourself in us.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Bless our brother, father. He's come a
[35:54] long way. Use them to speak
[35:57] &gt;&gt; to us. It's a brother Brown said one
[36:00] time, one word from you, Father, will be
[36:03] more to us than all the words we can put
[36:06] together. Amen. This morning, Father, in
[36:09] your name, touch my pastor. He had a
[36:12] tough week. I conceal [music] it,
[36:14] Father. Touch and give him strength.
[36:16] Then give him the time to recover and
[36:18] rest. He's your servant. Use him
[36:21] continually wherever he goes, especially
[36:24] with this job with these men that are
[36:26] not believers to be a written epistle,
[36:29] Father, to be a B billboard for you.
[36:32] Thank you, God. In your name we pray.
[36:34] Let us all be billboards, Father. In
[36:37] your name we pray, name of the Lord
[36:38] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You can be
[36:42] seated if you'd like.

[36:57] before about one of the guys on our
[36:59] crew.

[37:03] me, actually. He's 60. I guess he's
[37:06] getting ready to be 63 now. Uh
[37:09] a while back, um I mentioned to you a
[37:14] couple years ago actually. He had he
[37:16] quit drinking whiskey, liquor. Uh he got
[37:21] to just like drinking beer and he quit
[37:23] drinking beer so he doesn't drink beer
[37:26] anymore.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; He started getting a bottle of wine
[37:29] before at the beginning of the week and
[37:31] he'd have a little glass of wine every
[37:33] night. Now he's quit drinking wine at
[37:36] night. him and his wife started going
[37:38] back to church
[37:40] &gt;&gt; and involved in their church as much as
[37:42] he can go because he's gone every other
[37:44] Sunday and they're back going to church
[37:46] again.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I met him, he hadn't been to
[37:51] church in years. And uh just like the
[37:54] rest of basically and uh by the grace of
[37:57] God, you never know just what little

[44:32] Lord, [singing] I believe. [music]
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have a song that maybe we
[44:40] could sing. I noticed that it's on

[44:46] when the roll is called. Somebody help
[44:49] me start that one.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; That is a song that I like so much. You
[44:53] know, when I hear my people singing that
[44:55] song back home, we sing it in Zulu, we
[44:59] sing it in English, I always think, man,
[45:02] that must be a message to the believers
[45:05] overseas. Yes. that we promise
[45:08] &gt;&gt; that when that roll is called up,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; We will be there.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Could we sing that one? Somebody studied
[45:16] for me. When the trumpet of the Lord
[45:18] shall sound number 87.

[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:23] When [music] the [singing] trump
[45:30] and the morning [bell]
[45:32] [music]
[45:35] when the savior shall gather over on the
[45:41] [music and singing]
[45:42] fall, I'll be there when the
[45:47] [music]
[45:48] [singing]
[45:49] All
[45:52] the

[46:13] in Christ arise and the [music] glory
[46:16] [singing] of his resurrection

[46:42] When the [music] roll
[46:45] is falling, [singing]
[46:49] when the is [bell]
[46:52] [music]
[46:57] [music]
[46:57] from the dawn to s

[47:06] [music]
[47:07] [singing]
[47:10] is done and the world is under [music]
[47:15] higher
[47:16] [singing]
[47:18] [music]
[47:22] [singing]
[47:25] [music]
[47:30] [music and singing]
[47:35] is [music and singing]
[47:37] all Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; I just want to greet the church in the
[47:53] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:56] I am greeting even those that are not at
[47:58] church today may be streaming. Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Back home. I have a brother in South
[48:04] Africa by the name of Moses. He's in the
[48:08] city Johannesburg.
[48:09] He said to me, just tell me what church
[48:11] you going to be in.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; I want to follow you.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; I said to him, "No, you must follow the
[48:17] Lord, not me."
[48:19] &gt;&gt; But I I gave him know as the pastor this
[48:21] morning, the name of the church, the
[48:23] website, and that I gave it to him.
[48:26] Perhaps they all saw streaming in this
[48:29] morning.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad to be with you. I hope
[48:34] I have something to say that will
[48:36] encourage the believers.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing greetings from the church
[48:42] back home. We in our local church we
[48:47] have the numbers say 60 plus. We 60 plus
[48:53] and we have another satellite group in
[48:57] we are a thousand kilometers out of Cape
[49:00] Town
[49:01] &gt;&gt; out in the remote area where there's no
[49:04] running water. At least we do have
[49:07] electricity now only now
[49:10] &gt;&gt; and sometimes I love to stream the
[49:13] churches I mean the services here but I
[49:17] wouldn't I couldn't because of the
[49:20] coverage the network the the the what do
[49:24] you call it? Yeah. So I sometimes can
[49:28] sometimes I cannot and then but I'm glad
[49:31] to be back here to see you again. I was
[49:34] here.
[49:36] about three years ago. Three, four
[49:37] years. 2023 I think it was
[49:40] &gt;&gt; when I was over here. Amen.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And I I felt the love when you welcome
[49:46] here to come and share the little that I
[49:48] could from the word of God.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So the believers back home are sending
[49:52] their greetings. I just spoken to my
[49:54] wife as the pastor alluded before we
[49:57] started the service. She sends her cards
[50:00] as well. Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:05] at at lovers to
[50:09] perhaps go into the word shortly. Um
[50:13] [clears throat]
[50:14] I'm trying to remember a few things that
[50:16] I wanted to say there. Oh maybe before I
[50:20] forget this one. The last time I was
[50:22] here,
[50:25] some believers gave me presents. They
[50:27] gave me what they could give me. And uh
[50:31] I was really
[50:34] so thankful to receive what they gave
[50:38] me. But there's a a big one, a great
[50:42] gift that was given to me from this
[50:44] church last time.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Do you know do you know by whom? By
[50:49] brother Joel.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And I forgot even his name when I was
[50:54] reporting back home and I said this
[50:56] brother
[50:57] &gt;&gt; his name is Joshua. I said his name is
[50:59] Joshua. Only find out it wasn't Joshua.
[51:02] I don't know how old was he when I was
[51:04] here three years ago.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; 10.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; He was 10.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He would be now 13, 14 now.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; 12
[51:16] &gt;&gt; 12.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. That brother did
[51:20] &gt;&gt; a great thing to me when I left this
[51:23] church last time. I received a letter
[51:26] from him and the letter is here with me.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Written with his own handwriting
[51:34] and it reads maybe brother read it for
[51:36] us please.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. He wrote me this letter that
[51:40] brother.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; It just says thank you for coming from
[51:43] Joel.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; You know that really touched my heart
[51:48] when the brother he couldn't have no
[51:50] money on him nothing to give but he gave
[51:53] me love.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what I took this thing
[51:56] and it was such a teaching to our church
[51:58] back home
[51:59] &gt;&gt; that a little brother could have done
[52:01] this.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Just to show how welcome I was in this
[52:05] church.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming from joy.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Um
[52:13] yeah, if I forget some of the things,
[52:16] God I believe God will
[52:19] I want to read from the book of
[52:22] John.
[52:24] Let's read a portion of scripture just
[52:27] one verse perhaps from the book of John
[52:30] chapter 13 and I'll read verse 34 and I
[52:34] have other
[52:37] few scriptures that I might I might not
[52:41] that I will read. Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; But I have some other few scriptures
[52:45] that I will read. Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand if we can before we
[52:51] read the scripture.
[52:53] We can stand to our feet if we can and
[52:57] pray.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we are about to open this
[53:02] holy book. Oh Lord God, we learned from
[53:05] your prophet Lord
[53:06] &gt;&gt; that each and every man that's got two
[53:09] hands would be able to open the pages of
[53:12] this book. Lord God,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; but only thy spirit which is thyself
[53:17] Lord would be able to unveil Lord and
[53:21] reveal and speak Lord the things that
[53:24] are contained in the holy book of Lord
[53:26] Jesus.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; We come before you Lord. We bow our
[53:30] hearts Lord our heads and our everything
[53:33] Lord
[53:34] &gt;&gt; we ask you Lord to do what you said you
[53:37] would do Lord. Each time we open the
[53:39] book, you speak to us through this book.
[53:42] Lord,
[53:43] &gt;&gt; our prophet says, "Oh Lord, God, this is
[53:45] a love letter to your bride."
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; We know, Lord, that you love each and
[53:50] every one of us this morning. Lord,
[53:52] &gt;&gt; we thank you, Lord, for welcoming us,
[53:54] Lord, and taking this precious word,
[53:57] Lord, and bringing to us, oh Lord God.
[54:01] It's it is said, Lord, you are a great
[54:03] eagle, Lord,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; and who are the eagllets, oh God.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you feed your igllets Lord
[54:10] from your mouth to our mouth. Oh Lord
[54:13] God,
[54:14] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord Jesus. Speak to us now
[54:15] Lord as we read the word in the name of
[54:18] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Let us read from as I said the book of
[54:24] John chapter
[54:27] 13
[54:29] and we read verse 34.
[54:34] Let us read. A new commandment I give
[54:38] unto you, that ye love one another as I
[54:42] have loved you.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; That he also love one another.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; By this shall all men know that ye are
[54:52] my disciples if you love one another.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[55:00] Um maybe I will talk although it will
[55:05] not seem that is what I'm talking on but
[55:10] I'd like to say a little message that I
[55:13] will bring a new commandment
[55:17] &gt;&gt; the Lord says
[55:18] &gt;&gt; amen
[55:18] &gt;&gt; a new commandment I give unto you.
[55:21] on that new commandment. Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Now,
[55:27] brothers and sisters,
[55:29] before we get to
[55:33] this new commandment
[55:36] in a little
[55:38] deeper manner, let us also read from
[55:43] the book of Hebrews.
[55:49] Let's go to the book of Hebrews, chapter
[55:52] 6,
[55:53] and just read
[55:56] the first three verses of the book of
[55:59] Hebrews.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; I'm reading from verse one. Therefore,
[56:05] living the principles of the doctrine of
[56:07] Christ,
[56:09] let us go on unto perfection.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. not laying again the foundations
[56:16] of repentance from dead works and of
[56:20] faith toward God, of the doctrine of
[56:23] baptisms and laying on of hands and of
[56:26] resurrection of the dead and of eternal
[56:30] judgment.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; And this will we do if God permit.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So here I'm just uh laying a
[56:41] foundation to talk about getting to this
[56:46] what is called in the Bible a new
[56:48] commandment.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And we know the new commandment is love.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the talking about
[56:55] &gt;&gt; brotherham even says it's the 11th
[56:58] commandment.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; We know there were 10. When I came in
[57:02] there and I saw on the boat right here,
[57:05] "Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not
[57:07] commit adultery. Thou shalt not. And I
[57:09] thought, yeah,
[57:11] &gt;&gt; this is what I'm going to speak on
[57:12] anyway.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; So now, and the Lord Jesus comes around
[57:17] and says, I give you another
[57:18] commandment, a new one. Now,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; yes,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; that commandment is love,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; That you must love one another.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; We will grow a little bit into it. But
[57:29] now Paul in chapter six of this book of
[57:33] Hebrews says, "Therefore living the
[57:36] principles of doctrine of Christ, let us
[57:38] go on unto perfection."
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[57:40] &gt;&gt; you will find out that if we talk about
[57:42] going on unto perfection, it means we
[57:46] are growing. We are going on into this
[57:49] new commandment.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; We are growing on into being in that
[57:53] love, that perfect love.
[57:55] You you will know brothers and sisters
[57:57] that in the stat of a perfect man you
[58:00] have your first step being faith and you
[58:02] add to faith virtue from virtue you add
[58:06] you add you add until oh thank you
[58:08] brother [laughter]
[58:10] you add you add until you get to where I
[58:14] think the believers all Christians are
[58:18] at this moment in brotherly kindness.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brotherly kindness is where you
[58:23] know in one place in Cape Town the
[58:26] people don't that don't go to church at
[58:28] all that are not believers in in Christ
[58:31] were so amazed when they saw the
[58:33] believers there they said WHAT KIND OF
[58:34] CHURCH ARE YOU GOING to
[58:36] &gt;&gt; we see a difference in you people
[58:38] &gt;&gt; you are always together
[58:40] &gt;&gt; amen
[58:41] &gt;&gt; if we see you in a restaurant you are
[58:42] together in the streets you are together
[58:45] they said there's so much love among you
[58:48] &gt;&gt; right
[58:49] &gt;&gt; what is going on WHAT KIND OF CHURCH IS
[58:51] That
[58:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; And you see in the scripture say in the
[58:55] Lord Jesus says the people will know by
[58:58] this
[58:58] &gt;&gt; right
[58:59] &gt;&gt; that you are my children.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; If you have love one for another.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; And it means you have grown up. You've
[59:06] gone to where NOW YOU ARE IN that that
[59:10] 11th commandment that you are in that
[59:13] perfect love.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; And now when you are in this brotherly
[59:17] kindness where there is love in the
[59:19] church. Oh brother, sister, when we were
[59:22] praying for people that had requests
[59:24] this morning, I thought how wonderful.
[59:28] Our prophet teaches that God heals.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD IS A HEALER.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; YES.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES IN HIM.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; EVEN BEFORE HE WAS GOD. AMEN.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE was that selfexistent one,
[59:42] &gt;&gt; HE WAS ELOHIM.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE BEGINNING, ALL THOSE
[59:46] ATTRIBUTES WERE IN HIM. RIGHT.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; HE HAD THE attribute of being a healer.
[59:51] But brother Denny was not sick then.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; FOR HIM TO PROVE THAT HE WAS A HEALER,
[59:58] HE HAD TO HAVE BROTHER Denny sick
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; so THAT HE CAN PROVE I'M A HEALER.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE WERE LOST, WE WERE SINNERS IN
[1:00:06] the world. We didn't care.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; I hate to remember
[1:00:11] that one time I was not interested in
[1:00:14] reading the Bible.
[1:00:16] as a young young little thing if I could
[1:00:20] get a a
[1:00:22] just a page of the Bible I said no I'm
[1:00:25] not going to read this it made me think
[1:00:27] you know and you know but the Lord loved
[1:00:30] me so much even then
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I was NOT SAVED
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; HE WAS a savior
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; he had that attribute in him of being a
[1:00:39] savior
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; but if I wasn't lost how would we show
[1:00:45] how would he prove prove that he is a
[1:00:48] savior.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; He had to have me lost so that he can
[1:00:51] say he can prove himself that he is a
[1:00:54] savior.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So that I CAN BE THANKFUL AND SAID I
[1:00:57] THANK YOU LORD.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; I I will carry on. Now, brother Paul
[1:01:08] here says, "Therefore,
[1:01:11] living the principles of the doctrine of
[1:01:13] Christ,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; let us go on unto love."
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. unto
[1:01:21] that 11th commandment
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; unto the commandment that the Lord
[1:01:26] added, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:29] He says, "Now, not laying again the
[1:01:32] foundation of repentance
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; from the dead works and of faith toward
[1:01:39] God,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; right? of the doctrine of baptism and of
[1:01:43] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[1:01:46] of the dead and of eternal judgment.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; You might think that these are not
[1:01:54] important anymore.
[1:01:56] But that's not what the scripture is
[1:01:58] saying here.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul is encouraging us to grow a
[1:02:03] little bit.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Grow up a little bit.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But these are very important
[1:02:09] because in verse three he says and this
[1:02:12] will we do if God permits.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; now listen here
[1:02:18] brother and sister I I really want to
[1:02:21] continue until we get to where
[1:02:26] we see now that
[1:02:28] by God's grace
[1:02:31] we are getting into this perfect love.
[1:02:33] We're getting to this place
[1:02:36] now. [clears throat]
[1:02:38] I I will read a few quotes of brother
[1:02:41] Brennan about two or three of them.
[1:02:50] In the in the message spiritual amnesia
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; 640411
[1:02:59] I read uh paragraph 200
[1:03:03] here bra is talking to some person
[1:03:08] and this guy or lady or whoever it was
[1:03:11] says to him
[1:03:13] and he said them people why don't you
[1:03:16] teach them women how to
[1:03:20] to have great spiritual gifts
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and help people instead of trying to he
[1:03:27] said they regard you as a prophetam says
[1:03:31] I don't call myself a prophet
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; right
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; but this person says to him they regard
[1:03:36] you as their prophet
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; they will listen to you why don't you
[1:03:39] teach them
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; to have spiritual gifts great gifts and
[1:03:44] be a help to the people
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; instead of what he says
[1:03:52] h listen to this one instead of always
[1:03:56] condemning them.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:04:02] what what this person was calling
[1:04:04] condemnation to the people was not
[1:04:07] condemning the people.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; It was helping the people.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; it was setting up of the principles.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; They were in the beginning. You will
[1:04:17] hear what Raenham says here. But to the
[1:04:20] other person, HE THOUGHT HE WAS
[1:04:21] CONDEMNING THE PEOPLE.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; How couldam condemn the people because
[1:04:25] he loved the people so much.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He had that love of God.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't condemn nobody.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; But
[1:04:33] he didn't compromise when it came to the
[1:04:35] word.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; He brought the word as it is,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; In order to help me, in order to help
[1:04:40] you,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO HELP EVERYONE.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; SO to the other people, it was like
[1:04:45] condemning them. Why do you condemn
[1:04:47] them? Why do you con teach them great
[1:04:50] gifts? How to help people, how to be to
[1:04:53] have spiritual gifts, gifts, speak in
[1:04:55] tongues and do all those type of things.
[1:04:58] But now
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; listen to
[1:05:02] I want us to go to this condemnation.
[1:05:04] What they call condemnation here. This
[1:05:06] person called condemnation. How was
[1:05:10] condemning the people?
[1:05:19] Yes. Yes.
[1:05:23] You hear this one
[1:05:29] condemning them
[1:05:32] because
[1:05:33] brother Brennan was teaching them how to
[1:05:36] dress.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; You see, you know, he teaches you how to
[1:05:40] dress nicely. You know, he'll talk to
[1:05:42] you until you understand it
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; and tell you that being a man, you know,
[1:05:46] a believer, you cannot go around in your
[1:05:48] shorts
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; and show out your that's how he puts it,
[1:05:52] your dirtiness, [laughter]
[1:05:54] shows out his daddies. You can't do
[1:05:56] that. And he tells you that as a sister,
[1:05:59] you have to keep your hair long. You
[1:06:01] know, you you have to cut cut your hair.
[1:06:05] He tells you how to dress. Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; And that type of a thing. And he says he
[1:06:10] and brother it feels like condemnation
[1:06:13] sometimes. He would say
[1:06:16] he puts her under that's the shorts for
[1:06:21] a man and he says she puts his
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; right
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; you know he he his u
[1:06:30] long pants and that type of a thing. He
[1:06:32] says he tried to put everyone in his own
[1:06:35] little,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; you know, rightful place.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; let me put it that way. And he carries
[1:06:40] on and until
[1:06:43] you learn, he teaches you that you
[1:06:45] mustn't be late for church. He teaches
[1:06:47] you that you must help your pastor, help
[1:06:50] your neighbor. And he teaches all those
[1:06:53] kind of things. And the people ARE IN
[1:06:54] SUCH A HURRY. THEY SAY, "NO, YOU DELAY
[1:06:56] THEM.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Teach them the spiritual gifts. Teach
[1:06:59] them the the the great things. You delay
[1:07:01] them. You delay this bill. Brother
[1:07:03] Brennham says, listen to this one. In
[1:07:05] the same quote, he says,
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I said, how can I teach them algebra?
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; When they won't even learn their ABCs.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the ABCs is like in Hebrew they
[1:07:24] say it's alf b
[1:07:27] because the Hebrew letters start with an
[1:07:29] alf bait dallet kiml hey and it carries
[1:07:35] on you know that is the ABCs alf bait
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; so they they they must they must know
[1:07:41] they are they are ABCs first that's
[1:07:44] wheream was starting with the ABCs and
[1:07:48] as he get on with the ABCs he says
[1:07:51] You've GOT START TO START FROM THE
[1:07:53] BOTTOM.
[1:07:55] And now he comes very harsh. HE SAYS
[1:07:57] REPENT OR PERISH.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; He says now you can suit yourself if you
[1:08:02] want to repent or perish. He says Jesus
[1:08:05] Christ has thoroughly identified himself
[1:08:07] here
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; night after night. Brother
[1:08:12] where the Lord would heal the sick. The
[1:08:16] Lord would you know in descentment would
[1:08:20] tell you where's brother Peter?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I mean I love to hear the testimonies
[1:08:28] that you know where he talked to him and
[1:08:31] talk to him. But anyway
[1:08:34] the Lord was performing some marvelous
[1:08:38] works. the Lord each night he he was
[1:08:44] you know showing the people how great he
[1:08:48] is what marvelous works he did through
[1:08:51] the prophet
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; I tell you my brother and brother
[1:08:54] Brennham says now if you see that you
[1:08:56] have to repent if you don't repent you
[1:08:59] perish so night after night and uh
[1:09:05] it's just a few steps now and he says I
[1:09:08] got he's got plenty of time. Now that is
[1:09:11] where I say
[1:09:13] it's the principles
[1:09:16] where he tells you of repentance
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; from the dead works,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Where he tells you about baptisms.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Where he tells you about the laying on
[1:09:24] of hands.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; You know, and carries on like it's just
[1:09:28] the principles you still have to grow.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; But [clears throat]
[1:09:36] Lord help me here.
[1:09:38] You know what? When
[1:09:42] if anyone I know in this church in the
[1:09:46] inner message church
[1:09:49] the word of God
[1:09:51] in in its fullness is brought out,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:09:58] even the people that don't come to this
[1:10:00] church, they know that you do baptize in
[1:10:02] this church.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And many of them know that you you
[1:10:05] baptize differently.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Mhm. from how they baptize out there,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; We have people that will visit the
[1:10:13] church and will come to church and they
[1:10:15] will know everything. They will know
[1:10:17] that even if they want to force him or
[1:10:19] her to be baptized out there, he says,
[1:10:21] "No, no, I won't be baptized here. I
[1:10:23] KNOW WHERE I WANT TO GO." AMEN.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; IF I WANT TO get the right baptism.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Because the baptism that is given here
[1:10:29] is the only Christian baptism.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; AND THAT ONE IS in the name of the Lord
[1:10:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; That is why would say to the people, IF
[1:10:38] YOU'RE NOT BAPTIZED, BE BAPTIZED.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Some will would be young people that
[1:10:46] grew up in church. Some they don't make
[1:10:51] a move.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; They just sit there. They just sitting
[1:10:54] for the sake of sitting, brother.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO BE BAPTIZED.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; And they know that they're going to be
[1:11:00] baptized. But brother Paul says what I
[1:11:04] like with him, he's not pointing to the
[1:11:07] next person and saying you.
[1:11:11] He says we
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; he includes himself.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; We must go on now. Go on unto
[1:11:17] perfection.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Living those principles of the
[1:11:20] laying on of hands, of the baptism, of
[1:11:23] the repentance from the dead works. Now
[1:11:25] we on the road. We want to grow. We want
[1:11:27] to to go up. Now brother, sister, he
[1:11:30] says they have learned first. They must
[1:11:33] learn their ABCs.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; I believe you've been through your ABCs.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You know when the church starts, you
[1:11:42] know how to press, you know,
[1:11:45] in order to to to show us that really
[1:11:50] brother could teach those ABCs.
[1:11:53] I don't know here in other places you
[1:11:56] find people that are not coming to
[1:11:58] church anymore. Some are just you know
[1:12:01] grown weak and uh some are in a
[1:12:04] so-called backslided backslitting
[1:12:06] condition right
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; but believe you me
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; those people though they don't come to
[1:12:15] church
[1:12:16] they have learned their ABC so well
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; that they conduct themselves like
[1:12:22] they're coming to church.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, in my area, there's young
[1:12:27] sisters.
[1:12:28] One of one that I know that is not
[1:12:32] coming to church anymore, but she
[1:12:35] dresses like he's coming to church. She
[1:12:37] doesn't cut her hair. She doesn't. A lot
[1:12:41] of things when you look at her, you
[1:12:43] think he was in church yesterday.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; It's good.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Only to find out he hasn't she hasn't
[1:12:47] been to church for 3 years or so.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; But she learned her ABC so well. Mhm.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; that no she she can't dress the way she
[1:12:56] used to before. She can't cut her hair.
[1:12:59] She she behaves. She she she she behaves
[1:13:03] herself. She will talk to you and say
[1:13:05] sister, brother, pastor and you know but
[1:13:09] then brother that is not enough.
[1:13:13] The Lord wants us as Paul puts it now to
[1:13:17] go on.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Go on.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Go on. Yeah.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Go on until WE WE REACH THAT perfect
[1:13:23] love.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Until until we reach that
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; that 11th commandment,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; that new commandment the Lord is talking
[1:13:31] about here. But I will I will show us
[1:13:34] here. Let us read from the same book of
[1:13:38] Hebrews
[1:13:41] as we grow.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brennan, I will read
[1:13:46] from the fifth chapter. You you can hold
[1:13:48] that. Brother says,
[1:13:54] "A person
[1:13:56] should have a purpose in life."
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:05] We should have a purpose in life. We
[1:14:06] shouldn't be just We don't know why we
[1:14:09] here.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; We don't know where we going,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; We don't know why you attend church.
[1:14:17] We We should know. Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Where we going?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; In the message
[1:14:24] faith is our victory of 1958
[1:14:29] 104
[1:14:32] paragraph 27
[1:14:34] says it reminds me of one time I don't
[1:14:38] like to say this word but he was just a
[1:14:42] bum
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; that came to the door.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; I like with the respect of brother
[1:14:47] Benham. People think was condemning them
[1:14:51] when he he doesn't even want to to to
[1:14:54] utter the word bum.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Referring to a person.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He respected people so much.
[1:15:02] But he says this gentleman came to his
[1:15:05] door.
[1:15:06] He says
[1:15:10] and he said could you give me a
[1:15:12] sandwich?
[1:15:14] I said certainly. Would you step in? And
[1:15:17] instead of making him a sandwich,
[1:15:20] Raenham goes an extra [clears throat]
[1:15:22] mile. He said, "I thought I'd fix him
[1:15:25] something to eat
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; and fix him up just about what I could
[1:15:30] get around in the place and sit him down
[1:15:33] to eat."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And while he was eating, I thought I
[1:15:37] would speak to him.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Seeing he was a traveler, I said, "Where
[1:15:42] did you come from?"
[1:15:45] And the answer he says he just shrug his
[1:15:49] shrugged his shoulders a little said no
[1:15:52] way.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And Bra said I said then where are you
[1:15:58] going?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And he stopped eating. He looked up at
[1:16:02] me and said no way.
[1:16:06] He looked around and swallowed a big
[1:16:07] bite and said, "Sir,
[1:16:10] just where my heads rest, that there is
[1:16:13] where I rest."
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Now, says,
[1:16:19] and
[1:16:21] I said, "How long have you been doing
[1:16:23] this?" He said, "Oh, some 20 years or
[1:16:27] more." He had no ambition
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; to better himself.
[1:16:32] Now that's just about the attitude of
[1:16:35] the people.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Says brother just what I call these
[1:16:39] people. He says he call them drifters,
[1:16:42] floaters.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; And the people who join the church is
[1:16:45] just about the same.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; They join the church.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; They don't take the word.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; They just drift us.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; He says, I've often thought of floating
[1:16:56] driftwood. A driftwood is just hands up
[1:16:59] in any kind of trash.
[1:17:02] But brother, thank God for you.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Thank God for you, sister, that you not
[1:17:09] just drifting about. You have a purpose
[1:17:12] in your heart.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; You have a purpose in life.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; If brother Paul says, "LET US GO ON."
[1:17:18] YOU WANT TO GO ON.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE TIME IS LATER THAN WE THINK.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; AND OUR LORD IS COMING BACK. HE'S NOT
[1:17:28] coming back for drifters. is not coming
[1:17:30] back for people that wants to sit and
[1:17:32] not carry on.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; WE MUST CARRY ON.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; WE MUST GET TO THAT LOVE.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; WE MUST GET TO THAT PLACE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE people look and say, but you
[1:17:42] are one of them.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; And you say to yourself, "No, I've been
[1:17:47] there only a week." But the person looks
[1:17:50] at you and say, "You're one of them."
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; He looks at you and he says, "YOU'RE ONE
[1:17:54] OF THEM. I CAN SEE YOU'RE ONE OF THEM."
[1:17:57] You know what, my brother, sister, We we
[1:17:59] we are growing. Let let me go back to
[1:18:01] the reading chapter 5 of the book of
[1:18:03] Hebrews. Bear with me. I'm reading a bit
[1:18:07] of lengthy scripture here. Maybe I'll
[1:18:11] just read from verse 5. Chapter 5 of the
[1:18:13] book of Hebrews.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Verse five. So also Christ glorified to
[1:18:18] himself, sorry, glorified not himself to
[1:18:22] be made high priest, but he that said
[1:18:26] unto him, Thou art my son, today I have
[1:18:30] begotten thee.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; As he saith also in another place, thou
[1:18:36] art a priest forever
[1:18:40] after the order of Melc.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Now we talking about Jesus.
[1:18:45] The one who we follow,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; the one who says,
[1:18:50] "I'm I'm giving you a new commandment."
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says, "Who in the days of
[1:18:58] his flesh,
[1:18:59] when he had offered up prayers and
[1:19:02] supplications,"
[1:19:04] that's what he was doing when he was in
[1:19:06] the flesh.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; He was offering prayers and
[1:19:10] supplications.
[1:19:12] I looked up that word supplication.
[1:19:16] It says
[1:19:18] a deep heartfelt
[1:19:21] humble prayer.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; So we as Christians maybe we we don't do
[1:19:28] that
[1:19:29] but our
[1:19:32] Lord
[1:19:34] when he was in the flesh like us that's
[1:19:37] what he did.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. He would be praying. The scripture
[1:19:43] doesn't shy saying
[1:19:48] with prayers and supplications with
[1:19:51] strong crying.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Now if your person cried in church, some
[1:19:58] people look around and think, "Hey,
[1:20:00] what's happening?
[1:20:02] What's she doing? What what's
[1:20:03] happening?"
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; But you know when that word of God move
[1:20:07] you in your heart
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sometimes tears just come out of
[1:20:10] your life
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; without you thinking our Lord.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; During his day in the flesh he prayed.
[1:20:17] You know, looking at some OF OUR SISTERS
[1:20:20] HERE, I think of that one time brother
[1:20:22] Brennham said after a a service, one of
[1:20:26] those olden day services, they tell me
[1:20:29] he was standing
[1:20:31] in the ver if I may put it that way. And
[1:20:34] the people were all over there,
[1:20:37] a big crowd. It was in the evening out
[1:20:41] in the open. And brother Brennham, the
[1:20:43] the the service was so good, brother.
[1:20:45] THEY WERE REJOICING AND CARRYING on and
[1:20:48] it was like the spirit of God was just
[1:20:50] upon each and every one of them and it
[1:20:54] saidam says do you know saints why this
[1:20:58] service is so good tonight
[1:21:01] and of course people didn't know
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; and says look that way
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; do you see that light there that little
[1:21:10] fire in the open out there and says
[1:21:14] there's an Indian woman there
[1:21:17] that's been there praying all night and
[1:21:20] that is why THIS SERVICE IS SO GOOD.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; ONE ONE PERSON
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; ONE MOTHER, ONE SISTER, ONE BELIEVER
[1:21:30] THAT TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO PRAY
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; LIKE OUR LORD DID.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Had his supplications strong crying and
[1:21:39] praying before the Lord. When this evil
[1:21:42] day is like this, we need people that
[1:21:45] will go BEFORE THE LORD AND DO THE SAME.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; AND PRAY.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:21:53] during his day in the flesh, strong
[1:21:56] crying and tears unto him that he was
[1:22:00] crying unto him that was able to save
[1:22:02] him from death, and was hurt in that he
[1:22:06] feared. Though he were a son, yet lent
[1:22:12] he obedience
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; by the things which he suffered.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, some of those things make us
[1:22:19] obedient.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Let's just appreciate the Lord.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Never mind what comes our way, what
[1:22:28] difficulties,
[1:22:30] what setbacks,
[1:22:32] we just press on.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; We pray. It reminds me a little sister
[1:22:37] that used to sing back home say come
[1:22:41] what may be from day to day my heavenly
[1:22:46] father watches over me.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; You see whatever comes.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:22:54] and being made perfect he became the
[1:22:56] author of eternal salvation. Our Lord
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; unto all them that obey him.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. called of God as a high
[1:23:06] priest after the order of
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Now let's read on [snorts] of whom we
[1:23:11] have many things to say. There's so much
[1:23:15] to say about our Lord.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; I'm glad today you don't have to pack a
[1:23:20] wall stack of message books with you.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; We've got our gadgets.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. You just switch on your gadget. You
[1:23:29] go and listen to the voice of the
[1:23:30] prophet.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. You just read for yourself,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just read for yourself.
[1:23:36] You feed you you feed you feed from the
[1:23:38] word of God.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And in my young age, you know, I didn't
[1:23:42] go to school like to be that's why I
[1:23:45] can't speak English.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I went as far as grade
[1:23:50] nine, I think.
[1:23:53] Then
[1:23:55] when they were teaching us basic uh um
[1:23:59] science,
[1:24:01] my teacher was teaching one day that
[1:24:04] when the air is warm, when it's hot, it
[1:24:07] increases.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; So now he brings to the class, he says,
[1:24:10] "Here's the apparatus. You've got a
[1:24:13] bottle, you've got a balloon, you've got
[1:24:16] fire.
[1:24:18] What will you do to show that air when
[1:24:21] it's it's it's hot it increases? Then I
[1:24:24] quickly thought I said okay you take the
[1:24:26] bottle you fit the balloon mouth onto
[1:24:30] the bottle then you hit the the bottle
[1:24:32] from behind and then the balloon will
[1:24:34] blast showing that now the air has
[1:24:36] increased and he was was so excited he
[1:24:39] said there it is man it's not like you
[1:24:41] know you spoon feeding spoon feeding all
[1:24:43] the time you must also think
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I mean even the message don't wait until
[1:24:49] you go get to church listen to the voice
[1:24:52] of the prophet
[1:24:53] Read THOSE BOOKS.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; READ. USE your gadget because if you
[1:24:58] don't use it, THE DEVIL USES IT ANYWAY.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You switch onto your Facebook the first
[1:25:03] thing you see without going to a cinema
[1:25:06] anymore. Sisters,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; it's not like in the olden days where
[1:25:10] you say I will stay home. I will switch.
[1:25:13] I will I won't have let me not switch. I
[1:25:15] won't have TV in my home. Today the
[1:25:18] devil wants to carry you to carry TV in
[1:25:21] your hand without knowing.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Without you knowing. You are switching.
[1:25:28] You trying to look in Facebook. Maybe
[1:25:30] you get a service. The first thing they
[1:25:32] show you
[1:25:34] filthy things.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Filthy things.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't use it, the devil's
[1:25:42] going to use it.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Right. But when you're so full of the
[1:25:46] spirit, you go past that thing. You go
[1:25:49] straight to the service where you were
[1:25:51] going. You are feeding into that. You
[1:25:53] you don't want spoon feeding all the
[1:25:55] time. The pastor must come and teach me.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; The deacons must come and encourage me
[1:26:01] to come to church. The you know what
[1:26:03] some people
[1:26:05] we say we are sheep.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; we ship correctly saying that we are
[1:26:10] sheep. But have you heard I don't know
[1:26:14] who who was ever on the farm.
[1:26:17] Have you had I have a few sheep back
[1:26:20] home. Last time when I was here in 2023,
[1:26:24] I had a couple of sheep, but when I got
[1:26:27] back home, they stole four of my sheep.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; my heart was so sore when they stole
[1:26:33] four of my sheep.
[1:26:37] But with those little lambs,
[1:26:40] you don't find a lamb telling you, "Now
[1:26:43] my owner, come and get me."
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; If you don't come and get me, I complain
[1:26:48] against you.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; But with us,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; the lamb, the lambs of the Lord, we
[1:26:53] complain a lot.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; We say they don't come. These deons
[1:26:57] never came to my home. They don't show
[1:26:59] me love. YOU REALIZE THAT YOU MUST BE a
[1:27:02] church. Why don't you go? I mean they
[1:27:05] will do their job but if if that is in
[1:27:08] your heart you go to the church come and
[1:27:10] knock at the door you get more blessings
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; don't wait for them to come and
[1:27:14] encourage you
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; you know I loved one time the person was
[1:27:18] saying some of us are just like
[1:27:21] wheelbarrow you know what a wheelbarrow
[1:27:23] is
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; wheelbarrow
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; he says some of us are just like
[1:27:28] wheelbarrows you don't push it stands
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; I love
[1:27:34] [laughter] And the little wheelbarrow
[1:27:36] has got two arms like this. It's waiting
[1:27:38] for you to push.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't put it st there.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to be a will.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Are you going to be one?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Are you going to be a wheelbarrow?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be one. He's waiting
[1:27:51] for somebody to push.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; The spirit FROM INSIDE MUST PUSH YOU, my
[1:27:56] brother.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now let let us let us uh read on.
[1:28:04] There's so much that has to be said of
[1:28:07] him that according to verse 11
[1:28:10] of chapter 5 in the book of Hebrews of
[1:28:13] whom we have many things to say in those
[1:28:16] days
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; and had to be uttered some of those
[1:28:21] things
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; seeing ye are dull of hearing.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:28] The scripture says sometimes we d of
[1:28:32] hearing
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; meaning that our ears are not sharp to
[1:28:38] catch that blessing
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; right
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; to catch that revelation.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; The Lord help us. We are dull of
[1:28:46] hearing. And another word,
[1:28:50] our ears are blunt. They're not sharp to
[1:28:55] catch the things of God.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; So he's got so much for us, but we must
[1:29:00] sharpen our ears.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; We must. And then he carries on. He
[1:29:04] says, "For when for the time you ought
[1:29:07] to be teachers,
[1:29:09] you have need that one teach you again."
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Which be the first principles of the
[1:29:17] oracles of God.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That is why he says, "Let's go on now."
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Let's not remain in the the basics in
[1:29:27] the principle. Let us go on.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; We've been long here.
[1:29:34] When I read that quote
[1:29:37] h about
[1:29:40] that person that was saying to him,
[1:29:43] you you condemn people. You you teach
[1:29:46] them the ABCs. I just want to look at it
[1:29:49] quickly and uh see what year it was.
[1:29:55] It was 1964
[1:29:58] and now we are how many years from then?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; So many
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; we are in 2025 now.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; So from that time on
[1:30:11] the Bible says we ought to be teachers
[1:30:14] now.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. to teach other people. You know,
[1:30:18] we've got teachers here. The the
[1:30:20] believers are teachers.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You can take a bishop from some
[1:30:25] denomination, from some church, and let
[1:30:27] him talk to Joel. Let him talk to a
[1:30:31] young sister here in the church
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; and that bishop or that whoever cardinal
[1:30:37] whatever he is, you will end up saying,
[1:30:39] "Hey, you show respect to me. You are
[1:30:41] too young to talk to me like that."
[1:30:44] Because the the people here they know
[1:30:45] the word.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; They know we are teachers.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says you should be teaching
[1:30:50] the others.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Come to church once your next door
[1:30:54] neighbor you could TEACH THEM.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; COMING TO CHURCH FOR A WEEK. YOU YOU YOU
[1:30:59] YOU
[1:31:01] ARE FIT TO BE A TEACHER. But he says
[1:31:04] instead of us being teachers now we we
[1:31:07] we are still
[1:31:09] let me read because we don't want to
[1:31:12] grow. We again
[1:31:15] want teach you again with the first
[1:31:18] principles of the oracles of God and I
[1:31:21] become such have need of milk
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; and not of strong meat
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; right
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; who wants to drink milk all the way
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; you cannot depend on the bottle all the
[1:31:32] way

[1:31:38] full meal

[1:31:59] anymore. We should be grown up. We We
[1:32:01] are growing into that love, THAT PERFECT
[1:32:03] LOVE. I WAS THINKING now where brother
[1:32:05] Brennham says God heals.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Going back to that one, he says God
[1:32:10] heals through prayer. Yes.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; God heals through music.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; HE'S SINGING. He says, "God will heal
[1:32:17] through love."

[1:33:32] 58104
[1:33:35] paragraph 43. He says, "I was reading
[1:33:40] old uncle Robertson's life story some
[1:33:43] time ago."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; And he says this brother Robinson,
[1:33:50] he says, "And he was such a great man
[1:33:53] and a loving man."
[1:33:56] A loving man. God help us.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; To be loving people.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; He says he was a man of faith.
[1:34:04] this old man and he got to hungering
[1:34:09] for the Holy Spirit.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; He became so hungry.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; For the Holy Spirit because the Bible
[1:34:15] taught it.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; She could have it.
[1:34:21] He can have it.
[1:34:24] I can have it.
[1:34:26] The little one can have the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. So this old man got so hungry for
[1:34:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:34] and it says that one day he was plowing
[1:34:37] corn on the farm there and he stopped
[1:34:40] his old mule, the one that he was using
[1:34:42] for a while plowing. The name of the m
[1:34:45] is Alex.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Says stop Alex one way and he got down
[1:34:51] in the cornrow.
[1:34:55] You know at work, at school, wherever
[1:34:59] you are,
[1:35:01] there's times when you feel like talking
[1:35:04] to your Lord.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. At a place of work where I used to
[1:35:08] work in Johannesburg years ago, my one
[1:35:11] Jewish brother by the name of Benjamin
[1:35:14] Goldberg, he believed the message and
[1:35:16] yet he was a Jew
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; and he said, "I'm double portioned
[1:35:20] because my name is Benjamin."
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; If I don't make it with the Jews, I'll
[1:35:24] make it in the rapture [laughter] with
[1:35:26] the Gentiles. So he believed the message
[1:35:28] and he would be he GET SO EXCITED AT
[1:35:31] WORK, HE WOULD SHOUT, "HALLELUJAH! AMEN.
[1:35:33] HALLELUJAH." AMEN.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Carrying on like that. And the other
[1:35:35] guys would ask the boss as what's wrong
[1:35:38] with you, Benny?
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'M A CHILD OF GOD."
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And the boss says, "The only thing with
[1:35:44] you, you two, yourself and Zeff think
[1:35:48] you are the only two children of God
[1:35:50] here." He says, "Yeah, we can all be
[1:35:53] children of God, but it depends.
[1:35:56] It might be the same mother, different
[1:35:59] fathers." Yeah, [laughter]
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; that's Benny to that guy, you know, he's
[1:36:04] talking about Abel and Cain.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; And you know, THERE'S TIME YOU YOU JUST
[1:36:12] FEEL, you know, now it's time to talk to
[1:36:14] the Lord. It's time to to praise him.
[1:36:17] And this old brother here, he stops Alex
[1:36:20] one side and got down into the cornrow,
[1:36:25] the cornrow and said, "GOD, IF YOU DON'T
[1:36:29] GIVE ME THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU COME BACK TO EARTH,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; YES,
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL FIND MY bones laying right
[1:36:37] here."
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I will pray.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Until I get that Holy Ghost.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Because why? Right.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; He's growing into that new commandment.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; HE'S GROWING INTO THAT LOVE.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He's forgetting those principles and
[1:36:53] that we will do if the Lord permit.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; We'll preach water baptism.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; We'll preach repentance.
[1:37:00] WE'LL LAY HANDS on the sick.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And they shall recover.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; By the way, WE JUST SAY A WORD AND A
[1:37:07] person recovers.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. I think there's a there's a story
[1:37:11] that I got just before I I came over and
[1:37:15] this at this neighborhood a man got
[1:37:18] sick, a man that I know. So I heard he
[1:37:21] was sick. He was in hospital and I went
[1:37:22] to visit this man. He he doesn't worship
[1:37:25] in the message. He's I'd say he's not a
[1:37:27] believer. So I went in his house to see
[1:37:31] him. And he says, "Hey, brother Seth, I
[1:37:35] I didn't know that death was so close to
[1:37:38] a person.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I literally died."
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; I said, "What happened?" He said, "I
[1:37:43] felt a pain in my chest and as I was
[1:37:46] trying to cough out, then there came out
[1:37:49] blood. I threw up blood and I I
[1:37:53] collapsed and I was gone."
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; And then I asked him what happened. He
[1:37:57] says your brother in the message brother
[1:38:00] Gideon over here I'm told he came OVER
[1:38:04] HE SAYS I WAS GONE I'M TOLD BROTHER
[1:38:07] GIDEON CAME OVER AND HE PRAYED OVER ME
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; AND HERE AM I
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I thought Jesus you can ask him I don't
[1:38:16] KNOW I WAS OUT I WAS GONE AND THAT
[1:38:18] BROTHER CAME OVER AND HE PRAYED OVER ME
[1:38:20] HERE am I
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I said praise God
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; a few days after that I went and saw
[1:38:27] Brother Gideon, you know what we do,
[1:38:29] brother? Just like you
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; jumping up and down.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Behind that pull pit. When I get to his
[1:38:35] home, my dear brother, we normally don't
[1:38:38] greet. If I greet I say hi and he says
[1:38:40] hi. We start talking the things of God.
[1:38:42] We start fellowshipping LIKE THAT AND I
[1:38:45] STAND UP. HE STANDS UP. I sit down. He
[1:38:47] stands up and we get on like that. And I
[1:38:49] said to him, "Brother, I hear that you
[1:38:53] went and prayed.
[1:38:55] Where did you hear that one from? Isaiah
[1:38:58] here from Lazarus.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; He just raised from the dead.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother, I don't know what
[1:39:04] happened there." He says, "I went in
[1:39:06] there and the man was gone. His wife was
[1:39:09] crying." And he says, "I tried to call."
[1:39:11] His name is Steedwell. He says, "We were
[1:39:14] calling him Steady, Steady, Steady.
[1:39:16] Steady was gone."
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; He couldn't say anything. So he said, "I
[1:39:19] decided I'm going to pray. I took off my
[1:39:22] hat." He says by the time I took off my
[1:39:24] head the wife thought now I had given up
[1:39:28] that now he's gone.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; She started you know crying or something
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; and then he says I prayed I prayed when
[1:39:39] I prayed as I was leaving him laying
[1:39:41] there on the bed says he started
[1:39:44] coughing.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And I said praise the Lord.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. No.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So this old brother said, "Lord,
[1:39:58] if you don't give me the Holy Spirit
[1:40:01] when you come back to the earth,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; you'll find my bones laying right here."
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Says, "That's having purpose in heart,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; That's really getting to business."
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; When you get that kind of a purpose in
[1:40:15] your heart, God is going to open the
[1:40:18] windows of heaven.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Something has to take place.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You get to
[1:40:25] to get to business with God.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; And have some purpose
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; and some gratitude for him saving you.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You have that my dear brother.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I was thinking
[1:40:42] I stop shortly.
[1:40:47] I was thinking if you have
[1:40:50] that presence around you
[1:40:54] that Holy Spirit
[1:40:57] I'm glad my brother when he prayed when
[1:40:59] he was opening the service in prayer he
[1:41:02] mentioned that our lord said where two
[1:41:06] or three
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; are gathered in my name
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; there will I be amongst them
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; I was dead you know another thing
[1:41:15] brotherham says
[1:41:17] The devil counts his crowd.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; 1 2 3,000 2,000 a million.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Oh Lord,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; he weighs his church."
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Outweighed in the balances.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; And at found wanting.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; He weighs.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; It's not the
[1:41:39] the quantity,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; It's the quality
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; that comes, you know.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So not only that, Rabam says to
[1:41:49] add to that scripture,
[1:41:52] he says every time we come and worship,
[1:41:56] Christ our Lord comes
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; and walks between the aisles.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; He says to my need, he says to your
[1:42:06] need, he says because we differ.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He says to your need, he walks here
[1:42:12] between the aisles because that's what
[1:42:14] he said. Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's when we grow into that new
[1:42:22] commandment,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; right? Into that love.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And let me read this one.
[1:42:32] Go with me to the book of Romans. Now, I
[1:42:35] think those are going to be the last few
[1:42:37] verses that we're going to read. The
[1:42:39] book of Romans, chapter 8.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I just jump here. Take a verse here, a
[1:42:44] verse there. I read from verse one.
[1:42:48] There is therefore now no condemnation
[1:42:53] to them to them which are in Christ
[1:42:55] Jesus.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; So don't worry. They will say he he
[1:43:00] condemn you telling you how to dress
[1:43:02] telling you this is there's no
[1:43:03] condemnation in you.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord doesn't condemn you.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; If you be in Christ Jesus.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing you must walk not
[1:43:14] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; You must thank God. If there's that
[1:43:21] hunger in you, you hunger for that
[1:43:23] spirit.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; For the law of the spirit of life in
[1:43:26] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[1:43:29] law of sin and death.
[1:43:31] For what the law could not do in that it
[1:43:33] was weak through the flesh, God sending
[1:43:37] his own son in
[1:43:40] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[1:43:43] sin. He condemn sin in the flesh.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That righteousness of the law might be
[1:43:49] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:43:54] flesh but after the spirit.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; That's that's what we we must do,
[1:43:58] brothers. Yes, sisters. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; For they that are after the flesh do
[1:44:04] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[1:44:06] that are after the spirit,
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; the things of the spirit.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; For to be cannally minded is death.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; But to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:44:17] peace.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Because the cannal mind is enmity
[1:44:22] against God. For it is not subject to
[1:44:25] the law of God. Neither indeed can be.
[1:44:28] So then they that are in the flesh
[1:44:30] cannot please God.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; We must get in the spirit so we can
[1:44:35] please God.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; But ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:44:38] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[1:44:41] dwell in you.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:44:46] Christ. He is none of his.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; That's what matters. We should have the
[1:44:53] spirit of Christ in us.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Then we are his.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody is going to take you in.
[1:44:59] Nobody is going to take you out.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; If you have that spirit of Christ.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And if Christ be in you, the body is
[1:45:07] indeed
[1:45:09] is dead because of sin, but the spirit
[1:45:11] is life because of righteousness.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if the spirit of him that
[1:45:15] raised up Christ up Jesus from the dead
[1:45:19] dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
[1:45:23] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:45:27] mortal bodies. Yes.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; By his spirit that dwell in you.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean sister
[1:45:36] I mean
[1:45:38] when you have this spirit of God
[1:45:42] there is that presence I was saying
[1:45:44] around you
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; there is that aura
[1:45:48] there's that holiness there's that peace
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; around you
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; today they have what they call hotspot
[1:45:58] I asked the pastor when I came in here
[1:46:00] to give me a hot spot
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; so that I could be connected with the
[1:46:04] Wi-Fi.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; You know what? As a child of God, let
[1:46:09] them hot spot on you.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; When you there, peace is there.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; When you there,
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; you might not preach, but they feel that
[1:46:18] presence.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; That the Lord is there.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; There's such kindness around you. They
[1:46:25] will even get healed from their
[1:46:26] diseases. Let them watch spot.
[1:46:30] Then
[1:46:32] should I should I say this one? I jumped
[1:46:36] into a taxi cab back home some years
[1:46:40] back
[1:46:41] in this taxi cab only to find I'm
[1:46:44] sitting next to this woman. I didn't
[1:46:47] know that she was a spiritualist
[1:46:49] witch doctor.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; I just sat there as I was sitting next
[1:46:54] to her and she start going
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I thought what's wrong?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You're there.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; What's wrong?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; You're there.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; They say, "No, no, she's,
[1:47:07] you know, they have a term in my
[1:47:09] language." When one of them, you know,
[1:47:11] practices those kind of evil things.
[1:47:14] They say she's a white person.
[1:47:18] [laughter] They say she's white. They
[1:47:20] were saying she's white. I said, "So
[1:47:22] what?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; So what?" here. I'm sitting here. But I
[1:47:26] knew what was taking place because that
[1:47:28] evil spirit in her felt THAT THERE WAS A
[1:47:31] HOLY Spirit sitting NEXT TO THEM.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; AND now she she was restless now that
[1:47:37] I'm there.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; it happens, my brother, sister.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, that Holy Spirit, that
[1:47:43] presence, the Lord goes with you. The
[1:47:45] Lord is with you. And brother, don't
[1:47:48] hesitate. Many times we think that we
[1:47:51] sisters cannot preach. The prophet said
[1:47:53] your place is in the kitchen. Is that
[1:47:55] so?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; So yes, he said so. But the same brother
[1:47:59] Brennham says when you hang on the
[1:48:01] washing IN YOUR BACKYARD, YOU CAN
[1:48:05] TESTIFY TO YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAYS YOU CAN TESTIFY TO THE
[1:48:10] MAN THAT COMES TO DELIVER MILK AT YOUR
[1:48:12] HOUSE.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; You you can't just keep quiet
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; because there's so much life in you.
[1:48:18] Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; There's so much life. Now, um
[1:48:24] I think let me read the last one
[1:48:28] before I I I close
[1:48:31] one verse one in in chapter 8 of this
[1:48:34] book of uh uh Romans
[1:48:39] verse 14. For as many as are led by the
[1:48:43] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[1:48:48] For you have not received the spirit of
[1:48:50] bondage
[1:48:52] again to fear. You must not fear
[1:48:56] but you have received the spirit of
[1:48:58] adoption.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; He has adopted us and made us his sons
[1:49:03] and daughters indeed.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Whereby we cry
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; aba father.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; What aba means in Hebrew? Aba means
[1:49:16] father.
[1:49:19] means father. And to say my father, you
[1:49:21] say a
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; a
[1:49:25] and you say when when you you say you
[1:49:28] are my father, you say a
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; you are my father.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; When when when we talk to him, we don't
[1:49:37] talk to him as mere creatures,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; We talk to him as our own father.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Because we were in him before we're in
[1:49:44] this flesh. Yes.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; That's why we are going back to him
[1:49:49] again.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; He's coming for us, saints.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; He's coming for us.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Let me close my Bible.
[1:49:59] Our Lord said,
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I give unto you a new commandment.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] this new commandment.
[1:50:09] I sometimes brother sister feel
[1:50:15] in the message that day on Calvary of
[1:50:19] 1960
[1:50:20] 0925
[1:50:23] paragraph 27
[1:50:25] says now watch Jesus watch how he stated
[1:50:28] Jesus he said the works that I do
[1:50:33] he's doing them when right now
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; he says the works that I'm doing Now,
[1:50:39] healing the sick, raising the dead, open
[1:50:41] the eyes of the blind, these works shall
[1:50:44] you do also.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; You'll do this.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; If you believe in me.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; You do these works. And then a greater
[1:50:53] than this shall you do, for I go to be
[1:50:56] with the father.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Prob
[1:51:00] and the world won't see me no more yet
[1:51:02] you shall see me. I will be with you
[1:51:05] even in you to the end of the world.
[1:51:07] Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; I will pray with the father. He will
[1:51:13] send you another comforter.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Which is the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Who is that perfect love,
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Who is that a love, that love of God.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; He said you another comforter, the Holy
[1:51:27] Ghost,
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Whom the world cannot receive,
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; yet
[1:51:31] you can receive him.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again
[1:51:36] he goes on to say Jesus said whosoever
[1:51:41] sins you remit to them they are
[1:51:43] remitted.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Whosoever sin you retain to them they
[1:51:48] are retained.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Now here is where the Catholic Church
[1:51:52] and many others made their big mistake.
[1:51:56] They got out to say I forgive your sins.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; That wasn't it.
[1:52:02] That wasn't it. How did they forgive
[1:52:05] sins?
[1:52:07] They gave him the word of God.
[1:52:13] How did they forgive sins in the Bible?
[1:52:15] Peter answered that question on the day
[1:52:17] of Pentecost. He said, they said, "What
[1:52:20] can we do to be saved?"
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; He he said,
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; "How can we get that you all got?"
[1:52:29] He laid down the the prescription. He
[1:52:33] told them, "Repent and be baptized
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus."
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Then you shall receive the gift of the
[1:52:42] Holy Spirit.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters,
[1:52:47] that is
[1:52:50] I think I will stop there.
[1:52:55] You know,
[1:52:58] I love the prophet so much.
[1:53:04] In the church age book, the very last
[1:53:07] paragraph,
[1:53:10] brother says, "Not for one moment do I
[1:53:14] bring a message to the people that they
[1:53:16] may follow me."
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Churches want followers. They want
[1:53:21] crowds. They want
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; But That was not the prophet's
[1:53:25] intention.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't want them to join my
[1:53:29] church. I don't want to start a
[1:53:31] fellowship
[1:53:33] or an organization.
[1:53:35] I have never done that and I will not do
[1:53:37] that now."
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I have no interest in those things.
[1:53:43] But I do have an interest in the things
[1:53:45] of God. Yes. And people.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. to know that brother
[1:53:50] that brother Brennham had
[1:53:53] that interest
[1:53:56] in the people
[1:53:58] in the things of God in the people.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:54:02] when he went over to our country,
[1:54:06] he knew all the tribes that we were that
[1:54:08] we are.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; He would just say, "Oh, I miss those
[1:54:13] people from South Africa."
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:54:18] the Shangan because I'm closer the Zulu
[1:54:21] the Chonga
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; and he's so interested in the people and
[1:54:27] one time you hear him saying oh I miss
[1:54:30] those colored people from South from
[1:54:32] South Africa
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; and he goes in Africans he says when
[1:54:36] they prayus
[1:54:39] that's what I'm saying they say thank
[1:54:41] you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus in
[1:54:43] Africans
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; so he carries on like that because he's
[1:54:46] so interested in the people. He wants to
[1:54:49] get whatever seed is still out there.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; You know, that's that's what we're here
[1:54:54] for. We're waiting for the last one to
[1:54:56] come and then we can go home.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; That's that's what we're waiting. And
[1:55:03] he even when was interested in the
[1:55:05] languages there, he says those African
[1:55:07] people say there's one word that ties
[1:55:10] them together. They have different
[1:55:11] languages. those um
[1:55:14] dialects.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Dale.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says they but there's one one
[1:55:19] word that ties them together. He says
[1:55:21] that is um says you hear them that say
[1:55:24] that great umoya. So that great spirit
[1:55:28] that great umoya. How did he keep all
[1:55:30] those words was interested in the people
[1:55:33] and you find him going to Germany and he
[1:55:36] says those German they say Jesus for
[1:55:39] Jesus.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus with dead feet. He goes
[1:55:43] over to Israel and he says, "Shalom."
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Which means peace.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Peace unto the bride. Shalom.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; And brother, sister, I love that. And
[1:55:53] I've never seen no man that speaks like
[1:55:58] that prophet.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, sister,
[1:56:06] even [clears throat] the sayings,
[1:56:09] the the idioms, the you know, he would
[1:56:12] use things like how can you be half a
[1:56:15] goat and half a sheep?
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; You can't be drunk and sober at the same
[1:56:20] time.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; He says you can't be inside and outside
[1:56:23] the pawn SHOP AT THE SAME TIME.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; He would say a river does not run up and
[1:56:28] down. Mhm.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; So we not running up and down.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; We are focused, brother, sister.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; He said there's no such a thing as a
[1:56:36] black and black white bed.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; He says there's you can't be a crow and
[1:56:41] a dove at the same time.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; That's brother Bren.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, you go
[1:56:49] serve the Lord.
[1:56:51] Help your brother.

[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, somebody said, "I don't
[1:56:58] want to be a liability in the church. I
[1:57:03] I I want to be an asset."

[2:00:14] stop. I don't think he's ever through.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; And that's okay. In ministry, you
[2:00:21] shouldn't be through.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. As much as we as the Lord has to

[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; And is unconditional. That's my favorite
[2:00:52] word
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; describing the love of God.

[2:00:58] unconditional as his love is to us. Our
[2:01:01] love to each other is as unconditional
[2:01:04] as his love is to us.

[2:05:25] of our doctrine.

[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We divide over doctrine. We fight
[2:05:30] over doctrine. We argue over doctrine.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; But we should have the love of God that
[2:05:35] binds us together to never be separated.

[2:06:24] babyed and pampered and you have to
[2:06:27] treat them this way that way. If it's a
[2:06:30] degree too hot, they won't come to
[2:06:31] church. If it's a degree too cold, they
[2:06:33] won't come to church. If it's a little
[2:06:35] drizzle, they won't come to church. If
[2:06:37] the sun's a little shiny, they won't
[2:06:39] come to church. If I don't want to be a
[2:06:41] hot bed plant,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be a rugged child son or
[2:06:45] daughter of God. Amen.
