[36:37] and to show us in here what you'd have
[36:39] us to see and know that every part of
[36:41] this word although the world may try and
[36:44] other denominations may try to denounce
[36:46] certain parts of it because it doesn't
[36:48] dovetail with their particular doctrine
[36:50] or belief or dogma but lord it must
[36:53] every bit come in dovetail and perfect
[36:56] uh unity together lord because this word
[36:59] is you in letter form
[37:01] and there's not one thing out of place
[37:03] with you lord
[37:04] god we rebuke every demonic spirit that
[37:06] would try to hurt him or infiltrate this
[37:08] service in any way feeling the anointing
[37:11] of the power of your spirit flowing
[37:13] through here right now god to do the
[37:15] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[37:17] could ever ask or think
[37:19] praying right now lord that you take
[37:20] full control over every one of us
[37:22] speaker in here alike that what you
[37:24] would have to be accomplished in this
[37:25] service today will be so as we committed
[37:28] fully into your hands once again in the
[37:30] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[37:32] amen amen
[37:34] first peter chapter 5 verse 1
[37:37] the elders which are among you i exhort
[37:40] who am also who who am also an elder and
[37:44] a witness of the sufferings of christ
[37:46] and also a partaker of the glory that
[37:48] shall be revealed feed the flock of god
[37:51] which is among you taking the oversight
[37:54] thereof not by constraint but willingly
[37:57] not for filthy lucra but of a ready mind
[37:59] neither as being lords over god's
[38:02] heritage but being in samples to the
[38:05] flock
[38:06] and when the chief shepherds shall
[38:08] appear we ye shall receive a crown of
[38:10] glory that fadeth not away
[38:13] and you can be seated if you like
[38:16] we actually took this scripture not too
[38:17] long ago but on a different topic
[38:20] i want to major on that second verse
[38:22] there
[38:23] uh that talks about not being by
[38:26] constraint but willingly
[38:28] amen not being by constraint but
[38:31] willingly the title i want to have
[38:33] though today is god
[38:36] the gentleman
[38:37] that's my title god the gentleman which
[38:40] goes with
[38:41] not by constraint but willingly amen god
[38:45] loves that your forgiver right and god
[38:47] always wants those people to serve him
[38:50] willingly god wants every one of us to
[38:52] serve him willingly he wants us to be
[38:55] his children because we are always were
[38:58] his children but because we want to
[39:01] we want he wants us to live the way he
[39:04] wants us to live not by force but
[39:06] because he wants us to live that way
[39:10] there's nothing forceable god's a
[39:12] gentleman friend he doesn't force
[39:13] himself on anyone in fact god doesn't
[39:16] force anybody to serve him nor does god
[39:19] want anybody to serve him by force
[39:22] god doesn't want anybody to disconnect
[39:24] that has to serve him by force he wants
[39:27] us to willingly not constrain now this
[39:30] of course was to the ministers and the
[39:32] and the heritage or those that god has
[39:34] given authoritative positions to not do
[39:38] it to the individuals by constraint but
[39:40] willingly but it comes as a as an
[39:43] overall understanding and feeling belief
[39:45] that we as christians do what we do
[39:48] willingly we live for god willingly we
[39:51] do what we do because we want to do it
[39:53] because god's word dictates to us that
[39:56] we do it that way but we don't do it
[39:59] because it's forced on us by god's word
[40:02] we do it because we love him and we want
[40:04] to please him in that way
[40:06] you know the things that i do for my
[40:08] family or the things that i've done for
[40:09] my wife here almost 37 years the end of
[40:12] this month
[40:13] i've done willingly i've done because
[40:15] i've wanted to my wife has not forced me
[40:18] she has not made me nor have i heard i
[40:21] haven't forced her or made her she what
[40:24] she's done to serve me to serve our
[40:27] family she's done willingly and that's
[40:29] exactly and that's a relationship and
[40:32] that's exactly what god wants with his
[40:34] children is a relationship he doesn't
[40:36] want to be lord over us although he is
[40:40] he doesn't want to lord over us although
[40:42] he does but we do it because because we
[40:45] want to do it she served me because she
[40:48] wanted to serve me we as his bride serve
[40:51] him because we want to serve him we do
[40:54] it willingly from our hearts we are not
[40:56] deceived
[40:57] peter said uh later on there in second
[41:00] peter
[41:01] that that we are not a deceived people
[41:03] we don't do this by deception we do it
[41:06] with a willing heart and a willing mind
[41:08] because we know what his word says we
[41:11] know what is pleasing to the lord amen a
[41:13] lot of people have ideas of what they're
[41:16] what would be pleasing to the lord and
[41:18] they live their lives as thus
[41:20] i'm assuming all christians they i
[41:22] assume all christians live their lives
[41:24] in a way that they feel will be pleasing
[41:27] to god i i can only assume that and if
[41:30] they do that then you figure that the
[41:31] way they live is the way that is
[41:33] pleasing to the lord but friend the only
[41:36] way i know of to be pleasing to my god
[41:40] is to follow the word that he gave me
[41:42] amen that's the only way i know to do it
[41:44] right and if you follow the word he gave
[41:47] it's going to be a word of holiness it's
[41:50] going to be a life of holiness it's not
[41:52] a life of dictation
[41:55] it's it's not a light life of legalism
[41:58] it's a life of freedom
[42:00] it's it's a life of serving god in the
[42:03] way that god calls for us to serve him
[42:06] it's not legalism it's holiness
[42:09] it's because of a standard that god has
[42:12] called us to a standard of life that his
[42:15] children live god has called his
[42:18] children you read the scripture of
[42:20] course a lot of people probably bypass
[42:22] that scripture but the bible says if you
[42:25] love the word of the things of the world
[42:26] god how god's not even in you yes
[42:30] god can't even be a part of your life
[42:33] brother madam even said don't pattern
[42:35] yourself after the world yes amen why do
[42:38] you think brother bannon was against
[42:39] crew cuts
[42:41] you know brother bannon spoke harshly
[42:42] against crew cuts even though it made
[42:44] the man's hair really short
[42:47] because it was a patterning of the world
[42:49] at that time
[42:50] that's why he said that being patterned
[42:53] after the world we're not supposed to be
[42:55] like the world we're not supposed to
[42:57] look like the world we're not supposed
[42:59] to act like the world god's word for
[43:02] those who don't know has called for a
[43:05] total separation from all unbelief
[43:08] what's unbelief anything that's against
[43:10] this word not a man's interpretation of
[43:14] it not a man's idea of what it says but
[43:17] what the word says to us that's what we
[43:20] live because we want to because we love
[43:23] god so much that we would be willing to
[43:28] look the way we look and act the way we
[43:30] act and don't go places the world goes
[43:32] or and do things the world thinks is
[43:35] foolish or won't do we do it because we
[43:37] love him they love him so much we're
[43:40] willing to do that in accordance to his
[43:42] word not accordance to a man's word
[43:44] according to god's word not according to
[43:46] a denomination's dogma but according to
[43:48] god's word some people call us a cult
[43:52] i got news for you saints that's just a
[43:55] buzzword to try to put fear on people
[43:57] you don't want to know the truth we are
[44:00] a cult amen
[44:02] anybody that says they're a christian is
[44:05] a cult yes if you're a christian and
[44:08] you're not a cult you're not a christian
[44:12] every definition
[44:14] of what this country deems as a cult
[44:16] today jesus christ fit every one of them
[44:20] well if you're a servant of his then
[44:22] you're one of him right then you're
[44:25] identified with that then you're
[44:27] considered to them as a cult
[44:30] well praise god i thank god i follow
[44:32] jesus christ my lord
[44:37] let me read you something i i actually
[44:39] looked up a definition today
[44:42] just because i was thinking about it and
[44:44] it came on my heart
[44:46] i looked up in webster's dictionary
[44:49] occult defined now this is not the
[44:52] government
[44:53] okay what i mentioned before was the
[44:55] government's definition the united
[44:57] states definition of a cult this was
[44:59] real big when it came with david koresh
[45:02] and the waco and all that that was a big
[45:04] issue then and of course it's still a
[45:06] buzzword um
[45:08] i i
[45:09] they may do it but i've never heard it
[45:13] but
[45:14] i don't know what the republicans call
[45:16] democrats occults but i've heard
[45:17] democrats call the republicans cults or
[45:19] or those that believe donald trump was a
[45:21] good president
[45:23] they used that word not just for a
[45:25] christian you understand
[45:27] but look at this see so they they try to
[45:30] place everybody in that in that category
[45:32] a system of religion
[45:35] uh veneration and devotion directed
[45:38] towards a particular figure
[45:41] amen
[45:42] what is that
[45:43] is that not who we are as christians
[45:45] hallelujah
[45:46] all of our veneration devotion devotion
[45:49] is directed towards him amen amen
[45:53] amen
[45:54] well then you're a cult amen if all of
[45:58] your veneration devotion love is not
[46:00] directed toward him then you're not a
[46:02] christian
[46:03] right
[46:05] and if it is you're a cult so they can
[46:07] people can say what they want but that's
[46:09] this right here
[46:11] a relatively small group of people
[46:13] having religious beliefs or practices
[46:16] regarded by others as strange or
[46:19] sinister
[46:23] guilty
[46:24] amen
[46:26] he was considered so strange and so
[46:29] sinister they hung him on a cross yes
[46:34] colt
[46:36] amen well then people can say what they
[46:38] want friend they can classify you how
[46:40] they want but that's just the fact of
[46:42] the matter right and what they use and
[46:45] what people don't understand is in so
[46:47] many ways
[46:48] take the religious part out of it
[46:50] in some way shape or form they're occult
[46:52] too
[46:54] amen
[46:55] i remember this story brother green told
[46:57] him he met this man and he was talking
[46:59] said oh that man said oh i i don't
[47:01] follow a man i don't of course brother
[47:04] green's like oh we don't follow a man
[47:05] either oh yeah y'all believe this
[47:07] message so on so forth he said but i
[47:09] don't follow a man i i i refuse to do
[47:12] that i follow jesus christ i don't
[47:14] follow just any human man and he got to
[47:16] talk and brother greek got to talk to
[47:17] the man and talking to him and finding
[47:19] out his background and his life and
[47:20] everything and come to find out
[47:22] everything the man talked about he did
[47:24] was because his wife told him to he told
[47:26] him later he said sir i believe you're
[47:27] right you don't follow a man you follow
[47:29] a woman
[47:32] amen
[47:33] the point of that is somebody everybody
[47:35] follows somebody usually in some way
[47:37] shape or form but our following is him
[47:40] amen amen praise the lord my coldhood is
[47:43] i'm a christian
[47:45] and he is my lord and my savior my god
[47:47] and i love him so much i'm willing to do
[47:49] whatever his word
[47:52] abraham loved him so much he actually
[47:54] was willing to take his only son and
[47:56] sacrifice him now god doesn't accept
[47:59] human sacrifice we know that
[48:01] but he was willing to do it
[48:04] because of his love for god
[48:06] now if that ain't the definition of a
[48:08] cold i don't know what is so people with
[48:09] loose lips which we know seek shift
[48:13] people with loose lips don't know what
[48:15] they're talking about slap out these
[48:18] buzzwords to try to make people feel
[48:20] guilty
[48:22] and try to put people down when the fact
[48:24] of the matter is they just need to find
[48:26] out what they're talking about and know
[48:28] what they're saying so they can stand
[48:30] upon what they say they believe
[48:33] amen they believe it well your life will
[48:36] dictate to you what you believe
[48:39] amen if you believe it you're going to
[48:40] live it
[48:41] you're going to do what the word says
[48:44] amen
[48:45] god does not want to have anybody serve
[48:50] him
[48:50] forcibly right he wants them to do it
[48:53] willingly
[48:54] because it's from your heart let's go to
[48:56] romans chapter 6.
[49:00] now i got a whole nother thing to this
[49:02] see god's god's a gentleman that's the
[49:04] whole point of this see god's a
[49:06] gentleman he doesn't force himself on
[49:08] anybody
[49:09] god is not going to come down with the
[49:11] louisville slugger and make you serve
[49:13] him
[49:14] he's not going to bash you inside the
[49:16] head until you serve him no
[49:18] he's a gentleman
[49:20] we are free moral agents
[49:22] that's why the world is the way it is
[49:24] today
[49:26] could god have forced his spirit on
[49:28] everybody to fall down sure he could
[49:31] they will one day
[49:34] one day every knee will bow every time
[49:36] we'll confess could he do it now sure he
[49:38] could yeah
[49:39] absolutely
[49:40] but he doesn't want us to he doesn't
[49:43] want people to serve him that way
[49:45] he wants to do he wants to be served he
[49:47] wants us to live for him because we
[49:49] desire to because we want to and the
[49:52] only way to do that is to obey his word
[49:55] jesus said if you love me keep my
[49:57] commandments do what i tell you amen if
[49:59] you don't do what i tell you it just
[50:00] proves you don't love me amen and and
[50:03] that's that probably sums it up
[50:05] romans chapter 6 verse 11.
[50:10] paul hear the roman church he said
[50:12] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[50:14] dead indeed unto sin
[50:17] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[50:20] our lord
[50:21] let not sin therefore reign in your
[50:24] mortal body that ye should obey it in
[50:27] the lust thereof now what is sin sin is
[50:30] missing the mark
[50:32] sin is unbelief
[50:34] and
[50:35] missing the mark of what
[50:38] this unbelief of what
[50:42] this amen
[50:43] amen that's all sin is
[50:46] it's missing the mark unbelief of this
[50:49] his word
[50:50] so if it's unbelief of his word if it's
[50:53] missing the mark of this word then it is
[50:56] deemed sin
[50:59] let not sin therefore reign in your
[51:01] mortal body
[51:02] that ye should obey it in the lusts
[51:05] thereof there you go lust of people's
[51:07] flesh the pride of life that's exactly
[51:09] how most people fall that's how they go
[51:11] into it unfortunately it seems like a
[51:13] lot of churches are allowing people to
[51:16] manipulate themselves to the place that
[51:18] that's how they live
[51:20] they actually live their lives and
[51:22] conduct their business based on the lust
[51:25] of their life instead of on god's holy
[51:27] word
[51:30] it makes me wonder and ask
[51:32] and i'll ask it even of
[51:34] myself newton are you projecting your
[51:38] life are you projecting yourself are you
[51:40] living in a way that is complementary to
[51:44] the word of god and to the holy spirit
[51:47] are you dressing are you acting are you
[51:50] talking are you living in a way that
[51:52] others would see christ in you
[51:56] or do you just look like another member
[51:58] of the world
[51:59] do you just act like another member of
[52:01] the world
[52:02] do you just say see one of the biggest
[52:04] cults there is in the world today
[52:06] is the devil
[52:08] a lot of people don't know that but the
[52:10] devil's the biggest cult there is in the
[52:11] world today they worship him without
[52:13] even knowing it right they serve him
[52:15] without even knowing it so it serves to
[52:17] understand
[52:19] this moral body paul says this mortal
[52:21] body
[52:22] are you living in a way do you that that
[52:24] would be when people look and say now
[52:27] there's a christian
[52:29] or they look at a room and say well i
[52:30] don't see any difference in any of them
[52:32] right well half of them go to this
[52:34] church
[52:35] and half of them are the other half of a
[52:37] third are atheists the other third are
[52:39] agnostics can't tell the difference amen
[52:43] well something's wrong in that picture
[52:44] friend am i amen there's got to be a
[52:47] there is a difference
[52:49] when a person is born again and filled
[52:51] with the spirit of god there's a
[52:53] difference in that person's life it'll
[52:55] that that spirit will live through them
[52:58] and it won't live through them of the
[53:00] dictates that we see in the world it'll
[53:02] live through them to the holiness of
[53:04] this word
[53:05] it's a holy standard not legalism a
[53:08] holiness standard
[53:10] look at this
[53:13] neither yield your members see those
[53:15] those lusts are taken over now neither
[53:17] neither yield ye your members as
[53:20] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[53:23] but yield yourselves unto god as those
[53:27] that are alive from the dead and your
[53:29] members as instruments of righteousness
[53:31] unto god now
[53:33] unfortunately a lot of people have taken
[53:35] that scripture and subsequent ones with
[53:37] some three
[53:39] and applied it in their lives in a way
[53:43] that they feel like that the grace of
[53:45] god though it does cover all sins
[53:48] it does
[53:50] but that it that through the spirit of
[53:52] that nicolaitan
[53:54] and catholicism
[53:56] that it it affords them the right and
[53:59] the ability to live however they want to
[54:03] and still be okay
[54:05] it doesn't matter god doesn't care how
[54:07] you dress well then why are there so
[54:10] many scriptures in the bible old
[54:12] testament and new that refer to the
[54:15] clothes that you wear
[54:17] if he doesn't care why is it in there
[54:20] oh god doesn't care how you wear your
[54:22] hair then why there's so many scriptures
[54:26] old testament and new that tells us that
[54:29] god cares am i bad if he didn't why
[54:32] would it be in here
[54:35] of course he does
[54:36] oh god doesn't care about this he
[54:39] absolutely does he cares about your
[54:41] mortal flesh yes he does
[54:44] as a christian this is supposed to be
[54:46] the temple of the holy ghost
[54:49] it is supposed to be sacred and holy
[54:54] i remember
[54:56] i was talking to my barber thursday and
[54:58] i remember this story this older lady
[55:00] she wasn't uh say elderly but she was
[55:03] older
[55:04] i said man my wife saw this
[55:06] older lady probably 75 80 years old
[55:10] in the cracker barrel the other day
[55:11] monday i think it was she had a tattoo
[55:13] right here
[55:15] and it was and sony said well maybe she
[55:17] got it now it was fresh you could tell
[55:19] you know when they get old they start
[55:20] spreading out and they just kind of you
[55:22] know become a big black blob
[55:24] but this was very defined you could tell
[55:27] it was it was it was it was fresh and
[55:29] new and i thought wow why would what
[55:30] would compel a 75 year old woman to go
[55:33] get a tattoo
[55:35] and it reminded me and i told my barber
[55:37] uh
[55:38] thursday this uh older lady these
[55:40] younger kids was talking to her and said
[55:42] hey uh uh man why why don't you go ahead
[55:45] and get tattoo or ink they call it ink
[55:47] cause why don't you go get some ink you
[55:49] know that's kind of the cool uh way of
[55:52] putting it you know get some ink i've
[55:54] got ink
[55:56] and they go get this
[55:58] and their body and that and that lady
[56:00] looked at those kids and says why in the
[56:02] world would i put a bumper sticker on a
[56:03] rolls royce
[56:05] oh man
[56:08] amen
[56:09] i agree with you lady don't know who it
[56:12] was don't know if she's a christian or
[56:13] what but make good sense amen why would
[56:17] i do that praise the lord amen
[56:20] now
[56:21] yielding yourselves members as
[56:24] instruments of righteousness unto god
[56:27] but look down because people take that
[56:29] they take that and they say well the
[56:30] grace of god will cover the grace of god
[56:32] will take care of i i know i live this
[56:35] way but the god god will take care god
[56:36] the grace of god will cover over that
[56:39] willful purposeful sin
[56:42] god grace can take care of it yes but
[56:44] that's that's not the purpose of the
[56:46] grace
[56:47] amen the purpose of the grace is our
[56:49] humanity it's to be used uh to alleviate
[56:53] our and help our humanity not as a
[56:55] crutch
[56:57] not as an excuse to sin
[56:59] look what paul goes on to say for sin
[57:02] shall not have dominion over you
[57:05] for ye are not under the law but under
[57:07] grace
[57:08] then paul says obviously he was
[57:10] questioned
[57:12] what then
[57:13] shall we sin because we are not under
[57:16] the law but under grace paul said god
[57:19] forbid
[57:21] amen
[57:22] well that could just have however the
[57:24] one because of the grace of god no
[57:26] paul they questioned him here and he
[57:28] says shall i live however i want to
[57:30] because the grace of god will take care
[57:32] of it god said and paul said god forbid
[57:35] amen we don't take the grace of god and
[57:37] make a disgrace out of it
[57:40] know ye not that to whom ye yield
[57:42] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[57:46] ye are to whom ye obey
[57:48] whether of sin unto death or of
[57:50] obedience unto righteousness
[57:53] it's like i said satan is the biggest
[57:55] cult today
[57:56] he has the greatest following he has the
[57:58] most influence we know we're in satan's
[58:01] eating amen and anything outside from
[58:03] the garden of eden friend anything
[58:05] outside of the word of god 100
[58:07] is of the devil amen
[58:09] so
[58:10] if you yield your members to obey
[58:13] that's whose servant you are
[58:15] if you're yielding your memories in
[58:17] obedience to to a to a church or
[58:19] denomination or to the the government of
[58:22] the whims of of the devil then that's
[58:24] who you're serving
[58:26] and that's the cult
[58:29] but god be thanked that ye were the serp
[58:32] that ye were
[58:33] that ye were
[58:35] amen
[58:36] you with me now
[58:38] that you were
[58:40] past tense
[58:42] you were the servants of sin
[58:45] but ye have obeyed from the heart
[58:49] praise the lord not because you were
[58:51] forced to
[58:52] not because you were made to
[58:54] amen now i know i said earlier we train
[58:57] our children the way they should go we
[58:59] make them live a certain life and act a
[59:02] certain way or dress a certain way
[59:03] because that's our responsibility as
[59:05] parents a lot of times today as we know
[59:07] brother branham said it's parent
[59:09] delinquency and not child delinquency
[59:11] because parents just let their kids do
[59:13] whatever
[59:14] live however and and
[59:16] and
[59:18] well it doesn't matter what your
[59:19] chromosome said son you can be a girl if
[59:21] you want to
[59:24] it doesn't work that way
[59:26] or it it can for them
[59:29] they can get some medical doctor or
[59:30] something but in god's eyes
[59:34] that's a slap in the face of god's
[59:36] omnipotence amen his creation from the
[59:39] beginning he made a man and a woman
[59:42] amen god did not make a man
[59:45] be born into this world
[59:50] but was supposed to be a woman
[59:52] god doesn't do that
[59:54] right now slap in the face of god look
[59:56] here now
[59:58] god be thanked that you were the
[1:00:01] servants of sins but you have obeyed
[1:00:03] from the heart
[1:00:05] that form of doctrine which was
[1:00:07] delivered to you
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] and you trained your children
[1:00:13] you raise them right
[1:00:16] the actual scripture says train the
[1:00:18] child
[1:00:20] in the way
[1:00:21] they should go
[1:00:24] not in the way the government says they
[1:00:26] should go not in the way some not even
[1:00:29] some
[1:00:30] not even another person in your church
[1:00:34] it's not up to me to raise your children
[1:00:37] it's up to you right
[1:00:39] you train them and the way they should
[1:00:42] go
[1:00:44] praise the lord
[1:00:45] what way is that the way of the lord
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] that's the only way you can go
[1:00:52] that's the only way train them according
[1:00:54] to this work oh no i just let my kid
[1:00:57] live however i just let them go and do
[1:01:00] however i can't tell you how many times
[1:01:02] you probably experienced it to me and my
[1:01:03] wife are going to restaurant or me and
[1:01:05] other people
[1:01:06] one time i believe we were the olive
[1:01:08] guard the one on valencia or irvington
[1:01:11] excuse me and
[1:01:12] we were standing there sitting there
[1:01:14] eating and this little kid was a table
[1:01:16] big gap in between it was a table on the
[1:01:18] other side that had a little kid and
[1:01:19] that kid spent almost the entire
[1:01:21] uh
[1:01:22] meal jumping and dancing and running and
[1:01:25] all kinds of stuff
[1:01:28] friend if i had done that
[1:01:31] i wouldn't have been able to sit down
[1:01:34] if my son or daughter had tried that you
[1:01:37] can ask them afterwards well
[1:01:40] if they would have been able to sit down
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:46] that's just what the bible says and i
[1:01:48] thought are they are these people are
[1:01:50] ever going to teach this child the right
[1:01:53] way to be right
[1:01:55] and i tell you what i stand here and i
[1:01:58] have got to tell you how proud i am of
[1:02:02] you especially parents are trying zach
[1:02:05] tabitha these little kids are sitting
[1:02:07] here so politely quietly nicely in
[1:02:11] church
[1:02:12] three four seven eight
[1:02:15] children
[1:02:17] amen politely quietly
[1:02:19] god bless you that that is that is a
[1:02:22] jewel in your crown right there
[1:02:24] right amen that is pleasing to the lord
[1:02:27] yes because of those children you see
[1:02:30] training them the way they should go
[1:02:32] i remember
[1:02:35] and i won't say i've had people ask me
[1:02:36] in the past well but my child won't
[1:02:38] behave i said you bring them there
[1:02:40] anyway
[1:02:41] you teach them that's what they're
[1:02:42] supposed to do that's where they're
[1:02:44] supposed to be but they'll disrupt
[1:02:45] service we'll be okay god will take care
[1:02:48] of that people understand bring them yes
[1:02:51] amen that's how you teach them
[1:02:54] amen
[1:02:55] and look
[1:02:56] praise the lord that's the way it's
[1:02:57] supposed to be look from your heart now
[1:02:59] let's get back to this amen don't be too
[1:03:02] long
[1:03:03] from your heart that's that's that's our
[1:03:05] part god the gentleman we yield unto god
[1:03:09] it's from the heart for that form of
[1:03:11] doctrine which was delivered to you
[1:03:14] what doctrine the word of god
[1:03:16] god's word
[1:03:18] being that people make excuse for that
[1:03:21] people will try to
[1:03:22] uh uh
[1:03:23] make excuses for for the word of god
[1:03:25] well i i don't want to work live like
[1:03:27] that well then you don't belong to god
[1:03:30] or maybe you do and you just don't know
[1:03:32] it yet
[1:03:33] i mean we've all rebelled at some points
[1:03:35] and times
[1:03:37] let's continue
[1:03:39] being then made free from sin ye became
[1:03:41] the servants of righteousness see so
[1:03:44] being made free doesn't mean you live
[1:03:47] however you want to
[1:03:48] being made free means that you're free
[1:03:51] to become a servant
[1:03:53] of righteousness
[1:03:55] praise the lord you mean i've been
[1:03:57] liberated to be a servant absolutely
[1:04:00] you've been made free
[1:04:02] now we serve willingly
[1:04:04] we live our lives willingly to the word
[1:04:06] of god because that's our desire now i
[1:04:08] want to go to a story
[1:04:10] saint luke
[1:04:13] and i want to finish this up with this
[1:04:15] story because there's
[1:04:16] there's very good
[1:04:19] lessons has just been preached on many
[1:04:21] many times i have myself
[1:04:24] i believe i even have uh
[1:04:26] been a while since i read it but i
[1:04:28] believe even have this story in my book
[1:04:30] at least to some degree
[1:04:32] god's looking for someone to serve him
[1:04:35] with their heart we're going to luke
[1:04:36] chapter 15. i didn't mention that luke
[1:04:39] 15
[1:04:40] he wants somebody he wants a people to
[1:04:42] serve him with their heart
[1:04:44] because it's in their heart to do so not
[1:04:47] to be forced to do it
[1:04:50] i'm not a child of god because i joined
[1:04:53] a church
[1:04:54] i'm not a child of god because i preach
[1:04:57] or because i can sing a
[1:05:00] gospel hymn
[1:05:02] i i'm not a child of god because my name
[1:05:05] is on
[1:05:06] an earthly church role of some kind
[1:05:09] i'm a child of god
[1:05:11] because in god's mind before the world
[1:05:14] was formed i was there
[1:05:17] i was in his lawrence i was a child
[1:05:20] before the world ever started we know
[1:05:23] that according to the scripture
[1:05:25] you go back
[1:05:26] in revelation it tells you before the
[1:05:29] world began
[1:05:32] i've been a child of god my whole life
[1:05:36] whether i knew it whether i act like it
[1:05:39] whether i wanted to be or not i was
[1:05:42] i didn't force myself to be obedient
[1:05:45] i was born a bit amen
[1:05:48] there might have been times i didn't
[1:05:49] want to be but i was anyway now that's
[1:05:52] just a name of course your character of
[1:05:54] course defines you way farther than just
[1:05:56] a name tag to you but you understand my
[1:05:58] point
[1:05:59] i was born of that lineage
[1:06:02] i was the son of mom my mom and dad
[1:06:07] that because a surname of bennett that
[1:06:10] made me that as thus
[1:06:12] that's the only reason i am
[1:06:14] whether i wanted to be or not was my
[1:06:17] choice although some crazy guy i think
[1:06:19] in the india
[1:06:20] uh wanted to sue his parents because he
[1:06:23] didn't want to be born
[1:06:24] right he was suing his parents because
[1:06:26] his parents
[1:06:27] birthed him and he didn't want to be
[1:06:29] born
[1:06:30] the craziness today
[1:06:32] i i told the lord this morning i said
[1:06:34] god if this is if sodom and gomorrah was
[1:06:37] worse than we are today
[1:06:40] mercy
[1:06:42] how much more has it got to be how much
[1:06:46] fuller does the cup of iniquity have to
[1:06:48] get right
[1:06:52] you just look around saints and i just
[1:06:54] it's just incredible now to the worldly
[1:06:56] people the ungodly people they don't
[1:06:57] care or nominal christians even they
[1:06:59] don't care that's just the way of the
[1:07:01] world it's just the way things go it
[1:07:02] doesn't bother them
[1:07:04] but it bothers the holy ghost field born
[1:07:06] again christian yes it vexes just like
[1:07:09] it did uh it vexes our righteous soul
[1:07:12] daily just like lot they're in sodom
[1:07:15] vexes righteous soul daily what does it
[1:07:17] do to us
[1:07:18] but that's where we're sitting but see i
[1:07:21] did i i wasn't made a child of god and a
[1:07:24] lot of people thinking in the christian
[1:07:26] world that they became a christian when
[1:07:28] they came to an altar or they became a
[1:07:30] child of god excuse me they became a
[1:07:32] child of god when they came to the altar
[1:07:34] they became a child of god when they uh
[1:07:37] came into the church or they became a
[1:07:39] child of god when they were born again
[1:07:41] that's not when you became a child of
[1:07:43] god if you're a child of god you were
[1:07:45] always a child of god it didn't matter
[1:07:47] where you were didn't matter what you
[1:07:48] was going through didn't matter what
[1:07:50] family you were born into didn't matter
[1:07:51] you wanted to or not
[1:07:55] you get to the place where you're
[1:07:56] thankful because you realize who you
[1:07:59] were who you are
[1:08:01] but that's how you're a child of god
[1:08:03] let's read this
[1:08:05] luke 15 11.
[1:08:07] the lord gives certain examples of the
[1:08:09] things that were lost and found
[1:08:12] a certain man had two sons
[1:08:14] the younger of them said to his father
[1:08:16] father give me the portion of goods that
[1:08:18] followed to me
[1:08:19] and he divided unto them his living
[1:08:22] not many days after the younger son
[1:08:24] gathered all together and took his
[1:08:26] journey into a far country and there
[1:08:29] wasted his substance with riotous living
[1:08:32] now that riotous
[1:08:35] is a twofold purpose as a twofold
[1:08:37] meaning
[1:08:38] yes righteous as an ungodly own holy
[1:08:41] immoral living yes
[1:08:44] but it also means that he spent his
[1:08:47] substance without regard of money right
[1:08:51] it meant nothing to him
[1:08:53] he served his dad of course in the
[1:08:55] fields of whatever they did as a son to
[1:08:57] his dad but he didn't have a value of
[1:09:00] money
[1:09:02] and so this riotous means that without
[1:09:04] regard of money you know that most
[1:09:07] people who win the lottery are broke
[1:09:09] within 10 years
[1:09:11] because they didn't earn it
[1:09:13] it was just given to them yeah they won
[1:09:15] some prize
[1:09:17] and it was just given to them
[1:09:19] and
[1:09:19] and as dust they just spin it like it's
[1:09:22] nothing i think oh i got a million
[1:09:24] dollars this will last forever
[1:09:26] no it doesn't
[1:09:28] right
[1:09:29] that client friend of ours mary
[1:09:32] just sold their house up in the
[1:09:33] foothills for seven hundred and forty
[1:09:35] thousand dollars there goes a million
[1:09:37] right there
[1:09:39] amen they go oh this will last forever
[1:09:42] and his and that riotous yes immoral
[1:09:44] living but it was he he just spent the
[1:09:47] money without regard of money
[1:09:49] he just spent it like it was water like
[1:09:51] it was gonna last forever
[1:09:53] and that's the way a lot of people do
[1:09:55] the exact same way just like it doesn't
[1:09:57] mean anything
[1:09:59] because they didn't work for it it was
[1:10:01] given to him and this was given to him
[1:10:03] so it doesn't it didn't mean to him what
[1:10:05] it should that's why again a lot of the
[1:10:07] lottery winners go broke after 10 years
[1:10:10] or whatever it is
[1:10:11] because it just doesn't mean to them and
[1:10:13] i remember brother uh
[1:10:16] ron carpenter up in the mountains he was
[1:10:18] a drywall guy he would go on the
[1:10:20] reservation and do a lot of reservation
[1:10:22] work and he said they would build brand
[1:10:24] new houses now this is not a
[1:10:26] knock on the uh the native american or
[1:10:29] anything like that it's just what our
[1:10:30] country's done
[1:10:32] uh
[1:10:33] it's just
[1:10:34] i'm an american and i'm proud to be one
[1:10:36] but friend we've got some dark parts of
[1:10:38] our history we know that right
[1:10:42] good bad or indifferent it just it is
[1:10:44] what it is and it lingers into today
[1:10:48] because of how we treated them
[1:10:51] and he said they'll go and the
[1:10:53] government would just they gave him all
[1:10:55] this land
[1:10:56] that was theirs to begin with
[1:10:58] you know brother graham called geronimo
[1:11:00] a gentleman
[1:11:02] anyway it was theirs to begin with but
[1:11:04] they build up all these houses
[1:11:06] brand new houses that they can just live
[1:11:08] in go here this is your house this is
[1:11:10] your house it's called it and brother
[1:11:12] ron says he'll go in less than a year
[1:11:15] and he'll have to fix that house all up
[1:11:17] again because he's tore all the pieces
[1:11:19] yeah
[1:11:19] a year
[1:11:21] they tear apart a brand new house in a
[1:11:23] year why
[1:11:25] it was given to them right they didn't
[1:11:27] earn it the respect of it just wasn't
[1:11:29] there
[1:11:30] and so that it didn't mean anything to
[1:11:32] them they tore it apart probably knowing
[1:11:34] that they would
[1:11:35] uh they would contract somebody to go
[1:11:38] back and fix it up again right holds big
[1:11:41] holes in the wall
[1:11:42] liquor bottles everywhere just just a
[1:11:44] mess
[1:11:45] now again that's not a knock on them
[1:11:47] just reality
[1:11:49] unfortunately in a lot of cases that's
[1:11:51] just the reality
[1:11:53] but when something is
[1:11:55] is is earned
[1:11:58] it means more
[1:11:59] but when you look at salvation for just
[1:12:02] a moment if you look at salvation it's a
[1:12:04] free gift
[1:12:06] god give it to us freely
[1:12:08] but if that spirit of god
[1:12:11] some people trash it
[1:12:14] and some people run all over it
[1:12:17] along with the blood of christ
[1:12:19] and some people it doesn't mean as much
[1:12:22] to them they weren't born again filled
[1:12:25] with the spirit so this salvation
[1:12:27] doesn't mean as much to them they
[1:12:29] trample all over it and they treat it
[1:12:31] like well no matter what i do salvation
[1:12:33] is always going to be there no it's not
[1:12:37] this man
[1:12:39] burnt through his money oh it's always
[1:12:41] going to be there but it wasn't
[1:12:44] it's always there until it's not right
[1:12:47] and people just think oh well the
[1:12:48] salvation is just always going to be
[1:12:50] there no it's not right if you trample
[1:12:53] all over the blood of christ and you
[1:12:54] reject his word and that message of
[1:12:57] truth then
[1:12:59] god have mercy on you
[1:13:02] what else can you say
[1:13:05] but for the true believer
[1:13:08] the born again holy ghost filled
[1:13:10] believer
[1:13:11] that salvation though it was a free gift
[1:13:13] from god it cost him
[1:13:15] everything he give to us freely that we
[1:13:19] respect
[1:13:20] and that we appreciate and that we
[1:13:23] revere
[1:13:24] that salvation
[1:13:26] that god give us
[1:13:28] but some people just don't
[1:13:30] it doesn't mean anything to them they
[1:13:31] didn't earn it right amen and i didn't
[1:13:34] earn this i couldn't have earned it it
[1:13:36] was no way there's no possible human way
[1:13:40] i could have ever earned my own
[1:13:41] salvation right can't happen
[1:13:43] can't do it yes that's why he came
[1:13:46] because he knew we needed it we were his
[1:13:48] children he knew he needed it and he
[1:13:50] gave it to us
[1:13:52] praise the lord
[1:13:53] and we appreciate it we thank god for it
[1:13:56] he
[1:13:57] just
[1:13:58] this uh uh prodigal son wasted his
[1:14:01] substance
[1:14:03] with ungodly living and burnt through
[1:14:05] his money like it didn't mean anything
[1:14:08] and when he had spent all
[1:14:10] there arose a mighty famine in that land
[1:14:13] and he began to be in want god knows
[1:14:16] exactly how
[1:14:17] situations
[1:14:19] dictate things in our lives doesn't he
[1:14:22] amen you ever tried to run from god in a
[1:14:25] certain situation dictated a certain
[1:14:27] circumstance in your life
[1:14:29] to kind of
[1:14:30] give you a nudge back in that direction
[1:14:32] right amen
[1:14:34] give you just a little bit nudge
[1:14:37] god doesn't force anybody god doesn't
[1:14:39] make anybody but sometimes we just we
[1:14:41] need that little pull
[1:14:43] we need that little nudge
[1:14:45] god will allow circumstances to happen
[1:14:48] satan thinks oh i'm pounding him into
[1:14:50] the ground what he doesn't realize is
[1:14:52] he's just driving that child of god back
[1:14:54] to where he's supposed to be praise the
[1:14:56] lord
[1:14:57] aren't you glad the devil's just a tool
[1:14:59] in the hand of god
[1:15:00] amen so many people scared to death of
[1:15:02] the devil
[1:15:04] he's just a tool in the hand of god
[1:15:06] you know
[1:15:07] the devil do things and think oh i'm
[1:15:09] taking care of that person now and all
[1:15:11] their all he's doing is just taking that
[1:15:12] child of god and putting them back where
[1:15:14] they're supposed to be amen amen well
[1:15:16] that's the whole premise of this story
[1:15:18] isn't it
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:20] it's been all he had he began to be in
[1:15:22] one there came a famine in the land
[1:15:25] he went and joined himself to a citizen
[1:15:27] of that country went and sent him who
[1:15:29] went and sent him in the fields to feed
[1:15:31] swine which is the nastiest lowest
[1:15:34] worst job you can have anybody ever slot
[1:15:37] pigs
[1:15:38] you slapped pigs yeah i should know
[1:15:42] yeah southern people
[1:15:43] that's kind of a thing we did a lot of
[1:15:45] times i saw pigs it's nasty
[1:15:48] filthy pigs eat their own excrement and
[1:15:51] everything it's just gross
[1:15:53] the pig pigpen is one of the nastiest
[1:15:55] things i've ever been in my life
[1:15:58] just smells and they just wallow in it
[1:16:01] and
[1:16:03] i'm sorry i don't mean to be disgusting
[1:16:05] but they'll poop and pee and just roll
[1:16:06] right over in it
[1:16:08] and just flop flop around around and
[1:16:10] just love it they just love it
[1:16:13] and slopping them pigs this is just
[1:16:15] nasty it's a really disgusting thing if
[1:16:17] you've never done it i don't recommend
[1:16:20] it but it's a nasty uh sloppy pig that's
[1:16:23] what he's doing here
[1:16:24] this citizen of the country has sent him
[1:16:26] out to do the most disgusting thing in
[1:16:28] the most disgusting place and anything
[1:16:31] all the devil's saying oh i'll get him
[1:16:32] doing this and he'll really be
[1:16:34] distraught no it just
[1:16:36] what it did was this
[1:16:38] he began to realize 16th first that he
[1:16:41] would fain have filled his belly with
[1:16:43] the hust that the swine did eat and no
[1:16:46] man gave to him
[1:16:48] amen no man can you imagine
[1:16:51] passing by nobody having compassion on
[1:16:53] this man
[1:16:54] praise the lord god knows how to soften
[1:16:56] a heart god knows how to harden the
[1:16:58] heart
[1:16:59] he sent moses to pharaoh and he hardened
[1:17:02] pharaoh's heart
[1:17:04] maybe god hardened every one of these
[1:17:06] people's heart not to give this boy
[1:17:07] anything
[1:17:09] nobody gave him anything
[1:17:12] and when he came to himself
[1:17:15] praise the lord
[1:17:16] all that
[1:17:18] the devices of the enemy
[1:17:21] the nastiness that satan had put him in
[1:17:24] all it did was drive him back to who he
[1:17:26] was
[1:17:28] he came to himself so what does that
[1:17:30] mean
[1:17:32] if he came to himself
[1:17:34] that means that where he was was not in
[1:17:37] his right position
[1:17:39] it was not in his we'll even say right
[1:17:41] mind he may not have been mentally
[1:17:43] unstable i don't mean that but he wasn't
[1:17:45] in his right mind right position of who
[1:17:48] he was called to be
[1:17:51] boy you are the son of that leader that
[1:17:54] king
[1:17:55] that's who you are
[1:17:57] and he fell from that position and he
[1:18:00] was ready to stick his face in with that
[1:18:02] nasty disgusting slop of the hog
[1:18:06] when he came to himself
[1:18:09] praise the lord
[1:18:11] he realized
[1:18:13] my daddy
[1:18:15] has servants
[1:18:17] has land
[1:18:19] has cattle
[1:18:20] has houses
[1:18:22] my daddy owns it all
[1:18:25] praise it if you will
[1:18:27] my daddy owns it all papa god owns it
[1:18:30] all
[1:18:31] right
[1:18:32] and i'm sitting here in the slop of this
[1:18:34] pen
[1:18:36] eating out of this worldly slop
[1:18:39] oh my i believe that's where we were we
[1:18:42] come to ourselves maybe in a
[1:18:44] denomination
[1:18:46] head long face deep in that mess
[1:18:49] right when you came to yourself and said
[1:18:51] i'm this is not me
[1:18:53] this is not who i was born to be
[1:18:55] this is not revealed to me that i'm a
[1:18:58] child of the king
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:01] and he came to himself that means at
[1:19:04] that time he wasn't himself
[1:19:06] when he left when he spent all his money
[1:19:08] when he lived ungodly that wasn't him
[1:19:13] because he never was not a son he was
[1:19:15] always a son
[1:19:18] he didn't stop being this man's son when
[1:19:20] he ran away
[1:19:22] he didn't stop being this man's son when
[1:19:24] he was face deep in that hog swap
[1:19:27] he was never not a son
[1:19:31] i know i've said that many times friend
[1:19:33] but to me that's pure goal
[1:19:37] to realize no matter where you've been
[1:19:39] what you've done what you've gone
[1:19:40] through
[1:19:41] run
[1:19:42] hide whatever you try you can never
[1:19:45] escape
[1:19:47] the fact of who you are amen amen yes
[1:19:51] i'm a child of the king yes
[1:19:54] praise the lord he came to himself and
[1:19:56] he said how many heart servants of my
[1:19:58] fathers have bread enough and to spare
[1:20:01] but i'll perish with hunger
[1:20:04] i will arise to go to my father well say
[1:20:06] unto him father i have sinned against
[1:20:08] heaven and before thee he humbled
[1:20:10] himself
[1:20:11] amen he found a place of humility he
[1:20:14] found an altar somewhere which is your
[1:20:16] heart
[1:20:17] amen may not be down at the church there
[1:20:20] the pulpit or something the altar is in
[1:20:22] your heart yes he found that altar
[1:20:25] he found that space of repentance
[1:20:28] and he came to himself and recognized my
[1:20:31] father
[1:20:33] and he was really
[1:20:34] who his father was he was willing to
[1:20:36] repent
[1:20:38] he was willing to leave behind the world
[1:20:41] behind everything that he had
[1:20:44] suffered the past time period he was
[1:20:46] gone
[1:20:47] he was willing to leave it all behind
[1:20:50] and come to his father and i'm no more
[1:20:53] worthy to be called thy son
[1:20:56] make me as one of the hard servants he
[1:20:58] arose came to his father but when he was
[1:21:00] a great way off his father saw him and
[1:21:02] had compassion and ran and fell on his
[1:21:04] neck and kissed him
[1:21:07] since the son said unto him father i
[1:21:10] have sinned against god heaven
[1:21:12] and in thy sight
[1:21:14] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[1:21:17] sons
[1:21:18] you know what his daddy was doing
[1:21:21] oh would you say something
[1:21:25] his daddy could have cared less
[1:21:27] that little
[1:21:28] that little exhortation he gave his
[1:21:30] daddy was like
[1:21:32] went right through him
[1:21:34] his daddy wasn't concerned about that
[1:21:36] why because his son was home that's all
[1:21:38] he cared about
[1:21:39] he didn't care oh daddy maybe you're one
[1:21:41] of your hired servants no no no you're
[1:21:43] my son
[1:21:45] i don't care what you did i don't care
[1:21:47] where you've been i don't care what
[1:21:48] you're going through you're my son
[1:21:51] so whatever this young man said
[1:21:54] uh
[1:21:55] i've sinned against heaven against in
[1:21:57] and in thy sight and nowhere nor more
[1:21:59] worthy to be called thy sons
[1:22:01] dad couldn't care less about that
[1:22:04] what did the father respond but the
[1:22:05] father said to his servants
[1:22:08] bring forth the best robe and put it on
[1:22:11] him put a ring on his hand and shoes on
[1:22:13] his feet bring heather the fatted calf
[1:22:15] and kill it and let us eat and be
[1:22:17] married for this my son was dead and is
[1:22:20] alive again he was lost and is found and
[1:22:24] they begin to be married look at this
[1:22:27] as i close here in just a minute he said
[1:22:29] for this my son
[1:22:31] praise the lord
[1:22:33] he designated he recognized and he made
[1:22:37] sure the entire kingdom
[1:22:39] heard and understood this is my son
[1:22:44] praise the lord jesus
[1:22:47] he's not an
[1:22:49] astray vessel he's my son
[1:22:52] he came to himself and he realized he
[1:22:54] was my son
[1:22:56] and now he's here and he's still my son
[1:22:59] when he was out there he was still my
[1:23:01] son
[1:23:02] he's here now and he's still my son
[1:23:05] and he's letting the whole kingdom know
[1:23:07] this is my son
[1:23:10] he was dead
[1:23:11] but now he's alive now look at this it
[1:23:13] says again
[1:23:15] now i'm not going to read the rest of
[1:23:16] the story the father says that twice he
[1:23:20] was dead but he's alive
[1:23:22] again
[1:23:24] so that means he was here at one time
[1:23:28] praise the lord he was in the position
[1:23:31] that he was supposed to be who he was
[1:23:34] born to be at one time and he fell from
[1:23:37] that place
[1:23:39] just like people who become dead in
[1:23:41] their trespasses and sins
[1:23:43] it's a spiritual death
[1:23:46] but now he's alive again
[1:23:49] he has come to himself and he has
[1:23:52] realized who he was born to be
[1:23:56] and now he's come back home
[1:23:58] and now we're going to kill the fatted
[1:24:00] cat we're gonna put a ring on his finger
[1:24:02] we're gonna put shoes on his feet and
[1:24:04] we're gonna celebrate and have and be
[1:24:06] merry and have a celebration because my
[1:24:08] son who was lost is now found
[1:24:12] he came back to himself
[1:24:14] he was lost but see the the man he never
[1:24:18] went hunting for we don't see anywhere
[1:24:20] where the man went hunting for his son
[1:24:22] we don't see anywhere in here where he
[1:24:24] compelled somebody or something else or
[1:24:26] whatever
[1:24:27] god just this man which i believe of
[1:24:30] course the representation of the lord
[1:24:32] and us
[1:24:33] this man just let his son go
[1:24:37] he just let him go
[1:24:38] here it is
[1:24:40] just go
[1:24:41] knowing having faith believing that's
[1:24:44] not who he is
[1:24:46] amen that out there is not who he is
[1:24:49] amen this right here is who he is
[1:24:51] because he's my son
[1:24:53] amen he doesn't belong to the devil
[1:24:55] he belongs to me he's mine praise the
[1:24:58] lord
[1:24:59] don't belong to the world belongs to me
[1:25:01] amen praise the lord
[1:25:03] and the stand that this man took and the
[1:25:06] word that it was told
[1:25:08] it just took faith
[1:25:10] and that's all we can have today that's
[1:25:12] all we can believe today
[1:25:13] because every one of us in some way at
[1:25:16] some time in some capacity has tried to
[1:25:19] run from god
[1:25:21] every one of us have yes except maybe
[1:25:24] the little bit i'm not sure emma's tried
[1:25:26] that but alice but almost every one of
[1:25:29] us adults
[1:25:32] at one point in time in our lives
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] people say oh when i was out in the
[1:25:37] world i got myself in a mess you can't
[1:25:40] get yourself in such a mess that god
[1:25:41] can't take care of it
[1:25:43] amen oh there may be residual effects
[1:25:46] from that but god's able to take care of
[1:25:48] that
[1:25:50] god's able to make take every wrong
[1:25:52] every mistake that you make and he's
[1:25:54] able to turn around and make it right
[1:25:57] and make it to work together for our
[1:25:59] good evening
[1:26:01] praise the lord
[1:26:05] it's just
[1:26:07] sometimes
[1:26:09] unfathomable
[1:26:11] to believe
[1:26:13] how
[1:26:16] loving and merciful and kind and giving
[1:26:18] that god is
[1:26:20] and how much he loves his children yes
[1:26:23] you know man has been trying to run from
[1:26:25] the presence of god since the beginning
[1:26:27] of time
[1:26:29] in the garden of eden when sin first
[1:26:31] entered what did adam do he hid
[1:26:34] well he thought he could hide
[1:26:36] amen he got in the bushes anyway
[1:26:40] him and his wife
[1:26:42] who wasn't named eve at the time the
[1:26:43] woman right hid in the bush or they
[1:26:45] tried to hide they tried to run from god
[1:26:48] and men have been trying to do that ever
[1:26:50] since
[1:26:52] we talked about jonah the other day
[1:26:54] how many times
[1:26:56] have men in the bible that we see
[1:26:58] abraham try to run from god
[1:27:02] but god always has a way
[1:27:04] god always makes a way because you know
[1:27:07] what there's something that's down in
[1:27:08] there that cries out that says this is
[1:27:12] not who i was born to be
[1:27:14] this is not who i'm supposed to be i'm a
[1:27:18] child of god
[1:27:20] i don't belong here this is not my
[1:27:22] heritage
[1:27:23] i'm a child of god
[1:27:26] and god makes a way and takes care of in
[1:27:28] our lives to bring us back to where
[1:27:30] we're supposed to be because he's a
[1:27:32] gentleman
[1:27:34] god's a gentleman
[1:27:35] he never forces himself on anybody yes
[1:27:38] he never makes you do anything and he's
[1:27:40] not going to now
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:43] but thank god that through him we can
[1:27:46] have faith and trust to believe
[1:27:49] that god's taking care of god's hand in
[1:27:52] every situation
[1:27:53] amen god's handling
[1:27:56] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:28:06] we need to make sure we continually ask
[1:28:08] ourselves is is my life pleasing to the
[1:28:11] lord
[1:28:12] is the way i'm living my life is how i'm
[1:28:15] acting what i'm doing
[1:28:17] is that pleasing to the lord am i is
[1:28:19] that something that god would be happy
[1:28:22] with
[1:28:25] unfortunately too many people
[1:28:27] they don't read the word they don't know
[1:28:29] what's pleasing to god
[1:28:31] all they do is
[1:28:32] hear what some man tells them and i've
[1:28:35] told you here many many times you don't
[1:28:37] go by what i say
[1:28:38] you go about what this says
[1:28:41] i'm going to do everything within my
[1:28:42] power saints to stay within the pages of
[1:28:45] this book of this book this bible this
[1:28:47] sacred word
[1:28:49] amen but don't take my word for it you
[1:28:51] read it for yourself
[1:28:53] amen amen your relationships not between
[1:28:57] with god is not me him and
[1:29:00] me you and him it's you and him
[1:29:03] amen you don't take brother branham's
[1:29:05] word for it
[1:29:06] you find it in here yes
[1:29:08] amen let god reveal it to him
[1:29:12] you're his child he'll show you
[1:29:15] he'll reveal it to you he'll let you
[1:29:16] know
[1:29:17] amen you say well i don't understand
[1:29:19] this
[1:29:19] just put it on the shelf
[1:29:21] close it up just put that thing on the
[1:29:23] shelf and say lord it's just gonna stay
[1:29:25] there
[1:29:26] at some point in time lord if you feel
[1:29:28] fit to reveal it to me and brother
[1:29:29] graham said he'll reveal it to you when
[1:29:31] you have need of knowing it okay
[1:29:33] and then the lord and you might be
[1:29:35] reading something listening to a tape
[1:29:36] reading the scripture and god will just
[1:29:38] open that up to you and say oh my you
[1:29:40] take that thing off the shelf and you
[1:29:41] put it right in here you said there it
[1:29:43] is
[1:29:44] amen that's it
[1:29:46] and then god makes it all dovetail
[1:29:48] that's why so many people denominations
[1:29:50] people they want to try to discard or or
[1:29:54] or get rid of certain things in the
[1:29:55] scripture because it doesn't dovetail
[1:29:57] with their doctrine right it doesn't
[1:29:59] dovetail with their beliefs it doesn't
[1:30:01] doubt even in the message people take
[1:30:04] things that quotes brother brown they'll
[1:30:05] just dismiss them and say oh well they
[1:30:07] just dismiss him because it doesn't
[1:30:09] dovetail with what their doctrine is
[1:30:12] with what their belief is
[1:30:14] but this word dovetails genesis 1 to
[1:30:16] revelation 22 and ain't one single word
[1:30:18] out of line amen because this is christ
[1:30:21] in letter form
[1:30:23] amen and we believe it
[1:30:25] praise the lord we believe it and hold
[1:30:27] to it let's sing this

[1:38:06] is in the room
[1:38:07] so just
[1:38:09] go to the room and
