[4:26] late hour where we're living and who we
[4:28] are and you God we commit ourselves to
[4:30] you and ask your blessings on it now in
[4:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[4:34] amen god bless you have your Bibles now
[4:37] we're gonna turn over to Romans chapter
[4:40] 4 and begin our scripture reading there
[4:44] the last two Sundays as you know we
[4:46] spoke on justification and we got into
[4:50] some specific things about justification
[4:52] and some things that brother Branham
[4:53] talked about and as I mentioned to you a
[4:55] couple of weeks ago even even last week
[4:57] that we were going to try to get this
[4:59] subject to take us to our Easter Sunday
[5:02] so ender in our scripture reading for
[5:05] today so I mean let's go to this
[5:07] scripture Romans chapter 4 let's see
[5:10] we're gonna begin reading with verse 20
[5:12] now amen says he staggered not at the
[5:16] promise of God through unbelief but was
[5:19] strong in faith giving glory to God and
[5:21] being fully persuaded that what he had
[5:24] promised he was also able also to
[5:27] perform and therefore it was imputed to
[5:30] him for righteousness course you know
[5:33] talking about Abraham now it was not
[5:35] written for his sake alone that it was
[5:37] imputed to him
[5:39] but for us also amen so that includes us
[5:42] and includes me and you for it so it is
[5:46] for us too it's written for our second
[5:48] alone but for us also to whom it shall
[5:51] be imputed if we believe on him that
[5:54] raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead
[5:58] the beautiful day that we celebrate
[5:59] every Sunday but especially on this
[6:02] Easter Sunday who was delivered for our
[6:04] offenses and was raised again for our
[6:08] justification Amen there's that word
[6:11] that justification that we'd been
[6:12] talking about and I want to of course
[6:14] spend the time a little bit on that last
[6:16] verse of 25th verse we go back into
[6:19] Abraham and talk about him for the
[6:21] but we all know the story of Abraham the
[6:23] faith that Abraham had and how it was
[6:25] imputed to him for righteousness
[6:27] through his faith and belief in God and
[6:29] that same imputation that God has to us
[6:32] that we can have that we could have that
[6:36] as the Lord has raised from the dead he
[6:39] was delivered now look at this the 25th
[6:41] verse I want to focus on now who was
[6:45] delivered for our offenses so what does
[6:48] that mean means that if he was delivered
[6:51] that means he was offered up he was
[6:53] given to now there's a specific person
[6:57] that that offered him up because Jesus
[7:02] himself said I have the power to lay my
[7:05] life down and I have the power to raise
[7:08] it up again
[7:08] he said if I called 12 legions of angels
[7:11] they would come and take me off of this
[7:13] cross they would deliver me from this
[7:16] persecution that he was going through
[7:18] but he was delivered delivered means
[7:22] that he was given over it means that it
[7:25] was somebody that brought unto something
[7:28] to somebody so he was delivered for our
[7:31] offenses amen remember I over in Isaiah
[7:35] 53 the Bible says in Isaiah 53 there
[7:38] priyad that it pleased God to bruise
[7:42] Jesus so what do you think this
[7:44] delivering came from God God's making a
[7:48] way so that we could be delivered of our
[7:51] offenses of our sins now that offenses
[7:54] same word that goes back to Matthew
[7:56] chapter 6 when it talks about forgive
[7:58] our trespasses forgive our sins forgive
[8:00] our debts forgive our offenses those are
[8:04] the same things the same words used
[8:06] Greek same derivative anyway the same
[8:08] root word of offense is sin
[8:11] it's unbelief so Jesus was delivered he
[8:16] was given up offered up for our sins for
[8:20] our fences for our trespasses and was
[8:23] raised again for our justification so as
[8:27] he was offered then he was raised praise
[8:30] the Lord we know he was raised on the
[8:32] third day as the Bible says
[8:34] is not the sufferers Holy One to see
[8:36] corruption so he had to raise before
[8:38] that corruption said it on a fourth day
[8:40] he's raised on the third day but he was
[8:42] raised for our justification
[8:45] so that raising of Jesus Christ coming
[8:48] up from the dead was to bring about in
[8:50] our lives a state of justification or a
[8:53] state of righteousness or a place of as
[8:56] we ought to be as we talked about with
[8:59] justification being justified as being
[9:01] righteous is putting that into our into
[9:05] our lives where it never happened in the
[9:07] first place if you're justified it never
[9:09] happened in the first place so if it
[9:11] never happened that puts you in a place
[9:13] of righteousness well that's not our
[9:15] righteousness that's his of course but
[9:17] that a place of righteousness is where
[9:19] we should be is that place God sauce
[9:22] again in his mind well Jesus was raised
[9:24] for our justification praise the Lord
[9:27] came back sent back the holy spirit he
[9:30] was raised for justice to send back the
[9:31] holy spirit so he could be born again
[9:33] fill with his spirit but it started
[9:36] again with him raising from the dead for
[9:39] our justification and justification he
[9:42] was delivered for our sins but then he
[9:44] was raised again to justify those sins
[9:47] to annihilate those sins
[9:49] I felt it be a little better today not
[9:52] to have the board you could remember the
[9:54] thing is there on the website if you
[9:56] want to print it out the little
[9:57] illustration that I gave but some people
[10:00] thought that my little 15-20 minute
[10:06] blurbs during the week it was a little
[10:07] better to have a little closer up so
[10:09] don't know why anybody won't see me
[10:10] closer up but that's okay so we just
[10:13] deal without the board today but you can
[10:15] think in your mind in the board you can
[10:17] think in your mind that picture that
[10:18] graph that we have of him raising again
[10:22] and justifying us so when Jesus raised
[10:27] from the dead it brought a justification
[10:29] to humanity and again remember that
[10:32] justification is only effective if
[10:35] someone accepts it that justification is
[10:37] only good if someone receives it if they
[10:40] believe it and they accept it for
[10:41] themselves that's why we have to come up
[10:44] their own free will that's why we have
[10:46] to come again
[10:47] Sol has to come of its own free will its
[10:50] own free decision God doesn't force
[10:53] anybody to serve Him God doesn't force
[10:55] anybody to love him he wants us to love
[10:57] him freely Amen just like I believe we
[11:01] too want in our lives people to love us
[11:04] of their own free will not to be forced
[11:07] into it don't want my children to be
[11:09] forced into loving me I want my
[11:11] grandchildren to be forced into loving
[11:12] me I want them to love me because they
[11:14] wanna love me because it's in their
[11:16] heart because it's their desire to want
[11:19] to love me that's what Jesus God wants
[11:21] to be loved of their own free will
[11:22] that's our own free will but
[11:24] justification brought Jesus raising
[11:27] brought justification to humanity so
[11:30] anyone that decides they want to receive
[11:33] it anybody that decides they want to
[11:35] take that justification for themselves
[11:37] can oh you see the many services today
[11:41] of course it's going on in the
[11:42] justification of the are the Easter
[11:45] services it's happening all over the
[11:46] world today through Christians and
[11:48] through this most holy time that we have
[11:51] here today but it has to come with the
[11:54] understanding that justification laid
[11:57] that foundation without Jesus raising
[12:00] from the dead that foundation could have
[12:01] never been laid so that foundation was
[12:04] laid he made a way for us to be able to
[12:07] enter into that now let's go over to
[12:09] first Corinthians I want to read here
[12:12] first Corinthians 15 beginning with
[12:15] verse 12
[12:16] first Corinthians 15:12 I got the same
[12:19] audience I did last week my wife and my
[12:21] son I appreciate them both being here it
[12:24] makes a little bit better a little bit
[12:27] different but thankful that they're here
[12:30] to be here with us today now 1st
[12:33] Corinthians chapter 4 15 let's begin
[12:36] with verse 12 Paul speaking let's see if
[12:40] I get that right first yeah 1512 miss a
[12:45] little pulpit would be nice to have
[12:46] something a little bit higher here if
[12:48] you have anything let me know probably
[12:50] be here imagine we're going to probably
[12:52] do this
[12:53] more times at least the stay in order
[12:56] stay in place order is I guess till the
[12:59] end of the month but anyway now first
[13:01] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 12 now with
[13:04] Christ be priest list of this real close
[13:07] now if Christ be preached that he rose
[13:10] from the dead how say some among you
[13:14] that there is no resurrection of the
[13:16] dead now Paul was very familiar with
[13:18] this for the of this event because he
[13:23] was a Pharisee he talked about living to
[13:25] the very letter of being a Pharisee he
[13:28] was the Pharisee of Pharisees and the
[13:30] Pharisees believed in the resurrection
[13:32] the Sadducees however did not they would
[13:35] come and try to trick Jesus many times
[13:37] with questions about things in the
[13:40] resurrection and and also the Sadducees
[13:43] didn't believe so when Paul standing
[13:44] here talking about the resurrection he's
[13:46] talking about a tomb of the knowledge of
[13:48] things that he had known and studied for
[13:50] a long time but realizing he was
[13:52] speaking to people who may not believe
[13:54] that and his question is now if Christ
[13:56] be preached that he rose from the dead
[13:58] so if they're gonna believe that Jesus
[14:00] rose from the dead I will say some among
[14:03] you that there is no resurrection of the
[14:05] dead I can have no belief that there's
[14:09] not a resurrection of the Dead but
[14:10] believe that Jesus rose from the dead it
[14:13] just it just defies common sense of
[14:16] course but if there be no resurrection
[14:18] of the dead then is Christ not risen and
[14:23] if Christ be not risen then is our
[14:26] preaching vain and your faith is also
[14:29] vain yay and we are found false
[14:33] witnesses of God because we have
[14:36] testified of God that he raised up
[14:38] Christ whom he raised it not up if so be
[14:42] that we that the dead rise not so now
[14:45] he's including everybody else now he's
[14:48] saying well if Jesus didn't race then
[14:50] what hope do the rest of us have if
[14:53] Jesus didn't raise from the dead then
[14:55] how are any of the rest of us expecting
[14:57] how are any of those that have that have
[14:59] fallen asleep they had fallen asleep in
[15:01] the Lord how are we how are they
[15:03] expected to raise
[15:05] the dead how are they expected to
[15:06] receive a life a new life at that point
[15:10] if so be that the dead rise not for if
[15:14] the dead rise not then is not Christ
[15:17] race so if Christ wasn't raised if the
[15:20] dead in Christ aren't going to race how
[15:22] is Christ raised the only reason the
[15:25] dead in Christ can't race is because
[15:26] Christ already risen he's risen to bring
[15:29] our justification so that the rest of us
[15:31] can be raised as well when Jesus came up
[15:34] he conquered death Ellen the grave and
[15:38] Paul's making this point and if Christ
[15:40] be not risen your faith is vain and ye
[15:44] are yet in your sins see here now now I
[15:48] know he was offered for our offenses but
[15:50] remember he was raised for our
[15:52] justification and Paul is saying now
[15:55] then they which are excuse me and if
[15:59] Christ be not raised your faith is vain
[16:03] ye are yet in your sins so if we're
[16:07] still in our sins Jesus didn't raise
[16:09] we're still on our sins because Jesus
[16:12] raised to justified us Jesus raised to
[16:15] take away those tens Jesus raised to
[16:18] erase all of those things again and we
[16:20] accept it receive it he raised her to
[16:23] erase everything about that all of the
[16:25] things in the past all the passengers
[16:28] remember justification is is is a is an
[16:31] annihilation of past sin is it though
[16:34] you never did it it is a perpetual
[16:35] working in your life of all the things
[16:38] that you're going to do we don't know we
[16:40] repent and die daily but we don't know
[16:43] but that justification still stays there
[16:45] because Jesus still stays there if Jesus
[16:48] isn't still there on the mercy seat then
[16:50] what hope do any of us have but if he's
[16:52] still there and that perpetual grace the
[16:54] perpetual existence of the raising of
[16:57] Jesus Christ continues to annihilate the
[17:00] sin or the unbelief that may come in our
[17:03] lives the little things that we may do
[17:04] wrong that's why we ask forgiveness
[17:06] that's why we repent that's why Paul
[17:10] said again I die daily because the
[17:12] sacrifice is still there it is still
[17:15] proven that
[17:16] risen and that risen nature has brought
[17:20] us into the place of justification so we
[17:22] can be a righteous group he became us
[17:28] that we might become him he took our sin
[17:31] that we might take on his righteousness
[17:34] he did that by raising from the dead and
[17:36] if he didn't raise if there is no
[17:38] resurrection then we are still in our
[17:42] sins our sins are still on us we we are
[17:46] without hope but we do believe that
[17:50] Jesus raised him and we believe that
[17:52] Jesus raised to justify us Jesus raised
[17:56] to wipe our slate clean to annihilate
[17:59] all of those sins listen them if Christ
[18:02] be not raised your faith is vain and ye
[18:04] are yet in your sins God help us but we
[18:07] believe these risen amen then they also
[18:10] which are fallen asleep in Christ are
[18:13] perished and all of those that will fall
[18:16] asleep in Christ will perish well hope
[18:19] is that what faith is there in the
[18:23] believing or thinking as a Christian
[18:26] that that's the end of it all there's no
[18:30] hope in that if Jesus didn't race and
[18:34] the rest of us won't race we can't but
[18:37] because he raised we raised with him
[18:40] amen if if in this life only we have
[18:44] hope in Christ listen this and and Lord
[18:47] will and I may have a little of
[18:50] sermonette if you will I'm not exactly
[18:53] sure what to call him yet next week
[18:55] during the week to bring to you on this
[18:59] - but listeners I'm trying not to get to
[19:02] that part because I want to stay on this
[19:03] subject and not keep it too long today
[19:05] but maybe you're celebrating a home
[19:08] hopefully your home maybe families come
[19:11] over I don't know that just it want to
[19:14] keep you too long to this beautiful
[19:15] Easter today but look now if in this
[19:19] life only we have hope in Christ and
[19:22] what is this life anyway what what is
[19:27] what is the meaning to this life
[19:29] this life is so temporal it's like a
[19:32] vapor I think James said it's you look
[19:35] at a boiling pot you see a vapor come up
[19:38] and it's there and it's gone
[19:40] but Paul says if we have hope in this
[19:43] only we have hope in Christ in this life
[19:45] only we are all men most miserable we're
[19:50] a miserable people if the only hope we
[19:52] have is the things that we see around in
[19:54] this world today or if we can't believe
[19:58] that Jesus if people can't believe that
[20:00] Jesus rose from the dead that he rose to
[20:02] bring justification in our lives that we
[20:04] - as we died in him our Rosina rising
[20:08] again in him then what hope - any of us
[20:10] have we have the hope of salvation we
[20:13] have the hope of justification because
[20:15] of what he's done we're still sinners
[20:17] we're still lost and dead in our sins if
[20:19] he did not raise but he raised so the
[20:22] dica justify us now look at an absolute
[20:25] let me read this in the absolute this is
[20:29] December 1963 Romans 5:1 therefore being
[20:35] justified by faith we have peace with
[20:38] God through our Lord Jesus Christ we
[20:41] find out I believe that we find out that
[20:44] he is our justification
[20:46] amen he is our justification God raised
[20:49] him up on the third day to justify our
[20:52] faith we are justified by faith
[20:55] remember the justification didn't come
[20:57] by works didn't come by the law came by
[20:59] faith we are justified by the faith
[21:02] alone so he came to justify our faith
[21:06] that we believe it and he raised him up
[21:08] to justify our faith what did he do then
[21:12] he sent him back the justifier because
[21:15] our faith believes it so we believe it I
[21:19] didn't see it none of us here in this
[21:22] room saw it I'm sure none of you helped
[21:23] air saw we didn't see it but we believe
[21:26] it we believe it happened because it's
[21:28] by faith that we believe it yes others
[21:31] did see it yes others did see Jesus
[21:33] after the resurrection before the
[21:35] Ascension yes there was people that
[21:37] spend time with him of course it's
[21:39] recorded in this Holy Bible that we read
[21:41] and we believe
[21:43] we have to believe it by faith you say
[21:46] well this one said and this one said it
[21:48] well we got to have faith to believe
[21:49] that what they're saying is true is
[21:52] still either way it's by faith so we
[21:55] believe that by faith and that way our
[21:57] faith is justified because our faith
[21:59] believes it see the Holy Spirit Christ
[22:03] come into it
[22:04] for our justification because we have
[22:07] raised from the dead from death unto
[22:10] life amen and we'll talk about that for
[22:14] a little bit but we got another
[22:16] scripture but let me finish this first
[22:18] so we raised because we have we have
[22:21] amen now since he's raised because he's
[22:23] raised he's justified us he raised to
[22:27] justify us because we've been justified
[22:29] now we were dead in our sins are now
[22:31] made alive because he annihilated the
[22:34] sin justified raised from death unto
[22:36] life now we are the sons and daughters
[22:39] of God sitting in heavenly places in
[22:42] Christ Jesus Amen you know program said
[22:45] that's the place of adoption to the
[22:47] Christian the place that there ought to
[22:49] be conditioned that place of heavenly
[22:52] places is that place of righteousness
[22:55] where we set with Christ in those
[22:57] heavenly places and our adopted position
[23:01] in the placement that God put us in well
[23:04] first of course we're sons and daughters
[23:06] of God but we operate in those heavenly
[23:08] places on a perpetual basis because God
[23:12] has placed us in that situation he has
[23:14] put us in her ought to be conditioned
[23:16] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[23:18] Jesus justified us by His resurrection
[23:23] amen justified us by his resurrection
[23:26] aren't you thankful the Holy Ghost will
[23:29] always point to the word if it points to
[23:32] a creed or denomination it is not the
[23:34] Holy Ghost he couldn't do that point
[23:37] away from his word when he died to
[23:40] confirm that word and make that word a
[23:42] positive he died so he could come ain't
[23:47] man himself into the word he is the
[23:50] quickening life that makes
[23:52] the word live again so when he died and
[23:54] rose again sent back the spirit that
[23:57] quickening power to live in us by the
[24:00] word in us to bring life that quickening
[24:03] life that makes the word live again that
[24:07] was his purpose of dying that he could
[24:10] still project himself through his bride
[24:12] and every and make every word though
[24:16] through every age at just exactly the
[24:19] way it's supposed to act
[24:21] he is the dynamics Amen Holy Spirit
[24:25] Christ is the dynamics of the mechanics
[24:28] the mechanics - the church is what
[24:30] apostles prophets teachers so forth he
[24:32] is the dynamics and that's the way it
[24:35] works and it's worked by a certain
[24:38] dynamic which is called like that he is
[24:41] the fire that fires off the gas he is
[24:44] the fire that's in the combustion
[24:46] chamber the gas the word is poured over
[24:49] the combustion chamber he is the one
[24:51] that sets her afire he is the one that
[24:53] confirms it he is the power he is the
[24:57] power of the Resurrection he is God he
[25:00] is the fire Amen without controversy
[25:03] said Timothy 3:16 great is the mystery
[25:07] of godliness for God was manifested in
[25:10] the flesh seen of angels received up
[25:12] into glory he was God come to take the
[25:16] sinners place yes sir
[25:18] God come to take the sinners place and
[25:22] when he God raised him up on the 3rd day
[25:25] was for our justification
[25:28] therefore exalted at the right hand of
[25:30] the Majesty on high he is the
[25:32] intercessor to make intercessions upon
[25:35] our weaknesses as we confess it to him
[25:38] and die out to ourselves placing his
[25:41] word back in us when when we die out to
[25:45] ourselves
[25:46] putting that word back in us the promise
[25:49] and our faith our faith makes that word
[25:53] live because Christ is in us the quicken
[25:56] ER to the word that makes the word live
[25:59] in us because we believe and the only
[26:02] way it can do that is because he raised
[26:05] two
[26:05] justify us and send his spirit back on
[26:08] us to quicken that word into our lives
[26:11] to quicken that word into our hearts now
[26:14] we are alive because he's alive and if
[26:17] we were to go by the way of the grace
[26:19] that quickening power still come back
[26:21] into that body one day and make it a
[26:24] perfect body a glorified body and raise
[26:26] it back up again I don't care if the
[26:28] elements of it are scattered out from
[26:30] here to China to Russia wherever it is
[26:32] God's gonna bring it all back together
[26:34] one day and bring that resurrection back
[26:36] to that place and friend I don't mind
[26:38] tell you I'm looking forward to that
[26:40] time amen you know the Bible says that's
[26:43] of course brother green taught us you
[26:45] know our loved ones will appear before
[26:47] us minimum of 30 days before we have the
[26:51] body change to go home and I'm looking
[26:53] forward to that resurrection to take us
[26:55] home looking forward to seeing my family
[26:57] again amen I'm starting to miss them
[27:01] more than ever now that my mom has
[27:03] passed I'm starting to miss my whole
[27:05] family more than more than I had before
[27:07] but I'm thankful God made away thankful
[27:11] that that Resurrection has taken place
[27:12] and God has made the way for each one of
[27:15] us to be raised in him now let's look at
[27:19] this raising in Romans chapter 6 will
[27:23] read first few first few verses here
[27:26] Romans Romans 6 chapter 1 now I want to
[27:32] get into another little part of this and
[27:34] recognize the the the resurrection and
[27:39] the resurrection on the Sunday not on a
[27:42] Saturday wasn't on the Sabbath it was on
[27:44] the Sunday first day of the week so
[27:46] we'll talk about that in just a minute
[27:48] I'm gonna get too much detail on it but
[27:50] just for a brief moment maybe we'll get
[27:53] to teaching of it a little bit another
[27:55] time
[27:56] Lord willing but Romans chapter 6 verse
[27:58] 1 says what shall we say then shall we
[28:02] continue in sin that grace may abound
[28:05] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[28:10] sin dead to sin
[28:11] any longer therein I remember there was
[28:14] a time when we were dead in our sins now
[28:17] after the conversion we are dead to sin
[28:21] they men there's a big difference in
[28:23] being dead in sin and being dead to sin
[28:26] that are dead to sin live any longer
[28:29] therein know ye not that so many of us
[28:33] as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[28:37] baptized into his death baptized into
[28:41] his death remember he was offered for
[28:44] our offenses he was given up at Calvary
[28:47] died the most cruel death a human ever
[28:50] died offered up so that so that and died
[28:56] so that we baptized in Jesus Christ were
[29:00] baptized into that death into that death
[29:04] therefore we are buried with him by
[29:07] baptism in death into death that like as
[29:11] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[29:13] the glory of the Father even so we also
[29:17] should walk in newness of life
[29:20] praise the Lord you ever thought of that
[29:22] in the new we walk now we walk by our
[29:26] mortal flesh we walk in the newness of
[29:29] life where that newness come from it
[29:32] comes from justification they come from
[29:35] annihilating all of my past sins not the
[29:37] same person I used to be anymore I don't
[29:39] bear those burdens anymore I don't bear
[29:40] those sins anymore they're gone and done
[29:43] away with we were buried with him in the
[29:45] baptism boot print of Christ and raised
[29:48] from the dead by the glory of God even
[29:50] so also we walk in the newness of life
[29:55] and you think about that newness not
[29:57] just for a few moments I want to read a
[29:59] few a few more verses here I got down to
[30:02] the twelfth verse but let's talk about
[30:04] that newness for a minute and walking in
[30:07] the newness of life what is that newness
[30:09] mean the newness is is is a new
[30:12] beginning it's a it's a something that
[30:15] is brand-new you could say it's a
[30:18] starting over but new
[30:21] isn't really starting over you know you
[30:26] can you can buy something that someone
[30:29] previously owned and its new to you but
[30:32] it's not new so when he's talking about
[30:36] a newness of life he's not talking about
[30:38] something that belonged to somebody that
[30:41] you now possess he's talking about
[30:44] something that to you is new it's the
[30:48] newness of life so it's something that
[30:50] is in our mortal lives not spiritual in
[30:53] our mortal lives of course it is a
[30:55] spirit but I'm not talking about a
[30:57] spirit spiritually man I'm talking about
[31:00] a physically minute something that
[31:02] happens in our flesh that we walk see
[31:05] what the word says we walk in the
[31:07] newness of life and where do you walk
[31:09] you walk in your flesh you walk in your
[31:11] body in a newness in something that is
[31:14] brand-new now something that comes
[31:17] brand-new how many times has we could
[31:21] say a new beginning if you will a new
[31:26] beginning and people always talk about
[31:28] having a new beginning or starting over
[31:30] or starting fresh or starting new again
[31:34] well that new is something that's that
[31:37] that's that is new to you we walk in the
[31:40] newness of life wood if you look at the
[31:43] resurrection think again how Jesus was
[31:47] raised on Sunday Sunday's not the
[31:50] Sabbath Sundays not the seventh day
[31:52] Sunday is the first day but if you go
[31:55] over listen to and if you want we're all
[31:59] home maybe if you have time it's a long
[32:02] one but if you want to take the time and
[32:04] I'll encourage you to listen to future
[32:06] home future home the heavenly bridegroom
[32:08] earthly bride it's a little over four
[32:11] hours long I think but you go home and
[32:13] listen to it you see where brother
[32:15] branham invokes in Leviticus 23 I
[32:18] believe it he's talking about the laws
[32:19] in the days and that and the
[32:22] convocations and the gatherings and the
[32:24] the holy times and the feast times and
[32:27] and when he talks about getting into
[32:30] when it talks about Leviticus 23 many
[32:33] goes through that one through seven day
[32:36] period that brother branham tight to the
[32:38] church ages that one through seven days
[32:41] was the church age is rolling over one
[32:44] one to seven is one day they did this
[32:46] this I told you let's go get to teaching
[32:48] in it but you go back and read it first
[32:50] day second day things always something
[32:52] through to the seventh day but then in
[32:54] Leviticus 23
[32:56] it goes over to an eighth day and it
[32:59] talks about having a holy convocation a
[33:01] holy gathering of people on an eighth
[33:04] day well what's an eighth day eighth day
[33:07] completely defies the pneumatics of the
[33:12] Bible the numerix of the Bible there is
[33:15] no eighth day God's not perfected in
[33:17] AIDS
[33:18] God's not completed AIDS he's perfected
[33:20] in threes he's completed sevens
[33:23] so that seven brought a completion when
[33:26] when that seventh brought a completion
[33:28] where does the eighth they come in well
[33:30] the eighth day or the first day or that
[33:32] son day amen we could say he's the Esso
[33:37] end day not just s you end day that son
[33:39] day was the beginning it was the newness
[33:43] it was the rolling over from time into
[33:46] eternity that a day of holy convocation
[33:49] is taking us from the seven church ages
[33:52] the 1st to the 7th there with those holy
[33:55] times in those feasts and and all over
[33:58] into a new day into a newness of life
[34:01] into a brand-new time and part of me if
[34:05] you will from the seven church ages
[34:07] rolling over at the end the bride age of
[34:10] course into the millennium there's a
[34:13] resurrection to take place to bring us
[34:16] all after the tribulation then the
[34:17] wedding supper of the Lamb
[34:19] into a millennium a day of of entering
[34:23] into perfect rest a day of entering into
[34:26] a newness not not the same old world not
[34:30] the same whole cosmos not the same old
[34:33] Church ages and living under those
[34:35] auspices but we're talking about living
[34:38] in a newness now that's just a type of
[34:41] it a type of this living
[34:43] newness of life is what we look forward
[34:45] to this is this is just a shell of
[34:49] what's to come this is just the
[34:51] beginning we're in the position now of
[34:54] receiving and living a newness of life
[34:55] which is just a shadow a shadow of a
[34:59] semblance of what's going to be when we
[35:01] get over there which is the notice the
[35:04] new beginning the the rolling over
[35:08] eternity rolling over again no more this
[35:11] cosmos no more this world we're talking
[35:14] about living to Jesus Christ and and and
[35:17] Christ the word being new creatures not
[35:20] just a newness of life here in this body
[35:22] but I'm talking about any brand-new body
[35:24] ain't no sickness no death no no what
[35:28] worried about loved ones going on or
[35:29] having aches or pains and and certainly
[35:32] not worried about any kind of
[35:34] coronavirus but a newness amen a newness
[35:38] of life look at this let's read the
[35:41] fourth verse again therefore we are
[35:42] buried with him by baptism into death
[35:45] that like as Christ was raised up from
[35:48] the dead by the glory of the Father even
[35:50] so we also should walk in newness of
[35:53] life amen
[35:54] Jesus was raised on a Sunday for a
[35:56] reason Saints he was raised on the first
[35:59] day for a reason he was raised to bring
[36:03] about an understanding that that eighth
[36:05] day is a new beginning
[36:07] it's a newness of life he began a new
[36:11] beginning and friend when this church a
[36:13] just roll over and time ends and gets
[36:16] into the Millennium of millenniums a
[36:19] thousand years a time period but that's
[36:20] the new beginning for us it's a it's a
[36:23] newness of life this is this is a shadow
[36:26] of it that we're living in now but that
[36:28] resurrection help us understand there's
[36:30] more to come this earth
[36:33] we read before visions one it is just
[36:38] the beginning that's just the
[36:40] downpayment it's just the earnest and
[36:42] we're standing here now and a newness of
[36:44] life in representation of what's going
[36:47] to take place of what's about to happen
[36:49] in our lives praise the Lord
[36:51] now I'm looking forward to that amen you
[36:54] know Bev and said a millennium all
[36:55] wrongs would be made
[36:56] there's a lot of not not a lot to talks
[36:58] about in the scripture about the
[37:00] Millennium brother branham doesn't talk
[37:02] with a whole lot about it but going to
[37:03] read look at the list of future home
[37:06] this week if you can it's just it's just
[37:09] tremendous and he talks about that
[37:11] rolling over and us going to our homes
[37:14] amen
[37:15] this is a shadow of but this is a shadow
[37:17] of it that we live we live in a newness
[37:20] of life because my old my old life is
[37:22] dead my old life is buried my old sins
[37:25] are done away remember that the quote we
[37:28] read last week buried done away with
[37:30] divorce out of memory even in God's even
[37:33] in God's mind even in God's memory let's
[37:36] move on that fifth verse for if we have
[37:38] been planted together in the likeness of
[37:40] his death we shall be also in the
[37:43] likeness of his resurrection he Menten
[37:46] he's perfect
[37:48] what are we amen if we're in the
[37:51] likeness of his resurrection what does
[37:52] that make us oh my knowing that this
[37:56] knowing this that our old man is
[37:59] crucified with him that the body of sin
[38:02] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[38:05] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[38:09] is freed from sin that's us how could a
[38:13] dead man sin
[38:15] if you dead to your sins how can you sin
[38:18] now what a brother man said the only one
[38:20] that can sin is a believer amen but
[38:23] they're dead to their sins how could a
[38:25] dead person sin now if we be dead with
[38:29] Christ we believe that we shall also
[38:31] live with him knowing that Christ being
[38:34] raised from the dead diet no more death
[38:37] has no more dominion over him
[38:41] who me you yeah oh Jesus Christ did it
[38:46] yeah but why was he raised why did he
[38:50] conquer death he'll only great why did
[38:52] he go through this so that we could - he
[38:56] made us more than conquerors born that
[39:00] he died he died unto sin once but in but
[39:04] in that he liveth he live
[39:06] to God likewise reckon ye also
[39:08] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[39:10] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[39:14] our Lord
[39:15] let us not sin there let not sin
[39:18] therefore reign we're in your mortal
[39:22] body that you should obey it in the
[39:25] lusts thereof remember still this body
[39:28] still the sticky nature that we still
[39:31] live with and still in this body we
[39:34] still live that but what are we we're
[39:35] now walking in the newness of life it's
[39:38] it's it's a starting over it's a new
[39:41] beginning place amen
[39:43] God has created for all of us we're
[39:45] sitting here listening to this and this
[39:49] creation that man has created and the
[39:52] things the abilities to be able to do
[39:54] this but don't get don't don't get
[39:56] comfortable staying home when we get
[39:59] back to normal once you're back in
[40:00] church again we still have to obey the
[40:03] word of gathering together so don't get
[40:05] too comfortable at home doing this now
[40:07] we may see where we go from here but
[40:10] don't get too comfortable with that
[40:11] let's read them let's read this quote
[40:14] here amen aren't you thankful of a new
[40:16] life the trial excuse me now the defense
[40:21] was the defense witness himself should
[40:24] know whether they are believers or not
[40:26] because he is the one that quickens the
[40:29] promise now how you going to get past
[40:32] that hot trial going on how you going to
[40:35] get past the Holy Spirit should know for
[40:38] he is the life that is in the word he's
[40:42] the one that quickens the word just like
[40:45] your spirit quickens your body and the
[40:47] body is quickened by the spirit you see
[40:49] we have on the board which we talked
[40:52] about see the the spirit quickens the
[40:55] body without the spirit the body is of
[40:58] no effect the body is dead and the word
[41:01] is dead without the spirit so the letter
[41:05] killeth right we know that Bible says
[41:08] the letter killeth the spirit giveth by
[41:09] it takes the spirit to bring forth the
[41:12] word to make it live
[41:14] he is the quicken er of that word which
[41:18] Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and
[41:20] drink my blood you have no life in you
[41:22] what is that that's his word amen we
[41:26] spiritually partake of the unfailing
[41:28] body Word of the Son of Man we don't
[41:31] feed on the things of the world we don't
[41:33] feed of the even the Christian
[41:36] activities of things out of the world
[41:37] we're feeding off of something that's
[41:40] fresh we're feeding off something that
[41:42] is real we're feeding off of the current
[41:44] present-day truth amen and that
[41:48] present-day truth is the unfailing body
[41:50] word of the Son of Man that word that we
[41:53] eat on that we feed on it's not a dead
[41:55] of Karen is raised raised from the dead
[41:58] and brings life brings new life it's not
[42:03] dead it's a new life he is the quicken
[42:05] ER that makes a life of that word he is
[42:08] the defense witness and defendant amen
[42:10] how are you going to get past that in
[42:12] this court to understand it very well
[42:16] like that he is the quicken ER of the
[42:18] word makes that word live is that word
[42:22] that comes alive in us and when that
[42:25] word is alive in us then everything else
[42:27] is dead but we're alive in the word amen
[42:31] living he loved me what's that Tongo
[42:34] living he loved me dying he saved me
[42:36] buried he carried my sins far away
[42:38] rising he justified freely he's coming
[42:42] again amen he's coming again he's coming
[42:45] to take us home to be with him st. John
[42:48] let's read this one more Scripture as I
[42:49] close here amen
[42:52] st. John chapter 5 amen st. John chapter
[42:57] 5 verses 20 we'll begin reading with
[42:59] verse 24 remember Jesus the Bible says
[43:03] Jesus appeared unto many the love the
[43:06] ones that Jesus brought with and they
[43:08] went into the city and appeared unto
[43:10] many doesn't say they appeared unto all
[43:13] who did they appear to I believe they
[43:16] appeared - just like they are going to
[43:18] appear in this day I believe they appear
[43:21] to those who believe those who are
[43:23] looking for those who want to
[43:25] save it if I'm looking for my son or my
[43:28] dad or mom whatever if I'm looking I
[43:30] believe that's gonna read I'm gonna
[43:32] receive that that's what I'm looking to
[43:33] I'm not just looking to the things of
[43:37] the world this is my home anyway but I'm
[43:39] looking to the things that are beyond
[43:41] here and the more and the closer it gets
[43:43] the more the greater the pull gets and
[43:46] that pole gets greater and the more I
[43:48] start yearning for that the more it
[43:51] becomes real to us and that's where we
[43:54] are today the reality of it
[43:56] he appeared unto many yes but not
[43:58] everybody and in and when they come
[44:01] they're not gonna appear to everybody
[44:02] it's not gonna be it's gonna be like a
[44:05] thief in the night he's not gonna appear
[44:06] to everybody
[44:07] it's not gonna be planes crashing and
[44:09] cars crashing and things like it's gonna
[44:12] be like a thief and then it's gonna
[44:13] happen in people to be or this person go
[44:16] are there's no telling you know it's
[44:18] just gonna be a disappearance to me
[44:20] maybe natural catastrophe or something
[44:22] we don't know but we do know that it's
[44:24] gonna be as a thief in the night and and
[44:26] the people the world I don't know
[44:27] anything about it those people are gonna
[44:29] be we're gonna be gone off the earth and
[44:31] they're not gonna know anything about it
[44:32] but those loved ones are gonna appear on
[44:34] too many to those who believe it's not
[44:38] gonna appear to the unbeliever it's
[44:39] gonna appear to those who justify those
[44:41] who believed those who received now st.
[44:44] John 5:24 this look I read this very
[44:49] rarely I say unto you he that heareth my
[44:53] word and believeth on him that sent me
[44:55] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[44:58] into condemnation but is passed passed
[45:02] from death unto life barely barely I say
[45:06] unto you the hour is coming and now is
[45:07] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[45:09] the Son of God and they that hear shall
[45:12] live amen because he raised they raised
[45:16] also because he raised will raise also
[45:20] amen because of that justification that
[45:23] brings us from a passing from death unto
[45:27] life life life eternal life immortal the
[45:32] life that God gives the life that brings
[45:37] everlasting joy in life to us to God's
[45:42] bride together with him Amen aren't you
[45:45] glad he raised
[45:46] I'm thankful God raised from the dead
[45:48] he's raising from the dead you know he
[45:52] couldn't raised if he hadn't been born
[45:53] he couldn't been and and lived and and
[45:57] gave his life and died and was scourged
[46:00] and lived in this life and gave his life
[46:03] and died and rose again but he rose
[46:06] again so that he could bring
[46:08] justification to our lives forgiveness
[46:11] of sin that forgiveness of sin puts us
[46:14] in that position with him in our ought
[46:17] to be conditioned justified is it though
[46:20] we'd never done it we did that by
[46:22] raising all those who would believe all
[46:25] those who would receive hopefully maybe
[46:28] if somebody's watching this and you
[46:30] haven't received it receive it now now
[46:33] it's the time to do it now it's the time
[46:35] of salvation receive it because he
[46:37] raised for that purpose
[46:38] he raised so that your sins can be done
[46:41] away with
[46:42] he raised so that she could be in the
[46:44] place of righteousness with him he
[46:46] raised to take our place so that we can
[46:49] take his now we said in heavenly places
[46:52] with him in newness of life amen and a
[46:56] newness of life praise the Lord
[46:59] not the same man I used to be not the
[47:02] same people we used to be but were one
[47:04] in him and a newness of life we walk
[47:07] different we act different we talk
[47:09] different because we are different it's
[47:12] a new it is a brand new I never was like
[47:16] this before but it's a new new in him
[47:19] Amen thank God for raising Jesus from
[47:24] the dead and bringing that salvation to
[47:27] us bringing that justification to us so
[47:31] that we can know what it is to have our
[47:33] sins annihilated by the blood of Jesus

[49:00] couple of days some of you maybe not all
[49:05] of you know or remember a brother Dana
[49:07] thorn he'll he came to the tabernacle
[49:10] years ago he's a Border Patrol agent
[49:12] chaplain for the Border Patrol he came
[49:15] to the church one time and his Border
[49:17] Patrol vehicles and the kids all climbed
[49:19] it and he gave a little sermon about and
[49:23] showed a picture I think of like
[49:25] spaghetti and the relationship between a
[49:27] man and woman and things like that and
[49:29] he had been down in Sierra Vista of
[49:32] course Border Patrol and brother brother
[49:34] Robert Figueroa was his pastor and last
[49:37] time I was down there spoke brother
[49:38] Robert I got to see him and spend a
[49:40] little bit of time with him to talk to
[49:41] him but I have learned over the past
[49:44] couple of days that brother Dana has
[49:47] been arrested so I don't want to go into
[49:50] the details it sounds pretty serious but
[49:52] please pray for birthday and
[49:54] Tornillo I believe he was a man of God
[49:57] and just trust that all this is false
[49:59] somehow that all this will just wash out
[50:03] you know how the devil wants to trip any
[50:04] of us up and trick us up and and and
[50:07] even if some of the allegations are true
[50:09] whatever still the devil it's not my
[50:11] brother is still the devil but please
[50:13] pray for him I know he's going through a
[50:15] very hard time right now I believe it
[50:19] was Thursday he was arrested so down in
[50:22] serviced or Benson or with stone down
[50:24] there somewhere so please remember I'm
[50:28] con tried to contact brother Robert I
