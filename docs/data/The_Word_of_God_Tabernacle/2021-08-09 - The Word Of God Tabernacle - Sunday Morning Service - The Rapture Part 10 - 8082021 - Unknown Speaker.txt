your prayer your aim your goal your desire and i believe that the lord can fulfill that desire amen if you desire for them all you have to do is yield yourself to him amen you see today and a lot of what's going on in the world and there's a lot of yielding going on in the world today people yielding their uh opinions people yielding their feelings people yielding their freedoms they're yielding everything over to other kinds of entities and other kinds of gods and other governments and money and everything else they everybody yields everything to all everything else you know god made brother ram said god made a man to worship amen he would go out in the middle of jungles and find people worshiping and they were worshiping other gods son whatever but god made man to worship he made us to worship and he wanted us to worship him amen amen that's what he made us to worship him praise the lord so if you want to glorify the lord in your life then just yield your members to him build your mind yield your everything amen if you you want to yield your freedoms today over to something you know it was a comment about not this country not being shut down again yielded to him yielding to the lord amen because we're sheep we're lambs amen we're to be led and god wants us to be led by him praise the lord so let him be glorified in us today and you as an individual in this group of congregation let him be glorified let him be exalted and praised and worshipped amen so thankful the lord blessed us today another beautiful day amen and thankful to god's blessings to us uh i knew shariah had intended to be here in art and cara was going to come with her and her little girls and would have been a first time for them but uh i was really looking forward to seeing them but they had a little thing at the gas station so they weren't able to make it but maybe they are streaming as sister sheila said if you are god bless you but appreciate each one of you coming today and being here uh i've been asking for over a month for the landlord to get rid of the desk and he chooses at 10 30 on sunday morning to do it i i appreciate him doing it uh but of all times it was kind of uh strange you never know what people think and why it just it's just it's just hard to understand but you know it's like it's like the world today uh i was talking to the lord the other day and it was like it's like the other day uh it's like the world people can't see and can't live any more than what they are uh they fit themselves their lives their spirits you know our spirits dictate to our bodies as to how we live what we think that's right how we form our opinions and i look today and i see especially a lot of times college age and and younger and and how they're being molded shaped and and and i look at some of the attitudes and the dress and the ways that they present themselves and i think why i know i'm an old foggy but i just don't understand why especially when i look at these beautiful young beautifully dressed and young people here thank god for godly parents but i think why and and the lord was like they can only do it can only live by what they are you know i've told you many times about revelation uh or revelation becomes a part of who you are you can only live it because that's who you are you live that life because that's because that's who you are and the lord shall be they live that because that's what they are yeah it's sort of like i've told you several times that people go to church and they go to you know a church has a trinitarian minister they believe in three gods they said well he never preaches on it but everything that filters through that man's thought process and and uh interpretation and knowledge of the scripture is going to filter through that filter of of three gods that's right no my and everything that he does and everything that he says and everything he preaches is going to be influenced by that thought process that's right it's just like baptism you believe in baptism and in the name of the lord jesus christ or our uh uh father son holy ghost you know it's going to be it's going to be influenced by that uh i you know i've had people and i've talked to people uh go to places that that i know believe certain doctrinal things and i just tell them you know you're welcome to go as you feel led but just be careful because of someone so in such and such oh well they never preach on it doesn't matter everything that that person thinks and is filtered through with the scripture and all is going to be influenced by that thought because that's what they are that's what they believe and i thought they call us crazy because we conform to a way of life we were transformed by the renewing of our mind to a life to a lifestyle we dress a certain way we act a certain way we talk a certain way we don't go to certain places and go to church and we live we try to live a godly life we try to let the lord be glorified in our lives and other people in the world will tell you oh you're just bound you're just uh you're just a prisoner we're free and you go and you look in the world and i look at them because it was funny i was out down here studying yesterday and i saw a couple coming in and out of the tattoo parlor over here and i thought that's probably not even the right way to say that anymore i don't know uh that's what it was when i was growing up hard tattoo parlor i don't know what it is joint i don't know i pray and praying them away anyway unless the lord hasn't there for a purpose we're supposed to witness to them i don't want to run them away if they're supposed to be here and there's some spiritual significance otherwise but i looked and i thought wow every one of them looks the same and then it clicked well of course they all look the same they they say things about us conforming to the way we live but every one of them looks the same too you look out in the world tell me if i'm not right look out in the world and you see every they're they're they all look the same they're all wearing the same type of clothes and stripping down to nothing and and they're projecting their image because that's who they are right they they say we all look alike well they all look alike but they don't want to see that they don't want to admit that or recognize it but i'm thankful that uh that the holy spirit does have a way of uh speaking to his people to his children to to live that way to be that way to project themselves that way they're doing theirs and we do ours yeah but that's it again it's just a matter of who you are what you believe what's deep in your soul because that comes out that's what's going to that free will in your soul is what's going to uh manifest itself through your flesh through the spirit into through the flesh and it's going to magnif uh manifest itself that way it does in them it will in us amen it just depends on who you are what do you believe what is really truly deep in your heart because that's what's going to come out that eventually what's really deep down in your soul is what's going to come out i mean i've seen people uh come go to church for 20 years you think mine there's a soldier if they're gonna anybody make it there and then all of a sudden your next thing you know they're gone slidden and went away and and maybe they come back i'm afraid that they do but you know uh but then you think what's really down in there is gonna come out eventually it's gonna come out so uh a person can only live what they are thank god i'm a child of god amen i can only live the life of a child of god a born-again holy ghost-filled child of god because that's what i am that's all i can live and if it doesn't please anybody else i'm sorry but as long as i'm pleasing to him that's what matters brother man said i'd rather god take me by the hand than a man to pat me on the back yes amen so i'm so thankful god bless you appreciate you being here as uh i usually make the announcements at the end i don't want to forget this [Music] as brother zach had mentioned my precious brother friend frank lucero from san diego passed away this week actually it wasn't this week it was last saturday the 31st brother david zavala let me know a couple days ago sent me the obituary and he was a good friend he was a good brother i think him and his new wife he's 81 years old he just got remarried and they were going to move to tucson i was looking forward to seeing him more spending time with him he's just a precious brother but he passed away a week ago saturday and i pray as brother zach said to remember the family the church brother david zavala zavali let me know i'm seriously thinking about going to the funeral and being a part of the funeral brother david wanted me to be a part of the funeral so i'm seriously thinking about it won't affect our church or anything here at least not that i know of at this point it's on a monday and tuesday but uh i appreciate your prayers appreciate for them uh leadership on my behalf that the lord would show me what he would have me to do but i appreciate your prayers for that and your thoughts and just remember that again i'll keep you up to date if there's anything you need to know about it but as far as far as i know right now we will be having we will have regular church here next sunday so amen just remember that though i appreciate it let's stand if we could again uh we'll go to the word of god i don't know about you there i i feel a real liberty and freedom of the spirit this morning um i just sometimes like to share with you as a start the things that the lord share with me during the week sometimes and the things the lord has put on my heart and as the spirit moves it and puts it in the right position and place and we just try to do what we feel that to do so again i hate sharia and art weren't able to be here and cara is really looking forward to seeing her again but lord knows reason for everything but let's turn out of our bibles now to first thessalonians chapter four i'm going to read those few scriptures this is the rapture part 10. the rapture part 10. oh i do please continue to remember brother tim pruitt and his fam his family and church there in prayer as his wife sister karen passed away this week as brother zach had mentioned so let's please remember that in prayer too if you would we got curtains up finally a little a little bit at a time doing a little bit a little better with just a step at a time i know it still needs a little bit of work but again a little bit at a time so appreciate you being patient with us but i hope they look okay we took them from the country club and um country club location they kind of match the chairs and the carpet still so amen so thankful to the lord for that first thessalonians chapter 4 now verse 13 before we read though let's just bow our heads for word of prayer precious jesus we're so thankful again father of your grace and mercy and love to us it's so bountiful lord it's so pure it's so sweet it's so good we thank you so much for it father if anyone it's just hard to believe that anyone can even come close to experiencing that spirit lord that would turn their backs on it but it's so great to know you lord it's so great to lord experience your presence and to know you in the power and manifestation of that spirit lord and yes and each facet of our lives god and we've come here today to celebrate that to celebrate you to celebrate your resurrection lord expecting you to meet with us once again today god lord as it is every week father my prayer is your holy spirit coming and sweeping through this place lord let us have another upper room experience god today as you administer your word to our hearts draw us nearer to you lord make us more like you closer to you lord has been sung and our desires and heart lord is to is to let you be glorified in everything that we do and say god may you be pleased with our lives may you be pleased with everything that we do and say and be pleased with this service god we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the honor for all that is said and done here today may be a sweet smelling savior to you father as you receive it unto yourself as a praise from our lips god as a praise from our heart as it would mold us and shape us in even our minds god to speak before your throne powerful supernatural things yes we thank you god for this word thank you for this message lord in the revelation of that word to our heart god may you bring it real to us once again and show us where we need to be in you father and see these road signs along the road and help us to understand and see the day in the hour that we're living we committed to you now lord and and ask your blessings upon it once again for your glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first thessalonians 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together and uh with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen you could be seated if you'd like and then again as i said this is the rapture part 10. um i thought i've been further along with this by now but it seems like each part of this uh takes a little more depth than i had anticipated or expected and as you know a more of an inspiration preacher than a no preacher uh some people may have four or five ten eight pages of notes and this is the notes i got for this morning as you can see so i don't i don't normally write a lot down just a little bit but i'm just depending on the lord and whatever he would speak but uh we we morphed now last week from uh again this is still falls under the signs of the time and and the the resulting condition of what we are seeing in the world today as a rapturing time as a rapturing season because we know scripturally the prescription is there to help us understand and know that there's going to be a specific condition of the world that's going to help us understand the day that we live and where we're expecting the rapture to take place uh it was the same thing in every age it was the same thing with moses it was the same thing with noah you know obviously noah had never reigned before but there had to be a condition that made itself known to bring it to that time where god wanted him to build an ark now it took 120 years to build the ark but when the ark was complete they knew that that was the time right now it didn't happen right that second of course it happened a few days later but it happened and that's what matters but see so we see that in the scripture there's that that that resulting scriptural condition of the way the world and the church is supposed to be in at the time of rapture catching away last week we spoke more more specifically about lawlessness and the lawlessness of the world the lawlessness condition that takes place not only physically as we see around our country in the world but spiritually the spiritual lawlessness that's going on today but today i want to talk about and and go into a position of the darkness that's covered the earth today the darkness so um i wasn't going to read this i was just going to quote it but for some reason i was here yesterday i felt to read it so i'm going to isaiah chapter 60. we've read this couple of verses many times actually took a script a message or two on it but about the darkness the darkness that's covering the earth today amen the darkness uh i started reading in some of the scriptures that i felt the lord put on my heart to bring for you a few weeks ago or whatever time that it may manifest itself and uh and as i was reading them and going through them i thought my that that's that that's the that is the preeminent condition of the world when the rapture takes place is the darkness it's going to be such a darkness physically emotionally mentally spiritually it's going to be a dark place amen and we see here isaiah 61 60 and 1 says arise shine for thy light is come thank god for that the glory of the lord is risen upon me the you us the bride for behold the darkness the notice that specific v darkness not just a darkness but the darkness amen uh there are plenty of gods but there's only one the goth amen amen there's plenty of there's plenty of evil but there's only one thing darkness amen that's that's the devil that's satan for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee so we know that that scripturally is going to be a condition that we look for at this last day of a gross darkness that's covering the people and that would obviously of course the gross darkness without light will bring uh demon will bring demonic spirits and and the acting upon those spirits which obviously brings the lawlessness amen because it's a resulting effect of the darkness that we live in this is a dark dreary world people say can't you print something a little more uplifting friend this title is the rapture and i can't think of anything more uplifting than knowing that we're going in a rapture that we're going to receive a body change and we're going to leave this earth but we have to understand what the condition of the world is going to be at the time that takes place that season is now amen that's the time season that we live now we finished with this scripture so i'm going to go back to it because uh we didn't finish this scripture i finished up last week sermon with this scripture so let's go back to 2 thessalonians chapter 2 because i want to start back there and finish through the thought that we had started at the end of last the service last week 2 thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1. now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand amen and we believe that now amen let no man deceive you by any means remember we read it jesus said that matthew 24. one of the first things that was the first thing when they asked him that threefold question remember we read the scripture last week that three-fold question but for anybody that didn't listen or weren't here um that three-fold question they asked matthew 24 jesus the first thing he told them was make sure that you're not deceived now what is the number one way that you will not be deceived what is a sure fire you know for a fact that you cannot be deceived you must be born again you must have the holy ghost anyone that is not born again said well i have the anointing that's fine and good for him but you can be very much deceived even by that anointing you can be deceived but if you're born again and christ lives in you you cannot be deceived because you've become the word amen amen so let no so now paul picks it up here to the uh thessalonians now let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now jesus answers several parts to that in matthew 24 when paul just hits on two specific things jesus talks about the wars the rumors of wars he talks about the pestilence and everything that's going to happen paul narrows down to two specific things when we talk about the day of christ being at hand let no man deceive you for that day shall not come except there come a falling away and the man of sin to be revealed amen to be revealed so when was this great falling away to take place at this last day when was this man of sin to be revealed that we read about in isaiah 14 when was this man of sin revelation 12 going to be revealed in the last day amen so it all follows through those are the two specific points that paul brings to point out to us that are that if you want to call them signs signposts that we look to that we recognize we are at this time okay who opposeth now this son of perdition opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god again isaiah 14 or that is worshiped worshipped satan worship amen doesn't again it does not have to be headless chickens pentagrams and upside down crosses to worship satan people worship satan all the time every day and don't even know it yes right now i'm not being judgmental and i'm not going to put a number on it but i i promise you by the word and by the message there's been multiple churches just this morning worshipping satan yes yeah they don't even know it right they're worshiping the devil correct you imagine the kind of things that's in churches that's allowed in churches let's just start with the music when was it when did it ever become allowable to come into the house of god rock and roll music that's right or jazz rock and roll or whatever it is blues i don't know that's all of the world but when did it ever become correct and proper to have it in a church that stuff's only proper in one place and that's satan's eden which we're called out of yes amen we're not a part of them when did it ever become fashionable in church they said oh you got to listen to the words i can't hear the words for the demonic beat that's going on behind it i've looked at some songs that me and brother david one time went to it just because we kind of had the same thought process on that we went to barnes noble one time and was looking up some of these songs that people just sing in church and worship at and you know what the genre several of them not all of them but several of these newer songs actually was listed at the barnes and noble in their catalog as the genre of rock and roll that's the genre that they listed under and people sing it in churches worshiping god i think when was that ever allowed oh well but it has such a powerful message no it has a powerful backbeat which is the driving force behind rock and roll the backbeat is the driving force behind rock and roll yes and people do it all the time yeah churches around i'm sorry friend i've been in message churches i wished i was not there yeah i've been in nash's churches where i felt like and i used to go to rock concerts when i was a kid so i know what i'm talking about i felt like i was in a miniature concert i just don't understand it but it's that darkness that's right amen it's that darkness it's the subtleness of the devil that son of perdition that man of sin is to be revealed in this last day but he is being worshipped in a wholesale worship throughout this world and in many many churches and they don't even realize him that's right i'll read you this quote again what brother branham said in august of 1965 god of this evil age the god of this evil age now how beautiful the scripture tied themselves together in every age notice now when the church world would not have the word of god to rule over them they accepted a murderer barabbas what did this do it exalted satan who did it the religious leaders you say wait a minute it was the religious leaders that rejected the word of god by accepting a barabbas absolutely it was the religious leaders that was screaming the loudest crucify him let his blood be on us and our children that was the priests yeah they had just left the temple at uh for service and they come out screaming to kill this innocent man and they accepted a barabbas in his place he said well that was the jews same thing happens today because it's the same devil same devil there same devil here so it's still the same thing not jews now but gentiles what have they done they accepted a barabbas and exalted satan he is the god of this evil age to the place that he always wanted to be now listen for satan is not spoken of as god of any other age but this age say to the god of this age yes amen i know that the kids that go to school and have jobs now be careful saints yes amen be careful that that devil's out there to wrangle you up yes he's he's a good wrangler he's a good he's a good ropist he can sling that rope from a long distance and he can have you hooked before you know what's going on but that's the devil out there amen his playground he makes it look all appealing and and lovely but his his end result is death for you yes he wasn't spoken of the god of the age noah wasn't spoken of the god of age of moses the god of a lie of the age of elijah but this evil age he said oh don't miss this he is the god of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it that's right worship by millions and billions of people and they don't even know it and the population when brother branham was here 1965 is it near what it is today correct but he still said billions billions worship him indeed don't even know it but let the scripture uncover him this morning and let's see and then you'll know yes let's do that let's take this scripture and let's rip the veil off of that devil yes that's exposing so he will have a room to hide yes amen he's the god look now fourth verse we're back ii thessalonians two fourth first who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called god for or that is worship so that he as god he satan as god sitteth in church he sinneth in the temple of god showing himself that he is what he is god right remember god's just not to worship right amen god's an object to worship and he is the god of this world worshiped by millions and billions of people though hid from ages and generations remember the darkness now that's our theme was to bring an unveiling through satan's eden satan showing himself that he is god and he is friend he is the god of this world we might not like it i i mean trust me my spirit is cringing within me just to say the words that satan is that god of this age right yes i it it cringes me to say it but it's the truth yeah amen satan is the god of this age right satan is the god of most churches out there today who claim to worship jesus christ by my remember ye not listen now let's let's let's pull that veil off if it had it's already been pulled off let's let's work on him again today amen let's beat that devil into such a pulp he he wanted to get up off the floor for ten weeks amen remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time now who's holding it back who was reserving it who was holding it back so that it would be revealed in its time so remember no we know that there's a time and a place in the season for everything we go back to ephesians one at that at it's a point in time and it was an appointed time for the unveiling of this wicked one this evil one to be unveiled to be uh brought out into the light there was a time for it times went along daniel uh daniel you don't need to turn there but in daniel chapter 12 verse 4. let me see if i can find it read it to you real quick daniel chapter 12 verse 4 way back to daniel god says but but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and acknowledge and knowledge shall be increased what did god tell daniel when daniel started getting a glimpse of it god told daniel seal it up it's not time for it daniel seal up the word seal of the book to the time of what the end right now yeah that was the time that that unveiling and that revealing of that that man of sin the son of perdition to be revealed to be made known i told you the other day the greatest thing that unveiled the devil was the seven seals when brother branham preached the truth and the revelation of those seals by the inspiration of an angel coming every day by uh by ministering it to him brought it to a people that unveiled who satan was writing all through these ages yes still doing it yeah still riding he's on that pale horse today riding through this age amen now this bride's been called out of this age we feel the influence of it but she's been called out but that revealing of that unveiling up till that time friend nobody even knew who that was people poked out and prayed at and thought but most people in the religious world thought that was the devil going down through revelation chapter six yes they thought that was the devil and the white oh this white horse has got to be or thought it was jesus i should say on the devil and thought it was jesus writing out to the church ages well he's on a white horse got to be jesus pure and righteous and you think oh yeah well that makes sense well that's what the natural mind thinks without revelation but when the revelation of the truth comes you recognize that was the hypocrisy of the devil himself veiling himself in purity holiness righteousness and in church yes the very seed of god in his own church that's the seed of satan doing the same thing today let's revelation chapter 10 just real quick i'm not gonna uh have you turn there unless you want to revelation 10 4 look at this um well let's just start with verse one revelation 10 1. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his face is at worth the sun his feet his pillars of fire he's had in his hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea and the left foot upon the earth he cried with the loud voices when aligned worth and when he had cried seven thunders under their voices and when the seven thunder said utter their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things so there was times that men of god got glimpses of what we had know today to be a revealed truth yeah the unveiling of satan the unveiling of the darkness the son of perdition can no longer hide behind his hypocrisy he has been made known amen now who has he made known to the bride yes the bride's going to be the only ones that's going to know that the rest of the world still lives in that veil they still live veiled from what the presence of that enemy is and they let them and they let that devil infiltrate every facet of their life every corner of their church every uh place in their home and families and they don't even realize it it's the devil yes he's been exposed oh there's been men yeah god said shut up those things which is seven thunders uttered and write them not why not why was john not permitted to write it because it wasn't time why was daniel not permitted to write what god was showing him because it was a time yeah when was that time ii thessalonians 2 6 and now we know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time god was withholding it god was keeping that from taking place god was holding that from being revealed because it needed to be revealed at a specific time and that specific time is a rapture time and when it's that time right now yes right now is that time amen praise the lord if you want in my opinion to know that unveiling that uncovering i believe it was the seals that really did it that that was out now obviously through the ages and of course brother branham did too but that was the nail in the coffin if you as they would say that that really exposed that devil that really brought to light that he was the god of this wicked age yes and that's why brother bannon preached god of this evil age and and other messages on top of that that he be revealed in his time amen thank god that is this time what time the end time what time rapture time he is to be revealed he has been for the mystery now what is a mystery a mystery is something in darkness a mystery is something that's hidden a mystery is something that has a veil on it you might know there's something in there but you don't know what and if you don't know what then it remains a mystery and if it's still a mystery then you can't see it because it's hid it's veiled so that mystery of iniquity that we were talking on last week does already work so if iniquity is working but it's a mystery of iniquity that means the iniquity is actually going forth and people don't realize it you understand the iniquity because it's still a mystery the mystery of iniquity is working its way in the world in our country in churches and it's a mystery so people don't even realize it right so it so you could have things go through the church you could have uh uh who wasn't uh martin luther smoked a pipe or something i forgot down through the age he was uh how how could i be and and and actually stayed he protested the catholic church but he stayed a catholic why how could that be because it was working its way up to this time that mystery of iniquity was still working no longer because it's not a mystery anymore it's um it's been unveiled to the to those who will know the truth to those who god has revealed the truth you say now wait a minute it's only for those who who actually god will reveal that truth too that that will come to understand that absolutely he said what about everybody else it's hint to them it's him to everybody else it's only going to be revealed to the bride yes that's the international bride it's not just me or you or this church it's the bride internationally it's going to be revealed to the bride internationally not just um um the the few here the city state it's going to be around the world yes and god's got that bride all the way down to the church age he said well how does god excuse that because the mystery was still it was still failed it wasn't made known to them they were responsible for what god brought them for their day and if they live to their message as brother adam said they will be there the mystery of iniquity does already work now he said this when he wrote this already work only he who now letteth will let uh god hindering who will hinder let it will hinder until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed amen today that's when he's being revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now what cometh out of the mouth of god amen the word of god amen what is the word the word is a sharp powerful two-edged sword right and that sword come forth of the spirit of his mouth to destroy the devil now what kind of sword is it when it comes out of your mouth you say oh that's god god said yeah when when i come i'll destroy him with the spirit of my mouth that's the word well what does the word do when you speak it does it not do the same thing amen right yes the word spoken with faith behind it will produce anything that this bible says it will yes anything amen amen the right word spoken with faith behind it it will produce what it said it would produce yes and it does yes friend have you not witnessed that in your own life amen in your own families in your own churches just since we've been a church i know that's happened yes i haven't looked i'm not looking at anybody this morning that i know for a fact has happened to you and your home and family right so you know what the power of that word does amen if it destroys the enemy when god said he would destroy him then when that spirit that word comes out of his mouth what ha what does it produce when it comes out of your mouth yes you've got to understand that friend you got to realize who you are yeah this bride's not going anywhere till she realizes who she is you've got to realize who you are you have to know who you are and if you know who you are and you rightly speak that word by faith it will produce what it said it would produce it will defeat the enemy any place any time amen amen amen amen that word will produce what will will defeat the enemy any place any time amen praise the lord it's got to be the word it's got to be the purity of the revelation of the word you go back to isaiah 1 20 and revelation 19 15 specifically declares that spirit of his mouth being the word going forth to destroy and defeat the enemy when that word comes forth out of you friend it will defeat the enemy believe it by faith yes amen it will produce what it said it will yes he shall consume that spirit of wicked with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy it with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and silence and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved they love pleasure we read ii timothy 3 they love pleasure more than love god right but if they love god it produces what it said they received the love of the truth but those who reject or receive not the love of the truth are those that are deceived in unrighteousness it remains hid it remains a mystery to them and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness they believe not the word they believe not the truth friend i'm sorry but it's it's a sad fact when god presents itself when the word presents itself and is flatly rejected there's nothing left but judgment right right nothing left but judgment and if you go on and read that beyond what we read last week in matthew 24 you see that jesus says now when the word is preached to all the nations all the world then the end will come yeah what does that mean that means that everybody will have the opportunity yes everybody will have had the chance to receive it you say but what about the little children well that's up to god that's up to whether the predestinated or not that's god's choice right amen so what they couldn't receive the truth they couldn't understand it no no but god knows who they are and remember all babies go to heaven anyway yeah amen so are they predestined or they're going to rapture don't know that right but they but all babies go to heaven yeah amen i know it's a horrible time when people talk about children dying and things like that and and it is yeah and and it cringes my heart especially when i got little grandchildren myself and i think about that a three-year-old seven-year-old and then he just pierces through my heart but i think well they're just laying in the arms of jesus now yeah so praise the lord they're gonna be there right amen it's a sad thing that they're gone from the earth for the parents and loved ones but they're laying in the arms of jesus to praise the lord that's where they are but now let's as we pull that that that veil off of the devil we realize that only those that reject the truth will god send strong delusion god will send them strong delusion that they would believe a lot what is that delusion strongest delusion i know of that a person could believe and be damned by it is that spirit that is so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible yes and that's a religious spirit yes that's not a spirit out here in the world it's not the spirit of government or medicine or or money it's a spirit it's a religious spirit like we talked about last week the mark of the beast friend the mark of the beast is not the vaccine and the people say coven vaccine is the mark of the beast oh come on really that's not the mark well they're pumping something in your arm i don't know what they're pumping in there i'm not concerned about it because god takes care of me but i can tell you by message of the hour it's not the mark of the beast right right amen i mean it's okay i mean and people see that and if somebody doesn't know that's okay but it's not the mark of the beast right the mark of the feast is rejection of god's word exactly amen you reject god's word you are cursed with with with a lie that you'll believe that life and that lie is going to be so close it would deceive the very elected possible because it's a religious spirit yeah it's a religious spirit those are the things that god that delusion that delusion is not oh go to hinduism that illusion delusion is not oh go to buddhism that delusion is oh believe in the government or believe in the medicine or or hold up all your trust in your money and your riches and wealth no the delusion is that it's that it is godly the delusion is that it is spiritually correct that's the delusion and people believe that right and they bring the rock and roll into their churches and they're damned by it saints yes oh god if he hasn't been exposed today friend i don't know when he will but thank god for a messenger yeah a message that god could speak to and bring a message that we can see the truth of that word that he would unveil that devil no wonder he hated this message so much i wonder that's one of me and brother dennis's favorite quotes out of christ and mystery god revealed all hells against this message yes right we know why because it unveils him yes it exposes him it shows him for the demonic spirit the deceptive hypocritical spirit that he is yes amen is that the age we're living yes is that a rapture age do we see that in the scripture as a as a sign to us that we're here yeah oh praise the lord i don't mean here as in it may happen that it's gonna happen today it may it is here as in it is imminent amen it is imminent it is right at the door when i don't know i don't know never thought i'd see my kids have children now my oldest grandson's in the second grade how did that happen yeah i look at serenity and savannah and stryan are uh these little girls are just coming to the school down here just nice you've got a job working and a little moses too it's just hard to believe yeah so we don't know okay we don't know see that just makes you responsible for your life now see moses you're old enough i looked at his beautiful haircut coming in this morning i thought man that's a snazzy looking young man amen got that rat sniffed off of you looks good but you're just a little fellow when i saw you and he's growing up and so we don't know uh i never thought my children would be to that age but you don't know but i do know that we're at this time yes amen i do know it can be any moment any time we're at the rapture season i may not see it happen i don't know i mean you know alive and remain but i know it's going to happen right i know the the scripture declares it and i know that we're here now i know this is the condition i've never seen the condition more so than it is right now that's right i can remember things back years ago before the government got involved and i'll just say this before i'm not going to call his name but before a certain president was elected several years ago 12 years ago i guess i'm kind of naming him i i grew up in north carolina friend i grew up when my sister would have to come home because of the riots in middle school when they uh well it was junior high school then when they were integrating everybody and it was fights because each side hated each other and it was like that was the purpose they were trying they were trying to fuel this and all of a sudden humanity as it does found a way to exist humanity found a way to love and to coexist and to come together when i came up in school some of my best friends through my entire life no matter what school i went to what job i was at no matter where i was some of my best friends in life were black people yeah african-american whatever i don't want to be politically incorrect well you know me i don't care anything about being politically correct but they were black people i mean i love those people and and we it didn't matter if i was white and they're black didn't matter what color what nationality was where they lived or what their financial status was here's my buddy yeah that's all i cared about right yes but now all of a sudden again that whole thing's being stoked that that fire is being fueled and that hatred is being jinned up again amen there's a spear behind it yes there's a spirit behind it let's go to ii corinthians so let me finish this second corinthians chapter four we'll start with verse one second corinthians chapter four verse one therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty renounced put aside the hidden things now look at this this is what is hidden it's darkness something that's hidden in the dark it's it's veil it's a mystery we've renounced those hidden things of dishonesty that a lot of people do that they you know do was say well nobody's looking so i can do this that's that hidden thing of dishonesty right nobody realizes what's going on nobody can see me nobody's gonna know this has happened or that i've done this but paul is telling them that we have renounced that because there is an all-seeing eye there's a god that sees it all so even if nobody else around us sees it we know god sees it and we have renounced those hidden things the darkness isn't that just where the roaches like to hide in the darkness yeah rats and roaches bats they love the dark amen we don't love them i don't like roaches and rats in my house or bats flying around they do but i don't like them there but that's what they they they feast in that darkness they feast in that spirit you ever thought of it any greater than when i was out driving and and when i first started i would drive out later at night too sometimes till one and two o'clock in the morning i only did that once or twice i learned my lesson fast on that but as soon as it got dark man the roaches started crawling out everywhere the bats started flying around the rats started feasting off all the nests and i'm not talking about the rodents i'm talking about the people yeah that have those spirits right oh they're they're hid away on their couches and stuff until it's dark and when it's dark that's when it goes crazy micah can probably tell you that from living downtown for a year or whatever it was and all the racket that goes on and all the spirits that come out it's it's it's demonic feast time in the spirit and and john 3 says that people would rather be in the darkness than in the light they like the darkness rather than the light why because their deeds are hidden right they can hide in the darkness you can't hide in the light when the light shines then the darkness goes away the darkness goes away everything is plain you can see it well they like the darkness because their days are evil but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully or that is by or that is to deceive someone or to lead someone astray amen the true children of god don't take the word of god to lead people astray from the truth of the spirit of christ they don't do it deceitfully you bring the word of god in truth and in revelation so that people will be enlightened by the word of god but where there's hybridism and when there's a a death it is a darkness the word is still hid why do you think the catholic church for all those hundreds of years wouldn't let the common person have a bible to read because they didn't want those people to know that what they were teaching them was against the word of god yes now they just don't care but that's how great the spirit has got right amen they used to care and then the gutenberg press came and they started getting the bible and all the hands of common people and people started reading what the bible was saying and the catholic church had a dark age where they were putting people to death by the thousands because of it fox book of martyrs yes dark ages putting them in depth just because they had a bible they could read don't you dare read that bible darkness but we not handling the word of god deceitfully but look at now but by manifestation of the truth now what is a man what is something manifested that's something that's known that's something that's in the light that's something to come out from the darkness that's something that's come out from being hid something that's no longer veiled is something that is manifested now you know the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost if it be hid who is it hid from if this gospel is veiled who is it veiled to the lost who will not see the truth of the revelation of the word the lost brother branham preached that message souls in prison he talked about jesus going down to hell and preaching to the souls that are imprisoned those that are totally and eternally lost he even questioned if his ministry in 1963 had flipped to ministering to the total lost amen thankfully there was still some light out there and i thank god and i believe that i was one of those uh well a couple years later i became one of those uh beacons of light i believe you were too but by the grace of god that light began to overpower that darkness again because it wasn't time for that darkness to be revealed until the messenger until the message until the truth came to unveil that devil and expose him to what he really was but by the time that happened what was going on in the religious world then didn't matter they didn't care anymore the darkness had become so great and man had become so sinful they didn't care yeah i think the catholic church is about 1 2 billion strong 1.2 billion strong now and all of her all the little uh harlots that follow after her mother amen how many more of those are there now another billion 2 billion 3 billion i don't know that are following along with her the offspring of mother they do the exact same thing to deceive to bring death yeah now there's probably some that do it purposefully but i think most people do it because it's just hid they just don't know but remember in this last day that willful ignorance has become one of the most prominent spirits that we see today the willful ignorance he said well i didn't know yeah but when truth presented itself to you and you turned it down you became willfully ignorant right because you had a chance it came across your path and you chose to deny it that's willful ignorance well i didn't know the message but you had a chance at it and you turned it down see there's a difference as we said a few weeks ago but if our gospel be hid if it is veiled it is mailed to the lost to the people that were lost in whom the gods of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god shine upon them now why would god not allow that glorious light to shine upon them because they're terrors and in this last day friend the tares you say well the sun's been shining on the tares absolutely still does but in this last days the darkness is taking over amen remember this last church age was completely blacked out by god when he gave it to brother branham it was completely blacked out thank god for this sliver of light so if this sliver of light the bride leaves here what is there going to be nothing but darkness nothing but darkness amen and we see it now we see it it's all around us it's in this world today amen this mystery this mystery was finished under the seventh angel's message this mystery this unveiling was finished under the seventh angels message two more scriptures i want to read to get to where i want to be next week revelation chapter 3. revelation 3 14 the laodicea church age the last church age the last age that goes into apostasy is we know the pale horse rides into perdition into apostasy this age ends up in apostasy revelation 3 14. and unto the angel of the church of laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of god which is jesus i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou were cold or hot so then because they are lukewarming either cold or hot i will spew thee out of my mouth now remember this is the church age this is the church not the bride he's talking to this address is to the church of this laodicea because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing my does that not sound like today goodness if that just sounds just like today i tell you in my opinion just real quick my opinion i think there's three classes of homeless people today there's people that are probably mentally ill which there should be a place for them i believe there should be a place those people should have to live on the street i believe there's people that are starting out on drugs i believe there should be a place for those people i believe there should be help to get those people help if the government can spend trillions and trillions of dollars on all this other stuff surely they can help the people that are most distraught downtrodden but i think there's a third group of those people who are homeless by choice they're out on the street because they want to be there's no responsibility they don't have to get a job you just beg for a little bit of money and live day to day live in the culvert out here until it gets washed away with the monsoon rains then you move to wherever and you beg on the side of the road and some people i i you said brother you don't know about that i i ubered a little kid like not a little kid a kid is i say little he's 19 or 20. um expose the devil it was the message of william brown the seventh angel messenger that brought light the light of the gospel that exposed that devil that took it all out of darkness right amen and he and i'm not saying it is so don't go brother newton said you know i i heard people were saying that me and me and michael were advocating the shot the vaccine no we weren't i was normica or i were advocating for you to get the shot we weren't doing that i i i i thought that was pretty clear but we that's not what we were saying he was just giving you some information about it things that are medically to be known which to and brother brother green always said it informed people's not a confused people but just try to inform you of that and then tell you look i am not going to tell anybody i'm not a medical doctor i i can't tell you you better get it you have to do what you feel that of god to do now obviously people that are in certain conditions those that have had health issues diabetes overweight things like that older older population those are the things those are the ones that's had the worst results when they get it our precious brother emanuel rojas just passed away this is a good example of brother monreal brother joel a precious brother loved him with all my heart he's such a a good man a good family man diabetes a little overweight had diabetes it really it hits those people but i'm not going to tell you to do that i'm here to preach the gospel and i'll tell you to get a shot if i can't trust god for that little bit friend then i know i have no business being up here i mean i almost feel like a hypocrite if i didn't feel that way like i i'm what kind of christian am i but i can tell you you better do what you feel that of god to do yes i can tell you that the medical world and your doctor or whatever the things micah told you if it if it did something this way that that's up to you but you do what you feel that to do amen that's all i can say do what the lord in your life if you're if you were born again and feel the spirit of god now if i was just going out advising just somebody on the street and they ask my opinion i'd probably tell them those things if you fit in these categories i'd probably do it amen mo but most people children healthy adults uh rarely get that sick they do sometimes but rarely do they get that sick and mike explained that last week i thought it was excellent how that affects the body but anyway i i gotta move on i just the lord just puts things like this in me that i just feel like i need to clarify yeah so i hope that's okay um and he cried by them with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and it's become the habitation of devils now we read about babylon right here in revelation 17. we know that's catholic church and all of her harlots came off of her it's fallen and each one of them has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird so the devil said it in the temple of god showing himself that he is god amen for all the nations have have drunk of the wine of the wrath for fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her right here again revelation 17 have committed fornication with her uncleanness unclean if you know fornication unclean living amen filthiness and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies but now to the bride he said i have heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins that you receive not her plagues yes that's to the bride yeah man amen the church has gotten its message but the bride has gotten her message and that message is you come out of her because you belong to me be no partaker of her sin but be partaker of the purity and the holiness of the spirit of god and the righteousness that he brings the word brings come out of it don't be a part of it yeah be a part of this the word the spirit the truth yes let let the lord take a hold of your life amen amen come out of it that's the message to the bride don't be partaker dude if you love the world the things of the world the love of god is not even in you how dwelleth the love of god in you because there's only one love in there and if it's the love of if it's the love of the world if it's the love of this cosmos out here god's love can't be in there because if god's love is in there it won't love those things of the world it'll only love the things of god so the two cannot cohabitate they have to there can only be one in there come out of her that's the message to the bride that's the message of this day yes is there a falling away oh absolutely absolutely i almost say this i've said this and i'm going to say it on you record it i i personally believe billy paul passed away one day before this happens i could be absolutely wrong it's new bennett's opinion and i would imagine a lot of people that are hanging on to that billy paul not being old man before the rapture are going to go away my opinion but there's been great fallings away already people believing the truth of the word not not necessarily leaving church although some are not mess maybe going to a different denomination or something but leaving the word leaving the purity of the word i told you the other day i i think of that and i think i've actually not not too greatly but i've actually contemplated in my head what would i do if i didn't have this message and and the revelation of that word that god's given to me to minister i don't i don't know what i would do i i just probably just i'd be a baptist i guess i guess be a good methodist or something this is a a good one of those that has a 30 000 seat stadium and says god is such a good god and god loves you and and god's gonna take care of you and and you are your god and and and everything's the grass is green and sky is blue and it's all beautiful and perfect and harmony and love and everything is wonderful and you know brother i was listening brother brown the other day and he said people keep saying god's such a good god he said till i want to puke he said it makes me sick that people keep telling god's a good god he said yeah he's a good god but he's a god of wrath and judgment too yes he is he's not some dirty grandpa up there just saying oh it's okay just live like any way you want yeah you can have rock and roll and the church is no problem it's just as long as you're entertained that's all that really matters hogwash that's demonic amen and so the devil friend god is a righteous god god is a holy god a holy people and a rapture amen in a rapture praise the lord let's stand if we could i enjoy my life i really do i i i enjoy my life i for the most part i i have a good time living church family i was in here praying yesterday i think god is there any more blessed human on the planet than me god's been so good to me amen i love him so much but i enjoy life i i'm i'm i'm happy i'm content i'm thankful for what god has done for us what god's done for me but as soon as he says time to come i'm gonna be ready to go amen amen i won't look back i won't have any regrets i won't say oh let me do one more no no no i'm gonna be ready to go amen i'm happy to be here and i love being here and i thank god for life but when it's time to go i'm going to be ready to go amen going to be ready to go it's going to be strange to see my son over there who is a day and a half year old he's going to be a 20 21 year old young man yeah amen if it happened today i'd have my granddaughter three she's 20 21 beautiful young lady and my grandson it's

for him amen do the work of the lord amen thank you jesus amen leslie this course is just the course in the book but 579 i didn't even think i keep forgetting about the screens that this song's

in my heart for his appearing i'll gladly leave behind these trials here below [Music] for this journey has been long and i'm so weary but lord somehow i feel i am so much closer home just any day now our lord is coming he'll be returning for you and me for what i've been watching and i've been waiting just face i'll see amen praise the lord jesus are you looking forward to that time saying amen i pray that that becomes a revelation to every one of us so deep in our hearts that it becomes real every day that that maybe lord willing will talk soon it's been on my notes for weeks that spiritual application becomes a reality every day amen every day we're caught up in heavenly places in christ jesus amen praise the lord god bless you and try as adequately in my failures as i can to relay it as the lord gives it to me but by the grace of god it is a reality amen amen amen praise the lord thank god for it don't you yes amen god bless you appreciate you love you i pray something was said to strengthen you and bless you in some way i appreciate again you remembered prayers for me about going to san diego to be a part of that for brother frank i also forgot to mention that another very good buddy of mine north carolina i feel like brother pat now brother pat went through that time where it seemed like er people he knew all around was dying and another good buddy of mine in north carolina just passed away too um uh john meadows uh he was he was a good friend he was a good buddy used to go to the breakfast we had on tuesday morning there in north carolina and charitable and we had good fellowship good time together and when i went to minister for his church and pastor there he wasn't a minister but it said over there he'd amend the word and i tell you when he got up to pray you could tell he was a man that talked to god he was uh he'll be greatly missed by his family and that church so i appreciate your prayers for that too so i'm thinking mine just this week has been such a week with brother john and brother frank and sister pruitt and we never know when god says your time is your time time to go yeah we don't know one of us may be missing next week i don't know could be me we don't know but i'm trusting the lord for his blessings continued blessings on our lives i thank him every day for giving me another day another day i wasn't promised it right but to another day to live for him amen it's the greatest privilege there ever was known to man to have another day to live for jesus christ amen praise the lord also i want to let you know brother roger has invited me to come minister for him the first sunday in september which is i looked it up and i don't forgot it the first sunday in september i like to give you the date too just just to note september the 5th september the 5th is the first sunday in september for his afternoon service so we'll have service here but he wants me to go minister for him so he asked if we invite anybody and everybody from the church here that wants to go we're going to have communion a joint communion with hips congregation and whoever wants to go down there to sierra vista for that service i'll be ministering down there on september 5th he has service at 4 30 in the afternoon on sunday and then we'll be observing the lord's supper so if you'd like to do that also uh it's been on my heart since basically since i knew we were getting this place for us to have communion in phil washington here too so lord wheeling very soon i want to have it here too probably not next week and lord willing i'm going to ask him today but i was hoping to have brother dan daniel evans the following sunday which is the 22nd so maybe the next sunday i'm not sure but we'll just see whatever the lord provides and leads to so but i do want to have communion in phil washington here too it's been it's well we haven't had it since we left the church on cortero and that's been well over a year ago uh so i've missed it tremendously so lord willing we want to do that uh very soon and have that here so and if you want to go to the service uh down in service or brother roger just let me know and i'll get to the address i don't even know the address but i'll get you the address so if you want to go and be there and be a part of that service and the community and service there i'll let you know about that as
