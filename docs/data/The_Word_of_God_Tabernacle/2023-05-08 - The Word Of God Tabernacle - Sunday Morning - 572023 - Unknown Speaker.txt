encourage you all it's the devil that keeps you away from church when try to justify oh I can stay old well we do get sick we do have problems something does come up you know that's that's fine these things happen to all of us but if you can make it to church that's your uh posted Duty amen you need to be here don't let the enemy tell you anything different it's like for myself as an example if I try to justify to stay home or go from Pillar To Post that's the book of Dennis and the Book of that is just doesn't get anywhere yeah so you know let's put the Lord first yes I believe he's he's coming soon yes yes amen great and curse yes sister oh I'm 78 now very very strange trick I'm on never been here before and I know y'all never been in your year either but um I order everything online

real yes thank you God Amen what we need so very true amen amen the Lord like I told you last week I'm still in the landlord Craig he said dad is it like only one place in here left I said I know and he said you know your your place is you're probably getting half the rent what I could get from and I said I know I said but but look at the places full I said the place is full because we're here he looked at me crazy but he said yeah yeah I said I prayed the Lord blessed you to fill the place up outside of this one here of course but I said I pray the Lord bless you once we came in there there it is you ever gone in a restaurant and there's nobody there and and 10 minutes later there's 30 people yes you ever go to some you know place like that and there's nobody there and then all of a sudden the whole place is full of people God knows his own anybody else when brother Branham went to the hospital after his accident the hospital was full of people yeah and then he went there they all got you left left it's a different that's a reverse system yeah right amen yes praise the Lord so very true sing song service today but I want to go to First Timothy chapter six read a few verses of scripture here in first Timothy chapter six to start amen simple thought the lord gave me the other day kind of followed up with the contending for the faith um but take a little bit of a different avenue if you will amen First Timothy chapter six we're going to begin reading with with verse six but before we do good with our heads forward a prayer and Lord Jesus father you are reality God you are everything to us people may not know it Lord we may not can touch you tangibly or or hear you audibly but Lord you are reality you're here for us yes in every way God and we know that because we recognize it and we see it at every term Lord from the testimony of brother and sister Pat to the testimony of brother Dennis and brother Danny and Lord how you were with him in that car God and how many testimonies we've heard recently Lord yes just over the days over the years over the weeks God your reality because we know that your reality we know that you're there how many times that Lord just in the Simplicity of getting into a situation and a little thought a little prayer a little something to you Lord God just helped me find these Keys Lord just help that printer work Lord just bring us to this place Lord help me with this God and Lord just bring my test out perfect and normal Lord may may you help me Lord to be able to walk to my garage without passing out Lord just you're just so good to his father we thank you so much and I just I wanna I wanna automatize those things so that we hear them and that we recognize God even as the testimonies go forth that how faithful you are to us Lord the world would look upon this probably even some Christians maybe even some message people will look in this little assembly and not think much about it but Lord the things that you do for us God oh Lord just in this little group of people father how you're so faithful to us how you bless us and you walk with us and you watch over us and you strengthen us oh God how you visit us in our services Lord and you're never failing the Lord we just thank you and praise you for all that you do for us Lord and for here today in this desire to come to this place Lord we thank you for it Lord and we've had many requests here today we've got some Financial situations and difficulties father but Lord we know that you on the cattle in a thousand hills there's nothing God that you can't do and Lord we're just praise your faithfulness would continue to extend Lord It's hand to each one of us and for your blessings and watching over us sometimes we know you put us in situations to teach us a lesson sometimes you direct us in places things we might not be doing that we should do my things that we shouldn't do that we should not do or whatever it is Lord you lead us and guide us in some ways that we just don't understand but as we call Upon Your Name Lord may we learn whatever it may be you're trying to teach us God to draw us call Closer to You Lord I pray now that you have complete control of the main part of this service may your Holy Spirit move in a special way now God to speak through these lips to anoint our ears to accomplish that through this service what you'd have to be accomplished today Lord you're the only one that can do it and we just pray that it will not return void let it be today we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get all the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen First Timothy chapter 6 verse 6. it says but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and arraignment let us be there with content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some covet actor they have aired from the faith and pierced himself through with many sorrows let thou o man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses you could be seated if you'd like when I take the subject on that last verse that entire reading of course is quite uh quite an extensible an extensive teaching but I want to take the last the last verse the little bit of that last verse and we were talking about contending for the faith that contention is is sort of the same it's not the same Greek word but it sort of falls in the same family in in the uh in the subtext of fighting the good fight uh my context though however was when contending for the faith was a lot about what we deal with in the Life uh and from others and and uh from those that would come in unawares as the Bible said and try to sow Discord and things like that but this fight is going to be directly at the Devil amen directly at the devil that the Lord tells us here to fight the good fight now what's the good fight it's the good fight of Faith it's amazing that Michael just put it in on that song every verse every line he sang out of the song I'm looking at it and I'm singing it and I'm thinking my that's just exactly what the Lord had put on my heart to preach for today actually I originally had had this to speak last week uh but for some reason I was I was standing there and uh going through it uh the Lord changed and put the sermon in for last week and this for this week and God knows everything but as I was listening to the lines as he was singing I thought mine this is exactly what the Lord had to bring today fighting the good fight of Fate now the fight that we have uh that we are very Christians are considered a very docile uh group of people uh we're we're a group of people that's considered a group a group of people more of Love uh than a fighting uh however there is in the scripture although that we are a people of love but we are a people of God's love we're not a people of the world's love uh we do have filio love we do express filial love but our love that sets us apart from the world is our agape love the love of God yes and that's the love of God that's shine abroad in our hearts that we to express to the world they don't understand that kind of love uh but that's the kind of love that God's people have but this this fighting of the good fight there's also scripture about us contending and about us fighting uh the problem is a lot of times in Christians even in the message people tend to train their fight on one another instead of on the enemy uh they they blame one another they fight one another or they contend with one another and as far as being destructive there's a place that we take that's under the auspice of this agape love that brings us to the place of fighting that's why I believe Paul wrote this to Timothy as the good fight amen the good fight a lot of fights that take place that you look in the world 99 of the fights that happen whether it's verbal whether it's fisticuffs whether it's fighting uh battle something it's usually a fight of anger it's usually a fight of malice and jealousy uh the the killings and all of hatred and Malice but the fight that that Paul is encouraging us to fight is a good fight amen a good fight to fight of course is to strive or contest you're contesting for something you're not necessarily wanting to Pummel somebody because you hate them you although that probably would pertain to the devil I I don't mind at all pummeling him but but we'll find out as we know later as we probably already all know uh it's not a fight or a fist anyway amen our Warfare is not of this carnal our forefares of the uh of the spirit realm but so many times we train our fighting on one another we fight each other instead of instead of the one that's uh that's trying to cause the conflict the one that's trying to cause the contention the one that's trying to bring the division and that's the devil and that's where our fights should be trained to but even in our fight there we we are to give to fight a good fight amen a good fight striving contesting but good if you look at the word good for just a moment is to be honest or honorable to be good as honest or honorable even the Rich Young Ruler came to Jesus and G and a Rich Young Ruler said good master and and Jesus even looked at the Rich Young Ruler and said why do you call me good there is none good but God so if that puts in perspective scripturally what the word good means that we can understand the good fight the good fight of Faith holding on to the things that we know are right and are true because look friend you know and it has been prayed here and mentioned here today Satan is after every single facet of your life of godliness that he can get to he's trying to rob you and take from you every single thing that God daily is trying to give to you very much amen and even he wrote the foundation out from under that statue of a perfect man which is faith that's why we're the fight The Honorable fight of Faith The Honorable fight that that we stand and know that it's that fight that God gives us to fight for our faith so what we're doing is we're trying to hold on to that that belongs to us that that is ours that that is the foundation of our of our fundamental beliefs as Christians as as Faith to fight for that Faith because every single day Satan is robbing in this Satan's Eden people of their faith everything about this world today is to take Faith away from you yeah you to to to make everything so easy and so accessible right and so uh abundant that it takes the faith away now I I'm not praying asking and looking that we become uh broke poffers that are homeless I'm not talking about that uh but look we we have plenty of food in our cupboards we probably have at least some money in our bank accounts we have vehicles that we drive we have a nice place of worship the Lord give us we have a roof over our heads we have clothes on our backs uh I I don't look at anybody that's starving uh if you are let me know I'll I'll make sure that doesn't happen but God has blessed us so when it becomes in such an abundant uh accessibility it it loses its uh its it's faith that we need to hold on to uh we had medical insurance we have doctors we have hospitals and we have a medicine cabinets and and Tylenol and and Advil and and ibuprofen and and omeprazole and stuff for almost everything but it comes down to that place that we hold on to that faith and fight for that Faith every day to believe because there's so many other variables in life that calls for our faith to be able to sustain itself to believe for ourselves just like the uh the the testimonies we heard today uh just like the testimonies we've heard over the past few weeks about crying out to God and asking believing in faith to God that God answers that prayer God answers that Faith it's the faith that God answers you know that remember we've talked about faith many times it's the faith that God answers God will answer Faith even in Heathen if he's got faith yeah amen it's the faith that moves the hand of God you say well how can that be well how if we know that God is the only healer and an atheist gets sick and then healed who healed it there had to be some Faith there somewhere brother Adam said that God won't even hear the prayer of a bald-haired woman so how does she get healed how do things like this happen because of the faith the unmerited faith and Satan is trying to rob that from you yes Satan is trying in every way to steal that Faith from you that's why we must be more astute today must be more aware today than ever of those little things that Satan keeps trying to creep in on us to take that from you amen Satan is trying to rob it from you Saints look it's a it's a good fight of faith it's a good fight that keeps us look what the scripture says in Saint John uh Saint John chapter 10. Saint John chapter 10 verse 10. the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy so the enemy Satan not your brother or sister now not the neighboring sister Church but the enemy the thief Satan has come for one thing and that's to still kill and destroy you notice how the scripture wrote this he said the thief cometh not but to that's the reason he's here that's why the thief is here the thief is here to steal from you the thief is here to kill you to destroy you and look at these uh these adjectives that that Jesus is bringing each one of these is a part of the Ten Commandments Thou shalt not steal right Thou shalt not kill destroy amen Thou shalt not in the Beatitudes Jesus teaches the exact same thing but what does the thief come to do what a Satan come to at the exact opposite now will will the enemy work through individuals to try to do this absolutely will the enemy try to put people in your way put people in your life to try to get you to the place that this that this Faith becomes eroded in your life absolutely he will because he'll use any means possible to to rob from you to steal from you anything that God is trying to bring to you anything that you have from God even if you have it that you've got that God's gave to you Satan wants to take it from you right Amen to steal and to kill you so that you become destroyed before the Lord that's his purpose that's what he does amen and he's really good at it I'll give him those uh I'll give him those accolades he's good at it he's good at killing he's good at stealing he's good at destroying lives yes he is yeah and it's becoming more evident every day but see we're to fight the good fight amen The Honorable fight amen contend to to strive and contest so when he comes to try to take it from you no Satan you don't belong here get thee behind me Satan you have no place here amen is to rob from the true word the true word that God has delivered to you because remember what brings faith hearing hearing the word of God brings Faith so what's he doing even if it's something so subtle as to trying to pervert the word of God as as a minister would or seminary or something to try to add to take away to try to pervert the word in some way to try to hybridize the word in some way is to try to steal is to try to steal it robbed from you to destroy you just like in the Garden of Eden just like what happened with Eve in the Garden of Eden what did he do he did the exact same thing he took the word from her he perverted the word Satan continuously and don't think for a moment that Satan says back it's all there Christian there's no use in trying to get to them anymore uh you Devils over there don't worry about those people they're they're too far gone there's no way you can influence them absolutely not he'll never do that thing don't ever think that he won't always send his little demonic minions out your way to continually sum out maybe so we always think about this big huge Dynamic of Satan coming in and trying to destroy just all he cares about is just we can just get a little foothold if he gets even just get the little pinky toe in there to try to divide her to cause a wedge of some kind that's all he just just to try to wedge and get in there somehow to try to get you away from what you know is right for what you know is real then that's the world today he's here to kill uh uh steal and destroy that's his purpose he does everything in in every way to try to get us to that place now first Timothy back to First Timothy again try to Rob the world uh the the word from you to try to take from you that that God's give you to help build things because we we have to be as brother Dennis said earlier today we have to be as we're at these end times at the place of a building of Faith an increasing of faith amen the world is working hard as we read as Paul told Timothy the world is working so hard to try to build wealth and to build Fame and to build power and to build all these worldly things that will end up in rubble that'll mean absolutely nothing one day uh you look at Major catastrophes and and people of the rich the the rich people you know once that money is stripped away once their life is Stripped Away what do they have means nothing anymore but what we strive for is to establish and to gain the things that that that bring us into that Heavenly place that is their waiting for our Treasures is stored up in heaven waiting for us when we get there that's what we store up not the things you worry about of in this world the Lord will take care of us absolutely the Lord will bless us here absolutely but not to worry about building some kind of a kingdom here we're looking for that that God give us for the other side amen building that faith building that faith is by hearing and hearing the word of God yes the pure word of God not just any word not just any Ministry or any hybridization of the word or or anything like but the pure word of God for the hour for the day that we live now yes that we know that came through that message amen that made this Bible a new book Satan's come to rob that from you Satan has come to try to steal it from you must fight to continue to maintain that that God has given to you amen number one thing he tries mostly to steal from you is your time amen there's 24 hours in a day God's give us and it's the same every single day 24 hours and if Satan can keep us so busy that we never have time for anything else that he's then he has already begun to steal amen he's already begun to steal steal your time amen but now look uh first Timothy I had to turn first Timothy chapter one uh let's begin with verse 18. look at this now going back to the word now remember the building of Faith the word building in us for this last day it's got to build there's got to be a faith building in The Bride for a Rapture to take place for a body change there's got to be a building of Faith amen this uh this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might as wore a good Warfare now he's talking about Paul talking about the prophecy that had gone over and was spoke over Timothy that that would bring Timothy to this place that he is to fulfill this position in his life that he used to fulfill and to war to fight that good fights the same word here that good fight that good Warfare God has given him that is something that stabilizes now look holding what faith holding Faith praise the Lord and uh and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck Satan has come in and stole this from them Satan has come in and robbed them of this what this Faith his encouragement was holding faith hold on to this faith and stay steady and stable fight war against anyone anything that would try to take that and Rob that from you every day amen amen every day that's what to say that's what the devil's doing every day it's Robert from you that's why Paul's giving Tim this exhortation holding that faith and in good conscience some he says have put away concerning that faith and where does it leave them when they put away this current concerning of the faith has made them a shipwreck what is a shipwreck a shipwreck means that you have gone astray you have left the word what was it first a robbing of the faith when their faith was robbed and they did not hold on to that concerning of the faith they ended up off the word that's a shipwreck gone astray you say oh they still come to church absolutely oh they still preach yeah oh they still Philip yeah absolutely but what if but where have they gone astray in the word yeah look what he says now now uh we don't would not typically do this uh but as you read through the New Testament you find out that Paul had absolutely no qualms in calling names and here he does it again he says of home he's calling out a couple that have Shipwrecked have gone off the word of whom is hymenius and Alexander he calls them by name whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme wow that sounds rough Paul you really you you turn those over you turn those Brothers over to the devil absolutely amen a lot of people don't like that part of the scripture but it's the truth Amen brother Branham talked about it he talked about it even in the church in the Barham Tabernacle of turning them over to the devil through the destruction of their flesh so their soul might be saved what are they doing when they're blaspheming against God they've Shipwrecked themselves they've gone astray off the word they've left the pure word that was once delivered unto them and they've gone off onto a shipwreck not concerning themselves with the faith oh my so Paul turns them over to the devil and he had that authority to do that any Christian does amen he Christian mother father any Christian Pastor brother sister have that Authority you can do it a church can do that especially if that individual is under the protection of the blood of that church that church has that uh right to do amen if this person has gone off and obviously they were blasphemy now their blasphemy may not have been as much as uh what we've heard or seen today or uh coming back and saying things that people have said about the message and about brother Bradham and all that it may have been just as something as simple as just changing the word that was delivered to them yes amen Jesus said our uh Satan said uh surely you'll not die it's just a little change but that was a blasphemy why was it blasphemy because it was against God's word yes anything against God's word is blasphemy yes and these men were caught blaspheming God how oh it doesn't say but it could have been something just as simple as what they had been starting to preach on what they had started to deliver to the people by getting off the word made them Shipwrecked off the word left the faith left the truth not believing see when they left the word they left the faith because as I've said many times friend faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God but not just any word not just anybody's word it's the word of God it's got to be the pure unadulterated word of God not somebody's idea not some hash in some imagination or some uh uh Seminary or something it has to be the pure and adulterated word of God that's why God took a man like brother Branham like he did in faith bringing him in to to preach the message he did and give him the gifts he had it putting him in that position brother random couldn't attain to any great uh education he couldn't attain to any great social status he was no great big man no tall man nothing that anybody would would look to him and think anything about him but God was with him amen and when God is with you that changes everything yes amen God used that man to bring that word to bring that word that that Bible made a Bible and you put nothing nothing off the word nothing outside the word but to bring that word to make it light for this last day for thee for the people of God in that Faith to learn and to grow now Satan's here to try to steal it from you amen he didn't he tried when the brother Branham was here but he didn't try as hard as and bring it in as heavy as he does nowadays you know you all these people against the things that brother Brown said and stories and things like that or it wasn't in the newspaper all these other things the cloud and stuff you didn't hear them saying all that stuff when when brother Branham was here amen because he lived it you didn't hear him so much doing all that even when the brothers that witness it were here at that time but now as you see different ones going away brother mccus of brother green specifically here in this city and different ones that have passed on those that were with brother random have gone by the way of the Grave for the most part and aren't here to witness against it now and now you hear in full force what's the devil doing he's bringing it in here trying to steal and Rob and Destroy and kill everything he can now to come against that work or were they 20 40 50 years ago amen he knows that's when to strike but that's what means that we must contend we must fight that much harder to hold on to that that we know is ours that we know that that belongs to us that belongs to our families that we know is a part of our inheritance our posterity belongs to us doesn't belong to the devil but Satan's trying to steal them he's trying to rob from you what belongs to you Faith holds on Faith beliefs Faith doesn't doubt Faith doesn't let go Faith doesn't give up Faith holds on faith is true amen second Corinthians let's turn over to Second Corinthians chapter 10. friend when you go off the word either come back or you go off the edge there's only two choices amen either come back or go off the edge that's why Paul was turning them over to the devil so so that they've learned not to blaspheme and come back in their way in the way of truth yes and the way of Faith as he put it in the way of faith and he was given Timothy that lesson and telling Timothy fight that good Warfare hold on to that phase hold on to that these that God has spoke to you through these through these utterances through these prophecies hold on to that fulfill that purpose live that purpose but fight that good fight hold on to that Warfare and hold on to faith don't let it slip amen don't let it slip second Corinthians chapter 10. we'll begin reading with verse one now Paul now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in present and base among you but being absent and bold towards you but I beseech you that I may uh that I may not be bold when I am present with the uh with the confidence with that confidence where would I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds Satan's strongholds Faith does what it tears those strongholds down amen whoever they are wherever they are amen somebody may look to be the strongest crustiest hardest so you'll never win them to Christ that's exactly what they thought here and and he's saying that we we take the Weaponry of God that is mighty to pull that stronghold down bring that person to their knees bring them where they're supposed to be in Christ amen if they belong to you then you have that right amen that is your inheritance that is your right casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God what is it what is the knowledge of God the knowledge of God is really and speaking here is not intellectualism it's revelation of the true revealed word and the knowledge of God is what Paul is speaking of that the Lord used him to bring fruit and other brothers but the truth of God the messenger of that age amen against it exalted itself against the word the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ Christ is the word so what does he do it takes all of your thoughts anything that comes in your mind as a thought of yours a reasoning of yours how many times we try to reason things away oh I do this because on you reason or what all the word says but I thought you knew reasonable but the Bible says Paul says to bring every one of those thoughts captive to The Obedience of the word amen of Christ the word amen obedience to this word remember obedience is better than sacrifice amen we're to bring all of it together well I can't do this bring it to The Obedience of the word the word says you can oh I I don't do you bring it to The Obedience of the word every thought every thought that you have every reasoning that you have you take that see because remember now Satan will give you a thought and he'll drop a thought in your mind and he'll have you thinking that's your fault the whole time he dropped it in there he'll have you repenting for a thought that you thought you had that he put on you right and you're repenting for something you didn't even do that's the truth that's Satan's thought yeah that's why it says you take that thought you bring it captive to the word yes the word Christ and you bring a captive to that word it's like uh it's like a virus in a computer they have a antivirus and I probably shouldn't go here because I'm pretty ignorant in this situation but I know that what an antivirus does if a virus comes it's supposed to grab that virus and identify it and say okay that's not that's a foreign object that's not supposed to be in here amen think of it now that's your mind that's your mind now let this mind be in you which is in Christ Jesus and we're not talking carnal remember we're talking our spiritual warfare and you bring that into obedience to the word because that for an object is trying to come in your head to try to take you away from the word or bring it contrary to the word you take that thought and that antiverse says that doesn't belong here and it takes that thought and it throws it into a uh a vault and it seals The Vault so it doesn't corrupt the rest of your computer amen pretty cold quarantine yeah quarantine I mean quarantine means nobody can come in and they can't get out that's what a quarantined every thought captive quarantine take it in can't get out and it can't corrupt the rest of the computer you take every thought that comes against God's word you read in that word and there's and then trust me friends there are high menuses and and uh the other one they're they're out there today and they're out there preaching and they're out there to try to convince you that the things that you know God has delivered to you are not true but you look at God's word and it says in God's word that is true you take that thought captive and you put it in quarantine amen because it doesn't belong in you your thoughts should be obedience to this word yes every word I don't know about every word amen amen our thoughts are supposed to come in obedience to this word even if Satan puts that thought there something that Satan is trying to push on you try to get you to believe her or or entertain and it's just all along it was his thought that came in there cast down those imaginations cast down those reasonings bring every one of them to obedience to the word if there's a foreign matter that comes that's not supposed to be there because your mind is like the mind of Christ you take that word and that word is your antivirus and it takes that thought and puts it in quarantine or sends it back on the head of the devil where it lays till the day of judgment and Devil comes up and accuses you of that thought and God looks and says that was your thought devil not my son not my daughter that was your thought and you're going to be held accountable to that thought in the Lake of Fire praise God god holds his children Guiltless praise the lord we belong to him because you're bringing in obedience to the word and obedience to Christ the word bringing into captivity every thought every thought to The Obedience of Christ which is the word and having in a uh and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled praise the Lord every thought Saints let's go to one more second Timothy chapter four second Timothy chapter four you'll find obedience in God's word will make your life a lot easier amen amen you'll find obedience to God's word will make your life a lot better yes it'll make your life less of a struggle it'll make your life a lot easier if we just follow an obedience to God's word it won't be without fights it won't be without balance it won't be without the devil coming and trying to steal it from you but your life will be better amen speaking from somebody with experience who has gone outside of The Obedience of God it's hard I I don't think I can imagine as a child that any child has ever enjoyed a woman or a timeout or whatever they are today I can't imagine any one of them but I bet they can tell you that they learned something from it I got discipline for this because this was displeasing to my parents I got discipline for this as a child of God because it was Disobedience to God amen and God discipline us so that we're not chastened with the world so that we're not judged with the world so that we're not condemned with the world God chastens us so that we realize Lord it brings us to a repentance Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to act that whatever it might have been brings it into obedience Lord I'm sorry and you can trust me if there's less of those your life is a lot easier it's harder as a child I know when a child has feeling his way and trying to so is oats or his as a as a little kid and and try to be rebellious and trying to fight and and and trying to find his way you know it takes a good Godly parent right there to put that child right back where he's supposed to be now you got today you got what they call free-range parenting oh just let the child do whatever he wants it'll be okay just you know if you want if you want to go bounce a basketball in the middle of the Oracle go right ahead it's okay you'll be all right just free-range parenting let the child that's what they call it just let the child do whatever they want if they want to be a boy one day and a girl the next day if they don't want to be either one day or whatever it's okay you know you'll be all right you know love will eventually conquer no a parent has to be there to train that child yeah to Reign that child in and that's because that's the example God gives us if God just said okay you just go do like a lot of Christians believe that God he just winks and ignorance you just go do whatever you want it's okay it'll all come and Rewind itself around back in the no no if you're a child of God and you get off the off the path God will discipline you so that you're not condemned with the world yes to bring you back to the place you're supposed to be to be that Godly person that God's called for us bring in obedience everything in obedience second Timothy chapter four read this scripture and I will close here II Timothy chapter 4 verse 1. I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead the alive and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine the truth Revelation the word they will not endure it they want it but after them after their own lust shall they heed to themselves teachers having itching years and remember a hireling doesn't care about the Sheep that's what Jesus said only the shepherd cares about the sheep and Harley doesn't care about the Sheep if a man is just up there for a meal ticket if he's just up there to be popular powerful against some wealth of some kind then he doesn't care about the Sheep harling doesn't care about the Sheep only the shepherd cares about the Sheep right amen so it hireling is someone that it teaches having itchy ears that'll just come in and just uh say whatever the congregation wants to hear you know I I believe it this way but you know my congregation the way they are I won't say that I I won't preach it like that I won't I won't preach it this way I won't bring that message or that subject because it would upset my congregation teachers having itching years not bringing the pure word of God and what they know they should do amen it's a perversion saint s amen preach your convictions Praise Your Truth stand on that word that's the truth or help or or or bring together somebody I I I may have told you this story but I remember years ago when I uh when I worked in um uh in Charlotte and I was hired in as a assistive buyer assistant uh purchasing agent and we had sales Consultants calling us all the time and there was one sales consultant he was pretty uh he was pretty I would say staunching his religious belief he didn't hide it under a bushel he didn't uh he didn't pull any punches he let everybody know he's a Christian he went to church and and that kind of thing and he was talking with the buyer at the time his name was Roy and he was trying to get Roy to go to church he really is just just trying to go to church I don't talk to people and say you need to go to church I try when I try to witness some people I tell people you need to get to Christ yes amen I'm not worried about getting somebody into four walls into some kind of an assembly I'm worried about getting people to Jesus Christ yes if you get them to Christ Christ will lead them where they're supposed to be he was trying to roll you just need to go to church he said he said just pick one you like he said a church is like a glove you know if it fits if the preachers just say whatever you want him to say he's saying whatever you want to hear you just go to that church I want a soul why the devil I'm sitting in the room across the hall in my office I think what a subtle lie the devil to tell a man like that something like that being a professed Christian I'm not putting the man down uh they're probably both passed by now anyway they were older men but I I thought what a lie the devil that is absolutely you don't go to church to try to fit like a glove right you go to church to let the word of God be preached to you and God sometimes take the hot off her backs sometimes hear the pure word of God sometime in correction to bring us back because we've gotten off the path Lord help me I need to get back right with you that's fighting for the good fight amen that's fighting for the faith that was once delivered where is it gone oh God where has that gone people have lost their fight yes people have given up people say well we'll just go it's like I said before you know coming into a little place like this a lot of people will be embarrassed to be in a place like this there's so few people it's a job we just done the past couple of times up in Colorado Springs that the the little area is called New Life even the commons there is called New Life Commons and you look over and there's this big humongous building with a cross at the top of the church and I had that guy I told you before that uh that that I still call them curmudgeon he's not anymore but you remember the guy told us he's kind of come one of my friends now um um and it's amazing the influence but anyway and he he looked he said oh there's tons of money in that he said that looks like your Church Newton I said my church wouldn't even fit in that Church's bathroom he started laughing amen I said that we'd probably have to we'd probably have to double in size to fit in that Church's bathroom amen but that's what it is to those people it's time saints that we fight that we fight harder than ever amen because that's exactly the slippery slope that Satan is trying to take us down to yes oh Paul is telling Timothy preach the word be in C's not a seasoned friend if God reveals something to me that I know you don't agree with I'm sorry but I'm gonna preach it yes amen amen that that's just the way it is amen it'll it'll it'll be on the word amen but if it's if it's against any if it rubs anybody it just rubs you amen God Brothers me plenty of times correcting us bringing us back to where we should be but they're bringing people together with their own lusts their own lusts he'd be to themselves teachers having itchy ears a Charlie does not care about the Sheep it does not care whether he's preaching the pure word because he's an Ireland he doesn't care if the Sheep get taken over by the Wolves he's just in harmony amen it's not my responsibility it's not my job it's not my place standing behind that Pulpit it is if you're standing as a as a a a a a minister of God it is yes it is amen they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto Fables what is that off the word but watch thou on all things endure afflictions do the work of the Evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fault what I have thought the good fight did he come across people that he had to fight the good fight with absolutely amen if it was of the devil anything that's off the word is of the devil I have fought thee good fight I have kept I have finished my course I have kept the faith praise the Lord I want that to be my testimony when it comes to time that I'm about to draw my last breath yes amen if this man don't make it by a Rapture the body change friend when my last breath comes I want that to be my testimony yes to be able to stand and say I fought the good fight I have finished my course and I have kept the faith praise the Lord don't let anything steal it from these things yeah fight that good fight yes continue to press forward and everything that Satan's doing in this world to try to Rob our faith promise everything that we have we've got it we've got it so good we do and I'm not complaining about that God's blessed us so but we've got it so good so many times we look and say words are Faith do we need Faith now in in so many of the things that we need you know you go over Caesar I've heard I'm not a missionary but hard to go overseas and people just don't have anything they don't have any food no money no means and and they simply live on faith if they get sick they don't have a doctor they don't have a medicine you haven't they don't have even if they had a doctor probably not even close to the type of education and knowledge that we have in this country of a doctor in hospitals in the cleanliness and all they don't have that they just gotta purely simply believe that faith how Satan is trying so hard to Rob us of that friends but we can't let it happen amen we can't let it happen and I'm so thankful I'm so thankful of so many of the testimonies that I hear amen of how things come up and you just call out to the Lord there he is again something as simple as keys or a printer or a car or all the things forgive me if they failed good tests all the things if it's just something just that simple you know that Rings true in your soul it says I believe that God was going to let that happen that God was going to lead me to that that God was going to show me this or help me with this and bring me to that place if it just just the Simplicity of those things amen that's the faith that's that faith that we fight for when brother Dennis was going through his cancer thing and all that all over the place and all over his house and everywhere he went I don't know how many pennies he collected but they were everywhere just just the Simplicity of God showing him I'm with you faith believing I'm gonna take care of you and he did Simplicity but it's God but we fight the good fight The Honorable fight we don't do it with anger we don't do it with malice that we see so many times I've seen people even debate and I know the Bible says come reason and we and and people of different thoughts even in the message seeing it this way or seeing it that way and they come together and there just seems to be such a such a an angry contention a contention of malice and and even hatred to the point that how could you not believe this you're going to hell if you don't see it the way I do just attitude like that is that is not of God and I've seen that so many times I saw two brothers come out of brother Brandon used to tell the story uh brother green would reiterate the story the two brothers getting and throwing rocks at each other uh you know it was a comical thing but I don't believe that that's that we should come to that place to where we hate each other so much we're throwing rocks verbal or physical amen but we do fight the good honorable honest honorable fight praise the Lord how did how did he fight how does he fight for you what did God do to fight to bring you back to where you need to be he gave his only begotten son yes could he have banished the Devil complete that of existence within the twinkling of an eye absolutely did he do it no no he has to go through this all this whole process just like every one of us and go to the very end where he's guilty of every sin that he ever felt like he caused you to commit he'll be guilty of it and cast in the Lake of Fire that'll be his demise yeah because God is a just God is a righteous God Amen God is God is a god of uh of of patience and long-suffering amen but he's a God that doesn't change he's a god of his word amen and he's a just God praise the Lord let's stand our feet if we could fight the good fight scenes stand on that word hold true to that conviction that God gave you that God has built to this on that Foundation our foundation that we talk so much of would we always major so much on the Capstone and the brotherly kindness and all and all the things at the top which I agree we're we're there I don't disagree with that friend but you can't ever it's like people major so much on getting the Holy Ghost and that's true and we should that's absolutely Paramount for us you won't make it in the Rapture without it but you can't take that and forget about justification you can't just let justification go you can't even get to the Holy Ghost without justification it's a step that brings you to that place and you can't forget the faith you can't let the faith go that's the foundation of the whole building yes we're getting that at that Capstone the bride love but without the foundation there's no way you're going to get there amen can't happen praise the Lord but God makes a way God always makes a way don't let the left don't let the devil steal it from you amen I want to sing this song we didn't sing it during service Micah mentioned it amen uh it's it's in the songbook I don't remember let's see it's 263 in the songbook but we'll have it here on my screen if you want to read it there amen let's start with the chorus it's been a while since we sang it amen different now praise the Lord amen yes different now since Jesus saved my soul is different now since far he is what I'm hold oh Satan had to flee when Jesus rescued me now is different oh so different now once I was lost in sin I had no peace within to save my weary soul I knew not help but Jesus came to me and by his grace I'm free now is different oh so different now is different now since Jesus saved my soul it's different now since by his blood I am born oh [Music] I went to church one day do you hear them sing and pray the preacher firmly follow that gospel wow he said you must read and now so different now now it is [Music] now with different clothes [Music] but just one lens of him it broke the power of man now this difference [Music] it's different now since by his time when [Music] I Praise Him day and night how do you so I know but a praise the Lord is done the victory now is gone now is different now since Jesus in my soul is different goodbye is [Music] different now since Jesus Christ old days [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah always different now Saints isn't it yeah praise the Lord Jesus one Satan had his grip but Jesus came and loosed and set me free made everything different the life I used to love I now hate the life I used to hate I now love because he made it different praise the Lord Jesus in me he is and different by his grace amen praise the Lord Jesus thank God for that amen God bless you today I pray something was said to bless and strength in the Lord today amen I want to mention a couple things I mentioned last week that brother Roger had invited us to a communion service they're having tonight if you'd like to go their service starts at five o'clock if you need the address I'll get you the address or text it to your whatever so if you uh desire to go the Lord willing I do plan to go so I plan to be there if you want to go just let me know like I said it starts at five o'clock and I get you the address if you'd like it also uh next week I am going to Pennsylvania uh flying out on Mother's Day to Pennsylvania and the only flight uh that I could get leaves at 1 30. so I'm going to try to probably start a little early uh the service so that uh can be done a little sooner than normal and uh and because I got to be at the airport by 12 30 which if this service was today is 15 minutes from right now so um so I told him I said it's okay I'll work it out we can um I'll start a little early and maybe have one less song or something now if you have a testimony or you have a song or something I'm not wanna I don't want to disclose the Holy Ghost if the Lord's giving you something on your heart and to do uh by all means amen we'll do it the Lord if he can hold a plane for a profit in Memphis he can hold a plane for me so uh I'm I'm not gonna let it affect in that way so if it's something on your heart then by all means don't say well we've got to be in a hurry Sunday and I don't want to be that way uh but I probably will start a little early and maybe I won't have as many songs uh and just see what the message is the Lord gives us for Mother's Day so so please thank you remember that keep that on your heart um for next Sunday so Lord willing it's uh it there was a couple of flights that left later at night but and it left at seven here at night and didn't get there until seven in the morning so that didn't really quite work we're actually on the job before seven o'clock so anyway uh just to let you know that we will probably be starting a little bit early next Sunday I was going to do like 10 20. something like that not I wasn't I know you know there's been a little resistance about 10 o'clock which is fine I like 10 30 myself yeah but if everybody thinks they can do 10 o'clock that's fine too um you know we very seldom ever have any visitors that uh come knowing it's 10 30 so I don't know that that would be a huge hindrance but we could do 10 if you do anybody have an objection since Norman says okay uh if you if you do though let me know because well then we'll just make it 10 o'clock next Sunday okay that'll work that that'll be fine then appreciate that thank you um so thank you Lord bless you appreciate you in that and thank you for your prayers this past week uh what why does what white is harder we've had a couple two three days that were a little more so but uh we got done with most everything by Thursday so Thursday and Friday were pretty light so I got a little bit more rest I didn't leave yesterday morning till 11 30 from Denver so I got to sleep a little bit later uh so that helped me get a little bit more rest so Lord willing I know I told you last week was kind of going to be on how I feel or whether to go to brother Rogers but right now I feel uh I feel like I've all want to go anyway but feel physically able to so so again I appreciate your prayers and again the trip was great the Lord blessed it and flights were great so amen I appreciate your prayers always going up to the Lord for me it means a lot to me so yeah amen God bless you so I haven't thought of anything for the to have a meal together but just in the Lord and show something so I may just ask I may just ask him if we just can use that place behind us further by day instead of renting it every month just just see if he'll let us use it for a day I'm not sure but I can ask so we'll see Lord bless you anyone else have anything else before we go amen praise the Lord God bless you richly appreciate each one of you being here brother Pat would you just miss us compare the
