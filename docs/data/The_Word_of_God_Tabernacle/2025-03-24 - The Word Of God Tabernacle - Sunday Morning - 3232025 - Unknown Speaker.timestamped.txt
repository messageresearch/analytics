[9:20] us from your word, Lord. And may you,
[9:22] God, get the uh praise, glory, and honor
[9:25] for all that is sent and done today.

[9:30] hands, we ask these blessings in the
[9:32] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[9:34] Christ. Amen. And you can be seated if
[9:37] you'd like. Amen. Turn over with me to
[9:39] song number 317. If you have the book,
[9:42] if you're home, 317, we'll have it on
[9:44] the screen. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes.
[9:48] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. And how
[9:50] many wants to say yes to him and all
[9:53] that he leads us and guides us to do.
[9:56] Praise the Lord. Sometimes it might not
[9:58] be easy. Might not be the easiest road,
[10:01] but we know it'll be the best road.
[10:02] Amen. Praise the
[10:05] Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes. To thy
[10:10] will and to thy way. I'll say yes, Lord,
[10:15] yes. I will trust you and obey when your
[10:21] spirit speaks to me with my whole heart.
[10:26] I will be and my answer will be yes Lord

[12:20] 377. Amen. We have it on the screen.
[12:23] 377. I'll say yes, Lord, because the
[12:26] Lord knows the way. Amen. Praise God.
[12:30] What better way, Amen. to know? You
[12:33] know, this is probably a crude analogy,
[12:36] but uh uh you know, when they play golf,
[12:38] they have a caddy and they have somebody
[12:41] carries their clubs around. A lot of
[12:43] people don't know golf realize a caddy
[12:46] does a lot more than just carry clubs.
[12:48] The caddy has to get the landscape of
[12:50] the land. And say if the ball goes here,
[12:53] how far is it to here? And uh if the
[12:56] ball lands at this part of the green, is
[12:58] the ball going to go this way toward the
[13:00] hole or that way toward the hole? Is it
[13:01] going to go fast? is going to go slow.
[13:04] Amen. He is responsible for knowing the
[13:06] way. He is responsible for the one to
[13:09] say, "Okay, you need to use this here
[13:11] because you go." So, see, when the Lord
[13:13] knows the way, all we have to do is say,
[13:16] "Yes." Amen. Praise the Lord. It's so
[13:19] glad to know that the God we serve
[13:22] already knows the way. Amen. We may not
[13:24] know what tomorrow holds, but he does.
[13:27] Praise the Lord. 377. Let's sing it.
[13:29] Amen.

[18:03] bring me out and show me the
[18:07] way. Well, like a bird out of prison.
[18:12] Hallelujah. That is singing it
[18:16] fly. Like a blind man that

[19:59] aren't you glad you're free today?
[20:02] Praise the Lord God. Amen. Oh, saints. I
[20:06] spend a whole work week with a crew of
[20:08] guys that are just bound. They are so
[20:11] bound. I try so hard to set them free.
[20:15] Amen. Maybe one day. Never know. There's
[20:18] always a reason why the Lord does
[20:20] things. Amen. But I look around, I say,
[20:22] "Oh, they're just so bound. They don't
[20:23] know it." That's the worst part about
[20:25] it. That's the worst part about Le
[20:28] Oysia. Yes. Brother says, "They're poor,
[20:30] miserable, blind, wretched, naked, but
[20:32] they don't know it." That's the worst
[20:34] part. Yes. Oh my. If you're out in the
[20:36] street, you know you're naked, you can
[20:38] put some clothes on. You know, if you if
[20:41] you uh you don't know something, you
[20:43] might can go learn it. Amen. But if you
[20:46] don't know, you don't know, right? It's
[20:48] a miserable state. All saints, we can be
[20:51] so cynical about it. Amen. But you know,
[20:54] poor people out there just don't know.
[20:56] They're just blind. Amen. Oh, God. Have
[21:00] mercy, Lord. Amen. It's by his grace
[21:03] that we can only only by his grace that
[21:06] we can stand today and be called and as
[21:10] one of his. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[21:13] So glad I am free. Amen. Thank you,
[21:15] Lord. We'll go to the Lord in prayer
[21:18] now. Take up any prayer requests. I do
[21:21] not have any prayer requests. Uh I
[21:23] haven't gotten I know we don't have uh
[21:26] very many people here yet. The kids are
[21:29] uh in Sunday school, but u I haven't
[21:31] gotten any prayer
[21:34] requests except for Sister Julie. Uh she
[21:38] her ride got messed up somehow, so she
[21:41] wasn't able to make it. She still
[21:42] doesn't have her license yet. Um she's
[21:45] supposed to know from the doctor Tuesday
[21:46] or Wednesday about the results of the
[21:49] EEG. And prayerfully, we're believing
[21:52] that they're going to be good, positive
[21:54] results, and then she can get her
[21:56] license back. So,
[21:57] uh uh it's been a real hindrance to her
[22:00] in many ways. Number one is coming to
[22:03] church and then getting a job. So, we're
[22:05] just praying the Lord would just help
[22:07] her and bless her and being able to get
[22:08] her license back. Amen. Yes, sister.
[22:12] Sister Karen text us last night about
[22:14] her. Yes. Sister Karen, of course.
[22:16] Exactly. Yes. Sorry about that. K.
[22:18] Sister Karen is not here because she's
[22:21] not feeling well. My wife told me that
[22:22] yesterday on the way home from the
[22:24] airport. Pardon me. Thank you for
[22:26] mentioning it. It slipped my mind.
[22:27] Sister Karen is not feeling well uh
[22:30] today. So, let's please remember her in
[22:31] prayer. I imagine most of you u got that
[22:35] text. I wish we would delete that. My
[22:38] mistake to send that out to her because
[22:41] now that that's out there. I can't
[22:43] change it. So, anytime anybody posts in
[22:46] that thread, everybody will get it. So,
[22:49] my apologies. Uh delete it. Hopefully it
[22:53] won't happen again, but you probably all
[22:56] got it. Sister Karen, see, please
[22:57] remember her in prayer. Did get good
[22:59] news last week. Sister Lydia's uh test
[23:02] came back uh as she said negative. All
[23:05] is good uh in the negative context. So
[23:10] very thankful for that that sister Lydia
[23:12] is doing well by the grace of God and
[23:14] just trusting strength back day by day
[23:17] and hope to see her very soon. So amen.
[23:20] remember that in prayer as well. Uh I
[23:23] did not uh I I I've heard from Sister
[23:26] Matise uh but I uh she didn't say she
[23:30] wasn't going to be here today, but let's
[23:31] please remember her in prayer as well.
[23:33] Amen. Praise the Lord. Anyone else have
[23:36] spoken requests, brother Dennis? Yes,
[23:38] it'll be this Wednesday. Uh Leah will
[23:41] have surgery to have her gallbladder
[23:44] removed. She is still having problems.
[23:47] Even yesterday, she can hardly eat
[23:50] just upsets her stomach and just so hard
[23:54] on her. So, let's remember her. Amen.
[23:59] Praise the Lord. Let's remember it's
[24:01] Wednesday. Does she have a time yet?
[24:03] Wednesday. She has to be at the
[24:05] hospital, Northwest Hospital on 9:00.
[24:09] Her surgery is scheduled for 11.
[24:13] Remember
[24:15] her. Also remember me and my wife will
[24:17] be traveling this week. going out of
[24:19] town for a little uh I guess RNR you'd
[24:23] say little rest relaxation just getting
[24:26] away just the two of us for a few days.
[24:28] So we'll be back Friday night late. So
[24:30] we're leaving Tuesday morning at 6:00

[24:45] much. I appreciate that. Anyone else?
[24:49] Yeah. Yes. Uh I know we've been praying
[24:52] for my friend Ron this week. He had a
[24:56] real bad setback. He was in ICU, but
[25:00] with the grace of God and our prayers,
[25:03] he's out of ICU now.
[25:08] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Heard they
[25:11] released the Pope yesterday. Amen. We're
[25:14] not Catholic, but we do know the
[25:16] spiritual significance of that
[25:18] situation. So, amen. Let's all stand to
[25:21] our feet if we could. Amen. I believe we
[25:23] all have unspoken requests in our
[25:25] hearts. We always have those things. We
[25:27] just lift before the Lord in our hearts.
[25:30] Amen. And just trust the Lord on those
[25:32] requests. Brother Dennis, would you take
[25:35] us for us? Lord Jesus, it's an honor and
[25:40] privilege to be once again in your house
[25:43] of worship. Lord Jesus, your house of
[25:45] prayer. A time to refresh our spirits by
[25:50] the hearing of your word. Amen. Lord,
[25:52] knowing that faith cometh by hearing and
[25:55] hearing of the word of God. Thank you,
[25:56] Lord Jesus. What speaks to my heart as
[25:59] you should carry, Father, the devil's
[26:01] fighting us harder than ever. my
[26:04] worldliness can creep so easy in our
[26:06] lives. Yes, God. Where we'll get away
[26:09] from your word, not recognizing it,
[26:11] Father. We all be identified with uh
[26:16] things of the world and and dressing
[26:18] like the world and speaking like the
[26:20] world and acting like the world. Oh,
[26:23] Father, I heard your prophet in in the
[26:26] message that his worst enemy was William
[26:30] Brandom. How much more can we put our
[26:33] names right there? My worst enemy is
[26:36] Dennis Katie. Lord, get us out of the
[26:39] way. Let us be a bride that is pleasing,
[26:44] that is walking in step with your word,
[26:47] Father. Yes, Lord. Oh, Lord, as the word
[26:51] says, let us endure hardness as a good
[26:54] soldier of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[26:57] father don't let us in any way
[27:01] compromise. It's your life in us that
[27:03] gives us a victory to become a real uh
[27:07] Christian. Father, I just heard just
[27:11] this morning how your prophet said as
[27:14] our pastors even been teaching all
[27:16] through the ages the word got lost. And
[27:20] then it started with justification,
[27:23] sanctification, restoring of the gifts.
[27:26] And now the bride age is where you the
[27:30] fullness of Jesus Christ can appear in
[27:34] his body and father. Amen. Oh, that's
[27:37] what we strive for. Jesus, get us out of
[27:39] the way. There are needs. There are
[27:42] precious people in our body that need a
[27:45] touch from you. Yes, Lord. Yes. We
[27:47] cannot even begin to have compassion to
[27:51] pray one for another if your love is not
[27:54] working, your life is not totally having
[27:58] control in our lives. Yes, Lord. Oh
[28:00] Lord. Amen. We want to remember Sister
[28:02] Karen who's been feeling sick, that she
[28:06] might have a cold flu. Whatever she's
[28:08] going through, we know it's a lie of the
[28:10] devil. Amen. We rebuke you, Satan. in
[28:14] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You have
[28:16] no hold on God's property. And when we
[28:20] claim victory for our sister and Lord,
[28:23] for my wife, she's been having stomach
[28:26] problems all for weeks now. And she'll
[28:30] be having her surgery this Wednesday to
[28:32] have her gallbladder removed. Oh Lord,
[28:35] may you come on the scene and guide the
[28:37] surgeon's hands. Lord, may all go well
[28:41] for for your honor and for your glory.
[28:44] And I know the hour's late. Father, I've
[28:46] been praying since I've known her for
[28:48] almost 21 years that she'll see the
[28:52] light of your word for this day. But
[28:55] Lord, there's so many are are so
[28:58] deceived. They think, well, the
[29:00] Baptists, they're they're good. They're
[29:02] they have truth. The Catholics, they
[29:06] have truth. The uh Calvary people, they

[32:04] Ephesians
[32:05] 6:108. The armor of God. Finally, be
[32:09] strong in the Lord and in his mighty
[32:12] power. Put on the full armor of God so
[32:15] that you can take your stand against the
[32:18] devil's schemes. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[32:21] For our struggle is not against flesh
[32:23] and blood, but against the rulers,
[32:25] against the authorities, against the
[32:27] powers of this dark world, against the
[32:30] spiritual forces of evil and the
[32:32] heavenly realms. Therefore, put on the
[32:35] full armor of God so that when the day
[32:38] of evil comes, you may be able to stand
[32:40] your ground. And done everything to
[32:43] stand. Amen. Stand firm then with the
[32:48] belt of truth buckled around your waist
[32:53] with the breastplate of righteousness in
[32:57] place and with your
[33:00] feet with the readiness that comes from
[33:06] the gospel of peace.
[33:09] Amen.
[33:11] Addition to all this, take up the shield
[33:16] of
[33:17] faith with which you
[33:21] can extinguish all the fling arrows of
[33:26] the
[33:28] evil. Take the helmet of salvation and
[33:32] the
[33:35] spirit which is the word of God. Amen.
[33:39] Amen. Amen. And pray in the spirit on
[33:42] all occasions with all kinds of prayers

[36:36] Amen. Maybe we'll uh sing the last song
[36:39] I had. We'll sing it after after we get
[36:42] done with service. Amen. But we're going
[36:45] to turn uh if we can stand and turn in
[36:48] the scripture to
[36:50] u Acts chapter 2 again. Sort of where we
[36:53] left off last week. Uh I said we were
[36:57] just going to try to uh hit that just
[37:00] for a moment.
[37:01] U and pick up there this week. So Lord
[37:06] willing, that's what we plan to do is
[37:08] start back where we left off. Acts
[37:10] chapter 2. Uh read the first few verses
[37:14] of scripture here.
[37:19] Amen. Praise the
[37:21] Lord. Acts chapter 2. Uh we're going to
[37:25] read the first few verses of scripture
[37:26] here. Amen. But before we do, could we
[37:29] just bow our heads for another word of
[37:31] prayer? Lord Jesus, we're so very
[37:33] thankful again, Lord. God, to see you
[37:37] moving in all of our lives. Lord,
[37:41] I just and so reminded Lord of the
[37:43] scripture that says to train them up the
[37:45] way they should go and Lord the little
[37:48] children and Art and Shri and Zach and
[37:51] Tabitha bringing their children Lord and
[37:53] just starting another generation and
[37:55] raising them in the nurture and
[37:56] admonition of God. We don't know how
[37:58] much longer we have here Lord. We don't
[38:00] know how much more time we've got. We
[38:02] don't know how many more generations may
[38:04] or may not rise up. But Lord, as each
[38:07] one does, we just commit them to you. We
[38:10] dedicate them to you. We consecrate them
[38:12] to you. Raise them. The parents raise
[38:15] them in the nurture and admonition of
[38:17] God. And just see the results, Lord, of
[38:21] the children being raised in church and
[38:23] being raised with godly parents and
[38:25] being raised with uh scriptural
[38:27] principles. Lord, it just means so much.
[38:30] It just touches my heart so much, Lord,
[38:33] when I see so much wicked on the world
[38:35] today. And when I see so many kids,
[38:37] these kids age out in the world and just
[38:40] living all kinds of lives and the
[38:42] parents and the way things are, Lord, it
[38:44] just saddens me when I see something
[38:46] like that. It just it just renews my
[38:49] faith. It renews my joy. It gives me
[38:51] strength, Lord. And I I I appreciate,
[38:54] Lord, so much, God, the effort that's
[38:57] been done here, Lord. We just pray God
[39:00] now Lord that your Holy Spirit would
[39:02] take complete control Lord and the
[39:04] remaining part of this service Lord the
[39:07] ministering of your word trusting and
[39:08] believing God it's according to your
[39:10] perfect will and purpose in all of our
[39:12] lives Lord we rebuke every demonic
[39:15] spirit that would try to hurt hinder
[39:16] infiltrate this service in any way that
[39:19] you get the glory honor and praise for
[39:20] all that is said and done for we're here
[39:23] Lord to learn of you. We're here for you
[39:24] to speak to us. We're here for you,
[39:26] Lord, to have preeminence in all of our
[39:29] lives, God. And may you do that now.
[39:31] Preeminence in these lips, preeminence
[39:33] in our ears, Lord. Let this word, God,
[39:36] just anchor into our souls, Lord. And
[39:39] help us to grow in you and to become
[39:41] more like you, Father. Yes. We desire,
[39:43] Lord, nothing more than to than for the
[39:46] world to see us, see you in us, God. So
[39:50] may you grant it today. and we commit it
[39:51] to you and pray your holy spirit would
[39:53] have preeminence once again now Lord as
[39:56] we relinquish ourselves our ideas
[39:58] thoughts opinions feelings our physical
[40:01] be being to you that you have your way
[40:04] in it we just thank you father for it in
[40:06] the name of the lord Jesus Christ we
[40:08] pray amen
[40:11] amen praise the lord Jesus chapter 2
[40:15] amen we'll begin with just verse one
[40:18] chapter 2 verse
[40:20] One, when the day of Pentecost was fully
[40:23] come, they were all with one accord in
[40:25] one place. And suddenly there came a
[40:28] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[40:30] wind, and it filled all the house where
[40:32] they were sitting. There appeared unto
[40:35] them cloven tongues like as a fire, and
[40:38] it sat upon each of them. And they were
[40:40] all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
[40:42] began to speak with other tongues, as
[40:45] the Spirit gave them utterance. And
[40:48] there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews,
[40:50] devout men out of every nation under
[40:52] heaven. Now when these this was noised
[40:55] abroad, the multitude came together
[40:57] where they uh and were confounded
[41:00] because that every man heard them speak
[41:03] in their own language. You can be seated
[41:05] if you'd like.
[41:12] So we left off last week. Amen. kind of
[41:14] finished up with that uh uh with the
[41:17] last part of the maturity that we had
[41:19] gone through and realizing that that
[41:21] maturity from the Old
[41:23] Testament was a type and shadow of the
[41:26] fulfillment of the New Testament where
[41:28] Jesus Christ was to come and live, give
[41:31] his life and die and come back upon the
[41:34] people again. As we see here on the day
[41:36] of Pentecost, the promise of the word
[41:38] was fulfilled when uh Jesus Christ came
[41:42] back in the form of the Holy Spirit. God
[41:44] Almighty himself in the form of a Holy
[41:47] Spirit, not a third person, but God
[41:49] Almighty himself coming in the form of
[41:52] the Holy Spirit lighting upon every one
[41:55] of them and filling them all with the
[41:57] Holy Ghost. It was the promise that God
[42:00] had gained. It was a promise. And so
[42:02] many times we look at promises that God
[42:04] gives us today and we look and see
[42:06] things maybe far off in the future or
[42:09] something. But this promise that God
[42:11] gave, of course, when it was given
[42:12] hundreds or thousands of years before,
[42:15] amen, it did take a while for it to come
[42:17] to its place. But we know that us living
[42:20] in the day that we live, that there's
[42:22] nothing that is to be left that that
[42:25] will not be fulfilled in this day. This
[42:28] is the time. This is the hour that we
[42:30] live. This is the finalization of the
[42:32] world's history. Yes. So, we're looking
[42:34] back and recognizing what God said he
[42:37] was going to do, then what God actually
[42:39] did, which is exactly what he said he
[42:41] would do. Now, many people would
[42:43] interpret it one way, which is the exact
[42:46] same thing people do today. People try
[42:48] to interpret the scripture and they try
[42:50] to say that uh the scripture means this
[42:53] or it means that or I saw a vision or I
[42:56] have a prophecy or something. trying to
[42:58] make those things fulfilled and work out
[43:00] the way they were. Let God is going to
[43:02] interpret his word by bringing it to
[43:04] pass. Amen. If we just let God let let
[43:08] him have his way and let God move upon
[43:10] it and recognize that God was anything
[43:13] that we were to know, God was going to
[43:15] bring through that last seventh angel
[43:17] prophet messenger that we would have
[43:19] need of to bring us to a place of
[43:21] rapturing faith. Right? And if rapturing
[43:24] faith lies in the message in the message
[43:26] of William Brandham, if rapturing faith,
[43:29] if I want to go on a rapture and
[43:31] rapturing faith lies in that message,
[43:33] why do I bother myself with anything
[43:35] else? Right? Amen. I mean, there might
[43:38] be some truths that people have or
[43:40] something. I don't know. But all I know
[43:42] is that rapturing faith lies in the
[43:44] message. And that's where I want my
[43:46] attention and my focus to be on is in
[43:48] that message. I'm not looking to
[43:50] anything else. I'm not wanting anything
[43:53] else. I'm not trying to seek out
[43:55] anything else. All I want is what God
[43:57] told me through that prophet and what
[43:59] God reveals to each of us. What God
[44:02] reveal reveals to me today. And if God
[44:06] reveals it and if we feel like God's
[44:08] revealed it, if it doesn't match up to
[44:10] this word, if it doesn't match up to the
[44:12] scripture, I'm sorry, but God did not
[44:15] reveal that. Right. Amen. Right. That
[44:18] was something that came from the enemy.
[44:21] But God will only bring to us what is
[44:25] according to his word, what is according
[44:27] to his scripture. And we know now in
[44:30] that maturity as we moved on, this will
[44:33] be adoption part nine. This is the bride
[44:37] part one. So we've moved on from the
[44:39] maturity into the bride. Praise the
[44:42] Lord. Because she's no longer a child.
[44:45] She's the bride of Jesus Christ. She's
[44:48] his wife now. She's a grown adult. So,
[44:51] it moved on into the bride. And as a and
[44:54] as it was come to coming to its
[44:57] maturity, it was coming to its place of
[45:00] that when this church was to be born as
[45:03] it was in the type as we showed and as
[45:05] we spoke a little bit last Sunday, Jesus
[45:09] Christ came in the promise that he gave
[45:11] through the form of the Holy Ghost
[45:13] waving over the people the first fruits
[45:16] that was to that was to make that
[45:19] promise that was to come to maturity.
[45:22] Jesus Christ was the first one to meet
[45:25] the promise that the that death, hell,
[45:28] and the grave could not hold him. Death,
[45:31] hell, and the grave could not hold
[45:32] Jesus. If death, hell, and the grave
[45:34] could not hold Jesus, then what about
[45:37] those that are in Jesus Christ? If we
[45:40] are in Jesus Christ and death could not
[45:42] hold him, then it cannot hold those who
[45:45] are in him. Praise the Lord. Well, if we
[45:49] claim to be in him, if we are a part of
[45:51] that body, then we can claim the exact
[45:53] same thing because it was waved over us.
[45:57] Praise the Lord. They we had it here the
[46:00] day of Pentecost. Obviously, we we we
[46:03] weren't physically there, but as God did
[46:05] it to them, he did it to us. If they
[46:08] were in him and we are in him, it's the
[46:10] same thing. He waved it over them. He
[46:13] waved it over everyone that was to be in
[46:16] him down through the ages, down through
[46:18] the church ages, down through the
[46:20] generations and times. It was waved over
[46:23] all of them as an example. The first
[46:25] ones that was to be raised from the
[46:27] dead, the first ones that was to come to
[46:29] maturity, the first ones. That was the
[46:32] example that we are to follow. Amen. And
[46:35] as he waved over them, he showed that
[46:38] Holy Spirit came upon them. and not just
[46:41] upon them, but the Holy Spirit went into
[46:43] them and they were all filled with the
[46:46] Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord. They were
[46:49] all filled. And as they got filled with
[46:52] the Holy Spirit, God began to manifest
[46:54] those gifts in their lives as a part of
[46:58] the bride. As they as it manifested in
[47:01] their lives, it says they begin to all
[47:03] speak with new tongues. people came
[47:06] around and were confounded because there
[47:08] h how could this one speak in in in our
[47:12] tongue? We know he's not from he's not a
[47:16] part of our lineage. He's not a part of
[47:17] our our heritage or our our group. How
[47:20] could he be speaking this? We're
[47:22] listening to him speak and he's not even
[47:24] one that is from our group, from our
[47:26] home or from our uh uh language, from
[47:30] our heritage. How could he be doing
[47:32] this? Because it's the Holy Spirit.
[47:34] That's why Peter had to speak up and say
[47:37] they are not drunk as you suppose. But
[47:39] this is what Joel said that he would
[47:41] pour out his spirit upon all flesh.
[47:44] Amen. He waved over them in the form of
[47:47] the Holy Spirit. He breathed on them in
[47:50] the form of the Holy Spirit and has
[47:52] showed to them that it was Jesus Christ
[47:55] manifesting himself once again to his
[47:58] people. He does the same thing for us.
[48:00] We know as as it was. So as we
[48:04] progress through this uh uh study of the
[48:08] bride which will be a few parts here. As
[48:12] we progress through this this body this
[48:15] this study of the birth of the church
[48:18] the birth of the of the body of Jesus
[48:22] Christ of the birth of the wife of Jesus
[48:26] Christ. Uh it it it brings us to an
[48:29] understanding of of
[48:32] God working himself through the
[48:34] scripture from Genesis to
[48:37] Revelation, revealing himself to us,
[48:41] giving himself to us, showing himself to
[48:43] us, letting us be able to be a part of
[48:47] that life, us be able to be a part of
[48:50] that of that light that that that he
[48:53] brought upon us. Amen. We're a part of
[48:56] that. Praise the Lord. As God gave
[48:59] us, the Holy Spirit was fully come. Now,
[49:03] look, Brother Aram said, the the first
[49:07] corn of wheat, the bridegroom, had to
[49:11] fall into the earth in order to rise
[49:14] again. Now, let's go over to St. John.
[49:17] Let's look at the scripture on that real
[49:18] quick. I'm no hurry uh as far as being
[49:22] able to get through this. uh not
[49:25] necessarily today, but however many
[49:28] Sundays this might be. Amen. But let's
[49:32] just go over the scripture and see it.
[49:33] St. John chapter
[49:35] 12. I've had the scriptures written
[49:38] down. Some I have uh to read and maybe
[49:40] not read or just refer to. But um let's
[49:43] just read it. St. John 12. Uh we'll
[49:47] start with verse
[49:49] 23. St. John 12 verse 23. And Jesus
[49:53] answered them, saying, "The hour is come
[49:58] that the Son of Man must be glorified or
[50:01] should be glorified." I like the must,
[50:03] but it says should be glorified. The
[50:06] hour has come. Praise the Lord. Notice
[50:10] now when you when you speak of something
[50:14] to say that it has
[50:16] arrived, that means that you had an
[50:19] understanding or have been told or or or
[50:23] or given to you
[50:26] uh a promise of something. Um uh is
[50:32] anybody ever ordered on
[50:34] Amazon? I say that because probably most
[50:36] of us have. If you've ordered anything
[50:39] on Amazon, uh, it usually tells you,
[50:43] "Thank you for your order. Your order
[50:45] will be delivered on this day." Right
[50:48] then and there, it'll tell you. I don't
[50:50] care wherever this is around the
[50:53] country. That's this this if you bought
[50:55] this, this phone is going to be on your
[50:57] front doorstep on this day. I don't give
[51:00] you an exact time, but they'll tell you
[51:02] this day. So, what do you do? You expect
[51:05] it, right? you look for it. Maybe it's
[51:08] something you really wanted. So, you're
[51:10] in anticipation for it. Amen. Sometimes
[51:13] it might not be, but uh if you really
[51:16] want it, you're in anticipation for it.
[51:19] And then when it comes and you knock on
[51:21] your door, you say, "There it is. That's
[51:23] what I've been waiting on." And you go
[51:25] out to the door and you grab it. And
[51:26] before the guy even gets back
[51:27] downstairs, of course, we have stairs,
[51:30] but before he gets back downstairs, you
[51:32] grab the package because you just been
[51:33] waiting on them. But Jesus said, he
[51:36] said, "The time has come. The hour has
[51:38] come." Amen. It's been foretold. It's
[51:41] been promised. It's been given to you to
[51:44] understand that this would happen. And
[51:47] now it is happening. Praise God. Oh, I
[51:50] just love that because it just proves
[51:52] the fulfillment of God. See, you you get
[51:55] so much so many cynics and so many
[51:58] critics and so many people. Oh, where's
[52:00] the promise of his coming? or where
[52:02] you've been saying this for years and
[52:03] you've been talking about this ever
[52:05] since I've known and I've heard this so
[52:07] many times. I've heard it preached. I've
[52:09] heard it said and and people become
[52:11] scoffers. They become cynical about it,
[52:14] but they don't recognize that it's still
[52:16] the promise of God's word and it will
[52:19] happen. Right. Amen. And when God when
[52:21] Jesus is here says now the hour that
[52:24] you've learned about the hour that has
[52:27] been foretold the scripture that has
[52:30] been written that has been preached that
[52:32] has been brought to a congregation or a
[52:34] group of people now that time has come.
[52:37] Right? Praise God. Amen. Regardless of
[52:41] what the critics might have said,
[52:43] regardless of what the cynics might have
[52:45] said, doesn't matter because it's going
[52:47] to come to pass. That's right. It's
[52:49] going to happen. And it's going to
[52:50] happen, not the way you think, not the
[52:54] way you feel, but exactly the way God
[52:57] said. Amen. And that's all that matters.
[53:00] Because it's his promise that does it.
[53:02] Amen. Amen. He does it exactly in his
[53:06] way and in his time. Praise the Lord.
[53:10] Amen. And that's what we understand. We
[53:12] miss God so many times because we expect
[53:14] it to come a different way. We expect
[53:16] God to manifest in a different way. And
[53:18] so many times he was missed. Even when
[53:21] he was here, people didn't understand
[53:22] it. Of course, the Jews were blinded,
[53:24] but they crucified him. The very one
[53:27] they've been praying and looking for him
[53:29] uh for for for generations and hundreds
[53:31] and hundreds, thousands of years, and
[53:34] they put him on a cross and killed him.
[53:36] Amen. They but but they were blinded to
[53:39] it, but didn't recognize this was that.
[53:43] Amen. Jesus is saved. This was
[53:47] that. When he died and rose again and
[53:50] came back in the day of Pentecost, Peter
[53:52] said, "This is that."
[53:55] Well, brother Random said this.
[53:57] Remember, Brother Ram preached the
[53:58] message. This day, this scripture is
[54:00] fulfilled. Yes. What is it? This is
[54:03] that. Praise God. It was once foretold.
[54:08] It was once preached. It was once
[54:10] written, read through the scripture, but
[54:13] now it's here. Now the time is here. The
[54:15] hour is come that the son of man should
[54:19] be glorified.
[54:21] Praise the Lord. How is the son of man
[54:23] to be glorified when they all hated him?
[54:29] Because it's not glorification in the
[54:31] way that we look at glorification.
[54:33] Right? Amen. They gave him a crown. All
[54:36] right.
[54:37] But they shoved that crown of thorns
[54:39] into his skull to where the bleed the
[54:42] blood just poured out of his head. Oh,
[54:44] they gave him a crown. All right. Yeah.
[54:47] They they they they gave him a they gave
[54:49] him a a
[54:51] a
[54:53] throne. It was a cross that he hung
[54:56] from. Oh yeah. They they he was
[54:58] glorified. All right. Not in the way
[55:00] people see though. See, got to
[55:02] understand. Not the way that people see.
[55:06] You say, "Well, how was he glorified
[55:08] when he was hated? When people despised
[55:11] him. They didn't put him up on a
[55:13] pedestal. They didn't put a real crown
[55:16] on his head. They didn't stand there and
[55:18] worship him or bow down to him as as the
[55:21] God Almighty of heaven and earth. Amen."
[55:24] No, they hung him on a cross. They stuck
[55:27] him with a crown of thorns. They left
[55:29] him up there bruised and naked and
[55:32] shamed. Amen. But that was the best
[55:36] glorification of the son of man that
[55:38] there ever could be.
[55:41] Praise the Lord. Because he said because
[55:43] Jesus said uh uh in the scripture that
[55:48] if I be lifted up, I will draw all men
[55:52] to me. Right? Praise the Lord. The best
[55:56] glorification you can think of. But it
[55:58] was the way that God was to glorify. Not
[56:00] the way man thought about glorification,
[56:03] but the way God was to be glorified. The
[56:05] way that God had uh uh brought forth
[56:08] glorification was that he was to die a
[56:10] cruel death. Right? That he was to be
[56:13] mocked and made fun of and shamed, crown
[56:16] of thorns, and spit in his face and hung
[56:18] him on a cross. But he said, "If I be
[56:21] lifted up, I will draw all men to me."
[56:23] And that's exactly what he did. Yes.
[56:26] Praise the Lord. His glorification. The
[56:28] son of man. Now the hour has
[56:31] come. The son of man is to be glorified.
[56:35] Praise the Lord. You think, well, it
[56:37] would have been great if they had put
[56:38] him on a th a throne. They had give him
[56:42] a real crown and they had saw him. But
[56:44] friend, if that had happened, we would
[56:47] the bride the bride the the subject of
[56:51] this message, the bride would not have
[56:53] existed, right? There would have been no
[56:56] need for there would have been no way
[56:58] that we could have come into fruition.
[57:00] No way that the bride, the gentile bride
[57:03] could have come into being, right? If he
[57:05] had really been in our human eyes
[57:08] glorified the way we consider
[57:10] glorification, we would it would have
[57:12] never happened. He would have never died
[57:14] at Calvary, never shed his blood. He
[57:16] would have never been hung on a cross.
[57:19] He would have never proclaimed it is
[57:21] finished. Mhm. He would have never come
[57:23] back in the form of the Holy Spirit and
[57:25] came on them and restored the brought
[57:28] the gifts of the spirit to them at that
[57:30] time. Would none of that would have the
[57:32] birth forth of the church at that day at
[57:35] Pentecost would have never happened.
[57:38] Praise God. Had to be that had to go to
[57:43] Calvary. Had to be glorified in the way
[57:45] that it was to be drawn up to be lifted
[57:48] up to draw all men to him. It was the
[57:51] only way. Amen. Amen. Because if it had
[57:54] not been that way, there's no way that
[57:56] we would be here.
[57:58] The hour has come that the Son of Man
[58:01] should be
[58:02] glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto
[58:05] you, except a corn of wheat, except a
[58:08] corn of wheat. Amen. What's in a corn of
[58:10] wheat? Life. Amen. It's it's kind of an
[58:15] odd expression when it says the corn of
[58:17] wheat because corn and wheat are two
[58:19] different things. But what it's meaning
[58:22] is the life in the wheat, right? The the
[58:25] grain of the wheat, if they except the
[58:29] grain of the wheat, the corn of the
[58:31] wheat fall into the ground and die, it
[58:34] abideth
[58:35] alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth
[58:39] much fruit.
[58:41] It's wonderful to give a man a fish, but
[58:45] it's much more wonderful if you teach a
[58:47] man how to fish, right? Praise the Lord.
[58:50] You can give him a fish and he can eat
[58:52] for one meal. You teach him how to fish,
[58:54] he can eat for a lifetime. As long as he
[58:57] can fish, long as he's got a place to
[58:59] fish, he can eat for the rest of his
[59:00] life. Amen. Except that corn of wheat,
[59:04] one corn, fall into the ground and die.
[59:08] And as brother Bram said, rot, right? It
[59:11] has to die and rot. Except that corn of
[59:14] wheat, that grain of wheat fall into the
[59:17] ground and die and rot, it abides alone,
[59:20] right? It's just him. Praise the Lord.
[59:23] But because he did do that and he came
[59:26] back to them on the day of Pentecost and
[59:29] waved over them that sheath weight and
[59:32] the Holy Spirit breathing out to them.
[59:36] Praise the Lord. Then it wasn't just one
[59:38] corn of wheat. It was the spirit of God
[59:42] falling on and moving into everyone that
[59:45] was there that day. And it was just the
[59:48] beginning, as we said last week. That
[59:50] was just the beginning. That was just
[59:52] the 120 that was there. That was just a
[59:55] fulfillment of the promise of of what
[59:57] was to come. That was to show that what
[1:00:00] we've done here, what has happened now,
[1:00:03] for those that have come and have been
[1:00:05] born again in this place today, you can
[1:00:07] rest assure that there's going to be
[1:00:10] thousands after this day that's going to
[1:00:12] receive the same baptism, that's going
[1:00:14] to receive the same spirit, that's going
[1:00:17] to receive the same promise that they
[1:00:19] did on that day. Thank God. I'm so glad
[1:00:22] I can say I'm one of them. Yes. I'm so
[1:00:24] glad I can say I'm one of them. Praise
[1:00:27] the Lord. Because that corn of wheat had
[1:00:29] to go into the ground. Now look what
[1:00:31] brother Ram said. Let's finish this. The
[1:00:33] first corn of wheat, the bridegroom,
[1:00:36] Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ, had to fall into the earth in
[1:00:41] order to rise again. Amen. Because in
[1:00:45] that grain of wheat is
[1:00:47] life. In that grain of grain of wheat,
[1:00:51] in every seed, listen out. in every
[1:00:55] individual seat and we can look at
[1:00:58] ourselves. We are a bride but we are all
[1:01:01] individuals.
[1:01:03] Amen.
[1:01:05] As every individual in the bride
[1:01:09] continues to
[1:01:10] mature the bride itself body
[1:01:15] matures because you're a part of
[1:01:18] it. as each grain of wheat. Praise the
[1:01:22] Lord. As as that had to as that corn of
[1:01:27] wheat inside that seed, every individual
[1:01:32] seed as each individuals as you are as
[1:01:36] each individual seed within itself
[1:01:40] contains the
[1:01:42] power to become whatever life it
[1:01:46] is. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:49] And if that seed goes into the ground
[1:01:52] and it dies and it rots in the right
[1:01:55] condition, that seed will bring forth
[1:01:58] again. But it won't just bring forth a
[1:02:00] seed. It'll bring forth a
[1:02:03] plant. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad
[1:02:06] that the seed of God and each individual
[1:02:10] is in within it the power to become what
[1:02:13] the seed is? Yes. And each individual in
[1:02:17] each one of you that had the seed of God
[1:02:21] that each one around the world that is
[1:02:25] received and has the seed of God that
[1:02:29] seed in itself has the power to produce
[1:02:33] what is in the seed. Right? If it's a
[1:02:36] God seed, it produces God.
[1:02:40] Amen. Amen. in each individual, but it
[1:02:43] has to die and rot before it can come
[1:02:46] forth again. Jesus had to go to hell.
[1:02:50] Amen. Jesus himself had to go to hell.
[1:02:54] Amen. Yes. He had to die and go to
[1:02:57] hell to be able to raise again with the
[1:03:01] keys to the kingdom of heaven. Amen.
[1:03:04] with the keys to death, hell, and the
[1:03:07] grave to be able to come back again and
[1:03:10] come upon every believer. Now, every
[1:03:13] redemptive
[1:03:14] promise, everything that God had done,
[1:03:17] everything that God had said, everything
[1:03:19] that every thing that God is, we become.
[1:03:24] Yes. Amen.
[1:03:27] Not in the complete fullness. Obviously,
[1:03:30] we know as he is, but again, a scoop of
[1:03:33] the ocean contains within it the ocean.
[1:03:38] It's not the whole ocean, but it's the
[1:03:40] scoop of the ocean. Everything in the
[1:03:42] ocean's in the scoop. Amen. If you'd say
[1:03:46] chemicals and whatnot, obviously, you
[1:03:48] don't have a whale on the
[1:03:49] scoop. It's still in the ocean. But that
[1:03:53] that contains in the ocean. Praise the
[1:03:55] Lord. All that God was, he poured into
[1:03:58] Christ. All that Christ was, he poured
[1:04:01] where? Into us. Amen. Into his church,
[1:04:04] into his bride. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:07] That just shows it in us. Is that power
[1:04:10] is that authority? Because that seat,
[1:04:13] that seed was to become what it is. And
[1:04:16] what that seed is is God. Amen. that
[1:04:21] seed that corn of that corn of wheat
[1:04:23] seed had to fall into the earth in order
[1:04:26] to rise again. The only way that he
[1:04:29] could according to the scripture brother
[1:04:31] Brandham says he had to rise again. So
[1:04:35] did the first bride. Let's get into a
[1:04:39] little bit if we can. So did the first
[1:04:42] bride that was born at Pentecost. We
[1:04:45] just read the first bride that was born
[1:04:48] at Pentecost, that 120 in the upper
[1:04:50] room, added 3,000 souls that day.
[1:04:54] Amen. Brother Peter preached such a
[1:04:57] tremendous message that 3,000 souls were
[1:05:01] added to the kingdom that very day.
[1:05:03] Amen. Amen. That's a powerful sermon.
[1:05:06] Yes. Praise the Lord. But it was that
[1:05:08] time for it. Yes. Amen.
[1:05:11] I I I doubt we've got 3,000 in the past
[1:05:15] 20 years. I doubt we've gotten 3,000
[1:05:17] since Brother Brown's been gone. Maybe
[1:05:19] it has. I don't know. I don't want to be
[1:05:21] cynical about that, but it's very few.
[1:05:25] We know that. Amen. Very few. Amen. He
[1:05:29] got three. There was 3,000 there in that
[1:05:30] day, but that's the day that that was
[1:05:32] the day they lived. See? Amen. The corn
[1:05:35] and wheat had to go so it could rise
[1:05:36] again. So did the first bride. This
[1:05:40] first bride that was born at Pentecost
[1:05:41] that we just read had to go through that
[1:05:44] dark ages like other seed and be buried.
[1:05:48] They had to die. That first church age,
[1:05:51] that first church that was born there.
[1:05:54] And we notice in of course Nasia Rome
[1:05:56] and that as the the the the enemy begin
[1:05:59] to come in and and and Paul said it
[1:06:02] would. Before we finish this, you know,
[1:06:05] Paul said it would. Amen. Paul said to
[1:06:08] brother Brandham said the same thing
[1:06:10] Paul said too look Acts chapter
[1:06:13] 20. Paul said for I have not shunn to
[1:06:16] declare unto you the count the all the
[1:06:18] counsel of
[1:06:19] God. All the counsel of God have not
[1:06:22] shun to declare all the counsel of God.
[1:06:24] Take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:06:27] to all the flock over the which the Holy
[1:06:29] Ghost had made you overseers to feed the
[1:06:33] church of God which he had purchased
[1:06:35] with his own blood. Amen. For I know
[1:06:39] this, verse 29, Acts 20:29. For I know
[1:06:45] this, that after my departing, they
[1:06:48] wouldn't do it while he was here. Right.
[1:06:51] Amen. And you know what I'm talking
[1:06:53] about. I'm not talking about Paul
[1:06:55] anymore. Amen. Amen. Because Brother Bam
[1:06:58] said the exact same thing. Amen. Maybe
[1:07:01] not this exact words, but brother Bam
[1:07:03] said the same thing. when I leave the
[1:07:06] scene, you see people come in. They were
[1:07:08] doing it even before he left,
[1:07:09] impersonating and thought, but they
[1:07:11] wouldn't come out like they've come out
[1:07:12] today, right? But he said after I go,
[1:07:16] you see, they'll come out of the
[1:07:17] woodwork. Paul said the same thing.
[1:07:20] Notice they won't do it while I'm here
[1:07:22] cuz I'm here. I'll face them down. I'll
[1:07:24] I'll I'll uh uh preach them down or talk
[1:07:28] them down in scripture. They they won't
[1:07:30] be able to come against the spirit of
[1:07:31] God, right? Amen. while I'm here. But
[1:07:34] upon my departing shall grievous wolves
[1:07:38] enter in among you, not sparing the
[1:07:40] flock. So what does that mean? They're
[1:07:42] going to be hunting for the devil in
[1:07:46] them will be hunting for the bride.
[1:07:51] He will be hunting for you.
[1:07:55] Hunting for those that are born again,
[1:07:57] hunting for those that are believers,
[1:08:00] right? That's who he's going to be
[1:08:01] hunting for. Praise the Lord. And that's
[1:08:04] what he's done this whole time. He's
[1:08:06] still doing down to the church ages and
[1:08:08] started it out that way as that as that
[1:08:11] church age begin to wayne off. Amen. Or
[1:08:15] as brother Brandon has it in the church
[1:08:17] age book here, he has each of this age
[1:08:19] waning off. Amen. He has it going up.
[1:08:22] Actually, the darkness, the darkness
[1:08:25] filling in the light. I didn't get a
[1:08:26] chance to draw these out. It look a
[1:08:28] little better on the board maybe. But
[1:08:30] each of these ages as it dark as it
[1:08:32] darkened deeper and deeper, we know at
[1:08:35] the beginning in uh Nia Rome where they
[1:08:38] decided that they would denominate
[1:08:40] around uh
[1:08:42] what after after Paul was gone after
[1:08:47] when these grievous wolves come in they
[1:08:50] they didn't spare the flock. The flock
[1:08:53] is God's. The flock are the ones that
[1:08:55] belong to God. Amen. you don't belong to
[1:08:58] God. You're not flock. You're not you're
[1:09:00] not his sheep. You're not a part of his
[1:09:02] kingdom. Praise the Lord. So, if you're
[1:09:05] not a part of that, then then you don't
[1:09:07] see it. You don't recognize it. You
[1:09:09] don't understand it. But if it takes uh
[1:09:12] the Holy Spirit to come and to try to
[1:09:14] break that. Amen. Like brother Bham said
[1:09:18] here, let's continue to read. Let me
[1:09:20] finish
[1:09:22] this. Um be buried. the the dark seas
[1:09:28] like through that dark ages like other
[1:09:31] any other seed be buried they had to die
[1:09:35] they must do it but it started sprouting
[1:09:38] again in Luther the first reformation it
[1:09:42] didn't look like the seed that went in
[1:09:45] but it was the light of that day when
[1:09:48] the blade come out of the ground it
[1:09:50] didn't look like the seed that went in
[1:09:51] the ground it just looked like a blade
[1:09:54] right just a piece of grass if you will.
[1:09:56] It didn't look like it, but it was the
[1:09:59] light of that day. Justification was the
[1:10:02] light of that day. And as the stall come
[1:10:04] up and as the tossel came out, it was
[1:10:06] the light that got for that day. Like we
[1:10:08] said the other day, through Luther,
[1:10:10] through Wesley, through the restoration
[1:10:13] of the gifts, each one of those forms
[1:10:16] came up to produce the the the seed
[1:10:20] again because the the church seed was to
[1:10:25] do the same as it was when the Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ seed went into the ground. As we
[1:10:31] said, so did the first bride that was
[1:10:35] born at Pentecost.
[1:10:37] Amen. Through the dark ages, it was
[1:10:39] killed out a little bit at a
[1:10:42] time. Revelation 9 bound at the doors of
[1:10:46] creeds and dogmas, bound at the doors of
[1:10:50] denominationalism. The Holy Spirit
[1:10:53] unable to move in the church because it
[1:10:56] was bound by the devil. The devil was
[1:10:59] keeping it bound. Now there was bright
[1:11:01] in those ages even down to the very
[1:11:04] darkest age that we see here where there
[1:11:07] was barely just a little light in the
[1:11:09] Tyra. There was there was still bride
[1:11:13] right
[1:11:14] now we know through that ox age they had
[1:11:17] to labor. They had to give theirelves.
[1:11:20] They had to give their lives. And and it
[1:11:23] that that bride at that day died out.
[1:11:26] Yes. That had to fall into the ground
[1:11:29] again. had to die and
[1:11:31] rot before it could bring forth a
[1:11:33] springrig again. Praise the Lord. And
[1:11:36] before people realized what was going
[1:11:37] on, before the Catholic Church and the
[1:11:40] denomination and the the dominating of
[1:11:44] that spirit over the people started to
[1:11:47] lose its grip. People started to realize
[1:11:50] this is not
[1:11:52] right. This is not the way it's supposed
[1:11:54] to be. This is not how we're supposed to
[1:11:57] live. They wouldn't let people have
[1:11:59] Bibles. They wouldn't let them read the
[1:12:01] word for themselves. They had to just
[1:12:03] come and take whatever word they said.
[1:12:05] And if they did anything contrary, they
[1:12:08] were killed. But there were people
[1:12:10] during that period of time that were
[1:12:12] willing to do it regardless if it got
[1:12:15] cost them their lives. Right? They were
[1:12:17] willing to do it anyway. Whether it was
[1:12:19] whether it cost their famil family's
[1:12:21] lives, whether it cost their children's
[1:12:23] lives, they were willing to do it
[1:12:26] anyway because it had to be born back
[1:12:29] again. Now look, friend, all those
[1:12:32] people, they'll be there. Amen. By the
[1:12:35] grace of God, they will be there because
[1:12:37] they're as much bright as any of us are.
[1:12:40] They played their part as much as any of
[1:12:42] us do. And they are much bright as we
[1:12:44] are will be there on that day because
[1:12:46] they are as much a part of carrying that
[1:12:49] life as the life coming out in the seed
[1:12:51] itself. Look, when the blade come up,
[1:12:54] the blade had life in it. That's the
[1:12:57] whole thing we're talking about is life.
[1:12:58] It's the life of God. When the toss when
[1:13:01] the when the stalk come from out of the
[1:13:03] blade, it had life in it. When when the
[1:13:06] when the tossel came out, it had life in
[1:13:09] it.
[1:13:10] Every one of them were carriers of life.
[1:13:13] And God is the giver of life. Yes. Every
[1:13:16] form of that restoration of that bride
[1:13:19] tree was to bring forth life. And as the
[1:13:22] life came forth, it produced and brought
[1:13:25] forth the actual seed again that within
[1:13:29] it. Now look, the blade didn't have life
[1:13:32] in itself to reproduce. The blade, the
[1:13:35] the the stalk didn't have life in itself
[1:13:37] to reproduce. The sh did not have life
[1:13:39] in itself to reproduce. But the seed,
[1:13:43] amen, which the which the life came
[1:13:45] through to has life to reproduce.
[1:13:50] Amen. That's why that's why brother
[1:13:52] Brandon was so hard against hybridism
[1:13:54] and the hybriding of the word because as
[1:13:57] soon as something gets hybrided and some
[1:14:00] other man-made something gets
[1:14:01] interjected in there, then it's dead. It
[1:14:04] cannot reproduce. Amen. Brother Bam, I
[1:14:07] think, talks about a mule. He says a
[1:14:09] mule is a good hard worker, but he
[1:14:11] didn't know his man or his papy. He
[1:14:13] doesn't know where he come from. He
[1:14:14] didn't know where he belongs to. He
[1:14:16] doesn't know what his uh life is about.
[1:14:18] He's just a grunt and just works hard
[1:14:21] and just he just he's a hard worker, but
[1:14:23] he doesn't know where he's from. He has
[1:14:25] no identification. He said, "You get a
[1:14:28] good thoroughbred horse." He knows mom
[1:14:30] and daddy. He knows what his land is. He
[1:14:33] knows what his heritage is. He knows
[1:14:35] what his purpose is and he's a thoroughb
[1:14:37] bread. Yes. Praise God. Something that's
[1:14:41] hybrid has no life to it. Praise the
[1:14:44] Lord. You can take that. You can take
[1:14:46] that uh uh that that genuine
[1:14:48] thoroughbred and you can study him out
[1:14:49] and he'll have children. He'll have
[1:14:51] foss. He'll have more horses out there.
[1:14:54] That's a replication of who he is.
[1:14:57] That's why so many times when a
[1:14:59] championship racehorse uh is put to
[1:15:02] pasture, he's stuted out for a lot of
[1:15:05] money. People will pay millions of
[1:15:07] dollars for like a a Kentucky Derby
[1:15:11] winning horse to be studded. They'll pay
[1:15:13] millions of dollars to get that horse
[1:15:15] studded to one of their mayors or
[1:15:17] something because in it lies the genes
[1:15:20] for a possible another Kentucky Derby
[1:15:22] winner. Amen.
[1:15:26] I hope you understand the spiritual
[1:15:27] application of that because it's the
[1:15:30] seed. It's the seed life because in it
[1:15:35] is the potential. Look, God does not put
[1:15:38] his seed in us. If there was no
[1:15:41] potential for a reproduction of who he
[1:15:44] is, right?
[1:15:46] Praise God. He put his life in us. He
[1:15:50] put his seed in us because he knows that
[1:15:52] in you is the potential. is the reality
[1:15:56] of becoming another himymn of
[1:15:59] reproducing him. Now you might obviously
[1:16:02] not god but we are as brother Bham said
[1:16:07] the little G's. Yes. Amen. Amen. We're
[1:16:11] not the almighty God, but we're
[1:16:13] replications of him. Yes. By the seed
[1:16:16] that lives in us. Yes. That seed fell
[1:16:19] into the ground for that purpose. It
[1:16:21] died and rotted for that purpose just as
[1:16:24] it did on the day of Pentecost or uh
[1:16:26] down to the church days, excuse me, as
[1:16:28] it had to do. It had to fall in the
[1:16:30] ground and rot to rise back up again so
[1:16:32] that it could come to the place that
[1:16:34] it's at today. Amen. Now, in the gentile
[1:16:40] bride, God has made her a many membered
[1:16:43] body. Yes. Praise the Lord. No more at
[1:16:46] the door. No more at the door of creeds
[1:16:48] and dogmas. remember those 200,000.
[1:16:51] Let's let's see. I think
[1:16:53] u
[1:16:55] Amen. And of course, as we've said
[1:16:58] before, finishing up that quote, it had
[1:17:00] to be the light of their
[1:17:02] day. The the light of the day of Sardis
[1:17:06] had to be the light that would help the
[1:17:09] blade, not the shuff or the
[1:17:11] wheat. Amen. If you put the if you put
[1:17:15] the light of the wheat on the blade, it
[1:17:17] would kill it. withered it. Amen. So, it
[1:17:21] had to be the light for their day. But
[1:17:22] that light produced seed again. It
[1:17:25] produced the uh it produced
[1:17:28] bride. Amen. Look, let's see if this
[1:17:32] is said in the feast of the trumpets.
[1:17:35] While this group down here has got 2,000
[1:17:39] bound at the river
[1:17:41] Euphrates has been bound for 2,000
[1:17:43] years. Notice uh brother Brandham I I
[1:17:46] don't know how people call him
[1:17:48] infallible because it's not 2,000
[1:17:50] 200,000 thousand. Amen. At the review of
[1:17:53] phrase have been bound for 2,000 years.
[1:17:56] Also that church has bound the Holy
[1:17:59] Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under
[1:18:02] martrman back there and under the church
[1:18:04] ages through the church ages. Notice in
[1:18:08] each of that church age belonged to the
[1:18:11] church. But out of that church there was
[1:18:15] bride. Right. Amen. There was bride that
[1:18:18] came forth out of each of those church
[1:18:20] ages. Yes. There was members bride that
[1:18:22] God had uh that had brought out of that
[1:18:25] church. The bride coming out of the
[1:18:27] church for each of those ages. That's
[1:18:29] that light. That's that the light of
[1:18:32] those ages is the light of God in those
[1:18:34] people. is the Holy Ghost in them. Amen.
[1:18:38] Amen. It had to be the same light. The
[1:18:41] same light that shine is shining for us
[1:18:44] today. Yes.
[1:18:47] There was bound for 2,000 years under
[1:18:49] Mormon back there under the church ages.
[1:18:52] It's been bound not at the river
[1:18:53] Euphrates, but that the doors of at the
[1:18:56] door of creeds and dogmas that the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit can't work in the church because
[1:19:01] of man-made systems.
[1:19:04] Amen. It's the same way today. They say
[1:19:08] they've got something they don't have.
[1:19:10] They claim to produce something they
[1:19:12] cannot produce. Amen. A mule can say,
[1:19:16] "I' I've got offspring all the all day
[1:19:19] long." But he can't. A mule can't have
[1:19:22] offspring cuz he's hybrid. He cannot
[1:19:25] reproduce. Right. Amen. If he does
[1:19:28] reproduce anything, it'll just be
[1:19:30] another
[1:19:31] denomination. That's not life. There's
[1:19:34] no life
[1:19:36] there. Praise the Lord. Amen. Because
[1:19:39] the church and man-made systems, but she
[1:19:41] is going to be liberated. She is coming
[1:19:43] back. That's what the Bible said. These
[1:19:47] two meet once again on the
[1:19:49] battlegrounds. Lucifer, Michael again,
[1:19:52] like it was in the beginning, been bound
[1:19:54] for 2,000 years. No, that
[1:19:57] same same promise, the same life coming
[1:20:01] forth, producing the same thing that it
[1:20:04] did at that day. Look now, I'll probably
[1:20:07] finish with this,
[1:20:09] but let me read this. It is the rising
[1:20:12] of the sun.
[1:20:14] Rising of the sun. Praise the Lord. That
[1:20:17] quickening power. Notice
[1:20:20] now then, not only that, he sent word to
[1:20:24] his disciples, his believing, "Fear not,
[1:20:26] for I am here, for I am he that was dead
[1:20:30] and is alive again forever more." Amen.
[1:20:32] And I have the keys to death and hell.
[1:20:34] I've already conquered it. Don't fear
[1:20:37] anymore. For every, listen now, every
[1:20:41] forord orained, predestinated seed of
[1:20:44] God shall come to life when the light
[1:20:49] spreads across the earth. Amen. Praise
[1:20:51] the Lord. Every
[1:20:54] predestinated, forained seed of God will
[1:20:58] come to life. Amen. Praise the Lord. As
[1:21:02] the spirit of God goes across the earth,
[1:21:04] as the spirit of God moves on the
[1:21:05] people, as the spirit of God has its
[1:21:08] preeminence, that that uh that life will
[1:21:11] come back again. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:14] As the light spreads across the earth,
[1:21:17] every four ordained, predestinated seed
[1:21:20] of God, I just love that. In every age,
[1:21:23] it'll bring forth the crop that God
[1:21:25] ordained it to do. He had raised from
[1:21:28] the dead. Oh, what a wonderful thing
[1:21:31] that is. I am alive or quickened. The
[1:21:35] word means the word quickened, the Greek
[1:21:38] word means that something that's made
[1:21:41] alive after
[1:21:43] death. Praise the Lord. How did that
[1:21:46] word, how could that word have come into
[1:21:49] existence had it not been for Christ?
[1:21:52] Right? The first fruits died, rose
[1:21:56] again. Praise the Lord. That's the life,
[1:21:59] the quickening power. Quickening, life
[1:22:02] after death. There was death. Yes.
[1:22:05] People saw him die. He hung on a cross.
[1:22:08] They took him and they wrapped him up
[1:22:10] and they put him in a suppler. They put
[1:22:12] him in a tomb. They thought he was dead,
[1:22:14] gone, finished, forgotten. But on the
[1:22:17] third day, he come out of that tomb to
[1:22:20] show that there was life. Amen. Life
[1:22:23] after death. Quickening power. Something
[1:22:27] brought quickening alive. Praise the
[1:22:30] Lord because that's what it's all about.
[1:22:32] I am alive or quickened. The word means
[1:22:34] quicken. The seed that goes into the
[1:22:37] earth, it has to die. Every bit, every
[1:22:40] bit of the scene, look now, he's
[1:22:43] likening to us. So, we got to understand
[1:22:47] the life that we lived past. Amen. Had
[1:22:51] to die. It had to rot. Amen. So many
[1:22:54] times people try to bring in especially
[1:22:56] if they were in a church or denomination
[1:22:59] or something like that and try to bring
[1:23:01] in the thoughts, try to bring in the
[1:23:03] opinions, the the the the the scriptural
[1:23:07] understandings that other people out
[1:23:08] here that claim to be this that and the
[1:23:10] other or denominations or charismatics
[1:23:12] or whatever they are. Try to bring that
[1:23:14] and try to incorporate it into this
[1:23:16] message into this truth. Doesn't work.
[1:23:18] It doesn't work. You hybrid it. You
[1:23:21] hybrid it is death. There's no
[1:23:22] quickening power in death, right?
[1:23:25] Quickening power raises from the dead,
[1:23:27] right? But if there's nothing to raise
[1:23:29] it, it can't raise.
[1:23:32] If there's no life there, it can't
[1:23:34] raise. And in hybridism, there is no
[1:23:36] quick. There's no life. There's no life
[1:23:39] to quicken. Praise the Lord. That seed
[1:23:43] goes to earth. Every bit of it has to
[1:23:46] die. Every bit of that seed, every bit
[1:23:48] of me had to die. Every bit of you had
[1:23:51] to die and rot. We were married. Brother
[1:23:55] mans called us in uh
[1:23:58] uh was it I believe invisible union. He
[1:24:02] called it we were married to Satan.
[1:24:05] Married that it had but that union had
[1:24:08] to die and rot, right? Had to be thrown
[1:24:11] into the sea of forgetfulness. Every bit
[1:24:14] of it had to go away. You couldn't say,
[1:24:16] "Well, I'm going to be a born again
[1:24:19] Christian and still do this, this, this,
[1:24:20] and live in the world and whatever."
[1:24:22] That does, it doesn't work. Every bit of
[1:24:25] it has to die. Has to die. Every bit of
[1:24:27] that seed has to die. Has to rot. Every
[1:24:31] bit of it. Every bit of the life that
[1:24:34] was in the seed has to come forth again.
[1:24:38] The quickening power that quickens us,
[1:24:42] that quickened us from death.
[1:24:45] We died to self and rose a new in Jesus
[1:24:50] Christ. We had to rise again. The
[1:24:53] quickening power that made the dead live
[1:24:56] again. Not physically, but spiritually.
[1:25:00] I didn't die physically. Praise the
[1:25:02] Lord. But my nature, all that had to all
[1:25:05] be burned out. The Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:25:07] The Holy Ghost and fire come and burned
[1:25:10] out all that snake nature. Amen. So that
[1:25:12] the Holy Spirit could take prereeminence
[1:25:14] in my life and my soul that the Holy
[1:25:17] Spirit would be the permanent prominent
[1:25:19] resident of my soul. People ask me are
[1:25:22] you a Christian? I said I'm a
[1:25:23] bloodbought born again bibleelving
[1:25:25] Christian. Amen.
[1:25:27] That's covers it. Amen. Yes. Blood
[1:25:31] bought born again filled with the Holy
[1:25:32] Ghost Bible believing
[1:25:34] Christian. That's who I am. Amen.
[1:25:38] Every bit of the life that was in the
[1:25:40] seed, every bit of the life in the seed
[1:25:43] has to come forth again. Remember, if
[1:25:46] that seed in you was the seed of God,
[1:25:49] every bit of that life of that
[1:25:51] seed,
[1:25:53] God has to come forth again.
[1:25:57] Praise the Lord. That's why we can
[1:26:00] believe and understand that that seed
[1:26:02] wasn't just planted yesterday. That seed
[1:26:05] wasn't just planted when you first saw
[1:26:07] some light in the scripture. That seed
[1:26:09] wasn't planted when you gave your heart
[1:26:11] to God or came to an altar. That seed
[1:26:14] was always there because before the
[1:26:17] foundation of the world, you were always
[1:26:19] a son or daughter of God. You were never
[1:26:22] not a son or daughter of God. Just like
[1:26:24] the prodical son. Amen. His dad received
[1:26:27] him back because it was his son. Not
[1:26:30] because of what he had done. Not because
[1:26:32] of his righteous living. Not because of
[1:26:34] spending all of his money, not because
[1:26:36] he was uh come back a deplorable,
[1:26:39] depleted person. That's the best kind
[1:26:41] you can
[1:26:42] get. Amen. That's the best way to come.
[1:26:46] Come with nothing. Amen. That's the best
[1:26:48] way to come to God. Just come with
[1:26:50] nothing. Father, I'm sorry. I am
[1:26:53] absolutely nothing. I have wasted
[1:26:55] everything that you gave me. I have run
[1:26:58] my life into the ground and I am dead. I
[1:27:01] am lost. I am nothing.
[1:27:05] God looks and says, "Well,
[1:27:07] finally been waiting." Amen.
[1:27:11] That that song, he's been there all the
[1:27:14] time, waiting patiently in line. He's
[1:27:17] the same God. Amen. Finally, I'm sure
[1:27:21] his dad, the prodical son, he came to
[1:27:23] him and said, he just grabbed him and
[1:27:24] hugged him and said, "Finally, my son is
[1:27:26] home." Amen. I had to get to that place.
[1:27:30] die, rot. Praise the Lord. That's when
[1:27:34] life can come forth again. See, a lot of
[1:27:37] people don't want to die. That's their
[1:27:38] problem. They don't want to die. They
[1:27:40] don't want to rot. They want to hold on
[1:27:43] to ideas and opinions. They want to hold
[1:27:45] on to beliefs and and worldly things.
[1:27:47] They want to hold on to this stuff. They
[1:27:50] want to keep on to it and say, you know,
[1:27:52] I I I want to be a Christian, but I want
[1:27:54] to keep doing this. I want to have this.
[1:27:56] I want to keep thinking this way. You
[1:27:58] can't do that. You've got to die. People
[1:28:01] don't want to die. They don't want to
[1:28:03] rot to all those things. They don't want
[1:28:05] to rot to themselves and say, "Lord, I
[1:28:07] am nothing. I am here at your mercy."
[1:28:10] Yes. Whatever you see fit, Lord, if you
[1:28:12] strike me dead right here, I'll deserve
[1:28:14] it. If you send me to hell, Lord, at
[1:28:17] this moment, I'll deserve it. Amen. But
[1:28:19] I am at your mercy. God said, "Finally."
[1:28:22] Amen. Now, now a vessel I can work with.
[1:28:26] Yes. Now a vessel I can work in. Yes.
[1:28:28] Amen. Mold and shape the way I want him
[1:28:31] to be. Take him and and and put him into
[1:28:34] my image. That's what that's what God
[1:28:36] wants. Yes. Praise the Lord. As that
[1:28:39] seed comes forth to be in that very
[1:28:43] image, he was
[1:28:46] quickened. Not only that, and will send
[1:28:49] the same life that quickened me and
[1:28:52] power that brought me from the grave. I
[1:28:55] will send it upon you to quicken you so
[1:28:59] that where I am, you will be there also.
[1:29:02] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you. Life
[1:29:05] from
[1:29:07] death. God brought life from death. He
[1:29:09] just said in in Romans chapter 8, Amen.
[1:29:14] that if that same life lives in you, if
[1:29:18] that same power lives in you, if that
[1:29:20] same spirit lives in you that quickened
[1:29:23] Jesus Christ and rose him from the dead,
[1:29:26] if that same power, if that same life
[1:29:28] lives in you, it'll do the same thing to
[1:29:30] you. Yes, it'll quicken your mortal
[1:29:33] body. Death from death life. It'll
[1:29:37] quicken your mortal body. Amen. That was
[1:29:41] once dead. Now you're alive again
[1:29:43] forever more. Amen. That same life you
[1:29:47] hath he quickened. Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:29:52] Amen. You hath he quickened who were
[1:29:54] dead. Who were dead in trespasses and
[1:29:58] sins. He's quickened you. Life from
[1:30:02] death wherein in time past you walk
[1:30:04] according to the course of the world,
[1:30:06] according to the prince of the power of
[1:30:07] the air, the spirit that now workketh in
[1:30:09] the children of disobedience. Yes. But
[1:30:12] he's quickened us and made us alive.
[1:30:15] Yes. It is the rising of the sun, that
[1:30:19] quickening power that God raised up
[1:30:22] again and made it a new. That same God
[1:30:25] is still doing the same thing
[1:30:27] today. Praise the Lord. Amen. God is
[1:30:30] making himself known in every age and in
[1:30:33] our lives. Yes. Because it's God working
[1:30:36] in us. It's God working through us. Yes.
[1:30:40] making that spirit live once again. But
[1:30:43] we have to die to ourselves. Now, as
[1:30:45] Jesus Christ was the first fruits and
[1:30:48] went in the ground and rose again and
[1:30:50] waved over the people, that bride that
[1:30:54] day had to go into the ground and die in
[1:30:58] rot and raise up again a new life. So,
[1:31:02] it wasn't just singular. It was
[1:31:04] multiple. The bride wasn't just for it
[1:31:08] wasn't just for Jew. It then transferred
[1:31:11] like Abraham uh like uh like Christ at
[1:31:15] the cross. Amen. Where the blessing went
[1:31:19] to the younger child. It had to be God
[1:31:22] raising up Jacob, not Abraham, excuse
[1:31:24] me, cross his hands to give the blessing
[1:31:26] to the younger child. Right? Through the
[1:31:28] cross, the blessing transferred over.
[1:31:31] The Jews crucified him. The Gentiles
[1:31:33] received him. Amen. and she receives him
[1:31:36] today. Yes. Now we have a gentile bride
[1:31:38] that was dead but is now alive. Yes.
[1:31:41] Come from death to life. The quickening
[1:31:44] power of God. That same life that's in
[1:31:46] you to raise you from the dead to make
[1:31:49] you that living as Jesus did the first
[1:31:52] fruits. Now through many have received
[1:31:55] that same
[1:31:57] power. Amen. We know her. We talk about
[1:32:00] her as the bride. Yes. The bride of
[1:32:02] Jesus Christ. God molding her into his
[1:32:04] own image. God shaping her and making
[1:32:07] her like himself. What is he? The word.
[1:32:10] What is he making her? The word. What
[1:32:12] has she become? So that she is one with
[1:32:14] him. The word. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:18] It's Christ and his bride making himself
[1:32:21] known. Yes. Making himself real to us.
[1:32:25] The waving was just anam. It was just
[1:32:27] the beginning. It was just the start of
[1:32:30] who we are in him. Amen.
[1:32:35] Amen. Let's stand if we could.

[1:33:07] that that was dead. Amen. The
[1:33:11] ability in us to die to self to die to
[1:33:15] rot so that God could raise us up a new
[1:33:19] with his quickening power. Make us new
[1:33:21] in him. We've experienced it. We know
[1:33:24] it's real. We know it's true. We've
[1:33:26] experienced it. We believe
[1:33:29] it. Praise the Lord. Becomes who we are.
