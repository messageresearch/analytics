amen if you're curious if you've been looking and you're not sure yes I do have a black eye so don't fixate on my eye uh let's just enjoy the service I know sometimes people look the same does he is that is what and just yes so just put that aside as using something well I was pulling on something with uh with a pair of pliers that slipped off and bit me right in the eye so but right here so that's a that's the third time I've been doing labored work where something's Hit me hard in the face and my glasses haven't been touched third time that time with brother Roger he hit me right and right here didn't even touch the glasses I fell one time putting the welder up on the trailer and the deck was icy and I slipped and busted my face right here uh didn't touch my glasses and this time it hit me right there this is the first one to give me a black eye though but my glasses are untouched so thank the Lord and then I guess that's a prayer report too but amen the Lord uh blessed and I'm so thankful I I had I had a rough time getting to the job this past week um we ended up on actually he ended up leaving early because we were early I tried to condense this just for a minute but because we were early uh because we were early when we got close to Denver they had planes stacked up because the weather so they put us out over the Rocky Mountains and we were surfing around and around I'm like what are we doing we're just going around the right beautiful sight over the Rocky Mountains real pretty but I'm thinking what are we doing and we go round and back and we start heading to Denver and I think okay well we just kind of got held in a holding pattern and we're going to Denver now and he turned back around and like oh my goodness they kept us on holding patterns and we ended up going up to Grand Junction and landed in Grand Junction thought we were just going to get some gas because we were just going to do a gas and go get some gas because the holding pattern had been so long around was running out of gas to go over to Denver which is about a 30 minute flight uh so we landed there got the gas truck finally out there and the mechanics could not put the gas in in the plane it had the mechanism that wouldn't fit so they had to try to find the mechanic the the United mechanic to come out there and they couldn't find the guy Labor Day weekend I'm sitting there thinking the man's on the lake fishing somewhere there's no way this guy's gonna ever come I thought it was going to end up in Grand Junction all night spent four hours in Grand Junction finally the guy came finally got some gas finally weather cleared finally got to Denver uh needless to say I ended up getting to Salt Lake about midnight I was supposed to get there at seven o'clock or something I got to the room at one but it was quite the ordeal and of course I wasn't they there was two more flights leaving the next flight I couldn't make the next flight we ended up being so late uh that I wasn't going to make it but that Flint that plane got delayed too because of the weather so my my uh arrival gate was only six Gates away so I walked by that gate and I told the lady I said can I get on this plane and she looked she said yeah we got room so she put me on that plane to Salt Lake instead of the next morning so I finally did get to Salt Lake but my bags didn't make it so I had to work all day Monday in my travel clothes which was not a big deal they were probably more comfortable than my regular clothes it just got my my clothes dirty but anyway it worked out okay but the Lord uh had a reason for everything and whatever it was you know Saints the Lord can have a circle around over the Rocky Mountains and you're wondering what the world's going on uh but sometimes only eternity is going to Bear out wise things happen sometimes the way they do you may never know uh Sonia says that's terrible I said I know I want to get get some good rest uh none of that really happened but there's a reason so whatever it is I'm just thankful the Lord blessed made it had a good week the Lord brought back safe yesterday so I'm thankful that uh he blessed us so thank the Lord for that so let's stand to our feet if we could just take these out and then I hear I almost ended up in the airport at the same time that sister Sheila because I was supposed to leave out Monday morning they had scheduled me but because of this other flight they didn't schedule me on that flight because it was supposed to leave at 8 55 and when they rescheduled you they don't take into account that that flight's delayed too but I keep track of it watch it and it showed that flight was delayed so I thought well it kept getting delayed and delayed and I thought well I'm just

13 just want to read two verse of scripture let you be seated 21 and 22. acts 13 21 and afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will praise the Lord right to be seated if you like amen so I I just titled this today the will of God the will of God uh not necessarily uh the will of God in as a whole but what the will of God is for each of Our Lives amen what the will of God means to us and what that does to the generality or or as a whole for the bride internationally around the world and Through Time amen everyone has always had their part to play every Christian every born-again believer has always had their part to play in the position that God puts us in and the ability to be able to fulfill that that purpose uh unless we rebel against it and don't do it uh that sometimes becomes a little annoyance a little caveat but uh but God has a will God has a perfect will in his mind this this uh scene has already been played out and God has this in his mind and what his will is and what is important to God what matters the most to the Lord look God says here God speaking I believe through Paul here he's telling him that God's speaking to the high court if I believe I remember right in the synagogue there and he's telling them about down through the time and what God did for the children of Israel for them and he's speaking of when God put Saul in charge and then when he removed Saul and then he's talking about when he raised David up and it says he said that God found David the son of Jesse who was a man after his own heart after God's Own Heart a man after God's Own Heart why was David considered a man after God's Own Heart why was it look let's go over to Santa let's go over to second Samuel we'll come back to that part because that's one of the biggest main things I want to strike on today why was David a man after God's Own Heart look second Samuel let's read beginning of the 12 let's look at the 12th chapter beginning with the first verse second second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1. let's read this keep in mind now this is a man after God's Own Heart amen David a man after God's Own Heart and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged rhaba but David tarried still at Jerusalem and it came to pass an evening tithe that David arose off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself the woman was very beautiful to look upon David sent and inquired after the woman and once said is not this Bathsheba the daughter of elium the wife of Uriah the hittite and David sent Messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he laid with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house and the woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am with child and David sent to joab saying Send Me Uriah the hittite and joab sent Uriah to David now look setting the scene here we're setting the scene of a man after God's Own Heart this man after God's Own Heart walks out on the roof of his house and looks across to the other roof and sees a beautiful woman and desires her so much that he calls on his men his soldiers to go get her and bring her to him when she comes and they meet he lays with her another man's wife he lays with her and impregnates her remember this is a man after God's Own Heart praise the Lord but remember he's not a man after God's Own Heart because of the perfect Deeds of his life he's a man after God's Own Heart because he was a man that was going to fulfill all God's will yeah yeah praise the Lord that's why he was a man after God's Own Heart not causes mistakes not cause of his Humanity or carnality not because even a lustful Spirit but because he was a man that was going to fulfill all God's will praise the Lord lays with this woman now he's conniving a plan to hide it amen who is he hiding it from David knows well enough Saints Mobility God David knows well enough let me take this off he knows well enough that God knows that there's no way he can hide anything from God he knows god well enough but he tries to hide it who is he hiding it from he's hiding it from the kingdom he's hiding it from all the people he's hiding it from the ones who are his subjects that are under him as king that's who he's trying to hide everything from now look he said um and when and when you're right seventh verse now let's pick this back up he sends joette to go get Uriah bathsheba's husband and when your eye was coming to him David demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered just making small talk for to try to make his life more believable and David said to Uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and you ride the parted out of the King's house and there followed him uh a mess of meat from the King but Uriah slept at the door of the King's house with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house he actually disobeyed the king's order because David told him go down to your house and to get some rest do your uh do your thing be be the husband to your wife uh but your eyes slept at the king's door at the uh uh David's at the at the door of the House of the Kingdom and when they had told David saying Uriah went not down into his house David said unto Uriah came us down not from my journey why then did else not go down into thy house Uriah said to them now look at the Integrity of this man now I want you to know something God said he used Paul to say it he said another place too that David was a man after God's Own Heart but I'm reading you a story about a man who in this instant at least has more Integrity than David more Integrity than the man that's after God's Own Heart so much so that the prophet of this day brother Brandon said I can't wait to get there to shake your eyes hand amen this this Uriah was such a man of character now look uriah's 11th verse Uriah said unto David The Ark in Israel and Judah abide in tents and my Lord joab and the Servants of my Lord are encamped in the Open Fields shall I then go into my house to eat and drink and Delight with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul livest I will not do this thing this man had so much integrity that all he could think of was the men that he fought with that the captain that he fought under the the the the uh the ark of the covenant all he could think of was everything it's all out in the open they're sleeping under the stars they're resting in tents how can I go to my house and enjoy eat and drink and my wife when they're out there slaving and laboring and risking their lives what a man of integrity says this man you're right no wonder you know what brother random said I can't wait to shake his hand I want to be second in line this is this is quite a man here amen Uriah was a man a man of God and although but yeah God uh uh David was the man after God's Own Heart now look because this is the story think this is the truth think about the will of God now our topic here amen and David said to your Aunt Terry here today also and tomorrow I will let thee depart so Uriah Abode in Jerusalem that day and tomorrow and when David had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk now he's trying to make him drunk to go lay with his wife because he wants to he wants to make it look like his that uriah's wife was impregnated by her husband instead of David he's trying to hide the fact that he's the baby's father David called him to eat and drink and he tried to make him drunk now he tried to tell him go down and and go home and enjoy your wife and eat and drink and rest he didn't do that now he's trying to get him drunk and even he went out to lie on his bed with the Servants of his Lord but he went not down to his house and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to joab sent it by the hand of Uriah look at this now I mean I'm I'm sorry friend I know David's the man after God's Own heart and I know why in closer scripture says one but this is wicked this is an evil evil plot on David's part from the very beginning to take this man's wife to himself to impregnate her to try to hide it by conniving a way to get Uriah to go down to her to try to get him drunk now now he's sending a message to joab through Uriah yeah now look what the message says and he wrote in the letter saying set ye and riot in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die that's the message that Uriah is taking to joab joab put the man with the message in the hottest battle so that he dies now he's trying to kill the man to cover it up because if he can kill Uriah he can go take Bathsheba and make it look okay make it look like there was never an indiscretion there I mean this this is again this is a very Wicked plan yes this is just evil amen praise the Lord and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he that he is uh assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that ballot men were and the men in the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the Servants of David and Uriah the hittite died also David got his wish he finally got rid of Uriah he finally found a way he finally was able to accomplish a way that he could hide his indiscretion with Bathsheba that he could that he could try to secretly put away so now he can take Bathsheba to himself to be his wife and make it look like that he impregnated her after uriah's death and after he had taken her to his wife I mean what an evil plan but again this is a man after God's Own Heart but he's not a man after God's Own Heart because he was a perfect person right right he was a man after God's Own Heart because he was doing he was a man that would fulfill all the will of God now God also said he sent Samuel over to Saul of The Tribe of Benjamin to pick Saul out to be a king fact God didn't want him to have a kid that they're the ones that looked at other nations and said they wanted a king all these other nations around them had Kings and and potentates and and leaders over top of them to to Lord over them now there's nothing wrong with that because the benevolent King is the best form of government there is Brother Band said that yeah do you believe you look in the scripture and say that a benevolent dictator is the best kind of uh I guess that this gets in the wrong hands since we're such capitalists and all but uh and not that I'm against capitalism I uh I'm in favor of that but a benevolent dictatorship is the best form of government there is amen the problem is when a person in their Humanity gets to become dictator they don't be they're not benevolent for very long It all becomes serpent seeds selfish me first me only and the people get pressed down with everything so the benevolent part is the part that doesn't normally work out very well but God picked God hand-picked and sent Samuel to go anoint Saul to be king over the children of Israel and he did that and Saul was a great king saw one battle after battle after battle he was a good man he led the people but Saul started to get prideful and an evil spirit came on him David came into camp and an evil spirit came on salt he would have David come and play his harp and try to draw those evil spirits away just like we're working to preach and to play music to drive this evil spirit away but it would be to drive those evil spirits away uh and and David did it on many occasions but the people begin to like David so much that that that evil spirit that was on Saul started making him jealous the point he wanted to kill David well then then Saul by this evil spirit started to negate the will of God when he was King when he first was King Saul was a good King he did the will of God God hand-picked him and he started out right and he was doing good but when this evil spirit came on Saul he started he started doing less and less God's Will and more and more of his own will don't worry they got to uh the king agag and and God gave him Specific Instructions of what to do now of course God had already told uh Sally was going to get rid of him and not be king anymore and Saul begged and Samuel went to the Lord and and God said okay I'll give him another chance he says go down here and uh go to the king a gang and and utterly destroy everything that's Fallen refuse and and the animals and everything and and David and Saul only wanted to do what he wanted to do he was not willing to do and complete the will of God and he was so blinded to the fact that he was so arrogant and so selfish and had left also performing God's will that when Samuel came to him and said why have you not performed the will of God Samuel's Saul said I did I have done exactly what God Said dude that's how blinded he was that's how blinding that evil spirit can be yeah to not recognize that he did not do what God told him to do right yeah now he did part of what God told him to do but now look at the scripture again David wasn't a man after God's Own Heart because he did some of what God Said but he was a man after God's Own Heart because he shall fulfill all my will not part of it not some of it not most of it but he was the man after God's Own Heart because he shall fulfill all my will yes praise the Lord that's what it was all my will that's what God was looking for Saul got to the place that he was unwilling to do all of God's will and David and David was willing to do it with all of his faults with all of his mistakes and God then came to David and said and sent to Nathan and said and told David a story there was a rich man and a poor man and the rich man had everything the poor man had only one little you lamb but the rich man stole the one little you land from the one guy and and Nathan said what should happen to that rich man and David got so mad that he said that man should die and Nathan looked at him and said well you're that man you're that man David you're the one who took uriah's only prize only possession only belonging I guess you'd say is the thing that was his wife you you stole the man's wife he said I've given you everything Nathan told David David I took you from the Sheepfold and I made you King over my people I put you in this great palace I'll give you anything that you would want I've taken the wives and concubines that were before and gave everyone and brought every one of them into your bosom you had you had there was nothing of a limit to you David and anything that you needed beyond that I would have give it to you if you just you stole this man's wife you had him murdered and then you tried to cover it up before all the people now evil is going to come to your house and he will did come to David's house the sword he said the sword shall never because you used the sword to kill Uriah the sword will never depart out of your house and it did not amen evil shall rise in your family evil shall rise in your home and it did even so to the point that David was ousted by his own son from being King and he did David David reigned because uh Absalom uh kicked him out was able to gain favor with the people and ran David off and then his own son Absalom was was killed in battle and poor David was there and not only that but God told him and the baby that Bathsheba is carrying will die of also every bit of it happened exactly the way God said but yet David undeterred continued to do what God was telling him and what God's will was for him to do and Saints that's what that that's the thing that the Lord is calling for us to do amen yes we are to live Godly holy consecrated lives before the Lord I'm not saying anything to make excuse for that not at all especially now David didn't have the Holy Ghost amen we have a dwelling presence we've been speaking on for 13 Sundays the Holy Spirit of God's life himself in us to lead us and guide us into and to change our nature of our soul owners uh our spirit and and even to our flesh absolutely but God the vision of God is Not on your mistakes is what the thing we fixate on the most is the things that we've done wrong because that's the devil trying to condemn you for things that you've done that you repent for that God has washed away God wants you to continue to move forward in the perfect will that he has laid before you yeah he wants you to walk according to in that narrow path according to the way that God has sent you because God has called you for this Duty not somebody else you might sit and say Lord I can't do this there's somebody else qualified that's not your business your business is to do what God has put before you and don't worry about whether you're qualified or not if God said run through that wall right there don't worry about it there'll be a wa there'll be a door when you get there but we worry about circumstances yeah we worry about issues we worry about roadblocks and things that we because we dealt with so much into the natural things that it starts getting into our mind we start reasoning and things instead of just taking God's word and saying God if that's what you want what you want me to do that's what I'm going to do hey man praise the Lord God will have it done God will it will be done according to God's will amen look let's look at the difference now I kind of draw this Romans chapter eight and kind of draw this out a little as the difference between Saul or what became Saul later the latter saw instead of the beginning saw and David went through the adversity David had a same problems David went through the same issues there wasn't a whole lot of difference between David and Saul's lives there really wasn't if you look at the two together parallel the only thing that became the problem again was that Saul became self-willed and David continued to do God's will that's that's the biggest difference that's why David was the man after God's Own Heart to fulfill all his will now look as you read this at the parallel between David and Saul and between what we in our lives desire for our lives to be amen gentle Shepherd Lead Me amen rather than what our will with our our personal human will would be God you lead us look Romans 8 1. there is therefore now no condemnation no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who want not after the flesh but after the spirit that goes right along when we read this of course before with our study there's no condemnation amen the soul that is Born Again cannot sin amen we might make mistakes but the soul that is Born Again cannot sin thus there is no condemnation which is exactly what the devil wants to do to you he wants to condemn you for the mistakes little things in humanity the flesh that happens in our lives basically daily amen maybe somewhere often than others and we're all individuals but there's no but that's what Satan wants to continue God does not condemn you he might convict you if you've done something wrong he might convict you if you you feel in your spirit Lord I should have done that I shouldn't have said that that's just conviction that's not condemnation condemnation is something that beats you down and tries to make you feel like you're less than what you are hey Mom amen conviction is just something to say straighten up you shouldn't do that don't do it next time this situation Rises don't act that way again don't talk that way again don't do that action again amen it's just convicted and say well praise the Lord okay I know God's mindful of me condemnation says you are a low down rank sinner remember make Heaven says that's the devil's tactics there's no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus who what walk after the flesh walk after the spirit and not after the flesh amen you're not to walk after the flesh but after the spirit there's our two different there's our differences the two guys amen the man that walked after the flesh the latter Saul was the man after the flesh he did part of what God Said do I mean the rest of it he wanted her to do himself and try to disguise it by saying well we wanted to take these animals and offer them to God that's why we kept them alive no you do what God Said do don't worry about the sacrifice to God you just do what he said that's the best the best sacrifice you can give us the best sacrifice you can offer to God is just do his will amen that's the best sacrifice but he wants to take these animals that God considered violent refuse and offer him to God that's a stink in God's nostril to take something that's smelling stinky and offer to God as a as a sacrifice oh my but that was Saul a man in the flesh versus David now we're not talking about mistakes we're talking about the will of God the will of God David said yes Lord continue to press on Amen with the will of the Lord Saul would not do it God told Saul something to do wouldn't do it part of it me David did walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now think of it in our context in our day with you personally with me us for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak to the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law amen Christ himself the righteous one might be fulfilled in us who have now become the very righteousness of Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit how are we walking we're walking by the spirit that's what the Bible says amen we don't even walk by the letter of the word per se it says we walk by the spirit amen the spirit that leads us praise the Lord it won't lead us into doing something contrary to the word but it's the spirit that leads us going back to our last 13 messages led by the spirit the holy spirit amen that leading can be the indwelling presence in your soul could also just be that simple anointing that's on you the anointing of the Holy Spirit on you to lead you and guide you into all truth it's after the spirit not after the flesh amen for those that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is dead but to be spiritually minded is light and peace why because the carnal mind will do what he wants to do the spiritual mind will do what God wants them to do because the carnal mind is enmity here we get done the carnal mind is enemy is an enemy against God enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God if you're doing your own selfish will you cannot please God you can't do it amen but they that are but but ye that are not in the flesh but in the spirit is so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his now let's go over to the 26th verse led by the spirit versus being led by the flesh if you are led by the spirit of God not by your flesh you will you are a person after God's Own Heart because if you are led by the spirit you will fulfill all the will of God yes yes because God will lead you and guide you into the places the things he wants you to do now it's like we talked last week about that little wash woman it may have been that one thing but that woman lived her whole life before that time and after that time as just a woman of Just Another Woman but that one thing that God put on her heart to do she did it didn't see the result who gets the reward amen be walking by the spirit of God and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh if you're led by the spirit of God you will fulfill all the will of God if you fulfill all the will of God in your life you are a person after God's Own Heart just as much as David was I don't care any mistakes you ever made I don't care why literally to your secrets these are things people put you out for it does that's insignificant what the devil tries to put bring against you that is not what God looks at you're walking by the spirit amen you will fall and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh you will do what God's will is for you to do which makes you a person after God's Own Heart praise the Lord that's why God chose you that's why God filled you with his Spirit that's what God puts you on the Forefront of this battle of this day this spiritual battle that takes place in in Heavenly places and and and high places of spirits you can't see he puts you at the Forefront he puts you up on this pardon me but on this pedestal the show this is my bride this is the one that I have looked for all these thousands of years that was to come the end time this is her praise God she does my will she does what I call she's led by my spirit and she does what I ask her to do she's a she's my wife and I love her after my own heart because she came from him yes praise the Lord Romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities the spirit helps when we do wrong when mistakes we make we're infirmities that we have the spirit helps there you're led by the spirit but that Spirit also helps our infirmities our shortcomings wrongdoings of sicknesses for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make an intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered that's why the prayer that we have is not our own it's a relinquishing into the spirit so that the spirit can it be needs be pray through us what he wants to be said what he once accomplished so that we know what is this this is the perfect will of God and each one of it's very individual and then I think she put that the last chapter of my book praying to God is a very individual thing people try to mold themselves or match uh someone else or their prayer life or something prayer prayer to me is nothing more than talking to God right amen but prayer have people have made prayer to be something that they want others to hear don't make prayer be something you want others to hear make your prayer to be what you want to talk to God about yeah that's all and that's what prayer is it's communication you talk to God you you express to God verbally orally what you want to express to him he many times will Express back to us Maybe not audibly maybe not at that time well it will Express back to us the the utterances that he gives to us that's in the spirits ain't that that's a communication it's it's between God and His maker or between man and his maker see that we that we talk to and communicate with God does that groaning she can be uttered uh sometimes I pray things and I think why did I say that yeah yeah and then come to find out not all times but sometimes come to find out I know why it came out of my mouth it was something the Lord was trying to show me or tell me because if it's in my private time or something it's just you talk to God just speak to God Amen and her mother another brother tell me one time about you know praying in these and vowels and uh there's nothing right that's how you talk that's how you want to talk to God there's nothing wrong with that but then it starts building up into people like this great something they're supposed to do it's not something extraordinary or great just just talk to the Lord yes amen that's all it is communication and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he make an intercession for the Saints according to according to what the will of God you make an intercession for you according to the will of God that's why we accept the will of God that's why it goes back to this little boy that brother Brown talked about that his mommy was sick and he had this prayer book he just kept trying to find this prayer book and he kept trying to read prayers out of this book and expecting his mommy to be better and his mommy died you throw the prayer book in the fire and forgot about God and seeing this problem was some church some denomination or some body of position trying to teach someone this is what you want to pray to God just read out of this book that's not what it's about right and his mommy died why didn't his mommy die probably because I'll say it was the will of God amen that's why we accept the will of God I've told you Saints several times about when the Lord spoke to me about my sister I prayed for him prayed for it I was headed back from Flagstaff to Show Low and I just pray she came on my heart I turned uh I turned around I think he had brother brown or turned it off and I started praying and she was the focal point of my prayer Lord that God stopped me and said quit praying for her I said Lord why he said cause it's time for me to take her and I can't do it when you keep asking for her to be well I mean I'd just be bluntly honest things right yeah yeah and I said okay Lord I love her but I'm willing to let her go yes because I know she's going to better place anyway and I'll see her soon right I quit praying for her from that time and like he was like two weeks later she was gone Lord Tucker we found out like a week later called and we all flew out there and got to see her right before she passed it get to talk to her again or talk to her but no communication issues of comatose basically at that point in the last stages of her passing but the Lord took her then amen because it was the will of God and see if we can just look to understand that let our will be molded by God's will what is the mind of the spirit because God make an intercession for the Saints he makes intercession for us not according to our will but according to his will my will to would be to still have my sister here that would be my will my will would still to be have my mom and my dad here that would be my will my brother but that wasn't God's will but God makes intercession based on his will not mine and I accept by the spirit of God that is in me that I am led by the spirit of God God's perfect will even if the prayer that is praying to God did not come the way I wanted it to come amen I don't know that I've ever prayed any harder than when my first son was in distress and it looked very bleak and he basically from the moment he was born started to die and all the humanity that I could have in myself would look and say my sons dying but everything that I could possibly muster in my spirit in my life said God don't let it happen I I don't want him to go but it wasn't according to my will it was according to God's will then God sends the Blessed Assurance right that he always gives to know that according to his perfect will he makes everything work together which is our next scripture it makes everything work together for our good if we love it this past week I was able to talk to a man who is on a different team who is having financial trouble so he worked an extra week if you could do that if you want if you work and have a week off you can work uh you can work every week if you want they'll just take you and put you on another team and you work that week for that team with this guy's on somebody else's team he was working in his off week and he was working with a team that got paired with our team two days before we were supposed to leave Thursday three days Thursday Friday Saturday Sun three days before we were supposed to leave this team we were supposed to be on our own our team this week at this job and that man was put on that team at the last minute that team was paired with us at the last minute so that man would be in the same tunnel working with me at the same time right and thank God I got to speak to the man because his son had just passed away 14 years old lost a daughter before and and by the grace of God I didn't spend a whole lot of time with it I didn't try to push anything on him and or I didn't read him any Scripture I just reassured him and I just helped to strengthen him in some way if I could to help him realize that there's God's doing something amen God is doing there's a reason for it amen and I thank God for the opportunity to be able to do that because you never know but I I kept trying to find the time of the the perfect place time to speak to this man and I kept thinking well Lord I'll do it now and you know how you just you just got something you just want to do and you try to force it right you know brother random did that God will show him a vision that everything is the way it was and and he could be in the place for hours and it not be the way it was in the vision and and brother Brown would go and say okay let's start prayer now nothing happened and so why God why is nothing happening it wasn't according to God's will right God's will is what he showed him in the vision how many of us don't get Vision so we don't have that to fall on but it wasn't according to God's Will and the vision but when the vision came and see I believe there's this one vision the only thing that was out of cater from the vision was a hat a hat had to be moved from one place to the other and brother Brown could not be the one to go move that hat because he knew what the vision was right he could have just as easily as a human went over and put it where it was in a vision but that wouldn't have not been God's will he had to wait and carry until somehow that hat got put exactly where it's supposed to be when that when that Vision fulfilled itself he could go in there with the authority of God and say in Jesus Christ's name get up and walk or whatever you be well yeah and she was so many times that week I tried to force a conversation to talk to this man or try to find a spot and it just never worked out until Friday it it he came out one door I came in the other door and we were right there together and looked at each other and it clicked I said this is it that's when the time to be able to speak to him because it isn't just what you do a lot of times it's how you do it and when you do it yes that that makes the perfect will of God just doing something is is just being busy but doing and and you can be I'm not saying don't be busy for the Lord uh but but it's can I say it this way it's just better to be busy for the Lord according to God's Will and not according to your will and what you think or how you think or where you think or when you think let it be what God is doing and what he leads you to do yes and then God's will will be performed amen as God would do according to the intercession by his will not our will right and we know that all things work together for uh for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so if you love God not just have some affinity for them or you just like hanging around or something but if you really true love God unconditionally if he might take your firstborn or if catastrophic things might happen or whatever it is destroy your home take he took everything job having his wife really amen and job praised God worship God even when his wife turned against him the most dear thing in his life I'd say it's the most dear thing it was the most dear thing in my life so I figure my wife's the most dear thing in my life every husband should feel the same way maybe he didn't but I would think that he did and she turned on it and he said you speaking like a foolish woman you listen too much Oprah you need to turn that thing off amen you're talking like a worldly person shall we expect things from God and God take things from us and we give him glory when he gives us up and curse him when he takes it now what kind of a Christian is that right right it's not one the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord right amen praise God and all this job did not sin with his mouth according to the scripture praise the Lord all things work together for our good if we love him that's the problem a lot of people get into they don't love God unconditionally they might love some of the things he's done for them they might love the sensation you're feeling or they might love the uh have an affinity for the attraction and the Brotherhood and things like that but they don't really love God unconditionally if you don't love God unconditionally it doesn't work right it won't work for you amen amen you've got to trust him he's interceding according to his perfect will not mine amen not mine little boy wanted his mother to live I don't blame him I want my mom to live too amen but when it comes down to it Lord not my will but your will be done amen amen that is not a lack of faith to make that statement is not a lack of faith amen no sir it is you wanting the desire in your life of God's will for you and for everybody that uh but but in your life you want God's will saying Lord your will be done uh not let my will die to your will is not a lack of faith if it is then Jesus had a lack of faith because he said the same thing In The Garden of Gethsemane did Jesus not say not my will but thine be none right but people will crucify you for making that statement and say you just don't believe yes I do I believe that I want what God's perfect will in my life is to be fulfilled I believe that one whatever it might be whatever it might be the will of God first Peter that's a couple more scriptures I'm going to close here amen so we walk it's a relationship as you turn over to First Peter chapter four it's a relationship if it's not a relationship you'll never understand it amen if it's a relationship then you can have that relationship not with the pastor not with one another with Jesus Christ amen our relationship is with Christ not with brother Branham not with ourselves uh with with our friends family our relationship this spiritual relationship is with is with Jesus Christ him alone walking after the spirit is to walk in Christ with with him relation amen First Peter chapter four for uh chapter 4 verse 12. beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you but rejoice fiery trials now rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed he may be glad also with exceeding Joy well that just goes back basically to what job said we don't praise God when he gives us stuff and curse him when he takes it away amen we go through fiery trust why do we consider that something extraordinary it's not we consider ourselves in by walking by the spirit the sufferings of Christ so that when the glory of God is revealed we're there with him and that glory is revealed in US praise the Lord oh amen exceeding Joy 14th verse now if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your parties glorified but let none of you suffer as murmur uh as murder as a or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a busybody in other man's matters If any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on his on this behalf and he's saying if you're just being an evil person and you're suffering you're in jail because she stole a car that's your fault that's not God's fault you don't say oh woe is me because you killed a person and you're in jail for it that's your fault that's not God's fault but when you suffer as you are living the will of God as a Christian then count it all glory see don't be ashamed of that for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first began at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the sin the ungodly and The Sinner appear wherefore let him that suffer according to the will of according to what suffer according to what the will of God amen not according to your mistakes or things you've done amen but according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him and well-doing as unto a faithful creator amen only according to the will of God two more quick scriptures and I'm going to close Mark chapter 3. Mark chapter 3 verse 35 Mark 3 35 says for whosoever shall do the will of God listen this whosoever shall do the will of God the same as my brother and my sister my mother who what does the will of God not some of it all of it all the will of God one more Saint John chapter 7. now this is very important this is something a lot of people seem to negate forget about but this is a very important scripture Saint John chapter 7 verse 16. Jesus answered them and said my Doctrine is not mine people want to Major on Doctrine all the time even though we're led by the spirit they want a major on Doctrine all the time or or on gifts tongues that kind of thing my Doctrine is not mine but his that sent me well it would that not be the same for all of us well if we believe we're sent by God shall be the same amen then it's not mine it's his which means I don't have a thought coming I just say what he tells me to say I'd say what he puts what he puts in his word amen praise the Lord If any man now this is it now listen real close we'll close if any man will do his will ye shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself if you do the will of God see that's why people they forget about they say well uh I I talked about it uh brother green talked about it a lot uh when when you people would say something spoke to you or or something tingled in you or something like that uh many times I'll say it it either rings the bell or doesn't something that that connects to you if you do the will of God you will know if this is of God or not if you do the will of God there's no debate to me now people can say what they want they leave this message left and right but if you do the will of God you will know that this message is the truth you will know that brother Rana was the prophet of God for this day send by God to bring a message to a bride to dress her and get her ready for a Rapture there is no debate amen and to me since there is no debate I don't concern myself with other I know what his word says and in my life to do the will of God I don't worry about that now if I go and listen to somebody else or something like I've said before I've heard of the ministers at time and nothing I'd say recently because honestly I don't listen to a lot of other ministers very very seldom do I unless they're preaching from this Pulpit very soon God told me not to one day get to involve people give me tapes and a DVD here or a tape here or something here and something there and found myself trying to preach like them and say what they said and preach on their Revelation and stuff that they had that was so deep from God even though I didn't understand it God said quit doing that right I said yes sir Lord I took them and I put them away never seen one since because I want to do what he wants me to do and now whatever the Lord gives me it comes straight to me from him right amen come straight to me and if it doesn't I'll say it again if it doesn't ring that Bell and me then I I just pushed to the side I don't say the brother's wrong I don't say the sister's wrong I don't say that I'm writing everything and they're wrong and everything I just put it to the side because it doesn't strike with me I can't match it in the word I can't find it in the message which is come from the word then I I leave it alone that's not what the Lord and I've had people come and say well you need to do this you need to do that I said I'm going to tell you something and I'll tell every one of you here if you're watching I got one thing I am to do and that's to do what he tells me to do not you I'm not going to preach something somebody tells me yeah you need to preach on this no I need to preach exactly what God gives me to preach period now if it happens to some come come to that point okay but if God does it there we are that's the only thing I am obligated to obey is what the Lord tells me and shows me to do and by his grace I do the best I can I'm not perfect we all make mistakes do things maybe even get in our minds or something but I try to do what the Lord tells me to do not what anybody else tells me to do and you that's only an example in my heart of what I try you've got to do the same every one of you don't have to be a minister to follow that uh that analogy every one of us Falls in that category to do just what the will of God is for you amen if you feel it's God's will God will bring you into that place and everything will work out together for your good because you're obeying the will of God why was David a man after God's Own Heart why was he because he's fulfill all the will of God amen Saints I'm here to tell you you're born of the spirit filled it's filled with the spirit born again you follow the will of God if you fulfill all the will of God in your life not your mistakes not the things Satan keeps trying to continue with but the perfect will of God for your life you are as much at the heart of God as David was in the scripture amen because we belong to him just as much as you taken from him as a part of him we came from him we're going back to him and in the meantime we just try to do everything that God puts us before us to do amen and that's all we can do that's all God expects of us amen and expect some great thing to happen we're all not every minister in the message is supposed to have 10 000 people in their congregation amen it was funny we were sitting at dinner Friday night and we were talking about because our manager is supposed to be retiring next year and whether we're going to the rest of our team doesn't want to work really with any other teams we're like we should just talk with because I I mean what's going to happen so we talk about and I think well I just wonder what the Lord's got for me next because I've been a teacher I've been a realtor I've been a pastor Minister uh I've been a purchasing manager um I've been an Uber driver of what forget all the best so I wonder what's kind of electrician I wonder what's coming next I'm a manager looked at me and said well I think the car wash Builder's the best one I said well that's what they told me in school too that I missed my calling so all I know is just when the Lord puts it before me that's all I know to do I wasn't looking for the job with brother Roger uh I was helping driving around like K and different ones and helping Mary and getting enough money and the Lord blessed to live by and brother Roger calls me up and says you want you want to work uh one I need some help you want to help me one day I said sure he's my buddies my friend I'll go help him well I didn't know he wanted me to help him as a job every day it turned into a whole job that lasted two years which propelled me into this next job when I was when um uh Julie talked to him I didn't want to talk to the man I was not interested at all I was happy where I was uh I was glad to be working with a brother and I was happy with brother Roger and the man called me and asked me to meet him I didn't call him I said I don't I told Julie I don't want his number she said well I'm sorry but I already gave you his number I said well that's okay he'll call me and I'll either say no or hear what he has to say and everybody had to say and we met on down in Sarita and he said well this is the job whether you wonder if you want it it's yours if you don't and now I come to find out he didn't hire anybody like that nobody that I know has been hired like that everybody else said well what's your experience what do you know your resume doesn't match your your application I didn't even put an application in I only sent a resume to him a few words after he hired me just to put it on file I won't even spot so when God does it you don't have to worry about all the other yes just fulfill the will of God and God will take care of the rest amen now if it comes at some time before I retire before the Lord takes us home it goes to something else I don't know astronaut who else is left I know I can't do that I get sick what else has the Lord got in store I don't know but he's got something for everyone of us amen and then uh the guy that was the curmudges really a good friend now buddy uh he said well if you have enough people in your church you wouldn't have to have a second job I well whatever the Lord Wills that's okay if it's that way that's fine I don't mind working don't mind at all amen but it's according to whatever he does whatever he says that's what I want to do amen that's all I know to do so let's stand if we could all right amen I'm thankful that the Lord shows us reveals to us if you will the things that he wants us to do and if we don't if we don't look for Revelation if we don't believe in Revelation look for Revelation then how could how can we get a revelation from God how can he show us things if we don't even believe it amen it must be something that's in our hearts it must be a genuine desire amen when I talk to the Lord about getting rid of this place next door I don't do it out of spite then I don't begrudge the man of earning a living like anybody he can earn a living he's a man and he has a right to that as much as any of us do just don't do it here that guy that was next door he wants to put ink all over people that's his choice if people want to go to him and have ink put all over by him that's their choice just don't do it there there's all kinds of places around here just don't do it here that's my only cry I'm not against the guy I've worked over there a couple times a nice guy but just not
