[51:14] we give you thanks and praise
[51:16] and offer it in the name of the lord
[51:18] jesus christ as we pray it to you amen
[51:22] amen saint luke chapter 5
[51:27] amen
[51:29] we're going to begin with verse 1.
[51:31] amen read through verse 11. it came to
[51:34] pass that as the people pressed upon him
[51:36] to hear the word of god
[51:38] my wouldn't that be great today
[51:41] to be pressed upon to hear the word of
[51:43] god sometimes it seems like people run
[51:46] to keep from hearing the word of god
[51:48] amen but the people pressed him
[51:50] to hear the word of god he stood by the
[51:53] lake of genezera he saw two ships
[51:56] standing by the lake
[51:57] but uh but the fishermen were gone out
[51:59] of them and were washing their nets
[52:01] he entered into the one of the ships
[52:03] which was simon's
[52:05] and prayed him that he would thrust out
[52:07] a little from the land and he sat down
[52:09] and taught the people at the ship
[52:12] now when he had left speaking he said
[52:13] unto simon
[52:15] launch out into the deep and let down
[52:17] your nets for a draft
[52:19] simon answering said unto him master we
[52:22] have toiled all the night and have taken
[52:25] nothing
[52:26] nevertheless that thy word i will let
[52:28] down the net and when he had done this
[52:31] they enclosed a great multitude of
[52:33] fishes and their nets break they
[52:36] beckoned unto their partners which were
[52:38] in another ship
[52:40] that they should come and help them and
[52:42] they came and filled both ships so that
[52:44] they began to sink when simon peter saw
[52:47] he fell down at jesus knee saying depart
[52:50] from me for i am a sinful man oh lord
[52:53] for he was astonished at all
[52:56] all that were with him at the draft of
[53:00] fish which he had taken
[53:02] and so was also james and john the sons
[53:05] of zebedee which were partners with
[53:07] simon and jesus said unto simon fear not
[53:10] from henceforth thou shalt catch men
[53:13] when they had brought their ships to
[53:15] land they forsook all and followed him
[53:18] so you can be seen and if you'd like
[53:21] praise god
[53:23] my saints i i tell you is i read through
[53:25] the 11 verses of this chapter i feel
[53:28] like there's a dozen messages i can
[53:29] preach right now
[53:31] but we're going to stick with the lord
[53:32] the one i feel like the lord gave us
[53:34] yesterday amen that we're going to take
[53:37] out of the out of the fifth verse
[53:39] amen um
[53:43] i i think it's outstanding in the in the
[53:45] climate that we live in today
[53:48] uh that there are still
[53:50] people
[53:51] who will feel in their hearts the uh the
[53:54] pull the press that these people did on
[53:57] that day
[53:58] when they called to jesus and they
[53:59] pulled on him preach to us the word of
[54:02] god teach to us the word of god we want
[54:05] to hear the word of god we want to know
[54:07] the word of god it seems like things
[54:09] have been so saturated today in the
[54:11] world it's become so common to people
[54:14] today that
[54:15] and and and almost a know-it-all
[54:17] situation or attitude that people think
[54:19] they don't need to be taught anymore
[54:21] they don't need to hear anymore but how
[54:23] many times have you read a scripture and
[54:26] the and the 50th time you read that
[54:28] scripture the lord speaks to you
[54:29] something different than he did the
[54:31] first four times
[54:32] [Music]
[54:33] amen it's just always the same when you
[54:35] listen to a tape you might listen to it
[54:37] a dozen times
[54:39] but that 12th time lord might speak
[54:41] something to you out of that that you
[54:43] never saw before that never showed you
[54:45] before or the 100th time don't know what
[54:47] it is but it's a living word and god's
[54:49] always speaking through it and there's
[54:51] always going to be a people that thirst
[54:54] for that there's always going to be
[54:56] people that have a hunger and a thirst
[54:58] for that word for that pull they want
[55:01] that because that's their sustaining
[55:03] life
[55:04] it's what sustains them spiritually
[55:06] without it they feel like they're going
[55:08] to die
[55:09] if you've been without the word of god
[55:10] for any time of all at all or been in a
[55:13] place of stagnation sometimes it's like
[55:15] that moping stage of the eagle but it
[55:18] gets to that place where you just gotta
[55:19] have that fresh meat
[55:21] you just gotta have that word because
[55:23] it's the only thing that sustains you
[55:25] it's the only thing that keeps you going
[55:26] the only thing that keeps you alive that
[55:29] keeps you viable without it you feel
[55:31] like it's just null and void you want to
[55:34] have a purpose-driven life friend there
[55:37] it is
[55:38] i've never read the book don't know
[55:39] anything about it i understand the
[55:41] premise of it but if you want a
[55:43] purpose-driven life friend that's it
[55:45] without that there is no drive in my
[55:47] life
[55:48] my life has no meaning without that
[55:51] praise the lord
[55:52] but as jesus made preparation that's not
[55:55] going to be my message but as god made
[55:57] preparation
[55:59] uh
[56:00] jesus
[56:01] he goes to simon he says uh
[56:04] take the boat out a little bit so i can
[56:05] preach to him and after the word had
[56:07] gone forth uh the spiritual food had
[56:10] been uh digested had he been ingested it
[56:13] was time to go and get some natural food
[56:15] so jesus told simon launch out into the
[56:18] deep and let down your nets for a
[56:21] drought
[56:22] simon answering said unto him now look
[56:24] at now look at the look at peter simon
[56:27] peter's answer
[56:29] master we have toiled all the night and
[56:32] have taken nothing
[56:34] amen now jesus gave a command
[56:38] jesus gave his word to peter now what in
[56:41] the word that you found that he may have
[56:43] found her that he may have said before
[56:45] in the old testament or torah whatever
[56:46] it may not have been something that was
[56:48] written down but it was the word of god
[56:50] amen imagine any command to you that
[56:52] comes from god is the word of god to you
[56:55] no matter what it is that word was the
[56:57] word of god it becomes the word of god
[56:59] to us because it's in this
[57:01] canonized bible that we have today this
[57:03] inspired writ that god gave us so it's
[57:06] word to us but to simon peter it was
[57:08] just jesus telling him this was the
[57:11] command this was something jesus was
[57:13] asking peter go do this
[57:16] and peter begin to now look
[57:19] i i know none of us have done this but
[57:21] peter began to make excuse
[57:24] the master we've been out there
[57:27] we've toiled all night long the two
[57:30] ships we've been there we've done this
[57:32] we've been out there and we caught
[57:34] absolutely nothing
[57:36] tired
[57:37] exasperated exhausted because they got
[57:40] no sleep working slaving pulling the
[57:43] nets in out trying to catch fish
[57:46] and peter's in his in
[57:48] his heart he's
[57:49] he's thinking well master lord
[57:52] we've toiled all night long
[57:55] we didn't catch a thing
[57:57] there's nothing out there
[58:00] but then some of the greatest words that
[58:02] he could speak
[58:03] nevertheless lord
[58:05] at your word amen praise the lord
[58:09] nevertheless at your word
[58:11] now i want to speak on uh i just titled
[58:14] this today could have been several
[58:15] titles but uh the sheep of the good
[58:18] shepherd
[58:20] the sheep of the good shepherd because
[58:22] sheep are led we know that sheep are to
[58:25] be led she can't leave themselves and
[58:28] god likens us to sheep god made us like
[58:32] sheep yes he made us to the point that
[58:34] we would have to have a shepherd that we
[58:37] would have to have somebody lead us
[58:40] and that's the thing that
[58:42] today seems to be lost
[58:45] amen seems to be lost in people people
[58:47] want to today lead themselves
[58:50] and the leading of yourself is
[58:53] absolutely contrary to the word of god
[58:57] the only way that you could lead
[58:58] yourself is to get outside of god's word
[59:01] and will to be able to do it if you lead
[59:04] yourself you are out of god's will i
[59:07] don't care who it is am i i don't care
[59:09] who we are i don't care christian
[59:11] non-christian whoever it is i told you
[59:13] the other day we're all born with a soul
[59:16] and that soul is to cry out to god for
[59:18] that uh for that worship even when
[59:21] brother branham talked about he went to
[59:22] the native lands and he would see the
[59:24] the uh they're dancing around and and
[59:27] they're praying and i i believe one time
[59:30] uh he tells a story where they were down
[59:33] praying to their son god or whatever it
[59:35] was and brother branham said stop the
[59:36] car he hopped out and he started praying
[59:39] too
[59:40] and and he got back in the car the
[59:42] brother says maybe
[59:44] maybe it was brother sidney jackson i
[59:45] can't remember anyway he said he said do
[59:48] you know what they were doing he said
[59:49] yeah they were praying to their god
[59:51] and i'm paraphrasing he said but do you
[59:54] know who they were praying to he said i
[59:56] don't he said well this god that god
[59:58] whatever it was but he said i know who i
[1:00:00] was praying to
[1:00:01] they're praying to the deity that they
[1:00:02] know
[1:00:03] amen and i pray to the deity that i know
[1:00:06] there's that inherentness in every human
[1:00:09] born with a soul because that soul wants
[1:00:11] to live just like the body wants to live
[1:00:13] to cry out to its maker
[1:00:15] now some may not understand or know who
[1:00:17] that maker is sometimes a lot of times
[1:00:20] the things of life tamp that down and
[1:00:22] push that down to the place that
[1:00:24] people's hearts get blackened and
[1:00:26] darkened sometimes people get caught in
[1:00:29] cages it reminds me brother ram talked
[1:00:31] about going to the zoo
[1:00:32] and he said if i had enough money i'd
[1:00:34] set him one of them loose because it it
[1:00:36] just becked his soul but what it did is
[1:00:38] it reminded him of god's children being
[1:00:41] caught in cages
[1:00:43] now he talked about denominational cages
[1:00:46] but there's a lot more different cages
[1:00:48] than just the denominational cage now
[1:00:50] it's the same spirit
[1:00:52] amen but people call it these cages
[1:00:55] they're they're bound and they don't
[1:00:56] even realize it people of the world they
[1:00:59] think they're free they're not free
[1:01:01] they're bound in cages right whatever
[1:01:04] cage it might be a government government
[1:01:06] cage or
[1:01:08] whatever it might uh the the situation
[1:01:11] might be people are they they succumb to
[1:01:13] these cages
[1:01:15] where they where they're in that cage
[1:01:17] and they look at others with scorn
[1:01:21] uh
[1:01:22] thinking that that they're the ones
[1:01:24] people who look at us and think well
[1:01:26] you're the ones in the cage
[1:01:28] well i if i am it's jesus's cage
[1:01:32] and that's the only cage i want to be in
[1:01:34] so if i'm in a cage it's his cage and
[1:01:37] i'll stay there praise the lord because
[1:01:39] he set me free to worship him to serve
[1:01:42] him
[1:01:43] but in the world today
[1:01:45] people want to worship themselves
[1:01:47] there's actually ministers out there
[1:01:48] very popular ministries that promote you
[1:01:52] as your own god
[1:01:54] you are your own god you know do what
[1:01:57] feels good to you or what sounds good to
[1:02:00] you or what makes you happy friend look
[1:02:05] this may sound bad
[1:02:07] but i'm not here to be happy
[1:02:11] i like being happy i enjoy happiness
[1:02:14] because god makes me happy but i'm not
[1:02:16] here to be happy
[1:02:19] i i'm not here to have the best of
[1:02:21] everything right
[1:02:23] i'm not here to uh drive the fanciest
[1:02:25] cars have the biggest house had the most
[1:02:27] lands had the most i'm not here to live
[1:02:30] a comfortable life i'm not here to be
[1:02:32] cushy uh ooey gooey life i'm not here to
[1:02:36] walk a flowery bed of ease
[1:02:38] i'm here to serve the lord jesus
[1:02:42] we forget so many times people forget
[1:02:45] this is not about us
[1:02:49] it's about him
[1:02:51] and our service to him
[1:02:54] i want this has nothing to do with it
[1:02:58] well i want to do this well you go right
[1:03:01] ahead i mean now trust not trust me
[1:03:05] people will throw well the bible says
[1:03:07] that he would grant me the desires of my
[1:03:09] heart yes it will
[1:03:11] but what if the desire of your heart is
[1:03:13] like your little son wanted to uh want
[1:03:17] the car keys
[1:03:20] or or wanting the razor blade
[1:03:24] what what if your little girl wants to
[1:03:26] wants to uh
[1:03:28] play with scissors or or
[1:03:31] and don't know how to handle it
[1:03:33] i mean
[1:03:35] it's not two conflating things friend
[1:03:38] for god to grant us to desire our heart
[1:03:40] and for us to serve him
[1:03:42] if the desire of my heart is to fall in
[1:03:45] the will of god god will bless to desire
[1:03:48] my heart and if our desire of our heart
[1:03:50] is to serve him and whatever that means
[1:03:53] then that's what he does yes peter said
[1:03:56] at thy word lord
[1:03:59] i want to do whatever you tell me to do
[1:04:02] you are my shepherd i am a sheep i am to
[1:04:06] be led you are the good shepherd and the
[1:04:09] good shepherd lays down his life for his
[1:04:11] sheep
[1:04:12] he leaves the 90-9 and goes after the
[1:04:15] one
[1:04:16] we work so hard
[1:04:18] and people slaves so hard in this life
[1:04:21] to make an easier life and there's
[1:04:22] nothing wrong with that to have a little
[1:04:25] money to be able to enjoy a home or a a
[1:04:27] automobile or to live uncomfortably
[1:04:29] there's nothing wrong with that god
[1:04:31] bless is in that there's nothing wrong
[1:04:33] with that but the point is i'm not here
[1:04:35] to satisfy me
[1:04:38] if my motives and my objectives and my
[1:04:42] purposes and what i do and my motives
[1:04:44] that generate what i do and how i act
[1:04:47] and where i go and how i speak and what
[1:04:50] i
[1:04:51] is for me then i'm wrong
[1:04:55] it's got to be for him
[1:04:58] first and foremost my life is for him
[1:05:01] this is not about me
[1:05:04] this life is not about you
[1:05:06] it's not about you having stuff it's not
[1:05:09] about you being comfortable it's not
[1:05:12] about you being happy i'm sorry that
[1:05:15] might sound wrong but it's not
[1:05:17] now does god give us those things sure
[1:05:19] he does does god bless us with happiness
[1:05:22] does he bless us with health does he
[1:05:23] bless us with families and absolutely he
[1:05:25] does and we're thankful for that but
[1:05:27] that's him doing it in my servitude to
[1:05:30] him it's not about us it's about our
[1:05:32] service to him amen amen about him and
[1:05:35] our service to him
[1:05:37] praise the lord brother ram said here in
[1:05:39] the message leadership he says we have
[1:05:42] to be led
[1:05:43] you know god likened us unto sheep and
[1:05:46] did you know a sheep can't lead itself
[1:05:49] he'll wander away stray away he just
[1:05:52] can't lead himself he has to have
[1:05:54] somebody to lead him
[1:05:56] the shepherd is supposed to lead the
[1:05:58] sheep now that
[1:06:00] was back in the days of the lord jesus
[1:06:03] he's the good shepherd that lead the
[1:06:05] sheep
[1:06:06] praise the lord and we are the sheep of
[1:06:08] that good shepherd
[1:06:10] he laid down his life
[1:06:12] as micah so wonderfully saved he laid
[1:06:15] down his life for even me
[1:06:18] praise the lord that makes him the good
[1:06:20] shepherd
[1:06:21] he would leave the 99 and go after me if
[1:06:24] i went astray you went astray he'd leave
[1:06:26] all the others and celebrate just like
[1:06:28] the prodigal son we read last week
[1:06:30] celebrate
[1:06:32] greater that the one that had went
[1:06:34] astray had come back than the 99 that
[1:06:36] never left
[1:06:40] well that doesn't seem fair just like
[1:06:41] the prodigal son's brother
[1:06:44] he said the same thing well that doesn't
[1:06:46] seem fair daddy you did all this for him
[1:06:48] and this for him and he did this this
[1:06:49] and this he said yeah but your brother
[1:06:51] was lost and now he's back
[1:06:55] he's found now he's back home let's
[1:06:58] celebrate that praise the lord
[1:07:01] but i never left well but all i got is
[1:07:03] yours you don't have to worry about that
[1:07:06] it's not about you
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:10] he had to remind his son it's not about
[1:07:12] you son it's not the older son it's not
[1:07:15] about you
[1:07:16] praise the lord that's so prayful isn't
[1:07:19] it you want to make everything about us
[1:07:21] oh there's so many ministries so many
[1:07:23] voices out there today that want to try
[1:07:25] to make it all about us not about us
[1:07:28] it's not about you it's about him who am
[1:07:30] i praise the lord it's about you how
[1:07:33] many times how many times dear we lived
[1:07:35] in places we didn't really want to or do
[1:07:37] things we didn't really want to go
[1:07:39] places or what
[1:07:42] but
[1:07:44] but it's service to him
[1:07:46] amen and he blesses it
[1:07:48] praise the lord and he blesses us in it
[1:07:51] grants us even the very desires of our
[1:07:52] hearts so what does it say it's just
[1:07:54] like peter said at thy word lord
[1:07:57] see that's obedience at thy word lord
[1:07:59] not my word
[1:08:00] at your word lord
[1:08:02] now sometimes we'll get
[1:08:06] up about it and say well
[1:08:08] i don't want to do that well
[1:08:10] that's your choice you're a free moral
[1:08:12] legend you can do it and not do it it's
[1:08:14] your choice but do we want to serve the
[1:08:16] lord
[1:08:17] or do we not do we want to make excuses
[1:08:19] peter make excuses oh lord we've been
[1:08:21] twirling all night
[1:08:24] we've
[1:08:24] we've been out there all night long god
[1:08:27] and there's nothing out there let's go
[1:08:29] give it let's go give it another try
[1:08:32] you know what he did over to in john 21
[1:08:35] after his resurrection he's out on the
[1:08:38] bank
[1:08:40] and they thought it was him but they
[1:08:41] weren't sure
[1:08:43] and he said do you have it in me
[1:08:46] no we've been twirling all night and we
[1:08:48] don't have a thing
[1:08:49] well throw your net on the other side of
[1:08:51] the boat
[1:08:53] well what good is that gonna do
[1:08:55] fish aren't here they aren't here
[1:08:57] how are they gonna be over here not over
[1:08:59] here just so you're dead on the other
[1:09:00] side of the boat that's your word lord
[1:09:02] threw the net on the other side of the
[1:09:04] boat and had so many they had to get the
[1:09:05] whole thing to drag them in couldn't
[1:09:07] couldn't hardly have enough big enough
[1:09:09] boat to hold the fish
[1:09:11] well here he said at thy word and when
[1:09:13] he said at thy word what did god do he
[1:09:16] granted the desire of their heart and
[1:09:18] gave so many fish
[1:09:20] two bolts were sinking
[1:09:23] two boats were sinking
[1:09:25] just because of his obedience just
[1:09:27] because he did what god told him to do
[1:09:29] now what happens if peter said you know
[1:09:32] i i'm done we've already washed our nets
[1:09:34] we've already cleaned up we're tired as
[1:09:36] we can be i'm just gonna go home
[1:09:39] what would have happened
[1:09:42] amen they had no fish
[1:09:45] the experience that they have
[1:09:48] the lesson that they have
[1:09:50] peter that peter and and jesus
[1:09:54] this is just an example to you
[1:09:56] because now you're going to become
[1:09:58] fishers of men
[1:10:00] have thy word lord whatever you say lord
[1:10:04] but look at this
[1:10:05] he was the good shepherd he is the good
[1:10:08] shepherd that lead the sheep now this is
[1:10:11] the rest of this quote but today you see
[1:10:14] we're living in another day everything
[1:10:16] is changed and perverted
[1:10:19] you know what man you know what man has
[1:10:22] to lead sheep today
[1:10:24] a goat
[1:10:27] right who's following the goat
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] you know where that goat leads them
[1:10:35] right into the slaughter
[1:10:38] now this is
[1:10:40] pertinent to us
[1:10:41] i just
[1:10:43] i feel his presence just
[1:10:45] coming so strong so i'm going to
[1:10:48] stop a little bit
[1:10:51] notice this
[1:10:53] in
[1:10:54] in a later scripture as i read it again
[1:10:58] you know where the goat leads them
[1:11:00] right into the slaughter
[1:11:03] what's the goat the goat is a
[1:11:05] representation of
[1:11:08] something
[1:11:09] someone
[1:11:10] that is not positioned to be in the
[1:11:13] leadership of a shepherd right
[1:11:17] amen like
[1:11:19] like being led by
[1:11:21] something other than god or some entity
[1:11:24] other than god or or or
[1:11:26] uh
[1:11:28] some other word or some other
[1:11:30] religion or doctrine or something
[1:11:33] there's something that leads them and
[1:11:35] and that leadership is going to send
[1:11:38] them to the slaughterhouse
[1:11:40] now there's there's those that god has
[1:11:44] god has a purpose for everything
[1:11:47] and there's a reason why
[1:11:50] people are what they are where they are
[1:11:53] what they do
[1:11:54] there's a reason god has goats out there
[1:11:59] god could take all the goats away if he
[1:12:01] wanted to
[1:12:03] amen now i know in the sports world that
[1:12:05] means the greatest of all time but it
[1:12:06] doesn't mean that in the spiritual world
[1:12:09] god has there's goats out there and god
[1:12:12] allows them to be there because they
[1:12:14] serve a purpose
[1:12:16] they do
[1:12:17] uh it may seem strange but
[1:12:20] just like
[1:12:22] god allows the devil to continue to roam
[1:12:24] and do and this is satan's even because
[1:12:27] god's got a purpose for that
[1:12:29] god allows the devil to do that for a
[1:12:31] reason he's a he's a tool in the hand of
[1:12:33] god i've said it many times yes we know
[1:12:35] the devil's nothing more than a tool in
[1:12:37] the hand of god
[1:12:40] so god leaves those goats in their
[1:12:42] positions
[1:12:44] to lead
[1:12:46] certain ones astray
[1:12:48] and it happens that way that they follow
[1:12:50] them now they're following them based on
[1:12:53] their free moral agency they can choose
[1:12:55] to follow them or not follow them right
[1:12:59] but there is a true shepherd yes
[1:13:02] and there are true shepherds uh plural
[1:13:06] the smallest under that great shepherd
[1:13:10] yes
[1:13:11] that are to lead into
[1:13:13] uh
[1:13:14] into the pastures
[1:13:17] into green lands
[1:13:19] into
[1:13:20] the
[1:13:20] the purity of and holiness of god
[1:13:25] there's plenty of goats that lead others
[1:13:27] to the slaughter but god has those under
[1:13:29] the good shepherd that lead people into
[1:13:32] greener pastures amen amen just like
[1:13:35] psalm 23 said he's he is my shepherd he
[1:13:38] leadeth me
[1:13:39] amen a lot of people don't understand
[1:13:41] they see
[1:13:42] especially the nomination people they
[1:13:44] they can quote the psalm 23 but they
[1:13:46] don't even know what it means
[1:13:48] the shepherd leadeth me
[1:13:51] well that's not me that doesn't have
[1:13:53] anything to do with me that's him
[1:13:54] leading me
[1:13:56] right into green pastures
[1:13:58] and where he wants me to go
[1:14:00] but god uses those to bring that
[1:14:03] uh
[1:14:04] that leading of those sheep about
[1:14:07] there's goats that lead others into the
[1:14:09] slaughter they're not of the true
[1:14:12] shepherd they're not of the good
[1:14:13] shepherd they're not called to be a
[1:14:16] shepherd under the good shepherd right
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:21] and god allows that
[1:14:23] but it's people that just take it upon
[1:14:26] themselves to do whatever they want to
[1:14:29] do for whatever reason now we've seen
[1:14:32] the scripture many times the bible talks
[1:14:34] about like we read that scripture last
[1:14:36] week by force or for filthy lucr and
[1:14:39] things like that for popularity and for
[1:14:41] money and what all
[1:14:44] peter tells us that in his writings so
[1:14:46] we know that there's purpose behind it
[1:14:48] but but leading goats leading people
[1:14:53] right into the slaughter
[1:14:55] look now them little sheep
[1:14:58] don't know where they're going see
[1:15:00] because even if it's a sheep a sheep
[1:15:02] they still have to be led
[1:15:06] they still don't know
[1:15:08] they're just following
[1:15:10] because that's all they know to do
[1:15:16] where they're going so the gold gloves
[1:15:18] goes up to the pen up to the slaughter
[1:15:21] and the sheep don't know no more than to
[1:15:23] follow a leader
[1:15:25] so it leads them right up into this
[1:15:27] slaughter
[1:15:28] and then the goat jumps over off the
[1:15:31] track and the sheep just goes right in
[1:15:33] and gets killed right into the slaughter
[1:15:36] so the goat was a wrong leader
[1:15:39] or not ordained called predestined to
[1:15:43] lead
[1:15:44] but jesus the good shepherd who led the
[1:15:47] sheep he led them to life and held their
[1:15:50] hand but somebody has to lead the sheep
[1:15:56] amen god
[1:15:57] leads the sheep now let's
[1:16:00] go to a different scripture luke chapter
[1:16:02] 22.
[1:16:10] when a sheep lives its life all it knows
[1:16:13] really is just to live the life of a
[1:16:16] sheep
[1:16:17] it bears wool because it's his sheep
[1:16:20] a sheep can't manufacture wool
[1:16:23] but it can bear wool
[1:16:25] it can't create wool but it can bear
[1:16:28] wool
[1:16:29] but it bears wool because it's a sheep
[1:16:33] that's all
[1:16:34] if you're a sheep you bear wool right
[1:16:37] that's what you do
[1:16:38] you don't make it you know
[1:16:40] and
[1:16:41] that's the dividing line the difference
[1:16:43] between holiness and living as a
[1:16:45] holiness a living and and uh
[1:16:51] being forced to do it
[1:16:53] uh
[1:16:55] being made to do it so you can't
[1:16:56] manufacture it but you can't bear it
[1:16:59] if you're a sheep
[1:17:00] you can't manufacture it but you can
[1:17:02] bear it and that's what she bears that
[1:17:04] wolf
[1:17:05] because that's what it's born to do
[1:17:08] we are born to follow him we are born to
[1:17:10] bear wolf
[1:17:12] we are born to follow christ we are born
[1:17:14] to be led
[1:17:16] and to be led by god the good shepherd
[1:17:19] amen the good shepherd luke chapter 22
[1:17:23] verse 39 we'll start with
[1:17:28] 22 39 and he came out and went as he
[1:17:31] want to the mount of olives and his
[1:17:33] disciples also followed him and when he
[1:17:35] was at the place he said unto them pray
[1:17:38] that ye enter not into temptation
[1:17:41] and as he was withdrawn from them about
[1:17:43] a stone's cast and kneeled down and
[1:17:45] prayed saying father
[1:17:47] if thou be willing now look this is of
[1:17:50] course we know very familiar jesus
[1:17:52] himself
[1:17:54] jesus himself
[1:17:56] desiring
[1:17:58] in his own will
[1:18:00] that the cup that he was about to face
[1:18:03] that he wouldn't have to face it
[1:18:06] i don't want to have to do this
[1:18:09] i don't want to have to go through this
[1:18:11] i'm paraphrasing of course
[1:18:14] but as jesus was here and the flesh as a
[1:18:17] kinsmen redeemer to us
[1:18:19] even as the good shepherd became a sheep
[1:18:23] to be led
[1:18:25] amen to be led as a father
[1:18:28] in that position as a as a kinsmen
[1:18:31] redeemer he couldn't have been a kinsmen
[1:18:32] redeemer unless he became a sheep
[1:18:34] himself in a flesh body to be led by the
[1:18:37] spirit of god by the father that would
[1:18:40] lead him
[1:18:41] even in his flesh
[1:18:44] even in his flesh wanted to have
[1:18:46] something different happen outside of
[1:18:48] what the will of god was
[1:18:51] he said
[1:18:52] father if thou be willing remove this
[1:18:56] comfort from me
[1:18:57] he didn't want to have to do it
[1:18:59] he wanted his own will to happen
[1:19:03] even even in james it said
[1:19:06] if it were up to god up to the will of
[1:19:09] god if it were
[1:19:10] if it were up to what he desired we'll
[1:19:14] say of
[1:19:15] coupled with our desire that no flesh
[1:19:18] would be
[1:19:20] lost and look here he says if thou be
[1:19:24] willing remove this cup
[1:19:26] i don't want to have to do this
[1:19:28] i don't want to have to go through this
[1:19:30] the agony that that the man part of
[1:19:33] jesus felt as he was realizing what he
[1:19:36] was about to go through
[1:19:38] realizing what was about to happen they
[1:19:40] said that the the roman crucifixion was
[1:19:43] to this day the most painful
[1:19:46] horrible
[1:19:48] uh
[1:19:48] uh humiliating death a person could
[1:19:52] experience
[1:19:53] was the crucifixion to this day science
[1:19:55] said that's the most cruel
[1:19:58] punishment
[1:19:59] death penalty that has ever been levied
[1:20:02] the most painful humiliating thing
[1:20:04] because see when they hung them up there
[1:20:06] they stripped them down naked yes they
[1:20:09] hung up there with not a stitch of
[1:20:10] clothes on them
[1:20:12] nailed them
[1:20:15] what they did
[1:20:17] and putting that board under their under
[1:20:19] their pelvis
[1:20:20] so that they
[1:20:22] they they could sit down a little bit
[1:20:24] just enough to keep them alive a little
[1:20:26] bit longer
[1:20:28] because if they just hung there they
[1:20:29] would exasperate so much their body
[1:20:32] would be in such pain that they would
[1:20:35] just go but they actually put a board
[1:20:37] under them or they could sit down for a
[1:20:40] little just kind of lean on it a little
[1:20:42] bit it actually that board seemed
[1:20:43] merciful it kept them alive longer so
[1:20:47] they could be in pain longer
[1:20:50] it was the most painful cruel death and
[1:20:53] jesus knew what he was about to go
[1:20:54] through
[1:20:55] and of course could you imagine
[1:20:58] i would have asked god please don't make
[1:21:00] me have to go through this
[1:21:02] don't make me have to endure this
[1:21:04] and so many times we think the things in
[1:21:06] life would think oh god's just people
[1:21:09] i've heard people say how cruel god is
[1:21:12] to allow this little thing to happen i'm
[1:21:14] like my mind could you just imagine this
[1:21:17] little this little blip in your life
[1:21:19] that you're going through
[1:21:20] and you want to blame god for that and
[1:21:22] everything he did to save you and to
[1:21:25] bring you life
[1:21:26] and we want to complain about a little
[1:21:28] trial
[1:21:29] a little blip in our lives
[1:21:31] oh god help me
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:34] i
[1:21:36] forgive me lord of my unbelief
[1:21:40] but the flesh of jesus even desired if
[1:21:43] you would be willing remove it from me
[1:21:46] remove it from me
[1:21:48] nevertheless
[1:21:50] not my will
[1:21:52] but thine be done
[1:21:54] that was the flesh part of jesus
[1:21:57] crying out to his to the fathers god
[1:22:00] father for uh uh take this from me
[1:22:04] but if i have to go through this
[1:22:07] let it be your will
[1:22:09] whatever your will is lord whatever your
[1:22:12] i know people that they don't even like
[1:22:13] praying for god's will because they're
[1:22:15] they're afraid what might happen to them
[1:22:18] seriously people that will they're
[1:22:20] afraid to pray for god's will because
[1:22:22] they're afraid of what it might bring in
[1:22:24] their life they're afraid of what god
[1:22:26] might do
[1:22:28] oh my friend when god gave us romans 8
[1:22:31] 28 it wasn't just for us to uh
[1:22:34] have a picnic with that that was
[1:22:37] that was god's word to help us
[1:22:38] understand that he's making everything
[1:22:41] whatever it is work for our good amount
[1:22:44] and he still does
[1:22:45] he will
[1:22:47] and this life is just a vapor anyway
[1:22:49] we're looking we're looking for a
[1:22:51] greater reward
[1:22:53] when we leave this place
[1:22:55] this is not up tops
[1:22:56] it's not what we want
[1:22:59] it's what he wants
[1:23:00] you ever made plans and god stopped them
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:05] absolutely
[1:23:06] i i remember
[1:23:08] that time i went to go uh pray for
[1:23:11] sister heather carpenter and go be with
[1:23:13] the family ron and carol and family
[1:23:16] i i i woke up that morning and i looked
[1:23:19] at the scene i left my hands and said
[1:23:21] god what can i do for you today
[1:23:23] and i got up and i think i made coffee
[1:23:25] or something and prayed and my you know
[1:23:27] my day
[1:23:28] and i got in the car because i was
[1:23:30] driving at the time i got in the car and
[1:23:31] i went down the road and i got about two
[1:23:34] miles down the road
[1:23:35] and god said go to phoenix
[1:23:39] i said
[1:23:41] i gotta work today lord
[1:23:44] things were very very tight
[1:23:47] uh i i can't give up a day's pay
[1:23:50] i gotta work
[1:23:52] he didn't i don't think he said anything
[1:23:54] else but i knew in my heart i had to go
[1:23:56] so i just turned the car around and go
[1:23:58] back got cheese the whole day two days
[1:24:00] actually
[1:24:01] amen two days as god's gone up there for
[1:24:03] two days spent the night up there
[1:24:06] god bless it amen
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:09] praise the lord did we miss a meal
[1:24:12] did we miss rent
[1:24:14] god took care of us
[1:24:16] amen two days pain loss god takes care
[1:24:19] of it
[1:24:20] always does
[1:24:22] you can't out-give god
[1:24:26] my daddy always said he is shoveled
[1:24:28] bigger than mine
[1:24:30] amen i dig a little light shovel to him
[1:24:33] and he takes a big old backhoe and
[1:24:36] a bulldozer and shoves it my way
[1:24:39] god takes care of us yes amen because we
[1:24:42] live for him we serve him it's his will
[1:24:46] that we do not ours
[1:24:47] that's that's the whole point i want to
[1:24:49] try to get across more than anything
[1:24:50] because friend there's that spirit out
[1:24:52] there in the world today that it's the
[1:24:54] me first attitude it's the me only
[1:24:56] attitude is the attitude that'll cut you
[1:24:59] off in traffic it's the attitude that
[1:25:01] won't stop at a red light is the
[1:25:03] attitude that puts their lives and their
[1:25:05] families above any and everybody else's
[1:25:08] it's the same attitude
[1:25:10] and and like i said i've heard preachers
[1:25:14] propagate this to a point not message
[1:25:16] but you know
[1:25:17] uh worldly nominal preachers oh you are
[1:25:21] your own god
[1:25:23] people
[1:25:24] who have influence over
[1:25:27] who call themselves christians and have
[1:25:29] influence over large amounts of people
[1:25:32] i could call names but i'm gonna i'm not
[1:25:34] going to as it's out in the world i'm
[1:25:37] not talking about the message
[1:25:38] just out in the world they say they're
[1:25:40] christians claim to be christians have
[1:25:42] influence over millions of people
[1:25:44] probably
[1:25:46] and try to propagate propagate to those
[1:25:48] people you're your own god
[1:25:52] you call the show you live how you want
[1:25:54] now
[1:25:56] i i can see them to that point
[1:25:59] to the part that god put the word in the
[1:26:01] bride and the bride will have thus saith
[1:26:04] the lord or she'll keep still
[1:26:06] but if she has thus saith the lord
[1:26:08] she'll speak
[1:26:09] and if she speaks it will happen amen
[1:26:12] praise the lord but that's working and
[1:26:14] operating underneath the auspice of
[1:26:17] of christ the savior the good shepherd
[1:26:19] not on my will
[1:26:21] brother branham wasn't sitting in the
[1:26:22] woods and said you know what i'm just
[1:26:25] going to speak squirrels today
[1:26:27] you know my faith is so strong and so
[1:26:29] big and and i i just i you know i gotta
[1:26:32] have a great testimony at church next
[1:26:34] week i'm going to tell them what a great
[1:26:36] prophet i am
[1:26:37] i'm going to go down speak some
[1:26:38] squirrels
[1:26:40] squirrel be here
[1:26:41] he didn't do that
[1:26:43] that's not how it works
[1:26:45] he was just there hunting getting along
[1:26:47] with the lord
[1:26:48] and god spoke to him what are you here
[1:26:51] for
[1:26:52] amen
[1:26:53] you know the rest of the story
[1:26:56] that's how it works it doesn't work
[1:26:58] based on what i want to do what my will
[1:27:00] or it's what i want to say
[1:27:02] or for
[1:27:03] popularity or filthy lucra or something
[1:27:07] do we do what we do because
[1:27:10] he's leading us
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:14] not my will
[1:27:16] but thine be done
[1:27:18] and there appeared an angel unto him
[1:27:20] from heaven strengthening him and being
[1:27:22] in an agony he prayed more earnestly as
[1:27:25] his sweat was as it were the great drops
[1:27:27] of blood falling down to the ground he
[1:27:29] when he rose from prayer he come to his
[1:27:31] disciples he found them sleeping for
[1:27:33] sorrow
[1:27:34] and he said unto them why sleep he rise
[1:27:37] and pray unless you enter into
[1:27:38] temptation
[1:27:39] amen he had in him in him all in his own
[1:27:42] self
[1:27:43] he wanted he had to die to his own will
[1:27:47] to his own flesh
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:54] we are born
[1:27:56] let's go to another scripture saint john
[1:27:58] chapter 10. we're born
[1:28:01] as humans inherently
[1:28:03] we're it is inherent in a human
[1:28:08] to desire to be
[1:28:09] led by a force greater than us
[1:28:13] and that's why you see
[1:28:16] uh
[1:28:17] politicians the way they are
[1:28:21] they
[1:28:22] people look to find somebody
[1:28:25] that they can follow that that is
[1:28:27] greater than them
[1:28:28] a lot of times that
[1:28:30] greatness today comes
[1:28:32] whether a person has money or not
[1:28:35] in the world today that's that's the
[1:28:37] statute people
[1:28:39] built upon
[1:28:40] if they have a lot of money if they're
[1:28:42] rich
[1:28:44] you think
[1:28:45] the money is what makes the rules
[1:28:47] a person who's rich can call their own
[1:28:49] shots to do what they want to do and
[1:28:51] people
[1:28:52] blindly sometimes follow that but that's
[1:28:56] not what
[1:28:58] draws a child of god
[1:29:01] but it just shows the
[1:29:04] the nature of a person
[1:29:06] of a human to desire to follow something
[1:29:09] that's greater than them just like the
[1:29:11] ones that brother random that they were
[1:29:12] praying there
[1:29:14] to follow someone something that was
[1:29:16] that's greater than them it's inherent
[1:29:18] in each one of us now saint john chapter
[1:29:20] 10
[1:29:22] verse 7.
[1:29:27] amen
[1:29:32] let me read this quote before i read
[1:29:34] that scripture
[1:29:36] it's in christ revealed in his word
[1:29:38] brother ram tells this story a couple of
[1:29:39] times but uh this is my favorite christ
[1:29:42] revealed in his own word he said
[1:29:44] uh i said you pray wrong
[1:29:48] we should never pray to change god's
[1:29:51] mind we should pray to change our mind
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] we should pray to change our mind god's
[1:29:59] mind don't need any changing
[1:30:01] see that's right i said now
[1:30:04] uh what do you pray for he said i know a
[1:30:07] young catholic boy one time
[1:30:10] he had a prayer book saying some prayers
[1:30:12] out of the prayer book for his mother to
[1:30:14] live and she died
[1:30:16] he throw the prayer book in the fire he
[1:30:18] said well see brother brahman says i
[1:30:20] don't go for the prayer book anyhow
[1:30:23] but he said you take the wrong attitude
[1:30:26] you're trying to tell god what to do
[1:30:30] prayers should be lord change me to fit
[1:30:33] your word
[1:30:34] not change uh uh let me change your mind
[1:30:38] but you change my mind
[1:30:41] that should be our prayer
[1:30:44] let your that my will become what your
[1:30:47] will is
[1:30:48] whatever you would will for me that's
[1:30:51] what i want to do that's who i want to
[1:30:53] be that's how i want to pray
[1:30:56] don't pray god give me this god give me
[1:30:59] that go god go do here go do there
[1:31:02] now we have petitions supplications we
[1:31:05] ask of the lord of course
[1:31:07] but it's an asking we're ask god lord
[1:31:10] if you would please we're trusting you
[1:31:12] and move on this situation
[1:31:15] amen touch these people heal this person
[1:31:18] do this miracle
[1:31:20] lord we're asking if you would and god
[1:31:23] so many times does for us
[1:31:25] so many miracles
[1:31:27] things that we can testify to
[1:31:31] now let me change your mind you change
[1:31:33] my mind see
[1:31:34] you change my mind to your will and your
[1:31:37] will is written here in this bible amen
[1:31:41] don't let me go till till you got my
[1:31:44] mind just set like yours and then when
[1:31:47] my mind is set like your mind then i'll
[1:31:49] believe every word that you wrote yes
[1:31:53] and that is what we follow praise god am
[1:31:56] i that is how we are led
[1:31:59] oh that
[1:32:00] those clothes aren't comfortable i want
[1:32:03] to wear what i want to wear you go right
[1:32:05] ahead
[1:32:06] you'll be walking all over the word of
[1:32:08] god and transgressing god's word to do
[1:32:10] it but you go right ahead you're free
[1:32:11] more ladies you can do what you want
[1:32:13] come on amen
[1:32:15] i've had people come even up to my wife
[1:32:18] years ago i don't know i don't think my
[1:32:19] wife but or my mother excuse me not my
[1:32:21] wife years ago so why don't you cut that
[1:32:24] stringy hair off
[1:32:26] family members
[1:32:28] family
[1:32:30] you know baptists and you know hair is
[1:32:32] probably shorter than mine but they come
[1:32:34] and say and i don't mean that as a
[1:32:38] cynical i'm not trying to be cynical
[1:32:40] about it this is the truth
[1:32:42] but why don't you just cut that string
[1:32:44] your hair off why you have that old long
[1:32:46] string you're here for isn't that hard
[1:32:47] to take care of
[1:32:49] that might be it's not about me
[1:32:52] that might be uncomfortable it's not
[1:32:54] about me
[1:32:56] it's not about my comfort it's not about
[1:32:58] what's easy or hard for me
[1:33:00] it's about my obedience to god and his
[1:33:02] word
[1:33:03] there's no wallet i'm not going to do
[1:33:04] that i don't want to wear them and then
[1:33:06] they make excuse in the word of god this
[1:33:09] is all well that's not what it says
[1:33:11] oh that's not what it means
[1:33:13] and who made you the arbiter of truth to
[1:33:16] tell me what the word means right
[1:33:20] amen see that's what we understand about
[1:33:23] the word of god and one reason just one
[1:33:27] of the things that brought us to
[1:33:28] understand this message
[1:33:31] jesus said if you don't believe me
[1:33:33] believe the works i do there testify who
[1:33:35] i am yes
[1:33:38] brother brown did the same thing
[1:33:40] if you don't believe me believe what
[1:33:42] god's doing in my life because it
[1:33:43] testifies who sent me yes why i'm here
[1:33:48] not getting one out of a thousand
[1:33:50] prophecies right that's not god that's
[1:33:52] right one out of a dozen's not right
[1:33:55] one out of two's not right right but
[1:33:58] every single time
[1:34:01] over a quarter of a million prophecies
[1:34:04] discernments and
[1:34:06] and things that god used brother branham
[1:34:08] to do and not one time ever
[1:34:11] was it wrong not one time
[1:34:14] and people call themselves prophets and
[1:34:16] they get one here and they get one there
[1:34:18] and you know well we'll just forget
[1:34:20] about the dozen over here that never
[1:34:21] happened but what about this one wow i
[1:34:24] was on the money with that one
[1:34:27] right
[1:34:27] well you have insider trader information
[1:34:31] i don't want to be single about that
[1:34:32] either friend but it just makes you
[1:34:34] wonder that's not god
[1:34:37] there might be some kind of an agabus
[1:34:39] kind of prophetic gift in someone's life
[1:34:41] but it becomes such a thing in people's
[1:34:44] lives that they it puffs them up
[1:34:47] look at me
[1:34:49] because i am this one and this one thing
[1:34:52] out of the thousand i said actually
[1:34:54] happened
[1:34:56] every single
[1:34:58] time amen that's when you know that's
[1:35:02] where the word and then that's what we
[1:35:03] say well that that's
[1:35:05] that's what i follow that's what i
[1:35:07] believe
[1:35:08] that's what i look to
[1:35:11] but the biggest reason
[1:35:13] is because this message
[1:35:15] came from this word
[1:35:17] that's what attracts me the most
[1:35:19] not the prophecy amen not the gifts the
[1:35:22] gifts
[1:35:23] the gifts and all those things we don't
[1:35:25] major on a minor we know that i don't
[1:35:28] major on almighty the gifts and all
[1:35:29] those things those are the discernments
[1:35:31] so we're fine those were wonderful that
[1:35:32] attracted people's attention they came
[1:35:34] in by the droves by the millions never a
[1:35:38] ministry like it at least not in this
[1:35:39] day since jesus christ
[1:35:42] but that's not why i do it i do it
[1:35:45] because he was on the word that's right
[1:35:47] amen if you want to get me to believe
[1:35:49] your prophecy then show me in the word
[1:35:52] where you stand that's why brother
[1:35:53] branham would take his bible and say i
[1:35:55] want one of you to come up here and
[1:35:56] stand here and show to me in here where
[1:35:59] i am wrong right right they couldn't do
[1:36:01] it
[1:36:03] because they knew where the man is the
[1:36:04] seventh grade education he'd go to
[1:36:06] another seminary
[1:36:07] he didn't learn this from some man that
[1:36:09] taught him god showed it to him and god
[1:36:11] does the same even though we followed
[1:36:13] and believed this message we follow it
[1:36:15] because of this word
[1:36:17] we follow it because god has revealed to
[1:36:19] us this word amen
[1:36:22] amen that's why we do it
[1:36:24] now people can say what they want about
[1:36:26] it but that is the that is the sheep
[1:36:29] god the shepherd leading the sheep
[1:36:32] it's this word
[1:36:33] and christ is the word amen praise the
[1:36:36] lord he leads us now saint john i think
[1:36:39] i had to turn saint john chapter 10
[1:36:43] uh verse 7
[1:36:45] then said jesus unto them again verily
[1:36:47] verily i say unto you i am the door of
[1:36:50] the sheep
[1:36:51] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:36:54] and robbers but the sheep did not hear
[1:36:57] them i am the door by me if any man
[1:37:00] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[1:37:03] in and out and find pasture praise the
[1:37:05] lord
[1:37:06] i'm the
[1:37:07] by me we enter in how do we enter in by
[1:37:10] the door who's the door christ
[1:37:14] that we find pastor same thing then
[1:37:18] psalm 23 the thief cometh not but to but
[1:37:21] for to steal and to kill and to destroy
[1:37:26] i have come that they might have life
[1:37:28] and then they might have it more
[1:37:29] abundantly i am the good shepherd
[1:37:32] the good shepherd giveth his life for
[1:37:35] the sheep listen now
[1:37:37] this goes back to our first quote but he
[1:37:39] that is in hireling
[1:37:41] and not the shepherd small s
[1:37:45] whose own the sheep are not
[1:37:48] see if the wolf coming and leave at the
[1:37:51] sheep and fleeteth and the wolf catches
[1:37:53] them and scatters the sheep that's not a
[1:37:56] shepherd right that's in hireling
[1:37:59] you have hirelings well over here
[1:38:01] brother brown call them goats
[1:38:03] but a hireling is not someone that cares
[1:38:06] for the sheep he cares for the money
[1:38:09] because he's getting paid
[1:38:10] somebody hired him to do this job those
[1:38:13] sheep aren't his they don't belong to
[1:38:15] him he's in a position that he's been
[1:38:18] hired to be put in and he does not care
[1:38:20] anything about the sheep so when the
[1:38:22] wolf comes he just darts away and leads
[1:38:27] amen when the wolf comes once he gets
[1:38:29] off the word
[1:38:31] it changes what brother adam said or he
[1:38:34] tries to interpret what the word says
[1:38:36] he leaves he runs because he's
[1:38:39] inherently he doesn't care about the
[1:38:42] sheep i've made this statement many
[1:38:45] times
[1:38:46] in my opinion and where i see this is
[1:38:48] the shepherd is the one that is to care
[1:38:50] for the spiritual welfare of those that
[1:38:53] uh that are under his care
[1:38:56] i i had dinner with brother dave fritz
[1:38:58] the other night and um he was in town
[1:39:00] and i was talking to him and i made that
[1:39:03] statement about spiritual welfare and he
[1:39:05] just said back in easter he said that's
[1:39:07] that's an outstanding statement i know
[1:39:09] he's heard me say it before but for some
[1:39:11] reason it stuck to him this time i said
[1:39:13] that's exactly right if he's god called
[1:39:17] if he's got anointed if he's holy ghost
[1:39:20] field and that's god's position in his
[1:39:22] life god is responsible to help that man
[1:39:26] bring the spiritual welfare of that
[1:39:28] church to the place that is supposed to
[1:39:29] be in him right
[1:39:31] and harlan doesn't care right
[1:39:35] he might can talk before people he might
[1:39:37] can spat off words he might memorize
[1:39:39] scripture and you might
[1:39:42] talk till he's blue in the face
[1:39:44] but that does not make him a god called
[1:39:46] anointed pastor right
[1:39:48] shepherd he's just a harley he's just
[1:39:51] someone that was put in a position
[1:39:53] and
[1:39:54] and don't care for the sheep
[1:39:57] obviously
[1:39:59] i don't say anybody in mind of course
[1:40:01] but that's just the truth you look at
[1:40:04] these denominational worlds out here
[1:40:05] today
[1:40:07] 12 million dollar mansions and stuff
[1:40:10] where are these people in in the
[1:40:11] conducting of the
[1:40:13] the shepherd value over the spiritual
[1:40:16] welfare of those people
[1:40:19] when you look at the congregation they
[1:40:20] look like the rest of the world and they
[1:40:22] call themselves christians
[1:40:25] amen
[1:40:26] how can you how can you even logically
[1:40:30] look like the rest of the world and
[1:40:32] still call yourself a christian
[1:40:35] when there's no differentiation between
[1:40:37] what you do
[1:40:39] where you go
[1:40:40] how you act how you speak how you live
[1:40:44] what you eat
[1:40:45] if there's no difference then how do you
[1:40:47] call yourself a cri then then the
[1:40:49] heathen's a christian
[1:40:51] just because they don't go to church on
[1:40:53] christmas and easter and
[1:40:54] and
[1:40:55] celebrate or worship to a song or
[1:40:57] something
[1:40:58] that makes them a christian
[1:41:01] a christian lives a life of a christian
[1:41:04] because that's pleasing to the lord
[1:41:08] it's pleasing to god
[1:41:11] it's what the lord leads us to do
[1:41:14] and that's why we do it
[1:41:16] higherly doesn't care
[1:41:19] a harlem not the shepherd who's on the
[1:41:22] sheep or not see if the wolf coming you
[1:41:24] leave it the sheep flee it wolf catches
[1:41:26] them and scatters the sheep
[1:41:28] the harling fleet because he is in
[1:41:31] hirling and carep not for the sheep he's
[1:41:33] just getting paid
[1:41:35] that's all he cares about
[1:41:37] i am the good shepherd
[1:41:39] and know my sheep and am known of mine
[1:41:44] as the father knoweth me even so no i
[1:41:46] the father and i laid down my life for
[1:41:49] the sheep and other sheep i have which
[1:41:51] are not of this fold of course he had
[1:41:54] gentiles like us
[1:41:55] amen that were of the of the jewish
[1:41:58] sheep where we're different foes amen
[1:42:01] we're we're a separation of a fold jesus
[1:42:04] said i come from the lost sheep of the
[1:42:05] house of israel amen he said here but i
[1:42:08] have other sheep in another fold
[1:42:10] amen thank god for that because we
[1:42:12] belong in that bowl
[1:42:15] i must bring and they hear my voice and
[1:42:18] they shall be one fold and one shepherd
[1:42:20] so there is a time that we all come
[1:42:23] together as as one together as
[1:42:26] jesus christ our lord and savior
[1:42:29] we realized it like brother green used
[1:42:31] to tell that rabbi he said you know
[1:42:33] rabbi when when the messiah comes you'll
[1:42:35] say it's his first coming i'll say it's
[1:42:37] a second
[1:42:39] we already know it they will know it and
[1:42:41] we become one fold
[1:42:44] praise the lord and one shepherd
[1:42:46] therefore doth my father love me because
[1:42:48] i laid down my life that i might take it
[1:42:50] again now if he if the father loves him
[1:42:52] because of laying down his life you
[1:42:54] think he loves us because we lay our
[1:42:56] life down
[1:42:58] we lay our lives down for one another we
[1:43:01] lay our lives down for one another we
[1:43:02] lay our lives down for him amen
[1:43:05] amen
[1:43:07] therefore does my father love me because
[1:43:09] i laid down my life that i might take it
[1:43:11] again no man taketh it from me but i lay
[1:43:14] it down of myself
[1:43:16] i have power to lay it down i have power
[1:43:19] to take it again
[1:43:20] this commandment have i received of my
[1:43:23] father
[1:43:24] amen and god has given that same power
[1:43:27] today today
[1:43:29] so many voices in the land
[1:43:33] but the sheep know his voice
[1:43:36] his sheep know his voice amen other
[1:43:39] sheepdog
[1:43:40] but his sheep know his voice yes
[1:43:43] and know that he laid his life down for
[1:43:45] us and there's so many voices today but
[1:43:48] there's only one voice of god
[1:43:51] and that voice speaks to you now it
[1:43:53] might speak to you a little differently
[1:43:54] than it speaks to me but it's the same
[1:43:56] shepherd am i right it's the same god
[1:43:59] it might show you different things that
[1:44:00] he shows me won't be unscriptural won't
[1:44:03] be sinful but it might be a different
[1:44:05] way that god communicates to you than he
[1:44:07] communicates with me
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:11] and we're all different that way because
[1:44:13] god knows us enough enough to know how
[1:44:16] to get to us and help us know that's god
[1:44:20] that's god doing that
[1:44:22] it doesn't have to be a
[1:44:24] tingle down your spine or the hair stand
[1:44:26] up on the back of your neck but you know
[1:44:28] when it's god speaking
[1:44:30] and when it's god speaking then you obey
[1:44:32] that because the sheep his sheep know
[1:44:36] his voice there's so many voices today
[1:44:39] god
[1:44:40] look satan has purposely i'm going to
[1:44:42] close here in just a minute
[1:44:44] satan has purposely
[1:44:47] made this world so chaotic and hectic
[1:44:51] to scramble everything and to make
[1:44:53] everything so uh
[1:44:57] confusing
[1:44:59] to try to disillusion you from from the
[1:45:02] real voice that we're supposed to hear
[1:45:05] from that real voice of god that we're
[1:45:07] supposed to listen to
[1:45:09] noise and voices coming from all over
[1:45:11] the place
[1:45:12] i mean
[1:45:15] there's people who
[1:45:16] you don't
[1:45:18] it doesn't seem like they could exist
[1:45:21] their heart would stop beating if they
[1:45:24] didn't have their earbuds stuck in their
[1:45:26] ear listening to music 24 7. yeah right
[1:45:30] some people have got to listen to a
[1:45:32] music or some noise whatever it is
[1:45:35] every single waking moment of their life
[1:45:38] yeah and i've seen those people it don't
[1:45:40] matter where they are what then i love
[1:45:41] music too i like listening to music but
[1:45:43] i enjoy my quiet time as much or more
[1:45:46] than the music times right and speaking
[1:45:49] to god and let god speak to me
[1:45:51] when i was running courier service in
[1:45:53] florida i'd play tapes and as i drove
[1:45:57] and it didn't happen as much when i was
[1:45:59] driving here i don't know if it was
[1:46:00] because i picked up people here when i
[1:46:02] was doing the uber stuff i was picking
[1:46:04] up people and it was different when i
[1:46:06] was running courier was just packages
[1:46:08] so it was never any other spirit or
[1:46:11] anything getting in my car it was just
[1:46:12] packages
[1:46:14] but it was real prevalent when i was
[1:46:15] there and i would listen to the
[1:46:17] listening messages
[1:46:18] and then all of a sudden it would just
[1:46:20] come over me i'd turn it off
[1:46:22] because i knew it was god there
[1:46:25] i i turn off even the message i turn it
[1:46:27] off and i rake everything off the
[1:46:29] passenger side
[1:46:31] door all right pass your seat
[1:46:33] have a seat lord let's talk
[1:46:36] amen that's how i approach it
[1:46:39] because and that's what that's how dear
[1:46:40] it was to me but some people you'd think
[1:46:43] their heart would quit beating if they
[1:46:44] didn't have those buds in their ear or
[1:46:46] something music something
[1:46:48] all the time
[1:46:49] and satan's made it that way satan has
[1:46:52] purposely caused it to be so chaotic and
[1:46:55] hectic in this world and you know it is
[1:46:57] and it's just gotten worse since i was
[1:46:59] uh since i've been born since i can
[1:47:01] remember it's just gotten worse
[1:47:03] yes
[1:47:04] and and it's getting worse especially as
[1:47:07] prices the stuff go up
[1:47:10] people's worry goes i got to work more i
[1:47:12] got to put more hours in uh wife's got
[1:47:14] to go to work whatever it is i got to
[1:47:16] make this make that and everything
[1:47:17] becomes so chaotic and
[1:47:20] everything gets so jumbled it's harder
[1:47:21] to hear the voice of god
[1:47:24] and he's trying to keep you from hearing
[1:47:26] the voice of god
[1:47:28] but his she
[1:47:31] we his sheep know his voice
[1:47:34] when he speaks we know it's him speaking
[1:47:36] and he's and it's
[1:47:38] and there's a reason for it
[1:47:40] because we follow him
[1:47:42] in humility not prideful humility
[1:47:48] pride says it's my way
[1:47:50] price says it's the way i want to do it
[1:47:52] oh i i know what's better here i i know
[1:47:55] what i should do over here let's just be
[1:47:57] led by god
[1:47:58] and we do that i i
[1:48:01] and in this congregation saints i
[1:48:04] believe we all do that and we ask for
[1:48:06] prayer too
[1:48:07] we ask the lord and for prayer from one
[1:48:10] another here when we have things like
[1:48:12] these situations that come up that we
[1:48:14] want to bring before the lord and keep
[1:48:16] those people or keep that situation
[1:48:18] before the lord and let the lord speak
[1:48:20] to us with it
[1:48:22] let him speak to us about it sometimes
[1:48:24] it's just a matter of him bringing it to
[1:48:25] pass amen lord
[1:48:29] touch and heal this person
[1:48:31] we god we know god hears our prayer
[1:48:33] because he kills that person i think
[1:48:35] brother sister julie's back with us
[1:48:36] today have been not feeling good
[1:48:39] amen but the lord touched her now she's
[1:48:41] here we've had prayer for it and god's
[1:48:43] mindfulness brought our prayers to pass
[1:48:45] by bringing to pass healing in her body
[1:48:47] sometimes he speaks to us
[1:48:50] and gives us direction on something and
[1:48:52] says go do this or go take this or go
[1:48:55] eat this or go lay your hand over here
[1:48:58] whatever it might be and then we try to
[1:49:00] we try to our best of our abilities not
[1:49:02] because we we think oh well you know
[1:49:07] i'm somebody no
[1:49:09] just what god leads you to do
[1:49:12] amen and then god and god will prove it
[1:49:14] because he'll he'll bring it to pass
[1:49:16] he'll let it happen
[1:49:18] in the humility
[1:49:20] amen in the humility now i'm going to
[1:49:22] read a scripture a lot of us don't want
[1:49:23] to hear
[1:49:25] amen but it's in romans chapter 8.
[1:49:31] we read over it a lot
[1:49:35] but a lot of times
[1:49:37] don't really realize what it's telling
[1:49:39] us
[1:49:39] romans 8 verse 33
[1:49:46] our humility will bring obedience
[1:49:50] amen
[1:49:52] i know
[1:49:53] i do not know better than he does i know
[1:49:57] amen even though sometimes i might act
[1:49:59] like it i don't know better than he does
[1:50:01] a lot
[1:50:03] first
[1:50:04] uh what did we say 33
[1:50:07] 33 who shall lay anything to the charge
[1:50:10] of god's elect it is god that justify it
[1:50:14] praise the lord
[1:50:15] who is he that condemneth
[1:50:17] it is christ that died gay rather that
[1:50:20] it is risen again who is even at the
[1:50:22] right hand of god who else who also make
[1:50:25] an intercession for us
[1:50:28] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:50:30] christ
[1:50:32] shall tribulation
[1:50:34] or distress or persecution or famine or
[1:50:38] nakedness or peril or sword you mean we
[1:50:40] might actually
[1:50:42] face all of these things in our lives
[1:50:44] yes
[1:50:46] we might
[1:50:47] we might face distress or persecution
[1:50:50] famine making his peril sword we might
[1:50:54] amen we might
[1:50:58] but look at the 36th verse
[1:51:00] as it is written for thy sake for his
[1:51:04] sake for the lord's sake we
[1:51:06] are killed
[1:51:08] all the day
[1:51:10] long
[1:51:11] we
[1:51:12] now
[1:51:14] it might not be a popular thing friend
[1:51:16] but we are killed all the day long
[1:51:21] for his sake
[1:51:23] that's following him
[1:51:26] that's being sheep of the good shepherd
[1:51:29] we are killed all the day long
[1:51:32] for him for his will we are accounted as
[1:51:36] sheep for the slaughter
[1:51:39] for our lives
[1:51:41] are laid down
[1:51:42] for our brothers our lives are laid down
[1:51:45] for him we are killed paul said i die
[1:51:48] daily
[1:51:49] we are killed all the day long for him
[1:51:51] for his will for his sake
[1:51:54] what does that mean that means my life
[1:51:56] is nothing
[1:51:58] my life to me is nothing it is only what
[1:52:00] he makes me it is only what he does for
[1:52:04] me through me it is only him
[1:52:07] which reiterates once again it's not
[1:52:09] about us
[1:52:11] this
[1:52:12] is not about us
[1:52:14] it's about him
[1:52:16] and our service to him yes amen let's
[1:52:19] stand if we could
[1:52:23] i had another scripture we'll pass on
[1:52:25] that
[1:52:32] sometimes it's easy to forget that
[1:52:35] especially with the spirit of the world
[1:52:36] the way it is today it's easy to predict
[1:52:39] that that it's not about us it's not
[1:52:41] it's not what is to be um based on my
[1:52:44] will of what i want or my comfort
[1:52:48] or like i said even my happiness
[1:52:51] god makes sure we're happy absolutely
[1:52:53] but it's not that i do things because i
[1:52:56] want to be happy i do things because he
[1:52:58] leads me to do them yes
[1:53:00] amen and if it makes me a little
[1:53:02] uncomfortable
[1:53:03] if it puts me in a place i don't want to
[1:53:05] go if it's a little more work for me or
[1:53:07] something
[1:53:08] whatever he wants for me that's what i
[1:53:10] want
[1:53:11] amen let's say the lord
[1:53:13] if i take a shortcut over here
[1:53:16] it's it's like sometimes me and brother
[1:53:18] roger will me and brother roger will go
[1:53:20] sometimes and we'll probably spend more
[1:53:22] time
[1:53:22] working on the job in our minds before
[1:53:25] we ever start doing anything
[1:53:28] because the job becomes less cumbersome
[1:53:31] and takes less time
[1:53:33] if we have everything laid out and
[1:53:35] knowing exactly what we're going to do
[1:53:36] before we put a wrench to anything
[1:53:38] screwdriver or whatever
[1:53:41] we we work it out in our minds first
[1:53:44] and of course especially what we do is
[1:53:46] pretty important because you get in
[1:53:47] trouble pretty quick but when you're
[1:53:49] cutting wall the holes in people's walls
[1:53:50] and stuff like this
[1:53:52] you want to make sure you know what
[1:53:53] you're doing and stuff's in the right
[1:53:55] place
[1:53:56] it's like the scripture says who who
[1:53:59] goes to war without first counting the
[1:54:01] cost right
[1:54:03] amen
[1:54:05] realize what you're doing
[1:54:09] and and sometimes because we're finite
[1:54:13] we'll say and he'll say something i'll
[1:54:15] say but you know what if we do this
[1:54:18] and he'll look and say
[1:54:20] yeah
[1:54:21] that would work better
[1:54:22] you know a different way of doing
[1:54:24] something a shortcut
[1:54:26] but you can't do that with god
[1:54:29] we try to do that probably with gods but
[1:54:31] god i i know a shortcut we can do it and
[1:54:34] get over here no no i don't know better
[1:54:37] than he does anybody i might have a
[1:54:40] little different idea of how to do
[1:54:41] something and
[1:54:43] or brother roger would and we'll do
[1:54:44] something a little different and a lot
[1:54:46] of times it turns out good
[1:54:48] uh but he not to him though
[1:54:52] there's no shortcut lord what you say
[1:54:56] it's perfect there's there's no shortcut
[1:54:58] there's no different way to do it you
[1:55:00] say well there's a different way well
[1:55:02] but that's not his way
[1:55:04] amen it's not his way oh there's
[1:55:06] different clothes you could wear sure
[1:55:08] but not his way
[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:11] praise the lord 493 listening this i
[1:55:14] didn't put it on the tablet saw my
[1:55:16] apologies but we know it very well
[1:55:17] anyway i want to live the way he wants
[1:55:19] me to live
[1:55:20] yes
[1:55:24] in the book here
[1:55:26] let's sing it to him worship a little
[1:55:28] bit before we go
[1:55:30] amen give him glory praise
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:55] i want to
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:25] until there's
[1:56:28] [Music]
[1:56:40] all i could
[1:56:49] i'm going to live
[1:56:51] the way
[1:56:53] jesus wants me to live
[1:56:57] i'm going to give
[1:57:01] until there's just no more to you
[1:57:06] i'm going to love
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:15] oh
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:24] amen praise the lord but you can't give
[1:57:27] more than you got
[1:57:29] but if it's more than you got god's not
[1:57:31] gonna ask for it
[1:57:32] amen he'll only ask for you from you
[1:57:35] what you can do
[1:57:37] and you know how many times
[1:57:39] has the lord asked us to do something
[1:57:41] that we just didn't think we could do
[1:57:42] but when he comes and gives us the
[1:57:44] strength
[1:57:45] we're able to do it
