can trust in him oh that's just his way of telling me he loves him he is [Music] [Music] and I will question trials that bring me to my knees that's just his way of telling me [Music] he loves me it's a love beyond all human understanding and I won't question trials that bring me to my knees that's his way of telling me he loves me amen thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God it's just his way he knows how much we know how much he loves us amen hallelujah [Music] I know the end of that verse I'm singing I don't know how many times but for some reason when I went to sing it just now the Lord changed it do I can trust in him I got halfway through the verse and I'm thinking what are you singing that's not the right words and the Lord said just keep singing it so I did amen I can trust in him amen I'm thankful to know he can trust in me yes but you know it's just his way of telling me he loves me that I trust him praise the Lord so if that seems strange to you wasn't me uh the words just came out and I'm saying that song a hundred times but I'm so thankful that we can trust in him amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm so thankful God is so good is he amen let's stand to our feet if we could amen go ahead and change the world the service open up our Bibles [Music] amen praise the Lord God is so mindful of us yes he loves us so much Saints it's something that the world just can't understand you know sometimes it's something that even Christians don't understand sometimes I don't understand it but I don't recall the Lord ever asking me if I understood it amen I don't recall him ever asking me do you understand this but he has asked me repeatedly do you believe this amen praise the Lord not to say yes Lord I do believe it thank you I do believe it amen and that's still the rallying cry today do we believe it do we have the faith to know and believe that what he's doing with our lives is for the best for us amen sometimes we create our own issues sometimes we create our own problems the lord always makes everything work out together for our good amen because we love him amen and that's just his way of telling me he loves me yes praise the Lord every day so let's turn in our Bibles now to First Peter chapter one amen I know some things were happening and I want you to know that the lord gave me this message when I was in North Carolina we went to a different Church a brother I'd never been to before went to hear a brother I'd heard before brother Mike actually Mike Holloway came and preached for us over on Cortaro we were over there black brother uh very I enjoyed precious brother he did the cover for my book for free uh precious brother a good Minister I enjoy his ministry very much I've been trying to get him out here ever since uh we keep talking about it but he had some heart problems lately and I thought he was going to have to have a a valve replacement but they wanted to cut him open instead of going through a vein to do it and he's like no and he found out somewhere he could change his diet and it would help him and so he went to basically I guess what you call a vegan diet and that's changed his heart that's gone back to the doctor and doctor said your heart's fine now and then he said and then he said well his heart's fine so he went back to kind of eating the way he was went back to the doctor doctor says come back so he's kind of committed himself to that diet that's keeping his heart in that condition so I say that because uh we kind of had some plans we hadn't put anything out but uh plans for him to come and he had this issue and so hopefully we're going to try and tell them look if you don't come this month or at least by April don't come till November uh I try to tell people that um people can do whatever they want and it falls within their schedule to do however they want but I remember the Tabernacle I had people coming from the Congo every year and they would come in July every year and it would come with a half a bottle of water the little Heights Sabino Canyon in July okay so I had to bring a whole case almost to make sure everybody had water but it was always in July everybody wanted I said why is everybody want to come in July to go hiking in the desert I don't know but um he's going to try to come uh but I went to this church to hear while I was sitting there I started reading the scripture and the Lord put this thought on my heart uh so I trust it's a blessing to you today First Peter chapter one we're going to read a few verses of scripture here but before we do let's just fire heads for word of Prayer Lord Jesus we're certainly grateful again Lord Of Your Grace your mercy your blessings your love all that you do for us every day Lord we're only standing here today because of you we are only drawing our next breath because of you our hearts only taking another beat because of you and Lord my thoughts and my thinking and my mental capacity everything that I can attain to everything that I could even try to claim to be or brag about Lord is nothing but you in my life and I'm thanking you for it we all thank you Father for those blessings that you give us every day we know Lord that your hand is Upon Our Lives and sometimes your hand um sometimes your hand is on our backs and sometimes it's on our posterior but Lord either way we're thankful for it wherever it is Lord whether we need some correction or whether we need a pat on the back or whether we need picking up or whether we need a trial or whatever we need Lord we need it because we know that you know that is best for us yes we trust in you Lord there's got to be a theme there there's got to be a reason why you change that verse for us here today I don't know uh but Lord we just want to let you know God in our hearts today we trust you we believe you and all that you do for us every day we thank you Lord for this word we thank you for this message thank you for a prophet Lord that lived a life to bring this word to us thank you Father for your only begotten son that was willing to go to Calvary give his life his blood Lord that we can have Redemption that we can have life life more abundantly that we can have the Holy Spirit that Lord we could uh be a new creature in you Lord in this word to be open to us to not be a dead letter but to be a word that is inspired a word that is revealed and alive to our hearts Lord let it be so again today speak to us from it Lord yes accomplish that that you send it forth for we rebuke every demonic spirit that will try to hit her hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and honor that is for all that is said and done here Lord and God we commit it to you thank you for those that have come Lord bless them exceedingly those who may be streaming bless them as well fathers we commit all things into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen First Peter chapter 1 to begin reading let's just start with verse one I was going to start a little later in here but let's just start with verse one got to reading it again this morning and I felt inspired so let's just uh Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ and the strangers scattered throughout pontus gate Glacier Cappadocia Asia and bit Nina Nia elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience's sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you oh praise God Amen who are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls you can be seated if you'd like this is amen an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and Faded not away has been reserved in heaven for you praise God that's probably a nice little uh cap on the end of our last 22 Services amen of a new beginning praise the Lord has been reserved in heaven for you but I want to go to the sixth verse uh I want to we want to concentrate now on kind of the uh the sixth and seventh verse wherein ye greatly Rejoice thank God Amen it's reserved in heaven for us why would we not rejoice we greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that is that perish it though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus Christ so I'm going to title this today the trials of our faith the trials of our faith as we read it here and how many of us know of course through the scripture that is it is it is expedient for us it has expounded us it has told us through the scripture of how important these things are to our lives but the the issue of faith is what had been mulling around in my heart and in my mind for for several weeks now to to speak on something of faith and I kind of had uh went back and something I'd spoke on before about continuing for the faith and we may yet at some point get to that again I'm not sure because it's still something that's in my mind but when I started reading this the Lord took the faith in a different direction uh as I said to you the other Wednesday night I was sitting in North Carolina at that church and was listening uh but when I sat there it didn't his message didn't Inspire this uh but it was the Lord the thing I did not tell you earlier is that after I read those scriptures and the Lord spoke to me through them about bringing this forth once I got back here that the brother spoke on on basically the same subject uh and he had no idea uh neither one of us had he died of course how could we the Lord just showed it to me when I was sitting there on the seat waiting for him to come out to preach and when he came out he actually read from first Peter but it was a different scripture but basically took the same line of thought amen it was it just spoke volumes to me that it was something that the Lord was speaking not just to me but to him as well it's something that we need to prepare ourselves for and understand we as Christians sometimes we think well God is so good yes he is but God is a just God and God is a righteous God and God is a faithful God and and in all these things that God is sometimes the uh the the the road isn't paved with a flowery bed of ease sometimes that road is a difficult Road sometimes that Road's a challenging Road sometimes that uh road is a trying road but as Peter tells us here the trial of our faith amen it's a trial of our faith that's where the Lord moved this over to in being a trial of our faith now we know what faith is faith is something that is of the Unseen that we just have faith to believe that something exists or that something is I have faith that when I get in my car and I crank it it's going to get me to where I want to go I have faith when I walk out the door and I flip the light switch the lights are going to go off I have faith that when I wake up in the morning my heart's still going to be beating and my brain's still going to be moving and my lungs are still going to be breathing I have faith every day to believe what we believe as we walk in this wall that the Lord's give us but there's a there's another step of faith that we reach that we believe and trust in the god fully trust in The God Who we have never seen except for one another that we've never seen that we in most of us at least have never audibly spoken with amen live to ear audibly I mean we speak to him all the time he speaks to us all the time but audibly lift the ear to to tickle the uh senses that can contacts our flesh our hearing amen our our speaking or seeing those things are denied but it was it's for the purpose that we have faith in who God is it's it's it's more than just a simple faith of trusting again like the light switch uh more than just a simple faith of a car or or your your door at home or something like that to uh a faith that that builds us let me ask you has anybody ever woke up in the morning and not expected the sun to rise or even give it a second thought anybody you ever wake up in the morning and say oh the sun's not gonna come up today anybody I don't know if there's anybody ever through the history of humanity this ever woke up and said all the sun's not gonna come up today no you know the sun's gonna come up why the world knows the sun's going to come up why unbelievers atheists agnostics people who worship all kinds of different gods they know the sun's gonna come up why because it's come up every single day of their life without fail without struggle without worry without calling for it it comes up every day most people probably all of us at least at some point or so many days in a year don't even give it a second thought that the sun came up today amen you know there'll be a day where the sun won't come up but every day we think about it that that it does it comes up and we don't even think about it right right it just does well that's just faith and God does the same thing at the Deep you get in the Lord and the more you trust the Lord and the more you become like him and the more he speaks to you and the more you become to know him and through his word it's just like the exercise of the sun coming up every day my god without fail has always been there for me without fail he has always blessed me he has always helped me he is always you say Well it may not have always been the way I expected it it may not have always been the way I wanted it but he always has that's why there's a test on that Faith there's got to be a trial of our faith now let's go back and look in the sixth verse see what it says here because this is one thing as I read this it struck me that kind of is blanketing the world today I mean literally blankening the world to people look at this wherein you greatly Rejoice amen yes we do because we know and we're thankful for that though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations why because of the trials of our faith amen this walk's not an easy walk and people look and say well why would God do that why would God allow that why would God see you believe in God and he took your firstborn there's a reason for that my faith kicks in and says God the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord right people say how can you how can you believe a god like that how can you trust a God Like That that's just one small instance in an entire lifetime of trusting God in everything I do yeah amen not to mention the fact and I honestly now don't get me wrong I I don't mean this in a bad way but anytime anymore I start hearing about children that are killed murdered died before the age of 12. I'm sorrowful in my heart but I start rejoicing honestly do you ask my wife she may have seen me in time uh when when we're talking about a little kid that's gotten killed or something and I said yes but they're with the Lord Jesus right that's right they're going to be there yeah yeah they may not be bride they may not be in that City amen they may not go into Rapture but they will be in heaven they will be granted eternal life I said then what better thing could you ask for he's gone it's horrible you think about the children if they die or sick or murdered whatever it might be but if they've not come to the age of accountability since they're going to be with God right that they're they are going to be granted lives then what you could you say oh I want him to grow up that's fine but what if they growed up to be ahead uh he's an unbeliever and you end up going to hell wasn't it better for them to have gone then yes amen well to me it is oh yeah yeah you know you think about those things that that molds over in my mind because of how important it is that we understand the end result is more important than what we're going through right now the end result of what see our son is with the Lord Jesus and and we will see him again that's the promise we know that yes amen I do I miss the pleasure of having him here with us absolutely but the Lord blessed us with two beautiful other children and now some beautiful grandchildren and and uh well I mean what else could the God's just been so good you still trust him but look at no time going through this trial is it pleasurable there aren't very many Smiles happening when you're in the middle of a heavy trial and what does it do hear what he says Peter says though ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptation if you look that word up look what heaven is heaviness is grief despair sorrow depression a heaviness is a type of depression that's a blanket that seems to be blanketing the world today amen I don't know how many trillions of dollars the the uh medicine companies make off of prescribing things for depression yeah yeah but it's it is it is an overwhelming uh all-consuming around the world Spirit that's consuming people and it happens it happens even to Christians heaviness though what it's called Speeders not talking to the world he's talking to the Christian heaviness depression sorrow grief amen that's a natural human emotion but with that grief comes faith amen because that's just the trial of our faith through manifold Temptation that's just manifold is various and numerous uh trials various trials numerous trials things that will test us things that will test our faith do you really believe what you say you believe see God knows because there's nothing he doesn't know but sometimes we may not know for sure we think we do sometimes but do we really and it only is exposed through the firing trials that God sends our way through the trials of our faith is this trial it's going through this trial is my faith gonna hold up through this trial this trial may be so uh Grievous that we feel like that our lives are going to be taken from us but is God testing us yes are we going to leave him are we going to trust him we all go through it every one of us amen some may be worse than others some may be not quite as bad some may be more numerous than others maybe some not so much but everybody's different but God's trying to bring all of us to the same place yeah amen the same place to believe in a Rapture a body change that's going to take us out of this place because that's the ultimate end of our faith right amen because once that's over what will be the need of Faith right when we get over there we're not going to need faith everything that faith is hoping for and believing for is going to be there yeah yeah praise God so the capping ending of our faith those trials are bringing us to that place every morning your tribe you don't know it we don't recognize it don't even give it a second thought most of the time or try it every morning as to whether the sun's going to come up or not because we don't know nobody knows for absolute positively that the sun's gonna come up in the morning nobody does scientists will tell you and scientifically prove it well there's probably a 99.9999999999 chance it's going to because it has for how many years now but there's no guarantee and there's no guarantee for any of us that the sun's going to come up for us tomorrow none of us are promised tomorrow but we are promised that by faith we can believe that whatever he's doing these trials are working to our faith to bring our faith to the place where we believe what do we need God do I really believe what I what I think I believe I believe it I'm telling you here I believe it and then when a trial hits how many people have you heard of that when they get a fiery trial when something comes in and it's a hard trial and and all of a sudden next thing you know off they go where are they they quit coming to church I don't know that they quit reading their Bibles they quit praying do they just quit God where do they go what happened just a trial that comes because God wants to know or you need to know actually you need to know where you are with God God is this is this trial that's so rough is it gonna be away from you or is it going to draw me closer to you like the song says that's right like the song says I won't question trials that bring me to my knees amen because in all my needs is where I find the Solace that I need and the faith that raises to meet that challenge to believe that God this is just this is just a bump of the road amen a bump in the road that's going to take me continue me down the correct path that I'm supposed to go for you when you go down the road or you go through your neighborhood when you come to a speed bump you don't stop turn around and go back out you just go over it amen it may be a low speed bump it may be a big speed bump but either way you go over it you just keep going amen I mean who in their right mind stops to the speed bump turns around and goes back home or goes back wherever they came from that doesn't make any sense but a lot of people do it when it comes to Christianity oh they believe God when everything's going great and this is you know everything's just wonderful and I'm in great health and everything's going fine and oh I'm just a great powerful I'm a Christian filled with faith and then that trial hits you know go golfing what's happening God's trying your faith yes are you who you say you are do you really believe what you say you believe are you going to continue to stand or are you going to leave are you continue to hold true to God and His words and the virtues of his word are you just gonna give up are you going to come to the speed bump turn around and go back keep going forward though it may cost me my life whatever am I going to keep going it's the trials of faith it brings a grief sure it does that's a natural human emotion of course it brings a grief it can bring a depression but that faith that faith that that trial has raised our faith up again you know brother Graham talked about faith having muscles yes right brother Madam said Faith had muscles and hair on his chest yeah yeah now I know how it works for some of you sisters but uh that's what he said so I'm just repeating what he said but you know what he says it's just something of strength faith has muscle Faith doesn't just lay down and give up Faith punches back and says I know that my redeemer liveth though the skin worms destroy my flesh I will stand and I will declare that he is my God Amen and I believe him regardless faith that's standing up that's trusting in God and anybody I know of has gone through anything worse than what job did but in the last in the worst part of his entire life and he lost everything he had he sits there on the ash pile of his own flesh and he said and his wife asked him why don't you just Curse God and die and you know that's a lot of what that's a lot of what some people do amen the trial comes hard and heavy God's trying to test them why is he doing it he's trying to get your faith strengthened so the next trial that's even harder you have the strength to Bear it and the next trial that's even harder you're able to Bear it yeah and then you start getting to the place that your faith raises up to where the Devil Comes God allowed it and you say Buddha and you just Crest that wave in every wave that comes along you don't care about their circumstances look like you don't care what anybody else's says you don't care what it looks like because your faith has crested that way amen it doesn't matter what the rest of the world says because God is your Redeemer God is your portion and when that Faith Rises up to that next level God just brings another trial hey it gets you back to the next level and that each trial that happens just brings us that much closer that much stronger Amen to where when it comes to the end of it you're just you're so built with faith muscles that would just lead this world just leave this planet amen but just have a a body change and God take us home yes it's trying us First Peter chapter four Peter chapter 4 verse 12. beloved think it not strange listen the way Peter puts it they can not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you why it's called a trial because it tries you but he says thinking not strange concerning that fiery trial which has tried you or we're just trying you or it is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you he says don't don't think it's strange that you're going through a trial there's nothing strange about a Christian going through a trial a trial is a normal part of a Christian's experience a trial is what strengthens us and brings us closer to God Amen a trial is supposed to disconnect us from all the other dependencies that we have in the world all the other things that we trust in and believe in and rely on it and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with a medicine or a doctor I'm not saying that but what I am saying is that our bottom line number one trial is that we believe and trust God Amen amen God Is detaching Us from all the dependency of everything else amen when all the other rest of the world the country at least is becoming more and more dependent on exterior uh uh gratification this bride is getting to the place that what she believes and is trusting and relying in it is Jesus Christ and Christ Alone amen nothing else no one else it's all in him amen amen if I don't get a social security check from the government don't matter to me God Will Supply money if I don't get one more aspirin or Advil doesn't matter to me God knows how to heal a headache right if I don't give one more doctor's appointment one more x-ray or one more test I don't care cause God knows how to take care of me ganji God's getting rid of all that external reliability that we have on everything else so that we trust in him right amen God is the one that's taking care of us not the world not the government don't think it's something strange that a trial has come in your life don't think it says something out of the ordinary it is not it's very ordinary for a child of God to go through many trials in their life again some are harder some not so much some may seem to go through harder trials some people may seem to take a trial harder than another person doesn't make that person an unbeliever that same person just continues to get back up and dust themselves off and say my God is the god and in him alone will I believe Amen period that's the end of it he is the one that takes care of us thinking not strange that the fiery trial just like that fiery trial just like the gold you are more precious than the gold that goes through fiery trials and the beatings and the and the removing of the draws out of that gold you are more important more valuable than that goal because that gold is going to perish but God is doing what he is doing for you so you don't perish so that we don't go to hell so that we don't lose our lives he's he's bringing us this place that we believe in him and him alone by faith so that we don't get destroyed with the devil in all of his uh his angels and is is minions we don't get destroyed with them God is sending that Faith fiery trial which drives us as though some same things happen unto you but Rejoice now I know that's hard i i people I've heard people get up and I've heard ministers even preached and said oh you should be happy I don't know anybody that's gone through a trial like that that was happy about it amen I don't know of anybody in the middle of a trial like that that I when when the Lord I'm sorry to keep going back to this but this is probably the hardest trial I've ever personally gone through in my life and and maybe probably my wife too but when our son passed away and people come up I said yeah praise God our son is dead do that you're unhappy and smiling we were Grievous we were sad we were depressed amen it hurts it wasn't pleasurable amen but God is the one that took care and of course over time you say do you get over it no you don't right 30 of nine years 30 no I forget forget my math over 30 years ago Mike is about to be 32 and 30 33. I always try to remember because Joel's nine and he was born on George's 25th birthday birthday so I have to remember 25 and 9. thank you there's math 34 34 years ago you don't get over it amen you don't get over it it's not something I I still don't smile and I'm happy about you about am I thankful that my son is with the Lord of course am I thankful we'll get to see him again absolutely am I thankful that that trial may be stronger with God am I thankful that that trial brought me closer to God am I thankful that trial brought me and my wife closer to God and closer together of course I am but there's nothing happy about it amen and I've had people say rejoice oh we Rejoice absolutely in the fact that we know that God is working everything together for our good right amen because we love him we love him if you don't love him now it doesn't work I've said this to you many times because it seems to me I see this happen repeatedly with Christians and people I've talked to and people that know and ministers I've heard preach you have to love God unconditionally or this does not work right if you don't love God unconditionally with his love not Ophelia love not not human love but God's unconditional gospel love if you don't love him unconditionally the contract is broken right there that it does not work right but if you love God with the same love that he loves you with man that's unconditional and you love him back that unconditional love this contract is is valid amen and he will make all things work together for you so when the trial comes you say Lord no matter I love you anyway when it gets hard and Grievous no matter Lord though these skin Norms destroy my flesh in his body I shall see God for I know my redeemer liveth amen and he gets harder and harder never than mine God will take care of it he always does he's making this work because somewhere somehow I need this my wife went through a lot of Trials when she was just a little girl from basically from birth yeah yeah but as hard as that was and as hard as her life basically was until she was 18. as hard as that was she's been able to bless so many people with her testimony and things that she's told people and how she's helped people when I first started preaching she got up everywhere I went and gave her testimony 10-15 minutes worth I talked to the pastor a little bit and they said oh my yeah that would really bless our and I can't tell you how many people come up to her and say how much that was a blessing to them how much that helped them and how much that meant to them see you never know even with what God has done in this it isn't always just for us now sometimes we go through things and yes the Lord brings it it is our benefit but the Lord uses it so that we can help others as well that we can be a blessing to other people and you say Lord do I have to suffer this so that I can help so and so would you do it Lord I don't deserve this trial no you don't but you're going to need it to help somebody else down the road are you willing to take it right how many is going to volunteer for that amen you don't have to raise your hand I'm being serious though how many of you would take that would willing to go through this hard trial just so you can help and influence somebody else in a good way in a positive way to help that person make would you be willing to do it well let me ask you a question are you a Christian okay did Jesus Christ who is the foundation of Christianity obviously to be Christ's life is to be a Christian when he died at Calvary was he a sinner had he done anything wrong had he made any mistakes did he deserve being whipped beat ridiculed and hung on a cross and die the most cruel death that humans ever died did he deserve it no why did he do it because it benefited you right yeah because it benefits us he did it because he loved us so much he was willing to go through that horrible death so that we could have Redemption so that we can have life so that he could come back and live in each and every one of us so that we so that he would not be alone remember we read the other day this is for himself that he would not be alone but we his bride would be there with him praise the Lord he deserve it it was no way that Jesus deserved beating like that and crucifying but he did it because he loved you now would you be willing to do that for somebody else right so that they were helped so that they are blessed so that they find Christ so that they make it to heaven that's a tough question for him but sometimes God tries Us in ways that are just unexplainable and we just and we may not realize it and honestly it doesn't matter because there's one thing that Faith does not do there's several things it doesn't do but but there's one major thing that Faith does not do it does not question right right your faith does not question now I'm not saying that you having questions sometimes Lord why me or why this or amen even brother Brown did that he admits saying Lord you know I mean could you imagine God his wife dying and then his daughter dying and brother random cries out to God and a black sheep comes and falls the prophet the prophet of God who was the example of of what this age this bride was to bring forth in this last day to to make a rapture through the word and what was sacrifice and given and he goes before God and God drops a black sheep how many of us would think oh well I must not be a Christian God's not listening to me God doesn't care about me I must have crossed that line no no he had not crossed that line Saints amen he had not but he learned a lesson yeah could have been possibly hardest trial of his life but he learned a lesson amen God called in something and from that day on he never made that same mistake again I've said many times that when I'm at a job or doing doing something I learn almost as much what not to do is what to do amen I I I do because when mistakes are made or you see somebody make a mistake or you make a mistake and you you think well I made that mistake that mistake won't happen again now some people are hard-headed and they do it again but I try not to I try you don't make the same mistake again because you learn from it you learn from your trials the Lord has Us in this fiery trial so that we learn amen that we grow look but rejoice in as much in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy amen are we going to trust him yes that's the number one question are we going to trust him let's go over to James I got a couple more scriptures I want to read are we going to give up are we going to walk away are we going to trust him amen look friends are we still in our human flesh then the trials aren't over right amen the trials are going to get dares I say more frequent and harder especially the closer we get to this end time and we are we are here we know that and everybody keeps talking about it here even people across the country and sometimes even people that don't claim to be Christian talk about how how bad it is and how close it must be to the end of course A lot of times people just use the word Armageddon or something because they just don't know any better which is I mean it will it then we'll get to that point but that's what they know but don't realize what it's going to take to put us in the position the shape spiritually by faith to be able to Crest each one of those ways when the Devil comes in like a standard God like a flood God raise the standard against them every week uh crashed each one of those waves as they come before us even how high or how more frequent they come we Crest every way because we rely on God yes God we trust in the Lord he helps us in every way James chapter 1 verse 1. James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greedy my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse Temptations now that doesn't mean that you have been tempted to the point that you fall to the Temptation it could but this means that the Temptation has befallen you understand it doesn't mean that you fell it just means that the Temptation is befallen you a Temptation has come on you not that you have quit and give up and have gone away and fall into that trial but it's befallen you you now are in the midst of a trial counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience amen now I got to be honest the lord gave me this because I don't like reading this scripture because for new minute that means more trials cause I know I need help with my patients amen I know I do I'm gonna buy the rest of yeah I got one or two knotted heads but I don't know about the rest of you but I mean I need more trial of my faith uh to to uh to bring patience because I I need more patience God help me to be more patient and and we say that God helping me more patient what does that mean more trials amen it's like I heard brother Mike I was listening to him like I said he preached along the same type of subject and you know he said each time the Lord sends sends a trial then you fail he sends it again you fail he sends it again you keep failing he sends it again amen I was thinking to myself it's like it's like coming you have a little patience in traffic which I do have very little patience in traffic I'm sorry just confessing my fault to you pray for me um but it's like coming to a stoplight you just can't wait for that light it's probably not more than 35 seconds but you just can't wait for that light to change and then you go flying and you think oh I failed that test you know what's going to happen the next life's gonna be red okay I'm gonna try you again just makes it you either get more angry and frustrated or you say Okay God I give up I'm just gonna go at whatever you're giving me and at that pace and it just is going to be what it is amen the next thing you know every light's green amen that's our hands you failed the test so the next flight's going to be read you fail that test next light's going to be red you fail that test guess what the next life is going to be red amen God's trying to teach us help us learn yeah yeah amen the trials of our patience of our faith is to work patience God help us but let but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen isn't that where every one of us are trying to get to the mature Christian and of course that's what the power means entire just means complete or mature it means you're wanting nothing you've grown up spiritually to the point that that you've reached an apex of uh of of a mature Christian when things come your way you don't get rattled yeah it may bring a manifold uh uh uh a heaviness a grievousness or something like that but you just you just brush it off and you just keep going I mean it just depends on what kind of Faith you have in the Lord is it going to be something that's going to drag you down or is it something you just say well Lord you know how many times have you gone through this how many times have I had to put up with this how many times has the Lord tempted me or tried me with this or allowed this to be tried in my life how many times and then what Lord what am I going how have I developed grown to the point that I've gotten to um a place of perfection which is mature anyway an entire complete wanting nothing amen wanting nothing God help us it's all to bring us to that point and there's none of us exempt from it do we like the flowery bed of eats absolutely do we enjoy the comfort and the flowing along and the going absolutely but that's exactly the time that Mama Eagle comes and peels out another layer of that rabbit skin and the next thing you know when that eaglet has gotten so comfortable in that nest and Mama's come along behind his back and ripped out some of that rabbit skin he sits back down he hits the thorn he's a oh no well that wasn't there before it's not fun but it's to get him to the place that he's not comfortable in that nest and he's ready to leave the nest and go out and live his own life amen God doesn't want us to get comfortable here amen he doesn't want us to get eased in Zion he doesn't want us to get to them they said when it comes to that time that we I don't want to go anywhere I enjoy it too much here my there's nothing about this place I desire amen about the world we'll just say Cosmos I enjoy my life I enjoy all of you and my church and my family and the blessings the Lord gives oh absolutely but this Cosmos this world the best thing that we can believe and know is that none of this Cosmos as we read the other a couple weeks ago is going to be a part of that world amen it will be done away with scripture Luke chapter 22. let's look uh I'm gonna close here in just a minute we'll start in our open get our community service here amen Luke chapter 22 verse 31. Luke 22 31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as weak they did the same thing with job you know what he does same thing about you amen Satan would desire to have you each and every one of you Satan would desire to have you this just happens to be a Biblical lesson that that God was speaking to Peter about that we can relate to Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat do you know what that word sift means sift means to try one's Faith to the point that you're going to want to quit Satan desires to have you to try you that he may try your faith to the point that you're going to want to quit now that's a pretty thin margin amen between getting to the point of willingly quitting or saying God though the skin worms destroyed though all is against me though I lose everything though everything is against me I'm still going to believe you I'm still going to love you and I'm still going to trust you but now look what Jesus told Peter that he may sift you as we or try your faith a Jeep but but what Jesus said oh but I'm not going to let him have you oh but I'm gonna keep this trial from coming your way Peter he didn't tell him that what did Jesus tell him he said but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fell not and when thou art converted strengthen the brothers and Jesus didn't say but Peter I'm not going to let this happen to you Peter I'm not going to let this come your way Peter I'm gonna stop the devil from allowing that to happen didn't say any of that he just said I pray for you for you yes that when he tries you now pardon me if I don't mean to be adding to the word but paraphrasing a little if you'd indulge me that when Satan does try you when Satan does get you to the point that he is shaking you so badly you're going to want to quit and give up and walk away I have prayed for you that you're saved will hold out amen amen praise the Lord that's your faith now let's start you knew Satan has desire to have you shift you as we but I prayed for you I know you have them praise the Lord that your faith will hold when you're in a rugged shaking that you're going to want to quit I pray for you that your faith will stand yes amen and that you will be able to hold out through whatever comes your way and the only thing that Satan that Jesus will allow that God allows to happen to us uh that that Satan brings to us God had to allow it yes amen if you're a child of God if your heads by God Amen the only way that Satan can get to you is if God lets down the Hedge and if God lets down the Hedge again there's there's a reason amen Lord the trials of our faith the fiery Trials of our faith but Jesus here I have prayed for you just put your name there amen I pray for you that your faith will hold out that you'll be able to stand the test that when it's all said and done and Satan has done everything he could to shake you to your very core that you'll stand up and say I know my redeemer am I amen my God is God yes praise the Lord one more it's First Corinthians First Corinthians 10 13. Amen in First Corinthians 10 13. there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man common to man nothing has happened that hasn't been common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ER able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it amen my tires on my car out there are P.S I would I don't know what they are actually but we'll just say PSL PSI 40 pounds per square inch 40. if I go and try to put 100 pounds per square inch in that tire you know what's going to happen it's gonna blow up but you know what I'm gonna do when I get to 40 I'm going to stop I'm not going to allow that tire get to the point that it's going to explode that it's going to blow up God knows every one of us and what we are made of he knows what every one of us can endure he knows what every one of us uh are are able to stand and he said that he would make a way of Escape that need that he may be able to bury God always makes a way praise the Lord in whatever way it is God makes that way and God does it it's all for that purpose amen amen he always has and he always will he makes the way of Escape he puts us in the place that we're able to bear it that we're able to withstand it that we're able to go through it by his grace praise the Lord a friend let's don't think it's strange it's not Grievous amen it hurts sometimes it's hard to go through sometimes yes we do get discouraged but it's always for a reason amen I've known several times I wouldn't necessarily identify them now and I think maybe in part why God took brother around him when he did people have a tendency to start relying on others and other things rather than him God if you're a child of God God's not going to allow anyone or anything take his place yes yes he's not going to allow it even if he has to remove that person from your life or remove that crutch or whatever it is from your life he'll do it so that you don't become more dependent on that or that person than him amen God is going to be first and we want him to be amen but as humans we can so easily slip into that mode because it's used the easy way it's like the little boy I preached on Mother's Day that time it's like a little boy who uh who is crying and scaring and uh scared because of the thunderstorm and all and the mother goes upstairs and says what's the matter son well I'm scared mom the the Thunder and the lightning is flashing and it's rumbling the house and she said but yeah uh son but you know we believe in God we trust in God he's going to take care of us he says I know that Mommy but sometimes I just need a god with skin on amen sometimes I just leave it God with someone and then a lot of times we fall into that because it's easier it's easier to believe in something that you can see tasteful small here that you can't see tastes a little smaller here it's just easier to believe that we all do that but God is going to remove and has removed everything that would hinder us in that capacity that we don't trust and believe in him first and foremost amen he is number one always will be if that trial has to bring us to that place that's what he'll do yes amen amen but praise the Lord through it all he'll still make all things work together for our good yes amen he knows best that's why I sang that song I like that song very much I don't sing it very often because I I don't I don't want to get to the place that we major upon the trial because that's a small little facet of our lives but it's an important one I haven't spoke on it a long time and I think maybe that's why the Lord wanted to bring that back because the topic the topic of Faith was on my heart strong and then the Lord bringing that to help us with whatever we're going through I don't know there's timing behind everything yes but as long as God's in control of it and I believe he is then it's all working according to his perfect plan and that's all I care about amen his perfect plan I don't know if it's something that helps you now maybe you're going through something maybe you're not I don't know some of you I do some of them uh I kind of mostly know but sometimes people are kind of private about those things they don't want to express them or or talk to anybody about that and and I respect the person in that capacity but you know there's something to be said for strength in numbers as well and when you got people praying for you you got people holding you up and bringing you before the Lord and giving words of encouragement or something it helps yes it helps it helps it helps bring us to the place that we can endure again it's like the moping Eagle you know when the eagle gets into his moping stage that eagle is done for if he doesn't have some of his buddies coming along and dropping him some food to help him eat that eat that food get your strength right amen I love you don't don't get down there to where you're not able to get back up you know and send something to help that person and bring them back to the strength that they're supposed to be in life and it helps all of us we all do yes amen especially me I was going to say even me but especially me amen it's it's a it's a trial it's difficult sometimes I don't I don't bear my burdens alone amen but every one of yours is mine every everyone here not just sitting here now but a part of this church your burdens are my burdens they all are and then and and my wife as well and it makes you huge again I've I've pinned roses on you before but it makes a huge difference when you sisters stay in such contact with each other and have this prayer group and and encourage one another and pray it it makes such a it makes I can't explain what a joy that is to me yes uh what a blessing it is to know that y'all do that and you did it without instruction from a pastor you just did it cause Jesus is in your heart and you love one another that's that's it but that's all it takes and then you see the results amen God's still working God's still moving still here working and moving in this congregation believe that yeah amen I do amen whatever he's got down the road whatever he's going to do tomorrow I don't know it's in his hands yes praise the Lord I'm thankful for that and then let's stand to our feet if we could as you know we usually uh sing a specific song or preparing our hearts and Minds for the communion here from the Lord's Supper but we probably all know it I think it's Psalm 15 of the book 16 excuse me cleanse me I like to see this before we enter into the Lord's Supper because you all know how very sacred time this is so the dentist mentioned it I find it odd as brother Dennis mentioned that people would be unwilling to take it I guess I can understand why I would want to I think change my life to the point that I felt like I was in the position to take it rather than not take it because Jesus said if you don't you have no part with me if you don't take the Lord's Supper I mean basically say you're not even a Christian you have no part with the Lord Jesus if you don't do it right so it is baffling sometimes but it's also a showdown that brother Brown called you know the last message he ever preached will say message she got up after Tucson Tabernacle will say message the communion message 12 12 65 was the last thing brother Adam spoke publicly like this that's recorded it was communion and that itself helps us to understand the importance of this and call it a showdown to where it brings us to the place in our lives that we we want to make sure that there's no impediments there's no struggle nothing in our heart that's against God or anyone else we don't want anything in our heart against anybody hearts and minds are clear to God to our fellow man to one another amen we have no animosity nothing that would cause anything other than edifying to be a blessing and a hope to someone else so we sing this song this is I've done this I think ever since I've pastored the first church ever pastored to sing this song to help us at least the first verse of it to help us as we go through this moment in time and search our hearts to make sure there's nothing there amen make sure there's nothing in our hearts towards God or anybody make it right if we can before the Lord and before we take this communion and so let's sing it search our hearts don't just sing it let's really search our hearts amen [Music] try me [Music] know my thoughts I pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in me from everything and said me one more time now yes sir [Music] oh God [Music] try me [Music] no no my I pray [Music] somewhere [Music] in me and please [Music] search US Lord Jesus show us reveal to us Lord if there is anything God anything in my heart anything in our lives that would be an impediment of some kind Lord of all Jesus thank you thank you Jesus [Music] do you want to read the communion First Corinthians chapter 11. in verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had something this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for either eateth and drinketh unworthily he Ed his judgment to him self not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come amen praise the Lord the Lord said that he blessed the bread and you bless the wine so we're going to do the same thing amends with you right now amen so let's just start our heads if we could Lord Jesus father this wine in these little cups father is nothing but a representation of your blood but Lord we take it in remembrance of you we know it's not your lips or blood we know this is not your literal body but we take it in remembrance of you father for the body that was broke and for the blood that was shed Lord we partake of this as we call Lord's Supper in remembrance of you and you gave it to us as an ordinance to do until you come to take us home so as we observe this today Father we pray that you blessed this bread that you bless this wine that you bless it to the nourishing and strengthening of our bodies we recognize Lord how your body was ripped and torn into pieces unrecognizable the flesh hanging off of your body and the blood flowing so thick flowing so uh so much down through the channels there God that Lord your body must have just become pale just no blood left how you and your physical capabilities was able to drag that cross up to a Gog off this hill Lord is just it's just un understandable by human but just believing by faith God as your body ripped to shreds and more blood in the drain that was still in your body God is is just unimaginable but you did it for us you did it for our Redemption you did it because you loved us nothing that you needed nothing that you learned nothing that you overcame or deserved nothing you earned Lord you did it because you loved us yes and Lord we take this today in remembrance of you because we love you and we thank you Lord for doing this for us father now again we pray that you bless this bread bless this one as we receive it unto ourselves now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord would take this bread baked by our precious sister Holy Ghost amen I've said so many times I appreciate her faith and the growth of our church for the bread the amount of bread that she makes for us amen amen I know we take this in fate and be believing and when his body was busted when it was broken amen he did it because he loved us [Music] amen I've watched I've tried to watch that movie The Passion before and I honestly I watched it one time with brother Joel Forney in the in the theater [Music] up in the mountains and I bought the video and to be honest with you I've never watched it again I'm still having the video sitting there sitting down to watch it one time and it got to the scorching part I turned it off and never turned it back on had to try to watch it again just couldn't do it it just just something about it I just I just couldn't watch it again I know he did it for us I know he did it because he loves us it's just it's just something that I just I couldn't overcome maybe you have and there's nothing wrong with that it just his body was busted so bad I believe it brother round was alive today he would have watched it and I believe he had made some of the same comments event because based on the description that I remember him telling that video probably comes the closest to what actually happened the glorified stuff you know only Hollywood stuff you know I'm thankful for that the Lord did this for us so I'm trying to think in my mind if we all could come up at one time maybe this side brothers and sisters can come line up over here maybe decide to come line up over here if we could all fit and we'd be good if we could do it all at once as uh his brother yeah go ahead and come on up just come around here as was mentioned I think brother Dennis mentioned his prayers there's healing in this cup thanks you have a need of something you may be sick in body or something yeah there's healing in here amen amen praise the Lord so take that in faith and believe and maybe sister Karen you just a little bit more of a Down Below the path [Music] hey foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] yes pictures oh that's wonderful things what he did for us is what he went through for us is our custom will have brother and sister Pat taking burn the bread for us I should not deserve it but it's his love that would just get just a little plan to see that look would change our lives so drastically so less self-centered means everything about Jesus love is for others Say Amen [Music] and as with goes with communion goes foot washing the second ordinance or two of the three so in Saint John Chapter 13 we read from the example that we get from the scripture that Jesus left with us Saint John 13 start with verse 2. and suffer being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judas's carry it Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to watch the disciples feet and to wipe them with the turtle towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord thus thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I watch thee not thou has no part with me so Jesus says that for the Lord's supper and foot washing Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my head and my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needed not saved to wash his feet but is clean every width and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am and if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet he also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you very rarely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is he that is sick greater than he that is sin if you do if you know these things happy arguing if and as we do the sisters will be here but watching and the brothers will be in the front room so we will reconvene back in here after the football field so God bless you foreign [Music] [Music]
