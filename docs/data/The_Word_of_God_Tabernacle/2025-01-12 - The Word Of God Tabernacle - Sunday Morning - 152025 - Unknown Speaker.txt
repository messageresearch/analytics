a week or so I guess boy it's getting here fast amen so it's what what's today the 12 so another week or two they'll be at the gym show show just pray the Lord would bless him and just Prosper him greatly um also please remember um uh sister Julie in prayer actually she did sent me a sent me a prayer request I just figured it'd be better just to read it a little easier that way uh she said she's praying the Lord give a miracle and let her Medicaid application be approved quickly she's not confessing but the hospital records have showed that she has a prolonged QT interval in her heart that isal abnormal like a okay so like longer than it should be all right right right okay well praise the Lord de prayer for that too um qt in in her heart know the Lord's great position just resting on that so we want to remember Sister Julie with all that she's dealing with of course going on she's getting better feeling better um the devil just keeps trying to battle her every inch of the way uh but please remember her in prayer as well the Lord would just bless and touch her amen so thankful thankful to be here thank the Lord for his grace and his Mercy you want have an unspoken request on your heart amen those things that we desire greatly in our hearts amen can we stand to our feet amen anyone have another spoken request for another minute if someone else yeah uh yes the 2 of this month I'll be seeing my orthopedic surgeon um I'm having obviously problems you see me limping with my right knee um possibly I might look into getting that replac I have my left knee replaced it was hard but now 15 16 years later I heard technology is greatly improved so um I can't be walking bone to bone you know yes we know God can do a miracle amen but it's all up to Him Praise the Lord amen praise the Lord just remember just remember all the fires of California people U have a lot of Sympathy for the people obviously there humans there are people with Souls like just like you and I do and um there could be some Believers there I don't know that's up to the Lord but the destruction is just devastating uh I'm not necessarily overly conc concerned with a movie star or a wrestler or a basketball person or I mean they're just people like the rest of us uh seems like that's all the country seems to care about they keep putting you know this movie stars house bur down okay that's fine but what about Joe Blow here what about Mary Sue or what about you know a lot of people are losing houses of course there's not too many there probably aren't too many Joe Blows that have uh $80 million mansions in pal Pacific Palisades but you understand what I'm saying uh uh they're all people we're all we're all they're all just people like the rest of usen they may have a little more money or status what I don't know but um it is very devastating what's going on there now so uh we know the situation in California we know California is under judgment and yes uh I don't know I told my wife yesterday um maybe the Lord's running out whoever he wants to run out of the state before he sinks it I don't know uh I heard I heard an interview of a movie star and he said I don't know maybe they're trying to clear out California and I got to thinking well maybe the Lord is trying to clear the people that he wants out of there out of there before he sinks it I don't know but it's gone under we know that we know it's under judgment we know that yes uh and it was the and the Judgment we talk about California a lot but the Judgment was specific to La yes remember that yes he the in in the Judgment it was thou called thyself after the city of the angels Los Angeles so specific there so just remember that too but my heart does go out for the people so uh let's please remember that as well brother Dennis would you take these needs yes sir Lord Jesus we come before you it with sincerity of heart knowing that you are living God living in our hearts and you are mindful of our needs father and I can truly worship you in spirit and truth yes Lord hallelujah a beautiful thing to join together Brethren of Life precious Faith giving you the praise honor and Glory that are worthy of father thank you Lord and Lord I heard your Prophet this week say that when uh a man has met God he will never be the same amen he'll either be worse or better in this time father as we see all these signs that possibly it won't be long that the dead in Christ will appear before us yes Lord Jesus and that you'll be taking your bride home in that Raptor in that meeting in the air and father it's time to search our hearts it begins with us Lord where do we really stand with God yes are we playing church are we just um coming to church and putting up a show for you know our hearts father God you know where we truly stand with you even now it's time to to repent and make things right with you when you truly living in our hearts it is easy to have the compassion for the lost to

you're dealing with hearts to show them this hours they repent or perish yes Lord oh Lord help us to be right in our soul lord I heard James I just read this morning that to keep our our lives unspotted with the world and John said if you love the world or the things that are in the world the love of God is not in you amen Lord take the world out of us yes God may we die daily like brother Brown said Paul said that he dies daily I got to die every hour I gotta get William brandom out of the way I got to get Dennis Katie out of the way oh Lord may your Holy Spirit work through us Lord to give us even the compassion to pray and to be concerned about our our loved ones that have needs our sister Julie father she's really been through a lot now she has been diagnosed with a a a condition

[Music] a amen amen hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen my my so true Saints we just think it's some great big complicated something but you know brother brandom said it's just a matter of just stepping from here to here amen from Mortal to immortality from my human body to my theophany amen stepping into that Dimension praise the Lord oh it's beautiful I have a good friend well he's passed on now but his sister passed away of cancer many years ago they took a picture while she was laying in the bed they developed the picture right up in front she's she's laying in the bed just just a shell I mean she's she goes and another picture right here of a of a beautiful young 20-year-old woman and it was her yes you look at the picture and see and see her setting there man kind of reminds me of that hooded that brother randam was talking about that woman hooded and nobody saw the hood but when they took the picture the picture captured amen and captured that hood on that woman made me think about that that theophany of that woman was right there amen just waiting amen just waiting for that for that body's life to give up and for it to enter into that theophany into eternity praise the lord it's just that simple Saints amen it's not like a rocket ship it's not like when you die your and just billions of miles out in this outer space somewhere no just will speed up they'll slow down amen we enter into that Dimension and together we'll ever be with the lord caught up in the air amen praise the Lord but what air amen people think it's up with the stars and the moon oh that's air but you know this that we're breathing right here is air too it just says we'll be caught up to meet him in the air praise the Lord amen just that simple praise the Lord but that simple and how great it is and what we're looking forward to and just about two minutes you're going to find out why it was on his heart to sing that song Let's stand if we could amen the Lord praise the Lord amen because last week this came on my heart Hebrews chapter 13 that's where I'm want to start reading Hebrews chapter 13 we're going to start with 13 we're going start with eight Chapter 13 Verse 8 and I have spoke on this a couple of times before and I wrestled with this all week at work a different when it came to my mind Lord should I go here because I had something else I was going to start on again I just felt compelled to go this way amen Matthew 138w excuse me I'm sorry Hebrews 138 Hebrews 138 amen I've got a scripture uh that I had had on my heart that was in Matthew so um but it's Hebrews 138 amen before we start reading loc we just bow our heads for another word of prayer father God we're so very thankful again Lord at this time of this place thank you so much of your blessings and your love that you give to us father Lord we are a needy people and we need you now more than ever yes Lord we know that in ourselves we are nothing father but trusting fully completely in you Lord in your divine nature in your life and our life and everything that we do to serve you to worship you to live for you Lord we thank you God for this word we thank you for a prophet we thank you Father to know in in our our hearts with the assurance that God we are not in a place that is our home we're not in a place that we are comfortable in Lord yes but we know that we are going to a place we know that there is a place prepared you said if you didn't you wouldn't have told us but you told us that you've gone to prepare a place Lord and that place we look forward to God at any moment in any time any moment we're looking for our loved ones to begin to appear before us Lord and won't be a minimum 30 days we'll be gone home to be with you yes Lord and we know God that as you call us home father at that time lord it'll be a great time for your bride but what a horrible time it'll be for the unbeliever the make believer God those that'll be left behind but Lord we're so thankful God that you've give us that precious promise that where you are there we will be Lord I pray that God you bless remain part of this service have your your way in it speak through these lips and on our ears we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done here today we ask it and give it you all the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord I'm going to read one verse I'll let you be seated so we'll go down uh we'll go ahead and go is uh Hebrews chapter 13 amen we'll go ahead uh go ahead and go down to uh the 14th uh 14th verse because that's where I want to draw my text for here here we have uh for here have we no continuing City but we seek one to come amen amen you could be seated that is my topic today it may have been a little more than two minutes but maybe now you know maybe M can now knows why the Lord put that on his heart this morning amen because even as late as this morning uh I wasn't sure this was the way to go this was what the Lord wanted and more I prayed about it the more I looked at it the more I felt led to do it so then when Micah sang that song as much as the power of the Lord I felt today that just solidified it for me Saints amen you just I it's can't it's just hard for me to explain the feeling that I feel uh as a as your pastor p and uh ministering and for for that to come together like that amen it's just uh uh knowing that uh he could have sang it two weeks ago knowing that uh uh the Lord I I could have ignored that voice or whatever uh but and this was this thought came to me even before all the California fires and all that stuff that was going on uh but the truth of it is saying that we we here we have no continuing City amen here we have no continuing country here we have no continuing world we have no continuing Cosmos world Amen it will come to an end it will cease to exist at one point amen and what we live in now as bad as it is getting is is slowly starting to squeeze the bride out yes she's slowly start because we're not a part of this world yes amen you think the others would be squeezed out no no no uh we're being squeezed out because this is not our home it will be one day but it will only be after it has already been reconditioned and burned out all the sin even to the atmosphere is exploding so that it's fit for the bride to come back here and live on again it's only that time that it will be that we'll be in our uh glorified bodies in a condition to be able to live in a glorified place in a glorified state with the Lord Jesus so shall we ever be with the Lord amen Hebrews but I I do want to go back and read the rest of this though uh beginning with the eighth verse because of course we know we like U we brother Brandon Amed a lot on the eighth verse we do we trust this to be the truth amen I've talked to other so-called Christians not message Believers so so to speak but uh just other professing Christians and bring this you know Jesus Christ you same yesterday today and forever because people a lot of people in the Christian World want to talk about how things change and how you go with the changes and the new songs and the new music and the new preaching and the new uh uh translations of the Bible and the new things all the new stuff all the there just roll with the changes and you know but but uh my truth I came back to I said but the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same today as he was yesterday God doesn't change amen amen so if we change outside of the perspective of who God is then that change is not good change is inevitable in our lives obviously change is inevitable in the world it's going to continue to change things in our lives are going to continue to change conditions in our lives are going to continue to change we ourselves are continuing to change uh fortunately hopefully most of it for the better we want to change for the better in the in the like of getting closer to God becoming more like God that should be our change amen but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I had that uh Christian Pur said well that's just a an allegory or I forgot what he called it but he just push it off of something that wasn't wasn't uh by the letter strictly true I'm like well if God changes then what do we have to hold what do we have to Anchor ourselves in if God changes right if God changes then his word changes because he changes but God can't change even brother brandham brother Bram said later in his ministry some things he preached early on that God straightened him out on later in his life later in his ministry you go back that's why I tell you if you go listen to the uh all the messages of course but if you listen to some of the earlier ones and later uh brother Brandon might correct it and he doesn't come out and say that I used to preach it this way now I preach it this way the only time I ever heard him say that was when he was in reference to the seals he did say that I when I preached it wrong uh preached it before I preached it wrong he took it from larsson's notes and thought that sounded really good so that's what he preached on the seals he said he was going to preach it wrong again that time in 63 until the Holy Spirit came the angel of the Lord come and straighten him out on it right amen amen that one thing I know but see things are continually changing but God does not change God's word cannot change my opinions my feelings my thoughts the way I look at things it can change amen uh even from being a younger man to an older man a lot of my perspectives have changed amen but God doesn't change right uh the world changes uh people used to walk people used to ride horses people used to ride horse and buggy people used to have uh these uh motorized cars that went 6 M an hour uh now we got uh things that go I was watching a plane uh when I was working the other day I took a little break I was uh doing some stuff I was actually working but I had to put this stuff on these clamps that I put up to hold the pipes and uh I make them all up and put them in my pouch I was doing all that and I saw a plane it was look like it was going straight up in the air but it's actually going across the sky but when it's way off it looks I justess going straight up and I look and I thought well it's you know and I go and I work a little bit and I look up and that plane is almost past the building already I think that plane's probably going 600 miles an hour and that Pals in comparison to rockets that we've sent up into the air I don't even know how fast they go I mean I I mean however many miles an hour they go it's just it's just unbelievable what man has been able to create we've gone from horse and buggy to cars to planes to Rockets uh things can continue to evolve but God cannot and does not change right amen thus here in this life this Cosmos we have no continuing City amen but we seek one that is to come look we uh uh Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it is not an allegory it is not uh something that you make light of to say well that's just uh uh that's just something that's put in that that's that's God's word yeah amen he's the same now as he was 100 years ago thousand years ago 10 Generations ago uh 10 million years ago he's the same now amen amen into the eternities he's the same God now going into the eternities he's still the same God yes he does not change and if he doesn't change then his word doesn't change so we can depend on that word because it doesn't change amen be not carried about with divers that's various different kinds of and many manifold if you will and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace isn't that wonderful not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein we talked about that the other day amen what did Brother brandom say make sure your doctrine's right amen no just live a simple humble Christian life amen praise the Lord Doctrine is important to make sure you that you follow the scripture according to the truth of it of course but his acclamation to all of to live that simple humble Christian life amen the meats have that not profited have that have thrown many people off that occupy themselves therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat would serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp outside the camp amen amen we talked about going into the veil a few Services going Beyond the Veil into that place of the holies of holies the showbread the sh Glory the the the uh spirit and Truth amen this is done this purif ification done without the camp outside the camp for the benefit of the camp but without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate amen he was rejected despised and by man amen he came to his own and his own received him not praise the Lord but he suffered anyway for us let us go therefore uh go forth there For unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one that is to come friend we're in a dire need in this world today this world this Cosmos is about to yield itself over to a purification it's about to yield itself over to a Perfection it's about to yield itself over to the godliness that God had intended it to be when he created it to begin with when when he put Adam here and all the animals boty life animal life when God put it there and set it in the Perfection that it was friend let me tell you it's about to get back to that place again and we're in that season we're in that time we're in the time of the catching away coming of the Lord we're in the time of the body change we're in the season of a Rapture we're at a time where the bride is about to take a body change and go home to be with the Lord when Micah sang that song again it just they it it just so solidified and joy The Joy just came in my heart to realize the words of that song and how brother Terry tinwell was so inspired to sing that amen that any moment we'll see our loved ones appear before us those that have gone on before and I've got so many that I want to see all my natural immediate families gone yeah amen praise the Lord and I'm looking for every one of them to come amen and and appear before me I can't tell you how many times I sat and here uh and and pray and uh and and I open my eyes and just expect them to just be standing here right amen I guess it's probably different when you're in church and maybe at home or something but it's just different when I'm here amen and when I'm praying and I open my eyes I just I I think Lord just any moment they're going to appear and they're going to be here amen and I I just I could just feel them so close and brother Ram said they're only as far away as you put them amen but I've got so many that I'm looking forward to seeing one day but this world is about to give over to it amen the the the atmospheres are going to explode everything is going to take over this world is this country is uh is is done it's gone yes amen I looked up some some statistics I didn't really want to get into statistics today because I just wanted to be sort of an Evangelistic message but uh I looked up some statistics and found out that we are approximately $6 trillion in the whole now what that means is this country now we're 36 uh 36 yeah has anybody ever pulled up on your phone the national debt uh uh not calendar but counter yeah it's just it's just the $100,000 number is just flipping like this not the dollar not the cents the $100,000 mark on the counter is flipping like this the 100,000 the 10 thou it uh the million dollar is just turning over it it it's our debt is going that increasing that fast you know our debt has increased from from 1990 our debt was $3 trillion now our debt basically through 2004 is 3 almost $36 trillion we've gone $33 trillion more in debt since 1990 Amen in eight years I believe now it's it's gone back and forth a little bit but it's not going back and forth now especially after Co this country we just uh I I think that the inventors of the printing press were happy or maybe rolling over their graves I'm not sure and how much money this country was printing to pass out to people amen which is one of the things that people have traded themselves they traded as we talked about last week the peace the love and joy theyve traded hard work for a handout yeah amen just just printing money over and over we've gone 36 to 30 we gone 33 trillion doll now about eight years ago this country had got to the place that for the first time it crossed over to where our GDP or our gross domestic product is is is less than our debt right less now it's gone back and forth a couple of years since then but after Co it's just done this and right now we are I think it's five or six trillion dollar our debt is $6 trillion dollar more than our gross national product which means we could take every single penny that is collected in this country from every means and everybody for one whole year and we still couldn't pay off the national debt right we'd still be $6 trillion short if that's not bankrupt I don't know what is Right amen if that's not if that's not down the to tubes down the toilet I don't know what is I mean this country's finished and she's the best one out there I guess as far as that's concerned still amen but she's finished it's done I there's just no Redemption for it they keep talking about cutting down spending we now got somebody coming in a couple guys that's going to come in and they're going to cut the government waste uh in my opinion the government is a waste I think the about the only way anymore it seems like to cut the government waste is to cut the government uh it's just just seems like it's tall waste they spend tens of thousands of dollars to decide whether or not a shrimp uh is happier after having alcohol or not or or some kind of a mouse how how fast uh a a mouse or or or tree gender I forgot how much money this country spent on people trying to figure out tree genders is it a male is it a female is it something in between is it something we've never heard of thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of dollars been on crazy stuff yes but yet our we're $6 trillion doll in the hole as far as the the difference between our debt and our gross domestic product she's just it's just done it's finished amen they're they're talking about being able to balance the budget we don't need to balance the budget we need to cut the budget U it it just it's just to the place that it's just it's just done and it's not going to happen amen it doesn't matter what you do I mean there might be a few things they come up and they cut a couple things out and say well you know that's just silly that's just crazy and the Congress comes okay yeah we'll just cut that but there's so much of it that those crooked politicians are tied to it's just it's not going to make any difference amen it's not going to make any difference at all but this country's gone morals you can forget the morals we talked about that last week Amen to a certain degree morals are gone the morals of this country are just finished yes I you see the way people act and the way people talk the way people dress the way people live and the things that they do uh it it it's just it's to the point that it that the cosmos I'm not saying any particular human but the cosmos world order has become irredeemable it is not redeemable that's why God's going to destroy it that's why God's going to burn it over that's why God is going to uh uh send it uh uh uh in a fiery furnace and burn it all because it's got to be burned the only way to purify something is to burn it now what is the solution solution we have we know because we got we we have we no we have no continuing City here and remember everything pretty much everything that we talked about last week is leaning towards the prosperity of this nation and the goodness of this nation or the continuing of this nation amen the or or the world when they trade the peace and they trade the joy and they trade the longsuffering and the meekness and gentleness and all and Faith for and the joy the fruits of the spirit for all the other things to try to replace God they're they they're building their house on a sinking ship a sinking Sands you can't build your house on a sinking sand it will not hold yes when the real Trouble Comes when the real waves when the real uh tumultuous weather comes along it'll destroy it it cannot stand you cannot build your house on a sinking sand you can't build it on how good your job is or your income or your your finances or your portfolio or your uh assets you can't build it on that amen we take no it is sure we brought nothing into this world and it is absolutely sure you can n nothing out right amen I've made I've heard the statement many many years ago I've said it several times myself I've never seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul right amen why because they're not and even if they did all they could do is put it in that hole with that body right but that that stuff is not going with that person right amen absolutely all you take is what you send before you amen hence this scripture the one that I had on my heart Matthew um let's see here in in St Matthew the sixth verse amen therefore 25th verse I'm sorry uh let's see uh let's start with verse 19 let's start with verse 19 Le lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal amen that's the solution all that we have all that we take with us we send before us amen amen did we sin before for where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen amen that's where that's where our life is we store up Treasures in Heaven amen not here on Earth praise the Lord nothing wrong with having if the Lord were to t a a a retirement plan finances to be able to live on that kind of thing but not not accumulations of Huges amounts of wealth what's the point of that I I I was looking look got a picture the other day of uh and it's a message church it's just a very fine great big church nice huge platform and instruments and huge big pull pit and this and and the pictures and all it's just a just a hug huge beautiful big church and I start to think you know there's more of those in this message going up around the country around this country I know of now around the world I don't know but around this country I see this church and these people and then and everybody they seem like they want to get all this money and they want to build these nice big huge buildings and and all and I thought for how many years whenever the brandham Tabernacle was built God gave brother brandham that land god allowed him to lay that Cornerstone and that church got built amen they added to it a little bit but he did did he ever and he could have brother bam of any of them could have have taken the millions of dollars that was offered to him and gone off somewhere and but a huge piece of land bought him a big huge Place big huge to accommodate all the people that come in to to Jeffersonville big huge church and all the everything did he do it I remember one brother Ram sitting at his desk one time he talks tells the story he's sitting in his desk and story comes up about o Roberts and all this great the college and all this money and all these big huge fine churches and Billy Graham the different ones and ministers and you know they have all these all this huge finery and all these big churches and all this great stuff and brother Ram gets dis gets depressed he says Lord why can't I have something like that why have I been allotted to to those things God says step outside and brother random goes He steps and he goes out opens the door goes out side he says Now look up he said he looks up and he says all of that is yours amen you don't need all this other praise the Lord I I'm and I'm not criticizing the churches they do what they want that's fine amen they need a big church they have big congregation and whatever they do that's fine amen but you know brother Brown never did it right and if anybody brother bandam could have done it right brother brandham was offered enough money to to have done it how many times over yeah offered a million dollars offered a million and half dollars he could have taken $2.5 millionar in 1960 yeah you imagine what kind of thing he uh property he could have bought in church he could have built with that kind of money right but he didn't do it why I don't know maybe we can ask him one day but he could have but yet people set they set for the longest time with no air conditioning brother says hot everybody Fanning standing along the sides for hours standing along waiting three three and four and even a six-h hour message around the sides the walls and and and everywhere people standing sitting down there're standing outside sitting in their cars listening to it on the radio has anybody ever been there have you been to B Tabernacle and know how it's position where it's sitting right in that yeah I don't know how they ever got that many cars in that little bitty place it it is not a huge place the facility that we have here as far as the entire complex is twice the size of grand Tabernacle and the parking area I don't know how they got that many people there and that much parking how many cars cars had to be lined up down main streets down the streets everywhere around on the cemetery and all over the place place but he didn't do it why I don't know but God said look up that's your portion amen that's your inheritance praise the Lord look friend we're not looking to build some great something here we're not looking to be some name or some great celebrity or have some great huge amounts of wealth and all what we store up what we take with us is what we send send before us when you live your life for others you're star heaven in the face amen amen the World trades the things that they trade for the joy and peace and all but this now here there is no continuing City we Geto disappointed sometimes get depressed sometimes people get all involved in elections and things like that and I look at it I do I follow it I I absolutely but it's not my life yeah right amen uh it's just a portion of what goes on in this world yes I mean it can gauge what you think maybe the Lord has a little more grace for us yeah not I I I don't you know look at that but it it in the end it's all Canon father yes it's all coming to an end Swift end if you will yes amen and that's and this is where we said this is what it is this is what it means means to us now Hebrews chapter 11 amen I want to read a couple of scriptures here here we have no continuing cting amen amen if we have a KNE issue brother Dennis talked about amen he's going to the doctor and see him to have our operation amen I believe it could happen exactly like it did with with brother brandom and mey stand on your feet and speak before the doctor's hand can touch it it'll be gone and it was there the whole time up till they prepped her for the operation it was there yeah but when the doctor's hand went to go touch it and on that day he was gone yes amen the Lord healed her right there I believe same thing can happened brother Dennis yes amen it could even go to operation day amen and and the doctor take him into the room and he could walk into the room and say what doesn't hurt doc I don't think I need an operation amen well Dennis you know better than that you got to have the operation well no just go x-ray it again and see amen bone on bone go take the X-ray somehow some carets grew in your knee it's not bone on bone anymore amen same thing happened to my wife you all know the story about the tendon in her foot yeah amen doctor said I don't know what happened to you Miss Bennett but you have a brand new tendon in your foot amen amen he's still God yes he hasn't changed we just got to make sure we don't replace him with something else depend on this world we have no continuing City here our bodies this is just a house that we live in amen this is this was not meant to last forever right amen after the fall these these bodies that we live in were not meant to last forever amen the bodies that the worlds that these bodies build was not meant to last forever and it's not going to last forever that's why we we seek for a place that God has gone to prepare for us that's why we don't depend on this place that's why we don't get so comfortable in eased in Zion because this is not our home amen amen thank you Lord how many times did these things happen and all the burning going on and I sit and I think well this there's no continuing City this is there's no continuing country amen but we seek one that is to come yes amen amen Hebrews 11 let's start with verse 8 Hebrews 11:8 amen by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out listen not knowing whether he went God just said go and he went why did he go because he had trust and faith and confidence in the one that told him to go praise the Lord Abraham is the one that deemed him the almighty God yes and we follow that just as he did because we know today that he is still God and he is still the almighty God praise the Lord he didn't know where he went though I've never been there before praise God Amen that's why that song Amen oh I'm longing for it though I've never seen it been there I know it's there amen the Lord's given me glimpse of it he's G give me a little Snippets to know what it's like amen but in my heart it's longing to go to that place it's longing to go out of this Cosmos out of this world out of the corruption of this world Amen unless you spend and it was different for me but now especially uh I I I guess it depends on who you are what you do I was I would say I was a little more guarded uh when I worked with brother Roger and we did electric work we went to people's houses businesses and stuff like that but I worked with him a Believer a Christian a godly man I worked with him amen amen you don't realize and I guess you don't realize how bad things really are uh uh until you're in the middle of it and when God throws you in the middle of it you think my this is just a rotting cess of Filth humanity is just a rotting cess of Filth Humanity I remember going into my mom's uh place where she there it's the end of her life and Humanity please don't get me wrong but humanity is disgusting yeah the filth and nastiness of the human and the human body is disgusting it stinks it rots I go through the building and you can literally smell the rot of the humanity right but yet we think so much of this nasty thing amen and and not not that you shouldn't shower not that you shouldn't groom not that you shouldn't haircut or whatever me uh but this but it's we're just simply a rotting cess pool of Filth but the but in getting out more into the world world now with this job that I'm on now it's uh the the the immorality sin is it just slaps you right in the face and the thing that I guess for me that probably uh hits me the hardest is people don't seem to care yeah and the reason they don't seem to care is because they're in Leia they're poor miserable blind wretched naked and don't know it am they don't know it amen and if you don't know you're not going to care amen amen if you don't realize you're lost you're not going to try to be found right if you know if you don't know you're wrong you're not going to try to get right right right but when you know and when there's something in you that says this is not right you say God then show show me what is right because I Want to Be Right amen I don't want to be wrong yes I don't want to be in this place that's has no hope and no future and no continuing City I want to be in that one I want to look for that one I want to go to that one that Abraham was talking about here he went by faith not knowing where he went he went anyway by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked hallelujah what are we looking for today Saints oh it's so easy to fall into that I'm looking for my next paycheck I'm looking toward my next vacation I'm looking for nothing wrong with planning nothing wrong with making a living we should all do that amen we we are not it is a distress for a person to call themselves a Christian and look for a handout from the government and not work you've got the ability now and look look I I feel like I got to say this I don't want me I don't want myself to be misunderstood because we have several people in here under Social Security Social Security is not a handout you understand that the government wants to try to convince you now now that it's an entitlement it is not I think I've said this before a few weeks ago CU this just burns me I mean as much as anything the government this just burns me up especially the older I'm getting amen I've been giving the government thousands and thousands and thousands of my dollars over 40 years with the promise that they were going to give it back to me when I retire amen and they call that an entitlement that's not an entitlement that is you force me to give you my money for you to hold and give back to me when I need it amen that's what Social Security is supposed to be what do they do they take your money and they spend it on trying to find out what the gender of a tree is amen amen whether a rat can run faster on a conveyor when he's drunk or High I mean crazy stuff they take your money to do it and then they come around and say well now we don't have enough money to pay you all Social Security is going bankrupt bankrupt my foot it shouldn't be going bankrupt it's my money right that's what it's supposed to be so it's not an entitlement it it is not uh a gift a handout it is your money that they were supposed to be obligated to give back to you right and of course they never give it back to you based on the increment increase of what the inflation is going up amen they never do that so all the time you're you're you're going further and further in the hole but there's a lot of people out there who are able to work and can work and aren't to retirement age that just expect a handout from the government and they give it to them it's wrong I'm sorry that shouldn't happen right amen but we're living in a non-continuing city we are looking for a city we're looking not to our next paycheck not to our next car purchase whatever we are looking for a city which has foundations whose Builder and maker is God Amen praise the Lord notice it says whose foundations his Builder and maker is God we know that the Builder and maker of this world was God this Earth was God he made it amen he put the animals here he put the humans here he put the botney life here that was God but the foundation of this country of this world has eroded out it belongs to the devil now when Adam sold it out he sold out his inheritance and all he had to the devil amen he didn't so can't he couldn't lose the Book of Life he had cuz the devil couldn't take it brother bar said his nasty hands couldn't touch it so that went to the original owner God Amen but he took over this Cosmos this world now we're looking for a city whose foundations amen the the the foundation of the building is a rock not sand that rock is Christ we're looking for that Foundation whose Builder and maker is God that will stand the test of time and and all the corruption everything else that comes along amen he by he by faith went looking for that City amen we're lost this country is lost this world is lost amen people live with most people live with no no regard for tomorrow politicians will spend the money and people will just spend the money without regard of what the next generation's going to do or the Next Generation or the next you think in 1990 who was President in 1990 Bill Clinton I can't remember anyway in 1990 you think of 1990 that they thought in 2024 the debt would have grown by $33 trillion you think all through those years from that time till now that they would have had any concern of about what my life was going to be like or what debt my grandson and granddaughter were going to be saddled with don't matter they don't live that they there's no regard but praise the lord we are looking for a city whose Builder maker is God we're looking for a city that's Eternal amen does not falter does not fail perfect holy righteous let me read a couple of more verses of scripture here I'll will close in uh re in in Revelation we know it talks about the new city we went through the new city yes amen but um I'll skip that let's go to Second Peter second Peter chapter 3 verse1 now some people may look at this and think man that is such a dismal message couldn't you give a more encouraging message I can't think of any more encouraging message than the understanding that we're not dependent on this Cosmos World our faith and our trust is looking to a city whose Builder maker is God a thing that is not in that that we're dependent on here we're dependent on God and everything about God and going to a place that God has already prepared for us yes amen I don't know of any other more encouraging thing to say that's what that's what our whole future is about is living in a place that is not corrupt amen it is not sinful it is not uh a a r a rotting sesp of Fil A place that's perfect second Peter 3:1 this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that have that there shall come in the last days scoffers we talked about the last days last week this is any more last days amen this the last moment's last second scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation makes me think about those the the thing that that people will scoff against that will make fun of or just turn away from I've never had anybody let's just say as as much as uh some of the guys on the team can cuss or cuss BR drink and um I never they have never mocked or made fun of me or what I believe they've never put me down for it at least not to my face they've never put me down for it they've never ridiculed it or anything like that but yet they go on living their lives like uh that there's no regard for that I even T yesterday flying home we were at the airport and the guy I told you about Doug super guy I mean uh he's just a great do anything for you if I asked him to come do something for you at your house or in this church he'd do it without hesitation absolutely he said yeah what what do you need he would he's that kind of guy well I I got a cup of coffee at the airport and he's looking for a bar cuz he's got to have a drink and he gets a beer and and he gets in a little shot of something I don't know what it is and he drinks it all down and we finally walk over to the gate we get there a couple hours early finally go over walk over the gate and he said oh yeah there's there's this place here I said well you could have gone there instead he said no or in addition to I thought Doug you got to have another beard I said ' well depends on your money and your liver yeah and he said well the only thing I'm concerned about is the first part I said you don't care anything about your liver it's just the dollar that you care about it's not not even your liver oh my liver is fine really now he knows see he knows I told you before kind of has a Death Wish really um I mean if it if the job called for walking on a tight RPP he would do it even if 20 foot above the ground he'd probably do it he's just he does the sketchy stuff A lot of times now which is good because I used to do a lot of sketchy stuff uh one guy called me spider monkey one time but anyway he would he that's just what he do just no regard but I when he said that I'm thinking Doug really you you cared more about the dollar in your pocket than the Del in your body that keeps you alive but that's the mentality I think that's the mentality with a lot of people amen don't just there's no regard probably is her God and their God don't know not worried about it I'm just going to live my life it's that kind of thing you know let it be what it's going to be I go to hell I go to hell a lot of people say they think hell's going to be a lot more fun that's just the way the mentality of people that they think today amen and that's why they're like this scoffers well where is he you you people keep preaching and talking about it all this time you say you're a Christian you live like this won't even take a drink or something noen I think I told y'all one time uh we were in Salt Lake City and we had a day that we took they called team building and they were we were found a place they started throwing the hatchets you ever done that at a Target and all the guys were throwing in bang us falling off and I throw it I don't you know I've never done it before I just grabbed it and threw it and it's stuck right in the center and they're like man you can do anything and the and Brian the new manager R out said you anything but C like no I can I just choose not to I'm I'm smart enough not to use the six filthy words or the Dozen filthy I'm smart enough to use other words without having to use those words I didn't say that part anyway uh then they but is it was I didn't take it as a scoffing though but that's the way they think you know U there's nothing to that right let's continue on though for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same are kept in store preserved uh reserved unto fire against that day of judgment and predition of ungodly man look at what we're looking at friends we know California is going to sink but this nation's going to burn over border to border Coast to Coast amen we know that prophecy has already gone out is that's a good start I don't I don't know but uh but the bride's going to be gone by the time that in my opinion it's going to before that happens but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord is thousand years and thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and God I try to help keep that in my heart amen and and when and when I said what I said about the people in California that's exactly the attitude I want to have right amen I want every I wish every human drawing breath would come to Christ in Repentance amen I do but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pass pass away with a great noise the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works there The Works that are therein shall be burned up seeing that the all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved in the elements shall melt with fent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for H Allelujah amen we are looking for excuse me a new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you be that you may be found in of him in peace without spot and blameless amen praise the Lord and that's exactly the reason that Jesus Christ took our place at Calvary so he could take our place so that we could take his yes so that we could be without robed in his righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish amen that's that's the reason that he came to do that for us yes the reason we can take that position people think oh you go too far I think you know a lot of times we just don't go far enough in realizing who we are yes Jesus Christ God Of Heaven and Earth took my place so I could take his amen and be robed in his righteousness oh my that that is not conjecture that that is not uh uh uh an allegory that that is fact that is true that God desires for us to reach to Amen in all our Humanity praise in all our frailties amen God has us live to that place amen one more scripture as I'm going to close St John chapter 14 St John chapter 14 sometimes you may look and say well you how how can you bear to work with guys like that God gives me Grace God gave me the job I realized they're just people yes amen that's right they're just humans right they're hardly a place you can go today that people people aren't like that um and so you people are just people you you you are who you are and be who you are and they they are who they are and they're being who they are amen amen do I like it no I I wish they didn't but fortunately I believe all of them to be good men I don't believe them to be just reprobate they act like it sometimes I don't believe in their heart really to be right amen U but God just gives me Grace amen and it just I know who I am amen amen I don't have to worry about that I'm comfortable in my Christianity yes amen I'm I'm not worried about uh falling to that or starting to live like that or start I don't like it but I I'm that's not me that's not who I'm going to be I'm comfortable in who I am amen and I make no apolog apologies for it praise the Lord St John chapter 14 let's read these couple of verses here let not your heart be troubled amen praise the Lord best advice I can think of right ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again hallelujah amen he's coming back Saints we're going to go up we're going to speed up meet him in the air I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also praise the Lord here we have no continuing City but we seek one that is to come he is our portion yes praise the Lord amen amen and that's that's what we look to that's what we believe in that's who we trust in hallelujah amen let's stand if we could amen God has prepared the way for us he has made every possible provision that we could ever hope or need he's given us every bit of ammunition every bit of equipment he's given us every ability to be able to rise above and to go beyond I believe we should take that amen we should take that with all that the Lord has given us amen praise the Lord amen got a song I want to sing here amen see if I can
