[40:26] we pray amen amen
[40:28] amen second timothy chapter 2
[40:36] let's start with verse 11.
[40:41] ii timothy 2
[40:45] 11
[40:47] it is a faithful saying
[40:49] for if we be dead with him we shall also
[40:52] live with him
[40:54] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[40:56] him if we deny him he also will deny us
[41:01] if we believe not yet he abideth
[41:03] faithful he cannot deny himself of these
[41:07] things
[41:08] put them in remembrance charging them
[41:10] before the lord that they strive not
[41:13] about words to no prophet but to the
[41:15] subverting of the hearers
[41:18] study to show thyself approved unto god
[41:21] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[41:24] rightly dividing the word of truth but
[41:27] shun
[41:28] profane and vain babblings for they will
[41:30] increase unto more ungodliness
[41:33] you can be seated if you like
[41:39] amen
[41:40] how about you the
[41:41] word just seems to become more powerful
[41:44] every day to me
[41:45] i guess it's just growing the lord and
[41:47] get closer to god it just becomes more
[41:49] and more that way i want to speak on a
[41:52] a fairly simple subject probably today
[41:54] and next sunday the lord willing uh
[41:56] that's how it seemed to break out
[41:57] yesterday when i was looking these this
[42:00] up and something the lord had put on my
[42:01] heart months ago
[42:03] i want to speak on the must nots
[42:06] uh if you remember brother branham
[42:07] talked about him a specific message he
[42:10] pointed out three specific bus knots now
[42:12] obviously there's uh probably there's
[42:14] other things that brother branham had
[42:16] put on or mentioned but in that one
[42:17] message he put those three specific
[42:20] especially
[42:21] must-nots that we must not do and those
[42:23] are the things that i want to get into
[42:25] and talk about starting today
[42:27] uh about those must nots uh you probably
[42:31] all know what they are i want to try to
[42:33] the lord wheeling because brother
[42:34] branham took and he mentioned it and he
[42:36] put little highlights with all three of
[42:38] them but he really didn't take scripture
[42:40] break them down and try to
[42:42] bring them forward in an entire message
[42:45] in fact i think this quote i have here
[42:47] says that he said let's take 10 minutes
[42:50] so i kind of thought that maybe the
[42:51] must-nots deserved a little bit more
[42:54] than 10 minutes but as the lord would
[42:56] give to us today so
[42:58] those must nots as you probably may
[43:01] remember hopefully remember if not we'll
[43:02] refresh your memory the memory those
[43:05] three must nots are we must not
[43:07] misinterpret
[43:09] we must not misplace
[43:12] or dislocate the word amen now that's
[43:16] what he's talking about the word must
[43:18] not misinterpret must not misplace or
[43:23] dislocate now today i want to talk about
[43:25] the misinterpret uh we'll probably take
[43:28] the next two that kind of actually
[43:31] kind of runs side by side the other two
[43:33] mislocate dislocate mis uh misplaced
[43:36] kind of runs side by side they almost
[43:38] sound the same really if you think
[43:40] misplaced dislocate kind of sounds like
[43:42] the same thing really isn't once you
[43:45] delve into it you realize what it is
[43:47] when you break it down it's a lot more
[43:49] than just uh
[43:51] the word itself and the little nuances
[43:54] that follow along with those with those
[43:56] must not so i want to focus today on the
[43:59] must not
[44:00] misinterpret the word because it seems
[44:03] like that's the place that most people
[44:06] get in the most trouble
[44:08] is misinterpreting the word now we
[44:11] obviously can say as brother branham
[44:13] said that we should not be interpreting
[44:16] the word anyway we just let the word
[44:18] come to pass but obviously as it has
[44:22] been that we've read it over the years
[44:23] and ministers have preached it over the
[44:25] years and thank god for a prophet that
[44:28] god sent a word vindicated prophet in
[44:31] this last day to come and tie up all
[44:33] those loose sins and bring that as we
[44:36] could say full interpretation of that
[44:38] word that the word falls in perfect
[44:41] continuity altogether because the word
[44:44] itself makes a picture
[44:46] and this picture is jesus christ and you
[44:49] have to have every bit of that scripture
[44:52] in its proper place in its proper way
[44:55] and
[44:56] made what it's supposed to be how it's
[44:59] supposed to look for it to all fall into
[45:02] line if you get any of it out of cater
[45:04] it just one word like in the beginning
[45:06] which we'll get to in a little bit just
[45:08] that one word we talked to last week
[45:10] that just one word throws the whole
[45:12] picture out of continuity
[45:14] uh you know how brother brown talked
[45:16] about if you if you get one little thing
[45:18] off you could how you could have the cow
[45:21] in the tree eating grass right it could
[45:24] be that simple but it throws the whole
[45:25] picture out it doesn't look right
[45:27] anymore and if you throw one part of the
[45:30] seed
[45:30] the bible fits so perfectly together
[45:34] the bible runs so perfectly congruently
[45:37] together that if you just get one little
[45:40] thing off it throws the whole picture
[45:41] out
[45:42] you throw something off in genesis
[45:45] you're liable to make revelation look
[45:47] like a mess because you've thrown it off
[45:49] in one place it messes it up in the
[45:51] other right the whole bible so it all
[45:54] has to run perfect the
[45:57] the the picture has to be exactly the
[45:59] way the scripture is written that's how
[46:02] perfect it is now you know
[46:04] somebody tells a story sometimes they
[46:06] add a little something or they take a
[46:08] little something away or they embellish
[46:10] a little something and one on a fishing
[46:12] trip and you know you tell the story and
[46:15] it's mostly correct the first time how
[46:17] the fish was so big and you know you
[46:19] tell it the 12th time and the fish is
[46:20] all of a sudden this big you know and
[46:23] you you drug it in you had to take six
[46:25] men to help you and all this and it went
[46:28] from being a little simple fish story
[46:30] you know because some people embellish
[46:31] stories but that's not the way the
[46:33] scripture is right so we're used to
[46:35] those things as humans we've probably
[46:37] told some of those in our lives
[46:39] but that's the truth but the word is not
[46:42] like that the word is perfect
[46:45] there's not one single thing out of
[46:47] place
[46:48] and every word dovetails with the other
[46:51] so again if you get one little thing
[46:54] wrong it's like brother patton putting
[46:56] his car together i used to do a lot of
[46:58] woodworking and if you got one little
[47:01] dovetail out of its place or backwards
[47:03] or or the wrong little thing just like
[47:05] brother daniel when he put this pulpit
[47:07] together i look at it a lot of times
[47:09] because i like woodworking and i always
[47:11] have it you get one little thing out of
[47:13] place or one little thing wrong here and
[47:15] then none of it fits
[47:16] it's like brother patent put this card
[47:18] together if he puts this little part or
[47:20] if it's the wrong part it may look like
[47:22] the exact part but if it's just a little
[47:24] skosh off and you get it it can mess up
[47:26] the whole
[47:27] engine or whatever part you're putting
[47:29] together the word is like that where it
[47:32] all has to be perfect it has to be
[47:34] perfectly
[47:36] and we'll say interpreted
[47:38] for it to all work exactly and look and
[47:41] say exactly what it's supposed to that's
[47:44] the only way it works
[47:46] so thank god for a vindicated prophet
[47:48] amen
[47:49] christ revealed in his own word now this
[47:51] is the scripture the the message that
[47:54] brother branham introduced these three
[47:57] must in the way he did to us is in this
[47:59] message christ revealed in his own word
[48:01] now in order to study the scripture
[48:05] in order to study the scripture and we
[48:07] all study the scripture
[48:09] i i trust and believe we already
[48:12] read or studied the scripture
[48:14] in order to study the scripture
[48:18] paul told timothy study it
[48:21] rightly dividing the word of god which
[48:23] is the truth now
[48:26] how is it that we can know
[48:30] that
[48:31] when we read it that it is being rightly
[48:34] divided obviously in the day that we're
[48:37] living we have a message
[48:39] we can read the bible and we can go back
[48:42] to the message or we can take the
[48:43] message go back to the bible and we can
[48:46] look and say okay we know that god used
[48:49] a vindicated prophet to bring this word
[48:51] and lay it out the way it is so maybe my
[48:53] understanding about this verse of
[48:55] scripture is wrong
[48:57] because it's all got to fit together so
[48:59] we can look at that and say well thank
[49:01] god for that but how do
[49:03] how does anyone know
[49:05] that they know for sure that they have
[49:07] rightly divided because
[49:10] i can promise you and you would probably
[49:12] agree with me that every single
[49:15] christian who really believes they're a
[49:17] devout christian every single minister
[49:20] especially standing behind the pulpit on
[49:22] this sunday morning sunday afternoon
[49:24] whatever it would be
[49:26] believes that they have rightly divided
[49:29] the word every bible school you go to
[49:31] bible schools all across the country all
[49:34] around the world
[49:35] and i guarantee you that every one of
[49:37] them believes that they have rightly
[49:39] divided the word
[49:41] to bring that rightly divided word to a
[49:44] people so that those people could bring
[49:46] that rightly divided word to their
[49:48] congregations right i'm sure they
[49:51] everyone they don't come in and say i'm
[49:53] going to purposely make this wrong i
[49:56] believe every one of them think that
[49:57] they have rightly divided the word so
[50:00] how can you know
[50:02] that that word has been in your life
[50:04] because we want to make this personal
[50:06] it's not about bible colleges or
[50:09] other churches or even this church it's
[50:12] about you
[50:13] it's about me so
[50:15] let's make it personal so how do i know
[50:19] that that word has been rightly divided
[50:22] how do i know that william branham was
[50:24] the prophet of god three word prophet
[50:27] for this last day to this generation for
[50:29] this for this last day brought how do we
[50:31] know
[50:33] there's only one way
[50:35] that dividing line that we hit on the
[50:37] last two sundays
[50:39] is the exact same dividing line that we
[50:41] hid in here as we do with so many other
[50:44] things in life and that is you must be
[50:47] born again
[50:49] you must have the holy ghost that is the
[50:52] only way that you can know that that
[50:54] word has been rightly divided right
[50:57] the best way to get
[50:58] a story into your spirit as you read it
[51:02] or listen to it is to get into how the
[51:06] author wrote it
[51:08] uh if it's about a ball game or
[51:10] something
[51:11] and you and you
[51:13] you want to actually feel like you're at
[51:15] that game you read something
[51:18] and you get into the spirit of the way
[51:19] it was written
[51:21] then you can then you can really absorb
[51:24] and almost feel like you were there
[51:26] because of
[51:28] of the spiritual connection
[51:30] well the only way that you can read the
[51:33] word
[51:34] and get the spiritual connection
[51:36] and the right of the dividing of that
[51:38] word in your life
[51:40] is to is to read it by the inspiration
[51:44] or through the one who wrote it and that
[51:46] is god amen and he sent his spirit to us
[51:50] so that we could have that spirit in us
[51:52] so that spirit through us can read and
[51:55] rightly divide
[51:58] it was written by men led of the holy
[52:00] ghost so it is read by people led of the
[52:03] holy ghost it's the only way yes
[52:06] no matter what your bible college is no
[52:08] matter what church denomination no
[52:11] matter what affiliation charismatic or
[52:13] message that you go to
[52:15] to know that that word has been rightly
[52:18] divided is to only know by the holy
[52:21] ghost
[52:22] that's the only way you can know
[52:24] it has to be a born-again experience yes
[52:27] if you're born again it obligates you to
[52:30] that word
[52:32] if you have the holy ghost if you are
[52:34] born again it obligates you to that word
[52:38] because it is the word
[52:39] it all revolves around the same thing
[52:42] it's jesus christ the word only way you
[52:44] could know paul told timothy study
[52:49] rightly divide that word of god which is
[52:52] the truth rightly divided now he didn't
[52:54] say interpret it
[52:56] he said rightly divide it
[52:58] praise the lord rightly divided now each
[53:01] age
[53:02] has had its place to divide that word
[53:05] each one
[53:06] now we we we major now each one from the
[53:10] very first church paul and iranians and
[53:12] martin all the way through now we made
[53:14] you on these last few because of the
[53:16] restoration point of it with luther and
[53:19] wesley and and pentecost and the message
[53:22] of the hour and and we we we majored on
[53:25] those but each one of those
[53:27] had its own message to bring forth
[53:30] enough of the light that shined on that
[53:33] word
[53:34] because that's the way god did it
[53:36] because he did it as a plant would grow
[53:39] as the seed falls on the ground as a
[53:41] torso comes forth as a stalk as a branch
[53:44] that's how the word has come forth and
[53:46] developed itself into this last day
[53:49] bride and where we're living today and
[53:51] what we develop to believe has been
[53:53] developed and what we know and call
[53:55] affectionately as the message of the
[53:57] hour
[53:58] through through through luther luther
[54:01] didn't have
[54:02] a lot of the truths that we got brought
[54:04] to us by uh
[54:06] by brother branham
[54:08] wesley did not have now wesley had a
[54:10] little more than luther but and he just
[54:13] took luther's justification and he
[54:15] brought it with him and brought that
[54:17] into his into his sanctification but see
[54:20] he didn't have what we had this day
[54:22] pentecost had the restoration of the
[54:23] gifts all that was wonderful the
[54:25] speaking in tongues the prophet signing
[54:27] the jumping dancing all that was
[54:28] happening the emotional emotionalism and
[54:30] the spirit of god moving and the power
[54:32] and the healings and what god was doing
[54:34] and moving in those people's lives i
[54:37] believe still is here today
[54:40] it's not as prevalent as it was because
[54:43] the spirit of god is moving off the
[54:44] gentiles going back to the jews so it's
[54:46] not as prevalent as it was but it's
[54:49] still here so we didn't do away with
[54:51] justification we when we came to
[54:53] sanctification we didn't do with
[54:55] sanctification when we came into the
[54:57] restoration of the yes we just brought
[54:59] those with us because the only way you
[55:01] can get to that point is to a justified
[55:03] and sanctified condition amen well that
[55:06] brother brown just took those things and
[55:07] just brought them right into the mess
[55:09] amen yes amen and every bit of that just
[55:12] came and all tied in together right and
[55:14] finalized what the word was that god was
[55:17] to bring to us to make that picture that
[55:19] picture of god and the only way to know
[55:22] it the only way to be a part of it the
[55:24] only way for it to be a part of your
[55:26] life is to be born again the holy ghost
[55:29] i don't know why the lord
[55:31] continually because i'll be honest when
[55:33] i started this study
[55:35] just that was not a part of my thought
[55:36] process but as i studied it more and
[55:39] more it became more and more prevalent
[55:41] part of what god wants to speak to us
[55:44] about this
[55:45] you must be born again
[55:48] having the holy ghost yeah it's it's
[55:50] it's not an option
[55:53] amen when jesus told nicodemus you must
[55:55] be born again
[55:57] he meant it he didn't just say well you
[55:59] know you can if you want it's up to you
[56:01] doesn't matter it's your choice your
[56:03] decision no it's not
[56:05] it's your decision obviously but there's
[56:07] only one decision to make and as you
[56:09] must be born again
[56:11] now
[56:13] that rightly dividing not not
[56:16] interpreting rightly dividing that word
[56:19] amen that that's that's the way the
[56:21] scripture writes it rightly dividing the
[56:24] word of god
[56:25] which is truth
[56:26] there there is three must in the
[56:29] scripture
[56:30] in using god or must not in using god's
[56:34] word there is three things you must not
[56:37] do
[56:38] now let's study those for the next 10
[56:40] minutes here it is that's what i was
[56:41] thinking of three things you must not do
[56:44] and all out in the land wherever you are
[56:46] across the nation put these down in your
[56:47] mind if you don't have a pencil you must
[56:50] not do these things
[56:52] we tell you all the time what you must
[56:54] do now i'm going to tell you what you
[56:57] must not do now
[56:59] you must not
[57:02] misinterpret the word yes you say well i
[57:05] believe it means this i believe it means
[57:07] that it means just what it says
[57:11] amen it means just what it says it needs
[57:14] no interpreter and you must not misplace
[57:18] the word and you must not dislocate the
[57:20] word and if we would do either of these
[57:23] it throws the whole bible into a
[57:25] confusion and chaos yes
[57:27] must not misinterpret so let's get to
[57:30] that for a little bit we read some of
[57:32] this last week
[57:34] uh actually i think it was two weeks ago
[57:36] we didn't go so much into genesis last
[57:38] week this was a couple of weeks ago but
[57:39] let's go back to genesis chapter 3 again
[57:42] let's just start in the beginning
[57:48] start in the beginning
[57:51] the biggest problem that we have
[57:54] well the biggest problem we have is
[57:56] people not being born again people
[57:58] taking over positions
[58:00] of authority or teaching or ministering
[58:03] without having the holy ghost that's why
[58:05] brother branham said god man's got no
[58:07] business being behind a pulpit unless
[58:09] he's met the pillar of fire
[58:12] in other words he's saying he got no
[58:13] business up here trying to rightly
[58:15] divide the world without actually even
[58:16] being born again
[58:18] so that's the biggest problem but once
[58:21] you
[58:23] get beyond that
[58:26] a lot of the problem we have is people's
[58:30] beyond the holy ghost the biggest
[58:31] problem is is the interjecting of men's
[58:34] opinions yes
[58:37] or our human opinions
[58:40] now our opinions as humans uh our
[58:43] opinions get shaped over our lives
[58:46] uh
[58:47] i can ask your opinion of probably
[58:50] something simple um
[58:53] uh
[58:54] let's just say
[58:55] how how many of you like tacos
[58:59] everybody has their opinion
[59:02] myself i love them but myself
[59:05] i could count on my hand how many tacos
[59:07] i had till i was 14 years old
[59:11] i didn't have tacos in charlotte north
[59:12] carolina we didn't have tacos
[59:15] we went to some friend's house and they
[59:16] made them a certain way and i had a
[59:18] couple i could probably count on one
[59:20] hand until i was 14 and moved to tucson
[59:23] how many tacos i ate
[59:25] sister pads not at your head they're
[59:27] probably not that many in memphis either
[59:30] it's just so it's a different opinion so
[59:32] you understand your opinions are shaped
[59:35] as you grow and as you get under certain
[59:38] teachers and people of influence and you
[59:41] learn certain things and they they shape
[59:43] and mold the first people are your
[59:44] parents amen now
[59:47] i
[59:48] i
[59:48] my wife would probably go to a mexican
[59:50] restaurant where i would probably go to
[59:52] cracker barrel first
[59:53] and that's just probably interjecting
[59:56] food again but you understand how that
[59:57] could
[59:58] that could alter people's opinions
[1:00:01] uh
[1:00:02] somebody whose life has been tragically
[1:00:05] uh
[1:00:06] ended or their their their spouse or
[1:00:08] something by by gun violence is probably
[1:00:11] uh not all the time but that shapes your
[1:00:14] opinion maybe about a gun right
[1:00:16] uh and and that happens and and people's
[1:00:19] lives now where what part of the country
[1:00:22] you grow up in what parents you have
[1:00:24] what schools you went to were you
[1:00:26] homeschooled did you go to a public
[1:00:28] school all these things shape people's
[1:00:30] opinions
[1:00:31] but the and that's the problem people
[1:00:34] try to take those opinions they get from
[1:00:37] a bible school or they learned in a
[1:00:39] baptist church or a methodist church or
[1:00:41] a catholic church and they try to take
[1:00:44] all these things and stuff you hear all
[1:00:46] the social media internet and most
[1:00:47] that's just garbage that here today
[1:00:51] people try to take these things that
[1:00:53] shape their opinions and they try to
[1:00:55] bring it into the word
[1:00:57] and they try to make the word
[1:00:59] fit what their opinion is
[1:01:02] instead of
[1:01:03] instead of when you come to christ and
[1:01:06] you come to the word you guide all those
[1:01:09] things you died all your opinions
[1:01:12] you died to what you think now obviously
[1:01:15] tacos are still good that's not what i'm
[1:01:17] talking about i'm talking about the
[1:01:18] scripture the word studying the word
[1:01:22] you died of those things you died to
[1:01:24] your opinion you doubted what you
[1:01:26] thought you died to what this one said
[1:01:28] or that one said or the others because
[1:01:30] it's got to be real to you
[1:01:33] by the holy ghost and that's the only
[1:01:35] way it can fit
[1:01:36] it's the only way it can fit because you
[1:01:38] cannot interject it with anything else
[1:01:41] the word cannot be injected with any
[1:01:43] leaven at all no unbelief no doubt no
[1:01:47] opinions from over here no denominations
[1:01:50] over here and no well there's three gods
[1:01:52] well that's okay you know the rest of
[1:01:54] what he says is all right
[1:01:56] sorry it doesn't work that way you've
[1:01:58] got to die to that amen to be able to
[1:02:01] rightly divide the word that's a lot of
[1:02:03] the biggest problems people have they
[1:02:05] interject their own opinions and those
[1:02:07] opinions are developed over years and
[1:02:10] years and maybe from a pastor or from a
[1:02:12] minister from a bible school or from my
[1:02:15] parents did this my great parent my
[1:02:17] great great grandparents were methodists
[1:02:19] all die methodists
[1:02:21] that's that that's what people's that's
[1:02:23] how your opinions are developed see
[1:02:26] that they they they come to but the
[1:02:28] problem is when they start interfering
[1:02:30] with the revelation of the word to you
[1:02:34] it when they start interfering with the
[1:02:36] rightly dividing of that word to your
[1:02:38] heart to your life
[1:02:40] when god tries to show you something
[1:02:42] friend if god's showing it to you you
[1:02:44] look at it and you have to find in the
[1:02:46] scripture how it fits together
[1:02:49] i do that with the message
[1:02:51] there's stuff i still have on the shelf
[1:02:53] but i do that with the message
[1:02:56] i rightly divide that message and it's
[1:02:58] got to be with the word because if it's
[1:03:00] not it's wrong i don't care who it is
[1:03:03] right
[1:03:03] i've never found it to be wrong but it's
[1:03:06] got to fit that word genesis 1 to
[1:03:08] revelation 22. if it doesn't it's wrong
[1:03:11] it can't fit my opinion it's got to fit
[1:03:13] what the word is for the picture to stay
[1:03:16] complete so i have to die to those
[1:03:18] opinions
[1:03:19] i have to die to the fact that i was
[1:03:21] taught when i was eight to be baptized
[1:03:22] in father son the holy ghost i had to
[1:03:24] die to that
[1:03:26] when i come to the knowledge of the
[1:03:27] truth and how the word says you are to
[1:03:29] be baptized i have people coming to me
[1:03:32] oh jesus said but jesus said that's her
[1:03:35] famous saying about being baptized but
[1:03:37] jesus said now father son the holy ghost
[1:03:41] well if jesus said that then why did
[1:03:43] peter who just got filled with the holy
[1:03:45] ghost come and contradict god himself
[1:03:49] that's right he didn't
[1:03:51] he just expounded on what jesus said
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] he magnified it to help us understand
[1:03:58] this is what he's saying the answer the
[1:04:00] father son the holy ghost is the lord
[1:04:02] jesus christ and that is his name amen
[1:04:05] and that's how i said and when the lord
[1:04:07] showed that to me
[1:04:09] and the lord shows that to you then
[1:04:11] you've got to die to the other
[1:04:13] or you you can't just bring that with
[1:04:15] you
[1:04:17] you can't just bring in something that's
[1:04:19] that's tainted by the understanding or
[1:04:21] the belief that there's three gods
[1:04:24] that there is a trinity when there's no
[1:04:27] word even in the bible close to trinity
[1:04:30] in fact
[1:04:31] now
[1:04:32] i don't i don't mean this to be
[1:04:34] hedonistic but they're actually if you
[1:04:36] want to study the bible especially the
[1:04:39] new testament
[1:04:40] there's actually more scripture to
[1:04:42] justify two gods than three yeah
[1:04:46] go study it yourself
[1:04:47] there's actually more scripture to
[1:04:49] justify two gods than three
[1:04:52] but trinity's the way to go what's
[1:04:54] everybody songs and that's what they're
[1:04:56] teaching and believing it's a well he
[1:04:58] hardly ever preaches on it but
[1:04:59] everything he believes
[1:05:01] everything he sees and how he views this
[1:05:04] work is going to be affected by that
[1:05:14] they hardly ever talk about it doesn't
[1:05:15] matter
[1:05:17] if that's their fundamental belief and
[1:05:19] they haven't died to the understanding
[1:05:20] there's one god and three per
[1:05:22] and three offices
[1:05:24] one god then it's going to be it's going
[1:05:27] to be affected that way just like every
[1:05:29] ministering of the true god belief of
[1:05:30] the godhead is going to be affected that
[1:05:32] way
[1:05:33] if you understand and believe and know
[1:05:35] there's only one god that's how it's
[1:05:37] going to be revealed to you
[1:05:38] that's going to that's going to shape
[1:05:41] your opinion or your view or your
[1:05:43] revelation of what the bible says
[1:05:46] then it doesn't become about an
[1:05:47] understanding it doesn't become about uh
[1:05:50] can i
[1:05:52] does this make sense to me it comes
[1:05:54] about is god revealing himself to me
[1:05:57] is god opening himself to me is god
[1:06:00] revealing and showing himself to me
[1:06:03] are we entering into an intimate
[1:06:05] relationship or am i still out in the
[1:06:07] kitchen somewhere
[1:06:09] have i gone into the bedroom with an
[1:06:10] intimate relationship with the lord or
[1:06:12] am i still sitting in the living room
[1:06:14] drinking a cup of coffee
[1:06:17] amen am i still outside playing with the
[1:06:20] dog
[1:06:21] or have i entered into an intimate
[1:06:23] relationship has god really opened
[1:06:25] himself to
[1:06:26] because god really invited me so that we
[1:06:29] could come and see
[1:06:30] all the intimate details who he is
[1:06:33] amen that's why so many times the
[1:06:35] scripture jesus said depart i never knew
[1:06:37] you i never had a relationship with you
[1:06:41] i i never had intimacy with you
[1:06:44] but there is a group
[1:06:46] that comes forth
[1:06:47] as miss jesus
[1:06:50] his wife because of that intimate
[1:06:52] relationship
[1:06:54] got to be done through the holy spirit
[1:06:55] he kind of died to everything else now
[1:06:57] look at this misinterpreting uh genesis
[1:07:00] chapter 3.
[1:07:02] we just read this a couple weeks ago now
[1:07:04] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:07:07] beast of the field remember that subtle
[1:07:09] sensible his cunning conniving beguiling
[1:07:12] but it is sensible more subtle than any
[1:07:15] beast of the field which the lord god
[1:07:17] had made
[1:07:18] and he said unto the woman
[1:07:20] yeah god said ye shall not eat of every
[1:07:23] uh of every tree of the garden that's
[1:07:24] his question
[1:07:26] what's this question loaded with doubt
[1:07:30] his question is loaded with doubt it's a
[1:07:32] genuine question anybody should be able
[1:07:34] to answer any born-again holy
[1:07:37] ghost-filled
[1:07:38] godly christians should be able to
[1:07:40] answer that yes
[1:07:42] remember eve was not the word
[1:07:46] she was the byproduct because we're
[1:07:47] going to get to something a little bit
[1:07:50] she was the byproduct
[1:07:52] but the question was to bring
[1:07:54] doubt so understand
[1:07:57] he said unto the woman
[1:07:59] yea hath god said you shall not eat of
[1:08:01] every tree of the garden
[1:08:04] questioning the authority of god's word
[1:08:08] trying to sow doubt
[1:08:11] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:08:13] may eat of the fruits of the tree of the
[1:08:14] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:08:15] which is in the midst of the garden
[1:08:17] god has said ye shall not eat of it
[1:08:20] neither shall you touch it lest she die
[1:08:22] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[1:08:24] shall not surely die now he's gone from
[1:08:26] interjecting doubt to false doctrine yes
[1:08:31] to twisting the word to fit his ends
[1:08:36] to fit his belief to fit his religion
[1:08:40] he's twisted the word now so he's taking
[1:08:42] her from
[1:08:43] trying to interject doubt
[1:08:46] to trying to
[1:08:48] pervert the word
[1:08:51] the serpent said the woman ye shall not
[1:08:53] surely die for god doth know that in the
[1:08:56] day you eat thereof then your eyes shall
[1:08:59] be opened you shall be as gods knowing
[1:09:00] good and evil and that is true that is
[1:09:03] exactly what said and what and what did
[1:09:06] he bring back
[1:09:07] same thing that so many people in the
[1:09:09] same arguments all the time try to do
[1:09:11] but the bible said uh also says or or or
[1:09:15] uh but uh but this quote over here
[1:09:19] refutes this quote over here i'm sorry
[1:09:22] it does not right it might look like
[1:09:25] unless brother brandon made a mistake
[1:09:26] which
[1:09:27] you listen to the message long enough
[1:09:29] you find out that uh brother branham
[1:09:31] made mistakes sometimes calling 1965
[1:09:34] 1964 and uh i was looking at this
[1:09:37] yesterday and um
[1:09:40] uh
[1:09:41] i i think it was maybe in this message
[1:09:43] anyway brother madam kept saying over
[1:09:44] and over when you mess the whole picture
[1:09:47] of god up you make him one out of three
[1:09:51] well that makes you sound like that he
[1:09:53] believes the trinity and putting down
[1:09:55] the people that are trying to make him
[1:09:57] one
[1:09:58] he said it backwards three times he said
[1:10:00] that right in a row i know he didn't
[1:10:02] mean to and i know what he meant but
[1:10:04] each time he said you try to make god
[1:10:06] one out of three no we're trying to
[1:10:09] we're making three gods into one
[1:10:13] not one in the three so you see he got
[1:10:15] it backwards so he's a man yes you let
[1:10:17] him be a man then
[1:10:19] it all works out a lot easier and better
[1:10:22] see yeah but
[1:10:23] but
[1:10:24] those quotes they're not contradictory
[1:10:26] your opinion or your feeling of them or
[1:10:28] your interpretation of them might
[1:10:30] contradict but they don't contradict
[1:10:32] each other but that's exactly what the
[1:10:34] serpent is doing here
[1:10:36] god doesn't know oh i know he said this
[1:10:39] to you but god does know so what's he
[1:10:41] doing but he also said this other but
[1:10:44] god knows but that's not his word he's
[1:10:47] perverting the word oh god knows
[1:10:50] that you do this and this and this and
[1:10:52] now then that's true
[1:10:54] but that's not what god said that wasn't
[1:10:56] god's word
[1:10:57] god said don't do it
[1:10:59] no question
[1:11:01] nothing to interpret
[1:11:03] nothing to to question or misunderstand
[1:11:07] don't do it that's just it
[1:11:09] don't do it amen praise the lord she
[1:11:12] listened to the reasoning of the serpent
[1:11:14] and she did it she gave it to her
[1:11:16] husband and he did it
[1:11:17] you see how that misinterpreting i'd
[1:11:20] rather random i think he preaches
[1:11:22] something called the uh several times he
[1:11:24] calls it the trial or a trial and he
[1:11:27] talks about how
[1:11:28] satan comes before eve here and other
[1:11:32] subjects through the bible and satan
[1:11:35] misinterpreting the word
[1:11:37] now eve did not purposely
[1:11:40] she did not purposely disbelieve god
[1:11:44] like we said last week week before
[1:11:46] she didn't purposely disbelieve god
[1:11:49] satan misinterpreted that word to her
[1:11:53] he so doubt
[1:11:55] he brought
[1:11:56] a new word his word
[1:12:00] to bring division
[1:12:03] and that's that's his message that's
[1:12:05] what he does yes he still does it the
[1:12:07] same way today yes amen brings division
[1:12:11] doubt questioning
[1:12:13] a false word
[1:12:14] and then a separation from that word oh
[1:12:17] god said that's why a lot of people say
[1:12:19] oh but
[1:12:20] jesus himself said father son the holy
[1:12:22] ghost
[1:12:24] but without a rightly dividing of that
[1:12:26] work which peter had thanks to the whole
[1:12:29] the new birth that he had just received
[1:12:31] rightly divided that word and told us
[1:12:33] what the truth be born in uh be baptized
[1:12:36] name of jesus christ and then you'll
[1:12:37] receive the holy ghost yes amen
[1:12:40] so that's that's rightly that brings
[1:12:42] that word into into life for us now now
[1:12:45] look
[1:12:47] these are the trumpets
[1:12:48] now someone said
[1:12:50] well the seven seals then brother brown
[1:12:53] now this is again
[1:12:55] i i i picked this
[1:12:57] because of the man's opinion
[1:12:59] his opinion without revelation without
[1:13:03] rightly dividing i thank god brother
[1:13:05] branham comes and rightly divides it in
[1:13:08] the as we get into this quote
[1:13:10] but listen to it i'm giving you this
[1:13:12] little heads up so you can listen to
[1:13:14] this as i read through it
[1:13:16] now someone said well that's seven seals
[1:13:19] then brother brown that will be revealed
[1:13:22] in the last day some great mystery of
[1:13:24] how we get closer to god that's his
[1:13:26] opinion
[1:13:28] that's what he thought
[1:13:29] that's what developed his opinion about
[1:13:33] those about those seals
[1:13:35] but then a prophet comes along rightly
[1:13:38] divides and tells the man no sir it
[1:13:41] cannot be
[1:13:42] you cannot add to or take away from the
[1:13:45] word
[1:13:46] amen it can be some great thing to get
[1:13:49] closer to god that's outside this
[1:13:52] scripture it can't be brother adam says
[1:13:54] no sir it cannot be
[1:13:57] whosoever takes one word from this bible
[1:13:59] or add one's word to it is parts taken
[1:14:01] to the book of life
[1:14:03] what it is is a revelation on what has
[1:14:06] been missed in the back back there
[1:14:10] to bring now it's already wrote it's
[1:14:12] already in the scripture it's already
[1:14:14] here
[1:14:15] it's to reveal what has already been
[1:14:18] written because you can't add one thing
[1:14:20] or take one thing from it
[1:14:22] it just has to become enlightened
[1:14:25] revealed to
[1:14:28] manifest it to those
[1:14:30] with the holy ghost to see what the word
[1:14:32] is
[1:14:33] is bringing to us for our day
[1:14:35] amen for our day
[1:14:39] the first chapter of the bible in the
[1:14:41] beginning genesis
[1:14:42] one woman
[1:14:44] she didn't misbelieve it
[1:14:47] but she just misinterpreted she let
[1:14:50] satan misinterpret to her one word
[1:14:54] see and then from that caused all the
[1:14:57] trouble
[1:14:58] and that was god was speaking of god's
[1:15:01] word
[1:15:02] so that one thing
[1:15:03] that misinterpreting of that one thing
[1:15:05] there back then
[1:15:07] through the entire humanity and the
[1:15:09] world's picture into a complete chaos
[1:15:12] different than
[1:15:14] i believe what it was meant to be when
[1:15:16] god created adam and the world to begin
[1:15:18] with
[1:15:18] right
[1:15:19] it threw a world into a sin condition
[1:15:22] which was not god's perfect will right
[1:15:25] it entered into god's permissive will it
[1:15:28] is still in god's permissive will
[1:15:30] that's why if you put a lamb and a lion
[1:15:32] in the same cage together that light
[1:15:34] that lamb is not going to last very long
[1:15:36] right that's why when you go walk
[1:15:38] through our desert out here now you
[1:15:40] don't do it without stepping and making
[1:15:42] sure you don't hit any plants at all
[1:15:44] because everything here has stickers
[1:15:47] briar stickers something
[1:15:50] some of them poke you some stick on you
[1:15:52] some of them you can't get apples
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] you know that is living in the desert
[1:15:59] it wouldn't be that way
[1:16:01] if it still wasn't in that curse
[1:16:03] but it threw everything it was that
[1:16:05] whole picture changed just because of
[1:16:07] that one word
[1:16:09] so that's how it throws that is the
[1:16:12] example of how it throws the entire word
[1:16:14] out of continuity if you just miss it
[1:16:17] off just the skosh
[1:16:19] amen we can't do it
[1:16:21] in the chapter of revelation jesus
[1:16:23] himself the same god said whosoever take
[1:16:26] one word or add one word to it this is
[1:16:28] the complete revelation of jesus christ
[1:16:32] he's
[1:16:33] patting his bible
[1:16:34] the seven seals had the mystery hit of
[1:16:37] what it was and it's supposed to be open
[1:16:40] or revealed in the last day at the
[1:16:42] laodicean age now
[1:16:45] those seals will continue to unfold
[1:16:47] themselves even after we're gone
[1:16:51] but they were to be revealed
[1:16:53] or made known
[1:16:55] so we could look back to those parts
[1:16:57] that that were already played out and
[1:17:00] see the trick of the enemy
[1:17:03] the ways of the devil the seven seals
[1:17:06] opening friend was really more than
[1:17:08] anything to exposing devil in all of his
[1:17:11] tricks
[1:17:13] for the first church age up until where
[1:17:15] we are now and god will continue see
[1:17:17] people get that seven seal oh well do
[1:17:19] you believe the seals are open
[1:17:21] you know it's always a question people
[1:17:23] are they open you believe they're open
[1:17:26] well it depends on what your
[1:17:27] interpretation of open is
[1:17:29] have they been broken have they been
[1:17:31] open have they been revealed have they
[1:17:33] been manifested have they been
[1:17:35] i mean take your pick
[1:17:37] yeah what do you what what do you
[1:17:39] exactly do you mean right i had a
[1:17:41] brother one time he pinned me down in
[1:17:44] canada
[1:17:45] well brother what do you believe he's
[1:17:47] you know because he'd heard what brother
[1:17:49] green taught and everything i said well
[1:17:51] it depends on what you mean
[1:17:52] and he goes into this that and the other
[1:17:54] and i said well that's the way i believe
[1:17:55] this
[1:17:56] god reveals and opens it up and i said
[1:17:59] but but
[1:18:01] i don't believe any seal breaks
[1:18:04] until it gets to the point that it's
[1:18:06] supposed to be poured out on the on the
[1:18:08] world right that's when that seal breaks
[1:18:12] amen when when god
[1:18:14] when god allows that seal to happen and
[1:18:17] break forth onto the people that's when
[1:18:19] that happens
[1:18:21] amen not until then you say well that's
[1:18:23] why people get so many things you go
[1:18:25] back and breach and uh even some of the
[1:18:28] seals and uh that that men look at it
[1:18:31] and they get things so scrupled up
[1:18:33] because they think that those things
[1:18:35] happen right then and they weren't
[1:18:37] happening right then it's just things
[1:18:39] that brother branham brought out to say
[1:18:41] this is what happened this is what is
[1:18:42] happening this is what is going to
[1:18:44] happen
[1:18:45] there will be a time saints where there
[1:18:47] will be no blood on the mercy seat there
[1:18:50] will be a time that people
[1:18:51] always push that and say well that's
[1:18:53] just what brother branham said
[1:18:56] he even preached sirs could this be the
[1:18:58] time
[1:19:00] could it already be over right and that
[1:19:02] was a sincere question that brother
[1:19:04] branham had in his heart but we know now
[1:19:06] he knew then by the time he got to that
[1:19:08] end of the message if you'll listen to
[1:19:09] it
[1:19:10] when he got to the end of it realized
[1:19:12] that it wasn't
[1:19:14] but he tried to help people understand
[1:19:16] we are this close yes we are this close
[1:19:20] those seven seals had the mysteries here
[1:19:23] what it was supposed to be in the last
[1:19:24] days laodicean church age it was just to
[1:19:27] bring out what has been gone through all
[1:19:29] this time now let's go to one more
[1:19:31] scripture
[1:19:32] in matthew chapter four
[1:19:35] saint matthew chapter 4
[1:19:44] amen matthew saint matthew chapter 4.
[1:19:46] now
[1:19:48] as you're turning there
[1:19:50] we know brother banham preached
[1:19:54] thinking man's filter
[1:19:57] which is the word
[1:19:59] everything
[1:20:01] has to be filtered through that word
[1:20:03] everything every part of your life every
[1:20:05] facet of your life
[1:20:06] if it doesn't go through this word leave
[1:20:09] it alone
[1:20:10] it's got to go through this words gotta
[1:20:12] pass through this word
[1:20:14] if you get to a place in life you think
[1:20:15] i wonder is it okay to smoke put it
[1:20:18] through the work and see if it is
[1:20:20] i wonder if it's okay to get a tattoo
[1:20:23] put it through the word and see if it is
[1:20:25] yes amen not your filter the word yes
[1:20:29] that filters got to be filtered with the
[1:20:32] holy ghost too but see now
[1:20:34] everything has to be filtered through
[1:20:36] this word yes
[1:20:38] but this word is filtered through the
[1:20:40] holy spirit yes
[1:20:42] amen the holy spirit that's because it
[1:20:44] is the word and that's what brings it to
[1:20:47] the to the revelation
[1:20:49] understanding revelation of
[1:20:52] what it's telling us what it's helping
[1:20:55] us become
[1:20:57] we see it yes but but more than just
[1:20:59] seeing it we become it
[1:21:01] that and that's what
[1:21:03] matters the most that you become the
[1:21:05] word
[1:21:06] now in matthew chapter 4
[1:21:09] the amount of temptations we call it
[1:21:13] matthew 4 1. then then was jesus led up
[1:21:16] of the spirit
[1:21:18] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:21:20] devil now this might seem
[1:21:23] sort of contradictory
[1:21:25] to
[1:21:26] jesus in matthew 6
[1:21:29] of jesus model prayer
[1:21:32] the lord's prayer
[1:21:34] as we call it
[1:21:36] a part of that prayer is
[1:21:38] lead us not into temptation
[1:21:42] is it not but deliver us from evil
[1:21:44] but now look at this
[1:21:47] jesus was led
[1:21:49] by the spirit the holy spirit
[1:21:53] into the wilderness
[1:21:55] for the point or the purpose
[1:21:58] of being tempted of the devil
[1:22:03] the holy spirit led jesus into the
[1:22:06] wilderness for the purpose of being
[1:22:08] tempted amen
[1:22:11] but why did he say something different
[1:22:13] in matthew 6
[1:22:16] because this was for him
[1:22:19] remember he took our place yes so we
[1:22:23] could take his
[1:22:25] he went and was led through this
[1:22:27] temptation
[1:22:29] one of the greatest if
[1:22:32] probably not as great as the garden of
[1:22:33] gethsemane one of the greatest
[1:22:35] temptations man has ever known after
[1:22:37] fasting 40 days and 40 nights of the
[1:22:39] week is part of his human being his
[1:22:41] spirit his mind must have been in a
[1:22:43] turmoil anybody ever come close to 40
[1:22:45] days and 49 days i haven't
[1:22:48] even closed
[1:22:49] but his mind his spirit must have been a
[1:22:52] complete turmoil as a human as as a
[1:22:54] flesh body and spirit human spirit must
[1:22:57] have been in a complete turmoil
[1:22:59] and the temptation that was come he was
[1:23:02] purposely led there
[1:23:05] because he took our place
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:08] now we pray lead us not what we don't
[1:23:12] need to be led he was he took our place
[1:23:15] it's like
[1:23:16] i said a few weeks ago around christmas
[1:23:19] time you always see people
[1:23:21] and you hear and i think again uh
[1:23:24] i heard somebody somewhere in some
[1:23:26] different country died
[1:23:28] but they want to they they want to
[1:23:31] model the crucifixion so close men
[1:23:34] willing to allow themselves to be nailed
[1:23:37] to a cross us why would you do that
[1:23:39] right
[1:23:40] he did it so we wouldn't have to yes
[1:23:44] he was led of the spirit to be tempted
[1:23:47] of the devil so we don't have to yeah
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:52] sure we get tempted there's no doubt we
[1:23:54] do
[1:23:55] but the leaning of that temptation is
[1:23:57] different because the spirit of god led
[1:24:00] him to that the spirit of god doesn't
[1:24:02] lead you to temptation
[1:24:04] the devil will tempt you but this holy
[1:24:06] spirit doesn't lead you to temptation
[1:24:08] that's the difference in what jesus did
[1:24:10] here and what he said in matthew 6
[1:24:13] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[1:24:16] us from the evil because it's the evil
[1:24:18] that brings the temptation not a leading
[1:24:21] if you're being led to temptation you
[1:24:23] have a wrong spirit right
[1:24:26] you still have a snake nature in you yes
[1:24:29] that desires to do that and it's leading
[1:24:31] you to that
[1:24:33] understand so he took our place but he
[1:24:36] was led
[1:24:37] of the holy ghost of the holy spirit
[1:24:39] into the wilderness for the purpose of
[1:24:41] temptation to be tempted
[1:24:44] thank god he was
[1:24:46] the bible says he was tempted above all
[1:24:48] temptation well why did he so he could
[1:24:50] be my kinsmen
[1:24:51] yes amen if i got a backache i can go to
[1:24:55] the lord jesus you know why because
[1:24:56] there's probably no human ever had a
[1:24:58] worse backache than he did right if i
[1:25:00] got a headache you know where i can go
[1:25:02] i'd go to the lord jesus because there's
[1:25:04] probably never a human ever lived that
[1:25:06] had a headache as bad as his when they
[1:25:07] shoved that crown of thorns down into
[1:25:09] his skull
[1:25:10] yes he is tempted above all temptation
[1:25:14] and he knows what we go through
[1:25:16] he's our intercessor he's our high
[1:25:18] priest he's our family position i call
[1:25:20] him our family physician do people have
[1:25:23] pcps that's okay
[1:25:25] he's my pcp
[1:25:27] praise the lord might have an earthly
[1:25:29] one too but he's my heavenly one he's my
[1:25:31] main one he's the one i go to first
[1:25:34] my primary care physician
[1:25:38] when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights
[1:25:40] he was afterward and hungered and when
[1:25:42] the tempter came to him
[1:25:44] he said if thou be the son of god
[1:25:47] command these stones to be made present
[1:25:49] does that sound familiar
[1:25:52] now you got to understand the devil
[1:25:53] doesn't change his tactics
[1:25:55] he uses the exact same tactics today
[1:25:58] he may have used these exact same
[1:26:00] tactics with you before in the past he
[1:26:03] may be trying to use that tactic on you
[1:26:05] right now oh if it is oh if this is the
[1:26:09] truth oh if you are a child of god oh if
[1:26:12] and that's that's exactly that's what he
[1:26:14] did in the garden of eden
[1:26:16] first thing he tried to do and his
[1:26:18] deception was to bring doubt
[1:26:21] right he wants you first to get you to
[1:26:24] doubt
[1:26:25] who you are
[1:26:27] that's what he wants to do the first
[1:26:28] thing he did that with eve now notice he
[1:26:31] came to eve who wasn't the word
[1:26:34] and she fell to that but when he but
[1:26:36] when he hit this 100 billion volt wire
[1:26:39] called jesus christ he got his feather
[1:26:41] sin
[1:26:44] jesus answered and said it is written
[1:26:48] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:26:50] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:26:52] mouth of god
[1:26:53] but notice the tactic was the same if
[1:26:56] you are if thou be
[1:26:59] try to get him to doubt
[1:27:01] but jesus knew who he was but he was at
[1:27:03] the weakest point of his human life
[1:27:06] he was at the weakest point of his human
[1:27:08] spirit and his life
[1:27:10] 40 days 40 nights maybe hallucinating i
[1:27:13] don't know hungry
[1:27:15] thirsting
[1:27:17] and the devil tries to get him to doubt
[1:27:19] who that's the first thing to get you to
[1:27:21] doubt who you are
[1:27:23] that's that's the way he can try to get
[1:27:25] you defeated is that you first have to
[1:27:28] doubt who you are in christ
[1:27:31] amen don't let him do it yes
[1:27:34] don't let him get you to doubt who you
[1:27:36] are
[1:27:37] you know who you are in christ in his
[1:27:39] word
[1:27:40] and i'll tell you this morning not a lot
[1:27:42] of us but if you don't know that
[1:27:45] i would get to know him before you leave
[1:27:46] here today
[1:27:48] that's what that's what it's called to
[1:27:50] be means to be born again
[1:27:52] you have the holy ghost and you're
[1:27:54] filled with his spirit there is no doubt
[1:27:56] when he comes in
[1:27:58] you know who you are there's any doubt
[1:28:00] in anybody here i'd make sure i'd that
[1:28:03] doubt was gone before i leap through
[1:28:04] that door for that one
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:08] yes sir
[1:28:09] then the devil fifth first
[1:28:12] taketh him up into the holy city
[1:28:14] and setted him on a pinnacle of the
[1:28:16] temple
[1:28:17] and he did it again
[1:28:19] he's still trying to get jesus to doubt
[1:28:20] who he is and he said unto him if thou
[1:28:23] be the son of god
[1:28:25] cast thyself down now what does he do
[1:28:29] first he tried to get him to doubt and
[1:28:31] jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:28:34] alone but by every word of god
[1:28:36] that was his that was his word answer to
[1:28:39] the error that was presented now satan
[1:28:43] is doing the same thing if now
[1:28:46] remember our subject is misinterpreting
[1:28:48] the word
[1:28:49] which is exactly what he did to eve
[1:28:51] which is exactly what he's trying to do
[1:28:53] to christ but remember christ is the
[1:28:56] word
[1:28:57] you can't deceive the word
[1:29:02] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[1:29:05] down listen now for it is written
[1:29:10] you see what the devil's doing now
[1:29:12] he's taking the word to try to deceive
[1:29:15] the word by
[1:29:17] you can't deceive the word with the word
[1:29:20] it is the word amen it's like i said
[1:29:22] last week you can't transgress the word
[1:29:25] you are the word yes
[1:29:27] why it's like brother brown said a
[1:29:29] sinner can't sin that's what he is he's
[1:29:32] a sinner
[1:29:34] for it is written he shall give his
[1:29:36] angels charge concerning thee and in
[1:29:39] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[1:29:41] at any time thou dast thy foot against
[1:29:43] the stone
[1:29:44] he's trying to bring the word
[1:29:47] but he's misinterpreting the word
[1:29:50] amen first he just tried to get jesus to
[1:29:52] know who he was jesus corrected that
[1:29:53] with the word now he's trying to get him
[1:29:56] to doubt and bring the word into it
[1:29:59] and say but it is written
[1:30:02] now don't think for a second satan
[1:30:04] doesn't know this word he does
[1:30:06] amen he knows it
[1:30:09] jesus the word
[1:30:11] said unto him it is written again
[1:30:15] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god oh
[1:30:17] yeah it is this is written but it's not
[1:30:21] interpreted for written for me to
[1:30:22] purposely say oh i know the grace of god
[1:30:25] is plentiful so i'll just go live like a
[1:30:27] devil because god will forgive me
[1:30:29] it's the same thing
[1:30:31] it's the same premise yes jesus is
[1:30:34] saying
[1:30:36] satan says oh just throw yourself down
[1:30:38] and his angels will save you jesus said
[1:30:40] no no no no
[1:30:42] it says you don't tempt the lord thy god
[1:30:44] reminds me of those snake handling
[1:30:46] churches by keys east
[1:30:48] i said you know what i'm like paul if i
[1:30:50] get in a place where there's a snake or
[1:30:53] one bites me or something i believe god
[1:30:55] will take care of me protect me if i'm
[1:30:56] out hiking hunting or something god will
[1:30:58] take care of me and help me and protect
[1:31:00] me but i'm not going to go into a church
[1:31:02] of any place or any place for that
[1:31:04] matter and perfectly say let me grab
[1:31:07] this poisonous snake and
[1:31:09] dance around with it
[1:31:12] oh yeah god will take care of you
[1:31:14] absolutely but don't you tempt him yes
[1:31:16] amen
[1:31:18] don't purposely go in and grab that
[1:31:20] and just box the snakes and
[1:31:24] i've told you the stories i've heard
[1:31:26] back east with some of those churches i
[1:31:28] don't know if they even exist there
[1:31:29] probably are some still left but there
[1:31:31] are i don't know but it i i've heard
[1:31:33] them before
[1:31:35] uh
[1:31:36] i'll tell you this story again now it's
[1:31:38] true story
[1:31:40] a man came and he's visiting this church
[1:31:42] he was a guitar player very good guitar
[1:31:44] player i could name him you wouldn't
[1:31:46] know who he is but he was sitting on the
[1:31:48] platform
[1:31:49] and he's playing and pre-game service
[1:31:51] and he was pretty pre-game free
[1:31:54] service playing and
[1:31:57] he saw a box next to the pulpit
[1:32:00] and he looks over at the other guitar
[1:32:02] player and he's a regular there he says
[1:32:04] what's in that box over there
[1:32:06] he said oh those are snakes they'll be
[1:32:08] opening that box in a little bit and
[1:32:09] start bringing those snakes out
[1:32:11] everywhere
[1:32:12] he'd probably turn white as a sheep but
[1:32:14] he's
[1:32:15] he's still playing he says do they have
[1:32:17] a back door in this place
[1:32:20] the guy says no they don't he says you
[1:32:22] reckon they want one
[1:32:24] he was going to make him the back door
[1:32:28] he was going to try to get out as fast
[1:32:29] as he could get out of there but you see
[1:32:32] you don't tempt the lord yeah so the
[1:32:34] misinterpretation or misplacement of the
[1:32:37] word
[1:32:38] god corrected with the word nothing
[1:32:41] wrong with the word he said it was the
[1:32:43] way he said it or or how he
[1:32:45] misinterpreted it to the word
[1:32:48] again the word can't be deceived by the
[1:32:50] word now last one and again again the
[1:32:53] devil taketh him up into an exceeding
[1:32:55] high mountain
[1:32:57] showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[1:32:59] world and the glory of them and said
[1:33:01] unto him all these things will i give
[1:33:04] thee if that will fall down and worship
[1:33:05] me now he's not trying to deceive him
[1:33:08] he's not trying to
[1:33:11] get him to doubt who he is
[1:33:13] he's no longer trying to
[1:33:15] bring the word against him
[1:33:17] he's not trying to deceive him he's just
[1:33:19] trying to use the
[1:33:21] humanity that every one of us possess
[1:33:25] of greed and pride right
[1:33:28] to take over
[1:33:29] which happens more and more every day in
[1:33:31] this world anyway
[1:33:33] to people in that pride and then that
[1:33:36] greed to do things they're not supposed
[1:33:38] to do
[1:33:40] to do things they shouldn't do
[1:33:42] to do things that any christian
[1:33:44] shouldn't do
[1:33:46] because of the pride
[1:33:48] arrogance the greed
[1:33:50] so he's he's
[1:33:52] he's working on the weakness and the
[1:33:54] humanity of jesus and his flesh at that
[1:33:57] time
[1:33:58] and offering him the entire world and he
[1:34:00] could do it because at that time he
[1:34:03] still possessed it
[1:34:05] satan still possessed this world he's
[1:34:07] still in the possession he still
[1:34:09] possesses it but he possessed it at this
[1:34:12] time in a way that he could relinquish
[1:34:15] his possession to another
[1:34:17] he can't do that now he's just a
[1:34:19] squatter now
[1:34:20] he's still in control of it but he's
[1:34:22] just a squatter because when jesus died
[1:34:25] and the chemical chemistry of the blood
[1:34:27] fell into the earth it was redeemed back
[1:34:30] to god yes that blood the chemistry of
[1:34:33] the blood redeemed this ball of dirt
[1:34:35] back to god it was his possession it is
[1:34:37] in his possession again belongs to him
[1:34:39] so satan could at one point give it to
[1:34:42] him
[1:34:43] but after that blood was shared yet he
[1:34:45] could no longer do it right but he tried
[1:34:47] to give it to him and he could have done
[1:34:49] it
[1:34:50] if you will fall down and worship me
[1:34:52] then
[1:34:53] then saith jesus unto him get thee hints
[1:34:56] satan for it is written thou shalt
[1:34:57] worship the lord thy god and him only
[1:34:59] shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth
[1:35:01] him and behold angels came and
[1:35:03] ministered to him
[1:35:05] notice the one thing that defeated the
[1:35:07] devil every single time was the word
[1:35:13] the word in the hands of a believer will
[1:35:16] win every time yes amen amen pure
[1:35:21] unadulterated not misplaced not
[1:35:23] mislocated not displaced the pure word
[1:35:27] of god in the hands of
[1:35:29] a believer today
[1:35:31] will work every single time it will
[1:35:33] defeat the enemy every single time yes
[1:35:37] now did jesus have the power to say
[1:35:39] satan i curse you into a frog
[1:35:43] that devil would have riveted off that
[1:35:45] mountain yes
[1:35:46] sure he could have no i cursed you as
[1:35:49] men he would have never spoke another
[1:35:51] word
[1:35:52] good
[1:35:53] i curse you into the dust of the ground
[1:35:56] he'll walk right over him as he left
[1:35:58] that place but he didn't do that right
[1:36:00] he taught us a lesson because remember
[1:36:03] he went there in our place
[1:36:06] amen he went there in our place he was
[1:36:10] led of the holy ghost to be tempted of
[1:36:12] the devil he took our place so we could
[1:36:15] be not led to tempted he's there taking
[1:36:18] our place so this whole scenario that is
[1:36:22] played out here
[1:36:23] before us
[1:36:25] now i don't know about you friend but
[1:36:27] when entering into that spirit of that
[1:36:29] story i can see it right now
[1:36:33] it's like i feel like i'm there
[1:36:35] i don't know about you but i i feel like
[1:36:38] i'm here i can see this taking place but
[1:36:41] it is for us
[1:36:43] to
[1:36:45] gain that understanding and that faith
[1:36:47] to realize
[1:36:49] satan doesn't need to be cursed into
[1:36:51] dust or to a frog or there's a mute
[1:36:53] we just use the word yes
[1:36:56] you just use what is in you
[1:36:59] you are the word
[1:37:00] use that word to combat the enemy and it
[1:37:03] will win every time
[1:37:06] jesus said this
[1:37:08] the word says this
[1:37:10] and you use that word the word
[1:37:13] it will always work
[1:37:15] it will never fail
[1:37:18] now in the hands of an unbeliever or the
[1:37:20] hands of somebody not born again in the
[1:37:21] hands of somebody that's misinterpreted
[1:37:23] or something oh yeah that doesn't work
[1:37:26] but in the hands of a born-again
[1:37:28] believer
[1:37:29] by faith that word works every time yes
[1:37:32] he's standing in our place as an example
[1:37:35] to us of how we defeat this enemy today
[1:37:38] yes
[1:37:39] with the word
[1:37:40] first don't ever get him to let you
[1:37:44] doubt who you are in christ
[1:37:46] however
[1:37:48] that's just the wedge in the door that
[1:37:50] satan needs to try to bring deception
[1:37:52] don't let him do it
[1:37:54] don't let him bring that wedge in there
[1:37:56] saying don't ever let him get to believe
[1:37:58] get you to believe or doubt who you are
[1:38:00] in christ amen and then you stand on
[1:38:03] that word
[1:38:05] you stand take that tie post and you
[1:38:08] give it back to him and let him see no
[1:38:11] you are the life behind the name
[1:38:14] yes amen that word let me read this one
[1:38:16] more scripture i'll close here
[1:38:19] back in second timothy chapter four
[1:38:27] i charge thee therefore before god
[1:38:30] and the lord jesus christ again look
[1:38:34] i just dawned on me
[1:38:36] i i picked this scripture yesterday but
[1:38:38] it just dawned on me what i'd said
[1:38:39] earlier had no intention of saying what
[1:38:41] i said earlier but look at this i
[1:38:43] charged you before god and the lord
[1:38:44] jesus christ how many is that
[1:38:46] i mean if you were to look at it with a
[1:38:48] carnal understanding that's two not
[1:38:50] three
[1:38:51] just like i was saying before
[1:38:53] anyway we'll move on from that i charge
[1:38:55] thee before god and the lord jesus
[1:38:57] christ someone without obviously
[1:38:58] revelation or understanding
[1:39:00] who shall judge the quick and the
[1:39:03] quick and the dead and his appearing in
[1:39:04] his kingdom
[1:39:06] preach the word be instant in season out
[1:39:08] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:39:10] long suffering and doctrine now that's
[1:39:12] preaching but we're all ministers we
[1:39:14] know that
[1:39:15] kings and priests
[1:39:16] yes amen we don't all get up here
[1:39:19] amen we know that that's a five-fold
[1:39:21] ministry but we're all ministers so the
[1:39:23] bible
[1:39:24] specifically is speaking to all of us
[1:39:27] preach the word
[1:39:28] the instant nc's not obscene reprove
[1:39:30] rebuke exhort with all long suffering
[1:39:32] and doctrine for the time will come when
[1:39:34] they will not endure sound doctrine but
[1:39:37] after their own lusts their own opinions
[1:39:39] their own feelings thoughts they shall
[1:39:41] heed to themselves teachers having
[1:39:44] itching ears greedy prideful
[1:39:46] amen just wanting of
[1:39:48] just wanting some stature
[1:39:50] wanting a position
[1:39:53] wanting money
[1:39:54] whatever it is
[1:39:56] and they shall turn away their ears from
[1:39:58] the truth and shall be turned unto
[1:40:01] fables now
[1:40:02] that's an introduction of
[1:40:05] hebrews 11 24 that we just went over
[1:40:07] last week it shall turn from the truth
[1:40:10] unto fable
[1:40:11] no more sacrifice for sin
[1:40:14] but it's very serious
[1:40:16] never to misinterpret the word
[1:40:18] amen now
[1:40:20] next week lord willing uh
[1:40:23] i want to try to bring it together
[1:40:26] because all these really do go together
[1:40:28] the dislocate the misplace probably go
[1:40:31] together more than the misinterpret but
[1:40:33] it all dovetails together in fact some
[1:40:36] things i've said today
[1:40:37] you will hear again next week
[1:40:40] just because of that fact but it's so
[1:40:42] important to keep that puzzle that
[1:40:45] picture
[1:40:46] perfect right
[1:40:48] uh the apples in the tree and the cow
[1:40:50] picking eating on the ground
[1:40:52] had the picture right to build the car
[1:40:54] right to put the pulpit together for it
[1:40:56] all to fit just perfectly right together
[1:41:00] it has to stay the way it said that god
[1:41:02] brought it amen
[1:41:06] holy ghost in our lives
[1:41:08] rightly divide that word to our hearts
[1:41:11] now there are sometimes just like even
[1:41:14] through the church ages it wasn't meant
[1:41:16] for luther to preach what brother
[1:41:18] branham preached
[1:41:19] it wasn't his lock to open or for the
[1:41:22] seals to be opened while he was here it
[1:41:24] wasn't
[1:41:25] he dabbled in it here and there wesley
[1:41:28] did
[1:41:29] but it wasn't for that see and sometimes
[1:41:31] that that is with us
[1:41:33] remember
[1:41:34] i i've told this quote before
[1:41:37] i'm closing here brother branham said
[1:41:39] that god will let you know as you have
[1:41:42] need of knowing it
[1:41:44] and maybe there's still things that you
[1:41:46] don't quite
[1:41:48] i'll just use the word understand even
[1:41:49] though that's not
[1:41:51] the proper word i like to use people
[1:41:53] normally use that word but i don't like
[1:41:55] to use it because it's not an
[1:41:56] understanding
[1:41:57] it's god opening itself revealing but
[1:42:00] there may be some of those i told you
[1:42:02] myself i still have things i know it's
[1:42:04] on the shelf i just you know i'm just
[1:42:06] waiting on the lord
[1:42:08] to bring this together and to dove tell
[1:42:10] it where it's where it belongs i i don't
[1:42:12] i don't want to take dove feathers and
[1:42:15] shove them in a crow
[1:42:16] and
[1:42:17] try to say he's a dog
[1:42:20] i i you know and that's exactly what
[1:42:22] people try to do with the word
[1:42:25] to try to prove their
[1:42:27] some great revelation somebody they'll
[1:42:29] take feathers out of a dub and shove
[1:42:31] them in a crow and say there he said
[1:42:32] dove no he's not
[1:42:35] you've hydrated or crossed that well you
[1:42:37] haven't hybrided you just
[1:42:39] become a
[1:42:40] fake
[1:42:42] he's a crow with a couple of dove
[1:42:44] feathers stuck in him
[1:42:46] but take it
[1:42:47] as god reveals it
[1:42:49] it'll be in its proper place
[1:42:51] it'll be put in its proper position and
[1:42:54] then it'll all continue on just perfect
[1:42:56] dovetailed exactly the way god wrote it
[1:42:58] and exactly the way he reveals it to us
[1:43:02] perfect
[1:43:03] amen that's our anchor that's our type
[1:43:06] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:43:17] praise the lord
[1:43:20] amen what a wonderful god he is too yes

[1:43:27] thy word david said
[1:43:30] is a lamp unto my feet alighted to my
[1:43:32] path
[1:43:33] and that word continues to illuminate
[1:43:35] our paths every day we walk through life
[1:43:38] as we go through life
[1:43:40] as god blesses us speaks to us
[1:43:42] even as we just
[1:43:44] just go on our daily lives
[1:43:46] amen we just go on our daily lives it's
[1:43:49] a it's a lamp to our feet light into our
[1:43:51] path how many times
[1:43:53] you've gone through life or you've gone
[1:43:55] a certain place and you're really not
[1:43:56] even thinking about the lord
[1:43:59] really you know you're just living your
[1:44:00] life
[1:44:01] you're going about and all of a sudden

[1:44:12] lot
