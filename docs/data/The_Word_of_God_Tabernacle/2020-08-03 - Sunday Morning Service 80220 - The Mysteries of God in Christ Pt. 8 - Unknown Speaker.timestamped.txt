[0:02] good morning everyone
[0:03] god bless you again today welcome to our
[0:05] home stream again
[0:07] it's kind of hoping to be in our uh new
[0:09] building today but
[0:10] unfortunately it didn't work out for us
[0:12] to be able to do that a little
[0:13] for an unforeseen complications we
[0:16] weren't expecting
[0:17] uh but we're so thankful the lord still
[0:19] provides this way of being able to
[0:21] try to feed the flock so that's the
[0:25] been my whole point and goal and um
[0:27] thankful that the lord
[0:28] provided to be able to do that um we're
[0:31] going to
[0:32] be a little bit longer on the church
[0:34] building uh
[0:35] i'll update you at the end of the
[0:37] service today but
[0:38] a couple announcements i want to make
[0:40] regarding that but i'm very thankful
[0:42] that the lord's blessed us with another
[0:43] beautiful
[0:44] day the time to get together and trust
[0:46] that you're there
[0:47] hope that you're there uh watching live
[0:50] you know it makes a big difference when
[0:51] you're watching live and
[0:52] we're kind of here at the same time
[0:54] together and i'm here and
[0:56] you're there and are all watching and
[0:58] kind of together in unity that way so
[1:01] uh it's good that you can archive and
[1:05] that that's good too but it's it's
[1:07] really different when we're all together
[1:08] and
[1:09] we're watching at the same time so i
[1:11] pray that you are watching and be a part
[1:13] of this today and
[1:14] certainly welcome you to our home and
[1:16] thank you for being a part of this today
[1:18] uh we want to go to the lord in prayer
[1:20] open this service
[1:21] prayer today and take a couple of prayer
[1:24] requests to the lord
[1:26] if you have anything on your heart of
[1:28] course you know it may be something
[1:29] unspoken
[1:31] just between you and the lord but we
[1:33] believe as we uphold one another in
[1:34] prayer continually that god answers
[1:37] hears and answers our prayer but a few
[1:39] requests
[1:40] want to mention audibly today we want to
[1:43] continue to remember brother donnie's
[1:45] uh daughter in prayer the lord would
[1:46] just continue to touch her i haven't
[1:48] heard any updates or anything
[1:50] as far as the cancer there but please
[1:52] remember continue to remember her
[1:53] in prayer also continuing member leah
[1:56] and prayer brother dennis's wife again
[1:58] working at the doctor's office there
[2:00] with the covet going on
[2:01] also to remember sister sheila's brother
[2:04] harlan in prayer
[2:05] uh lord would just have his way in and
[2:08] uh
[2:08] harlan's life and that god would have
[2:10] his hand upon him and
[2:12] also we want to can we want to remember
[2:14] today the
[2:15] maria family uh brother joel and
[2:20] joel senior joel jr uh crystal and
[2:24] isabel they
[2:25] all have come down with cobit and
[2:28] joel is a pretty serious condition right
[2:31] now in the hospital
[2:32] uh i even found out this morning that
[2:34] they put him in a coma
[2:36] uh to help his body rest and heal so
[2:39] and joel jr also had it and
[2:42] had come down with pneumonia he has gone
[2:45] home now
[2:46] uh so that's good thing uh but they kind
[2:49] of
[2:50] if they feel like they're going to
[2:52] they're on the road to recovery they
[2:54] send them home for the bed
[2:56] uh the bed availability uh so he
[2:59] still joel jr would still have a road
[3:01] ahead of him just continue to remember
[3:03] he's younger stronger
[3:04] of course but remember that family in
[3:05] prayer crystal of course going through
[3:08] uh quite the turmoil uh if i remember
[3:11] right isabelle
[3:12] has it but not showing any symptoms uh
[3:15] just
[3:16] kind of strange how this thing does you
[3:18] know but um
[3:19] it's all in the lord's hands uh god has
[3:22] his hand on it and
[3:23] it's up to him and it's according to his
[3:25] perfect will
[3:26] uh you know friend we uh sometimes we
[3:29] pray that
[3:30] you know the lord would just take this
[3:31] covet thing away and
[3:33] of course you know we kind of felt that
[3:34] way with so many of these things that
[3:36] came along and
[3:37] uh ebola and sars and
[3:40] aids and all these things is good god
[3:42] take it away but
[3:43] you know in a lot of ways i don't i
[3:46] don't think that's
[3:47] uh there's a purpose to that it kind of
[3:49] goes back to the message i'm
[3:51] sorry to prolong this but it kind of
[3:52] goes back to that message talked about
[3:54] where the children of israel
[3:56] uh had um had uh um
[3:59] you know spoke against god against moses
[4:01] and god sent fiery serpents and killed
[4:04] many of them
[4:05] uh when god gave them a way of
[4:07] deliverance
[4:08] he didn't take away the fiery serpents
[4:11] the fiery serpent
[4:12] stayed there he just gave them an
[4:14] atonement you just gave them a way of
[4:16] escape
[4:17] honestly my opinion i'm no doctor or
[4:20] i didn't get this spiritually inspired
[4:23] this is just how i feel
[4:24] this is probably going to be something
[4:26] that comes uh
[4:27] like the cold flu that's just going to
[4:30] be in humanity probably till the end
[4:33] um you know they'll probably come out
[4:35] with some kind of vaccine or something
[4:37] whatever they're doing
[4:39] but it'll probably be eventually
[4:42] in my opinion probably eventually
[4:44] everybody will get it at some point in
[4:45] time
[4:46] um but god is our protector
[4:49] god watches after us god keeps us and
[4:52] i'm so thankful that he does and even
[4:54] when
[4:55] different ones that we love and know get
[4:56] into situations like this
[4:58] we know that god's hand is on it and we
[5:00] just pray for him and just trust and
[5:02] believe god's going to continue to have
[5:04] his way and it'll manifest
[5:05] whatever his desire is it for it to be
[5:08] so but let's just again continue to
[5:10] remember the muriel family in prayer
[5:12] at uh god's hand would be upon them
[5:15] and uh all the prayer requests that
[5:17] we've had the needs
[5:18] we're all uh very of blessed people
[5:21] today
[5:22] we're thankful that god blesses us you
[5:23] know our church has been
[5:25] uh so little touched by this thing
[5:29] uh you know people have had their jobs
[5:32] and even gotten busier and
[5:34] uh you know the uh
[5:38] zach had it there for a little bit but
[5:39] very little symptoms and got over it
[5:41] quick
[5:42] and went back to work and it's just
[5:44] god's just really blessed us and i'm so
[5:46] thankful that he has uh god's hand is
[5:48] upon us and i appreciate the lord jesus

[8:25] amen amen god bless you now
[8:28] i want to turn in our bibles uh i want
[8:31] to turn
[8:32] our bibles now and go back again we're
[8:34] going to uh go with part eight
[8:36] of uh the mysteries of god in christ
[8:39] part eight
[8:40] and god revealing himself to his people
[8:42] part four
[8:43] i told you last week i was hoping to try
[8:45] to finish
[8:46] this section of it last week and uh just
[8:49] wasn't able to with just
[8:51] a lot of things in there and again i
[8:53] don't want to rush and i want to jam
[8:55] things in there and
[8:56] you know we have time and uh we're in
[8:58] the position to be able to
[9:00] do what the lord puts on our hearts so
[9:03] just trust it's a blessing to you
[9:04] today so we're going to try again to
[9:07] finish this
[9:08] part up um uh so we can get to
[9:11] the next part so uh which is uh god
[9:14] having his preeminence and his people
[9:16] but now god revealing himself to his
[9:17] people part four let's start with
[9:19] revelation chapter 10 verse 7 as we
[9:22] normally do here in the scripture but in
[9:24] the days of the voice of the seventh
[9:26] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[9:29] mystery of god should be finished as he
[9:31] had declared to his servants the
[9:33] prophets
[9:34] amen then we of course gone through and
[9:36] understand that that mystery and what
[9:38] that mystery
[9:39] is that mystery is christ in christ is
[9:42] all the mysteries
[9:44] that we know that's been hid from ages
[9:46] and generations
[9:47] in the scripture god condensating
[9:49] himself
[9:50] bringing himself down so we read genesis
[9:53] 1
[9:54] uh in through the scripture and uh
[9:57] john and uh we're going to read some
[9:59] more scripture but i want to go back to
[10:01] melchizedek today
[10:02] of course we found out how you know and
[10:05] there's way more times
[10:06] obviously referenced christ in genesis
[10:09] but we just
[10:10] pulled out a few of them uh to try to
[10:13] bring reference to that to see that
[10:14] even god even then was was showing
[10:18] himself what he was going to do and and
[10:20] as god reveals himself and shows us
[10:23] in his word what he's doing it helps us
[10:25] it gives us comfort and know that
[10:28] that the lord is taking care of that and
[10:29] helping bringing if he's in his mind
[10:32] way back then friend can't you think
[10:33] that he's it's you're on his mind now
[10:36] and that what he's doing and the
[10:37] redemption plan
[10:38] is is for us and the process that we
[10:40] play in it
[10:41] you know it's going to bring us into
[10:43] perfect view this next
[10:45] few services or god having his
[10:47] preeminence and his people that that
[10:49] begins to bring
[10:50] into light exactly who this bride is the
[10:53] the job that she has to do with the
[10:55] and the part that she has to play in all
[10:57] this friend we don't become christians
[10:59] and just sit on the sea to do nothing
[11:01] this is the part that we play that god's
[11:02] put in our lives he's done all this for
[11:04] a reason
[11:05] and for a purpose and we are to fulfill
[11:08] and finish
[11:08] up that purpose i say finish up because
[11:10] we're at the rapture time
[11:12] we're not the beginning of this we're in
[11:14] the middle of this we're at the end of
[11:15] this
[11:16] and so but we're just bringing him down
[11:18] looking at the scripture through here
[11:20] and
[11:20] and just a few points few of the
[11:22] highlights so many more
[11:24] things and i think the lord shows me
[11:27] different ones i think and
[11:28] and here brother brown say different
[11:29] ones i think lord if i keep bringing all
[11:31] these others out
[11:32] this is gonna go on for weeks uh so
[11:35] we're just
[11:35] we're just gonna get this couple things
[11:37] and again hopefully finish this today
[11:39] but we're gonna go back to melchizedek
[11:41] and and look at this and god manifesting
[11:44] himself in theophany form here
[11:46] back to um hebrews chapter six
[11:50] we're going to begin reading with verse
[11:52] 20 again
[11:54] and uh and just hit these highlights
[11:56] here of melchizedek again before we go
[11:58] forward on hopefully
[11:59] uh lord william won't be quite as long
[12:02] as last week but just however the lord
[12:03] leads so
[12:04] again i just trust it'd be a blessing to
[12:06] you hebrews chapter six
[12:08] hope you got your bibles there with us
[12:09] right now hebrews chapter 6 verse 20 as
[12:12] we read together
[12:14] uh whether whether the forerunner is for
[12:17] us entered uh that is to say he has the
[12:20] forerunner has entered for us
[12:21] on our behalf even jesus who entered in
[12:25] who so the forerunner is entered in for
[12:28] us even jesus made a high priest forever
[12:32] after the order of melchizedek
[12:34] now melchizedek we know uh it's strange
[12:39] because melchizedek and it's even
[12:42] spelled different in the old testament
[12:43] but melchizedek
[12:45] is not mentioned but one place in the
[12:48] bible
[12:49] from genesis to hebrews only david
[12:52] mentions in one time i think it's psalms
[12:55] 110 he david mentions melchizedek but
[12:59] it's not even mentioned
[13:00] in the bible until we get to the hebrews
[13:03] till we get to the hebrew series of paul
[13:05] breaking this
[13:06] down going so far back into hebrews to
[13:09] to describe and to talk about jesus
[13:12] christ to bring from the old testament
[13:15] and and those jews from the torah to
[13:18] relevate that back to where
[13:20] it was at the current time so you see
[13:22] what he's doing pulling in
[13:24] way back even from genesis 14 is the
[13:26] first place that we find melchizedek
[13:28] over to that current standing that they
[13:30] were in at that time
[13:32] and paul is trying to bring this out to
[13:34] see even this melchizedek
[13:35] jesus christ was after that order going
[13:39] all the way back that far
[13:41] so this this great individual that's
[13:43] spoken of
[13:44] uh with these great attributes that
[13:47] we're going to read again
[13:49] of melchizedek has spoken of so few
[13:52] times in the scripture but there's a
[13:55] reason for that
[13:56] see is to catch the visions you got you
[13:58] got to catch that revelation
[14:00] see here but if we go back to uh genesis
[14:03] chapter 14 which i will in a minute
[14:05] we'll see that's where melchizedek is
[14:08] picked up in the scripture but now
[14:09] goes all the way through except for the
[14:11] one time and david said in
[14:13] in the psalms all the way to hebrews
[14:16] chapter six
[14:17] now or hebrews i think he mentions him
[14:19] in chapter five
[14:20] too uh if i remember right but anyway
[14:22] hebrews
[14:23] the hebrew series uh that he brings this
[14:26] this melchizedek back up well what's he
[14:29] doing that for you to help us
[14:30] understand that he's bringing god jesus
[14:34] christ the reference and knowledge
[14:36] jesus christ god revealing himself back
[14:39] from
[14:39] then genesis 14 into this current day
[14:43] and what we're doing here what brother
[14:45] branham did 50 60 years ago
[14:47] what we're doing here is to bring him up
[14:50] again
[14:50] update see we're not serving a god of
[14:53] history
[14:54] he is a god of history but we're not
[14:55] serving a god of history we're serving a
[14:58] living god we're serving a current
[15:00] present
[15:01] now living resurrected savior who's
[15:04] alive
[15:04] in you revealing himself to his people
[15:07] yet today
[15:08] see so as paul did that brother bannon
[15:12] did it and down through the scripture
[15:13] bringing us into this day right now
[15:16] today
[15:17] so that we see who he is for this day
[15:20] now of course i encourage you to go back
[15:22] because it won't be
[15:23] i won't dig into it as much as brother
[15:26] branham did but
[15:27] did but uh go back and listen to who is
[15:29] this melchizedek
[15:31] and that'll even help you more but now
[15:33] let's go on
[15:34] jesus christ made in high priest after
[15:38] the order
[15:39] of melchizedek after the order of
[15:42] melchizedek
[15:43] we'll go back to in just a minute for
[15:46] this melchizedek
[15:48] king of salem priest of the most high
[15:51] god who met abraham returning from the
[15:54] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[15:56] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[15:59] of all now again remember
[16:01] and look at these parts that is very
[16:04] specific about melchizedek
[16:06] that is bringing out the the adjectives
[16:08] the descriptions
[16:10] uh that that paul gives under
[16:12] inspiration is in his holy writ today
[16:14] of who melchizedek was and it says the
[16:17] priest
[16:18] the most high god now if you if you go
[16:21] to um
[16:22] even theologians and doc bible scholars
[16:25] and doctors of divinity
[16:27] uh still don't know
[16:30] and you'll never know without revelation
[16:32] whom elk hezek was
[16:34] or he came from or he went to what
[16:37] happened between genesis 14 and hebrews
[16:40] uh what is this order how does this come
[16:42] about they
[16:43] they just don't know they think it may
[16:45] be a priesthood i think that was
[16:46] scofield if you read schofield notes
[16:48] they think it was just a priesthood a
[16:51] priesthood that of course
[16:52] if it's a priesthood it didn't have a
[16:55] father or mother
[16:56] but see this said it didn't even have a
[16:58] beginning
[16:59] melchizedek didn't have a beginning well
[17:01] if it's if it's an order of a priesthood
[17:03] it had to happen
[17:04] i hadn't have a beginning because again
[17:06] remember the only thing
[17:08] we know we know by revelation the only
[17:11] one that does
[17:12] not have a beginning and does not have
[17:14] an end is god
[17:15] period god is the elohim eternal
[17:18] almighty god
[17:19] he's the only one that is eternal no
[17:22] beginning no ending no father no mother
[17:24] see so the description really helps us
[17:27] to understand who this
[17:29] is and we can go and take this back to
[17:32] isaiah 9 as we did
[17:34] when when jesus was prophesied to come
[17:36] forth the most
[17:37] perfect sacrifice that was to come forth
[17:40] see
[17:42] it's these uh these descriptions king of
[17:44] sam priest the most high god who met
[17:46] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[17:48] the kings blessed him
[17:49] to whom also abraham gave the tenth part
[17:51] of all now god's
[17:52] prophet god's servant god's son is not
[17:55] going to give a tenth part of the
[17:57] tithing
[17:58] of the spoils to just anybody because he
[18:00] knows that's god's money
[18:02] see by revelation see everything he did
[18:05] bring it through types and shadows for
[18:06] us to see today
[18:08] first being by interpretation king of
[18:10] righteousness and after that also king
[18:12] of salem which is king of peace
[18:14] without father without mother without
[18:18] descent
[18:19] having neither beginning of days nor end
[18:21] of life but made like unto the son of
[18:23] god abideth the priest continually
[18:26] now if you don't have the godhead
[18:28] correctly
[18:29] if you think there's three gods if you
[18:31] believe in some trinity out there that
[18:33] jesus is the second person of the
[18:35] godhead or something and
[18:37] then you're never going to be able to
[18:39] understand and get the revelation
[18:42] of who melchizedek was and fit this into
[18:45] that
[18:46] because if you can't do that then then
[18:48] it doesn't fit because melchizedek
[18:51] is being brought in and jesus described
[18:54] as the self-same person the self-same
[18:57] order
[18:58] together see if you if you if you don't
[19:01] see this by revelation the godhead then
[19:04] then then none of it can become clear to
[19:06] you so hopefully
[19:08] certainly that makes sense because it
[19:10] says he's without father without mother
[19:12] without descent either having beginning
[19:14] of days or end of life
[19:15] he's eternal it wasn't beginning wasn't
[19:19] ending well
[19:20] there's only one he could be talking
[19:21] about
[19:23] everything else has been created
[19:24] everything else has come forth
[19:26] only that that's issued from the eternal
[19:28] one as in
[19:29] eternity is can be considered or as is
[19:33] eternal see never had a beginning and
[19:35] never had anything it's just like us
[19:37] i had a beginning i had an ending or
[19:39] we'll have an ending see
[19:42] but in but that part of me who i am and
[19:44] god
[19:45] never had a beginning because that
[19:47] thought of that attribute who god is
[19:49] that he placed in me the real person
[19:51] that i am the real person that you are
[19:53] that part of god is in you is eternal
[19:55] the only part of you that could be
[19:56] eternal
[19:57] that's why the bible says from dust you
[19:59] are the dust you'll return
[20:01] see there's a beginning to that there'll
[20:02] be an end to that but of god
[20:05] and of that life of that attribute there
[20:08] was no beginning there can be no end
[20:10] that's the only reason
[20:11] the only way we can have eternal life is
[20:13] because it's
[20:14] his life it's the only thing that's
[20:16] eternally it's not our life that's
[20:18] eternal
[20:18] it's his life that's eternal and we are
[20:21] who we are
[20:22] just simply because we're attributes of
[20:24] him
[20:25] praise the lord thou father mother see
[20:28] uh
[20:29] uh abideth the priest continually like
[20:31] unto the son of god abideth the priest
[20:33] continually
[20:34] now consider how great this man was now
[20:38] it's like i said last week now if you
[20:39] didn't catch this
[20:41] uh remember again i'll reiterate if you
[20:43] look and you see italicized words or
[20:46] blocked off words in your bible
[20:47] different bibles do it different ways
[20:49] i had the old scofield uh king james
[20:52] version
[20:54] it's highlighted or italicized i should
[20:56] say if it's italicized that's not a word
[20:59] in the original transcript
[21:01] it is added to for the flow of the
[21:04] reader
[21:05] it's it's for the reader to be able to
[21:07] read it it flows better when they add
[21:09] these certain words in there and this is
[21:11] one of those words that's added
[21:13] because that and it just when i was
[21:14] studying this the other day it really
[21:16] struck me as the
[21:18] as the way scofield put this now
[21:19] consider how great this man
[21:21] was he tries to make melchizedek a past
[21:25] tense but he's not a past tense
[21:28] he is a present tense he is a perpetual
[21:32] continual existence
[21:34] so if you take the was out it says
[21:38] now consider how great this man
[21:41] praise the lord that just means he's
[21:44] self-existing
[21:45] he's self-uh uh uh uh
[21:48] existing he he never began never ends
[21:52] perpetual always existed how great this
[21:56] man period praise the lord unto whom
[22:00] even the patriarch abraham gave the
[22:02] tenth of the spoils
[22:05] and verily that there are the sons of
[22:07] levi who received the office of the
[22:08] priesthood have a commandment to take
[22:10] ties to people according to the law that
[22:12] is
[22:13] of their brethren though they come out
[22:14] of the loins of abraham but he whose
[22:16] descent
[22:17] is not counted from them uh from them
[22:20] received ties of abraham blessed him
[22:22] that had promised and without all
[22:25] contradiction the lest
[22:26] is better uh blessed the better and here
[22:29] men that die receive
[22:31] tithes but there he receiveth them of
[22:33] whom it is witness that he liveth
[22:35] and as i say as i may so say
[22:39] levi also who received tithes paid
[22:41] tithes in
[22:42] abraham for he was yet in the launch of
[22:44] his father
[22:45] whom uh when he met melchi when milk has
[22:48] ignored him now
[22:49] that of course um don't want to get into
[22:51] a tight teaching but to help you
[22:53] understand that
[22:54] ministry pays ties to receive tithes pay
[22:57] times
[22:58] same thing but now let's go back to this
[23:01] melchizedek
[23:02] let's catch him here in the first
[23:04] reading that we have in genesis 14.
[23:07] let's try to catch melchizedek and see
[23:10] if we can't find a couple of things here
[23:13] that coincide with it
[23:16] that help us help us understand who who
[23:19] he
[23:19] is this spirit remember we've already
[23:23] gotten in
[23:23] to the logos that spirit of god that
[23:26] come out
[23:27] and and came into word form
[23:31] uh a fiat form um
[23:35] look at this now um
[23:38] genesis 14 verse 18 and melchizedek king
[23:42] of salem
[23:44] brought forth bread and wine and this is
[23:46] after the slaughter of the kings
[23:48] the king of sodom had just met him after
[23:50] this after the slaughter after the
[23:52] victorious son abraham come and rescued
[23:54] his
[23:55] nephew lot out of being captured uh
[23:58] abraham goes and rescues him and after
[24:00] his the victorious son comes forth
[24:03] abraham
[24:04] he comes forth melchizedek meets him
[24:07] as he comes forth after after being
[24:10] victorious
[24:11] and winning the battle praise the lord
[24:14] after abraham has met the enemy and won
[24:17] the battle
[24:18] melchizedek meets him and brings him
[24:22] bread and wine king of salem
[24:25] brought forth bread and wine and he was
[24:28] the priest of the most high god
[24:31] now why would melchizedek bring
[24:34] abraham now remember abraham just
[24:38] fought a battle abraham just came forth
[24:41] victorious
[24:43] and melchizedek comes out and meets the
[24:46] victorious
[24:47] abraham with bread and wine
[24:50] it was a celebratory thing to celebrate
[24:54] and prefigure the the communion
[24:58] that we have today
[25:02] god melchizedek that spirit
[25:06] making himself known in a victorious way
[25:10] with abraham
[25:12] by giving of himself the bread and wine
[25:15] which is the typical
[25:16] ceremonial service that we hold today
[25:19] remember
[25:20] uh one of the ordinances divine
[25:22] ordinances that god left to us was the
[25:24] communion
[25:25] the the bread and wine melchizedek comes
[25:29] and meets abraham
[25:31] with this celebratory
[25:34] communion with this celebratory
[25:37] ordinance that we see here he shows him
[25:41] which just helps us now we can just take
[25:43] a minute on this communion
[25:45] because first of all the communion is
[25:48] ordinance
[25:49] to us to take and jesus tells us that
[25:52] it's in the bible it means how many
[25:54] places it tells us
[25:55] and brother branham tells us is one of
[25:57] the ordinances left
[25:58] for us to partake of and that's what we
[26:00] do and lord willing
[26:02] we get back in our building it's going
[26:03] to be one of the first things we do
[26:05] by the grace of god let's have communion
[26:06] foot washed again but this
[26:08] this is this is something that's ordered
[26:11] of god to his children
[26:13] and what it does is it helps us finalize
[26:16] see in the scripture how that god's
[26:19] children are in a battle and we wrestle
[26:23] it out every day
[26:24] every day of our lives now the real
[26:27] communion is the fellowship
[26:29] that we have with god that's our real
[26:31] community and that's a
[26:32] daily thing that we do but the lord's
[26:34] supper we take is a ceremonial
[26:37] uh representation of the sacrifice the
[26:40] true sacrifice which was jesus christ
[26:43] amen as jesus christ came from
[26:45] melchizedek
[26:47] and a word body into a physical body
[26:50] that victorious wrestling that we do
[26:53] every day
[26:54] helps us in light of having that
[26:56] communion and fellowship with the lord
[26:59] that's what our communion is about we
[27:02] have
[27:02] we wrestle it out we fight every day
[27:06] demons devils spirits every day
[27:09] in this world in this life and and
[27:12] sometimes more adversely than others but
[27:14] we're always
[27:15] in a battle every day and we as god's
[27:18] children and with his help come out
[27:20] victorious
[27:21] every day every day even though it may
[27:24] not look like it we come forth
[27:26] victorious every day
[27:27] wrestle it out and come in communion
[27:31] fellowship with the lord jesus that's
[27:34] what we have
[27:35] that ceremony that time that fellowship
[27:39] melchizedek came forth and met him
[27:42] personally
[27:43] amen god used to come down with abra
[27:46] with adam in the cool of the day amen of
[27:49] course adam didn't have the wrestle that
[27:51] we have till after the fall but
[27:53] he come down and fellowship with him in
[27:54] the cool of the day but after abraham
[27:56] come
[27:57] forth as a victorious son
[28:00] god met him there and brought the bread
[28:03] and wine for them to fellowship together
[28:06] it was a ceremonial thing and look at
[28:08] this where they
[28:10] had the communion was right on the
[28:12] literal
[28:13] grounds of where the new jerusalem is
[28:16] going to be set up
[28:18] right in the same spot with that that
[28:21] pyramid shaped mountain is going to come
[28:23] forth in the new city holy
[28:25] the holy city the new jerusalem is going
[28:27] to come down on
[28:28] adorned as a bride for her husband is
[28:30] going to be right there on the exact
[28:33] spot
[28:34] where melchizedek may met abraham the
[28:37] victorious son
[28:38] to have fellowship to have communion
[28:41] together
[28:42] oh just think about when we reach that
[28:44] city friend
[28:45] oh the battle is going to be over then
[28:49] it's going to be the supreme uh
[28:51] ceremonial
[28:52] fellowship and and celebratory time to
[28:56] come together the wedding supper is
[28:57] going to be great the millennium's going
[28:59] to be great but ma'am
[29:01] the saints when we get to that place
[29:03] it's it's going to be the finalization
[29:05] of the perfect place that god is set up
[29:08] for his children
[29:09] oh my oh god we can look forward to that
[29:12] time frame but god's telling us about
[29:14] that here in genesis 14
[29:16] god met his son abraham to have
[29:19] communion
[29:20] together to have fellowship together
[29:24] he brought the bread and wine giving of
[29:26] himself
[29:27] helping him see and it's the son of god
[29:30] i'm sure he didn't see it all but he saw
[29:32] a part of it like we see today that we
[29:34] can realize
[29:35] the perfect sacrifice jesus christ was
[29:38] going to come for amen
[29:40] because melchizedek came forth here as
[29:43] we say
[29:44] uh in a in a theophany
[29:48] in a spoken word body in a in a word
[29:52] body
[29:52] amen that was what that was
[29:56] and you can think of all the forms that
[29:58] that god has made himself in
[30:00] and we could go from here and you can
[30:03] see
[30:04] over in genesis 18 where
[30:07] he takes uh with just a couple of angels
[30:09] with him and say michael and gabriel
[30:11] with him
[30:12] and the three of them come down and meet
[30:14] abraham again and abraham knows exactly
[30:16] who he is
[30:17] because he goes right to him and says my
[30:19] lord
[30:20] he knew exactly who he was what do you
[30:22] think that was it's the one he just met
[30:24] here in
[30:25] genesis 14 after you come forth from the
[30:27] sword of the kings
[30:29] it's the same one god
[30:32] speaking himself something to step into
[30:35] so he could go and present himself
[30:37] before his son abraham
[30:40] same one that meant moses well he was in
[30:42] the burning bush to start with
[30:44] but then moses wanted to see him so bad
[30:46] god went by his head hit him in the
[30:48] cliff
[30:48] rock hid moses face so he could walk by
[30:51] and all he saw was behind the part of
[30:52] the man
[30:53] well who was that i mean joe saw him in
[30:56] the whirlwind
[30:57] uh uh the children of israel cloud by
[31:01] day if hillary fire by night
[31:03] uh we talked about last week how saul
[31:05] saw the cloud
[31:07] and and the clouds spoke and he said who
[31:09] are you lord
[31:10] just like abraham said abraham when the
[31:13] three of them come he said my lord
[31:15] when the when the clouds spoke to saul
[31:18] he said my lord
[31:20] he said who are you he said i'm jesus
[31:23] praise the lord oh friend how can we not
[31:27] see how perfect continuity the word
[31:30] the word flows together
[31:33] it's the same god and god can come at
[31:36] any place at any time
[31:37] oh people grapple and they fight and
[31:39] fuss about the cloud and all this
[31:41] praying god can do whatever he wants so
[31:43] while the time has to be here and i had
[31:45] to be at that place and had to do this
[31:47] and no i didn't
[31:48] god can make it however he wants to make
[31:50] it he can go anywhere anytime do
[31:52] anything
[31:53] anywhere he wants to do at any time and
[31:55] he's not going to consult you about it
[31:57] because he's going to do what he wants
[31:58] to do because he's god
[32:00] he knows exactly what when and how to do
[32:02] it and who am i to question him
[32:04] that's god's decision god can do it
[32:06] however he wants to it's his choice
[32:08] amen and he can come in any form he
[32:10] wants to
[32:11] god spoke through a donkey one time
[32:14] god spoke through a bush one time god
[32:17] speaks out of clouds
[32:19] he can do it any way he wants saints how
[32:21] many more times
[32:22] places times things you can find ezekiel
[32:25] looked up and saw him as a wheel in the
[32:27] middle of a wheel
[32:29] jesus christ and all the spokes coming
[32:32] off of
[32:32] off of him that one the supreme one
[32:37] oh you can't put god in the box
[32:40] he can do it however he wants to we're
[32:42] just looking at this and understanding
[32:44] how god can just speak and create
[32:46] something he can step
[32:47] into that spirit body can have something
[32:50] to dwell in for a moment
[32:52] just for a moment and then come forth
[32:55] he can bring a ceremonial bread and wine
[32:58] to have a ceremony he can meet abraham
[33:02] in the in the tent door and have meat
[33:04] and
[33:05] and wine and fellowship uh
[33:08] but then but that but it wasn't to the
[33:11] place that
[33:12] that supreme sacrifice could be
[33:15] because remember jesus had to come in a
[33:18] corporal body
[33:20] not a spoken body but a created blood
[33:23] seed body
[33:24] the seed of the woman genesis 3
[33:28] last week the seed of the woman had to
[33:30] call forth
[33:31] a created blood seed body
[33:35] in the womb of a woman to come forth
[33:38] to bring forth jesus christ the only way
[33:41] he could come
[33:42] to bring redemption to the human race
[33:45] amen but before we get further
[33:48] uh in into that i want to read you this
[33:52] uh that brother brown talked about who
[33:54] is this melchizedek
[33:55] this kind of sums it up and lord willing
[33:58] this we'll just sum this up with this
[34:00] and we'll move on
[34:02] as we get to that place and
[34:03] understanding who
[34:05] really this melchizedek was who this
[34:09] this individual that confounds the most
[34:12] intelligent
[34:13] most studied learned scholar a divinity
[34:17] bible knowing people could not find
[34:20] could not see
[34:22] but listen this why did he come
[34:27] abraham being the one with the promise
[34:29] and the message of the coming son
[34:31] and also he was god's word prophet
[34:35] that was trusting god's word calling
[34:38] anything
[34:39] that was trusting god's word calling
[34:41] anything contrary
[34:43] as though it wasn't now look the
[34:46] differentiation
[34:47] between someone that calls themselves a
[34:49] prophet
[34:51] which is a very loose terminology really
[34:53] it's taken in high regard a lot of times
[34:55] but it's a very loose
[34:57] understanding of translation but a god
[34:59] sent word prophet
[35:00] is going to stay with god's word period
[35:04] they don't stay with god's word they're
[35:05] not god's prophet
[35:08] see how perfect the word is the word
[35:11] came to the prophet
[35:13] he's talking about melchizedek coming to
[35:15] abraham
[35:16] the word melchizedek came to the prophet
[35:19] see
[35:20] there was god in a theophany
[35:24] the bible says the word comes to the
[35:26] prophet
[35:28] and there he was the word in
[35:31] the theophany a word body
[35:34] housing the almighty to come and meet
[35:37] his
[35:38] victorious son abraham and brought up
[35:41] communion
[35:43] served him of his of his own self
[35:46] now you say what uh was that god abraham
[35:50] said it was he said his name he called
[35:51] him elohim
[35:52] now in genesis 1 you find the elohim
[35:54] created the heaven and the earth
[35:56] genesis 18 abraham called this person
[35:58] sat there talk with him could tell his
[36:00] secrets of his heart tell what sarah was
[36:02] thinking behind him
[36:04] abraham said it is elohim he was
[36:07] in a theophany form or a word body
[36:11] it was a spoken word body that was just
[36:14] created
[36:15] it wasn't a hemoglobin created blood
[36:19] cell
[36:20] human body there's a difference there
[36:23] amen this was just a spoken word out of
[36:25] the dust
[36:26] and indigos jesus was that
[36:30] was that spoken germ seed blood cell
[36:34] body in the womb of mary that brought
[36:37] forth a
[36:38] human flesh in the likeness of sinful
[36:41] flesh nothing simple about the offany
[36:44] body
[36:45] amen and and and and shall i say
[36:48] each one of us those that are believers
[36:51] those that are a part of god
[36:53] have that theophany body waiting for us
[36:55] as well
[36:56] that word body we just bypassed
[37:00] our theophanies to go from the attribute
[37:02] of god
[37:03] down into these human flesh bodies to be
[37:06] tempted tried
[37:07] but when the flesh drops off of this he
[37:10] said
[37:11] when this earthly tabernacle be
[37:13] dissolved we have one that's waiting
[37:15] that is of the heavens
[37:17] we have a created word body a theophany
[37:20] waiting for us just to step from here
[37:24] to here is just a step
[37:27] from here to here amen this body can no
[37:30] longer hold us
[37:32] but we go into that word body we go into
[37:34] that theophany
[37:35] that body that's been prepared for us
[37:37] before the foundation of the world
[37:40] we just bypass it to come into this
[37:42] human body
[37:43] he was in theophany form that word body
[37:46] see now
[37:47] we find out that he was in the theophany
[37:50] form he called him
[37:51] lord god elohim genesis 18.
[37:55] now notice abraham there was three of
[37:57] them together but when abraham met the
[37:59] three he said
[38:00] my lord and we've gone over that i
[38:03] understand
[38:03] he looked at that there was only one
[38:05] there the others weren't his lord it was
[38:07] just the one that was his lord
[38:09] god melchizedek that spirit that same
[38:13] logo see but when lot down in sodom two
[38:16] of them went down there
[38:18] and lot saw the two of them coming he
[38:20] said my lords
[38:22] plural see what was the matter the first
[38:24] place
[38:25] locke was not a prophet that's right
[38:26] neither was he a messenger
[38:28] messenger of the hour so he didn't have
[38:30] any revelation of him
[38:32] is exactly right lot called them lords a
[38:34] dozen of them
[38:35] he would have still said lords but no
[38:37] matter how many
[38:38] abraham saw it was still
[38:42] one lord there is god
[38:45] this was the melchizedek
[38:49] amen this was the melchizedek
[38:53] the same one notice after the battle was
[38:56] over melchizedek
[38:58] served his victorious child communion
[39:00] think of that
[39:01] part of himself been hitting that now
[39:04] now we want to sir
[39:05] uh to see here and type into view the
[39:08] communion after the battle
[39:10] he gave him himself because the
[39:12] communion is part of christ we do it as
[39:14] a ceremonial form not as the literal
[39:16] body
[39:17] but a ceremonial form as a as an
[39:20] ordinance that god left us that we
[39:22] partake of
[39:23] amen that's a part of our continual
[39:25] victory
[39:26] our continuous victory communion and
[39:28] fellowship with the lord jesus on a
[39:30] daily basis as we battle it out
[39:32] wrestle it out we come forth victorious
[39:34] with the help of almighty god
[39:36] and we commune with him on it we
[39:38] fellowship with him on it
[39:40] praise the lord have that daily
[39:41] communion but then we have that
[39:43] ceremonial time
[39:44] that we partake of the wine and the
[39:46] bread that ordinance that god gave us
[39:48] that's that time together that we take
[39:51] that's a part of him
[39:52] we consider part of him
[39:55] and after the struggle is over and after
[39:57] you've got got
[39:58] uh and after you've done got yourself
[40:01] whipped out
[40:01] then is when you partake of christ
[40:03] become part of this being
[40:06] amen after you've whipped it out and
[40:08] become part of this being
[40:10] and won that victory amen that's when we
[40:13] become
[40:14] victorious in the lord jesus
[40:18] that's our victory the battle has been
[40:20] won yes we know we are more than
[40:22] conquerors but we're still conquerors
[40:25] we're only conquerors because he
[40:27] conquered for us and made us more than
[40:28] conquerors but we still have the
[40:30] conquering to do
[40:32] we still have the battle again it's not
[40:34] the setting on the sea to do nothing we
[40:36] have the battles to fight too
[40:38] we have the battles to win and with his
[40:40] help we always
[40:42] uh we always come out victorious amen
[40:45] now
[40:45] let's look at the condescension let's
[40:49] look and finalize this condensation
[40:51] today
[40:53] jesus christ we just talked about jesus
[40:55] christ coming in
[40:57] body form it's not the spoken word
[41:00] theophany word body
[41:02] it was a body that was created by the
[41:04] spoke by god's creation
[41:06] yes spoken of a blood cell
[41:10] a literal blood cell in the womb of a
[41:12] woman
[41:13] to bring forth a human baby in the
[41:17] likeness of sinful flesh
[41:19] now we read this uh we read
[41:22] which was to which was to be the perfect
[41:25] supreme sacrifice something that was
[41:28] sinless
[41:31] and had the ability to take away
[41:34] the sin of the soul the darkness of the
[41:38] soul
[41:39] now the body too unfortunately we you
[41:41] know body spirit would benefit
[41:43] but the but the the thing that god is
[41:46] most concerned with
[41:47] is the soul not not the body not the
[41:50] spirit those
[41:51] part of it of course that is of that is
[41:53] of our desire
[41:54] and need we we bring that under
[41:56] subjection by the spirit of god
[41:58] but god's coming to get the soul the
[42:00] soul is the real you
[42:02] that's that part of god that was him and
[42:04] had to be before the foundation's world
[42:06] that's what he's coming to get
[42:07] that's who you really are so the
[42:10] darkness of that soul had to be
[42:12] cleansed and the blood of a bull or a
[42:16] goat or a lamb back in genesis 3 21
[42:19] could not satisfy that again remember
[42:22] the sacrifice was the
[42:23] the original sin was a blood sin so the
[42:26] sacrifice had to be a blood sacrifice
[42:28] but it had to be a sacrifice now
[42:30] those lambs were innocent yes but the
[42:32] lambs didn't have a soul
[42:33] animals didn't have a soul the bulls
[42:35] goats but jesus christ come forth in
[42:38] human flesh
[42:39] and the likeness of sinful places a
[42:41] human with a soul
[42:43] to be able to live sinless to take his
[42:45] our sins
[42:46] upon him and we read this before
[42:50] saint john chapter one we see here in
[42:53] saint john chapter one
[42:54] in the beginning we went to this uh back
[42:57] when we read genesis 1
[42:58] 1 was the word that word greek
[43:02] is logos that word that comes forth and
[43:05] we talked about what the logos is and
[43:07] read it to you again here logos
[43:09] is a thought or concept a thought or
[43:12] concept or the expression or
[43:13] utterance of that thought expression or
[43:17] utterance of that thought
[43:18] that thought or concept well that was
[43:20] god in the beginning was the word
[43:22] that fault concept the utterance of that
[43:25] come forth
[43:26] now in hebrews 11 it says that
[43:30] by the word of god the worlds were
[43:33] framed
[43:34] by the word of god now that's not logos
[43:37] that's rhema
[43:38] but it's the result of what has been
[43:40] spoken what we see today
[43:42] is a result of what has been spoken
[43:44] god's word
[43:46] and you see we talked about logos rhema
[43:48] just briefly before
[43:50] but you see the difference see now that
[43:51] was the result of what was spoken now
[43:54] in the beginning was the word that's the
[43:55] existence of god
[43:57] it's kind of like god's love uh agapo
[44:01] agape
[44:02] uh is one is a noun and one is a verb
[44:06] one exists because god exists the other
[44:09] exists because it's god in action
[44:11] it's actually a manifestation of it this
[44:14] is the same thing
[44:15] see this word is the existence of god in
[44:18] the beginning was the word
[44:19] his existence period
[44:22] the word was with god and the word was
[44:24] god it was that existence of the
[44:26] almighty
[44:27] elohim all-knowing god
[44:30] just say god see that word
[44:34] that logos but now uh
[44:37] and the same in in the beginning and the
[44:39] same was in the beginning
[44:40] with god see that same spirit banana 14
[44:44] and the word that word see
[44:48] in the beginning was the word that logos
[44:51] that part of god see now it's manifested
[44:54] and that word was made flesh
[44:58] you see now the word made flesh it
[45:01] calmed down from
[45:02] the existence of god in his
[45:05] self-existing
[45:06] uh uh condition it never began
[45:10] never end never will end self-existing
[45:13] elohim
[45:14] god never had a beginning never had an
[45:16] ending
[45:17] that that god then existence
[45:21] became flesh and when it became
[45:24] flesh it became the expression read
[45:27] colossians 1. i'm sorry i keep referring
[45:30] back to these different places where
[45:31] hardy hit this part four so i'm
[45:33] trying to bring this back together again
[45:35] and tie it see
[45:36] in colossians uh uh chapter one
[45:40] that we found out that expression came
[45:43] forth
[45:44] the word expressed god's spoken word
[45:47] created
[45:48] germ blood germ seed in the woman
[45:51] expressed
[45:51] and came forth in the flesh and dwelt
[45:54] among us
[45:56] and he is the same hebrews 13 8
[45:59] the same yesterday today and forever but
[46:02] we see the word
[46:03] coming flesh now uh
[46:06] romans 8 he come in the likeness of
[46:09] sinful flesh we'll read something in a
[46:10] minute
[46:11] that brings us to that point of that of
[46:13] that flesh that he came as a kinsmer
[46:15] redeemer
[46:17] ohio thought seriously and we'll just
[46:19] have to do it another time and did it
[46:21] the tabernacle one time but
[46:22] uh of bringing in that kinsmen redeemer
[46:25] and ruth and boaz
[46:27] and and and helping get a grips of
[46:29] understanding
[46:30] the old testament type again of that
[46:33] kinsman redeemer
[46:34] and how important it was that that that
[46:37] there was a nearer kinsman
[46:39] truth it was oh i i'm starting to get
[46:42] into it there's
[46:43] there was a near kinsman there was
[46:45] somebody that had claims over her
[46:49] amen look friend after the fall
[46:52] there was someone that had claims on you
[46:55] first of all
[46:57] that was the devil had claims on you
[47:00] that's why we're born in sin shake
[47:01] iniquity come in the world speaking lies
[47:03] that near kinsmen satan had rights to
[47:06] you
[47:07] that he had to forfeit his rights when
[47:09] jesus christ come forth
[47:11] as the kinsmen redeemer as the the
[47:14] as the one in sinful flesh the only one
[47:17] that could bring
[47:19] redemption satan could not redeem it the
[47:22] near kinsmen reduced
[47:24] could not redeem it so boaz could come
[47:26] forth and take ruth to himself
[47:29] there was a near kinsman but he couldn't
[47:31] lay his hands on it
[47:32] so he had to forfeit the one that could
[47:34] bring redemption
[47:36] jesus christ as the kinsmen redeemer the
[47:39] word
[47:40] made flesh not just the word
[47:43] theophany but the word made flesh
[47:47] that come flesh for me and you he had to
[47:50] come that way
[47:52] he could feel pain he could feel
[47:54] tiredness
[47:55] he could feel hunger he could feel
[47:57] sickness he could feel all the things
[47:59] that we feel
[48:00] he could have a headache he could have a
[48:02] back ache he could be tired he could be
[48:05] of all the things that we feel and know
[48:08] today
[48:09] amen that body was subject to
[48:12] and that body today is subject just like
[48:15] our bodies are subject to that
[48:17] he overcame it the same way we overcome
[48:20] it
[48:21] amen praise the lord we're victorious in
[48:24] jesus christ
[48:25] but it was only because of that word
[48:28] becoming flesh
[48:29] that allows us to be able to do that now
[48:31] we have to have faith in that
[48:33] that's where our faith comes from we
[48:35] have to have faith in that to believe
[48:37] that if we don't believe it if we don't
[48:39] have faith in it it's not going to work
[48:41] see but we've got to have faith believe
[48:43] in that not
[48:44] not just an intellectual faith not just
[48:47] i believe he existed or i believe he
[48:49] came
[48:49] or a an unwavering
[48:54] faith of god um that's beyond our
[48:58] comprehension and it's not something you
[49:00] work up it's not something you
[49:01] manufacture
[49:02] it's just there it's a part of who you
[49:03] are because you're a part of him
[49:05] but it's got to take that faith now
[49:07] listen this is in the hebrew teaching
[49:10] in 1957. he said here's what happened he
[49:14] said oh excuse me a minute i get
[49:16] this just gets right down where i love
[49:18] it see the logos
[49:20] and this great fountain this great
[49:22] fountain of spirit which had no
[49:24] beginning or no end
[49:26] this great spirit began to form in the
[49:29] creation
[49:30] that spirit began to form in the
[49:33] creation
[49:34] that's why paul married the two together
[49:37] jesus and melchizedek amen
[49:41] brought the two together see it was that
[49:44] spirit forming itself into creation
[49:48] again another portion of god's
[49:51] condescension
[49:53] where he could come and and and and live
[49:56] and breathe and and be with those
[50:00] that he his disciples and those around
[50:02] him
[50:03] we can read about hear about it amen
[50:06] that spirit that spirit began forming
[50:09] into that creation and the logos
[50:11] that went out from it was the son of god
[50:14] was the son of god it was the only
[50:17] visible form that
[50:19] this spirit had the only visible form
[50:22] the spirit had
[50:23] and it was a theophany which means a
[50:26] body
[50:27] and the body was like a man moses saw
[50:30] when he passed by the rock
[50:32] he said look the look like the hind part
[50:34] of a man
[50:35] same type of body to receive when we die
[50:38] here if this earthly tabernacle beat is
[50:40] off
[50:40] we have one already waiting that was it
[50:44] and that was the theophany which was the
[50:46] son of god
[50:48] the son that logos became flesh
[50:52] because we were put in flesh
[50:56] it he came in flesh
[51:00] that spirit forming into creation
[51:03] because we are flesh we
[51:06] were brought into flesh so he came
[51:10] in flesh because we were put in flesh
[51:13] again the kinsman part together
[51:16] the if theophany logos became flesh here
[51:19] among us and it was nothing else
[51:21] but the dwelling place for that entire
[51:23] fountain
[51:24] dwell in him all the fullness of the
[51:28] godhead
[51:29] bodily colossians 1 and colossians 2
[51:33] both say that he was the fullness
[51:36] jesus christ the fullness of the godhead
[51:39] bodily
[51:40] and i believe his colossians 2
[51:43] 10 says and we are complete
[51:48] in him amen if he's the fullness of the
[51:51] godhead bodily and we are complete in
[51:54] him
[51:54] where does that make us we are complete
[51:58] in him
[51:59] talk about a full preeminence we will we
[52:02] get to this next part
[52:03] that in that in uh dwelling place
[52:07] see theophy logos came flesh among us it
[52:11] was nothing but the
[52:12] it was nothing else but the dwelling
[52:14] place for that entire
[52:16] fountain dwelt in him praise the lord
[52:20] that entire fountain dwelt in him
[52:24] and we are complete in him
[52:28] praise the lord my friend if that
[52:30] doesn't help us get to the place we
[52:32] understand who we are
[52:34] i don't know what it's going to take
[52:36] amen
[52:37] let's look here now let's go to
[52:38] philippians we'll finish this up in
[52:40] philippians chapter 2
[52:42] philippians chapter 2. now we've already
[52:44] gotten here
[52:45] to to the to the body of christ the
[52:48] blood that was shed the blood of god
[52:50] blood cell that was broke release god
[52:52] upon the uh
[52:53] in spirit form upon the people and come
[52:56] back and the worshiper
[52:57] uh and not just on the worshiper but in
[53:00] the worshipper
[53:01] acts 2 the spirit of god come like a
[53:03] rushing mighty wind and lit upon them
[53:05] and its cloven tongues and set upon them
[53:07] and went in them
[53:09] the anointing and the indwelling not
[53:12] just one
[53:13] not just an anointing which anybody can
[53:16] feel
[53:17] but the indwelling you come into the
[53:19] soul of man
[53:20] not just on but in both amen
[53:24] see philippians 2
[53:27] verse 1 if there be therefore any
[53:30] consolation
[53:31] in christ if any comfort of love if any
[53:34] fellowship
[53:35] of the spirit if any bowels and mercies
[53:38] and that is the vows is the deep
[53:40] affection
[53:41] the heartfeltness is what it means by
[53:45] the bowels
[53:46] see and mercies fulfill ye my joy
[53:51] fulfill your complete my joy
[53:54] and paul talking here in the philippians
[53:57] complete
[53:58] my joy that you be like-minded
[54:02] having the same love being of one accord
[54:04] of one mind
[54:06] that was that was paul's desire see
[54:09] every true man of god every true pastor
[54:12] uh though he's an apostle uh has that
[54:15] desire
[54:15] that he that he desires to see all of us
[54:18] he desires to see his congregation his
[54:21] people those that are he's witness to
[54:24] ministry to to become one together see
[54:27] and that's what he's like that's what
[54:29] he's saying here fulfill my joy
[54:31] make me a happy man by being
[54:34] like-minded by having the same love
[54:39] being of one accordion of one mind
[54:41] together
[54:42] as a people together amen
[54:46] let nothing be done through strife or
[54:48] vain glory
[54:50] but a lowliness of mind that each esteem
[54:52] other
[54:53] better than themselves we uphold one
[54:56] another
[54:57] above ourselves esteem other better than
[54:59] themselves
[55:03] let nothing be done through strife and
[55:04] glory but low leaders might let each
[55:06] esteem other
[55:07] better than themselves look not every
[55:09] man on his own things but every man
[55:11] also that's not saying not to take care
[55:15] of your own home
[55:16] but it's saying also on the things of
[55:19] others
[55:20] to be there to help other people it's
[55:22] not busybody he's not talking about
[55:24] being a nosy busybody he's talking about
[55:26] helping people
[55:27] praying for people being there for
[55:28] people being one another together
[55:31] if we hold together like james said we
[55:33] pray one for the other that we all may
[55:35] be healed see
[55:36] that's the way it works that's the way
[55:37] the unity in the body combines together
[55:40] to work
[55:40] see and uh he's just clarifying this or
[55:44] giving more description to it uh now
[55:48] fifth verse let this mind
[55:51] be in you which was also in christ jesus
[55:55] that mind that spirit the holy spirit
[55:58] the mind of god
[55:59] let this mind be in you which was in
[56:02] christ
[56:02] jesus who being in the form of god
[56:05] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[56:08] god
[56:09] and this word and being in the form of
[56:12] god
[56:13] see he talked about being in that form
[56:15] that word form
[56:16] is morpha uh which of course we know is
[56:19] changing from one form to another that
[56:22] that god
[56:23] that almighty could do now that form we
[56:26] just talked about
[56:28] morpha really highlights
[56:32] a lot of what we talked about at the
[56:33] beginning of this message
[56:35] the the morpha changing coming from
[56:39] a word body theophany into a burning
[56:42] bush
[56:43] into a whirlwind into a wheel in the
[56:46] middle of a wheel
[56:47] into a cloud into a pillar of fire
[56:50] into all the things god manifested
[56:53] himself marking himself
[56:56] this morphe that he did becoming flesh
[57:00] god morphing himself
[57:04] jesus christ being in the form of god
[57:08] morphed in human flesh see
[57:12] took on human sinful flesh
[57:16] bought it not robbery to be equal with
[57:19] god
[57:20] amen or of the of the equal standing of
[57:23] the same mind
[57:25] the same spirit the same uh uh
[57:28] aptitude this the the basically thinking
[57:32] the same equal but made himself of no
[57:36] reputation
[57:38] and he took upon himself
[57:41] amen he took upon himself he
[57:44] voluntarily purposely voluntarily
[57:48] took this upon himself the form
[57:52] there it is again form morpha of a
[57:55] servant
[57:56] of a servant or the likeness of sinful
[57:59] flesh
[57:59] and was made in the likeness of men
[58:03] that's what uh the paul says philippians
[58:05] he told them in the in
[58:07] in to the roman church in chapter eight
[58:09] that it was a likeness of sinful flesh
[58:11] here he's saying
[58:13] uh that he made himself no reputation
[58:15] took upon himself the form
[58:17] he called it a servant being made in the
[58:19] likeness
[58:20] of men morph himself
[58:23] into our likeness he didn't
[58:27] become literally me but he came as i was
[58:32] and we sing the song he became me that i
[58:34] might become him
[58:35] that's the that's the uh the spirit
[58:41] the the changing of that spirit
[58:44] or or us from who we were
[58:48] to who he is and i'm still me
[58:52] but i took him upon myself he took me
[58:54] upon himself he took my sin
[58:57] so i could become his righteousness see
[58:59] he was righteous
[59:00] gave himself up and became in the
[59:03] likeness of sinful flesh
[59:04] in the form morphed himself
[59:08] into that form so that we
[59:11] could become righteous by taking our
[59:14] sins from us
[59:17] the only way he could do it made himself
[59:20] of no reputation
[59:21] but now look in the form of god
[59:25] he thought it not robbery to be equal
[59:28] with god
[59:30] now in the form of god he morphed
[59:32] himself see in the likeness of sinful
[59:34] flesh
[59:35] god morphing himself and becoming
[59:39] in the likeness of his servant thought
[59:41] it not robbery
[59:43] to be equal with god now i want to hit a
[59:46] point here
[59:47] as i will post here just a few minutes
[59:50] robbery is to subtract or to take away
[59:54] from
[59:54] so if you think in the in the context of
[59:57] the bible saying
[59:58] thought it not robbery he thought it's
[1:00:01] kind of odd verbiage there but what he's
[1:00:03] really saying is
[1:00:04] what he considered was it did not take
[1:00:07] anything
[1:00:08] away from god for him to consider
[1:00:11] himself
[1:00:12] equal with god you understand
[1:00:15] see even though he was morphing into the
[1:00:19] likeness of sinful flesh
[1:00:21] it was not subtracting anything from god
[1:00:25] for him to realize who he was
[1:00:28] in god oh friend if we could just
[1:00:31] understand
[1:00:33] even though we are in the form even
[1:00:36] though we are
[1:00:37] morphing in sinful flesh not the
[1:00:40] likeness of sinful flesh as he was we
[1:00:42] are actually
[1:00:43] in sinful flesh even though we are
[1:00:46] morphing in that sinful flesh
[1:00:50] we can look at this by the mind of
[1:00:52] christ
[1:00:53] and realize that it's not taking
[1:00:56] anything away from god
[1:00:58] for us to realize who we are in god
[1:01:02] that we are a part of god and that god
[1:01:05] has put in spirit in
[1:01:07] us so that it would bring us to the
[1:01:10] place that he
[1:01:11] is oh that's exactly what god's trying
[1:01:15] to get us to see
[1:01:17] that's exactly what god's trying to get
[1:01:19] us to understand and become
[1:01:21] is that we are in that form but it's not
[1:01:24] taking
[1:01:25] anything see satan's problem was
[1:01:29] satan wanted to be above god
[1:01:33] he wanted to subtract away from god
[1:01:37] by taking the worshipers fro of god
[1:01:40] away from him and exalting him above
[1:01:44] the most high see that
[1:01:47] satan's big mistake was to be as
[1:01:51] god is to be above the most high
[1:01:54] to take away from god those that worship
[1:01:57] him
[1:01:58] so that they would worship him instead
[1:02:01] and how many people oh my how many
[1:02:04] ministers how many people
[1:02:06] want to try to do that today from
[1:02:09] business to government to
[1:02:10] to churches people want to take away
[1:02:14] and rob away from god so that those
[1:02:17] people serve them instead of him
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:21] but we're not here to serve a pastor a
[1:02:23] minister a church or a government
[1:02:25] we're here to serve almighty god
[1:02:30] oh help us it's not robbery
[1:02:35] for god to put us in the position
[1:02:38] to know who we are when this bride comes
[1:02:41] to know who she is
[1:02:42] that's not taking anything away from god
[1:02:44] that's actually adding to
[1:02:46] god because if you came from god
[1:02:49] you're going back to god that's just
[1:02:52] adding to
[1:02:53] that's not subtracting away from that's
[1:02:57] not
[1:02:57] any kind of robbery and paul is helping
[1:03:00] us to see
[1:03:01] jesus in that position but look friend
[1:03:04] if you are complete in
[1:03:05] him then it's not taking away
[1:03:09] anything away from god for you to
[1:03:12] know who you are in him
[1:03:15] oh praise the lord it's not robbery
[1:03:18] it's actually adding to not taking away
[1:03:21] amen he thought it not robert to be
[1:03:24] equal
[1:03:25] with god of the same mind if you look
[1:03:27] that word equal up
[1:03:29] it just means of the same mind the same
[1:03:31] spirit
[1:03:32] well that isn't that what we're supposed
[1:03:34] to be
[1:03:36] aren't we supposed to be in that place
[1:03:38] aren't we supposed to be of equal mind
[1:03:41] of equal spirit god is bringing us to
[1:03:44] the place that
[1:03:46] that that we're in that place with him
[1:03:48] not our carnality not our human minds
[1:03:50] not our
[1:03:51] human abilities i'm talking about the
[1:03:53] spirit the soul
[1:03:55] that place that god dwells with man oh
[1:03:58] let let god help us
[1:04:00] bring us to that place it's not taking
[1:04:02] away from him
[1:04:04] it's adding to him amen
[1:04:08] praise the lord jesus being found in the
[1:04:10] fashion is a man he humbled himself
[1:04:12] became obedient unto death even the
[1:04:13] death of the cross
[1:04:15] wherefore god also hath highly exalted
[1:04:17] him and giving him the name which is
[1:04:18] above every name that
[1:04:20] the name of jesus every knee should bow
[1:04:23] the things in heaven and things in earth
[1:04:25] and things under the earth
[1:04:26] and then every tongue should confess
[1:04:28] that jesus christ is lord
[1:04:31] to the glory of god the father amen
[1:04:35] praise the lord that's exactly what he's
[1:04:37] trying to do
[1:04:38] god help us to do it god help us to
[1:04:41] fulfill that part that he give us
[1:04:44] not think it'd be robbery it's not
[1:04:46] taking away
[1:04:47] it's adding two one more quote here
[1:04:49] unveiling of god
[1:04:51] god unveiled in jesus to do the work of
[1:04:53] redemption at the cross
[1:04:54] god could not die as a spirit
[1:04:58] he's the eternal but he had to put on a
[1:05:00] mask and act the part of death
[1:05:02] he did die but he couldn't do it in his
[1:05:05] god form he had to do it in sun
[1:05:08] form morphine in the form
[1:05:12] in the image in the likeness
[1:05:15] of sinful flesh as
[1:05:18] son of man on earth he had to be
[1:05:21] a sun formed then when he returned
[1:05:24] pentecostal did
[1:05:25] uh he was son of god again amen
[1:05:28] god that great spirit
[1:05:32] that great condensation ascension of the
[1:05:34] great almighty
[1:05:36] god that great spirit that come
[1:05:40] and is doing the same today he's doing
[1:05:43] it through us
[1:05:44] he's doing it through this bride friend
[1:05:47] let's take our place in that
[1:05:50] it's not robbery it's it's adding to god
[1:05:53] it's not taking away from it's adding to
[1:05:55] god
[1:05:56] that place that god has called us that
[1:05:58] we're supposed to be
[1:06:00] that place that god desires that's our
[1:06:02] position that's our place that goes
[1:06:04] right back to that adoption we talked
[1:06:06] for
[1:06:06] a year almost on amen brings us right
[1:06:10] back into that

[1:08:03] my 32nd
[1:08:04] anniversary of the first message i ever
[1:08:07] preached
[1:08:08] and you think well how do you remember
[1:08:09] that well i wouldn't but my precious
[1:08:11] mother
[1:08:12] uh the first message i ever preached it
[1:08:14] was a wednesday night
[1:08:15] so 32 years ago it was a wednesday night
[1:08:18] not a sunday
[1:08:19] uh my precious mother taped it on the
[1:08:22] cassette tape

[1:08:37] been good to us
[1:08:39] and gone many places and many years

[1:08:44] first message that they ever be here in
[1:08:46] this
[1:08:47] today didn't think we'd still be here
[1:08:51] um or or what we're doing but we're
