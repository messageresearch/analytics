attitude oh I I got a lot of time I want to see my children grow up and I want to accomplish this and Lord and we're leaving you behind oh God we're putting you last when we should put you first then Lord I just read in your word that the the people of the flesh have always persecuted them of the spirit and Paul says it Remains the Same to this day and Lord help us to recognize the hour and the message amen and the time that we're living in for the enemy he knows his job better than we know as trying to be Christians but father we recognize that much more that it's not our fight it's yours

is to come to church we know what it is to pay our tithes we know what it is above all it's John Peter and Paul said that to love one another above all and to love you first everyone else second to put ourselves last but father there's a tendency if we're walking in the flesh we put ourselves first help us to recognize that to be right to be uh uh live a life that's worthy of the Gospel of Jesus

back home they got home yesterday so um we had Mike and Tabitha we were in the hospital a week I think and now a Tabitha she just she had her natural uh medicine no epidural nothing and everything

so and so we're very happy and thankful for that amen I wanted to announce that we'll hold off the testimonies I got something I want to do until a little bit later but I want to see one more song before we do that but I did want to I didn't want to do this kind of separately from that so for that announcement so but when I sing this song it's not in the song book it's not in either one of the song books we have it's a song a lot of you may know I'm not sure it's an old song uh but it's just really titled thank you Lord uh but if you know it say it with me it's on the screen there so as a

we've been blessed Saints amen we're a blessing amen God has been so good to us amen for what God has done for us to us there's no reason we'd ever have to complain in any way amen amen it's been so good thank you praise His name amen thank you Jesus now this morning as you all know this Thursday we have a Thanksgiving coming up and as I have done before and felt to do again this time I'd like to turn this I have a little message but I'd like to turn this into a testimony type meeting amen and uh usually a testimonies that we have on our maybe Sunday services or testimonies that you have that you want to give for something the Lord's done for you but maybe just recently or a miracle that's happened or something like that and and it can be that but if it's just a something that's just a general testimony too you know brother green many times he would get up and say does anybody have a testimony said brother Brandon be the first one to stand to his feet and say I just want to say I love the Lord Jesus amen amen how great are a testimony can you have amen but that being said you don't have to give it a testimony but I do want to take the time whatever we need this morning and I just felt led that I believe we're all thankful and we all have a lot to be thankful for amen and um the we live in a country we live in to express our love we're able to express our thankfulness to what God's giving saints that they Thanksgiving was a born of course it didn't become a national holiday until a hundred years later but it wasn't born based on the fact that they came to a place that a new land that they didn't know anything about or made new friends or that they they were thankful because they had come to a place that they felt like that they could worship God the way they wanted to worship God how and when and the way they wanted to worship god without the oppression of nicolaitan's systems lording over them they wanted to read their Bibles and freedom without being scared of a church or a government chopping their heads off or taking their children from them they were thankful because they had a freedom and liberty of God that's why they were thankful not for the Bountiful Harvest they had or all the things that may have come with it but they were thankful for one thing even unfortunately it seems to have waned a good bit that they were thankful of one thing and that was that they had come to a place that they had the freedom to worship God in the way that they wanted to amen praise the Lord but if anybody has a testimony something on your heart that you'd like to give glory and praise to the Lord this morning oh I about about three weeks ago I lost my car key and so I took this little purse thank you so much so about three weeks ago I lost my wallet that I made my tea to my car and I took this little wallet it's got four three zippers in it two on the front and one in the back and this thing and this little pouch in the front there's nothing you can't put much in it a couple cards a little bit of coin and paper and I dumped that thing out and the pockets are only like two inches deep except the back one I dumped everything out to look and um and uh and I just pleaded with the Lord I need that key I don't know where it is and I went into my wallet for something and there was my key it just appeared it just appeared amen I have another testimony but I don't want to go through these so go ahead and give it sister is that short again go ahead sure okay it's a testimony meeting so amen give glory to the Lord praise the Lord I've been um struggling with trying to um keep remembering that my spirit is in the heavens and to walk according to that listening in the spirit and listening you know for his word and listening for that unction in my heart you know I'll go this way go that way don't do this with that so I've been real um trying to be real conscious of that and I realized I had such a blessing I laid down to sleep and God would give me little kind of like kaleidoscopes I'd be so tired and and he would just give me like the horoscopes of color and everything and I and I would just I was so ecstatic I just started praising God when he does this for me and then I realized I've seen in the spirit that's so blessed me we just think these things are common and and that always just stuff in my hair it's just you know and then I realized it's not oh God is giving us these things to teach us to train to train to that he's really there all the time and he's and to press him yes he is yeah and so that's all I have amen anybody else for the dentist I really don't need a microphone can you all hear me yeah yeah okay it's more it's more for the camera I'm streaming really oh yeah that's right yeah except better when it's Amplified okay um you often hear me you pray and testify that we have to trust the Lord he's real amen and um there's been several times I've misplaced my keys and I misplaced my wedding band and I could not find it and I said Lord you know where it said and you can lead me to it and this is what the Lord has showed me not to fret not to get upset right not to get nervous and I'll just I'm trying to be led by the spirit of God and so I went in my bedroom and Leah has a hope chest in front of our bed Something Told Me To Move It I moved in there was the wedding band and another one real quick uh when we were in South Carolina Leah misplaced her visa card Chase Visa card and she told me I need to call cheers just wait the Lord will let us find it amen and she did it again a few hours later I said no the Lord not yet the Lord will leave us a short time later after I told her that the second time her aunt comes up to us and says her visa card was on top of my desk and Liv says I don't know how I put it there but we have to trust him he's real amen is that much more he's real together compared and get us uh equipped for that Rapture praise the Lord amen amen so every time uh why you're getting ready for your testimonies um and welcome by the way I'm sorry I didn't welcome it to sister Teresa you look familiar do I know you possible Joshua and you belong to who uh Grace okay all right I know I've seen you before I couldn't remember and okay well welcome it's a pleasure to have you thank you for being here um when I fly and go into Minneapolis which we've been doing since August I go in to the airport and I put all my stuff because I learned to do this years ago and flying I put everything out of my pockets even though I got pre-checked on it doesn't matter I put all my stuff in a baggie and put it in my briefcase everything except for my license because you got to give them your license at the registrate at the reservation desk you got to give your license at the TSA and uh and then I and then I have to give my life show my license when I get the rental car so I put everything in but my license so my license comes out of my wallet so I took my license and I always I'm always you know wanting to go and so I had my license I put my wallet in the little change area cup area and hand my license to the people and get the car and they lift the gate and I just take my license and set it next to my wallet and then pull off and then when I get to the hotel I take my license and put it in there but this time first time that I had somebody riding with me the other one of our guys and we had flown up there together and he was riding with me and when we got there before I had set my wallet uh we saw our boss come in with another person at the exact same time the hotel parking lot and then he thought a part of this car had the charger in it but it wasn't and I thought you know it's probably this this right right here is probably a phone charger so I took my wallet in my uh my driver's license out and you know with all the confusion everything I didn't put it in there so we got out to go get our luggage and stuff out of the back of the car to go meet with them I forgot to put my wallet and my license in my wallet and I'm sure they fell out in the parking lot but I didn't even realize it until the next day at lunch when I got my wallet out to go pay for lunch my license was going on so where are they and I went back I looked everywhere and then it snowed all sudden it snowed every day we were there it snowed every day sun came out for probably a total of two hours in the entire week uh 15 degrees Friday so it was It was kind of brutal but it snowed every day I woke up Monday morning to go to work it was snowing and there was some snow on the ground and I didn't think but I didn't think anything about it because it was until lunch that day and so I went when we got back I went and I looked around and it was nowhere to be found I looked in everything and Sony was saying look here I said oh look there six times uh look here I looked there eight times look here I looked there four times I looked everywhere and I did the same thing like Lord just put in my wallet that's or have somebody find it and so I was downstairs asked the lady no nobody's turned anything in and so some of you that thinks she led the sisters know or different ones know about it and went to prayer and so after lunch on Tuesday I told my boss I said if you don't mind I finished eating I said I'm going to go to the hotel and check around because it had gotten to it had gotten to a balmy temperature of 33 that day so uh things to melt but the scrapers had been scraping the parking lot so I went kicking around in these big huge these piles where they had plowed everything to and it was no I couldn't find it anywhere and so I looked back and I I retraced my steps six times from where I knew we parked the car and I knew it was in the parking lot I mean I knew that's where I had I dropped it it had to be there uh because I could trace it up to that point um it's like everybody says you know where'd you uh where's the last place you found it or words the last place you had it where I lost it no that's kind of a silly question but I knew so I traced myself back to there and I knew it had to be there but the scrapers would come by and people that walk through there and I looked here when I kicked snow all over the place I did I did everything I knew to do so assumed in time he said just go ask the lady of the desk one more time so when asked to lay at the desk she said what's your name and I told her and she picked it up so here it is I don't know who turned it in uh it's been it's been straight uh the scraper scraped it somehow I don't know where it was where they found it I Nast in care uh just thankful that because I spent a good 24 to 36 hours wondering how I was going to get home because you got to give you your license that's the only picture ID I had an advice like we have uh you have passport yeah home on my file cabinet didn't do me any good I tried to order a license I was going to get Sonia to go get some license for me and mail it to me next day or something anyway but uh I wasn't worried but I was trying to figure out well if how am I going to get home it's one thing to lose them and then go to the MVD and get some more it's another thing when you're out of town you're going to fly out in a few days to try to get back home so I'm thankful for rewards uh LED somebody to find them to bring them to them and so and thank you for praying as well it makes a difference anyone else okay yeah brother Pat I love the Lord amen I'm so thankful that that the Lord has chosen me and give me the chance to choose him amen we choose each other that that's how a groom picks his God Amen and choose each other yes um mostly you know the testimonies that I give are mostly about the car I don't know if anybody who knows about what happens with the car but I was driving my old Fort the other day and and uh it started shaking and I thought well I just had a flat tire fixed and that was probably out of balance so I kept going at all I go to the entire store and get them to rebalance it um in the uh luckily I'd gone down the super highway and then I and then I got on the side road I went down to the service road again when I pulled up on I-10 and I not pulling up the Ina ramp there it came loose damn it was done and and it was stuck the trans I knew because it flopped the trans the driveshaft hit the floor and I said oh I know I've broken my rear universal and I thought wow just yesterday I was thinking when I had this flat tire I took my tools out and I didn't put the tools back in the Drone and I had a spare universal joint in there as well I could have fixed it you know I didn't so I had to get a wreck or so called the police got the record the police came in the record came and called me home and we finally got it back in the garage and and I grow alone right now the yoga broke in half so I couldn't have fixed it but it's just the Lord is always with me amen amen I believe he's got hedges around all of us yes amen and anything could have been worse it could have been doing 75 when it absolutely yeah it just when I pulled up and stopped and yeah so it's so lucky amen it's pieces that I have and I can fix it yes it just takes time but it's the same way I just continue my testimonies it happens every day yeah amen the sink see it wouldn't work anymore so I pulled the sink all apart and I tried two or three different drains and that oh it just wasn't working and so I had already bought some drains and I went back and uh they gave me so much money back for this simple little drain it gave me a relics uh intricate one which seems like it would have cost more for less and gave me money back and I said wow that was great and we don't put it on and it's leaking and I said Lord you know I guess it keeps leaking keeps like well I keep tightening it I I just could hear him you just keep dieting and I tied it and tighten it and then the next day it'll be leaking and I tighten it I mean it goes on for a week you know and then and uh this is just supposed to be a simple repair you know and I just unplug the drain would have been good enough but so in the middle of the night I checked it because I didn't want it to be dripping all night long you know it was a thing and I'd tighten it again with that pair of pliers and crack another oh no I broke a plastic piece in there now I gotta start all over again Lord why do you do this to me and the next morning it was healed it's there's no leak wow it was asleep I don't know what happened maybe it popped into place or what if the Lord praise the lord it's it's happened to me over and over all my life that when I go to fix things the Lord helps me yeah sometimes he fixes things when you just don't know the answer yeah it doesn't matter he got things yeah praise the Lord amen I'm so thankful that the Lord is in my life and that he chooses to uh well what Southerners say yes with me the Lord keeps messing with me and I'm glad he does he's crazy we're not thankful amen very true and we're thankful for all though many blessings that he's given us up with every be thankful for even like the song said I even have clothes they may not be new I went to my closet this morning and I thought well I'll just get out the best clothes I got and see how I can go be thankful to God and I looked

gonna kill himself well as you all know Kevin expensive and I didn't have the money form but for some reason I just I had this faith that it almost scared me and um I just knew that I could always speaking into existence but I thought if I do that people are gonna think I'm crazy I'm not gonna explain this to to everybody so I held on and that week for a week and a half I received 10 checks from people in places where I didn't know maybe money I've had so many miracles happen that my husband used to see you need to write to write and I never amen but we said that yeah all these miracles to my family yes because I have so many others I hope you sit here and talk all day about it yeah amen yeah how many times me and my wife have said that me and my family have said how many miracles that we that's happened uh we we could literally write a book anyone else praise the Lord I want to start off I am grateful for this church this church as really helped me and just stay strong amen praise God I want to first start off I have an unruly neighbor upstairs keeps me up a lot the night before my surgery um he did that and he did that last time he does it quite a bit well anyways when you go to have surgery for your eyes they um blood pressure cuff and electrodes like for EKG I said my blood pressure is going to be high because you know I was tired a little upset but through the search and my blood pressure was perfect amen 124 over 75. praise the Lord and uh I said I'd have to be God yes and then last Thursday I went to have my checkup for my eye because I had a little bit of problems and he's supposed to give me a great confidence prescription for my left lens so I can that's why I have my third class for school and you go oh well I have to send you to an office in Oro Valley so you can go and I have to go Wednesday and it's way out there at 10 425. wow North Oracle yeah so that's way out I was little but then I I prayed on it I said maybe that's a reason for it you know and I just got to be grateful amen everything's working out yes and so I'll just have to go through here yes praise the Lord amen you know the other day we had better than Old Johnson and the Lord put on a hard amount of money to give to him and I got almost the exact same amount of money in the mail by check about two weeks later from some some Arbiter I wasn't even expecting anything almost the exact same it was a decent amount of money too almost to the dollar the exact same room I gave him it knows amen praise the Lord you want to you go ahead you got the money so I have a wallet that my dad dad bought me uh I lost it at a Ross store uh I felt it fell out of my pocket in the like you know the driveway to get a seat there's a parking I felt drop out I went back there to look it was gone I came back home my like a couple days later my mom was doing laundry she was looking in my pockets and she said Joel you need to get take care of your wallet it was in the pocket oh it fell out in the parking I fell off all the time amen very good praise the Lord amen good testimony anybody else well God is so good to us too and you know I'll probably just increase fight one little baby so I'm thankful for that amen I gotta won't talk because God is so good it's just so good so it's our community talk but I just sometimes just tell things because people wonderful well what happens with minister's wife well I'm going to tell you something that happened with the little car incident I was going to meet one of the sisters for lunch and so you know you just going back today oh this is just great this is fun well I went to park Mexico car and I noticed it was sticking out just a little bit but I can make it I pulled in I was like I heard a noise I was like oh right really you know this is how pastors like things I'm human too I was like oh really really you know I was just sitting there okay I'm gonna get out and see if I did anything so I got out and sure enough I scraped the car and of course I have a white car and I have a black car it doesn't have to be magic it sounds like oh great so like for a split second you know the devil wants to say hey you can just walk away you can just go pack somewhere else you won't they don't know but then but God says really you know better than that okay so of course I backed out pulled back in like I should so I had to go find this person in a restaurant you know what crazy person walks around do you have a car give him a card you know it's not like a guide you're just gonna help me find a person so I just walked in and I said okay that looks like the people something to something so I walked up to him and I said Do you happen to have a black car and they're like yeah we do how'd you know no I don't know and I said I think I hit your car and you know you don't know how a person's gonna react I'm like oh this is okay let's go look at it you know for a second like okay everything's a meeting so like we go out there and they looked it over and she had two other people with her and you know people can change stories and whatever but she was all oh it's gonna be okay I think I know someone who can fix it the other people are like you should be saying that no and so I was like oh right my insurance is going to go up I don't know what I'm gonna do I have to tell my husband I just wrecked my car you know all this goes through your head right let me talk about God you're gonna have to help me I'm gonna have to help me with this situation I gotta have the right Spirit I'm a person that have the right attitude so you know I asked the lady I said well you want to change insurance no we'll be fine everything will be fine well God said just take all the pictures stay honest do everything you're supposed to do and so I did that I took all the pictures I took her license plate and he said just always stay honest so right I wrote down every detail I knew and everything that they said and that lady tried to contact me three times and just ignored her because you know you don't know what they're doing you don't know that person they don't know me so the insurance company kept calling me but the insurance name wasn't putting them on the phone and with all the scamming and stuff I was like I'm playing this room that they knew my name and they knew there was an incident but they didn't see when it happened so I was like okay I'm not answering that well a month later I got a letter in the mail that had the same number I said oh this is legit and so the next time they called I talk to him and he said well just tell me everything that happened and how it happened and so I didn't and the whole thing cleared up again to pay for anything I didn't have to my interest didn't go up they falsified the date that happened so just one little detail changed the whole situation for me but you know God likes to just see what are you gonna do in the situation how are you going to handle that situation even the Master's wife you've gotten to go oh no but something says don't do that stay honest stay true and so I'm just thankful that we have that voice that says do the right thing and when you do it you sound okay you kind of go oh my gosh everything's gonna go you know my insurance is going to go up everything I said be crazy but it didn't so then the other thing that happens to me I think I've told you all anybody who doesn't know I drive senior citizens around for appointments and doctors appointments and errands I have one lady that she's so good to me I've had her for two years and when we talk we talk a lot about faith she goes to a Methodist Church I'd come here and she's constantly saying well what do you believe what do you do and so we just talked and I told her one time this was like four months ago I said okay we got she has a wheelchair I'll walk her and I said every time we go we can't find a parking spot you know the parking part is full of people who can park handicap has three or four they always get full when I have appointments with her we're like okay let's drive around it comes open because she had a hard time walking so a lot of times I have to stop behind cars let her out and keep the blinkers going and people are kind of going what are you doing I'm trying to get this lady in the store no so we do that and one day she's like you know I'm tired of this I said you know I am too we're just going to pray from now on anytime we have an appointment no matter where it is we're gonna find a spot yeah sure she's coconut milk I said Kenny it's really gonna happen I believe it so the first couple appointments will get there right perfect you know and there's van parking that there if anybody knows there's band parking in this regular parking we always see the vampire because there's extra space so I said okay we're gonna need to be specific we need a van parking and she said okay she still had that question well now for myself she's like are you ready to go I know we're gonna need a spot so you never know and we have been for the last four months anytime we go to an appointment that's about a board scheduled or what we're doing we're just pull in and we're good to go and sometimes it's just mindful of every little thing we do amen praise the Lord amen amen yes anybody else yeah I will he doesn't mind um I just like to give everyone else a chance most of the time anyway but just thank the Lord for all those blessings and everything he does and providing and as you all know the job that he gave me and the circumstances surrounding finding the job he had to basically make me poor so I can move in with my parents so I can be on the side of town to leave the correct safe way to see the sign of the insurance company that I would call to then be hired and become a part of just all these little things that he had to do perfectly for it all to work amen and for the gifts he's given me the abilities he's given me the understanding the knowledge of wisdom sometimes people will ask me to do things or ask me questions that I've never occurred before and I just know the answer whatever that channel he's given me that he allows me to operate in sometimes then to further the insurance story that Mom was telling because I'm their insurance agent now I can see the back side of the insurance thing and the lady that she was talking about opened a claim um with her insurance company to contact Mom's insurance company so there was an open claim that they were trying to get money but the date was incorrect and some of the details about the incident were Incorrect and ultimately at the end of it the claim was officially closed without payment so it didn't affect the so there's a little bit more interesting on the back end that happened that she didn't mention but just overall keeping this healthy it's been pandemic has been going on for 2 . none of us have covered who've been in the positive I've been in groups of people that later have tested positive I went to Las Vegas I've been in groups of people I went to a reptile show yesterday where people were cramping and I just thank the lord for keeping us all safe amen praise the Lord yeah I want crowded airplanes every other week and they're all full every flight is almost completely full of airports airplanes full full the God God keeps us and videos I'm sorry that's a hedge yes yes exactly amen praise the Lord and I prayed I thought I've told y'all before I prayed that over every one of you too emails amen it's a good thing Sonya took pictures too she took pictures and sent the pictures because I believe if I remember they were claiming damage that didn't happen correct and since she had taken pictures uh it just showed that everything that these people were trying to just get money was wrong and don't the pictures have a date yeah yeah so that they are date encrypted yeah I don't if you send it to somebody I don't know if the date goes through to the person you send it to but you haven't proved that that's the date and time that it was taken correct so amen just listen to that still a small voice you never know we oftentimes gets in places and we just don't understand Lord mama here wise it's going on why is this happening to me Lord why is this happening to me God just listen I'm just trying to get you in the position to bless you if you just let me move you and let me get you in that place I just want to get you to work to this place where I could bless you and it and he does amen he does we just trust him praise the Lord amen we'll stand to our feet now I want to read a couple of scriptures amend no service that's complete without the reading of scripture thank you Lord and I do appreciate your continued prayers of to my knowledge we're supposed to go back to Minnesota the next two jobs uh some next and in the middle of December so and it's not getting warmer in Minneapolis in the Minnesota it's not getting any warmer there so although this last week was pretty extreme with a lot of the cold the way it was in the snow so and it did again it did literally snow at some point every single day Monday Tuesday Wednesday I don't think it stopped now some of it was very light it didn't accumulate very much but it stowed every day if uh if you don't like snow but the good part about this this job though the way the Lord worked it out we ended up with three extra guys on our team from another team because they wanted to take this Thanksgiving week off they were supposed to work this week so they want to take this week off so they worked this past week with us so they could take this week off and those guys were available but 95 percent of what we had to do on this job was all inside it was all inside the tunnel or inside the back room in fact Monday I had to pull cable on a man lift in the back room I had to pull cable it's like one of the first things we did Monday and the sweat was pouring off of me because I was up on this man lift and the heater was blowing right on me so it actually sometimes was the opposite extreme but I again my job because there's a lot of outsides and inside and outside of stuff to do so but um uh the Lord has just been good to take care of us so I'm thankful for that yeah amen amen second Corinthians will turn down chapter four second Corinthians chapter four verse eight I won't be very long like I said I like I like kind of making this and it's really encouraging to hear all the testimonies and miracles and things that the Lord does for us and um a lot of times some things that we don't probably even would say some of the testimonies I heard here today you probably wouldn't have give that testimony in church uh but now you give it for all of us to hear and what a blessing it's been and I see the acclimation in everybody's faces involvements being encouragement and uh I I think it just really helps us I really do I know it helps me so uh but I believe it does help all of us to to uh and honestly just in the few years this Church's existence we could probably write a book for things I even I said the other day uh if the Lord had not miraculously healed Tabitha there's no way for me to add another baby yes with the autoimmune lupus whatever the Dev the devil did the doctor for saying if the Lord hadn't completely healed her of that there's no way Ruth could be here yeah no but praise the Lord amen God is a miracle working God she is amen thank you Lord for this church amen amen I am thankful for that I'm very thankful God's good a lot could go with that but the best thing is God is good let's bow our heads for a word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus it has certainly been a wonderful time father hearing about all the acclimations and the praise and think I trust it's been a sweet smelling savior to you Lord you've received it to yourself Lord from our hearts because it wasn't that how the world would say uh coincidence or luck uh if these are coincidences then then it these coincidences transcend the coincidence and it only gets to the place that it's you it could only be you Lord and we're thankful to you for it and when you want to give our lips and voice to the Miracles and to the things that you do for us and done for us and God we just want to thank you for it I want to give you praise and honor glory and then this season of Thanksgiving which probably I guess if there's a holiday I enjoy the most and Lord because it helps me get to the place that we want to reminisce and and go back to those things that we voice of how thankful we are to you yes yes just like they were at the time they came and Lord gave thanks to you for coming into this country into this land and being thankful for it a place that they could call home that they could call a place to worship you in the freedom and liberty that that you give Lord to be able to do it without the thought or fear of Oppression or uh of dominating over lord and we had that freedom yet today although a mark of the beast is is moved forward even into this country father you've given us your bride the ability to to still do that and to give you thanks and praise and we're thankful for that we're thankful for all that you've done for us Lord uh like sister Teresa said would probably be the same for all of us we could stand here all day probably and think of the things and when we finish that testimony another one comes in our heart and they finished out and another one comes in our heart and Lord it could just be that way on and on for what you've done for all of us today and but God we just want to let you know how much we love you how much we thank you and praise you you've been so good to us Lord and we just uh invite your presence once again to continue to be with us root over us and speak to us and through us through this word Lord that it would manifest itself to us once again this lesson you give Lord that we come to you Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord have the remaining part of this service Lord under your full control as we commit it to you now the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen second Corinthians 4 8 um I'll read one verse of scription then I'll let you be seated I just want to go to verse 15. uh I want to read beginning at eight but I will just read 15 I'll let you be seated second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 15. for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of uh the Thanksgiving of many redowned to the glory of God so you can be seated if you like I didn't I did not read that verse that has Grace in it at the same time the grace came through the door praise the Lord but look this verse actually had Grace I I almost felt like I was summonsing you when I said Grace and you came through the door well braceable there's a reason for it amen but let's go back to verse eight uh again just for a few minutes I want to read beginning at verse 8. I want to read through the rest of this uh the focus of course is on that 15th verse that I just read there we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which are uh we live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our mortal flesh that's the third time it said that now in our bodies our bodies mortal flesh it's a third time so far in our mortal flesh 12th verse now so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same Spirit of Faith according to as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of men you were down to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but through our uh through our own though our outward man perish yet the inward managed renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh up work it for us a far more exceeding and eternal way of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But to the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen now again for a few minutes I want to put focus on that 15th first so let's let's go back and revisit that for a moment because that's what the subject is that I want to speak of and the subject of what we in our testimonies were today and that is for for all things or for our sakes that listen now that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many we've heard the Thanksgiving of many of us here this morning redound or that is to multiply or or abundantly be to the glory of God so our Thanksgiving and what our Thanksgiving is and the Thanksgiving of our lips to the Lord is to magnify and to re and to uh uh redound as the scripture says to the glory of God the whole thing about this was to give glory to God it wasn't to give glory to any man it wasn't give glory to a pastor or anybody is to get all of it is to give glory to God so the grace of God through our Thanksgiving multiplies and re and and redowns to the glory of God God gives the grace God gives us the blessings God shines his light God's with us all the way God never leaves or forsakes us God always gives these things but it's always given by our Thanksgiving to the glory of God Amen so when we give thanks to him it is to glorify the Lord Jesus it's not to put a spotlight on us and I hate to say this but I have heard people from time to time uh different ones you give a testimony and you would think that they were the ones that did it uh they does this on the eyes of God we're special but we're not special in the eyes of understanding of who we are as individuals God is no respecter person but we're not any more special we're not any more better we're not any greater we're just the children of God and we love God and that Glory of God that we shed that through our Thanksgiving then abounds to the Lord to his glory to his glory and honor that's what our that's what our testimonies are supposed to be that's what our uh giving thanks to God is supposed to be it's supposed to be to his glory not mine to his glory uh I'm nothing special God knows that but all that we do gives to his glory so if if what we do abounds to the glory of God then that is uh that is praise to him and that's what we should give is always praise to him not something to draw attention to ourselves oh look what God done for me uh look how God's uh done this for me and it's all about me me me and it's nothing about me it's not about you your testimonies were beautiful but it's not about you it's about him because that's where the glory goes no glory on any of us we're just thankful and humbled to God that he does it to us for us amen and he gives us the very desires of our heart yeah amen believing in faith doesn't always happen the way we wanted to it doesn't always happen the way we think it's going to doesn't always happen the way we wanted to but God will do it according to his word according to get his will and purpose that is better for each of us you know a lot of times we ask God to do things for us and if he were to do it exactly the way we wanted it and exactly when we wanted it and it would probably be to our detriment but he does it the way he knows it should be done he did notice it when it's supposed to be done so it doesn't work it works to his glory but to our betterment because all in all things are as the scripture said there for our sakes amen God does it because he loves us yes we return our Thanksgiving to him not to brag but because we love him if God didn't do another thing ever if not one more thing that God would do in our lives we'd still love him yeah amen because our love is not based to him on what he's done for us it's based on the fact that we love him because he exists because of who he is I love my wife and I don't love her because of what she can do for me or what she can give to me or or be to me I love her because she is I mean when when you've reached a place in life where you understand that that true unconditional love and you recognize well why do I love him why do I love her why do I love the Lord because I would be asking a lot of people why do I love them I don't know I just do why do you love God because he's done this or he's done this or because all the testimony is that why you really love God no you don't love him because of those things amen you love him because he is yeah that's unconditional love if there's a reason for your love then your love is conditional it's based on this thing but if your love is not loved because of something they did or said or what it's just based on the fact that they are that they exist then that's unconditional love which means regardless of what conditions change your love doesn't change God's love doesn't change for us no matter what we do now that doesn't give us license to just go openly live in a sinful life but no matter what we do God still loves us that's unconditional love he sent his son Jesus his shed his blood that was unconditional love he shed it for those who trample all over it he said it for those who despise it and will reject it he shed it for those who wanted nothing to do with it but he shed it for them anyway amen he did they don't want it they're not going to get it they don't they don't have anything to do with it now I know brother Randolph said God came to redeem those that were redeemable but and that is true that was the ultimate purpose but John 3 16 tells us that God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believed so it's for anybody brother Adam said if the devil were to walk through that blood he'd be your brother right well that's not the grace of God I don't know what it is if that's not unconditional love I don't know what is amen amen but if your love is based on a condition oh it's my daughter because I gotta love her it's my wife so I gotta love her it's so-and-so then that's conditioned you've based it on that condition see but if there's not a condition that's unconditional I just love you because of just because I remember what what do you explain how do you explain that well how do you how do you explain love if you're I don't remember if our kids ever come and asked us but what would you do if your child came and said uh mommy what is love Daddy what is love what do you tell them I mean I guess you try to give them some kind of an explanation but can you really explain what it how can you explain faith he said well I could give a little explanation but could you really break down what faith really is how do you know God exists how do you know God exists how do you explain that you give a little explanation of what you think yourself about how do you really explain how God that God exists amen you can't go down to Walmart and buy it you can't go inherited anywhere you just you just believe you just have faith you just have love just because he exists and he exists in you and if he exists he exists through me then the love of God exists through me then the faith of God exists through me and I believe it because of the faith that exists exists amen and it rebounds it magnifies it multiplies to the glory of God that's why God wants to live his life through you God wants to continue to ultimately uh take control so that our lives are a reflection of him to his glory to his grace not my accomplishments nothing I've done Amen brother Pat said I'm thankful that this church well friend I know I'm the pastor and I guess I'm the founder but it doesn't have anything to do with me right right it's God I if I would have refused to done what God Said do he'd have brought somebody else right right somebody was going to do it somebody who's willing and that's no glory to any one person that's nothing to me that's it's God God does it all and all the glory and praise goes to him amen Psalms 95 a man who knew a whole lot about giving praise to God right a man who had a lot to be thankful for even though he went through the things he did even though he hit that low point with Bathsheba and and Uriah and baby dying and all those things and God not allowing him uh to sit on that Throne of like uh uh that that he said he would sit on the throne of David with his son Solomon wood uh God promised David that that Solomon would be that one to continue to carry that into prosperity and as we saw the other day brother Graham said that was the greatest time that they ever knew no Wars and uh the the King was uh a man that had a heart for the people and uh he wanted to be there to help them because remember what was his prayer to the Lord he said God I don't want riches I don't want wealth I don't want all these things I just want to be able to judge your people I just want to have the wisdom to be able to do that and said and God said because you've asked for that and not wealth is riches I'm giving you both amen amen and that was the greatest prosperity of time but all that David went through he still was a man that could be thankful for the for the goodness of God in his life amen Psalms 95 let's look at this we'll start we'll just read a few verses of it call oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our salvation and I've heard people say that certain people shouldn't sing I've heard people say certain people shouldn't play an instrument or something like that uh they say well the the Bible says to make a Joyful Noise well yeah it says a Joyful Noise and not just a noise a Joyful Noise well the joyfulness which ironically people kind of chuckle at it doesn't say just make a noise it says Make a Joyful Noise so so-and-so shouldn't sing because that's just noise but it's not for your enjoyment although we do enjoy the worship of the Lord the Joyful Noise is when it's to him right I don't care what it sounds like amen and don't get me wrong I love them with all my heart but brother Graham couldn't carry two in the Tim bucket amen amen you listen to it song he is off key pretty much every time I've ever heard him saying forget some of the words throws them off into timing I don't know how musicians kept up with him because he was starting the wrong place at the end of the wrong place and be off key and but but it was to the glory of the Lord amen amen it was to the glory of the Lord and that and that's the point that that David is making it was a Joyful Noise because it was to the rock of our salvation amen wasn't it wasn't to us it wasn't to those standing there it was nice to hear but it's to the Lord Jesus Amen Let Us come before his presence with Thanksgiving Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land hi oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker that's giving the glory to him and that's the whole point that we have here let's go to another one here so we enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and uh and with praise I got it on the same page here's Psalms 100 Make a Joyful Noise we all know it very well make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing amen amen with singing I like to encourage if we have even more specials I've had certain people have had a special room oh I can't sing you can't I I think everybody that's got a voice can sing yeah well I I don't sound good doesn't matter are you praising the Lord with it that's all that matters yeah amen stand up here and sing Worship the Lord come before his presence with singing amen know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves it's not us has nothing to do with us it's all the praise to him amen Thanksgiving to God the title of our message today Thanksgiving to God it's all about him not not me not us we are we are his people and the sheep of the of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations yes amen and you know what his truth is his truth is love as well his truth is good his truth is worship His truth is Faith his word gives us Faith amen and helps us that we are thankful for the grace of God that abounds in us to his glory amen First Chronicles let's go to First Chronicles chapter 16. amen First Chronicles chapter 16 verse 33. Chronicles is after Kings First Chronicles chapter 16 verse 33. then shall the Trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord amen trees of course David also God through David also Compares us to trees amen he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen then shall the Trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord also a tree in the forest the same thing because he cometh to judge the earth now remember you go over to Romans 8 you see that all creation has been groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because knowing that God's creation knowing that that that would bring about what they lost from the Garden of Eden Garden of Eden was perfect body life animal life human life every aspect of God's creation was absolutely perfect there was no sin there was no lies there was no death it was absolutely perfect and creation itself including ourselves who know and part of God's creation but creation itself even body life and animal life longing and waiting for that time to come because they know when it does that it brings this uh this creation back into its perfect place again back into its perfect status that it was at the beginning of the Garden of Eden when Perfection reigned the animal the the the lion could lay down with the lamb didn't have to be worried about eating them you didn't have to worry about going in uh uh uh getting a rose off a rose bush to be stickered by it or the desert or something like that didn't exist was perfect amen perfect that's why the presence of the Lord is the the Trees of the woods sing out the presence of the Lord because he cometh with judgment to the Earth oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever David said that many times over and over in the in the Psalms and say ye save us o God of our salvation and gather us together and Deliver Us from the Heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise blessed be the Lord God of Israel forever and ever and all the people said amen and praised the Lord amen and praised the Lord that's one reason I'll enjoy coming together so much Saints we come together in this place that's Sanctified and set aside for the service of the Lord to come in and out of the world and to set with those of like Precious Faith sister Lydia said of like Precious Faith to be together amen and Worship the Lord I I it would be uh it would be outstanding if every one of you could stand up sometime it probably wouldn't work that way but and see sometimes what I see from this perspective and and on your faces and in the atmosphere of this church and of course Mike is not in his head because he sets up here and sees the same thing yeah and the worship and not just the worship from your mouths but the worship from your heart that you can feel is just it's tremendous because that's the worship of the Lord that's and he receives that amen the Lord perceives that it's Thanksgiving that we give being thankful everything that we did this afternoon or this morning every of the test it was with Thanksgiving we give it to the Lord because it's in our heart and how thankful we are to God it shouldn't take because we should come every day should be a Thanksgiving amen uh but at least every Sunday when we come in together from out of the world together together like this is a Thanksgiving of course but when it comes to that place of a national holiday and we have a remembrance as long as this nation Stills observes it uh because there's there's people that are coming against it now but as long as it's there doesn't matter because in us it's always going to be there the Thanksgiving but it's a reminder to us it's a reminder to us that of how thankful that we really are to God and it's a reminder like sister Teresa said you'll probably all write a book about the things we could go on and on about what the Lord has done for us and probably go from one Miracle to another of how God has been with us and done with us and and friend people of the world would say well that's just a coincidence well you know I'd like to come have some scoffer come up here and hear all the Miracles and all the testimonies for our own end and say that's a coincidence that's coincidence coincidence it's coincidence it gets to the place friend that it's it cannot be coincidence anymore The Coincidence would transcend the coincidence it's just not possible it's not feasibly humanly possible to believe that all these coincidences that just could continue to unfold and keep happening there's a God behind it there's a God somewhere that controls it all and it brings it to pass amen and lets it happen and and blesses us with it praise the Lord because it's him that controls it one more scripture Psalms 116 verse 12. we'll start with verse 12. psalm 16 12 what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me what shall we in other words what shall I give back what shall I give in return for what God has done for me Fred how could we ever give enough back to him for what he's done for us if I lived a million lifetimes I couldn't give back to him what he's done for me in one instance it's just not possible and that's what David I believe that's how the scripture reads and he's saying what shall I Render unto the Lord what can I give to him amen of all the benefits he's given me I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints oh Lord truly I am thy servant I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid thou has loosed my bonds I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving give me nice kids I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people in the course of the Lord's House in the midst of the old Jerusalem praise ye the Lord amen what can we do what can we give what can we say what could we ever accomplish sister Teresa did a lot of good things but you can't work your way to heaven right and there's no way to ever get enough for what God has done for us yes and all the good deeds people spend their lives with good deeds we do good deeds and we do as the Lord gives us to do as the Lord provides for us to do as the Lord leads us to do we do as we do on as unto him but whatever it is is unto him we do it as we do it unto him so what can we give there's nothing we have to give there's absolutely nothing so what do we do Lord I I pray that you accept my feeble prayer my my praise to you my Thanksgiving to you because I am truly thankful Lord and when you express that in a group of people like this and let it ring of course to us but to the Lord God looks at it and he says now that's my son that's my daughter amen it's not something that you have to do something that you have to give it's like having regular children even amen we weren't looking for anything to give be given in return amen but when the when your baby comes up and hugs and says I love you Daddy that that's what else do you need right amen it's nothing we can give him but we do can give him our we can't give him our thanks amen we can continue to offer him Thanksgiving with our actions with our lives with the things we do with our worship when we come into His presence in this place and we come into here worshiping him and singing songs of worship and Thanksgiving to God Amen when you're sitting there and gorging ourselves over the wonderful food that we're probably gonna have Thursday just continue to remember and be thankful for what God has done for you amen not necessarily the food and the family and the atmosphere and all those things but the fact that God has chosen you that God has amen put something in our hearts God has given something in our lives to want to worship him with Amen to praise him with you praise the lord it's all the things like brother Dennis is talking about and coming to church and and tithing and offering and giving and what we give of ourselves and what we give of our time and what we give of our intelligence and all the things that we do like those those are all gifts from God that God's gift to us that we just return back to him and it just boils down to the fact that friend you just you can't out give God I mean I don't I don't mean to say that what the Lord wanted me to give to brother Noel was like I regretted uh but you know it was something unusual having no idea when I sat there and I'm opening these letters for my trip and I opened this I said what is this who is this even from it was almost the exact same amount that you give what you give to the Lord it returns back to you yes Saints 104 and it doesn't have to be monetary but just the blessings of God that he gives and a sound mind and body and blessings and the strength that God gives us it's just it's beyond measure but my dad taught me years ago years and years ago he said God shovels bigger than yours amen you can't out give God because his shovel's bigger than yours amen praise the Lord so all that we give to him amen it's just it just giving right back but we thank him for it don't we it's the grace of God Amen through the Thanksgiving of many that abounds to the glory of God amen so we took the grace of God this morning amen we we we multiplied added the Thanksgiving to him for it and we gave him praise amen glorified him with it praise the Lord let's stand if we could everything so with that Happy Thanksgiving to everybody I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving together amen it's uh it's a time of celebration of Thanksgiving that God has blessed us with amen I'm thankful for so many things I'm I'm thankful to live in this country where we still at least as of right now we still have the freedoms to worship them and to meet like this and to have our Bibles and to read them and to live according to the dictates in our hearts of the Lord so amen I'm thankful for that amen thankful for all of you I'm thankful for the blessings of your lives in my life amen your your life enhances my life and I appreciate that and I thank God for that amen never would imagine in a million years but God knows how to orchestrate and bring it all together so praise the Lord thankful to God for that amen let's sing this course we probably all know what I think we have 3 16 in the book if you want to see let's just sing this a little bit before we go [Music] Lord [Music] Mary pure animal [Music] s sanctuary [Music] for you yes Lord remember me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with Thanksgiving [Music] sanctuary amen amen praise the lord well speaking of uh giving praise to the Lord with the fruit of our lips and making a Joyful Noise let's continue to pray for a song leader amen if you would sometimes I I forget about it and just kind of get into the mode of doing it but it would sure be a blessing if we had a good song leader and someone that could carry a tune would be really nice I'd appreciate the Lord and then and it would help me too but good there's nothing like a good anointed god-called song leader amen so please I'd continue that we would just continue remembering praying for that too amen I haven't heard sorry we'll give thanks for the one we have too well thank you brother I appreciate that I'll keep torturing you if you keep coming but no I haven't heard from anybody about Christmas so unless somebody says something or something changes we'll have service on Christmas Day Christmas day is Sunday so sure a Believer like us and it's going to be family and there's going to be commitments and I'm just being honest I just and that's what I want you know and um right but I also have a wife yeah please so if it's going to be something that you're going to be spending with your family and going to not be able to be here that's okay we cancel that's fine I just want to make sure that um you know we we have service we're going to have service and I get 15 picks on Christmas morning we're not coming well let me know now you know if you're going to plan something you're going to have something or you're we'll cancel okay and so okay then that that sounds fine I knew it would be a difficult thing and Sunday uh Christmas mornings are and I mean it always has been in my home in my family and Chris Christmas mornings are just kind of a thing where you come together in your family and you I I truly understand that so then we'll just cancel that Sunday morning Christmas day then we'll be canceled the other thing I haven't heard anything out about uh and I will put that notice out so everybody knows you aren't here in the text so that everybody remembers that remembers that but I haven't heard anything else about a dinner either anybody has any opinions or thoughts or anything about that uh if not it's okay I think uh what Tina done um last time and not you paying the bill I'm not saying that we can pay it was good fellowship with such a variety of food yes and uh amen it was easy to please everybody it should go back to the you know go guard around yeah that's my you know and we like you said we don't really have the place you know to have yeah so I might ask Craig just to see but if nothing comes up like that then it used to be in North Carolina there's like a clubhouse in every little neighborhood so there's these clubhouses all over the place so you can rent them you don't have anything like that here that I know of uh these little town club houses they had this we call them and all these little towns apartment was well they even have them but they're just there and people rent them out or whatever but they won't have anything kind of like that I'll ask them and see if there's a place here that we could it have to be convenient though we couldn't go like on the second floor at the building next behind us uh and if not then maybe we'll do something like that uh what were the dates again if it is safe 30 people coming to your house 30. when you offer free food people come out there well I'm not making them all that food we had we had the church when we had the church school a TLC uh the only way you could get teachers parents to come to parent-teacher conferences all for free pizza yeah if you had no free food three parents showed up you had free food a hundred of them showed up for fourth or 11th uh well wait a minute no it had to be the fourth or fourth or the 18th I can't do the 11. there had to be the fourth of the 18th how would the fourth work how about I put a text and you can just text me back what works for you best instead of trying to have you stand and discuss it here but the fourth will probably be better because it's not that close to Christmas it's not so close to Christmas that it s uh conflicts and it's still a couple of weeks away and if we just do like the Golden Corral and yes I will be paying for it so that's not up for negotiation um then it would be the four okay so okay so mark that mentally and check your calendars or whatever you do and see if something if that would work um if it's not let me know if that works then we'll attend Sunday after church yeah Sunday after church all right sounds good okay Lord bless you appreciate you all thank you very much we're gonna go probably have a bite to eat and go visit Baby Ruth praise the Lord so thankful God's been so good amen Lord graciously bless you I enjoyed the testimonies thank you for testifying and give us your testimonies and the things the Lord has done for you and miracles and it's just outstanding so I appreciate it so much and God's word is uh beautiful so Lord reach the bless you Lord willing we'll be back next Sunday amen see where the Lord takes us from there so I have a Happy Thanksgiving if you need anything let us know but Lord richly bless you amen we come to you once again at the close of the service thank you for your many blessings Lord taking this particular Sunday
