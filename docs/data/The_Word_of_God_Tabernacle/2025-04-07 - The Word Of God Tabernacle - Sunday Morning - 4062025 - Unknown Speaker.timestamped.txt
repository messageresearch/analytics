[7:03] Wow.
[7:06] [Music]
[7:23] Lost.
[7:24] [Music]
[7:58] Lord, you
[8:00] are more
[8:03] precious than
[8:06] silver.
[8:08] Lord, you
[8:11] are more
[8:13] costly than gold.
[8:18] Lord, you
[8:21] are more
[8:24] beautiful than
[8:26] diamonds. And nothing I desire compares
[8:32] with
[8:34] you. Oh yes, that's the truth. Amen. And
[8:39] Lord, you
[8:41] are more
[8:44] precious than silver.
[8:48] And
[8:49] Lord, you
[8:51] are more
[8:54] costly than
[8:57] gold. And
[8:59] Lord, you
[9:01] are more
[9:04] beautiful than
[9:07] diamonds. And nothing I desire compares
[9:13] with you. Oh, can we stand and sing it
[9:17] again? Yes,
[9:19] Lord, you
[9:22] are more
[9:24] precious than
[9:27] silver. And
[9:29] Lord, you
[9:32] are more
[9:35] costly than gold.
[9:39] And
[9:40] Lord, you
[9:43] are more
[9:45] beautiful than
[9:48] diamonds. And nothing I desire compares
[9:54] with
[9:58] you. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. I
[10:02] guess when it comes down to our natural
[10:05] way of thinking and the elements that we
[10:07] have to compare to, I guess that's as
[10:09] good as it can get. Silver, gold,
[10:12] diamonds, we consider all precious in
[10:14] this life, but nothing even comes close
[10:17] to thinking about what it means to be
[10:20] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[10:23] Nothing compares. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[10:26] God bless you. Welcome to the house of
[10:28] the Lord today. Preach the name of the
[10:30] Lord Jesus. Appreciate each one being
[10:31] here. If you're watching, God bless you
[10:33] as well. Thankful to be in the house of
[10:35] God again. One more time. Never know how
[10:37] many more of these times we're going to
[10:39] get like this. Amen. But as the Lord
[10:42] gives them to us, we take advantage of
[10:44] every one that we can get. Amen. Because
[10:46] you never know when the last one's going
[10:48] to be. Before we had that grand one on
[10:51] the other side. Praise. That's the one
[10:53] I'm looking forward to the most. Love
[10:55] you all. Enjoy our services. But that
[10:57] was the one I'm looking forward to.
[10:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord Jesus
[11:01] himself will be the orchestrator of that
[11:03] one. Amen. Although we believe he is
[11:05] here, too, right? Amen. So, God bless
[11:08] you. Amen. Let's just bow our heads for
[11:09] a word of prayer by his presence. Trust
[11:12] him to meet with us as he always does
[11:14] again today. Lord Jesus, we're very
[11:16] thankful again, Father, the grace, love,
[11:18] and mercy that you give us. Thank you
[11:19] for waking us up to see another
[11:21] beautiful day, Lord. And it is a
[11:23] beautiful day outside, Lord. Regardless
[11:25] of what the weather's like, it's a
[11:27] beautiful day because it's a day you've
[11:29] given us, Lord, to rejoice and be glad
[11:31] in. It's a day you've given us blessings
[11:33] in our lives, Lord, and strength and
[11:36] health and life and a sound mind and
[11:38] body, Lord, to worship you, to praise
[11:40] you, to learn of you, God, just to give
[11:42] ourselves into your hands, Father, for
[11:44] we have nothing else to give. All we
[11:46] have is ourselves, Lord. Our minds, our
[11:49] thoughts, our beings, our strength, all
[11:51] that we have, God, we give it to you,
[11:54] Lord. We just pray that your Holy Spirit
[11:55] would take complete control of this
[11:57] service today, Lord. And may everything
[11:59] we do as we worship you, God, be
[12:02] pleasing in your sight. We expect and
[12:04] believe, God, because this is your
[12:06] house, Lord, for you to be here again
[12:08] today and to move among us in a special
[12:11] supernatural way, God, in a powerful
[12:14] way, in a great way, Lord, for each one
[12:16] of us, for we're all a very needy
[12:18] people, God. go to the homes where they
[12:20] are now, Father. Maybe if they're
[12:21] watching, Lord, and just move upon them
[12:23] as well. Yes. Let it be to us, God,
[12:26] because we're a very needy people,
[12:28] desiring once again of your spirit to
[12:30] move. So may you grant it, Father. Bless
[12:32] us here in this place. All that is said
[12:35] and done, the songs that are sung. Lord,
[12:37] may you speak to us from your word. May
[12:39] everything be done pleasing to you,
[12:41] Lord. We rebuke every demonic spirit
[12:43] that would try to hurt, hind, or
[12:45] infiltrate this service in any way at
[12:47] all that you get the glory, honor, and
[12:49] praise for all that is said and done.
[12:50] Help those, Lord, who weren't able to
[12:52] make it for some reason. God, just pray
[12:54] that you bless them and help them move
[12:57] upon them in a special anointed way that
[12:59] make it the next appointed time. We give
[13:01] this service into your hands. We ask it
[13:03] in the precious, holy, lovely name of
[13:05] our Lord and Savior. We pray Jesus
[13:07] Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. You can be
[13:10] seated if you'd like.

[13:31] Jesus. Amen. I am one of the few.

[13:40] word I can claim it.
[13:43] Though the way may seem long though the
[13:46] opposition's strong for the bride
[13:49] there's a way
[13:51] proided when if I plan to go through
[13:55] just to hope will not do I must be

[19:56] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[19:59] Amen. Well, you may notice we say
[20:04] brother and sister around here.
[20:09] It's because we're a family and these
[20:15] folks are so
[20:17] near. When one has a
[20:22] heartaching, we all share the
[20:26] tears and rejoice in each
[20:30] victory in this family so dear. Well,
[20:35] I'm so
[20:37] glad I'm a part of the family of
[20:43] God. I've been
[20:45] washed in the
[20:48] fountain, cleansed by his
[20:52] blood,
[20:54] joined with Jesus as we travel this
[21:00] song. For I'm a part of the
[21:05] family, the family of
[21:11] God. From the
[21:14] door of an orphanage to the house of the
[21:20] king.
[21:22] No
[21:23] longer an
[21:25] outcast, a new song I
[21:29] sing. From
[21:31] rags to riches, from the weak to the
[21:37] strong. Well, I'm not
[21:40] worthy to be here, but praise God, I
[21:45] belong.
[21:47] Oh, I'm so
[21:49] glad I'm a part of the family of
[21:55] God. I've been
[21:57] washed in the
[22:00] fountain, cleansed by his
[22:05] blood,
[22:06] joined with
[22:08] Jesus as we travel this song. For I'm a
[22:15] part of the
[22:18] family, the family. Sing that last verse
[22:22] again. From the door of an orphanage to
[22:27] the house of the
[22:31] king. No
[22:33] longer an
[22:35] outcast. A new song I
[22:39] see from rags.
[22:42] come to rich in riches from the weak to
[22:47] the strong. Well, I'm not worthy at all
[22:51] to be here, but praise God, I belong.
[22:57] Oh, I'm so
[22:58] glad I'm a part of the family of God.
[23:06] I've been
[23:07] washed in the
[23:10] fountain. Cleansed by his
[23:15] blood,
[23:16] joined with
[23:18] Jesus as we travel this song. Oh, I'm a
[23:25] part of the
[23:27] family, the family of
[23:33] God. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[23:37] I'm so glad to be a part of this
[23:39] wonderful family. Amen.
[23:41] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. God
[23:44] blessed me with a wonderful family and
[23:46] I'm so thankful for it. My original
[23:48] family, my parents, my siblings, and God
[23:51] gave my wife and another family. Now
[23:54] God's given me another family and he's
[23:56] given you my family. And just so
[23:59] thankful to be a part of the family of
[24:00] God. Amen. Praise the Lord. I think it
[24:02] sums it all up to that line that says,
[24:05] "I'm not worthy." No, I'm not worthy,
[24:07] but praise God, I belong here. Amen.
[24:10] Doesn't that sum that's just sounds so
[24:12] perfect? Praise the Lord. People say,
[24:14] "How can you be arrog?" It's not
[24:15] arrogance. Amen. Cuz I I in my self, I
[24:19] know I'm not worthy to be here. So, it's
[24:20] not arrogance. But praise God, I belong
[24:23] here because he told me I belong here.
[24:26] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. I'm
[24:29] so thankful for that. Amen. Praise the
[24:32] Lord God. Glad to be in the house of the
[24:33] Lord today. Amen. Glad to see the saints
[24:36] of God here. Amen. The Lord richly bless
[24:39] you. We have a few prayer requests to
[24:40] bring to your attention. Want to
[24:42] remember Sister Sheilia today. Uh not
[24:44] with us.
[24:45] She's excuse me supposed to be on her
[24:48] way back uh from her trip up to Prescott
[24:50] with her sister in California and back.
[24:53] Uh so please remember her in prayer.
[24:56] She's coming back this afternoon. That
[24:58] was the last plan I heard from her. So,
[25:00] I'm assuming those plans are still the
[25:02] same. So, please remember her in prayer.
[25:04] Uh, also got a text from Sister Sharas
[25:07] her and the children were not feeling
[25:09] well this morning. Uh, so please
[25:11] remember them in prayer. Brother Danny
[25:13] said he is getting ready to come to
[25:15] church with with brother Dennis and uh
[25:18] developed some stomach problems. So, uh
[25:21] he stayed at home said he was going to
[25:22] be streaming. Trust you are. God bless
[25:24] you, brother.
[25:25] just pray that the Lord touch your
[25:27] stomach and um give you healing this
[25:30] morning. Amen. Uh I have want to
[25:33] continue to remember u sister Lydia in
[25:36] prayer, Pats in prayer. Um I believe as
[25:41] far as I now know, um as of last week,
[25:45] Sister Anna and brother Steve were are
[25:48] planning to make this their church home.
[25:50] So u but they're still living in the
[25:53] mountains. So, I think they're coming
[25:54] back and forth. So, we'll see. Um,
[25:57] probably maybe a little sporadic till
[25:59] maybe they're leaving here. But anyway,
[26:01] please remember them in prayer. Uh, got
[26:04] a text from Sister Matise that said that
[26:07] uh she's um getting herself ready for a
[26:11] big change in her life. Uh, and she's
[26:14] going to be out witnessing to street
[26:17] people uh with Dominique who now wants
[26:20] to be called Andrew. So, uh, please
[26:22] remember her. Um, the I I I am always
[26:28] thankful for someone who has a heart for
[26:30] other people and who wants to get to try
[26:33] to talk to other people about Jesus.
[26:36] Amen. So, uh, praise the Lord. So, just
[26:39] pray the Lord would just be with her and
[26:41] help her in that situation, keep her
[26:43] safe, uh, because street people can be
[26:46] unforgiving uh, sometimes. But if the
[26:50] Lord has ordained her to do this, if the
[26:52] Lord has called her, which she believes
[26:54] he has her to do this, and I believe God
[26:56] will help her and protect her and keep
[26:58] her. Uh so please remember that in
[27:00] prayer. Amen. That the Lord be with her
[27:04] as well. I have not heard I'm assuming
[27:07] uh Captain Zach are on their way. I have
[27:09] not heard from them. If they're not
[27:11] coming, they tell me. So uh I'm assuming
[27:13] they're probably on the way. Sometimes
[27:15] when you got three little kitties, it's
[27:16] can be challenging to get everybody all
[27:18] together. And also, um maybe we'll be a
[27:21] little bit late, so please remember them
[27:23] in prayer. Micah text me uh just a few
[27:26] minutes ago and mentioned that um he was
[27:29] getting a lot of in your left ear,
[27:30] right? A lot of buildup in his left ear.
[27:33] Uh and it it almost wax build up, I
[27:37] should say, closed off. Um, and uh, he's
[27:42] just praying. He believes it. He's
[27:44] gotten to where it's he thinks it's
[27:46] worse because it's kind of muffled now.
[27:48] Uh, but he said he could go to the
[27:51] doctor and get it cleaned out, but he
[27:52] said God's cleaned it out before, so
[27:54] he's going to believe God's going to
[27:55] clean it out again. Amen. So, that
[27:57] speaks for itself. Amen. So, we're going
[28:00] to bind in faith with him and believe
[28:02] that the Lord's just going to clean that
[28:03] out. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, remember
[28:06] that. Anyone else have a request on your
[28:08] heart
[28:09] today? Amen. Just the envelope so far.
[28:12] Sister, I'm so sorry. I forgot it
[28:15] written down, but my um follow up to
[28:19] neurologist. So, we'll discuss the
[28:21] results of all of the EEG and praying
[28:25] that everything is normal so that I can
[28:27] get my back.
[28:30] Amen.
[28:31] Lord, let's remember that prayer,
[28:33] please. Amen. This system Uh sometimes I
[28:37] think the medical system grinds more
[28:40] slowly than the judicial system which
[28:42] seems to take forever to get anything
[28:45] done. Uh thank God s God's had sister
[28:48] Julie in a position to where she's been
[28:50] able to maintain herself with a place to
[28:52] live and a vehicle but she can't drive
[28:55] it. It's paid for. Uh or she'd be on the
[28:58] street. I mean these people have taken
[29:00] so long to get a driver's license.
[29:04] uh what's a person supposed to do? Uh
[29:07] but please remember her in prayer.
[29:09] Thursday the everything's going to be
[29:11] fine. Perfect. Get a license back and
[29:13] all will be well. Amen. Anyone
[29:16] else?
[29:18] Please have an unspoken. Lord knows our
[29:22] heart. Let's all stand for
[29:29] good Jesus.
[29:35] a little settled. We'll have
[29:37] Dennis take these needs to the Lord for
[29:40] us this morning.
[29:48] Thank you, Jesus.
[29:50] Gracious heavenly father, it's a
[29:52] privilege once again to be in your house
[29:56] of prayer, your house of worship, your
[29:59] house to hear your revealed word that
[30:02] you have sent through a prophet to get a
[30:05] bride ready for a rapture. We can
[30:08] remember in your word as Janus and
[30:11] Jambas withtood Moses, so are they of
[30:15] reprobate might concerning the faith.
[30:19] And Lord, we are really put to the test
[30:22] in this late hour, Lord, to see that so
[30:25] much has come up that is fighting your
[30:28] revealed word. Lord, help us to have the
[30:32] mind of Christ. Yes, Lord. You said in
[30:34] your word, we must have the mind of
[30:37] Christ who was in the form of God,
[30:40] thought it not equal to be with God. And
[30:43] Lord, that's your word. And Lord, let us
[30:46] meditate on you. Let us think of of you.
[30:51] Let us be in the spirit of prayer. Lord
[30:54] Jesus, let us with all that's in our
[30:58] heart to stay with your word. Lord, you
[31:01] are greater than anything that devil can
[31:04] throw at us. Greater he is in us than he
[31:08] is in the world. Amen. When Satan comes
[31:10] like a flood, you'll raise a standard.
[31:13] Oh father, every redemptive blessing
[31:17] that you have put in your word is for us
[31:20] believers. Hallelujah. And by faith we
[31:23] must claim it. Amen. Lord, it's like the
[31:25] prophet said, if you're sick, claim it.
[31:28] Lord, let us let it be a reality in our
[31:32] hearts that we have been healed. We are
[31:35] more than conquerors in the name of
[31:38] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh, Father,
[31:41] there are some that are sick this
[31:43] morning that need a touch from you. My
[31:46] brother with a stomach problem and and
[31:50] sister Shereiah and the children that
[31:53] are sick this morning and everyone else
[31:56] that they need to touch and maybe
[31:58] they're hearing the message on on the
[32:02] streaming. Father, may you touch him.
[32:05] You are God limited by barriers and by
[32:08] structures. As we pray, we call thee on
[32:11] the saint to minister to each and
[32:15] everyone. For thou are a high priest
[32:18] that can be touched by the feelings of
[32:20] our infirmities. And by your stripes we
[32:23] are healed. We claim it, Father. We come
[32:27] to those living waters, that fountain
[32:30] that shall never run dry. Let us drink
[32:33] to an overflowing portion. Let us not
[32:38] walk uh in a place where oh I can only
[32:42] get so much from God. Oh, I can only
[32:44] bother God so much. Oh, Father, you want
[32:48] us to call on your name. You want us to
[32:51] stand on your word. Oh, whatever it
[32:53] takes. Oh Lord, there's so many signs
[32:56] that is displaying that you're coming as
[32:59] soon as your prophet said, it's your
[33:02] grace that you warn of people.
[33:04] Hallelujah. judgment. Amen. Father, we
[33:08] know that Noah was faithful for 120
[33:12] years and he preached your word and they
[33:16] mocked him and they laughed at him.
[33:18] There's no rain from the skies. How can
[33:21] that be without We get our water from
[33:24] the dew that comes up from the earth in
[33:27] the morning. And father, your word was
[33:30] fulfilled. There are mockers that are
[33:33] against your word this day. Even
[33:36] followers of this message, Father, that
[33:38] think that we have a lot of time. Oh,
[33:41] every day we have to walk in your
[33:45] spirit. We have to be led of your word.
[33:48] Amen. Lord, everyone else that raised
[33:51] their hand that need a touch from you.
[33:54] Oh, we just believe that their cup will
[33:58] runth over that your blessings will
[34:00] flow. And father, bless our brother as
[34:03] he labors faithfully to bring your word.
[34:07] The best part and the most important
[34:09] part is for our hearts to be humble and
[34:13] softened to receive your word this
[34:16] morning. In your name we pray. In the
[34:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[34:21] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[34:23] seated if you'd like.

[34:29] to have brother Zach back. Glad he's

[34:41] thankful that the Lord keep us healthy
[34:43] and strong. Amen. I'm so thankful.
[34:47] I think my knees are almost 100% now.
[34:49] They're just just every once in a while
[34:51] I feel like I knew there was something
[34:53] there, but they're just u I'll probably
[34:56] still wear braces on them as I work, but
[35:00] one one brace during the day had fell
[35:02] down at my shin and I didn't even know
[35:04] it. It wasn't even on my knee anymore.
[35:06] And I was just working away and I and it
[35:09] was kind of chilly in Minnesota this
[35:11] week. So, I started feeling it cool
[35:13] because it sweats when I work and and it
[35:16] started feeling cool and I what is my
[35:17] what's wrong and things down on my sh I
[35:20] don't even know it's uh wasn't even
[35:23] protecting my knee but uh they're doing
[35:25] so much better and I'm so thankful to
[35:27] God for that. Amen.
[35:29] uh also was able to uh attend a
[35:33] wonderful I was so blessed and so
[35:35] honored to attend a wonderful ceremony
[35:37] yesterday when our precious brother
[35:39] little Tom call him little I guess they
[35:41] still call him little even though he's
[35:43] up here now uh got baptized in the name
[35:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So such
[35:49] a blessing to see that. Amen. So

[35:53] be invited for that. Amen. That was such
[35:56] a blessing. Amen. enjoyed that very
[35:58] much. Unfortunately, they had to go back

[36:04] you would. Uh, also an announcement uh
[36:08] before we uh go to this next song. Micah
[36:11] was able to get by request I think
[36:13] Sister Pat uh to actually have
[36:16] captioning on our services. Now, uh I
[36:20] the way I talk, I'm very surprised that
[36:23] caption can actually caption me, but I
[36:26] guess said it's working really well. So,
[36:29] if it's working really well, I guess I'm
[36:31] maybe not as bad at my annunciation as I
[36:33] think I am. Uh, so it's working really
[36:36] well. So, the streaming and I guess the
[36:39] arc is no man the archiving too the
[36:42] capt. So, the caption is going to be on
[36:44] the services from now on. So, since it's
[36:47] working real well and it's doing good
[36:50] and hopefully it's a blessing if anyone
[36:51] needs that. Uh, so I just want to let
[36:55] everybody know that's a part of uh our
[36:58] streaming. Amen. So, I'm thankful that
[37:00] Michael was able to work that out for
[37:02] Sister Pat and it works good. So, I'm
[37:04] thankful for that. So, amen. Praise the
[37:07] Lord. He's good to us, isn't he? Amen.

[41:37] well when I was in the hospital two
[41:40] weeks years ago I had a
[41:46] supernatural Lord and I just didn't
[41:48] realize it was happening.

[42:21] Jesus. I'm so thankful. Anybody else?
[42:27] Yeah, I have a testimony that came my
[42:29] way. I wasn't looking for it after
[42:32] service uh this past Sunday. Uh there
[42:36] was a an app that was uh displaying how
[42:40] many earthquakes was happening Sunday.
[42:43] It was all over the world from Papa New
[42:47] Guinea, New Zealand, uh, America, uh,
[42:51] Africa. It was just, it was so sobering
[42:55] that it became overwhelming. Yes. And I
[42:57] I couldn't almost fathom all this at one
[43:02] time and now there's eruptions in Japan.
[43:05] There's eruptions of volcanoes all over
[43:07] the world. They say 45 volcanoes right
[43:10] now are are have erupted or some are
[43:13] going to erupt and and right now it's
[43:16] it's so sobering. Then I realized the
[43:21] majority of the world cannot embrace
[43:24] what is really taking place. It's for us
[43:28] believers. Yeah. And uh just to further
[43:31] verify all these earthquakes, I went to
[43:34] the US uh
[43:36] geological system and sure enough, they
[43:39] were reporting them as well. So I I just
[43:43] believe
[43:44] u people that it's time that we're going
[43:47] home soon. Amen. Because remember, the
[43:49] world can't see this. The Christian
[43:51] world cannot see it. Yes. Amen. But by
[43:54] God's grace, we know we know exactly
[43:56] what's going on. Yes. Amen. Praise the
[43:59] Lord. Yeah, that thing you s me. What's
[44:02] going on under our feet? Yes. Amen. It's
[44:05] a good way to put it. Yes. Praise the
[44:07] Lord. People hold it like it's steady be
[44:10] here. I even had the guys at the job
[44:13] joke about we were in California.
[44:15] California sinking and I looked I
[44:19] because I was a little amazed. I'm like
[44:20] absolutely yeah people don't realize it
[44:22] but yeah it's going to slide into the
[44:24] ocean. They all agree. But then of
[44:26] course they come up and say, "Well, they
[44:28] gonna be thousands of years from now or
[44:30] I said I wouldn't bet on that, guys.
[44:32] Yes, I wouldn't I wouldn't bet on it
[44:34] being that far away." But that's what
[44:36] humanity always does. They think they
[44:38] said, "Well, this is going to happen,
[44:39] but it's going to be millions of years
[44:41] or thousands of years or it's going to
[44:42] be, you know, so far down the road, we
[44:45] don't even think about it or worry about
[44:46] it, but it's shaking." Amen. It's
[44:48] prophesied and it's shaking, saying,
[44:51] "Amen. We are we are here." Praise the
[44:53] Lord. we make the most of every moment
[44:55] the Lord has gi us while we're here.
[44:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's stand to
[45:00] our feet if we could. We're going to go
[45:01] ahead and change the order of service.
[45:03] You turn over with me to Acts chapter 2.
[45:06] We'll finish up this last part. It'll be
[45:09] part three of the bride adoption part
[45:11] 11. The bride part three. Um it should
[45:14] be the last part.
[45:18] Amen. And so we will go back over to
[45:19] Acts chapter 2 uh and begin reading with
[45:23] verse one here again and try to as I
[45:26] said we'll finish this today here Lord
[45:29] willing.
[45:31] Amen. Praise the
[45:34] Lord. Acts chapter
[45:36] 2 and verse
[45:39] one. Before we read it, could we just
[45:41] bow our heads for another word of
[45:43] prayer? Lord Jesus, very thankful again,
[45:46] Lord, of all that you do for us, Lord.
[45:48] You are so good to us. Uh how many
[45:51] times, how many ways could we express
[45:54] our gratitude, our thanks, our feelings,
[45:57] Lord, of gratitude of what we feel
[45:59] towards what you've done for us, what
[46:00] you're doing for us, Lord. God, uh,
[46:03] Brother Brandham said so many times, we
[46:05] look back at what you've done for us,
[46:07] Lord, and we look forward to the things
[46:09] that you're going to do and completely
[46:11] miss what you're doing for us right now.
[46:13] But Lord, help our eyes to be open. Yes,
[46:16] Lord. Lord, give us anoint us with that
[46:18] to recognize and realize what's
[46:20] happening right now for for your bride,
[46:23] for us in this day. recognizing that uh
[46:27] this group Lord this family these people
[46:30] God that are international are uh
[46:34] beginning to wake up and recognize
[46:36] realize what's going on what's happening
[46:38] yes uh the things is happening around us

[46:44] so many uh acknowledgments around the
[46:48] world of of very brilliant smart men,
[46:52] women, people God finding out these
[46:55] things that maybe you wouldn't have
[46:56] known in a later time. But God, we're
[46:59] living in that space age. We're living
[47:00] in that time where information is uh is
[47:04] prevalent and uh instant around the
[47:07] world. And to see what's happening,
[47:09] Lord, and to know God, it is very
[47:11] sobering. It's very uh a shaking to
[47:14] realize, God, the hour of the day that
[47:16] we live. But knowing, God, that this
[47:18] time is be. We knowing that that time
[47:21] prophesied to be God is here. Yes, Lord.
[47:24] We're not looking for it down the road.
[47:26] We know that it's happening right now.
[47:28] Yes. Whether it's in its infinite stage
[47:30] or it's just beginning or we're in the
[47:32] middle of it. Whatever it is, God, we
[47:34] know that it's here. We believe, God,
[47:36] and we just stand true to your word.
[47:39] Continue to live that good, humble,
[47:41] simple Christian life and dedicate
[47:44] ourselves and consecrate ourselves into
[47:46] your hands and expect, Lord, that you to
[47:48] speak to us and to minister to us and
[47:51] draw us closer to you, Lord.
[47:53] In our lives, we become more like you.
[47:56] Our lives are to be reflections of
[47:58] yours. Our ways are to mimic your ways,
[48:02] God. Our thoughts are to be your
[48:04] thoughts, God, in this day, Lord, as
[48:06] you've given us the your own mind, the
[48:09] mind of Christ, to be in us in this last
[48:11] day, to continue to walk this path and
[48:14] to live this life and to be those
[48:16] written epistles read of all men. Yes.
[48:19] Bless us, Lord. We commit ourselves to
[48:21] you. Pray that your Holy Spirit would
[48:23] take complete control of the remaining
[48:25] part of this service. Lord, speak
[48:27] through these lips, Lord. Anoint our
[48:29] ears to receive. That it be and
[48:31] accomplish that that you send it forth
[48:33] for whatever your purpose and reason is
[48:35] for it. We're all here today, God, or
[48:37] we're watching, Lord, to uh to to
[48:40] declare that we are yours and expect
[48:42] you, God, to do what you said you would
[48:45] do in your word. We receive it now,
[48:47] Father, and pray, God, in the name of
[48:49] the Lord Jesus Christ, it be so. And we
[48:52] dedicate this self and ourselves and
[48:54] this service into your hands in Jesus
[48:57] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise
[49:00] the Lord Jesus. Uh, Acts chapter 2,
[49:04] begin with verse one again. Uh, once
[49:06] again, and when the day of Pentecost was
[49:08] fully come, they were all with one
[49:10] accord in one place. And suddenly there
[49:11] came a sound from heaven as a rushing
[49:13] mighty wind and fil all the house where
[49:15] they were sitting. There appeared unto
[49:16] them cloven tongues like as a fire, and
[49:19] it sat upon each of them, and they were
[49:21] all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
[49:23] began to speak with other tongues, as
[49:25] the spirit gave them utterance. And
[49:28] there was and there were dwelling at
[49:30] Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every
[49:32] nation under heaven. Now when this was
[49:35] noised abroad, the multitude came
[49:36] together and were confounded because
[49:38] that every man heard them speak in his
[49:40] own language. You could be seated if
[49:42] you'd like.
[49:44] Amen. We see it again reading the birth
[49:47] of the church. Amen.
[49:50] the birth of the church taking here on
[49:51] the day of uh happening and taking place
[49:54] here on the day of Pentecost when God
[49:56] came on his people, the 120 was in the
[49:59] upper room and baptized them and filled
[50:01] them with his spirit which began the
[50:04] movement that we know now is in its
[50:07] final stages. Uh began the movement
[50:10] here. We can read history. We can read
[50:13] the beginning of what we recognize now
[50:16] to be the finalization of what we're
[50:18] going through in life now spiritually in
[50:21] this world with us as a part of that
[50:24] group as a part of that bride finishing
[50:27] up what was started here. Amen.
[50:29] Finishing it up the same way it was
[50:31] started in a uh but in a mature way.
[50:36] Amen. in a in a maturity where the bride
[50:39] has to got to the place that she knows
[50:42] what God wants done with his word. Amen.
[50:46] She knows what to speak and not to
[50:49] speak. She knows where to stand and she
[50:52] knows where to be. She knows what the
[50:55] Holy Spirit is leading her to do. Amen.
[50:58] And she knows what this age means and
[51:01] where we're at in this age. Amen. Amen.
[51:03] Thus the bride in this part three that
[51:07] we are that we are that we've gone
[51:09] through and recognize through history
[51:12] which we just touch on briefly again
[51:14] through the history and recognize where
[51:16] God has brought this bride from through
[51:19] and to Amen. Romans chapter 1. Uh
[51:24] there's one verse of scripture I want to
[51:25] read
[51:27] here. Romans chapter 1 verse1 17. Romans
[51:32] 1:17 was the scripture that started this
[51:35] reformation. The scripture that started
[51:37] the beginning of this ball rolling to
[51:39] bring it through the stages that this
[51:42] bride went through when she went through
[51:44] justification. then went into
[51:46] sanctification which came into the
[51:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person
[51:50] of Christ himself living in the
[51:53] individual. Amen. As you recognize the
[51:56] as we call the fullness of the word of
[51:58] fulfillment of the word. Amen. Uh Romans
[52:01] 1:17 says, "For therein is the
[52:04] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[52:06] to faith as it is written." Amen. As we
[52:11] know it was already written. Amen.
[52:13] Habach. Amen. has written that the just
[52:18] the just shall live by faith. Amen.
[52:22] Praise the Lord. And uh Martin Luther
[52:26] put an exclamation at the end of that uh
[52:29] that's not scriptural, but I'll go with
[52:31] him on his exclamation. The just shall
[52:33] live by faith alone. Amen. That was his
[52:38] justification. That was his message of
[52:40] justification. Praise the Lord. And at
[52:43] that time that life that sparked that
[52:45] life again remember the blade that came
[52:47] out of the ground as that blade came
[52:49] into the ground and life began to show
[52:51] itself again. Life. Praise the Lord.
[52:54] Life was in the blade. Amen. Life was in
[52:56] this man. He was still a Catholic. Still
[52:59] still in the Catholic church. Still a
[53:01] priest in the Catholic had influence
[53:02] over uh o over the Catholic people. He
[53:05] was still there. But when God revealed
[53:07] this to him, praise the Lord. God
[53:10] chooses the vessel that he wants. God
[53:13] chose this man to recognize and reveal
[53:16] to him that the just shall live by faith
[53:18] which started that movement of
[53:20] justification. A amen. And the bride
[53:23] came through the life that life of the
[53:26] bride from where we just read in Acts
[53:28] through to this time came through those
[53:31] church ages. The life of God is the
[53:33] stream. I thought about drawing it, but
[53:35] I'm not a very good artist.
[53:37] drawing that light that came right
[53:39] through every church age. Amen. The life
[53:41] of God went through every church age.
[53:45] Amen. And it brought life. That's why
[53:48] there was light in some of in in all of
[53:50] those circles. There was light. There
[53:52] was some light in all the circles. Some
[53:54] more than others, but there was always
[53:56] light. That light was the life that went
[53:59] through every church age. It was the
[54:01] life of God. Amen. And that life went
[54:04] through each church age. And as that
[54:06] light went through each church age,
[54:07] which represented the Holy Ghost, went
[54:09] through each church age, it picked out
[54:12] everyone that was obviously of course in
[54:14] the mind of God before the foundation of
[54:16] the world. Those people come to the
[54:18] place of maturity in themselves when the
[54:21] Holy Spirit came through and picked that
[54:23] person out to believe and receive the
[54:26] truth for their day. Whatever it was.
[54:29] Amen. If it was St. Barton, if it was
[54:31] Martin Luther, if it was justification
[54:33] or Wesley, whichever age it was in,
[54:36] there was a life, there was light, amen,
[54:39] that shone upon every one of them.
[54:41] Brother Brandham talks about uh a
[54:44] manufacturing, I believe it was, company
[54:46] that he had went to. And at the end of
[54:48] the day, uh they it was a metal
[54:51] fabrication and and all and and cutting
[54:54] and making stuff and shavings
[54:56] everywhere, metal all over the floor and
[54:58] everywhere. and said at the end of the
[55:00] day they'd send a big magnet through the
[55:02] middle of this factory. Amen. And this
[55:05] big magnet would go through the middle
[55:06] of this factory and it would pull up all
[55:08] the loose things, all the loose shavings
[55:10] and all the loose uh stuff that had been
[55:13] uh shaved off. The iron had been molded,
[55:16] mated, made, shaved, went up to this
[55:19] magnet would stick to this magnet so it
[55:21] clean all the metal off the floor. All
[55:24] the metal was then off the floor. Well,
[55:26] that great Holy Spirit magnet went
[55:29] through every age. Yes, it went through
[55:32] every church age. And as it went through
[55:34] that church age, it would bring the
[55:36] believer to itself. It would it would
[55:38] bring that Holy Ghost magnet would go
[55:40] through the church age. And as it went
[55:42] through that age, it would bring life.
[55:45] Amen. Amen. And and it might it might go
[55:48] to a group of 10,000 people and there's
[55:51] one person, right? But that magnet would
[55:54] find that one person and draw him to
[55:56] himself. Amen. Praise the Lord. If I be
[56:00] lifted up, I'll do what? Draw all men to
[56:04] me. Amen. All those that that are his.
[56:07] Yes. He might go through. I remember a
[56:09] time brother Random said they went to uh
[56:12] several days of meetings. I believe it
[56:14] was in Chicago if I could remember
[56:16] right. went to seven days of several
[56:18] days of meetings and he preached and he
[56:21] preached the next night. They had
[56:22] service the next night. It was the third
[56:24] or fourth night. I forget which it was.
[56:26] Brother Brandon went back to his the the
[56:28] the organizers and said, "The one person
[56:31] God sent me for here came in tonight. We
[56:34] can call we can close it
[56:36] down." The one person I believe was
[56:40] Chicago. out of all those meetings, out
[56:42] of all those people, he said, "The one
[56:45] person God sent me for here for came in
[56:47] tonight. We can we can
[56:49] leave." I don't think they did. They
[56:52] They're like, "Well, Brother Random, we
[56:53] already had these services set up and
[56:55] people are coming, blah, blah, blah." I
[56:56] think they said, but he said the one one
[56:58] person, praise the Lord, Brother Ram
[57:01] talked about one person being in Tucson,
[57:03] one person being in uh uh California,
[57:07] one person being here, one person there.
[57:09] I believe it's going to be more than
[57:10] that. But you know, he said it'd be one
[57:12] in a million, right? But what
[57:15] what when we think about the life of
[57:18] God when it goes through, I think about
[57:21] all the people I've known in my life. I
[57:24] think about the friends I have when I
[57:25] was a kid. I think about the people I've
[57:27] known in my jobs. I think about uh all
[57:30] the acquaintances, the people I've met
[57:32] through my life. And I
[57:34] think, who who am I that God would have
[57:38] chose
[57:39] me? Who am I that when that magnet came
[57:43] over, all the people that I've ever
[57:44] known, all the people I've ever worked
[57:46] with, all the my friends I had, I don't
[57:48] know any of them that's followed the
[57:49] Lord. I don't know my my good friends
[57:51] growing up, I don't know of any of them
[57:53] that followed the Lord. And there might
[57:55] be Christians as they call themselves.
[57:57] Amen. But I don't know any of them. And
[57:59] I think why me at all these people at
[58:03] all these ones I've met and that at when
[58:05] that magnet come across and that life
[58:08] dropped down it hit me and and and and I
[58:10] saw it and I believed it because it was
[58:14] for me. There was something inside cried
[58:17] out to it. Amen. We went to Tommy's
[58:20] baptism yesterday and brother Chuck King
[58:22] was there and um eats his food just like
[58:25] Micah does. One thing at a time. I sat
[58:28] there and watched him. He ate all of his
[58:29] broccoli. Then he ate all of this. He
[58:31] said, and he said, and he said, "Yeah,
[58:33] but I saved the steak for last." Amen. I
[58:36] know Micah does the same thing. Only eat
[58:38] one item at a time. All of it. All not
[58:40] just one at a time. All of one thing and
[58:42] all of the next. Anyway, he was there
[58:44] and we was talking about um his uh
[58:48] enlightenment, his time of becoming a
[58:50] Christian, seeing the truth, and he had
[58:52] gone out in the world and stuff. And I
[58:54] hope he doesn't mind me repeating this.
[58:56] I'm sure he probably doesn't, but um he
[58:59] was had gone out in the world as a young
[59:00] man and uh uh his relatives. I think it
[59:04] was his uncle maybe. I please forgive me
[59:06] if I may have gotten the details wrong,
[59:08] but part of his family was serving the
[59:10] Lord, listening to the message. They
[59:11] didn't have a church. It was in Calgary,
[59:14] didn't have a church in Calgary at the
[59:16] time, so they stayed at home and
[59:17] listened to tapes. And he had gotten his
[59:19] life to the place to where Sunday meant
[59:21] nothing. And like most people, most
[59:24] people Sunday is just another day. You
[59:26] come to church, you go out and you
[59:28] you're headed to church and you just see
[59:30] people doing all kinds of stuff. They
[59:31] It's just another day to them. Uh I
[59:34] talked to the guys on the job. Uh and
[59:37] and and I tell them, you know, I fly
[59:40] home on Saturday, then I go back to work
[59:42] on Sunday cuz I have church. I minister.
[59:46] I preach. Um, brother Bam said 45
[59:48] minutes anointed preaching is as bad as
[59:51] the 8 hour of hard labor day, right? And
[59:54] so, uh, so they don't recognize it's
[59:57] just another day to them. They go do
[59:59] stuff or whatever. Sunday means nothing.
[1:00:02] It's it's just another day. And it got
[1:00:04] into Brother Chuck. He said it just it
[1:00:06] just was another day. He didn't even
[1:00:07] think about it. So he thought, well, you
[1:00:10] know what? Then of course he knows now
[1:00:13] what it was. And of course, as he tells
[1:00:15] the story, I understand the Lord put it
[1:00:18] on his heart to go see this uncle and
[1:00:22] and his wife. And he didn't even think
[1:00:24] anything about it. He said, "Well, I
[1:00:25] haven't seen him in a long time. I'll
[1:00:27] just go see him." Well, it happened to
[1:00:28] be a Sunday. He didn't realize it was
[1:00:30] Sunday. To him, again, it was just
[1:00:32] another day. He's just going to go see
[1:00:34] him. He goes in and at 10:00 or 10:30 in
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:39] morning, I think I asked you, the Lord
[1:00:41] setting you up. He goes to the house.
[1:00:44] Nobody he doesn't hear anything. His is
[1:00:47] He's looking. He finally knocks on the
[1:00:49] door and he stands there and finally his
[1:00:51] uncle, I believe it was, come to the
[1:00:52] door and he could hear the tape play.
[1:00:55] They were listening to a tape because
[1:00:56] they they didn't have church. I was
[1:00:58] listening to a tape and he said, "Oh, I
[1:01:00] didn't mean to bother." And he said,
[1:01:01] "Oh, no. Come on in. Come on in." And he
[1:01:03] started listening to that voice again.
[1:01:05] and and you know like I do and and I and
[1:01:10] I'm
[1:01:11] not making Brother Brandham God, but
[1:01:14] when that voice speaks, when God speaks
[1:01:16] to you, it's just something that uh and
[1:01:20] and I know I've told you when I was a
[1:01:22] kid, I would lay I would crawl up in my
[1:01:24] parents' bed and just push a tape that
[1:01:26] they had the the tape in the tape
[1:01:28] player. I just push the tape and just
[1:01:29] lay there and listen to Brother Brandon
[1:01:30] as a little kid, right? I don't know
[1:01:33] why. I just did it. It just there's just
[1:01:36] something about it. And when it's in
[1:01:38] you, when that magnet goes across, see,
[1:01:41] anything that wasn't magnetized to the
[1:01:43] magnet stayed on the floor. Wood
[1:01:46] shavings would not come up to the
[1:01:47] magnet. Right. Anything that was tied
[1:01:50] down to the world or to the floor was
[1:01:53] tied down, didn't go up to the magnet.
[1:01:55] Amen. Anything that was nonmagnetized.
[1:01:58] It didn't aluminum wouldn't go up to the
[1:02:00] magnet. But when it strikes that it's
[1:02:03] magnetized, it goes up to the magnet. It
[1:02:06] speaks to those that have already in
[1:02:10] them the material to receive what's
[1:02:12] being done, what's being said. Right?
[1:02:14] Amen. And the material that was in the
[1:02:16] shavings that would receive the magnet,
[1:02:18] the the shavings went up to the magnet.
[1:02:20] Everything else just laid on the floor.
[1:02:23] It didn't do anything to wood shavings
[1:02:24] or anything else because there was
[1:02:26] nothing in it to receive the magnet.
[1:02:29] There was nothing in it that it that it
[1:02:31] witnessed to. And God can pass over
[1:02:33] multitudes of people, saints, and it
[1:02:36] means nothing to them. But when it
[1:02:38] passed over you, it spoke to you. It was
[1:02:42] something that ministered to your heart.
[1:02:43] It was something that you identified
[1:02:45] with because it was already in you to be
[1:02:48] identified by. So when it came
[1:02:51] over, it's like the things I remember my
[1:02:54] dad said uh when when my sister came and
[1:02:58] first introduced brother Bam, he told
[1:03:00] her, he said, "You I taught you better
[1:03:02] than to follow man." She said, "Daddy,
[1:03:04] we don't follow man. Just come and
[1:03:06] see." Best three words I know of. Just
[1:03:10] come and see. We went to church finally.
[1:03:13] And my dad said, "This is what I've been
[1:03:15] looking for my whole life." Amen. There
[1:03:18] it is. Praise the Lord. That magnet came
[1:03:21] over and what was in there responded.
[1:03:25] The deep call to the deep. It responded
[1:03:27] to the magnet. Praise God. And it spoke
[1:03:30] to him. And that magnet has gone through
[1:03:32] every church age. So many times I think
[1:03:35] message people get the feeling like
[1:03:37] we're like the only bride. We are not.
[1:03:41] Amen. We are not. Down through the ages
[1:03:44] that light came through. That magnet
[1:03:46] came through. the Holy Spirit came
[1:03:48] through each age. Now, we've already
[1:03:50] recognized and saw through scripture and
[1:03:52] uh through the quotes that the the Holy
[1:03:55] Spirit wasn't able to operate as much
[1:03:58] during those dark ages because there
[1:04:00] were it was bound at the door of those
[1:04:02] creeds and domas. It didn't have a way
[1:04:05] to move. But when that light came on
[1:04:07] this man called Martin Luther and it
[1:04:10] spoke to him, it was like something was
[1:04:12] there to respond to it. There was
[1:04:15] something already in Martin Luther to
[1:04:17] respond to that. So when he saw it, it
[1:04:20] struck him such a way that he completely
[1:04:24] defied the thing, the place, the
[1:04:27] organization. He had dedicated his
[1:04:29] entire life to the Catholic Church. He
[1:04:33] defied it by saying this is what the
[1:04:36] scripture says. The just shall live by
[1:04:39] faith. And of course he said alone, "The
[1:04:42] just shall live by faith." what you so
[1:04:44] it started making
[1:04:45] him hate the indulgences and
[1:04:49] the how how bad the people had gotten.
[1:04:54] They were
[1:04:55] just they just live any kind of life,
[1:04:58] right? And they would just write off
[1:05:00] said, "It's okay. You're fine. Don't
[1:05:02] worry about it. We'll pray you out of
[1:05:03] purgatory or come and do your
[1:05:04] indulgences or pay me enough money you
[1:05:07] can go go get drunk at the bar. Just
[1:05:09] make sure you come and pay no. Garnering
[1:05:12] the wealth of the world. Of course, um,
[1:05:16] Revelation 6. Amen. Weighing it out.
[1:05:18] Amen. Trying to take in the wealth of
[1:05:21] the world. But this man received that
[1:05:24] light. Amen. And as that light came
[1:05:27] across, a springrig came up and that
[1:05:29] that there was life in that blade. But
[1:05:33] then when when that age began to wne
[1:05:35] away and a new age begin to come in, the
[1:05:39] light moved on. Now it's the same light,
[1:05:43] that same light, that same light, that
[1:05:45] same Holy Ghost. Amen. It came through
[1:05:48] the blade. The blade was nice. But then
[1:05:51] another one came out as it as it phased
[1:05:53] into the next section. That stalk came
[1:05:55] forth. Had the same life. It had had
[1:06:00] more light on it. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:06:04] sanctification has more light to it than
[1:06:06] justification, right? But you have to
[1:06:09] have the justification to get you to
[1:06:12] sanctification,
[1:06:13] right? And they had it had to have the
[1:06:16] blade before the stalk could come forth.
[1:06:19] But as the stalk came forth, the life
[1:06:21] went and moved on into the stalk. Amen.
[1:06:24] Into sanctification. Well, as the tossel
[1:06:27] came out and the sh be to show itself
[1:06:30] and the restoration of the gifts and the
[1:06:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost, then came
[1:06:33] forth another life, but it was still the
[1:06:36] same Holy Ghost the whole time. Amen.
[1:06:38] Another another Holy Ghost. There's not
[1:06:41] a dozen Holy Ghost. There's one, right?
[1:06:44] And as that same spirit went through, it
[1:06:47] went through picking and finding who
[1:06:48] there was. What happened to the rest of
[1:06:51] them? They died out.
[1:06:55] How did they die out? They took that
[1:06:58] message and they denominated around it
[1:07:01] and they called themselves Lutheran and
[1:07:04] they denominated around it. Amen. And as
[1:07:07] soon as they denominated it, it
[1:07:10] died. But it didn't matter because the
[1:07:12] life had already moved on. Same light.
[1:07:16] Amen. It was there for a purpose. Same
[1:07:19] light. But as it denominated, it died.
[1:07:24] But it didn't matter because the life
[1:07:25] had already moved on. And as the next
[1:07:28] one came
[1:07:30] along, God took out by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:33] those that were his. Amen. What was
[1:07:36] left? They denominated. I believe they
[1:07:39] called themselves Methodists, right?
[1:07:42] Sanctification. They called themselves
[1:07:44] Methodist. And And those back in that
[1:07:47] day, Amen. My my wife's family were
[1:07:50] Methodists. But back in that day, those
[1:07:53] were holiness people. Methodists were
[1:07:56] holiness people. They believed in
[1:07:58] sanctification. They believed in in
[1:08:00] living right and dressing right. The
[1:08:02] women had dresses, long hair. They were
[1:08:04] they were they were godly men and women.
[1:08:07] But as they denominated it, how did they
[1:08:11] denominate? By hybriding it with man's
[1:08:13] word, right? As it hybrided and
[1:08:15] denominated, it died. Right? But it
[1:08:18] didn't matter because the life had
[1:08:20] already moved on. God took out of that
[1:08:23] life. He took bride. Remember this is
[1:08:26] the subtopic. The bride. He took bride
[1:08:29] out of that age and that that was left
[1:08:32] denominated and died.
[1:08:35] Amen. Amen. But again, it didn't matter
[1:08:37] because God had taken his bride out of
[1:08:39] that age and the life had moved on. When
[1:08:42] the life moved on, it went into the
[1:08:45] tsel. Exact same thing happened. The
[1:08:47] spirit of God fell down on the people
[1:08:49] and the moving of the Holy Spirit and
[1:08:51] the restoration of the gifts Isuza
[1:08:53] Street and begin people began to uh
[1:08:57] speak in tongues and uh exercise the
[1:08:59] gifts of the spirit because the spirit
[1:09:02] was moving among them. Amen. Amen. But
[1:09:05] it was the same life didn't matter
[1:09:07] because gifts and callings over without
[1:09:08] repentance. But the life uh the light of
[1:09:12] the life, the Holy Spirit continued to
[1:09:15] move through and pull out those people.
[1:09:18] Amen. And what did he do? He found a
[1:09:20] William Brandham that had the light that
[1:09:24] you looked at Martin Luther or John
[1:09:27] Wesley that came into this prophet for
[1:09:29] this last day. No longer a reformer.
[1:09:32] Brother Brandham, brother William
[1:09:33] Brandham was not a reformer. He was a
[1:09:36] prophet. Amen. He was a word prophet.
[1:09:40] Yes. A vindicated word prophet. And when
[1:09:44] that light came into that day, you can
[1:09:48] say even at his birth, the light came in
[1:09:51] through the shutter into the room and
[1:09:53] stood over the bed.
[1:09:55] Praise the Lord. Amen. Because it was
[1:09:58] something different. A man that was to
[1:10:00] come forth to bring forth a message to a
[1:10:04] people. Now, what happened to the rest
[1:10:06] of Pentecost? God's pulling pulled out
[1:10:10] and is still pulling out. I believe it
[1:10:13] may be one here and one there. Uh if
[1:10:16] that because it's it we we're brother
[1:10:19] said 60 years ago, we're now in the
[1:10:22] gleaning stage, right? And gleaning is
[1:10:24] just going through after the harvest and
[1:10:26] picking out one here and one over here.
[1:10:28] And you you're gleaning, you're just
[1:10:30] picking up one here and there. That's
[1:10:32] all gleaning is. That was 60 years ago.
[1:10:35] So what what are we at now? I know in
[1:10:38] God's time 60 years isn't a long time.
[1:10:40] We look here on this earth and think 60
[1:10:42] years. That's been a that's been quite a
[1:10:44] quite a few years. And if it was
[1:10:46] gleaning then what is it doing now?
[1:10:48] Right? If there's one here or there, but
[1:10:49] God's still picking them out. So what
[1:10:51] happened to the rest? They denominated
[1:10:54] themselves to call themselves
[1:10:56] Pentecostal. And then of course you had
[1:10:58] offshoots of Pentecost like the what we
[1:11:01] call charismatics and uh the the
[1:11:05] evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[1:11:06] tongues and things and you had all these
[1:11:08] little offshoots but the same spirit.
[1:11:11] Amen. Same spirit. Same spirit. This
[1:11:14] message brother Am said this message
[1:11:16] will not denominate because there won't
[1:11:18] be another age. Amen. There's no dying
[1:11:20] off. But what it did is that spirit of
[1:11:23] denomination came in among the people.
[1:11:26] Right? And the people have denominated
[1:11:28] themselves by a denominational spirit.
[1:11:31] Amen. The word did not denominate
[1:11:34] because we're in the purity of the of
[1:11:36] the mature word for this day because
[1:11:39] it's bringing the bride to that place of
[1:11:41] maturity. So it cannot denominate. But
[1:11:44] the spirit of denomination has come into
[1:11:46] this message to do the exact same thing.
[1:11:48] So what happened to Pentecost? Amen.
[1:11:51] What happened to the shuck? Well, when
[1:11:53] the wheat come forth and reached to its
[1:11:55] place of maturity, the shook had to die
[1:11:57] off. You think the the bride has come to
[1:12:00] its place of maturity? I guarantee it
[1:12:01] has. Brother Bram said it has. And he's
[1:12:05] been gone 60 years. He said that 60 plus
[1:12:08] years ago, right? So, if it had then,
[1:12:11] what is it now? Right. Amen. That the
[1:12:14] shuck had to pull away. What happens to
[1:12:15] the shuck? Well, the the the the blade
[1:12:18] is dead. The life left it. It went into
[1:12:21] went kept going on into the stalk. What
[1:12:23] happened to the stalk? Stalk died. Says
[1:12:25] the life left it went on into the toss.
[1:12:27] What happened to the tossel? Then the
[1:12:29] shuck when the light the actual grain
[1:12:31] light that it was to protect came to
[1:12:33] maturity and came forth out the shuck
[1:12:35] pulled away and died and blown away. So
[1:12:40] what happens now? The seed gets taken to
[1:12:42] the garment. The rest of it gets burned.
[1:12:44] Amen. Because it died. Denomination. It
[1:12:47] just died. Look what brother Ram said
[1:12:48] here.
[1:12:50] Uh, I read part of this last week. I
[1:12:52] didn't get to finish it though because I
[1:12:54] was unfortunately I was feeling rushed
[1:12:58] for some
[1:13:00] reason. I don't like that feeling. Amen.
[1:13:03] But and and it is kind of a lengthy
[1:13:05] quote, but it is from God and mystery of
[1:13:06] God revealed. Christ and mystery of God
[1:13:08] revealed. Amen.
[1:13:10] Now, the big fancy intellectual
[1:13:12] denominations are doing the very same
[1:13:14] thing. Gathering themselves together to
[1:13:16] do the same thing. See, they are
[1:13:17] gathering and denominating themselves,
[1:13:20] each one trying to beat the other one.
[1:13:22] Now, notice that was the first thing
[1:13:25] that caused this in the beginning. Let's
[1:13:27] just read that first. Let me come back
[1:13:29] to that quote. Let's go over to
[1:13:31] Revelation and read chapter two. Uh
[1:13:34] starting with chapter 2, we'll get into
[1:13:36] the fourth church age and the
[1:13:38] proclamation. Now, remember, uh the
[1:13:41] first church left its first love and so
[1:13:44] forth. uh the next church became bitter
[1:13:47] because after you lose your love you
[1:13:49] become
[1:13:50] bitter. I if if you if you if you lose
[1:13:54] your affection for something all that's
[1:13:56] left there is hatred bitterness. So the
[1:13:59] first one left is love. Second one
[1:14:01] became bitter. Third one actually
[1:14:02] denominated. Amen. The 320 AD the
[1:14:06] Pergamist churches went 320 AD and when
[1:14:08] Nia Rome they formed the Catholic church
[1:14:12] in 320 AD. Now, but look when we go to
[1:14:14] the next church age and the and the
[1:14:17] introduction of the dark
[1:14:19] ages and what what God explains to them
[1:14:23] in chapter 2, Revelation 2:21,
[1:14:28] God said, "Now, and I gave her space to
[1:14:31] repent of her fornication, and she
[1:14:34] repented not." Now, who does she
[1:14:37] fornicate
[1:14:38] with? Who did this church fornicate
[1:14:41] with? Because notice the bride come out
[1:14:44] and the church died out. Amen.
[1:14:47] Spiritually, you still have Lutheran
[1:14:49] churches. You still have Methodist
[1:14:50] churches. You still have Pentecostal
[1:14:52] churches. You still have But the spirit
[1:14:54] the you might as well write about over
[1:14:56] the door because God's not there
[1:14:57] anymore, right? The spirit's gone. So if
[1:14:59] the spirit's gone, it's dead. Amen. I
[1:15:02] gave her space to repent for uh repent
[1:15:04] of her fornication and she repented
[1:15:08] not. Uh, we'll get into that in just a
[1:15:11] second. Again, behold, I will cast her
[1:15:14] into a bed, and them that commit
[1:15:16] adultery with her into great
[1:15:18] tribulation, except they repent of their
[1:15:21] deeds. Amen. Denomination.
[1:15:25] Look, this fits perfect. Revelation 17,
[1:15:29] by the way. And I will kill her
[1:15:32] children. Now, this woman has children.
[1:15:34] What are those children? Those are the
[1:15:36] denominations, the offshoots that came
[1:15:38] off the Catholic Church. Catholic church
[1:15:41] formed in Pergamus 3:20. Now in thyara,
[1:15:45] the next one, the dying out of the
[1:15:47] church ages. Amen. The church age dark
[1:15:50] ages uh uh taking control. And as you
[1:15:54] got that now, you had denominations
[1:15:57] that's becoming more and more prevalent,
[1:15:59] right? And the Catholic Church is that
[1:16:02] church that's the that that is the head.
[1:16:05] She's she's the the the
[1:16:08] the woman sitting on the hill. Amen.
[1:16:11] Sitting on the scarlet colored
[1:16:14] beast, but she has children because
[1:16:17] she's
[1:16:18] fornicated. Amen. She's fornicated,
[1:16:21] committ adultery, and she's had
[1:16:22] children. Well, these children are going
[1:16:24] to be illegitimate, right? Because they
[1:16:27] came from an illegitimate
[1:16:30] relationship. And what happens? I will
[1:16:32] kill her children. Those children are
[1:16:35] just those denominations that come out
[1:16:38] from her, right? Amen. Oh, they might
[1:16:40] call themselves Lutheran. They might
[1:16:42] call themselves Methodists. They might
[1:16:43] call themselves Pentecostals, but they
[1:16:45] just came out of the same spirit. Same
[1:16:48] spirit. Amen. Might have been
[1:16:51] denominated off of what Luther preached
[1:16:53] or what Wesley preached or what happened
[1:16:55] in the Zuza street, but it's the same
[1:16:57] spirit. Denomination spirit. They might
[1:17:00] call themselves message people, but it's
[1:17:02] the same spirit, right? Amen. And that
[1:17:05] spirit will kill you. But what did Jesus
[1:17:08] say now? I will kill her
[1:17:12] children, the same ones that come out of
[1:17:14] Mahore with death, and all the churches
[1:17:18] shall know that I am he which
[1:17:21] searches the reigns and hearts. And I
[1:17:24] will give unto every one of you
[1:17:25] according to your works. I
[1:17:28] see we know Revelation 17,
[1:17:34] Babylon, Revelation. And there came one
[1:17:36] of the seven angels which said which had
[1:17:38] the seven vows talked with me, saying
[1:17:40] unto me, come hither, I will show unto
[1:17:42] thee the judgment of the great
[1:17:44] that setth upon many waters. It's the
[1:17:46] same woman. Amen. It's the same woman we
[1:17:50] just talked about. To whom with whom the
[1:17:52] kings of the earth have committed what?
[1:17:56] Fornication. Praise the Lord. And the
[1:17:58] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[1:18:01] drunk with the wine of her fornication.
[1:18:04] They're
[1:18:06] intoxicated. Her her beauty, her
[1:18:09] splendor have intoxicated these people.
[1:18:13] Amen. They still do. It still does. and
[1:18:16] talk to even with everything that's gone
[1:18:18] on and and and and all the horrible
[1:18:22] things that's happened through the name
[1:18:23] of the church, the Catholic church
[1:18:25] priests and and all and molestation and
[1:18:28] all the horrible things. They're still
[1:18:31] the people that look and they're still
[1:18:33] drunk. Even after all that, they're
[1:18:36] still drunken with that stimulation,
[1:18:38] with that wine. What is it? It's an
[1:18:42] impersonation of the Holy Ghost. It's a
[1:18:45] replacement of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:18:48] Amen.
[1:18:51] It's funny.
[1:18:53] last last not this past week but the
[1:18:56] week before when we were off our manager
[1:19:00] went to uh a a class or a place we're
[1:19:03] buying some new equipment and they're
[1:19:06] having a meeting and talking about all
[1:19:08] this stuff and and he was saying telling
[1:19:10] us last week that the that where they
[1:19:13] had the meeting was in an old
[1:19:15] seminary and uh he looked at me
[1:19:19] specifically I was
[1:19:21] Okay. He said, "And they and they had uh
[1:19:25] all kinds of alcohol." I said, "Oh, so
[1:19:28] it's still a
[1:19:29] seminary." I'm sure they got what I was
[1:19:32] saying, but Oh, it's still a
[1:19:34] seminary. Still liquored up, still still
[1:19:37] drunk. Amen. This is a spiritual
[1:19:40] drunkness, but it's an imperson. It's
[1:19:42] the devil impersonating the Holy Gh the
[1:19:44] Holy Ghost with his artificial
[1:19:48] stimulant of fornication. See, people
[1:19:51] think that that that that's the way to
[1:19:53] live. Amen. The temporary uh
[1:19:57] satisfaction, but it's not. The only the
[1:20:00] only true stimulation that that will
[1:20:03] sustain you is that that the Holy Ghost
[1:20:05] gives. Amen. That's the only stimula of
[1:20:08] the wine of the of Holy Spirit. The
[1:20:10] stimulation that comes off of uh off of
[1:20:13] the Holy Spirit. They impersonate the
[1:20:16] devil's impersonating. So he carried me
[1:20:19] away in the spirit of the wilderness.
[1:20:20] And I saw a woman set upon a scarlet
[1:20:22] colored beast full of seven uh full of
[1:20:24] seh names of blasphemy. Names plural not
[1:20:29] just Catholic but names
[1:20:32] many names. Amen. of blasphemous names
[1:20:35] as brother Random called them, names of
[1:20:37] blasphemy, having seven heads, 10 horns,
[1:20:40] and the woman was arrayed on uh in
[1:20:42] purple and scarlet color decked with
[1:20:44] gold and precious stones, pearls, having
[1:20:46] a golden cup in her hand, full of the
[1:20:48] abominations and filthiness of her
[1:20:51] fornication. And upon her forehead was
[1:20:54] the name written, Mystery, Mystery,
[1:20:57] Babylon the Great, the mother. Amen.
[1:21:00] Now, the other didn't proclaim her as
[1:21:02] mother, but it did say that her children
[1:21:05] would be killed, right? I will kill her
[1:21:10] children. Well, if she has children,
[1:21:12] that means she's a mother, right? Well,
[1:21:14] here the proclamation on the forehead,
[1:21:17] the the of this church, this
[1:21:19] organization is
[1:21:22] mystery. Babylon the great, the mother
[1:21:24] of harlots and abominations of the
[1:21:27] earth. Praise the Lord. Same church,
[1:21:31] same
[1:21:33] organization, the same ones that that
[1:21:37] Luther came out of and those bride in
[1:21:40] those day in that day believed that word
[1:21:42] and that magnet pulled them out. The
[1:21:44] Holy Spirit, the rest stood there,
[1:21:46] stayed there, denominated it. They are
[1:21:48] gathering now back to this quote. They
[1:21:50] are gathering and denominating
[1:21:52] themselves. Each one trying to beat the
[1:21:54] other one. And now they got so much
[1:21:57] splendor they don't know what to do to
[1:21:59] but to unite with the Catholic church.
[1:22:01] You've seen this churches all over the
[1:22:05] country. Big huge church. I I took a
[1:22:07] picture of this church that was in
[1:22:09] Minneapolis. Uh and it it struck me. It
[1:22:13] wasn't a huge church, but it was a
[1:22:15] church that had the the top of the
[1:22:17] church was a perfect pyramid windows
[1:22:20] around it. I thought, "Wow, that that
[1:22:22] could be a message church."
[1:22:24] Wink wink. Um, wasn't it was a it was a
[1:22:29] Presbyterian Church of the Way was what
[1:22:32] the name of it was called. Presbyterian
[1:22:35] Church of the Way. Uh, but but we did go
[1:22:39] to another one. This church actually uh
[1:22:42] Doug lives here in town on our team. He
[1:22:45] sought I mean you you could have taken
[1:22:49] the super Walmart
[1:22:51] uh that it was that big. Uh that that
[1:22:57] one church I don't know what they call
[1:22:58] it. Uh actually their church is the old
[1:23:03] Houston Astradome.
[1:23:06] That church takes the whole stadium up.
[1:23:10] so much
[1:23:11] splendor that they don't know what to do
[1:23:14] but to unite with the Catholic Church.
[1:23:17] See Lucifer again building a bigger
[1:23:19] kingdom to push out people that don't
[1:23:20] believe in denominations and even take
[1:23:23] their church buildings like this little
[1:23:26] humble place we have
[1:23:29] take these buildings and make them
[1:23:31] storooms and the pastors of such has no
[1:23:33] rights at all and the man that is God-
[1:23:36] sent man would never stand a
[1:23:38] denomination after hearing or seeing
[1:23:39] that if he's had enough to go through to
[1:23:42] look at it I don't say that critically I
[1:23:44] say that truthfully
[1:23:46] Notice in this last days, Lucifer is
[1:23:48] doing Lucifer is doing the same thing.
[1:23:51] He says, "Can you see it?" The devil
[1:23:53] doing the same thing. Building up a
[1:23:55] hybrid church, a hybrid by hybrid
[1:23:58] members. Hybrid hybrid. Amen. Which
[1:24:02] brings denomination. H. Anything that's
[1:24:05] hybrid is dead. Cannot reproduce. Right?
[1:24:09] Hybrid. Hybrid. But what? Look.
[1:24:12] hybrid uh by knowledge instead of the
[1:24:17] word. They hybrid by man's knowledge,
[1:24:20] not the word. They take the word and
[1:24:23] hybrid off of it with man's
[1:24:26] knowledge. By the intellectual men
[1:24:28] instead of bornagain men building an
[1:24:31] intellectual kingdom that will outshine
[1:24:33] Christ's little bitty flock. What is it
[1:24:36] that did that? Fallen angels.
[1:24:40] Fallen angels. We talked about this last
[1:24:41] week. The Bible said it was fallen
[1:24:43] angels who listened to Lucifer instead
[1:24:46] of Christ. Revelation
[1:24:48] 12. Who who they once belonged to. Is
[1:24:51] that right? Now listen close. Fallen
[1:24:53] angels. What kind of angels?
[1:24:56] Luther, Wesley,
[1:24:59] Pentecostals, right? Lutheran,
[1:25:03] Methodists, Pentecostal. You can go down
[1:25:06] the line. What happens to
[1:25:08] them? We just read in revelation that
[1:25:11] they will be
[1:25:13] killed. Amen.
[1:25:16] Not a physical killing but spiritually.
[1:25:20] Again, Kabad written over the door. The
[1:25:22] spirit has departed from this place.
[1:25:26] That's what they have to look forward
[1:25:28] to. Luther Wesley Pentecost who kept not
[1:25:33] their first estate like the angels did.
[1:25:35] Why? Because the magnet came through and
[1:25:37] pulled up all that was his.
[1:25:39] All that was his came out of that. All
[1:25:42] that was left was
[1:25:44] denominated. And as fell into
[1:25:46] denomination like Lucifer's main hold at
[1:25:48] NASA 320 AD. And what did they do?
[1:25:52] Organized a great ecumenical association
[1:25:55] of ministers to make an image unto the
[1:25:57] beast. The ecumenical council is the
[1:26:00] image unto the beast. We know who the
[1:26:02] image is. Who the beast is? Yes. We know
[1:26:04] what the office is of the beast. Like
[1:26:07] we've said before, I don't believe the
[1:26:10] man that calls himself Pope Francis now
[1:26:12] is the beast. But that office that he uh
[1:26:16] that he is in is the office of the
[1:26:18] beast. And anyone that's in that office
[1:26:20] fulfills that place. Amen. Amen. So he
[1:26:26] himself might not be, but that office is
[1:26:29] that he's that he is fulfilling.
[1:26:32] What does that make him? Well, that
[1:26:34] makes him the same thing it makes us on
[1:26:36] the other side. We're fulfilling the
[1:26:39] purpose God put us here for. What does
[1:26:41] that make
[1:26:43] us? Praise the Lord.
[1:26:47] Amen. Well, if he's fulfilling that
[1:26:49] purpose, what does that make him?
[1:26:52] See that beast that that woman is
[1:26:56] writing, that church, scarlet colored
[1:26:58] beast,
[1:26:59] ni organized ecumenical association
[1:27:03] ministers. Now they've got an image to
[1:27:05] the beast, an ecumenical
[1:27:07] council. As the Bible said, in building
[1:27:10] a Christian economy that'll close the
[1:27:11] doors of this church and others like it.
[1:27:14] I'm trying to bring you the three-fold
[1:27:16] revelation. God is the mystery. What did
[1:27:18] they do? Sold out to reasonings of
[1:27:21] wisdom and education like Eve did.
[1:27:24] Fallen angels did. Wesley was a man of
[1:27:27] God. But what followed him? Fallen
[1:27:29] angels, right?
[1:27:32] They denominated it. When they
[1:27:34] denominated it, it died. Amen. Fallen
[1:27:37] angels and organizations for men of God
[1:27:39] who's went forth to establish truths in
[1:27:42] the earth before the truth could go on
[1:27:44] and proclamate and get onto the real
[1:27:47] revelation of Christ. Fallen angels come
[1:27:49] in and took over the denominations and
[1:27:52] ma or excuse me took over and made
[1:27:54] denominations out of it. That's the
[1:27:56] reason, brother Bram said, that's the
[1:27:59] reason the revelation of the seven seal
[1:28:01] mystery had to be unfolded. Amen. The
[1:28:04] reason, what did it do? It exposed the
[1:28:07] enemy. Yes. Down to the church age. It
[1:28:10] exposed the enemy in every age. What he
[1:28:13] is, who he is, what his tactic is, where
[1:28:16] he's come from, where he's going to,
[1:28:17] every bit of it exposed him. Amen. And
[1:28:20] he's all been exposed today. the
[1:28:22] revelation, the seven seals that brought
[1:28:24] this into light. Amen. That that light
[1:28:27] now the life has gone on. The life went
[1:28:30] through the justification. The life went
[1:28:32] through the sanctification. The life
[1:28:34] went through the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:35] Ghost into the Holy Ghost or the person
[1:28:38] of Jesus Christ himself.
[1:28:41] Amen. Look at what brother Ram said
[1:28:46] here. Now notice here. The life that was
[1:28:48] in the husk, the stalk, the tsel, all
[1:28:53] gathers into the
[1:28:54] seed. The others were just carriers
[1:28:57] getting to the seed. And the life that
[1:29:00] was in the stalk went one went to make
[1:29:03] the other. Justification made a way for
[1:29:06] sanctification. Sanctification made a
[1:29:08] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:09] This is this real close now.
[1:29:12] Amen. You got justification,
[1:29:15] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:29:16] Ghost to what?
[1:29:18] Amen. Christ himself. Amen.
[1:29:22] Justification made a way for
[1:29:24] sanctification. Sanctification made a
[1:29:26] way for baptism of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:29:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:29:32] the Holy Ghost itself to come down in
[1:29:37] you.
[1:29:39] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:42] Imperfection. back to the word seed
[1:29:47] again to manifest itself again. Praise
[1:29:51] the Lord. The same
[1:29:54] life come in
[1:29:56] you. The through the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:59] Ghost came the Holy Ghost came the
[1:30:01] person of Christ himself to live in you.
[1:30:05] Praise the Lord. The three step just
[1:30:07] brought you to him.
[1:30:10] It's him is the one that makes the
[1:30:11] difference. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:14] Remember, a baptism is nothing but an
[1:30:17] immersion. Amen. I got immersed when I
[1:30:20] was in the Baptist church and father,
[1:30:22] son, holy ghost because that's the way
[1:30:24] they believe you are to be baptized. I
[1:30:26] was immersed in water. But was I
[1:30:29] baptized with the Holy
[1:30:32] Ghost? Was I filled with the Holy Ghost?
[1:30:34] I mean, I was only eight. So, but was I
[1:30:39] filled with the Holy Ghost? because I
[1:30:41] wasn't
[1:30:43] baptized. You're not you're not even
[1:30:45] baptized if you if they said titles over
[1:30:47] you. That's not even a baptism, right?
[1:30:50] You understand? That's the difference.
[1:30:52] When the life comes, a baptism is just
[1:30:54] an immersion. Praise the Lord. It's just
[1:30:57] a pouring over. But when the person of
[1:31:00] Christ comes in, then you've got that's
[1:31:02] a new birth. Amen. Amen. I'm sorry. And
[1:31:06] I I know this may sound controversial,
[1:31:08] but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not
[1:31:11] the new birth.
[1:31:13] It makes it makes way. I've got the
[1:31:15] quote if you want to read it if
[1:31:17] anybody's watching. The masterpiece, the
[1:31:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes a way
[1:31:22] makes the way for the person of Christ
[1:31:25] to come live in you. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:31:28] the new birth. When Christ comes into
[1:31:30] you, that's the new birth. Praise the
[1:31:33] Lord. through Christ himself coming in
[1:31:36] you. Let me read this too before I move
[1:31:39] on. Now you can be
[1:31:41] justified without being
[1:31:43] sanctified. We've talked about this many
[1:31:45] times. You can be sanctified without
[1:31:48] having the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is
[1:31:51] the indwelling presence of Christ power
[1:31:55] in spirit form. Amen. Now we see that
[1:31:58] the natural types of spiritual. So the
[1:32:01] church, getting back to what we said a
[1:32:03] few minutes ago, the church, which I
[1:32:06] believe he means the bride, is in its
[1:32:09] complete
[1:32:11] maturity
[1:32:13] now. 1963, January
[1:32:17] 1963, I believe. So the church is in its
[1:32:22] complete
[1:32:24] maturity now. That's 62 years ago.
[1:32:29] Praise the Lord. If he said it then,
[1:32:31] where is the bride at now? Right? Where
[1:32:34] does she stand now? Justification,
[1:32:36] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:32:37] Ghost. We just come through. See, talk
[1:32:39] about the church ages at that point when
[1:32:42] he was coming through, which we've
[1:32:43] talked about. Is that spirit that life?
[1:32:46] Amen. It made way for the spirit
[1:32:48] himself. Now the bride has come to its
[1:32:52] complete state of maturity because God
[1:32:55] put in put into that n man that was born
[1:32:59] William Mary and Brandham to become the
[1:33:02] prophet of this age to bring this word
[1:33:04] and now this bride has this word that
[1:33:06] brings her into that pl that place of
[1:33:08] complete maturity. Amen. The magnet has
[1:33:11] come over, the Holy Spirit, and pulled
[1:33:13] his bride out of this church, out of
[1:33:15] this world. And he has brought her into
[1:33:17] a different age in this age, in this
[1:33:19] time of the last age, cuz remember that
[1:33:23] that's left goes on into
[1:33:25] apostasy. Amen. I've got the quote here.
[1:33:27] I don't know if I get running out of
[1:33:29] time if I'll get to the time to read it
[1:33:31] to you, but this this these
[1:33:33] ages the the ages the light goes up to
[1:33:38] God. That blackness of these ages goes
[1:33:41] off into predition, apostasy. The church
[1:33:44] ages keeps on
[1:33:46] going right right on into apostasy. But
[1:33:49] the bride goes up. Amen. Praise the
[1:33:52] Lord. But the bride through all these
[1:33:54] ages, she goes up because she's a part
[1:33:57] of
[1:33:58] him. Praise the Lord. Let me read this
[1:34:01] before I uh before I run out of time
[1:34:04] because I I want to finish this today.
[1:34:07] Re uh excuse me, Hebrews chapter
[1:34:13] 11. Amen. If anybody wants, if I don't
[1:34:16] get to read, if you want to see these,
[1:34:19] you let me know.
[1:34:22] I can I can get them to you. Brother Ram
[1:34:25] talks about the bride is a literal word
[1:34:27] seed.
[1:34:29] Bride. Amen. She becomes the lineup. Uh
[1:34:32] the the preview of the bride. Uh brother
[1:34:36] Bham saw that bride in preview when she
[1:34:39] come through the second time. He saw of
[1:34:41] course the church was dancing to a rock
[1:34:43] and roll with a hypocritical paper over
[1:34:46] which I consider hypocrite. Um, it's not
[1:34:49] white or black. If it's not white or
[1:34:52] black, it's hypocrite. That to me that's
[1:34:54] like Leodysia
[1:34:56] of lukewarm. When you're lukewarm, he
[1:34:59] spits you out of mouth. Lukewarm is not
[1:35:01] hot or cold. Amen. Black gray is not
[1:35:04] black or white. It's it's it's a mix.
[1:35:07] It's a hypocrite. Amen. And they're
[1:35:09] covering themselves, dancing to rock and
[1:35:11] roll. Don't have anything covering their
[1:35:13] backsides. But when the bride comes
[1:35:15] through and he sees she's a beautiful
[1:35:17] dress, long hair, beautiful bride coming
[1:35:19] through. Amen. She's stepping and
[1:35:22] marching to the step of that of the
[1:35:25] forgot what the song was. He said, if
[1:35:28] anybody
[1:35:29] remembers anyway, oh Christian soldiers
[1:35:32] or something like that marching. Amen.
[1:35:35] Perfectly in step, right, perfectly in
[1:35:37] line with that word until they got right
[1:35:40] to the end and a couple started getting
[1:35:42] out of step. Brother Ram come to himself
[1:35:44] screaming, "Get back in line. Get back
[1:35:46] in step." Right? Because a little bit
[1:35:48] there at the end, but she was so so
[1:35:50] perfect in line. Amen. Dressed and and
[1:35:54] when that message comes through, that
[1:35:56] that bride that's pulled out by that
[1:35:58] magnet, she lines right up with it.
[1:36:00] Amen. That bride lines right up with it.
[1:36:04] But now she's come to that place that's
[1:36:06] uh that that's come to a place of full
[1:36:09] maturity. Amen. But now let let's go
[1:36:12] over I had to go to uh Hebrews chapter
[1:36:14] 11. We always talk about especially the
[1:36:17] first uh I don't know uh 9 10 11 chap
[1:36:20] verses of chapter 11. Let's go to the
[1:36:23] end of re of Matthew chapter Matthew
[1:36:26] Hebrews chapter
[1:36:32] 11 start with verse
[1:36:35] 31 or 32. And what shall I more say?
[1:36:39] Gone through the heroes of
[1:36:41] faith. For the time would fail me to
[1:36:45] tell of Gideon, and of Bareric, and of
[1:36:49] Samson, and of Jethany, of David, also
[1:36:54] in Samuel, and of the
[1:36:56] prophets, who through faith subdued
[1:36:59] kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
[1:37:01] obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
[1:37:04] lions, quenched the violence of
[1:37:06] fire, escaped the edge of the sword. out
[1:37:09] of weakness were made strong, waxed
[1:37:11] valiant in fight, turned to flight the
[1:37:14] armies of the
[1:37:15] aliens. Women received their dead,
[1:37:18] raised to life again, and others were
[1:37:20] tortured, not accepting deliverance,
[1:37:22] that they might obtain a better
[1:37:24] resurrection. And others had trials of
[1:37:27] cruel mockings and scorgings, yay,
[1:37:30] moreover, of bonds and imprisonments.
[1:37:33] Listen to this now. They were stoned.
[1:37:36] They were saw a
[1:37:38] sunder, were tempted, were slain with
[1:37:41] the sword. They wondered about in sheep
[1:37:42] skkins and goat skins, being destitute,
[1:37:45] afflicted, tormented, of whom the world
[1:37:48] was not even worthy. Amen. They wondered
[1:37:52] in deserts and mountains and dens and
[1:37:54] caves of the earth. And all these all
[1:37:57] these, having obtained a good report
[1:38:00] through
[1:38:01] faith, received not the promise.
[1:38:07] The blade did not receive the promise,
[1:38:10] right? The stalk did not receive the
[1:38:12] promise. The tsel did not receive the
[1:38:14] promise. The promise day is the seed
[1:38:17] day, right? That's our
[1:38:19] day. God fourth vers 40th verse. God
[1:38:23] having provided some better thing for us
[1:38:26] that they without us should not be made
[1:38:31] perfect. Amen. Praise the Lord. They
[1:38:35] without us should not be made perfect.
[1:38:39] And that's the same perfect that Jesus
[1:38:41] said Matthew 5:48
[1:38:43] mature to that place of
[1:38:46] maturity. Amen. So us them without us
[1:38:51] they cannot be made perfect. Why cannot
[1:38:54] be brought to that place of maturity?
[1:38:57] Because this is that day. This is that
[1:39:00] age. What did I just read to you?
[1:39:03] Brother Brandham said, "I believe that
[1:39:05] that bride has come to the place of full
[1:39:08] maturity now." Amen. Praise God. So,
[1:39:12] it's up to us, saints. We are the ones
[1:39:15] that are holding that that standard for
[1:39:18] this day. This is that last day. This is
[1:39:21] the culmination of it all. We read the
[1:39:23] beginning of it. We're in the middle of
[1:39:25] the end of it. And we're about to go
[1:39:27] home. It's about to be over. Yes.
[1:39:30] Brother Bam says it's about it. uniting
[1:39:32] time and sign. We find that now the
[1:39:34] times come when the trumpet sounds that
[1:39:37] those sleeping saints back there could
[1:39:39] not be made perfect without us. Right?
[1:39:43] They he says are depending on us.
[1:39:48] Praise the Lord. Because this is that
[1:39:50] day. This is that day of maturity. Yes.
[1:39:54] And when they come together, they unite.
[1:39:57] Praise the Lord. Oh,
[1:39:59] I'm just looking forward to that. so
[1:40:01] much, saints.
[1:40:03] Amen. I can't wait to see my family
[1:40:05] again. Amen. When they come together,
[1:40:07] they unite with the living ones. Yes.
[1:40:11] Glory to God. The church uniting with
[1:40:13] the word. Then the church and the word
[1:40:15] unite together, becoming one. One.
[1:40:19] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. The dead
[1:40:21] saints with the living saints uniting
[1:40:23] together to be one. And all together
[1:40:25] will unite with Christ yonder for that
[1:40:27] wedding supper of the lamb. Amen.
[1:40:29] Hallelujah. Oh saints, what day are we
[1:40:32] living? What time? What time is it?
[1:40:36] Amen. Not by your watch. What time is it
[1:40:39] in the spiritual world? What time is it
[1:40:41] that God has uh ordained that we're
[1:40:43] living in right now? We're all a part of
[1:40:46] this. We look and as we see this is the
[1:40:49] gracious part of it. We look out when we
[1:40:51] leave this place. We go out in the world
[1:40:52] and we see the the horrible part of it,
[1:40:56] the the worst part of it. Now we're in
[1:40:58] the middle of this truth. Now in the
[1:41:01] spiritual part of it, we say we're about
[1:41:03] it's it's going home time. Yes. Amen.
[1:41:06] It's going home time. I I sometimes
[1:41:09] wonder even if we're even gleaning
[1:41:11] anymore. Is gleaning even over because
[1:41:13] you know there will be a time when it
[1:41:15] is. Brother V said there will be a time
[1:41:18] when the door is shut and nobody can get
[1:41:20] in and nobody can get out. That's right.
[1:41:23] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God help
[1:41:26] us. I I trust it's not now. Amen. I
[1:41:29] believe it's a brother Random preach
[1:41:30] souls in prison. You want to you want to
[1:41:32] listen to a sobering message souls that
[1:41:34] are in prison now. Amen. I believe
[1:41:38] brother Random got ahead of himself a
[1:41:39] little bit but I felt that I believe
[1:41:41] that spirit was stirring it stirring in
[1:41:43] him to preach that and to bring it to us
[1:41:46] to recognize the day that we're living
[1:41:48] now. Amen. Amen. And that that will be
[1:41:51] that will be you think about these
[1:41:53] people that that were that were such
[1:41:56] godly people. Amen. That were sauna son.
[1:42:00] They they they they accepted Christ so
[1:42:02] much. They were willing to be scorched
[1:42:04] and beat. Sauna sunder, tortured,
[1:42:07] tormented, slain with a sword, watch
[1:42:09] their kids ripped apart by uh elephants
[1:42:13] and uh uh uh let them loose for the
[1:42:17] lions to come and just eat them. and uh
[1:42:19] push them off of cliffs onto spikes and
[1:42:22] stakes and cut them open and pour honey
[1:42:25] on their their inrils and let the bees
[1:42:27] come and just eat them. It just it was
[1:42:29] horrible the things that they went
[1:42:31] through. They
[1:42:33] obtained they obtained a good report by
[1:42:36] the faith they held. But even that could
[1:42:40] not reach the place that we're at today.
[1:42:42] Right? Amen.
[1:42:45] Oh God, help us to be able to fulfill
[1:42:47] that purpose that God has put us here
[1:42:48] for. This is it. Amen. This is the end.
[1:42:52] This is this is this is the finalization
[1:42:54] of it. Amen. I got a couple other things
[1:42:57] here, but I'm going to close on that.
[1:42:59] Amen. I have couple other quotes that I
[1:43:01] wanted to read to you, but recognize now
[1:43:05] the maturity this bride has come to this
[1:43:08] place. It's all a part of of our
[1:43:11] placement. It's all a part of our
[1:43:13] adoption. It's all It's all a part of
[1:43:15] knowing who we are. Amen. And who we are
[1:43:18] in Christ and what he has done for us.
[1:43:21] Amen. It's that life. It's moved on now.
[1:43:24] And it's in the bride. What's happened
[1:43:27] to the rest is denominated. It's died
[1:43:30] off. Amen. It's only the bride is where
[1:43:34] the life of Christ is. Amen. When the
[1:43:37] bride leaves this place, saints,
[1:43:39] there'll be nothing. And I was going to
[1:43:40] read Revelation 4 and talking about
[1:43:42] those anointings of uh the lion
[1:43:45] anointing and the ox calf anointing, the
[1:43:47] man anointing, the the flying eagle
[1:43:50] anointing of each of those ages that
[1:43:52] come through and the anointings that
[1:43:54] those people had to keep them and and to
[1:43:56] encourage them to keep that spirit on
[1:43:58] them. But friend, when this bride leaves
[1:44:01] and the spirit of God goes, there is no
[1:44:04] anointing in the tribulation period.
[1:44:07] There will be no godly anointing at all.
[1:44:10] Amen. The thing to help those people
[1:44:13] through won't be there at that time.
[1:44:16] Yes. People will have to seal their
[1:44:19] testimony with their own blood. It's
[1:44:20] going to be a horrible time. Blood to
[1:44:22] the horse's bridal. But praise the Lord.
[1:44:26] Amen. We will not be here for that.
[1:44:29] We will not be here for that. So there's
[1:44:32] nothing to worry about, nothing to fret
[1:44:34] over. All of it's going to happen. But
[1:44:36] the bride she will have gone home. Amen.
[1:44:39] So shall she so shall she ever be with
[1:44:42] the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:44:45] stand if we could.
[1:44:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm so thankful,
[1:44:54] saints. God sent a prophet in this last
[1:44:56] day. Amen. I'm so thankful that word
[1:44:59] come to her, spoke to her, help her see
[1:45:03] who she is. Standing in that word,
[1:45:07] standing on that promise, that truth,
[1:45:09] recognizing the day and the hour that we
[1:45:12] live, saints, it all brings us to the
[1:45:14] point to understand who we are. Amen.
[1:45:16] This adoption should help us, everyone,
[1:45:19] come to the place, if we haven't
[1:45:21] already, even more, God, help me, to the
[1:45:24] place of who we are in
[1:45:27] him. Because it's rapture
[1:45:29] time. Amen. It's rapture time. It's time
[1:45:33] for our loved ones to begin to appear.
[1:45:35] It's time for those that have gone on
[1:45:37] before to begin to appear before us.
[1:45:41] Amen. I've got several gone on and I'm
[1:45:44] looking forward to that time myself.
[1:45:46] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. I got to be
[1:45:50] honest, I I really I really am looking
[1:45:55] forward to that time when our our son
[1:45:59] comes and is united with Micah and
[1:46:02] Tabitha and even her children and Joel.
[1:46:08] Amen. It just takes me beyond myself to
[1:46:11] think
[1:46:12] about. But it's going to be a wonderful
[1:46:14] time, saints. Amen. It's going to be a
[1:46:17] wonderful time. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:46:21] Amen. Amen. Let's sing this again. I'm
[1:46:24] so glad I'm a part of the family of God.
[1:46:28] Hallelujah. We're all family. Amen.
[1:46:31] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:46:33] I'm so
[1:46:35] glad I'm a part of the family of
[1:46:41] God. I've been washed in the
[1:46:46] fountain. Cleansed by his
[1:46:51] blood. Joy dares with
[1:46:54] Jesus as we travel this song. Oh, I'm a
[1:47:01] part of the
[1:47:04] family. The family of God. Yes. I'm so
[1:47:10] glad I'm a
[1:47:12] part of the family of
[1:47:17] God. I've been
[1:47:19] washed in the
[1:47:22] fountain, cleansed by his blood.
[1:47:27] joy days with Jesus as we
[1:47:32] travel this song. Oh, I'm a part of the
[1:47:39] family. The family. One more time now.
[1:47:44] Yes, I'm so
[1:47:46] glad I'm a part of the family of God.
[1:47:53] I've been washed in the
[1:47:58] fountain. Cleansed by his
[1:48:02] blood.
[1:48:04] Joiners with
[1:48:06] Jesus as we travel this song. For I'm a
[1:48:13] part of the
[1:48:15] family, the
[1:48:17] family of
[1:48:21] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you,
[1:48:25] Jesus. Oh, praise the Lord. Saints,
[1:48:28] aren't you glad there was something God
[1:48:30] put in you when that magnet came over
[1:48:34] the deep call to the deep that there was
[1:48:36] something in you to respond? Yes. Praise
[1:48:39] the Lord. I'm so thankful when that deep
[1:48:42] call, there was a deep there to respond.
[1:48:45] Amen. When it responded, it responded
[1:48:48] into eternity. that eternity responded
[1:48:52] back and made us who we are today, born
[1:48:56] again sons and daughters of God. Yes.
[1:48:59] Praise the Lord Jesus. You know, baptism
[1:49:02] is an important
[1:49:05] thing, being baptized in front of people
[1:49:08] by Christian baptism in the name of the
[1:49:10] Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Bam said
[1:49:13] that's an outward expression that you
[1:49:15] show the world that you've accepted
[1:49:17] Christ as your savior. Not a son, not a
[1:49:20] father or holy ghost, but the Lord Jesus
[1:49:24] Christ.
[1:49:26] You've identified yourself with him.
[1:49:29] Amen. But what Christ does then is he
[1:49:34] identifies with you by putting his own
[1:49:37] life in you. Praise the Lord Jesus. And
[1:49:40] that's the more important part. The deep
[1:49:43] might respond, but that that deep's got
[1:49:45] to respond back. Amen. Amen. That deep
[1:49:48] responds back. And Christ comes and
[1:49:50] lives in you. Oh, it makes you a whole
[1:49:52] new creature. Yes. Praise the Lord
[1:49:54] Jesus. Everything is new. Everything is
[1:49:58] new. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[1:50:00] today. Pray something was said to bless
[1:50:02] and strengthen the Lord today. Amen. But
[1:50:05] stand true to that word. Hold fast to
[1:50:08] what the Lord has given, shown us. We
[1:50:10] stand upon that word in faith. Amen. So,
[1:50:14] God richly bless you today. Remember the
[1:50:16] prayer requests that we had. Amen. And
[1:50:18] keep those in in your heart as well. Um
[1:50:21] I do not know where I'm going next week.
[1:50:24] We have not been assigned for next week.
[1:50:26] I think uh the hot man is waiting to
[1:50:30] find out what this next team does in
[1:50:32] Minneapolis where we've been going. And
[1:50:35] if they get enough done, we won't go
[1:50:38] back there. They don't get enough done,
[1:50:40] we'll probably go back there and finish
[1:50:42] it. But I I doubt we're going to go back
[1:50:45] there. So bottom line is I don't know
[1:50:47] what we're doing next week. So I can't
[1:50:49] tell you for sure about uh service time
[1:50:52] is always 10:30 unless you're notified
[1:50:55] by me differently. Right. That's so but
[1:50:59] I'll have to notify you uh during the
[1:51:02] week. So uh when I find out so amen so
[1:51:06] sorry about that but uh I can only do
[1:51:09] what knowledge I have. So but uh Lord
[1:51:13] Richley bless you. Amen. And appreciate
[1:51:15] you. Keep Tommy in prayer too. Amen. Uh
[1:51:18] he's a fine young man and he he's just
[1:51:22] so sincere. Has such a good heart. But
[1:51:25] you know the devil's just going to try
[1:51:26] to do everything to tear the poor fell
[1:51:29] apart now. Uh but greater is he that's
[1:51:32] in us than he that's in the world. He
[1:51:34] can use your prayer. So please pray for
[1:51:36] him. All the other requests, like I
[1:51:38] said, god suggest you. We're going to
[1:51:40] believe that sister Julius is going to
[1:51:42] be perfect Thursday. Is going to be
[1:51:44] great backmen.
[1:51:47] as well. So, God richly bless you and
[1:51:51] we'll be dismissed in a word of prayer.
[1:51:54] Can't think of anything else. Something
[1:51:56] forgive me, but Lord richly bless you
[1:52:00] today. Does anyone else have anything
[1:52:02] before we go?
[1:52:07] He has testing. Oh, of course. Joel's
[1:52:10] got some testing. I don't I don't think
[1:52:13] he's so smart.
[1:52:16] He's so smart. The Lord's with him. He's
[1:52:18] smart, isn't he? Ruth is a smart young
[1:52:21] man. Yeah. So, yeah. So, but we will
[1:52:25] pray. We'll pray for Jo test to go well.
[1:52:28] So, God bless you. Brother Zach, would
[1:52:31] you just miss us?
[1:52:34] Dear Lord, we thank you for allowing us
[1:52:37] to gather together again to just hear
[1:52:40] from you and to just concentrate on you.
[1:52:44] Lord, we ask that you be with each one
[1:52:46] of us as we go our separate ways and
[1:52:48] watch over us and keep us in your word.
[1:52:50] And yes, Lord, just help us uh show your
[1:52:53] love to the world around us, to our
[1:52:55] neighbors, and to, you know, everyone
[1:52:58] that we come in contact. Amen. Yes,
[1:53:00] Lord. just be with all the requests that
[1:53:02] came in and touch those who need a touch
[1:53:04] from you and comfort those who need
[1:53:07] comforting and give guidance to those
[1:53:08] who need guidance. Thank you Jesus. We
[1:53:10] ask these things in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:53:13] Eight.
