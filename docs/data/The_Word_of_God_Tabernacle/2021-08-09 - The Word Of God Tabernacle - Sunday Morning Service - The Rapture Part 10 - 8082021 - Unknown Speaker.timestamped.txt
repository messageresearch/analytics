[46:14] are
[46:15] uh
[46:17] they fit themselves their lives their
[46:20] spirits you know our spirits dictate to
[46:22] our bodies as to how we live
[46:24] what we think that's right how we form
[46:26] our opinions
[46:28] and i look today and i see especially a
[46:30] lot of times college age and and younger
[46:33] and and how
[46:35] they're being molded shaped and
[46:37] and and i look at
[46:39] some of the attitudes and
[46:41] the dress and the
[46:43] ways that they present themselves and i
[46:46] think why
[46:49] i know i'm an old foggy but i just don't
[46:51] understand why especially when i look at
[46:53] these beautiful young beautifully
[46:54] dressed and young people here
[46:58] thank god for godly parents but i think
[47:01] why and
[47:03] and the lord was like they can only do
[47:05] it can only live by what they
[47:08] are
[47:09] you know i've told you many times about
[47:10] revelation
[47:12] uh or revelation becomes a part of who
[47:14] you are
[47:15] you can only live it because that's who
[47:17] you are
[47:18] you live that life because that's
[47:19] because that's who you are and the lord
[47:20] shall be they live that because that's
[47:22] what they are yeah it's sort of like
[47:24] i've told you several times that
[47:27] people go to church and they go to
[47:30] you know a church has a trinitarian
[47:31] minister they believe in three gods they
[47:34] said well he never preaches on it but
[47:36] everything
[47:37] that filters through that man's thought
[47:40] process
[47:41] and and uh interpretation and knowledge
[47:45] of the scripture is going to filter
[47:47] through that filter of of three gods
[47:50] that's right no my and everything that
[47:52] he does and everything that he says and
[47:54] everything he preaches is going to be
[47:56] influenced by that thought process
[47:58] that's right
[47:59] it's just like baptism you believe in
[48:01] baptism and
[48:04] in
[48:04] the name of the lord jesus christ or our
[48:07] uh
[48:08] uh father son holy ghost
[48:11] you know it's going to be it's going to
[48:13] be influenced by that
[48:15] uh
[48:16] i you know i've had people and i've
[48:18] talked to people uh go to
[48:21] places that that i know believe certain
[48:23] doctrinal things and i just tell them
[48:25] you know
[48:26] you're welcome to go as you feel led but
[48:28] just be careful
[48:30] because of someone so in such and such
[48:31] oh well they never preach on it doesn't
[48:34] matter
[48:36] everything that that person thinks and
[48:39] is filtered through with the scripture
[48:40] and all is going to be influenced by
[48:43] that thought because that's what they
[48:45] are
[48:46] that's what they believe
[48:48] and i thought
[48:50] they call us crazy because
[48:54] we conform to a way of life
[48:57] we
[48:58] were transformed by the renewing of our
[49:00] mind to a life to a lifestyle
[49:04] we dress a certain way we act a certain
[49:06] way we talk a certain way
[49:10] we don't go to certain places and
[49:13] go to church and we live we try to live
[49:15] a godly life we try to let the lord be
[49:18] glorified in our lives
[49:21] and other people in the world will tell
[49:23] you oh you're just bound
[49:25] you're just uh you're just a prisoner
[49:28] we're free
[49:30] and you go and you look in the world
[49:32] and i look at them because it was funny
[49:35] i was out down here studying yesterday
[49:37] and i saw a couple coming in and out of
[49:39] the tattoo parlor over here and i
[49:41] thought
[49:42] that's probably not even the right way
[49:43] to say that anymore i don't know uh
[49:46] that's what it was when i was growing up
[49:47] hard
[49:48] tattoo parlor i don't know what it is
[49:50] joint i don't know i pray and praying
[49:52] them away anyway unless the lord hasn't
[49:54] there for a purpose we're supposed to
[49:55] witness to them i don't want to run them
[49:57] away if they're supposed to be here and
[49:59] there's some
[50:00] spiritual significance otherwise but i
[50:02] looked and i thought wow every one of
[50:04] them looks the same and then it clicked
[50:06] well of course they all look the same
[50:08] they
[50:10] they say things about us conforming to
[50:12] the way we live but every one of them
[50:14] looks the same too
[50:16] you look out in the world tell me if i'm
[50:19] not right look out in the world and you
[50:20] see every they're they're they all look
[50:22] the same
[50:24] they're all wearing the same type of
[50:25] clothes and stripping down to nothing
[50:27] and and they're projecting their image
[50:30] because that's who they are right they
[50:32] they say we all look alike well they all
[50:35] look alike but they don't want to see
[50:37] that they don't want to admit that or
[50:39] recognize it
[50:40] but i'm thankful that uh that the holy
[50:43] spirit does have a way of uh speaking to
[50:47] his people to his children to to live
[50:50] that way to be that way
[50:52] to project themselves that way they're
[50:54] doing theirs and we do ours yeah but
[50:57] that's it again it's just a matter of
[50:59] who you are
[51:01] what you believe
[51:03] what's deep in your soul
[51:05] because that comes out that's what's
[51:07] going to that free will in your soul is
[51:09] what's going to uh
[51:10] manifest itself through your flesh
[51:13] through the spirit into through the
[51:15] flesh and it's going to magnif uh
[51:17] manifest itself that way it does in them
[51:20] it will in us amen it just depends on
[51:23] who you are what do you believe what is
[51:25] really truly deep in your heart because
[51:27] that's what's going to come out
[51:30] that eventually what's really deep down
[51:32] in your soul is what's going to come out
[51:35] i mean i've seen people
[51:37] uh come go to church for 20 years you
[51:40] think mine there's a soldier if they're
[51:42] gonna anybody make it there and then all
[51:43] of a sudden your next thing you know
[51:45] they're gone slidden and went away
[51:47] and and maybe they come back i'm afraid
[51:50] that they do but you know uh
[51:53] but then you think
[51:54] what's really down in there is gonna
[51:57] come out
[51:58] eventually it's gonna come out so
[52:01] uh a person can only live what they are
[52:04] thank god i'm a child of god amen i can
[52:06] only live the life of a child of god a
[52:08] born-again holy ghost-filled child of
[52:10] god because that's what i am that's all
[52:11] i can live and if it doesn't please
[52:13] anybody else i'm sorry but as long as
[52:15] i'm pleasing to him that's what matters
[52:18] brother man said i'd rather god take me
[52:19] by the hand than a man to pat me on the
[52:21] back yes amen so i'm so thankful god
[52:24] bless you appreciate you being here as
[52:27] uh i usually make the announcements at
[52:29] the end i don't want to forget this
[52:30] [Music]

[53:19] and being a part of the funeral brother
[53:21] david wanted me to be a part of the
[53:23] funeral

[53:33] appreciate your prayers appreciate for

[53:44] prayers for that and your thoughts and
[53:46] just remember that again i'll keep you
[53:48] up to date if there's anything you need

[54:22] heart and as the spirit moves it and
[54:24] puts it in the right position and place

[55:34] amen so
[55:36] thankful to the lord for that first
[55:37] thessalonians chapter 4 now verse 13
[55:40] before we read though let's just bow our
[55:41] heads for word of prayer
[55:44] precious jesus we're so thankful again
[55:46] father of your grace and mercy and love
[55:48] to us

[55:51] so sweet it's so good
[55:52] we thank you so much for it father if
[55:54] anyone it's just hard to believe that
[55:56] anyone can even come close to
[55:58] experiencing that spirit lord that would
[56:00] turn their backs on it but it's so great
[56:02] to know you lord it's so great to lord
[56:05] experience your presence and
[56:08] to know you in the power and
[56:09] manifestation of that spirit lord and

[56:51] we do and say and be pleased with this
[56:53] service god we rebuke every demonic
[56:56] spirit that would try to hurt hinder or
[56:58] infiltrate this service in any way that

[57:06] father as you receive it unto yourself
[57:09] as a praise from our lips god as a
[57:11] praise from our heart as it would mold
[57:14] us and shape us in even our minds god to
[57:17] speak before your throne powerful
[57:19] supernatural things yes we thank you god
[57:22] for this word thank you for this message
[57:24] lord in the revelation of that word to
[57:26] our heart god may you bring it real to
[57:28] us once again and show us where we need
[57:30] to be in you father and see these road
[57:32] signs along the road and help us to
[57:34] understand and see the day in the hour
[57:37] that we're living we committed to you
[57:39] now lord and and ask your blessings upon
[57:42] it once again for your glory and honor
[57:43] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[57:45] pray amen amen first thessalonians 4
[57:49] verse 13
[57:51] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[57:53] brother concerning them which are asleep
[57:55] that you saw or not even as others which
[57:57] have no hope for if we believe that
[58:00] jesus died and rose again even so them
[58:02] also which sleep in jesus will god bring
[58:05] with him
[58:06] for this we say unto you by the word of
[58:08] the lord that that we which are alive
[58:10] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[58:12] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[58:14] for the lord himself shall descend from
[58:16] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[58:18] the archangel with the trump of god and
[58:20] the dead in christ shall rise first
[58:22] then we which are alive and remain shall
[58:25] be caught up together and uh with them
[58:27] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[58:28] air and so shall we ever be with the
[58:30] lord wherefore comfort one another with
[58:33] these words
[58:34] amen you could be seated if you'd like
[58:37] and then again as i said this is the
[58:39] rapture part 10.
[58:41] um i thought i've been further along
[58:44] with this by now but it seems like each
[58:46] part of this uh takes a little more
[58:48] depth than i had anticipated or expected
[58:50] and as you know a
[58:52] more of an inspiration preacher than a
[58:54] no preacher uh some people may have four
[58:57] or five ten eight pages of notes and
[58:59] this is the notes i got for this morning
[59:01] as you can see so i don't i don't
[59:04] normally write a lot down just a little
[59:06] bit but i'm just depending on the lord
[59:07] and whatever he would speak but uh we we
[59:11] morphed now last week from
[59:13] uh again
[59:15] this is still falls under the signs of
[59:17] the time and and the the resulting
[59:20] condition of what we are seeing in the
[59:22] world today as a rapturing time as a
[59:25] rapturing season because we know
[59:27] scripturally the prescription is there
[59:29] to help us understand and know that
[59:31] there's going to be a specific condition
[59:33] of the world that's going to help us
[59:35] understand the day that we live and
[59:37] where we're expecting the rapture to
[59:39] take place uh it was the same thing in
[59:41] every age it was the same thing with
[59:43] moses it was the same thing with noah
[59:45] you know obviously noah had never
[59:47] reigned before
[59:49] but there had to be a condition that
[59:51] made itself known to bring it to that
[59:53] time where god wanted him to build an
[59:55] ark now it took 120 years to build the
[59:57] ark but when the ark was complete they
[1:00:00] knew that that was the time right now it
[1:00:02] didn't happen right that second of
[1:00:04] course it happened a few days later but
[1:00:07] it happened and that's what matters but
[1:00:10] see so we see that in the scripture
[1:00:12] there's that that that resulting
[1:00:14] scriptural condition of the way the
[1:00:17] world and the church is supposed to be
[1:00:19] in at the time of rapture catching away
[1:00:22] last week we spoke more
[1:00:24] more specifically about lawlessness and
[1:00:27] the lawlessness of the world the
[1:00:29] lawlessness condition that takes place
[1:00:31] not only physically as we see around our
[1:00:33] country in the world but spiritually the
[1:00:36] spiritual lawlessness that's going on
[1:00:38] today but today i want to talk about
[1:00:41] and and go into a position of the
[1:00:44] darkness that's covered the earth today
[1:00:46] the darkness so um i wasn't going to
[1:00:49] read this i was just going to quote it
[1:00:50] but for some reason i was here yesterday
[1:00:52] i felt to read it so i'm going to isaiah
[1:00:54] chapter 60. we've read this couple of
[1:00:56] verses many times actually took a script
[1:00:59] a
[1:01:00] message or two on it but about the
[1:01:02] darkness the darkness that's covering
[1:01:04] the earth today
[1:01:05] amen the darkness
[1:01:07] uh i started reading in some of the
[1:01:09] scriptures that i felt the lord put on
[1:01:10] my heart to bring for you
[1:01:13] a few weeks ago or whatever time that it
[1:01:16] may manifest itself and
[1:01:18] uh and as i was reading them and going
[1:01:20] through them i thought my that that's
[1:01:22] that that's the that is the preeminent
[1:01:24] condition of the world when the rapture
[1:01:27] takes place is the darkness
[1:01:30] it's going to be such a darkness
[1:01:32] physically emotionally mentally
[1:01:36] spiritually it's going to be a dark
[1:01:38] place amen and we see here isaiah 61 60
[1:01:43] and 1 says arise shine for thy light is
[1:01:45] come thank god for that the glory of the
[1:01:48] lord is risen upon me
[1:01:50] the you us the bride for behold the
[1:01:53] darkness the
[1:01:55] notice that specific v darkness not just
[1:01:58] a darkness but the darkness amen
[1:02:01] uh there are plenty of gods but there's
[1:02:04] only one the goth amen amen there's
[1:02:07] plenty of there's plenty of evil but
[1:02:09] there's only one thing darkness amen
[1:02:11] that's that's the devil that's satan for
[1:02:13] behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:02:16] earth and gross darkness the people but
[1:02:20] the lord shall arise upon thee and his
[1:02:22] glory shall be seen upon thee so we know
[1:02:24] that that scripturally is going to be a
[1:02:27] condition that we look for at this last
[1:02:29] day of a gross darkness that's covering
[1:02:32] the people and that would obviously of
[1:02:35] course the gross darkness without light
[1:02:38] will bring uh demon will bring demonic
[1:02:41] spirits and and the acting upon those
[1:02:44] spirits which obviously brings the
[1:02:46] lawlessness amen
[1:02:48] because it's a resulting effect of the
[1:02:51] darkness that we live in this is a dark
[1:02:53] dreary world people say can't you print
[1:02:56] something a little more uplifting friend
[1:02:58] this title is the rapture and i can't
[1:03:02] think of anything more uplifting than
[1:03:05] knowing that we're going in a rapture
[1:03:08] that we're going to receive a body
[1:03:10] change and we're going to leave this
[1:03:12] earth
[1:03:13] but we have to understand what the
[1:03:16] condition of the world is going to be at
[1:03:18] the time that takes place
[1:03:21] that season is now
[1:03:23] amen that's the time season that we live
[1:03:25] now we finished with this scripture so
[1:03:28] i'm going to go back to it because uh
[1:03:30] we didn't finish this scripture i
[1:03:32] finished up last week sermon with this
[1:03:34] scripture so let's go back to 2
[1:03:36] thessalonians chapter 2
[1:03:39] because i want to start back there and
[1:03:41] finish through the thought that we had
[1:03:43] started at the end of last the service
[1:03:45] last week
[1:03:51] 2 thessalonians chapter 2
[1:03:55] verse 1.
[1:03:57] now we beseech you brethren by the
[1:03:59] coming of our lord jesus christ and by
[1:04:01] unto him that ye be not soon shaken
[1:04:04] in mind or be troubled neither by spirit
[1:04:06] nor by word nor by letter as from us
[1:04:09] as that the day of christ is at hand
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:15] and we believe that now amen
[1:04:18] let no man deceive you by any means
[1:04:20] remember we read it jesus said that
[1:04:22] matthew 24. one of the first things that
[1:04:24] was the first thing when they asked him
[1:04:26] that threefold question remember we read
[1:04:27] the scripture last week that three-fold
[1:04:29] question but for anybody that didn't
[1:04:31] listen or weren't here
[1:04:32] um
[1:04:33] that three-fold question they asked
[1:04:35] matthew 24
[1:04:36] jesus the first thing he told them was
[1:04:39] make sure that you're not deceived now
[1:04:41] what is the number one way that you will
[1:04:44] not be deceived what is a sure fire you
[1:04:47] know for a fact that you cannot be
[1:04:51] deceived
[1:04:52] you must be born again
[1:04:55] you must have the holy ghost
[1:04:57] anyone that is not born again said well
[1:04:59] i have the anointing that's fine and
[1:05:01] good for him but you can be very much
[1:05:03] deceived
[1:05:04] even by that anointing you can be
[1:05:05] deceived but if you're born again and
[1:05:08] christ lives in you you cannot be
[1:05:10] deceived because you've become the word
[1:05:12] amen amen
[1:05:14] so let no so now paul picks it up here
[1:05:17] to the uh
[1:05:18] thessalonians now let no man deceive you
[1:05:20] by any means for that day shall not come
[1:05:24] except there come a falling away first
[1:05:26] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:05:29] of perdition now jesus answers several
[1:05:32] parts to that in matthew 24
[1:05:35] when paul just hits on two specific
[1:05:37] things
[1:05:38] jesus talks about the wars the rumors of
[1:05:41] wars he talks about the pestilence and
[1:05:43] everything that's going to happen paul
[1:05:45] narrows down to two specific things when
[1:05:48] we talk about the day of christ being at
[1:05:50] hand let no man deceive you
[1:05:54] for that day shall not come except there
[1:05:56] come a falling away
[1:05:59] and the man of sin to be revealed
[1:06:02] amen to be revealed so when was this
[1:06:05] great falling away to take place
[1:06:09] at this last day
[1:06:10] when was this man of sin to be revealed
[1:06:14] that we read about in isaiah 14 when was
[1:06:16] this man of sin revelation 12 going to
[1:06:19] be revealed
[1:06:21] in the last day
[1:06:23] amen so it all follows through those are
[1:06:26] the two specific points that paul brings
[1:06:28] to point out to us that are that if you
[1:06:31] want to call them signs signposts that
[1:06:34] we look to that we recognize we are at
[1:06:37] this time
[1:06:39] okay
[1:06:41] who opposeth now this son of perdition
[1:06:44] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[1:06:46] that is called god again isaiah 14 or
[1:06:49] that is worshiped
[1:06:52] worshipped satan worship
[1:06:55] amen doesn't again it does not have to
[1:06:57] be headless chickens pentagrams and
[1:07:00] upside down crosses to worship satan
[1:07:03] people worship satan all the time every
[1:07:06] day
[1:07:07] and don't even know it yes right
[1:07:11] now
[1:07:13] i'm not being judgmental
[1:07:18] and i'm not going to put a number on it
[1:07:20] but i i promise you by the word and by
[1:07:23] the message
[1:07:24] there's been multiple churches just this
[1:07:27] morning worshipping satan yes yeah
[1:07:30] they don't even know it right they're
[1:07:32] worshiping the devil correct
[1:07:36] you imagine the kind of
[1:07:38] things that's in churches that's allowed
[1:07:40] in churches
[1:07:41] let's just start with the music
[1:07:44] when was it when did it ever become
[1:07:47] allowable to come into the house of god
[1:07:50] rock and roll music that's right or jazz
[1:07:53] rock and roll or whatever it is blues i
[1:07:56] don't know that's all of the world but
[1:07:58] when did it ever become correct and
[1:08:00] proper to have it in a church
[1:08:04] that stuff's only proper in one place
[1:08:07] and that's satan's eden
[1:08:09] which we're called out of yes amen we're
[1:08:12] not a part of them
[1:08:13] when did it ever become fashionable in
[1:08:15] church they said oh you got to listen to
[1:08:17] the words i can't hear the words for the
[1:08:20] demonic beat that's going on behind it
[1:08:25] i've looked at some songs that
[1:08:27] me and brother david one time went to it
[1:08:29] just because we kind of had the same
[1:08:30] thought process on that we went to
[1:08:32] barnes noble one time and was looking up
[1:08:34] some of these songs that people just
[1:08:36] sing in church and worship at and you
[1:08:38] know what the genre
[1:08:40] several of them not all of them but
[1:08:42] several of these
[1:08:45] newer songs
[1:08:48] actually was listed at the barnes and
[1:08:50] noble in their catalog as the genre of
[1:08:53] rock and roll
[1:08:55] that's the genre that they listed under
[1:08:58] and people sing it in churches
[1:09:01] worshiping god
[1:09:03] i think when was that ever allowed
[1:09:07] oh well but it has such a powerful
[1:09:09] message no it has a powerful backbeat
[1:09:12] which is the driving force behind rock
[1:09:15] and roll
[1:09:17] the backbeat is the driving force behind
[1:09:20] rock and roll yes and people
[1:09:23] do it all the time yeah churches around
[1:09:26] i'm sorry friend i've been in message
[1:09:28] churches i wished i was not there yeah
[1:09:31] i've been in nash's churches where
[1:09:34] i felt like and i used to go to rock
[1:09:36] concerts when i was a kid so i know what
[1:09:39] i'm talking about i felt like i was in a
[1:09:42] miniature concert
[1:09:47] i just don't understand it
[1:09:49] but it's that darkness that's right amen
[1:09:52] it's that darkness it's the subtleness
[1:09:54] of the devil
[1:09:55] that son of perdition that man of sin is
[1:09:58] to be revealed in this last day but he
[1:10:01] is being worshipped in a wholesale
[1:10:04] worship throughout this world and in
[1:10:06] many many churches and they don't even
[1:10:09] realize him
[1:10:10] that's right
[1:10:11] i'll read you this quote again what
[1:10:13] brother branham said
[1:10:15] in august of 1965
[1:10:18] god of this evil age the god of this
[1:10:21] evil age
[1:10:22] now how beautiful the scripture tied
[1:10:24] themselves together in every age notice
[1:10:26] now when the church world would not have
[1:10:29] the word of god to rule over them they
[1:10:32] accepted a murderer barabbas
[1:10:34] what did this do
[1:10:36] it exalted satan
[1:10:39] who did it the religious leaders
[1:10:43] you say wait a minute it was the
[1:10:45] religious leaders that rejected the word
[1:10:47] of god by accepting a barabbas
[1:10:49] absolutely
[1:10:51] it was the religious leaders that was
[1:10:53] screaming the loudest crucify him
[1:10:57] let his blood be on us and our children
[1:11:00] that was the priests yeah
[1:11:02] they had just left the temple at uh for
[1:11:06] service and they come out screaming to
[1:11:08] kill this innocent man and they accepted
[1:11:10] a barabbas in his place
[1:11:13] he said well that was the jews same
[1:11:15] thing happens today
[1:11:17] because it's the same devil
[1:11:19] same devil there same devil here so it's
[1:11:22] still the same thing not jews now but
[1:11:24] gentiles what have they done they
[1:11:26] accepted a barabbas and exalted satan
[1:11:30] he is the god of this evil age to the
[1:11:33] place that he always wanted to be
[1:11:36] now listen for satan is not spoken of as
[1:11:39] god of any other age but this age
[1:11:43] say to the god of this age yes amen
[1:11:47] i know that
[1:11:49] the kids that go to school and
[1:11:51] have jobs now be careful saints yes
[1:11:54] amen be careful that that devil's out
[1:11:56] there to wrangle you up yes
[1:11:59] he's he's a good wrangler he's a good
[1:12:01] he's a good ropist he can sling that
[1:12:03] rope from a long distance and he can
[1:12:05] have you hooked before you know what's
[1:12:06] going on but that's the devil out there
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] his playground he makes it look all
[1:12:12] appealing and
[1:12:14] and lovely but his his end result is
[1:12:17] death for you
[1:12:18] yes
[1:12:20] he wasn't spoken of the god of the age
[1:12:22] noah wasn't spoken of the god of age of
[1:12:25] moses the god of a lie of the age of
[1:12:27] elijah but this evil age he said oh
[1:12:30] don't miss this
[1:12:33] he is the god of this evil age worshiped
[1:12:36] by millions and billions of people and
[1:12:39] they don't know it that's right
[1:12:41] worship
[1:12:42] by millions and billions of people and
[1:12:46] they don't even know it
[1:12:48] and the population when brother branham
[1:12:50] was here 1965 is it near what it is
[1:12:53] today
[1:12:54] correct
[1:12:55] but he still said billions
[1:12:58] billions worship him indeed don't even
[1:12:59] know it but let the scripture uncover
[1:13:02] him this morning and let's see and then
[1:13:04] you'll know yes
[1:13:06] let's do that
[1:13:08] let's take this scripture and let's rip
[1:13:10] the veil off of that devil
[1:13:12] yes that's exposing so he will have a
[1:13:14] room to hide yes
[1:13:16] amen
[1:13:18] he's the god
[1:13:20] look now fourth verse we're back ii
[1:13:23] thessalonians two fourth first who
[1:13:25] opposes and exalted himself above all
[1:13:27] that is called god
[1:13:28] for or that is worship so that he as god
[1:13:33] he satan as god sitteth in church
[1:13:39] he sinneth in the temple of god
[1:13:43] showing himself that he is what he is
[1:13:46] god right remember god's just not to
[1:13:49] worship right amen god's an object to
[1:13:51] worship and he is the god of this world
[1:13:54] worshiped by millions and billions of
[1:13:57] people
[1:13:59] though hid
[1:14:00] from ages and generations remember the
[1:14:02] darkness now that's our theme
[1:14:05] was to bring
[1:14:06] an unveiling
[1:14:08] through satan's eden
[1:14:11] satan
[1:14:12] showing himself that he is god and he is
[1:14:15] friend he is the god of this world we
[1:14:17] might not like it i i mean trust me my
[1:14:20] spirit is cringing within me just to say
[1:14:23] the words that satan is that god of this
[1:14:24] age right yes i
[1:14:26] it it cringes me to say it but it's the
[1:14:29] truth yeah amen satan is the god of this
[1:14:32] age right satan is the god of most
[1:14:34] churches out there today who claim to
[1:14:36] worship jesus christ
[1:14:39] by
[1:14:40] my
[1:14:42] remember ye not listen now let's let's
[1:14:45] let's pull that veil off if it had it's
[1:14:47] already been pulled off let's let's work
[1:14:50] on him again today amen let's beat that
[1:14:52] devil into such a pulp he he wanted to
[1:14:54] get up off the floor for ten weeks amen
[1:14:58] remember ye not
[1:14:59] that when i was yet with you i told you
[1:15:02] these things
[1:15:03] and now ye know what withholdeth that he
[1:15:07] might be revealed in his time now who's
[1:15:10] holding it back
[1:15:12] who was reserving it
[1:15:14] who was holding it back
[1:15:17] so that it would be revealed in its time
[1:15:20] so remember no we know that there's a
[1:15:22] time and a place in the season for
[1:15:24] everything we go back to ephesians one
[1:15:27] at that at it's a point in time
[1:15:29] and it was an appointed time for the
[1:15:31] unveiling of this wicked one this evil
[1:15:35] one to be unveiled to be uh
[1:15:38] brought out into the light
[1:15:40] there was a time for it
[1:15:43] times went along daniel
[1:15:45] uh
[1:15:46] daniel
[1:15:48] you don't need to turn there
[1:15:50] but in daniel chapter 12 verse 4.
[1:15:54] let me see if i can find it read it to
[1:15:56] you real quick daniel chapter 12 verse 4
[1:15:58] way back to daniel
[1:16:01] god says but but thou o daniel shut up
[1:16:04] the words and seal the book even to the
[1:16:07] time of the end
[1:16:09] many shall run to and fro and
[1:16:11] acknowledge and knowledge shall be
[1:16:13] increased
[1:16:14] what did god tell daniel when daniel
[1:16:16] started getting a glimpse of it
[1:16:18] god told daniel seal it up
[1:16:21] it's not time for it daniel seal up the
[1:16:23] word seal of the book to the time of
[1:16:26] what
[1:16:27] the end
[1:16:29] right now yeah that was the time that
[1:16:31] that unveiling and that revealing of
[1:16:34] that that man of sin the son of
[1:16:36] perdition to be revealed
[1:16:38] to be made known i told you the other
[1:16:40] day
[1:16:41] the greatest thing that unveiled the
[1:16:43] devil was the seven seals
[1:16:46] when brother branham preached the truth
[1:16:48] and the revelation of those seals by the
[1:16:50] inspiration of an angel coming every day
[1:16:53] by uh by ministering it to him brought
[1:16:55] it to a people that unveiled who satan
[1:16:58] was writing all through these ages yes
[1:17:02] still doing it yeah still riding he's on
[1:17:04] that pale horse today riding through
[1:17:06] this age
[1:17:08] amen now
[1:17:09] this bride's been called out of this age
[1:17:11] we feel the influence of it but she's
[1:17:13] been called out but that revealing of
[1:17:15] that unveiling up till that time friend
[1:17:17] nobody even knew who that was
[1:17:20] people poked out and prayed at and
[1:17:22] thought but most people in the religious
[1:17:24] world thought that was the devil going
[1:17:26] down through revelation chapter six yes
[1:17:28] they thought that was the devil and the
[1:17:30] white oh this white horse has got to be
[1:17:32] or thought it was jesus i should say on
[1:17:34] the devil and thought it was jesus
[1:17:36] writing out to the church ages well he's
[1:17:39] on a white horse got to be jesus pure
[1:17:41] and righteous and you think oh yeah well
[1:17:42] that makes sense well that's what the
[1:17:44] natural mind thinks without revelation
[1:17:47] but when the revelation of the truth
[1:17:49] comes you recognize that was the
[1:17:51] hypocrisy of the devil himself veiling
[1:17:54] himself in purity holiness righteousness
[1:17:58] and in church
[1:18:00] yes the very seed of god
[1:18:03] in his own church
[1:18:04] that's the seed of satan doing the same
[1:18:07] thing today let's revelation chapter 10
[1:18:11] just real quick i'm not gonna
[1:18:13] uh have you turn there unless you want
[1:18:14] to revelation 10 4 look at this
[1:18:17] um
[1:18:18] well let's just start with verse one
[1:18:19] revelation 10 1. and i saw another
[1:18:21] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:18:23] clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon
[1:18:25] his head his face is at worth the sun
[1:18:27] his feet his pillars of fire
[1:18:29] he's had in his hand a little book open
[1:18:31] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[1:18:33] the left foot upon the earth he cried
[1:18:35] with the loud voices when aligned worth
[1:18:37] and when he had cried seven thunders
[1:18:39] under their voices
[1:18:40] and when the seven thunder said utter
[1:18:42] their voices i was about to write and i
[1:18:44] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[1:18:46] seal up those things
[1:18:49] so there was times that men of god got
[1:18:52] glimpses
[1:18:53] of what we had know today to be a
[1:18:56] revealed truth yeah the unveiling of
[1:18:59] satan
[1:19:00] the unveiling of the darkness the son of
[1:19:02] perdition can no longer hide behind his
[1:19:05] hypocrisy he has been made known amen
[1:19:09] now who has he made known to
[1:19:11] the bride yes the bride's going to be
[1:19:13] the only ones that's going to know that
[1:19:15] the rest of the world still lives in
[1:19:16] that veil
[1:19:18] they still live veiled from what the
[1:19:20] presence of that enemy is
[1:19:23] and they let them and they let that
[1:19:25] devil infiltrate every facet of their
[1:19:27] life every corner of their church every
[1:19:30] uh place in their home and families and
[1:19:32] they don't even realize it
[1:19:36] it's the devil yes
[1:19:38] he's been exposed oh there's been men
[1:19:40] yeah
[1:19:41] god said shut up those things which is
[1:19:43] seven thunders uttered and write them
[1:19:44] not why not why was john not permitted
[1:19:48] to write it because it wasn't time
[1:19:51] why was daniel not permitted to write
[1:19:53] what god was showing him because it was
[1:19:56] a time yeah when was that time
[1:20:01] ii thessalonians 2 6 and now we know
[1:20:04] what withholdeth
[1:20:06] that he might be revealed in his time
[1:20:08] god was withholding it
[1:20:11] god was keeping that from taking place
[1:20:14] god was holding that from being revealed
[1:20:16] because it needed to be revealed at a
[1:20:18] specific time
[1:20:20] and that specific time is a rapture time
[1:20:24] and when it's that time right now
[1:20:26] yes
[1:20:28] right now is that time amen praise the
[1:20:30] lord if you want in my opinion to know
[1:20:33] that unveiling
[1:20:35] that
[1:20:36] uncovering
[1:20:37] i believe it was the seals that really
[1:20:39] did it that that was out now obviously
[1:20:42] through the ages and of course brother
[1:20:44] branham did too but that was the nail in
[1:20:46] the coffin if you as they would say
[1:20:49] that that really exposed that devil that
[1:20:53] really brought to light that he was the
[1:20:55] god of this wicked age yes
[1:20:57] and that's why brother bannon preached
[1:20:59] god of this evil age and and other
[1:21:02] messages
[1:21:03] on top of that
[1:21:06] that he be revealed in his time amen
[1:21:10] thank god that is this time what time
[1:21:12] the end time what time rapture time
[1:21:15] he is to be revealed
[1:21:18] he has been for the mystery now what is
[1:21:21] a mystery a mystery is something in
[1:21:23] darkness
[1:21:25] a mystery is something that's hidden a
[1:21:28] mystery is something that has a veil on
[1:21:30] it
[1:21:30] you might know there's something in
[1:21:32] there but you don't know what
[1:21:34] and if you don't know what then it
[1:21:36] remains a mystery
[1:21:38] and if it's still a mystery then you
[1:21:40] can't see it because it's hid it's
[1:21:43] veiled
[1:21:44] so that mystery of iniquity that we were
[1:21:47] talking on last week
[1:21:49] does already work
[1:21:51] so if iniquity is working but it's a
[1:21:54] mystery of iniquity that means the
[1:21:56] iniquity is actually going forth and
[1:21:59] people don't realize it
[1:22:01] you understand
[1:22:02] the iniquity because it's still a
[1:22:04] mystery
[1:22:05] the mystery of iniquity is working its
[1:22:08] way in the world in our country in
[1:22:11] churches and it's a mystery so people
[1:22:13] don't even realize it right
[1:22:16] so it
[1:22:18] so you could have things go through the
[1:22:19] church you could have uh uh who wasn't
[1:22:23] uh
[1:22:25] martin luther smoked a pipe or something
[1:22:27] i forgot down through the age
[1:22:31] he was uh how how could i be and and and
[1:22:34] actually stayed he protested the
[1:22:36] catholic church but he stayed a catholic
[1:22:39] why how could that be
[1:22:40] because it was working its way up to
[1:22:42] this time that mystery of iniquity was
[1:22:45] still working
[1:22:48] no longer
[1:22:50] because it's not a mystery anymore
[1:22:52] it's um it's been unveiled
[1:22:55] to the to those who will know the truth
[1:22:57] to those who god has revealed the truth
[1:23:00] you say now wait a minute it's only for
[1:23:02] those who who actually god will reveal
[1:23:05] that truth too that that will come to
[1:23:06] understand that absolutely
[1:23:09] he said what about everybody else
[1:23:11] it's hint to them
[1:23:13] it's him to everybody else
[1:23:15] it's only going to be revealed to the
[1:23:16] bride yes that's the international bride
[1:23:19] it's not just me or you or this church
[1:23:21] it's the bride internationally it's
[1:23:23] going to be revealed to the bride
[1:23:24] internationally not just um
[1:23:27] um
[1:23:28] the the few here the city state it's
[1:23:30] going to be around the world yes and
[1:23:32] god's got that bride all the way down to
[1:23:34] the church age he said well how does god
[1:23:36] excuse that because the mystery was
[1:23:38] still it was still failed
[1:23:41] it wasn't made known to them they were
[1:23:43] responsible for what god brought them
[1:23:45] for their day
[1:23:47] and if they live to their message as
[1:23:49] brother adam said they will be there
[1:23:53] the mystery of iniquity does already
[1:23:56] work
[1:23:57] now he said this when he wrote this
[1:23:59] already work only he who now letteth
[1:24:02] will let
[1:24:03] uh
[1:24:05] god hindering who will hinder let it
[1:24:08] will hinder

[1:24:13] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[1:24:16] amen today
[1:24:18] that's when he's being revealed

[1:25:31] your own life amen in your own families

[1:25:38] been a church i know that's happened

[1:25:52] does amen
[1:25:54] if it destroys the enemy when god said
[1:25:57] he would destroy him then
[1:26:00] when that spirit that word comes out of
[1:26:02] his mouth what ha what does it produce
[1:26:05] when it comes out of your mouth yes
[1:26:08] you've got to understand that friend
[1:26:11] you got to realize who you are yeah this
[1:26:14] bride's not going anywhere till she

[1:26:45] it's got to be the purity of the
[1:26:47] revelation of the word
[1:26:48] you go back to isaiah 1 20
[1:26:51] and revelation 19 15
[1:26:54] specifically declares
[1:26:56] that spirit of his mouth being the word
[1:26:58] going forth to destroy and defeat the
[1:27:01] enemy
[1:27:02] when that word comes forth out of you
[1:27:04] friend it will defeat the enemy
[1:27:08] believe it
[1:27:09] by faith yes amen it will produce what
[1:27:12] it said it will yes
[1:27:14] he shall consume that
[1:27:16] spirit of wicked with the spirit of his
[1:27:18] mouth and shall destroy it with the
[1:27:21] brightness of his coming
[1:27:23] even him whose coming is after the
[1:27:25] working of satan with all power and
[1:27:27] silence and lying wonders
[1:27:29] and with all deceivableness of
[1:27:31] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:27:34] because they received not the love of
[1:27:37] the truth that they might be saved they
[1:27:40] love pleasure
[1:27:41] we read ii timothy
[1:27:43] 3 they love pleasure more than love god
[1:27:47] right but if they love god it produces
[1:27:50] what it said they received the love of
[1:27:52] the truth but those who reject or
[1:27:55] receive not the love of the truth are
[1:27:57] those that are deceived in
[1:27:59] unrighteousness
[1:28:01] it remains hid
[1:28:03] it remains a mystery to them
[1:28:08] and for this cause god shall send them
[1:28:10] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:28:13] a lie
[1:28:14] that they all might be damned who
[1:28:16] believe not the truth but have pleasure
[1:28:19] in unrighteousness
[1:28:20] they believe not the word they believe
[1:28:23] not the truth
[1:28:24] friend i'm sorry but it's it's a sad
[1:28:27] fact when god presents itself when the
[1:28:30] word presents itself and is flatly
[1:28:32] rejected there's nothing left but
[1:28:35] judgment right right
[1:28:37] nothing left but judgment
[1:28:39] and if you go on and read that beyond
[1:28:41] what we read last week in matthew 24 you
[1:28:44] see that jesus says now when the word is
[1:28:46] preached to all the nations all the
[1:28:49] world then the end will come yeah
[1:28:52] what does that mean that means that
[1:28:54] everybody will have the opportunity
[1:28:56] yes everybody will have had the chance
[1:28:59] to receive it
[1:29:00] you say but what about the little
[1:29:02] children well that's up to god
[1:29:04] that's up to whether the predestinated
[1:29:06] or not that's god's choice right amen so
[1:29:08] what they couldn't receive the truth
[1:29:10] they couldn't understand it no no but
[1:29:12] god knows who they are
[1:29:14] and remember all babies go to heaven
[1:29:16] anyway yeah amen so are they predestined
[1:29:18] or they're going to rapture don't know
[1:29:20] that
[1:29:21] right
[1:29:21] but they but all babies go to heaven
[1:29:23] yeah amen i know it's a horrible time
[1:29:26] when people talk about
[1:29:29] children dying and things like that and
[1:29:31] and it is yeah and and it cringes my
[1:29:33] heart especially when i got little
[1:29:35] grandchildren myself and i think about
[1:29:37] that a three-year-old seven-year-old and
[1:29:39] then he just pierces through my heart
[1:29:41] but i think well they're just laying in
[1:29:42] the arms of jesus now yeah so praise the
[1:29:45] lord they're gonna be there right amen
[1:29:47] it's a sad thing that they're gone from
[1:29:49] the earth for the parents and loved ones
[1:29:51] but they're laying in the arms of jesus
[1:29:54] to praise the lord that's where they are
[1:29:56] but now let's as we pull that that that
[1:29:59] veil off of the devil
[1:30:02] we realize that only those
[1:30:04] that reject the truth
[1:30:07] will god send strong delusion god will
[1:30:10] send them
[1:30:11] strong delusion that they would believe
[1:30:14] a lot
[1:30:16] what is that delusion
[1:30:20] strongest delusion i know of
[1:30:22] that a person could believe and be
[1:30:24] damned by it is that spirit that is so
[1:30:27] close that it would deceive the very
[1:30:29] elect if possible yes and that's a
[1:30:31] religious spirit yes that's not a spirit
[1:30:34] out here in the world it's not the
[1:30:35] spirit of government or medicine or
[1:30:38] or money it's a spirit it's a religious
[1:30:40] spirit like we talked about last week
[1:30:43] the mark of the beast friend the mark of
[1:30:45] the beast is not the vaccine and the
[1:30:48] people say coven vaccine is the mark of
[1:30:50] the beast oh come on really that's not
[1:30:54] the mark well they're pumping something
[1:30:55] in your arm i don't know what they're
[1:30:56] pumping in there i'm not concerned about
[1:30:58] it because god takes care of me
[1:31:01] but i can tell you by message of the
[1:31:03] hour it's not the mark of the beast
[1:31:05] right right
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:08] i mean it's okay i mean and people see
[1:31:10] that and if somebody doesn't know that's
[1:31:12] okay but it's not the mark of the beast
[1:31:15] right the mark of the feast is rejection
[1:31:17] of god's word exactly amen you reject
[1:31:20] god's word you are cursed with with with
[1:31:23] a lie that you'll believe that life and
[1:31:26] that lie is going to be so close it
[1:31:28] would deceive the very elected possible
[1:31:29] because it's a religious spirit yeah
[1:31:32] it's a religious spirit
[1:31:34] those are the things that god that
[1:31:35] delusion
[1:31:36] that delusion is not oh go to hinduism
[1:31:39] that illusion delusion is not oh go to
[1:31:41] buddhism that delusion is oh believe in
[1:31:44] the government or believe in the
[1:31:45] medicine or or hold up
[1:31:48] all your trust in your money and your
[1:31:50] riches and wealth no the delusion is
[1:31:53] that it's
[1:31:54] that it is godly
[1:31:56] the delusion is that it is spiritually
[1:31:58] correct that's the delusion
[1:32:01] and people believe that right
[1:32:04] and they bring the rock and roll into
[1:32:06] their churches
[1:32:08] and they're damned by it saints yes
[1:32:10] oh god if he hasn't been exposed today
[1:32:13] friend i don't know when he will
[1:32:15] but thank god for a messenger yeah a
[1:32:18] message
[1:32:19] that god could speak to and bring a
[1:32:21] message that we can see the truth of
[1:32:23] that word
[1:32:24] that he would unveil that devil no
[1:32:26] wonder he hated this message so much i
[1:32:29] wonder that's one of me and brother
[1:32:30] dennis's favorite quotes out of christ
[1:32:32] and mystery god revealed all hells
[1:32:34] against this message yes right we know
[1:32:37] why because it unveils him yes it
[1:32:40] exposes him it shows him for the demonic
[1:32:43] spirit the deceptive hypocritical spirit
[1:32:46] that he is yes amen is that the age
[1:32:49] we're living yes is that a rapture age
[1:32:52] do we see that in the scripture as a as
[1:32:54] a sign to us that we're here yeah oh

[1:34:38] know the the
[1:34:39] scripture declares it and i know that
[1:34:41] we're here now
[1:34:43] i know this is the condition i've never
[1:34:45] seen the condition more so than it is
[1:34:47] right now that's right
[1:34:49] i can remember things back years ago
[1:34:52] before the government got involved
[1:34:55] and i'll just say this before i'm not
[1:34:57] going to call his name but before a
[1:34:58] certain president was elected
[1:35:01] several years ago
[1:35:02] 12 years ago
[1:35:04] i guess i'm kind of naming him
[1:35:07] i i grew up in north carolina friend
[1:35:10] i grew up when
[1:35:13] my sister would have to come home
[1:35:14] because of the riots in middle school
[1:35:15] when they uh well it was junior high
[1:35:17] school then
[1:35:19] when they were integrating everybody
[1:35:21] and it was fights because each side
[1:35:23] hated each other and it was like that
[1:35:25] was the purpose they were trying they
[1:35:26] were trying to fuel this and all of a
[1:35:29] sudden humanity as it does found a way
[1:35:31] to exist
[1:35:33] humanity found a way to love and to
[1:35:35] coexist and to come together when i came
[1:35:37] up in school some of my best friends
[1:35:39] through my entire life no matter what
[1:35:41] school i went to what job i was at no
[1:35:43] matter where i was some of my best
[1:35:46] friends in life were black people yeah
[1:35:48] african-american whatever i don't want
[1:35:50] to be politically incorrect well you
[1:35:52] know me i don't care anything about
[1:35:53] being politically correct but
[1:35:55] they were black people
[1:35:57] i mean i love those people
[1:35:59] and and
[1:36:01] we
[1:36:04] it didn't matter if i was white and
[1:36:05] they're black didn't matter what color
[1:36:07] what nationality was where they lived or
[1:36:09] what
[1:36:10] their financial status was here's my
[1:36:12] buddy yeah that's all i cared about
[1:36:14] right yes but now all of a sudden again
[1:36:17] that whole thing's being stoked
[1:36:19] that that fire is being fueled
[1:36:22] and that hatred is being jinned up again
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:27] there's a spear behind it yes there's a
[1:36:29] spirit behind it let's go to ii
[1:36:31] corinthians so let me finish this
[1:36:34] second corinthians chapter four
[1:36:38] we'll start with verse one
[1:36:48] second corinthians chapter four verse
[1:36:50] one
[1:36:52] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:36:55] as we have received mercy we faint not
[1:36:59] but we have renounced the hidden things
[1:37:02] of dishonesty
[1:37:03] renounced put aside the hidden things
[1:37:07] now look at this this is what is hidden
[1:37:10] it's darkness something that's hidden in
[1:37:12] the dark
[1:37:13] it's it's veil it's a mystery
[1:37:16] we've renounced those hidden things of
[1:37:18] dishonesty that a lot of people do that
[1:37:21] they
[1:37:22] you know
[1:37:23] do was say well nobody's looking so i
[1:37:25] can do this that's that hidden thing of
[1:37:27] dishonesty right
[1:37:29] nobody realizes what's going on nobody
[1:37:31] can see me nobody's gonna know this has
[1:37:33] happened or that i've done this
[1:37:36] but
[1:37:37] paul is telling them that
[1:37:39] we have renounced that
[1:37:42] because there is an all-seeing eye
[1:37:44] there's a god that sees it all
[1:37:46] so even if nobody else around us sees it
[1:37:49] we know god sees it
[1:37:51] and we have renounced those hidden
[1:37:54] things the darkness isn't that just
[1:37:55] where the roaches like to hide in the
[1:37:57] darkness yeah
[1:37:58] rats and roaches
[1:38:00] bats they love the dark
[1:38:03] amen
[1:38:05] we don't love them i don't like roaches
[1:38:07] and rats in my house or bats flying
[1:38:09] around they do but i don't like them
[1:38:11] there but that's what they they they
[1:38:14] feast in that darkness they feast in
[1:38:16] that spirit
[1:38:18] you ever thought of it any greater than
[1:38:21] when i was out driving
[1:38:23] and and when i first started i would
[1:38:25] drive out later at night too sometimes
[1:38:27] till one and two o'clock in the morning
[1:38:29] i only did that once or twice i learned
[1:38:31] my lesson fast on that
[1:38:33] but as soon as it got dark man the
[1:38:35] roaches started crawling out everywhere
[1:38:37] the bats started flying around the rats
[1:38:40] started feasting off all the nests and
[1:38:42] i'm not talking about the rodents i'm
[1:38:43] talking about the people yeah
[1:38:46] that have those spirits right
[1:38:48] oh they're they're hid away on their
[1:38:50] couches and stuff until it's dark and
[1:38:52] when it's dark that's when it goes crazy
[1:38:55] micah can probably tell you that from
[1:38:56] living downtown for a year or whatever
[1:38:58] it was and all the racket that goes on
[1:39:01] and all the spirits that come out it's
[1:39:03] it's it's demonic feast time in the
[1:39:05] spirit and and john 3 says that people
[1:39:08] would rather be in the darkness than in
[1:39:11] the light
[1:39:12] they like the darkness rather than the
[1:39:14] light why because their deeds are hidden
[1:39:17] right
[1:39:18] they can hide in the darkness
[1:39:20] you can't hide in the light when the
[1:39:22] light shines then the darkness goes away
[1:39:24] the darkness goes away everything is
[1:39:26] plain you can see it well they like the
[1:39:29] darkness because their days are evil
[1:39:32] but we have renounced the hidden things
[1:39:35] of dishonesty
[1:39:37] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[1:39:40] the word of god deceitfully or that is
[1:39:42] by or that is to deceive someone or to
[1:39:46] lead someone astray
[1:39:48] amen the true
[1:39:51] children of god
[1:39:52] don't take the word of god to lead
[1:39:55] people astray from the truth of the
[1:39:58] spirit of christ
[1:40:00] they don't do it deceitfully
[1:40:02] you bring the word of god in truth and
[1:40:05] in revelation so that people will be
[1:40:07] enlightened by the word of god
[1:40:10] but where there's hybridism and when
[1:40:12] there's a a death
[1:40:14] it is a darkness the word is still hid
[1:40:18] why do you think the catholic church for
[1:40:19] all those hundreds of years wouldn't let
[1:40:22] the common person have a bible to read
[1:40:25] because they didn't want those people to
[1:40:26] know that what they were teaching them
[1:40:28] was against the word of god yes
[1:40:32] now they just don't care
[1:40:34] but that's how great the spirit has got
[1:40:37] right amen they used to care
[1:40:39] and then the gutenberg press came and
[1:40:41] they started getting the bible and all
[1:40:42] the hands of common people and people
[1:40:44] started reading what the bible was
[1:40:46] saying
[1:40:46] and the catholic church had a dark age
[1:40:49] where they were putting people to death
[1:40:51] by the thousands because of it fox book
[1:40:53] of martyrs yes
[1:40:55] dark ages putting them in depth just
[1:40:57] because they had a bible they could read
[1:40:59] don't you dare read that bible
[1:41:02] darkness
[1:41:04] but we
[1:41:05] not handling the word of god deceitfully
[1:41:08] but look at now but by manifestation of
[1:41:11] the truth now what is a man what is
[1:41:13] something manifested that's something
[1:41:15] that's known
[1:41:16] that's something that's in the light
[1:41:18] that's something to come out from the
[1:41:20] darkness that's something that's come
[1:41:22] out from being hid something that's no
[1:41:24] longer veiled is something that is
[1:41:26] manifested
[1:41:28] now you know
[1:41:31] the manifestation of the truth
[1:41:33] commending ourselves to every man's
[1:41:35] conscience in the sight of god but if
[1:41:37] our gospel be hid it is hid to them that
[1:41:40] are lost if it be hid who is it hid from
[1:41:46] if this gospel is veiled who is it
[1:41:48] veiled to
[1:41:50] the lost
[1:41:51] who will not see the truth of the
[1:41:53] revelation of the word
[1:41:55] the lost
[1:41:58] brother branham preached that message
[1:41:59] souls in prison
[1:42:01] he talked about jesus going down to hell
[1:42:03] and preaching to the souls that are
[1:42:05] imprisoned those that are totally and
[1:42:07] eternally lost
[1:42:10] he even questioned if his ministry in
[1:42:12] 1963
[1:42:14] had
[1:42:16] flipped to ministering to the total lost
[1:42:21] amen
[1:42:22] thankfully there was still some light
[1:42:24] out there
[1:42:25] and i thank god and i believe that i was
[1:42:27] one of those
[1:42:28] uh well a couple years later i became
[1:42:31] one of those uh beacons of light
[1:42:33] i believe you were too
[1:42:35] but by the grace of god that light began
[1:42:38] to overpower that darkness again because
[1:42:40] it wasn't time for that darkness to be
[1:42:42] revealed until the messenger
[1:42:46] until the message
[1:42:47] until the truth came to unveil that
[1:42:50] devil and expose him to what he really
[1:42:52] was
[1:42:53] but by the time that happened
[1:42:55] what was going on in the religious world
[1:42:57] then didn't matter they didn't care
[1:42:59] anymore
[1:43:00] the darkness had become so great and man
[1:43:03] had become so sinful they didn't care
[1:43:07] yeah
[1:43:08] i think the catholic church is about 1 2
[1:43:10] billion strong 1.2 billion strong now
[1:43:12] and all of her all the little uh harlots
[1:43:15] that follow after her mother
[1:43:17] amen
[1:43:19] how many more of those are there now
[1:43:21] another billion 2 billion 3 billion i
[1:43:23] don't know
[1:43:25] that are following along with her
[1:43:28] the offspring of mother
[1:43:30] they do the exact same thing
[1:43:34] to deceive
[1:43:36] to bring death yeah now there's probably
[1:43:39] some that do it purposefully but i think
[1:43:42] most people do it
[1:43:43] because it's just hid
[1:43:46] they just don't know
[1:43:47] but remember
[1:43:49] in this last day that willful ignorance
[1:43:52] has become one of the most prominent
[1:43:53] spirits that we see today the willful
[1:43:56] ignorance he said well i didn't know
[1:43:58] yeah but when truth presented itself to
[1:44:00] you and you turned it down you became
[1:44:02] willfully ignorant right
[1:44:04] because you had a chance
[1:44:06] it came across your path and you chose
[1:44:09] to deny it
[1:44:11] that's willful ignorance
[1:44:13] well i didn't know the message
[1:44:15] but you had a chance at it and you
[1:44:17] turned it down see there's a difference
[1:44:20] as we said a few weeks ago but if our
[1:44:22] gospel be hid if it is veiled it is
[1:44:25] mailed to the lost
[1:44:26] to the people that were lost
[1:44:28] in whom the gods of this world had
[1:44:31] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:44:33] not lest the light of the glorious
[1:44:35] gospel of christ who is the image of god
[1:44:37] shine upon them now why would god not
[1:44:40] allow that glorious light to shine upon
[1:44:42] them
[1:44:43] because they're terrors
[1:44:46] and in this last day friend the tares
[1:44:49] you say well the sun's been shining on
[1:44:50] the tares absolutely still does but in
[1:44:53] this last days the darkness is taking
[1:44:56] over amen remember this last church age
[1:44:59] was completely blacked out by god
[1:45:03] when he gave it to brother branham it
[1:45:04] was completely blacked out
[1:45:07] thank god for this sliver of light so if
[1:45:09] this sliver of light the bride leaves
[1:45:10] here what is there going to be
[1:45:13] nothing but darkness
[1:45:15] nothing but darkness
[1:45:17] amen and we see it now we see it it's
[1:45:20] all around us it's in this world today
[1:45:23] amen this mystery this mystery was
[1:45:27] finished under the seventh angel's
[1:45:29] message
[1:45:30] this mystery this unveiling was finished
[1:45:33] under the seventh angels message
[1:45:35] two more scriptures i want to read to
[1:45:38] get to where i want to be next week
[1:45:41] revelation chapter 3.
[1:45:50] revelation 3 14
[1:45:51] the laodicea church age
[1:45:54] the last church age
[1:45:56] the last
[1:45:59] age that goes into apostasy is we know
[1:46:02] the pale horse rides into perdition into
[1:46:04] apostasy this age ends up in apostasy
[1:46:11] revelation 3 14. and unto the angel of
[1:46:14] the church of laodiceans right these
[1:46:16] things saith the amen the faithful true
[1:46:18] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:46:20] god which is jesus
[1:46:22] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:46:24] cold nor hot i would thou were cold or
[1:46:27] hot so then because they are lukewarming
[1:46:29] either cold or hot i will spew thee out
[1:46:31] of my mouth
[1:46:33] now remember this is the church age this
[1:46:35] is the church
[1:46:37] not the bride he's talking to
[1:46:39] this address
[1:46:41] is to the church of this laodicea
[1:46:45] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:46:47] increased with goods and have need of
[1:46:50] nothing my does that not sound like
[1:46:51] today
[1:46:53] goodness if that just sounds just like
[1:46:55] today
[1:46:56] i tell you
[1:46:58] in my opinion just real quick my opinion
[1:47:01] i think there's three classes of
[1:47:03] homeless people today
[1:47:04] there's people that are probably
[1:47:05] mentally ill
[1:47:07] which there should be a place for them i
[1:47:09] believe there should be a place those
[1:47:11] people should have to live on the street
[1:47:13] i believe there's people that are
[1:47:14] starting out on drugs i believe there
[1:47:16] should be a place for those people i
[1:47:18] believe there should be help to get
[1:47:20] those people help if the government can
[1:47:22] spend trillions and trillions of dollars
[1:47:24] on all this other stuff surely they can
[1:47:26] help the people that are most distraught
[1:47:28] downtrodden but i think there's a third
[1:47:30] group of those people who are homeless
[1:47:32] by choice
[1:47:34] they're out on the street because they
[1:47:35] want to be
[1:47:36] there's no responsibility they don't
[1:47:38] have to get a job you just beg for a
[1:47:39] little bit of money and live day to day
[1:47:41] live in the culvert out here until it
[1:47:43] gets washed away with the monsoon rains
[1:47:45] then you move to wherever
[1:47:48] and you beg on the side of the road and
[1:47:49] some people i i you said brother you
[1:47:51] don't know about that i i ubered a
[1:47:53] little kid like not a little kid a kid
[1:47:55] is i say little he's 19 or 20. um
[1:51:00] expose the devil it was the message of
[1:51:02] william brown the seventh angel
[1:51:04] messenger
[1:51:05] that brought light
[1:51:06] the light of the gospel that exposed
[1:51:08] that devil that took it all out of
[1:51:10] darkness right amen
[1:51:13] and he and i'm not saying it is so don't
[1:51:15] go brother newton said
[1:51:17] you know i i heard
[1:51:19] people were saying that me and me and
[1:51:20] michael were advocating the shot the
[1:51:22] vaccine
[1:51:24] no we weren't i was normica or i were
[1:51:28] advocating for you to get the shot we
[1:51:31] weren't doing that
[1:51:33] i i i i thought that was pretty clear
[1:51:36] but we that's not what we were saying he
[1:51:39] was just giving you some information
[1:51:40] about it things that are medically to be
[1:51:42] known which to and brother brother green
[1:51:46] always said it informed people's not a
[1:51:47] confused people but just try to inform
[1:51:49] you of that and then tell you
[1:51:52] look i am not going to tell anybody i'm
[1:51:55] not a medical doctor
[1:51:58] i i can't tell you you better get it
[1:52:02] you have to do what you feel that of god
[1:52:04] to do
[1:52:05] now obviously people that are in certain
[1:52:07] conditions those that have had health
[1:52:09] issues diabetes overweight things like
[1:52:12] that older
[1:52:13] older population those are the things
[1:52:16] those are the ones that's had the worst
[1:52:17] results when they get it
[1:52:19] our precious brother emanuel rojas just
[1:52:21] passed away
[1:52:23] this is a good example of brother
[1:52:25] monreal
[1:52:27] brother joel a
[1:52:28] precious brother loved him with all my
[1:52:30] heart he's such a a good man a good
[1:52:32] family man
[1:52:34] diabetes
[1:52:35] a little overweight had diabetes it
[1:52:37] really it hits those people but i'm not
[1:52:40] going to tell you to do that
[1:52:42] i'm here to preach the gospel and i'll
[1:52:43] tell you to get a shot
[1:52:46] if i can't trust god for that little bit
[1:52:48] friend then i know i have no business
[1:52:50] being up here
[1:52:52] i mean i almost feel like a hypocrite if
[1:52:54] i didn't feel that way like i i'm what
[1:52:57] kind of christian am i
[1:52:59] but i can tell you you better do what
[1:53:02] you feel that of god to do yes i can
[1:53:04] tell you that
[1:53:06] the medical world and your doctor or
[1:53:07] whatever the things micah told you if it
[1:53:09] if it did something this way that that's
[1:53:11] up to you but you do what you feel that
[1:53:13] to do
[1:53:14] amen that's all i can say do what the
[1:53:16] lord in your life if you're if you were
[1:53:19] born again and feel the spirit of god
[1:53:21] now if i was just going out advising
[1:53:23] just somebody on the street
[1:53:25] and they ask my opinion i'd probably
[1:53:27] tell them those things if you fit in
[1:53:29] these categories i'd probably do it
[1:53:33] amen
[1:53:35] mo but most people children
[1:53:38] healthy adults
[1:53:40] uh rarely get that sick
[1:53:43] they do sometimes but rarely do they get
[1:53:45] that sick and mike explained that last
[1:53:47] week i thought it was excellent
[1:53:48] how that affects the body but anyway
[1:53:51] i i gotta move on i just the lord just
[1:53:54] puts things like this in me that i just
[1:53:56] feel like i need to clarify yeah so i
[1:53:58] hope that's okay
[1:54:00] um
[1:54:02] and he cried by them with a strong voice
[1:54:04] saying babylon the great is fallen is
[1:54:06] fallen and it's become the habitation of
[1:54:08] devils now we read about babylon right
[1:54:10] here in revelation 17. we know that's
[1:54:12] catholic church and all of her harlots
[1:54:15] came off of her it's fallen and each one
[1:54:18] of them has become the habitation of
[1:54:19] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:54:22] and the cage of every unclean and
[1:54:25] hateful bird
[1:54:26] so the devil
[1:54:28] said it in the temple of god showing
[1:54:31] himself that he is god
[1:54:34] amen for all the nations have
[1:54:38] have drunk of the wine of the wrath for
[1:54:40] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:54:42] have committed fornication with her
[1:54:43] right here again revelation 17
[1:54:46] have committed fornication with her
[1:54:48] uncleanness unclean if you know
[1:54:50] fornication unclean living
[1:54:52] amen filthiness
[1:54:54] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:54:56] rich through the abundance of her
[1:54:57] delicacies but now to the bride
[1:55:01] he said i have heard another voice from
[1:55:03] heaven saying come out of her my people
[1:55:05] and be not partakers of her sins that
[1:55:08] you receive not her plagues yes
[1:55:12] that's to the bride yeah man amen
[1:55:15] the church has gotten its message but
[1:55:17] the bride has gotten her message and
[1:55:19] that message is you come out of her
[1:55:22] because you belong to me be no partaker
[1:55:25] of her sin
[1:55:26] but be partaker of the purity and the
[1:55:28] holiness of the spirit of god and the
[1:55:30] righteousness that he brings the word
[1:55:33] brings
[1:55:34] come out of it
[1:55:36] don't be a part of it yeah be a part of
[1:55:38] this the word the spirit the truth yes
[1:55:41] let
[1:55:42] let the lord
[1:55:44] take a hold of your life
[1:55:46] amen amen
[1:55:48] come out of it
[1:55:50] that's the message to the bride
[1:55:52] don't be partaker dude
[1:55:54] if you love the world the things of the
[1:55:55] world the love of god is not even in you
[1:55:57] how dwelleth the love of god in you
[1:55:59] because there's only one love in there
[1:56:03] and if it's the love of if it's the love
[1:56:05] of the world if it's the love of this
[1:56:07] cosmos out here
[1:56:08] god's love can't be in there
[1:56:11] because if god's love is in there it
[1:56:13] won't love those things of the world
[1:56:15] it'll only love the things of god
[1:56:18] so the two cannot cohabitate they have
[1:56:20] to there can only be one in there
[1:56:23] come out of her that's the message to
[1:56:25] the bride
[1:56:26] that's the message of this day yes is
[1:56:29] there a falling away oh absolutely
[1:56:31] absolutely
[1:56:32] i almost say this i've said this and i'm
[1:56:34] going to say it on you
[1:56:36] record it
[1:56:38] i i personally believe billy paul passed
[1:56:40] away one day
[1:56:42] before this happens i could be
[1:56:44] absolutely wrong it's new bennett's
[1:56:46] opinion
[1:56:48] and i would imagine
[1:56:49] a lot of people that are hanging on to
[1:56:52] that billy paul not being old man before
[1:56:53] the rapture
[1:56:55] are going to go away
[1:56:58] my opinion
[1:56:59] but there's been
[1:57:00] great fallings away already people
[1:57:02] believing the truth of the word
[1:57:05] not not necessarily leaving church
[1:57:08] although some are not mess maybe going
[1:57:11] to a different denomination or something
[1:57:13] but leaving the word leaving the purity
[1:57:16] of the word
[1:57:17] i told you the other day i i think of
[1:57:19] that and i think
[1:57:20] i've actually
[1:57:22] not not too greatly but i've actually
[1:57:25] contemplated in my head what would i do
[1:57:28] if i didn't have this message and and
[1:57:30] the revelation of that word that god's
[1:57:32] given to me
[1:57:33] to minister i don't i don't know what i
[1:57:36] would do i i just probably just i'd be a
[1:57:38] baptist i guess i guess be a good
[1:57:40] methodist or something this is a
[1:57:43] a good one of those that has a 30 000
[1:57:45] seat stadium and says god is such a good
[1:57:48] god and god loves you and and god's
[1:57:51] gonna take care of you and and you are
[1:57:53] your god and and and everything's the
[1:57:55] grass is green and sky is blue and it's
[1:57:57] all beautiful and perfect and harmony
[1:57:59] and love and everything is wonderful and
[1:58:01] you know brother i was listening brother
[1:58:02] brown the other day and he said people
[1:58:04] keep saying god's such a good god he
[1:58:06] said till i want to puke
[1:58:09] he said it makes me sick that people
[1:58:11] keep telling god's a good god he said
[1:58:13] yeah he's a good god but he's a god of
[1:58:14] wrath and judgment too yes he is he's
[1:58:17] not some dirty grandpa up there just
[1:58:19] saying oh it's okay just live like any
[1:58:21] way you want yeah you can have rock and
[1:58:23] roll and the church is no problem it's
[1:58:25] just as long as you're entertained
[1:58:27] that's all that really matters
[1:58:29] hogwash that's demonic amen and so the
[1:58:32] devil friend
[1:58:35] god is a righteous god god is a holy god
[1:58:37] a holy people and a rapture
[1:58:40] amen in a rapture
