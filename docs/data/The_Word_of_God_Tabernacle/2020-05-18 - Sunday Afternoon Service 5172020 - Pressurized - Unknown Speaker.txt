TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you for tuning in today reaching the lovely name of the Lord Jesus today another beautiful resurrection morning watching the beautiful doves fly out outside there outside our window and just enjoying the Lord's presence and enjoy the Lord's goodness in our lives so god bless you today we want to go ahead and start our service now as I've mentioned to you a couple of times in text this week we're looking for a couple of places now I've got something that we looks like most definitely can use at a conference room at the Holiday Inn don't want to begin starting until it kind of felt led to start maybe June 7th so maybe Lord willing we can do that it got a couple other fillers out we'll see what happens with those but one of them is in a more permanent place which I'm hoping we get I'd like to have more of a permanent place so we can just set up and be set up be our place and nobody else in there but us so just continue to pray for us and just trust the Lord's blessings upon that and just believe the Lord will just provide us he provided the other place it's his work so he's obligated to take care of it it's not our work it's his so if it was mine then I would be obligated to take care of it but it's his so he's obligated to take care of it he just leads us to guides us in the right direction to help so look a little probably look a little medium-rare to you to take I don't know how good the camera quality is but me and brother Roger did up another job Electric job I've been working with Bertha Roger enjoying this fellowship have been working with him I was a helper in his electrical Jobson we were outside all day Friday so it got a little red but God blessed us and helped us to be able to get everything done and God blessed us so we have a couple of prayer requests want to make you aware of as as as we go to the Lord today brother Dennis asked us we continue remember his wife Leah of course as you all know she's nurse working with the doctor whose office has stayed open during this entire period and just pray the Lord keep her hedged and keep her protected in him as well and brother Dennis also asked that we would remember him his back has been given in some problems and has been hurting lately so let's just remember him in prayer as well brother angel Frey who had sent us sent me a text tube and said he's asking prayer for God to help them his family draw closer and to be reflecting God's glory to all around them also for God to help his dad who's having trouble breathing and sleeping also for his brother to come back to a walk of life with the Lord a holy walk of life of the Lord for his mother-in-law to be protected and to be baptized soon forgot to apply that holy blood daily and to be manifesting as God's fruit in these last days let us speak for God to meet all of our needs in these last days and to just give God all his praise for all all God has done and all my family I also want to wish my mother-in-law happy 70th birthday and for God to bless all the church fan all my church family for we miss you all dearly god bless you all always - appreciate brother angel sending that and also sister Celia sent to request to continue remember her brother Harlan and prayer Harlan has had some supernatural things and of course through sister Celia as well things happen in his life and he's seen the hand of God move in his life and says that he can feel when the believers were praying for him so let's just continue obviously to remember him in prayer she also wanted me to mention that Gabriel's birthday he'll be five years old Tuesday so I had to birthday to Gabriel I don't know if are trying gay browse or watching but at birthday Gabriel if you are when you see this amen we love you and love you all of the Lord and just wish you a wonderful fifth birthday and the Lord so also sister Lydia had sent us a request for her niece Marie who has an unspoken prayer request but also wants to thank the Lord for bringing her son back home safe from the Middle East he is served serving in the Air Force god bless you so we want to remember that in prayer of his her niece Marie had a special unspoken request so we certainly want to remember that in prayer the God will just move upon that request and need if you have a request you didn't send it to me or something that's upon your heart or maybe something unspoken you know the Lord knows our hearts we lift our hands in church which is fine too but just giving something as a signification to the Lord you know it takes sometimes that little movement of significant significance that movement that we do that signifies to the Lord that we accept and acknowledge the fact that he sees our hearts and he knows our requests so if you have those things just keep them on your heart and we're go to the Lord in prayer now precious Lord Jesus thank you again father for your blessings to us today thank you for waking us up with health and strength in life and our bodies and blessing us to see another beautiful Sunday morning God you are the resurrected Jesus Christ the Lord and Savior that's risen in our hearts and leads and guides us into your perfect will according to your good pleasure Lord Lord we just surrender ourselves to you fully again today that your Holy Spirit God WA might have preeminence in our lives and do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask her think Lord in our lives as we just continue forward with this service and pray that you'd fall upon every request and every need that was made known Lord we know that you're with Lia God that you would touch your head your keep her protected at her job and also help brother Dennis with his back and healing Lord take this off the rightest from him and make it perfectly well Lord my mom remembers sister Lydia's niece God Marie God that your hand would be on her and you know her requests our unspoken requests and she wants to let you know and give you thanks and praise bringing your son back safe the Lord just move upon this request we just believed Lord in the name of Jesus Christ continue to help him be with sister caelius brother Harlan Lord we know that you're faithful and that you're true God and he feels your presence with him Lord sister Celia just sent him a new Bible may you read it Lord may it be revealed to him and may he draw closer to you through this trying time of this life and lord I pray that should help Gabriel bless his fifth birthday may have a wonderful blessed birthday Lord you got I pray that you continue to help sister and brother angel and Lord his requests and for all the requests that he gave Lord many but Lord you know them all and all of our hearts and all of our needs God call fresh in every living room fall fresh in every home right now may your holy anointing God even though we're separate physically Lord not separate spear that you fall fresh I mean that holy annoying he just rained down God thick and that each one Lord it's listening in today can feel and know that your presence is with them to reveal your word and to help us for what this service today Lord we just thank you God for being able to have this time and to have this streaming opportunity may you bless it now Lord and speak through these lips the word should have us to hear we know that you're mindful of us God and we just pray that you continue to lead me show me God where you'd have us to be and where you want this work to be next Lord what you provide for us a place places in real estate here is quite expensive for our little group Lord but God is you provided for for I believe you'll provide again so God may you just lead us and show us your perfect will and help us to do according to what you would have lord I pray that you bless this little message today help it bless it draws closer to you by it Lord is your trying times that we're living in but believing that your Holy Spirit is with us to lead guide and direct us into all your truths we give you glory praising honor father and we commit the remaining part of this service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord god bless you today may have a little more issue with the camera mic forgot to put the battery in this camera but so we're just streaming with our regular old desk camera today so I apologize for maybe the blurring in and out but would just try to make the best of it as we can and just continue to see what the Lord provide going forward so a little thought the Lord put on my heart and wanted to give it to you I I want to continue on with the thought of the Christ mystery of God revealed or the mystery and God in Christ I wanted to continue that thought that we've left off when I went to North Carolina to visit my mom but honestly I really I really would like to do that when we have a permanent place more than just this streaming not that there's anything wrong with the streaming and I want to continue this streaming once we have a place a more permanent place but I just felt like for some reason I don't know I just felt like when we get a place that we can all be together again and see your beautiful faces and we just continue on that thought so just a couple of things that maybe the Lord helped us with and you know with the current conditions and things that's going on in the world and it seems like a lot of the midweek messages have been focused on that and maybe this is well today so I want to speak on a subject that I spoke on at our church here three or four years ago I guess when I say four years ago it's honestly I meant to check but I have to look again I believe Friday was our fourth anniversary four years ago Friday I think it was May 15th four years ago we've had our four year they anniversary it's just wonderful how you've put up with me this hump but God's been good to us hasn't he for years Mabel it was May 15th May 15th or maybe even today I'm not sure I got to go look my records again but I think it was May 15 so four years so about three years or so ago I ministered on this some of you may have remembered it but I want to talk about being pressurized and how the bride and going through this things as things that we're going through today and all that is happening in our lives is it's just to help get us ready and prepared to go in a rapture to be ready when God calls us home so that takes some pressurization to to get us through everything that's going on in the world today and prepare us to get ready to go home so let me just begin a scripture reading before I actually start here on the on the subject but in st. Loup Saint Luke chapter 22 is where I want to begin my scripture reading today you remember the topic here is being pressurized pressurized or the day of pressure st. Luke chapter 22 and if there ever was that they have pressure friend we know that's today st. Luke 20 to 39 and he came out and went as he was walk to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed now each one of these of course we know this is Jesus going to the Garden of Gethsemane and each account of this has a different accounting and some a little more descriptive this one I picked because of the description that because I believe this described it more adequately than of what the point I wanted to make today the other ones are quite outstanding as well if you want to go to Matthew 26 36 or mark 14 32 those are still some very stark accounts of this Jesus the Garden of Gethsemane he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done there we know of course he went a couple of times back and forth and of course Matthews account accounts more of those events than what Luke does here Luke was getting to a specific point and so he narrows it down and doesn't go to the back and forth Jesus went and prayed and come back to his disciples he went a little further which is something all of us could probably do from time to time go a little further a little deeper a little more consecrated Jesus went a little further and and and he was wrestling he was wrestling with the with the thought of what he was going to have to go through I believe the Matthew where the market count talks about him going through across the book Brook of Sidra maybe that was even John the brook of seed Ryan remember brother green telling us about how the when the sacrifice and the time of the sacrifice of the lambs and all the people would come and all that blood would run down through that Brook and as brother as Jesus cross over that Brook and seeing that huge flood of blood coming down through there you know at the strike a man's heart because remember God was mad Jesus was man as much as he was God Jesus wept he was he was both divine and mortal and so you can imagine the mortal part of him going across that brook and seeing all that blood coming down through them realizing what his ultimate destination was his destiny his destiny was that that part of that would be his blood that blood that would be running out of his veins and can you imagine the agony he was going through can you imagine the pressure that Jesus was feeling to fulfill the destiny that God had given him just think about how the the agony that a man a person in their humanity would feel realizing what they're about to go through so he's crying Lord if thou if this cup can pass for me if there's any other way that this can be done if there's any other way that what you want to get accomplished can be accomplished Lord would you do it that way I believe a lot of us have probably thought that ourselves Lord if there's any other way that you can do this any other way that this can be accomplished other than my involvement Lord could you do that that way but Lord but the Lord sends us here to do our part you know even brother Roderick were talking the other day about the bride's responsibilities and sounds like a good message really maybe get into that but the bride's responsibility you realize that when a man marries a wife he doesn't just carry her across the threshold of their home and throw all the cops and say okay you just sit there awhile know that she has a job to do she has responsibilities she has things that she does and her main focus is taking care of her Lord taking care of her King taking care of her husband that's her main responsibility and and but she's responsible to God for what God has put her to do and and all of our responsibilities our responsibility and this responsibility was his but yet the flesh of the man was crying Lord if there's any way this cup can pass for me let it pass did you imagine if you thought and knew that you were going to go through this situation I probably saying the same thing if not worse but yet he come to the place that he had to die to his flesh even in the midst of the great pressure that he was feeling at this time look at this this pressure was so great father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done now we know that was accomplished over a couple of times but again Luke narrows it down nevertheless not my will but thine will be done so he had to die to himself and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him 44 first now and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly oh what a lesson for Saints what a lesson when the pressure is on when the desperation hits and the pressure is on is a time to enter into a more earnest a more desperate prayer Jesus got into an agony and he prayed more earnestly and his sweat as it were great drops of blood now I don't know there's any human ever entered into that kind of agony before but that's pretty severe now I've said this before and I've heard people say and I don't want to be contradicting and I don't want to argue with anybody but some people think that boy came out of him I don't believe that's what happened personally I believe that the Bible says his sweat was as it were great drops of blood his sweat not blood his sweat was as great drops of blood so his sweat coming out of him was like it would be great drops of blood snot little blood but that still think about the agony that Jesus was going through at this period of his life agony more earnestly his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground now if any man every / any person ever been into a place of the feeling pressure the whole way that the entire world was on Jesus soldiers the entire weight of every human ever comin whose feet at this soil from the from Adam to the last born man 10 seconds before was on Jesus shoulders to every human that would ever be born after his crucifixion was on his shoulders do you imagine the pressure the pressure of feeling of what he was about to do his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground when he rose up from the prayer he was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleepy rise and pray lest she enter into temptation No to think about this great day of pressure and it is a great day of pressure I mean my goodness you see the world going crazy over the coronavirus I mean the world think the nation they're going going crazy over this of this one virus and we've had much more serious things hit the planet before but it seems to this one thing seems to have gripped people so much it's putting people under such great pressure think about the leadership of our federal government and think about the leadership of our national and and federal and local governments the pressure that's on them every life every person is that they're responsible for it's under great pressure and think about the the lives that that Christians are living - think about the place that we're at today and the great pressure that we're under to be able to do what God has called us to do to be led by his spirit and to do what His perfect will would be for us think about that great pressure but now I want you understand as I've said this before pressure is not always a bad thing pressure is a very important part of our everyday life you wouldn't get very far if there wasn't some pressure in your tires in your car you would go very far tires would be flat just think if you went to the sink and turn the faucet and no water came out why because there's no pressure you say there's plenty of water in the pipe but there's no pressure behind the water to get it through the party takes pressure every day in Tucson we live especially in the deep the season that we're coming up in it's very important to have some pressure in our lives because without it our air conditioners wouldn't work astronauts couldn't go in down our space people could go down in the depths of the water couldn't fly airplanes airplanes have to be pressurized so that we can form so pressure is a very important part of of our daily lives and the things that go on our lives without it we would be in a bad condition we would be in bad shape without pressure god but God and those are some positive things that we look at of what pressure is taking place every day and in certain parts of our lives and of course you can think of probably several other things but God also uses that pressure to get us prepared to get us ready to get to get us in the place that we need to be to serve Him and to live for him that pressure that he puts on our lives every day does what it without pressure you cannot find the weak spot in a tire you know or in a pipe or something this chain is only as good as its weakest link and if that weakest link is not shored up by putting it under pressure see if you just leave that leak that weak link there when the pressure really does come the serious pressure that link is going to break so what God does is he makes sure and tests us he makes sure tests to make sure whatever that weak link is if it's gonna break it's gonna break it that weak link and then if that weakly core or that one spot springs a leak or that one place and you tire springs a leak you know where to fix it you know how to shore up that weak spot and the only way that weak spot in your life can come forward is if there's pressure put on you and that pressure brings us to a place of acknowledgment to say God and this is a weak spot of my life I want this fixed you got what we - sure this place up I don't want this place to explode or a lot of people have a weak spot and then they explode into anchor or something we don't we don't want that to happen we want to make sure that there's places that that God wants to use for through us stay short up and stays pressurized and stays and stays covered so that that weak spot that is detected is is fixed is repaired God uses pressure to be able to do that God uses pressure in our life look what brother Branham said here in the mighty conquer he said after dr. Constantine come over liberate them from under the Roman persecution United the church to stay together there where we got Catholic to begin with when they did this the church lost more grounds in ten years than had gained all through the persecution if there's anything that makes Christians lazy think about this anything that makes Christians lazy it's when they're on a flowery bed of ease don't we don't have we don't have a persecution enough we don't have it hard enough always at the chain is strongest as its weakest link and a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure you are what you really are when you're under pressure we all of us we can show ourselves and flatteries and fineries and and put up a front facade and and make it look like something but you put a little pressure on it and then you find out what that man is really made of you can buy a beautiful tire you can buy the greatest best one that was ever made and you can put it on your car but if there's a defect in that tire it won't come out till you put a little pressure on it you realize hey this tire is is defective it's not right it was manufactured wrong something's wrong with it the only way you can find out is when pressure is placed on it that's why God uses that pressure see a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure that pressure helps us realize who we are it'll get everybody else realize who we are when the pressures really put on his real true characteristics will show when he or she what she is under pressure it brings out the real person it brings out the true individual when that person is under pressure get him all riled up stir it up and you'll see if the real man comes out if he's got a temper it'll show itself if he's meek generally it'll show itself but put him under pressure Watson he's got his children God puts his children under pressure to test whether there are any flaws in them and we all don't none of us won't floss and all of us want to be at the place and see that that's the problem I think a lot of us get to sometimes were too willing to accept our flaws we're too willing to think well God forgives that or God excuses that or God is okay with that but that's not true God doesn't God will forgive I'm not saying God's not forgiving I'm not saying God's not a merciful God full of grace I'm saying that God places us under that pressure so that if we can fix that so we can make that right don't accept it is just normal don't accept it is well it's okay with God it's okay with me it's not okay especially if that pressure keeps putting up putting you in the same position every time and you keep going up every time well if it was okay God wouldn't keep putting you in that same position every time he does that because he wants you to fix it he wants you to make it right he wants you to change it whatever part of your life for how it needs to be done to fix her to sure that spot-up God wants you to do it and see if if we get to that point where God does that then it helps us understand more it puts us at sea we can't accept it it's it's not acceptable don't accept any flaws she said well I'm here but what I'll do but of course we're gonna make mistakes that's not what I'm talking about this is talking about perpetual things that are weaknesses in our lives if God keeps putting you under that same pressure that same condition that same thing to test you for that same thing continually that means that he is not pleased with you being that way and we need to fix that don't make the acceptant of it buh-bam said here anything that makes a Christian lays you fiery betta bees God doesn't want to set on a flowery bed of bees he wants rugged Christians let's look at this quote here God has identified by his characteristics Beaumont 1964 today we got a bunch of hotbed plants called Christians somebody you have to spray in baby and pamper and humor and we'll give you a and we'll give you give me fellowship will you if you'll cooperate will you do this that oh you bunch of hotbed plants we need some genuine Christianity born of the Spirit of God that'll take no cooperation no nothing else they don't want nothing because Christians are rugged amen Christians are rugged they're they're not a bunch of hotbed plants you don't have to baby a Christian because they know who they are and they know what the pressure and when that pressure comes to them they're willing to accept it but they want to fix it they want to do something about it they want to make it right they want to take that spot in them and make it right and fix that spot look what David said a man of course under pressure we all are no one is exempt from it no some probably some of you maybe even probably feel like I get more than my share of pressure look friend we're all that way some short a little more than others some you can recognize it more than others but the fact in truth of it is we are all in some way shape or form under a great deal of pressure especially as a Christian you know no pressure in this life until you become a Christian when you become a Christian that's when the real pressure starts you look and think what the presence under a lot of pressure yes the billionaire is a lot of pressure yes it may not be because of finances but trust me they're under pressure suicide among teenagers wouldn't be the place it is the the child abuse and the abuse of individuals those things see when a person is if somebody's weak in an area and and I'm gonna pick one us men but if a man an ungodly man of course it is weak in an area unless say he has a temper most ungodly men do have a temper unless you say he has a temper and he has a he gets to the places that he gets so pressured so much pressure now he's not pressurized now that's the topic that we're talking about because I want to end up with that part I want to end up with the pressurized but when they get under pressure they're not pressurized so if they're not pressurized when they get under that pressure then they explode the explosions got to come out somewhere and then that's when you see domestic violence you see people treating their wives and men treating their wives or children and things like that and suicide and bullying at school and all kinds of things that come out because of all the pressure it comes out because they don't know how to deal with it they don't know where to take it or to put it they don't know how to how to deal with it some most of the time people go to drugs to find a bar alcohol or righteous living gambling or whatever people find all kind of ways to try to release that pressure but everybody's under pressure everybody and the greatest pressure is when you become a Christian you don't know pressure until you become a Christian till you become born again then you begin to realize that pressure amen that's that great pressure is added but look what David said let's go to Psalm chapter 61 Psalm chapter 61 we'll begin reading with verse 1 Psalm 61:1 hear my cry O God attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed now look where he's going look where David's going from the end of the earth I will cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than iron and who is that rock that rock is Jesus well people don't have Jesus where they go to they go to their rock what is their rock to be drink could be gambling whatever people have a wrong people have a place to release it sometimes people get so much pressure they can't release it all they just killed themselves suicide people then became to kill themselves because the pressure just gets too great and and they can't release enough of it and it overwhelms them but David said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to that rock that is higher than I lead me to Jesus Jesus although Jesus takes care of the situation for thou has seen a shoe that has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I will abide in thy tavern before ever I will trust in the covet cover of thy wings Sayla amen David where did David decided to go David said lead me to the rock you say take me to Jesus lead me to Christ help me to get to the place but brother knew you just told me you don't know what pressure is until you become a Christian that's absolutely right but when you get that pressure as a Christian you have a place and someone to take it for you you fix that you sure that place up you you fixed that weak link you plug up that hole you stop that anger that that that temper and and you fix it you shored up and you got someone you go to and you release that to the Lord you say God my heart is overwhelmed god help me lead me to a place of peace lead me to Psalms 23 lead me to that place and you know a lot of people they read Psalms 23 at funerals but to me friends Psalms 23 is that a live scripture that's a scripture of being alive not dead though I walk they in through the valley of the shadow he leadeth me beside still waters he layeth me down in green pastures there you go there's where your release is he meant your release is it gambling and drinking or beating your wife your releases laying in green pastures going by the still waters what a beautiful thing the people could just only realize Fran if we can just realize how important this pressure is to us because God's getting us pressurized that pressurization just like an airplane that airplane is not past pressurized then everybody in it would duck it's the it's being pressurized that God wants to bring us to that place where we're pressurized so when the pressured is does come in it doesn't make any difference when you fix that hole in the tire and you fill that thing back up with air all the pressure from around it in it's not going to matter because it's short itself up now it's ready to fulfill its purpose its purpose to get you from point A to point B in your car it's ready to do what it's supposed to do David say when I'm overwhelmed and leave me to that rock leave me to that rock that is higher than I when I can't control it when I can't help it when I can't do it God God you bring me to that place that seems like the corona virus and the lock-up has really gotten people on edge gotten people to the point of anxiety and the point of suicide and pent up and you know because it gets us to the place that that people just can't handle that pressure and they can't handle being in a place that's that's secluded in and and a lot of people's releases of that pressure have been cut off bar has been shut down gambling place has been shut down and places that a lot of people use for release been shut down what do people do then Jesus doesn't shut down Jesus is open 24/7 Oh a friend is just people just get to realize it's the only way to live it's the only life there is look at this scripture this quote here here he him spoke in Washington 1962 now if that gun brother man I was talking about the time that a brother brother man had always wanted her whether it be rifle this brother it knew that brother branham so you took one of the rifles that they hurt that I believe was a Remington company could bore it out to make it like a Weatherby rifle and he gave it to brother Brown said this this was this was taken from a Remington to become like a Weatherby rifle and so this is the this is brother Browns explanation of course brother branham goes and he tries to hunt or shoot with that reformed whether it be rifle reformed Remington - of whether me and the gun blows up in his face why was the why did it blow up in his face now see whether man is talking now now if that gun would have started from the beginning in Weatherby dyes and have been made a Weatherby rifle it would never have blown up talk about blowing on people go up to take see because it would have been a whether it be rifle there same kind of steel that made up their dyes and everything he'd come right out into the regular rifle that it should have been but being it was something else and just nothing and just not only converted but was perverted into something that it wasn't and that's what made it blow up you think about people the same way today you got hybrid religions people that think they have something they really don't and then when the real pressure comes they think oh I'm a Christian oh I'm a believer and then when the real pressure comes what happens to him they blow up why because they weren't made in the Wetherby rifle factory the human wasn't made and and borned again the spirit of god they weren't filled of the Spirit of God if they were never born again it doesn't matter what their testimony is doesn't matter what they say they are if they really aren't born again they have to go back to the factory they have to go back to the place whether they're supposed to get it from the beginning which is God and then that that die-cast in them exactly perfectly to be the image of Jesus Christ then when the pressure comes they won't blow up if they're taking this rifle this or or taking it from the exact steel and everything to be formed and made in the Wetherby plant the Weatherby factory to be a Weatherby rifle but every speck in every dimension and every way that a rather Weatherby rifle is made exactly to be pleasing in that whether it be a rifle way then it would have not blown up how you think about that people say the Christians would live all kind of lives people say they're born again and looked like the world people say they're born again and go to bars and drink and do all kinds of things friend I'm sorry it doesn't work that way you have to be in every way in every speck every dimension every part of a rifle of the weathering had to be exactly according to the specifications what every part of us has to be according every bit to the specifications if we don't meet these specifications then it's it has to it wasn't born in the right factory it's got to be born in the god factory then it won't blow up then it can be pressurized to not blow up brother BAM said not only converted from the Remy tool to a Weatherby but perverted from a Weatherby remington to whether we and that's the way we find ourselves along the road we find so many times that people just can't stand the pressure it's being a it's being a Christian is because they have never really died out to themselves and be reborn again made from the dies of God to stand below the pressure that comes against a real Christian you try to walk with a real saint of God and find that pressure hit against you like that you'll blow up and be back where you was to begin with but if you've been born again if you've been born again and really filled with God's Spirit then you are pressurized by God to stand the pressure that the world can put against it like that then you can stand the pressure then you can come against the pressure but look pressure is also something that can blow things up pressure is also a device that's used to to blow things up it creates such a pressure inside think of you know you probably think of bombs and stuff like that but just think of something simple like a balloon a balloon gets a lot of pressure in it but you know if you get past the point of that balloons capacity sometimes I don't know if you've ever done this but sometimes I've blown it up with helium and I thought just another shot of helium and that last little bit of shot of helium in the balloon boom sometimes I'll blow it up with my mouth I think just one more puff and you puff it boom that's it and just to all total took it was at its capacity you don't know that because you can't tell by the balloon but you brought that one more time in that boom that balloon blows up well you see Klee the same thing in the world and you think the same things with guns and bombs and and devices like that they blow up why do they blow up because the pressure inside gets so much that the container that it's in can't hold it anymore and then it blows up well think about what God's doing in this last day Hebrews chapter 12 because I want to get to something here on this and I get to a specific purpose here now go to go to Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 we're going to read that beginning with verse 25 Hebrews 12 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven heaven and earth will be shaken heaven and earth is being shaken and this word get once more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of the things are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God except ibly with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire so what God saying God saying I am NOT just shaking the earth but the heavens also heavens and earth are being shaken for what purpose so that everything that can be shaken will be shaken and only the things that are steady in front and solid God will not be shaken down everything else is to be removed everything from your life that is not pleasing to the Lord is to be removed everything that that doesn't come to make you closer to him because the whole point is to make us more like him a whole thing is to get us closer to him you think about the pressure that Joe went through Joe get through this wine he didn't do anything wrong although his secret friends is his great friends thought he did the affair with ferret or Fairweather friends I guess you call them they say well he must have done something wrong you must know you didn't do anything wrong God was just proving something God was proving his servant and just think about the pressure that he went through God proving dis servant but in the end God made job closer to him God made job more like him Joe reflected and talked about and ended up at the place where he realized that what God didn't he because he was a child of God God wants everyone of us closer to him so all the shaking is to shake everything away is to shake down all things that have no stable foundation the only things that are going to remain after all this shaking is something that has a stable foundation and the only stable foundation there is is God I see Jesus Christ is the only stable foundation that there is you said I said God a lot of people say God a lot of people have their own gods but there's only one Lord Jesus Christ God Almighty amen that's his name Jesus that foundation that's the only foundation that will stand when everything else is being shaken so we have to be on that foundation pressurized pressurized to be able to withstand everything that comes out from around us so that you you understand friend you are predestined oh I want to read let me I'll read this scripture here in a minute but I'm on this thought you are predestined if you're a child of God you are predestined to a specific psi and that's as entirely go pounds per square inch you look on you tire you tile probably say like 35 psi that means that your tire is registered to accept the air inside it to the point of 35 pounds of pressure per square inch that's the place that God's put you God makes us all different some people can take a little bit more some people can take a little bit less but God knows and some people said well why does this person this way and why does that person have this or go through that or whatever God has everybody at their own specific psi we're not cookie cutter Christians I've gone through this before we're not cookie cutter Christians God hasn't stamped us all out to be exactly identical we're all different while different because we all have to play a different part we all have to play a different role we all have our things to do on this earth God just take the thoughtful ministry and pastors and teachers and evangelists and apostles and God has all those gifts for different reasons for different purposes any-any makes us all to be able to fulfill ministers that are called ministers not man called God called to fulfill that purpose just like we talked about Mother's Day last week there's a reason there's a purpose some people have one child some people two three four five ten twelve whatever different reasons God pressurizes us differently look at this let me read this let me read this quote to first Corinthians are not quote this scripture first Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 first Corinthians 10:12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall that there there there have no temptation taken you but such as is common to man common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may may be able to bear it God makes a way for you to be able to bear it God is there for you because God puts you in a position to be able to take that pressurization maybe your psi 70 maybe the person next G is 50 maybe the person on the other side is 100 but each one God places because he knows who we are what we're able to do not do what we're able to take and not take God places that argue but yet is there to bring you out of it see the beautiful scripture God is faithful and will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but with the temptation also make a way for you to escape now think God uses this pressure you can think in terms I've used this a knowledge before the terms of a toothpaste tube if you take and take the cap off a full toothpaste tube and you squeeze it in the middle well water is going to squeeze out because it can't take the pressure the pressure comes and it goes and squirts out or that just makes room of the tube and and this end of the tube the toothpaste binds up together closer and the pressure on the end of that tube becomes greater but what do they do they don't squirt out they bind together well the same pressure that God puts to cause now this may sound wrong to people but in Scripture the same pressure that God would put he puts on certain people to leave because they're not predestined they're not born again they're not ones to receive the truth they're not once it's been pressurized they're not once it's been born to get a fill of God's Spirit so God uses the pressure sometimes to move that person out but the same pressure uses to move some people out is the same pressure he uses to draw us closer to him to become more like him it's the same question he's might one move away from the other looks and it brings some closer to him that's what God wants from us you think about the the eagle the eagle is pressurized to be able to go into the heavens but God won't pressure God won't put anything beyond your psi God won't put anything on you tempt you above what your psi is that God is going to be there to take care of that for you and help you through it in every way now some people think I'm closing here but some people think well I can't stand the pressure to take pressure off of me but that's not scriptural either it's not scriptural to ask for God to take the pressure off let's look at st. John chapter 17 it's going to be my last scripture here today st. John chapter 17 look at this st. John 17 we'll begin with verse 15 look what Jesus prayed now Jesus has said yeah here interceding praying he says I pray not st. John 17:15 I pray not that thou should has take them out of the world but that thou should has keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is the truth so what Jesus praying for us he says father I pray that you not take them out of the world don't take the pressure off just help them be able to bear it help them keep them from the evil one so it's not scripture to say God take all this pressure off now I can't stand this pressure yes you can if you're a Christian you're born again God would not put it on you if you couldn't bear it if you're a Christian God puts on you for a reason so don't say you can't because you can God put it there for a reason do you have to believe that hold it to your heart so he says don't take them out of it but help them through it so our prayer shouldn't be God take me out of this oh I can't stand this thought I can't bear this any longer yes you can't or he would have put it on you I can't say no say God just helped me get through it help me Lord I mean during that tunnel is it you can't even see the light at the end of there's a light there you know there is because you've gone through cleaning of tunnels yourself to know you know there's a light there you might not be able to see it but you know it's there and you see God just I don't want you to take me out and just help me through it there's a reason I'm in this position I'm a reason there's a reason I'm in this place god you're trying to pressurize me somehow to get me ready to bring me closer to you to make me more like you Lord to get me in the position that when it's your time to come and call me home whether it's by rapture or by the grave whatever it is that I'll be ready to go but friend that same pressure that we're asking God take me through the same pressures it's gonna put a bride in the rapture one day amen I believe it is we're gonna pressurize her out of here it's gonna bring her to the place of being pressurized you just like the eagle I just said just like the eagle to be pressurized the eagle there's no other bird can go that high like an eagle Hawk Falcon try to go up you disintegrate but a eagle its feathers are put in and its body is built to the place then it can go up into a heavens beyond the human sight sometimes I've set one time in Florida fishing on the end of brother Wayne's dock and I sitting there fishing enjoying my time of the Lord and an eagle comes off a tree I thought wow that's just beautiful and I take my eyes off for a minute watching the fishing and on I look up and that Eagles just circling and circling if this actually happened there eagle is circling and circling you know what they're doing I thought my that thing is just beautiful and I was fishing again and I look up again and I fish not look up and all of a sudden I'm looking up and that Eagles just circling and circling and circling and before I know it I can't even see him anymore he literally circled out of my sight I could not see it I watched him Circle up there I could not see him anymore because he's built for that he's pressurized to be able to see beyond things that other birds can't see God's putting us in heavenly places bringing us higher and higher as our consecration is to him like we said at the beginning of the service as our consecration is to him he's bringing us higher in those heavenly places to see things the rest of the world in Christ that the rest of the world can't see he's pressurizing us to be able to see that we are pressurized to be in those heavenly places to the rest of the rest of the world can't see them the rest of the world don't understand those things the rest of the world don't get those revelations of the word through the love letter God gave us they don't see those if Fred it it evolves beyond the brother branham said it brings you into that relationship with Jesus to work God is whispering sweet nothings to you not brother Branham said you nothing wrong with what brother and I said I'm not going beyond that I'm just saying if your only relationship is what brother Brown said you don't have a relationship your relationships with a dead man not with Jesus Christ I want my relationship with a risen Savior you get in those heavenly places friend you'll see those things that's the place of brother Branham got to then he employed every one of us to get to him it doesn't take some special gift you don't have to speak in tongues or have some prophecy or somebody say something over you you are if you're born again and you're a child of God you are in the place to be pressurised to get to that to where God reveals those things to you see things that the rest of the world they're not pressurized to see it they're not gonna see it the PSI that you're built to brings you to the place that you can handle those things amen that'll take you up in the rapture oh I'm so thankful friend God is working on us God hasn't give up on us he's still working on us he's bringing to that place and we continue to work for him now I know so many people and I'm just gonna skip this quote I know so many people and I keep hearing all the time everybody seems to be focusing on this coronavirus thing is the end all do all I just personally I don't I don't feel that way about it I know there's a lot of stuff going on I think I just believe this earth is preparing itself the government's everything is preparing itself to get into the tribulation the mark of the beast is getting itself to that place but you know what if we're here another 5 10 years she can understand that I believe this may be the last year but what if it's not I mean I thought that 20 30 years ago or so every year that I entered - I feel the same way but what if it's not what if it is another 10 years then we got a job to do it's another day God give us to do something for him another moment God's give us to be pressurized to be able to stand all of the wiles of the devil and everything that comes around is to be able to perform and to live to God's purpose whatever that is the purpose now you know part of it here I guess with the word of God Tabernacle is work still in our homes this stay-at-home order is lifted though that that's all been lifted we're going to get to the place that we're gonna have our own place of worship again and come together again Lord willin june 7th so we're getting ourselves to that place but there's something that God wants every one of us to do and that that part I'm not singing some great stratospheric supernatural whatever I whatever a little simple thing it is just like the little wash woman just like the little handbag whatever it is big small doesn't matter all pressurise to different PS is God's got it but your part is just as important as the next person's part just as important do you think my part was just as important as brother premise yes just as important because we're all a part of the same body of Jesus Christ you know one member is gone the whole body is maligned the whole body is deformed if one portion of it is out of whack it's out of kilter one portion that could be your portion we got to continue to do the part that God put us to and what he wants us to do and be that ready for when then when he calls us the rapture then we'll be ready to go be go home to be with him again praise the Lord so just continuing to member and remember in prayer don't ask God to take the pressure off of you just ask him to help you through it Lord just get me through it I know you wouldn't have put this on me if I wasn't able so you just get me through it Lord and help me God will do that I'll help you through it you just gotta remember trust him he meant a lot of to remember a lot of people explode a lot of people leave because he can't take but God has that there for a purpose amen praise the Lord god bless you I pray something was said to bless you today now Lord willing next Sunday we'll have another stream service like this one the following Sunday me and my wife's that is me and my wife 35th anniversary May 31st so there's a good chance we've been talking about getting out of town for that Sunday so we may not be here what I might do is is record something a little bit ahead of time or maybe an extra midweek or something for you for that Sunday always remember brother Roger streams from his place and he's been using brother Daniels facility on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings at 10 you're going to tune in Sunday mornings at 10 from brother Roger I know you'd be blessed by doing that we're talking about maybe coming together and having a building together and hymns because he just really wants the stream and have his streaming earlier in the morning and we could have like 11 o'clock service and on Sunday mornings so just pray for that and just pray for us so then when we get back after after that anniversary then it'll be June 7th and Lord will and we'll have a place but then we even if it's just the conference room there at the Holiday Inn we'll try to have something there and be able to meet together so we can come together again and have church like we should like we should the whole time so but just continue remember the Lord has a place and we'll just continue to press forward this battlin just pray God lead and guide us in His perfect will so pray the Lord bless you richly and remember if you have any need this week and you see anything we can before you just let us know amen and just pray that God would richly bless you des powerheads if we could or Jesus again father it's been a privilege Lord to have had this time together I can't see their faces Lord my loving congregation I can't see their faces but I know they're there Lord and I know if they weren't able to watch your live they're gonna watch but Lord I pray that you'd bless them exceedingly may your hand be upon them and help us Lord in every way provide for us Lord and protect us and keep us in your perfect wheel Lord let that pressure continue to show how how purposeful it is in our lives God and how much we need it and and bring us to the place that we can fix and repair all those weak spots and all those shortcomings and places Lord make them right come closer to you more like you Lord that's our whole desire believe Lord that very soon you come into call us home to be with you we don't know when that'll be but we know it's soon god help us to be more like you and drawn into your image and Lord let all the things in the shaking fall down away from us that you would be pleased with our lives and what we do God we love you we thank you for all that you've given to us and done for us and we know that you're with us and never leave us or forsake us that's the congregation today God may you just return to them a hundredfold father for the blessings God that they've been and Lord all they've given and done and love
