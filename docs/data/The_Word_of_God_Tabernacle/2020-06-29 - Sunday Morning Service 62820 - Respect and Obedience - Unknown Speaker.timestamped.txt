[0:16] good morning everyone god bless you
[0:18] today welcome to our home streaming
[0:21] service sorry we've had to revert back
[0:24] to this for now but explain a little bit
[0:27] of it to you but it's been a little
[0:28] connection kind of close with the kovat
[0:31] thing going on so I felt let I actually
[0:34] kind of felt a little warning during the
[0:35] week accident with things going on but
[0:37] then when things become a little closer
[0:39] to us got a little more serious brother
[0:43] Zack it had some symptoms and things and
[0:46] went tests it don't believe he has it by
[0:49] the grace of God but you know we just
[0:52] want to be very careful and one of the
[0:54] prayer requests we had also as her
[0:56] sister saw Shay she's in the hospital
[0:58] now and she looks like me maybe testing
[1:03] positive for Co but she has a lot of the
[1:05] symptoms and sister Celia had been
[1:07] around her and things so we're just just
[1:10] by the grace of God and just feel warned
[1:12] if the Lord to go back to streaming for
[1:15] right now or at least for today we'll
[1:17] see about next week what happens next
[1:20] week but just the extenuating
[1:22] circumstances and the way I'd really had
[1:24] been filming on my heart all week about
[1:25] it we just felt led to try to stay a
[1:29] home for today see what the Lord takes
[1:32] this you know Saints none of us are
[1:35] exempt from this we're still humans were
[1:37] still human bodies were still human
[1:39] people in this world although I believe
[1:41] and know that God has us hedged about I
[1:44] also believe a part of that hedge is
[1:46] God's warning and I believe if God's
[1:48] warning us or God's showing us something
[1:50] is sort of like a prophecy is the way I
[1:53] look at it if you will because you know
[1:55] when brother Branham talked about
[1:57] prophecy he said you know prophecy would
[2:00] come forth to the church and say brother
[2:01] so-and-so don't go on your job tomorrow
[2:03] because the trucks
[2:05] and over you're going to get hurt or
[2:06] killed something like that so that
[2:08] brother would know not to do that not to
[2:10] go to that place so this is kind of that
[2:12] in my opinion the way I look at it
[2:14] there's the Lord's protection I believe
[2:17] the Lord is just saying that you know
[2:19] this is happening that's happening and I
[2:20] believe a part of what the Lord does for
[2:22] us is to warn us and let us know don't
[2:25] go here don't do this and part of that
[2:28] warning is just saying that you know
[2:31] it's helping us stay in the place that
[2:34] we need to be with him now without that
[2:36] warning as we've had the past few weeks
[2:39] we just have regular service and
[2:41] in-person service and enjoyed it very
[2:43] much the Holiday Inn as I've told you
[2:45] Joe very much more speaking to your
[2:48] faces rather than this little camera on
[2:51] the top of my computer screen there but
[2:52] I know you're there at least some of you
[2:55] are there anyway and if you're not there
[2:56] now hopefully you will be there during
[2:58] the week or something you can listen and
[3:00] pick this up again at your convenience
[3:02] but again just fell that because of that
[3:06] because some of the extenuating
[3:08] circumstances and I believe again the
[3:10] warning of the Lord that we just we just
[3:12] stop this because yesterday when a lot
[3:16] of this stuff started evolving my heart
[3:18] and my mind went back to what I felt I
[3:21] kind of felt pulled of the Lord during
[3:24] the week but I wanted to make sure it
[3:26] wasn't just me I wanted to make sure
[3:28] there wasn't just something in me that
[3:29] was saying saying one thing or another
[3:32] but then when the Lord vindicates it
[3:34] then it becomes more real so I believe
[3:37] that is real and that the Lord is still
[3:40] protecting us and watching over us but
[3:43] it is still very real so let's just
[3:46] remember those that have contracted the
[3:49] kovat for several people in Arizona you
[3:54] North Carolina I guess the two states
[3:56] connections I have the most with their
[3:58] in North Carolina and Arizona and around
[4:00] here and brother Ron Peterson and
[4:02] different ones in his church and I know
[4:05] back east for the Hat of night and some
[4:07] of the Tim Hayden several other brothers
[4:09] that I know very personally have
[4:12] contracted it everybody's doing well
[4:14] nobody's I mean they've had difficulties
[4:17] I think whether Ron Peterson had double
[4:18] pneumonia like sister Sergei's in the
[4:21] hospital he says she has two blood clots
[4:24] in her lungs I believe it was double
[4:26] pneumonia but irregardless of the actual
[4:30] circumstances we know that she really
[4:33] needs our prayers and you just continue
[4:35] to remember her in prayer I believe
[4:37] others surrounded town I've heard have
[4:39] contracted it so I'm very thankful that
[4:42] the Lord protection is upon us and even
[4:45] though that may happen that God is still
[4:47] the healer even if you get the flu God
[4:50] still the healer to get cancer God still
[4:53] the healer if you get a tumor or
[4:56] something whatever it is God still the
[4:58] healer so regardless of what this is and
[5:01] what goes on with it
[5:02] I believe God warns us and helps to keep
[5:04] us away from it and protected and
[5:06] provided for and blessed so let's just
[5:09] continue to remember each one if you
[5:11] know them personally if you don't you
[5:14] just pray generally I guess if you don't
[5:17] know anybody else that that has
[5:20] contracted the Lord would just bless
[5:21] them and
[5:22] and touch them and keep them protected
[5:25] state or healing so whichever the
[5:29] situation may be so and please remember
[5:31] brother Zach again he's doing well
[5:34] he just went got tested yesterday I
[5:37] don't believe it is Kovac I think the
[5:41] Lord's protected him from that but
[5:43] anyway just remember them in prayer if
[5:46] you would the golf a touch can help them
[5:48] also got a request from the sister she
[5:51] Leah about her brother Harlan we want to
[5:53] continue to remember him in prayers
[5:54] we've been praying for him continuously
[5:57] now for two or three months or so so
[5:59] remember to pray for him 'yes we
[6:01] mentioned last sunday he had his big
[6:03] case coming up for his big court hearing
[6:06] coming up this past Friday well of
[6:07] course of quote according to the cause
[6:09] of the coma that that got postponed so
[6:13] just remember him in prayer he's still
[6:15] kind of in limbo right now but just
[6:16] trusting somehow this is going to work
[6:18] to come in his favor and that the judge
[6:21] is going to find favor with him but
[6:22] please remember him in prayer also got a
[6:25] request from brother Pat today for his
[6:28] and sister Pat son leave that you would
[6:30] remember him in prayer for a job and the
[6:33] Lord would just leave him and help him
[6:35] get himself back right and on his feet
[6:37] also got every question brother Danny
[6:40] for his boys he asked her brother Danny
[6:44] that they would find the Lord and that
[6:46] God would move on their hearts and that
[6:48] they would accept him into their lives
[6:49] as their Savior and be filled with the
[6:52] Holy Spirit in and move forward with the
[6:54] Lord so I believe that's a great
[6:57] admirable request coming from a Father's
[6:59] heart today
[7:00] so let's remember
[7:01] brother Danny's request I didn't get any
[7:04] others but we obviously want to continue
[7:06] remember brother Dennis wife Leah and
[7:08] prayer Xiu Yin is still a nurse on the
[7:11] front lines and staying protected
[7:14] staying safe and staying well so we're
[7:17] thankful for that and each one of us in
[7:20] the name of the Lord God's been good to
[7:22] us God's blessed us brother Rogers been
[7:25] very busy we're very busy this week and
[7:27] but what we do is mostly secluded it's
[7:30] usually just the two of us but very
[7:33] thankful God's been blessing it's been
[7:35] awful hot but the Lord's been blessing
[7:38] us and I'm so thankful for that but just
[7:40] to remember us in prayer the work we do
[7:43] it's pretty physical and out and they
[7:45] eat a lot of times what God's really
[7:46] been blessing and he sees and making the
[7:49] day's work with the jobs to work were
[7:51] not too much in direct Sun and things
[7:53] like that and that's just really a
[7:54] blessing here America the fire the
[7:56] firefighters and those that are doing
[7:59] what they can to help put that fire out
[8:00] keep it under control and save lives and
[8:04] structures and just just remember the
[8:08] broad worldwide we're all very needy
[8:10] today we know that we're in the last
[8:12] days we don't know how much time we got
[8:14] left but we certainly do know and can
[8:16] see how all this is shaping up to bring
[8:18] it to the point of in pre-tribulation
[8:21] tribulation the time that's coming
[8:25] together now the mark of the beast which
[8:27] survive will be gone for that brace the
[8:28] Lord but see all that shaping up so it's
[8:31] swarming itself we know the image the
[8:34] beast world council church is there but
[8:35] God is mindful of us and he's always
[8:38] with us so I'm very thankful that God
[8:40] blesses us blesses us as a congregation
[8:42] and keeps us healthy strong and provided
[8:46] for us
[8:47] we'll remember these requests and got
[8:49] one the message for you today based off
[8:52] of last week's message a continuation
[8:53] and add on to if you will of last week

[9:35] ourselves because we don't maybe follow

[12:28] ourselves to you and ask your blessings
[12:30] upon us and upon the remaining part of
[12:33] this service as we commit it to you now
[12:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[12:36] pray
[12:37] amen amen god bless you today even if
[12:41] you would turn with me in your Bible to
[12:43] Romans chapter 2 pardon me for a moment
[12:51] then awful drive around Tucson lately
[12:54] ants yes my throat the colorful drive at
[12:56] Romans chapter 2 we're going to begin
[13:00] the scripture reading and we'll just
[13:01] begin with the first verse and read down
[13:03] through the eleventh verse inclusive and
[13:06] just again like a sense and sort of kind
[13:08] of continue the thought we had last week
[13:10] I want to add on to it I sort of left
[13:13] off with you last week because we spoke
[13:15] on respect last week and left off Lord
[13:18] with a left off last week with the
[13:20] understanding that that respect that we
[13:23] have for the Lord leads to an obedience
[13:25] or respect in general leads to an
[13:29] obedience we have respect of an
[13:30] authority figure that it leads to an
[13:33] obedience and and that we have for the
[13:35] Lord and that's the utmost that we look
[13:37] to of course is the respect that we have
[13:38] the Lord Jesus and the obedience that
[13:41] follows that so I want to continue with
[13:44] that and then kind of move into that
[13:46] part of it as well but let's read this
[13:49] romans chapter to begin with verse one
[13:52] here therefore thou art inexcusable old
[13:57] man whosoever thou art that judgest for
[14:01] wherein thou judgest another thou
[14:04] condemn us thy self for thou that judges
[14:07] do us the same thing now that's quite a
[14:10] that's quite a striking scripture
[14:12] because basically what he's telling us
[14:15] is that we're all human Paul's telling
[14:17] the Roman Church here and I believe us
[14:19] of course today that we are all human
[14:21] and you may be judging somebody for a
[14:23] shortcoming or a mistake in their lives
[14:25] but understand as you judge that person
[14:28] for their mistake your mistakes are
[14:30] going to
[14:30] be judged as well because we're all
[14:32] human we all fall make mistakes do
[14:34] things we shouldn't but those things
[14:37] that we condemn now that were judges
[14:39] there is condemned it's not to look upon
[14:41] and say okay we shouldn't be doing this
[14:43] or acting this way that's that's
[14:45] certainly common and we understand it's
[14:48] Christian and then we believe and I
[14:50] believe the Holy Spirit condemns
[14:52] convicts us not condemns but convicts us
[14:54] but this judgment is condemnation the
[14:58] condemnation will be brought on a person
[15:01] to try to make that person feel less
[15:03] than what they really are in Christ or
[15:05] no brother being used to say unchristian
[15:08] eyes them you don't judge a person or
[15:11] condemn a person to the point that it
[15:13] unchristian Isis I've seen so many times
[15:16] ministers even well unchristian eyes
[15:19] people are unchristian eyes their
[15:21] congregation to the point that they it's
[15:23] hard for them to even understand or
[15:24] believe they're even Christians
[15:26] that's the unchristian izing part well
[15:28] that's what he's saying here look we're
[15:30] humans we make mistakes we forgive and
[15:33] we move on we get closer to the Lord and
[15:36] we go we become greater in the eyes of
[15:39] the Lord not that we're perfect or
[15:41] infallible because we're never going to
[15:43] be until this body change never going to
[15:45] be infallible but we also know that we
[15:48] get so close to the Lord that we don't
[15:51] make that mistake anymore or we don't do
[15:53] that thing anymore or we don't go that
[15:55] place anymore we don't talk like that
[15:57] anymore see it's that that God helps us
[16:00] to understand and move past that but
[16:02] that mistake that's been made now this
[16:05] leads to that respect see that mistake
[16:08] that's made we can't look upon that and
[16:10] and condemn that person or make that
[16:13] person think or feel or look even in
[16:15] your eyes it shouldn't even be in your
[16:17] eyes that that person is any less in the
[16:20] eyes of God because that's where it
[16:22] matters the most
[16:23] doesn't matter necessarily in minds but
[16:26] matter in God's eyes so Paul's telling
[16:28] us look we're all humans we all make
[16:31] mistakes we all do things we shouldn't
[16:33] from time to time get caught in traps
[16:34] things I'm gonna read you maybe a quote
[16:37] if we get to that or a little bit later
[16:38] but he's telling us that now kids should
[16:41] not condemn us thy self that thou
[16:44] condemned us thyself I say to judge
[16:46] another condemn another that thou judge
[16:48] yourself or condemned yourself for thou
[16:52] the judges do it the same thing now you
[16:54] might not have been the exact same thing
[16:56] or making the exact same mistake that
[16:58] they made but your mistake is going to
[17:01] still be a mistake and which sin is
[17:04] greater and which sin is lesser unbelief
[17:08] is unbelief
[17:09] so the point she said well his sin was
[17:12] greater than mine well if you made that
[17:15] mistake it was through unbelief you they
[17:17] made that mistake it was through a
[17:18] belief so in God's eyes is there one
[17:22] greater than another well I say no and
[17:24] that's because of the respect God
[17:27] created his creation and he respects it
[17:30] we respect his creation because we
[17:33] respect one another we respect Bakke
[17:36] life respond to respond respect analyze
[17:39] remember last week I talked about
[17:40] brother Brown said you just go kill an
[17:43] animal just to kill it just to let it
[17:44] lay that's murder but if we do it you
[17:47] know because we need food or clothes or
[17:49] things like that that's different story
[17:50] but otherwise it's murder
[17:52] that's that respect see that's there
[17:55] that we have for each other but we are
[17:57] sure that the judgment of God is
[18:00] according to truth against them which
[18:03] commit such things now you're looking at
[18:05] someone who is sinless someone who can
[18:08] look upon our mistakes and judge them
[18:11] based upon his word because he is the
[18:14] ultimate and think it's now this old man
[18:18] that judges them
[18:19] do such things and death the same that
[18:23] thou shalt escape the judgment of God or
[18:27] despise it thou the riches of His
[18:29] goodness and forbearance and
[18:31] longsuffering not knowing that the
[18:32] goodness of God leadeth thee to
[18:35] repentance
[18:35] just as it leached you to a place of
[18:38] repentance that same grace of God leads
[18:41] them to repentance he meant so again
[18:44] we're all in this together we're all in
[18:47] the same boat see
[18:48] but after thy hardness and impendent
[18:50] heart treasures up unto thy self wrath
[18:54] against the day of wrath and revelation
[18:56] of the righteous judgment of God who
[19:00] will render to every man according to
[19:02] his deeds to them who by patient
[19:05] continuance in well doing seek for glory
[19:08] and honor and immortality eternal life
[19:11] but unto them that are contentious and
[19:13] do not obey the truth but obey
[19:15] unrighteousness indignation and wrath
[19:18] tribulation and anguish upon every soul
[19:21] of man that doeth evil of the the Jew
[19:24] first and also of the Gentile but glory
[19:27] honor and peace to every man that
[19:30] worketh good to the to the Jew first and
[19:32] also to the Gentile for there is no
[19:35] respect of persons with God now this is
[19:39] a different type of respect this respect
[19:43] he's talking about isn't a respect of
[19:45] reverence or as we talked about esteem
[19:48] of honor and of someone's feelings it's
[19:53] a different type of respect when the
[19:55] Bible says here that God is no respecter
[19:56] of person that means he doesn't hold
[20:00] anyone higher or in a greater esteem
[20:03] than another if we are all the creation
[20:06] of God then God creates treats his
[20:09] creation this
[20:10] now baki life is Botany life in it is
[20:14] all what it is and the animal life is
[20:16] animal life and eating is all what it is
[20:17] in the human life is human life and it
[20:20] is all what it is where everyone bought
[20:24] with a price if we accept it and that
[20:27] every one of us have a soul in here
[20:29] we're ten million worlds so if that's
[20:32] the case then god doesn't respect one
[20:35] person over the other
[20:37] remember what brother Graham said if God
[20:39] does one thing one way or if he does one
[20:42] thing with one person one way he's got
[20:44] to do it with every person the exact
[20:47] same way every time
[20:49] or he's not God Santa or Saint doesn't
[20:52] matter he's got to treat everyone the
[20:55] exact same way every time
[20:57] if his salvation wasn't for everybody
[21:00] that he's not a just God now not
[21:02] everybody's going to receive it
[21:04] those who do receive it will receive it
[21:06] unto themselves become that but not
[21:08] everybody is going to but he did it for
[21:10] all you go back to the scripture many
[21:13] places it talks about how Jesus did this
[21:16] for all so God doesn't respect or have
[21:19] favor of one person over the other he
[21:22] doesn't have a bias he doesn't show
[21:25] respect a person a lot of times that's
[21:28] the misunderstanding people have
[21:30] especially when they talk about the Dark
[21:32] Ages or we talked about this maybe a
[21:36] month or two ago about about God and the
[21:39] sovereignty of God God does things the
[21:42] way he wants to but he doesn't do things
[21:44] based on bias he doesn't hear one person
[21:47] of cancer and not heal another based on
[21:50] bias he doesn't give one person one
[21:53] thing and not give it to the other
[21:54] person based on bias he doesn't look at
[21:57] one
[21:57] person better greater than the other but
[22:00] what he does do is that when those
[22:02] things appear those things come up then
[22:06] that that receiving of that is what that
[22:09] person will receive in what God is them
[22:11] God's just looking for someone other
[22:13] just taken by his word God's just
[22:16] looking for somebody that will believe
[22:18] in him faith and take him at his word
[22:20] and follow through with it whatever it
[22:22] is whoever it is this I have said many
[22:25] times healing is not for just for the
[22:27] believer or just for the Christian I
[22:30] should say you got to believe it but
[22:32] it's not just for the christian hali
[22:34] I've known atheists to get healed that
[22:38] there's plenty of people in the world
[22:40] today that don't even believe in God or
[22:41] have some other false God and they get
[22:44] healed from sicknesses or diseases or
[22:46] whatever whether they take medicine or
[22:48] some kind of cure some whatever
[22:50] inoculation whatever it is they still
[22:52] have to have faith to believe God's just
[22:55] looking for someone to take him at his
[22:56] word he's that he doesn't do it based on
[22:59] bias these things don't come just
[23:01] because God loves you more than me or
[23:05] respects me more than you he does it
[23:08] based on his foreknowledge and and and
[23:11] those who have faith to believe God
[23:13] knows and understands these things and I
[23:16] believe that's what a lot of what Paul
[23:18] is trying to tell us here God doesn't do
[23:21] it for one person not for another God
[23:24] hasn't forgive you of your sin and not
[23:26] forgive the person you're condemning for
[23:28] their sin no it's not that we're kind of
[23:30] that God's not esteeming that in that
[23:32] one in that way one above another he's
[23:35] not having more respect for one of the
[23:37] other but that respect that he has he
[23:40] has for all of us and and that respect
[23:42] again like we said that we have for one
[23:44] another that's the same one God
[23:49] honors faith God respects faith if you
[23:53] can have faith you can be healed God
[23:58] honors faith that's that's the point
[24:00] that God tries to make is that we are
[24:03] his workmanship
[24:05] I mean humanity and if we can just have
[24:07] faith in Him or if we can just have
[24:09] faith God
[24:10] God can bring about that healing that
[24:12] we're looking for
[24:14] look what brother Graham said here in
[24:18] Queen of Sheba 1958 they saw my Billy
[24:21] Graham's meeting sitting in the White
[24:23] House step singing leaning on the
[24:24] everlasting arms he said but because he
[24:27] believed look at this now because he
[24:29] believed he's no respecter of persons
[24:32] God is no respecter of persons
[24:34] he doesn't esteem one over the other
[24:37] just as real tonight as he was then only
[24:41] thing he's seeking listen us what I want
[24:44] to get only thing he's seeking for is to
[24:46] find someone who will have faith in him
[24:50] amen
[24:51] that's what God is looking for God
[24:53] simply looking for someone they don't
[24:56] have faith in him if we can just have
[24:59] faith in him then God will do what he
[25:02] said he would do because that's what
[25:03] it's based on not based on what he has
[25:06] bias of one person over the other but
[25:09] it's that respect that he has see and
[25:12] the respect that we have for him in that
[25:14] faith you know a lack of faith a lack of
[25:18] respect brings a lack of obedience we
[25:21] talked about that at the end of last
[25:23] week's service a lack of respect will
[25:25] bring a lack of obedience the Lord
[25:29] brought me a thought in here this
[25:30] morning and kind of
[25:33] brought this into a reality of of
[25:35] something that becomes real to me and
[25:38] things you see in the world today such
[25:40] as parents and their children if
[25:43] children don't respect their parents
[25:45] they're not going to obey them now of
[25:47] course there's the street there's this
[25:50] children born in sin shaped iniquity
[25:53] come the world speaking lies things we
[25:55] know that but as that child grows older
[25:58] if that child in that that parent has
[26:01] worked their life around that child to
[26:04] where that child has respect for that
[26:06] parent those parents then that child is
[26:09] going to be more obedient to those
[26:11] parents and those if that child has been
[26:14] raised to not have respect see it's not
[26:18] fear you can't raise children by fear
[26:20] God doesn't raise his children by fear
[26:22] you can't raise your children by fear if
[26:24] you raise your children so that they
[26:26] fear you then you're not going to get
[26:28] their obedience you might get their
[26:31] obedience out of fear because they're
[26:33] afraid afraid of you but when they get
[26:36] older or they grow up it that divulge is
[26:40] into a horrible relationship but but if
[26:43] you but if you can have a way the word
[26:46] that child respects those parents or
[26:48] that parent and then then that respect
[26:51] they're gonna obey based on the fact
[26:53] that the respect that you've garnered
[26:55] from them that you've that you've that
[26:58] you've showed to them and that you
[27:00] respect them and that respect comes then
[27:03] then what that obedience rises to is
[27:05] something that's everlasting their
[27:08] relationship and the respect that
[27:10] that'll that'll be for their rest of
[27:12] their lives because it's respect to
[27:15] obedience not fear to obedience God
[27:17] doesn't want us as we said last week of
[27:20] course the fear that we have of making a
[27:22] mistake or doing something wrong or the
[27:24] reverence that we have but God doesn't
[27:27] rule his children by a fear to say God's
[27:30] gonna send me to hell if I make a
[27:32] mistake
[27:33] that's not the kind of guy he is he
[27:35] doesn't work that way that's why we love
[27:37] him and respect him so because we've
[27:39] come to understand what he does and how
[27:41] much he means to us in that respect and
[27:44] so the obedience is just there we obey
[27:47] Him because we want to not because we're
[27:49] scared of him we obey Him because we
[27:51] love it not because we're scared of him
[27:54] amen so that obedience divulges are
[27:57] devolves into that respect into that
[28:00] obedience so that we have obedience and
[28:04] and that we trust the Lord because he's
[28:06] always there for us
[28:09] respects 1961 October 1961 though they
[28:16] pat you on the back and call you brother
[28:19] yet you know they don't believe it see
[28:22] they don't believe it and you can have
[28:24] no one know one thing you can do for
[28:28] them they'll call for you to come pray
[28:30] but it doesn't do them any good because
[28:33] you see they disrespect it they
[28:37] disrespect it they don't have faith in
[28:39] it they don't have faith to believe this
[28:41] he he says you could call that they can
[28:44] call you to come and pray because
[28:46] they've seen the results you've seen the
[28:48] gift of God they seemed the the miracles
[28:51] and the working of God and in others but
[28:54] they don't respect it themselves that
[28:56] you have to respect it yourself before
[28:58] you can receive it and see and even
[29:01] though he would go he said I would go
[29:02] pray it doesn't do them any good cuz
[29:06] they disrespected you've got to believe
[29:09] it see you see how now he eat couples
[29:13] the two together you see how he couples
[29:17] the respect and faith
[29:18] together he said they disrespected that
[29:21] he said you've got to believe it what
[29:24] does that belief that means you have to
[29:25] have faith that faith is showing a
[29:28] respect bit of the one who give it and
[29:30] that's God and God giveth the gifts God
[29:34] give us the understanding that when
[29:36] someone like that and brings that
[29:38] reverence or that respect like the gift
[29:41] that was in brother branham's life that
[29:43] people revered it people respected it
[29:45] now some people go too far calling
[29:48] something and try to make him something
[29:50] he's not in just a man but it's the gift
[29:52] a man was that gift that we respect
[29:55] because the gift is from God not brother
[29:57] branham but from God and we love the man
[29:59] of course but it was that gift that he's
[30:02] talking about the people disrespected
[30:04] they disrespected who knows why but they
[30:08] just don't believe it see you have to
[30:10] watch he said now those who believe and
[30:12] if you believe it you can see what
[30:14] happens you see what happens it brings
[30:17] obedience influence in Chicago 1963
[30:21] October excuse me August 1963 I wonder
[30:25] my brother I wonder my sister if we'll
[30:27] take a look at that when holy angels
[30:31] listening to a mother respected you know
[30:34] respect obedience when holy angels has
[30:38] to cover their face to stand in the
[30:40] presence of God in reverence and in
[30:43] respect
[30:44] amen god help us those you know those
[30:48] chairmen say they're two wings flying
[30:51] two wings over their face two wings over
[30:52] their feet in respect crying holy holy
[30:55] holy Lord God Almighty as we would say
[30:58] there's no time over there but as we
[31:00] would say 24/7 365 366 in leap year
[31:04] there there's crying holy holy Lord God
[31:07] Almighty he's talking about those angels
[31:10] covering their face in the presence of
[31:12] God in reverence and respect
[31:14] but today we find people who call
[31:17] themselves Christians and has no respect
[31:20] at all for God you know why says that
[31:23] because people even call themselves
[31:26] Christians act contrary to God's Word
[31:30] you had contrary to God's Word that
[31:33] shows you don't respect it and if you
[31:36] don't respect this word you don't
[31:38] respect God and that he says these that
[31:41] people who even call themselves
[31:42] Christians they have no respect at all
[31:45] for God or his word or his people or his
[31:48] ministry or nothing they have no respect
[31:51] if you don't have respect for me I don't
[31:54] have respect for you
[31:55] we don't have respect for his word we
[31:57] don't have respect for God we don't
[31:59] respect God we don't respect the man of
[32:01] God wouldn't respect the gift of God
[32:03] then what are gonna be the results
[32:05] there's no obedience there you don't
[32:08] respect God's Word why are you gonna
[32:09] obey it
[32:10] people don't obey it because they don't
[32:12] believe it they don't respect it there's
[32:14] no faith there and if you find even that
[32:17] even that people call themselves
[32:19] Christian call themselves Christian
[32:21] leaving the the Bible daily they don't
[32:26] follow the Bible anymore some of them
[32:28] not all of them not probably not even
[32:30] the majority but there are a facet of
[32:32] people today college those Christians
[32:34] don't even call by the Bible they might
[32:37] go by their own words or their own song
[32:39] or interpretation of what they think it
[32:41] might say or mean they might chalk the
[32:43] Old Testament out or they might take
[32:45] this little part and chop it out and you
[32:47] know you you you Bible starts looking
[32:49] like Swiss cheese because you've taken
[32:51] out so much of it well friend if we
[32:53] don't look into this as God's Holy Word
[32:56] and respected as such there's no gonna
[32:58] be any obedience there
[33:00] there's no reverence there there's
[33:02] nothing to then and if there's no
[33:03] reverence their eyes they're going to be
[33:05] any better but thankfully we still serve
[33:08] a living God that still has respect for
[33:10] humans human life and and and us as a
[33:14] whole but there's people that don't
[33:17] respect God don't respect his word don't
[33:20] respect his people don't respect his
[33:23] ministry or nothing where they are going
[33:26] to come up at in the resurrection when
[33:28] the Bible says the if the righteous
[33:30] scarcely be saved
[33:32] where were the center and the ungodly
[33:34] appears that's a sad thing to think
[33:36] about but that's exactly where a lot of
[33:39] people are today that the rights of
[33:41] Bible says if the righteous fiercely be
[33:43] safe were to the center and the ungodly
[33:45] appear if the child does not have
[33:47] respect for the parent where's that
[33:49] child going to end up maybe sometimes
[33:52] maybe that they'll find favor that that
[33:55] that young personal growth to be
[33:57] successful good but no almost the cases
[33:59] that's not that's not the case it
[34:01] doesn't happen that way a lot of times
[34:03] that person will become someone that if
[34:06] they had disrespect for their parent is
[34:08] going to have respect for the law and
[34:10] you see a lot of that today in this
[34:12] country people who have an intense
[34:15] disrespect for the law they talk about
[34:17] reforming the police I think what they
[34:19] need to reform is people's attitudes if
[34:22] people would quit resisting then a lot
[34:24] of this would change not all of it not
[34:26] saying that they're all good but not
[34:28] everybody not not all of any group is
[34:31] good but not all of any group is fact
[34:34] see I think the majority of most argue I
[34:37] think the majority of most police are
[34:41] good I think majority of most people of
[34:44] color is good most
[34:46] people's good that's just that's just
[34:48] the way I feel about now you get some of
[34:50] the ones that aren't and then of course
[34:52] it sounds like they've become the
[34:55] sounding board for the entire race and
[34:57] it's not that way but you have to have
[35:02] respect see if if there's no respect
[35:04] there there's no obedience well if
[35:06] there's not a home there's not with the
[35:08] parents and they have been able to do it
[35:09] then what's gonna happen in school
[35:11] notice no respect for the teachers and
[35:13] then they get in trouble at school and
[35:17] then they get in trouble or they end up
[35:19] on the street or disrespect for
[35:21] authority figures police or whatnot and
[35:24] then what kind of an individual is being
[35:27] raised now it's sad but that's where it
[35:30] begins and and that's where it leads to
[35:33] but unfortunately we see a lot of that
[35:37] in the world today let's look over in
[35:43] James we read this last week on it I
[35:46] want to just go through this real quick
[35:47] again James chapter 2 verse 1 and I want
[35:51] to read through this scripture once
[35:52] again as we did last week the James
[35:54] chapter 2 verse 1 says my brother have
[35:56] not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:58] the Lord of glory with respect of
[36:01] persons amen
[36:03] remember we talked about that last week
[36:04] we as God are not to look and esteem any
[36:09] person above the other esteem any person
[36:13] better than another we should always
[36:16] look at that person whether whether they
[36:19] be friend or foe as as a soul that's
[36:22] worth 10 million worlds and if we don't
[36:25] in our heart have respect for that
[36:27] person you cannot help that person and
[36:31] again like I said last week you're not
[36:32] even going to want to help that person
[36:34] if you don't respect them like you're
[36:36] supposed to you're going to respect that
[36:39] person to the place that they're a human
[36:41] being with a soul worth 10 million
[36:42] worlds what happens what what is there
[36:45] an accounting of God if you are able to
[36:49] lay hands on or talk to or witness to
[36:52] someone a foe or whoever to take that
[36:56] soul worth 10 million worlds and pull it
[36:59] out of the pits of Hell and put it in
[37:01] glory now that's not our ability but God
[37:04] uses us to do those things God helps us
[37:07] to be able to speak to those and help
[37:09] those people so that they come from a
[37:11] place that they're that shouldn't be up
[37:15] to a place where where they could spend
[37:18] eternity with us with the Lord my
[37:21] there's there's no greater thing that
[37:24] you can imagine or think about there's
[37:26] not there's no amount of money
[37:28] there's no possessions you could obtain
[37:30] people but build hospitals they spend
[37:35] billions of dollars on hospitals and on
[37:38] educational programs on reforming people
[37:41] and changing all of just trying to
[37:43] change Satan's eating the mold and be
[37:45] fitted around us there's no changing
[37:47] that but what we can do
[37:49] I mean billions of dollars but there's
[37:51] no amount of money you can apply to one
[37:54] soul that you've been able to lead out
[37:57] of the pits of hell into the kingdom of
[37:59] God
[38:00] no amount of money nor mount of
[38:02] possessions I don't care how much Warren
[38:04] Buffett Bill Gates or Bezos puts towards
[38:07] all these other programs and things
[38:09] they're just trying to reform something
[38:11] that's gonna burn over and rot one day
[38:14] I'm thinking about the soul that's
[38:16] eternal that that that that would be
[38:19] before the Lord amen that's what matters
[38:23] the most
[38:24] not one over the other but that but that
[38:27] respect that we have of each one for if
[38:30] there come unto you unto your assembly a
[38:34] man with a gold ring and goodly a pair
[38:36] on there come any also a poor man
[38:39] environment and you have respecting him
[38:41] that we're at the gate clothing and sand
[38:43] to him sit down here in a good place say
[38:45] that the poor stand out there or sit
[38:47] here under my foot store you not then
[38:49] partial in yourselves and our become
[38:52] judges of evil thoughts hearken my
[38:54] beloved brethren have not God chosen the
[38:57] poor of this world rich in faith and
[38:59] heirs of the kingdom which he had
[39:01] promised to them that love him but ye
[39:04] have despised the poor do not the rich
[39:08] men oppress you and draw you before the
[39:10] judgment seats and those with people to
[39:12] get the greatest accolades
[39:15] it's sad to think because a person can
[39:18] dribble a basketball better than another
[39:20] person and make millions of dollars
[39:22] because they can do it that we should
[39:25] listen to them over someone else that
[39:28] makes them more important because
[39:30] someone can remember some lines and and
[39:32] and act like they're a person that
[39:34] they're not and people film them and
[39:36] like to watch it and that's all fine and
[39:38] good whatever entertainment but why does
[39:41] that make them a spokesperson that makes
[39:43] them someone that we as a society should
[39:45] listen to with moralities and ethics
[39:50] it's just sad that has come to that
[39:52] place and there would be the first ones
[39:54] to look down upon you for living the way
[39:58] you think by your own dictates in the
[40:00] Word of God it's sad
[40:05] do not leave blaspheme that worthy name
[40:08] about which ye are called
[40:10] if you fulfill the royal law according
[40:12] to the scripture thou shalt love thy
[40:14] neighbor as thyself you do well but if
[40:17] you have respect a person you commit sin
[40:19] and are convinced that the law are
[40:21] convinced of the law of transgressors
[40:23] for whosoever shall keep the whole law
[40:26] and yet offend in one point is guilty of
[40:28] all for he that said do not commit
[40:31] adultery said also do not kill now if
[40:34] thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill
[40:37] there are becoming transgressor of the
[40:39] law but God has made us of no respecter
[40:43] of person to obey the law to obey the
[40:47] word to stand upon the word and live it
[40:50] the way he calls us to live look at this
[40:54] read a couple of things here as we move
[40:57] on now patriarch Abraham 1964 now
[41:04] Abraham was just an ordinary man it
[41:05] wasn't something special I never called
[41:07] him as far as we can have any record
[41:09] till he was 75 years old his wife
[41:12] half-sister being 65 years old at the
[41:15] time that probably lived together since
[41:16] they were very young she Sarah barring
[41:19] having no children God called a complete
[41:21] separation to separate himself from the
[41:24] rest of the world and from all the
[41:25] people and from all his kindred there
[41:28] was a special thing for him to do and
[41:30] when God expects you to do a special
[41:31] thing he demands a complete separation
[41:35] from any doubt you've got to come to
[41:38] full obedience to obey what he
[41:41] as God commands it God demands it you
[41:46] can't do it any other way
[41:48] it's got to be done according to God's
[41:50] Way I see that's a lot of times the
[41:52] things that we have especially when we
[41:55] like hold someone in higher esteem than
[41:59] another person there's someone we put up
[42:01] on a pedestal or someone that we think
[42:04] of more than we do another but you know
[42:06] God calls your local minister your local
[42:09] pastor to pray for you lay hands on you
[42:12] whatever just as much as brother Brandon
[42:14] was but a lot of times I've heard people
[42:17] even in the message tell me nothing
[42:20] lately but years ago oh if only brother
[42:23] Branham are here well that's all well it
[42:27] good but the god of brother bounds here
[42:29] if brother baton was here God wasn't he
[42:32] could don't do no more the need and the
[42:34] rest of us can do but when God's here
[42:36] that's what changes the scene God give
[42:39] authority to the local minister the
[42:42] minister called by God or anyone if you
[42:45] will to pray for you as much as brother
[42:48] Branham was it's your faith it's your
[42:51] faith to believe it look he said you
[42:52] come to full of babies to obey what he
[42:55] says see God demands that it can't come
[42:59] with devout with any doubt it's got to
[43:02] be with faith and understanding God's
[43:04] Word and believing God's Worth and
[43:06] Holdings God's Word is reverence
[43:09] trust because it's God doing it we have
[43:13] as much right to vote to pray for one
[43:16] another
[43:17] as brother random or anybody now I know
[43:20] there's separate gifts
[43:22] there's gifts of healings and there's
[43:24] different gifts of helps and and
[43:27] prophesy things I know there's gifts and
[43:30] gifts of healings and thing but that
[43:33] shouldn't change our faith that that
[43:35] should have an effect on our faith our
[43:37] faith should be there regardless say
[43:39] brother sister pray for me appreciate
[43:41] our sisters in our church have their
[43:43] prayer chain that they have and they
[43:45] text one another all the time and how
[43:47] much even more important it is when
[43:49] they're not able to get together like
[43:50] you used to and have your lunch every
[43:53] month or something like that you're not
[43:55] able to do that really now although I
[43:58] encourage if you could but not able to
[44:00] do that to have that connection and
[44:02] that's just such a wonderful thing
[44:04] because you believe one another you
[44:06] respect one another you have that faith
[44:08] then if that sister those sisters pray
[44:11] for you they tell the brothers and that
[44:13] we pray and we all pray together it's
[44:15] gonna bring results and it has it has
[44:18] brought results how many times could we
[44:21] say we don't list them we don't write it
[44:23] now but how many times could we come
[44:26] together and remember just in the four
[44:28] years we've been assembled as a
[44:30] congregation that we remember the
[44:32] miracles the workings of God the things
[44:35] that God has done just for our little
[44:37] group just because of faith just because
[44:39] of believe me just because you love one
[44:41] another respect one another and revere
[44:43] whole one another up enough to know that
[44:45] if they pray for you you're going to be
[44:47] healed God's gonna move on the scene
[44:50] God's gonna touch the situation that's
[44:52] not all the same because that's what
[44:55] that that's who God is no respecter of
[44:57] person stuff based on bias but it's
[44:59] foreknowledge but we know that it moves
[45:01] the hand of God
[45:02] because you have respect for one another
[45:05] you have respect for God is work you
[45:07] obey his work we stand in obedience of
[45:11] his work just like Jesus you know
[45:14] Hebrews says that though he were a son
[45:17] yet he learned obedience through the
[45:20] things which he suffered why can you
[45:22] imagine just through the things he
[45:24] suffered learned obedience
[45:26] well that learned obedience was taught
[45:28] to us because it's the life of Jesus you
[45:31] don't see Jesus in every scripture you
[45:33] need to go back and read it because he's
[45:35] in here every scripture every line
[45:38] there's Christ because Christ is the
[45:40] word and then that word is where he
[45:43] dwells because it is him not this actual
[45:46] book although there's respect for this
[45:49] book for numerous cases places burned
[45:51] down in the Bible not burner or flood
[45:53] and the Bible be fine things like that
[45:55] like even a brand tavern act when the
[45:57] flood came and the Bible's Tamblyn up
[45:59] the Bible on it just like that came went
[46:01] right straight up okay right back now
[46:02] it's perfect the way it was just so
[46:06] they're there it is God respects that
[46:09] but it's not necessarily just in this
[46:10] book but it's in your heart that word is
[46:13] here by respect but he yet learned
[46:16] obedience to the things which he
[46:18] suffered I mean you think about you go
[46:20] back to Romans Romans says that because
[46:22] of one man's disobedience we fell into
[46:25] this Satan's Eden that's where we live
[46:28] today because of one man's disobedience
[46:30] now we know why he did it
[46:32] but regardless he transgressed the word
[46:35] and because he transgressed the word all
[46:38] humanity fell into the place we're at
[46:40] today just like living as we are in
[46:43] Satan's Eden by one man's disobedience
[46:45] but by one man's obedience Christ came
[46:49] and changed all of it now we've yet to
[46:51] receive the full benefits of that we're
[46:53] still living in Satan's Eden but we and
[46:56] ourselves have received it
[46:58] because we can witness to it because
[47:00] it's become a part of us we love it it's
[47:03] a part of our life we reverence it we
[47:06] obey it because it's a part of who we
[47:08] are we live it because we want to live
[47:11] it we obey it because we love Him
[47:14] because of the respect that we have for
[47:16] him
[47:17] that doesn't change but the thing that
[47:19] does change is our humanity and our
[47:22] ability to love someone or to respect
[47:25] someone or revere someone over the other
[47:28] or not that's that that's the respect or
[47:31] not respecter of persons that we have
[47:34] thirsty for life I'm going to read these
[47:36] couple more quotes we'll close your just
[47:38] a little bit amen but trust the Lord
[47:42] bless you today thirsty for life Dallas
[47:44] Texas 1958 he said what we need tonight
[47:48] is not an arguing look this is so
[47:52] prevalent god help us god help us as
[47:54] humans but what we need tonight is not
[47:57] an arguing on a little pre but what we
[48:00] need tonight is the Holy Ghost and fire
[48:04] old-fashioned powers of God to burn sin
[48:07] and selflessness disrespect for each
[48:10] other burn it out of us with the love of
[48:14] God amen the love of God burns out the
[48:19] disrespect for each other that that burn
[48:23] out that old selfishness and that old
[48:26] self-centeredness the disrespect that we
[48:29] have for each other running out with the
[48:31] love of God the power of the Holy Ghost
[48:35] old-fashioned power of God moving into
[48:37] our hearts into our lives God burn out
[48:39] any disrespect that I have for someone
[48:42] else burn out any nature in here that is
[48:46] unlike you Lord and let it just be the
[48:49] pure love of God flowing that I had the
[48:51] same respect
[48:52] now that respect comes responsibility
[48:55] that obedience comes with the
[48:56] responsibility amen
[48:58] comes with the responsibility of being
[49:00] led of his Spirit you don't just do it
[49:03] because you feel you know it's just it's
[49:05] just you're doing something but you do
[49:07] it because it's in your heart to do that
[49:09] God's leading me to do it
[49:10] amen praise the Lord God help burn that
[49:15] out of us burn that'll nature out God's
[49:19] gifts always find its place even if we
[49:21] can disagree excuse me this is in
[49:24] Jeffersonville 1963 even if we can
[49:27] disagree with a person if we can't yet
[49:30] do it in a brotherly way disagree amen
[49:33] remember above and so we're not just
[49:35] we're not here to just fuss and argue
[49:37] about some creed or some doctrine or
[49:39] something we're here to love one another
[49:41] to let the power of God come and burn
[49:44] out that disagreement burn out that old
[49:47] disrespect for one another we can even
[49:51] disagree with the person if we can't yet
[49:54] do it in a brotherly way see if Christ
[49:57] is in the heart then no matter how much
[50:00] you disagree with a man you still got
[50:02] love for him and respect amen
[50:07] love and respect I disagree with many
[50:12] men many times but still I've never seen
[50:15] one yeah I disagree with that I ever
[50:18] thought of anymore then put my arm
[50:21] around him and call him my brother try
[50:24] to help him the best I could and people
[50:27] he would say they either buy that gift
[50:30] they'd hug him if they had a knife that
[50:32] stabbed him in the back but yet his
[50:34] attitude was if there's something I
[50:36] could do for that brother any way that I
[50:38] can help that brother be there for them
[50:40] I would do it
[50:41] see it's not to have respect of one
[50:44] person over the other because he knew
[50:46] these people they would disagree of
[50:48] course we got disagreements with humans
[50:50] I disagree with myself sometimes I've
[50:53] told you that many times I'll do
[50:56] something to look at and say what in the
[50:58] world Newton why in the world you do
[50:59] that that didn't make any sense no but
[51:02] that was stupid or probably not a right
[51:05] word to say but that you know that's
[51:06] just how I feel sometimes I think that
[51:08] just wasn't a smart thing to do I
[51:10] disagree with myself sometimes no doubt
[51:14] we're all human you do too so if we
[51:17] disagree with one another you gonna
[51:18] think less yourself you don't think less
[51:20] yourself you shouldn't think less of one
[51:22] another is that I disagree with my
[51:24] disagree more I thought maybe less of
[51:28] that person see that's when you know
[51:30] you've got the love of God when you can
[51:32] disagree bitterly disagree and have the
[51:35] same feeling look not this is a
[51:37] different quote but have the same
[51:39] feeling toward that person as Christ
[51:42] would see then you've got something you
[51:46] can bitterly disagree bitterly dummy for
[51:49] one side to the other as hard as you can
[51:51] bitterly disagree
[51:53] but had the same feeling when it's all
[51:55] done
[51:56] had the same feeling toward that person
[51:58] as Christ would and how did Christ feel
[52:01] well he died and gave his life for that
[52:03] person so how about us how do we feel
[52:06] then that weight towards one another we
[52:10] still got love and respect for him I
[52:13] disagree with him because that I think
[52:15] maybe that upon disagreeing what he
[52:19] believes that I might not believe just
[52:21] like him and so forth but now I might
[52:23] try to project my way to him as he
[52:25] projects his way to me and get them
[52:27] closer and comb them out and see what we
[52:29] got
[52:30] but disagreement like that just as far
[52:32] as it comes to we should never get angry
[52:35] or want to hurt or destroy anyone or
[52:38] anything we should always be trying to
[52:42] build up build that person up help that
[52:45] person encourage that person be there as
[52:48] it was said for that person Amen just
[52:52] two more here I'll close token this is
[52:54] the one in Jeffersonville 1963 he says
[52:57] you should love one another believers
[53:00] should separate themselves from the
[53:01] world don't just take it now lightly and
[53:04] now the people that's listening on this
[53:06] streaming that's not what he said so
[53:10] what I'm saying
[53:11] you may man you men you listen a minute
[53:13] you ever believe me you believe it now
[53:16] it's time to quit fussing with one
[53:18] another believe the message of the Bible
[53:20] believe Jesus Christ and love and honor
[53:22] and respect one another men respect your
[53:25] wives you respect your home bring your
[53:28] home together oh listen I read that
[53:30] again that's just wonderful
[53:32] that's pure gold to me men respect your
[53:36] wives you respect your home that would
[53:39] be your children to respect your home
[53:42] bring your home
[53:43] gather amen together in respect not fear
[53:47] in respect bring her home together
[53:50] because you remember this lamb we talked
[53:53] about of course Nexus this lamb the
[53:56] Paschal Lamb was for the home not just
[53:59] for one person that lamb that sacrifice
[54:03] had came for the entire house everyone
[54:06] that was in that dwelling that's who the
[54:08] lamb was formed that Paschal Lamb of the
[54:10] blood was supply was for everyone in
[54:12] that home you respect your wives you
[54:15] respect your home your children the
[54:19] whole home too had to be brought
[54:20] everything had to be brought in we
[54:22] should love one another and believers
[54:24] should separate themselves the world
[54:25] notice they were not just come together
[54:29] to talk about the message they come
[54:31] together to apply the blood to apply the
[54:34] token that's what we you us must do amen
[54:40] that's what we must do apply the token
[54:42] let that word have its preeminence in us
[54:47] one more it's all Kalihi respects this
[54:50] is 1961 again from respect soul God and
[54:54] I brother Brown spurning oh god what
[54:57] love that Paul had he said he would

[55:25] Romans chapter 2 Paul trying to
[55:28] together in the understanding we're all
[55:29] human we all make mistakes now brother

[55:34] first we started with Paul and finished
[55:37] it up with brother brown he says that
[55:40] give us give us that undying love that
[55:45] decency that respect for one another to
[55:48] be Christian enough to look over each
[55:51] other's mistakes god help us because a
[55:55] man has has been blessed of God he might
[55:59] make a mistake old father let us not
[56:01] look at that mistake
[56:03] knowing that that's a precious brother
[56:05] that maybe Satan did in a trap or
[56:08] trapped him into something but if he did
[56:11] we pray Lord that you'll help him help
[56:14] he or she out of that place that we'll
[56:17] have love in our hearts to go after the
[56:20] lost sheep and bring them back to the
[56:21] fold
[56:22] grant Lord forgive us our trespasses as
[56:25] we forgive those that have trespassed
[56:26] against us
[56:27] granite Lord lead us not temptation
[56:30] deliver us for evil from evil for thine
[56:32] is the kingdom the power the glory
[56:33] forever amen
[56:36] that faith that respect that obedience
[56:41] that love for one another all they made
[56:44] a mistake haven't you
[56:47] haven't we all Oh some make more
[56:49] mistakes and others pray for me
[56:51] maybe you're closer to God than they are
[56:54] maybe you're more Revelator than they
[56:56] are god help us all
[56:58] we can't be Aryan Saints we can't think
[57:01] of ourselves better more important than
[57:04] anybody else than any other Christian or
[57:07] any other believer we can't look down on
[57:10] the mistakes said Oh while he was wrong
[57:13] well let help give him the chance to
[57:16] make that wrong right help pray for him
[57:18] don't put him down don't kick him out
[57:20] don't take her and slander her name
[57:23] across the across the spectrum of
[57:26] Facebook or social media gives a chance
[57:31] does the mistakes that you've pulled out
[57:33] from them of the mistakes is going to be
[57:36] pulled out from you you don't want
[57:38] George being in the forefront
[57:40] you don't want yours blasted across some
[57:43] social media amen but love one another
[57:46] respect one another the blood of Jesus
[57:50] Christ is there to take care of those
[57:51] things and to take care of all of the
[57:54] the the wrong that comes from us as
[57:58] humana as humans and humanity but stand
[58:01] together in faith and love and believing
[58:04] I believe that's what the prayer does -
[58:06] the prayer faith state to see as we
[58:09] stand together some brothers and sisters
[58:10] in this cause and the cause is for
[58:13] Christ this cost for Christ that we have
[58:16] should bring us and join us together
[58:18] greater and more than it ever has in
[58:20] this last day sure I could come to you
[58:23] today with some great Revelation message
[58:25] friend
[58:26] I could have pulled something to you
[58:27] from the seals or and all those things
[58:30] are pertinent and needful and we will it
[58:32] a dividend the later time but friend how
[58:35] greater is that we can have all the
[58:38] revelations and know all the mysteries
[58:39] and yet not love each other
[58:41] Paul says you have nothing then you
[58:44] could understand this and you can
[58:46] understand that you can have a complete
[58:48] understanding of revelation 10 and
[58:50] what's attraction on the mountain and
[58:52] completely miss the love of God and
[58:54] respect for one another friend had that
[58:56] respect don't look at each other
[59:00] differently I guess you'd say just have
[59:03] that respect that obedience of God his
[59:05] word and stand upon that we have it for
[59:08] the Lord he has it for us as we love one
[59:13] another is how we love the Lord and they
[59:15] stand upon that and believe it forgive
[59:18] be forgiven pray for one another of hope
[59:22] hold one another and we trust it will
[59:25] all be healed believe again as I've said
[59:27] earlier that this that God keeps us
[59:32] hedged and keeps us hedged about and the
[59:35] god protects us and watches over us in
[59:38] his service and the god heals those that
[59:42] may have contracted the disease or
[59:45] affliction of some kind covetous one
[59:47] thing I mean that's just the word that's
[59:49] on a tip of everybody's tongue today but
[59:52] just because Kovac showed up doesn't
[59:54] mean that flu is not here or the common
[59:56] cold is not here or the cancer is not
[59:59] here or the polio or whatever
[1:00:02] for other diseases and afflictions are
[1:00:03] still around people are still meeting of
[1:00:07] other afflictions in their bodies and
[1:00:10] diseases in their in their bodies those
[1:00:14] things are just as pertinent and all
[1:00:17] those things we remember when we trust
[1:00:19] God there's many things going on today
[1:00:22] and prayer requests we had that had
[1:00:24] nothing to do with Kovac
[1:00:26] we got a mouth on fire over here sister
[1:00:30] she Leah's brother and things had
[1:00:32] nothing to do with Kovac but we're
[1:00:34] believing that God's going to move on it
[1:00:36] nevertheless we're not gonna pray for it
[1:00:38] any less or anymore than we would
[1:00:40] anything else or any other need but we
[1:00:43] believe that God is going to direct us
[1:00:45] and help us and that we hold each one
