we already have our book built praise the Lord anyway amen but I'm thankful to be here and the songs we were singing was all about having faith and believing that God is more than able we talked about Jehovah Rafa and sha and he's all of these things but see that has to become a reality it amen can't be more than just a song yes it's just a song do you know good right but if you have the real the revelation of who he is and really what he is and what he plans to do for us amen that's what makes it difference yes while you're standing if youd open your Bibles to Hebrews the 11th chapter we'll read verse 11 verse 6 and the subject matter is it's it's faith and trust yes and they kind of go hand in hand one develops into the other one yes very true Hebrews 11 and6 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is yes and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek Him amen and let's just pray Heavenly Father we have gathered together this morning to Worship You To Praise You Lord you're worthy of all praise because of who you are and Lord as we gather together we realize what we are because of you yes Lord that's what gives us the faith to believe the things told us through your word thank you Jesus Lord take me as your vessel this morning I pray and move me aside and use me you've given me a thought Lord and just help me Lord to deliver that which you placed upon my heart I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen be seated as I've gone through the scriptures i' I've noticed that God deals with different people people in different ways because people are obviously individuals and and the way that he deals with them he has to get them in a situation Lord he can actually speak to them and the first one that I chose to to look at is is Jacob and Jacob to me is rather interesting character he I mean to him God was the god of his father I'm sure his father had told him all about the Miracles and the promises of God and and he could watch how God had provided for his father and all these other wonderful things yes but yet to Jacob God was the god of his father he had heard about him but he didn't know him and then we go down and we we we realize what Jacob had done to his brother Esau he had stolen the birthright and he had he had stolen from him all the other things which should have fallen to Esau and Esau set out he was going to kill Jacob right just out of anger and stuff and and then his mother came to to to to Jacob and says he you know your your your your brother is not very pleased with you and then you need to kind of separate yourself a little while until it cools down so she said why don't you go and visit with with her with her with her her dad up in Heron and he took the advice went to his dad dad gave the permission so he began his journey out of Palestine and there he it got to be evening time so he laid down to get some sleep and all of a sudden the Bible says says all of a sudden God appeared to Jacob as he laid there it says and behold the Lord stood above it and and God spoke to Jacob and said I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and the god of Isaac and the land wherein thou liest I will give to thee and to thy seed thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west to the East and North and the South behold I am with thee and I will keep thee and all all these places whether thou goest and I will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of so God here appeared unto Jacob and he made a promise to him yes he says and and and this is in spite of Jacob God made the promise sovereignly to Jacob yes it wasn't Jacob had to do anything this was a sovereign promise from God to Jacob yes right and anyway so Jacob went on and he began to he went up to to Heron he he married um one one of his anyway he married one of the ladies that wasn't the one he wanted so he had to wait seven more days or years or whatever it was finally he get the other one and then he started having kids and I noticed between his two wives there was always arguments between the two who's going to have have relations with him that evening and stuff and so there's always this conflict within this house always his conflict yeah and then Jacob he would take care of his his father-in-law's shape and goats and cattle and whatever else and Jacob or Jacob's father-in-law began to change the stipulations you know you stay with me so long and we'll do this and we'll do that and we'll do this and we'll do that and finally Jacob realized after a while that his father-in-law really wasn't too pleased with him and that's when God spoke un Jacob and says it's time for you to head back home right so Jacob he began he he separated his flocks and his herds from his father-in-law's and then he began his journey his father-in-law decided to follow after him and began you know he was going to chastise him and who knows what and God spoke into under his father-in-law and says you be careful how you speak to Jacob you don't be good or bad to him you just behave yourself so to speak yeah but Jacob heard that Esau was coming with a band not just Jacob by himself to G him and say hey welcome your home right no no he was Jacob wasn't sure exactly what his brother had in mind with him and so he separated his F herds in the sheap from different he put them in different um anyway he separated him so they journeyed separately then he separated his kids and his wives and he sent them ahead hoping that all of this stuff that he had sent ahead of him you know with AAS with a peas Esau but it came to the place where Jacob began to realize that he was going to face his brother and he was afraid for his life yeah and and and Jacob God Jacob vow Jacob vowed vow saying God if you and Jacob when he when when Jacob F first met God he says Jacob out about and saying if God will be with me and will keep me in the way that I go and will give me bread to eat and remant to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God yeah in other words God you have to make you made a promise to me and if you keep it okay then I'll let you be my God uhhuh but it wasn't until Jacob all of a sudden God sent down to the place where he was Afra for his life yeah amen and then Jacob called unto the God and says in Genesis 32 Jacob said oh go oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac he was still God of his his parents he said the Lord which sayith unto me return to the country to thy Kindred he said I am not he goes on AR worthy for the least of all your mercies and all the truth that thou has showed unto thy servant he said deliver me I pray thee for the hand of my brother and the Hand of Esau because you said you and he and Jacob reminded God of his promise he said thou sayest I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea right amen so then Jacob went be Jacob went and he be he tried to rest that evening because he knew that the following day Esau was going to be there and so Jacob was rest was left alone and there wrestled of ad with him until the breaking of the the day when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint and he as he wrestled with him and God spoke and and and God said unto him what's your name he said well it's Jacob and Jacob means deceiver and he was yeah right he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men has prevailed Jacob asked and said tell me I pray thee thy name he said wherefore is it that thou would asked my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place P for I have seen God face to face my life was preserved you know as I looked at Jacob and I began to realize God had made a promise to Jacob you come to church begin you know even as a sinner you come to church and and you begin to hear about this God begin to hear this God oh yeah we know God heals oh we know God protects and we know God provides and God does all these things and a lot of people when they come to a relationship with God they says well you know Lord we read in your word all these wonderful promises yeah well Lord if you will do this for me then I will accept you then I will let you be my God then I will follow you then I will do this and a lots of times God does what you've asked but then you forget the promise you made to him but see it comes this is how a lot of people start out but see it wasn't it wasn't until Jacob wrestled with God it wasn't until Jacob got to the place in his life where he wasn't sure of what tomorrow would bring yeah that all of a sudden he God then became a reality to them right and until God becomes a reality to us it's just a bunch of words sure even if God fulfills him well it could have been this circumstance well it could have been that circumstance well you know I wanted this and all of a sudden yet came to pass well that was wonderful great but also I I work for this and I did this and I did this and I did this and so we try to relate it to what we have done rather than putting the praise back to God we alone amen that's right but when you get down to the place where you have no options and you began to wrestle with God In Prayer but all of a sudden it takes on a whole different perspective sure amen because then you begin to realize I could not do this it had to be God Amen and then that God all of a sudden becomes your God yes and there's only at that point in time really does you begin to have a relationship or you have you begin to walk with with with God but here again like like like I say it we have to reach a point in our lives where we have to know that God did what God said he would do yes and then we wrestle with him where we get to actually know him and the more he begins to reveal himself unto you then all of a sudden we have this walk where eventually leads into a trust amen another one that I looked at was Moses now Moses to me is a very interesting character I mean his his his mother had taken him he was born I think after 3 months he put him in an ark and sent him down the river and then uh one of Pharaoh's daughters took him out of the out of the water and Moses began to be raised in in Pharaoh's household yeah and and and pH and and Moses's mother actually got to nurse him and during and and nursing uh I mean nursing with them we're looking at a year or two okay it's not something that that like like happens here in the states or whatever but all of a sudden she would have been able to relate to him at that age you know you're born as a you you are a special child yeah we pray to God for a deliverer we pray for God to to to to to to save us from pharaoh and for all the things which were going around us and so it must have been instilled within the mind of Moses there's a purpose for my life yeah amen and so when he got into when he began to be studying for the to be in Egyptian he could he was he was studying to become the next Pharaoh yeah I mean he was he became a man of Might he became a man of authority he became a man of power he would lead the armies and he would lead them and he would lead them into Victory yes it takes a strong man to be able to have the other people be willing to follow if you got a I I mean I was in the Army and there are a lot of officers that I didn't have much respect for you did because of their rank but there's a few men that I began that even in the Army I realized he was not only doing with the will of the of the military but yet they had a character within himself which made it so he also valued your life yeah right he says we have to go into battle we're going to fight a tough battle but he says we will go and we'll be Victor and he would pump us up yes but he he was a man I would be willing to follow sure because of the strength of character that he had well see Moses had to have this type of a character if he was going to an army it couldn't be somebody who would stutter and who who didn't have any confidence in himself and so one of these days he he went out to visit the children of of Israel and he wanted to tell them look at he say I've been raised up to be your deliverer yeah I have come and God has go God has shown me through my mother I am to be the deliverer and so but you have to trust in me yeah and they looked at looked at Moses well why should we trust in you yeah you know and so he killed one Egyptian and then when when that got to be knows right he he High tailed it out of town right but see God Moses was going to do it his way yeah you no God wants it done his way right yes and so he he went and and he started taking care of Jethro shape and the lady that he married brother B say she had a temper as bad as Moses did so it kind of Whitted him down a Nots right but finally he got to the place where he were where where God says okay Moses and this was took 40 years for God to prepare Moses and found 40 years later all of it so he'd been 80 years old I guess by that time and and so he all of a sudden got in a there was a bush that was burning this kind of attracted Moses's attention so he went over there and he began to look at it and God noticed and Moses had turned aside and uh then God began to speak to Moses yeah and says take off your shoes from off your feet you're Unholy ground amen Moses now met God and God began to relate un him yeah you are the deliverer I chose you from the beginning I chose you from your birth you are going to deliver the children of Israel amen and by this point in Moses's life he said well I I ain't going back uhuh I can't even talk straight he said I just I come out here with the goats just to have some peace and quiet because home is you know has his own issues but but we have to begin to understand it took the it took the experience of actually Moses meeting God before it changed Moses right God had to get Moses to the place where Moses no longer was a strong individual he was no longer a man who believed in himself he was a man who no longer could lead an army yeah U but now all of a sudden God says fine now you're in the position I want you because now Moses you have to rely upon me in order for me to be able to accomplish what I want through you amen and often this is the way we have to come this is the place we have to come in our own lives we have to begin to realize it all depends on God it's not about us and this this is one of the things that I've been impressed with in the my in the last few months it doesn't have anything to do with me right it all has to do with him amen as we stand as Ministers of the Gospel that is and me trying to put together my notes and coming up some inspiring message no it has to come to the place where I can become a a vessel I can become a channel through which God can flow to speak to the ones that he once spoken to amen because everybody else has needs everybody else has their own problems everybody everybody else approaches God often times in different ways through different Avenues yes true so we have to be able as as a minister of the Gospel we have to be we have to come to the place where we merely become the channel through which God can flow this is something brother brandom himself had to learn amen he had to learn to begin to realize that God the gift that God had given to brother brandham was not for brother brandham to use but it was a gift that God had placed in the prophet for God to use right and and here again we come down to the same thing in all of our Lives amen we're all individuals we're all people God has a God has a calling on all of our Lives it's not just to May me not just to minister not to stand before the people and preach but go but you each of you have a Ministry each of you have God living inside of you and what God is wanting to do he's wanting to use you he wants you he wants through you to go out and reach out unto other people amen you are the only God the people are going to see right the way you live the way you present your the way you live the way the way you act that that is how other people will perceive God yes and if you just act like everybody else well okay then there's no difference sure but it's like within the message we're supposed to God's car God is supposed to be living in us and so his character is supposed to manifest itself through US yes so there has to be some way where they distinguish us from the rest of Christianity amen and this and I I know when we lived in Israel people wondered why are we there well when we were in Israel the the the Jewish people when they saw what the denominational systems had had uh I mean there was mixed bathing and there you couldn't tell the Heaven from anybody else and the the different denominational systems would sit there and they would fight literally fist fight who is going to have access to the holy place first and uh so some of them would come out off bloody and and the Jewish people looked at this and they laughed and they believed in three Gods we only believe in one so we were different we in a lot of ways we were different and so the people began to look at us the lives that we lived and the way that we conducted ourselves am yes because we went there to represent Jesus Christ yes we weren't there representing a denominational system we weren't there representing any other group we were representing God himself yes and they could look at us and they realize there was something different about us and so because of the way that we lived all of a sudden people began to see aight of God that the denominational systems could not show amen yeah yes so we go on and and here again when we look when we look at Moses it goes on and it says not in the absolute brother BR says notice Moses had the fire the fire was in Moses because whatever Moses said it wasn't Moses it was God speaking amen and he performed a sign because the pillar of fire left the bush and come on Moses amen yes and see this is where it has to come now on us yes when we we say we've received the Holy Spirit what you received it's not the third person of a trinity no you have received the essence of everything God is amen that which lives inside of you is God every bit God right but you have to be learn how to listen to him you have to learn how to yield to him and until you begin to learn how to yield to him then you're we're no better than the Baptist we're no better than any other denominational system right but when all of a sudden we can take our lives and we can give it over to God when we meet God like Jacob had to meet God Jacob had to wrestle with God only after he wrestled with God that all of a sudden God become his God it no longer was the god of his fathers now all of a sudden he claimed that he claimed God as his God yes well with Moses he had he knew who he was his mother had told him who he was and so all of a sudden uh and when the fire came out of the Bush and entered into Moses that changed Moses so when he went into into Egypt what he had you know what did he have he had a stick in his hand Moses where are you going I'm going down to take over Egypt yeah uh where's your army I have it right here okay amen God had told him he says you got that stick there's a lot of power in that stick yes well I don't have a stick but the power of God's in here right but I have to learn to yield this to him amen so that he can do what he wants through me yes true looking under Jesus brother B makes this statement and that's what we ought to do today no man has got a right to preach until he is filled with the Holy Ghost right theologians and mathematicians so forth can't explain all that away from you but if a man has but if a man has ever been in the backside of the desert in that sacred spot and meet God like Moses did uh did there's no man could take that away from him he knows he was once there and this is where we all have to come also here in in our lives we have to meet him amen he cannot be a god out there anymore right he has to be the god in here he cannot be a God in the bush he cannot be a God in brother Bram he cannot be a God and the pastor no it has to come down to the god actually is in me right and we have to have this all of us have to have this true it's not just the ministry it's every single member of the congregation amen God has to be a reality to you true because only until he becomes a reality to you can he change you and can he live live his life and manifest himself through you amen amen I go on and another one the last one of the people I would I wanted was was Sol of Tarsus and a lot of way I can relate to Saul I was raised in a Baptist Church y they taught me all the Sunday school literature sure you know the time that Jesus lived oh it was nice time of peace and joy and and everything was green and everything was nice and everybody loved everybody else and everything was just all peachy and cream yeah well as I began to study I begin to realize the story taught me wasn't exactly true yeah because there was a time of drastic turmoil there were inra was under the the occupation of the Roman army and and there was crucifixions and there was all kinds of abuse the priesthood was um they were there but they weren't they were not following the word of God I mean how could they crucify him right yeah they gave Judas the money Judas gave it back to them oh we can't take this money now because it's the money of blood we can't put in the treasury no now we have to something I mean the hypocrisy exist is enormous amen well we look at at at denominational system the word says women shouldn't preach well God didn't mean what he said oh yeah he didn't well what else do you have in the Bible that you don't believe that he meant what he said right exact I mean it mix bathing well you know there has to be separation there has to be Holiness there has to be Purity oh God didn't mean that that was just for another the day excuse me how much of the Bible are you going to take away just start tearing out the pages right just leave the few paragraphs that you actually agree with Y but see God sent us a prophet to get us back to the word we we have to realize God sent the prophet to take and prepare a bride for a Rapture yes in order for the bride to be prepared for a Rapture that bride has to begin to live this word amen we have to take what God Said in that word we have to and not not only apply it to us but we have to have the God of this word living such in Us in which he is changing our very nature from the inside out until so we literally become the manifestation the expression of God Amen right so Saul when he when so Saul was on the road to Damascus he was persecuting the church he was going to take and bind them all up and haul them back to Jerusalem you know so they could be tried there and all of a sudden this light showed around about Saul Saul realized that was the same light that was in the burning bush yeah right right and all of a sudden a voice spoke out of that and says Saul why are you persecuting me and Saul was doing the best he could to serve the God that he believed in right but the God that he believed in was a God that he had heard about yes it wasn't a God that he knew but on the road to Damascus that changed yes all of a sudden he said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me how could I be persecuting you I'm trying I'm trying to eradicate this is this heresy that has invaded our our religion right he said who are you he says I'm Jesus he was persecuting the church yeah what is the church church is his body amen if people persecute us they're not persecuting us amen they're persecuting the body of Jesus Christ yes right so we have to understand that amen but see that experience with Saul changed him he went to Damascus got his eyesight got filled with the Holy Ghost and then he went out of town and he went a place where he could get the Scrolls and for three years I think it was he went there through the scroll and he had been taught them he he wasn't ignorant of these I mean he was a scholar but he went through and he went through and God began to take the Scrolls and began to open unto him the revelation of who he is God actually is right and from that point on we get in Philippians he says Paul says that I might be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that I might which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is with God by faith and then he go that I might know him yes amen and know is not a is not a casual knowing right right it's knowing in the same way that a husband and wife knows each other it's an intimate personal relationship yes but see that's where we have to come in our walk it have we have to know him Amen in the same intimate personal relationship that a husband or wife wife knows each other where after a while my wife knows what I'm thinking most of the time I can start a sentence and she can finish it I haven't come to that place with her but she you know with with me anyway that that's the way but you know but here again but because of the relationship we know each other yes well this is how we have to come with God we have to know him amen we have to have an intimate personal relationship with Jesus Christ yes a casual knowing him we do just knowing the the stories of the Bible just knowing the life of the Prophet just knowing oh yeah God sent a prophet that won't cut it anymore no we have to come down to the same way that Paul was there has to be this intimate personal relationship right and only through that intimate personal relationship will there be the ability to to to develop Faith within God yes and this is what Jacob found when he finally wrestled With God all of a sudden God became a reality to him and then his walk with God began with Moses after after the burning bush all of a sudden now God became a reality to him and and that's was when the relationship began with Moses where Moses began to understand God we look at Saul and and saw after the after the Damascus Ro Damascus experience yes here again God became a reality to him amen he says now I really want to know him yes and so he would go through the scriptures and other places he said there's been a mystery that's been hidden from from the beginning of the scriptures all the way through when what is this great mystery it's Christ Living inside of amen amen praise the Lord having this intimate personal relationship where God so lives inside of you until it's no longer you living but now it's Christ Living and manifesting himself praise the Lord amen when I began to look at Faith I I I be I began to to to not question but I want to understand what exactly what you mean when we say have faith faith is believing for something is it learning or is it actually having faith in someone as I was going through in Ephesians 284 by grace are you Sav through faith and that not of yourself it's a gift from God Amen faith is a gift God gives you right it's not something that you just kind of think it up in your own mind no God gives you Faith yeah is a gift from God praise the Lord and the thing that we have to begin to understand what is this faith is supposed to produce brother Bram in Ministry explained he says at last just as long somebody asked how long does Divine Healing last brother ROM says it lasts just as long as Faith lasts amen salvation lasts the same way just as long as Faith last when you feel that you're not saved anymore then you're not saved for it's by faith that you're saved through Grace yes and so here but how how but here again to me it comes down to a relationship why do I believe that I'm that I that I'm saved because he says I am yes and I've met him that's right I've wrestled with him yes I've got to the place where I know God you said in your word that if I will accept you I will accept your sacrifice at the cross that you will you have saved my soul that point on there's no more question right true brother BR and his I be not afraid he says and I believe that healing is a finished work it's been completed for 2,000 years when Jesus when Jesus died at Calvary he saved you from sin and healed your sicknesses and every blessing and Redemptive blessing is yours by faith it's a work say it's yours amen if you can believe yes it praise the Lord that's the stickle amen do you believe it you actually believe that what God Said God will perform yes right Abraham got to the place where where Abraham yeah he they tried to produce a child and he got ishmail and that's problem we still have today because of ishmail right yes but then then when it got to the place in Abraham's life that he realized he could not produ child he realized that Sarah couldn't bear a child and and a paraphrase you know basically God says well now you know you can't now let me right well see often this is the way it comes with us in our relationship and Believing by faith when we reach the end of our line when we reach the place where we actually have no other hope no other options then God says okay now will you trust me right and generally when we make that transition in our faith when we begin to realize I cannot do this God now it has to be you doing this then all of a sudden then things change in our lives right amen and in my uh my new ministry brother vam says as far as God was concerned I was saved when Jesus died but it'll never do me no good until I receive it to me yes that he is the Son of God Amen and I've accepted him as my savior Divine Healing uh for you if God Divine Healing is for you if God will reveal that to you that it's for you amen but you just can't stumble at it it's got to come by a revelation and when it's revealed that by his stripes you are healed there's something Satan can never do as as as your younger brother from SS whatever that all the Devils couldn't move you sure he says when it's revealed and so it comes to the place we often I hear people say oh yeah I'm still believing for my salvation and that's good we have to do that but when it comes to the place in our lives where we are where it's a revelation to us yes no God you said I'm Healed and I believe it all of a sudden God begins to go beyond just a belief and all of a sudden to the place where God has revealed to me that I am healed amen then it changes things yes I mean it's like okay the example that brother BR that there was one lady he prayed for he told her who her name was where she had lived he said said that she had a stomach issue and and all these other things and so when she went home and she tried to eat all of a sudden her stomach still couldn't handle food and her dad her husband got on her case you're making a mockery of Christianity look at this you say you're here you can't eat any more than you could before and and even her pastor got on her case you're making a mockery of Christianity she says look at I stood before a man who did not know me he told me my name he told me where I live he told me what the issue was yes because he did that I believe right God has healed me I will confess that until my dying day praise the Lord but it comes to that it comes to the place where it's a revelation to you that God has done what God has said amen finally one day the the Holy Spirit went through the went through the neighborhood and all of a sudden that's when she got out and she she began to eat things that normally she couldn't eat that's when God honored her faith yes but if she listened to her husband and her pastor well you know well I guess maybe the prophet was wrong well maybe I guess he was just you know I I don't know I don't know what but anyway I guess I'm not I guess it was just encouraging words or something like that yeah God never would have healed her right it had to be a revelation amen it had to be the place where you actually know God has healed You by a revelation which God has placed within your heart amen works with faith expressed brother bam says the same thing they do about Divine Healing they think well it's just a Hocus Pocus or something he says it isn't it's genuine unadultered faith in what God said to be the truth right and that anchors it amen now Faith is a revelation for God now Faith is a re there's where I want to stay there for a moment it's a revelation he has revealed to you by his grace it it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you uh you you you ever have faith it's G if if you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God re reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation amen it's not something you work up right it's not something you study and all of a sudden oh yeah hey that sounds good I think I'll believe it no no it has to come to the place where it's a revelation to you and sometimes we have to wrestle with God on that sometimes we have to really get down into prayer really begin to pray and really begin to seek the face of God and until so we enter into a presence where God is and then God has the ability to give us the Revelation to speak directly to us yes amen he goes on even in the Rapture he says but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her revealed to her that's the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed him as though it wasn't so yes Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder make was God that's right he wandered all over Israel palesi looking for that City well I'm looking for that City also amen I'm looking for the changing of my body I'm looking for the Rapture and I it's brother bradam says it's the time of the Rapture is upon us amen the Rapture actually has already begun he says brother bradam says says you know um God will descend with a voice shout of the Archangel and Trump of God what was the voice he says it was this message this message was the voice to awaken the bride so the so the Rapture is a process we are in the middle of that Pro process right and even one of these days soon and I believe it's I'm hoping it's soon um all of a sudden I'll get the change in my body I will go from 80 down to 20 hey that's a pretty good change I think I and I will I will lose 100 pounds just like that that would be great too but but you have to begin understand it's a revelation to us yeah and the bride has to have this Revelation amen because it's the Revelation that God is going to come back that God is going to return and we are going to go enter into his presence and we're going to rule and reign with him for a thousand years it is this Revelation that keeps us pure praise the Lord why do we live for Jesus Christ why when when Jesus Christ rose from the dead and he came and appeared unto the disciples on the day of day of Pentecost and stuff before it he was resurrected and said why do you stand looking up in here he says the same one who's gone away he's going to come again and so he said wait until Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high well this was great they were expecting him to come right back right that's what motivated them yes they didn't realize it was going to be 2,000 years before he came back amen God sent a prophet in this generation why to remind us no he is coming back yes this the message is the beginning to try to tell you to prepare yourself for that which is coming am because that's where we are at we have to be our our understanding of the message our understanding of God has to be more than just the Baptist Church there has to be more than just everybody getting together having a good time of fellow no there has to be a preparation in our heart for that which we know is coming amen I mean we just had an election oh yeah now we got this guy in office and he's going to change everything we're going to get back to to to to making me making America great again all this other wonderful wonderful things okay I hope it's so but that's not where my faith is right if California SS tomorrow do you think uh everything's going to kind drift away that he was planning amen come on right I mean if somebody manages to assassinate him do you think everything's going to keep going the way he thinks it was going to go right do you know what tomorrow is going to bring amen right do you have any comprehension that tomorrow everything could change yes yes amen so what what sustains us he's coming yes Jesus Christ is coming amen I am preparing myself I'm preparing by the way I live the thing way I think getting into the word beginning to comprehend who God is and what God is and what God has promised to me he's promised me a body change amen I am looking for that there has to be the manifestation of the sons of God I'm going to be one of those that is going to be manifested amen I am going to come to adoption where word is the same as the father speaking that is what is coming that there has to be a preparation in our lives to prepare ourselves for what he has said would be amen and if it's just a Sunday morning social function you've missed it true if brother Brown said another place if you missed the life you've missed it all yes it's the life that has to live inside of you it's the life living inside of you that will motivate you and it'll change your life into the very image of Jesus Christ amen that's why God sent the prophet to to prepare us for his coming to prepare us for a Rapture am amen Faith produces a trust how can you trust in somebody you don't know how can you trust in somebody to make a promise to you and uh well he made it last week and he hasn't fulfilled it this way you know maybe he never will and then the guy lies to you again lies to you again after a while you just figure we what he says doesn't mean nothing but see when God When We Begin we the only way that Moses could have a faith in God and trust God is because of the Miracles God did through him yes Jacob could only trust and faith in God because of of what he saw how God provided and protected him during his rest of his life this is what what what Saul began to realize that he can trust in God because God was living in him and God was manifesting himself through him and God was revealing himself to him but we have to have that same God being revealing him him revealing himself to us yes because only then will there come a change right yes amen like like in Romans it's in Romans 4 and and 21 speaking about Abraham and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform amen amen yes is that the relationship we have with God do I mean I look at myself how can I be en raptured how can I be the manifestation of the sons of God how can I speak as if God himself is speaking I I can't do that right not in my present State yes but I believe that what he has promised he has the ability to perform he has the ability to bring it to because he spoke it amen this is his word it's not our word why does he heal because he promised he would right yes well why doubt God cannot lie amen but you have to trust him you have to have faith in him you have to walk with him amen amen yes sir when when when we look here again look at Abraham you realize that the faith and the trust that Abraham had to take his son Isaac and to offer him that's right he realized that God he he had his life with God had come to the place where he had absolute total confidence and trust in God God says take your son Isaac sacrifice him right I'm sure he wrestled within himself but he was obedient finally he went up into the mountain he showed him and took the knife put the wood tied his son up put his son on the on the on the on on the wood and he he was going he was going to do it sure and God says stay your hand amen he told his servants the son and I were going to go to the mountain and worship my son and I are going to come back right how God would perform that Abraham didn't know right God had not told him but in the last minute God provided the sacrifice to offer instead of his son amen God has a way of doing his things his way he doesn't consult me about these things amen he doesn't allow me to vote whether I want this or God is Sovereign he's going to do what he wants to but I have learned to trust in him I learned how to walk with him I've learned you don't I don't know what tomorrow will bring but I know you've already been there since you've already been there you know what I'm going to face so I'll just put my my hand in your hand will amen will follow praise the Lord see this is where we have to come in our relation we have to have absolute trust in the god that has called us yes amen I did a study on habac and and this my study of habac was about three four years ago and that changed my whole concept of what is faith faith is not believing for something faith is believing in someone amen yes if I God says he he he he can heal amen I have the faith to believe that what he has promised he is able to bring it to pass amen and in that I rest yes God said he would watch over me and protect me and provide for me he has the ability to bring it to pass right I don't yes I don't have the ability to protect myself I rely on him first thing we do when we sit into a car Lord I need your protection there's all these crazies out there driving around and I need you to watch over and also Lord because I'm uh I have my limitations and sometimes anyway um Lord you have to guide me and you know you take a steering wheel because sometimes I like to look at the scening that's not a good thing to do you're driving no but here again Lord I'm trusting in you to get from point A to point B amen and I really I trust in that I rely upon him yes sir and and he always takes care of that he he always he has always provided he has always watched over he has always guarded he is always protected Amen in Hab 2 and4 it says behold the soul which is which is lifted up is not upright or righteous before God but the just shall live by faith yes and and it says the soul which is lifted up it talks about a man of Pride yes yeah I'm too proud I don't need God's help I've done so well all by myself why do I need him right and so you know trusting in God for salvation you're not trusting God for healing you're not trusting God for your your livelihood you're not trusting for God for anything God say basic fine you think you can do it on your own good luck I will just leave you alone but you do what you want to do the thing we that I look at with in the world we're living in now we don't know what tomorrow is going to amen right we don't know what the new Administration is going to be able to accomplish we don't know what's going to happen in Israel we don't know what's going to happen in the Ukraine we don't know what's going to happen in Iran we don't know about the wars that are brewing in the minds of men we don't know about right the the large multitude of terrorists which have now infiltrated our countryes right I mean that's what I look at you see a different that that that's fine that's your prerogative I don't know about tomorrow right all I know is Lord I'm going to trust you yes for tomorrow yes I'm going to I'm going to come to a place in my life when I looked at habac and habac lived in a time of of great uncertainty yes the Assyrian Empire was on was was was was beginning its decline Egypt was was in was a vassel of of the Assyrian and so they went to help they went to help Assyria fight against Babylon and they lost and so and then and then anyway it it came to the place where this is the time that that that that habac lived he saw the the the hypocrisy of the priest who he saw there was no there was no justice there was no law there was no nothing right the the people that had the money they persecuted they wrote you know they they they they bled for lack of a better word the poor people I mean they took possession of their houses and their lands and all the other stuff until literally they owned everything and the poor people owned nothing and they just whatever the rich people would do out to them yeah right this is this was the this was the condition that habac Liv yes and God came to habac and says you have to trust me a proud person will not a proud person he really won't care he thinks he can do it on his own yeah well when the Babylonians finally invaded all of a sudden the rich people found out they had nothing right I think they marched a whole bunch of them just you know they they stripped them down to their birthday suit and they marched them all the way to where they were going literally they didn't have have a stitch of clothing they didn't own anything right right okay um this was the time when Babylon when Nebuchadnezzar came in that's when that's when Daniel was carried away into Babylon and all these other types of things but H but God had told habac he says because habac was afraid he was afraid he wasn't going to survive the in Invasion that was coming and he said well Lord how do I know I'm going to live and that's and God said you have to trust me amen right you have to have total confidence that I will do what I have said amen and the faith that from what I would be able to study and stuff the faith that God was requiring of habac was total Reliance between the creature and the Creator yes God provides for the birds God provides for the animals God provides for all of his creation amen he says trust me and I will provide for you also yes and when I studied habac I I began I asked God I says if I will do if I will trust you like you're asking habac will you take care of me the same way you promised to take care of habac and God spoke to me he said yeah and since then I minute rest amen I don't know what tomorrow will bring but I Know Who Holds Tomorrow yes praise the Lord do I believe he'll heal well sure yes how can I not believe amen and so when I have need of healing I say well Lord It's Your word it's your promise to me yes and so Lord now I'm expecting the manifestation of the healing amen well Lord you promised to provide for me well okay you said you would I'm expecting you to do that praise the Lord I know when we were in India there were times when really we were in a situation where uh well if it hadn't been for God's intervention we'd be shipped home in a bag and God intervened God watched over us God protected us yes and okay and and so I I have had to learn over the times of the our trips to India and trips to other places I I beg to understand what God was requiring and if I will take it I will put my total confidence and trust in him amen that he will fulfill what he said he would do for me amen and that's why I don't question healing right that's why I don't question my salvation amen that's why I don't question what's going to happen tomorrow because I'm trusting in somebody who's greater than than myself we have to realize we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are part of something greater than ourselves we are part of an eternal Kingdom we are part of the of the of the body the the worldwide body of Jesus Christ we are a small segment of that body but still we are part of that body yes and he said he would watch over and he would protect that body he would he would provide for that body as a as a husband is supposed to provide for his wife and cherish and nourish her that's the way Jesus Christ does his church that's he does us yes but that has to be the reality right it just can't be words that oh that's nice no it has to come to the place where no God this is your word this is your promise to me amen and Lord now I'm relying upon you I'm relying Upon Your Grace I'm relying upon your mercy right I'm relying upon the word that you have given to me and Lord I'm trusting in that word because that word is you yes and if you made that promise in your word Lord that that means you made that promise to me because I am your child amen you are my father I am your child I I you you you you ordained me to be your wife you you chose you chose me as part of that of of the of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and so Lord when I read about the Rel the when I read about the responsibility of the husband to the wife and realize that's your responsibility to me well Lord this is good amen you promise to nourish me and to cherish me and to take care of me and provide for me you promise to be my protector you Pro promise to be all of these wonderful things amen and that I I've learn I've come to the place where I rested this yes so it's no longer a struggle I mean I was concerned about the elections I I Adit that I live in America I mean I I was in Vietnam I I helped I saw people die for the for the freedoms that we have amen and I still believe that those freedoms have value yes abolutely amen because I've been in other countries and okay I've seen how I I've seen how other countries deal with their population yeah and the Lord I think in my opinion probably is wrong but he's given us a slight breather and that prob is wrong amen but all I know is that be as the bride he has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son yes he is watching over his bride to bring her to the place where we can be raptured where we can where we can all of a sudden become what he said that we are it's not telling trying to be become something that we're not it's not trying to become something which is unattainable right I mean I see these people that you know they can run a mile um yeah okay 10t 100 feet maybe huh that's my limit okay but these guys they can run miles that's not me but he's not asking me to run a mile amen he's asking me to trust in him and believe in him so that he can accomplish through me what his desire is for my life as part of the body of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right God bless you amen praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord wonderful isn't that the truth anybody ever notice he hit on the same message we preached last week said this last time he was here did the same thing today amen he will provide amen God is our provider regardless of what happens in the election regardless of what happens in the the federal government is not your provider no Jesus Christ is your provider amen amen it just takes the faith to believe God is taking care of it amen praise the Lord I believe that so thank God let it be a reality to all of us amen don't let the devil steal that from you like we preached a couple months ago don't let the devil steal that from you amen just believe in faith have confidence what was the message confidence in God Amen believing that God takes care of it God is our provider God is our way maker God is our everything amen praise the Lord so I believe that it's got to be in here though got to be a part of you amen don't just
