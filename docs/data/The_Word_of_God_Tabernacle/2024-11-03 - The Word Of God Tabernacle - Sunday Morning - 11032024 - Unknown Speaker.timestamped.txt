[49:11] praise the Lord Matthew chapter 10 let's
[49:13] begin with verse five amen verse five
[49:17] first few verses just talk about the
[49:19] naming of the 12 disciples but in the
[49:21] fifth verse he says these 12 Jesus sent
[49:24] forth and commanded them saying
[49:28] go not into the way of the Gentiles and
[49:31] into any city of the Samaritans enter ye
[49:34] not but go rather to the lost sheep of
[49:37] the House of Israel and as you go preach
[49:39] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[49:42] heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise
[49:46] the Dead cast out Devils freely ye have
[49:49] received freely give provide neither
[49:53] gold nor silver nor brass in your purses
[49:56] nor scrip for your journey neither two
[49:58] coats neither shoes nor yet staves for
[50:01] the Workman is worthy of his meat you
[50:04] can be seated if you'd
[50:06] like
[50:08] amen God is our
[50:12] provider God is the one that provides
[50:15] whatever it is that we have need of God
[50:17] is the one that provides it amen and we
[50:19] trust God to bring provision for
[50:21] whatever we have need of and we know
[50:24] here that Jesus as he gave Commission to
[50:27] his disciples as we are Disciples of God
[50:30] today knowing that we receive the same
[50:33] Commission because we are believers
[50:35] today we are the extension that God has
[50:37] moved as he moved out of the Jews as he
[50:40] told them here of course to not go to
[50:42] the Gentiles but as God's Ministry moved
[50:45] from the Gentiles his ministry but the
[50:48] as the Holy Ghost came from the Jews
[50:50] over to the Gentiles that that
[50:52] commission became our commission amen it
[50:55] became the believer's commission
[50:56] commission it become what we know now
[50:58] today it wasn't then we know now today
[51:01] as Christians became the Christian
[51:05] commission the commission was to go into
[51:08] all the world and to preach the gospel
[51:10] the commission was to go out and heal
[51:12] the sick and to raise the dead and to
[51:14] cleanse the lepers and to per and to
[51:17] pray for and allow God to move in us to
[51:20] perform Miracles
[51:23] healings provisions
[51:26] whatever God is going to provide or
[51:29] whatever we might need God sending us
[51:32] forward so that that provision takes
[51:34] place in all of our Lives God has
[51:37] allowed us to do that God has given us
[51:39] that commission but he he gave that
[51:42] commission all of us have it of course
[51:44] but he gave us that commission and then
[51:47] he
[51:48] said he said this to his disciples in
[51:51] but then he said provide neither gold or
[51:54] silver nor brass in your purses
[51:58] amen don't worry about
[52:01] money don't worry about your wallet
[52:04] right then he says nor script for your
[52:07] journey don't take two coats don't take
[52:10] the shoes amen just sandals just your
[52:13] regular Footwear nor stage don't worry
[52:16] about running across uh uh bad people or
[52:22] animals or anything that might hurt you
[52:24] you don't need to take a weapon amen a
[52:26] physical weapon of course the the weapon
[52:29] of war that we have is the word of God
[52:31] but don't take a weapon don't take money
[52:34] don't take don't don't worry about your
[52:36] script don't take two coats don't don't
[52:39] worry about all this that you say I'm
[52:41] going on this long journey we always
[52:43] provide all this stuff we always make
[52:45] sure we have enough money we always sure
[52:48] we make sure and have enough stuff we
[52:49] always make sure we have enough gas to
[52:51] get where we're going and enough
[52:53] provision to take care and provide for
[52:55] ourselves and protect ourselves but God
[52:57] told him he says that you're going on my
[53:00] commission you go with
[53:03] nothing basically go with nothing I will
[53:07] provide it for you because the Workman
[53:10] is worthy of his meat right praise the
[53:12] Lord now we know that today of the
[53:15] provision to say well uh uh it would
[53:20] come from the provision of the hand of
[53:21] so and so but that doesn't matter that's
[53:24] still God
[53:26] I I have never seen $100 bills raining
[53:30] from the sky could God do it absolutely
[53:34] but most of the time if not all the time
[53:37] God has someone else that he's put on
[53:39] their heart as a provision to give right
[53:43] amen not coming from the sky it's not
[53:45] growing on the trees it's not it's not
[53:47] like our tumbling bushes out here crot
[53:50] or it it doesn't come that way it comes
[53:52] from the hand that God uses to provide
[53:55] it with yeah and that's the provision
[53:57] that we know a lot of times we use this
[53:59] as far as giving as unto the Lord giving
[54:02] to a minister a labor is worthy of his
[54:04] hire so on so on such and forth uh so
[54:06] forth but we know that that's God's
[54:08] provision God's doing that it isn't the
[54:11] individual it's God God moving on the
[54:14] hand of somebody how many stories have
[54:15] you heard that uh that somebody comes up
[54:18] and says well uh God I I just had it on
[54:21] my heart to give you this
[54:23] $100 amen and and and you go to say well
[54:28] I I I needed this I needed to pay a bill
[54:32] or I needed to put groceries on the
[54:34] table or I needed something and God put
[54:36] it on that heart to give it to this
[54:38] person because they're the one that need
[54:39] it that's God providing the meat right
[54:42] that's God saying you don't need to
[54:44] worry about staves you don't need to
[54:45] worry about gold silver you don't need
[54:47] to about worry about uh what you buy and
[54:49] what you say and what you do I'll
[54:51] provide it for you even to the point
[54:54] that Jesus told them they will hate you
[54:57] they will put you in jail they will
[55:00] scorge you they will bring you before
[55:02] councils he even told them when you're
[55:05] brought before the council don't worry
[55:07] about what you're going to say right
[55:09] I'll say it through you yeah don't worry
[55:13] about gold silver script coats staves
[55:17] purse don't even worry about what you're
[55:19] going to say I will give to you what you
[55:22] need to say praise the Lord I mean how
[55:25] greater commission could we have what
[55:28] greater provision could we expect from
[55:30] God but then to realize that we walk as
[55:33] in the Lord and God provides every bit
[55:36] of it for us amen this thought come from
[55:40] the misnomer of course that uh all the
[55:43] things that is said and people worry
[55:45] about and uh stuff and election and
[55:48] money going away and all God takes care
[55:51] of us yes God provides for us no matter
[55:54] what it is yes and he s them on this
[55:57] Commission in life and you say I I God
[56:02] hasn't come down to give me this direct
[56:03] commission but it's G he's giving it to
[56:06] us in the
[56:08] scripture we believe the scripture don't
[56:10] we right if we believe the scripture and
[56:14] we believe the scripture applies to us
[56:17] then God is going to be the one to do it
[56:20] he has always done it amen yes the labor
[56:23] is worthy of his hire and God always
[56:25] provides and takes care of even to the
[56:28] point of what you're going to say right
[56:31] amen I tell you when you re when you put
[56:34] God to the test and realize that God
[56:37] will provide what he said he would
[56:39] provide it it takes all the worry away
[56:42] yes it it it takes all the guess workor
[56:44] out of it it takes all the well I wonder
[56:47] if I mean how many times I mean if if
[56:50] God can provide everybody I mean we
[56:52] believe for salvation uh We Trust and
[56:55] Believe that we we know we're we're
[56:58] saved well well if if God is a big
[57:01] enough God to save our souls and to put
[57:04] his life in us then is he not a big
[57:08] enough God to provide for the little
[57:10] things right for the for the tiny things
[57:13] for the things that uh uh uh that that
[57:16] are needed for life for for human
[57:20] existence I mean the greatest gift and
[57:22] the greatest provision will be after
[57:24] this life the the life after this life
[57:28] is the most important thing the soul is
[57:30] what matters not the body but let's go
[57:32] over uh same chapter but 28th
[57:35] verse skip all the other thing down to
[57:38] the 28th
[57:42] verse listen now and fear not them which
[57:47] kill the
[57:48] body but are but are not able to kill
[57:52] the soul but rather fear him which is
[57:55] able to destroy both soul and Body in
[57:59] hell that is God nobody else can do that
[58:02] but the Lord amen are not look it now
[58:06] are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing
[58:08] that's about that's a couple Cent amen
[58:12] Two Sparrows sold for a
[58:16] farthing which is a a a very
[58:19] insignificant amount of money of a
[58:21] couple pennies if you
[58:23] will and one of them shall not fall fall
[58:26] on the ground without your father in
[58:28] other words not one of them will fall
[58:31] unless God knows about it God knows God
[58:37] cares one Sparrow that's worth a a penny
[58:42] maybe one sparrow that falls God knows
[58:45] about it God's concerned about it God
[58:48] cares about it and if God does that for
[58:51] them he said What About Us
[58:57] what about us which in US is a soul
[59:00] worth 10 million
[59:02] worlds what could you think of the value
[59:04] of the world would be today what what
[59:06] would you consider the world of the the
[59:09] value of the world is today we've got
[59:11] how many billionaires that have M that
[59:13] have uh uh more money than they'll spend
[59:15] in a 100 lifetimes we got uh trillions
[59:19] of dollars of national debt how much do
[59:22] you think this world is worth they talk
[59:25] about simple hurricane coming through a
[59:28] a a state or a city and the billions of
[59:31] dollars it's going to cost to rebuild it
[59:35] that's just one
[59:36] city that's just one area what do you
[59:39] think about the entire world now
[59:42] obviously in the United States we're one
[59:44] of the wealthiest if not the wealthiest
[59:46] country in the world so everything that
[59:47] we have is exuberant and
[59:50] expensive uh if something like that were
[59:52] to go through some parts of India it
[59:55] would cost about 50 cents are
[59:57] rebuild because they're just grass huts
[1:00:00] and and bamboo or something that's
[1:00:02] holding up a a mud hut or something you
[1:00:05] just take some more mud and just put it
[1:00:06] all back up just cut down some more
[1:00:08] bamboo and get some more pom PS you got
[1:00:10] a whole house again I mean you talk
[1:00:12] about 50 Cent to build rebuild uh 10
[1:00:15] bucks to rebuild the whole little town
[1:00:17] so it's different of course in different
[1:00:19] parts of the world here we're very
[1:00:21] extravagant uh of of people uh if you go
[1:00:25] through it the same thing goes to
[1:00:27] Cyclone or hurricane goes to a certain
[1:00:28] city billions of dollars to rebuild it
[1:00:32] amen how much would it be
[1:00:35] worth but brother bam said now he said
[1:00:38] it two different ways I know brother
[1:00:39] green always said uh brother johnon I
[1:00:42] believe it was said that worth 10,000
[1:00:45] but I also found several quotes where
[1:00:47] brother bam said the soul is worth 10
[1:00:49] million worlds amen which bottom line is
[1:00:54] is priceless so's prices was it's 10,000
[1:00:58] 10 million 10 billion uh the point is
[1:01:02] it's Priceless so what do you think then
[1:01:06] one Sparrow fault now how about us
[1:01:09] Soul's worth 10 billion worlds Sparrow's
[1:01:11] worth a penny then 10 billion worlds 10
[1:01:15] million worlds whatever it is priceless
[1:01:18] and what about us look continue on 30th
[1:01:22] verse but the very hairs of your head
[1:01:25] are all all
[1:01:26] numbered and that's a good thing cuz I
[1:01:29] washed a bunch of them down the drain
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:31] morning uh I'm I'm thankful there goes
[1:01:34] number
[1:01:36] 2,861
[1:01:38] 2,862 actually probably more in the
[1:01:41] millions by now it seems like anyway
[1:01:43] they're falling out more and more
[1:01:45] quicker and quicker faster and faster
[1:01:47] but um um they're turning loose faster
[1:01:50] than I can keep them coming but anyway
[1:01:53] they're all numbered
[1:01:56] God has them all
[1:01:58] numbered that just I read that again
[1:02:01] this morning and it just blows my mind I
[1:02:03] just can't fathom
[1:02:05] that they think well I could number
[1:02:08] every hair on my head you probably could
[1:02:10] theoretically sit down or somebody with
[1:02:13] you could and take a little tape or
[1:02:16] something and wrap every hair and put
[1:02:18] one two I mean it might take you a long
[1:02:20] time but you could probably
[1:02:22] theoretically do that amen but God knows
[1:02:26] not just your
[1:02:27] hairs but
[1:02:30] everybody's billions of
[1:02:33] people billions of
[1:02:37] people Quin Tuple numbers of hair he has
[1:02:41] every one of them number I just I that
[1:02:44] just that's the God we're talking about
[1:02:47] that is the provider that we're talking
[1:02:49] about no wonder he's all we need if he
[1:02:52] can number every hair on everybody's
[1:02:54] head from beginning of of creation to
[1:02:58] today what is the little things that we
[1:03:01] worry about so many times that we fret
[1:03:04] over so much that seems like it's going
[1:03:06] to be the end of the
[1:03:08] world and God just it doesn't even not
[1:03:12] even a snap of a finger not even a
[1:03:14] twinkling of an eye less than that God
[1:03:17] changed the whole circumstance built on
[1:03:19] our faith obviously God provides always
[1:03:23] provides is said what am I going to do
[1:03:25] if this happens what am I going to do if
[1:03:27] this goes away what am I going to do if
[1:03:29] this God's going to take care of me
[1:03:33] God's going to watch after you amen If
[1:03:36] he if he thought enough of you to save
[1:03:38] your soul he is not going to let you go
[1:03:41] down a garbage dumb he never seen the
[1:03:44] righteous forsaken or seed begging bread
[1:03:46] God will always provide it may not be
[1:03:49] everything that you want but I guarantee
[1:03:52] you it will be everything that you need
[1:03:55] right amen God is sending God will take
[1:03:59] care of God's Great God's will will not
[1:04:02] lead you where God's grace cannot keep
[1:04:05] you right amen and if you fall you walk
[1:04:09] along in God's perfect will in your life
[1:04:11] even permissive will that we fall into
[1:04:14] even in in God's will per perfect or
[1:04:17] permissive God will still take care of
[1:04:19] you yes the RO the harder Road will be
[1:04:22] the permissive road but God will still
[1:04:25] provide yes God will still take care of
[1:04:27] you God will still always be there I
[1:04:30] Stumble and fall God will still be there
[1:04:33] all you have to do is get back
[1:04:36] up amen make a mistake all you've got to
[1:04:39] do is get back up God will still be
[1:04:41] there that's right amen God has left me
[1:04:44] no he hasn't you left him you may have
[1:04:47] left him but God never leaves us that's
[1:04:49] right God will always protect and take
[1:04:51] every hair I just still I still can't I
[1:04:54] just bogles the mind I know brother BR
[1:04:57] made statements like how many gats there
[1:04:59] would be and how many times it bat its
[1:05:02] eyes and how much Tallow every Gat would
[1:05:06] make these these kinds of analogies just
[1:05:10] uh blow my mind yeah it just blows my
[1:05:13] mind 31st verse fear ye not therefore ye
[1:05:17] are of more value than many sparrows or
[1:05:21] you say the word many doesn't seem like
[1:05:23] very much but uh it is when you look at
[1:05:27] the rest the the prospect of it when God
[1:05:30] is showing it through US amen praise the
[1:05:32] Lord we're here working to do the same
[1:05:35] thing now Matthew chapter
[1:05:38] 14 shortly
[1:05:42] after all this provision all this
[1:05:44] promise all that God
[1:05:46] said still
[1:05:48] doubt amen with
[1:05:51] us with the disciples there's still
[1:05:54] doubt
[1:05:56] God help us God help our carnality God
[1:05:59] help our Humanity God help our flesh God
[1:06:02] help our minds there always there's
[1:06:04] still those things there of
[1:06:07] reasoning and and and and imaginations
[1:06:10] and things that flood our spirit that
[1:06:13] caus us to start doubting again amen uh
[1:06:17] it's like
[1:06:19] uh brother no was saying the other day I
[1:06:23] think it was him said it
[1:06:26] they they saw Jesus come walking on the
[1:06:28] water yeah and think he they think it's
[1:06:31] some kind of evil spirit or something he
[1:06:33] gets closer to the boat and they say oh
[1:06:35] no it's
[1:06:36] Jesus and Peter looks and says it is
[1:06:39] Jesus hey Jesus can I come Jesus said
[1:06:43] come on he hops out of the boat walks
[1:06:45] right over to Jesus he's doing fine till
[1:06:47] he started looking at all the
[1:06:49] circumstances right he started looking
[1:06:51] at everything around him started looking
[1:06:53] out the improbability of a human being
[1:06:56] being able to walk on water and he
[1:06:58] started to reason and then he started to
[1:07:01] sing amen but when he started to sink
[1:07:04] what happened to him God grabbed him God
[1:07:07] grabbed him pulled him back up and they
[1:07:10] walked to the boat
[1:07:11] together praise the Lord God was there
[1:07:14] for him God took care of him but still
[1:07:17] in the midst of that there was that
[1:07:19] little doubt that came in yes amen and
[1:07:22] and we deal with that all the time s we
[1:07:25] all do
[1:07:26] still walking this journey still walking
[1:07:28] this walk that's that's what we deal
[1:07:31] with now Jesus is dealing with that here
[1:07:34] and let's read we know the stories uh of
[1:07:38] the fishes and Loaves but let's go over
[1:07:41] and read uh in the 14th
[1:07:44] chapter 15th
[1:07:51] verse Matthew 14:15
[1:08:01] amen Jesus is gotten quite a following a
[1:08:05] lot of people following around amen
[1:08:08] Jesus had compassion on them Jesus
[1:08:10] prayed for them Jesus healed some their
[1:08:13] their sickness Jesus ministered to them
[1:08:17] amen I mean what greater thing to think
[1:08:20] that you've got people in your custody
[1:08:22] if you will that you're able to
[1:08:24] influence
[1:08:26] that you're able to speak to that you're
[1:08:27] able to help I me that's a big thing uh
[1:08:31] especially today A lot of times people
[1:08:34] Garner in the world today they'll Garner
[1:08:36] big followings and they'll Garner a lot
[1:08:39] of people that have confidence in them
[1:08:42] and and for what
[1:08:43] purpose uh to spe some kind of rhetoric
[1:08:46] or something to try to uh uh convince
[1:08:49] them of this that and the other things
[1:08:52] that's really
[1:08:53] insignificant Jesus garnered a following
[1:08:56] uh uh uh there was no internet there was
[1:09:00] no computers uh there was no social
[1:09:02] media so there was no Tik Tok there was
[1:09:05] nothing that you could see that's
[1:09:07] suround the world uh to be a social
[1:09:10] media influencer no these were people
[1:09:13] that were bodily in presence with Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ right they were there and he had
[1:09:18] a following what better thing do you
[1:09:21] think to have that you can have a
[1:09:23] following of people to have enough for
[1:09:25] respect and enough confidence in you
[1:09:27] that when you speak to them you can help
[1:09:30] them but look what the disciples say
[1:09:33] 15th verse
[1:09:35] now and when it was evening his
[1:09:38] disciples came to him saying this is a
[1:09:41] desert place in the time is now passed
[1:09:44] send the multitude away that they may go
[1:09:46] into the villages and buy themselves
[1:09:49] fiddles um we finally got people there's
[1:09:54] a group of people here that I can
[1:09:57] minister to there's a multitude of
[1:10:00] people here that I can preach to that I
[1:10:02] can help that I can try to guide into
[1:10:05] the kingdom of heaven and you want me to
[1:10:07] send them
[1:10:09] away I'm not going to send those people
[1:10:11] anywhere they're staying right
[1:10:14] here I'm going to keep them right here
[1:10:16] so I can minister to them so that I can
[1:10:19] speak to them so that I can minister to
[1:10:21] their needs heal the sicknesses you keep
[1:10:24] them right right here don't send them

[1:17:08] multiply whatever you've got yes you ask
[1:17:12] God to bless it you give it and God will
[1:17:15] multiply it amen again it's like the
[1:17:20] iron floating it's like the tith giving
[1:17:22] you just bless it you give it and God
[1:17:25] multiplies it how he does it I don't
[1:17:28] know but you'll end up with more than
[1:17:30] you started with amen amen praise the
[1:17:34] Lord let me read through the rest of
[1:17:36] this he blessed it there's your key he
[1:17:39] blessed it break it gave the loaves to
[1:17:41] the disciples the Disciples of the
[1:17:42] multitude and they did all eat and were
[1:17:45] filled and took up of the fragments that
[1:17:47] remain 12 baskets
[1:17:51] full praise the
[1:17:53] Lord and and they that had eaten were
[1:17:56] about 5,000 men besides the women and
[1:18:00] children weren't even talking about the
[1:18:02] women and children just the men that
[1:18:04] were 5,000 four loaves oh think God
[1:18:09] can't do
[1:18:11] it amen you believe God can do that
[1:18:15] today
[1:18:17] amen he absolutely can Will and
[1:18:22] does praise God God's provision God
[1:18:26] takes care of it in the service of the
[1:18:29] Lord God makes a way 15th chapter let's
[1:18:32] go over to the 15th chapter just one
[1:18:34] over still in
[1:18:40] Matthew Matthew 15 uh
[1:18:46] 32 then Jesus called his disciples unto
[1:18:49] him and said I have compassion on the
[1:18:51] multitude because they continue with me
[1:18:54] now three days and have nothing to eat
[1:18:56] and I will not send them away fasting
[1:18:59] lest they faint in the way and his
[1:19:02] disciples said unto him which when
[1:19:04] should we have so much bread in the
[1:19:06] wilderness as to fill so great a
[1:19:08] multitude and Jesus said unto them how
[1:19:11] many loaves have you and they said seven
[1:19:14] and a few little fishes and he commanded
[1:19:16] the multitude again sit on the ground he
[1:19:19] took the seven Loaves and the fishes and
[1:19:21] gave thanks and break them he blessed it
[1:19:26] amen break them gave them to the
[1:19:27] disciples the disciples to the multitude
[1:19:29] and they all ate to their field
[1:19:33] again again
[1:19:35] now that you you've already seen this
[1:19:38] happen one time let's just put ourselves
[1:19:40] in this scenario you've seen it happen
[1:19:42] one time you saw where you had Five
[1:19:46] Loaves Jesus had Five Loaves and two
[1:19:48] fishes you saw that he fed 5,000 people
[1:19:52] plus the women and children you saw that
[1:19:54] that there were 12 basketfuls of
[1:19:57] fragments taken up after everybody was
[1:20:00] full and you still question
[1:20:05] God are you really still going to
[1:20:08] question God that's my question not just
[1:20:11] in the story but to us are we still
[1:20:14] going to question God because Jesus told
[1:20:18] them I don't want to send them away
[1:20:22] because they need to eat and I want them
[1:20:24] to stay here but then the disciples 33rd
[1:20:28] verse again look again they said unto
[1:20:32] him when when should we have so much
[1:20:35] bread in the wilderness to fill so great
[1:20:37] a multitude did you not just see
[1:20:40] him feed 5,000 plus the women and
[1:20:43] children with Five Loaves and two fish
[1:20:45] did you not just see that did that not
[1:20:48] just
[1:20:50] happened and you doubt him again already
[1:20:55] how many times has God provided how many
[1:20:57] go times has God taken care of how many
[1:20:59] times has God healed how many miracles
[1:21:02] have you seen performed in your life or
[1:21:04] your
[1:21:06] family and yet we question oh God going
[1:21:09] to do it again will he do it again yes
[1:21:13] oh help us
[1:21:15] Lord help thou my I believe Lord help
[1:21:19] thou my
[1:21:20] unbelief amen there's still question
[1:21:23] again J said just bring them here again
[1:21:26] what do you do it did the exact same
[1:21:27] thing took the bread and Fishes he asked
[1:21:31] he thanked and Bre and blessed it and he
[1:21:34] began to break it they gave it to them
[1:21:36] and everybody was filled yes Hallelujah
[1:21:39] the disciples they did all eat and were
[1:21:42] filled and they took up of the broken
[1:21:44] meat that was left seven baskets full
[1:21:47] again more left over in fragments than
[1:21:51] what there was when he started
[1:21:56] God praise the Lord how does that work
[1:22:00] Saints you'd tell this to some
[1:22:02] unbelieving scientists and they would
[1:22:04] put you in a rubber room in a straight
[1:22:06] jacket they would think you are
[1:22:08] completely crazy this did not happen oh
[1:22:12] either that it would TR try to figure
[1:22:13] out some way to scientifically prove how
[1:22:16] this could happen amen they always
[1:22:20] people always trying to scientifically
[1:22:21] Fe well yeah this could have the The
[1:22:23] Parting of the the Red Sea could happen
[1:22:25] because there's a great wind that come
[1:22:27] in look friend the the I don't mean to
[1:22:31] be contrary please forgive me if I am if
[1:22:35] somebody's watching this and you feel
[1:22:36] differently I'm okay I know it it was by
[1:22:40] the Breath of God but when a wind comes
[1:22:43] in outside I am old enough and hopefully
[1:22:48] intelligent enough to know that when the
[1:22:50] wind blows a certain way the flag goes
[1:22:53] like this or my hair blows like this but
[1:22:57] let me tell you Saints the seed didn't
[1:23:00] blow to one side he parted the Red Sea
[1:23:04] is that not scripture right he took the
[1:23:07] Red Sea and divided it now how if the
[1:23:10] wind is coming this way did the waves go
[1:23:13] that
[1:23:14] way how did this go this way or the way
[1:23:18] go this way if the wind's blowing this
[1:23:20] way if the wind's blowing this way yeah
[1:23:23] I could see
[1:23:25] but how did he part it yeah amen oh well
[1:23:29] the wind was going this way and he
[1:23:32] parted it you mean he took an arrow
[1:23:34] sharp wind amen I see I'm trying to take
[1:23:38] this out of trying to reason with God
[1:23:42] away right then say that God by his
[1:23:46] Miracle working ability is by his breath
[1:23:49] divided this this Red Sea amen can he
[1:23:55] take the wind and do it absolutely but
[1:23:57] that's the Breath of God but he split
[1:24:00] the Red Sea in half yeah so they could
[1:24:02] walk on what dry ground dry ground now
[1:24:06] you tell me what East Wind did
[1:24:09] that this is a miracle Saints this is a
[1:24:13] supernatural event we cannot dumb it
[1:24:16] down with trying to scientifically prove
[1:24:18] it amen but people would try to do it
[1:24:21] all the time yeah these are super
[1:24:24] Supernatural events that we can't dumb
[1:24:27] down with some kind of scientific proof
[1:24:30] this is God the miracle working God that
[1:24:33] we know he is providing for his children
[1:24:36] yes yes you are Lord providing a way
[1:24:38] that we can that we are all able to be
[1:24:41] able to be partakers of it look we know
[1:24:44] this very familiar uh scripture to First
[1:24:49] Kings I'm leaving off my notes now but
[1:24:51] first Kings chapter 17
[1:24:56] another story that falls exactly in in
[1:24:59] the same line that's what we're talking
[1:25:03] about First Kings 178 and the word of
[1:25:05] the Lord came unto him saying arise unto
[1:25:08] Elijah arise get to uh get thee to
[1:25:11] zarapa which belongeth to zidon and
[1:25:14] dwell there behold I have commanded a
[1:25:16] widow woman there to sustain thee so he
[1:25:19] arose and went to zarap and when he come
[1:25:21] to the gate of the city Behold a widow
[1:25:23] woman was was there Gathering of sticks
[1:25:26] and he called to her and said fetch me I
[1:25:29] pray thee a little water in a vessel
[1:25:30] that I may
[1:25:32] drink and as she was going to fetch it
[1:25:35] he called to her and said bring me I
[1:25:37] pray thee a morsel of bread in thine
[1:25:39] hand and she said as the as the Lord thy
[1:25:42] God liveth I have not a cake but a
[1:25:47] handful now my hand is fairly big it's
[1:25:50] probably bigger than hers was most men's
[1:25:53] hands are bigger than lady's hands she
[1:25:56] had a
[1:25:57] handful of meal in a barrel and a little
[1:26:01] oil in a crws and said behold I am
[1:26:04] Gathering two sticks that I may go in
[1:26:06] and dress it for me and my son that we
[1:26:08] may eat and
[1:26:10] die I got just enough meal for a cake
[1:26:13] for me and my son and just enough oil to
[1:26:16] make up that cake so that me and my son
[1:26:18] is going to be our last
[1:26:21] supper amen where have you heard that
[1:26:23] before
[1:26:24] it's going to be our last supper we're
[1:26:26] going to eat it we're going to die
[1:26:28] because that's all we have left nothing
[1:26:30] left amen Elijah said unto her fetch not
[1:26:35] uh F fear not go and do as thou has said
[1:26:38] but make me thereof a little cake first
[1:26:40] and bring it unto me and after make for
[1:26:43] thee and for thy son now that sounds
[1:26:45] kind of selfish but what God's doing to
[1:26:47] Elijah is trying to teach and help this
[1:26:49] woman learn obedience right amen if you
[1:26:52] do what is asked of you amen then I will
[1:26:57] take care of the rest amen it's like a
[1:27:01] it's like so many scriptures we quote
[1:27:04] often and sometimes we forget some of
[1:27:06] the more important parts of those
[1:27:08] scriptures like uh resist the devil and
[1:27:11] he'll flee from you well that sounds all
[1:27:13] great and good and it's true but you
[1:27:16] can't leave off the first part of that
[1:27:18] scripture that says submit yourselves
[1:27:21] therefore unto God right and if you
[1:27:24] don't submit yourself therefore unto God
[1:27:27] you can try to resist the devil all you
[1:27:29] want and it will do you no good that's
[1:27:31] right you must first submit yourself
[1:27:35] therefore unto God then you can resist
[1:27:38] the devil and he has to flee praise God
[1:27:42] you've got to take all of the scripture
[1:27:45] and when Elijah is telling this woman
[1:27:48] that to in in obedience to make me a
[1:27:51] cake first he's not being selfish right
[1:27:54] but he knows what God's going to do and
[1:27:57] he's testing her faith he's trying her
[1:28:00] faith is she going to do what the
[1:28:02] prophet is asking what God is asking and
[1:28:05] do this or is she going to be rebellious
[1:28:07] and say oh no no no no what's left over
[1:28:10] is going to be for me and my son no had
[1:28:14] to be
[1:28:16] obedient he said bring me one first then
[1:28:20] make for you in your sin in other words
[1:28:22] if you make me one there'll be enough
[1:28:24] for you and your
[1:28:26] son for thus sayith the Lord God of
[1:28:28] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[1:28:30] waste neither shall the cruise of oil
[1:28:32] fell until the day that the Lord sendeth
[1:28:34] rain on upon the Earth and she went and
[1:28:37] did according to the saying of Elijah
[1:28:40] and she and he and her house did eat
[1:28:43] many days and the barrel of the mill
[1:28:46] wasted not neither did the cruise of oil
[1:28:48] fell according to the word of the Lord
[1:28:50] which was spoke by Elijah right amen
[1:28:54] we got a pot of soup and we got a
[1:28:56] thousand people to feed it with what you
[1:28:58] going to do just keep dipping
[1:29:01] soup I have just enough meal and oil
[1:29:04] just for two people what you going to do
[1:29:06] I'm just going to keep dipping meal I'm
[1:29:09] just going to keep mixing mixing oil I'm
[1:29:11] just going to keep baking cakes amen and
[1:29:15] every time she went to that Barrel there
[1:29:17] was food there to cake every time she
[1:29:19] went to that cruise of oil there was oil
[1:29:21] there to make the cake with every time
[1:29:23] she needed it it was there to provide
[1:29:25] and they ate for many days her and her
[1:29:28] house and the oil never ran dry and the
[1:29:30] meal never ran out right praise God
[1:29:35] because God is the
[1:29:36] provider look friend the United States
[1:29:39] government is not your provider I might
[1:29:42] get in trouble saying that on on YouTube
[1:29:44] but they are not your provider God is
[1:29:47] your provider right your employer is not
[1:29:50] your provider God is your provider amen
[1:29:53] God will take take care of you
[1:29:54] regardless of anything else happens
[1:29:56] there's people in this message I don't
[1:29:58] techically agree with them brother R
[1:30:01] talked about concentration camps in
[1:30:03] Alaska a lot of people preach I've heard
[1:30:05] preachers preach that the bride's going
[1:30:06] to be stuck in concentration yet I don't
[1:30:09] particularly believe that brother Bram
[1:30:11] didn't say that amen he didn't say that
[1:30:14] like that anyway so I'm not trying to be
[1:30:16] contrary to brother brandham uh I'm
[1:30:19] trying to take what he said and apply it
[1:30:21] to the rest of the the word and the
[1:30:23] message scripturally to
[1:30:27] to to develop what I believe my faith
[1:30:31] and and my trust of what the word says
[1:30:34] Amen brother brandom says this bride
[1:30:36] doesn't go through a bunch of punishment
[1:30:38] right amen will there be some
[1:30:41] persecution at the end absolutely May
[1:30:43] there be some times around the world
[1:30:46] where there we there will be
[1:30:48] bride may not be everybody around the
[1:30:51] world but in certain parts of the world
[1:30:53] there may be bride that may end up in
[1:30:56] situations not necessar concentration
[1:30:58] camps but need an absolute miracle from
[1:31:01] God to be able to make it the next day
[1:31:03] the next week next month amen may not
[1:31:07] happen in this country I don't know
[1:31:09] right but that's up to God but
[1:31:11] regardless God's our provider yes
[1:31:14] regardless of what happens he will take
[1:31:16] care of us I mean how many stories have
[1:31:19] we heard I I get a flood of stories that
[1:31:21] come to my mind now I don't want I don't
[1:31:22] want to replicate them them all but or
[1:31:25] give them to you but uh how many stories
[1:31:28] you heard of of of of the provision of
[1:31:32] God like this
[1:31:35] amen story of people sitting down at the
[1:31:38] dinner I remember one in particular I'll
[1:31:41] say real quick sitting down at dinner
[1:31:43] and you've probably all heard it and I
[1:31:45] probably missed some of the details but
[1:31:47] uh am and his family they had nothing to
[1:31:49] eat they gathered around the table to
[1:31:51] eat their family dinner like they
[1:31:52] normally did and he said uh you know so
[1:31:56] and so bite your head to pray but
[1:31:57] there's no food what AM my blessing just
[1:32:00] pray me just pray and bless it pray it
[1:32:03] and bless it while there's in the middle
[1:32:05] of their prayer there's a knock at the
[1:32:06] door and somebody come with bags loads
[1:32:09] of groceries to give to
[1:32:12] them how do you explain that how do you
[1:32:15] reason that away how do you
[1:32:17] scientifically prove that that's just a
[1:32:21] miracle that's just God I was walking
[1:32:24] around this place and I was praying this
[1:32:26] morning like I always do and I I I just
[1:32:28] thank God I thank him all the time for
[1:32:30] it but I look and I even see this us
[1:32:33] getting this being here from where we
[1:32:35] were on Coro this is a
[1:32:37] miracle this is a miracle that God
[1:32:39] provided this everything that's here and
[1:32:42] everything that's done and everything
[1:32:43] that's given us is just a miracle that
[1:32:45] we have it so thankful I don't ever God
[1:32:49] help me ever want to be uh take for
[1:32:52] granted what God done for us amen what
[1:32:55] God's given us God's a miracle working
[1:32:57] God God's provider God will take care of
[1:32:59] us regardless of the circumstance or
[1:33:01] situation he's still God Amen he still
[1:33:05] does it I
[1:33:06] mean when I started looking at this
[1:33:09] friend there were absolutely no shortage
[1:33:11] of scriptures there was no shortage of
[1:33:14] stories there was no shortage of
[1:33:17] testimonies that I could give that that
[1:33:20] would give to
[1:33:22] you how God
[1:33:25] provides Abraham taking his son and God
[1:33:29] said take your son your only son right
[1:33:33] God that's what God told him to do go
[1:33:35] take your son your only son and go up to
[1:33:38] a place I'll show you a sacrifice him
[1:33:40] that's what God said well we know God
[1:33:43] doesn't accept human sacrifices so that
[1:33:45] you know but Abraham was
[1:33:48] there it's different when you look back
[1:33:51] and you think on things than it is when
[1:33:53] you're in the mid middle of it uh when
[1:33:56] you when you look out and you see a
[1:33:58] tornado headed right at you it's one
[1:34:00] thing but when you look back and you see
[1:34:03] the tornado's gone and it's it's done
[1:34:05] and over with that's a different story
[1:34:08] amen when you're in the middle of the
[1:34:10] Whirlwind it's a whole different story
[1:34:11] than looking back on something or or
[1:34:14] somebody saying well if it was me I
[1:34:16] would
[1:34:18] have that's okay I I that's fine I
[1:34:21] probably do that too yeah if I had been
[1:34:24] there if that if that was me I would
[1:34:26] have done so you do not know what you
[1:34:27] would do unless you're in that situation
[1:34:30] that's just the B to me that's my belief
[1:34:32] as the bottom line you don't know what
[1:34:34] you're going to do till you get to that
[1:34:35] somebody says I've heard people say oh
[1:34:37] if I get rich uh if I win the lottery or
[1:34:40] whatever it is first thing I'm G to do
[1:34:42] is pay my ties I think you do you pay
[1:34:44] them now
[1:34:46] right then you're probably not going to
[1:34:48] pay them
[1:34:49] then but you don't see people don't know
[1:34:52] they no no what you're going to do until
[1:34:54] they get in that situation amen but the
[1:34:59] understanding the faith to realize that
[1:35:01] God provides it it is a great Revelation
[1:35:06] that we have look going back to the
[1:35:08] Loaves and Fishes brother imperfect
[1:35:10] Faith a Critic once said that no wonder
[1:35:14] Jesus could take Five Loaves and five
[1:35:16] thou and feed 5,000 said the loaves were
[1:35:20] bigger in that day
[1:35:23] big enough one loaf to feed a thousand P
[1:35:28] people that loaf would be the size of my
[1:35:31] car and a boy is carrying around in his
[1:35:34] lunch
[1:35:36] pil no wonder he could feed 5,000 the
[1:35:39] loaves were bigger in that day he just
[1:35:42] cut each loaf to feed a thousand brother
[1:35:45] Brandon says I give you to understand
[1:35:47] that a little boy had it in his
[1:35:50] lunch a little child packed Five Loaves
[1:35:53] of bread that could beat 5,000 people
[1:35:56] and be full and that was again that's
[1:35:58] not counting the women and children let
[1:36:00] alone the 12 baskets they took up
[1:36:02] afterwards all the critics just always
[1:36:04] somebody critic somebody to criticize
[1:36:07] amen but it it has to be the faith see
[1:36:11] when Abraham took Isaac up there he
[1:36:13] didn't know what God was going to do he
[1:36:15] was in the middle of the hurricane he
[1:36:17] was in the middle of the tornado he was
[1:36:18] in the middle of the storm friend he
[1:36:21] didn't know what God was going to do all
[1:36:23] he knew is this is what God said he
[1:36:25] tried to obey it the best that he could
[1:36:27] and he took his son up there he bound
[1:36:29] him he got the altar he got the wood he
[1:36:31] got everything ready and was just about
[1:36:33] to take the knife to plunge into his
[1:36:35] son's throat and God stopped him an
[1:36:38] angel called from heaven and said
[1:36:40] Abraham Abraham Abraham said yeah I'm
[1:36:42] I'm right here he said don't hurt your
[1:36:45] boy
[1:36:47] amen that God's providing himself don't
[1:36:50] hurt him amen you have now proed that
[1:36:53] you you will not withhold anything from
[1:36:55] me not even your only son the son of
[1:36:58] promise and as he was hearing that voice
[1:37:01] he heard a crackle in the thicket behind
[1:37:04] you and he turned around and there's a
[1:37:05] ram right there stuck in the thicket
[1:37:08] goes over against the lamb sacrifices
[1:37:10] them and they go back
[1:37:11] home
[1:37:13] amen God providing God always provides
[1:37:18] when how many times in Samson's life
[1:37:21] Samson had the strength but one time he
[1:37:24] had thousands of soldiers with helmets
[1:37:27] and in Stick coming at him he looked
[1:37:30] around and found an old dried up jaw B
[1:37:32] Jawbone of a of a mule and he beat down
[1:37:36] and cracked the helmets of thousand of
[1:37:38] them with the Jawbone of of a of a mule
[1:37:43] thousand of them oh it the Bible says it
[1:37:47] was a new Jawbone but obviously it had
[1:37:50] been decayed down to the point that it
[1:37:52] was just bone
[1:37:54] right he beat a thousand of them with
[1:37:57] one
[1:37:58] Jawbone you think that was Samson that
[1:38:02] was God Amen but it was God in Samson
[1:38:06] remember don't forget that part that is
[1:38:08] the most important part friend yes God
[1:38:11] does it but God does it through us God
[1:38:14] uses us Amen to do his work God uses us
[1:38:19] our our spiritual Acuity our spiritual
[1:38:22] ears need to be uh in tune to listen to
[1:38:25] what God wants to wants to tell us where
[1:38:28] God wants to send us what God wants us
[1:38:30] to do and make sure it's God Amen
[1:38:33] because the devil speaks too and you
[1:38:35] don't want to go uh down that road that
[1:38:38] road leads you in a wrong place but when
[1:38:41] God's speaking amen my sheep hear my
[1:38:43] voice they know my voice amen they'll
[1:38:46] follow me they won't follow anybody else
[1:38:49] they don't listen when the devil speaks
[1:38:50] they don't listen but they know my voice
[1:38:53] my my sheep know my voice you you you
[1:38:56] know his voice when he
[1:38:59] speaks then you do what he asks amen we
[1:39:02] try to follow with the spirit as God
[1:39:05] gives it to us Amen to be led by his
[1:39:08] Spirit I'm going to close here
[1:39:16] Philippians amen I had several of the
[1:39:19] scriptures I was going to read but I
[1:39:21] think I think we've got
[1:39:24] the point the place we're at
[1:39:26] scripturally and and I'm sure as so many
[1:39:30] times I know it's so many times it
[1:39:32] happens happens to me when the ministry
[1:39:35] is going forth there's probably stories
[1:39:37] in your mind that you know when God took
[1:39:39] care of you when God provided for you
[1:39:43] whether it was monetary whether it was
[1:39:45] spiritual whether it was Financial
[1:39:48] whether it was emotional whether it was
[1:39:50] mental uh whatever the condition
[1:39:54] whether it was something you needed
[1:39:55] maybe it's something you need to get rid
[1:39:56] of maybe it was uh a provision whatever
[1:40:00] it was I mean maybe like my kid you're
[1:40:04] falling down out of a tree when you're a
[1:40:05] little kid and you're just sailing
[1:40:07] backwards just waiting for this thud or
[1:40:09] whatever's going to happen and and

[1:40:29] 10 12 year old boy how do you make that
[1:40:33] up it just it just doesn't happen and
[1:40:36] you know how many times there's things
[1:40:38] in your life I know that you're thinking
[1:40:39] about them amen you're remembering times
[1:40:42] when God provided for you when God
[1:40:45] performed a miracle when God took care
[1:40:47] of you when God provided amen God does
[1:40:51] Philippians Now read this we'll close
