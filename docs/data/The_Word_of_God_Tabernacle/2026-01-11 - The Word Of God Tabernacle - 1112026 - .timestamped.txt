[0:55] Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, Father,
[0:58] so very thankful again for another
[1:00] beautiful day that you've given us.
[1:01] Thank you for your grace and your mercy,

[1:08] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:10] perish, Lord, but have everlasting life,
[1:13] Lord. That's the life that we have.
[1:15] That's the life that we're looking to,
[1:16] God, believing in, Father. that because

[2:33] We're going to go over to Psalm number
[2:35] 543 in the book. We'll have it on the

[2:41] Praise the Lord. A wonderful way to
[2:44] start a new year. Amen. Is to desire to

[2:57] him now.
[3:00] I want more of Jesus,
[3:03] more and more and more.
[3:07] I want more of Jesus than I've ever had
[3:11] before.

[4:53] him can come in and be a part of our
[4:55] lives. Praise the Lord. Amen. You know,
[4:58] we're just human beings. There's only so
[5:00] much we can handle. There's only so much
[5:02] we can take. Praise the Lord. So, if
[5:04] that's that's the case, then I want as
[5:07] much of him as I can get.

[5:41] When I wake up in the morning, when I
[5:44] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.

[5:52] I am blessed.
[5:56] I am blessed.
[5:58] So every day that I live, I am blessed.

[6:19] blessed.
[6:21] Oh, every day that I live, I am blessed.
[6:27] When I wake up in the morning, when I

[6:36] I am blessed. Sing it like you mean it
[6:38] now. I am blessed. Hallelujah. I am

[6:44] So every day that I live, I am blessed.
[6:50] When I wake up in the morning, when I

[7:07] Yes. Every day that I live, I am
[7:11] blessed.
[7:14] When I wake up in the morning, when I
[7:17] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.
[7:22] I am blessed.
[7:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm so glad the
[7:30] Lord blesses us. The Lord gives us all
[7:32] the blessings that we can contain. Amen.
[7:35] And so much more than we deserve.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for his blessings to us.
[7:41] Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[7:45] Amen. Psalm number 340.
[7:49] Amen. This one I could not find on the
[7:52] screen. So, uh, we're going to have our
[7:55] book on this one. It's easy. Amen. It's
[7:57] a simple course that we have. Amen. That
[8:00] we probably all know. I just thought it
[8:01] was a good way and looking for some
[8:04] songs. Good way to start a new year.
[8:08] Just to be thankful to the Lord.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord to be thankful to
[8:12] him. What a wonderful year the Lord gave
[8:14] us last year. There was ups, there was
[8:17] downs. I know sometimes it seems like
[8:19] the downs outweigh the ups, but God is
[8:22] always faithful in all of it. Praise the
[8:24] Lord. Whatever we do, it seems like it's
[8:26] humanity though, we always fixate on the
[8:28] bad.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we, you know, you can have 10
[8:32] blessings and one bad thing and we'll
[8:34] always think about the bad thing all the
[8:36] time and all the time and all the time.
[8:38] God's been here and says, "I've been
[8:40] here the whole time."
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, it's means a
[8:44] lot to have a positive attitude, to be
[8:46] positive about everything regardless.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Whatever the Lord does, we know that he
[8:50] does according to his perfect will. And
[8:52] we want Amen. him to continue to bless
[8:55] us according to that perfect will. So
[8:58] Jesus, I just want to thank you. Amen.
[9:01] Jesus, I just want to thank you. Praise
[9:04] the Lord. 340 in the song book here.
[9:06] Amen.
[9:09] Jesus,
[9:11] we just want to thank you.
[9:18] Jesus,
[9:19] we just want to thank
[9:24] you,
[9:26] Jesus.
[9:29] We just want to thank you.
[9:36] Thank you for being
[9:40] so good.
[9:45] And Jesus,
[9:47] we just want to serve you,
[9:54] Jesus.
[9:56] We just want to serve
[10:01] you,
[10:03] Jesus.
[10:05] We just want to serve you.
[10:12] Yes. Serve you. Cuz you are so good.
[10:22] And Jesus,
[10:24] we just want to praise you.
[10:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[10:31] Yes, Jesus.
[10:34] We just want to praise
[10:38] you,
[10:41] Jesus.
[10:43] We just want to praise you.
[10:50] Praise you for being
[10:54] so good.
[10:58] Yes, Jesus. Oh, let's thank him again.
[11:02] We just want to thank you,
[11:09] Jesus.
[11:11] We just want to thank
[11:15] you,
[11:18] Jesus.
[11:20] We just want to thank you.
[11:27] Thank you for being
[11:31] so good. Let's make it personal to him
[11:35] now. Jesus,
[11:39] I just want to thank you,
[11:46] Jesus.
[11:48] I just want to thank
[11:53] you,
[11:55] Jesus.
[11:57] I just want to thank you.
[12:05] Thank you for being
[12:09] so good.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. God is so good,
[12:18] isn't he?
[12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is so good to us. I just
[12:22] thank him. Praise him.
[12:24] He's been so good to us, saints. Amen.
[12:27] With everything he does, everything he
[12:29] gives, all that he is. Amen. We bless
[12:32] him and praise him. Amen. We honor him.
[12:35] We glorify him.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Not because we're expecting something in
[12:40] return.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Not because we're uh thinking he's going
[12:43] to do something for us, but we do it
[12:46] because of who he is.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the Lord of glory. He is God
[12:50] Almighty. Amen. There is none like him.
[12:53] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[12:57] Go to the Lord in prayer now. Take us
[12:59] these prayer requests. Amen. There's a
[13:02] few to mention that we have that uh I
[13:05] know about today. Uh Sister Sheileia had
[13:08] text me earlier around 9:00 or so and
[13:11] said that she had had a bad nose bleed
[13:13] and uh she was trying to get it stopped
[13:15] but didn't know if she would in time. Uh
[13:18] but she's not here. So assuming that she
[13:20] stayed a halt. Amen. To dream. So, if
[13:23] you're home with Sister Sheily, God
[13:24] bless you. Praying for you, just trust
[13:27] in the Lord. Stop that. She said she's
[13:29] had them since she's a little girl and
[13:32] uh had trouble with them off and on uh
[13:34] her life. So, we're just believing the
[13:36] Lord just touch and heal it. Also,
[13:38] Brother Dennis um his surgery the other
[13:41] day, I think as I sent to you, went
[13:43] well. The doctor was happy with it, but
[13:46] uh he's thinking the doctor is thinking
[13:48] he's going to need another one or two
[13:50] procedures. I don't know if it's
[13:52] necessarily surgery, but I guess if
[13:54] somebody's cutting on you, it's surgery.
[13:56] Uh but uh they're thinking maybe one or
[13:58] two. I'm thinking none, but uh we'll see
[14:01] whether what the Lord does for brother
[14:04] Dennis in this situation. And brother
[14:05] Dennis just tired and he wants to go
[14:07] home. He wants to come back to church.
[14:09] Uh so let's just continue to hold
[14:11] Brother Dennis up in prayer. Uh the Lord
[14:13] would just bless him. He of course I've
[14:15] never known anybody that does, but he
[14:18] hates being in the hospital. Uh again, I
[14:21] anybody's ever wanted to be in the
[14:22] hospital or like being in the hospital.
[14:24] So, but uh just pray for him if you
[14:26] would to continue to pray for him. Uh
[14:28] also, Mike is going to be traveling back
[14:30] today. So, please remember him in
[14:32] prayer. He's supposed to get into town
[14:34] about 8:30 tonight. He said most of the
[14:36] time that flight's late, but you never
[14:38] know. But he's supposed to come in
[14:40] traveling tonight. So, just pray the
[14:41] Lord bless him and grant him traveling
[14:43] mercies. Uh also, Sister Shri text me uh
[14:47] earlier and said that Art was not
[14:48] feeling well last night. I think I sent
[14:50] the text out to everyone uh as he's not
[14:53] here. I'm assuming he's still not
[14:54] feeling well today. So, we just remember
[14:57] our prayer the Lord would just bless.
[14:59] And also, I did not put in the text last
[15:01] night, but Sharia had a request in that
[15:03] text that she sent to me that uh her and
[15:07] the children not get what he has, which
[15:09] I can understand a lot of times in the
[15:11] same small space. Um it happens almost
[15:14] invariably, but the Lord can protect
[15:17] that. Amen. can stop that and keep it
[15:19] from spreading to them. So, we're just
[15:21] trusting that he does. You know, Brother
[15:23] Hart works very hard for his family and
[15:25] I know the job he does is not an easy
[15:27] job. and he's getting older. And uh I I
[15:31] I could even tell it myself, you know,
[15:33] when you when you continue to keep
[15:35] working that hard every week and your
[15:37] body starts breaking down, you get older
[15:39] and your immune system's not quite up to
[15:41] speed anymore like it used to and you
[15:44] just uh things just seem to get you more
[15:47] often than they used to. So uh let's
[15:50] just pray for brother Art that God would
[15:51] just bless and touch him. Amen. It's
[15:53] good to see each one of you here. Is Tom
[15:55] back home yet? busy. Amen. So the Lord,
[15:59] I guess, gave them a safe successful
[16:00] trip.
[16:02] Amen. So thankful the Lord blessed Tom
[16:04] and Tommy as they went went hunting and
[16:06] went back to the mountains and just
[16:08] thankful to have them back.
[16:11] Praise the Lord. Want to remember Danny
[16:12] in prayer. I saw him uh at the hospital
[16:14] the other day. I went to visit brother
[16:16] Dan uh brother Dennis. Brother Danny was
[16:18] there but I don't see him this morning.
[16:21] So and I haven't heard from him. So
[16:22] please remember him in prayer as well.
[16:25] Also, of course, one of the team member
[16:26] brother, sister Pat prayer. Amen. So,
[16:31] anyone else have a spoken request on
[16:33] your heart?
[16:34] &gt;&gt; I request it, but I'll say
[16:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, sister. I missed it. I was I
[16:38] was fiddling with that thing. I couldn't
[16:40] get it to work. I finally got it to
[16:41] work, though. So, I'm sorry about that.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Um, remember Daniel's sister,
[16:50] the trial
[16:52] we start again tomorrowing the
[16:59] what happened.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, sister Nor was asking uh
[17:06] Daniel's sister.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Shirley uh in prayer, the court
[17:10] situation coming of the death of her
[17:11] son. So, let's please remember that.
[17:13] Shirley, Daniel, again, I keep
[17:16] mentioning it, but if you've forgotten,
[17:18] Daniel is the one who made the pull pit
[17:20] for us. So, uh, and is married to, uh,
[17:23] sister Norma's daughter Kathy. Uh, so
[17:26] please remember Shirley, his sister in
[17:28] prayer, uh, that court issue that's
[17:31] going on there. Amen. Anyone else have a
[17:34] request?
[17:35] Yes,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; I forgive me for not writing it down.
[17:39] But um I'm supposed to have the biopsy
[17:41] on my plan on Tuesday and they're
[17:44] supposed to get the results right away
[17:46] and then send them over to the ENT. But
[17:50] um I know that God is no respector of
[17:52] persons. And if Sister Sonia didn't have
[17:54] to have the surgery on her foot,
[17:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to have the surgery on my
[17:58] face. Amen.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; And that is what I am believing. Pise
[18:01] the Lord.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; It's all going to be benign. It's going
[18:04] to be fine and it's going to go away.
[18:06] And that's my confession. Yes. Praise
[18:08] the Lord. Amen. We certainly still
[18:11] uphold Sister Julian prayer for that
[18:13] Tuesday. You have a time Tuesday.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Um I have to be there at 9:50.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; So 9:50 10:00. So let's remember sister
[18:20] Julian that uh Tuesday 10:00 is remember
[18:24] that and pray up to that point too.
[18:27] Amen. Once you get to that then all will
[18:29] be well. So praise the Lord. Anyone else
[18:34] have unspoken request
[18:37] knows all of our hearts and needs to
[18:38] stand to our feet if we could
[18:43] just take the Lord trust the Lord each
[18:46] one of them today is mindful he ever
[18:50] moved for you in the past that you can
[18:52] confess to confess the Lord has moved
[18:54] for you in the past if he's done it
[18:56] before he's still the same God
[18:59] just believe in that before each other,
[19:01] Lord Jesus. Father, as we come to you
[19:03] again, Lord, with your to your throne of
[19:06] grace and mercy boldly, Lord, with these
[19:09] petitions, these situations, Lord,
[19:11] that's been brought before us and the
[19:12] things that's on our hearts, God, that
[19:14] we believe in true know that you, God,
[19:16] are more than able to move upon every
[19:18] request and need and these situations,
[19:21] Father, these sicknesses. And God, we
[19:23] just trust in you, Lord, for every one
[19:25] of them. You are our high priest that is
[19:27] touched by the feeling of our
[19:28] infirmities, Lord. And you asked us to
[19:31] ask, Father. So, we are truly with all
[19:33] of our hearts with faith, believing,
[19:35] asking, God, for these requests and
[19:37] needs, Lord, for each one of them, Lord.
[19:39] Our precious saints that aren't here
[19:41] with us today, God. We miss them so much
[19:43] when they're not with us, Lord. And but
[19:45] God, we're just trusting, believing
[19:46] somehow for some purpose, reason. Lord,
[19:49] you have everything under control. You
[19:50] make all things work together for our
[19:53] good, Lord. We trust that, believe that,
[19:55] and know that to be the truth. We've
[19:57] experienced it so many times in our
[19:59] lives, Lord. Lord, may you reach out,
[20:01] God, to each one of these requests.
[20:03] Again, Lord, let it be made known to
[20:05] them, Lord, in their heart by faith
[20:07] today. Sister Sheilia, Lord, with this
[20:09] nosebleleed, God, I'm believing, Father,
[20:11] you've already stopped it for her, Lord.
[20:13] And, uh, bring her back to perfect
[20:15] healing and deliverance from that of
[20:17] Brother Dennis with his foot, Lord. God,
[20:19] it's just been a long time that Brother
[20:21] Dennis had been dealing with this thing,
[20:22] God. But Lord, we're just praying again.
[20:25] We're still believing. We're upholding
[20:27] him. We're keeping him before you, Lord.
[20:29] Keeping him before your throne of grace,
[20:31] God, that Lord, your healing virtue is
[20:34] on him, Lord. Even now, God, where he's
[20:36] laying in that hospital, that that
[20:38] healing virtue is flow through his body
[20:40] to heal that foot completely, perfectly,
[20:44] normally. God, may the doctors look at
[20:46] it and be confounded with how well that
[20:49] is healing and coming forth. Lord, that
[20:51] no more surgery, no more procedures will
[20:53] be make will be necessary, God. Bless
[20:56] him and keep his spirits up, Lord, and
[20:58] help encourage him, God, along the way.
[21:00] It can be very discouraging, Lord,
[21:02] especially in the times we're home or

[21:16] them, Lord. The Pats, God, it's been a
[21:18] while since they've been with us, Lord.
[21:20] I know it's been tough for them and
[21:21] physically and but God, we know that you
[21:24] are more than able to continue to move
[21:26] upon their hearts and lives to bring
[21:27] strength and healing and blessing to
[21:30] their bodies, oh God. Lord, I'm
[21:32] expecting any time, Father, that would
[21:34] be with us once again in service, Lord.

[21:39] done for us. Pray that you'd help Micah,
[21:41] Lord, be with him, Lord, and grant
[21:44] traveling mercies to him. Bring it back
[21:45] home safe, Lord. And just look forward
[21:47] to being with him again. Uh Lord, this
[21:50] week and Sunday, next Sunday service,
[21:53] God, we just thank you, Lord, that we

[22:22] and with the passing of death of her
[22:24] son. Lord, I don't know all about it,
[22:27] Lord, but you do, God. And I pray that
[22:29] you'd move on her behalf in this
[22:31] situation. Move on the judge, the
[22:33] jurors, whatever it may be, God, that it
[22:36] be a found a favorable thing for her,
[22:38] for Daniel, for that family, God. Lord,

[22:45] situation, every uh um un unspoken
[22:49] request, God, move upon our families and
[22:52] our famil family's lives, Lord. We just
[22:54] look and desire for our families to be
[22:56] saved, God. We just want to spend
[22:58] eternity with our families, Lord. We
[23:00] don't want to see anybody go to hell,
[23:02] Lord. But God, our families, Lord, our
[23:04] loved ones, we love so much, God. We
[23:07] want to be able to spend eternity with
[23:08] them, God. our precious brothers and

[24:05] these songs we know. Amen. But I like to

[24:10] to worship for one thing. Amen. You
[24:13] don't have to be concentrated on a book

[24:16] here and your hands are free and worship
[24:18] and lift them and clap them and Amen.

[24:23] that's really the biggest reason I have

[24:27] anything because we got a book. We got I
[24:29] mean pretty much all the songs I sing.
[24:30] I'm not a song leader. So all the songs
[24:32] I know usually and sing are in here. So
[24:35] or maybe in the Burgundy book or
[24:36] something. So, but u have it here so we
[24:39] can uh uh just worship and praise the
[24:41] Lord. Amen. Just a closer walk. That our
[24:44] desire today.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Just a closer walk. Lord, let it be to

[24:50] A closer walk with you. One day we're
[24:53] going to walk so close to him, saints,
[24:54] and we'll just start walking up.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Won't be that slow. Amen. It'll be in a
[24:59] twinkling of an eye. Twinkling of an
[25:01] eye. But amen. as we walk with him,
[25:04] we're going to walk right up into glory
[25:05] with him one day. Amen. Praise the Lord.

[26:23] this world of PS and snares.
[26:30] If
[26:32] I fall to Lord who cares,
[26:39] who

[27:56] me gently, safely, oh
[28:03] to thy kingom
[28:06] shore, to thy shore
[28:12] and just

[28:22] Granted

[28:51] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, let it be, Lord God. Let it be to
[28:56] us, Lord Jesus. A closer walk to him.
[29:00] Amen. We've already found out. We sang
[29:03] the song earlier today. We want more of
[29:05] him. Closer walk with him. How do we do
[29:09] it? Give him more of us. Amen.
[29:13] Give him more of our lives. Give him
[29:15] more of our abilities. Give him more of
[29:17] our time. give him more of anything,
[29:19] everything we can give him. Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Just to have a closer walk with the Lord
[29:26] Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord. I pray
[29:30] that's all of our desires today. Amen.
[29:32] Thank you, Jesus. Amen. And before they
[29:35] change the order of the service, anyone
[29:37] have a testimony, song or something on
[29:39] your heart you'd like to give?
[29:44] Amen.
[29:47] Praise the Lord. If not, we'll just
[29:48] stand to our feet. Amen. Just uh bless
[29:51] the Lord.
[29:53] Bless us today.
[29:58] Amen. Bless us the reading and the
[30:01] ministering of the word.
[30:04] Trust him in all things. Praise the
[30:06] Lord.
[30:08] Amen. Let's turn over again. We're going
[30:11] to go back to Ephesians chapter 4. Amen.
[30:14] We're going to begin our reading here
[30:15] again. Ephesians chapter 4. We're still
[30:17] on adoption. Amen. But I just kind of
[30:19] cut out the reading of the adoption
[30:22] scripture. We read it quite a bit
[30:25] anyway. So, we understand we're there at
[30:28] that time in the adoption and adoption
[30:30] series. We just got a few more left
[30:32] here. Amen. We finish this up. I've got
[30:35] uh several things that uh after this I
[30:38] want to try to get to and minister. So,
[30:42] but I want to get through this, finish
[30:44] this. We got a few on the next one,
[30:46] which is pastors. Amen. This is the next
[30:49] uh one that was in the line that we had
[30:51] here in Ephesians 4:11. Uh pastors is
[30:54] the next one. So, we have a few u uh uh
[30:58] on that. Pastors is an extremely
[31:00] important position uh in the body. you
[31:03] remember is the thumb that kind of holds
[31:05] kind of I I guess it' be brother Brown
[31:08] said he said it kind of brings them all
[31:11] together to give a weapon to fight the
[31:12] devil with but I guess that's kind of
[31:14] what you call the glue that holds it all
[31:16] together maybe I don't know amen is that
[31:18] thumb that pastor praise the Lord so uh
[31:22] we'll probably take a few services on
[31:24] that but uh we want to go over to
[31:26] Ephesians as I said chapter 4 we're
[31:28] going to begin reading with verse 11.
[31:33] Amen. Ephesians 4:11.
[31:36] Amen. We'll read those few verses of
[31:39] scripture again as we get into this uh
[31:43] subject on the pastor. This is adoption
[31:45] part 36, five-fold ministry part nine.
[31:49] And then this be I guess you could say
[31:51] part one of pastors. So, but before we
[31:53] read, let's just bow our heads for a
[31:54] word of prayer if we could. Lord Jesus,
[31:56] again, so very thankful, Father, again,
[31:59] that you bless us with this beautiful
[32:00] day, Lord, at this time to come in from
[32:03] in this service, Lord, and just open the
[32:05] pages of this Bible and expect you to
[32:07] speak to us once again. Lord, you we
[32:10] know that, God, in your word that it
[32:12] says that, Lord, you are faithful to us,
[32:15] God. We we work to try our lives to be
[32:19] faithful to you and all that we do.
[32:21] Lord, in everything that we say, every
[32:23] place that we go, Lord, as we s the
[32:26] song, just a closer walk, Lord, help us,
[32:29] God, by the reading of this word. And I
[32:32] know it's a specific subject, Lord, on
[32:34] adoption, on pastors.
[32:37] I know it runs a specific line, but
[32:39] Lord, every bit of your word is
[32:41] inspired. Every bit of it is is to us,
[32:45] Lord. It's your love letter to us to
[32:47] help us and to bless and strengthen us,
[32:50] Lord. So, let it be so today, God. No
[32:52] matter how many times we've read this,
[32:54] no matter how many times we've gone over
[32:56] or seen this, Lord, or even preached it
[32:59] or heard it, Lord, God, may it be
[33:01] something that would just come new and
[33:04] fresh to us today and anchor to our
[33:06] hearts and draw us closer to you some
[33:09] way somehow, God, through this word,
[33:11] Lord. And we believe God if your spirit
[33:13] is here, if your holy spirit is here
[33:16] God, then it will absolutely, Lord,
[33:18] brood over us and allow that word to
[33:20] come into our hearts and lives and
[33:23] strengthen and bless us and encourage us
[33:26] and inform us, Lord, and help us to know
[33:29] where we're standing living in this day
[33:31] time, God, that you've given us. Lord,
[33:34] we thank you so much, God, that you've
[33:36] blessed and helped us. and we just
[33:37] commit ourselves into your hands and
[33:40] pray that you'd bless the remaining part
[33:41] of this service. Lord, open my mouth to
[33:43] that that you have to be said, close it
[33:45] to anything that would be contrary to
[33:47] your will to be said today. May you
[33:49] anoint our ears to receive it and may
[33:52] every bit of it be according to your
[33:53] perfect will. Let it not return void.
[33:56] Accomplish it that we come into this
[33:58] place today to meet with you, Lord, for
[34:00] looking God for the accomplishment of
[34:03] what you would have to do for us in this
[34:05] place today. something that we need,
[34:08] Lord, as we walk out that door, God,
[34:10] that we need, God, in our lives as we
[34:13] continue to press this battle through,
[34:14] Lord, through another week, Lord, just
[34:16] bless us here now. We commit it to you.
[34:18] Ask your blessings again on the name of
[34:20] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Ephesians 4:11.
[34:27] Let's just read here.
[34:29] And he gave some apostles and some
[34:31] prophets and some evangelists and some
[34:32] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[34:35] of the saints, for the work of the
[34:36] ministry, for the edifying of the body
[34:38] of Christ, till we all come in the unity
[34:41] of the faith and knowledge of the Son of
[34:42] God into a perfect man and to the
[34:44] measure of the stature of the fullness
[34:46] of Christ. And you can be seated if
[34:48] you'd like.
[34:50] Amen.
[34:55] Praise the Lord.
[34:58] Pardon me.
[35:00] Got some congestion there. Can't just
[35:02] seem to kick. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[35:05] today, as we just read through, we're
[35:07] going to start on uh the subject of
[35:10] pastors
[35:11] uh and and and the scriptural reference
[35:15] and the scriptural precedent of pastors
[35:17] that we have and the things that has
[35:19] been said in the scripture about pastors
[35:22] and and what it is uh to be a pastor,
[35:25] what a p a pastor's position is supposed
[35:27] to fulfill, uh uh the type of character,
[35:31] the type of person that a pastor is
[35:33] supposed to be. and uh the the the
[35:36] things that the Lord gives him, equips
[35:38] him with to be able to be a pastor.
[35:40] Amen. Because it's a a very unique
[35:43] situation. It's a very unique calling.
[35:45] Uh I'll just uh read this quote that
[35:48] brother Brandham said about pastors and
[35:50] maybe help us a little bit here. God
[35:52] doesn't call a man judgment without
[35:53] first warning him. 1963 he says, "But
[35:56] you see in the church there is a pastor
[36:00] and that pastor is a special person."
[36:02] And I remember we've read all the ones
[36:05] that he talked about of each office and
[36:07] each one he's called prophets and
[36:09] evangelists and p everyone is a special
[36:12] man, a special person. Brother Brown
[36:14] calls each one a special person. Amen.
[36:17] He's built Amen. The pastor is built to
[36:20] where he can put up with the fusses of
[36:22] the people. He's a burdenbearer. He's
[36:25] the ox of the team. He's a man that can
[36:28] sit down uh when somebody's got
[36:30] something against somebody else and sit
[36:32] down with them two families, take
[36:34] neither side and reason it out and bring
[36:37] it right back into sweetness and love
[36:40] again. He's a pastor. A and a pastor
[36:43] knows how to take care of these things.
[36:45] No, a pastor I don't want to be contrary
[36:47] to brother Brown. A pastor doesn't
[36:49] necessarily know how to take care of
[36:50] those things, but the pastor should be
[36:53] anointed of the Holy Spirit who does
[36:55] know how to take care of those things.
[36:57] And trusting that what the Lord speaks
[36:58] to him is what is what is supposed to be
[37:02] done is the gift. Again, remember in
[37:05] every one of these situations, in every
[37:07] one of these offices, it's the gift that
[37:09] God operates in the person's life, in
[37:11] the man's life. It's the gift that God
[37:13] operates like we said with the prophets
[37:16] and with the evangelists and God builds
[37:18] them the way he wants them to be and has
[37:20] the characteristics that they have. Uh
[37:23] but uh and remember what he talked about
[37:25] an evangelist evangelist an evangelist
[37:28] can't feel this position because an
[37:30] evangelist always wants to just keep
[37:31] going. An evangelist has a burning
[37:34] spirit. He has a burning nature. He
[37:36] wants to keep going. He wants to burn
[37:37] the trails up. He wants to come in and
[37:39] burn the hide off of people. Well, uh,
[37:42] people who need consoling and who need,
[37:45] uh, comforting don't need the hide tore
[37:47] off of them. That they need to be
[37:49] comforted. They need to be encouraged.
[37:51] They need to be strengthened. Amen. And
[37:53] God gives that, uh, through that gift.
[37:56] Amen. Not the man, uh, not the not the
[38:00] individual. God will bring that man
[38:02] through experiences and through life
[38:04] lessons to bring them to this position.
[38:06] But it's the gift of each one. It's the
[38:09] gift of prophecy in the man. It's the
[38:11] gift of the evangelist. It's the gift of
[38:13] pastor that God puts in this person.
[38:16] Amen. So that gift is the gift that God
[38:18] operates to be able to bring about what
[38:21] we just read that brother man talked
[38:22] about. The burden bearer. He's the
[38:24] person that's the ox of the team. He's
[38:26] the one that helps uh keep people
[38:28] together, keep in a loving uh atmosphere
[38:31] and uh uh keep the the care of the
[38:35] people and all that goes on uh is in
[38:37] that position of that one. I guess
[38:39] that's maybe why he's the thumb that
[38:41] brings the kind of again uh as I could
[38:44] say the glue that kind of brings it and
[38:46] holds it all together is is the pastor
[38:49] in that position. And for some reason,
[38:51] as uh most people don't want to be uh
[38:55] the burden bearer,
[38:58] most people don't want to be an ax. Most
[39:00] people don't want to most people don't
[39:03] want to have those burdens heaped up on
[39:05] them. And it seems like for some reason,
[39:07] uh most men out there who feel they have
[39:10] a call want to be a pastor. I don't know
[39:12] why. Um it's not an easy job. People
[39:15] say, "Why yeah, it's get up there and
[39:18] preach every Sunday or whatever." I
[39:19] said, "Well, yeah, if if ministering is
[39:22] all there was to it, this be the best
[39:23] thing in the world. If all I had to do
[39:26] is show up on Sunday morning or
[39:27] something and preach a service and go
[39:29] home and be done, that that'd be the
[39:31] greatest thing in the world." But uh
[39:34] that that is the smallest portion of all
[39:36] of it uh that God all lots to a pastor
[39:39] that has uh people under his care. And
[39:42] it can be one person. It could be a
[39:44] thousand people. But the burden of that
[39:46] person, those people is still on that
[39:48] pastor. If he's a real pastor, amen. If
[39:51] he's real, God called anointed pastor,
[39:54] that's going to be his desire. That's
[39:56] going to be in his heart. That's going
[39:57] to be his life. Cuz see, the pastor's a
[39:59] shepherd of the local flock. The the
[40:02] pastor's a shepherd of the local flock
[40:04] flock to feed and to tend to the sheep.
[40:07] Uh that that's his position to do. See,
[40:11] all of our lives aren't our lives. But
[40:14] the the pastor shares his life and gives
[40:17] himself over should more than any other
[40:20] calling, more than any other of these
[40:22] five ministering gifts. Uh the pastor
[40:25] gives himself over more than anybody
[40:27] else does. And sometimes it it becomes a
[40:31] detriment, especially when it's uh in a
[40:34] position of someone who's not a child of
[40:36] God. uh a person can use that to hurt
[40:39] that individual or to say things about
[40:41] that person or to ruin that person's
[40:43] character in some way. Uh so it's not
[40:45] always easy, but God always sees to it
[40:48] to make sure that he calls that man to a
[40:51] position and he gives people for that uh
[40:55] for that man to feed, for that man to
[40:57] tend to, for that shepherd to be able to
[41:00] take care of. And that's what a pastor
[41:02] does. A pastor is a the shepherd of the
[41:05] local flock under the great shepherd,
[41:07] our God. Uh we are under God. We are all
[41:10] under God. He's the great shepherd. But
[41:12] we are the shepherds. The pastors are
[41:14] the shepherds of the local flocks to
[41:17] feed that local flock to tend to that
[41:20] local flock that God gives them. You
[41:22] say, "What's the local flock?" Well,
[41:25] uh, Brother Ram talked about
[41:26] neighborhood, but, uh, to me, that local
[41:29] flock is those that God calls to that
[41:31] assembly, those that God calls to be
[41:34] under that pastor. God, those that God
[41:37] calls to be a part of that church, those
[41:40] are the ones that God puts him in charge
[41:42] of, in charge of the care of, those are
[41:44] the ones that God's looking to that man
[41:47] to help those people in whatever
[41:49] capacity is necessary. That's why we've
[41:52] said before, we've talked about
[41:54] ministers. God will call different
[41:56] people to be under different ministries
[41:57] for different reasons.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Be be a people are in in a certain
[42:02] situation in their lives. Maybe they're
[42:05] in a certain position in their walk with
[42:07] the Lord. Maybe they need a certain type
[42:09] of ministry or pastoring to to bring
[42:12] that person along to continue on in the
[42:14] growth of the Lord. There's all
[42:16] different reasons why God will call
[42:18] somebody. That's why you don't just go
[42:20] because your mom and daddy goes. You
[42:22] don't just go because the person's a
[42:24] good speaker. You don't just go because
[42:27] this these people seem to be a little
[42:30] more active and a little more lively and
[42:32] and you don't go for those superficial
[42:34] reasons.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; You go to a church because God called
[42:38] you to that church. When God calls you
[42:41] to that church and calls you to sit
[42:43] under that ministry, that ministry,
[42:45] that's the that's the man that God has
[42:48] to be your pastor, to be your shepherd.
[42:50] That's why God calls for that purpose
[42:53] and reason. And that's the only reason
[42:55] you should go to a church. The only
[42:57] reason you should go to a specific
[42:59] church, I should say, is because God
[43:02] calls you there. Someone says, "Well,
[43:04] nobody's called me. I I I don't feel
[43:06] God's called me." Ask the wife. If you
[43:08] don't feel God's called you to a place,
[43:10] then I would certainly get down on my
[43:12] knees and pray and ask the Lord to show
[43:13] me. And until then, find a place to go.
[43:17] Amen. Brother Ram ALWAYS SAID, "GO TO
[43:20] CHURCH." He said, "Even if it's
[43:22] denomination," he even talked about uh
[43:25] uh brothers that were there in certain
[43:28] meetings at certain times. You probably
[43:29] heard it when he's in a meeting and he's
[43:31] ministering and he says, "If you don't
[43:32] have a church to go to, there's a
[43:34] brother sitting here and there's a
[43:35] pastor sitting here and there's a pastor
[43:37] sitting here. These these are good men
[43:39] of God. Go to their churches." Amen.
[43:42] Fill their pews. He encourages the
[43:44] people. He said, "I'm not a pastor." In
[43:47] fact, I think I may have even have that
[43:49] quote down here somewhere where he talks
[43:52] about this is go to their churches.
[43:54] Amen. These are men of God. Go to their
[43:56] churches. Still, and as God continues to
[43:59] move in your life, as God continues, as
[44:01] you continue to grow in the Lord, as the
[44:03] closer you get to God, God speaks to
[44:05] you. God will tell you, God will show
[44:07] you. God will let you know. Amen.
[44:09] Through speaking to you, through
[44:12] encouragement, through something that
[44:13] just uncctions in your heart, through a
[44:15] dream. I think even Sister Sheily, I
[44:17] believe, had a dream when she first
[44:18] started coming our church. The Lord
[44:20] wanted her to come and be a part of our
[44:22] church. See, and there's a reason. See,
[44:26] God does everything for a purpose and
[44:28] reason. And he puts people in certain
[44:30] places uh to where they're supposed to
[44:32] be, not because of their family, not
[44:35] because their their their daddy or their
[44:38] their uh son-in-law or whatever is the
[44:41] pastor of the church. You don't go to a
[44:42] church for that reason. You go because
[44:44] God sent you there.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Wherever God sent you, that's where you
[44:48] go. And that's where that that that is
[44:51] why God puts that pastor in that place
[44:54] to for that reason to be a pastor to you
[44:56] to be a pastor to those people. Now a
[44:59] pastor wears a pastor wears many hats.
[45:03] Um a pastor is not an evangelist. He
[45:06] doesn't go burning up the road. A pastor
[45:08] is not effectively a teacher. Amen. Now
[45:12] he can teach but he's not a teacher. A
[45:15] teacher is someone who comes in and
[45:17] that's his call to break down that word.
[45:20] Amen. Now, there'll be times that the
[45:22] Lord will give me something to to break
[45:25] down something to make it clearer, but
[45:27] not not like a teacher, a a a teacher,
[45:30] someone who's anointed uh to bring and
[45:32] to break that word down. Uh uh and and
[45:37] it should be when a teacher does it. I
[45:39] I've been in play I've been in I hate
[45:42] saying this but I' I've been I've been
[45:44] in services at times where a person
[45:47] called themselves a teacher honestly my
[45:49] wife can testify to this um cuz we don't
[45:53] go we don't go places without each other
[45:55] I don't know some people go without each
[45:56] other when we go church this place we
[45:58] always went together anyway uh they call
[46:02] themselves a teacher and they would walk
[46:04] in and come up on the pull pit and then
[46:06] have a stack of message books this
[46:09] and spend an hour or so reading a quote
[46:13] out of each of these books. They just
[46:15] read a quote and sit it down and call
[46:18] themselves a teacher.
[46:21] Well, you didn't teach him anything.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; A person could get a quote book and done
[46:25] the exact same thing.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody could read any and all those
[46:28] messages and get the very same thing,
[46:30] but call themselves a teacher. I've been
[46:33] to some places where someone called
[46:34] themselves teachers and and they would
[46:37] they would break something down to a
[46:38] point to where it became so confusing
[46:42] that it there was just no anointing.
[46:45] Amen. And a lot of people consider
[46:48] teachers as being dry. I know we haven't
[46:50] even we haven't even got the teachers
[46:52] yet, but uh but a pastor just breaks it
[46:56] down to the point to where it is that is
[46:58] helpful to the people in to me into a a
[47:02] state, an elementary state. Amen. I I I
[47:06] guess I've been encouraged that uh that
[47:10] the way I minister uh makes it very
[47:13] simple for people to understand.
[47:16] I don't do that on purpose. I didn't
[47:18] know I did that just by what other
[47:20] people tell me. Uh I don't know that.
[47:22] All I know is the gift that God gives.
[47:25] Amen. And I'm assuming that's the a part
[47:29] of what God does as a pastor. Amen. But
[47:33] a pastor can do some teaching. He's not
[47:36] a teacher, but he can do some teaching.
[47:38] He can he can actually have the gift of
[47:41] prophecy, too. There's pastors that can
[47:43] have a gift of prophecy. He's not a
[47:45] ministering prophet, not a word prophet,
[47:47] but he can have that. He can have that
[47:50] ability to be able to have that gift. He
[47:52] can evangelize in a message. Uh a pastor
[47:56] can certainly get up. He sees uh sin
[47:59] coming in the camp. Brother Brandham
[48:01] talked about Philistines be on the
[48:03] Brandom Tabernacle. Amen. And just uh
[48:07] evangelizing the people and rip rip the
[48:09] people the hide off, you know. Uh he can
[48:12] do that, too. But it's it's a it's a
[48:15] pastor's ability to be able to uh do
[48:18] like like I said before with brother
[48:20] Brandham and take that bomb and smooth
[48:23] it over and ease that hurt and you know
[48:26] because from time to time we all need to
[48:29] hide taking off of us
[48:31] &gt;&gt; uh to straighten us up to get us back in
[48:33] line to get us in the place that we're
[48:35] supposed to be. That's what a shepherd
[48:36] does.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. A shepherd does that. Remember an
[48:40] evangelist, his ministry is to bring
[48:42] people to repentance and to
[48:45] to a sorrowfulness, a repentance to the
[48:48] Lord. But a pastor uh he'll he tries to
[48:51] guide people and take and and you know a
[48:54] shepherd a shepherd does out. We're
[48:56] getting a little ahead of ourselves, but
[48:58] u a true shepherd will do that. He'll
[49:00] make sure the sheep stay in line. He'll
[49:03] make sure the shepherds stay where the
[49:04] sheep stay where they're supposed to
[49:06] stay and keep going in line and keep
[49:08] going the right direction and keep out
[49:10] of the uh it's a it's a pastor's
[49:13] position to try to keep those sheep away
[49:15] from danger to speak to them about the
[49:18] dangers of things that are in the world.
[49:20] Uh false doctrine and things like that.
[49:22] It's a it's a pastor's position to do
[49:25] that. Sometimes see see people may say,
[49:28] "Well, why do you do all that?" It's
[49:29] it's a pastor. It's a shepherd position
[49:31] to do that. It's a part of the one of
[49:33] the hats that he wears to keep the sheep
[49:36] in line to keep them going the right
[49:38] direction to keep them away from all
[49:40] evil things. The pastor wants his his
[49:43] sheep to stay in a place to where they
[49:45] get fed and they get blessed and they
[49:47] can grow. Amen. Not not to have one
[49:50] wander off and get attacked by the by
[49:53] the wolves, but uh but so they can
[49:56] continue to stay in line and stay with
[49:58] the word and stay with Christ and and
[50:00] continue on till we go home to be with
[50:02] the Lord. Amen. That's one of the hats
[50:04] that the pastor has. He wears many hats.
[50:07] Amen. And and ministers in many
[50:09] different ways. Now, an evangelist
[50:11] doesn't have that. An evangelist isn't
[50:14] somebody that that like we said the
[50:16] other day doesn't come and preach
[50:18] doctrine. Uh you know when brother
[50:21] Brandham good example uh brother
[50:24] Brandham was told to do the work of an
[50:26] evangelist. We know that Lord told him
[50:29] to do the work of an evangelist. He said
[50:30] I'm not an evangelist but he said do the
[50:33] work of an evangelist. Amen.
[50:36] But in doing the work of an evangelist,
[50:37] when we went to a visiting minister's
[50:40] pullpit, he said, now I heard him do
[50:43] contrary from time to time, but he said,
[50:47] "I don't teach doctrine in another man's
[50:49] pullpit, and an evangelist is not
[50:52] supposed to." Now, things have changed a
[50:55] little bit, I guess, and we just getting
[50:57] close enough to the coming of the Lord
[50:58] that sometimes that those lines get
[51:00] blurred a little bit. But it is not an
[51:03] evangelist position to teach doctrine
[51:05] because the people are supposed to have
[51:07] one pastor. They're supposed to have a
[51:10] everybody should have a pastor, but one
[51:12] pastor, not a dozen, not two. It all
[51:15] becomes confusing and convoluted at that
[51:17] point. One pastor. And see, brother Bam
[51:20] said, "I don't get and teach doctrine in
[51:22] another man's pullpit."
[51:26] He said, "If I have a message the Lord
[51:27] gives me, something that's on a
[51:29] doctrinal issue," he said, "I go to
[51:31] Jeffersonville and I preach at my
[51:33] church." Amen. Notice he called his
[51:35] church. "I go and preach at my church."
[51:38] Amen. That's what he said. He said, now
[51:41] he he didn't mind Tucson Tabernacle with
[51:44] brother Green, but he said, "If the Lord
[51:46] give me something," and he promised the
[51:48] people there. He said, "I will come here
[51:49] and preach it to you first. you will get
[51:53] uh whatever the Lord gives me fresh,
[51:55] it'll be come from this pull pit. And
[51:58] when he went out to uh uh other pullpits
[52:00] and other men's and uh uh uh uh revival
[52:04] and stuff like that, he didn't preach
[52:06] doctrine.
[52:07] It's simple scriptural stuff, usually
[52:09] stories in the Bible. Brother Brandon
[52:11] was very good at storytelling and
[52:13] embellishing a story from the Bible and
[52:15] putting in details and things like that.
[52:17] Uh blind Barnameus and stuff. That's
[52:19] what he did to the people to try to help
[52:21] encourage them and try to build their
[52:23] faith. Amen. Blind Barnameus got healed.
[52:26] He was blind but then the Lord healed
[52:28] him and he he had his eyesight. See
[52:30] encourage try to build up the
[52:32] encouragement of the people but he did
[52:34] not preach doctrine. And in fact, one
[52:37] time uh when he preached in Christ uh in
[52:39] the invisible union and uh uh oh, I
[52:44] forget he preached I think four messages
[52:47] at Jack Moore Church in Streetport,
[52:49] Louisiana one time, Thanksgiving
[52:51] meetings. I think it was I can't
[52:53] remember 63. And he came and he and he
[52:56] said and he actually told the
[52:58] congregation. He said, "And I may preach
[53:01] some doctrine."
[53:03] He actually let them know. He said he
[53:05] got brother Jack Moore. He talked to him
[53:08] and brother Jack was okay. And the
[53:10] people were saying, "Amen. Praise the
[53:11] Lord." And to the fact that he said in
[53:14] another man's pullpit, "I may preach
[53:16] some doctrine." So he let them know. He
[53:18] let the pastor know. He may cross that
[53:21] line a little bit. Amen. But truly, an
[53:24] evangelist isn't to do that. That's the
[53:26] pastor's job. It's the pastor's job to
[53:29] bring doctrine to the people. Amen. Now,
[53:32] a teacher can bring some doctrine, but
[53:34] it's the pastor's position. Again,
[53:36] that's the food. That's the feeding.
[53:39] That's that's uh what God uses that man
[53:42] to do to bring those people uh in line
[53:45] and to grow in the Lord is to bring that
[53:48] correct doctrine, that true doctrine
[53:50] that God operates, that gift to bring.
[53:53] Amen. It's his position. Not the
[53:55] evangelist, but the pastor. That's his
[53:58] position uh as a part of that uh as a
[54:01] part of wearing uh those different hats.
[54:04] Amen. To get that message, to get that
[54:06] truth across, to bring that doctrine, to
[54:09] bring that truth. See? Amen. a pastor
[54:13] in the scripture uh Ephesians 4:11 that
[54:16] we just read
[54:20] the the um uh speaking of teaching a
[54:24] little bit uh the the Greek on pastor
[54:29] from Ephesians 4:11 says of course
[54:31] shepherd pastor shepherd they're
[54:35] interchangeable amen pastor shepherd
[54:38] same shepherd
[54:42] He to whose care and control
[54:46] others have committed themselves. Amen.
[54:50] That's why you've heard me say many
[54:51] times and when the transition was
[54:54] happening at the tabernacle, I use this
[54:56] phrase many times. And I tell anybody,
[54:59] make sure that you're careful at to
[55:03] whom's
[55:04] care you put your spiritual welfare
[55:07] &gt;&gt; because it matters.
[55:10] putting your spiritual welfare in the
[55:12] hands of a pastor. Amen.
[55:16] Highest honor in my op in my opinion in
[55:19] my opinion. Highest honor that that a
[55:23] pastor can receive is when somebody
[55:26] comes in and they relinquish their
[55:29] spiritual welfare to your care. You talk
[55:31] about a burden, saints.
[55:33] That's a burden that a pastor never gets
[55:35] out from under. It don't matter how many
[55:38] services you have. how many people you
[55:39] have. That is a burden that the pastor
[55:42] never gets out from under. But it's the
[55:44] greatest honor a pastor can have. Amen.
[55:48] That you folks that people would put
[55:50] their spiritual welfare in your hands.
[55:53] Amen. It's very humbling. It really is
[55:56] regardless who it is. Very humbling. To
[56:00] whomse care? To whose care and control
[56:02] others have committed themselves?
[56:06] whose precepts they follow, which is
[56:09] teaching, which is doctrine. Amen. Which
[56:12] is the word that you give them. Amen.
[56:15] They live by it. Amen. They don't they
[56:18] don't come and argue contrary. Amen.
[56:21] They follow. Amen. They precepts they
[56:24] follow. As soon as one sheep gets to the
[56:27] place that they start getting out of
[56:28] line for that, Amen. And then it's the
[56:30] shepherd's job to get them back in line
[56:33] and say, "No, this is the way the
[56:35] scripture says. This is the way brother
[56:37] Brandham taught it. This is the way
[56:39] Jesus gave it to us. This is the way God
[56:41] is leading through a gift to bring this
[56:44] truth. This is this is the way it is."
[56:47] Amen. Everybody can have their own
[56:49] ideas, opinions. That's their thoughts.
[56:50] You're human. Amen. But if you if you
[56:54] place your spirit your spiritual welfare
[56:56] and care in the hands of a shepherd,
[56:59] you're trusting that God is using that
[57:01] shepherd to lead you in the right path
[57:04] to bring you to glory.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And if that's and if that gift is
[57:09] operated properly, he's a God- called
[57:11] man. Because trust me, there's there's
[57:13] plenty out there that aren't God called.
[57:15] But if he's a God- called man in that
[57:17] place he's in his position, GOD WILL
[57:19] BLESS IT. God will bless you in it. If
[57:22] you're where you're supposed to be, God
[57:24] will bless you in it. See, and it all
[57:26] works out perfectly. And you see a nice
[57:28] shepherd there with his staff and his
[57:30] rod and the sheep are just grazing and
[57:32] they're just enjoying their time and
[57:33] they're just Amen. That's the way it
[57:35] should be. Just being having fun and
[57:38] being happy and Amen. whose precepts
[57:42] they follow. It's not so well, you know,
[57:45] it's like people do with the Bible. Uh I
[57:48] I saw the other day u u cuz sometimes I
[57:52] get it on my Facebook feed. I saw the
[57:54] other day there's and sometimes I'm
[57:56] intrigued. I look at them where uh
[57:57] Charlie Kirk was debating some of these
[57:59] kids on campus. And I saw one the other
[58:02] day and and he just kept trying to get
[58:04] her to understand uh about the
[58:07] scriptural and the concepts of scripture
[58:09] and the Bible and the Bible being the
[58:11] infallible inspired word of God that it
[58:14] wasn't Yes. It was written by 66
[58:17] different individuals. But God wrote it.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; God speaking through the individuals
[58:22] wrote that word. And from beginning to
[58:25] end, it all brings itself together in
[58:27] perfect continuity. See, especially, you
[58:29] know, if you know you have the Holy
[58:31] Ghost and God reveals, you say there's
[58:33] people can say it contradicts itself,
[58:35] but it does not. and and and and this
[58:38] girl kept insisting because he's like,
[58:41] "Well, uh the these little things she's
[58:45] trying what she was trying to do is
[58:46] justify homosexual lifestyle." That's
[58:48] what she was trying to do. Uh pretty
[58:51] easy to see. It's about 10 or 12
[58:53] minutes. She was trying to justify
[58:55] homosexual lifestyle. I could tell by
[58:57] some of the things she threw out there.
[58:59] And she said, "Well, these little things
[59:01] that mention this and uh and and of
[59:03] course he just off the top of his head,
[59:05] I don't know him, but he knew this man
[59:07] was smart. He had all these things off
[59:09] top of his head about homosexuality and
[59:11] how wrong it is in this scripture and
[59:12] this scripture and this scripture and
[59:14] this scripture all the way from the Old
[59:16] Testament into Jude where it talks about
[59:18] it. Amen. Um, I know some of them, but
[59:22] uh and and she was, "Well, yeah, these
[59:24] these little things uh these little
[59:27] things that they're just really not
[59:29] important. They don't really mean
[59:30] anything, you know. We need we just need
[59:32] some that's a that's real construct. We
[59:35] need something that's that's real law.
[59:37] That's real uh uh uh moral guidance and
[59:40] that and and you and he says THE AND THE
[59:43] BIBLE should give that." And he's like,
[59:44] "You mean like thou shalt not kill?"
[59:47] Huh? That's a pretty good one, isn't it?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody know that comes from the Bible?
[59:53] You know that that's actually God's
[59:55] word. Don't kill. How about don't steal?
[59:59] That sounds like a pretty good one, too.
[1:00:01] Where'd that come from? Oh, that comes
[1:00:03] from the Bible. Amen. But what she was
[1:00:06] trying to do is say, and he's like,
[1:00:08] "Well, do you think that's a good idea?"
[1:00:10] Well, yeah, we shouldn't kill. You
[1:00:12] think, "Yeah, but shouldn't steal? Yeah,
[1:00:14] that's that's a good idea." You know, he
[1:00:16] said, "Well, every then then what's
[1:00:18] wrong with all the rest? Every bit of it
[1:00:19] is the Bible. Every bit of it is God's
[1:00:21] word." But what she's trying to do is
[1:00:24] like so many people try to do. They try
[1:00:26] to take the word and cherrypick it to
[1:00:28] fit their own ideas and cherrypick it to
[1:00:31] fit their own way that they want to live
[1:00:34] and what they want to do. And they
[1:00:35] cherry say, "Well, this this part just
[1:00:38] isn't important." you know, oh this this
[1:00:40] part he didn't really mean that or or
[1:00:42] this shouldn't be this is not this is
[1:00:44] just one little verse, you know, it
[1:00:46] doesn't mean anything.
[1:00:49] I've had so many people tell me in
[1:00:50] trying to rebut THE HOMOSEXUAL
[1:00:52] LIFESTYLE, THAT'S JUST OLD TESTAMENT.
[1:00:54] NO, it's not.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus gave many examples through the New
[1:00:59] Testament of a homosexual. Romans and uh
[1:01:02] uh uh uh Corinth, Timothy, uh Jude, he
[1:01:06] gave a there's several scriptures in the
[1:01:09] New Testament about it. But again, it's
[1:01:10] just a cherry pick. See, uh to to
[1:01:13] cherrypick this, that, and the other.
[1:01:15] No, God didn't ask that. Amen. If you've
[1:01:18] put your spiritual welfare, your care in
[1:01:20] the hands of a pastor, a shepherd that
[1:01:22] God has lead led you to, then you follow
[1:01:25] those precepts. Amen. You follow those
[1:01:28] precepts. And not blindly. Not blindly.
[1:01:30] I'm not saying you do it blindly because
[1:01:33] every one of us are are ultimately
[1:01:36] responsible to ourselves and our own
[1:01:37] spiritual welfare. Of course. Amen. So
[1:01:42] the bottom line is yes, you follow. But
[1:01:44] if you see something that's doctrinally
[1:01:46] wrong, contrary or something, then uh
[1:01:49] then it's your responsibility to go tell
[1:01:51] say, you know, I don't see it that way.
[1:01:53] I I don't think that's the way it is.
[1:01:55] And I've had I never had anybody here do
[1:01:57] that, but I've had people other churches
[1:01:59] do that especially in Florida. Uh I've
[1:02:01] mentioned to you before the one brother
[1:02:04] uh even after church CAN'T HARDLY WALK
[1:02:06] OUT THE door and this this and this like
[1:02:10] you know what can we go to lunch u can
[1:02:14] we talk about this tomorrow or you know
[1:02:16] just something just bam right there. I
[1:02:19] think I if it if if it's not something
[1:02:25] um and I'm I'm saying this on tape
[1:02:27] that's kind of kind of got to the point
[1:02:30] that uh online that's kind of the point
[1:02:33] it got to I hate to call her but was
[1:02:36] somebody else in this church and I it
[1:02:38] just got to the point I finally like you
[1:02:40] know I'm like I I don't really think I'm
[1:02:43] the pastor for you. I I believe that I
[1:02:47] there's so many of these things and you
[1:02:51] know you preach the word and they have
[1:02:53] these contrary thoughts and ideas and
[1:02:55] things and um I if you if you deal with
[1:02:59] it to a certain degree and you do
[1:03:01] everything you can to help them and it
[1:03:03] just comes to a point where it just
[1:03:05] almost really gets worse and you say,
[1:03:06] "Lord, what do you do?" It's like, you
[1:03:09] know what? I I'm just not sure I'm the
[1:03:11] person that's to be your pastor. you
[1:03:13] know, maybe you should pray and find out
[1:03:15] if maybe uh the Lord's got somebody else
[1:03:18] for you that will take you in the
[1:03:20] direction you're headed or something. U
[1:03:24] I don't necessarily think that's a good
[1:03:25] thing, but anyway, that's up to them
[1:03:27] between them and God, not me.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But, uh if it gets to that place
[1:03:32] and that then there has to be a decision
[1:03:35] made. Amen. But they follow the they
[1:03:38] follow their precepts, the the the
[1:03:40] doctrine that they teach. See
[1:03:43] the presiding officer another position
[1:03:46] of the pastor of course uh the he is the
[1:03:49] presiding officer manager director of
[1:03:52] any assembly of course this assembly
[1:03:53] he's the janitor and he's the uh
[1:03:56] everything there is but that's uh that
[1:03:58] goes with having a small church I guess
[1:04:01] uh but he is he is the presiding officer
[1:04:04] manager and all that to take care of
[1:04:07] that is that God never put the spiritual
[1:04:11] wealth welfare of a congregation in the
[1:04:13] hands of a board
[1:04:15] uh a deacon board or a trustee board or
[1:04:19] something like God never put a church
[1:04:22] his church his people the spiritual
[1:04:25] welfare of a of a congregation in the
[1:04:28] hands of a board. He never did that.
[1:04:31] It's up to them. It's that man. It It's
[1:04:34] like I said at at work uh several times
[1:04:39] uh and and it's like I've said in life
[1:04:43] when it come when it come down to the
[1:04:45] rubber meeting the road. If something
[1:04:47] was done wrong, it it's like I I like
[1:04:52] this analogy better. It's like um
[1:04:55] schools.
[1:04:57] It seems like schools nowadays that the
[1:05:00] teachers and the schools want to take
[1:05:03] over the children. They want to be able
[1:05:06] to do things to and with the children
[1:05:09] without the parental consent and with
[1:05:12] even without parental knowledge.
[1:05:16] They drive a kid, a boy into thinking
[1:05:19] they're a girl and then tell them,
[1:05:22] "Well, don't tell your parents." And
[1:05:24] this and the state is trying to make
[1:05:26] that legal
[1:05:29] and go through even gender reaffirming
[1:05:33] and all this GARBAGE WITHOUT TELLING the
[1:05:36] parent.
[1:05:38] But let me tell you what, if that child
[1:05:41] goes down the street and steals
[1:05:44] something out of the local store, who
[1:05:45] are they going to call? They going to
[1:05:46] call the parent. They ain't going to
[1:05:48] call the the the teacher. They're not
[1:05:50] going to call the the school. They're
[1:05:52] going to call the parent because the
[1:05:55] parents the ones that's responsible to
[1:05:56] those kids. BUT YET THEY'RE WITHHOLDING
[1:05:58] VITAL information about their child from
[1:06:02] the parent and making it legal to do so.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; How much that is so demonic?
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; But yet who's responsible?
[1:06:12] Amen. It's like a church. Who's
[1:06:15] responsible? Board's not responsible.
[1:06:18] God doesn't hold the board responsible.
[1:06:21] He holds the pastor responsible because
[1:06:23] it's it's his position. It's his place.
[1:06:27] He's the one that's responsible directly
[1:06:29] to Almighty God for what goes on here.
[1:06:32] What goes on with his church, with his
[1:06:34] congregation, with his flock. It's his
[1:06:36] responsibility. Not a deacon, not a
[1:06:39] trustee.
[1:06:40] You can say, "Well, if he had done his
[1:06:42] job right." No, no, no. That's that's
[1:06:44] it's your job. It's your God put you
[1:06:46] there for a reason. God put you there
[1:06:49] for a purpose. See, and uh and and
[1:06:52] that's where it ends. Amen. That's where
[1:06:54] God's placed it. That's why even in the
[1:06:58] Greek, he's the presiding officer,
[1:07:00] manager, director of any assembly. Amen.
[1:07:03] Is the pastor. It's his position. It's
[1:07:05] his place. That's what God's called him
[1:07:07] to.
[1:07:09] Let's go over to Jeremiah.
[1:07:12] I'm going to read a few scripture in
[1:07:13] Jeremiah. Jeremiah
[1:07:15] more than any he really had talked about
[1:07:17] pastors a lot.
[1:07:21] And I think he did it for the
[1:07:24] importance, the understanding of the
[1:07:26] importance of a pastor, the importance
[1:07:28] of a pastor in an assembly, but also the
[1:07:33] egregiousness of some pastors
[1:07:37] and some that aren't really called to be
[1:07:40] pastors. Let's go. Jeremiah chapter uh
[1:07:44] 3. I just want to read one verse of
[1:07:46] scripture here. Jeremiah chapter 3.
[1:07:51] Amen.
[1:07:57] I'll let everybody get there. We've uh
[1:08:00] like I said, we've got a few scriptures
[1:08:02] to read out of Jeremiah itself. Just one
[1:08:04] in verse chapter 3, but uh Jeremiah
[1:08:08] chapter 3:1 15.
[1:08:11] He says, "I will give you pastors
[1:08:14] according to mine heart which shall feed
[1:08:18] you with knowledge and understanding."
[1:08:22] There we go. Position of a pastor. The
[1:08:25] placement of a pastor to feed you with
[1:08:28] knowledge and understanding. So, it's
[1:08:30] the pastor's place. It's a shepherd's
[1:08:32] place
[1:08:34] to feed the flock. And when God told
[1:08:37] brother Brown to store up food in the
[1:08:40] storehouse,
[1:08:41] it was to be used by all of us, but for
[1:08:46] a pastor to be able to take and to bring
[1:08:49] to a congregation
[1:08:51] the food because he's supposed to feed
[1:08:54] them. Amen. Because pastors are
[1:08:57] appointed by God. Not not that an
[1:09:00] evangelist isn't an evangelist is an
[1:09:03] appointment of God, but God tells them
[1:09:05] where to go. See, and he just goes from
[1:09:08] church to church. But a pastor's an
[1:09:10] appointment.
[1:09:12] Uh may not be a permanent appointment,
[1:09:14] but it's an appointment for a time, for
[1:09:17] a period. Uh this may or will be 10
[1:09:20] years for us here. It's hard to believe,
[1:09:23] but May will be 10 years of our the
[1:09:27] first since the celebration the first
[1:09:28] time the first service we had over on
[1:09:31] Cterero. It'll be 10 years this May. But
[1:09:33] God puts for a purpose. Amen. Maybe a
[1:09:36] short time. Maybe for their whole life.
[1:09:39] Maybe for a period of time. Maybe
[1:09:41] certain people come in, leave. Maybe uh
[1:09:44] some others come stay and are here.
[1:09:47] Amen. And never leave. But it just
[1:09:50] that's up to God. But it's an
[1:09:52] appointment. It's God that God's God
[1:09:55] calls the man. Amen. He's God called.
[1:09:58] God calls him. If someone says stands
[1:10:01] behind a pull pit to claiming to be a
[1:10:03] pastor, he better be GOD CALLED. HE
[1:10:05] BETTER have come in uh come in contact
[1:10:08] with the pillar of fire because God's
[1:10:11] the one that called him to that place,
[1:10:13] to that position. That's when I I've
[1:10:16] told you many times I know when God told
[1:10:19] me uh to that I was called me to be a
[1:10:22] minister and then like six years later
[1:10:25] after that uh brothers started talking
[1:10:29] to me and I started looking in the
[1:10:30] scripture thinking well what what part
[1:10:32] of the ministry do I feel
[1:10:35] what part so I got to praying seeking
[1:10:38] the Lord trying to seek Lord what is it
[1:10:40] I felt the Lord it's a another whole
[1:10:43] another story but that the Lord called
[1:10:45] me to be a pastor. So I went to my
[1:10:47] pastor and I said, I want just want to
[1:10:50] let you know that this is what I feel
[1:10:52] led of the Lord to do. I'm not going to
[1:10:55] actively go out and evangelize anymore.
[1:10:58] I'm not going to seek pull pits to go
[1:11:00] preach to evangelize because that's not
[1:11:03] my calling. If somebody calls me and
[1:11:05] wants me to come in a certain case or
[1:11:07] something, I'd be happy to go minister
[1:11:08] in a situation or something like that,
[1:11:10] but I'm not an evangelist.
[1:11:13] I believe God's called me to be a
[1:11:15] pastor. Took four years before the Lord
[1:11:17] gave me a pullpit, but he did. Amen.
[1:11:21] But God does it as an appointment for a
[1:11:24] period of time. Now, if others say their
[1:11:27] pastors stand behind the pull pit,
[1:11:30] aren't called of God, that that is a
[1:11:33] very bad situation because if God
[1:11:35] doesn't appoint them, then it creates
[1:11:38] chaos and and there's no spiritual
[1:11:41] welfare. There's no growth. Might be a
[1:11:42] lot of emotion. Might be a lot of
[1:11:44] shouting, screaming. There might be a
[1:11:46] lot of things like that going on, but
[1:11:47] there's no true God. There's no true
[1:11:49] word. There's no true spiritual growth.
[1:11:52] Amen. I want more than anything for
[1:11:56] everybody here to look back on the past
[1:11:58] 10 years or however long you've been
[1:12:00] here and believe and know that you've
[1:12:02] grown in the Lord.
[1:12:06] If not, then
[1:12:08] what? We're just spinning our wheels. We
[1:12:10] got to find out what's going wrong.
[1:12:12] Amen. Because we all should be growing.
[1:12:15] We all should be getting closer to God.
[1:12:17] We all should be growing to a place that
[1:12:19] we're getting closer to the Lord, more
[1:12:21] like him. Amen. And our lives are
[1:12:24] reflecting that. Our lives are showing
[1:12:27] that. Amen. And it will. And a true born
[1:12:31] again son or daughter of God. It will
[1:12:35] if it's God called. If it's not, then
[1:12:37] all you got is a bunch of jumping,
[1:12:39] dancing, shouting, coming to church. And
[1:12:42] again, like the scripture says, you
[1:12:43] might as well write Incabot over the
[1:12:45] door because there's no God in there. No
[1:12:47] almighty God. There might be all kinds
[1:12:50] of devil gods or something. Amen. But
[1:12:52] there's no almighty omnipotent God in
[1:12:56] there. Amen. Because God's done left the
[1:12:58] place. See,
[1:13:00] look here. Read a couple more. We'll get
[1:13:03] to another section here for the next few
[1:13:05] minutes.
[1:13:07] Because I got some more scripture in
[1:13:08] Jeremiah that I want to read because
[1:13:10] Jeremiah he lays it down with pastors
[1:13:13] and what they do God give a pastors
[1:13:15] according to God's heart to not to bring
[1:13:20] knowledge to feed knowledge and
[1:13:21] understanding. What house will you build
[1:13:24] me? This is brother Brandon. We know the
[1:13:26] first place in Tucson tabernacle. Uh
[1:13:29] December I believe this was December
[1:13:31] 12th. I can't remember. Oh, here.
[1:13:34] November 21st. December 12th was the
[1:13:36] communion. Uh uh November 21st. What
[1:13:40] house would you build me? Brother Brown,
[1:13:42] Tucson Tabernacle. He says, "Now I
[1:13:44] realize that years ago I was called in
[1:13:46] the ministry.
[1:13:48] I've never make a successful pastor
[1:13:51] because I have a roaming rambling
[1:13:53] spirit.
[1:13:55] I can't be uh satisfied anywhere. Just
[1:13:59] wherever the spirit moves, I've just got
[1:14:02] to move with it because I have a
[1:14:04] message. There's a reason. See, that was
[1:14:07] given for that purpose. He has a
[1:14:10] message. Remember, he was a work
[1:14:11] prophet. My opinion again, I will
[1:14:14] restate this again. In my opinion, I
[1:14:16] believe brother Brandham fulfilled at
[1:14:18] some point in time and and in his life
[1:14:20] had a gift of all five of the gift
[1:14:23] ministering gifts.
[1:14:25] evangelist, pastor, teacher, missionary,
[1:14:28] prophet. Amen. Of course, most of all,
[1:14:30] prophet. He had a message. What was that
[1:14:34] message? A word. Jesus said, "I must
[1:14:36] preach in this other town also." But
[1:14:38] there are those who are shepherds that
[1:14:42] that watch the flock.
[1:14:46] He said, "I AM SO GRATEFUL that brother
[1:14:48] Perry followed the leading of the Holy
[1:14:50] Spirit." You ever heard brother Green
[1:14:52] tell that story of what brother Brown
[1:14:55] saying here? Brother Green, Brother
[1:14:57] Green tells the story that he's sitting
[1:14:59] right behind Brother Brown here and he's
[1:15:02] up at the pull pit. Brother Brown,
[1:15:04] Brother Green sitting back here. He
[1:15:05] said, "Brother Green sitting there and
[1:15:06] he hears Brother Brown say this. He
[1:15:08] says, "I'm so grateful that Brother
[1:15:10] Perry follow the lead of the Holy
[1:15:11] Spirit." Brother Green testified as he
[1:15:14] sat behind Brother says, "Is that what I
[1:15:16] did?"
[1:15:18] Those were his words. Is that what I
[1:15:20] did? Following the Holy Ghost. See,
[1:15:23] sometimes the Lord just uncctions you
[1:15:25] and you just you just go and do as the
[1:15:30] Lord is leading you and think, well, is
[1:15:31] that what I did? Yeah, that's what I
[1:15:32] that's what you did. Brother Green even
[1:15:34] talked about uh Brother Brandham telling
[1:15:37] him uh that confessing that and and and
[1:15:41] brother Bram said, "Yeah, and and when
[1:15:43] you when you go to study to get a
[1:15:45] message," he said, "you will you will go
[1:15:48] and you'll you'll find something and
[1:15:51] then you'll go over and find another
[1:15:53] something. You'll find these things that
[1:15:54] kind of tie together to bring that
[1:15:56] message together." He said, "And you
[1:15:58] think that you're lucky."
[1:16:01] Brother Bram telling Brother Green,
[1:16:04] he's But Brother Bram said, "But that's
[1:16:06] the Holy Spirit leading you."
[1:16:09] That's the Holy Spirit uncctioning you,
[1:16:11] leading you, bringing you to this
[1:16:14] scripture, leading you, bringing you to
[1:16:16] this scripture, bringing these things
[1:16:18] and tying them together to bring that
[1:16:20] message. That's that. He said that's
[1:16:22] you. He said, "Brother Perry, you think
[1:16:25] YOU'RE LUCKY, BUT THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:16:27] leading you."
[1:16:29] Oh friends, if we could just get a grasp
[1:16:32] understanding of that in our own lives.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:37] in our own lives. Praise the Lord. It's
[1:16:41] God. It's always God. You belong to him.
[1:16:45] It's always God.
[1:16:47] He said, "Is that what I," Brother Green
[1:16:49] said, "s that what I did?" Follow the
[1:16:51] leading of the Holy Spirit. And today we
[1:16:52] have a tabernacle. It's a small one.
[1:16:54] That's just good enough to start with to
[1:16:56] see what the Holy Spirit will do. not
[1:16:58] knowing. Let's just move step by step.
[1:17:01] Now, I believe if God has spoke to
[1:17:03] brother Perry, uh, brother and sister
[1:17:06] Green to come here and has opened up a
[1:17:09] place where our children instead of on
[1:17:11] Sunday morning riding their bicycles on
[1:17:13] the street running around, they have a
[1:17:15] place to come to worship. Instead of us
[1:17:17] sitting around and listening to
[1:17:18] something or what we've heard on radio
[1:17:21] or something, we have a place to come to
[1:17:25] the local assembly,
[1:17:27] the church that God established, that
[1:17:29] God brought a pastor
[1:17:32] to bring you to that place.
[1:17:36] It was no small thing
[1:17:39] that I started this church.
[1:17:42] It was no small thing, saints. Trust me,
[1:17:45] when I left out of the Tucson tabernacle
[1:17:48] that morning, walked across the parking
[1:17:50] lot and praying to God about it, God
[1:17:52] sent me back east, visit my mom, yes, I
[1:17:56] did some ministering, yes, but I had to
[1:17:57] talk to him. I had to get my head
[1:18:00] straight. I had to get things right with
[1:18:02] the will of the Lord for where I go.
[1:18:03] What do I do here, Lord? Because I've
[1:18:05] told you the story many, many times. And
[1:18:08] how real it was the Lord told me to come
[1:18:10] here and go help brother Green. I've
[1:18:12] told you that. We won't get into that
[1:18:14] again. So when that come to uh what I
[1:18:18] considered as an end as brother Green
[1:18:21] had passed away,
[1:18:23] but the Lord told me to stay there and
[1:18:25] help that
[1:18:27] once I was I guess cast aside. I guess
[1:18:31] you say whatever it was. That's probably
[1:18:33] my personal feelings. I shouldn't say
[1:18:36] that. Um but uh I I I had to find out
[1:18:40] Lord what what's next? What now? What do
[1:18:44] I do? Where do I go? What do you want me
[1:18:45] to do? What's what's And I had to get
[1:18:48] things right. I had to find out what the
[1:18:50] mind of the the Lord was. Amen. And see,
[1:18:53] and that's when u I failed. Again,
[1:18:56] another story to come back when I got
[1:18:58] back here, resigned the tabernacle next
[1:19:01] Sunday, started the church. And I've
[1:19:03] told y'all how we got to the building
[1:19:04] and how things worked out and how every
[1:19:06] even to coming into this building. How
[1:19:09] God has led and directed to to bring us
[1:19:11] even to where we are now by the grace of
[1:19:14] God. All the things you see, the
[1:19:16] instruments, the screens, the computers,
[1:19:18] the chairs. Amen. All everything. It's
[1:19:21] all God.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; It's his orchestration.
[1:19:26] I pray in here on Sunday mornings other
[1:19:28] times, but when I'm in here Sunday
[1:19:29] morning and I walk around and uh I stand
[1:19:32] and I look and I still still stand here
[1:19:35] amazed at what the Lord's done for us.
[1:19:37] She said, "Well, you know, there's big
[1:19:39] huge churches and these beautiful
[1:19:40] windows and all this other grandioso and
[1:19:43] stuff and all and they own it and it
[1:19:45] belongs to them and stuff and what what
[1:19:47] do we have compared to that?" Doesn't
[1:19:49] matter. All we have is all we need is
[1:19:51] God
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; and we got him. It doesn't matter.
[1:19:54] Brothers, I'd rather be eating soda
[1:19:56] crackers and drinking branch water, be
[1:19:57] on the street with the with the truth
[1:20:00] than in the most beautiful cathedral
[1:20:01] there is in the world
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; full of people.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what matters to
[1:20:06] me. And I look at I think it's just it's
[1:20:08] just the Lord. It's just God. Amen. And
[1:20:11] God's put us all together. Put you in my
[1:20:14] life in different ways. Everybody in
[1:20:16] here pretty much has been brought into
[1:20:18] my life in a different way and and vice
[1:20:21] versa. So, it's just it it's God. God
[1:20:24] doing it. God knows how to do it. Amen.
[1:20:30] Be certain of God.
[1:20:33] Now, I want you to know, friends, here
[1:20:35] we're closing this meeting. If you have
[1:20:36] accepted Christ your savior, I believe
[1:20:38] this is the one I was talking about just
[1:20:40] a few moments ago. You've received
[1:20:43] Christ your savior. You've been you've
[1:20:45] been a wandering star and tonight you've
[1:20:46] accepted Christ during this meeting to
[1:20:49] come home
[1:20:51] uh to him. Go back to your church.
[1:20:53] Please do. If you don't have a church,
[1:20:56] find you one. If you don't have any
[1:20:58] choice, Brother Littlefield never told
[1:21:01] me to say this, but Brother Littlefield,
[1:21:02] I know to be a man of God. I know
[1:21:05] Brother Hall to be a man of God. I know
[1:21:07] these brethren here, many of them, to be
[1:21:09] men of God. Join their church. They'll
[1:21:11] do you good.
[1:21:13] See, he's sending them someplace. Go
[1:21:16] somewhere. Amen. Now, this is
[1:21:22] 66 years later. Things have changed a
[1:21:26] little bit. It's a little more vital to
[1:21:28] get under the word to get under that
[1:21:30] true fountain than uh just to get a
[1:21:33] slice. Uh but I guess if a person could
[1:21:35] just get a slice, a slice is better than
[1:21:37] nothing. Amen. And he's telling them go.
[1:21:40] I believe these to be men of God,
[1:21:42] they'll do you good. He said, I can,
[1:21:44] Brother Ram said, I can only be an
[1:21:46] evangelist. He said that's my calling.
[1:21:49] He says here, of course later in several
[1:21:52] other places, he said he he's not an
[1:21:54] evangelist, but that's what the God
[1:21:56] called him to do. There are pastors
[1:21:58] there are pastors to feed you and to
[1:22:01] shepherd you until Jesus comes.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's true. Now, it's not
[1:22:10] always that. It's not always that one
[1:22:13] pastor. Amen.
[1:22:16] It God may lead you to a another church.
[1:22:20] You may may call a pastor out of a place
[1:22:23] because he needs him someplace else. And
[1:22:25] God has just be where God told you to
[1:22:27] be. That's the main thing. We're all
[1:22:29] looking for the coming of the Lord.
[1:22:32] Now, a greater than Solomon is here.
[1:22:34] Now, I want you to know, my brother and
[1:22:36] sister, that you don't have to wait for
[1:22:38] some special evangelist to come by. No.
[1:22:40] No. Your pastor has the same. Now, he
[1:22:43] may not be able to have that prophetic
[1:22:46] gift that comes once in a generation,
[1:22:48] but look, he has the same rights to pray
[1:22:51] for you that I would. That discernment
[1:22:54] doesn't heal you. It only brings you God
[1:22:58] conscious.
[1:22:59] Amen. That's the whole point. It just
[1:23:02] brings you God conscious. Now, that that
[1:23:05] point of bringing to God consciousness
[1:23:07] helps increase a person faith.
[1:23:10] Absolutely. But remember, when the angel
[1:23:13] gave the commission to brother Brandham,
[1:23:14] HE TOLD BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU MUST BE
[1:23:17] sincere when you pray.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just the other way. See?
[1:23:22] Amen. Get the people to believe. Yes.
[1:23:24] Faith, but be sincere when you pray.
[1:23:28] Because faith without love doesn't
[1:23:29] operate. Galatians 4. Faith operates by
[1:23:33] love. Amen. So, it has to be by love.
[1:23:37] The faith has to be operated by the
[1:23:39] love. That discernment doesn't heal you.
[1:23:41] It only brings you God conscience that
[1:23:43] you're in the presence of God. Now
[1:23:45] again, that helps raise your faith, but
[1:23:47] it doesn't heal you. But evangelist goes
[1:23:50] in town, does all the praying, all the
[1:23:52] baptizing. Then the people when he
[1:23:54] leaves the pastor, well, the people
[1:23:55] think they're pastors nothing. THEIR
[1:23:57] PASTOR, YOUR PASTOR IS A man of God. He
[1:24:01] has led you safe this far. He can only
[1:24:04] he can take you on. He is an uh an
[1:24:09] instructed man of God. Amen. That's
[1:24:12] ordained to that position. Now,
[1:24:16] for the next few minutes as we close
[1:24:18] this out, let's go to a couple of more
[1:24:20] scriptures in Jeremiah.
[1:24:23] Jeremiah, we get on to the we get on to
[1:24:26] the backside of this, the dark side, if
[1:24:29] you will, of of of this calling. Amen.
[1:24:33] uh the dark side of this calling for an
[1:24:36] evangelist or a teacher or something uh
[1:24:39] is bad too. But when it gets into the
[1:24:42] office of a pastorship who is the one
[1:24:45] that is to guide the sheep and to lead
[1:24:47] the sheep and to keep the sheep safe and
[1:24:50] uh it it's it's ever more destructive.
[1:24:54] Uh I have had people come when I
[1:24:57] pastored a church and preach something
[1:24:59] that I thought was off the word. I would
[1:25:02] have to get up and correct that. That
[1:25:04] evangelist,
[1:25:06] whatever he was called up in Satan, he's
[1:25:08] an evangelist, left. He was gone.
[1:25:12] He He had no responsibility to the
[1:25:15] flock. I did.
[1:25:17] So, I had to be the one to correct that.
[1:25:21] That I felt scripturally was an error.
[1:25:24] So, I haven't had to do it often, but I
[1:25:27] have had to do it because God holds me
[1:25:30] responsible. Not him. He's He brought
[1:25:32] what he thought. He left and that was
[1:25:34] it. He's gone.
[1:25:37] The pastor is the one that's there to
[1:25:39] take care of it to bring the the sheep
[1:25:42] back to bring them back to understanding
[1:25:44] the precept, the doctrine of truth, the
[1:25:47] word. I mean, that's his place. And God
[1:25:50] holds him responsible to that. Amen. So,
[1:25:54] but now on the dark side of this, uh,
[1:25:56] Jeremiah 10, just a few chapters over,
[1:25:59] we read three. Jeremiah 10, two verses.
[1:26:03] My tabernacle is spoiled,
[1:26:06] and all my cords are broken.
[1:26:10] My children are gone forth of me, and
[1:26:12] they are not.
[1:26:14] There is none to stretch forth my tent
[1:26:17] anymore, and to set up my curtains. In
[1:26:20] other words, nobody wanted to hear what
[1:26:22] he had to say.
[1:26:25] Amen. Jeremiah was a man without a
[1:26:27] country, you'd say. But he had God and
[1:26:31] he had thus sayeth the Lord. And God
[1:26:33] continued to give him things to to uh
[1:26:37] condemn the not condemn, but to convict
[1:26:40] convict the people to try to get them
[1:26:43] back on the street the way they're
[1:26:46] supposed to go.
[1:26:48] But he was one voice. Yeah. There were
[1:26:50] there were there were those that
[1:26:51] followed Jeremiah, but the the majority
[1:26:55] of Israel at that point did not follow
[1:26:58] him. He had no one, if you will, he's
[1:27:01] talking about there's none. See, to
[1:27:05] stretch forth my tent anymore to set up
[1:27:07] my curtains is nobody there to help.
[1:27:11] Nobody believed him. Nobody was on his
[1:27:13] side. All these people were being were
[1:27:17] being fed by the pastors. And here's
[1:27:20] what he says. For the pastors are become
[1:27:23] brutish,
[1:27:24] the pastors, the people whose spiritual
[1:27:27] welfare they were under when when
[1:27:30] Jeremiah came, they didn't listen to him
[1:27:33] because the pastors had them under their
[1:27:35] control. And there's that nickelan
[1:27:37] system uh that that is a harsh demonic
[1:27:41] system of nicicoatanism that keeps
[1:27:44] control over people. Amen. God God
[1:27:48] doesn't have his pastor to control his
[1:27:51] children. Amen. We're we're not to
[1:27:53] manipulate your God's children. Amen. To
[1:27:58] nickel and to lord over them.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a guidance. It's a
[1:28:04] leadership. Amen. You you don't you
[1:28:08] don't force people. A shepherd doesn't
[1:28:10] force sheep. He leads sheep. Amen. And
[1:28:14] he what Jeremiah is saying here for the
[1:28:16] pastors are become brutish.
[1:28:19] They become brutes. They become
[1:28:22] forceful. They become uh nicotin if you
[1:28:25] will. Although that that word didn't
[1:28:27] come up till later in history.
[1:28:30] Nicicoatan.
[1:28:31] uh their own ideas, their own minds,
[1:28:35] unteachable,
[1:28:37] unlearnable,
[1:28:39] immovable in their own deceit. See, a
[1:28:43] brute
[1:28:45] and have not sought the Lord. Therefore,
[1:28:49] they shall not prosper, and their flocks
[1:28:52] shall be scattered. Flocks shall be
[1:28:55] scattered because of what they do, who
[1:28:58] they are. Jeremiah 23.
[1:29:04] Let's look what Jeremiah says here.
[1:29:07] Jeremiah 23. Woe be unto the pastors
[1:29:12] that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
[1:29:16] pasture, saith the Lord.
[1:29:19] Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord God of
[1:29:21] Israel, against the pastures that feed
[1:29:24] my people. Ye have scattered my flock
[1:29:27] and driven them away and have not
[1:29:28] visited them. Behold, I will visit upon
[1:29:31] you the evil of your doings, sayaeth the
[1:29:34] Lord. And I will gather the remnant of
[1:29:37] my flock out of the countries whether I
[1:29:39] have driven them, and will bring them
[1:29:41] again to their folds, and they shall be
[1:29:44] fruitful and increase under the
[1:29:47] direction and leadership of God, and a
[1:29:51] true leadership of true pastor. Amen. So
[1:29:54] false pastors
[1:29:56] is as destructive
[1:29:59] as a true pastor is helpful.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; A false pastor is as harmful and hurtful
[1:30:07] as a good pastor as a right p true
[1:30:10] pastor God called pastor is good.
[1:30:13] Amen. Maybe even more so because it's so
[1:30:17] harsh harmful. They have become brutish.
[1:30:20] They have become in im in im inte
[1:30:24] harsh unwilling to relent to the truth
[1:30:28] when the truth presented itself in the
[1:30:31] form of Jeremiah. They had gotten this
[1:30:34] way over a period of years and history
[1:30:37] unfortunately repeats itself where you
[1:30:40] see the same thing going on in the world
[1:30:41] today. Amen. Now, uh I don't I don't see
[1:30:46] in the lateness of this hour that there
[1:30:48] are very many of God's children, if any
[1:30:51] in the world today, but there there very
[1:30:54] well could be.
[1:30:57] I personally believe that if there are
[1:30:59] any, there's not many, and that God's
[1:31:02] children are where they're supposed to
[1:31:04] be in their placement of of position in
[1:31:09] church, in the body, adoption in the
[1:31:13] body.
[1:31:14] Let's go over to Acts chapter 20.
[1:31:22] Few scriptures here. Got two more
[1:31:24] scriptures. I'm going to close. Acts
[1:31:26] chapter 20 verse 28.
[1:31:31] Take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:31:33] to all the flock over the which the Holy
[1:31:36] Ghost had made you overseers
[1:31:39] to feed the church of God which he hath
[1:31:41] purchased with his own blood. Again
[1:31:45] the most humbling
[1:31:49] understanding of a position and a
[1:31:51] pastor.
[1:31:52] Amen.
[1:31:54] to feed the sheep that God purchased
[1:31:58] with his own blood.
[1:32:02] That's that's that's sobering, humbling.
[1:32:05] For I know this, that after my departing
[1:32:08] shall grievous wolves enter in among
[1:32:10] you, not sparing the flock.
[1:32:14] Who does that? Well, we just read in
[1:32:16] Jeremiah, it's the pastors that do that.
[1:32:20] Also of your own selves shall men arise,
[1:32:24] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:32:27] disciples where? After themselves,
[1:32:32] after them, not after God.
[1:32:36] Amen. But after a ministry, after a
[1:32:39] position, after a person. They're
[1:32:42] drawing PEOPLE TO FOLLOW THEM, NOT GOD.
[1:32:45] It's like people would say, I've heard
[1:32:48] people say about Brother Bram that that
[1:32:49] that Brother Bram led PEOPLE TO HIMSELF.
[1:32:52] HE NEVER DID THAT. I never SEEN ONE
[1:32:55] SINGLE WORD SPOKEN ON TAPE BY THAT man
[1:32:57] or any witness of anybody. And I've met
[1:33:00] over two dozen men that spent time
[1:33:02] personally with brother Brandham that
[1:33:04] anybody ever claimed that about him.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Always, eternally, forever pointed
[1:33:11] people to Jesus Christ.
[1:33:14] And that's what I plan to always
[1:33:16] continue to do. Not point you to here.
[1:33:19] Not point you to this. To Christ.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Always to Christ. Amen. Not to a man,
[1:33:25] not to brother Brandham. Amen. Not not
[1:33:28] to a church, not to a pastor, but to
[1:33:31] Jesus Christ. Always forever. To Jesus
[1:33:35] Christ. Amen.
[1:33:38] That's where we That's what we believe.
[1:33:40] They though speaking perverse things to
[1:33:43] draw away disciples after them. A lot of
[1:33:46] times people use a gift. They they'll
[1:33:49] try to faint a gift. Maybe they have a
[1:33:51] real gift of some kind and they'll try
[1:33:53] to operate that gift to try to make that
[1:33:55] look like it's something what to try to
[1:33:57] draw the attention try to get people to
[1:33:59] follow after them a after a gift. We're
[1:34:02] not to follow a gift.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; A lot of people follow brother Brandon
[1:34:05] because the gift we aren't to follow a
[1:34:07] gift. We follow the word. We follow
[1:34:10] Christ.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Therefore, watch and remember that by
[1:34:14] space of three years, I cease not to
[1:34:16] warn everyone night and day with tears.
[1:34:21] So, this was a very serious thing that
[1:34:23] that that John went through. This is a
[1:34:26] very serious thing that he realized
[1:34:28] grievous woes were coming in.
[1:34:31] He saw they were coming in and said they
[1:34:34] would continue to come in. I got one
[1:34:35] more scripture that I want to read as we
[1:34:37] close. John chapter 10, St. John chapter
[1:34:40] 10,
[1:34:43] grievous wolves come in not sparing the
[1:34:45] flock.
[1:34:47] They'll say to do to whatever whomever
[1:34:49] they want. Amen. And draw to themselves
[1:34:53] attention. Amen. Attention to get people
[1:34:57] to come to be be a part.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. By what?
[1:35:05] John chapter 10 verse 10.
[1:35:08] The thief cometh not, but for to steal
[1:35:10] and to kill and to destroy. I am come
[1:35:13] that they might have life, and that they
[1:35:15] might have it more abundantly. I am the
[1:35:19] good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth
[1:35:21] his life for the sheep. Any good
[1:35:24] shepherd gives his life for the sheep
[1:35:26] regardless.
[1:35:28] But he that is in hireling and not the
[1:35:31] shepherd, who's on who's on the sheep or
[1:35:35] not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth
[1:35:38] the sheep and flee fleth and the wolf
[1:35:41] catches them and scatterth the sheep.
[1:35:44] The hireling fleth because he is
[1:35:48] hireling and cares not for the sheep.
[1:35:53] So, a hirling, someone who claims to be
[1:35:55] something or is put in a position or is
[1:35:59] paid for whatever comes because of a a
[1:36:02] paycheck or a payday or something. A
[1:36:04] hirling doesn't care about the sheep. He
[1:36:07] doesn't care about the flock. He cares
[1:36:09] about his position. He cares about his
[1:36:12] stature. He cares about his bank
[1:36:14] account, but he doesn't care about the
[1:36:16] people. So when something comes in, a
[1:36:19] flock comes in, a wolf comes in, starts
[1:36:22] scattering. He just runs because he
[1:36:24] doesn't want to be a part of that. He
[1:36:25] heads for the hills. He doesn't stay and
[1:36:28] protect the sheep. He runs cuz he's in
[1:36:31] hierle. He doesn't care for the sheep.
[1:36:34] Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd and
[1:36:37] know my sheep and have known of mine."
[1:36:40] Praise the Lord. We are known of him.
[1:36:44] Amen. And we know him.
[1:36:46] Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; He is our great shepherd. Praise the
[1:36:50] Lord. But he put pastors in position.
[1:36:52] I'll stop there. He put pastors in
[1:36:55] position as a shepherd under the great
[1:36:58] shepherd for his flock. Amen. But yes,
[1:37:02] there are grievous wolves that come in
[1:37:04] in sheep's clothing to look like they
[1:37:08] are the authentic,
[1:37:11] but they're not. By their fruits, you
[1:37:13] shall know them. What's the fruit? What
[1:37:15] do they what's their word? What do they
[1:37:17] preach? What do they teach? See, and
[1:37:19] that's what gets to the the bad
[1:37:21] situation where people can become
[1:37:23] deceived so easily because they don't
[1:37:25] know the word.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; So when something is preached, they
[1:37:28] don't know whether it's truth or not.
[1:37:30] They just listen to what they said. What
[1:37:31] is that? That's just nickelanism. That
[1:37:34] goes back to the control the Catholic
[1:37:35] Church had over since 320 AD. The
[1:37:39] Catholic Church got control over the
[1:37:40] people. So basically by telling them you
[1:37:43] don't need to know what the word says.
[1:37:44] You don't just listen to us. We'll tell
[1:37:46] you what it says. You just obey us. You
[1:37:49] just listen to us. You just follow us.
[1:37:52] We'll we'll get you there. We'll tell
[1:37:53] you what it means. We'll tell you what
[1:37:55] it does. And look where it is today.
[1:37:58] It's so far off the Bible. You can't you
[1:38:01] can't even you stand there and you can't
[1:38:03] even see THE BIBLE ITSELF. WHY? AND
[1:38:05] THEY'LL TELL YOU. THEY don't care what
[1:38:07] the Bible says. They listen to what the
[1:38:08] Pope says.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Right? They're unconcerned with what the
[1:38:12] scripture says. But a true child of God,
[1:38:15] that's all she cares about. That's all
[1:38:16] he cares about is the word of God.
[1:38:19] Because God is his word. Amen. We know
[1:38:22] the word. We believe in that word. And
[1:38:26] when there's something that's not word,
[1:38:28] there there's something that rings in
[1:38:30] there that says that that's something's
[1:38:32] not right there.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where we all need to be
[1:38:36] in our spiritual walk with the Lord.
[1:38:39] Make sure that we're in the position,
[1:38:40] the place God wants us to be, not be
[1:38:42] deceived. Amen. But know that the the
[1:38:46] true word is being ministered, fed. The
[1:38:49] food that you're eating is cheap food.
[1:38:53] Amen.
[1:38:54] Not goat food, cheap food. Praise the
[1:38:57] Lord. Let's stand if we could.
[1:39:06] Amen. Little bit more. We have to go
[1:39:10] other places with it.
[1:39:13] But we'll stop there for today. Amen.
[1:39:19] Praise the Lord Jesus. I had this course
[1:39:21] on my heart. I wanted to say I want to
[1:39:23] sing if you can find it here. Amen. It
[1:39:26] won't be on the screen. So, but if you
[1:39:28] have a book, you probably remember it.
[1:39:30] You probably all know it anyway. Amen.
[1:39:36] Let's see. It looks like it's
[1:39:38] Make sure that's the right one.
[1:39:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. 168. I just want
[1:39:47] to sing the course here. Course of 168.
[1:39:50] Where he leads me, I will follow.
[1:39:55] Praise the Lord. Again, you don't have a
[1:39:57] book or don't want to pick it up.
[1:39:58] Probably all know this anyway, but it's
[1:40:01] 168. Where he leads me, I will follow.
[1:40:04] That's your That's your desire. Your
[1:40:07] your determination.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow. Let's
[1:40:12] sing it to him now.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Where he leads
[1:40:16] me.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; That's that's more the last. Where he
[1:40:26] leads
[1:40:28] me, I
[1:40:30] will follow.
[1:40:34] Where he leads
[1:40:37] me, I
[1:40:39] will follow.
[1:40:43] I'll go with him.
[1:40:47] With him
[1:40:49] all
[1:40:51] the way.
[1:40:55] Where he leads
[1:40:57] me, I
[1:41:00] will follow.
[1:41:05] Where he leads
[1:41:07] me, I
[1:41:10] will follow.
[1:41:15] Where he leads
[1:41:18] me, I
[1:41:20] will follow.
[1:41:25] I'll go with him.
[1:41:29] with him
[1:41:31] all
[1:41:33] the way.
[1:41:37] Where he leads
[1:41:40] me, I
[1:41:42] will follow.
[1:41:48] Where he leads
[1:41:50] me, I
[1:41:52] will follow.
[1:41:57] Where he leads
[1:42:00] me, I
[1:42:03] will follow.
[1:42:08] I'll go with him.
[1:42:11] With him
[1:42:14] all
[1:42:15] the way.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Where he
[1:42:23] leads. Amen. We will follow whatever he
[1:42:27] says, whatever he does. Amen. Let's be
[1:42:31] led by his spirit in all things. Praise
[1:42:34] the Lord Jesus. Amen. God richly bless
