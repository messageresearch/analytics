Lord man so thankful God is here today and watches over and blesses and keeps us and helps us to simple together again like this with those of like precious faith and give us the facility to do so coming up the interstate woah actually coming down aren't road saw the big huge plume of smoke over here and she said my wife said I wonder what that is looks like another fire well I wonder what it is I said well no but we're headed that direction as long as it's not holiday in life but it was all closed right over here but then the closer we got the more I thought about was part of the waste management and it's just is right behind the fire department the Northwest Park District fire departments right there so look doors it was just right there so I'm sure they have it under control but I'm thankful it wasn't here the board provided us a place here to be so thankful for that and one too I wish again is brother Zach did one of you is here at those your own hookup or the streaming the happy Father's Day to you it's a wonderful there's a wonderful day to have a Father's Day again we're very thankful of the greatest father of all this he's mentioned as mike has sang and the number one father of all that we all try to emulate is the Lord Jesus God Almighty we try to do our best to live up to his example for us so we're so very thankful of that God's been so good to us you know there's a lot of people in the world today there's a lot of young people that are a lot of homes that are fatherless they've had they've had those that would sire children procreate but then you know for Tom really dads or not around or don't take care of their children or help or be there and you know but if those could just learn to understand to reach out to the Lord of lords and the father that we have they'll always have a father amen the best example that there is that you just always do that so we're very thankful to be here again very thankful Lord give us another facility this facility to be able to worship in today and the streaming capabilities and market helping us so much with that and very thankful the Lord blessed us with that as you know there's been a little bit of a change there's been a rise in the cases of coronavirus of 19 in Arizona and in somewhat in Pima County so some have gotten a little more theory about coming together and that's quite all right I understand that that's perfectly fine and someone feels comfortable being here they don't that's okay well welcome you and thank you for being here but if those who don't feel that comfortable I understand it's kind of strange the way the government and the media Pro tray it because no more than two or three weeks ago they were telling everybody as soon as things start opening up again you're gonna see the cases go up well now they opened up the the country and opened up restaurants and businesses and things like that and now the cases are going up a little bit and they're saying dreaming they're screaming foul they told us three weeks ago that's gonna happen just it's just part and parcel of what we're living in today friend it's just it's just kind of sad to watch it go the way it's gone but I think it has a lot to do with the increased testing I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the country is open again I think it has someone maybe a little bit to do with a lot of the protests that went on in people all shoulders shoulder elbow to elbow screaming and yelling and they're you know some had masks some didn't but you know we were told up front that if it wasn't an invite in 95 mask it was not going to be that effective so people just had a bandana on or something just that's just the place it's the world we live in today but where the service of the Lord that's what I believe the Lord's I got my mask though fight that battle when it comes to doing the things of the Lord and having service and things like that I'll fight tooth and nail but when it comes to just putting on a mask going into Home Depot or something I really don't care that much I don't necessarily enjoy breathing my own carbon dioxide which is one thing you don't hear very much about it this whole thing that everybody's running down the road and driving their bikes and sucking their own carbon dioxide you know 10% carbon dioxide in your system will cause a human to go into convulsions some some woman I heard was a read on the news actually was riding her bicycle her jogging down the street or something she kept sucking in her own air and her heart her one of her lungs exploded so it's you know you gotta weigh it you gotta weigh it and decide you know and be led of the Lord you know if your letter the Lord to wear it all the time or be a home that's what you do otherwise we do what we feel that to do and trust the Lord bless us and keep us but again I work coming in here take it off here I'll wear it in the restaurant when we go in the restaurant but I have to take it off to eat but they didn't not they didn't actually say on the news anything about meeting church gatherings they talked mostly about restaurants and places of business and retells and stuff like that so it's mandated in Pima County now if you're out in public and you can't social distance you're supposed to have the mask on so I'm not that's not a Bible that I desire to fight so that's what they wanted I'm thankful that the Lord give us the ability to be able to trust him and live upon his word amen so and we're thankful to be here today so list and if we could and turn our Bibles to lamentations chapter lamentations or the lamentations of Jeremiah the weeping prophet but I'm going to go to the fourth chapter even just another moment find it there it's by the way actually only five chapters there's a thought in here that I want to get to and go over to James chapter 2 as well and take a thought from today so Old Testament just after Jeremiah let's just bow our heads now we'll just have a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful father that your grace is upon us your blessings are bountiful your love is everlasting and unconditional and your grace is so sufficient Lord and your mercies endure forever and we love you we thank you we praise you Lord we thank you God for being the ultimate the utmost the best example of fatherhood that any of us could ever try to emulate Lord and God we're here obeying your word because you told us it Lord you and hope you would have us together together not forsake the assembling of ourselves as it says in your word is that day approaches and Lord we certainly see that day rapidly approaching we're so thankful God that you give us your grace and mercy once again to be here you've provided this facility this place for us to mean for the streaming and the Lord would thankful God for your hand upon our lives upon our congregation help those weren't able to make it today for whatever reason we know that your hand is upon them as well God just blessed us to help come together to find a good place that you would have provided for us Lord God I pray that you bless this service now may your hand be upon it may you speak to us from your word now Lord and pray that everything that we can do and say would be pleasing to you we rebuke every demonic spirit every devil every demon that would try to hinder or hurt this service in any way God that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done anointed speaker here now God as we do this according to your word and for your glory and honor now you edify us as a body of believers now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen lamentations lamentations chapter 4 we're just going to read one verse the verse 16 the anger of the Lord hath divided them he will no more regard them they respected not the persons of the priests they favored not the elders you could be seated if you'd like also meant to mention something that maybe will maybe I'll tell you afterwards I'm trying to debate I guess it's okay to put on video I heard the streaming I heard this week that and I don't believe it was a rumor I believe it was actually something that was that was true and nothing wrong is just someone had mentioned to me this week that they heard that or we're told that the voice of God fellowship and Northside fellowship was when two merchants together nothing consequential to us for that I'm glad they're able to do that I think that's a wonderful thing but I've tried to get in contact with somebody this week to find out if voice of God Fellowship is moving into Northside Fellowship what they're going to do with their facility I'm trying to call this money yesterday and I'm in contact it wasn't necessary that the area of town I wanted to be in but it is still on this side if you don't know it's at Prince and Romero if you know where Prince Romero is know exactly where Prince Romero is as where Ralph and her son Nathan works but back off from Mara behind the circle-k there's some commercial places back in there and invoicing my fellow should have been there ever since a work by church the Word of God closed by the mark on de pass and I've just it just came to my mind well if they're occupying that facility if it's probably I'm sure set up for church they've been there for years that we see maybe about trying to find that I'm just trusting the Lord to open the door if this is a door that the Lord is opening I don't want to ignore it I want to I want to step through it if it's his will and if not then he'll shut the door it's not it was not an option that's okay but you know unless the Lord comes and speaks audibly or tells you correctly or something you just just like we found the facility over here you know we found the facility over here because I was searching on Craigslist and I assumed they had rented it by the time we needed a place and I was just gonna go look for a hotel place but I had nothing in mind and Sonia's like well let's go see that place and I was like well that place is gone by now it was no Craigslist anymore so we drove down there that's how we got that place just turned out the guy was there and we discussed it he dropped the price from 250 to $100 a week and that's how we got the place that we were at for four years so if that's what the Lord is doing here then that's fine I want to I want to walk through the doors that the Lord is open for us and if that's what's happening here then praise the Lord and so this may keep you up to date let you know what's going on if that is a rumor if that isn't true well that's a different story too but however the Lord leads us that's where we want to go so just continue to pray for us and the and the congregation and if that's not it then I do believe the Lord has a place for us so just trust in that amen now let's get back to the word lamentations chapter 4 like we said we don't usually it's kind of rare you hear ministers preach from lamentations especially message ministers but lamentations is actually a very small book the lamentations of the weeping prophet Jeremiah and as Jeremiah went through all of the things if you if you've read through your Bible you know Jeremiah had a had in my opinion one of the hardest times and that any man of God had now there's been a lot of them and there's been a lot have very difficult times and and some difficult different struggles and things like that and you know Elijah just was you know resting on her juniper tree and one to God to kill him and said he was the last one and screaming and running from a woman and you know they've all had that but Jeremiah to me sticks out to a point that pretty much Jeremiah's in ministry I get to come in here and I get to preach to the gospel of Jesus Christ Jeremiah didn't have that I get to come in here and preach about the positivity of the blood of Christ and and what God's done for us and the prosperous nature that God in His grace and mercy and where we're going and but Jeremiah was basically charged with the responsibility of I don't know 95% of his ministry was was giving declaring judgment upon the house of Israel upon the children of Israel they had gotten so far away from God that his whole ministry was nothing but but prophesying things of disaster and and telling them how horrible they were doing and tell them how bad a people they had become and it'd be hard for us to come in here every Sunday and the Lord just hammer us every single time that the people had just gotten so evil that Jeremiah's entire ministry basically was based on telling these people how horrible they were how bad God was displeased with him and what the judgment of God was going to be late on that had been a horrible life that Jeremiah had to let it plus the persecution that came with it so subsequently King Jeremiah's lamentation now Jeremiah was of course absolutely a prophet of God a man of God a minister of God but as his life unfolded in the way it came about there came about these lamentations from Jeremiah and if you've ever lamented over something you can understand how he felt I mean he had five chapters of the lamenting the lamentations that that he had in his life and in his ministry and this five books here is accumulation of the lamentations of the lamenting that came from Jeremiah he could you imagine if if you knew that the people of God were like that and the message God gave in the vid and the dreams God gave you to to proclaim this disaster in this judgment upon them how you would lament over that how difficult that would be and that was that was where Jeremiah was when he when he wrote these lamenting these lamentations well one of these lamentations brings us to the thought that I wanted to bring today and again that's the sixteenth verse let me read it again and one of his lamenting was that the anger of the Lord had divided them God had became so displeased with his own people that he begin to divide them so and of course you know when you're divided it's easier it easier to be conquered when you're divided right that's why we should always stay unified always stay together as as I talked about the week before or last week and I will again you know we should never look down on one another for anything especially during this period of time or things become so are becoming so divisive that divisive nough swill try to creep into the body of Christ and and in our congregation and we got to keep where to that and make sure that that division doesn't come amongst their own ranks and then we feel divided amongst each other or look down or form or feel bad about somebody who's not in church or not wearing a mask or wearing a mask or something there's just the tricks of the devil to try to divide us right you do what you feel that of the Lord to do and I'll trust you and the God in you enough to know that God is leading you to do what you're doing as long as you afford me with the same of the same likeness in respect see if there's got to be retro Papa the in retrospect there's got to be both ways see it's come to the place today in this country that that people start believing what they're doing is right and there's no other way to do it so they have no respect for someone with the opposite opinion but see I have enough respect to believe that if you're a child of God God's leading you but you got to do the same thing for me for us and for one another that the God in me is leading me the ways leading me and telling me what to do and that's what I do and and you have respect for that and and I have respect for you and that's actually the message that I want to get to it kind of the Lord brought that out is respect I want to talk about respect cuz that's what God is talking about here he's dividing them you mean God is dividing him which makes them easily conquerable makes them easy to be contrasted they're divided he's dividing he will no more regard them now that's the respect it says regard but that's the same thing to have regard to something or someone is to respect that person or that thing to have respect will regard for is just saying that you look to that person of some with some type of esteem see because the word respect means if you just look it up in the dictionary not this you know in the Bible Greek or Hebrew but just in the regular Webster's dictionary respect is to consider worthy of a steam consider worthy of a steam and honor or have deep admiration or regard to someone's feelings is to respect that person if you respect that person you respect how they feel you respect what they think you respect their ambitions their ideas things like that you have respect for you might disagree with it but you have respect for them first as a human second as a godly person third is the Holy Ghost field person you have respects for that person to hold to have a deep admiration or an honor and esteem and and you hold that person's feelings in high regard you don't want to hurt that person or cause any harm if if it can be helped see that that's respect sometimes you respect a person to the point that you have to hurt their feelings because you care so much about them sometimes you have to say things that are hurtful be to the person directly because you respect them then love them so much you don't want to see disaster a harm come to them for the whole family right that's respect to a lot of people don't understand it's a part of respect that gets lost people say well they have no respect well they have so much respect they don't want you to go to hell that's the kind of respect that they have that's the twisted nature that this world looks at of course we talked about love in that manner but it's that respects course the love follows the respect you respect someone you're gonna love them but God is saying he's divided them and will no more respect them or regard them if there's there's not an esteemed there now there's not that that honor for that deep feeling of affection or admiration they lost that why did they lose it they respected not the persons of the priest they favored not the elders now if you go through Jeremiah you'll see how horribly bad that it had gotten and because they had lost their respects God lost or removed his regard regard for them because of their lack of respect for each other so you see what I'm saying God lost regard to them because they had refused to respect one another that brings us to the understanding of the respect that we should have for each other that respect that we have is first of all that were humans we respect God's creation we respect God's people we respect those that try to be godly people they may not see and live and see things the way we do or live the way we do they may not understand or know the message but we still have respect for them we might try to help them come to the place that they become born again and receive a revelation of the truths and things like that but that's done that should have no regard to the fact that we have for that persons or then to us and I have found that a lot of times if you offer respect you will get respect they will respect you if you respect them I respect your opinion I think you're wrong but I respect your opinion and then those that have the Holy Ghost well my goodness if you don't respect those that you believe are in the thorns though they do have the Holy Ghost whether you believe it or not if you don't have respect for them you don't have respect for God you don't have respect for God for anything you've lost at all because that's where these people had gotten they lost respect for the priesthood and for the ministers for that and and when they when they lost respect for God's people they lost respect for God in God then God took his regard of them away see so that respect has to be there and this division that's coming that that's in the world today makes it even harder it makes it even rougher because it's become an anointing I mean friend there's there's just very strong spirits that are out there now because remember we've talked about this before and this is nothing new but 67 years ago brother Brown told us that it's going to come to the place that that anointing is going to lift off of the Gentile bride and it's going to go back to the Jews and God is beginning to deal with them in the point that they're them and their people are gonna receive the Messiah now that won't be till after the brides at the the wedding supper of the Lamb but they're going to receive that so what's happening here is that Spirit of God is lifted well when the Spirit of God lives it feels with something else it backfields the Spirit of God lifts because remember that the Spirit of God failed at the day of Pentecost acts 2 you can see the Spirit of God came and it fell upon each one of them and the Spirit of God remained until the the Spirit began to lift off the people and when the Spirit began to live the Dark Ages set in because when when the spirit of godless impacts feel it back feels with something else will that Satan that's the devil because this is Satan see so the only thing that keeps Satan's Eden at bay and we'll just say if we could do it dramatically with with my actions here keep it at bay she could say it's sort of like the heads we talked about with job last week see that that anointing of spirit keeps that Satan's in that Bank it moves it aside and keeps it out well if that is when ting is here and that anointing is real in there then then it oppresses and puts and pushes aside the spirit of the enemy the spirit of Satan this is Satan's Eden not no doubt that Satan can still operate within that but he has very strict limitations when that anointing of God is there because the anointing God is the paramount of anointing or presence it is the Paramount so it even if Satan is pressing in he cannot go past that part that God has anointed so just like you had that that anointing and again my illustration here that that anointing is here on you on the people of God in pressing aside all of Satan's e now that doesn't mean that the effects of Satan Eden aren't pressing into you they then but the ability of Satan to be able to get to you like he would desire to is gone because this anointing is upon you the presence of God is upon you so Satan cannot get to you like he would desire to get to you he can't a little bit that spirit can come in well in that little microcosm of us as individuals you can see that as a whole as far as our nation and the Gentile world is will say as a whole because when that anointing is there then it keeps that that real oppressive demonic Satan's Eden for coming in and full force but as the Spirit of God lifts it back fills with Satan's II so as God's Spirit is lifting the spear of Satan is becoming more prominent and more demonstrative more becoming thicker and harder and he noticed that we've had sin since the Garden tea but you've noticed this for those who are you know oh I'd say over 40 maybe even more because things change so drastically now I mean Micah just turned dirty and tap Toby 27 to say we weren't gonna say that too later but anyway so I use my daughter I don't and plus when you're under 30 it doesn't count this anyway so in that in that light in that situation if you're if you're that age you remember back years ago were you know there was sin in the country that was sin in the world but it but it would just come in and it would just feel free and you can see you know a little bit of rock'n'roll or you know you can see like only bikers and and military men got tattoos and piercings and I remember when I was in school and it was like you could only get if you're a guy if you got one year pierce you were kind of funny if you got the other one you were cool you know but you know most regular guys didn't do it that was just kind of the fringe extreme so it was a spirit but it wasn't something just over cane but nowadays when you see those spirits or those enemies come in it just is like a bulldozer that spirit becomes so thick and it's not something that's just a friend stuff it's just immediate and definite and it's because the Spirit of God is it is lifting and the more the Spirit of God is the harder those spirits are gonna come in and slam the people that aren't ready for it the only thing protecting you is that buffer that gods give us that anointing that we still have even though that general spirit anointing is lifting that is that anointing spirit is still on you as an individual amen so that broad / sweeping spirit may be lifting but God's people still are anointed and have his presence around them to keep that from coming in like a flood on them keeps it at bay now he'll come in sometimes and you'll upset the applecart if you will he'll do this that he'll try to upset you but he can't come in like you'd like to because that presence is still there so that being said that that spirit is it lifts those spirits are becoming harder and harder and I noticed because of that the respects and the true love of people is being lost it is just going away it's probably more prevalent and nor noticeable in our government than maybe anywhere else as Americans in the United States I want prominent and and prevalent in our government than anywhere else but I believe I've told you this before this country was built on the Constitution this country the men of God wrote the Constitution put in the Bill of Rights to make sure that individual people's freedoms and liberties are protected now you see that eroding quite drastically nowadays it doesn't matter what you want doesn't matter what you think doesn't matter what your individual liberties might be they're gonna tell you what they want you to do period and they don't really care some people come and say well you know we need to obey the law I agree with that we do but this is not a law wearing that mask is not a law but we do it out of respect this again is not a battle I'm gonna fight see I'll fight to have church I'll fight to do something for the Lord but just wearing a mask that's not worth the battle but it's not a law but you notice how those opinions and respects have changed so drastically and I was getting ready to make this statement and I'm instead of here before I probably have that our nation be founded on that and our individual liberties the First Amendment was the first one they wrote I mean you would think the first is probably the most prominent freedom of speech right everybody has the right to express their opinions they don't have the right to burn down buildings and bust out glasses windows and doors and stuff but they have a right to their own opinion and that's fun that's one thing that this country was built upon was being able to express our freedoms to express our thoughts to express our feelings and opinions but if you don't at the same time respect the other person's feelings the other person's opinion respectfully lovingly without dissemination without respect of persons event we can't do it with respect to person if we do it based on a person's religion or a person's nationality our person's color or a person's race if we do it for any other any reason then it's not valid then you're showing respects a person that is not valid see you've lost the whole program there it's got to be really respects regardless of who the person is regardless of where they came from regardless of who they worship if a Muslim wants to walk through that door to shake my hand I'll shake his hand I'll love him just like I love you I'll try to help him find the truth get into Jesus Christ and they help save his soul but I'll respect him for it right now if you wants to walk through that door with the vest on to blow us all up that's a little different story again that's a little different story but it doesn't matter that you understand see now that's where the respects are lost that's what's happened today the that first amendment the freedom of speech do you do you know that I've heard a statistic the other day that they did now I'm not a big polar statistic person because I think they're all skewed in favor of whoever took the statistic on the poll but they said the statistics are down that that college students between the ages of 19 and 25 now over 50% of them do not believe in the First Amendment they do not believe in the freedom of speech one of the very most foundational blocks that this country was built upon the young people being raised today do not believe it you know why because they have gotten so indoctrinated that what they're saying and how they say it is right they have no respect for what you say they have no respect and don't want to even a year what your opinion is because it can't be right if it's contrary to theirs that's how every I mean most of all about we're living in Satan's Eden and and the civilization and the inventions and cars and houses and buildings and cities and that's all of the devil hospitals police education that's all of the devil that's all of civilization that came from Cain starting from Cain you go back to the Bible reading that's where it started with Cain when set came forth men began to call on God that's Satan's essence I want to be in that lineage now we enjoy the comforts and the things of a society and things that's going on but we're in the world not of the world I have been it's been it had been on my heart I actually been singing it in my spirit most of the morning and it really energized me this morning when I heard Zach get up and sing in this world is not my home praise the Lord I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blues Amen that done my heart good because that's what the truth of it is see but we we can't be like that gods shooters a lot not like that and and furthermore we cannot allow that to become a part of our of our lives we can't get so caught up in those things because again that politics mana in a Runion heartbeat many of the person become a politician became a devil just because of the spirit that surrounds that thing but you can't let that come any gulf you and separate and start looking back down and thinking about people and and and losing respects you know if you lose respect for somebody not only would you not be able to help that person if you ever get the opportunity not only you not be able to help that person but you won't want to help that person and God help us if we ever get to the place that there's anybody on this earth that we don't want to help if there's anybody that we want to try to lead to Christ if there's anybody that we want to help try to get their souls to God if there's one person that we don't want to see that way friends we got to come to an altar because we've lost it somewhere right we should always feel that way about everybody doesn't matter who they are but it's so easy Satan will try to get in there and and disturb that now worse than that would even be in our own homes and our own families and our own church don't let it be so we've got to maintain that and as we do that God will respect us amen God has respect for us we have respect for him when we have respect for his people we have respect for his creation we have respect for what God does sakes I always want to try to maintain myself into a point that if anybody needs help I don't care who they are I can help them not only that I could help them but that I'd want to help them I would desire to help them if I don't have respect for a person you're not going to have a desire to help that person do you understand that if we've lost respect for somebody we don't want to help that person because you don't respect them enough to try to help them and even if you tried it would be with cynicism you would think oh well I'll tell them something they're not gonna listen and I'm gonna pay attention they don't care that's just the devil if you go into that attitude just forget it like God use somebody else to do it and go somewhere brain get your heart right with God James chapter 2 I want to get to this before my time gets gets away had so much in Milan I completely forgot to record this did the recorder for anything specific but I've been recording those as well as the streaming so but anyway just that one won't be today James chapter 2 let's begin with verse 1 James has very good take on it here James chapter 2 my brethren have not have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory with respects of persons if you call yourself a Christian if you believe you to be a part of a man or woman a child of God you don't have respects a person God doesn't he said we cannot have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory and have the respects of persons can't do it because if you respect God you respect all that is God you respect all that God created now there's people in this world that I believe in him said that just are here because he come through the act of procreation a man and woman that's the law of God but that doesn't mean that God doesn't love that person right doesn't mean that God wouldn't want that person to come to him he knows who will and who want but doesn't mean he doesn't want them to he would or his will is and he would to have everybody come to repentance so if that's his desire that's our desire so we can't do it with respects a person for if they're come unto you assembly a if anyone come into your assembly a a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and they're coming also a poor man in vowel raiment and he have respect to him that we're at the gay club they can say unto Him sit down here in a good place and say to the poor stand out there or sit here under my footstool are ye not then partial in yourselves under becomes judges of evil false which is exactly what a lot of what goes on in the world today is people have become judges of other people's sparks and intense people will say well this person did this because of so and so well you don't know that you can say you believe that but that doesn't make it so unless that's been proven documented or that individual said that themselves you don't know what they're thinking you don't know how they feel but you have to have respect in that person regardless of what you think or thought they might be thinking one of the judges of people's pause we are the judges of people's actions we know them by the fruits they bear right amen now I don't mean judge in the way that you know a lot of times people talk about in churches of judges we're not being a judge to condemn we're just being a judge to correct if that makes sense we're understanding that that person is not living a life that would be pleasing to the Lord so that person needs to understand this is displeasing to the Lord sometimes you may hurt a person's feelings by helping them to see the error of their way but in doing that you may save a soul as well but we don't do it with with the with the thought of judging a person's fault a person's if a person doesn't say it their thought is just their property if their thought becomes words it becomes everybody who hurt its property if it's but that's that's one of the worst things about social media in my opinion is everybody puts it out there and then it's the world's thoughts not just a few people that heard you say it that's why I had the cameras turned off the other day to some things you say you don't want everybody to hear it's for just a person or a group of people right see but you can't judge their thought that's their property you don't know that's what their intent was you can say well this look like this look like this like this and that's fine and a lot of people look at and judge based on that but you don't know unless that person said that or actually did that you don't know see you can't judge their thoughts as such if it might have something in their heart there I'll go back for just a moment I want to read these quotes but I'll go back for just a moment as I had told you about the testimony of that sister Nadine words gave I got it on my camera oh my own my phone I can show it to you I'd love to show it to you maybe sometime but I went back and looked at it again her testimony about her dad you know her dad they went to a funeral brother Brandon was there and she was crying brother Graham came up and said you know sister Nadine are you okay she was crying and and she said I know my dad's in hell and you know she said he had no time for preachers he'd go to church and all these things you know but what she's doing is perceiving the man's fault because he didn't go to church it was because he hated God because he didn't want to speak to ministers is because he hated God at every road that normally normally that's probably true normally that's probably true but you can't judge that based on that evidence alone that's as you would say circumstantial evidence I hope I'm not losing I'm just trying to make a point here she thought her daddy was in hell because the thoughts she perceived that he had based on his action is that she was he didn't go to church well he wasn't a Christian didn't love God didn't have time for ministers because you know he didn't want to be a Christie infidel he must hate God because he wanted her go to church didn't want to talk to any ministers or anything like that took infidelities and unbeliever he's going to hell but brother Ram came up to her at her testimony put his finger in her face and looked at her she said only brother branham could look at you I don't know what that's like because he never looked at me maybe if he looked at you he put his finger in her face and she said looked at her the old only brother branham could look at you and said sister Nadine can't we be happy or thankful whatever words were that God judges by the heart God looks at a man's heart he said I believe that your daddy will be there with you and your mother on that day well now what was he judging what was he looking at what was God looking at what was she judging what was her respect at that point for her dad pretty low if she thought he was going to hell but what was brother branham stop what was his respect ultimately what was God's cuz God wasn't judging whether man set foot in church he was judging the man's heart what was in his heart now most of the time that's probably going to be true if it's in your heart it's going to compel you to want to go who knows I've known I've known people before that wouldn't do something or would do something a certain way and you think well that's just kind of cockeyed why would they do that it's kind of an odd way of why would they do that or why would they not do this and I'd get to know people and come to find out that persons like that because of their childhood or something they went through in their early adulthood or something that shaped their spirit to the point that that that just ended it that was all of it I mean one when we started the church in Florida I went to visit people that were faithful church attendees before certain things happened at another church they were faithful attendees they went to church all the time then with this happened at that church they quit going and I go witness to them they would never set foot in another Church does that mean they're going to I would say no they might but that doesn't mean that they are because of that you understand where that that level of respect has to stay or it has to maintain to say well I still believe you to be a son or daughter of God for some reason in their life and their spirit they can't get beyond that one point but that's not their fault god help them so well they should be stronger and move forward what let you go through it and see how you feel about it it's a lot of what's missing in the world today as well walking them all and no man's market that's another thing is missing so desperately today people want to criticize and complain and down this and that one without it walking a few minutes in their shoes trying to understand why they might be that way or why they might have done a certain thing it's all because the respect has been gone the respect has been lost god help us don't ever let it creep into us that's ungodly friend I'm trying to tell you today having that lack of respect is ungodly look what brother Branham said here in rig in the in the message respects 1961 he said I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way you understand what he's saying he's not saying I literally am afraid of my congregation he's not saying I am literally afraid of my wife what his fear is or what his teaching of that was at the time was I'm afraid lest I make a mistake or I'd do something to cause a stumbling block to be put in your way or my wife or my mother whatever he said to you see that that presence of fear brings a presence of respect because you fear hurting that person of putting a stumbling block so that respect that you have for them becomes prevalent then it's a part of your relationships a part of how you feel towards that person I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian you understand that now see you've got before you can have respects you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respect God demands respect amen and we respect the Lord right we often say that we respect the Lord in but in what way just because we think we know who he is or because we think he's going to send us to hell or because why is it that we believe we have respect for God and why is it that we think that people think that they have respect for God when they don't have respect for one another certain people are very demonstrative about taking other's lives while at the same time doing it in the name of a god well if you respect that God who commands respect you're gonna respect those that he created if you really think he's God see the fallacy of some religions out there today isn't even easy to even comprehendible it's not even defensible to understand certain religions in this world today they have so little respect for human life but yet they do it in the name of their God who they claim created everything how can you have respect for God that created everything and not had respect for his creation you can't do it both ways amen God demands respect but that respect comes from a reverence comes from a fear understand proverbs probably we'll get back to James but proverbs 9 we know what's odd this about just reading here in proverbs 9 verse 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding the fear of the Lord is the beginning what does them think we know that quote we know that scripture the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom what is that that fears what brings that respect that God demands that respect it's reverence it's considered of worthy of esteem honor deep migration see that's the feeling of the respect we have for God well if that same thing with God we have that same feeling to each other to one another just like brother grant thank you I fear lest I do something that they might think I'm not a Christian God demands respected that because that God is God he deserves respect that's right and he we've got to respect him and give a fear to him that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants for all his servants God demands respect for his servants you remember one time when Miriam disrespected Moses race Miriam disrespected Moses talked about and laughed about it and she was immediately struck with leprosy unfortunately a lot of spiritual leprosy going on in this world today they may not be breaking out in white blotches in their face falling off but there's spiritual leprosy or the spiritual aspect of the life is eroding away just like a cancer because of their lack of respect oh my help us Lord you said well I don't agree with that person that doesn't mean you lost you lose your respect for that person amen then you then as you respect that servant you respect God and when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other we are respecting God exactly now I just I wasn't gonna read these till later but I just got to this point so let me read this here we'll get through this and I'll close here in the globe see on the same message respect if you can't respect the man respect the office that he holds in God so there you go see now he covers that part that point now has been covered for us if you can't respect the man respect the office of the office he holds in God that's exactly right respect him you know there's there's people out there there's there's ministers that I'll be honest with you I disagree probably 98% Christian ministers saying they're preaching from the Bible but if they walk through that door I'd hug their neck and call it my brother absolutely would I don't want to call any names and I'm not talking about the message I just you know people that you've heard on the radio or seen on TV or televangelists or something people with these big huge mega churches and whatever there's a lot of things out here I'd absolutely disagree with but if they walk through that folks brother walk through that door I'd hook their deck right even if one of those women came through there wouldn't up her neck but I'd shake her hand and say god bless you you ever listened you have you ever done a study or looked at how brother branham talked about any simple mcpherson the most well-known revered woman and creature of his day brother madam showed a lot of respect for that woman he even after her passing he showed a lot of respect in the things that you read about her now he had talked about she should have been preaching he'll talk about that he disagreed with her but he had respect for her that's that guy shoot that's we can't lose that all right because I'm trying to help us to understand that's a godly aspect yes it's a godly aspect to have respect there's a place over there you feel you go where you feel comfortable that's a that's a godly attribute respect is the godly attribute now if I can't get anything else through you today that get that locked in respect for one another is a godly contributor I'm gonna get it I'm not gonna call it political but it just came to my mind so I'm gonna say when a man black white green purple yellow service person policeman preacher layman ditch digger out here who press is another human being I don't care what these black white purple green yellow blue down on the ground for ten minutes where he can't breathe and immerse him that's the lack of respect that person has lost respect not yet necessarily just for that one individual but for all of humanity you don't do something like that unless you have absolutely lost respect and disrespect the human race may be that person individually but if that thing is in your heart you don't care anything about human life and human life being precious amen personally I think it has a lot more to do with the fact that the man was a cop and not a cop but anyway does that that's my point though it doesn't matter what matters is having respect for one another if you have respect for one another you're gonna treat that person with respect whether you're a cop or civilian whether you're a restaurant worker I should say oh wait staff or a customer you understand that person is gonna treat you respect you a treat with respect it's so easily lost today friend we have to hold on to that and again we can't let it become a part of our lives see if you can't respect the man respect office he holds in God I'd absolutely walk through that door shake his hand hug his neck or whatever respect him if if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him I've heard of congregations talk about their pastor how just talk about him running down ridicule him how is that pastor ever going to do anything for you he cannot help you if you feel that way the respect has to be there if it's not then if majority of the church feels that way you vote that pit that preacher out you get a different one if that's the leading of the Lord if you're the only one that feels that way find your pastor wherever he is you go find him because God is your godly Holy Ghost filled person God's got a pastor for you go sit under him I had a brother one time told me in Florida that someone so is his pastor I was for a while I said well if that's what you believe then you need to move there right you need to go there and Senator that his ministry and give that church where tithes in attendance that's how you remember of that church we don't have rolls but you have a way of respecting that ministry in that church and that's by being there and paying your tithes and offerings into that into that work in like that very much but it's the truth I think they finally actually did I know they actually finally didn't move but that's just I'm sorry friend it's just the way I feel that's that's how respects come I didn't have any disrespect for them anybody that leaves his church or whatever that's nobody's disrespect to me God's got a pastor for everybody and if I'm not you find him were Korea's find him was that's the person that's ordained to lead you through amen it's got to be there the Holy Ghost has made him overseer that you've got to respect him in that manner see no matter what the pastor done if you respect him in your heart God's servant that will respect you for doing it amen and brother Branham goes on talks about I may disagree with the man's theology and such but let's move on with this James chapter 2 let me finish this because I'm going to close here you find out where I left off here even judge IVA Faust v first hearken my beloved brother had not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith Amen I'm thankful for that and heirs of the kingdom which he had promised to them that love him but he have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seat my I'd like to go somewhere there but we're gonna but this is so true oh my Bobby no more evident than what's going on this country today do not they blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called if you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well amen and now notice that again that's just like you said in Matthew I mean just like back in Leviticus if you love your neighbor as thyself you do well remember Jesus gave that the rich young ruler is one of the commandments what in one of the Ten Commandments and don't covet and things like that but it doesn't say but it does say in Leviticus in the law when God's giving the law through Moses in the Vidigal the Ten Commandments but then it's so important that Jesus told the rich young ruler that same thing you need to love your neighbor as yourself well Jesus said here if you fulfill the Royal law court of the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well well if you love your neighbors yourself then you're gonna have respect for that person and who is your neighbor not just the message believer I'm just the person sitting on the chair next to you not just the local churches down the street or in this city or town or even in this country its whoever you come across everybody anybody doesn't matter who it is anybody but if you have respect to persons you commit sin god help us if you have respect to persons you commit sin and ye are convinced of the law as trans graders as transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery all said also do not kill now if they'll commit no adultery yet if thou killed thou art become a transgressor of the law and if you have no respect for persons as loving thy neighbor's yourself then it's the same difference amen you have transgressed the law you have transgressed God's commandment God's law but it's important if God has no respecter of person we should not have any respecter of ours no matter who they are that respect has got to be there again and that fear fear of the Lord but also a fear of others you put it up others but as the point is that you had fear that you might do something that would cause a stumbling block or cause you to disbelieve or cause you to go astray or something or or or cause somebody to feel less about you than they ought to go out to help us none of us want to do that none of us want to be that way that we live our lives according to God's Word according to God's holy ordinance we live our lives so that we we fall under the auspice of of the word and it respects for God as we have respects for each other you know brother Brandon said God would rather me love him love you than love well it's the same if the respect and the loves is is relations if you respect out of love then it's gonna be the same way I respect you I respect him if I don't have respect for you how can I have respect free now Amen that respect now that respect will breed obedience if you have respect you're gonna have obedience you're gonna you're gonna desire to do out of respects what God commands amen and maybe Lord bloom will talk about that later but we'll just end up there but that respect now remember that respect is it is the godly attribute that God has gift to us that we are to display to one another amen never look down so well that person's poor that person is out here begging don't look down on that person I'm not telling you give me any money that's up to you what you feel led to do of God telling you that but don't disrespect that person don't look down on that person I mean I've seen perfectly healthy 20 year-olds out there now with my tip almost I was about to go up and say you know the winner still tiring but I didn't wanted to sound disrespectful but it just seems to me like sometimes that's the solution to homelessness and just go get a job but anyway that but again even outside of that that you don't lose you can't lose respect in that way amen and again if you lose respect for anybody you can't help that person if you have completely lost respect for someone you're not going to want to help that person because you don't respect them enough to to deem them worthy of your time and presence God is that's an ungodly thought that someone would not be worthy of your time and presence to be able to help them in some way they been got to maintain that respect respects in the church respects and should the the Christian family respects in in God and in God's family amen any and humanity and all they got did go one more place and I'm gonna quit you know brother man talked about and you know brother Brad was a hunter brother man I'm hunted and killed thousands of animals in his lifetime probably I would guess probably thousands from the squirrels to the you know the big game and stuff like that he probably maybe not that many buddy I'm hundreds will say at least in his life but you know the same man that did that said I'll take one time that if a person goes and just shoots and kills an animal just to let it late for no reason he called that murder yes now I'm the first person then then up to hear what the dogs is human thing I'm tired of seeing them in my stores and my restaurants I'm just up to here with the dogs but anyway I don't agree with someone taking his shooting or killing an animal like that brother Graham called it murder now my thought of that was because of the lack of respect that you have for God's creation God created that animal and you just go kill it let it lay for no reason that's wrong that's wrong because that's disrespecting God's creation right amen just another thought so if it comes to even animal life Ram what is it for us as humans amen let's stand if we could help us Lord to always and continue to have respect and honor for one another love for one another look up to one another be respectful of one another and have that respect not just not just here in our church but for each one whomever God sends us to amen I'm so thankful that God put us put in us to be able to do that amen thank you Jesus let's see this on the course here number 375 you have your songbook there I don't know what I would do we'll see this before we go today song number 375 [Music] you see it one time through [Music] I don't know what I do without we [Music] I me my [Music] my [Music] I amen thank you Jesus

you do just go back make it right you know it happens you have to if you got the Holy Ghost amen you don't need someone there God or me or someone there God's there you got the Holy Ghost you'll tell you make it right you get that back in the situation it should be make it right amen praise the Lord and we keep from the keep from allowing that stumbling block to come in there amen and shake things up but we just learn to stay in the presence of the Lord amen so God realization please preciate each one of you coming today appreciate those who were on the hook up today Amen I prayed the Lord
