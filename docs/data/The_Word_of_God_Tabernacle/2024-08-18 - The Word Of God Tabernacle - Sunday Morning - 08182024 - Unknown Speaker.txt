doing surgery on a pinky toe only thing I ever know they do to a Pinko is they buy wear a boot or don't wear shoes or something they don't normally do anything to a pinky toe so sometimes I've seen them they'll take the pinky toe and the next the toe next to it together or something but uh they don't never know to do surgery anything like that so um anyway but that's why they're not here this morning they were in the hospital this morning so please remember them if you will brother Danny's not with us this morning woke up this morning with a sore throat headache so uh please pray for him

situation doesn't just keep coming to a Christian Church unless there's something there in her heart or mind or something is moving on her to cause her to keep coming back so she didn't just come to one and just ditch it and say you people are crazy she kept coming back and kept coming back and uh actually developed little relationships I know my wife was in contact with her proba any different on so there's a reason for it uh so please continue to remember her in prayer as well anyone have an unspoken request I WR a request oh that's right I'm sorry it's behind here thank you brother for

that are sick and Afflicted this morning and Lord we we love him we want to see him healed we want to see him in church we want to see him just get the victory over those sickness yes Lord yes and Lord I can recall that the last sermon You Preach you descended into hell and you snatched the keys off the devil of death hell in the grave and Lord You Preach this day the scriptures are fulfilled thank you Lord to the unrepented souls in the days of Noah and Enoch and Lord your Prophet said there'll come a time where that will repeat in the last days where the gospel is the true word the spiritual food and due season is preach yes God and people won't line up because they have come into the place of Souls and prison and we don't know what time that will happen Jesus but it brings a soberness in our hearts how people and claim to be Believers following your great end time message that fail to line up to your word go to church pay your ties pray one for another truly love one another to have a burden for one another amen to support the ministry in any way they can it's a sobering hour Lord speak to our hearts for we're going to miss it Lord if we're not um right with you we're not prayed up we're not walking in the spirit we know that we can't even begin to pray right if we're still walking in the flesh as uh psalmist Davis said one time if I regard iniquity in my heart you will not hear me yes and Lord speak to our hearts there are many that we love that are dealing with sickness and Lord our sister Lydia it's a good report Lord that she's getting much better

will know if you live that life they will know yes amen praise the Lord Jesus amen God bless you today and let's stand to our feet we'll go ahead and turn to the word now amen appreciate the Lord's goodness amen we're going to continue on with the thought that we've had of course the past few weeks um on the U spiritual growth here statue of perfect man uh however we want to label it Call it second Peter uh we're going to go back to Second Peter chapter 1 in our reading there we've got to the point of godliness I really uh honestly to be honest I really did not realize that this was um I thought this a service maybe two tops didn't realize it we get to this degree but it seems like each week that the Lord does this there's I he put some on my heart more to say uh come up than uh I obviously have planned but uh it's not our plans that matter anyway is it it's the Lord's that's what he wants amen what he wants is what matters the most so praise the Lord so we're on uh s and we on godliness now second Peter chapter 1 before we read let's just bow our heads again for word of PR good precious Lord Jesus father again us a privilege to Bow our heads toward the dust from when our bodies came knowing Lord that the Regeneration the Rejuvenation the the spirit of God that has come into each of us Lord today God believing and feeling that spirit and knowing to be true Lord not only quickened you but it would Quicken our mortal body yes that body Lord that we know of that came from the dust of the earth father to be regenerated renewed made fresh again father glorified Lord in that state God that you call us to be this day Lord we desire to live the very life that you put upon us to live God and that is your life that life that is in US father to let that life live through Us in whatever capacity way God that it be that we could show once again in US Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever Lord we thank you for this word we thank you for the promise of your word Lord all the precious promises that are in that word God that means so much to us Lord we hold them dear and we thank you for it Lord we thank you Lord for not only being the author of that word the finisher of that word but you are the one that brings that word to life you're the one that shows that word to our to us Lord and reveals it to us and that that word doesn't just be a dead letter on pages it comes off and lives within the believer of that word amen and Lord that live that living of that life comes the very Earnest the very the very truth of the life of Jesus Christ in us today thank you Lord for your blessings thank you Lord for this message thank you Lord for this truth Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way Lord that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is done now pray that you bless this service remaining part of it those who have come Lord those who may be streaming Lord we just commit ourselves to your hands and ask your blessings upon it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen second Peter uh fir uh second Peter chapter 1 we'll begin reading with the fifth verse again besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to temperence patience to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sin there uh wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fallen you could be seated if you like right amen God bless the reading of his word today again we're going to uh uh we we went through faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience now we're getting into godliness um a lot like Temperance and patience intertwined a good bit not that all of them don't and of course all of them build off of Faith uh but as Temperance and patience kind of coupled together uh more so so does God in and brotherly kindness uh many scriptures of course uh of the ones the few that I read there's obviously those who are Bible readers those who know your Bible know there's many more places many more scriptures many more incidences that we could go into and read that are uh uh in effect uh fall in line with these virtues with these attributes uh I just pick a few out I I find a few the things that the Lord put on my heart uh things that the Lord may show me and study and those are the things I write down uh it reminds me that time when brother green talked about uh brother brandham and how he got a message and uh he said uh uh he said he would get a subject or a topic the Lord would give he feel the Lord give him and and a scripture and then uh he go look and find this scripture and it goes with this scripture and he goes and he finds this scripture and he goes with this scripture and brother R told Brother green says you think you're getting lucky lucky he said but that's the Lord guiding you that's the Lord leading you that's the Lord showing you and putting on in your mind in your rembrance things that that that help that that God wants to be said that God wants to be illuminated uh again so many things that we could read on each subject so many things in the scripture obviously this Bible full of the all of attributes but those things that are that are uh that that are in God's mind to bring to illuminate for that period of time for that specific subject for that specific reason and sometimes for a specific person that's in that service for a specific person that may be watching or may watch archives you don't know but the Lord gives those things for reason the purpose and that's why you look and you say well why didn't you read that scripture or I could think of that scripture to go to that uh I only do what I feel the Lord puts on my heart to do I write down the notes if the Lord gives it to me I put it there read it sometimes it gives me something standing here and and we go into that but it's whatever he wants that's that's what we want the most of amen and that in itself for all of us not just a minister but for all of us is uh an attribute of godliness it is an attribute of godliness that God would put in entrust in you his own word the truth of his own word amen he doesn't want his uh his word Trampled Under feet his word is PR precious amen that's why we don't cast our Pearl Before Swine we make sure that we that we do it is according to the Lord and then the Lord takes care of that praise the Lord I've had some people ask me before said well uh why don't you tell so somebody so and so such and such that's well uh didn't come to me to say and I'm not going to say it if it doesn't come to me to say because there's a reason for that uh why didn't you talk to that person well uh the Lord didn't un me to talk to that person uh yeah they may not be a believer but maybe they are and somebody else down the road supposed to be ordained to talk to I don't know that's up to God that's not up to me so how could you not be ordained to talk to him you're a Believer it's in God's hands not mine yes I've told you several times I had I've had people in the car and some people I witnessed a lot some people witnessed a little bit um and sometimes I would get done and leave a person I'm thinking my why didn't I say that my why didn't I say one night uh I I dropped a guy off and we had good discussion always from the airport had good discussion took him way up to Oro Valley and uh and when we got done I I was pulling out and I thought wow why didn't I say that then I thought why didn't I say that not why there's like two or three things that come to me after I dropped him off I thought why didn't I say that now why I said Lord why didn't I say that and the Lord came back to me and said because it I didn't give it to you to tell him it wasn't for you to tell him um now he gave me a reason I'll keep that to myself but uh it's the obedience to the Lord and and God has a way of doing that now if that fell down the road if somebody else maybe I'll see him again down there I don't know I probably wouldn't remember him but anyway you never know it's up to the Lord that's what matters the most and again that that all is a part of of of godliness in your life of God in your life Jesus never wasted a single word Jesus never did anything that didn't have a purpose Jesus never went anyone or did anywhere didn't speak to anyone if there wasn't a reason Jesus himself said I only do what the father shows me and what he shows me that's what I'm going to do amen that's godliness uh well that does that didn't end when Jesus Christ passed away amen it didn't end when brother Brandon passed away amen uh didn't begin when brother brandom was born it's been here it's always been here it's still here and it's for every one of us to fall as a part of godliness the reverence to be holy to be like God piety if you will a lot of piety I sometimes piety has kind of a negative connotation with the fake piety or fake Holiness or pretend Holiness but uh to be reverent to be holy Godly living that life being the one that God can use Amen to produce his life on this Earth again to be an individual that God can live through that God can speak through these hands should be God's hands these feet should be God's feet this voice should be God's voice what we do what we say how we act where we go Jesus again never wasted a single syllable what he spoke had purpose had meaning had reason to be said everywhere he went everything he did now I know it's not that necessarily to that degree for us amen but uh but in in the percentage or in the placement of of of God leading us the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of God yes and being led of God and doing the things that God would have us do see we all have a purpose we all have a reason for being here we all have our unique ways we all have our unique upbringings we all have our unique uh ways of representing things or personalities or or or things that we do I I think that's a lot of the reason why God has a five-fold Ministry there's there there's men that God raised in a way that uh they their their gift is to to teach to be a to be a teacher and there's people that have that gift that can just lay that word out and teach it and and bring it in a way where people can understand it right bring it in a way where people where it comes forth not just with the spirit but with a gift of understanding that people can receive it amen same with pastors same with uh evangelists whatnot uh you know God to me God likes a a fire under an evangelist or a missionary lights a fire under him to go send him go preach the gospel go wherever God sends you I know it's kind of squelching in this last days but that's what that's what that purpose is for amen is to be able to do that and every one of us are a part of a Ministry every one of us are are are in our own way that part of God that God put in you to send you forth to do the purpose and the point uh the place that God wants you to do that God wants you to be that people that God wants you to meet the life that God wants you to live amen I I I know we're probably not to the place of wasting a syllable or of verse or or or a sentence uh like Jesus but the godliness that God gives us the Holiness the righteousness uh the reverence to be like God you say how do I be like God best way I know is to read the Bible amen yes and and exemplify everything he did that's the best way because Jesus is God in flesh well who better to learn of how to be God than God himself Amen to know it to read it to let that word uh uh permeate through your life Jesus himself said in Matthew 5:48 and we've said this scripture a couple of times over the past few weeks be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect again that is not sinless Perfection amen like he was sinless Perfection but that is the maturity that's to grow up that's to let that is to let the godliness uh uh uh of of who he is who his attributes are live through you yeah that's what being perfect is it's not being sinless it's living your life in a way that that produces Jesus Christ in flesh again yes amen amen in the maturity and and and in the adulthood and the Snapping I know uh I don't know if they're watching but you know when you're kids I know when our kids were kids I know when I was kids uh when I was a kid and and my sister was a good bit older than I was but even when I was getting you know uh before I became a teenager it's always we fuss and fight all the time bicker that's that's that was my dad always we just bicker uh not necessarily fighting we never called it fighting although we did fight a couple of times but bicker back and forth Just and that's but when you grow up you don't you don't get to that uh we kept the grandkids last week and you know Joel and Em are brother and sister and uh have to ask me they fight no I don't fight they just they they just bicker you know back and forth I know Gabriel and Alice don't do that you know but bicker just just back and forth just like a woodpecker on a tree back and forth and and and just bicker and back and but see when you become a mature Christian that all that all that goes away uh there's there's no bickering there's no just trying to prove that you're right all the time or trying to pro pro prove a point all the time I think I may have told you this story one time I was uh uh back East I I went around a lot because I wasn't pastoring until I went to Florida uh but would go to different services and Minister different places and go to special meetings and things like that it was always always happening in the South North Carolina South Carolina Georgia around Tennessee in that area uh it was always something going on going to different meetings and stuff and um and it was just like there's always these there was these camps like and I I just remember this one specific time my wife wasn't with me but we went to a shony and uh these two brothers they just could not leave each other alone they had differing opinions they had differing views uh I honestly 30 years later don't even remember it what it was about but I remember the bickering was so bad and the and the and the con back and forth they were drawing the attention of people all around us and I'm sitting here thinking instead of talking about Jesus Christ and edifying God and bringing his presence in our fellowship all they did was fuss and fight and bicker to where all the people around us looking at thinking no those people Christians there there're they're they're supposed to be Christians they're over there fighting bickering and complaining and at one another and back and forth and trying to prove each other wrong but this that and just just be a brother I mean if the Lord puts something on your heart to say or mention or a scripture or something or quote that's one thing but just to bicker back and forth and that's when they reminded me that same thing back and forth just back and forth and P but see the thing of it was there was no godliness to that because everybody around us all the people in the restaurant I noticed cuz I I wasn't a part of the bickering I wasn't going to I I don't I don't do that I don't to get into that in fact uh most of the time I refrain from going to all the ministers meetings they used to have back there because all they ended up doing was fighting and I'm not going to do that so uh I know I know in whom I believe I know what I believe uh what I believe the Lord has revealed to me if the Lord's revealed it to me you're definitely not going to talk me out of it so why what's the point if we're not going to stand there and be brothers and love one another and fellowship then everybody in the restaurant or not everybody but a lot of people especially right were just kept looking and as we got up and walked out they kept adding each other walking out of the restaurant and everybody we passed by everybody's looking over thinking these two and they're supposed to be Christians just fighting just bickering back and forth and they're supposed to be Christians I thought this is not the kind of example that we should leave for these people in this restaurant this is not the way that we should conduct ourselves with each other even in private with each other I know the Bible says to uh to uh uh to to reason together I I I understand that but contention bring Pride brings contention T contention brings strife and strife brings anger and anger is not the emotion that we should be uh bringing up in our lives or in front of people yeah so it was it was just the opposite of what we're supposed to be it's just the opposite of this scripture be therefore perfect just the opposite of of of being mature being a grownup Christian amen nothing wrong with giving your point of view nothing wrong with giving a scripture or something like that but just a constant bickering back and forth it accomp and I and honestly we went to our cars accomplished absolutely nothing as far as I could see of what happened then and in the future never accomplished a thing except for all those people in that restaurant that night thought we must have been crazy we did not produce Jesus Christ in front of anybody in that restaurant that night and that's a sad thing yes amen should not be that that way it should be everywhere we go and in everybody's presence we meet they should realize that there's a presence there of Jesus Christ yes amen not just you not just me but there's a presence there amen they may not know what it is they may not recognize fully but they can know and acknowledge there's something different amen there's something different about that may not say anything but realize there's something different that's producing that godliness amen the maturity the the the the level of and and also maturity in this godliness also brings us to a point of recognizing what we do with the word brother bam said that this bride will have thus sayith the Lord oh she'll keep quiet right amen she'll have thus sayith the Lord oh she'll keep quiet that's a discipline that's a maturity that's a level of perfection right amen of knowing when to talk when not to talk when to do when not to do how to handle the word amen how to handle the word appropriately properly Godly handle it in the way that is according to the Lord's perfect will not what we want not what we see because friendly TR TR truth be told friends my desire and what I would do is try to have everybody in the world hear it from me and be saved right that's not God's plan that's not going to happen I would want it to be that way that's my desire but see we don't operate by our desires this Perfection this godliness is knowing what to do with the word yes how to handle the word there were times that Jesus came into situations to where uh he had said his part he had done his part he had done what the Lord told him to do and then he was gone amen sometimes they were coming to Stone him and kill him and they just he just disappeared out of their midst he was no longer long there you imagine coming up to Stone somebody and all of a sudden you look around they're nowhere to be found I don't know about you but I think I'd have dropped my rock and head for my house and said I'd have crawled under my bed or something and said Lord forgive me this is this is not normal this is not human for somebody to be standing right there getting ready to be stoned and you no and they're there and they're not there anymore I'd say there's a greater power going on Lord getting me out of here but there's there's an anointing to these things too yeah amen there's an anointing that goes on I noticed it probably this year uh more than ever even in politics there's an anointing going on it it and it it reminds me uh that God's in control yeah it reminds me that it's up to God uh it reminds me that whoever's supposed to be in a in a a leadership position uh God puts them up and God sets them down it's up to the Lord yeah amen and we know where we're at in this world today friends and if it's at that point then that's up to God it does it great against my flesh you better believe it does uh I I can't stand to see it like that but it's got to happen it's going to happen yes is it now I don't know that's up to the Lord uh but it very well could be I feel like it's that close I think we all feel that way yeah but a part of the godliness that we have is knowing by the will of the Lord that God would show us what it is and what it isn't see what's true what's false what's right and what's not a lot of the gifts of the Spirit operate in that in in that way the gifts of the Spirit operate because of the godliness amen H How can there be somebody come to judge say a prophecy or something unless there's something of God there to do it with there's got to be a gift there's got to be a god there there's got to be the the purpose of God manifesting itself to show what is that truth and what is that and what is that fake what is not real uh what is just somebody uh there's probably a lot of them out today I don't accuse anybody anything but there's probably a lot of them out there today that just uh just throw wads of paper against the wall and see what sticks amen maybe I'll get one of one out of a thousand right and if I get one out of a thousand right man I'll be uh uh I'll I'll be worshiped and I I'll be known as this great person but godliness is not that way right amen godliness doesn't miss the mark godliness is right on every time amen that's why you can look and see at the prophecies and the the the visions and things of brother Bram every single one right on the mark true even to the ones that haven't come to pass yet or going to and about some maybe even about to come to pass amen but God knows amen it's up to God it's it's God's choice uh another form of godliness go over let's go over to Acts chapter 3 so much of the godliness that brings us into brings into perspective uh how we live our lives yes amen and how much we let God have control over our lives yes how much of our lives are me or is me how much of my life is me and how much of my life is God right how much of your life is you and how much of it is God now humans we all want to have control we're control freaks whether we want admit it or not we all want to have control we want to have control over everything of our lives and feel like if we've got things under control then everything's going to be okay but see you're having control over something has nothing to do whether something something's going to be okay or not in fact a lot of times we feel like we have control over something that we don't even know what's going to happen tomorrow right that's why it's so much better to let someone have control over it that knows what is tomorrow amen that is true control not fake or false control but we're humans we all want control over things but it comes down to how much I'm willing to let Jesus Christ live through me how much am I willing to die how much am I willing of to let how much of new minute willing to die how much of my will how much of my desire how much of my purpose how much of my ideals do I want to die and rot and go away so whatever Jesus whatever God in his eternal purpose has in my life can live through me because there got to be something live through me if Newton Bennett is dying then there's got to be something else live through it amen and a lot of people die out to the devil and they've died out to themselves and they live the life they want to live according to the devil moving in their lives I want God Living Through Me amen I want the Lord to live his life in me more of us to die so more of him can live amen it's not my will but thine be done that Eternal prayer that Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane when his sweat was so agonizingly large it was as drops of blood falling onto the ground but yet he cried not my will but thine be done amen amen praise the Lord let's go to acts now I said I had you turn to Acts chapter 3 Let's just begin reading with verse one having just come out amen of the upper room acts 238 the great decree that Peter gave repent be baptized receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now acts 31 acts 3:1 starts entering into their life amen Peter's life the disciples life those in the upper room uh their lives are starting to begin now they're they're they're new creatures in Christ Jesus they are born again their life their old ways their old life is dead now they're new life now they're starting their life out what do they do they go to church right Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour amen that they didn't do anything out of the ordinary just per se they didn't go out of their way to do anything they just started Living their life that's all God expects of us you say godliness is being a monk or whom and you know sitting in a room all day or bowing or beating yourself whatever people think is godliness uh doing something of of reverence or whatever that's not godliness godliness is living your life yes living the life that God gave you if you're not going to live the life God gave you then what's the point in having that life right amen right amen they just live their lives you just live your life amen you just living in a way that God lived it Jesus didn't lock himself in a room and just pray 247 uh he lived his life amen Peter and John now the disciples they're living their life now Peter and John went to the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lay from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called all beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go uh go into the temple asked in arms and Peter fasting his eyes upon him with John said look on us he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk amen just a part of his life I don't have any great riches I'm not Wealthy by any stretch of the imagination I have a dollar here or there but I don't have silver and gold but I do have something that will be of a benefit to you instead of giving you a fish so you can eat today I'm going to show you how to fish Hallelujah that you can eat the rest of your life in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth get up on your feet and walk amen that was something that Peter did have amen he didn't have cars houses lands riches silver gold no but what he did have he was able to give amen what we do have we are able to give amen it's God manifests in US that life and all that encompasses that life such as we still have today now I don't think a a part of godliness is also knowing when to do something you know brother random said that power without character is satanic right the character is what the character is having the Life of Christ the character is knowing when to do it where to do it who to do it maybe if it involves it involves every one of these aspects of it to be able to control the circumstance to match God's perfect will now I don't think for one second that Peter did this to show off he didn't do this to try to make himself a name he didn't do this just off of his own accord I believe the Lord moved him to do this yes the Lord moved on the Holy Spirit moved on Peter to do this or he would not have done it it's like Jesus the godliness of Jesus now this this may be hard for some people to swallow Saints but the godl the godliness of Jesus caused him to step over dozens and dozens and dozens of sick people lame Hal sick some even from their birth he walked all around them and all over them to get to one person right M that was the godliness in Jesus Christ to go to that one person so well he's God why didn't he go and lay hands on everybody that wasn't God's will right amen May some of them may have at some point got their healing maybe some of them were able to even get into the pool and get their healing amen this man was unable nobody could put him in the pool he could not physically get in the pool so somebody always beat him there at the troubling of the waters somebody always beat him in that pool so he wasn't able but Jesus the god listen to me now the godliness of Jesus stepped over all those sick people just to get to one man amen and when that man was healed he's when when that when Jesus got to that man he said why do you want to be healed amen what what's the point why do you why do you want to be healed I think it's a lot the same today yes people ask all the time well why do you want to be healed why do you want to be made whole yes amen some people I'm I'm sure probably even on the street today they're probably content with begging and living in a ditch that's how they live their life they they want to be that way they want to beg their alms all the time what's the point what are you going to if if God heals you what are you going to do how are you going to live your life yes amen that's a part of godliness but Jesus stepped over every one of them just to go to that one person take up thy bed and walk amen take up thy bed and walk it's time for you to go forth and do for yourself it's time for you to go forth and live your life to be an example of God Almighty to to let that life lived through you to to let your life be an example of of who God is through his perfect will now some people won't see that as godliness right people in their own minds their own intellect faults will think how could God do that how could Jesus Christ with the ability with the ability to heal everyone in there everyone walk over every one of them except for one person but that's God's godliness some a lot of people wouldn't agree with that amen a lot of times people say well why did why did God allow this and why does God allow that and why is these people sick and why are these people hungry and why did this war happen and why is this have people always but they blame it all on God you know why God why does God allow this to happen friends this is not this is not heaven we are not in a place of Utopia we are on earth we are in a place with with with Satan's Eden with the serpent seed and and men with free will right to do what they want how they want where they want when they want but God takes care of his own amen God takes care of his own the godliness of Peter came out as this guy looked and I believe this this had to be the will of the Lord amen you you don't you don't just could Jesus have walked into a hospital and emptied it out absolutely amen could could a Believer today with that same Authority do the same thing absolutely I believe that 100% right amen but not if it's not according to the will of the Lord and we shouldn't even try to do it if it's not according to the will of the Lord we pray for one another that's godliness to pray for one another in the spirit fervent effectual prayer for righteous man ofth much in the spirit of God brings forth results we believe that absolutely cuz that's the commission we all have amen but that's up to God Amen that God's purpose God's will now I believe that Peter would not have done this if it hadn't been something in him the Holy Ghost to move him to do this to look on look on us Silver and Gold Have I num but such as I have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand verse he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength when did they receive strength after he acted on that prayer and Faith amen he didn't just sat there just lay there and all of a sudden his feet came forth no he grabbed him by the hand and he began to rise up and as he did the healing began to manifest itself in his body amen and he receives strength in his feet and ankle bones he rece they receive strength and he leaping leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God Amen praise it there you go there's the results we're looking for yes amen not just somebody that's going to leap for joy and be happy about it and go to the local bar no right Le be happy pra God and go to church and went into the temple together to Worship the Lord amen that's what healing is about praise the Lord brings you in a place to live the life that God's ordained you to live yes and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they and this is what we were talking about earlier the perplexity that some people a lot of people have about God the moving of God and the will of God and the purpose of God a lot of people don't understand it yes people don't want to understand but a lot of people don't won't understand it they look and see all these people saw walking and praising God and they knew they knew that he was uh that it was he which set for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that w at that which had happened unto him and as the lame man which was held uh which was healed held Peter and John all the people ran together unto to them in the porch that is called Solomon's greatly wondering what had happened amen it's a wonder that's why you see healing sometimes I think today for us and we give God glory but it's not wow how did that happen it's like praise God Amen it's just God moving yeah the super natural should come to us to be a natural act the supernatural for the bride should be something that's very natural it shouldn't be something that's just an outstanding thing to think wow that's that's we praise God we're happy about it but we're not in amazement because we know God we know the power of God we know the healing Virtues Of God we know what God does it's not amazing to us we know that's shouldn't say it's not it is amazing but it's not like wow how did that happen we know because we know God Amen all these people they're in great amazement wondering how has this guy that's been there his whole life has now come forth he's walking he's dancing he's jumping he's leaping he's praising God and he's going over to Peter and John and when Peter saw it last verse now I'm going to read he said he answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or Holiness we had made this man to walk praise God what is this wonderful great thing this Supernatural miracle that God performed not just healing but miracle that God performed how is it followed up with great humility amen great humil why are you looking on us like we're something right why are you looking like like I did this of my own accord like of my own power Peter's like how could I couldn't have done this amen and then of course he goes on to give him a nice message and tell him Jesus Christ you crucified is the same one that raised this man and made him well same one that you don't want to have anything to do with same one you didn't ever want to listen to same one you ignored and crucified is the same God that healed this man and he's in here now producing revealing he is still God that's how it that's how it happened now repent he said there you go see the whole purpose behind it the whole purpose Paul and Silas were in misery Saints when they were in the innermost prison but when they began to praise and worship God and God begin to move that prison there was a reason for it God didn't just loose them just to be loosed he didn't loose all the prison just to be loose there was a reason behind it there was people that needed salvation there was people there that needed to know God and when they saw this miracle happen and they saw God move in such a supernatural way right in front of their eyes it was it was a time to preach repentance amen now now Peter said if you read on repent repent you all and come to Jesus Christ amen the same God that made this man whole is the same God that'll make you whole praise the Lord because there's a lot more making hold of importance than just a physical healing yeah amen spiritual healing is number one obviously amen but there's so much more healing in life than just physical healing I know we made you on that all the time in physical healings and miracles and things but there's a whole lot more things that uh that God does that's even Beyond just physical healing now let's go over I want to read this one more scripture First Timothy chapter 6 amen 1 Timothy chapter 6 now there is a people that have a form of godliness they have a form of godliness but they deny the power yes they deny God himself because if you deny the power of God you've denied God because any part of God that we reject we reject all of them you don't say I'm going to take the left ear of God and get rid of the right leg no you take all of God you don't take any of it amen uh I take the loving kind God but I don't want the vengeful judgment god well then you don't want God right amen you want all of God and there's people they have a form of godliness that's where we I guess a lot of times we get to the word piety Pious uh put forth HS uh pretentious uh facade they they make it look like they're holy they present themselves as some something that's holy or Godly they have a form of godliness uh but they deny the power of God yes amen they deny the power of God they deny the power thereof yes amen that's how the Catholic church was birth yes amen all the piety all of the Holiness all the sacredness and absolutely reject Jesus Christ absolutely reject Jesus Christ yes amen they'd rather pray pray to a woman or to a saint and I don't mean that as a KN them they'd rather pray to Mary or give alms to her or to a uh or to a dead person what they consider Saints well we kind of Sol that last week with the scripture we read amen they'd rather do that well they just deny the power of God right amen let's just Satan in instituted in there let's just say these titles father son Holy Ghost and that'll be a substitute that is not a substitute amen they just completely reject the name of Jesus Christ and do away with it amen praise the Lord 1 Timothy I had to turn to 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse 6 1 Timothy 66 but godliness with contentment is great gain amen cont contentment there's the there's the rub a lot of people have want to follow God want godliness in their lives but they don't want to do anything difficult they don't want to do anything hard they don't want to do anything that rubs against the flesh they they kind of want they just want to do what they want to do they just want to live their lives you know uh I like your salvation God but I don't want you to be my lord well he's not going to be anything there amen he's not even going to be your he's not even going to be your savior is not going to be your Lord amen and people want this but contentment finding contentment finding contentment is much is as much godliness in the things that God gives you now that's not I'm not saying complacency there's a difference in contentment and complacency amen contentment is being thankful for what God has done for you and all that you've done and work uh complacent is just you just become a bum just lazy don't want to do anything right uh you just complacent what you got or uh what little bit maybe the Lord is even uh giving you say I think I I I thank I thank God for what he's done for me but God I don't want any more just leave me alone now amen complacency contentment means god I thank you for what you've given me amen I appreciate I'm going to keep living my life I'm going to keep doing everything I'm going to try to fulfill that scripture and fulfill your word and be the person that you have me to be Lord in every capacity and and stay content with what we have I may not have as Peter said silver and gold but I do have something and that's him amen what I have I can give to others amen even more than silver and gold eternal life praise God that's up to God when God uses his children godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and rment let us be therewith content but that but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown uh which drown men in destruction and predition For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which some covet after they have ered from the faith and pierced themselves with many Sorrows but thou old man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness amen fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where un to thou are all there also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses praise the Lord lay a hold forget all those other things forget the world Amen the sparrow Falls God knows about it he feeds the birds he feeds the animals he keeps boty Life Alive going by God God does that amen people don't there AR there AR billions of people going out every day and feeding every bird that's on the planet God feeds them if God takes their care of them and he cares if one Falls and what about us will he not take care of us you have food and rment be content with what God has given you amen riches wealth all these things distort people I'm not saying that there aren't people that that have some money that won't be there I'm not saying that but what I am saying is those are things that will corrupt a person's mind yes amen he he's telling them man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness and godliness Faith love peace meekness amen follow after the things the attributes of God the fruit of the spirit follow after the things that are of godliness not it's so easy to fall into that trap too Saints especially in this world of Plenty why do you think so many people are killing themselves by Suicide and drugs and pills all the time people have to they're they're the majority I will say the majority of people in this country cannot live their lives unless they are stimulated in some way by an artificial substance whether it's gambling or liquor or cigarettes or drugs or rless living something they cannot live unless there's some kind of something stimulating them amen I I say this and and I don't I don't I don't think the guys ever watched me but um you know a lot of times the guy couple of the guys especially on the team and the guy here in town nice guy good worker I like him but man when when when he lives for his next dream I mean I don't know how to say it he lives for his next dream that that's that's his so much of the focus that he has amen is when and how and where is he going to get his next drink and it's it's sad he's only 35 I try to tell him but never know he's there for a reason but but it's not just him a lot of the world is that same way yes a lot of women business women they can't wait to get to the fridge to pull out a bottle of wine yeah there's got to be a stimulus sometime people can't live their lives just just live their life I told him the other day I said I have a stimulus you guys don't know anything about amen I I don't need I don't need all this other artificial amen I have a real stimulant you guys will have a headache from yours I'll have Jubilation for mine amen amen praise the Lord there's a big difference but it it's it it comes to the mindset get rid of those the things of the world and and take the things of God the godliness the Holiness the righteousness the meekness last scripture I'm going to read on here now amen Ephesians 4 we read this scripture as well uh a couple weeks ago Ephesians chapter 4 we'll start with verse 11 he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ edify the body of Christ and that's what it's all about edifying to build up edify is to build amen not to tear down but to build amen edify edify the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man perfect again unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ statue of perfect man stature of the fullness of Christ till we all come into this place that fullness of Jesus Christ Christ the word Christ uh uh life of God living through his people amen godliness to be like God to live the life of God Amen brotherly kindness I don't know if I have U time to finish this one amen brotherly kindness I think it's striking I always I have for years found it very very striking that on this now we know these attributes and uh we it's not like we have uh Faith obviously has to be the beginning uh without faith you can't have you can't have to to the point that they are to be uh according to uh the quote I I'll I'll read at some point in this study that brother bam talks about uh operates in in in every one of these amen uh I I but I yet found it striking that brotherly kindness comes after godliness you would think godliness would be right there with love because God is love right but notice how brotherly kindness is tucked in there between being like God and love charity seems striking to me anyway and but what does that tell us what is it what it tells me is that brotherly kindness is as important to us than we consider even our own godliness because well brother R even said that God would rather me love you than love him because when I'm loving you I'm loving him amen that's where brotherly kindness false into living your life for others amen putting yours putting your needs behind those of others now that does that doesn't mean that you go desolate or without or go hungry no no no doesn't mean that but it means that you do esteem other better than yourself brotherly kindness putting others uh uh putting yourself in others places if you will wearing uh the proverbial Man's Shoes or walking in a in the man's moccasins or however that story goes it it's the it's the proverbial putting yourself in their place how do they feel what would they feel about it what reaction would they have now I hope and pray I I try God help me I know I fall all the time but I try to live my life on that basis that I try to do to others what I believe that I would want done to me right I I I try to uh again um failing miserably I try to live I think we all try to live our lives to where uh we live in a place that we treat others like we would want to be treated we do for others like we would want others to do for us amen and and not expecting to receive back it's not a recip ation uh we're not we're not looking for reciprocation here this is not a matter of saying well I'm going to do this for you and I'm going to expect later on that you're going to do this for me no no reciprocity is not a part of the deal with God or or or or the godliness of God not deal but the godliness of God reciprocity has nothing to do with it we don't give expecting to get back no we just give right brotherly kindness is doing for others not expecting to get back not expecting that they're going to do for you now you hope maybe if that person uh is in the kind of place and lives the kind of life that they would but that should not affect brotherly kindness at all our brotherly kindness and living our lives for others uh and having that our ourselves put ourselves in their place uh is it should just be a part of of godliness a part of godliness is brotherly kindness living for other people be affectionate to other people careful of other people's feelings uh uh the way we treat one another is the way that we would treat God Amen the way that we treat one another to be able to have brotherly kindness is to live the life of God for others to see that life in you and being kind to one another live your life for others you're staring heaven in the face yes let me read this Matthew 18 2122 I have printed out here I'll probably have to pick this back up start U again next time but I wanted to try to get into this because it goes so much with godliness and charity love uh I could spend a half a dozen services on so I won't but uh so it probably will be a service unto itself uh not to the degree that I've ministered on it before but um uh but it would probably still take a whole service brotherly kindness Matthew 18 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how off shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 time 7 70 time anybody know what 70 time 7 is it's 490 but anybody know the greater Point outside the math amen because this is a daily occurrence amen if I forgive one and that doesn't mean that that's not an overall 490 for every human I encounter that day that's 490 per day per person so God is God is not telling Peter Peter this person's not a good person and when they get to 489 at the 490th time in that day that they offend you you have every right to come against them then that's not what he's saying right 490 is a large number never be reached right what he's telling us is it's Limitless what he's saying is when this brother when this person transgress against you forgiven period no questions asked now I think Peter probably thought man I'm GNA sound like a really good guy here I'm gonna go for a high number seven times a day Lord this one person seven times in a day he thought he was I Pro I think he probably thought he was going for this great number he's going to look he's going to look great in front of Jesus he's going to be he's going to be the topnotch number one disciple cuz remember he he was still a very prideful man at this point did not have the Holy Ghost he probably thought oh I'm going to I'm going to Jesus really gonna seven times I'm going to forgive my brother Jesus looked at him and said nope 70 times seven in other words Peter it's Limitless right you don't put a limit on how many times you forgive a brother how many times you forgive a sister you don't put a limit on on forgiveness you forgive amen forgive let God it again we can go back to uh to some of the other virtues but Vengeance belongs to God not us we are to forgive I forgive I forgive you amen it does now I I might have forgave you for running over me one time but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stick my head under your wheel again amen I'm not going to lay down in front of your car again you've already proved you're going to run over me so I'm not going to lay down in front of you again but I forgive you for doing it right amen amen you understand it's not saying I'm I'm GNA put myself in that situation again uh but I will forgive yes I will forgive you amen and and not just lip service um it's uh it's so easy and my mind is going so many ways now good uh and all through my book right but forgive amen forgiveness brotherly kindness brings us to forgiveness and that's what Jesus is telling Peter forgive amen you don't become their doormat but you forgive them right if you don't forgive them if you don't really truly forgive them that seed is going to stay in there yes amen that seed is going to stay in there and it's going to start growing because the seed the seed will will grow to its to its manifestation again amen it will grow it's got to be completely eradicated dug out cut down stumped grubbed up and everything amen every bit of Speck of Life of that has got to be done away with annihilated amen for forgiv foress to truly take hold to truly take hold now are we supposed to wait for someone to ask for forgiveness or do we just forgive asking is nice but does that always happen actually probably more seldom than really is one of the few things that a lot of people don't even want to say I'm wrong most people don't don't even want to utter those two words words I'm wrong actually that's a conjunction three words really I am wrong and uh forgive me sometimes they go together forgive me I was wrong but a lot of people don't want to say those words they just too much pride right they don't want to say it they won't say it and sometimes people may have hurt you and you didn't even know it or they didn't know it they didn't know they hurt you that happens yeah but you forgive right amen forgive make it right whole another subject but a part of Brotherly kindness is looking at one another as our own selves amen amen I read that scripture as I close um where David said though they do I'm paraphrasing of course I didn't I didn't U Save it but though they do evil against me I will do good to them I will pray for them as though they were my own mother right amen that's pretty heavy considering at least most people uh how they would pray for their own mother amen that gave them life that that brought them into the world Amen that was his admission I'll pray for that person that hurt me and despitefully used me in a way that I pray for my own mother amen praise the Lord brotherly kindness the part of godliness that will bring us to that point Lord willing I'll try to finish the rest of this next week
